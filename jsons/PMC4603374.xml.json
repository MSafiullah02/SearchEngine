The first nanoparticle (NP) therapy was approved by the FDA in 1989. Subsequently, numerous NP therapies have been approved, most of which have focused on optimizing the safety and pharmacokinetic properties of small-molecule agents and hormones 2, 3. More recently, our increasing knowledge of the cellular subsets and regulatory roles of various members of immune system, combined with the emergence of safe, biocompatible nanoparticle platforms, is catalyzing the development of complex, highly adaptable, and programmable NP therapies that are predicted to revolutionize the standard of care of numerous disorders. For example, NPs may be engineered to specifically target cells of the mononuclear phagocyte system (MPS) for the purposes of restoring peripheral immune tolerance or to regulate aberrant monocyte activities during severe inflammation 2, 4, 5, 6, 7. Five-hundred-nanometer NPs with negative zeta potential can be harnessed to target circulating monocytes, reducing their potential for causing immune pathology in numerous experimental disease models including West Nile virus (WNV) encephalitis, myocardial infarction, and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) [8]. The combination of such NPs with specific autoantigens can also be used to restore peripheral immune tolerance in autoimmune models including experimental autoimmune encephalitis (EAE) 5, 6, 7, 9. In addition, NPs maybe utilized to mop up extraneous circulating inflammatory mediators.",

The ability to synthesize NPs from biocompatible and biodegradable polymers such as poly-lactide-co-glycolide (PLGA) has revolutionized the use of NPs in the field of immune modulatory therapeutics and this will be the focus here. NPs can be engineered to deliver, alone or in any combination, small-molecule drugs (including immune suppressants and chemotherapeutic agents), proteins (hormones and antibodies), peptides (for vaccine or immune tolerance purposes), DNA (as part of gene therapy approaches), miRNAs, and even machinery to target clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat (CRISPR) components for gene-editing purposes. It is now clear that the physiochemical characteristics of unadorned NPs can also alter immune responses independently of any associated active pharmaceutical ingredient [8].",

A straightforward approach is to chemically conjugate the desired active molecule to the particle. Peptide antigens have been chemically conjugated to NPs using 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide (EDC or ECDI) 6, 9, which attaches the amine on the target to a carboxylic acid on the particle. Various chemistries, such as Click chemistry or Michael-type addition, are available and their use is based on the chemical groups within the polymer and on the cargo molecule. Alternatively, the active molecule can be incorporated into the particle directly. Using PLGA to exemplify the approach, if the cargo is either soluble in an organic solvent or stable in a crystalline form when dispersed in an organic solvent [10], the encapsulation can be accomplished using a water/oil single-emulsion method. For delivery of water-soluble molecules, these are incorporated into polymeric NPs using a water\u2013oil\u2013water double-emulsion method [11]. For the double-emulsion method, the aqueous drug is initially dispersed within the dissolved polymer solution and then a second emulsion is formed with an aqueous solution containing an emulsifying agent.",

NPs entering cells via pathways that allow access to the cytosol have different immune-modulating capabilities from those taken up via phagocytosis 12, 13, 14. Size and shape influence biodistribution and the mechanism of particle uptake 15, 16, but studies using a broad range of standard cell lines (HeLa, CHO, Caco-2, and MCF-7) and NPs (derived from gold, polystyrene, polymer, silicon, titanium, and iron oxide) show that the ideal size and shape for particle uptake depends on the cell type 16, 17. In non-phagocytic cell types, NP <100 nm diameter are most efficiently taken up via caveola- or clathrin-mediated processes 15, 16. For professional antigen-presenting cells (APCs) such as macrophages and dendritic cells (DCs), uptake is impacted more by shape than size, with spherical NPs having more favorable uptake kinetics than rod-shaped NPs, irrespective of NP size [18].

            "text": "NP charge is a dynamic physicochemical characteristic, with the particle microenvironment, including the protein corona, all capable of altering the surface charge of NPs. Generally speaking, NP charge can be modified by increasing the number of carboxyl (negative charge) or amine (positive charge) groups on the surface of the NP. Studies using different NP charges have clearly shown that this factor influences both uptake mechanisms and downstream immune outcomes. For instance, relative to anionic particles, cationic NPs appear to be taken up more readily via clathrin-mediated processes [21]. Furthermore, positively charged antigen-loaded NPs are significantly more effective at stimulating Th1 responses after either intradermal or mucosal (pulmonary) inoculation, whereas anionic particles stimulate T and B cell responses poorly under similar conditions 22, 23. The ability of cationic particles to stimulate Th1 responses has been associated with preferential DC uptake of such particles and the propensity of cationic particles to regulate positive costimulatory molecules [24]. However, cationic NPs may also alter mitochondrial and endoplasmic reticulum function, triggering the production of reactive oxygen species and proinflammatory cytokines, as well as cell death 25, 26, 27. These events may underlie the adjuvant effects of cationic NPs, but attempts to harness this phenomenon clinically will need to address the consequences of any off-target toxicities.",

NPs made of rigid materials may be associated with increased potential for embolism, while flexible polymer-based NPs that can more easily deform may gain better access to tissues during the complex vascular changes associated with inflammation. The fluidity of NPs, too, affects the ability of antigen-loaded NP to stimulate immune responses. Thus, intramuscular, solid-phase, antigen-containing liposome immunization elicits a more robust Th1/Th17 response than similarly administered fluid-phase liposomes [28]. The stimulatory ability of solid-phase particles is proposed to result from the formation of an immobilized antigen particle depot, similar to that observed for traditional oil-in-water emulsions and aluminum adjuvants 29, 30. This results in a prolonged supply of antigen for APCs and is also associated with upregulation of positive costimulatory molecules such as CD80, which support efficient T cell priming [28]. By contrast, intramuscularly injected fluid-state liposomes are rapidly removed, do not appear to stimulate positive costimulation, and are much less capable of stimulating a T cell response [28]. Whether the intramuscular fluid liposome\u2013antigen combination induced peripheral immune tolerance was not tested, but intraperitoneal (IP) administration of fluid OVA-decorated liposomes can induce antigen-specific IgE non-responsiveness 31, 32. While this was argued to occur in a T cell-independent fashion, the increased levels of IgG after IP administration suggest immune deviation [33]. Notwithstanding this, these findings highlight the importance of understanding the contribution of fluidity and stiffness in NP-mediated manipulation of immune outcomes.",

Constituents of the protein corona are thus inevitably impacted by the protein content of the serum and thus by the homeostatic or immune responses that regulate it. The above studies show that proteins with high abundance, such as albumin, comprise a significant proportion of the primary corona 34, 38.

However, proteins binding to NPs could feasibly alter NP charge or mask functional groups important for NP targeting to certain receptors and/or enhance clearance of NPs by phagocytes 27, 36, 40. Therefore, NP engineering efforts have focused on the development of techniques to reduce this phenomenon [41]. Many of these methods have been informed by experience gained from increasing the half-life of biologic therapies [42]. Commonly used processes include coating the NP's surface with polymeric ethylene glycol (PEG) or its low molecular weight derivative polyethylene oxide (PEO) [43]. PEG increases surface hydrophilicity, resulting in improved circulating NP half-life due to reduced serum protein binding [43]. Unlike PEG, the use of PEO to develop \u2018stealth\u2019 NPs has been associated with potential toxicity issues. Like, PEG, PEO forms a mushroom- or brush-like configuration on the surface of NPs. Unlike PEG, however, PEO may activate the C1q-dependent complement pathway in its mushroom-like configuration, whereas the brush-like configuration can trigger the lectin-specific complement cascade [44]. Interestingly, although NP coatings may prolong NP serum half-life, cells of the MPS still appear to be involved in the primary clearance mechanism for intravenously infused NPs [43]. Although these observations highlight the possibilities for modulating NP surfaces to reduce opsonization events, they also serve as a potent warning that such changes can dramatically alter the biocompatibility of NPs.",

Subcutaneously administered NP are exposed to a highly specialized immune environment containing numerous migratory antigen-presenting subsets as well as relatively sedentary structural cells such as fibroblasts, all in the context of the local lymphatic drainage system. Similar to mucosal and intramuscular sites, the lymphatics carry APCs to local lymph nodes where processing and containment of antigenic material occurs. Small particles (<200 nm) may drain freely from subcutaneous, muscular, and even mucosal sites of application to local lymph nodes [50]. However, particles >200 nm in size must be phagocytosed by local or blood-derived phagocytes before transport to the draining lymph nodes. Both freely draining and APC-associated NPs arrive in the subcapsular sinus of the lymph node. This region is rich in CD169-expressing macrophages [51], which in the spleen are important for the coordination of CD8+ dendritic cells and their stimulation of effective CD4+ and CD8+ T cell responses against invading pathogens [52]. Subcutaneous delivery of NPs is very effective for stimulating immune responses to numerous T and B cell antigens 50, 53. Once there, NPs rarely escape the lymph node, which generally contains foreign antigenic material to limit the spread of invasive pathogens. Only ultrafine NPs (30 nm in size) seem to circumvent this sequestration [54]. However, this size of NP is associated with increased potential for oncogenesis and toxicity.",

Recently, extracorporeal filters such as the cytosorb, used during dialysis, have been effective in sepsis 66, 67. However, this treatment modality is limited by the need for expensive dialysis machinery. NPs may revolutionize this approach as NPs may be engineered for in vivo use, with surface modifications or the attachment of antibodies or other moieties, to bind specific toxins and/or proteins before being safely digested by liver and spleen phagocytes. In recent rodent proof-of-concept studies, infused highly negatively charged \u2018immune-modifying NPs\u2019 (IMPs) can absorb certain blood proteins, including S100 family and heat shock proteins, before finally being removed and destroyed by cells of the mononuclear phagocyte system 8, 39, 68. Furthermore, this mechanism may also be used to capture and concentrate certain circulating proteins. IMPs have been shown to bind Annexin 1. The accumulation of Annexin 1 and its presentation to particular leukocyte subsets can have broad immune outcomes. For example, Annexin 1-loaded NPs may reduce neutrophils via induction of apoptosis [69] and/or promote T cell activation [70].",

By contrast, a much smaller, CD14lo, CD16hi \u2018nonclassical\u2019 or patrolling monocyte subset comprises some 10% of blood monocytes in humans and is defined as Ly6Clo CD43hi CCR2lo CX3CR1hi in mice 72, 73. CD14hi CD16hi and Ly6Chi CD43hi subsets define an intermediate group in humans and mice, respectively. Comparative RNA profiling suggests that human intermediate monocytes are functionally closest to mouse classical monocytes 74, 75. Work in many areas, including infectious disease, hypoxia, autoimmunity, and cancer, shows a definable wave of inflammatory monocyte recruitment into inflamed tissues expressing CCL2 and other chemokines. Once in the target tissue, these cells may differentiate into different effector cells, including DCs, macrophages, and even cells with a microglial phenotype 4, 76, depending on the prevailing soluble factor milieu. In some cases these cells have important housekeeping functions (i.e., to digest and clear tissue debris before tissue remodelling); however, in many cases they express high levels of NO via induced NOS2 expression, as well as increased levels of NADPH oxidase, cathepsins, and myeloperoxidase, all of which may demonstrably contribute to further tissue damage in numerous conditions, including experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis, myocardial infarction, and viral encephalitis 8, 77, 78.

One approach involving the combination of siRNA with liposomes has shown some promise in animal models [78]. However, we have recently shown that NPs derived from a broad array of biodegradable and non-degradable compounds and molecules, without traditional active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) or other additional immune-stimulating agents, are able, through targeting of precise scavenger receptors, to reduce circulating inflammatory monocytes. Specifically, IMPs (i.e., NPs with a highly negative surface charge) bind with high specificity to inflammatory monocytes, marking them for sequestration by the spleen and thereby preventing migration to sites of inflammation and subsequent differentiation and participation in pathogenic immune responses [8]. Sequestered monocytes either undergo caspase-3-mediated apoptosis or differentiate into CD11b+ CD11c+ CD103+ DCs 8, 39. While the role of these CD103+ CD11b+ DCs remains to be completely defined, IMP treatment is associated with the expansion of a short-lived, TIM3-expressing regulatory T cell (Treg) population [39] (D.R. Getts et al., unpublished). The emergence and subsequent disappearance of these Tregs correlates with treatment efficacy in EAE models [39]. This monocyte management approach is effective in numerous models of inflammation (Table 1\n) and Phase 1/2 clinical studies are planned for 2016.",

The \u2018Holy Grail\u2019 of autoimmune therapy is the restoration or induction of robust peripheral immune tolerance in only those cells causing disease. The use of apoptotic cells to induce tolerance was uncovered originally in 1979 [79] and has shown promise in an early clinical study [80], However, the use of cells has numerous manufacturing, cost, and patient accessibility issues. The serendipitous discovery that negatively charged NPs target specific scavenger receptors and localize to the same regions of the spleen, similar to apoptotic cells, catalyzed the development of a synthetic cell replacement that could carry antigen for immune tolerance induction 6, 8, 81. Subsequently, several NP-based approaches for the induction of immune tolerance that function via alternative mechanisms have emerged. Some focus on harnessing the natural capabilities of NPs to deliver antigen in a tolerogenic fashion, while other approaches deliver antigen combined with small-molecule immune suppressants or target aryl hydrocarbon receptors to change DC phenotype 5, 6, 7, 9. Below is a brief discussion of the mechanisms through which NPs have been shown to induce tolerance, with a focus on harnessing NP delivery of antigen without additional immune suppressants or modulating agents.",

The primary hurdle for antigen-specific tolerance approaches remains the identification of disease-associated antigens and their epitopes. Thus, in many autoimmune diseases, the epitopes associated with disease remain to be defined. Identification is further complicated in multiple sclerosis (MS), for example, by the fact that the appropriate target antigen may change over time due to epitope spreading. Nevertheless, in some disorders, including celiac disease, MS, and type 1 diabetes, numerous antigens have been identified 80, 82, 83, 84. Another potential strategy, which both harnesses the natural mechanisms that may have initiated autoimmunity and obviates the need for knowing the precise epitopes, may be the use of full-length proteins. Encapsulation of full-length proteins may allow host APCs to liberate numerous non-defined epitopes from autoantigens, similar to the process that presumably underlies the initiation of the disease.",

            "text": "The appropriate targeting and subsequent tolerogenic stimulation of certain populations of APCs is crucial for immune tolerance induction. Incorrect targeting can result in immune stimulation. For example, antigen-loaded NPs that are designed to target CD40, DEC205, or CD11c induce robust production of IL-12 and type 2 interferon as well as CD8+ T cell proliferation [85], whereas particles that target MARCO+ macrophages in the liver and spleen induce tolerance [6]. This highlights the fact that APC populations are not created equal, with some populations better equipped for tolerance induction and others equipped for immune induction. Germane to this, splenic and liver macrophage populations express numerous scavenger receptors, which during homeostasis play an important role in the recognition and recycling of dying leukocytes, red blood cells, and other debris on a daily basis 86, 87, 88. Importantly, these activities occur without triggering inflammation or breaking peripheral immune tolerance. Tolerogenic IMPs (TIMPs) were designed to take advantage of the MARCO-targeting ability of highly negatively charged NPs 8, 89. The intravenous administration of antigen-encapsulated IMPs results in biodistribution similar to that of apoptotic debris 6, 81, with particles homing to MARCO+ macrophages in the liver and spleen (Figure 2\n) 6, 8, 9, 81. More importantly, one course of TIMPs results in tolerance induction through T cell anergy and the parallel induction of Tregs [90]. This mechanism has subsequently been shown to be applicable to the induction of long-lived tolerance in numerous Th1-, Th17-, and even Th2-mediated rodent disease models (Table 2\n).",

In the context of TIMPs, IP administration results in only partial tolerance, while subcutaneous and oral delivery fail to induce regulation 5, 6, 9. In some cases, subcutaneous administration can even result in sensitization and/or disease exacerbation 5, 6, 9. The lymph nodes appear to be devoid of inherently \u2018tolerogenic\u2019 macrophage populations. This may be unsurprising, since most epithelial surfaces are consistently being challenged by opportunistic and other pathogens and, as a potential defense mechanism, epithelial and lymph node APC populations tend to express higher levels of costimulatory molecules than APCs elsewhere (D.R. Getts et al., unpublished). There have been attempts to utilize NPs that combine antigen and immune-suppressive agents such as rapamycin to alter DC phenotype in vivo and potentially induce tolerance 5, 6, 9. Rapamycin has been known for over two decades to have \u2018tolerogenic\u2019 effects when combined with antigen 91, 92 and the adoptive transfer of rapamycin-treated DCs can promote the long-term survival of skin grafts in rodent transplant recipients [93]. In the context of NPs, Haddadi and colleagues showed that rapamycin-loaded PLGA NPs preferentially bound to DCs and induced an immature \u2018tolerogenic\u2019 phenotype [61]. More recently, Maldonado and colleagues showed that biweekly subcutaneous injections of pegylated PLGA rapamycin and OVA323\u2013334 NPs significantly reduced the production of OVA-specific IgG [5]. However, it should be noted that, with repeated OVA exposure, titers were observed to increase over time in treated mice [5]. Using similar particles, although loaded with PLP139\u2013151, the authors also showed that subcutaneous injection could reduce the incidence of EAE; however, unlike intravenous infusion, protection was not 100% 5, 94. Another strategy that focuses on altering DC phenotype is the administration of NPs that agonize the ligand-activated transcription factor aryl hydrocarbon receptor 7, 95, 96, 97. The activation of aryl hydrocarbon receptor on DCs supports their differentiation into tolerogenic APCs, which supports the expansion of Tregs 95, 96, 97. Using the MOG35\u201355 or PLP39\u2013151 EAE model, pegylated gold NPs loaded with the aryl hydrocarbon receptor agonist 2-(1\u2032H-indole-3\u2032-carbonyl)-thiazole-4-carboxylic acid methyl ester and MOG35\u201355 or PLP39\u2013151 were tested for their ability to ameliorate disease [7]. While not tested subcutaneously, weekly IP or IV administration of these NPs successfully resulted in disease management [7].",

A more antigen-specific approach includes using polymeric or monomeric peptide MHC (pMHC), which may selectively delete T cells expressing the cognate T cell receptor that recognizes the pMHC complex. These have shown efficacy in experimental models of transplantation and type 1 diabetes; however, clinical translation is complicated by the requirement of having exquisite knowledge of each autoreactive epitope 99, 100.

In the future, the development of novel biocompatible polymers, as well as our increased understanding of the precise interplay between the physiochemical characteristics of NPs and their associated downstream immune interactions, is likely to result in further expansion of the field. In the next 3\u20135 years, several clinical studies are expected to begin testing the ability of highly negatively charged PLGA NPs to reduce severe inflammation in myocardial infarction and acute encephalitis syndrome [8]. Furthermore, evidence suggests that clinical testing of NP tolerance platforms in areas such as pemphigus vulgaris, types 1 diabetes, MS and even celiac disease is likely to occur in the next 2\u20133 years (http://www.courpharma.com; http://selectabio.com). Moving forward, questions surrounding the most appropriate NP formulation and safety will need to be addressed. Further barriers, such as antigen identification in the context of autoimmunity treatments, also remain. At the very least, these studies will inform future NP approaches.

MARCO is expressed on circulating inflammatory monocytes as well as marginal zone macrophages. Based on TIMP size (500 nm), phagocytosis is likely to be the primary uptake mechanism. On uptake, these macrophage populations produce IL-10 and TGF. These factors have numerous immune regulatory functions including modulating the level of PD-L1 on antigen-presenting cells (APCs). When integrated, these APC responses coordinate the regulation of autoreactive T cells via three predominant pathways. In the context of activated autoreactive T cells, the upregulation of negative costimulatory molecules on APCs, including PDL-1 and CTLA-4, promote autoreactive T cell anergy and apoptosis. With na\u00efve T cell regulation resulting from TCR stimulation (signal 1), without regulatory T cell induction. Although the precise temporal contribution of each regulatory mechanism requires further examination, evidence suggests that tolerance is the result of early anergy, with regulatory T cells (TREGS) playing a major role in long-term tolerance maintenance.",
