The field of proteomics aims at studyingt he expression, structure, and function of all proteins on the whole genome level. It has been estimated that human genome consists of 19 000 genes coding for~500 000 proteins. [1] Over 80 % of all proteins do not exist in isolation,b ut rather interact with one another to form stable or transient complexes. [2] Proteinprotein interactions (PPIs) thus play ac entral role in virtually all biological processes, such as metabolism, transport, structural organization,s ignal transduction, cell-cycle control,i mmune recognition,a nd gene transcription.

When ap hotono fl ights hits the metal surface (typically ag old film) at ac ertain angle of incidence, the light energy is transferred to collective excitationsoffree electrons, called surface plasmons, and generates electromagnetic waves that propagate along the interface. Resonant transfer of light energy to surface plasmons leads to as harp attenuation in the reflected light. The angle of incidencea tw hich minimum reflectiono ccurs is defined as the SPR angle. As light change near the interface (e.g.,achange in refractive index in the vicinity of the metal surface) leads to ac hange in the SPR angle. [27, 28] Ab iosensor system based on SPR has become one of the most popular sensing technology for measuring molecular interactions. In an SPR experiment, the bait protein is first immobilized onto the sensorc hip, which is then perfused with buffer solution containing analytes.I fi nteraction occurs, the accumulation of analytes on the sensor surfacei nduces an increase in the refractive index at the sensor surface, and the SPR angle is shifted ( Figure 1B ). During dissociation, the inverse effect is observed. The RU (termed response or resonance unit) is recordedt od escribe this signal change, where one RU is equivalent to ac riticala ngle shift of 10 \u00c04 degree. [29] Mi Zhou studied molecular biology at To ngji University (Shanghai, China) and received aMaster's degree in 2010.

It is capable of characterizing bindingr eaction in real time, determining kinetic and thermodynamic constants of biomolecular interactions, anda llowing the analysis of interactions with aw ide range of molecular weights, affinities and binding rate. Ap otentiall imitation is its sensitivity to interfering effects such as nonspecific interaction between the sensor surface and analyte. [35] Additionally,t he requirementf or immobilizationm ight disturb the interactions under measurement. The SPR technique has traditionally been used in low-throughput studies as standard SPR biosensor only contains three to four flow cells on as ingle sensorc hip. Nowadays, SPR imaging (SPRI) is extended towards HTS. By utilizing protein array technology and ac harge-coupled device (CCD) camerat om ake images based on the intensity of reflected light, SPRI has been developed to simultaneously process hundreds or thousands of samples. [28, 36] Furthermore, using the SPR techniquec oupled with mass spectrometry (MS) enablesthe discovery of novel PPIs. [27, 37] ",

In at ypical ITC experiment, one interacting protein placed in the injection syringe is titrated in small aliquots into another in as ample cell, which is temperature controlled and coupled to ar eference cell via as ensitive thermopile/thermocouple circuit. The heat either released (an exothermic reaction) or absorbed (an endothermic reaction) at equilibrium conditions over the course of titration can be measured directly with sufficient sensitivity (in the order of several hundred nanojoules) [72] (Figure 1C ). ITC does not suffer from constraints of molecular size, shape or chemical constitution. Neither is there any need for immobilizationo rm odification of proteins. [73] However,e xtreme care must be taken in the use of ab uffer in an ITC experiment, that is,b othi nteracting proteinsi nt he sample cell as well as the syringe should be dialyzed in an identicalb uffer to minimize the artifacts generatedb ym ismatchedb uffer components. [74] The main parameters extracted from ITC experiment include association constant (K a ), enthalpy change (DH), reaction stoichiometry (n), heatc apacity change (DC p ), free energy change (DG)a nd entropy change (DS).

This effect is highly sensitive to binding-induced changes in variousm olecular properties, such as size, charge, conformation or hydration shell. [84] In at ypical MST experiment, one of the interacting proteins is fluorescently labeled. It is normally done by using N-hydroxysuccinimide (NHS) dye to react with ap rimary amine group on the labeled protein, or ar ecombinant protein fused to af luorescentp rotein such as green fluorescent protein (GFP). Alternatively,M ST can be performed in al abel-free manner,i nw hich the intrinsic UV-fluorescent signal of the aromatic amino acid residues is detected. AM ST instrument uses an infrared (IR) laser to heat ad efined sample volumei nside ac apillary and produces at emperature gradient spanning 2-6 K. The thermophoretic movement of the fluorescent protein is measured by detecting the fluorescencee mission of the heat spot within the sample before,d uring, and after the IR laser is switched on. Beforeh eating, the initial fluorescence is recordeda taconstantl evel. Once the IR laser is switched on, the increase of temperature leads to an abrupt decreasei nf luorescence intensity, so called temperature jump (T-jump). After that, the fluorescenced ecreases slowly (thermophoresis) until reaching as teady state. When the IR laser is switched off, the fluorescencer ecovery (inverse T-jump and back-diffusion) is observed [85] [86] [87] (Figure 1D ). During this procedure, both T-jump and the thermophoresis process can be affected by abinding eventdue to changes in size, charge or hydration shell.Hence, MST can be appliedtodeterminedissociation constantso fP PIs via titration, in which ac onstantc oncentration of fluorescent protein and varying concentrationso fi ts nonfluorescent binding partner are applied. [84, 88, 89] MST has severala dvantages over other in vitro biophysical methods, including easy setting, fast measurement (binding affinity is determined in 10 min), and low sample consumption (a few microliters at nanomolar concentrations). It allows quantitativem easurement of high-affinity interactions with dissociation constant in the picomolarrange. In addition, it can be performed in any buffer or even in complex bioliquids like blood serum or cell lysate. [87, 90] 3. Biochemical Methods",

Furthermore, ad onor- Figure 2 . Illustration of some biochemicalmethods for PPI detection. A) Fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) between aC FP-fused bait and aY FPfused prey,where CFP and YFP act as the donor and the acceptor fluorophore, respectively.Ift he bait and the prey do not interact, excitation of CFP results in light emission (475 nm) by CFP only.When bait-prey interaction occurs, CFP and YFP are brought into proximity,leading to energy transfer from CFP to nearby YFP.Then, YFP emission can be detected at 528 nm. B) Bioluminescence resonance energytransfer (BRET)between a Rluc-fused bait and aEYFP-fused prey,where Rluc and EYFP act as the donor luciferase and the acceptor fluorophore, respectively.I fbait and prey do not interact,only the blue-emittings pectrum (480 nm) of RLuc can be detected.W hen bait-prey interaction occurs, bioluminescence energy generated by Rluc in the presenceo fi ts substrate (coelenterazine) is transferred to EYFP,which in turn generates light emission at 530 nm. C) AlphaScreen. Upon excitation at 680 nm, ap hotosensitizing agent on the donor bead converts ambientoxygen to singletoxygen. When bait-prey interaction brings the donor and the acceptor bead into close proximity,energy is transferred from singlet oxygen to thioxene derivatives on the acceptor bead, resulting in light emission at 520-620 nm. D) Protein-fragmentcomplementation assay (PCA). Complementary C-terminal and N-terminal fragments of GFP are fused to the bait and the prey,respectively.Ifthe bait and the prey do not interact,t he fragments remainu nstructured and lack functional activity.W hen the bait-prey interaction occurs,two fragments are brought together to form afull-length GFP with the native structure and function. E) Pull-down assay.I naGSTp ull-down assay,t he bait is expressed as aGST-fusedp rotein, and it is incubatedwith cell or tissuelysate containing the prey.The GST-bait-prey complex is captured by glutathione-coupled beads and eluted for analysis by SDS-PAGE. F) Ta ndem affinity purification (TAP).I nthistype of assay,t he TAPtag (including CBP,aTEV cleavage site, and ProtA)isf used to the bait, and then the whole construction is introduced into the host cell. The TAP-bait-prey complex is isolated from cell lysatevia affinity column containingI gG beads.A fter washing,T EV protease is added to release the CBP-bait-prey complex, which is then immobilized on calmodulin-coated beads. Afterw ashing,t he native complex is eluted by chelating calcium using EGTA. G) Co-immunoprecipitation( Co-IP). The bait-prey complex in cell or tissuelysateisc aptured by beads functionalized with ab ait-specific antibody,a nd then co-precipitated, washed, eluted, and analyzed by SDS-PAGE. H) ELISA. In the case of directE LISA, the bait is immobilized on am icrowell plate, and then cell lysate containingthe prey is applied to the wells. After incubation and washinga way unbound proteins, the bait-prey complex is detected by an HRP-conjugated antibody against the prey.Finally,asubstanceoft he HRP enzyme is added, which in turn produces detectable fluorescence-or absorbance-baseds ignal via the enzymatic reaction.I)Proximity ligation assay (PLA). The bait and prey are recognized by their respective PLAprobes consisting of antibodies and single-stranded DNA oligonucleotides, where the free oligonucleotide ends are brought into proximity.Ano ligonucleotide connecter is added to hybridize to the complementary oligonucleotides on the PLA probes.

[96] Such large fluorophore can also be replaced by as mall, membrane-permeable fluorescein derivativet ermed FlAsH, whicht argets to as hort tetracysteine motif (e.g., CCPGCC) introduced to the protein sequence withoutd isturbing the protein function. [97] With the development of optimizedF RET pairs, FRET has been appliedt oi nvitro binding assay for screening of PPI inhibitors. [98, 99] Combined with microscopy imaging technologies, it can also be used to visualize and quantify PPIs in real time in living cells, with high spatiotemporal resolution. [100] [101] [102] As FRET microscopy relies on the ability to collect fluorescent signals from protein interactions, it suffers from some drawbacks, including auto-fluorescence, detector noise, optical noise, photobleaching, and spectral bleedthrough signals (partial overlap of donor and acceptor emission wavelengths). [103] Therefore, several methods have been used to correct for these problems and calculate FRET efficiency,e ach with its own strengths and weaknesses, [104] including sensitized emission, [105, 106] acceptor photobleaching, [107] [108] [109] fluorescence life-time imaging microscopy (FLIM), [110] [111] [112] spectral imaging, [113, 114] and fluorescence polarization imaging. [115, 116] FRET experiments can also be performed using af low cytometer. Thist ype of experiment allows the analysiso falarge number of cells in as hort time, producing statistically more robust results than the microscope technique. However,i tc annotb eu sed to analyze intracellular structures. [108, 117, 118] Applicability of FRET with al aser scanning cytometer (LSC) combines attributes of both microscopy and flow cytometry,a nd yields informationo napixel-by-pixel and cell-by-cell basis. [119] Time-resolved FRET (TR-FRET)i saspecial form of FRET in which long-life emission fluorophores (lanthanidess uch as europium and terbium) are used as donors. Commonly used donor-accepter pairs includes europium chelate or cyptate-allophycocyanin, [120, 121] europium chelate-Cy5, [122] europium chelate-Dy647, [123] terbium cryptate-d2, [124] and terbium-AF488. [125] As carriers of lanthanides, chelate and cryptate not only absorb light and transfer energyt ol anthanides,b ut also protect lanthanides from quenching by water molecules. [126] Labeling the protein of interest is usually carriedo ut by using primary antibodies or antibodies against epitopes, such as glutathione S-transferase (GST), to which the donoro ra cceptor fluorophores are conjugated. Since the donor species used in TR-FRET has longer emission lifetime( micro-to milliseconds) as comparedw ith conventional fluorophores (1-50 ns), it permits at emporal delay between donor excitation and detection of acceptore mission. This property enables TR-FRET to circumvent limitations of conventional FRET,such as cross-talk, photobleaching, and bleedthrough. It also decreases interference from short-life background fluorescence, such as autofluorescence from library compoundsa nd endogenous fluorescent proteins in biological fluids or serum. [126] [127] [128] Besides quantifying association and dissociation events through time-gated fluorescence intensity measurements, TR-FRETc an also be performed in as imple mix-and-read format for HTS of PPIi nhibitors. [121] [122] [123] Bioluminescence resonance energy transfer (BRET) is analogous to FRET except that the energy donor is ab ioluminescent protein rather than af luorescent protein. Upon oxidation of its substrate, the luminescent donorp rotein, typically Renilla luciferase (Rluc), emits light to excite the fluorescent acceptorp rotein in close proximity. [129] As BRET does not requiree xtrinsic excitation by al ight source, thereby avoiding the technical problemsa ssociated with FRET,s uch as auto-fluorescence, photobleaching, simultaneous excitation of both donor and acceptorf luorophores. [130] In the originalv ersion of BRET,n owadays called BRET1,e nhanced YFP (EYFP) is used as the acceptor and coelenterazine hisused as the substrate for Rluc [131] (Figure 2B) . Thereafter,s everal otherv ersionso fB RET with different substrates and energy donor-acceptor pairs have been developed,f or example, BRET2, with GFP 2 (a blue-shifted variant of GFP) as the acceptora nd am odified coelenterazine, Deep-BlueC,a st he substrate for Rluc, leadingt oi ncreased spectral separation between donor and acceptor emission. [132] Extended BRET (eBRET) enables the investigation of PPIs in real time over extended timescales by using ap rotected form of coelenterazine h, termedE nduRen TM . [133] BRET3 exhibits severalf old improvement in light intensity by using RLuc8 and mOrange as the donor and acceptor, respectively. [134] NanoBRET, with ac oelenterazine derivative (furimazine) as the donor and ac hloroalkane derivative of nochloro TOM (NCT) dye as the acceptor, provides improved spectral resolution and greaterl ight intensity. [135] Sometimes microscopic imaging for BRET is limited due to its lowlevel of light emission from bioluminescent reactions. With improvementsi ns ensitiveC CD cameras and advanced microscopes, new derivationsofB RET technology becomes uitable for capturing luminescent light and progress to made towards BRET imaging in single cells, tissues,a nd live animals.

This simple survival selection assay is widely used as asystematic approach for large-scale analysis, for example, to monitors ignal transductionn etwork in eukaryotes, [156] to map the yeast protein interactome, [157] or to study the globalo rganization of yeast PPI networks in response to environmental perturbations. [158] (2) In split-ubiquitin PCA, if bait-prey interaction occurs,r eassembly of ubiquitin recruitsu biquitin-specific proteaset hat cleaves off ar eporter protein attached to the Cterminus of ubiquitin. Such reporter proteins for detecting the reassociation of ubiquitin fragments include haemagglutinin (HA)tagged DHFR, [153] LexA-VP16, [159] RUra3p, [160] and Rgpt2, [161] whose release resultsi nas hift in Western blot by using anti-HA antibody, LacZ and HIS3 reporter genes activation, cell resistancet o5 -fluoroorotic acid, and cell resistance to hypoxan-thine/aminopterin/thymidine and sensitivityt o6 -thioguanine, respectively.T his methodh as been employedi nP PI analysis involving transcription factors and membrane proteins, which cannotb es tudied in conventional yeast two-hybrid system (see Section 4.2) . [162, 163] (3) PCA based on fluorescent proteins,a lso called bimolecular fluorescencec omplementation (BiFC), offers the advantage of trapping weak protein complexes, due to its irreversible chromophores formation, and enables direct visualization of PPIs at high spatialr esolution in any subcellular compartment in aw ide varietyo fc ell types and organisms. Recently,anew tripartite split-GFP associations ystem based on the association of three fragments of GFP,t wo short peptides each tagged to bait and prey,a nd at hird large detectorf ragment, wase stablished. Thism ethod enables the minimizationo fa ggregation and folding interference problem typicallyencountered in atraditional split-GFP assay with bulky and poorly folded fragments of GFP,a nd thus enables PPIs to be monitoredb oth in vivo and in vitro. [164] However,t he irreversibilityo fB iFC prevents dynamic analysis of complex dissociation and partner exchange. Furthermore, spontaneous association of fluorescent proteins independento fa ni nteraction between bait and prey can cause false-positive results. [165] (4) The split-luciferase assay utilizes luciferase as ar eporter protein to catalyze the oxidation of its substrate luciferina nd produce bioluminescence. Compared with irreversible fluorescence readout PCA, its reversibility allows the detectiono fk inetic and equilibrium aspects of the formation and disruption of PPIs [166] anda pplication in drugd iscoveryf or the HTS of chemicals that target as pecific PPI in living cells. [167] Such an assay has the advantage of ah igh signal-to-noise ratio due to low cellular background luminescence, however,t he inefficiency of the chemical reaction required to create excited-state luminescent substrates compared with the excitation of fluorescent proteins represents alimitation.

[179] [180] [181] [182] A broad variety of TAPt ags are available, such as Myc, FLAG, polyhistidine, HA, streptavidin-binding peptide (SBP), Strep II tag, and Streptococcus protein G( ProtG), to improve protein yields and recovery in mammalian or insect cells other than yeast. [183] Co-IP is ap opulart echnique to identify PPIs and has been used in thousands of experiments.I ts hares the fundamental principle of the antigen-antibody reaction, utilizing ab ait-specific antibody to precipitate the bait protein (i.e.,t he antigen) as well as its binding partners in the sample solution,f ollowed by MS or Western blot analysis ( Figure 2G ). [184] Both monoclonal and polyclonal antibodies can be used in co-IP and have their own advantages in different applications. Monoclonal antibodies recognize asingle epitope on antigen with highly specificity to decrease background noise and cross-reactivity.I n contrast, polyclonal antibodies recognize multiple epitopes, providing more robustd etectiona nd giving stronger signals. Considerable amounts of protein extract, typically1 00-1000 mg, are required for as tandard co-IP experiment, which might be unsuitable for cell culture assays conducted in a9 6well microtiter plate format or biopsies of tumor samples. Am icrosphere-basedc o-IP assay (mco-IP) was developed that employs only 5-10 mgo fp rotein extract. [185] As co-IP is performed with whole cell or tissue lysate under nondenatur-ing conditions, it reflects aphysiologicalassociation of endogenous proteins withouta ny artificial effects, such as overexpression or modification of the protein of interacts. However,i ti s not as sensitive as other affinity chromatography method, since the concentration of the antigen is much lower in itsnatural conditions. One solution involves the use of ac ross-linking strategy in which cells or tissues are treated with chemicalo r photoreactive cross-linkers to join interacting proteins covalently. [186] ELISA is ap late-based assay designed for detecting the presence of an antigen or an antibody in sample solution.I thas been widely applied asadiagnostic tool in medicals ciences, aq uality controli nv arious industries, as well as aq uantitative method for assessing PPIs at physiological conditions and screening for PPI inhibitors. [187] [188] [189] To measure aP PI in the direct ELISA format, the protein of interesti sn oncovalently coatedt oap olystyrene microwell plate throughp assivea dsorption. After washing away excess free protein, the remaining availableb inding surfaces of the wells are blocked with nonreacting protein such as bovine serum albumin( BSA). Then, the sample solution containing the binding partner protein is added and incubated in the wells to interactw ith the immobilized protein. After another washing step, ap rimary antibody against the binding partner protein with an attached enzyme, for example horseradish peroxidase (HRP) or alkaline phosphatase( AP), is applied as ad etection antibody.F inally, asubstrate for the enzyme is added, which elicits achromogenic or fluorescent signal upon enzymatic reaction. The amount of the binding partner protein boundt ot he immobilizedp rotein is quantified through absorbance-or fluorescence-based readout [190] (Figure 2H ). ELISA can also be performed in an indirect format in which the binding partner protein is detected by ap rimary antibody and an enzyme-linked secondary antibody,o ri nasandwich format in which the protein of interest is coated to the plate through ap re-coated \"capture\" antibody. ELISA exhibits superior sensitivity duet os ignal amplification through the enzymatic oxidation or hydrolysis of substrates to produce enhanced color or fluorescence. [191] However, the multiple incubation andw ashing steps needed in an ELISA are time consuming and can disrupt weak interactions (e.g., K d > 1 mm). [192] Proximity ligation assay (PLA) is an ovel technique developed for analyzing an endogenous protein via an amplifiable DNA reporter with high specificity and sensitivity. [193] It allows detection, quantification, and localization of PPIs in cells and tissues.I nt he latter case, ap air of proximity probes, consisting of antibodies or aptamers to whichs hort single-stranded DNA oligonucleotides have been attached, are designedt ob ind to their respective target proteins. Upon interaction between target proteins,a na dded oligonucleotide connecter can hybridize to both oligonucleotides of the proximity probes. New DNA strandsa re formed by joiningo ligonucleotide ends in ligation reactiona nd can be furthera mplified by real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for highly sensitive detection [194] [195] [196] (Figure 2I ). Alternatively,r olling circle amplification (RCA) can be employed to generate al ocalized amplification product that is further hybridized with fluorescence-la-ChemMedChem 2016, 11,738 -756 www.chemmedchem.org beled oligonucleotides. Hence,i nteractions of endogenous proteins,s erved as specific fluorescent dots, can be visualized and counted in situ with confocal microscopy. [197] [198] [199] This proximity ligation in situ assay (P-LISA) can also be performed in combination with flow cytometry,p roviding as tatistical approach of analyzingP PIs on asingle-cell basis. [200] P-LISA has advantages over other fluorescence-based methods, such as FRET,B RET,and BiFC. It allows detection of endogenous proteins in cellular context withoutb eing affected by overexpression. Besides, it provides powerful signal amplification via RCA because the protein complex becomes labelled by several hundred copieso ft he fluorophore. [197, 201] However, it should be noted that PLA only detects the proximity of proteins within ac ertain distance, typically up to af ew tens of nanometers, rather than physical molecular interactions.

Y2H is ap owerful technique for identifying and analyzing PPIs in vivo. However,asY 2H requires the translocation of the interacting proteins into the nucleus, it'snot suitable for membrane proteins or proteins localized in other subcellular compartment. Other unsuited proteins include transcriptional activators, which produce spontaneousa ctivation of the transcription of the reporter gene independento fb ait-prey interaction. Moreover, Y2H cannot detect PPIs involving post-translational modifications that do not take place in yeast.

Qing Li received her Master's degree in biochemistry and molecular biology in 2014 from the Shanghai Normal University (Shanghai, China). Since then, she has been working as aR esearch Associate in Prof. Renxiao Wang's group. Her research focuses on characterizing the biological activities of small molecules with cell-based assays. Prof. Renxiao Wang received both his B.S. degree (1994) and Ph.D. degree (1999) from Peking University (Beijing, China). Prof. Wang carried out his postdoctoral research at the University of California, Los Angeles (Los Angeles, USA) and Georgetown University (Washington, D.C.,USA), and also worked as aresearch investigator at the University of Michigan Medical School (Ann Arbor,U SA). In 2005, he joined the Shanghai Institute of Organic Chemistry as aprincipal investigator.H is main research interests involve understanding how small organic molecules regulate their biological targets through molecular modelling approaches. In 2012, Prof. Wang received the Corwin Hansch Award from the Cheminformatics and QSAR Society in recognition of his contributions to the field of computer-aided drug design.",
