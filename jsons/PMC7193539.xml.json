Briefly, volunteers with URTI were within 48 hours of symptom onset randomised to intervention (n = 32) or control (n = 34) arms. The intervention arm made hypertonic saline at home and performed HSNIG as many times as needed (maximum of 12 times/day). Control arm participants dealt with their URTI as they normally did. Nose swabs collected at recruitment and first thing in the morning on four consecutive days were sent to the laboratory for testing. Both arms kept a diary (which included the Wisconsin Upper Respiratory Symptom Survey-21 questionnaire) for a maximum of 14 days or until they were well for two consecutive days. Follow-up data were available for 92% of individuals (intervention arm: n = 30; control arm: n = 31). HSNIG reduced the duration of URTI by 1.9 days (P = 0.01), over-the-counter medication use by 36% (P = 0.004), transmission within household contacts by 35% (P = 0.006) and viral shedding by \u22650.5 log10/d (P = 0.04) in the intervention arm when compared to controls [2].",

Coronaviruses were the second most common cause of URTI (after rhinoviruses). Fifteen individuals were infected by a coronavirus: 7 in the intervention arm, 8 in the control arm. In the intervention arm, four participants were infected by an alphacoronavirus (HCoV 229E = 3, HCoV NL63 = 1) and three by a betacoronavirus (HCoV HKU1 = 3). In the control arm, two were infected by an alphacoronavirus (HCoV NL63 = 2) and six by a betacoronavirus (HCoV OC43 = 1, HCoV HKU1 = 5).
