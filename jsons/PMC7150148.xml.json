It was ranked as the first constraint for the modern development of virus databases, and the exponential increase in virus sequencing is worsening the situation. However, substantial progress has been made particularly in the last 20 years, both on the conceptual framework and practical implication of virus taxonomy. The International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV) is the only committee of the Virology Division, of the International Union of Microbiological Societies (IUMS), in charge of that task since 1966, for the international virology community. Virus Taxonomy Reports have been published regularly by ICTV and they became the reference in virus taxonomy and nomenclature. This article aims at providing some historical information about the establishment and changes in virus taxonomy and describes the current status of virus classification, nomenclature, and orthography.",

The question really is: \u201cHow can we classify viruses in such way that it makes sense and is useful to many scientists?\u201d The need for virus classification is not only supported by the common human need for organization, but also as a scientific tool to compare viruses and extrapolate useful information from one virus to another and from one family to another. Crucial biological information can be extrapolated directly from human viruses like picornaviruses to plant comoviruses and vice versa, when the classification indicates many structural and genomic common characteristics. When a newly discovered virus is assigned to a particular taxon, this virus can immediately be granted a number of a priori properties that only need confirmation and that have an immediate impact on specific virological studies. Furthermore, although it is not clearly stated by ICTV that the current classification is thought to reflect virus evolution, it is accepted that virus taxonomy is aiming at this objective and could become a tool by itself to study and evaluate virus evolution.",

The first system referred to pathogenic properties of animal and human viruses and to symptoms for plant viruses. For example, viruses sharing the pathogenic properties causing hepatitis (e.g., hepatitis A virus, hepatitis B virus, yellow fever virus, Rift Valley fever virus) were grouped together as \u2018the hepatitis viruses\u2019. In 1939, Holmes published a classification of plant viruses dependent on host reactions and differential host species using a binomial\u2013trinomial nomenclature based on the name of the infected plant. It was only in the 1950s, with the utilization of the electron microscope, that the first real virus classification was established. Naturally the shape and size of virus particles became major criteria for virus classification. Because of that powerful and rapid technology the number of newly discovered viruses increased rapidly and several hundreds of new viruses were listed in a short period of time.",

However, there has been much controversy on how to achieve this aim. Lwoff, Horne, and Tournier in 1962 proposed the adoption of a system classifying viruses into subphyla, classes, orders, suborders, and families. It was also proposed that the hierarchical classification would be based on the type of nucleic acid (DNA or RNA), the strandedness (single = ss or double = ds), the presence or absence of an envelope, the capsid symmetry, the type of replication cycle (with or without an RNA intermediate for DNA viruses), and the number of genome segments. This hierarchical classification system has never been recognized by the ICTV, but most of the criteria used to demarcate the major classes of viruses formed the basis of the universal taxonomy system now in place, and all published ICTV reports have used this scheme with only minor changes.",

The Adansonian system considers all available criteria at once and makes several classifications, taking the criteria successively into consideration. Criteria leading to the same classifications are considered correlated and are therefore not discriminatory. Subsequently, a subset of criteria is considered, and the process is repeated until all criteria can be ranked to provide the best discrimination of the species. Furthermore, qualitative and quantitative data can be simultaneously considered when building such a classification.

This subset of characters may change from one family to another according to the availability of the data and depending on the importance of a particular character for a particular family. Obviously, there is no homogeneity in this respect in the current virus classification system, and virologists weigh the criteria in a subjective process.

The first wave of descriptions, those before 1940, took into account mostly the visual symptoms of viral diseases along with modes of viral transmission. A second wave, between 1940 and 1970, brought together an enormous amount of information from studies of virion morphology (electron microscopy, structural data), biology (serology and virus properties), and physicochemical properties of viruses (nature and size of the genome, number and size of viral proteins). The impact of descriptions on virus classification has been particularly influenced by electron microscopy and the negative-staining technique for virions in the 1960s and 1970s. With this technique, viruses could be identified from poorly purified preparations of all tissue types and information about size, shape, structure, and symmetry could be quickly provided. As a result, virology progressed simultaneously for all viruses infecting animals, insects, plants, and bacteria. Since 1970, the virus descriptors list has included genome and replication information (sequence of genes, sequence of proteins), as well as molecular relationships with virus hosts.",

Genome sequence comparisons are becoming more and more prevalent in virus taxonomy as exemplified by the presence of a significant number of phylogenetic trees in the Eighth ICTV Report. Some scientists promote the concept of quantitative taxonomy, aimed at demonstrating that virus genome sequences contain all the coding information required for all the biological properties of the viruses. This is in complete agreement with the polythetic concept of virus species definition if one considers that the unique sequence of a genome contains in fact all the information of the virus to perform all the steps of its replication cycle with structural and nonstructural genes and all of its biological functions. A good example of quantitative taxonomy is the re-classification of flaviviruses from the genus Flavivirus in the family Togaviridae into the new family Flaviviridae based upon sequencing of the yellow fever virus genome and comparisons with the gene sequence arrangement of members of the genus Alphavirus in the family Togaviridae. Another recent example is the merging of the genera Rhinovirus and Enterovirus in the family Picornaviridae, based on the fact that phylogenetic trees and pairwise comparisons did not support the continued distinction between the two genera.",

In the Eighth Report of the ICTV, the \u2018List of Species\u2019 and the \u2018List of Tentative Species\u2019 are accompanied by a \u2018List of Species Demarcating Criteria\u2019 provided for each genus. Naturally, this list of criteria should follow the polythetic nature of the species definition, and more than one criterion should be used to determine a new species. It is obvious that most criteria are shared among the different genera, within and across families. These shared criteria include host range, serological relationships, vector transmission type, tissue tropism, genome rearrangement, and sequence homology (Table 3\n). However, while the nature of the criteria is similar, the levels of demarcation clearly differ from one family to another. This may reflect differences in appreciation from one family to another, but most likely reflects the differential ranking of a particular criterion in different families. The huge differences in sequence homologies (up to 30%) among lentivirus nucleoprotein sequences may not have the same biological significance as small differences for potyvirus capsid protein sequences (0\u201310%), and therefore universal levels of sequence identity for similar genes may not exist for viruses. However, it is important to note that the nature of the demarcating criteria at the genus level will probably not change since they have passed the test of years. Despite the fact that they were mostly established using biochemical and structural criteria, most of them have remained valid when correlated with genome organization and sequence data.",

In addition ICTV had created an additional category called \u2018Tentative Species Names\u2019 to accommodate viruses that seemed to belong to a new species, but did not have enough data to support this decision; it was also a way to \u2018reserve\u2019 a name already used in literature. In 2005, ICTV decided to replace this category by \u2018Unassigned Viruses\u2019 in the genus.",

Their recommendation was in fact withdrawn from ICTV nomenclature rules in 1990, and consequently, such names as Herpesvirus varicella or Polyomavirus hominis should not be used. For several years, plant virologists adopted a different nomenclature, using the vernacular name of a virus but replacing the word \u2018virus\u2019 by the genus name: for example, Cucumber mosaic cucumovirus and Tobacco mosaic tobamovirus. This system is called \u2018the nonlatinized binomial system\u2019, although the binomial order is the opposite of the typical latinized binomial system where the genus name ends with the virus name. Though this usage is favored by many scientists, and examples of such a practice can be found for human, animal, and insect viruses (e.g., Human rhinovirus, Canine calicivirus, and Acheta densovirus), it has not yet been adopted as a universal system by the ICTV; however, it has been decided that each study group would decide what is best for the viruses they deal with and the new names would have to be ratified through a formal taxonomic proposal by the ICTV.",

The major advantage of this definition is that it can accommodate the inherent variability of viruses and is not dependent on the existence of a unique set of characteristics. Members of a polythetic class are defined by more than one property and no single property is absolutely indispensable. Thus, in each family, it might be possible to determine the set of properties of the class \u2018species\u2019 and thus to verify if the family members are representatives of the class \u2018species\u2019 or if they belong to a different taxonomic level.",

Some genera have been moved from one family to another (or from one family to an unassigned genus status such as the genus Hepevirus) over the years, but the composition and description of these genera has remained very stable. The characters defining a genus are different from one family to another. The use of subgenera has been abandoned in current virus classification.",

            "text": "Genera are usually clustered in families, and most of the time, when a new genus, obviously not belonging to any existing family, is created, virologists also create a new family. Even after the creation of the ICTV, plant virologists have continued to classify plant viruses in \u2018groups\u2019, refusing to place them in genera and families. This position was mostly caused by a refusal to accept a binomial nomenclature. However, because of obvious similarities, plant reoviruses and rhabdoviruses had been integrated into the families Reoviridae and Rhabdoviridae (Table 1). Plant virologists subsequently accepted in 1995 the placing of plant viruses into species, genera, and families. The number of unassigned genera is regularly decreasing with time; the most recent clustering is the creation of the family Flexiviridae with the genera Potexvirus, Carlavirus, Mandarivirus, Foveavirus, Capillovirus, Allexivirus, Vitivirus, and Trichovirus. However, there are still 22 unassigned genera that do not belong to any family. Their presence originates mostly from the preference of plant virologists for accumulating data on virus species and genera before clustering genera in families. The unassigned genus status is now being used by animal virologists as a convenient temporary classification status. Examples are the unassigned genera Anellovirus, that is close to the family Circoviridae but different enough to be separated, the previously unassigned genus Cripavirus that has been upgraded to full family status (Dicistrovirida), and another unassigned genus Iflavirus that has been created to accommodate new picorna-like viruses that are not typical picornaviruses.",

To date only three orders have been accepted: Caudovirales, Mononegavirales, and Nidovirales. The first order, Mononegavirales, was established in 1990 and comprises the nonsegmented ssRNA negative-sense viruses, namely, the families Bornaviridae, Filoviridae, Paramyxoviridae, and Rhabdoviridae. This order was formed because of the great similarity between these families over many criteria, including their replication strategies. A second order, Caudovirales, contains all families of dsDNA phages possessing a tail, including the Myoviridae, Podoviridae, and Siphoviridae. The order Nidovirales comprises the families Coronaviridae, Arteriviridae, and Roniviridae and was created because it was clear that the viruses belonging to these families share many properties and yet are so different that they cannot be placed together in the same family. Many members of the ICTV advocate the creation of many more orders, and as a matter of fact four new orders encompassing the families Herpesviridae, Picornaviridae, Reoviridae, and Retroviridae have been proposed and provisionally named but it has been decided to proceed cautiously in this area so as to avoid creation of short-lived orders. The creation of formal taxa higher than the orders \u2013 for example kingdoms, classes, and subclasses \u2013 has not been considered by the ICTV.",
