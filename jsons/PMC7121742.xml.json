            "text": "Inhibition of biosynthesis of N-linked oligosaccharides, involving both glycosylation and glycoprotein processing, has been targeted as an antiviral approach for a number of decades. N-linked glycans are added to proteins at specific amino acid sequences, initially by addition of Glc3Man9GlcNAc2, where Glc is glucose, Man is mannose and GlcNAc is N-acetyl glucosamine (Fig. 20.1). Once this precursor oligosaccharide is transferred to a glycoprotein, the carbohydrate chain is subjected to a variety of processing reactions, including both removal and addition of sugar residues in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and Golgi to produce the typical high-mannose, hybrid, and complex types of oligosaccharides. Glycans play a specific role in glycoprotein folding through the calnexin/calreticulin cycle. \u03b1-glucosidase I (GluI) and \u03b1-glucosidase II (GluII) sequentially trim the terminal glucoses from the precursor oligosaccharide, resulting in the monoglucosylated Glc1Man9GlcNAc2 which is bound by calnexin [81]. Through interactions with various protein disulphide isomerases and other chaperones, the glycoprotein has the chance to fold correctly while being held in the ER, before progressing to the Golgi. The glycoprotein eventually plays a role in the viral life cycle or is incorporated into a new virion. These host cell glycosylation processes are required by viruses expressing glycoproteins as no virus has been identified to encode the enzymes required for biosynthesis of N-linked oligosaccharides. DENV possesses four N-linked glycoproteins: envelope, pre-membrane, non-structural protein 1 (NS1), and non-structural protein 4B.",

Replacement of the oxygen reduces iminosugar susceptibility to cleavage by glucosidases and allows derivatization at the nitrogen atom. Several iminosugars are inhibitors of cellular glycosidase enzymes in the N-linked glycan processing pathway. In 1982 deoxynojirimycin (DNJ) was first shown to inhibit the formation of complex glycans in Saccharomyces cerevisiae [66] by inhibiting the action of the ER GluI and GluII, the earliest enzymes in the N-glycan processing pathway (Fig. 20.1). Subsequently, their antiviral potential was realised when castanospermine and N-alkyl derivatives of DNJ were shown to inhibit HIV [28, 84].",

DENV E protein binds to BiP in infected cells and knockdown of BiP, calnexin or calreticulin resulted in reduced production of infectious virus, indicating that these chaperones all play a role in folding and assembly of dengue proteins [39]. Interestingly, both HSP90 [61] and BiP [34] have been proposed to act as attachment or entry receptors for DENV in certain cells. Despite this chaperone redundancy, ER \u03b1-glucosidase inhibitors were first shown to have antiviral effects on DENV by Courageot et al. [17] via a mechanism that did not affect viral protein synthesis, but appeared to reduce prME heterodimer formation and stability. They concluded that the formation of properly folded DENV envelope complexes requires a lectin chaperone pathway.",

These results, combined with encouraging pre-clinical pharmacology results and human safety data obtained from clinical trials of celgosivir against HIV and hepatitis C virus (HCV) [20, 35], where it had modest antiviral effects, supported a Phase 1b randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial in 50 adult dengue patients (CELADEN, NCT01619969). This trial recruited patients with a fever (\u226538 \u00b0C) for less than 48 h and dosed celgosivir at an initial 400 mg loading dose, followed by 200 mg every 12 h for a total of nine doses. While this study failed to show a decrease in fever duration or viral load [40, 76], the authors have subsequently investigated optimisation of dosing to give higher minimum concentrations [91] and will perform a Phase IIa clinical trial with four-times daily treatment (NCT02569827). In the first trial, a more rapid clearance of NS1 antigen was observed in patients treated with celgosivir compared to the placebo: an effect that was more prominent in patients with secondary dengue infection. They also highlighted the possibility of a therapeutic difference between patients with primary or secondary infections, indicating that future trials should be powered to investigate this.",

Furthermore, iminosugars have demonstrated promising in vivo results against influenza, Ebola, Marburg, dengue and woodchuck hepatitis (a model for hepatitis B) [8] viruses (Table 20.3). With respect to understanding mechanism of action, it is informative to ask what susceptible viruses have in common, and of equal interest to define what determines lack of susceptibility to iminosugars. Theoretically any virus that depends non-redundantly upon the calnexin/calreticulin pathway for glycoprotein folding would be sensitive to glucosidase inhibitors. This requires at least one N-linked glycan on a (viral, but in some cases host [98]) glycoprotein essential for viral infectivity. Interestingly, a single glycan can be sufficient to confer susceptibility to glucosidase inhibition, as is demonstrated in the case of the glycosylation sequon in the pre-S2 domain of M protein of hepatitis B [43]. However, currently it is not possible to predict which if any N-glycan may be utilized to engage with the calnexin cycle, and which proteins may depend on it for proper folding. The degree of N-glycosylation and number of disulphide bonds, the complexity of folding required for oligomerisation and co-translational cleavage events, amongst other factors, have been proposed to contribute to sensitivity to iminosugars. Ongoing and future studies will continue to elucidate the relationship between glucosidase inhibition and antiviral action.",

While research in the last decade has significantly progressed our understanding, the mechanism is not fully elucidated. Iminosugars are known to inhibit \u03b1-glucosidases, enzymes that trim terminal glucose residues from nascent glycoproteins in the ER, controlling interaction with the calnexin cycle and hence proper glycoprotein folding and transport. Evidence suggests that by preventing the appropriate folding of viral glycoproteins, iminosugars prevent the formation of infectious viral particles. How has our understanding of the mechanism/s of antiviral action of iminosugars progressed in the last decade? We shall put new findings into context within the field.",

            "text": "Experiments published in 2015 have clarified that treatment of DENV-infected cells with a range of iminosugars results in reduced secretion of DENV, rather than a reduction in virion infectivity [68, 89]. Iminosugars have demonstrated antiviral activity against all four serotypes of DENV [92] (Table 20.1) with IC50 values falling within a tenfold range across the four serotypes [51]. When supernatant from iminosugar-treated DENV-infected primary human macrophages is assayed for both infectious virus (by plaque assay) and total virus production (by qRT-PCR for DENV RNA), the levels of virus decrease concomitantly. This is consistent with ER \u03b1-glucosidase inhibition resulting in sufficient misfolding of viral glycoproteins such that they are targeted for degradation and there is reduced secretion of virus. However, reduced secretion is not the outcome of iminosugar treatment of all viruses. In the case of HIV, iminosugars affect infectivity to a greater degree than secretion: iminosugar treatment alters the glycosylation of gp120 resulting in only modest reductions in virus released from infected cells, but strongly impaired viral entry at a stage post CD4-binding [22, 23]. It is not possible to predict whether iminosugar treatment will result in reduced virion infectivity alone, or also in reduced secretion, and as such this has to be determined on a virus-by-virus basis [38]. The differential effects of iminosugars on secretion and infectivity seen with different viruses may also be compound or cell type specific, as in baby hamster kidney (BHK)-21 cells N-nonyl-DNJ (NN-DNJ) reduced DENV RNA replication in addition to effects on the DENV glycoproteins [94]. This is unlike observations for other, and related viruses, such as bovine viral diarrhoea virus (BVDV) [21] and HCV [75] where an absence of direct effect on RNA replication was shown. Additional research monitoring effects of iminosugars on DENV replication in relevant primary cells would be valuable to clarify the relative contributions of inhibition of viral RNA replication and glycoprotein folding on the overall antiviral effect observed.",

These children have no history of viral disease and despite substantial hypogammaglobulinemia, did not produce immune responses to live viral vaccines while still producing a normal response to protein, polysaccharide and conjugated protein-polysaccharide immunogens. Cells cultured from these children (shown to express GluII) were equally susceptible to infection with HIV in comparison to control cells; however virions produced were less infectious than those produced when the GluI gene was re-complemented back in. Displaying a similarly antiviral phenotype, but manifesting at the initial stage of cell infection, monocyte-derived macrophage cultures from each patient were either only very weakly or not productively infected with influenza virus (and less infectious virus was produced from these cells).

Generation of these specific FOS as the end products of protein misfolding gives a measure of both accessibility of iminosugars to the ER combined with their ER \u03b1-glucosidase inhibition activity. As a consequence of inhibition of ER GluII, a monoglucosylated glycoprotein is produced (Fig. 20.1). After trimming of the glycan precursor by mannosidases and recognition of the glycoprotein as terminally misfolded, Glc1Man4GlcNAc1 and Glc1Man6GlcNAc1 FOS species are cleaved from the peptide during ER-associated degradation (ERAD). In the case of inhibition of ER GluI, a similar process produces a Glc3Man5GlcNAc1 species. Thus, the presence of each species of FOS can be correlated with successful inhibition of the respective cellular \u03b1-glucosidase. Addition of 100 \u03bcM NB-DNJ, NN-DNJ, MON-DNJ or celgosivir to macrophages led to the generation of both mono- and tri-glucosylated FOS species, demonstrating inhibition of both \u03b1-glucosidases [68, 89]. When the degree of inhibition of just GluII (ie. generation of Glc1Man4GlcNAc1 FOS) is plotted against the antiviral activity for a range of iminosugar concentrations a clear correlation is observed between these two parameters (Fig. 20.2), consistent with GluII inhibition being sufficient to achieve an antiviral effect.",

Ideally, to confirm that blocking viral glycoprotein entry to the ER calnexin quality control cycle results in the formation of misfolded viral glycoproteins with subsequent antiviral effect, a demonstration that iminosugar treatment of DENV-infected cells results in misfolded DENV glycoprotein(s) would be important. The three studies that monitored the effects of iminosugars on DENV glycoprotein folding and secretion [17, 58, 94] are documented in Table 20.1. Castanospermine treatment of DENV-infected cells reduced levels of immunoprecipitated E to 15\u201330% compared to that from untreated cells, when a conformation-sensitive monoclonal antibody was used, and the amount of E co-precipitated with prM was about 25% of that from untreated cells, demonstrating that the iminosugar decreased formation of the prME heterodimer, and that inhibition of glucosidases affects the correct folding of DENV E in this system [17]. Such a study monitoring the effects of iminosugars on folding of DENV glycoproteins could be expanded utilizing larger panels of monoclonal antibodies which recognise both conformation-dependent and -independent epitopes to all four DENV glycoproteins. This has been performed for the heavily studied HIV gp120, for which many more validated reagents are available. Studies on the effects of NB-DNJ on gp120 folding demonstrated that interaction with the calnexin/calreticulin pathway was critical for correct folding of the V2 loop of HIV gp120, as blocked entry into this folding pathway resulted in conformation defects in this region [23]. A recent study took this observation a step further, assessing regional folding using monoclonal antibodies against conformational epitopes in combination with mathematical modelling, which showed that misfolding of only a portion of the gp120 was sufficient to produce an amplified effect on infectivity (S.G. Spiro, 2016, unpublished results). Additional studies that compare both the level of expression of DENV glycoproteins and their state of folding in the presence and absence of iminosugars, will clarify whether iminosugars can induce misfolding and degradation of DENV glycoproteins.",

By preventing the production of the monoglucosylated glycan it blocks glycoprotein binding to calnexin/calreticulin as has been described above and in Wu et al. [94]. Secondly, the retained terminal glucoses block access of \u03b1-mannosidase enzymes to the D1 arm of the glycan, theoretically preventing the formation of complex glycans. The hypothesis that glucosidase inhibitors may be antiviral due to the absence of complex sugars was the basis of the original studies on iminosugars and viruses in the 1980s. In cells with an active Golgi endomannosidase, this can be partially salvaged; however, the activity of endomannosidase is highly cell line dependent [21, 50, 75]. For example, BHK-21 cells and the human hepatoma cell line HepG2 express high levels of endomannosidase [37] while Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) and Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells have no detectable endomannosidase activity [63]. Production of DENV prM and NS1 with hyperglycosylated glycans has been demonstrated by mobility shift of the viral glycoprotein in electrophoresis [58, 92]. This has been confirmed by analysing glycan structures attached to specific glycoproteins for SARS coronavirus [62] and influenza virus [32] though not yet for DENV glycoproteins. Human cells have active endomannosidases so it is important that in vitro experiments into the effects of glucosidase inhibition use cell lines that express endomannosidase for relevance. It will be interesting to ascertain whether DENV glycoproteins produced in the presence of iminosugars bear triglucosylated glycans.",

Through a comparison of antiviral activity with inhibition of glycolipid processing using glucose and galactose analogues of iminosugars, we have recently shown that antiviral activity of iminosugars against DENV is a function of inhibition of glycoprotein processing rather than due to any effects on GCS [68, 89].",

While DENV infection alone induces and regulates UPR pathways in human monocytic cells [85], stimulating BiP and XBP-1 mRNA transcription, addition of celgosivir appeared to reduce downstream effector mechanisms of UPR pathways, as demonstrated by reduced phosphorylation of EIF2\u03b1 [58]. Celgosivir treatment, alone or in the presence of DENV, upregulated transcription of EDEM-1, an ER chaperone that promotes degradation of unfolded proteins, clearing the ER to reduce stress. Taken together, Vasudevan and colleagues suggest that DENV infection in the presence of celgosivir is characterised by reduced ER stress and enhanced survival. Modulation of the UPR induced in response to increased viral protein levels in the ER has been proposed as a therapeutic target [19, 26].",

Many host proteins vital for DENV attachment, uptake, signalling and the immune response are themselves N-linked glycoproteins and thus perturbations in their expression and function could have implications for virus growth. As with the effects of iminosugars on secretion of different viruses, their effects on host glycoproteins are predicted to be protein specific. Treatment with IHVR-17028, a DNJ-derivative, altered the N-linked glycan structure of angiotensin I-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) in a manner that did not affect its expression or binding to SARS-CoV spike glycoprotein but disrupted its ability to participate in virus envelope-triggered membrane fusion [98].

A number of possible explanations exist for this dichotomy but further experiments will need to be performed to determine their relative contributions. When viruses infect cells, their proteins are the predominant proteins being synthesised and hence may be more susceptible to inhibition of ER glucosidases. In addition, the DENV virion is comprised of a closely packed, repetitive and coordinated interaction of E and prM proteins which may increase virion susceptibility to any perturbation. Interestingly, in the case of HIV, very little protein misfolding is required to affect virion infectivity (S.G. Spiro, 2016, unpublished results). When the proportions of misfolded gp120 in the presence of NB-DNJ were modelled, HIV infectivity was shown to be highly sensitive to the misfolding of only a small proportion of total gp120, suggesting an amplification effect that may contribute to the selectivity of iminosugars against viruses over the host.",

The generally accepted antiviral mechanism of ER glucosidase inhibitors, that inhibition of GluI and/or GluII prevents the removal of the terminal glucose moieties on N-linked glycans and results in misfolding and retention of glycoproteins in the ER and ultimate degradation via ERAD is supported by a number of pieces of evidence. These include the observations that iminosugars induce the electrophoretic mobility shift of viral glycoproteins, as well as structural changes of N-linked glycans and measurement of FOS consistent with GluI and GluII inhibition correlating with antiviral effect. Substrate flux along the N-linked glycosylation pathway makes the correlation between key enzymes and an antiviral effect complex [3]. Though both GluI and GluII are targets of iminosugars, the slower removal of the third glucose residue by GluII, even though iminosugars bind approximately tenfold more avidly to GluI [2], is more sensitive to inhibition by iminosugars. As a result of inhibiting these enzymes, viral envelope glycoproteins cannot interact with ER chaperones such as calnexin and calreticulin, preventing correct glycoprotein folding, oligomerization and assembly of infectious virions.",

The use of panels of anti-DENV glycoprotein monoclonal antibodies with known specificity binding to DENV glycoproteins produced in the presence of iminosugars has the potential to enable mapping of regional iminosugar-induced misfolding, which may inform our understanding of, for example, E dimerization. The degree or location of misfolding may be protein dependent, potentially even down to strain-dependent differences. Use of iminosugars with galactose stereochemistry (DGJ compounds) has allowed the conclusion that the antiviral effect of piperidine iminosugars (monocylic iminosugars with an iminopyranose structure) against DENV observed in macrophages is not mediated by effects on enzymes of the glycolipid pathway. Development of selective ER \u03b1-glucosidase inhibitors would allow both confirmation that ER \u03b1-glucosidase inhibition (and not other enzymes) is responsible for the antiviral effect of iminosugars and avoidance of gastrointestinal side effects due to inhibition of intestinal glucosidases.

Following translocation of a newly transcribed peptide into the ER, a preassembled precursor oligosaccharide, consisting of 3 glucose (Glc), 9 mannose (Man) and 2 N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) residues (Glc3Man9GLcNAc2) is transferred to the nascent polypeptide. Stepwise removal of first the outer \u03b11,2-linked glucose residue by \u03b1-glucosidase I (GluI), then the next two \u03b11,3-linked glucose residues by \u03b1-glucosidase II (GluII) occurs. The lectin chaperones calnexin and calreticulin can bind to the monoglucosylated oligosaccharide intermediate (Glc1Man9GLcNAc2) to slow glycoprotein progression through the ER and allow for correct folding. UDP-glucose glycoprotein:glycoslytransferase (UGGT) detects misfolded proteins and reglucosylates the oligosaccharides to allow for repeated interaction with calnexin and other folding chaperones and enzymes (calnexin cycle). Correctly folded proteins can bud from the ER for transport to the Golgi and further processing, or alternatively undergo additional processing by ER degradation-enhancing \u03b1-mannosidase I\u2013like protein (EDEM) and other ER mannosidases to be targeted for degradation. Free oligosaccharides (FOS) are generated during protein N-glycosylation in mammalian cells and specific species can be detected by HPLC in cell lysates. For example, inhibition of GluII results in a monoglucosylated glycoprotein. After trimming of the glycan precursor by mannosidases and recognition of the glycoprotein as terminally misfolded, a Glc1Man4GlcNAc1 FOS species is cleaved from the peptide during ER-associated degradation (ERAD).
