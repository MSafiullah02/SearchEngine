For example, expression of CXCR3, the receptor for the chemokines CXCL9 and CXCL10, enables movement of CD8+ effector T cells toward infectious foci4, 5. In other contexts, for example in inflamed brain, skin and in tumors, T cells follow structural guidance cues, such as extracellular matrix fibres and the vasculature7\u201312. In the skin, such \u2018\u2018contact guidance\u2019\u2019 of T cells is mediated by integrins10, whereas in tumors integrin-independent contact guidance has been identified11. In the absence of integrin-mediated adhesion, T cells may utilize three-dimensional migration strategies and squeeze through pre-formed channels using \u2018\u2018amoeboid\u2019\u2019 motion along a path of least resistance13. In vitro experiments of various cell-types, including T cells, indicate that the cell-intrinsic RhoA-ROCK-myosin II pathway, a regulator of the actomyosin cytoskeleton, enables amoeboid squeezing14\u201316. Two-photon studies have confirmed that inhibition of ROCK or myosin II leads to a moderate reduction of the speed of naive T cells in the lymph node14, 17. Nevertheless, the relevance of ROCK during effector T cell migration in inflammatory tissues has not been addressed formally. It also needs to be considered that in some cases, such as in the pancreas of diabetic mice, cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL) migrate with apparent randomness, independent of environmental guidance cues18, 19.",

Data also indicate that effector T cells contribute actively to the progression and resolution of acute lung injury22, 23. In particular, experimental and clinical studies have established a link between lung injury and the accumulation of resident CD8+ T cells24\u201327. Even though it is likely that efficient lung tissue-infiltration by CD8+ T cells is important during pathogenesis, interstitial T cell migration during acute lung injury is barely investigated. Although two-photon studies have shown that lung-infiltrating T cells perform active interstitial migration during infection and asthma, we know very little about the molecular mechanisms that enable tissue-navigation of lung-infiltrating T cells28\u201331.

We find that CD8+ effector T cells extravasate effectively into the interstitial lung space and then show intermittent motion, switching between confinement and straight migration. Movement along lung-associated vasculature facilitates straight motion. Chemokines fine-tune the speed of lung-infiltrating T cells, but have a marginal effect on intermittent migration. ROCK on the other hand is crucial for T cells to achieve high speeds and straight migration. These data suggest that environmental and cell-intrinsic signals cooperate to enable effective contact-guided tissue-navigation of T cells during acute lung injury.",

To quantify the percentage of T cells that have reached the interstitial space of the lung, we used a well-established method where intravascular T cells are labeled via intravenous injection of an anti-CD3 antibody shortly before organ harvest, followed by flow cytometry analysis of digested lungs33. Analysis of peripheral lymph nodes, where T cells are segregated from the vasculature, revealed that most adoptively transferred GFP+ T cells were negative for the intravascular CD3 stain (CD3\u2212), which indicated that they were extravascular (Fig. 1a, left panel). In lungs from healthy control mice, adoptively transferred effector T cells were mostly CD3+, i.e., intravascular, indicating that these cells reach the lung vasculature, yet fail to enter the interstitial space (Fig. 1a, middle panel). In contrast, analysis of lungs from mice that received intranasal LPS revealed that the majority of transferred effector CD8+ T cells were CD3\u2212, i.e., extravascular (Fig. 1a, right panel). Staining with an anti-CD8 antibody confirmed that typically >90% of adoptively transferred cells were CD8+ (Fig. 1a). Using immunofluorescence, we found that most adoptively transferred GFP+ T cells were solitary in healthy control lungs, but after treatment with LPS, regions with high T cell density emerged (Fig. 1b, middle and right panels). Consistent with flow cytometry, most T cells in inflamed lungs were negative for intravascular CD3 stain (Fig. 1b, left and right panels). We then combined intravascular antibody staining with intranasal injection of an anti-CD45 antibody, as reported previously34, which revealed that ~ 80% of the adoptively transferred T cells were protected from staining with either antibody (Fig. 1c). The fact that most adoptively transferred T cells were spatially segregated from the vasculature and airways confirmed that during acute lung injury, the majority of effector CD8+ T cells reside in the interstitial lung space.\n",

This is similar to speeds reported for T cell motility in peripheral sites, including skin, brain and lungs, but slower than the speed seen in lymph nodes4, 12, 31, 35\u201337. In the 15 min time window, we saw that a significant proportion of T cells showed no movement (0\u20131 \u00b5m min\u22121) while others moved at speeds of >7 \u00b5m min\u22121. T cells moved with an even greater range of speeds when we determined the \u2018\u2018instant\u2019\u2019 frame-to-frame speeds (90 s). A higher fraction of T cells showed no movement and some cells displayed speeds close to 10 \u00b5m min\u22121 (Fig. 2a, pink bars). Conversely, at much longer time periods of up to 2 h, we found that T cell speeds were more homogenous, with most T cells moving between 2 and 4 \u00b5m min\u22121 (Fig. 2a, blue dotted line). This suggested that lung-infiltrating T cells switch repetitively between fast and slow migration, reminiscent of previous reports of T cells in lymph nodes and infected brain37, 38.\n",

This was further supported by speed autocorrelation analysis, which revealed a positive correlation for up to several minutes (Fig. 2c). We then plotted the relationship between time and mean squared displacement (MSD). The relationship was roughly linear, and the slope of the curve, estimated by linear regression, revealed a motility coefficient of 6.45 \u00b5m2 min\u22121 (Fig. 2d). This motility coefficient is similar to that of memory T cells in the skin but significantly below observations of naive T cells in lymph nodes15, 39, 40, suggesting that the lung-environment is not particularly conducive to effective tissue-navigation. Taken together, we concluded that lung-infiltrating T cells display an intermittent migration pattern, characterized by repetitive inter-conversion between fast and slow migration.",

We found that the Rayleigh distribution, which describes two-dimensional displacements of Brownian motion, was a poor fit for the experimental T cell speeds due to a major underrepresentation of low and high speeds (Fig. 3a, dashed black line). Conversely the best fit for power-law distributions, characteristic of superdiffusive Levy walks, showed a severe overrepresentation of low and high speeds (Fig. 3a, dash-pointed blue line). We then focused on the log-normal distribution, which we previously demonstrated as an appropriate model for the T cell speeds in lymph nodes36. We found that the best fit for a log-normal distribution led to a better recapitulation of experimental speeds (Fig. 3a, dotted green line; Supplementary Table 1). However, the log-normal distribution failed to represent a small population of T cells with very high speeds (7.5 to 10 \u00b5m min\u22121), reflected by the region to the right of the intersection of the log-normal distribution and the experimental CDF (Fig. 3a). Thus, curve fitting of speeds led to the identification of a small but significant subpopulation of T cells moving at high speeds. Altogether, these data showed that effector T cells in the lung do not move with Brownian or super-diffusive Levy walk strategies.\n",

To corroborate this finding, we calculated for each experimental and randomized track a straightness Z-score. This score measured how many standard deviations the given displacement deviated from the expected displacement of a randomized track ensemble (Supplementary Fig. 1). Comparison of the straightness Z-scores from experimental and randomized tracks revealed that experimental tracks were enriched for low (confined) and high (straight) straightness Z-scores (Fig. 4c).

Subtracks with Z-scores below \u22121.7 were defined as confined and subtracks with Z-scores above 1.7 as straight, because only very few randomized tracks had such extreme values (Fig. 4c). Virtually all tracks contained some random subtracks. Strikingly, 16% of the tracks contained a significant number of confined subtracks and 39% of the tracks contained a significant number of straight subtracks. Moreover, 26% of tracks contained both straight and confined subtracks (Fig. 4f). In control tracks, where all subtracks were randomized, fewer than 10% of source tracks contained a significant number of straight or confined subtracks (Supplementary Fig. 2).

Briefly, we captured the migration of lung-infiltrating T cells as described above using two-photon microscopy with our imaging model of acute lung injury (\u2018\u2018before PTX\u2019\u2019). We then added PTX directly to the superfused medium. After incubating the lungs for 2 h to ensure effective PTX inhibition, we measured T cell migration again (\u2018\u2018after PTX\u2019\u2019). Migration before and after treatment was measured in identical imaging regions, which excluded a confounding influence due to environmental heterogeneity. Analysis of average track speeds revealed a significant reduction after treatment with PTX, similar to previous observations in lung tumors and infected brain11, 38 (median speeds: before treatment: 2.4 \u00b5m min\u22121; after treatment: 2.0 \u00b5m min\u22121; Fig. 6a; Supplementary Movie 9). Consistent with the reduction in speed, time vs. mean squared displacement measurements revealed that PTX-treatment also reduced rate of tissue infiltration by lung-infiltrating T cells by 50% (Fig. 6b; motility coefficients: before treatment: 6.80 \u00b5m2 min\u22121; after treatment: 3.59 \u00b5m2 min\u22121). Interestingly, when we analyzed T cell tracks for directional persistence using the straightness Z-score as previously described, PTX-treatment did not lead to significant changes (Fig. 6c). This suggested that while chemokines deposited within lung tissues can regulate T cell speed, intra-tissue chemokine gradients were dispensable for the intermittent migration of lung-infiltrating T cells. This was corroborated by in vitro experiments, where PTX inhibited spontaneous T cell migration through transwells even when no external chemokine gradients were generated (Supplementary Fig. 4a). Moreover, chemokines CXCL10, CCL21, and CXCL12 all induced migration (Supplementary Fig. 4b).\n",

We also found that in vitro, chemokines can induce ERK and RhoA-ROCK signaling pathways in CTL (Supplementary Fig. 4c, d), as shown previously for other cell types17, 46\u201348. We then tested whether ROCK promotes migration of effector T cells within the inflamed lung environment. To this end, we used our two-photon imaging model of acute lung injury and tracked lung-infiltrating T cells before and after addition of the ROCK inhibitor Y-27632. The ROCK inhibitor strongly reduced the average track speed of lung-infiltrating T cells (median speeds: before treatment: 2.5 \u00b5m min\u22121; after treatment: 0.8 \u00b5m min\u22121; Fig. 7a; Supplementary Movie 10). ROCK inhibition also led to a massive reduction of the motility coefficient, as determined by time vs. MSD analysis (Fig. 7b; motility coefficient: before treatment: 7.08 \u00b5m2 min\u22121; after treatment: 1.65 \u00b5m2 min\u22121). Importantly, the ROCK inhibitor also led to a significant reduction of the straightness of analyzed tracks (Fig. 7c). Notably, inhibition of ROCK impaired migration of lung-infiltrating T cells more strongly than inhibition of chemokine signaling (compare Fig. 6 with Fig. 7), suggesting that ROCK-activity is only partially dependent on chemokine-dependent G\u03b1i signaling. This was confirmed in vitro, where treatment with the ROCK-inhibitor Y-27632 reduced spontaneous transwell migration much more strongly than PTX (Supplementary Fig. 4a). These results showed that ROCK-dependent cytoskeletal remodeling is a major requirement for switching between fast and directionally persistent migration of lung-infiltrating T cells during acute lung injury.\n",

This analysis revealed that T cells that moved straight with a constant speed of 6 \u00b5m min\u22121 rapidly engaged in brief contacts with the majority of target cells (50% were contacted after half an hour; Fig. 8a).

Analysis of the maximum continuous contact of each target cell with a T cell revealed that in the straight T cell group only short contacts were established (Fig. 8b; blue dashed line). In the confined group, many targets established no contacts at all, also leading to short contact durations (Fig. 8b; red dotted line). In contrast, intermittent migration led to an enrichment of longer-lasting contacts between 10 and 100 min (Fig. 8b; black solid line). Time-course analysis for different observation periods confirmed this result. Median contact duration remained below 6 min for straight and confined T cells, whereas the contact duration of intermittent T cells increased continuously (Fig. 8c). These results demonstrated that intermittent T cell migration can allow target identification in space while also enhancing the duration of continuous contact times between T cells and target cells.",

In the present study, we provide novel insights into the molecular mechanisms that regulate T cell motility within the interstitial space of inflamed lungs using a mouse model of acute lung injury. We find that T cells display an intermittent migration pattern, characterized by transitions between confinement and straight relocation. The directionality of T cells is not random but partially aligned with the architecture of the lung tissue. Mechanistically, the RhoA-ROCK-myosin II signaling pathway enabled high-speed straight migration of lung-infiltrating T cells. Computational studies provided proof-of-principle that intermittent migration balances the need for spatial coverage as well as the establishment of long-lasting contacts between T cells and target cells.",

The generation of such long observation periods is crucial because shorter timescales gave the misleading impression that the T cell population is heterogeneous and composed of a subset of cells that do not move at all while other cells move with high speed and directional persistence (Fig. 2). Longer movies suggest that in fact individual T cells switched between periods of confinement, lasting typically tens of minutes up to hours, and ballistic relocation.",

In another study, intermittent T cell migration in infected brain was supported by good fits between empirical data and computer simulations, but direct observation of intermittent migration was lacking38.

Our computational model suggests that intermittent migration includes both periods of ballistic relocation leading to increased target identification while periodic confinement promotes more intimate and longer-lasting contacts with target cells. This could be important because some estimates have suggested that full T cell activation may require up to 10 min of contact, depending on peptide affinity and amount55. Moreover, CTLs are relatively inefficient at killing individual target cells in vivo, and cumulative contacts of 10\u201360 min have been shown to occur before target cell lysis49. Intermittent migration may balance the need to search a large area such as inflamed lung tissue while also allowing for long lasting contacts leading to CD8 T cell activation and lytic function.",

While several recent studies have reported imaging of T cell migration within live lung tissue, the mechanisms that regulate migration of T cells infiltrating the lung parenchyma have remained essentially uninvestigated28\u201331. Chemokines are well-established promoters of recruitment of T cells to the lung and other tissues56. In contrast, the mechanisms that influence chemokine-dependent migration of T cells within the interstitial space of diverse tissues are more complex and cannot simply be explained by motility along pre-formed chemokine gradients. For example, while track analysis of T cells in the skin was consistent with chemotaxis4, 5, the bias was very subtle and only detectable with sophisticated analytical tools5. In the brain, inhibition of chemokine receptor-dependent G\u03b1i-type G protein signaling with PTX reduced speed of CTL by <50% but did not change motility qualitatively38. Similarly, PTX reduced the motility coefficient of T cells in lung tumors by 50%11. Here, we report that treatment with PTX has a similar effect on the motility of CTL within inflamed lungs: motility coefficients went down by 50%, but only a marginal effect on the intermittent mode of migration was observed as PTX-inhibited T cells still showed both confined and directionally persistent migration. While we still do not know a precise mechanism for ROCK activation by chemokines in vivo, our results suggest that chemokines are not required for the straight migration of T cells in the lungs, which is distinct to guidance by chemokine trails in the trachea of influenza-infected animals42.",

Indeed, inhibition of ROCK led to a massive reduction of both speed and directional persistence of lung-infiltrating T cells. It is striking that inhibition of the ROCK-pathway leads to a more pronounced reduction of migration than inhibition of chemokine-dependent G\u03b1i signaling.

In the present study, we show that the ROCK pathway plays a crucial role for T cell migration within inflamed lung, extending previous observations that this pathway promotes migration of naive T cells in the lymph node17.

In fact, targeting of the ROCK pathway is an emerging treatment option for glaucoma59.

Mice were anesthetized with 310 mg kg\u22121 of Avertin given i.p. and intubated orotracheally with a 20G angiocatheter. Following intubation, mice were ventilated using a MiniVent Ventilator (Model 845, Harvard apparatus) with oxygen and 1.5% isoflurane at a rate of 200 breaths per minute and with a tidal volume of 10 \u00b5l per gram body weight (typically 200 \u00b5l for a 20 g mouse). If the mouse showed any signs of spontaneous breathing it was given a supplemental \u00bd dose of Avertin before surgery. The lung was exposed through a left thoracotomy and the dorsal surface of the left lobe (~ 1/3 of the lobe) was attached to a thin flexible plastic support using a thin film of VetBond. The mouse is placed on the lower plate of a custom built chamber and the upper plate of the chamber is assembled and lowered over the exposed left lung. The plastic support attached to the bottom of the lung is carefully lifted to bring the lung into contact with the cover glass lining the bottom of the upper chamber plate and the plastic support secured with a hair-pin. The mouse is maintained at 37 \u00b0C by warming both upper and lower plates using a Warner TC-344C Dual Channel Temperature Controller (Warner Instruments). Anesthesia is maintained with 1.5\u20132% isoflurane during imaging. Mice are imaged for up to 4 h and given supplemental fluids (150 \u00b5l saline s.c.) for any experiment lasting more than 1.5 h. The imaging procedure is terminal and at the end of the experiment anesthesia is increased to 3% isoflurane and mice are euthanized by cervical dislocation while deeply anesthetized. The upper chamber is filled with water and video-rate and time-lapse imaging were performed with a custom built two-photon microscope equipped with a 1.0 NA 20\u00d7 water dipping objective (Olympus) running ImageWarp acquisition software (A&B Software) as previously described61, 62. Tissue perfusion was verified after the imaging preparation was completed by evaluating superficial pulmonary capillaries under bright field and by injecting 655 nm Q-dots (ThermoFisher) and performing video-rate imaging to confirm robust pulmonary vessel flow. Chameleon Vision II Ti:Sapphire laser (Coherent) tuned to 910 nm was used to excite fluorescence and emission detected by PMTs using 495 nm and 560 nm dichroic filters: Blue (<495 nm, SHG collagen), green (495\u2013560 nm, eGFP), and red (>560 nm, 655 nm Q-dots). Auto fluorescence of alveolar macrophages appears as mix of color (495\u2013600 nm) and thus can be discriminated from the eGFP signal. For time-lapse imaging, we acquired a 300 \u00d7 340 \u00d7 75 \u00b5m volume as 31 sequential 2.5 \u00b5m z-steps with a time resolution of approximately 25 s. For video-rate imaging, we acquired a 300 \u00d7 340 \u00b5m field at ~ 40 ms frame\u22121 time resolution for 500 continuous frames. X-Y resolution was 0.75 \u00b5m pixel\u22121, which resolved individual cells and small capillaries. Multi-dimensional data sets were analyzed with MatLab.",

Initially, the region was populated randomly with 200 T cells of 10 \u00d7 10 \u00b5m2 size (no overlap between different T cells was allowed) and analogously with 200 target cells. Target cells were stationary. For each T cell, a trajectory was created that contained 1000 positions, separated by time-steps of 90 s duration. The specifics of how these trajectories were generated depended on the type of migration that was simulated, i.e., straight, confined, and intermittent. Straight T cells moved with a constant speed of 6 \u00b5m min\u22121 and obtained a random orientation that they maintained throughout the simulation. The trajectories of the confined cells were based on experimentally obtained T cell tracks. Briefly, all tracks were split into subtracks with a duration of 20 timesteps and these subtracks were filtered so that only confined subtracks (straightness Z-score < 1.5) remained. For each simulated T cell, these tracks were stitched together randomly so that tracks of sufficient duration (>=1000 timesteps) were obtained. Tracks for intermittent migration were obtained directly from experimental data. For each simulated T cell, experimental tracks of 2 h duration were stitched together randomly. When a T cell moved out of the field of view, it was randomly re-positioned within the field of view. Contacts between T cells and target cells were registered whenever T cells and target cells shared overlapping pixels.",
