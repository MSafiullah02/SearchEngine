            "text": "Zoonotic diseases cause a considerable burden of illness in humans (Taylor et al., 2001; Woolhouse and Gowtage\u2010Sequeria, 2005). Past zoonotic outbreaks of significant impact in North America include West Nile virus, SARS, H1N1 influenza and Lyme disease (Borgundvaag et al., 2004; Bacon et al., 2008; Kermode\u2010Scott, 2009; Lindsey et al., 2010). The current Ebola virus outbreak in West Africa is an example of how diseases of zoonotic origin can pose an international threat requiring immediate response in affected countries and emergency preparedness in unaffected countries (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2014; Public Health Agency of Canada, 2014; World Health Organization, 2014). For response efforts to occur in a timely manner, diseases should already be identified as high priority with preventative measures in place at the regional and national level. Zoonotic diseases pose an additional threat because the natural reservoirs are often animals, particularly wildlife, thus eluding control efforts such as quarantine, vaccination and social distancing. With limited resources available, it is necessary to prioritize diseases in order to allocate resources to those posing the greatest public health threat. Many studies have attempted to prioritize communicable diseases (Rushdy and O'Mahony, 1998; Doherty, 2000, 2006; Horby et al., 2001; World Health Organization, 2003; Krause et al., 2008a; Balabanova et al., 2011; Cox et al., 2013), zoonotic diseases (Institut de Veille Sanitaire, 2002, 2010; Cardoen et al., 2009; Havelaar et al., 2010; Humblet et al., 2012) and animal diseases (Del Rio Vilas et al., 2013; Brookes et al., 2014a,b). Numerous challenges have been identified; these include the difficulty in comparing multiple diseases that vary greatly in health outcomes and socio\u2010economic impact in humans and animals (Pan American Health Organization, 2003; Heymann, 2008); the multiple stakeholders involved who have their own objectives and opinions; and the various prioritization methodologies that have been developed to date but a lack of agreement on best practices (Krause et al., 2008a,b; Gilsdorf and Krause, 2011). One of the main technical challenges for the lack of agreement on which prioritization method to use has been the process of deriving scores and weights to mathematically quantify the disease criteria used to evaluate diseases. Earlier studies used simplified linear scores applied to disease criteria separately (Rushdy and O'Mahony, 1998; Doherty, 2000, 2006; Horby et al., 2001; World Health Organization, 2003) or experts to derive subjective weights that are then applied to disease criteria separately (Krause et al., 2008a,b; Cardoen et al., 2009; Balabanova et al., 2011; Humblet et al., 2012; Cox et al., 2013). These simplified approaches introduce subjective bias into the prioritization exercise and make the assumption that disease criteria are independent, which they are not. Recent studies have utilized various quantitative approaches to address these limitations (Havelaar et al., 2010; Del Rio Vilas et al., 2013; Brookes et al., 2014a,b).",

            "text": "Our study used a quantitative approach, conjoint analysis (CA), to overcome these limitations. CA is a technique developed for market research to explore consumer preferences (Green and Srinivasan, 1978). However, CA has been gaining widespread use over the last decade for eliciting preferences in the healthcare setting (Ryan and Farrar, 2000; Mele, 2008; Sampietro\u2010Colom et al., 2008; Bridges et al., 2011). The theory behind CA is that a product can be described by a set of characteristics and that the extent to which an individual values a product is determined by the level of each characteristic and the combination of those levels of characteristics together (Ryan and Farrar, 2000; Mele, 2008; Orme, 2010). A CA study presents individuals with multiple competing products, each containing desirable and undesirable characteristics and forces the individual to state a preference, usually by selecting one product over the others. In doing so, the value of each characteristic, relative to each other, is revealed through the choice data. We used CA for the prioritization of zoonoses by treating diseases as products and describing each disease as a set of disease criteria (characteristics) (Ng and Sargeant, 2012a, 2013). Because relative weighted scores for each disease criterion and their corresponding levels were derived from the choice data, we overcome the problem of subjective bias in disease criteria scores and weights and acknowledged that characteristics are not independent. Additional benefits for using CA included presenting individuals with a set of disease criteria without identifying diseases, thus eliminating biases associated with disease names and forcing individuals to prioritize solely on scientific knowledge. Further, because individuals are presented with all the information about the diseases to consider for prioritization, CA allows for widespread participation rather than a limited group of experts (Ng and Sargeant, 2012a, 2013).",

To summarize, six focus groups identified 21 criteria for disease prioritization (Ng and Sargeant, 2012b), and 62 zoonotic and enteric diseases were selected on the basis of their public health importance (Ng and Sargeant, 2012a). Diseases were further divided into separate syndromes, for example acute/chronic phases and latent/active phases; 117 separate disease syndromes were identified from the 62 diseases, and proportions for each syndrome within a given disease were assigned according to the literature. For each criterion for each disease syndrome, a literature search was conducted comprising reference textbooks, peer\u2010reviewed publications and websites (Ng and Sargeant, 2012a). Criterion levels were then defined according to the range reported in the literature with three or four levels assigned to each criterion. A partial\u2010profile choice\u2010based conjoint (CBC) study was developed comprising 14 choice task sets (Patterson and Chrzan, 2003; Chrazn, 2010); each choice task contained five disease scenarios and each scenario contained five disease criteria (Fig. 1). Disease criteria were rotated throughout the survey using an orthogonal experiment design, and criteria and levels were varied between choice tasks. The ordering of disease criteria within a choice task was randomized. In addition, two fixed choice tasks were included to test the reliability of responses; these choice tasks were designed to identify respondents who did not understand the choice task process or fatigued responders.1 Fixed choice tasks were also randomized to reduce ordering bias. For each choice task, respondents were asked to select one disease to prioritize for their control and prevention in Canada or the United States. A total of 300 survey versions containing 14 choice task sets and two fixed choice task sets were created using Sawtooth Software CBC module v7 (Sawtooth Software, 2012b), each version contained an efficient experimental design utilizing a balance overlap approach (Sawtooth Software, 2008). Sawtooth Software SSI Web v7 was used to randomly assign survey version to study participants (Sawtooth Software, 2012a). Participants could choose to complete the survey in English, French or Spanish.",

The program utilizes hierarchical Bayes (HB) theorem combining a Markov chain Monte Carlo procedure with the Metropolis/Hasting algorithm to iteratively update the parameter estimates from an upper\u2010level prior model to a lower\u2010level posterior model (Sawtooth Software, 2009). The prior model represents the study population; the HB algorithm estimates the average parameters for the population before using respondent's individual\u2010level data to determine how each respondent differs from the population mean. The algorithm adjusts each respondent's parameter estimates (posterior model) so that they reflect an optimal mix of the population mean and the individual's choices. The optimal model is dependent on the quality of data provided by each respondent (posterior) and the variance in the population mean (prior); the greater the population variance, the less Bayesian correction is applied to the mean so that individuals are allowed to vary in their choices and their parameter estimates provide better fit to their individual\u2010level responses (Howell, 2009). A total of 30 000 preliminary iterations were computed for model convergence, and an additional 30 000 iterations were computed for parameter estimation. Percentage certainty and root likelihood (RLH) goodness\u2010of\u2010fit measures were calculated to determine how well the final model fit was in comparison with a chance model and a perfect model. A chance model has a percentage certainty fit of 0%, and a perfect model has a percentage certainty fit of 100% (Sawtooth Software, 2009). The expected RLH for a chance model is determined by how many scenarios are presented per choice task set; the RLH for a chance model in this study was 0.2 (one divided by five disease scenarios per task), and the expected RLH for a perfect model was 1. (Sawtooth Software, 2009). The final parameter estimates, referred to as part\u2010worth utilities (\u03b2), for each criterion level were converted to zero\u2010centred standardized utility values by setting the average range of parameter values across all disease criteria to 100.",

Scores for each disease syndrome were calculated as the summation of part\u2010worth utilities matching criterion levels that were assigned to the corresponding disease syndrome. Scores were then summed up in proportion to the frequency of each syndrome within a disease to derive an overall score for each disease. The overall scores were used to rank diseases from highest priority (highest score) to lowest priority (lowest score). Because part\u2010worth utilities represent interval data, overall scores cannot be compared between groups; instead, disease ranks were compared as a measure of proximal agreement or disagreement in prioritization between groups. Importance scores can be derived from part\u2010worth utilities to estimate the influence the combined levels for each disease criterion had on the decision to prioritize. Importance scores are calculated as a percentage for each respondent; for each disease criterion, the difference in range between the highest and lowest part\u2010worth utility is divided by the sum of all part\u2010worth utility ranges across all 21 disease criteria. The larger the difference between the levels within a criterion, the higher the importance score and thus, the stronger the influence the criterion had on the decision to prioritize (Orme, 2010).",

A significantly higher proportion of AHP in Canada were from Alberta (13.8% versus 8.2%), Prince Edward Island (3.3% versus 0.3%) and Saskatchewan (9.2% versus 2.4%), likely due to the presence of veterinary colleges in these provinces and thus an indication of the distribution of AHP across Canada. A significantly higher proportion of HHP in Canada were from Ontario (52.4% versus 43.1%) and Quebec (13.4% versus 9.2%), similarly likely due to the presence of multiple medical schools in these provinces and the corresponding job market. Similar trends were observed in the United States. Human health professionals were more likely to hold a Bachelor's degree (19.8% versus 7.2%) or Master's degree (25.1% versus 6.2%), while AHP were more likely to hold a professional degree (59.2% versus 33.1%) or doctorate degree (23.8% versus 17.1%). This may represent the various paths through which HHP enter their professions compared to AHP. The majority of AHP in both countries were veterinarians or working in veterinary sciences (69.7%) or as epidemiologists (7.9%), but HHP represented a mix of disciplines including physicians or medical sciences (29.9%), public health practitioners (29.0%), epidemiologists (15.6%), nurses (7.0%) and infectious disease researchers (6.9%).

            "text": "Both groups considered rabies to be the most important zoonoses to prioritize while Dengue fever, La Crosse encephalitis and St. Louis encephalitis were the least important (Table 5). While there were differences in the ranking of the majority of other diseases between the two groups, the mean difference across all diseases was three ranked positions indicating no statistical difference between groups (Spearman's rho = 0.9759, P < 0.001). The list of diseases includes a broad group of zoonotic diseases, many of which may not be relevant for all stakeholder groups. The priority list could therefore be analysed by subgroups of diseases with common characteristics, for example vectorborne diseases, foodborne and enteric diseases, exotic diseases, endemic diseases or diseases of specific commodity groups. The priority diseases by subgroups were vectorborne diseases (leishmaniasis, Chagas\u2019 disease and the plague for HHP; leishmaniasis, Crimean\u2010Congo haemorrhagic fever and Chagas\u2019 disease for AHP), foodborne and enteric diseases (listeriosis, variant Creutzfeldt\u2013Jakob disease and cryptosporidiosis for HHP; variant Creutzfeldt\u2013Jakob disease, listeriosis and botulism for AHP), exotic diseases (Nipah virus encephalitis, Ebola virus haemorrhagic fever and Marburg haemorrhagic fever for both HHP and AHP) and endemic diseases (rabies, H1N1 influenza and listeriosis for HHP; rabies, variant Creutzfeldt\u2013Jakob disease and H1N1 influenza for AHP). Although differences were also observed by subgroups, the differences were not statistically significant (P < 0.001 for all subgroups). Generally, diseases of high priority were characterized by high disease incidence (H/A), high case fatality (H), increasing or emerging disease trend (H/A), high severity of illness (H), high socio\u2010economic burden (H/A) and high transmission potential from animals to humans, but it was not necessary to have each of these characteristics to be identified as a high priority disease (e.g. rabies incidence in humans and animals is low, and disease trend has been stable over the last 5 years).",

Even diseases that are not endemic to North America pose a threat to the population due to international travel (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2014; Public Health Agency of Canada, 2014; World Health Organization, 2014). We previously presented on the use of CA for the prioritization of zoonoses in North America by the general public (Ng and Sargeant, 2012a) and aggregated professional groups (Ng and Sargeant, 2013). Here, we present the results of the professional groups separated by HHP and AHP to explore differences in disease prioritization between these groups. We selected CA to fit statistical models to choice data within a mathematical framework, thus generating relative weighted scores for disease criteria and levels; this allowed us to overcome the limitation of assigning arbitrary linear scores and subjective weights to disease criteria and levels. The use of CA also allowed for disease criteria and levels to be considered jointly, thus the derived weighted scores account for interactions between criteria and levels. There has been a shift towards the use of statistical and mathematical methods similar to CA to elicit and reveal weighted scores from individuals rather than to explicitly solicit scores and weights for disease criteria and levels (Havelaar et al., 2010; Brookes et al., 2014a,b). However, as the prioritization objectives, study participants, and the diseases being prioritized differ between studies, it is not feasible to compare methods objectively.",

The part\u2010worth utilities were also logical with higher preferences given to higher levels and lower preferences to lower levels. The disease priority list generated by applying part\u2010worth utilities to the diseases and their syndromes produced a reasonable list of diseases to prioritize, particularly when diseases were categorized by subgroups.",

            "text": "We included a wide range of health professionals in our study: doctors and veterinarians who treat patients and animals, nurses representing the frontline of defence for patients seeking medical care, laboratory technicians who have an understanding of the identification and diagnosis of disease\u2010causing pathogens, infectious disease researchers who have expertise on various aspects of communicable diseases, and public health practitioners and epidemiologists who understand the impact of diseases at the population level. Each profession has a unique understanding of diseases from a different perspective and can add much value to the decision to prioritize zoonoses, yet many disease prioritization studies are often limited to disease experts or end\u2010user stakeholders. The use of CA in this study allowed individuals from different professions to participate because it presented participants with all the information they needed to prioritize diseases. Because of the diversity of the professionals involved, it was therefore not surprising that we identified differences between HHP and AHP. We found HHP placed more importance on human\u2010related disease criteria while AHP placed higher importance on animal\u2010related criteria in their decision to prioritize. These findings are supported by the initial focus groups that were conducted to inform this study (Ng and Sargeant, 2012b). The preference for animal\u2010related criteria in the AHP and human\u2010related criteria in the HHP resulted in unique priority lists for these groups. This is perhaps the most interesting aspect of this study, although we know that different stakeholders prioritize diseases differently according to their own personal and professional objectives, this study identified which disease criteria had the most influence and quantified those differences numerically using a revealed preference approach. The ability to quantify and understand why individuals prioritize diseases differently could aid in the disease prioritization process by allowing those involved to discuss the most divisive factors between groups and potentially come to consensus on a disease priority list after taking into account of those factors. Further, the findings from this study can guide decision\u2010makers on the disease criteria that should be considered in any zoonotic disease prioritization process that has to be made in the absence of either of these professional groups. For example, when prioritizing zoonotic diseases with an objective that involves the combined impact on humans and animals, HHP decision\u2010makers should consider the impact of animal\u2010related criteria, principally, socio\u2010economic burden in animals, severity of illness in animals, control measures in animals and animal\u2010to\u2010animal transmission. While these criteria may not directly impact on human health, they are important to AHP and excluding these criteria or downgrading their importance would produce a priority list that is inconsistent with the priorities of AHP. Similarly, AHP decision\u2010makers should consider human\u2010related criteria in their decision, particularly high\u2010risk groups in humans, disease incidence in humans, human\u2010to\u2010human transmission and control measures in humans when considering their own priorities. In doing so, the concerns of stakeholders absent from the decision\u2010making process can be addressed appropriately. Applying this reasoning to the disease priority list presented in this study, it becomes apparent why HHP and AHP prioritized diseases differently. For example, cryptosporidiosis was ranked eight positions higher by HHP than by AHP; this is likely due to a combination of high incidence in humans (important for HHP), low socio\u2010economic burden in trade animals (important for AHP) and typically mild clinical signs in animals (also important for AHP). Conversely, Brucellosis was ranked 11 positions higher by AHP than by HHP, likely due to the joint impact of high socio\u2010economic burden in trade animals, high animal\u2010to\u2010animal transmission potential, moderate severity of illness in animals and low human\u2010to\u2010human transmission potential. The same logic can be applied to the other diseases with large differences in ranks. Only by incorporating the importance of disease criteria from a range of professional groups can a disease priority list truly reflect the preferences of health professionals.",

Although individuals were asked to prioritize for the control and prevention of zoonoses, they may have prioritized with other objectives in mind. Unfortunately, there is no way to measure this type of bias and we assume that participants were consistent with their prioritization objectives. We also used multiple recruitment methods to recruit participants (Ng and Sargeant, 2013); it is unknown whether different recruitment methods produced different results. We assume participants responded to the survey in the same manner regardless of their mode of recruitment. Finally, at the time of the literature search, there was a lack of data for some disease criteria pertaining to specific diseases (Sargeant and Ng, 2011). It is unknown the impact this uncertainty may have had on the current results. However, the best available data at the time of study implementation were used to inform this study.",

Human\u2010related criteria were more influential for HHP in their decision to prioritize zoonoses, while animal\u2010related criteria were the dominant drivers for AHP; this resulted in different disease priority lists between the two groups. We identified and quantified disease criteria that had the strongest influence in the decision to prioritize, and these findings aid in our understanding of why HHP and AHP prioritize diseases differently and can inform future prioritization exercises when either groups cannot be involved. Our findings highlight the importance of engaging a range of health professionals in the disease prioritization process to ensure that all priorities are addressed and that disease priority lists are representative of all affected stakeholders. The scientific framework for disease prioritization described in this study can be revised on a regular basis by updating criteria levels to match diseases to their most current trends; such a framework is of value to North America allowing diseases with the highest impact and threat to be identified routinely in order to allocate resources for their prevention and control.",
