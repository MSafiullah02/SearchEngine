PCR products were purified by using gel extraction (Qiagen, Valencia, Calif) and Agencourt AMPure XP beads (Beckman Coulter, Fullerton, Calif). Subsequently, the PCR concentration was measured with the Quant-it Picogreen dsDNA assay (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, Calif). The purified PCR products were sequenced on the 454 GS junior instrument according to the manufacturer's recommendations by using the GS junior Titanium emPCR kit (Lib-A), sequencing kit, and PicoTiterPlate kit (454 Life Sciences; Roche, Branford, Conn). By using the CLC genomic workbench software, the samples were separated based on their multiplex identifier sequence and trimmed, and reads with a quality score of less than 0.05 and less than 250 bp were discarded. The reads were uploaded to IMGT HighV-Quest software.18 Subsequently, these output files were uploaded to the custom Galaxy platform.19, 20, 21 Further processing was done in the R programming language22 to generate the tabular and graphic outputs. The complementary determining region 3 (CDR3) amino acid patterns were visualized with WebLogo (http://weblogo.berkeley.edu/).23, 24\n",

Three RAG1 mutations found on the second allele were also analyzed in the in vitro recombination assay, showing no residual RAG1 activity (Fig 1, A). In addition, we determined the presence of polymorphisms in the RAG1 gene because these might influence the recombination activity of RAG1. The only polymorphism found was p.Arg249His, which was shown not to affect recombination activity.2\n",

In healthy children pro-B and pre-BI cells constitute 20% to 25% of the precursor B cells (Fig 1, B). All patients with \u201cclassical\u201d SCID and OS, except P13, showed a complete block before the pre\u2013BII-cell stage (Fig 1, B), whereas most of the patients with CID had a leaky block with greater than 10% pre-BII and immature B cells (Fig 1, B). RAG1 and RAG2 transcription levels were determined in the BM mononuclear cells to exclude that differences in RAG1 transcription levels caused these difference in precursor B-cell composition. It is known that RAG1 and RAG2 transcription levels are correlated, and that RAG1 and RAG2 levels in BM mononuclear cells depend on the number of cells expressing RAG (pre-BI and pre-BII cells).30 In all 11 studied patients, the RAG1 transcription level was correlated to RAG2 (Fig 1, C), indicating that the differences in severity of the precursor B-cell block were not caused by differences in expression of RAG1. B-cell numbers in PB were undetectable or very low in most patients, except P15, who had normal levels (Table II). Correlating the percentage of pre-BII and immature cells in BM with the number of peripheral B cells showed that only patients with greater than 10% pre-BII and immature B cells in BM (P13, P14, P15, P16, and P17) had detectable B cells in PB. Collectively, these data indicate that most patients with CID have a milder block in the precursor B-cell composition and that only patients with a leaky block have detectable B cells in the PB.",

IGH gene rearrangements were amplified from mononuclear cells derived from PB, BM, or both and subsequently sequenced by using next-generation sequencing in healthy control subjects (PB and BM) and 3 patients with CID (P15, P16, and P18). The frequency of unique sequences in IGH genes was significantly lower in patients with RAGD than in control subjects (Table III\n), which is a reflection of the low numbers of B cells present in PB. Despite the low recombination activity, IGHV, IGHD, and IGHJ gene use was not restricted (Fig 2\nand see Fig E1 in this article's Online Repository at www.jacionline.org). Forty-eight of the 57 IGHV genes used in control subjects were identified in the patients with RAGD because were the 25 IGHD genes and all 6 IGHJ genes. IGHV, IGHD, and IGHJ gene uses were similar to those seen in control subjects, although some genes were used with different frequencies (Fig 2 and see Fig E1). Most strikingly, JH6 use was lower whereas JH4 use was higher compared with that seen in control subjects. The patients with RAGD had a significantly lower frequency (5.9% to 6.2% vs 20.9% to 24.3% in control subjects) of unproductive rearrangements (Table III), as reported previously.31 Unproductive rearrangements were defined as out-of-frame rearrangements or rearrangements with a stop codon. Therefore even though the patients with RAGD had reduced V(D)J recombination, leading to a limited TR and immunoglobulin repertoire, the IGH gene use was similar to that seen in control subjects without preferential use of the proximal or distal genes.",

Unfortunately, the thymic architecture and autoimmune regulator and tissue-specific antigen expression could not be studied in our patients, but we were able to evaluate 3 parameters in the IGH sequences that are associated with autoimmunity. These are characterized by long CDR3s, and the frequency of IGHV4-34, which is known to encode intrinsically self-reactive cold agglutinin antibodies that recognize carbohydrate antigens on erythrocytes.38, 39 The distribution of the CDR3 length of the unique junctions in BM and PB was similar to that seen in control subjects (Fig 3\n, A), except patient 18, who seemed to have increased numbers of junctions with a CDR3 of 16 and 22 amino acids. These junctions with a CDR3 length of 22 amino acids displayed high similarity (Fig 3, B). No sequence similarity was found when all 16-amino-acid CDR3s were compared (Fig 3, B), but 18.3% of these junctions used IGHV6-1, and all these junctions had a highly similar CDR3 sequence (Fig 3, B), which suggests that they might recognize a common antigenic determinant. The frequency of long CDR3s (\u226515 amino acids) was significantly lower in P15 and P16 (P < .0001) but not in P18 (Fig 3, C). The frequency of IGHV4-34 use was significantly higher in P16 (P < .0001) and P18 (P < .0001; Fig 3, D). From the 3 patients we analyzed, P18 had autoimmunity, which was reflected by the high frequency of IGHV4-34 use.",

The N-terminally truncated RAG1 protein is produced through translation starting from an alternative start site (M183 or M202), and hence the amount of protein is dependent on how efficiently these start sites are used. Because the RAG1 transcription level correlated with that of RAG2, we assume that all patients had similar expression of the mutant RAG1 protein (Fig 1, C). We cannot exclude that epigenetics and modifier genes accounted for small differences in RAG1 protein expression.

In addition, these mice had increased serum B cell\u2013activating factor levels, which might rescue autoreactive B-cell clones. This increase in serum B cell\u2013activating factor levels was also seen in patients with RAG-, Artemis-, and X-linked SCID.37 Similar to observations in mice, most patients with RAGD did not use the IGKJ5 gene, whereas IGKV gene use was normal. This suggests that receptor editing in this group of patients with RAGD was slightly impaired, which can either be a result of reduced recombination activity caused by the RAG1 mutation or by low B-cell numbers leading to reduced selection against autoreactive B cells. The IGH repertoire was investigated for long CDR3s and increased IGHV4-34 use, which are associated with autoreactive antibodies.47, 48 From the 3 patients with RAGD we analyzed, only P18 had autoimmunity, which was reflected by an increased VH4-34 gene use.",

On the basis of our results and earlier reported data, we propose an explanatory model for the development of different clinical phenotypes in patients with RAGD with similar mutations (Fig 5\n). If RAGD results in reduced V(D)J recombination, low B- and T-cell numbers are produced with some (compensatory) clonal expansion. This expansion might increase the B- and T-cell numbers to even normal levels but does not change the limited repertoire. In such limited repertoire the selection against autoreactive cells is impaired. Provided the deficient immune system is not activated, patients with RAGD are asymptomatic. However, when the immune system will be activated by potentially a wide range of different (auto)antigens, the type of antigen and activated effector lymphocyte will have important consequences for the clinical phenotype. In addition, the impaired negative and positive selection of thymic lymphocytes and reduced number of regulatory T cells might result in autoimmunity when patients are exposed to autoantigens. This phenomenon can occur at any early stage, even in utero, as shown by the fact that patients with OS can have severe erythroderma already at birth, which is unlikely to be triggered by infections. Additionally, directly after birth, the skin and gastrointestinal tract become colonized by commensal bacteria, which can trigger the chronic diarrhea seen in most patients with RAGD. Key steps in the development of a certain clinical phenotype will be the B- and T-cell repertoire, the type of (auto)antigen exposure, the specificity of the antigen receptors and timing, the cell type involved in the immune activation, and the potential influence of genetic variations in modifier genes. Variability in any of these factors might eventually lead to different clinical phenotypes, despite a similar genetic defect.",

The clinical outcome of an individual patient with RAGD depends on a complex interplay between the (limited) immune receptor repertoire, (auto)antigen exposure, the specificity of antigen receptors, and the timing and cell type involved in immune activation. Therefore the clinical outcome of patients with RAGD with similar mutations is extremely difficult to predict.Clinical implicationsRAGD can result in a broad spectrum of clinical presentations, but the level of residual RAG activity is not always predictive for the clinical outcome.\n",
