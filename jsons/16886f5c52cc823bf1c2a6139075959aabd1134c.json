Thus far, the precise immune mechanisms have not been fully elucidated or studied in detail. In this issue of EBioMedicine, Liu and colleagues [1] showed that patients with severe COVID-19 had lymphopenia and increased neutrophil counts along with high levels of circulating pro-inflammatory cytokines compared to patients with mild COVID-19 illness. The investigators used flow cytometry to investigate immune phenotype and function of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC), as well as quantified plasma cytokine levels, from 40 COVID-19 patients. In particular, substantial depletion of CD8+ T cells were associated with disease severity, and both the ratios of neutrophils to CD8+ T cells (N8R) and neutrophils to lymphocytes (NLR) were predictive of COVID-19 outcome. These data suggest that depletion of lymphocytes, particularly cytotoxic T lymphocytes that function by eliminating infected cells, coupled with neutrophils capable of mediating a proinflammatory \"cytokine storm\" may be key players in COVID-19 pathogenesis.",

This study clearly demonstrates that severe COVID-19 is associated with significant increases in pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-6 as well as significant reductions in CD8+ T cells. Th1 antiviral responses appear to be suppressed, which is supported by increases in the Th2 cytokine IL-10. A recent study in 21 patients also demonstrated that COVID-19 induced increases in IL-6 and IL-10 with corresponding lymphopenia [3] . These data indicate that cytokine storms may, in concert with suppressed Th1 antiviral adaptive responses, underlie the pathogenesis of severe COVID-19 disease.",

It demonstrates potentially critical roles for IL-2, IL-6, IL-10, and IFN-g in severe disease, suggesting that the magnitude of the cytokine storm is associated with severity of disease. Mean IL-6 concentrations have been shown to be 2.9 times higher in patients with severe disease and maximal IL-6 highly predictive of respiratory failure [4, 5] . These data also suggest that monitoring N8R and NLR over time could be a way to identify patients early on at risk for developing severe disease [6] .",

Monitoring N8R and NLR over time may assist frontline clinicians in identifying those at greatest risk for developing severe COVID-19 and prompt them to institute supportive care earlier or initiate transfer to a higher level of care [6] . Appreciating the role of pro-inflammatory cytokines in the pathogenesis of the disease is important as the scientific community develops therapeutics to treat patients. IL-6 inhibitors such as tocilizumab and siltuximab are already being used in the treatment of patients with severe COVID-19 in hopes of suppressing inflammatory responses and have been adopted in the most recent Chinese National Health Commission Novel Coronavirus Pneumonia guidelines [5, 7] .",
