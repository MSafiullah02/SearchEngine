Among the viruses that infect enterocytes, or at least use them as a portal of entry, there are two major groups. The first group comprises those viruses that cause systemic infections after entering into the body through the gastrointestinal tract, and diarrhoea, if ever present, is not a major feature of infection. This group includes many enteroviruses, including poliovirus and coxsackieviruses, hepatitis A and E viruses and some adenoviruses. The second group comprises viruses that infect the upper small intestine and cause non-inflammatory diarrhoea. There are currently five established gastroenteritis viruses affecting humans, i.e. Rotavirus, Norovirus, Sapovirus, Human Astrovirus, and Human Adenovirus F (formerly called group F adenovirus).",

However, the consequences of infection are markedly different according to geographic location, with over 95% of deaths due to rotavirus diarrhoea occurring in the developing countries of the Indian subcontinent, sub-Saharan Africa and Latin America (Figure 18.2\n).4, 5, 6 Rotavirus diarrhoea occurs at an earlier age in children in developing countries than in children in developed countries (Figure 18.3\n). The median age of children hospitalized with rotavirus diarrhoea in many African and Asian counties is 6\u20139 months, and up to 80% are less than 1 year old. In contrast, the median age in developed countries is 13\u201316 months and the highest proportion of cases occurs in the 2nd year of life.7, 8 In temperate countries, rotavirus infections peak in the winter and early spring, with fewer cases detected at other times. In tropical countries, rotavirus infections characteristically occur throughout the year, although more cases are typically observed in the cooler and drier months. Although the mode(s) of transmission of rotavirus are not completely understood, person-to-person spread of rotavirus by the faecal\u2013oral route is likely to play a central role.",

The annual global mortality due to rotavirus diarrhoea among children less than 5 years of age has been estimated as 453 000 in the pre-rotavirus vaccine era, with rotavirus accounting for 37% of all diarrhoea deaths and 5% of all-cause deaths in children under 5 years of age.9 The Democratic Republic of Congo, Ethiopia, India, Nigeria, and Pakistan accounted for more than half of all rotavirus deaths, with India alone accounting for 22% of deaths.9\n",

            "text": "By conventional negative-stain electron microscopy, rotavirus has a characteristic double capsid appearance measuring approximately 75 nm in diameter (Figure 18.1), but cryo-electron microscopic studies demonstrated that the rotavirus virion comprises a triple-layered capsid with 60 spikes protruding from its surface, making its overall diameter nearly 100 nm. The outermost layer (outer capsid) consists of two proteins, VP4 and VP7, each of which independently serves as a neutralization antigen (Figure 18.4\n). The serotype defined by the VP4 protein is called the P type, for protease-sensitive protein (because VP4 is proteolytically cleaved into VP8* and VP5*), and the serotype defined by the VP7 protein is called the G type, for glycoprotein. The middle capsid consists of the most abundant viral protein, VP6, which is the major protein against which non-neutralizing antibodies are raised during infection. The core or the innermost layer consists of VP2, a scaffolding protein, and inside this layer are VP1 (viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase) and VP3 (guanyltransferase), which is present in association with the 11 segments of double-stranded genomic RNA. In addition to these five structural proteins, there are six non-structural proteins (NSPs), each of which is encoded by a single genome segment, except for NSP5 and NSP6 (encoded by RNA segment 11), which carry out various functions during replication and morphogenesis. NSP4 is a chaperone protein enabling the subviral particle to acquire the outer capsid proteins VP4 and VP7 during the later phases of viral morphogenesis. NSP4 also acts as a viral enterotoxin, causing diarrhoea in newborn mice.15, 16, 17\n",

Rotavirus attaches to its cellular receptors (sialoglycoprotein and integrins) via the VP4 protein. The minimum infective dose is as low as 102\u2013103 virus particles in adult volunteers.29 Progeny virus is produced after 10\u201312 h, and released in large numbers into the intestinal lumen ready to infect other cells. The pathogenesis of rotavirus diarrhoea includes both malabsorptive and secretory components.30 Malabsorption may be consequent upon damage to mature absorptive enterocytes resulting in malabsorption of nutrients, electrolytes and water; virus-induced downregulation of the expression of absorptive enzymes; and functional changes in tight junctions between enterocytes leading to paracellular leakage. Biopsies show atrophy of the villi and mononuclear cell infiltrates in the lamina propria. Secretory mechanisms include those mediated by activation of the enteric nervous system and the effect of NSP4, the latter being via activation of cellular Cl\u2212 channels, leading to increased Cl\u2212 and consequently water secretion. Rotavirus infection was previously thought to be limited to the intestine, but rotavirus causes viraemia for at least a short period in the acute phase of infection in immunocompetent infants as well as in experimentally infected animals.31 The clinical significance of this systemic spread of rotavirus remains unclear.",

Furthermore, infection with one serotype generally provides serotype-specific (homotypic) protection, and repeated infections lead to partial cross-serotype (heterotypic) protection. These beliefs are supported by the findings of a cohort study in Mexico, where children who had experienced one, two or three episodes of rotavirus diarrhoea had adjusted relative risks of experiencing a further attack of rotavirus diarrhoea of 0.23, 0.17 and 0.08, respectively, and of asymptomatic rotavirus infection of 0.62, 0.40 and 0.34, respectively.32 However in a cohort study in Vellore, India, while protection against moderate or severe disease increased with successive infections it was only 79% after three infections and no evidence of homotypic protection was demonstrated, indicating that immune protection following natural infection may vary by location.33 In the Indian study, multiple infections were common, with only 30% of all identified infections being primary. Immunity following natural rotavirus infection is believed to be mediated by both humoral and cell-mediated immune responses.34 Rotavirus-specific immunoglobulin (Ig) A antibodies on the enteric mucosal surface are thought to be the primary mediator of protective immunity. Cellular immunity is considered to be important in the resolution of rotavirus infection and appears to be cross-protective between the different G serotypes.35\n",

Neonatal strains are often unusual and can infect even in the presence of high titres of transplacental antibody from the mother. Asymptomatic neonatal infections may induce protection against subsequent severe rotavirus gastroenteritis.40 Finally, it is increasingly recognized that otherwise healthy adults can experience rotavirus diarrhoea and elderly people can develop severe rotavirus gastroenteritis as their immunity wanes.41, 42\n",

In severe cases, the cause of death is dehydration, which can be hypo- or hypernatraemic and is often associated with metabolic acidosis. Underlying conditions such as malnutrition may be a risk factor for a more severe disease outcome. Rotavirus does not appear to produce more severe disease in HIV-infected infants.46, 47\n",

Electron microscopy remains a valuable diagnostic tool since it is a catch-all technique that will also detect other potential viral enteropathogens. PAGE is a convenient diagnostic tool for the detection of rotavirus RNA extracted directly from stool specimens (Figure 18.5). The assay also allows detection of non-group A rotaviruses, which fail to react in most antigen detection assays. PAGE is a relatively simple technique with high specificity for rotavirus (100%) and reasonable sensitivity (80\u201390%), and can be performed in tropical countries relatively cheaply.49 It has the added advantage of providing epidemiological information because the electrophoretic migration pattern of the 11 segments of the double-stranded RNA genome is specific to each rotavirus strain.18, 50\n",

Human or bovine colostrum and hyperimmune human serum immunoglobulin have been used to manage chronic rotavirus infection in immunocompromised children. Administration of probiotics such as Lactobacillus casei GG also appears beneficial. The antiprotozoal drug nitazoxanide was shown to decrease the median duration of rotavirus gastroenteritis by 44 hours in a randomized double-blind placebo-controlled trial in Egyptian children.58 As an adjunct to oral rehydration, the antisecretory agent racecadotril reduces diarrhoea duration and stool volume in children with acute gastroenteritis.59\n",

Thus, prevention of severe rotavirus gastroenteritis by vaccines remains the only practical preven\u00adtive measure.60 The first licensed rotavirus vaccine, a rhesus monkey rotavirus-based tetravalent human reassortant vaccine (RotaShield\u00ae), was withdrawn after this live, oral vaccine was associated with the development of intestinal intussusception in approximately 1 : 10 000 vaccine recipients in the USA, with intussusception cases occurring disproportionately in those infants who received their first dose of vaccine at over three months of age.61, 62 These unfortunate events stimulated the further development and testing of two additional live, oral rotavirus vaccines, Rotarix\u00ae (GlaxoSmithKline Biologicals) and RotaTeq\u00ae (Merck & Co.). Rotarix\u00ae is a monovalent, human rotavirus vaccine of serotype G1P1A[8] administered as a two-dose schedule, whereas RotaTeq\u00ae is a pentavalent, bovine\u2013human reassortant vaccine comprising types G1, G2, G3, G4 and P[8] and is given in a 3-dose schedule.63 Both vaccines were found to be safe in large, phase III clinical trials, each involving more than 60 000 infants and were 85\u201395% efficacious in preventing severe gastroenteritis due to rotavirus.64, 65 In countries that have introduced rotavirus vaccine into their childhood immunization programmes, hospitalizations due to rotavirus gastroenteritis have dramatically fallen.66, 67 Evidence of an indirect effect of rotavirus vaccines has been presented from the USA and other settings, with reduced incidence of disease in children too old to have been vaccinated and in adults.66, 67\n",

Early studies suggested an increase in prevalence of G2P[4] strains following Rotarix introduction in Brazil, but it remains unclear whether this results from immune pressure secondary to vaccine use or natural fluctuation in strain types.77 Continuous global strain surveillance is required to address this question.78\n",

The disease tends to be milder and more frequently encountered in community-based studies.89 One such study in Mexico estimated the incidence of astrovirus gastroenteritis to be 0.1 episodes/child per year.90 Seroepidemiological studies have demonstrated that more than 90% of children in the USA will have experienced astrovirus infections by the age of 6\u20139 years.91 Astrovirus has been detected in all countries where sufficiently sensitive detection methods have been used. In temperate countries it shows a similar seasonal distribution to rotavirus but peaks earlier.",

Norovirus was initially thought solely to cause epidemic gastroenteritis limited to older children and adults, but it is the cause of gastroenteritis in four epidemiological settings. These include: (1) Epidemic food-borne gastroenteritis that affects a large number of otherwise healthy adults over a short period of time; the illness usually resolves spontaneously without sequelae. (2) Sporadic gastroenteritis in the community.98 (3) Healthcare-associated infections occurring in semi-closed settings such as hospital wards and residential homes resulting in often prolonged illness with increased severity. (4) Infantile diarrhoea in both developing and developed countries.99 In a study in Finnish children, norovirus was responsible for 20% of gastroenteritis cases.100 Similarly, in Iraq,101 Libya,102 and Brazil,103 norovirus was detected in 30%, 18%, 15%, of diarrhoeal children less than 5 years of age, respectively.

However, the diagnosis of norovirus gastroenteritis is now most commonly undertaken by sensitive, real-time PCR assays with genogroup-specific Taqman probes that provide both virus detection and quantification.105 When the amount of virus is abundant, this will be followed by qualitative RT-PCR to amplify the end of ORF1 and the first part of ORF2 and subsequent sequencing to determine the genotype of a strain. In practice, a web-based genotyping tool is conveniently used (see: http://www.rivm.nl/mpf/norovirus/typingtool). Although much less sensitive than these molecular-based assays, commercial antigen detection kits have been developed; immune-chromatography, in particular, allows diagnosis at the point of care. While the specificity of such immunoassays is close to 100% for those norovirus genotypes to which antibodies used in the kit are raised, diagnostic accuracy in practice may be lower because of the antigenic diversity likely to be encountered.",

Recent progress in understanding the relationships between norovirus and histo-blood group antigens has partly solved this mystery.106 Norovirus appears to use ABO and Lewis blood group antigens expressed on the mucosal surface of the enterocytes as viral receptors; thus, non-secretors, in whom such antigens are not expressed on the intestinal mucosa, are resistant to norovirus infection.107 Recent studies propose an evolutionary model in which the most prevalent GII.4 noroviruses persist by altering histo-blood group antigen binding targets as well as changing epitopes surrounding the binding pocket over time.108\n",
