We also tested for early\u2010life factors predicting the exercise or bronchodilation\u2010induced bronchial reactivity.

Rrs and Xrs both are components of total respiratory impedance (Zrs, results from phase and pressure changes of the airflow). The frequency dependency of resistance (dRrs/df) was determined using linear regression through resistance data points Rrs5 and Rrs10. During obstruction, Rrs increases resulting in increased dRrs/df. Xrs decreases due to peripheral stiffening as a result of obstruction.

In adjusted analysis, which included age at study entry, hospitalization, OCS use at study entry, ICS use within 4 weeks, atopic sensitization at study entry, and rhinovirus etiology, atopic sensitization remained statistically significant (\u03b2 0.54; 95%CI 0.027 to 1.1; P = 0.027).

Turner et al6 demonstrated that the infant atopy is associated with the reduction of pulmonary function measured by rapid thoraco\u2010abdominal compression technique or spirometry from the age of 1 month to 18 years. Moreover, Belgrave et al7 found that number of early specific sensitizations correlated inversely with pulmonary function measured by plethysmography from the age of 3 to 11 years. Our finding extends these results by showing that atopic sensitization at the time of the first severe wheezing episode is associated with increased bronchial reactivity measured by IOS in addition to a reduction in pulmonary function in a long\u2010term follow\u2010up to the age of 5 years. The link between allergic airway inflammation and subsequent increased bronchial reactivity is incompletely understood. The possible explanations are related to immune dysregulation and promotion of type 2 cytokines, for example IL\u201013, and counteracting Th1\u2010mediated mechanisms, for example interferon expression, which are important in viral defense.1 Allergic airway inflammation may also weaken epithelial barrier function and thereby increase susceptibility to viral infections.37\n",

However, we did not find associations between any of these patient characteristics and IOS parameters. Association between rhinovirus genome load and pulmonary function has not been investigated earlier. We did not find any association between viral load and IOS parameters as well. In our study, the mean age of the children during the pulmonary function testing was lower when compared to the earlier studies (mean 5 years vs 7.2\u201011 years), which may partly explain the negative results. The low sensitivity of IOS is another probable explanation for the negative results. Moreover, this is the first study concentrating on the first acute virus\u2010induced wheezing episode, and thus, our results underline the role of sensitization as an early risk marker for later bronchial reactivity.",

According to the Finnish guidelines,41 which are in line with the US National Asthma Education and Prevention Program guidelines,35 regular long\u2010term asthma control medication is started relatively early in life.
