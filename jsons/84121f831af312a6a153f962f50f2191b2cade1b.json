Noroviruses (NV) were the first viral agents proven to cause GE. They are part of the Calicivirus family. Caliciviruses are single stranded, 37-41 nm, nonenveloped RNA viruses (including noroviruses 33-40 nm and sapoviruses). Because of the low inoculum needed for transmission, prolonged viral shedding and the ability to survive in the environment, Noroviruses have become major pathogens. They account for 18% of GE worldwide and are now recognized as the leading cause of foodborne illness in the United States. The CDC estimates that NV causes 19-21 million illnesses, 56,000-71,000 hospitalizations and between 570 and 800 deaths (CDC, n.d.) . The GII strain of NV is the most common. Outbreaks of NV are frequently reported on cruise ships, nursing homes, schools and work places. Outbreaks most often occur in the wintertime, hence the moniker, winter vomiting disease. However, the illness does occur throughout the year, impacting older children and adults. NV GE has a short incubation period (IP) of 12-48 h, and typically causes acute onset nausea, vomiting and diarrhea which lasting under 48 h.

Factors important in NV pathogenesis include: their attachment to HBGA's, tissue and cellular tropism of the virus, the host immune response and the host gut microbiota (deGraaf et al., 2016) . In murine models, NV appears to infect both enterocytes and immune cells. Infection of enterocytes has not been shown in humans. It appears that NV target human immune cells including macrophages, dendritic cells, B and T-cells. Murine NV can be transcytosed across intestinal epithelial cells in culture via microfold (M-) cells without productive infection or disruption of tight junctions (Gonzalez-Hernandez et al., 2013) .

The binding specificity of norovirus VP1 to different HBGAs varies between norovirus genotypes and is a determinant of susceptibility to specific NV strains. Nonsecretors, lacking FUT2 are less susceptible to NV infection with GI and GII strains.Commensal gut bacteria expressing HBGAs also play a role in B-cell infection by NV (Karst, 2016) . Antimicrobial treatment of the gut microbiota in mice reduces NV replication (Jones et al., 2014) . Repletion of these, restores NV infectivity. In addition, the commensal gut bacteria suppress the antiviral activity of type III interferon which allows persistence of NV within the colon (Baldridge et al., 2015) .

The diarrhea is believed to be multifactorial due to malabsorption, the rotavirus enterotoxin and secretion triggered by activation of the enteric nervous system. RV particles are ingested, and trypsin cleaves the spike protein VP4 into two terminal fragments VP8 and VP5. The VP8 contains a hemagglutinin domain whereas the VP5 a beta-barrel domain which interact with the membranes of small intestinal enterocytes. This interaction is mediated via VP8's interactions with sialic acid-containing and nonsialylated receptor molecules (HBGAs). RV is internalized and the outer capsid is lost, activating the virion-associated transcriptase and viral macromolecular synthases. Viral proteins and RNAs concentrate in cytoplasmic structures called viroplasms, where RNA replication and packaging take place. Intracellular events, probably involving (nonstructural protein 4) NSP4, the RV enterotoxin trigger the release of Ca 2\u00fe from the endoplasmic reticulum (Lundgren and Svensson, 2001) . The NSP4 viroporin domain is a calcium-conducting ion channel. The increase in intracellular Ca 2\u00fe concentration begins a cascade of cellular processes, including disruption of the microvillar cytoskeletal network, lowered expression of disaccharidases and other enzymes at the apical surface, general inhibition of the Na \u00fe -solute cotransport systems, and necrosis. NSP4 appears to be released specifically by a Ca 2\u00fe -dependent, nonclassical secretion pathway prior to cell lysis. These events lead to a malabsorption component of the diarrhea through reduction in absorptive capacity of the epithelium, reduced activity of Na \u00fe -solute cotransporters, and reduction of digestive enzyme expression on the epithelial surface (Hagborn et al., 2012) . Development of serum and mucosal antibodies against VP4 and VP7 may protect from disease. The ENS also plays a role in RV disease. Inhibition of serotonin receptors and enkephalinases may reduce the secretory component of diarrhea.
