            "text": "It is worth noting that, in spite of higher PSI scores in presence of VRTIs, we found no association between VRTIs and need of antibiotic treatment escalation, ICU admission and risk of mortality. Other studies investigating clinical outcomes in the same setting found opposite results. Yoon et al. [25] found that preceding VRTIs do not affect mortality in adults with pneumococcal CAP, while Voiriot et al. [32] reported that mixed bacterial and viral infections are associated with hospital death and/or prolonged mechanical ventilation in ICU-admitted CAP patients. Moreover, some authors used different surrogate endpoints of clinical response, such as length of hospitalization or length of mechanical ventilation. However, these endpoints may be affected by a variety of factors, including the presence of any comorbidity and the development of superinfection, thus not sufficiently clarify the role of VRTIs. On the other hand, as escalation of antibiotic treatment is usually the consequence of lack of response to previous treatment, we evaluated the impact of VRTIs on the need of antibiotic escalation.",

Thus, we stratified patients according to the supposed microbiological aetiology and we found that mixed and viral CAP had pneumonia severity at admission, radiological findings and outcomes similar to bacterial CAP. However, the viruses detected in the pharynx may represent only infection of the upper respiratory tract, while lower respiratory tract specimens may be more reflective of the pathogen causing pneumonia [40\u201342]. In our real-life cohort, bronchoalveolar lavage culture was performed only when clinically indicated. As only a few patients experienced clinical failure and required ICU admission or antibiotic escalation, invasive procedures were deemed unnecessary in the majority of cases. Additionally, 43% of patients included in our cohort had CAP of unknown aetiology, a finding that could be at least partially explained with previous at-home antibiotic treatment before specimens collection. The limited sample size of patients diagnosed with bacterial/viral/mixed CAP and the lack of lower respiratory tract sampling in almost all cases prevents any firm conclusion on the clinical presentation and outcome of CAP according to the aetiology and deserves further studies.",
