The Mexican Federal Government has gradually imposed a series of measures to contain the COVID-19 outbreak: schools\u2019 closures (March 20), suspension of public events (March 23), suspension of all non-essential activities of the federal government (March 26), and suspension of all non-essential activities and voluntary self-isolation (March 30). While social distancing measures have been key to flattening the curve, its social and economic effects are unevenly distributed across societies \u2013 potentially affecting to a greater extent already vulnerable groups, particularly low-income households with children [1, 2].",

Because the unequal socio-economic impacts of the distancing measures might further exacerbate pre-existing inequalities it is key to implement appropriate social protection policies while the pandemic lasts.

These households have a higher risk of facing major income reductions as well as household food insecurity [3] and household stress and risk of violence [4] as result of the social distancing measures. This in turn can reduce compliance with social distancing, and increases the risk of infection among household members and their communities.",

In partnership with other institutions, such as the Yale School of Public Health, it developed a list of action points for immediate implementation by the Federal Government:\nImmediate implementation of a temporary program of non-conditional cash transfers aimed to protect families without social security, working in the informal sector and, with children under the age of 6.A decree, to ensure that during the \u201csocial distancing\u201d period, the delivery of services such as water, electricity, telephone, gas and internet shall not be suspended to families for nonpayment.The offer of inclusive programming, in public-access television and online, to allow children and adolescents, to continue their studies of basic education, and to participate in a variety of tasks and activities at home aimed to reduce the stress of social distancing.The implementation of an evidence-based social communication campaign, to promote self-care measures, mental health, nurturing and sensitive childcare and violence prevention.To enable a telephone and online counseling program to protect the mental health of parents and caregivers, and to reduce the risk of domestic violence [5].",

A 3% administrative cost was considered based on the assumption that the government would use already existing structures to distribute the cash transfer such as schools, hospitals or community center.

A particularly relevant group is formed by families with children subsisting from the informal economy, as they lack the social security safety-nets available to those in the formal employment sector. Moreover, protecting young children is crucial in the Mexican case given that social protection for this subpopulation is completely absent from current policies. Although scarce resources will be needed for many COVID-19 related responses, investing in the well-being of young children is an imperative allocation due to its long-term consequences and social returns on this investment [7].",
