The isolation of closely related strains from the horseshoe bat has been reported,2 which suggests a potential for reemergence of the SARS\u2010CoV by retransmission to humans from its animal reservoir. There have also been three additional human coronaviruses\u2014HCoV\u2010HKU1,3 HCoV\u2010NL63,4 and HCoV\u2010EMC5\u2014reported since 2003. HCoV\u2010HKU1 and HCoV\u2010NL63 were shown to be less lethal than SARS\u2010CoV.3b, 6 However, since April 2012, fifteen people have been infected with the most recently identified coronavirus, HCoV\u2010EMC, nine of whom died from pneumonia and renal failure.7 The whole genome sequence of HCoV\u2010EMC has been characterized, and it shows close similarity to two Asian bat coronaviruses: BtCoV\u2010HKU4 and BtCoV\u2010HKU5.8 This indicates a significant possibility for the emergence of new strains of SARS or new SARS\u2010like human coronaviruses that could lead to even more deadly outbreaks.",

PLpro and 3CLpro are responsible for cleavage of the polyprotein into 16 nonstructural proteins. The first three positions between nonstructural proteins 1\u20134 are cleaved by PLpro, whereas the other eleven positions are cleaved by 3CLpro. Both 3CLpro and PLpro have been shown to be essential for viral replication,9 making them attractive drug targets against SARS\u2010CoV. 3CLpro has been intensively pursued as a drug target, and several inhibitors have been reported. They can be categorized as covalent peptidomimetic, noncovalent peptidomimetic, and nonpeptidic.10 Unlike 3CLpro, the development of PLpro inhibitors has been very limited until recently, despite its essential role in SARS viral replication. In addition to our own work,11 two very different types of PLpro inhibitors have been reported in recent years. First, 6\u2010mercaptopurine (6MP) and 6\u2010thioguanine (6TG) were identified from compound screening, with IC50 values of 5\u201320 \u03bcm.12 Second, several natural products, diarylheptanoids isolated from Alnus japonica, showed inhibitory activity (IC50 4.1 \u03bcm) against PLpro.13 In addition to its primary function of viral peptide cleavage, PLpro has been recognized to be involved in deubiquitination, de\u2010ISGylation, and viral evasion of the innate immune response.2a, 14 SARS\u2010PLpro is a cysteine protease that contains a zinc binding motif, a catalytic triad, and a ubiquitin\u2010like N\u2010terminal domain (Figure 1). The sequence identity and similarity between SARS\u2010PLpro and HCoV\u2010EMC PLpro are 32 and 51 %, respectively (Supporting Information (SI) figure S1 a). Interestingly, the predicted structure of HCoV\u2010EMC PLpro is very similar to that of SARS\u2010PLpro (SI figure S1 b). The three catalytic residues (C112, H273, and D287) and four cysteines in the zinc binding motif are identical in these two PLpro enzymes. In addition, nine highly conserved residues in many other PLpro enzymes are also observed in HCoV\u2010EMC PLpro (highlighted in yellow in SI figure S1 a). This suggests that HCoV\u2010EMC PLpro may possess characteristics similar to that of SARS\u2010PLpro.",

Inhibitors 2 (GRL\u20100617S), 3 (GRL\u20100667S), and 4 (GRL\u20100737S) have exhibited inhibitory activities of 1.32, 0.64, and 1.36 \u03bcm, with antiviral activities of 15, 9.1, and 9.1 \u03bcm, respectively.11a, 15 These inhibitors represent two active chemical scaffolds, with 1 and 2 representing the first (scaffold A), and 3 and 4 representing the second (scaffold B). Because these four lead inhibitors show moderate antiviral activity against SARS\u2010CoV, their potencies must be further improved before development into clinical candidates. Analysis of the two available PLpro structures with inhibitors 2 and 3 and subsequent molecular modeling studies revealed that these leading inhibitors bind to a pocket formed mostly by the G267\u2013G272 loop and the Leu163 side chain, distinct from the catalytic site shown in green in Figure 1.11b, 15 The inhibitors appear to block substrate access to the entrance of the catalytic site of the PLpro enzyme. Both scaffolds bind to a similar area, although scaffold A (inhibitors 1 and 2) blocks only a little over half of the area blocked by scaffold B (inhibitors 3 and 4).",

This would require the synthesis of larger compounds, a process that consumes significant amounts of time and resources, and may or may not result in better binding affinity and potency. An alternative strategy is the application of fragment\u2010based drug design (FBDD) methodology, which has become a well\u2010established method for lead optimization.16 In many cases, FBDD has been used to discover small scaffolds for further optimization or to find two small fragments that can be linked together to produce a more potent inhibitor.16e To be able to link two small fragments, it is typically necessary to solve crystal structures with each fragment. In many cases, obtaining this structural information can be very challenging and time\u2010consuming due to the typical weak binding affinity of fragments for their target enzymes. In this study, we used FBDD in combination with detailed enzymatic analysis as a means to further optimize our leading inhibitors without the use of crystallography. By testing a small library of fragment compounds in the presence of each of the lead inhibitors, we were able to identify fragments that synergistically improve the potency of the leading inhibitors. Additional enzymatic analyses (including mechanism of inhibition and mutual exclusivity studies, described in detail below) and computational studies were used to predict the fragment binding locations. Finally, a fragment\u2010merging strategy was employed to predict next\u2010generation compounds that are able to recapitulate the binding position of the lead inhibitors as well as key binding features of the identified fragments.",

This leaves the catalytic site unoccupied during inhibition. Although the catalytic pocket is small, there is a reasonable probability that fragment compounds could successfully bind to this location and enhance inhibitory activity of the lead inhibitors. The Zenobia library, consisting of 352 chemically and structurally diverse fragment\u2010like compounds, was experimentally screened in the presence of each of the four previously discovered lead inhibitors. All fragment compounds were tested by continuous kinetic enzymatic assays as described in the Experimental Section below. A replicate plot of inhibitor 2 with the 352 fragments showed highly reproducible results (SI figure S2 a). The replicate plots of the other lead inhibitors were similar to that of inhibitor 2. Of the 352 fragment\u2010like compounds, 17, 14, 16, and 16 fragments showed >30 % increase in enzyme inhibition when tested at a fragment concentration of 200 \u03bcm in the presence of inhibitors 1, 2, 3, and 4, respectively. Percentage efficiency indices (PEI) for all 352 fragments were calculated as a hit selection criteria according to the method of Abad\u2010Zapatero et al.; percent inhibition was divided by the molecular weight (M\nr) of each compound.17 Compounds with PEI values of 1.5 or greater were classified as hits, and the medium\u2010range compounds (PEI 2.0\u20134.0) were selected for further testing. High PEI\u2010range compounds (>4.0) were classified as outliers due to the strong likelihood of nonspecificity.

PLpro is a cysteine protease that contains a cysteine in the active site, and these partially irreversible fragments may covalently interact with this residue. Covalently interacting compounds are likely to be nonspecifically reactive and usually have toxicity issues. Therefore, fragment F3 may not be a good candidate, although it was the best enhancer for scaffold B inhibitors (inhibitors 3 and 4). Similarly, these results indicate that fragment F5 may also exhibit problems with irreversibility. Two ligand\u2010efficiency\u2010related indices, binding efficiency index (BEI) and surface binding efficiency index (SEI), were calculated as described.18 BEI relates potency to the molecular weight of each compound, while SEI is an index that monitors the potency gains as polar surface area (PSA) increases. BEI and SEI for these eight fragments and four lead inhibitors were calculated by simple equations: pIC50 divided by M\nr for BEI and pIC50 divided by PSA for SEI.17 The PSA value is an important indicator related to oral bioavailability and intestinal permeability.19 The BEI values of fragments F3, F4, and F7 were >25, suggesting that they are outliers due to the possibility of nonspecific interaction (SI figure S2 c). Fragment F7 contains an aldehyde, which is likely to exhibit nonspecific affinity for the cysteine residue in the catalytic site of the PLpro enzyme. Thus, considering both ligand efficiency indices and enzyme activity recovery rate, fragments F8, F8, F6/F8, and F6 are the best enhancers for inhibitors 1, 2, 3, and 4, respectively.",

            "text": "Although we observed IC50 value enhancement by the fragments through dose\u2013response curves using enzymatic assays, it is possible that the results could be due to nonspecific interactions between the PLpro enzyme and the fragments. Enzyme assays alone can lead to false positives in some cases. To investigate this further, orthogonal binding analyses by surface plasmon resonance (SPR) were performed, and the dissociation equilibrium constants (K\nD), which reflect binding affinity, were determined for each of the four lead inhibitors 1\u20134 and the seven newly identified fragments F2\u2013F8. Fragment F1 was excluded from these studies due to its low IC50 enhancement. The binding affinities of inhibitors 1\u20134 varied between 0.97 and 1.67 \u03bcm as determined by SPR, which were in a range similar to their IC50 values (Table 2 and Figure 2 a). Promisingly, the binding affinities of fragments F2, F6, and F8 were respectively 202, 461, and 437 \u03bcm. The K\nD fitting curve of F8 is shown in Figure 2 b as an example. However, three fragments, F3, F4, and F7, were suspected of forming nonspecific interactions due to their unusually high BEI values as noted above. SPR analyses confirmed that these three fragments, as well as fragment F5, all bind nonspecifically. Fragments F3, F4, and F7 did not show a typical dose\u2013response curve as their concentrations increased; instead, they showed a random binding pattern as shown Figure 2 c for F3. Fragment F5 did show a typical dose\u2013response curve, but SPR response units increased to nearly 4000 RU when its concentration increased to 800 \u03bcm (Figure 2 d). This is likely due to multisite binding caused by aggregation rather than one\u2010to\u2010one interaction with the PLpro enzyme, suggesting that the fragment may bind to many different locations on the PLpro enzyme.",

Prior studies suggested that inhibitors 2 and 3 behave as competitive inhibitors.14\u201315 Two crystal structures with these compounds verify that they bind at the entrance of the catalytic site, blocking substrate access to the site. Although these lead inhibitors do not bind directly to the catalytic site, they nonetheless display competitive inhibition patterns. To thoroughly investigate the inhibition mechanism of both lead inhibitors and fragment compounds, kinetic studies for each compound were performed with the enzyme\u2013inhibitor complexes and varying substrate concentrations. The data were fitted to four equations [Eqs. (2)\u2013(5) in Experimental Section] and three plots (Michaelis\u2013Menten, Lineweaver\u2013Burk, and Dixon), each using SigmaPlot Enzyme kinetics Module 1.3. Akaike information criterion\u2010corrected (AICc) values were used to determine the best fit equation,20 for which the lowest AICc value corresponds to the best fit equation. To determine which equation fits best, the AICc value difference must be at least two units from the next lowest.20 All four previously developed lead inhibitors showed noncompetitive inhibition with unequal binding affinity to free enzyme (E) and substrate\u2010bound enzyme (ES), where the alpha (\u03b1) value is not equal to 1 (Table 2). All four lead inhibitors showed \u03b1 values greater than 1, which indicates the binding affinity to free enzyme is tighter than that of ES. Dixon plots for noncompetitive inhibition of inhibitor 1 (\u03b1=2.6) with respect to the substrate are shown in Figure 3 a, and the resulting K\ni value was 0.42 \u03bcm. All three fragments showed noncompetitive inhibition with different \u03b1 values as well. Fragments F6 and F8 had \u03b1 values greater than 1 (\u03b1>1), indicating that these fragments also behave similarly to the lead inhibitors, although \u03b1 values of these fragments were smaller than those of the lead inhibitors. This may explain why F8 displayed the strongest effect with the three lead inhibitors (1, 2, and 3), whereas fragment F6 exhibited the strongest synergistic effect with scaffold B inhibitors (3 and 4). Dixon plots for noncompetitive inhibition of fragment F8 (\u03b1=1.6) are shown in Figure 3 b, and the K\ni value was determined to be 242 \u03bcm. Because all four lead inhibitors and two fragments showed noncompetitive inhibition with \u03b1>1, it is likely that these compounds bind to another site that is not a catalytic site, hindering substrate binding to the enzyme. Therefore, these studies suggest that it is unlikely that these newly identified fragment\u2010like compounds bind to the catalytic site of the PLpro enzyme.",

Unfortunately this information is insufficient to identify where the fragments bind on the PLpro enzyme. Therefore, we investigated all possible binding site candidates. The unexplored catalytic pocket was designated as candidate fragment binding site 1, although our mechanism of inhibition studies indicated that this location was not likely to be the fragment binding site. To identify additional candidate fragment binding sites, we performed a series of computational solvent mapping experiments, or \u201chot spot\u201d analyses, using the FTMAP server (see Experimental Section).21 FTMAP is a multistage protein mapping algorithm that is based on a fast Fourier transform (FFT) correlation. This approach can efficiently search for potential binding sites on the entire surface of the protein. Two model systems, crystal structures of inhibitor 2 bound to PLpro (PDB ID: 3E9S) and inhibitor 3 bound to PLpro (PDB ID: 3MJ5), were used for the analyses. These two provided representative crystal structures for each compound scaffold. Using 50 ns molecular dynamics (MD) simulations for each system (3E9S, 3MJ5), we determined that the major fluctuations of both structures come from the zinc binding motif and a \u03b2 sheet forming the catalytic triad. Representative snapshot structures were extracted from the simulations as discussed below (see Experimental Section) and submitted to the FTMAP server, which performed a fragment\u2010based binding site analysis. Two strong candidate fragment binding sites were identified by analyzing the original structures and consensus clusters of the probe molecules used (see Experimental Section below). The two hot spots identified by this analysis included an extension of the original binding site of the lead inhibitors and one cavity in the palm region (shown in Figure 4 a). Hot spot 1 was larger than the lead inhibitor binding site and included an additional cavity unoccupied by the lead inhibitors. This binding site has been previously discussed as a possible substrate recognition site.11 This extended cavity is composed of five residues: R167, E168, M209, D303, and T302. The second position identified by FTMAP, hot spot 2, was located >10 \u00c5 away from both the lead inhibitor binding site and the catalytic site of PLpro. It is encompassed by the zinc binding motif and the palm region. Lastly, the small volume containing the catalytic triad (site 1) was not identified by FTMAP, likely due to the smaller size of this pocket.",

More importantly, it appears likely that even if binding of small fragments to this position could cause some degree of conformational changes to these two regions, any structural change would not be likely to affect the lead inhibitor binding site to enhance their IC50 values to the extent observed.

This suggests that the shallow and solvent\u2010exposed binding site 3 is also not an appropriate position for fragment binding. Hence, the site was also removed from consideration, and further analysis of this site was not performed. Additionally, an analysis of the MM/PBSA results (Figure 5, SI tables S1 and S2) revealed that the catalytic site, site 1, was also not a favorable position for fragment binding. The binding free energy values for the inhibitor with fragment F8 at this position were higher than those calculated for the inhibitor alone as well as the experimentally derived results. These results, taken together with the experimental results discussed above, indicate that the catalytic site is most likely not the binding site of the identified synergistic fragments. Favorable results that closely aligned with experimental values were obtained, however, when the fragments were placed at binding site 2 (shown in Figure 6), consistent with synergistic activity. We noted a preference for a positive charge, as observed in the F8 piperazine amine group, to be placed into an anionic pocket of site 2, defined by D303, T302, Y274, and D165, which, in combination with the established binding features of the lead inhibitors, resulted in a clear gain in their calculated binding affinity.
