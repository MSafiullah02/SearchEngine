However, an accurate estimation of progression of spread of the infection and level of preparedness to combat this disease are urgently needed. Using a data-based mathematical model, our study has made predictions on the number of cases that are expected to rise in India till 14 th June 2020. The epidemiological data of daily cases have been utilized from 25 th March (i.e., the first day of lockdown) to 23 rd April 2020. In the study, we have stimulated two possible scenarios (optimistic and pessimistic) for the prediction. As per the optimistic approach of modeling, COVID-19 may end in the first week of June 2020 with a total of 77,900 infected cases including 2,442 fatalities. However, the results under the pessimistic scenario are bit scary.",

As in late December 2019, at Wuhan, some patients were admitted to the hospital and were diagnosed with severe pneumonia of unknown sets of reasons associated with clinical symptoms of high fever, dry cough, and dyspnea. Many of those clusters of people were linked to the Huanan seafood and wet animal market there [9] . Following activating surveillance and further etiologic and epidemiologic investigations of their respiratory samples, China informed this outbreak to the World Health Organization (WHO) on 31 st December 2019 [13] . From the throat swab samples of the affected patients, the causative agent was identified by the Chinese Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (CCDC) on 7 th January 2020 and the virus was named as Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2(SARS-CoV-2) by the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV).

Given the very complex demography (e.g., population density, diversity, belief system), it raised challenges to the government in imposing the sudden restrictions on people to curb the virus spread. However, the Indian government managed to take bold and timely actions such as lockdown and mobility restriction to fight against COVID-19. Thus, considering the current situation in India, projection using a linear growth model is found suitable for this study. Now that India is resuming certain economic activities, it poses further speculations if the cases may rise again due to people's mobility and gathering. Under this circumstance, we considered two scenarios in our analysis; optimistic, and pessimistic. The optimistic scenario indicates that the spread of the virus follows the current trend with a complete lockdown in the infected states. The pessimistic scenario indicates that the growth of spread would be with a higher transmission rate due to people's non-compliance of social distancing norms due to removal or relaxation of lockdown. Thus, according to optimistic models, the COVID-19 pandemic in India will end in the 3rd week of June 2020 with a total of 77,900 cases.",

            "text": "Projection of total deaths in IndiaConclusionWe have estimated the spread of COVID-19 utilizing mathematical models. The data were taken from the very early days of lockdown to specifically examine the impact of lockdown in curbing the disease outbreak. In the current study, we have used different forecasting models under twoscenarios, the first scenario of optimistic approach depicting the progression of infection in the presence of government interventions like social distancing, complete lockdown, public awareness, travel restrictions, and another scenario of a pessimistic approach of the infection progression without (or less) such interventions. By validating all analyses done, if India can manage interventions implemented, the daily infected cases have gradually restrained from mid-May, 2020. Hence, under an optimistic approach, the total number of cases is expected to come down from the 3rd week of May 2020. Results under optimistic conditions confirm the total 77,900 infected cases till 14 th June. However, the results of the pessimistic scenario estimation . The results show that the spread will be quite high in the mid of May. The total case, till 14 th June will reach 283,300. Thus, the complete lockdown (at least in the infected Indian states) and travel restrictions are much needed in the fight against a highly contagious virus like COVID-19 to avoid the pessimistic scenario in the country. It should further be noted that in both scenarios we assumed no local transmission. For a country like India with high population density and poor health care systems, it would be quite impossible to mitigate outbreak without any of such serious laws and steps enacted by both state and central government. The six weeks of lockdown may not be sufficient. Additionally, with more rigid lockdown mass screening, isolation, enforced quarantine and proper medical treatment should be executed meticulously for pandemic mitigation. These predicting models thus provide an insight into the epidemiological status in the country by forecasting the potential propensity of a disease outbreak. Thus on the analytical basis, it would help in the execution as well as manipulation of all current interventions and approaches to combat COVID-19 in India. Our present model signifies the prediction capability of COVID-19 growth in India by considering the effects of interventions (both government and self) as preventive and control measures undertaken since the time of spread. But these models are devoid of the impact of certain biological factors like differential immunity, previous and present health status of person i.e. comorbidities associated and passive immunization status. The physical factors like temperature, humidity, their influence have not been considered in the modeling.",
