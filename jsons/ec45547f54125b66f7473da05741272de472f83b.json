By electron microscopy, it is demonstrated with a typical sphere shape and a diameter of 80-120 nm. Its nucleocapsid is spirally symmetric with envelope. The isolated strain is initially fi lament-like with a diameter of about 20 nm and a length of 300-3,000 nm. Under an electron microscope, hemagglutinin protrudes into a homotrimer composed of three non-covalent combined protein molecules, while neuraminidase is demonstrated as a mushroom-like homotetramer with a head and a stem. The virus is composed of an envelope, matrix protein, and viral core, consecutively from external to internal of the virus.",

All human infl uenza viruses can cause avian infl uenza, but not all avian infl uenza viruses can result in human infl uenza. Among all avian infl uenza viruses, H5, H7, H9, and H3 can infect humans, and H5 is highly pathogenic. Infl uenza virus can be categorized into 135 subtypes by HxNx, including avian infl uenza virus subtype H7N9. It prevailed in birds with no infection of humans. And its biological properties, pathogenicity, and transmissibility largely remain unknown. H7N9 is a new recombinant virus with its genes from avian infl uenza virus H9N2. Currently, it has been found with mutation of PB2 gene at the site of 701. Laboratory experiments have demonstrated that the mutated virus is highly pathogenic to Canidae. Mutation of 627 amino acid site is also possible. Therefore, avian infl uenza virus H7N9 cannot be transmitted from person to person but only from pets or living poultry to person.",

The pathological changes of organs are characterized by diffuse phagocytosis of erythrocytes, leukocytes, and platelets by macrophages, which is known as reactive hemophagocytic syndrome.

However, agglutination inhibition test for chick erythrocytes should be simultaneously performed to exclude nonspecifi c agglutination. Such a test has a positive rate of 26-50 %. The serum antibody detection, commonly by agglutination inhibition test of erythrocytes or complement fi xation test, can be performed simultaneously, with a positive rate of 95 %. Contrast detection should be performed at the early stage and 2 weeks after the onset, and an at least four times increase of the antibody titer has diagnostic value.",
