It is thus vital to regulate the arrival of migrants if we want to achieve their real integration in our culture (Espali\u00fa Berdud 2019).\n",

What is more important, according to me, is to argue that the best way would be to encourage migrants to stay home, preventing massive uncontrolled displacements, is addressing the factors that drive emigration of their own origin countries. To stop unwanted migration, the developed countries must promote a profound democratic and economic stabilization and development. We must always remember that the first right of every human being \u2013after the right to live- is the right not to emigrate and to have the opportunity of living peacefully and prospering in our own home, as Pope Pius XII wrote in the Apostolic Constitution Exsul Familia: \u201cAll men have the right to a family living space in their place of origin\u201d. The right to emigrate is only subsidiary to the main right to have a family living space in the place of origin, when this cannot be assured.",

In 1970, about 2% of the world\u2019s 3.7 billion people lived abroad (UNHCR 2017).

This is why immigration must be orderly, capable of duly regulating the massive arrival of people; otherwise our social protection systems will not resist. The illegal immigration requires proper vetting to identify criminals and terrorists- the crime rates of the foreign immigrant population are significantly higher than those of the natives-, and sometimes, to put in metaphorical terms, surgical excision procedure without anesthesia will frequently induce pain.

Some African prelates within the Catholic Church are calling attention to the most forgotten aspect of this debate: the terrible damage made by a massive escape of young people from countries that desperately need them in their struggle for development. In a book released recently, cardinal Robert Sarah, currently prefect of the Congregation for Divine Worship and the Discipline of the Sacraments,4 declares his personal position on immigration: \u201cAll migrants arriving in Europe are crammed, without work, without dignity. Is this what the Church wants? The Church cannot cooperate in this new form of slavery into which mass immigration has become\u201d (Sarah 2019a, b; Indelicato 2019).",

As De la Concha stresses (2019), a proper management of migration flows requires working as much as possible in cooperation with the countries of origin taking into account, as appropriate, the various causes of migration (economic, security, political prosecution, climate, etc.). Thus, a more ambitious measures are required, such as generating opportunities for the local population and offering fiscal incentives to the investments of European companies in those regions that seem to be condemned to diaspora. This move will also offer new markets for European products and services, as well as opening of EU markets to exports from these countries. And, what is more important, besides of contributing to the economic development of those countries, Europe has to improve their social and political quality of life, which is precisely what they try to find in Europe. Our main objective, therefore, has to be to strength the production base and the creation of jobs in the countries of origin, the provision of basic services (health, education) to the local populations, and the literacy, ensuring that students in their countries have the tools to decide their future and thus avoid the temptation to migrate to Europe, avoiding future victims (De la C\u00e1mara 2019).6 Either we offer them opportunities in their own countries, or they will come to ours looking for them Zalba (2014).",

This attitude would also be \u201cmuch more inexpensive\u201d, as is honestly admitted by Juho Eerola, a Finn of the Nordic Freedom, or by the then Slovak prime minister, Peter Pellegrini, during his first visit to Brussels: \u201cwhat we have to do is to invest in the countries where the problem is originated. Each euro spent in northern Africa is more efficient than 10 spent in the migrants who arrive massively to EU\u201d (Eerola, 13 April 2018). But, there is need to build up conditions to create secure environment within the transit African countries bordering the Mediterranean Sea. The North African governments are responsible for effective and transparent governance aimed at management of emigrants flows through their territories.

All of them have recruitment agents from the main groups that are victims of extortion. A second level is that of the local mafias, who know the land and generally pay the collectors. One more step is that of small-scale service providers: trucks, boats and other means of transport. The most dangerous level is that of the big international mafias, who control the entire process and also add links to large international crime groups and use immigrants as a way to earn money quickly and easily. Infrastructures built for the exploitation of the mineral resources of the desert, oil in Libya and uranium in Niger, facilitate trips through the desert. According to reports from the Spanish Police, Nigeria and Libya are the most active and most established bases of immigration mafias in Central Africa, with ramifications in other countries, where Sudanese mercenaries act unscrupulously.

Perhaps one country may need extra workers and be in position of offering them stable working conditions; but this may not occur in other EU members.
