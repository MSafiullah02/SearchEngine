            "text": "The vaginal microbiota influences sexual transmission of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1). Colonization of the vaginal tract is normally dominated by Lactobacillus species. Both Lactobacillus and Enterococcus faecalis may secrete reutericyclin, which inhibits the growth of a variety of pathogenic bacteria. Increasing evidence suggests a potential therapeutic role for an analogue of reutericyclin, glycerol monolaurate (GML), against microbial pathogens. Previous studies using a macaque vaginal simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) transmission model demonstrated that GML reduces transmission and alters immune responses to infection in vitro. Previous studies showed that structural analogues of GML negatively impact other enveloped viruses. We sought to expand understanding of how GML inhibits HIV-1 and other enveloped viruses and show that GML restricts HIV-1 entry post-CD4 engagement at the step of coreceptor binding. Further, HIV-1 and yellow fever virus (YFV) particles were more sensitive to GML interference than particles \"matured\" by proteolytic processing. We show that highpressure-liquid-chromatography (HPLC)-purified reutericyclin and reutericyclin secreted by Lactobacillus inhibit HIV-1. These data emphasize the importance and protective nature of the normal vaginal flora during viral infections and provide insights into the antiviral mechanism of GML during HIV-1 infection and, more broadly, to other enveloped viruses.",

Reducing the risk of sexually transmitted infections is often centered on barrier contraceptives (1) . While barrier contraceptives reduce the risk of HIV-1 sexual transmission and, presumably, that of other STIs, they are not 100% effective (2, 3) . In addition, many STIs may be asymptomatic, causing significant systemic and reproductive health problems prior to diagnosis or initiation of treatment (4) . Therefore, preventative approaches for STI that do not interfere with sexual norms are critically needed to curtail the estimated 340 million newly acquired STIs each year (5) .",

            "text": "Purified and human milk-derived monoglycerides provide antiviral activity against enveloped viruses, including herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1) and HSV-2, vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV), and visna virus, but are ineffective against nonenveloped picornaviruses, including poliovirus and rhinovirus (18) (19) (20) (21) (22) (23) . Previous studies showed that monoglycerides that are similar to GML inactivate enveloped RNA and DNA viruses (18) (19) (20) (21) (22) . Although the mechanism of action is not well characterized, electron microscopy (EM) of VSV treated with linoleic acid, a polyunsaturated fatty acid, revealed disruption of the viral envelope and of particle integrity (19, 20) . Similar EM results were obtained from treatment of influenza A virus and coronavirus (CoV) infections with a monolaurin mixture (22) . Other studies showed that phage treated with a monoglyceride had altered sedimentation in sucrose gradient centrifugation experiments (21) . These results suggest that the viral envelope may be critical for inactivation (19) (20) (21) . Here, we examined how GML restricts HIV-1 and additional human-pathogenic virus infections in vitro. We show that GML does not interfere with CD4 receptor binding but prevents HIV-1 CXCR4 coreceptor binding. Consistent with previous studies, GML also inhibited enveloped viruses, including mumps virus, yellow fever virus (YFV), and Zika virus, but did not interfere with viral replication of nonenveloped viruses. In YFV infection, promoting envelope maturation reduces sensitivity to GML, consistent with previous findings suggesting that the viral envelope is sensitive to GML inactivation. GML is structurally related to reutericyclin, a compound secreted by Lactobacillus. Reutericyclin inhibits a range of bacterial pathogens (24) , and Lactobacillus-dominated vaginal microenvironments are protective against heterosexual transmission of HIV-1. Our data suggest that reutericyclin produced by Lactobacillus may contribute to protection against heterosexual transmission of HIV-1 (25, 26) . described above. Replication of HIV-1 exposed to GML was significantly reduced (Fig. 3A ). This did not appear to be a result of residual GML, as virus incubated in cytotoxic concentrations (160 g/ml) of GML showed no reduction of cell viability (Fig. 3B ). Reduced infectivity could not be attributed to a reduction in the ability of virus to bind to cells (Fig. 3C) . However, similarly to the previous results, GML-exposed virus had a significant impairment in virus entry (Fig. 3D ). Taken together, these results show that GML interactions with HIV-1 alter viral entry.",

GML treatment of coincubated cells did not significantly reduce cell-cell fusion as measured by the percentages of cells positive for both fluorescent markers ( Fig. 4D and E). Thus, GML does not interfere with HIV-1 gp120 binding to CD4, and GML does not block postbinding fusion. To determine if GML interfered with HIV-1-coreceptor interactions, TZM-bl cells were treated with a CXCR4 inhibitor (AMD3100) 1 h prior to infection, and GML was added at the time of HIV-1 inoculation. Treatment with nontoxic concentrations of GML (\u054540 g/ml; Fig. S2C ) did not increase infectivity inhibition compared to effects seen with the inhibitor alone (Fig. 4F ). The finding that GML did not interfere with CD4 binding (Fig. 2 ) and yet did not influence coreceptor blockade or fusion suggests that GML alters conformational changes in the HIV gp120 trimer structure required for coreceptor binding (Fig. 4F) (32) . To evaluate if GML alters virion binding to the coreceptor, HIV-1 was incubated with soluble CD4 (sCD4) for 2 h at 37\u00b0C to induce the conformational changes required for coreceptor binding (33, 34) . Addition of nontoxic GML (40 g/ml; Fig. S2D ) to sCD4-treated HIV-1 and spinoculation onto HOS CXCR4 \u03e9 CD4 \u03ea cells revealed that GML significantly reduced entry of HIV-1 in CD4-negative cells (Fig. 4G ). Together, these results demonstrate that GML alters HIV-1 replication by restricting viral entry after CD4 binding but before CXCR4 interactions (Fig. 4) .",

The data reported above show that GML targets HIV-1 particles by interfering with early viral life cycle events, consistent with previous studies demonstrating that other enveloped viruses are sensitive to compounds structurally similar to GML (18) (19) (20) (21) (22) . Since virus binding and entry are required for all viral infections, we examined the effect of GML on additional viruses (35) .

            "text": "Envelope maturation mediates viral sensitivity to GML. The inhibitory concentrations differed for mumps virus, yellow fever virus, and Zika viruses. Many enveloped viruses require processing of their envelope glycoproteins to mediate entry (39) . For flaviviruses, a cellular protease (furin) is responsible for proteolytic cleavage of the precursor envelope (prM) proteins. The uncleaved prM conformation prevents viral fusion (40) . Although furin cleavage results in \"maturation\" of virus particles, virus populations consist of a mixture of particles with various degrees of maturation and furin cleavage is not required for all functions of viral envelope proteins (39, 41) . Viruses with a higher proportion of cleaved prM have higher specific infectivity (42) . We hypothesized that GML interaction may be enhanced in \"immature\" flaviviruses on the basis of increased access of GML to the viral envelope and that, by increasing the proportion of mature particles with furin treatment, flaviviruses are rendered more sensitive to GML inhibition. Zika virus was less sensitive to GML than YFV, and furin treatment did not change the GML sensitivity of Zika virus (Fig. 7A ). In contrast, incubation of yellow fever virus in furin increased the IC 50 by 10 g/ml (Fig. 7B) . Similarly, HIV-1 infectivity was increased following incubation in furin, although this increase was more modest (Fig. 7C) . The reduced sensitivity to GML following furin treatment for yellow fever virus and HIV-1 suggests that the maturation state of viral particles is important in GML antiviral activity and that Zika virus prM cleavage was more efficient than YFV cleavage in our production cell lines. The efficiency of Zika virus prM cleavage is currently unknown (43) . Unfortunately, monoclonal antibodies that distinguish mature and immature Zika and YFV particles have not been described, and the available polyclonal antibodies do not distinguish the size differences of PrM and M. Thus, though the data are consistent with the hypothesis that GML access lipids in the YFV immature particles, further studies are needed for confirmation.",

Reutericyclin, a GML analogue, is secreted by isolates of Lactobacillus reuteri as well as Enterococcus faecalis (Fig. 8A and B) . Reutericyclin inhibits a broad spectrum of bacterial organisms, but its inhibitory profile is unreported for viruses (24) . Nevertheless, previous studies found that Lactobacillus reuteri enhances host resistance to viral infections, possibly through regulation of the microenvironment and through the secretion of antiviral metabolites (44) . Incubation of HIV-1 with various dilutions of concentrated reutericyclin-containing media produced by E. faecalis and Lactobacillus reuteri significantly reduced infection at even highly diluted concentrations (Fig. 8C to E) . Media without the microbe or conditioned media in the presence of a non-reutericyclinproducing strain of Lactobacillus plantarum served as controls (Fig. 8C to E) . Media without bacteria and conditioned media from non-reutericyclin-producing Lactobacillus plantarum were noncytotoxic and also reduced infection, though conditioned media from reutericyclin-producing microbes inhibited HIV-1 to a significantly greater extent ( Fig. S3A and B) . Reduced infection by our controls indicated that microbe growth media may contain inhibitory components and that Lactobacillus may produce other HIV-1-inhibitory metabolites. Others have reported non-reutericyclin-based mechanisms of Lactobacillus-mediated inhibition of HIV-1, including secretion of other anti- (24, 25) . Because reutericyclin-containing media from bacterial secretions contain additional metabolites, high-pressure-liquid-chromatography (HPLC)purified reutericyclin was used to validate the HIV-1-inhibitory effect of reutericyclin. HPLC-purified reutericyclin was noncytotoxic (Fig. S3B) and inhibited HIV-1 infection by 40% to 50% (Fig. 8F) , suggesting that reutericyclin is an effective inhibitory factor against HIV-1 and supporting the observation that Lactobacillus-dominated vaginal microenvironments are protective against HIV-1. We hypothesize that microbeproduced reutericyclin is more inhibitory than HPLC-purified reutericyclin due to the secretion of additional antiviral factors in the media. Others have reported antimicrobial properties of reutericin and reuterin secreted by Lactobacillus reuteri, though antiviral effects (45) (46) (47) have not been studied. These results support the hypothesis that Lactobacillus may secrete inhibitory factors in addition to contributing other protective functions such as maintenance of vaginal pH (48) .",

Our data provide new insights into the mechanism of action of GML. Incubation of permissive cells with GML or its analogue reutericyclin at the time of infection inhibited HIV-1. Although the inhibition was due partly to a reduction in virus binding to CD4 \u03e9 , the major step of the HIV-1 life cycle inhibited by GML was viral entry following CD4 \u03e9 binding. Our data show that GML prevents virion binding to the coreceptor (Fig. 9 ). In addition to the antiviral mechanism of GML against virus replication, other studies found that GML also blocks immune signaling (14, 16) . Thus, it is likely that GML inhibits HIV-1 and other viruses by multiple mechanisms.",

An unpublished study (PMS) found that administration of a 5% GML gel nasally to 50 individuals did not produce any adverse effects.

            "text": "GML is an analogue to Lactobacillus-secreted reutericyclin. The normal flora of the vaginal tract is dominated by Lactobacillus and protective against HIV-1. Lactobacillus species may prevent infection through the secretion of antiviral factors, by maintenance of an acidic vaginal pH that inactivates virions, and by disruption of virion binding to cell surface molecules (25, 50) . Our data suggest that reutericyclin released by Lactobacillus may be a secreted factor that contributes to the protective effect induced by reutericyclin-expressing bacteria. Although reutericyclin is known to inhibit bacteria, no previous reports have shown activity against viruses (24) . There are structural similarities between GML and reutericyclin, and these may provide insights into the inhibitory action and facilitate the development of more efficacious derivatives. The importance of fatty acid chain length and head group polarity with respect to virus inhibition is not yet known. Similar studies showed that 12-carbon lauric acid was the most effective of various carbon chain lengths at inhibiting Junin virus and vesicular stomatitis virus. However, those groups concluded that lauric acid disrupted maturation, a late viral life cycle event, rather than early life cycle events (51, 52) . Others showed that HIV-1, HSV, and hepatitis C virus are inhibited by contact with mediumchain saturated and long-chain unsaturated fatty acids and 1-monoglycerides of medium-chain and long-chain fatty acids. These fatty acids and their derivatives disrupted the viral envelope, suggesting an early effect (19, (53) (54) (55) . Therefore, the fatty acid chains of GML and reutericyclin may be more important than the polarity of the head group during enveloped virus inhibition. In the absence of GML, HIV-1 gp120 binding to CD4 induces conformational changes that facilitate gp120 binding to the coreceptor (CXCR4). Coreceptor binding triggers exposure of gp41 and fusion of viral and cellular membranes. Our data show that HIV-1 gp120 binds CD4 in the presence of GML but that binding to the coreceptor is inhibited, resulting in reduced fusion/entry. References to the included experimental results shown in the other figures are given in parentheses.",
