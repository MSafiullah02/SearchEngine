Although pederin has weak antibacterial properties, it is severely toxic to eukaryotic cells. This property likely stems from its ability to block protein synthesis and cell division. There is significant evidence indicating that pederin is synthesized by a bacterial symbiont of host beetles, perhaps a close relative to P. aeruginosa [10] .

The basic synthetic strategy involves an alteration of the previously published methodology [13, 14] . The conjugation method to produce total mycalamide required the activation of pederate, the left portion of the molecule, with p-toluenesulfonyl chloride/DMAP/dichloromethane at room temperature followed by treatment with the amines produced by hydrogenation of azides.

One key step in the method is the mismatched aldol reaction of the imide and aldehyde. This step yielded a ca. 5:4 mixture of two isomeric aldols, with incorrect C-7 stereochemistry. Enrichment of the isomeric mixture to mycalamide A required epimerization of C-7 at the beta-keto imide step.

[47] from marine sponge Psammocina species and Crews et al. [46] from Ircinia ramose species in 2004. It has been recently documented that psymberin is rather produced by the symbiotic bacteria associated with the marine sponges and not by marine sponges themselves [10] . Psymberin structural features closely resemble that of other pederin family members including mycalamide A. In general, psymberin lacks the commonly present acetal-containing pederate side chain, but is identified with a dihydroisocoumarin unit that is not widely found with other members of pederin family. The activity of pysmberin on various human cancer cell lines is listed in Table 32 .1. Out of the 60 cell lines tested, psymberin displayed a differential cytotoxicity profile and was more potent against colon cancer, melanoma and breast cancer cell lines. Several research groups have attempted to synthesize this fascinating marine drug owing to its complex structure, limited natural abundance and biological properties [59] . Huang et al. reported several analogues of psymberin which were constructed by modifying the tetradhydropyran ring core of psymberin. All the analogues (1, 1A, 1B, 1C) were biologically tested using major human cancer cell lines to identify their IC 50 values (Table 32. 3). Compound 1 (C11-Deoxypsymberin) was found to be most potent of all the analogues and its potency was 3 to 10 fold more compared to psymberin or its epimer [57] .

Psymberin and its two epimers 8-epipsymebrin and 4-epipsymberin exhibited meaningful IC 50 values whose values were relatively lower when compared to the two hybrids that were synthesized with a dimethoxy unit instead of dihydroisocoumarin unit. The structural variations of psymberin and its epimers when compared with the two hybrids indicate that retention of dihydroisocoumarin unit is essential for the biological activity of psymberin [70] . Furthermore, it was revealed that structural alterations of psymberin could result in decreased cellular uptake of these compounds in HeLa cells compared to psymberin [70] . After incubation of HeLa cells with 100 nM of psymberin and its epimers, the intra-cellular concentration of psymberinepimers (4-epi & 8-epi) was about 20-fold less than pysmberin and the intra-cellular concentration of psympederin was below the limit of detection [70] . The same study [70] employing forward genetic screen in C. elegans identified that ribosome was the primary target for psymberin and also demonstrated that in contrast to other pederins, psymberin does not exhibit blistering activity due to the absence of acetal group. Most recently, Pietruszka group synthesized 8-desmethoxy pysmberin, a putative biosynthetic precursor of psymberin in 25 steps whose biological activity is yet to be determined [58] . Psymberin exhibits very potent antiproliferative activity against a wide selection of human tumor cell lines including KM12, PC3, SK-MEL-5, and T98G with IC 50 at range 0.45-2.29 nM [46] . The data pertinent to differential sensitivities of various cell lines to psymberin is summarized in Table 32 .2.
