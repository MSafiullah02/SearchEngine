The ability to internally regulate body temperature is known as endothermy and is a characteristic of all mammals\nand birds. The thermoregulatory system consists of an afferent sensory limb, a central\nprocessing center, and an efferent response limb. In humans, the central processing center controlling the\nthermoregulatory set-point is the hypothalamus. Both warm-sensitive and cold-sensitive thermoreceptors are involved in\nthe afferent limb. Stimulation of the cold-sensitive receptors activates efferent responses relayed via the hypothalamus\nthat reduce heat loss and increase heat production. These responses include reducing blood flow to the peripheries and\nincreasing heat production by mechanisms including shivering. Conversely, stimulation of warm-sensitive receptors\nultimately increases heat loss through peripheral vasodilation and evaporative cooling caused by sweating.",

            "text": "In patients with sepsis, the febrile response involves innate immune system activation via Toll-like receptor 4\n(TLR-4). This activation leads to production of pyrogenic cytokines including interleukin (IL)-1\u03b2, IL-6,\nand tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-\u03b1. These pyrogenic cytokines act on an area of the brain known as the organum vasculosum\nof the laminae terminalis (OVLT) leading to the release of prostaglandin E2\n(PGE2) via activation of the enzyme cyclo-oxygenase-2 (COX-2). PGE2 binds\nto receptors in the hypothalamus leading to an increase in heat production and a decrease in heat loss until the\ntemperature in the hypothalamus reaches a new, elevated, set-point. Once the new set-point is attained, the hypothalamus\nmaintains homeostasis around this new set-point by the same mechanisms involved in the regulation of normal body\ntemperature. However, in addition, there are a number of important specific negative feedback systems in place that\nprevent excessive elevation of body temperature. One key system is the glucocorticoid system, which acts via nuclear\nfactor-kappa B (NF-\u03baB) and activator protein-1 (AP-1). Both these mediators have anti-inflammatory properties and\ndownregulate the production of pyrogenic cytokines, such as IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, and TNF-\u03b1. The febrile response is further\nmodulated by specific antipyretic cytokines including IL-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1RA), IL-10, and TNF-\u03b1 binding protein.",

In addition, the heat shock proteins (HSPs) provide intrinsic resistance to thermal\ndamage. Genes encoding the HSPs probably first evolved more than 2.5 billion years ago. They represent an important\nsystem providing protection to cells, not only against extremes of temperature, but also against other potentially lethal\nstresses including toxic chemicals and radiation injury. During heat-stress, transcription and translation of HSPs is\nupregulated. HSPs can then trigger refolding of heat-damaged proteins preserving them until heat-stress has passed or, if\nnecessary, can transport denatured proteins to organelles for intracellular degradation. As well as providing protection\nagainst cellular damage from the thermal stress induced by fever, the HSPs may themselves be important regulators of the\nfebrile response. For example, HSP 70 inhibits pyrogenic cytokine production via NF-\u03baB. HSPs also inhibit programmed cell\ndeath, which might otherwise be induced by an invading pathogen.",

Human\nneutrophil cell motility and phagocytosis are enhanced by temperatures in the febrile range, and growth of intracellular\nbacteria in human macrophages in vitro is reduced by temperatures in the febrile range\ncompared to normal temperatures. Murine macrophages demonstrate a range of enhanced functions at temperatures in the\nfebrile range. These effects include enhanced expression of the Fc receptors that are involved in mediating antibody\nresponses, and enhanced phagocytosis. Temperatures in the physiological febrile range enhance binding of human\nlymphocytes to the vascular endothelium. This L-selectin-mediated binding is important in facilitating lymphocyte\nmigration to sites of tissue inflammation or infection. In mice, T lymphocyte-mediated killing of virus-infected cells is\nincreased by temperatures in the febrile range and helper T-cell potentiation of antibody responses is enhanced. In\ncontrast to other cells of the immune system, the cytotoxic activity of natural killer cells is reduced by temperatures\nin the febrile range compared to normal body temperature.

The febrile response can be blocked by inhibition\nof COX in a diverse range of species including desert iguanas [11] and\nbluegill sunfish [12], as well as higher animals like humans. As COX catalyzes\nthe generation of prostaglandins from arachidonic acid, this suggests that the pivotal role of PGE2\nin the regulation of the thermostatic set-point may be preserved in these species as well as in higher animals. Such\na common biochemical mechanism to regulate fever across such a diverse group of animals raises the possibility that the\nfebrile response may have evolved in a common ancestor. If this is the case, then fever probably emerged as an evolutionary\nresponse more than 350 million years ago [13]. As the febrile response comes\nat a significant metabolic cost [4, 5], its persistence across such a broad range of species provides strong circumstantial\nevidence that the response has some evolutionary advantage. Furthermore, given that the response appears ubiquitous, it\nlogically follows that the components of the immune system would have evolved to function optimally in the physiological\nfebrile range.",

Although the administration of aspirin significantly increased the shedding of\nrhinovirus in these trials, only one of the 45 patients developed fever so this increase in shedding was probably not\nattributable to the antipyretic effect of aspirin [21]. A similar study of\n60 volunteers inoculated with rhinovirus and randomized to aspirin, paracetamol, ibuprofen, or placebo showed that the\nuse of either aspirin or paracetamol was associated with suppression of the serum antibody response and a rise in\ncirculating monocytes [22]. There were no significant differences in viral\nshedding among the four groups. However, the subjects treated with aspirin or paracetamol had a significant increase\nin nasal symptoms and signs compared to the placebo group [22]. In\nrhinovirus-infected volunteers treated with pseudoephedrine, the addition of ibuprofen had no effect on symptoms or on\nviral shedding or viral titers [23]. Again, only two of the 58 subjects\ndeveloped a fever. A randomized controlled trial of children aged six months to six years with presumed non-bacterial\ninfection and a fever of \u2265 38 \u00b0C demonstrated that administration of paracetamol increased the children\u2019s activity but\nnot their mood, comfort or appetite [24].",

However, there are historical examples of dramatic responses to\ntreatment with therapeutic hyperthermia in some infectious diseases. It has been known since the time of Hippocrates\nthat progressive paralysis due to neurosyphilis sometimes resolves after an illness associated with high fever. This\nobservation led Julius Wagner-Jauregg to propose, in 1887, that inoculation of malaria might be a justifiable therapy\nfor patients with \u2018progressive paralysis\u2019. His rationale was that one could substitute an untreatable condition for\na treatable one \u2013 malaria being treatable with quinine. In 1917, he tested his hypothesis in nine patients with\nparalysis due to syphilis by injecting them with blood from patients suffering from malaria. Three of the patients had\nremission of their paralysis. This led to further experiments and clinical observations on more than a thousand\npatients with remission occurring in 30 % of patients with neurosyphilis-related progressive paralysis \u2018treated\u2019 with\nfever induced by malaria compared to spontaneous remission rates of only 1 %. This work on fever therapy led to Julius\nWagner-Jauregg being awarded the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1927 [25]. Subsequently, fever therapy was shown to be effective in treating\ngonorrhea. Inducing a hyperthermia of 41.7 \u00b0C for six hours in the \u2018Kettering hypertherm chamber\u2019 led to cure in 81 %\nof cases [26].",

In these studies, the presence of fever was\nassociated with either an increased risk of death [30, 39\u201341] or no difference in mortality\nrisk compared to a normal temperature [34]. Only two studies have\nevaluated the mortality risk of patients with sepsis separately from patients without sepsis [33, 35].

The primary endpoint was the proportion of patients with\na 50 % decrease in vasopressor use at 48 hours after randomization. There was no significant difference\nbetween the treatment groups for the primary endpoint, which was achieved in 72 % of the patients assigned\nto external cooling and 61 % of the patients assigned to standard care. This study had a large number of\nsecondary endpoints including mean body temperature, the proportion of patients who achieved 50 % reduction\nin vasopressors at 2 hours, 12 hours, 24 hours, and 36 hours as well as day-14, ICU, and hospital mortality. The\nsecondary endpoints generally favored external cooling and day-14 mortality was noted to be significantly lower in\nthe external cooling group (19 % vs. 34 %; p = 0.0013). This difference in mortality was not evident\nby the time of ICU or hospital discharge and caution should be exerted in interpreting these endpoints as it is\npossible that they were affected by a type 1 error due to a lack of statistical power.",

Patients assigned to the aggressive treatment arm received regular\nparacetamol once the temperature exceeded 38.5 \u00b0C and physical cooling was added when the temperature exceeded\n39.5 \u00b0C. Patients assigned to the permissive treatment arm received paracetamol and cooling when the temperature\nreached 40 \u00b0C. This trial originally aimed to enroll 672 patients; however, it was stopped by the Data Safety\nMonitoring Board after enrolment of 82 patients due to a trend towards increased mortality in the aggressive\ntreatment group. While all deaths were attributed to septic causes, conventional stopping rules were not used and\ndifferences between the study treatment arms could be due to chance. This study had other major limitations\nincluding a lack of blinding or placebo-control, and potential confounding from the uncontrolled use of other\nantipyretic drugs and per-protocol use of external cooling. A similar open-label randomized study enrolled\n26 febrile ICU patients and assigned them to aggressive or permissive temperature management [48]. In this study, the aggressive fever control group received paracetamol 650 mg\nenterally every 6 hours when the temperature was \u2265 38.3 \u00b0C and received physical cooling for temperature\n\u2265 39.5 \u00b0C. The permissive group did not receive paracetamol until the temperature was \u2265 40 \u00b0C and did not receive\nphysical cooling until the temperature reached \u2265 40.5 \u00b0C. All patients assigned to aggressive temperature\nmanagement had an infectious etiology of fever and 75 % of patients assigned to the permissive management\narm had an infectious etiology at baseline. The 28-day all cause mortality was not significantly different between\nthe two groups.",

The conservation of a metabolically\ncostly response across a broad range of animal species suggests that the response probably has an evolutionary\nadvantage. There are some interesting historical examples of hyperthermia being employed to treat infectious\ndiseases. However, in the modern era the relevance of these examples is questionable. Furthermore, arguments based on\nthe evolutionary importance of the febrile response do not necessarily apply to critically ill patients who are, by\ndefinition, supported beyond the limits of normal physiological homeostasis. Humans are not adapted to critical\nillness. In the absence of modern medicine and intensive care, most critically ill patients with fever and infection\nwould presumably die. Among critically ill patients, it is biologically plausible that there is a balance to be struck\nbetween the potential benefits of reducing metabolic rate that come with fever control and the potential risks of\na deleterious effect on host defense mechanisms. Remarkably, at present, we do not know what effect treating fever in\ncritically ill patients with infections has on patient-centered outcomes. These treatments include commonly used\ninterventions such as paracetamol and physical cooling. This area of research is of high priority given the global\nepidemiology of fever in critically ill patients and the generalizability of the candidate interventions.",
