We collected the data over 23 days, from January 21 to February 12, 2020. The dataset is multilingual, prevailing English, Spanish, and Portuguese. We include a new variable created from other four variables; it is called \"type\" of tweets, which is useful for showing the diversity of tweets and the dynamics of users on Twitter. The dataset comprises seven databases which can be analysed separately. On the other hand, they can be crossed to set other researches, among them, trends and relevance of different topics, types of tweets, the embeddedness of users and their profiles, the retweets dynamics, hashtag analysis, as well as to perform social network analysis. This dataset can attract the attention of researchers related to different fields on knowledge, such as data science, social science, network science, health informatics, tourism, infodemiology, and others.",

[3] collected 6.25M tweets regarding the Zika outbreak for 12 weeks (three months). More recently, Cinelli et al.

Another example in another field of knowledge is the data on olympic-themed tweets, with 21.2M tweets collected over four months [5] . Fig. 1 shows the daily distribution of the downloaded Twitter posts. It is possible to appreciate that the process of downloading data retrieved some tweets from 13-Jan-2020. It is worth mentioning that the amount of information that we could gather depended on two factors: (1) The increasing discussion of the topic on Twitter, and (2) The times in which the code for downloading the data was run. When we started to see the quantity of information on Twitter, the code was run as much as possible. This way, the trend in Fig. 1 shows that there was increasing attention on the topic on Twitter.",

This dataset has been created in line with Twitter's Terms & Conditions [6] ; none of the databases contains the text of the collected tweets. Table 1 shows the name of each database and a brief description of its variables. It is worth mentioning that all the databases contain the variable \"status_id\", which can be used to join them. This way, the Mendeley dataset can be further applied to cross databases and, thus, analyse different topics. It will depend on the objective of the analysis, or the researchers' interests. If you have further questions about the dataset in Table 1 or you need more information about the raw variable, please contact us. Furthermore, through the \"status_id\" variable, it is possible to hydrated Twitter content using the Twitter APIs, and thus to get all the information related to the IDs. In the database \"02.Type.Tweets\", a new variable was created based on other four variables which are not included in the dataset; but in the downloaded data they were: \"is_retweet\", \"reply_to_status_id\", \"mentions_screen_name\", and \"reply_to_user_id\". Since a user can tweet different messages with different characteristics, each one of the posts was classified in one of four categories, based on the following: 1. Tw, this was used for original tweets, when the post did not include any mention; 2. MT, this was created when the user mentioned other users within the tweet; 3. RT: Retweets, this category was used for those tweets which retweet one post and; 4. Re: Replies, this type of tweets were created when one user replied to another one.",

This way, first, we excluded the posts whose type was \"3. RT\" (see Fig. 2 ); thus, 3,928,380 tweets (43.73%) were retained. We found that almost 60% of the Twitter posts contained a link; the tweets that quote other tweets are also included. Links were more used in the types 1. Tw, and 2. MT (Fig. 3) . In the case of media, we conversely found that a considerable proportion (79%) of the tweets did not contain any kind of media (pictures, gifs, video, etc.). Twitter posts with media were more used in type 1. Tw (Fig. 4) . Further information can be found in this database, which includes: the number of retweets received in each tweet; in this case, 75.7% of the 3,928,380 tweets did not receive any retweet. Also, it includes the complete URL to each post, the URL for the external links, as well as the URL for media. ",
