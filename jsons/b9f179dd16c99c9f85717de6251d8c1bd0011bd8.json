            "text": "We report detection and full-genome characterization of a novel orthopoxvirus (OPXV) responsible for a fatal infection in a cat. The virus induced skin lesions histologically characterized by leukocyte infiltration and eosinophilic cytoplasmic inclusions. Different PCR approaches were unable to assign the virus to a defined OPXV species. Large amounts of typical brick-shaped virions, morphologically related to OPXV, were observed by electron microscopy. This OPXV strain (Italy_09/17) was isolated on cell cultures and embryonated eggs. Phylogenetic analysis of 9 concatenated genes showed that this virus was distantly related to cowpox virus, more closely related to to ectromelia virus, and belonged to the same cluster of an OPXV recently isolated from captive macaques in Italy. Extensive epidemiologic surveillance in cats and rodents will assess whether cats are incidental hosts and rodents are the main reservoir of the virus. The zoonotic potential of this novel virus also deserves further investigation. O rthopoxviruses (OPXVs; family Poxviridae, subfamily Chordopoxvirinae, genus Orthopoxvirus) are complex, double-stranded DNA viruses with ongoing interest because of their potential use as bioterrorism agents and in gene therapy. Variola virus (VARV), the causative agent of smallpox, has been eradicated in nature; however, there is still the possibility of accidental or intentional release, and it is currently classified as a category A biologic agent (1) . Another concern is the zoonotic potential of some OPXVs, such as monkeypox virus, camelpox virus, buffalopox virus, and cowpox virus (CPXV) (2, 3) .",

The mean coverage of the assembled contigs was 61\u00d7. The 9 open reading frames (A7L, A10L, A24R, D1R, D5R, E6R, E9L, H4L, and J6R) used for OPXV characterization were mapped in contig 1, and their sequences (total 27,228 nt) were concatenated and aligned with concatenated cognate sequences of selected OPXVs. In addition, because the HA gene of 2 feline-derived human virus isolates was available in the sequence databases, we performed an alignment based on the HA gene. We conducted phylogenetic analysis on the basis of the 9 concatenated sequences by using Bayesian inference. Posterior probabilities percentages were consistently high (>90%) for all clades on phylograms, which supported inferred phylogenetic relationships. In the consensus phylogenetic tree (Figure 3 ), we found that strain Italy_09/17 was distantly related to other OPXVs, including all 10 CPXV lineages (39) and other recently identified, deep-branching OPXVs (40, 41) and displayed a closer relatedness with ECTV prototypes, albeit forming a separate cluster. This cluster also included strain Abatino, which was recently isolated from a poxvirus outbreak in a captive colony of Tonkean macaques in Italy (42) . Nucleotide identity of strain Italy_09/17 with strain Abatino was 99.66% and identity with reference ECTVs was 98.11%-98.13%. Higher nucleotide identities were found among ECTVs (99.97%-99.99%) and between VARV-Garcia1966 (variola minor) and VARV-India1967 (variola major) (99.68%). Thus, on the basis of current OPXV criteria of species demarcation, the cat and macaque isolates should be considered prototypes of a novel OPXV. Also, for the HA gene, strain Italy_09/17 appeared more closely related to strain Abatino (99.79% nt identity) than to feline-derived human OPXV strains (95.83%-95.99% nt identity) that were identified in Italy in 2009, for which a full-length genome and concatenated genes used for species demarcation using phylogeny are not available (43) .",

These 2 viruses had lower genetic identity with ECTV than that observed with reference ECTVs and between variola minor virus and variola major virus.

In addition, the zoonotic potential of the feline ECTV-like OPXV deserves an indepth investigation.
