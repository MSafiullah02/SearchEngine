For example, the \u2018Worldometer\u2019 provides a real-time update on the actual number of people known to have COVID-19 worldwide, including daily new cases of the disease, disease distribution by countries and severity of disease (recovered, critical condition or death) (https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/). Johns Hopkins University\u2019s Center for Systems Science and Engineering has also developed a real-time tracking map for following cases of COVID-19 across the world, using the data collected from US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the World Health Organization (WHO), the European Center for Disease Prevention and Control, the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention (China CDC) and the Chinese website DXY, which aggregates data from China\u2019s National Health Commission and the China CDC (https://gisanddata.maps.arcgis.com/apps/opsdashboard/index.html#/bda7594740fd40299423467b48e9ecf6).",

Similarly, using the WHO International Health Regulations, the State Parties Self-Assessment Annual Reporting Tool, Joint External Evaluation reports and the Infectious Disease Vulnerability Index, Gilbert et al. assessed the preparedness and vulnerability of African countries in battling against COVID-19; this would help raise awareness of the respective health authorities in Africa to better prepare for the viral outbreak9.",

In Singapore, the government has partnered with WhatsApp (owned by Facebook) to allow the public to receive accurate information about COVID-19 and government initiatives (https://www.form.gov.sg/#!/5e33fa3709f80b00113b6891). Multiple social-media platforms (e.g., Facebook and Twitter) are currently used by healthcare agencies to provide \u2018real-time\u2019 updates and clarify uncertainties with the public. Additionally, some facial-recognition companies (e.g., SenseTime and Sunell) have adopted the thermal imaging\u2013enabled facial recognition to identify people with an elevated temperature at various screening points in China (https://apnews.com/PR%20Newswire/354aae0738073bc95331ee72a458cb50).",

The need to provide access to accurate and low-cost tests for the diagnosis of COVID-19 is a challenge. Many peripheral hospitals in China and other developing countries in Asia, the Middle-East and Africa do not have the tests or resources to accurately distinguish COVID-19 from the \u2018common flu\u2019. In Indonesia, which has only two reported case thus far, despite substantial exposure to Chinese tourists (Bali had 1.2 million Chinese tourists in 2019), health authorities decided against testing the 243 returning but asymptomatic citizens from Wuhan because of cost of the test (the reagent was quoted as costing nearly US$75,000). Alternative diagnostic and screening tests for COVID-19 will be extremely useful. In this context, China has large datasets of cases positive for COVID-19 (>70,000 cases). These are ideal datasets for deep AI and deep learning (https://www.wired.com/story/chinese-hospitals-deploy-ai-help-diagnose-covid-19/). Such AI algorithms can then be used as an initial screening tool for suspected cases (e.g., travel history to China, Iran or South Korea, or exposure to confirmed cases) so that patients at higher risk could have confirmatory laboratory-based tests or be isolated.",

AI algorithms could be developed to help physicians triage patients with COVID-19 into potentially three groups: the 80% who have mild disease; the 15% who have moderate disease; and the 5% who have severe disease, including those at high risk of mortality. Finally, AI can also facilitate the discovery of novel drugs with which to treat COVID-19.",

The initial reaction in many countries is for healthcare facilities to reduce or even cease many clinical services, including closure of clinics and postponement of medical appointments or elective surgeries. However, such strategies cannot be sustained indefinitely if the COVID-19 pandemic extends beyond 6 months.",

This would ensure that patients continue to receive standard clinical care while reducing physical crowding of patients into hospital premises. For other key hospital activities (e.g., research and education), virtual e-learning platforms are increasingly being explored to eliminate physical meetings.",

Additionally, phone-based software that detects and records patients\u2019 data (e.g., daily temperature and symptoms) may prevent unnecessary hospital consultations for patients with mild flu-like symptoms.

There is also a longer-term goal. The immediate use and successful application of digital technology to tackle a major, global public-health challenge in 2020 will probably increase the public and governmental acceptance of such technologies for other areas of healthcare, including chronic disease in the future. As the saying goes, \u2018a crisis provides an opportunity\u2019; this first great crisis of 2020 provides a great opportunity for digital technology.",
