The 31st ICAR was held at the Alf\u00e2ndega Conference Center in Porto, Portugal, from June 11\u201315, 2018. As in previous years (Andrei et al., 2017; Vere Hodge, 2013, 2014, 2015, 2017), the meeting provided an interdisciplinary forum at which investigators involved in basic, translational, and clinical research worldwide met to review recent developments in all areas of antiviral research, drug and vaccine development. The overarching goal of the conference is to drive the discovery of new antiviral therapies by fostering collaboration among scientists from the fields of basic virology, medicinal chemistry, pharmacology, animal models of disease and toxicology in academia and the pharmaceutical industry.",

Genomics and proteomics are helping the identification of host factors as new targets for drug development, and cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) and tomography offer unprecedented, high-resolution images of virus particles. This year, ICAR recognized the need to discuss this revolution with a special session on Recent Technological Advances. How mutagenesis of the human genome may be used to decipher virus entry, or an excellent introductory lecture on cryo-electron microscopy and image reconstruction were among the highlights of this year's conference. Similarly, how new expertise may be applied to understand and predict the evolution of virus infections further recognized the role of new strategies to address long-standing unresolved questions.",

For transplantation of a solid organ, the provision of an organ by a HCMV-positive donor (D+) to a HCMV-negative recipient (R-) results in the greatest chance of disease, of which viral load above a certain titer is the greatest predictor (the threshold concept). Paul presented the idea of viral peak shift \u2013 if a vaccine can shift the time when the peak viral titer occurs, then it can shift the onset of disease, and thus allow time for antiviral therapy to treat the virus before it turns into problematic and sometimes fatal disease.",

Lysis of infected cells prior to shedding?). Paul's final thoughts revolved around the development of anti-HCMV drugs.

Especially challenging, from the chemistry viewpoint, is the design of NDP and NTP prodrugs, for which the specific and selective removal of up to three or four masking groups, respectively, next to the phosphate anhydride bonds had to be achieved. It was expected that nucleophiles (e.g. intracellular water) would attack the phosphorus atom, leading to cleavage of the anhydride bond in fully masked NDPs and NTPs. The key idea of Chris's approach to avoid undesired cleavage was to keep the negative charge on the \u03b1- (for NDPs) or \u03b1- and \u03b2-phosphate (for NTPs) moieties, so that a nucleophile would not attack that position, due to electrostatic repulsion. This would lead to increased chemical stability of the phosphate anhydride bonds in the prodrugs of NDP and NTP prodrugs.",

            "text": "The ultimate challenge was the design and synthesis of NTP prodrugs, the so-called TriPPPro-approach (Fig. 1C). Two different routes -- phosphoramidite and H-phosphonate chemistries -- were used for the synthesis of target TriPPPro-compounds in good yields. As in the DiPPro-approach, TriPPPro-compounds bear two lipophilic groups at the terminal phosphate moiety (Gollnest et al., 2015, 2016). One can easily play with the masking groups, in order to tune lipophilicity and stability of the prodrug molecules. Longer alkyl chains increase the lipophilicity of the molecules, to compensate for the negative charges on the \u03b1- and \u03b2-phosphate moieties, and also enhance stability. Enzymatic hydrolysis of TriPPPro-compounds using porcine liver esterase (PLE) showed a selective formation of NTPs (Fig. 1D). Formation of the triphosphates was furthermore proven in primer-extension assays. Finally, Chris demonstrated several examples of TriPPPro-compounds derived from well-known antiviral agents, such as ddC (zalcitabine), d4T (stavudine), abacavir, and sofosbuvir. For example, the d4TTP-prodrug (stavudine triphosphate prodrug) was shown to release the active metabolite, d4TTP, and exhibited very good anti-HIV activity in TK-deficient cells. In studies in mice, application of a TriPPPro-derivative based on the sofosbuvir nucleoside led to a two-fold increase in the concentration of the corresponding triphosphate in the liver, compared to sofosbuvir.",

She began her talk by describing the breadth and attributes of dengue viral (DENV) and chikungunya (CHIKV) infections, which largely impact neglected populations. Of note, vector-borne diseases are estimated to account for 17% of all infectious diseases, with one million deaths per year. They are spreading largely due to the influences of modern life, including significant travel by up to 2 billion people each year, and increased niches that lead to mosquito breeding. These diseases are both endemic and epidemic. There are 65 million cases of dengue per year in Africa, and this year, Kenya is experiencing an outbreak of CHIKV. In Kenya alone, 10\u201320% of the children are exposed to DENV and CHIKV, though not all develop disease. Desiree noted the tremendous need for antivirals and vaccines to treat and prevent dengue and chikungunya disease as well as continued efforts to increase awareness and reduce breeding grounds for mosquitos.",

The first is comprised of acutely ill children 1\u201317 years old (10 recruited per site per week) seen at illness onset and one month later. About 50% were also positive for malaria. The second cohort contains approximately 500 healthy children aged 1\u201312 years at each study site, visited every 6 months. Since the inception of the study, 5% of cases of fever were due to DENV infection and 3% were due to CHIKV infection. There is a stable source of virus in these communities, and outside of outbreaks, the incidence of disease is equal across all ages. However, during outbreaks the incidence of disease increases with increasing age, probably due to human movement. It was noted that both diseases have long-term effects. Of note, dengue patients are fully recovered at 1 month postinfection, and fare worse with malaria coinfection (Vu et al., 2017).",

Restriction factors are host antiviral proteins that counteract or \u2018restrict\u2019 viral replication, and are considered a first line of defense against viruses or other incoming pathogens. Sterile-alpha-motif-and-histidine-aspartate-domain-containing protein 1 (SAMHD1) is a member of a unique group of restriction factors that limit retroviral replication at distinct stages of the viral life cycle (Ballana and Este, 2015). HIV-2 Vpx induces degradation of SAMHD1 by targeting it to the proteasome through addition of ubiquitin (Ub), bypassing SAMHD1 viral restriction. SAMHD1 is tightly linked to cell-intrinsic innate immune responses that direct antiviral defenses by triggering interferon (IFN) production and to the regulation of the cell cycle and cell proliferation (Fig. 2\n). Phosphorylation of SAMHD1 by cyclin-dependent kinases (CDK) is associated with deactivation of the restriction activity on HIV-1 replication in primary lymphoid and myeloid cells (Badia et al., 2016, 2017). Selective CDK4/6 inhibitors impede SAMHD1 phosphorylation, activating SAMHD1 function and blocking HIV-1 replication (Pauls et al., 2014).",

Ester showed that SAMHD1 is a modulator of nucleotide analogue efficacy, whereas sensitivity to a non-nucleoside inhibitor (nevirapine) or to nucleoside phosphonates (cidofovir and tenofovir) is not affected. However, she also showed that SAMHD1 could either enhance or reduce the antiviral potency of anti-cancer analogues, an effect that was not dependent on the specific nucleotides targeted, but on their capacity to act as substrates or competitors for the catalytic site in SAMHD1 of the natural nucleotides. Additionally, selective CDK inhibitors also modify the antiviral activity of antimetabolites, an activity that is lost in SAMHD1-knockdown cells. She concluded that modulation of SAMHD1 function may constitute a promising target for the improvement of multiple therapies that employ nucleotide analogues or antimetabolites affecting the dNTP pool.",

In this case, atomic analysis of viral capsid proteins bound to the drug allowed identification of a new hydrophobic drug-binding pocket. Data on resistance mutations mapping to the binding pocket revealed by cryo-EM suggested that this newly revealed structure could be a potential target for the development of novel inhibitors. Next, she used respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) as an example of structural heterogeneity among viral particles. Electron cryo-tomographic characterization of RSV virions showed highly heterogeneous architectures, either spherical, filamentous, or a combination of both morphologies. Cryo-EM followed by sub-tomogram averaging revealed that different morphologies correlated with local ordering of the glycoprotein spikes, either in pre-fusion or post-fusion conformations (Liljeroos et al., 2013). To sum up, Sarah discussed the advantages and caveats of cryo-EM technology, highlighting its enormous potential, especially for resolving structures of not very small proteins (up to 0.1 MDa), but also pointing out some still unresolved issues, such as averaging and computational requirements and the need to develop standardized validation methods.",

This may initially favor viral replication in the absence of primary innate cell-mediated inflammation, and renders possible the induction of T-cell exhaustion/attrition in a few patients (around 10% of immunocompetent adults) in a virologic context of high and persistent replication. In chronically infected patients, there is a long-lasting failure of HBV-specific immune responses that results in persistence. Yet in many patients, HBV infection remains acute and is cleared rapidly by strong and poly-epitopic T-cell responses. This implies that the infection can be defeated by immune responses, and that in chronically infected patients one would have to break the HBV-driven immune subversion to restore full control of the virus. Most therapeutic vaccination strategies have failed to restore immune control of infection (for a list of past and current trials, see Table 1\n).",

A boost with an MVA vector encoding various HBV epitopes (not disclosed) is then given, which expands HBV-specific T cells in liver parenchymal secondary/tertiary lymphoid structures called iMATEs (Huang et al., 2013).",

The core (HBc) is a structural protein that assembles a capsid around the pregenomic RNA, and reverse transcription then takes place to generate relaxed circular DNA (rcDNA). Core assembly modulators (CAMs) inhibit this process and the neosynthesis of rcDNA, similar to the action of nucleoside analogues (NUC). The HBc protein also has other regulatory functions in infected cells. David reminded us that, in cells with high levels of HBV replication, HBc is in the nucleus, where it binds to cccDNA and may contribute to its transcriptional activity or stability. HBc also binds to host DNA and may regulate host gene expression. Finally, as HBc is mainly an RNA-binding protein, it could bind to viral RNAs and regulate their fate. Due to the multifunctional character of HBc, CAMs might do more than initially envisaged.",

It also modulates the activity of antimetabolites such as pemetrexed (Pmtx), which have basal anti-HIV and anti-cancer activity. The dNTPase activity of SAMHD1 is inactivated by phosphorylation. The inhibition of SAMHD1 phosphorylation could therefore lead to more pronounced anti-HIV activity, due to dNTP deprivation. This study elegantly showed that CDK4/6 is involved in the phosphorylation of SAMHD1 and that its inhibition by palbociblib (Pb) prevented SAMHD1 phosphorylation and, in turn, potentiated the anti-HIV activity of Pmtx. Indeed the combination of Pb and Pmtx had an increased effect on HIV-1 replication, as well as an increased anti-cancer effect, with a combination index (CI) < 0.02.

To demonstrate that the small molecules were recruiting the CLR complex to mediate degradation of NS3-4A, the cereblon-binding moiety in DGY-04-35 was modified to produce DGY-07-026, which cannot recruit cereblon and consequently does not mediate NS3-4A degradation. Degradation of NS3-4A could also be prevented by competition with lenalidomide, a cereblon ligand. Together, the experiments demonstrate that the small molecules were recruiting the CLR complex to mediate degradation of NS3-4A and thereby inhibit HCV.",

Rolf's group performed structure-based design of peptidomimetic alpha-ketoamides as inhibitors of main and 3C proteases. Close inspection of crystal structures of early lead compounds in complex with the target proteases revealed differences in the S2 pocket: it is small and covered by a lid in the HCoV-NL63 enzyme, large and covered in SARS-CoV Mpro, and large, but not covered in CVB3 3Cpro. The SARS-CoV Mpro also features high plasticity of the S2 site. The best near-equipotent inhibitors have P2 = cyclopentylmethyl or cyclohexylmethyl and display low- or sub-\u03bcM EC50 values against enteroviruses and alpha- and betacoronaviruses.

GCV is converted to its monophosphate (MP) form by the CMV-encoded pUL97 protein kinase, followed by endogenous cellular phosphorylation to the active GCV-TP that inhibits viral DNA synthesis. In contrast, MBX-2168 was previously shown to be partially phosphorylated to the MBX-2168-MP by the cellular kinase TAOK3, allowing MBX-2168 to overcome UL97 resistance. Second, a butyl-ether moiety at the 6-position of the guanine ring must be enzymatically removed. To characterize this step, pentostatin, an inhibitor of adenosine deaminase (ADA) and adenosine-deaminase-like-protein-1 (ADAL1), was co-incubated with MBX-2168, which resulted in a reduction in its EC50 by >300-fold (0.02 \u03bcM vs. 6.47 \u03bcM). Further, the moiety at the 6-position of the guanine ring of MBX-2168 was not enzymatically removed by ADA, suggesting that it is removed by ADAL-1 following phosphorylation of the drug to a MP. Remarkably, when MBX-2168 was incubated with cellular extracts and an ADAL1-baculovirus construct, conversion of MBX-2168-MP to synguanol-MP was demonstrated, Future research will focus on the conversion of MBX-2168-MP to synguanol-MP by ADAL-1 in the presence and absence of 2-deoxycoformycin (dCF), a potent adenosine deaminase inhibitor, and on the conversion of MBX-2168 to its triphosphate in infected cells.",

Artemisone emerged as a potent inhibitor of CMV, including both laboratory-adapted strains and low-passage clinical isolates. Artemisone demonstrated \u226510-fold superior activity in epithelial cells and fibroblasts than artesunate and inhibited HCMV plaque formation, with EC50 values comparable to ganciclovir. Time-of-addition studies showed that the drug inhibits an early stage of the CMV replicative cycle and affects transcription of immediately-early (IE) genes; the effect is dependent on the multiplicity of infection (MOI). However, inhibition of a late stage of the replicative cycle was found to be independent of the MOI, suggesting a novel mechanism of action. Artemisone's inhibitory activity was specific to HCMV and the closely related rhesus macaque CMV, with no consistent activity against murine CMV or HSV-1.",

To characterize this transcriptional heterogeneity, her team performed single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) using the Fluidigm technology and a primary model of HIV latency. They analyzed the transcriptional profile of 224 latently infected CD4+T single cells, divided into three groups: untreated, histone deacetylase inhibitor vorinostat (SAHA)-treated and TCR-stimulated cells. Principal component analysis identified two different clusters in each of the three groups that correlated with differences in HIV expression: a \u201cdeep\u201d stage CD4+ T-cell cluster, poorly responsive to external stimuli and difficult to reactivate, and an \u201cinducible\u201d stage CD4+ T-cell cluster, which was easier to stimulate and reactivate. They also found a 134-gene specific cellular signature that was associated with the success of HIV reactivation. In vivo analysis of single cells from HIV-infected individuals further confirmed the existence of the two cellular populations, which might reflect two distinct resting cellular states and display a different potential for cell stimulation and HIV reactivation.",

Thanks to Vpx, HIV-2 infects DCs at high levels and activates innate immunity through sensing of DNA by cGAS-cGAMP-STING proteins (Lahaye et al., 2013). Manel's team was able to package cGAMP into viral particles (VLPs), transmit it into target cells, and induce an immune response. As he highlighted, this has implications for cancer immunotherapy, since cGAMP-VLPs induce anti-tumor T cell responses, and for vaccination, because cGAMP-VLPs could be delivered along with antigen by intramuscular injection, thereby exerting its immunomodulatory role.",

Manel and colleagues demonstrated by different approaches the existence of a nuclear protein that directly binds to the HIV capsid and that it is required for STING-IRF3-mediated interferon induction in response to HIV-2 in DCs.

They were conceived as a strategy to cure HIV infection, by means of the short-term administration of latency-reversing agents (LRA) that increase HIV-1 transcription, protein expression and plasma RNA. To induce virus reactivation, many pathways may be targeted by LRAs. Vorinostat provided the first direct measurement of the disruption of HIV-1 latency in vivo, with a mean 4.8-fold induction in unspliced cell-associated HIV-RNA that was not accompanied by a rebound of viral particles in plasma (Archin et al., 2012). The subsequent use of other LRAs such as panobinostat, which induces extracellular HIV-1 RNA and p24 production in plasma, further confirmed that it is possible to induce in vivo reactivation of HIV-1 (Wu et al., 2017). However, as Ole highlighted, none of these early trials, even those using potent LRAs such as romidepsin, were able to reduce the size of the latent reservoir, and once ART is interrupted, there is viral rebound. He therefore concluded that \u201cshock\u201d exists, but not \u201ckill\u201d. In the last part of his lecture, he reviewed newer studies that combined LRAs with therapeutic HIV-1 vaccines aimed at improving the killing of reactivated cells, and studies to test LRAs such as TLR7 and TLR9 agonists, which may also enhance antiviral immunity.",
