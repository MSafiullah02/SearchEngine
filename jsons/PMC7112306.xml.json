Due to the exponential amplification of the target sequence, it has exquisite sensitivity. Less than 10 copies of any transcript can be readily detected, even against a high background of unrelated nucleic acids. The establishment of PCR-based detection methods has provided the basis for rapid and reliable detection of viral nucleic acids in the clinical setting. It was shown that the monitoring of virus load and the kinetics of virus proliferation have prognostic relevance for the course of disease and clinical outcome (Whalley et al., 2001, Humar et al., 2002, Snijders et al., 2003, Biedermann et al., 2004, Wagner et al., 2004, Watzinger et al., 2004). The availability of quantitative virus detection tests is therefore of paramount importance for the clinical management of virus infections.",

            "text": "Quantification of target sequences by real-time quantitative PCR (RQ-PCR) is based on the continuous measurement of the accumulation or reduction of fluorescence signals during the amplification reaction. In contrast to quantitative PCR approaches based on data analysis at the end of PCR (end-point quantitative PCR), the real-time PCR technology permits the detection of the number of amplicons generated during each amplification cycle in a real-time mode (=kinetic quantitative PCR). This technique has eliminated the need of post-amplification handling of the samples and has paved the way towards fully automated detection systems. Appropriate calibration of RQ-PCR assays and the use of standard curves permit the assessment of absolute copy numbers of the target of interest. Results are typically displayed as amplification plots resulting from a series of fluorescence measurements taken at defined time points during the amplification process. One of the important features of the real-time technology is the ability to monitor the increasing amount of product at early time points during the PCR reaction. This facilitates quantification of the target in the exponential phase of PCR, when the amplification product first becomes detectable. Quantification by real-time PCR is therefore neither affected by limiting concentrations of reagents, nor by other variables, such as cycling conditions, which affect quantification in endpoint analysis-based PCR assays. Optimized RQ-PCR tests display very high sensitivity, with detection limits between 1 and 10 target molecules per reaction. The RQ-PCR technology offers a broad dynamic capacity facilitating quantification across a more than seven-log range of target molecules (Chen et al., 2001, Jebbink et al., 2003, Lindh and Hannoun, 2005b).",

The surveillance of viral load is a useful indicator of active infection, virus\u2013host interaction and the response to antiviral therapy (Watzinger et al., 2004, Hausler et al., 2003). Commercial RQ-PCR assays are available only for a limited number of viral pathogens including e.g. the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV 1), the hepatitis viruses B and C (HBV, HCV), the cytomegalovirus (CMV), the human papilloma virus (HPV), and the SARS-associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV) (see Table 1\n). Due to the fact that quantitative monitoring of virus infections has become indispensable for patient and disease management in different clinical settings, home-brew real-time assays have been established for a number of other viral targets and implemented in clinical diagnosis (see Table 2\n). Within the foreseeable future, it can be expected that diagnostic laboratories will have to continue developing in-house methods for the quantification of many clinically relevant viral targets.",

During the annealing and extension steps, an increasing amount of dye binds to the newly synthesized DNA strands leading to maximum fluorescence emission at the end of the elongation phase. As soon as the DNA is denatured again during PCR cycling, intercalated dye molecules are released into the solution resulting in a drop of fluorescence. The fluorescence is recorded after each cycle at the end of the elongation phase, and reflects the number of PCR products generated during the amplification process (Morrison et al., 1998). It is important to consider that the number of intercalating dye molecules, and thus, the amount of fluorescence signal emitted is greatly influenced by the length of the PCR amplicons. If the absolute amount of initial target copies is to be determined, a correction factor must be used to correctly assess the number of target molecules (Piatak et al., 1993).",

Moreover, signal intensities and quantification results are not affected by mutations within the sequence encompassed by the primers. This property may be advantageous in the PCR analysis of viruses displaying a high mutation rate (e.g. different RNA viruses). Since point mutations in the target sequence can have an adverse effect on the hybridization efficiency of fluorogenic probes, detection and quantitative analysis of viral target sequences prone to mutation may be compromised in this detection format. On the other hand, the lack of probes in the assay results in lower sensitivity and specificity. Amplification and detection of specific PCR products are determined solely by the amplification primers. Dye molecules binding to non-specific PCR products or primer dimers contribute to overall fluorescence signal intensity, and may therefore lead to inaccurate quantification of target transcripts. These artifacts may also result in the generation of fluorescence in the \u201cNo Amplification (NAC) and No Template (NTC) Controls\u201d (see below), thus affecting the interpretation of results. It is essential therefore to control the specificity of amplified fragments at the end of PCR by melting curve analysis (see below).",

Hydrolysis probes (Applied Biosystems, AB, Foster City, CA, USA), also referred to as TaqMan\u00ae or 5\u2032 nuclease probes, are non-extendible target-specific oligonucleotide probes that bind to the target strand between the PCR primers. They are dually labelled with a fluorescent reporter dye (e.g. FAM or VIC) covalently attached to the 5\u2032-end, and a quencher dye (e.g. TAMRA), covalently attached to the 3\u2032-end. When the reporter molecule on the TaqMan probe is stimulated by an appropriate light source to emit fluorescence, the energy is transferred to the quencher, thereby suppressing the emission of fluorescence by the reporter. This physical principle is known as the fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) (Selvin, 1995). The transfer of energy works efficiently only across very short distances, and decreases rapidly when the reporter and quencher molecules move apart. During PCR, when the DNA polymerase extends the primers, the hybridized probes are cleaved by the 5\u2032 exonuclease activity of the enzyme and the corresponding quencher and reporter molecules are separated. The energy transfer to the quencher molecule is thus abrogated, and the reporter starts emitting fluorescence which can be measured at the end of each extension step (Holland et al., 1991).",

However, short amplicons (80\u2013130 bp) are required to achieve optimal amplification efficiencies and, since the TaqMan\u00ae probe molecules are cleaved after each cycle, no melting curve analysis of the amplicons is possible. Another disadvantage is the reduced temperature of strand extension required for the 5\u2032-nuclease activity to displace and cleave the probe.

If both probes are bound to the specific target sequences, the fluorescence energy is transferred from the donor to the acceptor molecules (FRET), and the excited fluorophore emits a fluorescent signal, which is detected and measured at the end of each annealing step. After the annealing step, the temperature in the cycler is raised for strand extension, and the hybridization probes detach from the target. In solution, the hybridization probes are not close enough to permit relevant energy transfer. The amount of red fluorescence emitted during each annealing step is proportional to the number of PCR products generated. Measurement of the fluorescence kinetics during PCR permits calculation of the initial target copies (Nitsche et al., 1999).",

Molecular beacons are oligonucleotide probes containing flanking sequences of 5\u20137 nucleotides designed to be complementary to each other, and an intervening sequence complementary to the target of interest. The ends of the probe are labelled with a fluorescent and a non-fluorescent quenching dye (DABCYL), respectively. The term \u201cmolecular beacon\u201d is derived from the fact that in solution the complementary sequences of the probe anneal to each other forming a stem-like structure, whereas the intervening sequence remains single-stranded and loops out. The result is a hairpin structure that brings the fluorescent dye and the quencher in close proximity, leading to efficient quenching of the fluorophore. The energy is released from the quencher dye in the form of heat (collisional quenching). In the presence of specific template, the intervening loop sequence of the molecular beacon binds to the target. This leads to a conformational transition from the hairpin structure to a linear structure, resulting in the separation of fluorophore and quencher. Energy transfer no longer occurs, and the fluorescence emitted can be detected at the end of each annealing step. Due to the fluorogenic mechanism, molecular beacons can be used for the generation of melting curves after the final extension step at the end of PCR, as a means of controlling the specificity of target amplification.",

The greater stability is reflected by a higher T\nM as compared to the corresponding DNA/DNA or DNA/RNA duplexes. PNA/DNA hybridization is significantly more affected by base mismatches than DNA/DNA hybridization. A single PNA/DNA mismatch reduces the T\nM by an average of 15 \u00b0C, compared with 11 \u00b0C in a DNA/DNA duplex. This allows shorter lengths of PNA probes to be used in situations where longer DNA probes are normally employed.

Moreover, PNAs are not recognized by polymerases and thus cannot be used as primers in RQ-PCR assays (Orum et al., 1993). A practical problem with PNA is the insolubility in water of oligomers greater in length than 15\u201318 bases.

In contrast to some other detection formats, this principle permits target quantification by the measurement of increasing rather than fluctuating fluorescence intensity. Due to the presence of a PNA backbone, the probes are not degraded by the Taq DNA polymerase during the extension phase.

In contrast to PNA and MGB chemistry, LNA modifications are applicable to both primers and probes in RQ-PCR assays. LNA substitutions to DNA oligonucleotides confer exceptional biological stability and significantly increased affinity to their complementary DNA targets. The increased thermal stability is dependent on the number of LNA monomers present in the sequence. LNA modifications greatly increase the melting temperature of oligonucleotides and the differences in T\nM between perfectly and imperfectly matched nucleic acid duplexes, thus facilitating the discrimination even between single base mutations. Owing to these properties, LNA-containing oligonucleotides used in RQ-PCR assays have a length ranging between 13 and 20 nucleotides (nt), which is significantly shorter than unmodified primers and probes displaying the same T\nM. This feature provides greater flexibility in designing consensus primers and probes for the detection of partially homologous target sequences, such as related viral species and serotypes.

Intercalating dyes are significantly cheaper than probes, but bind also to primer dimers and other spurious PCR products. Subsequent melting curve analysis increases the discriminative power of dye-based assays, but adds to the complexity of data analysis. Other probe-less RQ-PCR detection systems also lack the intrinsic specificity control offered by the inclusion of target-specific probe and are therefore less commonly used in clinical diagnostics. The employment of specifically binding fluorogenic probes offers not only greater specificity of target detection, but the inclusion of a hybridization step in the PCR reaction also increases the sensitivity of detection, which is comparable to that achieved by nested PCR or Southern blot hybridization of PCR products. Another benefit of probe-based assays over intercalating dyes is the possibility to combine two or even more probes with different labels in one PCR reaction (multiplex reaction). In these instances, it is essential to select fluorescent dyes with minimal spectral overlap in excitation and emission in order to avoid the phenomenon of \u201ccross-talk\u201d.",

Unless fluorescence-labelled primers are used, the non-specific products can remain undetected, but may affect the amplification efficiency of the specific target and the final quantification result. It is recommended therefore to optimize the reaction conditions in the initial phase of assay development by employing intercalating dyes and subsequent gel electrophoresis or melting curve analysis, in order to ensure the absence of amplification artefacts prior to implementing a specific probe in the assay. In our hands, the use and LNA-modified hydrolysis probes has been particularly successful in establishing highly specific RQ-PCR detection assays displaying a sensitivity superior to other systems.

However, the procedure is time-consuming, labor-intensive, and susceptible to contamination. Moreover, safety issues associated with the required use of phenol\u2013chloroform\u2013isoamylalcohol extraction rendered this organic extraction a less convenient nucleic acid purification method for clinical applications. In an effort to eliminate the use of hazardous solvents for the extraction of impurities, and in order to save time and labor, more rapid and automated nucleic acid extraction protocols with fewer manipulation steps were established and commercialized. The majority of these \u201cready-to-use\u201d sample preparation kits are based on the capture of DNA/RNA on silica matrices or on paramagnetic beads coated with target specific ligands. The elimination of organic solvents and the development of appropriate technical instruments have paved the way to the implementation of robotic workstations for automated sample processing. Systems for automated sample preparation include, for example, the AmpliPrep or the MagNA Pure LC system (Roche Diagnostics) or workstations like the BioRobots M48 or 9604 (QIAGEN) (see Table 3\n). Despite the relatively high cost of acquisition, maintenance and required consumables, these instruments can be recommended for implementation in clinical virology laboratories. The obvious advantages of largely automated systems for virus analysis include increased throughput and less hands-on time for the staff, in addition to improved reproducibility, higher specificity and lower inter-laboratory variation. Moreover, the risk of pre-PCR cross-contamination can be significantly reduced (Mifflin et al., 2000). Irrespective of the extraction procedure applied, manual or automated, and the chemistry used, home-brew or approved (e.g. as \u201canalytic specific reagents\u201d (ASR) or \u201cCE analytical\u201d), potential problems affecting the efficiency and reliability of viral nucleic acid purification require consideration:(1)Impurities and contaminations present after nucleic acid isolation may cause false negative results of PCR analysis owing to the presence of nucleases or enzyme inhibitors. An adequate control for the purity of nucleic acid preparations is the performance of over-time stability studies using well defined DNA or RNA spikes added after the nucleic acid isolation step.(2)The detection limit of virus analysis may be affected by restriction of the sample volume that can be processed by a given nucleic acid extraction protocol. A number of commercially available products for isolation of nucleic acids suffer from this limitation. For the detection of very low virus copy numbers, virus-enrichment (Roth et al., 1999, Shyamala et al., 2004) or high-volume extraction methods (Hourfar et al., 2005) may be required.\n",

Depending on the complexity of the RNA target, the choice of primer, enzyme and reaction conditions are essential for the efficiency and fidelity of the RT reaction (Bustin and Nolan, 2004, Bustin et al., 2005). The most commonly used reverse transcriptases include the retroviral enzymes AMV-RT (purified from Avian Myeloblastosis Virus-infected chicks), and MMLV-RT (product of the pol gene of Moloney Murine Leukemia Virus). First strand cDNA synthesis can be initiated with non-specific primers, such as poly-T or random hexamer oligonucleotides, or with target sequence-specific primers. The activity of RT enzymes is adversely affected by residual blood components such as heme, by the presence of heparin, alcohol, phenol or high salt concentrations. Moreover, contaminations carried over from the RNA precipitation step can affect the measurable amount of RNA template, leading to inter-tube and inter-experimental variability (Freeman et al., 1999). Controls for the reverse transcription step are addressed below (see Section 5.2).",

            "text": "Potential drawbacks of using real-time PCR in comparison to conventional PCR include the inability to monitor amplicon size without opening the system and the incompatibility of individual platforms with some fluorogenic chemistries. Moreover, the initial expense of real-time PCR may be prohibitive for low-throughput laboratories, but real-time PCR has proven cost effective when implemented in a high-throughput laboratory (Martell et al., 1999). Once established, the real-time technology offers a number of important advantages over conventional PCR including a decreased chance of contamination, because the systems are closed and do not require handling of the reaction contents after completion of PCR. An additional advantage is the monitoring of product accumulation in the reaction tube, which eliminates the requirement of separate detection methods, such as gel electrophoresis, thus shortening the effective assay time considerably. Since the fluorescence generated during the amplification reaction is proportional to the amount of PCR product, semi-quantitative estimation of virus copies in the specimen investigated is feasible even without precise calibration of the assay, which is required for truly quantitative analysis (see Section 5.1). A large number of real-time PCR assays for the detection of viral pathogens, including both DNA and RNA viruses, have been described (Abe et al., 1999, Kimura et al., 1999, Ryncarz et al., 1999, Kleiber et al., 2000, Lallemand et al., 2000, Monpoeho et al., 2000, Tanaka et al., 2000, Ohyashiki et al., 2000, Furuta et al., 2001, Watzinger et al., 2004). The latter require special care in specimen processing because of the susceptibility of RNA to the digestion by ribonucleases that may be present in clinical samples. The efficiency of the reverse transcription step, which is required prior to PCR amplification, is critical for the sensitivity of RNA virus detection and must be monitored by appropriate controls (see Section 5.2). Reverse transcription real-time PCR has been applied to the detection of numerous RNA viruses including, for example, the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), the hepatitis C virus (HCV), the human T-cell lymphotropic viruses HTLV-1 and HTLV-2, enteroviruses (EV), the respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), the influenza viruses (Inf-A, Inf-B), the rotavirus and other viral pathogens that cause gastroenteritis, pulmonary and other infections (see Table 2). RT-PCR can also be employed to detect viral messenger RNA, which may be particularly useful in the diagnosis of DNA viruses displaying a latent phase in their life cycle. Detection of viral DNA in such cases may not permit distinction between latent and productive infection. In these instances, the detection of mRNA expressed only during productive infection would provide evidence of active viral infection. Apart from viral mRNA analysis, the presence or absence of an actively proliferating virus can be determined by serial quantitative measurement of relative or absolute viral load (see Section 4.6).",

Future developments of novel chemistries, such as combinatorial fluorescence energy transfer tags (Tong et al., 2001), and improvements to the design of real-time instrumentation and software can be expected to broaden the applicability of multiplex real-time PCR assays.",

Commonly, relative quantification provides sufficient information and is easier to establish. However, when monitoring the course of an infection, absolute quantification is useful in order to express the results in units that are common to both scientists and clinicians and across different platforms.

            "text": "The importance of quantitative virus analysis is further underscored by the fact that different viruses may persist in a latent state after primary infection in healthy immunocompetent individuals as well as in asymptomatic patients, and cause universally positive results in PCR assays. Mere detection of these viral pathogens by PCR may not be relevant for the clinical outcome in these individuals. By contrast, consecutive assessment of the virus load seems to play an important role for the diagnosis and prognosis in patients with viral reactivation, by providing a basis for timely initiation of appropriate treatment (Yoshikawa, 2003, Zhong et al., 2004, Cesaro et al., 2005). A clinically important example of such viruses is the cytomegalovirus (CMV), a member of the human herpes virus family, which commonly persists in peripheral blood leukocytes after primary infection and is often reactivated in severely immunodeficient patients. It is the most common cause of opportunistic infection in patients with AIDS and in individuals who have received either solid organ or allogeneic stem cell transplantation. In view of the fact that CMV disease is life-threatening in these patients, early diagnosis of reactivation is important for therapeutic management. Mere detection of CMV in peripheral blood by PCR cannot distinguish between latent and active virus infection and has therefore a low predictive value for impending disease. Measurement of CMV load by quantitative PCR may, however, provide clinically more relevant information (Limaye et al., 2001). Detection of high levels of CMV DNA or the documentation of increasing viral load in serial blood specimens were reported to herald systemic disease and provide a basis for timely onset of preemptive antiviral therapy (i.e. treatment before the occurrence of symptoms). Moreover, quantitative surveillance of CMV load may be helpful in providing a measure of response to therapy, with rising levels potentially permitting an early identification of antiviral drug resistance (Roberts et al., 1998).",

In a recent study in pediatric patients after allogeneic stem cell transplantation, we have investigated the potential of serial real-time PCR analysis to facilitate diagnosis of invasive adenovirus (AdV) infection early in its pre-clinical stage. Some of the patients who ultimately developed fatal disseminated disease had very high levels of AdV copies in peripheral blood (>107/ml), while others displayed relatively low peak levels, ranging between 103 and 104\n copies/ml. Regardless of the maximum AdV levels reached, quantitative monitoring of virus load by real-time PCR usually revealed rising virus copy numbers several weeks before the onset of clinical symptoms (Lion et al., 2003), indicating that the detection of virus proliferation kinetics has a better predictive value in this instance. For clinically relevant evaluation of dynamic changes determined by serial RQ-PCR analyses, we have shown previously for different quantitative PCR assays that a tenfold increase of the respective target copy number is well beyond the intrinsic variability of the method, and provides reliable evidence of an expanding process (Lion et al., 1993, Lion et al., 2003). The detection of rising viral load by serial real-time PCR analysis not only demonstrates the presence of an active infection, but also eliminates a technical problem inherent in PCR diagnosis, the occurrence of false positive PCR tests due to inadvertent contamination with extraneous nucleic acids.",

            "text": "Limited homology among different strains, serotypes or even species belonging to a viral genus can be a major challenge for the establishment real-time PCR assays, if detection of the entire spectrum of these viruses is of potential clinical relevance. The human adenoviruses (AdV), which are divided into six species (A\u2013F) and 51 serotypes, where individual serotypes may contain a number of different strains, are an important example. Different approaches have been described for detecting and quantifying all human adenoviruses. An AdV species-specific real-time PCR assay requiring six separate reactions, each of which contains individual primer and probe systems, permitting quantitative analysis of all serotypes within a species, has provided a clinically useful, but relatively laborious approach (Lion et al., 2003). In a recent report, a more economic pan-adenovirus detection assay, a multiplex PCR combining different primer/probe systems in two reactions, has been described (Ebner et al., 2005). The detection of all human adenoviruses in one RQ-PCR reaction using a single consensus primer/probe system is feasible (Heim et al., 2003), but requires lower stringency conditions of target amplification, thus potentially compromising the specificity of the assay. Other clinically important examples of viruses requiring quantitative analysis of different genotypes and mutated variants include the blood-borne viruses HIV, HCV, and HBV. For HIV infected patients, genotype assays are available facilitating the identification of mutations in the viral genome associated with resistance to particular drugs (Clarke, 2002, Pas et al., 2005). This type of analysis permits the selection of an appropriate antiretroviral regimen and provides an indication at which time-point treatment needs to be changed. In patients suffering from HCV infection, information on the presence of specific genotypes is used in addition to the viral load (see above) for determining the duration of antiviral therapy (EASL, 1999). Similarly, the success of antiviral treatment in HBV infected patients seems to correlate with the genotype detected (Sugauchi et al., 2002). A common procedure for virus genotyping is target amplification using consensus primer-mediated PCR, followed by sequencing of the amplified fragments (Germer et al., 1999, Chow et al., 2000, Vernon et al., 2000, Plantier et al., 2004). In the presence of mixed virus populations, this approach has serious limitations owing to preferential amplification of the dominant virus strain, which prevents the identification of subdominant strains by sequencing, if they account for less than 10\u201320% of the entire viral load. Known virus variants can be directly targeted and quantified by specifically designed RQ-PCR assays, exploiting particularly the high discriminating capacity of primers or probes carrying one of the modifications described above. To identify a particular virus variant of interest for subsequent quantitative analysis, PCR-based algorithms may be employed, as exemplified in Fig. 1\nfor selective quantification of a human AdV serotype. This approach permits highly sensitive and specific quantification, even in the presence of multiple AdV serotypes of the same or different species.",

            "text": "In conventional PCR assays, false positive results are most commonly caused by contamination of PCR reactions with amplification products from previous tests or by carryover of homologous genomic DNA. Alternatively, false positive results may arise from non-specific binding of primers to irrelevant sequences. The latter problem is greatly reduced in real-time PCR assays implementing specific hybridization probes that lead to the generation of fluorescence signals only upon binding to the amplified products. Although in real-time PCR assays performed on fluorescence-based instruments, the absence of post-amplification handling greatly reduces the risk of contamination by PCR products, it is important to bear in mind that this problem is not entirely eliminated. Contamination may occur by leakage from tubes or microtiter plates with lids not tightly closed or by breakage of glass capillaries leading to spillage of the amplification mixture. If the nucleotide dTTP is substituted by dUTP in all PCR reactions, amplicons will differ from genomic DNA by the presence of dUTP. In this instance, the problem of contamination with PCR products can be easily reduced by implementing a digestion step with Uracil-DNA-glycosylase (UNG) prior to each amplification reaction. When using this pretreatment in PCR reactions, digestion of newly synthesized PCR product is prevented by heat-mediated inactivation of the enzyme before the start of amplification (Watzinger and Lion, 2003). Although the routine use of UNG is highly effective, it does not completely eradicate the problem of contamination. In virus analysis, an important source of carryover contamination is patient material containing high titers of a viral pathogen, which is not affected by enzymatic digestion using UNG. The risk of contamination by extraneous viral nucleic acids can be reduced by extremely careful handling of clinical samples by skilled personnel, strict separation of working areas and other well established precautions recommended for PCR work (Kwok and Higuchi, 1989, Sarkar and Sommer, 1990, Scherczinger et al., 1999, Bustin, 2002). Moreover, multiple negative controls, i.e. reactions lacking any template, the so-called \u201cno-template controls (NTCs)\u201d, and reactions including non-homologous template, the \u201cno-amplification controls (NACs)\u201d, must be included in each assay to permit the identification of contamination and prevent false interpretation of positive results.",

            "text": "In view of the great sensitivity of PCR, the occurrence of false negative results is a highly underestimated problem. The absence of positive signals in samples containing the viral target may result from inhibitory substances present in the clinical specimen analyzed, from low efficiency or failure of viral nucleic acid extraction, from inadequate PCR amplification or, in case of RNA virus analysis, from inefficient reverse transcription. The efficiency of nucleic acid isolation, reverse transcription and amplification can be assessed by adding a defined standard to the samples before each of these steps. Artificial constructs generated by cloning of the specific viral target sequence into a plasmid are often used as external controls for the amplification step. However, the handling of plasmids harboring the targeted nucleic acid sequence is a dangerous source of contamination. In order to avoid the risk of cross-contamination and to include well defined internal controls with physical properties similar to those of the target of interest, it is recommended to spike the specimens with non-human, naturally occurring viruses (see below). Alternatively, the so-called \u201carmored RNA\u201d technology can be implemented as an internal control, where the samples investigated are spiked with a known concentration of a synthetic RNA standard protected from degradation by packaging in pseudoviral particles (Pasloske et al., 1998). In our laboratory, we use the phocine (=seal) herpes virus type 1 (PhHV) as a DNA virus control and the phocine distemper virus (PDV) as an RNA virus control (both were kindly provided to us by Niesters, Department of Virology, University Hospital Rotterdam, the Netherlands). Clinical specimens to be tested for the presence and quantity of DNA viruses are spiked with a defined amount of PhHV prior to processing. The presence or absence of the expected level of fluorescent signal obtained upon real-time amplification of the control virus permits the assessment of the efficiency of nucleic acid isolation and possible effects of inhibitory agents on the amplification step. Similarly, clinical specimens to be investigated by real-time PCR for RNA viruses are spiked with defined quantities of PDV (Niesters, 2002, Watzinger et al., 2004). After RNA extraction and reverse transcription, the amount of control virus is determined by real-time PCR analysis. The presence of the expected result indicates adequate extraction and reverse transcription of viral RNA and the lack of any inhibitory effects on amplification. The results of quantitative virus analysis in clinical specimens are deemed eligible for evaluation only if quantitative analysis of the respective control virus reveals a readout in the expected range.",

The variety of predominantly home-brew methods used for quantification of viral targets and the lack of comprehensive information on the quality control measures in some published reports render the comparison of data generated by different diagnostic laboratories rather difficult.

Due to the lack of standardized reference material and the absence of international accrediting bodies, different programs for quality control in clinical virology, such as the Quality Control for Molecular Diagnostics (QCMD) (URL: <http://www.qcmd.org/>), have been established. This activity was supported by the European Commission and endorsed by the European Society for Clinical Virology (ESCV) and the European Society for Clinical Microbiology and Infectious Disease (ESCMID). The QCMD is an independent, non-profit organization that designs, develops and provides QC materials and proficiency programs for an increasing number of viral targets. However, the number of currently available internationally accepted controls and standardized QC reagents is limited and restricted mainly to blood-borne viruses, such as HIV-1, HBV, and HCV. Certification and accreditation of diagnostic laboratories are becoming increasingly important in order to document the expertise and quality of work. Widely accepted criteria for quality assurance and the certification of clinical laboratories include the ISO standards 9001 and 15189. According to these guidelines it is necessary \u201cto apply other methods to calibrate the measuring systems and to participate in inter-laboratory comparison programs or alternative mechanisms that can assure the quality of analytical procedures\u201d. Examples of such collaborative efforts in Europe supported by the European Commission include Concerted Actions focusing on the standardization and clinical implementation of different diagnostic approaches.
