            "text": "Passive immunization is based on the administration of serum from convalescent/vaccinated human donors or animals to attempt to prevent or control infection [1], [2]. Whilst vaccines require time to induce immunity and depend on the host's ability to mount an immune response, passive immunization can provide immediate protection and is theoretically independent of the recipient's immune status. Following the development of anti-diphtheria serum by Behring and Kitasato in the early 1890s [3], immune sera from convalescent humans were used to prevent or treat a range of viral diseases including measles, the 1918 pandemic flu, varicella-zoster virus, Bolivian hemorrhagic fever, Argentine hemorrhagic fever as well as Ebola and Lassa hemorrhagic fevers [4]. Moreover, some of the earliest attempts to cure veterinary diseases involved passive immunization with serum from recovered animals as was described in seminal attempts to \u2018cure\u2019 rinderpest in the 1890s [5]. Today, several pooled antiviral immunoglobulin products are still available on the US market including hyperimmune immunoglobulin preparations against rabies virus, cytomegalovirus, hepatitis B and C viruses, vaccinia virus, varicella-zoster virus, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and West Nile virus.",

Fully human mAbs (Fig. 1A) with minimized immunogenicity can now be generated using methods such as phage display [8] and purified envelope glycoproteins in either monomeric or oligomeric forms and viral particles are two types of antigen that are commonly used as bait for panning antibody libraries [4].

Prior to palivizumab, prophylaxis of RSV disease depended on a polyclonal serum preparation called RespiGam (or RSV-IGIV). This polyclonal preparation showed relatively low specific activity, and dosing required the application of relatively large volumes of antibody in low weight infants [13], [14]. The greater potency of palivizumab reduced the volume required to deliver a therapeutic dose to an infant and has improved RSV treatment by avoiding the side effects of pooled serum [13], [14].",

Antibodies operate through various mechanisms, mediated by either their variable or constant regions. Highly selective binding to specific epitopes on the target antigen is a functionally crucial property that is mediated by the antibody variable domains [15]. The antibody constant domains include the Fc region and perform other important functions including antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC), antibody-dependent cellular phagocytosis (ADCP), and complement-dependent cytotoxicity (CDC) [15]. ADCC and ADCP are mediated by Fc\u03b3 receptors while CDC is mediated by complement cascade proteins such as C1q and C5 [16]. Another function of the Fc region is extension of antibody half-life (21 days for human IgG) through interaction with the neonatal Fc receptor (FcRn) [17].",

This can be achieved through antibody binding to viral spikes, thereby interfering with their ability to bind to cellular receptors [18]. The same effect is achieved by antibodies targeting receptors or co-receptors, thereby making the binding sites for viruses unavailable [19]. Another mechanism is post-binding/pre-fusion neutralization and interference with required conformational changes at the cell membrane or endosomal membrane by antibodies that target non-receptor binding regions [20]. Additional mechanisms of virus neutralization include antibody-mediated crosslinking of virions [21], [22], resulting in their immobilization and agglutination, or inhibition of the release of progeny virus, observed e.g. for antibodies against influenza virus [23].",

An alternative model of neutralization is the \u2018critical binding site\u2019 model which is compatible with both a single-or multi-hit theory of neutralization [4].

The extent to which effector functions contribute to protection appears to be specific for different viruses. For HIV-1, it has been demonstrated that a neutralizing mAb engineered not to activate complement is as protective as the wildtype antibody [29]. However, when both complement and the FcRn (neonatal Fc receptor) were abolished, the same antibody showed reduced in vivo protective capacity [29]. While these observations point to an important role of ADCC in HIV neutralization, Fc effector functions do not seem to be required for neutralization of several other viruses, e.g. the antibody Fc region and its associated effector functions are not necessary for neutralization of rabies virus [1]. Equine sera for rabies post-exposure-prophylaxis (PEP) in humans routinely consists of F[ab\u2019]2 fragments which are prepared by pepsin digestion and are devoid of the Fc region [30].",

These considerations are of special importance in the case of Influenza A viruses where both antigenic drift and antigenic shift occur naturally and in the case of HIV where formation of different quasispecies with many different virus variants drives immune evasion. RNA viruses possess RNA polymerases devoid of proofreading and repair capabilities which may result in the emergence of resistant mutants under selective pressure, such as mAb administration. Escape mutants can be generated in vitro under selective pressure of antibodies [33], [34], as observed e.g. with mAbs against chikungunya virus. Intriguingly, high-throughput sequencing also detected the mutated residues associated with the chikungunya viral escapes in sequences derived from virus treated with a non-specific antibody although their proportion was extremely low (0.05\u20130.20% of the total nucleotides at each position), suggesting that minor pre-existing viral quasi-species were amplified under selective pressure [34]. In addition to isolating viral escape mutants in vitro, they can also be isolated in vivo, e.g. influenza H5N1 escape mutants have been isolated from the lungs of mice receiving anti-H5N1 mAbs [35]. Moreover, resistant RSV variants could be isolated from patients receiving palivizumab [36]: Nucleotide sequence analysis of RSV isolates collected directly from infants who received palivizumab and still developed acute lower tract respiratory infection revealed specific mutations in the RSV fusion protein, allowing the virus to escape neutralization [36]. A second generation, affinity-matured variant of palivizumab, termed motavizumab, has recently been developed and investigated in a large comparative phase 3 clinical study of the two preparations. Similar to palivizumab treatment, resistant RSV variants containing certain sequence changes in the RSV envelope protein were generated either in vitro or collected from RSV breakthrough patients receiving motavizumab [36].",

For example, the genus Lyssavirus comprises numerous different closely related virus strains which circulate in a range of different hosts of the orders Carnivora (dogs, wildlife) and Chiroptera (bats) [44], [45]. Following a severe exposure to a rabid animal, the prompt administration of rabies PEP including the administration of human or equine rabies immunoglobulins (HRIG and ERIG, respectively) can prevent development of rabies and death in previously unvaccinated victims [46], [47]. Crucell/Sanofi are developing CL184, a cocktail of two potent mAbs to replace HRIG and ERIG in PEP [48], [49]. This cocktail was designed by applying two main criteria. [50], [51] First, the mAbs should cover a wide range of viral variants, targeting distinct, non-overlapping epitopes and preferably should not compete for antigen binding. Secondly, in vitro-generated mAb-resistant escape mutants selected using one antibody should be neutralized by the other nonselecting mAb in the cocktail and vice versa\n[50], [51]. Crucell's mAb cocktail is undergoing clinical trials [52] and exemplifies how issues of viral heterogeneity and emergence of resistant virus variants can be overcome with a combination of two mAbs.",

In this instance two mAbs that target the influenza A H5N1 hemagglutinin molecule were developed [35]. These mAbs were shown to target different epitopes and demonstrated reciprocal coverage of escape mutants. In combination, the two mAbs showed broad coverage of different clades and no escape variants were detected after therapy [35]. Similarly, a combination of two non-competing human mAbs against SARS-coronavirus (SARS-CoV) has been developed [53]. This combination potentially controls immune escape, extends the breadth of protection and may allow for a lower total antibody dose to be administered for passive immune prophylaxis of SARS-CoV infection. Synergism of neutralizing mAbs has not only been reported for SARS-CoV, but has also been observed e.g. for combinations of two, three, or four mAbs directed against different epitopes on the HIV-1 envelope glycoprotein, leading to a two- to ten-fold increase of neutralization titers [54], [55], [56].",

Bivalent antibody binding can mediate the cross-linking of virions, resulting in their immobilization or agglutination. It has been shown that certain epitopes, e.g. on Herpes simplex virus (HSV), can be efficiently targeted only with bivalent antibody formats (full-size mAb, F[ab\u2019]2) while the use of monovalent antibody formats (scFv, F[ab]) severely diminished neutralization [22]. HSV neutralization by F[ab] fragments could be restored by cross-linkage of F[ab]s, using IgGs reacting with murine F[ab] fragments. These observations demonstrated that neutralization by this mAb is dependent on cross-linkage of glycoprotein B (gB) trimers and that immobilization of gB trimers inhibits activation of the fusogenic signal. Consequently only bivalent mAb derivatives exhibited adequate in vitro neutralizing activity [22].",

Whilst IgM antibodies are generally considered to have low binding affinity and to be important in primary immune responses, secretory IgA (SIgA) is the predominant protective antibody in all mucosal secretions. Its somewhat complicated assembly requirements, which naturally requires a plasma cell to produce dimeric IgA and an epithelial cells that contributes the secretory component, has resulted in slow progress in the development of these mAbs. Although expression is possible in mammalian cell expression systems [59], this approach is difficult to scale-up. However, recombinant secretory antibody production has also been described in plant systems [60] and offers hope for SIgA based prophylaxis of mucosal infections for the future.",

Mature HIV particles express 10\u201315 randomly distributed viral spikes, which would be spaced too far apart for a bivalent antibody to bridge [58], [63], [64]. However, multivalent binding could theoretically still be achieved by altered antibody geometry, e.g. a dimeric form of mAb 2G12 demonstrated substantially increased neutralization potency [65], [66], [67].

The special geometry of the immunoadhesins was shown to overcome the lack of bivalent binding to HIV surface spikes [69]. Another study investigated several novel tetravalent, bispecific antibody derivatives for simultaneous targeting of two different epitopes on the HIV coreceptor CCR5 [70]. These molecules were based on Morrison-type bispecific antibodies which are whole IgGs connected to scFvs via flexible linkers (Fig. 1C). The bispecific mAbs maintained their binding activity towards both individual epitopes, were able to simultaneously block two docking sites of CCR5-tropic HIV strains, and showed 18- to 57-fold increased antiviral activities compared to the parent monospecific antibodies. Interestingly, one prototypic tetravalent CCR5 antibody had antiviral activity against virus strains resistant to the single parental antibodies. In summary, the increased valency and bispecificity translated into enhanced antiviral potency and increased threshold for antiviral resistance [70].",

In addition to the heavy chain immunoglobulins of the Camelidae family, single domain antibodies have been discovered in cartilaginous fish (sharks and possibly rays) [82]. Shark antibodies, also called Ig new antigen receptors (IgNAR), have been developed against hepatitis B virus [82] and Zaire Ebolavirus [83].",

The human serologic response to HIV-1 infection targets both internal and viral surface proteins, but only antibodies targeting the HIV envelope spike gp160 achieve viral neutralization [91]. The conformational flexibility is considered to be the main obstacle to the development of an HIV-1 vaccine, besides the sequence variability and the glycan shield [92]. However, the observation that mAbs targeting certain epitopes can be protective suggests that a vaccine that elicits such antibodies could have a similar effect. These broadly neutralizing mAbs are directed either against gp120 or gp41 [92]. Efforts are focused on designing epitope mimics, in order to direct humoral responses towards these neutralizing epitopes after vaccination. Similar strategies might also be applied to develop more potent vaccines against influenza virus, following the recent identification of broadly neutralizing human mAbs with VH1-69 germline heavy chains [93], [94]. These mAbs were shown to broadly neutralize many influenza A group 1 viruses and crystal structures of a mAb in complex with H1 and H5 hemagglutinins (HAs) revealed a highly conserved epitope in the HA stalk [93]. Subsequent studies have identified human mAbs that show broad neutralizing activity against group 2 viruses and that target conserved epitope in the HA stalk distinct from the epitope recognized by the VH1-69 group 1 antibodies [95]. The mAbs targeting groups 1 and 2 viruses are potentially complementary and may hence open up the prospect of developing a universal influenza vaccine, as opposed to current vaccines which are restricted to the circulating seasonal strains [93], [94], [95].",

RIG is part of the WHO Essential Medicines List for both adults and children, and the use of mAbs could help to overcome the current insufficient supply of antiserum across the developing world, thereby contributing to meet the vision of the United Nations Millennium Declaration. Importantly though, the costs of mAb production and the choice of expression system need to be carefully considered to make any candidate preparations widely available and affordable. The relatively high expenses and the usually short-lived protection of mAbs (due to their limited half-life) may impede their widespread application for diseases for which small molecule drugs and vaccines are available. The costs of 5 monthly doses of palivizumab for RSV prevention are up to 6000 British pounds per patient [99], indicating that the high expenses for mAb development, production and storage can be prohibitive. Access to antiviral mAbs may be restricted, especially in low-income countries, so efforts are being made to develop inexpensive production platforms that are amenable for transfer to the developing world. In particular, the use of transgenic plants has raised hopes that several mAb preparations may become more widely available [60], [71], [100].",

The humanized mAb (e.g. palivizumab) contains both murine (blue) and human (yellow) sequences. B: Scheme of bispecific immunoadhesins. Immunoadhesins were generated using the Knob-into-hole technology which involves the introduction of certain \u2018knob\u2019 and \u2018hole\u2019 mutations in the CH3 domain of the Fc region to fuse two scFv-Fc molecules with different specificities. The mutated Fc regions favor HC heterodimerization over homodimerization, thereby minimizing the pairing of identical halves. C: Scheme of Morrison-type bispecific mAbs. Full-size mAbs and scFvs were fused to each other and issues of antibody stability were addressed by design optimization, including disulfide stabilization of scFvs and various linker designs. D: Scheme of multimeric mAb-fusion molecule. This transgenic plant-derived molecule combines the functional activities of the anti-HIV mAb b12 and the small microbicidal protein cyanovirin",
