Respiratory viruses are the most common cause of ALRI, of which human rhinovirus (RV) is often the most commonly identified [Hayden, 2004]. Advances in molecular diagnosis techniques led to the identification of a third, previously unidentified species, RV\u2010C, in 2006 [Lamson et al., 2006; McErlean et al., 2007]. Although several studies have since investigated the prevalence of RV\u2010C in children with upper and lower respiratory tract infections, these studies have largely been limited to developed countries. The majority of studies investigating all three RV species in children hospitalized with ALRI found that RV\u2010C is the most prevalent RV species and is often associated with more severe illness [Arden et al., 2006; Lamson et al., 2006; Renwick et al., 2007; Lau et al., 2009; Linsuwanon et al., 2009; Miller et al., 2009a, b; Bizzintino et al., 2011].",

Very few studies have investigated the prevalence of RV species in children in sub\u2010Saharan Africa [Smuts et al., 2011; Esposito et al., 2012a, b; Onyango et al., 2012] or the Middle East [Miller et al., 2009a, b]. While these studies confirmed the importance of RV in African children, they were inconclusive with respect to the role of RV species in ALRI. The aim of this study was to describe the distribution of RV species in RV\u2010positive children hospitalized with clinically severe pneumonia (CSP) in Rabat, Morocco and to compare demographic, clinical, and laboratory features between the RV species.",

Seven hundred children who fulfilled the inclusion criteria and provided parent/guardian consent were included in the study. Recruited children underwent standardized procedures including anteroposterior chest X\u2010ray, pulse oximetry (Bionics palm care), and nasopharyngeal aspirates (NPAs) for identification of respiratory viruses. Radiologically confirmed end\u2010point pneumonia was defined as episodes with evidence of consolidation and/or pleural effusion.",

Viral RNA was first extracted from a 240 \u03bcl volume of NPAs using the QIAGEN QIAamp Viral RNA Mini Kit (Spin protocol). This was used for the PCR amplification of a 260\u2010bp variable sequence in the 5\u2032 non\u2010coding region of the RV genome using specifically designed primers. PCR products were then sequenced by the Australian Genome Research Facility using commercially available methods. Genotypes were assigned based on comparisons of the 5\u2032 non\u2010coding region sequences with those of 101 classical serotypes as well as 52 newly identified genotypes using ClustalX software (Conway Institute, University College Dublin, Dublin, Ireland). Representative samples of each genotype were sequenced at the VP4\u2010VP2 coding region to confirm the species assignment [Kiang et al., 2008; Lee et al., 2012].",

The current study shows that of the children infected with RV, those with RV\u2010A compared with RV\u2010C infections were twice as likely to have a discharge diagnosis of pneumonia, half as likely to have a wheeze\u2010related discharge diagnosis and less likely to have wheezed. The current findings are important as they show that the two RV species produce distinctly different clinical patterns in children with an acute respiratory illness that fulfills the WHO diagnostic criteria of CSP. RV\u2010A is associated with an illness that more closely resembles bacterial pneumonia and RV\u2010C is more likely to be associated with airway symptoms. These findings are consistent with previous reports showing that RV\u2010A is be more likely to be associated with fever and less likely to be associate with wheeze than RV\u2010C [Miller et al., 2009a, b]. However, in the setting of the WHO diagnosis of CSP, clearly further studies are needed to determine the prevalence and severity of bacterial co\u2010infections and the presence of viral co\u2010infections.",

However, it is important to note that the populations in the three studies differed in age and clinical presentation. The finding that RV\u2010C is more likely than RV\u2010A to be associated with wheeze has been supported by many studies around the world [Arden et al., 2006; Lamson et al., 2006; Renwick et al., 2007; Lau et al., 2009; Linsuwanon et al., 2009; Miller et al., 2009a, b; Bizzintino et al., 2011], with only a few studies reporting no differences in wheeze between RV\u2010A and RV\u2010C [Wildenbeest et al., 2016].",

Hence, associations between RV species and epidemiological, clinical, and laboratory findings were investigated in Moroccan children for the first time. Physician's attributed discharge diagnosis of pneumonia was more common among RV\u2010A\u2010positive than RV\u2010C\u2010positive children while wheeze was less common among RV\u2010A\u2010positive than RV\u2010C\u2010positive children. RV\u2010C was the most common RV species and wheeze was more common among RV\u2010C than RV\u2010A cases, and these findings have been supported by studies from around the world [McErlean et al., 2007; Miller et al., 2009a, b; Bizzintino et al., 2011] including a study from the Middle East [Miller et al., 2009a, b]. Although Miller et al. found RV\u2010A to be the most common identified species overall in children with respiratory symptoms and/or fever, only RV\u2010C was associated with wheeze. In contrast, in two studies from China [Xiang et al., 2010] and Italy [Esposito et al., 2012b] of childhood pneumonia, RV\u2010A was more common than RV\u2010C, identified in about half the children compared with RV\u2010C, only being identified in 38% and 31% of children, respectively. Hence, RV\u2010C is likely to play a more important role in asthma and wheeze type illness while RV\u2010A plays a more important role in pneumonia. However, this conclusion may also be challenged by findings from this study that radiologically confirmed end\u2010point pneumonia was equally common between RV\u2010A\u2010 and RV\u2010C\u2010positive children.",

RV\u2010A\u2010positive children had a higher axillary temperature than RV\u2010C\u2010positive children. In addition to wheeze, cyanosis was more common among RV\u2010C\u2010positive than RV\u2010A\u2010positive children. Miller et al. reported that children in Jordan with RV\u2010C were more likely to require supplemental oxygen and less likely to report otalgia (ear pain) and suggested that RV\u2010C was more virulent than RV\u2010A [Miller et al., 2009a, b]. The association between RV\u2010C and supplemental oxygen reported by Miller et al. concurs with the finding in this study that RV\u2010C was associated with cyanosis. This study reported relatively low prevalence of hypoxemia (3\u20136%) in both RV\u2010A\u2010 and RV\u2010C\u2010positive children, despite high oxygen provision during admission (72\u201385%). Such a contrast may arise from the fact that oxygen administration at the hospital is very common and proactive, generally starting upon admission, while performing most of the procedures related to canalizing a vein and/or administering the first doses of inhaled bronchodilators. With the exception of wheeze, cyanosis, and axillary temperature, clinical features between children with different RV species were similar, suggesting that many clinical features overlap between the species. Similarly, other studies have also reported no differences in clinical features or severity of illness between RV species [Luchsinger et al., 2014].",

Viral interference or cross\u2010serological protection (as seen with other viruses such as human parainfluenza virus [Lau et al., 2009, 2010] have been suggested as contributing to the alternating activity between RV\u2010A and RV\u2010C.",

Firstly, contemporaneous healthy controls were not included in the analysis to compare the distribution of RV species between sick and healthy children. Previous studies from developing countries have reported RV identification rates of up to 40% in non\u2010respiratory controls [Chidlow et al., 2012]. Secondly, using NPAs, viruses identified in the upper airway may not be entirely representative of the lower airway. However, the use of NPAs for studying lower respiratory disease is widely accepted given the difficulties of obtaining lower respiratory tract samples. Furthermore, utilizing molecular methods to detect RV in NPAs does not allow differentiation to be made between pathogenic and non\u2010pathogenic infection. Even in the absence of other viruses, identification of RV suggests but does not prove RV was the causative agent. Further investigations of viruses present in lower respiratory samples as well as identification of more bacteria in the respiratory tract could contribute to better understanding of the pathogenesis of RV. Finally, the study population comprised a group of WHO\u2010defined CSP cases admitted to a hospital and, hence, our findings may not be representative of respiratory illness overall. Nonetheless, this study provides data on the distribution of RV species in Morocco for the first time, with important findings on the associations between RV\u2010A and pneumonia and RV\u2010C and wheeze.",
