In the communities of people committed to a common goal, the management of resources and services becomes very important. We chose the application domain of human disease research and control.

The network of biomedical databases forms a loose federation of autonomous, distributed, heterogeneous data repositories ripe for information integration. Grid services will provide a dynamic way to use resources in such a large distributed scientific environment while the use of ontology enables the system to carryout reasoning at 3 levels: a) available information in all Bio-Databases (Grid nodes) worldwide, b) reasoning about the retrievable information from each node, c) reasoning about the retrieved information and presenting it in a meaningful format for users. We adopted the ontology design methodology of DOGMA and developed Generic Human Disease Ontology (GenDO) that contains common general information regarding human diseases. The information is represented in 4 \"dimensions\": (a) disease types, (b) causes (c) symptoms and (d) treatments. We illustrate how this GenDO helps to produce Specific Human Disease Ontologies (SpeDO) on request. We show how the combination of two different but complementary techniques, namely Grid computing and ontology, results in a dynamic and intelligent information system. The two approaches together, being complementary, enable the system as a whole.",

MyGrid is building services for integration such as resource discovery, workflow enactment and distributed query processing. The target users of myGrid are tool and service providers who build applications for a community of biologists. Early prototypes of myGrid services were developed and tested with use cases based on the functional analysis of clusters of proteins, identified in a microarray study of genes showing circadian rhythms in Drosophila melanogaster (fruit fly). Following this, a distributed system has been developed to meet the requirements of researchers studying the genetics of Graves' disease [16] .

But it would be very time consuming to figure out for each database one may need, what is in it, what is the value of the information, where it fits into the whole knowledge world and how one can access it. This is where ontologies are needed: a way to capture and present in the computer, knowledge all people in a certain community share. For instance, one could want to combine a medical data source in Europe with a biological data source in China in order to perform an analysis. Firstly, we need Grid services to provide a dynamic way to use resources and services in such a large distributed scientific environment. Secondly, we need domain ontology to describe data and resources in a way that is understandable and usable by the target community. Ontologies can effectively integrate distributed world wide research in the area of disease by aligning and merging relevant information from publication and medical databases, DNA and protein databases, research institutes, health departments, hospitals etc. [5] . Grid middleware can provide the required distributed collaborative platform as well as easy access to resources. Another major advantage of using the Grid is that it respects complete autonomy of the existing ontology nodes. Each of the existing nodes can withdraw or join the Grid whenever it is necessary. This is very important when generating on request Specific Human Disease Ontologies as we show in Section 5.",

An ontology base consists of lexons, expressing facts between terms. Terms are often organized hierarchically in taxonomy. Facts in DOGMA are always true only within a context. A lexicon L consists of a finite set of semantically meaningful concepts, denoted by C and a finite set of Relationships R (L = C \u222a R). An ontology is a formal specification of a shared conceptualization, that is, the knowledge structure that describes the semantics of an information source by commitment to a lexicon L.",

Generic Human Disease Ontology and its four main subontologies: type, phenotype (symptoms), cause and treatment information, the result will be presented in a way that makes it easier for the user to have an overview of the up-to-date knowledge about a specific disorder. Use of ontologies provides us with a more controlled and systematic way to perform information retrieval. Moreover, the inherited organisation of ontologies adds taxonomical context to search results, making it easier for the researcher to spot conceptual relationships in data. The latter fact is important for instance in the case of complex human disorders where one looks for relationships between different factors that are simultaneously responsible for each of the many types of disorders.",
