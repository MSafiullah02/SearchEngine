            "text": "ER stress initiates a molecular cascade involving coordinated activation of specific enzymes and transcription factors that act to alter conditions in the ER to restore homeostasis, but which can induce inflammatory signalling and/or apoptosis if ER stress is chronic or severe.\n9\n Within the ER there are numerous chaperones which associate with proteins during folding to promote correct folding, sense misfolding and prevent protein aggregation. The central factor in initiation of the UPR is a heat shock protein family chaperone GRP78, which is also known as BiP and encoded by the HSPA5 gene. In addition to associating with proteins during folding, GRP78 binds three major ER transmembrane molecules, inositol requiring enzyme 1 (IRE1\u03b1/\u03b2), protein kinase RNA\u2010like ER kinase (PERK) and activating transcription factor 6 (ATF6\u03b1/\u03b2), each of which initiates downstream effectors of the UPR (see Figure 1). When protein misfolding increases, GRP78 accumulates with the misfolded proteins and disassociates from the UPR initiating molecules, triggering their activation and downstream UPR signalling.\n9\n UPR signalling is complex and results in inhibition of translation to relieve protein synthesis load in the ER, expansion of ER, increased production of chaperones and other molecules involved in protein folding, activation of multiple elements of ER\u2010associated degradation (ERAD, which senses and removes misfolded proteins from the ER for ubiquitination and degradation), as well as interaction with non\u2010ER related cellular pathways. HSPA5 mRNA and GRP78 protein are substantially increased by the UPR and regarded as reliable ways to measure ER stress in experiments and in human disease. UPR signalling is comprehensively reviewed elsewhere, so our focus will be on UPR initiated inflammatory signalling.",

IRE1 is an endoribonuclease, which undergoes aggregation and autophosphorylation when GRP78 disengages and/or by direct recognition of misfolded protein complexes by its luminal domain.\n9\n\n,\n\n10\n Although the major function of IRE1 is specific splicing of the X\u2010box\u2010binding protein 1 (XBP1) mRNA resulting in the coding of a transcription factor, which induces UPR target genes;\n11\n\n,\n\n12\n there is evidence that IRE1\u03b2 degrades ER\u2010localised mRNAs perhaps targeting major secreted proteins.\n13\n\n,\n\n14\n Additionally, quite separate from its endonuclease function, the cytoplasmic domain of activated IRE1\u03b1 complexes with the NF\u2010\u03baB protein I\u03baB kinase via the adaptor protein TNF\u2010receptor activating factor 2, leading to degradation of I\u03baB\u03b1,\n15\n providing one of several direct links between ER stress and NF\u2010\u03baB activation. Via TNF\u2010receptor activating factor 2, IRE1 can also induce activation of AKT and JNK connecting ER stress with other major signalling pathways. PERK, like IRE1, is activated by autophosphorylation. Its major functions are to reduce protein translation by phosphorylating eIF2\u03b1, which is a component of the translation initiation complex,\n16\n and to modulate transcription by phosphorylating activating transcription factor 4.\n12\n\n,\n\n13\n The PERK\u2010initiated inhibition of translation in ER\u2010stressed cells results in decreased translation of I\u03baB\u03b1, therefore leading to greater translocation of NF\u2010\u03baB transcription factors to the nucleus.\n17\n\n,\n\n18\n In response to protein misfolding ATF6\u03b1 and ATF6\u03b2 translocate from the ER to the Golgi where they are cleaved by the S1P and S2P (site 1 and site 2) proteases, resulting in the release and translocation to the nucleus of the active transcription factors.\n19\n Following exposure to the bacterial subtilase cytotoxin the ATF6 arm of the UPR also appears to activate NF\u2010\u03baB via phosphorylation of AKT, independently of the IRE1 or PERK pathways.\n20\n Although AKT has been shown to locate to the ER during ER stress, the mechanism by which ATF6 leads to AKT phosphorylation is unknown. There is also some evidence that ER overload, even in the absence of significant misfolding, can result in NF\u2010\u03baB activation in a classical UPR\u2010independent, but Ca2+\u2010 and ROS\u2010dependent, manner.\n21\n Another less well\u2010established proposed mechanism by which ER stress activates NF\u2010\u03baB involves leakage of GRP78 into the cytoplasm during stress leading to a direct interaction between cytoplasmic GRP78 and the NF\u2010\u03baB protein I\u03baB kinase complex.\n22\n\n",

Preconditioning with ER stress by prior exposure to ER stressors like tunicamycin or thapsigargin, decreases disease severity in models of renal inflammation, including Heymann nephritis and mesangio\u2010proliferative glomerulonephritis.\n23\n\n,\n\n24\n Preconditioned mesangial cells show decreased NF\u2010\u03baB activation in response to LPS, which is mediated by a PERK and IRE1\u2010dependent increase in Ccaat\u2010enhancer binding proteins proteins, particularly Ccaat\u2010enhancer binding protein\u03b2, which are known inhibitors of activation of NF\u2010\u03baB in response to inflammatory cytokines.\n25\n\n,\n\n26\n In a similar fashion ER stress preconditioning in endothelial cells inhibits TNF\u03b1\u2010induced NF\u2010\u03baB activation. Inhibition of NF\u2010\u03baB in these cells is dependent on a negative feedback loop involving a XBP1 transcription factor\u2010dependent decrease in IRE1 activation by a yet to be determined mechanism.\n27\n The subtilase cytotoxin\u2010induced ER stress\u2010mediated activation of NF\u2010\u03baB described above also results in an increase in the A20 protein, which is a NF\u2010\u03baB inhibitor.

Although severe ER stress can trigger apoptosis, via the transcription factor CCAAT/enhancer\u2010binding protein homologous protein (CHOP) and other mechanisms, apoptosis in the absence of danger signals should not trigger immune activation. However, there is evidence that ER stress\u2010induced apoptosis can provide danger signals to antigen presenting cells (APCs). ER stress induced by thapsigargin, which interferes with ER Ca2+ transport, results in increased cell surface expression of calreticulin, which is an ER chaperone for glycoproteins. Increased cell surface calreticulinexpression in cells experiencing ER stress results in increased phagocytosis of those cells by APCs, and increased production of inflammatory cytokines by the APCs when co\u2010exposed to Toll\u2010like receptor (TLR)\u2010ligand.\n29\n Yet to be identified soluble factors produced by ER stressed tumour cells also appear to \u2018transmit\u2019 ER stress to macrophages resulting in UPR activation and increased production of IL\u20106 and IL\u201023, which is accentuated when the macrophages are also exposed to LPS.\n30\n ER stress in the APCs themselves results in increased ER retention of antigen (antigen processing during ER stress is discussed in detail below), increased production of IL\u201023 and enhanced T\u2010cell stimulation with increased production of IFN\u03b3 and TNF\u03b1 by T cells.\n31\n\n,\n\n32\n Another example of ER stress contributing to inflammation is the deposition of hyaluronan into the extracellular matrix by cultured colonial\n33\n and respiratory\n34\n smooth muscle cells and respiratory epithelial cells\n33\n\n,\n\n34\n during ER stress by a mechanism not yet understood, which results in increasing local recruitment of inflammatory leucocytes. In the muscle cells hyaluronan deposition was also seen following poly(I,C) exposure/TLR3 signalling, but this was not seen in poly(I,C)\u2010exposed epithelial cells, which are the major targets of respiratory viral infection.\n34\n ER stress in the liver can induce systemic inflammation by inducing release of the acute phase proteins serum amyloid P\u2010component and C\u2010reactive protein into the circulation.\n35\n Transcription of serum amyloid P\u2010component and C\u2010reactive protein in hepatocytes is mediated by the activation of an ER resident pro\u2010transcription factor, cAMP\u2010responsive element\u2010binding protein 3\u2010like protein 3 (CREBH), which translocates from the ER to Golgi and is cleaved by Golgi\u2010resident proteases to form the active transcription factor. Systemic LPS or pro\u2010inflammatory cytokines can via this mechanism result in hepatic ER stress, CREBH activation and release of serum amyloid P\u2010component and C\u2010reactive protein.\n35\n Clearly there are multiple mechanisms by which ER stress can promote inflammation, many of which may be dependent on the nature of the ER stressor and the differentiated characteristics of the ER stress affected cells. Another consideration is that immune effector cells often produce large amounts of secretory proteins and can experience ER stress, and that a functional UPR is important for their competence. For example, B cells require XBP1 to continue appropriate antibody production\n36\n and macrophages require XBP1 for cytokine production,\n37\n which will be discussed later in the review.",

Protein misfolding and ER stress would be predicted to affect Class I antigen presentation in several different ways, however, there are somewhat contradictory experimental data on the effect of ER stress on antigen presentation. Misfolded proteins that can be denatured and removed from the ER by ERAD should be more likely to be degraded in the proteasome and presented by Class I. However, while it is clear that increased degradation of cytoplasmic proteins leads to increased Class I presentation,\n48\n at least in some model systems misfolding of ER proteins does not lead to increased presentation.\n49\n One important consideration is that the PERK\u2010induced inhibition of translation will reduce ER protein biosynthesis. One experimental study provides evidence for lowered cell surface Class I presentation during ER stress with some contribution via reduced production of Class I itself, but a larger contribution from reduced peptide loading resulting in ER retention of Class I.\n50\n In contrast, another study shows increasing Class I presentation of the tyrosinase antigen in melanoma cells with increasing misfolding of tyrosinase.\n51\n This is an important area for further research as genetic or environmentally induced protein misfolding could lead to a higher likelihood of induction and expansion of autoreactive T cells in an immunologically susceptible individual.

            "text": "Thus, far we have considered how ER stress may modulate inflammation, but another important consideration is how inflammation and infection\u2010related factors in the microenvironment affect protein folding, ER stress and the UPR. There are surprisingly few direct studies of how individual inflammatory factors affect protein folding and ER stress. Oxidative stress is well known to increase protein misfolding and inflammatory cytokines can induce oxidative stress, and activated granulocytes and macrophages release oxidative stressors. In fibrosarcoma cells TNF\u03b1 induces intracellular ROS which in turn induces ER stress, but preconditioning of these cells to ER stress by inducing misfolding was protective against the deleterious effects of ROS.\n52\n NO produced during an inflammatory setting can also activate the UPR by inhibiting the production of protein disulphide isomerases, resulting in the accumulation of proteins within the ER.\n53\n In pancreatic beta cells IL\u20101\u03b2, and to a lesser extent TNF\u03b1 and IFN\u03b3, increase ER stress in a nitric oxide dependent manner.\n54\n Another way in which inflammatory cytokines may induce ER stress is by driving increased synthesis of secretory proteins, many of which, such as the molecules produced in mucosal defence, are complex proteins that are likely to be susceptible to misfolding. IL\u201010, which has a key role in maintaining intestinal homeostasis, appears to modulate the UPR by inhibiting nuclear translocation of ATF6 in a p38\u2010mediated fashion.\n22\n A very limited study in colon cancer cells suggests that a combination of the inflammatory cytokines IFN\u03b3 and TNF\u03b1 induces ER stress.\n55\n Although these experiments suggest that inflammatory factors can modulate ER stress, much more comprehensive studies are required before we can understand how the diverse combinations of inflammatory factors produced during infection and sterile inflammatory disease impact on ER stress.",

As described above, some microbial toxins enter the ER and directly induce ER stress and UPR signalling. ER stress\u2010induced production of the transcription factor CHOP is suppressed by TLR3 or TLR4 ligands by inhibiting eIF2\u03b1 induction of activating transcription factor 4 in a TRIF\u2010dependent manner.\n56\n In a somewhat surprising finding, a recent study has shown that both TLR2 and TLR4 signalling in macrophages results in what is claimed to be ER stress\u2010independent activation of IRE1\u03b1 and splicing of XBP1 resulting in transcriptional changes somewhat different to those following ER\u2010stress\u2010induced XBP1 splicing.\n37\n Additionally, by using XBP1 null cells it was shown that XBP1 increases cytokine production, particularly IL\u20106, in response to TLR2 and TLR4 ligands and intracellular bacteria. Although these effects are claimed to be independent of ER stress, they are mediated via activation of NAPDH oxidase and production of ROS, which are known to induce ER stress.\n37\n In non\u2010sterile inflammation the contribution of microbial factors to UPR signalling clearly needs to be given consideration.",

The respiratory mucosa also contains epithelial cells that synthesise complex cell surface proteins, and secrete mucins and anti\u2010microbial proteins. Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a form of interstitial pneumonia that has a strong linkage to ER stress. Families with familial IPF that carry misfolding mutations in the surfactant protein\u2010C (SFTPC) gene show evidence of ER stress and UPR activation in epithelial cells that is enhanced following viral infection, which is often the trigger for the onset of clinically evident disease in these individuals,\n77\n\n,\n\n78\n and is known to induce ER stress.\n79\n This suggests that an infection mediated boost in translation of SFTPC, perhaps coupled with secreted inflammatory ER stressors, exacerbates ER stress and leads to a cycle of chronic inflammation and fibrosis after the pathogen is cleared. In addition to this linkage with familial IPF, there is also evidence of ER stress in sporadic IPF.\n80\n A relatively common promoter polymorphism in the MUC5B mucin (\u223c10% allele frequency in healthy individuals) increases the risk of familial interstitial pneumonia 7\u2010fold in heterozygotes and 21\u2010fold in homozygotes, and sporadic IPF 9\u2010fold in heterozygotes and 22\u2010fold in homozygotes.\n81\n This was an unexpected finding given that IPF is generated in the small airways not usually characterised by mucin production, and one possible mechanism postulated was ER stress.\n81\n\n,\n\n82\n At the same time an independent study showed atypical expression of MUC5B in surface epithelial cells in peripheral bronchioles in the majority of IPF patients in the absence of the normal goblet cell transcription factor SPDEF.\n83\n SPDEF drives not only mucin expression but AGR2 and other molecules required for mucin biosynthesis.\n84\n Taken together, these studies suggest that the MUC5B polymorphism results in inappropriate expression of MUC5B in cells lacking protein disulphide isomerases and other molecules required for correct folding, resulting in misfolding of MUC5B, ER stress, UPR and NF\u2010\u03baB activation, chronic inflammatory signalling and eventually the clinical presentation as fibrotic disease.",

The major contributor to lung disease has always been thought to be simply due to deficiency of the protease inhibitor leading to tissue damage from granulocyte proteases such as neutrophil elastase. However, a recent study has shown that resting monocytes from individuals homozygous for the misfolding mutation show AAT ER accumulation and UPR activation, and following LPS activation these monocytes secrete more inflammatory cytokines.\n86\n The conclusion is that the lung disease arises, at least in part, because of hypersensitivity to inflammation perhaps following an infectious trigger, which will be compounded by the loss of the protease inhibitor. Interestingly, the authors speculate the reason why this misfolding mutation may be common is that heterozygous individuals may have some priming of their innate immunity because of misfolding while still producing AAT from their wild\u2010type allele, giving a selective advantage under some infectious challenges. Another respiratory disease involving misfolding is cystic fibrosis (CF). The CFTR chloride ion transporter has a high propensity to misfold and the most common CFTR mutation (\u0394508) in CF is a misfolding mutation resulting in ER retention. Although loss of CFTR function is the critical cause of CF, the \u0394508 mutation results in UPR and NF\u2010\u03baB activation and there is substantial interest in how ER stress augments the CF phenotype in the lung and the gut.\n5\n\n,\n\n87\n\n,\n\n88\n Bronchial epithelial cells with the \u0394508 mutation are more susceptible to respiratory viral infection/replication that appears to relate to altered ER conditions induced by misfolding of CFTR.\n89\n ER stress has also been reported in human chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, a largely a smoking\u2010induced condition that responds partially to anti\u2010inflammatory therapy, and in cigarette smoke exposed mouse lungs.\n90\n Asthma is characterised by a TH2 immune response and goblet cell hyperplasia and mucus secretion, and there are no studies addressing ER stress in asthma.
