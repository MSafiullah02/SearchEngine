Both a recent situational analysis [14] and a qualitative study [15] in the Torres Strait region of Australia identified low levels of knowledge about CHB both in health care providers and Indigenous Australian patients with CHB. Christie et al. [16] have explored views of health literacy in the particular cultural context of remote Indigenous communities in the NT, as well as carrying out a scoping study looking at ways to improve health literacy in this region. Christie (2010) suggests that \u201ceffective health literacy is largely to do with effective communication\u201d (p.40). Based on their research, they argue that building on an individual\u2019s existing knowledge using a culturally appropriate approach (i.e. a relevant respectful partnership which is mindful of language, worldview, existing knowledge and beliefs) to achieve a shared understanding of the issue at hand is more beneficial than attempts by health practitioners to simply \u2018transfer\u2019 biomedical knowledge to their patients [17]. Although many health promotion or information resources exist for hepatitis B [18], all the above [13\u201317] studies as well as the Australian National Hepatitis B strategy [19] highlight the lack of culturally appropriate resources, in particular visual and multimedia resources, available to facilitate shared understandings of Hepatitis B and strengthen health literacy.",

Miscommunication between health providers and patients has been reported to be pervasive, however using interpreters and translators is perceived to be only part of the solution [20]. Different worldviews and knowledge systems that exist among Indigenous Australians, including alternative concepts of physiology, pathology and disease causation also contribute [23]. An often misinformed assumption by health providers of shared understandings [20], along with the absence of opportunities and resources to construct a body of shared understanding perpetuate this miscommunication. Two specific factors, culture and worldview, are increasingly acknowledged as important antecedents contributing to health literacy [24\u201327]. There are a myriad of different definitions of culture; when referring to culture in this paper we use the broad definition of the culture of a society as \u201c\u2026 the totality of its shared beliefs, norms, values, rituals, language, history, knowledge and social character\u201d [28].",

However prior to this project informal discussions regarding the issues facing the community with respect to the burden of disease produced by Hepatitis B, the lack of community understanding and the difficulties health workers have in explaining Hepatitis B to community members had been discussed within clinic meetings and with the visiting liver clinic service. The impetus for the project came from the community clinic. Their enthusiasm for the project led to the development of a collaborative research partnership between the community clinic, the Royal Darwin hospital liver clinic and Menzies School of Health Research and establishment of the formal PAR process.",

Multiple logistical issues were also felt to contribute to an almost fatalistic view of what was achievable, such as: the remote and dispersed nature of the patient population; the difficulty accessing secondary care physicians and investigations, especially liver ultrasound; the turnover of health care professionals, and lack of continuity of care. In the context of these factors it was perceived that CHB is just too complex a problem to tackle.

A lack of biomedical knowledge about hepatitis B was identified in Indigenous individuals across all groups interviewed. This is consistent with data from Indigenous individuals in the Torres Strait [15] as well as non-Indigenous Australians from culturally and linguistically diverse backgrounds [13]. Lack of knowledge and erroneous beliefs about hepatitis B, as well as contributing to low levels of health literacy, may lead to a reduced ability or willingness to participate in decision making about management plans. This in turn may influence adherence with the plan and subsequent necessary self-care activities. Multiple factors affecting the provider side of the patient-provider interaction were also identified. Communication skills to allow shared understandings to be developed as well as insight into how best to achieve this are crucial in our context, where there are multiple competing priorities; however lack of these skills is identified in our results as an ongoing barrier to achieving shared understandings. In the context of Australian Indigenous peoples where English is not the first language and culture and worldview are very different we would suggest that the patient-provider interaction not only significantly contributes to health literacy but is a pre-requisite to allowing access & utilisation of care and self-care to occur and so ultimately influencing health outcomes (Figure 3).",

More recently, research suggesting that some Indigenous patients believe that health care workers deliberately withhold information from them highlights the extreme lack of trust that can develop as a consequence of ineffective communication [21]. As communication transcends all aspects of health literacy, hence \u201cculturally safe communication\u201d at both a system and individual level is clearly integral to its improvement. Culturally safe communication has also been suggested as being important in reducing ethnic and racial disparities in healthcare [39]. Specifically in the Australian Aboriginal context, involvement of the local community in developing and implementing health education programmes, so they are culturally safe, has been shown to directly influence their effectiveness [29, 30, 40] and attention to worldview and language are argued to be integral to achieving improvements in health education [41]. It is therefore disappointing that more than a decade after the publication of Cass et al\u2019s [20] paper documenting the pervasive nature of miscommunication between Indigenous people and their health care professionals, our results show the major barrier to achieving critical health literacy is still poor cross-cultural communication. Consistent with the view of Vass et al. [41] who suggest \u201cthe health literacy of Indigenous Australians can be improved by promoting the oral use of the peoples\u2019 first language in the health sphere\u201d Indigenous participants anticipate they will better understand and be able to process and act on information given to them in their own language.",
