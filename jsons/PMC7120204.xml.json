According to CDC [30], between January 2003, the beginning of the civilian vaccination program, and October 31, 2004, at least 39,597 civilians were vaccinated against smallpox. The civilian program declined by the summer of 2003, temporally linked with three events that began in March 2003: These were the unexpected finding of myopericarditis in a small percentage of vaccinees, a growing appreciation of the risks of vaccination, and the apparent absence of biological weapons in Iraq, as confirmed subsequent to invasion. In the DoD, between December 13, 2002, and October 14, 2004, over 656,000 smallpox vaccinations were administered [24] (www.smallpox.army.mil/event/SPSafetySum.asp). Unlike the civilian program, the DoD smallpox vaccination program has continued without pause, and in fact, expanded in the latter half of 2004. On June 28, 2004, a memorandum from the Pentagon by the Deputy Secretary of Defense directed the expansion of the vaccination programs in the military for both smallpox and anthrax. Expansion of vaccination included \u201call uniformed DoD personnel serving in the Central Command Area of Responsibility,\u201d which includes central Asia, parts of east Africa, and the Korean peninsula areas considered at special risk for military personnel [31] (www.smallpox.army.mil/resources/policies.asp).\n",

This scenario builds on the work published from Australia in 2001 involving mousepox (ectromelia) with a gene inserted for interleukin (IL)-4 [49]. The IL-4 cytokine weakens the cell-mediated immune response against viruses such as orthopoxviruses, by inhibiting cytotoxic T-cells and interferon (IFN)-\u03b3 production. Clinically, the mice infected with this IL-4-modified mousepox had increased mortality and significantly decreased protection against mousepox by prior vaccination [49].",

However, IL-4-modified vaccinia virus has been studied recently in a mouse model. In these experiments, reported in 2004 by NIH researchers, an otherwise fatal challenge with vaccinia virus that had been modified to express murine IL-4 could be prevented by prior immunization with the non-replicating, attenuated vaccinia virus, Modified Vaccinia Ankara (MVA) [50]. This was an important finding because vaccinia virus, with or without the expression of IL-4, can infect humans (as well as mice), whereas mousepox virus does not infect humans.",

In contrast, mousepox infection of susceptible mice (BALB/c and A/J) resulted in little or no IFN-\u03b3, but instead resulted in production of IL-4. Deletion of the IL-4 gene did not change the disease in the susceptible mice, but loss of IFN-\u03b3 function in the resistant mice lead to 100% mortality. Similar earlier studies [54] from Australia and Japan found that mousepox-susceptible mice (BALB/c) were made less susceptible when \u201cSTAT-6\u201d (signal transducer and activator of transcription), the intracellular signaling molecule for IL-4, was deleted.",

Since the Th1 IFN-\u03b3 and the type 2 cytokine IL-4 are cross-inhibitory [51, 52], the impairment of IFN-\u03b3 may be at least as important as the enhancement of IL-4. A strong cellular immune response (controlled by type 1 or Th1 cytokines) may be more critical than a predominant antibody immune response (controlled by type 2 or Th2 cytokines); this is particularly true when response is directly associated with a weak cell-mediated immune response as evidenced by impaired IFN-\u03b3 and cytotoxic T-cell production. In the early 1990 s, IFN-\u03b3 itself had been reported to have antiviral activity against vaccinia [55\u201357].",

Specifically, for the rare cases of progressive vaccinia that do not respond to Vaccinia Immune Globulin (VIG), and for which surgical therapy (resection) is being considered, along with VIG, subcutaneous IFN-\u03b3 could be administered under an investigational new drug (IND) protocol, if one were available. If successful in such a clinical setting, IFN-\u03b3 use would avoid surgical resection.",

Vaccinia virus is not spread via respiratory droplets, and therefore no respiratory precautions are needed for persons vaccinated with vaccinia. Some serious vaccination reactions can be treated with VIG, whereas smallpox disease due to variola virus is not responsive to VIG. An intravenous formulation of VIG has replaced the older intramuscular formulation (IM) [64\u201366] after approval by the FDA on February 18, 2005 (www.fda.gov/cber/products/vigivdyn021805.htm) [64\u201366].

Out of 39,213 vaccinees, the CDC identified 5 probable and 16 suspected cases of myopericarditis after smallpox vaccination [81]. The DoD published their initial findings in June 2003 [82] and in two updated articles [83, 84] in 2004 as well as on the DoD website dedicated to their smallpox vaccination program (www.smallpox.army.mil/event/SPSafetySum.asp). A causal relationship has been accepted for the myopericarditis, in part because it is more common in the DoD after primary vaccination than revaccination, because of its occurrence within 7\u201314 days after vaccination, and because of the absence of other etiologies. The DoD reported in 2004 a statistically significant association between developing myopericarditis and being male and white. Among primary vaccinees there was a significantly increased risk of myopericardits within 30 days after smallpox vaccination, with an observed incidence of 16.11/100,000. In contrast, the DoD found no increased risk of myopericarditis in revaccinees [83]. No deaths have occurred, and the prognosis has been good for a full recovery after vaccine-associated myopericarditis. The DoD reported that 64 of the initial 67 patients (96%) had normalization of their functional status, echocardiography, EKG, and graded exercise testing at a mean of 32 weeks\u2019 follow-up. Atypical, but non-limiting, persistent chest discomfort was reported by 8 of the 67 patients (13%) [84].",

Sixteen other cases of \u201cischemic heart disease\u201d such as angina or myocardial infarction occurred within 6 weeks after smallpox vaccination in the 656,000 vaccinees, but these cases were judged to be \u201csimilar to what normally occurs among unvaccinated military personnel of similar age\u201d [86, October 14, 2003, summary at www.smallpox.mil/event/panelreport.asp]. Forty cases of generalized vaccinia were reported, and most were treated as outpatients; 50 cases of contact vaccinia were found, nearly all between spouses and adult intimate contacts outside the workplace [24]. More importantly, no cases of vaccinia transmission occurred between the 27,700 vaccinated health-care workers (HCWs) and patients or co-workers. Neither progressive vaccinia nor eczema vaccinatum cases were observed in military or civilian vaccinees (www.smallpox.army.mil/event/SPSafetySum.asp). Similarly, there were no episodes of vaccinia transmission from a civilian health-care worker to a patient or a co-worker.",

Soon after smallpox vaccination, the first for this 19-year-old army recruit, the patient presented with AIDS-defining cryptococcal meningitis, and oral candidiasis. His CD4 T-cell count was <25 cells/ul. Four weeks after vaccination, while hospitalized for meningitis, a 3 cm \u00d7 4 cm ulcer developed at the vaccination site, and then over the next 3 days, 80\u2013100 pustular lesions appeared on the posterior legs and buttocks.

Henderson doubted this interpretation, pointing out that the one person who was ostensibly infected by the aerosol actually had a mild case. All other cases resulted from secondary transmission, and the three who subsequently manifested hemorrhagic smallpox did not transmit infection to others. This would be consistent with Rao\u2019s thesis that the cause of hemorrhagic smallpox relates to host response rather than to the intrinsic character of the virus strain [8, 112].",

Although earlier clinicians, such as Osler in his 1892 textbook of Medicine, had recognized two types of hemorrhagic smallpox, a rapidly fatal \u201cblack smallpox\u201d and a later pustular form [113], the most detailed description of the clinical and epidemiological aspects of the disease has been given by Rao. In 1964, he published a paper describing in detail 240 hemorrhagic cases seen between 1959 and 1963, representing 2.3% of 10,857 total smallpox cases [106]. In his 1972 smallpox monograph [8], Rao reviewed 200 patients with hemorrhagic smallpox beginning in 1961 (and thus partially overlapping with his earlier series from 1959 to 1963), for a total of 385 cases of hemorrhagic smallpox out of approximately 30,000 total smallpox cases he had seen over 30 years of his work in India. Rao reported that, of these 385 cases of hemorrhagic smallpox, not even one transmitted hemorrhagic smallpox to another person, suggesting that it was the host response rather than the virus strain that was the critical variable.[8].",

Working in Calcutta, they isolated variola virus from 75 patients, comparing 25 with hemorrhagic smallpox, 25 with confluent smallpox, and 25 with discrete smallpox [114]. They used four methods to assess virulence: at least 50% mortality in the chick embryo, at least 50% mortality in infant mice, the histopathology of pocks on the chorioallantoic membrane (CAM), and at least 1,000 pock-forming units (PFU) per gram of liver in an infected chick embryo. These four methods were used, in part, because there were no standard methods to assay virulence of the variola virus. A positive result leading to being classified as more virulent was found in all four assays in 48% of hemorrhagic smallpox cases, compared with 36% of confluent cases, and 0% of discrete-type smallpox cases. A virological mechanism for these findings has never been reported, but one methodological difference, albeit of uncertain significance, is that the variola virus from all 25 hemorrhagic smallpox cases was isolated from venous blood, whereas 49/50 confluent and discrete cases were isolated from vesicular or pustular fluid. These studies from 1967 have not been replicated or restudied.",

These are ACAM 2000 grown in African green monkey kidney (\u201cVero\u201d cells) made by Acambis in partnership with Baxter and a chick embryo cell-culture smallpox vaccine made by Bavarian Nordic, a Danish company. The ACAM 2000 vaccine uses a vaccinia virus derived from the New York City Board of Health seed strain [131, 132]; Bavarian Nordic uses a Lister-derived vaccinia strain. On September 1, 2007, the FDA announced licensure of this second-generation smallpox vaccine, ACAM 2000, including a medication guide (www.fda.gov/cber/products/acam2000qa.htm). This six-page medication guide includes information regarding possible side effects of the vaccine, what are the medical conditions that predispose to some of these side effects, how to care for the vaccination site, and what to avoid after getting vaccinated. As of 2007, Acambis has produced and supplied to the US stockpile some 200 million doses of their new vaccine.",

In studies performed in Dutch military recruits, \u223c50,000 of whom received VIG before smallpox vaccination using a European strain of vaccinia, compared with the same number receiving a placebo before vaccination, only three recruits developed encephalitis in the group receiving VIG compared to 14 controls.
