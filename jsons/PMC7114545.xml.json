Among them, canine parvovirus (CPV), a member of the family Parvoviridae, is a major cause of hemorrhagic gastroenteritis in dogs (Decaro and Buonavoglia, 2012, Miranda and Thompson, 2016). CPV are small, nonenveloped viruses consisting of a single-stranded, negative sense DNA (\u223c5.2 kb) molecule (Berns and Parrish, 2013, Parrish, 1999, Reed et al., 1988). The CPV genome contains two large open reading frames (ORF). The right ORF encodes 2 structural proteins (VP1 and VP2) by alternative splicing of the same mRNAs, whilst the left ORF codes for 2 nonstructural proteins (NS1 and NS2). The CPV VP2 capsid protein is antigenically significant, and has been implicated in governing host range restriction, tropism, and viral-host interactions (Decaro and Buonavoglia, 2012, Miranda and Thompson, 2016, Parrish, 1999).",

CPV emerged as a new enteric pathogen of domestic dogs in the late 1970s, possibly through host switching events involving a feline panleukopenia parvovirus, or a closely related virus (Berns and Parrish, 2013, Parrish, 1999). As a result of accumulation of mutations in the VP2- encoding gene, the original CPV strain (strain CPV-2) eventually got replaced with antigenic variants CPV-2a, CPV-2b, CPV-2c, new CPV-2a, and new CPV-2b that are variously distributed in dog populations worldwide (Decaro and Buonavoglia, 2012, Miranda and Thompson, 2016).",

Lack of vaccination, incomplete vaccination schedules, or vaccine failures, primarily due to interference with maternal antibodies may predispose dogs to natural infection. Moreover, some studies have raised questions on the complete efficacy of the current CPV vaccines against the CPV antigenic variants, as these vaccines were derived from old CPV-2 strains (Decaro et al., 2008, Decaro et al., 2009, Decaro and Buonavoglia, 2012, Miranda and Thompson, 2016, Truyen, 2006). In the present study, nearly half (11/25) of the CPV positive dogs did not receive any vaccine, whilst 2 puppies did not attain the recommended minimum age of vaccination (6 weeks) at the time of sampling (Table 1). Among the vaccinated dogs that tested positive for CPV (4/25), only one animal had received two doses of the vaccine (Table 1). Therefore, lack of, or inadequate protective immunity might have predisposed these dogs to CPV disease, although the role/s of other risk factors, such as endoparasitism and unsanitary environments cannot be ruled out (Miranda et al., 2015). On the other hand, no information was available on the immunization status of the remaining CPV positive dogs (Table 1). Information on vaccination status was available for only 26 of the 79 dogs that tested negative for CPV. Eleven of these dogs received one, or more doses of CPV vaccine before sampling, whilst 15 were not immunized against CPV.",

Although PCR/RT-PCR have been used extensively for detection of CPV/CCoV in many studies including recent reports, these screening assays have been shown to be relatively less sensitive than qPCR/RT-qPCR (Decaro et al., 2005a, Decaro et al., 2005b; Duque-Garc\u00eda et al., 2017; Kumar and Nandi, 2010; Miranda and Thompson, 2016; Ntafis et al., 2013; Wang et al., 2016). One of the limitation of this study was the use of PCR/RT-PCR as screening assays. However, considering the lack of data from the Caribbean region, the present study primarily focused on detection and molecular characterization of circulating strains rather than strictly monitoring prevalence. New CPV-2a (CPV-2a-297A) was found to be the predominant CPV variant on St. Kitts. CPV-2a has been shown to be the major variant in Asia, whilst CPV-2c, or CPV-2b were predominant in most studies from the North and South Americas (Miranda and Thompson, 2016, Zhou et al., 2017). However, the predominance of CPV-2a variants in recent studies from Columbia, Uruguay, and St. Kitts pointed towards the changing epidemiology of CPV in this part of the world. The KNA CCoV strains were genetically closely related to Brazilian CCoV-I strains, which may be attributed to the geographical proximity of the Caribbean region to Latin American countries. Although this is the first report on detection and genetic diversity of CPV and CCoVs from the Caribbean region, the present study was based on a single island. In order to gain vital insights into the molecular epidemiology of these important canine viruses across the entire Caribbean region, similar studies are required in the other islands.",
