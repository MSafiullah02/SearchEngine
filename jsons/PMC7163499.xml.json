Therefore, an increased risk of PJP during treatment was not reported. An extended risk of PJP following FCR has similarly not been reported with PJP being identified infrequently in the first 12 months of remission in both previously treated and untreated patients 6, 16.

Both conventional and quantitative PCR are sensitive and specific for identifying Pneumocystis in respiratory secretions 18, but are unable to distinguish infection from colonisation. Pneumocystis colonisation is described in patients with haematological malignancies, although rates are unknown 18. Quantitative PCR has been proposed as one method for differentiating infection from colonisation with one study showing copy numbers were significantly higher in definite and probable PJP patients than in colonised patients 19. Although clinically relevant cut\u2010off values have not been validated 17, 19, the low median cycle threshold for P. jirovecii DNA detection (and hence high organism burden) in our cohort is suggestive of infection rather than colonisation. The presence of respiratory symptoms, compatible radiological changes, elevated inflammatory markers, and response to treatment further favours infection over colonisation.",

This correlates with the risk of late infection being 10% in the first year of remission after FCR and 4% in the second year 4. In patients infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), there is a strong association between CD4+ counts <140 cells/\u03bcL and PJP risk 27. Monitoring of CD4+ counts has also been used to identify immunocompromised HIV\u2010negative patients who may be at risk of PJP 28. In our cohort, where CD4+ counts were measured at the time of PJP diagnosis, five of six patients (83%) had values <140 cells/\u03bcL. Of interest also is the recovery of CD4+ counts within 12 months following FCR in the three patients.

Fludarabine\u2010related pulmonary toxicity was reported at a single US centre in up to 8.6% of treated patients 30, with onset usually within 1 week following FCR. However, this putative phenomenon has not been reproduced by other centres or larger prospective studies 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. Even if accepted as a possible cause, such fludarabine\u2010related pneumonitis would not explain the later presentations observed in our series. An alternative infective diagnosis was also considered unlikely given the extensive investigation for co\u2010pathogens on BAL specimens. The absence of detectable cytomegalovirus in blood (by PCR) or typical radiological changes in invasive fungal infection or bacterial pneumonia suggest the additional organisms were unlikely to be of clinical significance.

Similarly, further evaluation of the role of CD4+ monitoring is warranted to quantify risk of disease development and to guide duration of prophylaxis.
