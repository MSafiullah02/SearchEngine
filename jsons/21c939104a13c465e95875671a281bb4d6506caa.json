            "text": "The composition and distribution of littoral vegetation in four weir pools of the lower Murray were surveyed in summer 1994. Between-weir gradients in the amplitude of water level fluctuations were reflected in the typical distributions of plants, with a 4-6 m elevational range in upper-pool sites, where levels fluctuate most, and a 1 -1.5 m band in the lower-pool sites, where levels are more stable. Forty-one of 48 species occurred across much of the longitudinal \u00d7 elevational site matrix within this cone-shaped distribution, indicating considerable tolerance to flooding and exposure; this was especially apparent for Phragmites australis, Cyperus spp. and Centipeda spp. The 41 species were represented in seven of nine water-regime groups identified by cluster analysis. The remainder, found within 9 1 m of the water surface in lower-pool reaches, were aquatic macrophytes such as Vallisneria americana and Typha spp. and amphibious 'mudmats' such as Glossostigma elatinoides. Water regimes at given sites were measured by the number of days in 2 years flooded to any depth ( \\ 0 cm), or to 0 -30 cm, and by days exposed by \\ 100 cm. Inter-pool differences in the median number of days flooded to \\ 0 cm and 0 -30 cm were 3 -30% and B 8%, respectively, for all species except Typha spp. but an order of magnitude for the number of days exposed by \\ 100 cm. However, eight of 14 common or representative species analysed showed significant inter-pool differences in the number of days flooded to \\0 cm, indicating that sufficient variation exists to necessitate considerable intra-pool replication to allow for the detection of statistical differences in a multi-pool experiment. The practice of maintaining stable weir pool levels limits vegetation processes, e.g. germination, recruitment, decomposition. An increase in the amplitude of river level fluctuations during low flows, from the current 10 -20 cm range to 20 -50 cm, would reinstate water regimes suitable to the majority of species surveyed.",

In Australia, the lower River Murray (the 830 km stretch below the Murray-Darling confluence) is a focus for studies of this kind. The Murray-Darling system is regulated by upstream dams, and the lower Murray is further controlled by ten weirs and barrages, each 3 m high (e.g. Walker and Thoms, 1993) . Two surveys (1989, 1994) have shown that the composition and distribution of vegetation along the weir pool margins are associated with gradients of water regime related to weir operations (Walker et al., 1994; Blanch and Walker, 1997; Blanch et al., 1999) .",

This assumes that the water-regime gradients between weirs are independent of pool length (cf. Maheshwari et al., 1995) . Surveys were made in January and February 1994, 1-2 months after flooding. Two floods occurred during this period, both rising about 4 m above pool level. The 1992 flood commenced in August, peaked in November and receded to pool level by February. In 1993, the river rose to 1 -1.5 m above pool level from April-June, peaked in November and returned to pool level by January 1994. All quadrats surveyed, except those at the highest floodplain elevations in the upper pools, were inundated by both floods.",

Daily stage data for each quadrat were derived by linear interpolation of gauged data for the nearest weirs (courtesy South Australia Water), and indices were calculated for all quadrats in all transects using a program written in QBASIC.

The weir pools and seasonally more stable flow regime have allowed numerous wetland species to invade the river channel, where they provide a vital habitat for aquatic and terrestrial animals, compensating for the reduction in floodplain area and inundation frequency. The littoral plant community therefore warrants special consideration in conservation and management. If some elements of the natural flow regime were to be restored, including greater seasonal variability and more frequent floodplain inundation, the distributions of some littoral plants would change correspondingly. In particular, the in-channel distribution of submersed species and mudmats (Groups 7 and 9; Figure 3 ) probably would be constricted, spatially and temporally.",

Restoration of a more nearly natural flow regime, including more frequent shallow flooding and longer periods of inundation, would benefit many species. Figures 1 and 3 suggest that the distribution and abundance of all species, except those in Groups 7 and 9, are likely to increase with greater hydrologic variability. Weir manipulations that restore some of the lost natural variability in water level should be incorporated into routine weir operations. Regular fluctuations of 20-50 cm over several weeks are technically feasible and are unlikely to greatly affect infrastructure and irrigation, at least in Pools 7-9 (Ohlmeyer, 1991) .",
