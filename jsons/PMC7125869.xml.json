The aim of this study was to describe potential regional variations in therapies and outcomes for severe asthma exacerbations in Chilean children, and to estimate the health expenditures associated with them.",

For the geographical comparison, hospitals were grouped into three different zones: north, central and south. These three zones differ in terms of climate, urban development, population density and medical infrastructure. The north zone has a desert or semi-arid climate and contains 11.8% of the population, the central zone has a Mediterranean climate and contains 60.5% of the population, while the south zone has a rainy temperate climate and contains 27.8% of the population. Health infrastructure is concentrated in the central zone, followed by the south and north zones. Asthma hospitalization rates for the selected ages were compared by geographical area and expressed per 10,000 inhabitants. The study was approved by the ethics committee of each participating center.",

Our patients required a median PICU length of stay of four days, significantly higher than the median of one day found in another international series.11, 13 This difference could be interpreted again as a higher severity in our patients, but the total length of stay of these patients was not longer in comparison with the patients that no required PICU treatment. This suggests that many patients treated in PICU were discharged directly from this Unit without later going to the pediatric ward. A great heterogeneity in the treatment of asthma exacerbations in PICU was also found. The use of medications, such as aminophylline, magnesium sulfate and ketamine differed considerably between PICUs, as was observed in an American study.11 Among the 7125 patients hospitalized in different PICUs in the USA, the use of aminophylline varied between 0 and 59%, magnesium sulfate between 9 and 46% and ketamine between 1 and 67%.11 The use of these medications was more common in patients requiring ventilator support, as we observed in our patients. On the other hand, the use of intravenous salbutamol in our study was considerably less common (15.9%) than in the American series (30.1%).11 Interestingly, these 11 patients who received intravenous salbutamol had a shorter length of stay and less use of systemic corticosteroids compared to children prescribed only inhaled salbutamol. Because the scientific evidence on the use on intravenous salbutamol is scarce and controversial,14, 15 the potential benefit of early intravenous salbutamol in these patients should be evaluated through further randomized clinical trials.",

A 2016 Cochrane review concluded that the available evidence at the time was insufficient to evaluate the effect of NIV on asthma exacerbations in children and that better designed studies with larger samples size are required.16 Anecdotal evidence suggests that NIV in asthma exacerbations may help to avoid or delay endotracheal intubation in children with severe exacerbations, with impending respiratory failure. Endotracheal intubation and invasive mechanical ventilation in these patients is associated with important morbidity such as barotrauma, hemodynamic instability, infections and an increased length of stay.17, 18 In our study, invasive ventilation was used in only in 4.3% of cases, which is lower than the 14.4% in the American series.11 This could be related to the increased use of NIV in our patients. Despite the absence of good evidence in the literature regarding the treatment of asthmatics in the intensive care unit, it would be desirable to have greater treatment standardization between units, for example through guidelines specifically designed for the treatment of this kind of patients.",

For that reason, international guidelines recommend refraining from performing any microbiological testing or using antibiotics in children with asthma exacerbations.10, 20, 21\n",

We propose the initiation of a nationwide asthma program for hospitalized patients to reduce post-hospitalization morbidity and re-admissions. Such a program should include not only the medication, but also educational activities for patients and parents, emphasizing the importance of the adherence to daily controller treatment and providing the necessary tools for self-management, along with close follow up to avoid new exacerbations, lung function deterioration and increased risk of dying from asthma.23, 24 Such programs have been successfully applied both in Latin America and elsewhere. In Belo Horizonte, Brazil, for example, implementation of such an asthma education and management program was associated with a 79% reduction in asthma hospitalizations, and in a nationwide program in Finland, asthma emergency visits decreased by 86% and hospitalizations by 88%.25, 26\n",
