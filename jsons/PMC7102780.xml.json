However, at least the age and breed (Krupa et al., 2005) or parity of the dam (Lundborg et al., 2003, Murray et al., 2014) have shown associations with the average daily gain of beef or dairy calves. More direct association was recorded for getting adequate amount of colostrum, lower diseases incidence and daily weight gain (Dewell et al., 2006, Furman-Fratczak et al., 2011). Diseases reduce growth rate (Thompson et al., 2006, Windeyer et al., 2014), mostly by reducing feed intake and increasing muscle catabolism (Gabay and Kushner, 1999). In addition, cytokines released in the inflammatory process directly reduce appetite (Borghetti et al., 2009). Calves are thought to compensate the cessations of growth, but compensatory growth has been mostly observed after experimental feed restriction (Hornick et al., 2000); the ability of the calves to compensate after recovering from a disease is less studied.",

Albumin is a negative acute phase protein, whose concentration decreases during inflammation (Jacobsen et al., 2004, Petersen et al., 2004). Decreased albumin concentrations have been detected at least with uterine infections (Schneider et al., 2013) and experimentally induced acute phase response (Jacobsen et al., 2004). Acute phase proteins have also been used as prognostic markers or assessing severity of diseases (Horadagoda et al., 1999, Humblet et al., 2004, Schneider et al., 2013).",

            "text": "The variation in the APP concentration may stem from variation between individuals, presence of subclinical infections, from calves being different breeds or variation of farm management levels. Differences in APP concentrations between breeds of beef cattle have been reported after lipopolysaccharide administration (Carroll et al., 2011) and after weaning or transportation (Qiu et al., 2007). Although these studies did not involve Hereford or Charolais breeds, probably some difference between these breeds exist, too. Farms have varying level of management and care, resulting in varying morbidity and calf performance. G\u00e5nheim et al. (2007) observed higher values of Hp, SAA and fibrinogen in calves in poorer management conditions. SAA and albumin concentrations showed age related changes for the first month of the calves\u2019 lives, similarly to earlier studies (Doornenbal et al., 1988, Orro et al., 2008). Interestingly lower albumin concentrations were associated also with Hereford breed and bull calves. This can reflect the differences of breed in acute phase response, too, as albumin is considered as a negative acute phase protein (Jacobsen et al., 2004, Petersen et al., 2004).",

Primiparous dams have poorer quality colostrum (Rocha et al., 2013), which may result in lower growth in early life if calves are more susceptible to diseases. The positive association of albumin and globulin with early growth is interesting. Although albumin is a negative APP (Jacobsen et al., 2004, Petersen et al., 2004), with decreasing concentrations during inflammation, increases in albumin concentration do not indicate absence of acute phase response or healthier animals. Physiological increase of albumin is observed after birth (Knowles et al., 2000, Bertoni et al., 2009), but it remains unclear how increased albumin concentrations are associated with increased growth during the first month of life. The globulin concentration depicts the intake of colostrum and colostrum quality (Furman-Fratczak et al., 2011), which has already been associated with better growth.",

The parity of the dam showed no more effect on the growth rate in the long-term model, but the dam's BCS \u22653 after parturition was associated with better growth rate. Naturally, undernourished dams with BCS of 1.5 or 2 will not produce thriving calves, but it is surprising to see this association on a long- term growth.

An acute phase response can be detected in animals with subclinical (Heidarpour et al., 2012) or chronic diseases (Horadagoda et al., 1999), which are difficult to diagnose, but reduce growth rate. Another explanation is that type of immunomodelling occurs in early life, resulting in reduced growth rate later. The acute phase response initiated for any reason in early life releases the cytokines tumour necrosis \u03b1 (TNF \u03b1) and interleukins (IL-1, IL-6) (Petersen et al., 2004). During the acute phase response, these cytokines also inhibit the activity of insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) (Borghetti et al., 2009), the increase of which is associated with higher growth rates (Suda et al., 2003). However, it is unclear how long this inhibition of IGF-1 lasts after the inflammatory process has ceased. Our findings on beef calves and reindeer calves (Orro et al., 2006) suggest that changes affecting the long term growth may happen during the early life of an animal.",
