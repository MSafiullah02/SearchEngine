We employed maximum variation sampling to ensure a representation of different age groups, levels of complexity, family structures, geography and socioeconomic status levels when possible [19]. Eligibility for this study included parents or guardians of children aged 0\u201318 years old with one or more chronic conditions that were expected to require specialized care greater than 1 year. This eligibility criteria was created to align with current literature describing children with complex care needs [1, 4, 23] and based on expert opinion from our multidisciplinary research and clinical team. Terminally ill patients were excluded from this study. Clinical leads from each unit in the tertiary care facility invited potential participants according to the eligibility criteria by providing a letter of information describing the study and contact information for the research assistant. The research assistant reviewed the letter of informed consent with potential participants and they were given the opportunity to ask questions before participation.",

Families were asked to identify one primary caregiver to complete the interviews and all data collection measures. All providers involved in the care of these children were invited to participate in our study. Data collection occurred at four points in time: (1) two weeks prior to discharge (T1); (2) one day prior to scheduled discharge (T2); (3) one week following discharge (T3); and four weeks following discharge (T4). Families were asked to complete the SF-36 tool at T1 and T4 to estimate disease burden [24]. The State Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) was used to assess parental anxiety and measured at T2 and T3 [25] and the Brief Cope was used to assess parents coping strategies at T2 and T4 [26]. Our approach to data collection attempted to balance understanding a range of patient, family and health system factors relevant to the transition from hospital to home while being mindful of not contributing to caregiver burden during the transition home. The measures were chosen to capture the experiences and potential changes in stress and coping at different time points during the transition from hospital to home. The child\u2019s primary caregiver also participated in individual interviews at three time points: T1, T2, and T3. A semi-structured interview tool, developed by the research team, was used to explore caregiver\u2019s knowledge, attitudes, and beliefs about the discharge process at each time point. Tertiary care and community health care providers who were directly involved in providing care to the patient and family were also interviewed on a single occasion after the child\u2019s discharge from hospital. A semi-structured interview guide was also used to explore provider\u2019s knowledge, attitudes, and beliefs about the discharge process. All interviews were audio-recorded and transcribed verbatim. Interview transcripts were sorted by case and managed in NVivo 11 Qualitative Data Analysis Software [27]. Transcripts were coded by two independent reviewers. A content analysis approach was used to identify important barriers and enablers of the discharge process in each case [28]. Reviewers met to compare findings and coding discrepancies were resolved through discussion and consensus.",

An initial list of potential community stakeholder participants was identified through consultation with members of the executive leadership team of the tertiary care centre. Subsequently, we used a snowball strategy inviting study participants to identify additional potential provincial stakeholders. A letter of invitation was sent to potential participants via email. Data was collected through individual telephone interviews and verbal consent was obtained from all participants. A semi-structured interview guide, based on the TDF [29, 30], was used to explore participant\u2019s experiences, attitudes and beliefs about supporting children and families through transitions in care. This interview guide was initially drafted by the principle investigator (JC) and further refined by our team of researchers and clinicians. The interviewer (SB) used prompts when appropriate to encourage participants to elaborate on their experiences and opinions. Interviews were recorded and transcribed verbatim by an experienced transcriptionist. One reviewer (SB) performed deductive content analysis to sort barriers and facilitators arising from each transcript according to the 14 domains of the TDF [29, 30]. Coding began immediately after the first interview and a second reviewer (JC) validated the coding in 40% of the transcripts by independently coding the first and every other transcript. Participant recruitment was deemed complete and data saturation was achieved when no new barriers and facilitators were identified in the transcripts [31]. Subsequently, one reviewer (SB) conducted a thematic analysis to identify important themes related to the barriers and enablers [32]. Frequent checks and collaboration with research team members occurred to discuss themes as they emerged.",

Compared with other cases this family reported the highest PCS across T1 and T4 and reported higher anxiety scores across T2 and T3. (Table 1) This family also reported the highest rate of dysfunctional strategies at T4 when compared with other cases (Table 2). Further, there was a reported decrease in the use of instrumental support once home in the community (Table 2).",

Consensus meeting participants included community and tertiary care health care providers, paramedics, senior administrators and policy analysts from the health and education sectors who were not involved in phase 2 data collection. The consensus meeting lasted 2 hours. Key findings from Phase 1 and 2 were presented along with 6 proposed recommendations for inclusion in a provincial policy statement. Recommendations were developed using a behaviour change lens to act as a starting point in addressing the challenges arising from phase 1 and 2 findings. Key priorities in the development of the recommendations included building on existing programs and infrastructures and working with a range of stakeholder groups to co-develop new resources. We also recognized the need to make these resources accessible to end-users across the province, regardless of geographical location. Each recommendation was discussed and revisions were made through a process of consensus as described previously in the methods section. Two points of discussions resulted in modifications to the recommendations. First, consensus meeting participants agreed there was a need for a shared conceptual definition for children with complex and medically fragile needs to orient the present discussion, as well as future clinical and research initiatives examining this population. A number of published definitional frameworks were discussed and participants chose Cohen et al.\u2019s definitional framework as the most suitable given the recent work using this framework in a Canadian context [1, 2]. Second, one of the recommendations included the need for a care coordinator within each provincial health zone to act as a liaison and resource for families and health care providers. Following a lengthy discussion, consensus meeting participants recommended that the coordinator role should be specified as an advanced practice nurse. See Table 5 for a complete list of final recommendations.\n",
