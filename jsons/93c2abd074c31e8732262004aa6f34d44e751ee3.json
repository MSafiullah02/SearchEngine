We are currently witnessing a pandemic spread of a novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, for which no one, neither old or young, has any form of immunological memory. Everyone thus depends on the strength of the primary immune response, either humoral and/or cellular, we don't know yet, for survival.",

The older ones, starting at 40, are hospitalized, may require intensive care, and can die from the consequences of COVID-19. Apparently, their immune systems are too weak to eradicate this novel virus in time. Would their immune systems be clogged with (for this infection) useless memory cells, hindering a fast and adequate primary immune response? Young, na\u00efve immune systems learn faster to combat this virus, just like young children are better at learning a foreign language because their brains are not yet congested with vague memories of other languages.",

And of course, if you did not survive the first infection, having developed memory would be irrelevant. ",
