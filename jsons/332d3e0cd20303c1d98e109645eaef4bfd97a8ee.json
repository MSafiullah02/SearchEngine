Current recommendations regarding the use of beta-lactams in combination with macrolides published in clinical practice guidelines are variable and based on low-quality evidence that is frequently retrospective, observational, and heterogeneous in nature. While population-based studies have historically suggested improved clinical outcomes with the routine use of macrolide combination therapy in hospitalized patients with CAP, emerging evidence from recent randomized controlled trials has challenged this practice. In this article, we discuss the historical rationale and current evidence for combination macrolide therapy in the management of CAP. Recent Findings Recent randomized controlled trials have assessed the non-inferiority of beta-lactam monotherapy compared to beta-lactam/macrolide combination therapy in adult patients hospitalized with CAP. Beta-lactam monotherapy was associated with equivalent clinical outcomes in patients with mild to moderate CAP. Patients with severe CAP managed with beta-lactam monotherapy have demonstrated worse clinical outcomes when compared to patients treated with combination therapy. In addition, previous beta-lactam exposure prior to hospitalization has not been shown to negatively impact outcomes in patients managed with beta-lactam monotherapy in the hospital. Summary Current evidence supports the use of beta-lactam monotherapy in adult patients hospitalized with mild to moderate CAP. While existing evidence supports the use of combination therapy in patients with severe pneumonia, further large-scale randomized controlled trials are urgently needed to clarify the role of combination therapy in this population.",

Despite advances in sepsis recognition and management and being a core measure by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, the in-hospital mortality of patients admitted with CAP remains high at 6.5% with all-cause mortality at 30 days, 6 months, and 1 year estimated to be 13%, 23%, and 31%, respectively [1\u2022, 3] . The broad spectrum of pathogens causing CAP remains unchanged and includes typical bacteria (Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis), atypical bacteria (Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Chlamydia pneumoniae, Legionella spp.), viruses (such as rhinovirus, influenza, parainfluenza, respiratory syncytial virus, coronaviruses, human metapneumovirus) and less frequently Staphylococcus aureus, gram-negative bacilli, fungi, and mycobacteria [4] . While diagnostic techniques to facilitate the accurate identification of causative agents have improved, including the rapid evolution of commercial multiplex PCR assays, an etiologic agent is identified in fewer than half of CAP cases and frequently leaves clinicians to rely on empiric antimicrobials for management [5, 6\u2022] .",

The CDC EPIC study was a prospective, multicenter, population-based active surveillance study of 2320 patients with radiographically confirmed pneumonia at five US hospitals between 2010 and 2012. In addition to conventional diagnostic tests, extensive molecular and serologic testing was employed to characterize causative pathogens. In this cohort, human rhinovirus, influenza, and S. pneumoniae were the most common etiologic agents. Atypical pathogens were infrequently identifiedwith the incidence of M. pneumoniae, C. pneumoniae, and L. pneumophila each representing less than 0.5 cases per 10,000 adults in the community.

Dudas et al. subsequently performed a prospective, observational cohort study at 72 community hospitals to evaluate compliance with ATS guidelines in patients with non-severe community-acquired pneumonia and compared outcomes between patients administered varying combinations of antimicrobials [26] . Compliance with ATS guidelines was found to be 81% and the addition of a macrolide to a beta-lactam was associated with decreased mortality and reduced length of hospital stay.

M. pneumoniae and C. pneumoniae are also specifically known for producing relatively mild illness with minimal existing literature that targeted antibiotic therapy impacts patient mortality [28] . Additionally, any adjunctive benefit from the postulated anti-inflammatory effect of macrolides in the treatment of CAP remains unproven. Given the increasing resistance of S. pneumoniae and M. pneumoniae isolates to macrolide antibiotics, unnecessary exposure to potential harms associated with macrolide use (potential cardiotoxicity, Clostridium difficile infection, etc.), and the economic costs of unnecessary combination therapy, many have called the routine use of combination beta-lactams plus macrolides into question [29] [30] [31] [32] [33] .",

A systematic review and meta-analysis performed by the Cochrane Acute Respiratory Infections Group explored if the addition of atypical coverage to an antimicrobial regimen would improve patient outcomes [34] . In 28 trials, including 5939 patients hospitalized with CAP, there was no overall difference in mortality (RR 1.14, 95% CI: 0.84-1.55) between the atypical and the typical coverage arms. A trend towards fewer clinical failures was observed in the atypical therapy arm, but this did not achieve statistical significance (RR 0.93; 95% CI: 0.84-1.04). Of note, the Cochrane Review only included one study that specifically focused on the comparison of beta-lactam monotherapy to beta-lactam/macrolide combination therapy. Asadi et al. also compared macrolides to other treatment regimens in adults hospitalized with CAP in a systematic review and metaanalysis including 23 studies and 137,574 patients [35] . While overall macrolide use was associated with a statistically significant reduction in mortality when compared to nonmacrolide use, the survival advantage disappeared (4.6 vs 4.1%; RR 1.13; 95% CI: 0.65-1.98) when analyses were restricted to RCTs.",

The study was conducted in six acute care hospitals in Switzerland from 2009 to 2013. The primary endpoint in this trial was the proportion of patients not achieving clinical stability at day 7. After 7 days of therapy, 41% in the monotherapy arm and 33% in the combination arm had not reached clinical stability (7% difference, p = 0.07), exceeding the predefined non-inferiority boundary. Patients identified to have atypical pathogens or severe pneumonia (PSI \u2265 4) were less likely to reach clinical stability with monotherapy while patients infected with typical pathogens or mild to moderate CAP severity (PSI 1 to 3) had equivalent outcomes.

Adult patients were included if they demonstrated radiographic evidence of pneumonia and compatible clinical findings. Patients were excluded if they had cystic fibrosis, positive Legionella antigen, recent hospitalization, or were from a long-term care facility.

Adjusted comparisons for 90-day all-cause mortality favored beta-lactam monotherapy with a 1.9% lower risk of death when compared to macrolide combination therapy (90% CI: \u22120.6 to 4.4). Time to oral antibiotic de-escalation, length of hospital stay, and occurrence of complications during hospital stay were not significantly different between the groups.

Emerging evidence from several prospective studies has challenged this practice by failing to show a significant improvement in relevant clinical outcomes in patients hospitalized with mild to moderate CAP. While existing evidence still supports the use of combination therapy in critically ill patients with severe CAP, further randomized-controlled trials are urgently needed to clarify the role of combination therapy in this population. In particular, the potential immune modulatory effect of macrolides in sepsis remains an area of uncertainty. Based on the current literature, we suggest a pragmatic approach pending further high quality evidence to guide therapy. For patients with mild-moderate CAP requiring hospitalization, we suggest treatment with beta-lactam monotherapy (e.g., ceftriaxone) or a respiratory fluoroquinolone (e.g., moxifloxacin). For patients with severe pneumonia or those requiring ICU-level care, we suggest beta-lactam/macrolide (e.g., ceftriaxone/azithromycin) combination therapy. Empiric therapies, however, may differ based on local epidemiology and antimicrobial susceptibility patterns in each individual health region or institution.",
