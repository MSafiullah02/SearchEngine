There is sparse literature commenting on the role of any other existing coronavirus strains and their interaction with these agents. However, as treatments such as ICI manipulate the immune system in various ways, it should be considered that their use could predispose to atypical manifestations of the coronavirus. 6 Lessons learned from previous outbreaks, such as the 2012 Middle-East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) and the 2003 severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV), have helped shape current guidance for COVID-19, but there are little data on how these infections affected cancer patients. Although both SARS and MERS largely pre-dated targeted therapies and ICI, there are a few studies specifically investigating the effect of chemotherapy during these times. For example, Chen et al. reported that of a cohort of 79 patients with non-small-cell lung cancer, none of them were documented to have contracted SARS, five were possible cases (proven negative) and during that time only ten of 373 chemotherapy sessions were delayed. 7 The current global COVID-19 pandemic is unprecedented and continues to evolve. As such, how best to treat and support our cancer patients remains uncertain. New, comprehensive national guidance has assisted us to amend our practice accordingly during these challenging times, and there are several changes we can implement to ease the impact of this disease on our unique patient cohort 8 : ",
