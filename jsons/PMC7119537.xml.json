            "text": "The World Health Organisation (WHO) received the first report of an oseltamivir-resistant influenza A H1N1 (2009) virus in July 2009 (WHO, 2009a). Sequence analysis revealed that the resistance was associated with a histidine to tyrosine substitution in the viral neuraminidase (N1) at position 275. Since this discovery a total of 304 oseltamivir-resistant influenza A H1N1 (2009) (H275Y mutant) cases have been reported to the Global Influenza Surveillance Network (GISN) (WHO as of 30.09.10) (WHO, 2010). Of these cases, 28% have been in immunocompromised patients who have received prolonged oseltamivir treatment, 33% have been associated with oseltamivir treatment (WHO, 2010). Several cases have also been associated with chemoprophylaxis (MMWR CDC, 2009a) and there have also been cases found in individuals who had not received treatment (Chen et al., 2009). Despite the increasing number of cases there has been two reports of person to person transmission of resistant virus (Gulland, 2009, WHO, 2009a). There has been one report of a community cluster of oseltamivir resistant cases (Le et al., 2010) however there has been no evidence of ongoing circulation of the virus in the community. Furthermore, the resistance strain has not been shown to cause altered or more severe infection.",

The universal influenza A assay is a widely used assay that targets the matrix region of the virus. Participation in various External Quality Assessment (EQA) schemes has shown this assay to detect influenza A viruses from humans and animals with high sensitivity (Gunson et al., 2010). The N1 assay is specific for influenza A H1N1 (2009). The H275Y resistance assay was developed by a group in Rotterdam and was supplied as personal communication (by M. Schutten). This allelic discrimination assay was designed to distinguish between the cytosine (oseltamivir sensitive) and the thymidine (oseltamivir resistant) mutation at the nucleotide position 823 in the N1 gene of influenza A H1N1 (2009) that gives rise to the antiviral resistance. The probe of the H275Y resistance assay was modified by the developers of the assay by adding two nucleotides (TT) at the 5\u2032 end at a later date and published (van der Vries et al., 2010). It should be noted that we did not use the adapted probe. The N1 probe from this paper was also not used in this study as there was a well validated N1 probe in use in the laboratory (Gunson et al., 2010).",

The results also suggest that the intra-assay variability of the assay is also good for each component as little variation was observed when the positive control was repeatedly tested. It should be noted that for H1N1 the control used was weaker than that of the other components of the assay and so was nearer the endpoint detection limit (see Table 3, Table 4) of this test which is likely to be the cause of the slightly higher SD and CoV values.
