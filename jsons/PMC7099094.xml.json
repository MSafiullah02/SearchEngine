RVF is endemic primarily in sub-Saharan Africa but has crossed several barriers including the Sahara to Egypt, the Red Sea to the Arabian Peninsula and the Indian Ocean to the Comoros, Mayotte and Madagascar2\u20134. Spread through infected animals and mosquitoes to countries where the disease is not endemic is increasingly possible, with more frequent export of livestock from Africa to other countries and the presence of known or potentially competent vectors in those countries4,5. RVFV causes sporadic outbreaks with high morbidity and mortality, characterized by abortion storms and high mortalities in neonatal sheep, cattle and goats6,7. Human infection generally occurs concurrently with disease outbreaks in domestic ruminants2,5,8, where humans work or live in close contact with livestock.",

These climatic conditions favour breeding of floodwater mosquitoes that are the proposed maintenance vectors of this virus via transovarial transmission10. The floodwater mosquitoes considered to be vectors on the interior plateau of South Africa are those in the Aedes subgenera Ochlerotatus and Neomelaniconion11. Outbreaks may then be amplified by epidemic vectors, of which Culex theileri is considered the most important on the interior plateau12. Risk factor studies conducted during and after outbreaks in both humans and animals have identified several other environmental, human, and animal factors that may be associated with RVF outbreaks and RVFV seropositivity13\u201317. The presence of large water bodies was found to be associated with seropositivity in Somalia15 and southwest Saudi Arabia16. Other environmental factors include vegetation density, topography, land use, drainage14, temperature17 and mosquito abundance16. Animal factors that may play a role are animal density16, vaccination status6 and age13,18\u201322.",

The cold, dry climate during the winter is less favourable for survival of mosquito vectors; it is therefore unclear whether, how and for how long the virus survives in the interepidemic periods and whether and to what extent interepidemic circulation of virus occurs2,6. Studies elsewhere in Africa have reported varying RVFV seroprevalences in livestock during interepidemic periods. Most studies including multiple species have reported higher seroprevalences in sheep than cattle15,27,28, except in Burkina Faso19 and south-western Uganda13 where there was a higher prevalence in cattle. In an area of Mozambique, a higher seroprevalence was reported in sheep than in goats in 200720 and in 201318, but vice-versa in 201020. Despite the fact that the herd immunity of domestic ruminant populations is a key determinant of outbreak occurrence and extent17 there are no published studies on the seroprevalence of antibodies to RVFV in the central interior of SA. Although effective vaccines are available, they are generally infrequently used in SA except in the face of an outbreak6.",

The overall individual animal seroprevalence of RVFV four years after the last outbreak was 29.7%, and it was 43.0% in cattle, 28.0% in sheep, and 9.3% in goats. For cattle and sheep, these results are comparable to seroprevalences reported in 2013 from Kenya30,31 and Tanzania32, six years after the 2006/2007 East African RVF outbreak, bearing in mind that some of the animals in this study were vaccinated for RVF whereas vaccinated herds were excluded from the studies in Kenya and Tanzania31,32. After adjustment for confounding, cattle were more likely to be seropositive than both sheep and goats. The differences in seroprevalence between species may be attributed to several factors, including differential vector preference and differences in management system. Several other studies have also reported lower seroprevalences in goats, in Kenya33, Rwanda34, Comoros35, Mozambique18 and Mauritania36. In our study, the higher seroprevalence in cattle, and to a lesser extent sheep, may be partially explained by the fact that cattle and sheep are predominantly commercially reared and farmers in general may place more value on them than on goats; therefore, they were more likely to be vaccinated. Although vaccination history was obtained in the survey and included in the final multivariable model, in most cases the accuracy of this information was dependent on the farmers\u2019 recall and misclassification of exposure may have occurred. There is no method for differentiation of vaccinated from infected animals (DIVA), making it impossible to distinguish between antibodies derived from vaccination or natural RVFV infection.",

This is to be expected since they survived the last outbreak during which they may have been exposed to RVFV and/or vaccinated. However, the 6.3% seropositivity found in unvaccinated cattle, sheep, and goats born since the last outbreak, indicates that subclinical RVFV circulation might have occurred in the study area. This is supported by the fact that, within this sub-group the seroprevalence increased with age, with animals born shortly after the last outbreak more likely to have been exposed. Unreported or subclinical cases are therefore likely to have occurred after the last outbreak. In addition, the association of seropositivity with the recent occurrence of abortions on the farm indicated the possibility of sporadic, unreported cases of RVF having occurred up to four years after the outbreak.",

Two hypotheses have been proposed for RVFV, with varying degrees of investigative evidence, namely survival of the virus in embryonated eggs laid in the dry margins of seasonal wetlands (infected transovarially)10 and survival of virus in overwintering Culex mosquitoes37. The reproductive biology of the members of the Aedes genus, requiring drying of eggs prior to hatching, favours the former hypothesis and that of the multivoltine genus, Culex, favours the latter38. Evidence for overwintering of RVFV in adult mosquitoes is lacking but the flavivirus, West Nile virus, has been proven experimentally and observationally to overwinter in Culex species in the temperate regions of the northern hemisphere39,40. In South Africa, quiescent adult female Culex spp., including Cx. theileri, considered to be the main epidemic vector on the inland plateau12, have been shown to overwinter41,42. Typical hibernacula for adult mosquitoes include caves, tree-holes and building infrastructure43. In the drier interior of South Africa such refuges are restricted to farmsteads or livestock enclosures, although trees do cluster along river banks, which may help explain the association between access to perennial rivers and seropositivity in unvaccinated animals born after the last outbreak.",

The live Smithburn RVF vaccine has been reported to evoke long lasting, and even lifelong, immunity, but with a poorer antibody response in cattle6. Seropositivity after vaccination with Clone 13 RVF vaccine has been reported to persist for at least 1 year, but the vaccine induces different levels of immune responses in domestic ruminants, being highly immunogenic in sheep and goats and moderately so in cattle45,46. Formalin-inactivated RVF vaccine has been reported to induce high antibody titres and evoke protection for 9 months in cattle, and up to 2 years if a booster is given after 3 months47,48. Further investigation of the duration of immunity following administration of different vaccines is required.",

However, the variation in RVFV seroprevalence between farms, with estimates of ICC on the prevalence scale for unvaccinated animals between 0.11 and 0.26, indicate that, even within an area prone to RVF outbreaks, the occurrence of infection varies greatly between locations, as reported elsewhere15,32,50. Care should be taken when comparing published ICCs since some authors report the statistic on the logistic scale, calculated during the estimation of a multilevel logistic regression model. For example, Bett et al.30 in Kenya reported herd- and village-level ICCs on the logistic scale (\u03c1(l)) of 0.3 and 0.22 respectively; our estimates of \u03c1(l), ranging between 0.22 and 0.41, were somewhat higher, reflecting greater between-herd variation in seroprevalence than in Kenya, where outbreaks occur more frequently and conditions are likely more conducive to interepidemic viral circulation and widespread exposure26. Vaccination may also artificially inflate estimates of \u03c1, evident in the reduction in estimated \u03c1 when vaccinated herds/flocks were excluded, as when farmers vaccinate they are likely to vaccinate all of the animals at risk, and even if they vaccinate a portion every year it is likely that the older animals were vaccinated previously. In our study area, the presence of large areas without surface water is likely to have resulted in spatial variation in distribution of mosquito vectors. Further, fine-scale differences in local ecological conditions, agricultural practices and type of surface water would have influenced vector abundance and resulted in marked spatial heterogeneity of RVFV exposure.",

The current seroprevalence may be below the herd immunity threshold required to prevent another large outbreak should suitable conditions recur and is likely to decline further unless effective vaccination of susceptible livestock is undertaken on a large scale.",

Bloemfontein is the capital city of Free State Province, situated on dry savannah at 29.1\u00b0S, 26.2\u00b0E, at an altitude of 1,395 m above sea level. Kimberley is the capital of Northern Cape Province, located at 28.75\u00b0S, 24.75\u00b0E, approximately 110 km east of the confluence of the Vaal and Orange Rivers at an altitude of 1,224 m above sea level. The study area lies at the intersection of the Nama-Karoo biome in the centre and south, the Savanna biome in the north-west and the Grassland biome in the east. The climate is semi-arid, with mean annual rainfall varying between 285 mm in the south-western corner to 500 mm in the north-east. The area is traversed by several perennial rivers, with the two largest rivers in SA, the Orange and Vaal, crossing the south-western and north-western corners of the study area, respectively. The landscape is also characterized by the presence of numerous temporary, shallow wetlands, or \u201cpans\u201d, of various types, most of which contain water only during times of unusually high rainfall55.",

A two-stage random sampling strategy was used. Random geographic points were used to select farms since no sampling frame of all farms in the study area existed. Random points were generated within the study area, with selection probability proportional to the density of livestock-owning households obtained from the results of the 2011 National Census (K. Parry, Statistics South Africa, 2014, pers. comm.). This was done by first excluding census units (known as small areas) less than ~1 km2 in extent which, based on Google Earth imagery (http://earth.google.com), represented urban areas, mainly in Bloemfontein and Kimberley. For each of the remaining 262 small areas, a Poisson-distributed random number with mean proportional to the number of livestock-owning households was generated in order to determine the number of points to be generated in each. 350 random geographic points were thus generated using Arc Toolbox in ArcGIS 10.2 (ESRI, Redlands, CA, U.S.A.). Since the exact number of farms to be sampled in order to achieve the required number of each species was unknown, the list was randomly sorted and the points were then sampled in the sequence they appeared on the list; this ensured that the points actually used constituted a random sample. Each point was plotted on a Google Earth map of the study area and the farm nearest to each selected point was identified with the help of state veterinary officials.",

Where possible, systematic random sampling was done, with three animals of each species selected within each age category. In many cases, however, a combination of haphazard and convenience sampling was used, with farm workers selecting animals from each age category. If the required number of animals in each age group was not available, additional animals were selected from the other age groups. With some exceptions, explained below, a maximum of nine cattle, nine sheep and, nine goats were sampled per farm. In cases where the number of cattle, sheep or goats on the selected farms was less than nine, all the available cattle, sheep or goats were sampled. On farms that reported that they had never vaccinated their animals, up to 50 sheep were sampled, if available, in order to identify seronegative sheep for a parallel cohort study that is still ongoing and will be reported separately. Sampling of farms continued, using the randomly sorted list of co-ordinates, until the minimum required number of each species was achieved. Because goats were the least frequently encountered species, this resulted in greater than the required number of cattle and sheep being sampled.

Briefly, 96-well ELISA plates (Nunc MaxiSorp, Nunc, Denmark) were coated overnight at 4 \u00b0C with 100 \u03bcL per well of polyclonal sheep anti-RVFV capture antibody diluted 1:500 in phosphate buffered saline (PBS without Ca and Mg, pH 7.4). Plates were washed three times with 300 \u03bcL per well of wash buffer (0.1% Tween-20 in PBS) after overnight incubation. Plates were blocked with 10% skimmed milk in PBS (blocking buffer) and incubated for 1 hour at 37 \u00b0C in a humidified chamber, followed by washing as described above. Test and control serum dilutions were prepared by adding 21 \u03bcL of undiluted serum into 189 \u03bcL of virus or mock antigen diluted 1:10 in diluent buffer (2% skimmed milk in PBS). These sample-antigen dilutions were added in duplicate (100 \u03bcL per well) to the washed plate after blocking and incubated for 1 hour at 37 \u00b0C in a humidified chamber, followed by washing as described above. Rabbit polyclonal antiserum to the RVFV nucleoprotein at a dilution of 1:2000 was added to all the wells (100 \u03bcL per well) and incubated for 1 hour at 37 \u00b0C in a humidified chamber, followed by washing as described above. Horseradish peroxidase conjugated anti-rabbit antibody (KPL) diluted 1:6000 was added to all the wells (100 \u03bcL per well) and incubated for 1 hour at 37 \u00b0C in a humidified chamber, followed by washing as described above. Peroxidase substrate (ABTS, KPL) was added to each well (100 \u03bcL) and plates incubated in the dark at room temperature (22\u201324 \u00b0C) for 30 minutes, followed by addition of stop solution (1% sodium dodecyl sulphate). Optical density was measured at 405 nm and the specific activity of each serum calculated by subtracting the OD in the mock antigen well from that in the RVFV antigen well. The mean net OD readings for replicate tests were converted to percentage inhibition value using the equation [(100 \u2212 (mean net OD of test sample/mean net OD of negative control)) \u00d7 100].
