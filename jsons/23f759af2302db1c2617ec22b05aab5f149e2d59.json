Economic growth is slow. Europe's competitive position is feeble. There are not enough jobs, and not enough of them are high-level. Europe is still characterised by significant poverty and regional inequality. An important demographic challenge is emerging. Europeans' health is affected by serious lifestyle and contagious diseases. And the environment is being degraded.",

World trade has been liberalised as both formal and informal trade barriers have been reduced significantly, or disappeared altogether. Capital roams the planet freely in search of the best investment opportunities as barriers to capital mobility have been eliminated. Global communication and transportation networks have become denser and better integrated through a combination of technological and organisational innovation. The speed of technological change has accelerated while technologies are standardised more rapidly and use is made of modular production systems. As the combination of these factors has made it possible to locate the production of goods and services anywhere on the planet and still serve global markets, the global production system is in the process of being reconfigured.",

On the one hand, low-, medium-and to an increasing extent high-technology manufacturing and services industries are under threat from delocalisation or so-called off-shoring and outsourcing, resulting in at least short-term disruption and unemployment. Employment is also under threat from rapid process innovation leading to productivity increases. 2 On the other hand, rapid product innovation provides developed countries with opportunities to improve competitiveness and serve global markets by fleeing forward as it were. The race to upgrade the economy is never-ending, however, and innovation-based advantages are fleeting and unsustainable as rapid standardisation and modular production techniques quickly allow the production process to move partially or completely to developing countries.",

In the last 15 years or so, Europe has done worse than the United States, while Japan has once again started to outperform Europe, and the large BRIC (Brazil, Russia, India, China) economies and smaller East Asian economies continue to grow rapidly. 4 The growth of output amounted to 1.3 per cent in the Euro area in 2005, substantially lower than the 3.5 per cent in the United States and the 2.7 per cent in Japan, and the 4.8 per cent at world level. Output is projected to grow by a higher 2.0 per cent in the Euro area in 2006, still Economic growth in the euro area has been lagging that of the best performing OECD countries since the mid-1990s.

The most common definition of competitiveness refers to the overall capacity to improve standards of living in a sustainable way. 7 States during the 1950s and 1960s. But since the 1970s, European standards of living have not increased relative to the United States ( Fig. 1.3) . 8 Labour productivity is another common measure of competitiveness. Though, except for a few countries, the productivity gap was never closed in the end, for most of the post-war period the EU somehow caught up on average with the United States. 9 This catch-up has now stopped and is even being reversed. Since 1995, for the first time in three decades, growth in US labour productivity has outstripped that of the Union (Fig. 1.4) . 10 This EU productivity downturn is of a structural nature and mainly due to an outdated and inflexible industrial structure slow to adapt to the intensifying pressures of globalisation and rapid technological change. 11 Deindustrialisation is often taken as a further sign of Europe's deteriorating competitiveness. The fear is that slow labour productivity growth, high labour costs, 1970  1972  1974  1976  1978  1980  1982  1984  1986  1988  1990  1992  1994  1996  1998  2000  2002  2004 Year GDP per capita (US=100) EU15 EURO AREA Fig. 1 and short and inflexible working hours drive entire industries to low-cost, hightech countries in Eastern Europe and Asia. The evidence for deindustrialisation is not clear-cut. Some analyses point out that industry still accounts for the same important share of Gross Domestic Product in terms of volume as in the past, while the declining share in terms of value added and employment is due simply to decreasing prices because of productivity gains and exposure to competition higher than that for services. Should it occur, the impact of deindustrialisation would indeed be worrying: the existence of many services depends on the presence of industry; industry pays better wages than services, even for low-skilled jobs; industry accounts for most innovations and technological revolutions; and industry has an important strategic role. 12 Europe's feeble competitive position is also clear from its weak trade performance, especially that at the high-tech end. Europe's most dynamic export products are generally not those one would closely associate with the knowledge-based economy. The top three products with the fastest growing market share are floor coverings, pork and poultry fat, and hemp. On the other hand, if one looks at products for which market share is in major decline (> 10 per cent loss in market share), the EU has many more (345 product groups) than the United States (65) or Japan (90). What is more, in Europe many technological products are among them (e.g. air launchers, turbines, insulating glazing, drugs containing alkaloids or hormones, telephones, photographic film). 13 High-tech manufacturing exports represent a much smaller proportion of total manufacturing exports in Europe than in the United States or Japan (in 2002, 19.7 per cent vs. 28.5 per cent and 26.5 per cent respectively). 14 Europe's share of global high-tech manufacturing exports, though increasing, is lower than that of the United States (in 2002, 16.7 per cent vs. 19.5 per cent respectively). 15 And Europe runs a structural deficit in high-tech manufacturing trade, whereas the United States and Japan run surpluses. 16",

In 2004, the EU-25 employment rate was 63.3 per cent and the EU-15 one 64.7 per cent, so 6 to 7 percentage points below the target under the Lisbon agenda, compared to 71.2 per cent in the United States. 17 This is mainly due to the limited participation of women, the young, and the elderly in the labour force. At 55.7 per cent and .0 per cent, the female and older people's employment rates were about 4 and 9 percentage points below the Lisbon targets for 2010. 18 Second, Europe also scores lower than the United States in terms of the number of hours worked annually per employee ( Fig. 1.6 ). 19 For a long time, the low employment rate and number of hours worked annually per employee were explained with reference to the European emphasis on work-life balance. A growing number of authors draw attention to the existence of disincentives to work, however, the main one being the lack of employment opportunities. 20 This lack of employment opportunities is clear from the high unemployment rates. In 2004, about 19.4 million Europeans were out of work. This equalled 9.0 per cent of the labour force, some 4 percentage points higher than the rates in the United States and Japan ( Fig. 1.7) . 21 The proportion of high-level jobs is also considerably lower in Europe than in the United States. 22",

It is a continuation of the historical process that started over 50 years ago with the Communities' inception, developed through several steps (in 1973, 1981, 1986, 1991, 1995) , and reached a high point -albeit not an end-point -with the enlargement of the European Union to 10 countries of Eastern and Southern Europe on 1 May 2004. Preparation for that enlargement took several years and by the time they joined, the EU-10 had successfully transformed their economies from centrally planned to functioning free market ones. Compliance with the Copenhagen criteria for accession served as a powerful catalyst for change. This assessment is detailed in a recent stock-taking exercise in which the Commission services have provided strong evidence and analyses indicating that the 2004 enlargement constitutes an economic success for the \"old\" and the \"new\" Member States alike. 30 It has to be noted that enlargement has been a dynamic process rather than a discrete event and that its effects will become visible over time. Figure 1 .9 shows that convergence and catching up in real income have been at work throughout the period since the late 1990s. Per-capita incomes are now much closer to EU-15 levels than they were in 1997, the year in which enlargement prospects crystallized in the Commission's Agenda 2000. After the output collapse in the early years of transition, growth rates in the EU-10 have been higher than in the EU-15, but also more volatile. The key contributors to actual and potential economic growth in the EU-10 have been capital accumulation and technical progress (the so-called Total Factor Productivity, TFP), while the contribution of labour has been mostly negative (that being a reflection of weak employment growth and, to a lesser extent, of an ongoing decline in hours worked per employee). In general, and consistent with the convergence hypothesis, Member States with lower initial (1997) per capita income tended to grow faster in the intervening years.",

The environmental objectives of the EU Sustainable Development Strategy include: (1) addressing climate change; (2) better management of natural resources; and (3) making transport more sustainable.

Forests and oceans act as climate regulators but also harbour a wide diversity of species. Decisively tackling the issue of biodiversity will require i.a. making forestry sustainable, addressing pollution, and dealing with climate change. Pollution negatively affects health, from allergies and infertility to cancer and premature death. In the mid-1990s damage costs to the EU caused by air pollution originated in the EU (see Table 1 .2) were calculated to be around 2 per cent of EU GDP (ranging from 0.3 to 3.2 per cent) and damages to EU and non EU countries caused by air pollution originated within the EU were estimated to be 2.6 per cent of EU GDP (with ranges between 0.4 and 6.9 per cent), with health damages accounting for the largest share. 45 An animal and human health problem like aviary flu also constitutes a threat to biodiversity.",

            "text": "Throughout history, the relation between science and society has been marked by both continuity and change. 46 The continuity is situated in the tension between the C H A P T E R 1 philosophical and intellectual pursuit of and search for knowledge on the one hand, and the desire of researchers and their supporters to make scientific knowledge useful and apply it on the other hand. This tension was first recognised by the ancient Greek philosophers, and has been reflected in recurring calls from philosophers and scientists throughout history, including today, for more \"research for its own sake\". Within the context of this tension, the change has been located in what has constituted or better what has been considered useful knowledge in each age, in other words in \"the changing social expectation of science\": \"What counts as useful knowledge differed from patron to patron and society to society, so that Cosimo de Medici and the United States Department of Energy looked for quite different 'products' to be created by their clients, but both traded support for the potential of utility\". From century to century, societal expectations of S&T have not just changed. They have also increased. In the era of the ancient Greek philosophers, societal expectations of S&T were rather low. S&T was a highly controlled activity carried out by a small elite group of people for philosophical or religious objectives. At present, however, it is considered a powerful tool for political, economic, and social change. In between, S&T helped exploit worldwide resources as trade empires and colonies expanded (18th century); helped expanding and consolidating trade empires and colonies, and turn their natural resources into wealth, or make up for the lack of trade empires and colonies (19th century); helped fight wars (First World War and Second World War); and helped producing consumer goods, consumer medicines, exploring space, addressing environmental challenges, exploring the human genome, and so on (post-war period). It is no exaggeration to say that as a result today societal expectations of S&T have never been higher in industrial countries. In the United States, the Carnegie Commission on Science, Technology, and Government listed in 1992 no less than 25 major societal goals to which S&T can contribute (Table 1. 3). And a National Academies report noted in 2005 that \"the nation increasingly looks to the scientific and engineering communities for solutions to some of its most intractable problems, from chronic disease to missile defence, to transportation woes, to energy security, to ensuring clean air and clean water. Expectations for S&T are perhaps higher than at any other time in our history and are placing unprecedented demands on leadership\". 47 needs of society as they change over time, or in other words, to become a 'science and technology for society' \". 48 Things are no different in Europe. In 2000, the European Commission remarked that \"expectations of science and technology are getting higher and higher, and there are few problems facing European society where science and technology are not called upon, one way or another, to provide solutions\". 49 out of the challenges Europe is facing, and recommendations have been made on how to address them. Time and again the same wide range of urgently to be addressed challenges is identified. The reports are also near-unanimous in the key role assigned to S&T in this respect, as will be seen in Chapter 3. In other words, great expectations are held of S&T as regards the tackling of the multitude of challenges Europe is facing. This will be developed in Chapter 3 as part of the new policy context that enabled the genesis of the Lisbon Strategy as well as of the 7th Framework Programme.",

According to Baumol, innovation explains much of the extraordinary economic growth record under capitalism. The reason is that in important parts of the economy, competition is based on innovation rather than price. Firms are therefore forced by market pressure to support innovative activity systematically and substantially. 50 According to Romer, productivity growth is driven by innovation resulting in the creation of new though not necessarily improved product varieties. 51 And under the Schumpeterian paradigm, growth results from \"quality improving innovations that render old products obsolete, and hence involves the force that Schumpeter called 'creative destruction' \". 52 Even basic research generates several direct economic benefits. It is a source of useful new information; it creates new instrumentation and methodologies. Those engaged in basic research develop skills which yield economic benefits when individuals move from basic research carrying codified and tacit knowledge. Through participation in basic research, access is granted to networks of experts and information. Those There is also empirical support for the contribution of S&T to economic performance (see tables and sources in annex). Estimates of private returns to firms' own investment in R&D still produce varying figures, but there is an emerging consensus that gross returns between 20 and 30 per cent are common and plausible (Table 1.4) . Microeconomic studies confirm the existence of significant spillovers of knowledge from the firms that perform the R&D to other firms and industries. Taking account of measured spillovers typically raises the estimated gross rate of return on business investment into the range of 30 to 40 per cent (Tables 1.5-1.7) . Macroeconomic studies, which by definition cover all sectors of the economy, also find significantly higher returns to R&D in OECD countries, with estimates ranging from 50 per cent to over 100 per cent. A recent Austrian report found that the rise of corporate spending on R&D from 0.8 per cent to 1.1 per cent of Gross Domestic Product in the second half of the 1990s produced a boost of three tenths of a per cent in growth. 54 Both microeconomic and macroeconomic studies find that an important source of productivity growth in all OECD countries comes from the international diffusion of technology. A country's ability to absorb those foreign technologies is enhanced by investment in education and by investment in own R&D.",

Such evidence includes a recent study of the Directorate-General Employment which found that the rate of growth of total factor productivity (due to improvements in the efficiency of production or to pure technological progress) has a positive impact on the employment rate, with a one-year lag, and that both in the short-and long-term, countries with higher than average total factor productivity growth tend also to have higher than average growth in employment. 56 Clear evidence exists that more computerised or R&D-intensive industries increased their demand for college-educated workers at a faster rate in the 1980s. Such high-skilled workers also command higher wages, as the consensus is that the increase in the schooling wage premium and the rise in wage inequality are driven by technological change. 57 Support also comes from the observation that all Member States saw employment levels in the high technology sector rise between 1997 and 2002, leading to an increase of almost 2 million for the Union as a whole, with employment in high-tech services accounting for 1.4 million of this total (Fig. 1.12) . 58 ",

That well-established premise is taken to its most fruitful operational conclusions in the Environmental Technologies Action Plan. 67 More recently, the benefits of S&T for the economy and environment alike were further examined in the \"Towards a more sustainable EU\" report for the Dutch Presidency and indeed in the Kok report of November 2004. 68 In fact Europe occupies a strong position in the field of environmental technologies.

Fig. 1 .14 provides an illustration of the rising challenge represented by disasters. Here \"disasters\" include both technological and natural events. 77 The dramatic increase shown on the graph may be due not only to the consequences of concentrated urbanisation, climate change, and so on, but also to a heightened sense of vulnerability and risk, together with a better ability to measure disasters.",

The knowledge society requires a revolution in our understanding of knowledge: not only with regard to S&T researchers, but also concerning a democratisation or broadening of knowledge production. 78 This has profound implications for decision-making, for the lay-expert divide, for the handling of risks and uncertainties, and indeed for the relations between citizens and institutions of governance, as every individual should be recognized as -and given the means to be -a person of knowledge.
