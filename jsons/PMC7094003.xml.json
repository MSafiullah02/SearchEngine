However, available data that address this point are limited. It has been previously shown that clinicians who make diagnostic and treatment decisions based solely on their clinical judgment lack predictive accuracy regarding death risk in human H7N9 infection cases and are, therefore, unable to increase the survival probability in these cases.5\u20137 An accurate assessment of survival probability would help tailor treatment in human H7N9 infection cases. Unfortunately, the vast majority of published studies8,9 on the topic focus on risk factors of H7N9 infection and case fatalities.",

It is now well established from a variety of studies that the nomogram model is an algorithm with integrating predictors and has been identified as a practical tool of preventive interventions.10 In addition, a nomogram can accurately predict and estimate the individualized risk of a disease and quantitatively demonstrate a personalized probability for predicting the incidence of disease outcome.11",

As known, the oxygen transport is diffusion-limited from the alveolus to the pulmonary capillary in patients with pulmonary diseases (i.e., pulmonary fibrosis).29 Several reports26\u201329 have shown that the PFR responds to an increase of diversion at a constant oxygen saturation by indicating poorer pulmonary function. Thus, it is reasonable to assume that the PFR may be used in clinical settings as an indicator of predicting pulmonary function status of patients with H7N9 VI. In the model presented here, the survival of H7N9 VI is associated with IPFR less than or equal to 300 mmHg (see Table 4). This finding, while preliminary, suggests that IPFR would seem an adequate measure of pulmonary dysfunction in patients with H7N9 VI.",

Our study confirms that decreased IPFR is defined as a strong predictor of survival of patients with H7N9 VI. An implication of this is the possibility that the uppermost treatment strategy is to improve pulmonary function for H7N9 cases. We also find that the peak CRP level may be considered a particularly important factor when evaluating the probability associated with survival in H7N9 cases. According to a study conducted by Gao and colleagues,31 CRP is involved in the deterioration observed in severe influenza infection and may be a candidate molecule for immunotherapy treatment. A previous study31 indicated that CRP treatment can improve the prognosis of patients with H7N9 VI. It is well known that therapeutic measures are elective, so we should select a treatment measure that can improve CRP. This clinic tool may be able to help physicians to solve such problems. Moreover, this nomogram can provide information in guiding clinicians\u2019 decision-making regarding the most effective intervention strategies for H7N9 patients. For example, according to this algorithm, an H7N9 patient is found to be a high risk for death. This finding has an important implication for developing the strategy of early intervention in the high-risk death population of H7N9 patients. In addition, we find that the cost of applying this nomogram is mainly involved in developing a practice tool of nomogram (i.e., an evaluation scale) and incorporating the nomogram into the treatment information system of hospital. To the government department, it should be able to afford the cost and expense of applying this tool. Overall, this nomogram may display the advanced public health concept of predictive, preventive, and personalized medicine.32 This tool deserves to be further explored in future researches of clinic and public health. Considering these advantages of nomogram, we suggest that the government should guide, support and foster the development of this tool. Additionally, a treatment scheme of H7N9 cases including this nomogram should be formulated by the government.",
