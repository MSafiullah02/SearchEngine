Two recent studies have also shown that SARS-CoV-2 virus has not been detected in amniotic fluid, cord blood, or breast milk of pregnant women infected with SARS-CoV-2. 9 This may explain why all the neonates in this study were free from infection. Our result is also consistent with the observation that the incidence of disease and disease severity were lower in neonates than in adults during the SARS epidemic, which may be related to the difficulty of vertical transmission of coronavirus, 10 proper handling at birth, and timely isolation of the neonate after birth. A recent study showed that in addition to the lung, SARS-CoV-2 targets other organs such as kidney and testicles. 11 It cannot be ruled out that SARS-CoV-2 may have an impact on the placenta. Thus, to ensure the safety of the parturients and newborns, we chose to perform elective Cesarean delivery. Although we recommend elective Cesarean delivery, there is a paucity of data to drive these recommendations. The final choice for the delivery method needs to consider the parturient's condition, the wishes of the parturient, and the advice of the obstetrician. The potential for transfer of the virus to the fetus during vaginal delivery is not known. If there is intrauterine fetal distress caused by hypoxia and other reasons, emergency Cesarean delivery should be performed immediately.

Although both neuraxial and general anesthesia have been safely reported in pregnancy, 12 because the lung is the main target organ of the virus, the choice of anesthetic regimens for Cesarean delivery is critical for pregnant women with COVID-19. Therefore, we recommend that neuraxial anesthesia wherever possible, based on it reducing the possibility of exacerbating pulmonary complications due to intubation. In our study, 14 of 17 pregnant women underwent epidural anesthesia, the onset time of sensory and motor block, the degree of motor block, the height of sensation, and the quality of anesthesia appeared to be the same as those of non-infected pregnant women. Nevertheless, it was noted that 86% of parturients undergoing epidural anesthesia experienced intraoperative hypotension. Importantly, because of the short duration and the hemodynamic changes, no adverse end-organ damage was apparent. As for why there appeared to be significant hypotension, a recent study suggested that SARS-CoV-2 can bind with the angiotensin-converting enzyme II (ACE2) receptor. 13 The key of SARS-CoV-2 infection is its S protein binding with ACE2 receptor. 14 These studies imply that the circulatory system is highly susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection.

There is a possibility of aerosol transmission in a relatively closed environment when exposed to high concentrations of aerosol for a long time. To solve the safety issues such as environmental pollution and infection of medical staff with COVID-19, all medical staff involved in the operation need to be identified. They should be trained in proper infection control management procedures and have a thorough understanding of nosocomial infection control and risk factors for COVID-19. In this series of patients, no medical staff involved in the operation were infected with COVID-19. Several factors may have influenced this positive result. First, a specific patient negative pressure transfer vehicle and a dedicated negative pressure operating room were used to prevent the spread of the virus, and sterilization was performed after surgery. Second, patients and medical staff followed the established biosafety procedures when entering and leaving the operating room. Dedicated personnel wore protective equipment and infection control in the negative pressure anterior chamber and buffer room to improve efficiency. Third, parturients wore a surgical mask in case they coughed during tracheal intubation, and suctioning reduced the spread of respiratory droplets and aerosols. In summary, our experience is that both epidural and general anesthesia are safe and effective for pregnant women and newborns. Nevertheless, the incidence of hypotension appeared to be significantly higher than normal during epidural anesthesia. A negative pressure operating room, proper patient transfer, medical staff access procedures, and effective biosafety precautions were also important to protect the medical staff from SARS-CoV-2 infection.
