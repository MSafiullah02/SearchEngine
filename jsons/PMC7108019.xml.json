            "text": "The value of antibiotics seems obvious. The first patient to receive penicillin was a young woman with \u03b2-hemolytic streptococcal bacteremia with fever of 39.4\u00b0C\u201341.2\u00b0C daily for 4 weeks. She received penicillin intravenously starting 14 March 1942, promptly recovered, and survived to age 90 years [39]. This would appear to be \u201cevidence-based medicine\u201d with an n = 1. The following statement from Dr Walsh McDermott in 1982 summarizes this breakthrough especially well: \u201cPenicillin gave more curative power to a barefoot, itinerant care provider in the deepest reaches of Africa than the collective powers of all physicians in New York City\u201d [40]. The more recent experience with bacterial resistance and sparse pipeline threatens this miracle, but antiviral development is quite different, primarily for HIV and hepatitis C virus (HCV). It now appears that patients with HIV can achieve near-normal longevity [41]. HCV infection is even more impressive in terms of speed of progress and ability to cure. The HCV treatment story reflects the efficiency of basic science to define targets, pharmaceutical skills of industry, well-organized trial networks, and a regulatory agency (US Food and Drug Administration [FDA]) that facilitated product development [42].",

This illustrates the challenge and the priorities [44]. Another challenge is epidemics involving nosocomial pathogens, as shown with the Klebsiella pneumoniae carbapenemase-producing bacteria (KPC) in the National Institutes of Health (NIH) Clinical Center. This began with a patient transferred from a New York City hospital with a KPC infection and became the source of an institutional outbreak that required extraordinary efforts to control, including a wall constructed to isolate cases, removal of plumbing (as a possible source), use of matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF) molecular diagnostics to detect cases and carriers, hydrogen peroxide room aerosols, and \u201cwhole house\u201d surveillance cultures. The epidemic was finally halted, but the toll was 18 cases and 6 fatalities over 6 months [45, 46]. Another KPC epidemiologic investigation showed widespread distribution of this microbe from a long-term acute-care facility in the Chicago area [47], and others have demonstrated distribution of KPC by air travel from India to Europe [48]. These epidemics require extensive resources and specialized skills; they will be expected to increase substantially in the era of \u201cbad bugs.\u201d",

            "text": "It is now known that genes for resistance to antimicrobial agents were well established in bacteria at least 3 million years before evidence of human life [49]. The use of antibiotics has selected for these genes by Mendelian laws, making it increasingly difficult to control previously treatable infections. This problem was predicted by the father of antibiotics, Alexander Fleming, who, in 1945, wrote that \u201c\u2026 the public will demand the drug and \u2026 then will begin an era \u2026 of abuses. The microbes are educated to resist penicillin and a host of penicillin-fast organisms is bred out which can be passed to another individual and perhaps from there to others until they reach someone who gets a septicemia or a pneumonia which penicillin cannot save. In such a case, the thoughtless person playing with penicillin treatment is morally responsible for the death of the man who finally succumbs to an infection with penicillin-resistant organisms. I hope this evil can be averted\u201d [50]. Also of note is the prediction by Nobel Laureate Joshua Lederberg: \u201cThe future of humanity and microbes will likely evolve as \u2026 episodes of our wits vs their genes\u201d [51]. It now appears that Fleming's prediction is a harsh reality and evolutionary microbial resistance genes are gaining the upper hand, reflecting the combination of massive antibiotic use and lack of new pharmacologic agents. The result is the alarming escalation of antibiotic resistance that is global and applies to nearly all categories of treatable pathogens, leading some to predict \u201cthe postantibiotic era.\u201d This resistance has been declared a \u201ccrisis\u201d by the Infectious Diseases Society of America, the CDC, WHO, the US Congress, and the US President.",

This is in sharp contrast to the European Union, which includes 28 countries with 24 official languages and diverse cultures, but has systematically collected data on antibiotic consumption and microbial resistance patterns for 15 years [52, 53]. This has resulted in multiple publications with data reviews, studies of interventions, messages to consumers such as an eBug Internet program for students, a European Antibiotic Awareness Day, standardized methods to collect data [54] and a recent 12-point plan with budget to address the issue [55]. Their data are striking in showing the dramatic association between per capita antibiotic use and national resistance patterns. For example, antibiotic consumption in Greece is nearly 4 times that of the Netherlands, so we expect more resistance problems in Greece, but the magnitude of this difference is alarming: Bacteremic carbapenemase strains among all bacteremic K. pneumoniae isolates appear to be about 150 times more common in Greece, and MRSA as a percentage of all S aureus isolates is about 40 times higher [51]. The European Union appears to have a mature and substantive model to learn from, with the important caveat that it functions well because there is no claimed ownership, as there are 28 equal partners.",

An example is the 5-step central line bacteremia prevention bundle that proved effective in trials [64]. Generalized adoption of this bundle was predicted to save 18 000 lives and $1.8 billion per year in US hospitals [65], and subsequent actions by clinicians, regulatory agencies, and stakeholders have resulted in an estimated 63% decline in central line bacteremia rates [66].",

It would be difficult to find another discipline in medicine that has such extraordinary diversity, surprises, value in patient care, and clinical relevance for both domestic and international applications. For many trained in medicine, joining the field of infectious diseases is simply the right thing to do.",
