            "text": "The COVID-19 pandemic raging around the world is shining a bright light on the capacity of nations and the international community to respond to a global threat. Despite knowing for many years that \"a serious international epidemic could be caused by a pathogen currently unknown to cause human disease\", 1 this virus is showing that most countries failed to prepare for such an emergency. The previous outbreaks of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), and Ebola virus disease demonstrated that strong public institutions that can collaborate, communicate, and cooperate are essential to countering such a threat. 2 We know that they are the backbone of a nation's security and a guardian of people's health. Yet, after these outbreaks we became complacent and failed to invest in them. Now we are paying a terrible price for this indolence. The importance of strong public institutions reaches far beyond public health. Effective, transparent, and accountable finance, justice, public works, environment, election oversight, education, health, and other government departments form the integrated foundation of a stable nation. It is the only sector that can protect human rights and individual safety and create a stable environment for commerce. 3 It ensures that the elected are accountable to the public.",

The abstracts selected for oral presentation at CUGH 2020 are included in this special issue of The Lancet Global Health.
