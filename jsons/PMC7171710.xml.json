            "text": "Lack of surveillance in many countries and discrepancies in the surveillance methods make the accurate estimation of the burden of CAP in the region very difficult (Table 1).6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\n24\n25\n26 Overall incidences of pneumonia and pneumonia-attributed mortality rates were recently estimated from a multicenter prospective surveillance in Japan from 2011 to 2013.9 The estimated annual incidence rates of adult community-onset pneumonia, hospitalization, and inhospital deaths were 1,690, 530, and 70 per 100,000 person-years, respectively. The overall estimated annual number of adult CAP cases in the entire Japanese population was 1,880,000; importantly, 69.4% were \u226565 years old. A prospective study in one Japanese city (Kochi) from May 2008 to April 2010 cited an incidence of 960 per 100,000 person years; 73.3% of cases were \u226565 years old.10 More attention was given to the geriatric population in the latter study, in which annual incidence of CAP in older adults (\u226575 years) was estimated to be 4,290 per 100,000. An Asian country that showed similar socioeconomic and ethnic characteristics to Japan would be South Korea. Although the exact nationwide overall incidence of CAP in Korea has not been reported, hospitalization rate was reported to be similar (520 per 100,000).16 This study confirmed the significantly larger burden of CAP in the elderly population by estimating that hospitalization rate in people \u2265 75 years of age was 2,030 per 100,000 population. Several reports have been published on the disease burden of CAP in Thailand, including both urban and rural areas. The hospitalization rate due to CAP was reported to be 177 to 580 per 100,000 people in Thailand, which was lower than those of Japan and South Korea.22\n24 Because these studies were limited by low utilization of chest X-rays and variable access to health care, the estimates might not reflect the whole picture of CAP in Thailand.24 Reports on the Pacific Island countries are scarce, but two studies from New Zealand reported the overall incidence in adults and hospitalization rate. Estimated incidences of CAP in all adults and those \u226565 years of age in New Zealand were 859 and 1,882 per 100,000, respectively.11 Another study estimated that pneumonia hospitalization rate was 92 per 100,000.12 Several studies on the burden of CAP among children in Southeast Asia have also been published. A surveillance in rural villages on Lombok Island, Indonesia, in 1998 to 1999 reported the incidence, hospitalization rate, and mortality among young children (\u22642 year) as 21,000, 5,300, and 3,300 per 100,000 child-years, respectively.8 Another interview survey in the Philippines revealed similar incidence rates: 10,500 cases of pneumonia, 6,100 admissions, and 90 deaths per 100,000 children each year.15 The burden of CAP was much smaller in Taiwan (1,240 pneumonia cases per 100,000)20 and New Zealand (500 hospitalizations per 100,000).13 Rudan et al conducted an estimation of the global incidence of childhood pneumonia, in which the annual incidences in Southeast Asia and Western Pacific regions were estimated to be 36,000 and 22,000 per 100,000 children, respectively.18 When specific demographic groups were studied for CAP, a larger burden was almost always observed in older adults,6\n7\n10\n16\n22 those residing in rural areas,6\n7\n8\n15 and minority ethnicity.6\n13 Most studies on the epidemiology of CAP in the Asia-Pacific region are from either nationwide mortality statistics or surveillance in geographically limited areas. Differences in case definitions and potential underreporting due to limited accessibility to health care undermine the effort to measure the burden of CAP. Further studies on the epidemiology of CAP are warranted in the Asia-Pacific region based on more coordinated plans and resources.",

It has been known that major identifiable pathogens of CAP include Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Chlamydophila pneumoniae, and Legionella spp.27\n28\n29 The last three have been referred to as \u201catypical pathogens,\u201d the importance of which has been the subject of considerable debate.29 Despite the importance of this subject, the majority of the data on the etiology of CAP have been reported from the U.S. and European countries. But, the number of studies from the Asia-Pacific region is recently increasing; they are summarized in Table 2. The most comprehensive data were reported by the Asian Network for Surveillance of Resistant Pathogens (ANSORP) in 2007.27 In this study, a total of 955 cases with CAP were collected from seven countries (South Korea, China and Hong Kong SAR, India, Singapore, Vietnam, Taiwan, and the Philippines). Streptococcus pneumoniae was the most common isolate, which comprised 29.2% of identified pathogens. Pneumococcus was followed by Klebsiella pneumoniae (15.4%), H. influenzae (15.1%), C. pneumoniae (13.4%), and M. pneumoniae (11.0%). The overall distribution of etiologic pathogens from this study was comparable to those from western countries.30\n31\n32\n33\nStreptococcus pneumoniae was the most frequent pathogen identified in other studies from Japan,34\n35\n36\n37\n38 South Korea,39\n40 Taiwan,41\n42 Australia,43 and New Zealand.44 However, the proportion of pneumococcus showed considerable variability, from 10%37\n40\n43\n44\n45 to 25%.46 The broad range seen in these studies could be attributed to variable detection rate in addition to the actual difference in the pathogen distribution. With regard to atypical pathogens, some reports from China,47\n48\n49 Taiwan,42\n45 and Thailand50 reported a relatively more important role of these pathogens in CAP.",

Methods used for the detection seems to result in variable results, as different studies from same countries often showed vastly different detection rates. Proportion of viral pathogens among CAP was only 1.8% in an earlier report from Japan that used serologic test,34 but virus was identified in 20% among 1,772 patients in a recent study from Japan using PCR.9 In adult population, influenza A and B viruses seem to predominate, comprising 5 to 15% of pathogens detected including bacteria.9\n41\n43\n44\n46\n58\n59 Rhinovirus, which is increasingly identified as etiologic agents of CAP in adults, was the second most commonly detected virus (4\u20139%).60\n",

Furthermore, the high prevalence rate of antimicrobial resistance in pneumococci in this region is a very serious threat to public health. Important data on the antimicrobial resistance of S. pneumoniae in the Asia-Pacific are summarized in Table 3. The most prominent resistance issue is macrolide resistance.61 Two surveillance studies on pneumococcus conducted by ANSORP in the early 2000s revealed that about half of the isolates were resistant to erythromycin.27\n62 Considerable variability does exist between different countries, and resistance rates in China, Korea, Taiwan, and Vietnam exceed 70% with MIC90 (minimal inhibitory concentration, MIC, for 90% of the isolates) of >128 mg/L.62 High resistance rates in East Asian countries were confirmed by Prospective Resistant Organism Tracking and Epidemiology for the Ketolide Telithromycin (PROTEKT) study.63 In this international surveillance study in 40 countries, macrolide-resistant S. pneumoniae was most prevalent in Far East countries (China, Japan, South Korea, and Taiwan) with resistance rates \u2265 80%. While Southeast Asian countries were not included in this study, the resistance rate in Australia was comparable to countries in Northern Europe and America at <30%. Some Asian countries are showing the increasing resistance trend over time. A report from Sri Lanka, in which the resistance rate had been reported to be 16.7% in ANSORP studies in the early 2000s, showed that the resistance rate increased to 60.9% in the late 2000s.64 Notable exceptions are India and the Philippines, where only <20% of the organisms were reported to be resistant to macrolides in ANSORP studies, although current status should be investigated. Since the macrolide MIC level in pneumococci from some Asian countries is too high to be achieved by increased dose of macrolides, single empiric therapy with macrolides for the treatment of CAP is generally not recommended.65\n66\n",

Aforementioned ANSORP studies reported that 30 to 35% of the pneumococcus isolates in this region were resistant to penicillin.27\n62 Like macrolide resistance, higher penicillin-resistance rates were observed in East Asian countries, while those in Southeast and South Asian countries were considerably lower. The most comprehensive multinational surveillance study based on revised criteria had been conducted by ANSORP in 2008 to 2009, which revealed that the resistance rate according to the revised MIC breakpoint (8 mg/L) was only 0.7%.72 It indicates that the resistance of pneumococci to penicillin is not a serious threat, at least in nonmeningeal infections treated with intravenous antibiotics.

Introduction of the 7- and 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV-7 and PCV-13) led to dramatic reduction of pneumococcal infections in the United States. As serotypes included in PCV-7 are often associated with penicillin and multidrug resistance, the incidence of antibiotic-resistant invasive pneumococcal infections has also declined.80 However, there have been reports of the emergence of pneumococcal infections by nonvaccine types, especially 19A, which is often multidrug-resistant.81\n82\n83 Two recent studies on adults from Japan during 2010 to 2013 reported that PCV-7 serotypes, especially 6B, decreased from 43.3 to 23.8%.84\n85 Some nonvaccine serotypes emerged, but genotypic penicillin resistance rate declined.84 Nonetheless, the notable emergence of invasive pneumococcal infections caused by 19A was reported in Taiwan, which was associated with reduced susceptibility to \u03b2-lactams.77 Serotype 19A was also the most prominent non-PCV-7 serotype in the latest ANSORP study, comprising 8.2% of isolates, while 52.5% showed PCV-7 serotypes. The majority of serotype 19A isolates were erythromycin-resistant (86.0%) and multidrug-resistant (79.8%).72 Most prevalent clone among serotype 19A was ST320 (51.1%), which was found in Hong Kong, India, South Korea, Malaysia, Saudi Arabia, and Taiwan.86 High prevalence of serotype 19A with multidrug resistance, even in countries with low vaccination rate, needs to be carefully evaluated.",

            "text": "The most comprehensive study on the role of atypical pathogens in the Asia-Pacific region was reported by Ngeow et al in a multicenter surveillance study on the prevalence of atypical pneumonia in the early 2000s.5 They used serology and PCR to detect M. pneumoniae, C. pneumoniae, and L. pneumophila from 1,374 patients in 8 countries (Malaysia, Thailand, China, the Philippines, Taiwan, South Korea, Singapore, and Indonesia). These three atypical pathogens were associated with 23.5% of CAP cases in this study, with M. pneumoniae, C. pneumoniae, and L. pneumophila detected in 12.2, 4.7, and 6.6% of patients, respectively. The ANSORP study also showed that atypical pathogens account for 25.5% of the cases in which serologic tests were performed.27 But C. pneumoniae (13.4%) and M. pneumoniae (11.0%) were detected in the comparable proportion of CAP patients in this study. Studies from individual countries reveal considerable differences in the burden of atypical pathogens within the region. In general, studies from Japan34\n36\n37\n46\n87 and South Korea39 have reported lower proportion of atypical pathogens in CAP, accounting for less than 10% in CAP cases (Table 2). However, studies from China,47\n48\n49 Taiwan,42\n45 and Thailand50 showed the larger role of atypical pathogens. In a multicenter prospective study conducted at 12 centers in seven Chinese cities, atypical pathogens accounted for 31.3% of the cases with CAP when fourfold increase in titers of antibodies were defined as serologic evidence of the infection: M. pneumoniae (13.4%) was the single most prevalent pathogen, followed by S. pneumoniae (6.1%), H. influenzae (5.4%), and C. pneumoniae (4.8%).48\nLegionella pneumophila was detected in only 2.8% of the patients, which is in accordance with other studies in Asia.5\n27 Other studies from China, including one which used PCR, have reported the similar proportion of atypical pathogens (M. pneumoniae: 10%; C. pneumoniae: 4\u20135%).27\n49 Another report from Hong Kong on 1,193 adult patients with CAP requiring hospitalization showed 6.5% for M. pneumoniae, but still two atypical pathogens accounted for 28% of the patients in whom the etiologic agents were identified.88 Two studies from Taiwan, which included adult CAP patients who were hospitalized, reported that the serologic evidence of M. pneumoniae and C. pneumoniae infection was found in 13.1 to 14.3% and in 7.1 to 11.9%, respectively.41\n45 Similar distribution and higher prevalence in mild CAP was also shown in a multicenter, prospective study from Thailand in 1998 to 2001.50 A more recent study at seven centers in Bangkok (2001\u20132002) using both PCR and serology reported comparable results.89 Despite the existence of many studies on atypical pneumonia in this region, our understanding of the exact role of these pathogens is still inadequate. The diagnosis of CAP caused by atypical pathogens still mostly relies on the serologic tests, which requires serial testing and often yields equivocal results.49 Further studies using molecular techniques can improve the correct understanding about the epidemiology of atypical pathogens.90\n",

After the first report of macrolide-resistant M. pneumoniae in Japan from patients in 2000,93 Matsuoka et al reported the isolation of 13 erythromycin-resistant strains (17%) among 76 M. pneumoniae strains isolated in Japan during 2000 to 2003.94 All but one isolate harbored a point mutation (A2063G/C) in domain V of 23S rRNA gene, a binding site for macrolides. Another surveillance in Japan during 1976 to 2006 revealed that there were no resistant strains prior to 2000, yet the resistance rates were 14.6 and 21.6% in years 2000 to 2004 and 2005 to 2006, respectively.95 The resistance rate in Japan increased further to approximately 45% in 2007 to 2008.96 Macrolide-resistance strains were subsequently reported in China,97\n98\n99 South Korea,100 and Taiwan.101 Reports from Beijing98 and Shanghai97 revealed remarkable resistance rates of 92% (46/50) and 83% (44/53), respectively. In the latter study, all strains isolated in 2007 and 2008 were resistant to macrolides. A Korean study with 378 isolates during 2000 to 2011 showed a similar picture; there were no resistant strains in 2000, but the resistance rate surged from 2.9% in 2003 to 62.9% in 2011.100 A recent survey from Hong Kong reported the resistance rate of 47.1% (24/51) in 2014 and showed that the macrolide resistance was associated with increasing resistance in multilocus variable-number tandem-repeat analysis type 4-5-7-2.102 A report from northern Taiwan showed that 12.3% of M. pneumoniae isolates were resistant to macrolides.101 In contrast, only one strain was resistant among 30 specimens from Sydney, Australia.103 Previous reports on the macrolide-resistant M. pneumoniae have been concentrated in three East Asian countries: Japan, China, and South Korea. The vast majority of macrolide-resistant M. pneumoniae strains found in Asia harbor point mutations on A2063 or A2064 in 23S rRNA gene. Mutations on A2063 or A2064 result in a high level of resistance to various macrolides, but do not affect the susceptibility to doxycycline or fluoroquinolones.96 Information on the current status in other countries within the Asia-Pacific region is not available. Furthermore, the presence of a considerable regional difference in resistance rates within a single country has been reported.104 Additional studies and enhanced surveillance are urgently warranted to clarify this issue. The clinical course of macrolide-resistant M. pneumoniae was reported to be prolonged; the duration of fever was 2 to 2.5 days longer and cough persisted for more than 4 days longer compared to patients with macrolide-susceptible M. pneumoniae infection.101\n105\n106\n107 Efficacy of macrolide was reduced to 22.7% in cases with resistant strains compared with 91.5% in cases caused by susceptible strains.106 Treatment with broad-spectrum tetracyclines (minocycline and doxycycline) or fluoroquinolones has been suggested, and two small-scale studies reported that minocycline or doxycycline was superior to fluoroquinolone in terms of the duration of fever after the initiation of treatment.108\n109 Both classes of antibiotics have safety concerns in children (tooth discoloration and joint/cartilage toxicity, respectively), however, in whom M. pneumoniae infections are most prevalent. Use of fluoroquinolones is further complicated by its tendency to accelerate the emergence of antimicrobial resistance and the relatively high prevalence of tuberculosis in the region. As M. pneumoniae infections are often mild and self-limited, the conservative use of alternative agents other than macrolides only in severe or persistent cases was suggested.110\n",

Malaysian study that used multiplex PCR for pathogen detection from 46 adult patients reported that B. pseudomallei accounted for 13% of CAP.52 In this study, 83% were positive by PCR alone and only 17% were culture positive. Among 145 patients with CAP from Northern Thailand, B. pseudomallei was identified in 11%, which is slightly less frequent than S. pneumoniae (11.4%) but more frequent than K. pneumoniae (10.3%).54 The annual incidence of bacteremic melioidosis was reported to be 4.6 and 14.4 cases per 100,000 persons in two Thailand provinces.122 A study on the etiology of severe CAP in Singapore between 1989 and 1993 revealed that B. pseudomallei was identified in 10 cases among 48 patients.57 The presence of endemic melioidosis has been also reported from Northern Australia,123\n124\n125\n126 Cambodia,127\n128 Hong Kong,129 India,130 Taiwan,131 and Southern China.132 Melioidosis has been associated with poor outcomes in multiple studies. A retrospective review from Royal Darwin Hospital in Australia reported that its mortality rate in 1989 to 1997 was 92%, although it was reduced to 26% in 1998 to 2013.133 Mortality rate of 20% was reported from the aforementioned Northern Thailand hospital between 1996 and 2002.134 Also, in a case series of 11 patients with imported melioidosis from South Korea, overall mortality rate was 36.4%.135 Ceftazidime, sometimes in combination with cotrimoxazole, has been the treatment of choice during the initial intensive phase.119\nBurkholderia pseudomallei is highly susceptible to carbapenems in vitro, and imipenem or meropenem showed comparative outcomes to ceftazidime.136\n137 After 2 to 4 weeks of initial intensive therapy, subsequent antimicrobial therapy for eradication of the bacteria should be followed using the combination of cotrimoxazole, doxycycline, and chloramphenicol for longer than 3 months.138\n",

A retrospective study from South Korea reported that S. aureus was isolated from 11.1% of cases with pathogens identified, and among them, two-thirds (6/9) were MRSA.40 MRSA accounted for 4.3% of the cases with CAP in a Taiwanese multicenter study.51 However, both studies did not examine the genotypic and phenotypic characteristics of MRSA isolates. In a report from South Korea that studied the community-onset sequence type 72 MRSA-SCCmec type IV infection, the predominant CA-MRSA clone in the country, showed that pneumonia was the focus of infection in 19% of the cases.149 A multinational study conducted by ANSORP in 2004 to 2006 provided the most comprehensive information on the epidemiology of CA-MRSA in the Asia-Pacific region.150 This multinational study collected 1,463 S. aureus isolates from various community-acquired infections, of which 373 (25.5%) were MRSA. Respiratory infection was the second most common type of infection (8.3%), following skin and soft-tissue infection (66.7%). Albeit more susceptible than hospital-acquired MRSA (HA-MRSA), CA-MRSA isolates from Asian countries also showed considerable resistance to gentamicin (61.2%), ciprofloxacin (52.5%), clindamycin (91.6%), tetracycline (69.3%), and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (31.3%). There have been insufficient data on the exact incidence of CAP caused by CA-MRSA in this region. CA-MRSA pneumonia is often associated with poor clinical outcome, which emphasizes the importance of early appropriate treatment.151 Therefore, further study on the epidemiology of CA-MRSA pneumonia in the Asia-Pacific region is of critical importance.",

Chen et al conducted a study to evaluate the cost benefits of pneumococcal vaccination and, in the process, estimated the national cost of CAP in the elderly to be US$30 million each year.155 Another study on the cost of CAP in China reported the median cost for hospitalization to be US$556.50.156 Because direct and indirect costs caused by the medical condition are determined by multiple socioeconomic factors, direct comparison of the cost between countries is not appropriate.
