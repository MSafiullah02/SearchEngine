As of 19 April 2020, 2,241,778 cases have been reported worldwide, of which 152,551 (6.8%) succumbed to the infection 2 . SARS-CoV-2 belongs to the Sarbecovirus subgenus (genus Betacoronavirus, family Coronaviridae) 3 together with SARS-CoV that emerged in 2002 causing 8000 infections with a lethality of 10%. Both viruses crossed species barriers from an animal reservoir and can cause a lifethreatening respiratory illness in humans. Presently, no approved targeted therapeutics are available for COVID-19. Monoclonal antibodies targeting vulnerable sites on viral surface proteins are increasingly recognized as a promising class of drugs against infectious diseases and have shown therapeutic efficacy for a number of viruses 4, 5 .",

The spike proteins of SARS-CoV-2 (SARS2-S; 1273 residues, strain Wuhan-Hu-1) and SARS-CoV (SARS-S, 1255 residues, strain Urbani) are 77.5% identical by primary amino acid sequence, are structurally very similar [12] [13] [14] [15] and commonly bind the human angiotensin coverting enzyme 2 (ACE2) protein as a host receptor 1, 16 through their S1 B domain.

Four of 51 SARS-S hybridoma supernatants displayed ELISA-cross-reactivity with the SARS2-S1 subunit (S residues 1-681; Supplementary Table 1) , of which one (47D11) exhibited cross-neutralizing activity of SARS-S and SARS2-S pseudotyped VSV infection. The chimeric 47D11 H2L2 antibody was reformatted to a fully human immunoglobulin, by cloning of the human variable heavy and light chain regions into a human IgG1 isotype backbone.

The human 47D11 antibody binds to cells expressing the full-length spike proteins of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 (Fig. 1a) . The 47D11 antibody was found to potently inhibit infection of VeroE6 cells with SARS-S and SARS2-S pseudotyped VSV with IC 50 values of 0.061 and 0.061 \u03bcg/ml (Fig. 1b) , respectively. Authentic infection of VeroE6 cells with SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 was neutralized with IC 50 values of 0.19 and 0.57 \u03bcg/ml (Fig. 1c ). Using ELISA 47D11 was shown to target the S1 B receptor-binding domain (RBD) of SARS-S and SARS2-S. 47D11 bound the S1 B of both viruses with similar affinities as shown by the ELISA-based half maximal effective concentration (EC 50 ) values (0.02 and 0.03 \u03bcg/ml, respectively; Fig. 2a ). ELISAbased binding affinity of 47D11 for the spike ectodomain (S ecto ) of SARS-CoV was higher relative to that of SARS-CoV-2 (EC 50 values: 0.018 and 0.15 \u03bcg/ml, respectively), despite equimolar antigen coating ( Supplementary Fig. 1 ). Congruent with the ELISA-reactivities, measurement of binding kinetics of 47D11 by biolayer interferometry showed that 47D11 binds SARS-S ecto with higher affinity (equilibrium dissociation constant [K D ]: 0.745 nM) relative to SARS2-S ecto (K D 10.8 nM), whereas affinity for SARS-S1 B and SARS2-S1 B was in a similar range (16.1 and 9.6 nM, respectively, Supplementary Fig. 2) . This difference may originate from differences in epitope accessibility in SARS-S versus SARS2-S, as domain B can adopt a closed and open conformation in the prefusion spike homotrimer 12, 13 . Remarkably, binding of 47D11 to SARS-S1 B and SARS2-S1 B did not compete with S1 B binding to the ACE2 receptor expressed at the cell surface as shown by flow cytometry (Fig. 2b; Supplementary Fig. 3 ) nor with S ecto and S1 B binding to soluble ACE2 in solid-phase based assay (Supplementary Fig. 4 ), whereas two SARS-S1 specific antibodies 35F4 and 43C6 that neutralize SARS-S (but not SARS2-S) pseudotyped VSV infection ( Supplementary Fig. 5 ) do block binding of SARS-S ecto and SARS-S1 B to ACE2. Using a trypsin-triggered cell-cell fusion assay, 47D11 was shown to impair SARS-S and SARS2-S mediated syncytia formation ( Supplementary Fig. 6 ). Our data show that 47D11 neutralizes SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 through a yet unknown mechanism that is different from receptor-binding interference. Alternative mechanisms of coronavirus neutralization by RBD-targeting antibodies have been reported including spike inactivation through antibody-induced destabilization of its prefusion structure 17 , which may also apply for 47D11.",

            "text": "47D11 targets a conserved epitope in the SARS2-S-S1 B domain. The SARS2-S1 B RBD (residues 338-506) consists of a core domain and a receptor-binding subdomain (residues 438-498) looping out from the antiparallel betasheet core domain structure that directly engages the receptor. Compared to the S1 B core domain, the protein sequence identity of the S1 B receptor interacting subdomain of SARS-S and SARS2-S is substantially lower (46.7% versus 86.3%; Supplementary Fig. 7 and Fig. 2c ). Potent neutralizing antibodies often target this receptor-binding subdomain. However, due to common variations in this subdomain, these antibodies are often virus-specific and bind and neutralize related viruses poorly 18, 19 . The cross-reactive nature of 47D11 indicates that the antibody is more likely to target the conserved core structure of the S1 B RBD. Interestingly, the SARS-CoVneutralizing antibody CR3022 also targeting the S1 B core domain was recently found to cross-bind SARS-CoV-2, though its ability to cross-neutralize SARS-CoV-2 infection was not reported 18, 20 . S1 B binding by 47D11 further away from the receptor-binding interface explains its inability to compromise spike-receptor interaction and opens possibilities for combination treatments with non-competing, potent neutralizing antibodies that target the receptor-binding subdomain. Antibody combinations targeting non-overlapping epitopes may act synergistically resulting in lower dosage and may mitigate risk of immune escape 20 .",

This antibody will be useful for development of antigen detection tests and serological assays targeting SARS-CoV-2. Neutralizing antibodies can alter the course of infection in the infected host supporting virus clearance or protect an uninfected host that is exposed to the virus 4 .

The human mAb 7.7G6 targeting the MERS-CoV S1 B spike domain was taken along as a negative control, cell nuclei in the overlay images are visualized with DAPI. b Antibody-mediated neutralization of infection of luciferase-encoding VSV particles pseudotyped with spike proteins of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2. Pseudotyped VSV particles pre-incubated with antibodies at indicated concentrations (see Methods) were used to infect VeroE6 cells and luciferase activities in cell lysates were determined at 24 h post transduction to calculate infection (%) relative to non-antibody-treated controls. The average \u00b1 SD from at least three independent experiments with technical triplicates is shown. Iso-CTRL: an anti-Strep-tag human monoclonal antibody 11 was used as an antibody isotype control. c Antibody-mediated neutralization of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 infection on VeroE6 cells. The experiment was performed with triplicate samples, the average \u00b1 SD is shown.
