The phylogenetic comparisons of 4 isolates\u2019 HA genes were made with 49 reference strains (Supplementary Table 1) of 3 distinct Eurasian avian H9N2 lineages, such as A/Chicken/Beijing/1/94-like (BJ/94-like), A/Duck/Hong Kong/Y439/97-like (Y-439 like), and A/Quail/Hong Kong/G1/97-like (G1-like). The HA genes from the 4 H9N2 isolates shared high nucleotide homology with each other (93.3%\u201398.6%) and were clustered with the A/Chicken/Zhejiang/HJ/2007 virus (G57 genotype), which was derived from the BJ/94-like lineage (Figure 1A). The results also demonstrated that the 4 isolates had a close relationship with chicken H9N2 isolates that were circulating in Jiangsu province between 2017 and 2018 (eg, A/Chicken/Jiangsu/J2463/2017 [H9N2], which shared 93.6%\u201399.3% identity scores and A/Chicken/Jiangsu/J2423/2018 [H9N2], which shared 93.2%\u201399.4% identity scores). The phylogenetic analysis of the NA nucleotide sequences showed that the 4 isolates shared high sequence identity (96.7%\u2013 98.5%) and fell into the G57 NA genotype cluster (Figure 1B). These isolates were also found to have a close relationship with a chicken H9N2 isolate that was circulating in Shanghai in 2018 (A/Chicken/Shanghai/07/2018 [H9N2]), which shared 96.6%\u201398.1% sequence identity. In addition, the results of phylogenetic trees (Figure 1A and B) indicated that both HA and NA genes of 4 isolates belonged to a Eurasian avian linage and were from the genotype classified G57.",

We conducted bioaerosol surveillance for influenza viruses at a small LBM in Kunshan City and found a high prevalence (55%) of influenza A\u2013positive samples by qRT-PCR. This finding is consistent with previous similar aerosol studies [12, 13] in China. Remarkably, we also were able to isolate live virus in 4 specimens using a dry sampler without viral transport media, suggesting that a high quantity of viable virus particles were airborne. These findings strengthen arguments that aerosol transmission to birds and humans may be occurring in LBMs. Our data also support the position that bioaerosol sampling has great potential as a noninvasive surveillance tool for detecting aerosolized influenza A virus wherever humans and animals mix.",

            "text": "Our data also indicate that viral RNA and viable viruses were primarily detected in the first stage of the NIOSH sampler (particles size >4 \u03bcm). This finding is consistent with 2 previous studies: Zhou et al. (2016) [13] conducted a similar surveillance study using both the NIOSH sampler (BC251) and the Coriolis \u03bc air sampler in 3 poultry markets in Guangzhou, China. In that study, influenza A\u2013positive samples were detected at a rate of 87.5%\u2013100% in the first stage of the sampler. Later, Zhou et al. (2018) [12] demonstrated that influenza virus\u2013laden particles from donor ferrets were predominantly detected in particles >4 \u00b5m in diameter by using the NIOSH sampler. However, 30% of our positive samples were of smaller molecular size, suggesting that such smaller particles may circulate longer in the air and disperse over longer distances. Particles of such smaller size may be more likely to deposit in the lower respiratory tract, potentially causing lower respiratory track illness [11, 14]. As such, our detection of influenza A viruses in an LBM is significant, as many people (including the elderly and children) visit this LBM every day. Although they may not directly touch or process the poultry, these data suggest that proximity to bird cages could be a risk factor for avian influenza virus infection. Through observing LBM activities, we observe a number of ways AIVs could be aerosolized at the market: frequent live bird wing flapping movements within and outside of cages, frequent human handling of birds, movement of birds from cages to a slaughter room, use of defeathering machines, afternoon cage and slaughter room water wash downs, etc. More comprehensive environmental sampling might be employed to determine which specific activities in the live bird markets are aerosolizing viral particles and to try to identify interventions to mitigate these risks.",

Four H9N2 viruses were isolated among the 40 samples positive for the H9 subtype. We did not isolate any H7 influenza viruses. Phylogenetic analyses demonstrated that the HA gene sequences of all 4 isolates were homologous (93.3%\u201398.6%) and clustered with A/Chicken/Zhejiang/HJ/2007 virus (G57 genotype), suggesting that these isolates and the G57 ZJ/HJ/07 strain share a common ancestor. It is not surprising that these G57-like viruses were found in the LBM, as G57 strains have been reported as the most prevalent genotype circulating in chickens in China since 2013 [15]. Previous studies in Jiangsu province (where Kunshan is located) in 2013\u20132016 [16] and in Guangzhou between 2014 and 2015 [13] have provided molecular evidence that H9N2 subtypes are enzootic in poultry markets. Perez et al. [17] have also posited that H9N2 replicates more efficiently in the respiratory tract of land fowls (eg, chicken, quail, pheasant, chukar, and other minor domestic poultry), explaining this high prevalence.",

This market often had multiple species of live birds at a time, including aquatic birds (ducks and geese), land fowl (chickens, quails, and pigeons), and other poultry (especially pheasants). Although aquatic birds and land fowl were generally kept in separate cages, the distance between cages was often <0.2 m. Previous studies have shown that aquatic birds may act a reservoir for various influenza virus subtypes, which can be transmitted to other avian species including humans. Although H9N2 infections in humans have caused only mild symptoms (eg, fever and coughing), it seems prudent, nevertheless, to warn poultry workers of their occupational exposures [18]. Additionally, although H9N2 viruses are considered to be \u201clow pathogenic\u201d to poultry [19], they have contributed through reassortment to the emergence of other avian influenza virus (AIV) subtypes. Specifically, H9N2 viruses are thought to have provided 6 internal genes to recently circulating H7N9 virus in China and to have donated partial internal genes to other AIV subtypes, such as H5N1, H5N6, and H10N8 viruses [15, 20]. Thus, this LBM\u2019s high prevalence of AIV and specifically of H7 and H9 strains could pose a threat both to domestic poultry flocks and to the public\u2019s health.",

Although they are dry samplers, which are not optimal for live virus collection compared with traditional surveillance tools (eg, poultry throat or cloacal swabs), the aerosol samplers are noninvasive, and their use does not require animal ethical approvals. Aerosol samplers also cover relatively large areas, and market vendors are more likely to permit this type of sampling, even when the devices are placed very close to their poultry cages.",

Bioaerosol sampling may be first used as a screening tool, and then if evidence of a novel virus is found, it may be followed up with more traditional animal swabbing methods. Aerosol sampling can cover large market areas in an efficient manner. Considering the current SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, one wonders if aerosol sampling might be periodically employed in such live animal markets, along with systematic metagenomic analyses of the sampling products, to give early warning of emergence of a novel virus.",
