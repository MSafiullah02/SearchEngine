            "text": "Viral sovereignty is the concept that virus samples isolated from within the territorial boundaries of a nation state are the sovereign property of that state. The history of viral sovereignty as a concept in international law is always told in the classic three-act narrative structure: the setup, the confrontation, and the resolution. The first act plays out across the latter half of the twentieth century, with the development of the World Health Organisation\u2019s (WHO) global network of more than 100 influenza laboratories. The system that became known as the Global Influenza Surveillance Network (GISN)1 and now known as the Global Influenza Surveillance and Response System (GISRS), depended on the open sharing of influenza viruses from around the world to monitor the spread of seasonal influenza and detect the emergence of novel pandemic strains. The second act is the confrontation, set in 2007 when the Indonesian Health Minister refused to share H5N1 influenza viruses with the GISN, troubled by the fact that the WHO was giving their virus strains to pharmaceutical companies who used them to develop vaccines that were unaffordable to Indonesia and other lower and middle-income countries (LMICs).2 The Indonesians cited an environmental conservation treaty as the legal basis for claiming sovereignty over the viruses isolated within their territorial borders. This is the time at which the notion of viral sovereignty first entered the public discourse.3 The standoff between Indonesia and the WHO split global opinion along the old North-South political divide: developed countries were indignant at such a \u201cmorally reprehensible\u201d move on Indonesia\u2019s part,4 and developing countries were largely sympathetic to Indonesia\u2019s claim.5 The third and final act is neatly wrapped up by 2011 with the adoption of the WHO\u2019s Pandemic Influenza Preparedness Framework (PIP Framework). Indonesia was apparently placated and access to influenza viruses with pandemic potential was secured by this \u201cinnovative\u201d and \u201cenforceable\u201d international agreement.6 Viral sovereignty as a concept in law was seen as nothing but a blip on the international radar; a problem both created and resolved in less than five years.7\n",

It will demonstrate that while Indonesia was the first to invoke the United Nations\u2019 Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) to claim sovereignty over its viruses, it was not the first country to deny the WHO access to influenza viruses. Nor was Indonesia the first to raise the types of distributive justice issues that they framed as access and benefit-sharing (ABS), using the language of the CBD.8 Furthermore, this chapter will outline some of the viral sovereignty disputes that have played out since the introduction of the PIP Framework in 2011. Far from being the legal resolution to a problem posed by Indonesia in 2007, the PIP Framework is responsible for legitimising the concept of viral sovereignty as a legal norm. The only thing that has really changed since 2011 is the language that the WHO and the rest of the international community uses to discuss viral sovereignty. \u201cAccess\u201d to viruses (or other pathogens) is now usually referred to as \u201csample sharing\u201d or \u201cmaterial transfer\u201d. \u201cBenefit-sharing\u201d contracts are now referred to almost exclusively as \u201cmaterial transfer agreements\u201d. The term \u201csovereignty\u201d has fallen out of use altogether, despite becoming an entrenched conceptual norm.",

This is not news for anyone working in the realm of pandemic preparedness or involved in responding to international public health emergencies. But the typical three-act portrayal of this saga means that the viral sovereignty issue is depicted as having been settled by the PIP Framework. This is not the case. It should be clearly stated that there is absolutely nothing about or contained within the PIP Framework that could stop a repeat performance of the 2007 viral sovereignty episode today.9 Meanwhile, the PIP Framework explicitly \u201crecognise[d] the sovereign right of states over their biological resources\u201d, making it very difficult for the WHO to fight for a future exemption to this notion for any pathogens that pose a threat to global health. Their reinforcement of sovereign rights over pathogens actually strengthens the incentives for countries to restrict access to dangerous pathogens with the hopes of trading access for related benefits, potentially delaying the global health response to infectious disease outbreaks. Furthermore, the WHO has now extended this notion to data and information related to pathogens, stating that \u201cepidemiologic data belong to the countries where they are generated\u201d.10 Without constant access to up-to-date pathogen samples and epidemiological data, the international public health community is working blindfolded. This chapter aims to demonstrate that viral sovereignty did not start with Indonesia in 2007, and it certainly did not end with the PIP Framework in 2011. The intention is to reinvigorate the conversation about viral sovereignty and the effects that this international legal concept continues to have on infectious disease preparedness and response.",

What has been lost is that the incident occurred in a contemporary context where nation states had already been exercising a level of authority over virus samples for years.11 This first appears in the media coverage about the outbreak of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) in 2003. One news story published in Nature in April 2003 stated that after 23 probable cases of SARS arose in Taiwan, Taiwanese epidemiologists requested Chinese SARS virus samples and related information from the WHO and were reportedly told to instead approach the People\u2019s Republic of China.12 Given the political sensitivities surrounding the relationship between China and Taiwan, it is understandable that the WHO may not have wanted to act as an intermediary to this transfer. This is despite the WHO having the samples in its possession and the supposed custom of free and open sharing of viruses that was said to have existed prior to Indonesia\u2019s sovereignty claim in 2007. Thus, there was an implicit acknowledgement that the viruses belonged to China, not the WHO.13\n",

While the media coverage of virus transfers during the SARS outbreak did not yet embody any notion of sovereign rights over those viruses, there was still an implicit recognition that the originating nations had a level of functional control over their movement and use. In the example between China and Taiwan, this control also extended to the information that was associated with the SARS viruses, not just the physical virus samples themselves.",

Viruses are unequivocally \u201cgenetic resources\u201d within the remit of the CBD.51 But this does not necessarily mean that they should be.52 The CBD, and its supplementary Nagoya Protocol on Access to Genetic Resources and the Fair and Equitable Sharing of Benefits Arising from their Utilisation (Nagoya Protocol)53 prescribes a default bilateral ABS system. That is, the party that wants to utilise genetic resources (whether for commercial or non-commercial purposes, including research and development) must obtain \u201cprior informed consent\u201d54 from the originating nation state55 and negotiate \u201cmutually agreed terms\u201d56 for the sharing of associated benefits. This bilateral mode of ABS is cumbersome as it requires parties to negotiate terms anew every time a user party requires access to genetic resources; the process is slow and the transaction costs are high. It is evidently ill-suited to the rapid sharing of ever-evolving pathogens, particularly highly variable RNA viruses like influenza. While the Nagoya Protocol does ask parties to \u201c[p]ay due regard to cases of present or imminent emergencies that threaten or damage human, animal or plant health\u201d this provision on special considerations merely calls for ABS to be \u201cexpedited\u201d in such situations; it cannot be ignored.57 The Nagoya Protocol also recognises that alternative modes of ABS might be more appropriate for certain subsets of genetic resources,58 and allows for the adoption of specialised international ABS instruments \u201cthat [are] consistent with, and [do] not run counter to the objectives of the [CBD] and [Nagoya] Protocol\u201d.59 This is likely where the PIP Framework is situated within the international regime of ABS created by the CBD and Nagoya Protocol, and as such, the PIP Framework might be a specialised instrument.",

Coming hot on the heels of the PIP Framework, the discussion about sovereign rights over pathogens was still raw for many in the global health community. The situation surrounding the discovery of the MERS coronavirus was controversial. Working from a hospital in Jeddah, Egyptian microbiologist Dr. Mohammed Ali Zaki was unable to determine the causative agent of his patient\u2019s pneumonia. He sent a specimen to Dutch virologists at Erasmus Medical Center (EMC), apparently without the consent of the Saudi Ministry of Health. The researchers at Erasmus were able to isolate the virus and sequence its genome. Just days after Dr. Zaki posted the discovery on ProMED-mail, the research team at EMC, together with Dr. Zaki, applied for a patent on the genetic sequence of the virus.75 This incensed the Saudi government who came out strongly against the patent, arguing that it violated their sovereign authority and inhibited scientific and public health research. In his analysis of the situation, Fidler noted:Saudi Arabia has not yet appealed to \u2018viral sovereignty,\u2019 the argument that Indonesia advanced during the 2007 controversy over sharing avian influenza A (H5N1) samples, namely that the state in which a virus is isolated has sovereign rights over that virus under international law, specifically the Convention on Biological Diversity. But Riyadh\u2019s complaints echo this reasoning: Zaki violated Saudi law, [the Saudi government] says, so Erasmus is benefiting from an illegal act. If Saudi Arabia has sovereign rights over the sample, moreover, Erasmus is ignoring these rights and engaging in a form of \u2018biopiracy\u2019 by exploiting a Saudi genetic resource without Saudi consent. This argument implicates the Dutch government because the Netherlands and Saudi Arabia are CBD parties, and the Dutch government has not intervened to protect Saudi Arabia\u2019s rights recognised by this treaty.76\n\n",

Perhaps the writing was on the wall. But, as Kamradt-Scott and Lee have pointed out, the PIP Framework simply \u201cpapers over fundamental disagreements regarding authority in global health governance, the relationship between the WHO and governments, and the role of private industry\u201d.123 And by papering over the issues rather than resolving them, the WHO legitimised \u201cviral sovereignty\u201d as a bargaining chip that could get LMICs a seat at the table to negotiate better health outcomes for their populations. This is a bargaining chip that has its greatest value precisely when the most lives are at stake, and it could just be the only option available to LMICs to redress some of the \u201cembedded structural inequalities\u201d of global health preparedness and response.124 The CBD gave us the language of resource sovereignty; the Indonesians applied it to a human pathogen; and the PIP Framework locked it in as a legal norm. The transfer of pathogen samples, and now the epidemiological data related to the pathogen, must now be negotiated with reference to the principles of ABS: prior informed consent, mutually agreed terms, and benefit-sharing. The message from the WHO\u2019s handling of the Indonesia situation was clear: if your country happens to be the emergence site of a pathogen that is sufficiently interesting to scientists that it is deemed valuable, then your best bet is to control access to that pathogen to leverage some sort of benefit for your country.125\n",

Scientists are sometimes reluctant to share, sitting on samples and data until they can be guaranteed publication in peer review journals,127 and, as seen with the MERS-CoV case, there are times when scientists seek intellectual property protections over virus genetic sequence data. Furthermore, biosecurity considerations are often the impetus to deny access to pathogen samples or sensitive data. Indeed, one 2012 influenza experiment branded \u201cdual use research of concern\u201d (DURC) led to a sovereignty-like claim by the Netherlands in an effort to supress publication of the experiment\u2019s results using export control laws.128 Restricting access comes in many forms, not just sovereignty claims. One of the objectives of the Global Health Security Agenda (GHSA) is to \u201c[s]trengthen the global norm of rapid, transparent reporting and sample sharing\u201d,129 but as we have seen, this is no longer the norm.",

The international regime created by the CBD and Nagoya Protocol defaults to bilateral ABS negotiations on a case-by-case basis.130 This default mode of ABS is extremely time consuming and not appropriate in global health emergencies where time costs lives. The PIP Framework uses an alternative mode: a multilateral agreement that might be considered a specialised ABS instrument under the Nagoya Protocol. But the PIP Framework has major flaws as an ABS instrument131 and, as we have seen with H7N9 influenza in China, can be easily circumvented by any party not wishing to accept its standardised terms and conditions.",

While the IHR (2005) is a binding agreement, it is regularly criticised as being toothless. Any amendment to mandate sample sharing under the IHR (2005) would require a rider detailing sanctions if it is to affect any nations\u2019 cost-benefit analysis during a public health emergency. Attaching sanctions to the IHR (2005) is likely to be unpalatable for many countries, not just LMICs. Therefore, Article 4(4) of the Nagoya Protocol on specialised ABS instruments may provide the only avenue to deal with the issue of viral sovereignty. It would allow for the adoption of a multilateral agreement that, like the PIP Framework, would put the WHO at the centre of a constellation of stakeholders. Carter has argued \u201cthat the WHO must offer positive incentives so developing countries will have a compelling reason to share samples of newly discovered viruses with the international scientific and health communities\u201d,133 and a multilateral instrument might be a mechanism through which to do that.",

If we fail to find a solution that aligns with the object and purpose of the CBD, then individual nations will simply opt to negotiate access terms on an ad hoc basis, and lives will likely be lost in the process. As the examples here indicate, many of those lives are likely to be in the rich countries of the world.
