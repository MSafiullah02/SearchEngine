The outcome of viral encephalitis can be considered the result of a competition between the virus and the host immune system. The parameters governing this outcome include the intrinsic virulence of the infecting virus, its tropism, replicative potential, and interactions with the immune system. In addition, the virus infection triggers a host immune response which may be protective or may contribute to the disease process (reviewed in Noseworthy, 1999, Pavesi et al., 1992). Thus, the balance of these factors within the CNS may result in a return to homeostasis, the development of autoimmunity, or the occurrence of fatal encephalitis.",

            "text": "A variety of murine coronavirus strains differ radically in their pathogenic potential and disease outcome rendering them useful models to study the generation of immune responses critical to this balance. Infection with the mouse hepatitis virus (MHV)-JHM causes severe encephalitis with a high mortality when inoculated intracranially or intranasally into susceptible adult mice (Phillips et al., 1999). In contrast, infection with the mildly neurovirulent MHV-A59 strain results in viral clearance and the development of demyelinating lesions resembling those in multiple sclerosis Lai and Stohlman, 1981, Lavi et al., 1984, Woyciechowska et al., 1984, Zou et al., 1999. Although these viruses share many features, differences in the spike glycoprotein, hemagglutinin/esterase, and other proteins may be responsible for the enhanced capacity of MHV-JHM to infect the brain. Despite observations from different laboratories which suggest that MHV-JHM and MHV-A59 are able to infect astrocytes, oligodendrocytes, and to a lesser degree neurons, MHV-JHM invades the brain more extensively Lavi et al., 1999, Phillips et al., 2002, van Berlo et al., 1989, Woyciechowska et al., 1984. Variation is also apparent in the CD8 T cell epitopes, such that of the two known epitopes on the MHV-JHM spike protein (S510 and S598), only one (S598) is shared by MHV-A59 due to a deletion in the MHV-A59 spike protein Bergmann et al., 1996, Castro and Perlman, 1996. In addition, it has been speculated that MHV-A59 may contain unidentified CD8 epitopes (Marten et al., 2001).",

            "text": "It is now appreciated that glial and neuronal cells are capable of responding to infection by releasing chemokines and cytokines that trigger innate immune responses in the absence of peripheral immune cells (Olson et al., 2001). Release of type I (IFN\u03b1/\u03b2) and type II (IFN\u03b3) interferons and production of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as interleukin (IL)-6 and IL-1 are important early events in response to viral infection Parra et al., 1997, LeBlanc et al., 1999. IFN\u03b3, in particular, is critical in resolving MHV infection Marten et al., 2001, Parra et al., 1999, Schijns et al., 1998. The production of innate immune mediators, such as IL-12, IL-4, and interferons, acts to establish a microenvironment capable of directing adaptive T and B cell responses; whereas, production of RANTES, macrophage-inflammatory protein (MIP), and other chemokines acts to recruit T cells and macrophages into the CNS following infection Lane et al., 1998, Liu and Lane, 2001. This migration in response to chemokines is reenforced later by the infiltrating leukocytes themselves. These cells can provide protective immunity against CNS infections, as demonstrated by the requirement of cytolytic CD8 T cell activity in the clearance of MHV infections Bergmann et al., 1999, Gombold et al., 1995, Marten et al., 2001. However, an inappropriate combination of these same factors or timing of their release may result in the initiation of neurologic disease (Olsson, 1995). Thus, the quality and magnitude of the innate and adaptive responses can influence both the recovery from infection and the development of immunopathology.",

In this study, we sought to understand how viral modulation of early immune responses might influence the outcome of CNS disease following infection with the highly neurovirulent virus, MHV-JHM. MHV-JHM was administered intracranially in the absence of immune manipulation resulting in fatal encephalomyelitis. Chemokine, cytokine, and cellular immune responses in the CNS compartment were documented and compared against mildly neurovirulent MHV-A59 infection. The lack of MHV-JHM clearance was associated with diminished IFN\u03b3 and CD8 T cell responses. However, the expression of IL-6 and IFN\u03b2 mRNA was unabated. In contrast, mice infected with MHV-A59 exhibited decreasing accumulation of IL-6 and IFN\u03b2 mRNA, combined with early and consistent IFN\u03b3 transcripts that corresponded with the influx of CD8 T cells into the CNS, and control of viral replication by 7 days after infection. Furthermore, MHV-JHM infection was marked by high levels of MIP-1\u03b1, MIP-1\u03b2, and MIP-2 mRNA correlating with a greater infiltration of macrophages into the brain compared to that observed in MHV-A59-infected animals. The data presented in this report highlight the crucial role that viral induction of early innate immune responses may have in outcome of disease within the CNS.",

MHV-A59 needed to be given at 1000 PFU to induce similar disease scores on day 7 as MHV-JHM at 10 PFU. Therefore, MHV-A59 was also used at 1000 PFU to provide a control that more closely approximated the severity of clinical disease seen in MHV-JHM infection. Examining immune responses from viral infections resulting in similar disease scores increased our confidence that the responses measured following MHV-JHM infection were a function of viral activity and not merely secondary to the more severe clinical disease seen in MHV-JHM infection.",

Mice were injected with MHV-JHM, MHV-A59, or saline (sham). Total RNA was isolated from brains harvested on days 3, 5, and 7 postinjection. With the exception of IL-18 and transforming growth factor (TGF)-\u03b2, which were consistently elevated from background even in uninoculated brain (data not shown), saline injections did not induce detectable levels of mRNA message for the cytokines examined (Fig. 2)\n. Macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF) (data not shown) and tumor neurosis factor (TNF)-\u03b1 (Fig. 2) mRNA transcripts were strongly and similarly enhanced in both MHV-JHM and MHV-A59 infections. Otherwise, MHV-JHM infection produced a cytokine mRNA profile distinct from that following MHV-A59 infection. Most striking was the difference in the induction of IFN\u03b2 and IFN\u03b3 mRNA levels. IFN\u03b2 message was induced early in MHV-JHM infection, before the infiltration of peripheral immune cells, and continuously transcribed into day 7, after the arrival of peripheral immune cells (Fig. 2). This differed from MHV-A59 infection where moderate IFN\u03b2 mRNA accumulation evident at day 3 was further reduced by day 7. In contrast to its ability to induce IFN\u03b2, IL-12 p40 and IFN\u03b3 messages were not detected until 5 days after MHV-JHM infection, but were already evident 3 days following MHV-A59 infection (Fig. 2). These differences in interferon transcript levels could significantly influence the direct ability to clear MHV, as well as the infiltration of T cells into the brain Yasuda et al., 1999, Zou et al., 1999.",

Therefore, mononuclear cells were isolated from infected brains on day 7 and stained to distinguish CD8, CD4, and NK1.1 cells. MHV-JHM-infected brains yielded approximately a 2.5-fold decrease in the percentage of CD8 T cells within the infiltrating cell population as compared to MHV-A59-infected brains.

Thus, the capacity of CD8 T cells to produce IFN\u03b3 was also examined by intracellular staining. Mononuclear cells isolated from infected brains were stimulated with a control peptide or viral peptides (S510 or S598). Whether other epitopes exist on the MHV-A59 background is currently unknown (Marten et al., 2001). As previously demonstrated (Castro et al., 1994), the S510 epitope was immunodominant in MHV-JHM infection (Fig. 4A)\n. CD8 cells from MHV-JHM-infected brains also exhibited a greater response against the S598 epitope compared to cells from MHV-A59-infected brains (Fig. 4B). Anti-CD3 activates antigen-experienced cells (Yee et al., 1994) and was used to characterize the ability of total CD8 T cell population, which entered the brain in response to infection, to produce IFN\u03b3. To evaluate the relationship between the anti-CD3 and viral peptide stimulations, the percentages of IFN\u03b3+ CD8 T cells observed following these stimulations were compared (Fig. 4C). MHV-JHM infection resulted in similar percentages of IFN\u03b3+ CD8 T cells in response to either anti-CD3 (21.5%) or known viral peptides (24.2%), resulting in a viral/anti-CD3 ratio of 1:1. In contrast, following MHV-A59 infection, only about 0.29 of the anti-CD3 response reflected that of the viral peptide S598.",

This possibility was evaluated directly by FACS analysis of cells within the analyzed within the mononuclear cell gate (as determined by forward and side scatter) and stained with macrophage markers. Macrophage populations were determined by staining isolated cells with anti-CD45 and either anti-Fc\u03b3R or anti-CD11b enabling differentiation between macrophages (CD45 high/CD11b high) and microglial cells (CD45 intermediate/CD11b high) (Carson et al., 1998).

A subsequent impact on leukocyte recruitment was evident by the macrophage-dominated cellular infiltrate deficient in CD8 T cells.

            "text": "Throughout the course of MHV-JHM and MHV-A59 infections, mRNA levels of MIF and TNF\u03b1 were greatly enhanced (Fig. 2). Both infections also triggered the accumulation of early IFN\u03b2 transcripts that were sustained in MHV-JHM infection, but essentially undetectable in MHV-A59 infection by day 7, perhaps due to the difference in viral loads (Fig. 2). IFN\u03b2 production is an essential component in the control of some viral infections Biron et al., 1999, Orange and Biron, 1996. However, in MHV infection, continued IFN\u03b2 appears to have limited benefit, considering the strong, but clearly ineffective, IFN\u03b2 transcription seen in MHV-JHM infection (Fig. 2) and the inability of exogenous IFN\u03b2 to protect against MHV infection of astrocytoma cells (unpublished data). In contrast, IFN\u03b3 is considered essential for MHV clearance as observed by an increase in mortality among IFN\u03b3-knockout and IFN\u03b3 receptor-knockout mice infected with attenuated MHV strains Marten et al., 2001, Parra et al., 1999, Schijns et al., 1998. Interferons also impact T cell responses. The enhanced presence of IFN\u03b2 might impede T cell activity as demonstrated in experimental models of MS, where IFN\u03b2 treatment ameliorated disease impairing T cell proliferation and migration into the brain Yasuda et al., 1999, Zou et al., 1999. IFN\u03b3, on the other hand, promotes the T cell migration into the brain in part by upregulating adhesion and co-stimulatory molecules within the CNS and the periphery (Grau et al., 1997). Therefore, the lag in IFN\u03b3 mRNA expression and the enhanced IFN\u03b2, compared to IFN\u03b3, transcript levels following MHV-JHM inoculation (Fig. 2) could be instrumental to the failure to control viral replication both directly and indirectly resulting in the lack of appropriate support for CD8 T cells Fig. 3, Fig. 4, Fig. 5. The early (d. 3) resident brain cell, possibly neuronal, transcription of IFN\u03b3 mRNA in MHV-A59 infection defines an environment that would be more supportive of CD8 T cell responses (Mori et al., 2001).",

Anti-CD3 stimulation was used as a positive control and to quantitate the capacity of the total CD8 T cell population to produce IFN\u03b3. In MHV-JHM infection, the known viral epitopes reflected the full potential for antigen-experienced cells to produce IFN\u03b3 following anti-CD3 stimulation (indicating that in MHV-JHM infection, the response from the anti-CD3 stimulation is representative of the viral epitope stimulations, Fig. 4C). In contrast, following MHV-A59 infection, the viral epitope stimulations were a fraction (0.29) of the anti-CD3 stimulation. This suggests that an undefined immunodominant epitope, capable of inducing IFN\u03b3 synthesis, exists within the MHV-A59 genome that is absent in MHV-JHM. Alternatively, this may reflect the activation of non-virus-specific CD8 cells or some combination of these events (Bergmann et al., 1999). The diminished CD8 T cell presence in MHV-JHM-infected brains also appeared to reduce the potential for IFN\u03b3 production in the brain, resulting in a 3-fold lower potential percentage of IFN\u03b3+ mononuclear cells isolated from the MHV-JHM-infected brain as compared to MHV-A59-infected brain (Fig. 4D).",

The enhanced CD8 apoptosis may reflect clonal exhaustion of anti-viral CD8 T cells due to the high antigenic burden of elevated MHV-JHM titers (Moskophidis et al., 1993). Alternatively, macrophages recruited into the brain upon MHV-JHM infection (Fig. 8) may instigate or amplify CD8 T cell apoptosis, as activated macrophages can induce premature CD8 T cell apoptosis (Bronte et al., 1998). Moreover, enhanced T cell apoptosis was observed within a week of a lethal influenza viral strain HK483 concomitant with elevated MIP-1\u03b1 production within the brain (Tumpey et al., 2000). Further studies should determine whether macrophage activity influences CD8 T cell survival in MHV-JHM infection.",

On the contrary, robust transcription of IL-1 and IL-6 mRNA following MHV-JHM, but not MHV-A59, infection was evident (Fig. 6). The ability of MHV-JHM to induce greater production of IL-6 protein was confirmed by intracellular cytokine staining of cells isolated from the brain (Fig. 6B) and in vitro within the supernatant of mixed glial neuronal cultures (Rempel et al., 2004). Chronic IL-6 production has been implicated in CNS inflammatory diseases including experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis Merrill, 1992, Okuda et al., 1999, Sun et al., 1995, Vandenabeele and Fiers, 1991. High levels of IL-6 transcripts, in the presence of either IFN\u03b2 or IL-1 message, have also been documented in lethal encephalitic viral infections Parra et al., 1997, Theil et al., 2000, Wesselingh et al., 1994. Astrocytes are a main reservoir for MHV within the CNS and previously have been shown to be a primary producer of IL-6 following MHV infection (Sun et al., 1995). Negligible FACS co-staining of IL-6 with CD8 or CD11b (data not shown) supported the probability that astrocytes were the source of the IL-6 observed here. The contribution of MHV-JHM-induced IL-6 production to CNS responses is the subject of an ongoing investigation using mixed glial neuronal cultures.",

Activated glial cells can produce chemokines thereby influencing the composition of the ensuing cellular infiltrate. In vitro and in vivo studies have demonstrated that glial cells produce MIP-1\u03b1 and MIP-1\u03b2, along with RANTES, in response to MHV and other CNS infections Asensio et al., 1999, Hoffman et al., 1999, Kitai et al., 2000, Lane et al., 1998. MIP-1\u03b1 and MIP-1\u03b2 predominately enhanced the migration of macrophages, eosinophils, and T cells (Baggiolini et al., 1994). Upregulation of MIP-1 message following MHV-JHM infection corresponded with elevated CD45 high/FcR high or CD45 high/CD11b high staining positive cells assessed within a mononuclear cell gate (Carson et al., 1998). These cells are most likely macrophages as staining with anti-B220 and anti-NK1.1 was, respectively, diminished and similar from MHV-JHM compared to MHV-A59-infected brains (data not shown, Fig. 3). Although macrophages often play a protective role in immune defense, their presence has also been associated with inflammatory diseases, lethal viral infections, and neurodegeneration Lidbury et al., 2000, Smits et al., 2000, Xiong et al., 1999. Severe MHV infections have been previously associated with increased macrophage activation, seen in the upregulation of inducible nitric oxide synthase message in the brain and macrophage procoagulant activity in the periphery Fingerote et al., 1996, Parra et al., 1997. It is probable that the heightened MIP-2 mRNA levels that were observed in MHV-JHM infection are chemotatic for neutrophils. Preliminary experiments with anti-Ly-6G monoclonal antibody (RB6, using a polynuclear cell gate) revealed a 1.6- to 2-fold greater presence of neutrophils in MHV-JHM-infected brains as compared to MHV-A59 (data not shown). Future studies may demonstrate that neutrophils contribute to the limited protection seen in wild-type MHV-JHM infection, as observed in broader protection seen following an attenuated MHV-JHM viral infection (Zhou et al., 2003). However, taken together, the chemokine and cellular infiltration patterns observed here support our conclusion that MHV-JHM infection induces a pattern of immune responses that may be detrimental to recovery.",

An increasing number of viral components have been found to activate different immune responses, including IFN\u03b3 downregulation and apoptosis Basler et al., 2000, Chen et al., 2001, Park et al., 2001. Considering the genetic similarity of MHV-JHM and MHV-A59, it is likely that distinct viral gene products will be found to impact immune responses. Zhang et al. (1998) reported that expression of MHV-JHM hemagglutinin/esterase, using defective interfering particles, in a MHV-A59 infection enhances the accumulation of IL-6 mRNA in vitro. In addition, other studies in our laboratory (submitted) indicate that elevated MIP-1 transcripts and macrophage recruitment by MHV-JHM was associated with enhanced mortality following infection with a chimeric virus containing the MHV-JHM spike gene expressed on the MHV-A59 background.",

MHV-A59 results in mild encephalitis at 10 PFU Phillips et al., 1999, Talbot and Buchmeier, 1985. Therefore, MHV-A59 was also administered at 1000 PFU, a dose that produces similar disease scores as MHV-JHM on day 7, the peak of encephalitis (Fig. 1). Day 7 was used as an end point, since mice infected with MHV-JHM generally succumbed to infection between days 7 and 10. On days 3, 5, and 7, animals were anesthetized with chloral hydrate (Sigma, St. Louis, MO) and perfused with saline.
