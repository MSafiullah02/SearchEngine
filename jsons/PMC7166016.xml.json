As reported by Gautret et al., treatment of Covid-19 patients with HCQ may rapidly reduce viral loads [2]. This strategy could potentially prove harmful to Covid-19 patients, especially those with minimally symptomatic disease. HCQ could limit the duration of exposure of the immune system to the virus. In addition, it has an immunosuppressive effect, this being the rationale for its use in patients with autoimmune disease [3].",
