            "text": "In December 2019, a novel coronavirus, currently designated severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), formerly called 2019-nCoV, was first identified in Wuhan, China. SARS-CoV-2 caused a respiratory disease called Coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) which was officially named by the World Health Organization (WHO) on February 11, 2020. COVID-19 had caused severe illness and death in China and had spread to countries around the world.1, 2, 3, 4 By March 30, 2020, a total of 82447 confirmed cases have been reported in China.5 Moreover, 552479 cases have been confirmed in other countries, mainly in America, Italy and Spain.5 The main symptoms of COVID-19 are fever, dry cough, fatigue, sputum production, shortness of breath, and sore throat.6 Asymptomatic infected individuals, called \u201casymptomatic carrier or transmitter\u201d, may also become the contagious source of SARS-CoV-2, and some of them progress rapidly, even resulting in acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) with a high case-fatality rate.7, 8, 9, 10 However, the positive rate of SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid testing by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), which is the golden standard for the diagnosis of COVID-19, is only about 30-50%. The high false-negative result rate of SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid testing inevitably increases the difficulty in managing the current COVID-19 outbreak as the misdiagnosed patients might miss the best timing for proper treatment and cause the spread of disease.11 The chest computed tomography (CT), especially high-resolution CT (HRCT) is also the main diagnostic method followed by \"Pneumonia diagnosis and treatment guideline for SARS-CoV-2 infection (trial version 5)\" issued by National Health Commission of the People's Republic of China (http://www.nhc.gov.cn/). CT findings plays an important role in detecting lung abnormalities, facilitate the early identification of the diseases.",

GGO was defined as hazy opacity that did not obscure underlying bronchial and vascular margins; consolidation was the opacity with obscuration of bronchial and vascular structures; reticulation is a collection of innumerable small linear opacities; halo sign is a ground-glass opacity surrounding a nodule or mass; interlobular septal thickening is thin linear opacities at right angles to and in contact with the lateral pleural surfaces near the lung bases; crazy-paving pattern was defined as thickened interlobular septa and intralobular lines superimposed on a background of GGO, resembling irregularly shaped paving stones.12\n",

All patients had a clear exposure to COVID-19. All 58 patients were asymptomatic at admission. The average age of patients was 42.60\u00b116.56 years old. Based on the CT findings of first reexamination after admission, 58 patients were divided into four groups: 1. Absorption group (22 cases, 37.9%), 2. Improvement group (23 cases, 39.7%),3. No change group (3 cases, 5.2%), 4. Progression group (10 cases, 17.2%) (see Figure 2\n). Among these asymptomatic patients, 16 patients (27.6%) presented symptoms after admission, including fever (8 cases, 50%), cough (9 cases, 56.3%), fatigue (8 cases, 50%), shortness of breath (2 cases, 12.5%) and diarrhea (1 case, 6.3%). In these 16 patients, 10 patients (62.5%) were in lesion progression group, 3 patients (18.75%) were in lesion improvement group and 3 patients (18.75%) were in no change group. The average days before symptoms onset is 3.71\u00b12.86 days, patients in lesion progression group have shorter days before symptoms onset (3.25\u00b12.77 day). CT findings at admission showed abnormalities in all patients (seen in Figure 1). Less than half of the patients (24, 41.4%) presented bilateral lesions; 34 (58.6%) patients showed unilateral lung distribution, including 14 (24.1%) in left lung and 20 (34.5%) in right lung. The lesions mostly located in peripheral (44, 75.9%), and 14 (24.1%) patients presented central distribution. The involvement of lower lobes (right 68.9% vs left 62.1%) was a bit more than that of the upper lobes (right 51.7% vs left 53.4%). 24 (41.4%) patients had single lobe involved, 14 (24.1%) patients had involved of two lobes, and 20 (34.5%) patients had three or more lobes involved. The most common pattern of CT findings was GGO (55,94.8%), including simple GGO in 30 cases (51.7%), GGO with fine reticulation in 7 cases (12.1%), GGO with subpleural curviliner line in 6 cases (10.3%), GGO with air bronchogram in 5 cases (8.6%), GGO with halo sign in 5 cases (8.6%) and GGO with vascular enlargement in 2 cases (3.5%). Another CT feature, consolidation was presented in 3 cases (5.2%). Compared with the CT images at admission, there were evolution of CT manifestations in 10 patients at the first reexamination after admission. Lesions were fused to form patchy, crazy-paving signs, or diffusion pattern, distributed in multiple lung lobes or bilateral, and a few patients showed consolidation in CT imaging. In these patients, there were significantly lower lymphocyte count(P=0.009), higher C-reactive protein (P=0.023) than that in other cases. The average days of hospitalization is 19.80\u00b110.82 days, and the hospitalization of patients (28.60\u00b17.55 day) in progression group was significantly longer than others(P=0.016).",

At the time of admission, all patients had not any symptoms, but all had abnormal CT findings. GGO was the main CT manifestation in this cluster of patients (55, 94.8%), consolidation was present in other 3 patients (5.2%). The lesions of CT imaging in asymptomatic patients with COVID-19 pneumonia were predominantly located in the peripheral and subpleural area of the lung (44, 75.9%), mostly involving one or two lung lobes (38, 65.5%). GGO lesions were inclined to distribute in the lower lobes (left 62.1% vs right 68.9%). In addition to pure GGO, it is often accompanied by other characteristic imaging, including fine reticuticulatio, subpleural curviliner line, halo sign, air bronchogram and vascular enlargement.14, 15, 16, 17 The CT manifestations of COVID-19 pneumonia had its pathophysiological basis.18 Since the diameter of SARS-CoV-2 is about 60-140nm, and the size of the alveolar pores is about 10-15\u03bcm, after inhaled through the respiratory tract, SARS-CoV-2 invades the bronchioles, mainly involving the interstitium around bronchioles at the end of lobular bronchioles, causing bronchiolitis and peribronchitis, and spreads to the distal end. Therefore, the lesion originates from a round-like nodule in the core of the secondary lung lobule, which were usually shown as round ground-glass opacity at first, and then extends to the whole secondary pulmonary lobules, forming lobular patchy imaging. SARS-CoV-2 mainly invades the interlobular interstitium, resulting in the appearance of fine reticulation sign. Halo sign is the image that the lesion infiltrates from central nodule of lobule core to surrounding interstitium and accumulation of inflammatory cells in interstitium. The virus spreads along both sides of reticular structure of the interlobular septa, leading to the sign that the long axis of the lesion is parallel to the pleura. Inflammatory stimulation leads to thickening of blood vessels in the lesion, which results in a corresponding alteration on imaging.",
