AGP is an acronym that has become increasingly familiar to dentists even if the exact list of dental procedures has never really been nailed down to everyone's satisfaction. But it certainly includes the use of an air turbine and a water spray which means that the most versatile piece of dental equipment was now consigned to a locked cupboard; sterilised, oiled and ready for release sometime in the future.
