Acute leukemia, for example, predisposes to neutropenia and other defects of innate immunity. Profound neutropenia (<500 cells/mm3) of greater than 10-day duration is considered a strong risk factor for bacterial and invasive fungal infection [1]. In addition to neutropenia, other factors that increase risk for invasive aspergillosis include advanced or refractory acute myelogenous leukemia, high-risk myelodysplastic syndrome, chronic neutropenia prior to chemotherapy, iron overload secondary to repeated peripheral blood transfusions, and prior fungal infection [2\u20136]. Further, antileukemic agents have been shown to diminish antibody response to primary antigens, thereby increasing susceptibility to bacterial pathogens even in the absence of neutropenia [7]. Other underlying diseases such as primary immunodeficiency, for example, may predispose to progression or reactivation of antecedent infections, and individuals with myelodysplastic syndrome who are neutropenic at the time of transplant are at an increased risk of infection and mortality. In addition to innate immune defects, increasing age, waning cellular immunity, organ dysfunction, fragile skin, and prior antibiotic exposure may all contribute to the progression of preexisting infection, including aspergillosis, as well as to the risk for new infections during the posttransplant period [8\u201311].",

The goals of conditioning are twofold: (1) to suppress the recipient\u2019s immune system, particularly the T-cell arm, in order to prevent rejection of the graft, and (2) to eliminate the tumor. Many regimens are myeloablative, employing total body irradiation and cytotoxic chemotherapy, with resultant profound and prolonged neutropenia, mucositis, and potential organ toxicities. Recipients of such conditioning are highly susceptible to early infection and sepsis. Less intense regimens increasingly used in some of the more vulnerable older patients may result in minimal neutropenia and mucositis and a correspondingly lower risk of infection [12].

Cord blood cells, in contrast, are typically obtained from unrelated donors and confer a much lower stem cell dose than in the other transplants. Cord blood stem cell transplant recipients have delayed engraftment, such that neutropenia may extend for 6 weeks or longer and T-cell immune dysfunction may persist for months to years [15].",

When unmanipulated bone marrow or peripheral stem cells are used, 24\u2013300 \u00d7 106/kg CD3 cells are administered. Ex vivo pretreatment of the graft may produce up to a 3-log reduction in cells transplanted and decrease the potential risk and severity of GVHD. However, there is a resultant prolonged T-cell immunodeficiency, and the patient must then walk an immunological-infection tightrope for many months. If an untreated graft is transplanted, then any one of a variety of immunosuppressive regimens may be given. Examples are sirolimus and a calcineurin inhibitor, such as tacrolimus. It appears that these regimens pose a lower infection risk than pretransplant T-cell ablation [16]. Sirolimus therapy has also been associated with a reduced risk of cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection [17, 18].",

The combined effect of neutropenia and mucositis contributes to high risk of reactivation of HSV in seropositive patients, prompting standard use of acyclovir during this period [26, 27]. These factors also predispose to candidemia and early-onset aspergillosis [24]. While prophylactic antifungals are used in the pre-engraftment period, fluconazole prophylaxis has been linked to an increased risk of non-albicans candidal infections, particularly due to C. glabrata and C. krusei [28\u201330]. Voriconazole prophylaxis has also been associated with an increased risk of zygomycosis in this setting [31\u201334]. Additionally, mechanical disruption of the skin and the use of prophylactic antibiotics targeted toward gut flora increase the risk for bloodstream infections with Gram-positive flora, particularly viridians group streptococci and coagulase-negative staphylococci [25, 35].",

The main sources for bacteremia are the oral or gastrointestinal mucositis, the respiratory tract, and the presence of central venous catheters. Infecting organisms are commonly Gram-positive cocci such as Streptococcus viridans and enterococci or a variety of fermenting and non-fermenting Gram-negative rods. Enterococci are increasingly resistant to vancomycin, and these strains have been associated with a worse prognosis than vancomycin-sensitive strains [39]. Some recent studies also report an increase in infections due to multidrug resistant (MDR) Gram-negative rods such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa and carbapenemase-producing Klebsiella pneumoniae [40\u201343]. The isolation of such resistant bacteria has been associated with the use of fluoroquinolone prophylaxis and third-generation cephalosporins in several reports. These infections carry a high mortality and often relapse.\n",

Hypervirulent strains of Clostridium difficile, including the epidemic North American pulse-field gel electrophoresis type 1 (NAP1) and ribotype 027/toxinotype III strains, have specifically been associated with moxifloxacin and other members of the fluoroquinolone class [49, 50].

GVHD is a major risk factor for VZV reactivation [107]. Clinical manifestations include either classic or multi-dermatomal shingles with lesions usually taking longer to heal that in immunocompetent patients.

This prompted the widespread use of fluconazole prophylaxis in the early posttransplant period. More recent data from the Prospective Antifungal Therapy (PATH) Alliance registry, however, reported a 28% and 23% incidence of invasive candidiasis in allo-HSCT recipients from matched-related and matched-unrelated donors, respectively [138]. While Candida albicans\naccounted for over half of all episodes of invasive candidiasis in HSCT recipients in the 1980s, invasive candidiasis caused by azole-resistant Candida species such as C. glabrata and C. krusei has increased since the 1990s, which may reflect the routine use of fluconazole prophylaxis [28\u201330, 137, 138].",

In contrast, hepatosplenic candidiasis, or chronic disseminated candidiasis, results from invasion of Candida species into the portal vasculature with subsequent seeding of the liver and/or spleen during periods of neutropenia. While the exact incidence of hepatosplenic candidiasis remains unknown, one autopsy study identified hepatic candidal infection\nin 9% of HSCT recipients [140]. Patients typically present with fever and an elevated alkaline phosphatase level following neutrophil recovery. Blood cultures tend to be negative in this setting, but computed tomography of the abdomen demonstrates multiple lesions in the liver and spleen; such lesions decrease in size with recurrent neutropenia, indicating that hepatosplenic candidiasis results from a systemic inflammatory response. Biopsy is required for definitive diagnosis, especially because other IFIs and malignancy can result in a similar clinical syndrome.",

One recent study demonstrated a sensitivity and specificity of 87.5% and 85.5%, respectively, of this assay.

Several studies have demonstrated comparable efficacy between both antifungal classes; however, echinocandins have been associated with a more favorable toxicity profile [143, 144]. Voriconazole may be used in situations where additional mold coverage is desired; however, since voriconazole resistance has been seen in 3% of Candida infections\nin solid organ and HSCT recipients, this agent should not be used unless susceptibility of the isolate is confirmed [145, 146]. As the majority of cases of hepatosplenic candidiasis are caused by C. albicans, clinically stable patients may receive fluconazole. Those who are acutely ill or who have relapsed disease should receive 1\u20132 weeks of induction with liposomal amphotericin B or an echinocandin followed by fluconazole. Duration of therapy for hepatosplenic candidiasis is dependent upon resolution of visceral lesions, typically 3\u20136 months.

The second peak occurs post-engraftment (\u201clate period\u201d), typically defined as 41+ days following transplant, and tends to arise in the setting of acute or chronic GVHD [147, 148, 150]. Age >40 has been associated with the development of invasive aspergillosis at any time following transplantation, as have donor and recipient polymorphisms in various Toll-like receptors and genes regulating interleukin-1, interleukin-10 promoter, and plasminogen [147, 151\u2013155]. Specifically, donor haplotype 1363T/1063G, which contains two cosegregated single nucleotide polymorphisms in the Toll-like receptor 4 gene, has been associated with the development of invasive aspergillosis [151]. Single nucleotide polymorphisms in the chemokine ligand 10 (CXCL-10) gene have also been demonstrated to reduce dendritic cell CXCL-10 expression when exposed to Aspergillus germlings; these polymorphisms have also been associated with invasive aspergillosis\nfollowing allo-HSCT [154]. Hematologic malignancies other than chronic myelogenous leukemia in the chronic phase, as well as aplastic anemia, myelodysplastic syndrome, mismatched donor, the use of cord blood, summer season, lack of laminar air flow, and local building construction, have been identified as risk factors for invasive aspergillosis in the early posttransplant period. The risk of invasive aspergillosis in the late posttransplant period increases in the setting of underlying multiple myeloma, use of T-cell-depleted or CD34-selected stem cell products, neutropenia, lymphopenia, use of corticosteroids, CMV disease, respiratory virus infection, and GVHD [147, 148]. GVHD and CMV disease are the major risk factors for the development of invasive aspergillosis >6 months after transplantation [148]. The contribution of GVHD to the risk of invasive aspergillosis\nis highlighted by the fact that conditioning regimens do not appear to impact the incidence of this invasive fungal infection. While the period of neutropenia is shorter and the incidence of early invasive aspergillosis is less in non-myeloablative HSCT recipients, this group remains at highest risk in the late posttransplant period in conjunction with GVHD [12, 156\u2013158].",

Clinical presentation may be variable, but frequently includes fever, cough, chest pain, hemoptysis, and/or respiratory failure, and the presence of these symptoms should prompt CT of the chest. Lung lesions, with surrounding ground-glass halos, nodular infiltrates, and cavitations, are highly suggestive of pulmonary aspergillosis; however, radiographic findings can be variable in allo-HSCT recipients with concomitant GVHD and include focal infiltrates and/or bronchopneumonia [160]. Given the lack of specificity of symptoms and radiographic findings, prompt microbiologic diagnosis via bronchoscopy should be pursued. Diagnosis of invasive aspergillosis may also be facilitated with use of the Aspergillus galactomannan assay, which employs a double-sandwich enzyme immunoassay to detect the galactomannan component of the Aspergillus cell wall. While the sensitivity of the serum galactomannan assay has varied between studies, it has proven clinically useful for the diagnosis of invasive aspergillosis\nand monitoring of clinical response during therapy [161, 162]. The galactomannan assay on bronchoalveolar lavage fluid in patients with hematologic malignancies and HSCT recipients has demonstrated higher sensitivity than bronchoalveolar lavage culture, cytology, and the serum galactomannan assay [163]. Important caveats for the use of galactomannan testing include false negative results in individuals receiving concomitant antifungals, false positive results in children and patients receiving beta-lactams, particularly piperacillin-tazobactam, and cross-reactivity with plasmalyte [164\u2013166]. The beta-D-glucan test, which detects beta-glucans in the cell wall of molds and yeasts except zygomycetes and cryptococci, may also be a valuable adjunctive screening test for invasive aspergillosis\nparticularly in conjunction with the galactomannan assay, though the performance characteristics of the beta-D-glucan assay in the HSCT population have not yet been evaluated.",

Voriconazole is also the preferred therapy for Aspergillus tracheobronchitis [168]. Combination therapy with an echinocandin and either amphotericin B or a mold-active azole may be more efficacious than voriconazole alone, however, particularly for salvage therapy [169, 170].

In regions of the world with a higher seroprevalence, incidence rates of toxoplasmosis are predictably higher [187]. Disease usually occurs in the first 6 months after transplantation [185, 186]. Besides seropositivity, the main risk factor for reactivation is intensification of immunosuppression due to GVHD [186].

PCP and Toxoplasma prophylaxis is accomplished with sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim for 6\u201313 months, although this practice varies when taking into consideration the myelosuppressive effects of this drug combination. Dapsone, atovaquone, and pentamidine are alternatives for PCP prophylaxis. Of those, only atovaquone has activity against Toxoplasma as well.
