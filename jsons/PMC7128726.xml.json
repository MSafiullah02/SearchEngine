Soylev et al. develop a method that combines diverse signatures such as read-pair, read-depth, and split-read into a single package to characterize most SV types, allowing easy and accurate SV discovery [1]. Jiao et al. propose a new guilt-by-approach to infer metagenomic data for predicting potentially novel pathways and functional association between proteins [2]. They demonstrate that microbial community profiling outperforms phylogenetic profiling, and reveals more functional associations. Lee et al. present a novel approach for detecting associations among genotypes, transcript, and phenotypes [3]. They applied the method to an Alzheimer\u2019s disease dataset and found genotype (shown by single nucleotide polymorphism)\u2013transcript\u2013phenotype (disease status) associations. Genome structural variations (SVs) are genomic alterations of >50 bp in size and play major roles in genome evolution and pathogenesis of diseases of genomic origin.",

Deletions of hepatitis B virus (HBV) are associated with the development of progressive liver diseases leading to hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Accordingly, detecting the exact breakpoints of deletion with characteristics of HBV genome sequences from next-generation sequencing (NGS) outputs is critical for improving the prognosis and treatment of liver disease. Cheng et al. propose a novel analytical method named VirDelect (Virus Deletion Detect), which finds exact breakpoints of deletion effectively and efficiently, outperforming the latest state-of-the-art methods [4]. Kang et al. present a machine learning based method to predict candidate interactions between viral microRNA and endogenous human microRNA sponges, which bind to and inhibit microRNA [5]. Through computational prediction and experimental validation using luciferase reporter assay, western blot, and flow cytometry, a potential natural miRNA sponge that acts against microRNA derived from Kaposi\u2019s sarcoma-associated herpesvirus has been found.",

Ou-Yang et al. developed a node-based multi-view differential network analysis model to infer differential networks from multi-platform gene expression data [6]. They applied the model to real TCGA ovarian cancer samples and identified network rewiring associated with drug resistance. Using large-scale machine learning techniques, Choi et al. analyzed the emotional public response to a nationwide outbreak of Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) in Korea [7]. They collected mass media outlet data during the outbreak in 2015 and discovered an intriguing loop of information transfer between the media and the public. This method will be helpful for alleviating the unnecessary fear and overreaction of the public regarding infectious diseases.",

MASCOT efficiently predicts synergistic target combinations with desired therapeutic effects and minimum off-target effects in a disease-related signaling network [8]. Ensemble learning algorithms and dimensionality reduction techniques were also used to predict drug-target interactions [9]. The authors applied three dimensionality reduction methods to find relevant features and applied ensemble models of decision trees and kernel ridge regression, resulting in significant improvement of drug\u2013target interaction prediction.",
