            "text": "HRV share the basic properties of viruses in the Picornaviridae family and contain genomic characteristics that closely related to human enteroviruses (HEV). They are small, non-enveloped viruses, comprising an approximately 7.2 kb of positive single-stranded RNA genome of positive polarity surrounded by an icosahedral capsid protein. The respiratory tract epithelial cells are the target of HRV infection. Since the initial discovery of HRV by virus isolation techniques in 1956, HRV have been classified into more than 100 serotypes based on several parameters such as antigen cross-reactivity and nucleotide sequence homology. According to phylogenetic analysis of the VP4/VP2 capsid protein coding regions, HRV were initially classified into 2 distinct species with 75% belonging to the HRV-A and 25% to the HRV-B. In 2006, an as yet unrecognized HRV group, HRV-C, has been detected from influenza-like illness patients by using the MassTag PCR technique.11 Using molecular techniques, the complete genomes of novel species were characterized by Lau et al. in 2007.12 And HRV-C was reported as increasing evidence to a significant cause of wheezing,13 exacerbation of asthma14, 15 and association with lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI) in children.16, 17 However, recent report describing about the epidemiology of HRV among Asian hospitalized paediatric patients with respiratory tract illness has been limited. To demonstrate details of these data, we focused on establishing prevalence and clinical association of HRV among children with LRTI. In addition, the VP4 region of HRV demonstrated from paediatric patients in Thailand was subjected to genetic characterization and phylogenetic analysis.",

Admission diagnosis criteria for acute bronchiolitis or community acquired viral pneumonia (CAP) were based on clinical presentations combined with other laboratory results and chest radiography as previously described.18, 19 The criteria recruited for acute bronchiolitis patients were as the following; patient presenting with upper respiratory tract symptoms with or without fever, abnormal lung auscultation including rhonchi or wheezing, and chest radiograph showing hyperinflation. CAP was diagnosed by the following criteria; URT symptoms with tachypnea according to the patient's age as following; less than 2 months old, respiratory rate (RR) > 60/min; 2\u201312 months old, RR > 50/min; 1\u20135 years of age, RR > 40/min; more than 5 years of age, RR > 30/min, combined with fever at onset > 37.8 \u00b0C, abnormal lung auscultation (e.g., rhonchi, crackles, wheezing) or abnormal chest radiograph consistent with pneumonia (e.g., consolidation, perihilar infiltrates).",

We detected HRV-C in 11/50 (22%) of the first time wheezers (age ranged from 4 to 23 months) and their symptoms were consistent with acute bronchiolitis (Table 2\n). Also, 9 of 50 (18%) patients were recurrent wheezers who responded well to the bronchodilators with or without corticosteroids.

            "text": "Acute wheezing that resulted from lower respiratory tract infections and exacerbation of asthma episodes are significant manifestations of disease associated by HRV infection in young children (e.g. acute bronchiolitis, asthma or RAD exacerbation).3, 4, 5, 6, 15, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38 In agreement of recent publication, most of our HRV positive patients presented with acute wheezing episodes. Moreover, we mainly detected the novel HRV-C in children with underlying asthma or RAD. This is in agreement with the recent publication. Compare to the Atlanta study,13 HRVs were detected in 37% (53/142) of paediatric patients with exacerbation of asthma and the majority of HRV strains (62%) identified as species A whereas 28% and 10% were identified as HRV-C and B, respectively. Acute exacerbation of RAD or asthma is frequently the only evidence of infection in our study. This finding is also in agreement with several studies.3, 4, 5, 6, 15, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38 We also detected RSV as a common co-infection. This may mimic the clinical presentations of HRV infection and may cause more severe disease. Nevertheless, the recent data from a large clinical cohort study (COAST) performed on asthmatic children, indicated that rather than RSV, HRVs infection of lower respiratory tract is the most important predictor of subsequent wheezing in early childhood.3 Compare to our data, we found both different HRV species and the same species caused different episodes of wheezing-LRI which might indicate a possible association between HRV infection and potential development of recurrent wheezing.28\n",
