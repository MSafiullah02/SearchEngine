            "text": "In many industrial standards, formal methods are highly recommended when developing safety critical software for the highest safety levels. However formal methods are highly recommended just like many other non-formal (combination of) techniques, as these recommendations are setup collectively and represent the industrial best practices. Convinced that formal methods could help to obtain better products [4, 5, 7, 8], more easily certifiable, a generic, safe execution platform has been researched for years, combining safety electronics and defect-free proven software. The software model is proved to be defect-free - complying with its formal specification and without programming errors. The code generators and the compilers are not defect-free. They are not required to be defect-free as the defects are detected with divergent behaviour during execution. The CLEARSY Safety Platform was initially an in-house development project before being funded by the R&D collaborative project LCHIP (Low Cost High Integrity Platform) to obtain a generic version of the platform (i.e. not only aimed at railway systems). LCHIP [6] is aimed at allowing any engineer to develop a function by using its usual Domain Specific Language (DSL) and to obtain this function running safely on a hardware platform. With an automatic development process, the B formal method will remain \u201cbehind the curtain\u201d in order to avoid expert transactions over several languages (domain specific language, B language, interactive proof). Indeed the programs developed with the CLEARSY Safety Platform are considerably simpler than metro automatic pilot, with few properties, simpler algorithms and hence with an expected excellent automatic proof ratio. The integration of third party provers/solvers is also expected to improve automatic proof. Based on our previous certification experience, the safety demonstration of a safety case does not require any specific feature for the input B model; it could be handwritten or the by-product of a translation process. Several DSLs are being connected (or planned to be) based on an Open API (Bxml).",

PLCs provide a strict, certified environment from which it is impossible to escape, requiring systems to be designed and programmed in specific ways.

B is also the central formal technology we have been using during more than 20 years for most of safety critical software development.

Audience was diverse, ranging from automation to embedded systems, mechatronics, computer science and formal methods. Results obtained are very encouraging:Teaching formal methods is eased as students are able to see their model running in and interacting with the physical world. It was the occasion to demonstrate how formal methods could be used with embedded systems and IoT. Fruitful discussions took place about how to specify/guaranty performances, what can or cannot be proved with such systems, etc.Less theoretic student profiles (computer science, mechatronics, automation) may be introduced/educated to more abstract aspects of computation. clock and combinatorial exercises were a starting point for specification enrichment and the discovery of the formal proof. Of course, the pedagogical objective in term of formalization was lower than with more formal profiles, but the students managed to understand the absence of programming error and the non-deterministic substitutions for simple modelling.The platform has demonstrated a certain robustness during all these manipulations and has been enriched with the feedback collected so far. Several electronics/software errors were detected during the preparation of the course when designing exercises, others during these exercises.The IDE GUI was improved with the automation of the code generation process and the display of a carousel showing graphically the progress of the generation. The configuration of the board was also simplified, by displaying the position of the switches on the board and by filling the configuration file with default input and output names.CLEARSY Safety Platform is used to teach in Master 26 in universities and engineering schools. Electronic documentation7 is used to structure the courses and is updated every 2 months.
