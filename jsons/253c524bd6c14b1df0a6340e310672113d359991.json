Ebola's emergence and impact are grounded in the legacy of colonialism and its creation of enduring inequalities within African nations and globally, via neoliberalism and the Washington Consensus. Recent experiences with new and emerging diseases such as SARS and various strains of HN influenzas have demonstrated the effectiveness of a coordinated local and global public health and education-oriented response to contain epidemics. To what extent is international assistance to fight Ebola strengthening local public health and medical capacity in a sustainable way, so that other emerging disease threats, which are accelerating with climate change, may be met successfully? This chapter considers the wide-ranging socio-political, medical, legal and environmental factors that have contributed to the rapid spread of Ebola, with particular emphasis on the politics of the global and public health response and the role of gender, social inequality, colonialism and racism as they relate to the mobilization and establishment of the public health infrastructure required to combat Ebola and other emerging diseases in times of climate change.",

While direct causality among factors is nearly impossible to \"prove\" in complex circumstances such as this, systems researchers rely on such triangulation and multiple evidence-based methodologies to track trends and make sense of emergent linked phenomena (Klenk and Meehan 2015; Poteete et al. 2010; Roe 1998; Moran-Ellis et al. 2006) . The literature on hazards and disasters distinguishes between the former as being a precondition (in the form of a hazardous agent or circumstance) to a disaster. A hazard is therefore a disaster waiting to happen. Hazardous conditions set the stage for a disaster to occur. In the case of Ebola, the hazardous agent is the virus itself. The virus itself does not in itself \"cause\" the outbreak, just as a hazard in itself does not \"cause\" the disaster. Rather, the social, political, cultural, economic and biophysical conditions and factors we write about in this chapter all contributed to enabling the disease to spread. Here the enablement of disease spread also, notably, extends to the outbreak response, including how these numerous factors hindered the outbreak response.",

The moot question is, will we have learnt anything? Or will it be back to business as usual?\" (PHM 2014: 7) . Market demand from consumers in the Global North fuels the resource exploitation that produces the conditions in which the Ebola epidemic emerged, and other diseases are sure to follow. Ebola has its origin in \"the unchecked exploitation of natural resources by international timber and mining companies,\" as The Observer (2014) noted in early October 2014 based on a WHO report on the disease.",

The situation is different now. The virus found its way along the human food chain towards the exploding centres of a rapidly urbanizing Africa. It reached large cities with their huge inequities, overcrowding, and underdeveloped sanitation and public health systems, and only extreme measures fuelled by moral panic have thus far (and perhaps temporarily) prevented its global spread in the same way SARS expanded across the globe in 2003.

It was also pointed out that a large pool of exposed but disease-resistant people, such as those now living in Ebola-ravaged areas of West Africa, would facilitate the development of a serum-based vaccine. Even if a vaccine is developed and tested, will it ever be widely available and accessible to all those who need it, in Africa and globally? Will this become yet another source of profits for Big Pharma? As has often been noted, there are \"tensions inherent in the socioeconomic construct that is today's pharmaceutical industry [which on one hand seeks to protect] the health of the public, but on the other it seeks to maximize profit\" (Cohen et al. 2006: 2) . There may, then, be an understandable concern that seeking a cure or antidote for Ebola might become either an opportunity for the pharmaceutical industry to use Africa as a laboratory (see Chippaux 2004) , or as another source of profits for the pharmaceutical industry, rather than promoting the enhancement of well-being. Or, as David Healy has said more dramatically, \"an incentive to chase blockbuster profits-doing so regardless of patient welfare\" (Healy 2012: 55) .",

This is, of course, not just an African story. A planetary process of urbanization is underway across vast networks of infrastructure lines, resource supply chains and human travel (Brenner 2014) . As much of this urbanization leads to massive peripheral settlement in existing and new urban centres, often in contiguity with previously mostly undisturbed natural landscapes, we can speak of \"suburban constellations\" at the heart of the process (Keil 2013; Bloch 2015; Mabin 2013; Leahy 2011) . A new landscape of risk emerges (Bloch et al. 2013) . In mining towns, sometimes physically remote and isolated but connected through global metabolisms and labour markets, we can speak of a \"feral\" form of suburbanization that confronts human and non-human nature in direct encounter (Shields 2012) . By 2030, it is expected that urbanized land on the planet will cover 1.2 million square kilometres which is twice as much as in 2000. This massive urbanization is unequally distributed across the globe, with China and Africa absorbing the lion's share of global urbanization during the next generation. We can expect significant consequences for climate change, biodiversity, etc. (Seto et al. 2012; Oxfam 2008) . In this context, Ebola, once thought of as being an isolated problem in remote rural areas, has become an urban disease affecting cities and their peripheries, where its spread tends to be rapid and seemingly random due to massive human interaction and often dense and unhygienic living conditions.",

But this also meant moving from public health governance in and by cities to global public health governance in urban society-a different challenge altogether. The Ebola crisis points further in this direction: public health institutions and procedures in cities are absolutely critical (and they often failed in the cases of SARS as well as Ebola). The time has come for a systemic and networked view of governance (and not just health governance) across the global urban expanse, the entire field of extended urbanization.",

Lack of surveillance, monitoring, andlaboratory facilities delayed early Ebola diagnoses until March 2014. The region's history, beset by political and social unrest and internal strife, adds to the complexity. Both Liberia and Sierra Leone experienced over a decade long civil conflict that decimated their already weak public health infrastructure. Health care expenditures in these countries are heavily dependent on foreign aid, tied to commitments that often prohibit investments in public infrastructure (UNDP 2011) (Table 10 .1). Furthermore, countries with a health care workforce below WHO's recommended critical threshold of 23 professionals (physicians, nurses and midwives) per 10,000 people have a lower resilience for diseases and epidemics (Afri-Dev.Info 2014; WHO 2014a) (Table 10 .1).",

An oft-neglected consideration of the disease ecology is the role that stigmatization may play in disease transmission dynamics. Stigma is a common aspect of all cultural systems and quite often used in the service of social control (Goffman 1963) . As such, despite the reality of the lethality of Ebola, the challenges that stigmatization poses for the effectiveness of outbreak response should not be trivialized. Patients may conceal the fact that they are infected, for various reasons related to stigmatization. For instance, one Liberian physician observed that \"Some patients don't tell the truth. They come to you with a different story, like 'abdominal pain'. It's because of the stigma of Ebola. They think they won't be treated and they'll be sent away\" (York 2014c ). Stigmatization in the Ebola outbreak situation is not limited to patients. Health care workers, for example, were evicted from their homes by landlords out of fear (York 2014b) . Furthermore, mobs in rural villages attacked journalists and health care workers (including those engaged in educational efforts but especially those responsible for removing the deceased). Similar to the situation with HIV/AIDS (Lewis 2006) , orphans whose parents had succumbed to Ebola also became stigmatized during the earlier stages of the outbreaks. Given that UNICEF found that as of 6 February 2015, there existed 16,000 orphans in the Ebola-affected West African countries (UN NewsCentre 2015), the potential for a tragic problem has loomed. However, a UNICEF official remarked on a positive note that: There were fears that stigma around Ebola would isolate the orphaned children, which would mean there would be thousands of abandoned children, but that has, luckily, not materialized. (UN NewsCentre 2015: n.p.). UNICEF programs provided cash support, material assistance, psycho-social support, and implemented programs to refer families for food assistance. This collectively helped to mitigate the effects of stigmatization and led to 80 % of the orphaned children being reunified with their extended families (ibid.).",

This is an especially important issue in light of the observation by the WHO Director-General that the Ebola outbreak response urgently required outside assistance (Weintraub 2014) . Western hospitals were reluctant to allow medical staff to go to West Africa, or take in Ebola-infected patients, due to worries of being labelled as the \"Ebola hospital\" in their community, or because of concerns that taking such actions would cause anxiety amongst in-house hospital staff (York 2014a) . At another level, stigmatization may be understood as coming from the conflation of race with disease. This association may be bolstered by the term \"Ebola\" itself. According to one linguist, \"Ebola\" connotes to American listeners the very idea of Africa because of its sound similarities to 'ebonics' or 'ebony' in the American vernacular (Troutman 2014) .",

In this type of colonialist discourse, \"other\" parts of the world are depicted as dangerous, particularly those with \"warm climates\" from where \"new and emerging diseases\" are seen to emanate in the twenty-first century (ibid). The effects of such neocolonial influences are seen, for example, in the way in which medical research in the Global North has benefited from blood, parasites, and viruses collected from the people of the Global South. The patented vaccines developed from such materials benefit those in the Global North (and especially the private pharmaceutical companies). As noted by Fearnley (2015) , such biomedical gains did little to help build public health capacity and infrastructure within West Africa. Dealing with such enduring forms of stigmatization is vexing because of the structural dimensions involved in the geopolitics of dependency and Global North-South relations. One way forward, however, may be seen in the recent efforts of the African Union to establish an Ebola Solidarity Fund and an African centre for disease control by mid-2015 (Anders 2015) . This initiative may have the potential to serve as an impetus to organize and institutionalize efforts against the types of stigmatization that ensue from structural dependency and power differentials embedded in neocolonialism.",

As such it has been noted that there is a \"tendency (in) the international media to attract viewers (which) has led some careless journalists to focus almost exclusively on the fear-invoking mode of death from the disease\" such as the garish images of victims \"coughing up blood\" (Wallace 2014) . Such foci are often fed by stereotypes about Africa, which are also linked to the oft-depicted image of Africa as a site of primitivism and catastrophe, the sources of which lie in colonial discourses of backwardness, exoticism and savagery. Thus, while it may be that having a fear of Ebola is a somewhat understandable response and not in itself a colonial attitude, the colonial legacy nevertheless exerts a tacit and often unrecognized influence on the fear. Specifically, it may \"fan the flames of fear\" or to put it in more technical terms, the colonial legacy may contribute to the phenomenon known as the \"social amplification of risk\", whereby peoples' perceptions of risk are unreasonably intensified (Kasperson et al. 1988 ).",

The need to engage communities in successful health initiatives is well-established (Israel et al. 1998 ) and yet this seems to have been lost in the urgency of the international response. International initiatives responding to the Ebola epidemic focused on immediate treatment responses, the development and delivery of vaccines, security and containment, and large initiatives like building hospitals. For example, Canada's contribution to the Ebola campaign was the provision of protective gear, setting up mobile labs, and the delivery of an experimental vaccine (Public Health Agency of Canada 2014). At best, these responses have been slow, expensive, difficult to coordinate, and unsustainable (Gundan 2014). At their worst, the responses met resistance by local populations, and were slow to adapt to the local contexts, thus rendering such responses ineffective and inefficient, and in the end, leaving the communities vulnerable to the next health crises.",

This lack of trust contributed to community responses ranging from hiding Ebola cases from health workers, to attacking health workers and health facilities, driven by the belief that medical staff were spreading the infection, rather than trying to contain it. Mitman (2014) argues that the colonial history between Africa and Europe is one underlying source of this mistrust, a history that began with slave traders and missionaries and continues with the current European exploitation of resources and labour and Western military involvement in a range of conflicts. In the early to mid 1900s, American medical researchers followed this path of exploitation, extracting blood, tissue and, ultimately, knowledge, on expeditions to Africa, with some amount of coercion and without benefit or explanation to local populations (Karamouzian and Hategekimana 2015) . This history of violence, invasion and exploitation has not been forgotten and could only have been reinforced by the presence of Western military personnel supporting biohazard-suited health workers (Bayntun et al. 2014) .",

Ebola's genomes have been sequenced and patented, and supportive health care can reduce its fatality rate to about 20 %, according to health researcher Laurie Garrett (CBC 2015) . But as former WHO staffer Akong Charles Ndika notes, the desperate state of most African health-care systems enables the threat posed by Ebola outbreaks to be maintained, and these inequities \"will continue in [the] future to manufacture new and re-emerging epidemics like Ebola . . . with frightening impact on a global scale\" (Ndika 2014: n.p.) .",

Health-care workers need the training and equipment to protect themselves, and basic health education for the general public is crucial to counter stigma, fear, ignorance, and superstition. Participatory education and logistics are the main challenges, not just to build hospitals and public health interventions, but also to support food security, infrastructure and governance systems, especially at local levels across the Global South. This is a huge and pressing endeavour which only the WHO can coordinate, working closely with local institutions. So the WHO must be supported-not just in words but with significant financial and material resources-in order to meet the immediate challenges of new disease outbreaks and also to build the longer-term capacity of local public health agencies so that local units can function effectively and sustainably, since future outbreaks are inevitable in today's globalized world. This applies not only to the need to increase the supply of material resources needed for the emergency response, but also the training of local staff so that they can thwart the threat themselves. Broad public participation in governance of the entire health care system is also necessary, both locally and globally, so that education and democracy go hand in hand with the development of strong health care systems. Urban public health systems should become a prime focus of WHO and international support.",

These conditions will continue to produce outbreaks of emergent diseases in times of climate change, and unless they are addressed, these outbreaks will continue to facilitate ongoing global health threats. political and physical environments.
