Enteroviruses, hepatitis A virus, rotaviruses, parvovirus-like viruses, astroviruses, caliciviruses, adenoviruses and coronaviruses may be present in human excreta. Rotaviruses are the commonest cause of acute non-bacterial gastroenteritis in infancy and childhood. In children aged 6 months to 10 years, infection by rotaviruses occurs more frequently during winter months in temperate countries. In tropical countries, there is considerable variation in the incidence of rotavirus infections among children.",

Poliomyelitis is rare in developed countries, as a result of the widespread use of oral polio vaccines, but continues to circulate in developing countries. Similarly, hepatitis A is an RNA virus and has the physicochemical characteristics of a typical enterovirus. It is transmitted from person to person by the faeco-oral route. Outbreaks may originate from viral contamination of food, water, milk and shellfish. Rotaviruses and parvovirus-like viruses cause gastroenteritis. The role of adenoviruses, astroviruses, caliciviruses and coronaviruses is not well-established. However, it is now recognized that these viruses can cause outbreaks of acute diarrhoeal disease. Enteric adenoviruses represent a separate serotype distinct from adenoviruses associated with acute respiratory infection and have been associated with acute diarrhoeal disease.",

For enterovirus assays, 0.1-1 ml can usually be assayed conveniently. The consequent dilution of viruses in faeces when discharged into receiving waters or sewage means the sample must be concentrated in order to analyse them. Various techniques are available for concentrating viruses (see Oragui and Mara, 1996).",
