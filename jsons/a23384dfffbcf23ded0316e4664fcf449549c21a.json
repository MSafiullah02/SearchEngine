Given the low success rate of NIV [ 3 ] , the controversial indications for using it in hypoxemic patients, and the risk of facilitating aerosol-borne spread of the virus and thus the danger to health care personnel, in 2009 scientifi c societies [ 9 ] made various recommendations concerning its use. One was that NIV was best applied: (1) in patients with hypercapnia-exacerbated COPD; (2) in patients whose heart diseases were accompanied by acute pulmonary edema;",

            "text": "Our experience [ 10 ] produced results that differed from those in previously published studies on the use of NIV. Ten patients (2009) (2010) were entered in the national register of virus infl uenza A(H1N1) of the Infectious Diseases Work Group of the Spanish Society of Intensive and Critical Care Medicine and Coronary Units. Seven of these patients displayed primary viral pneumonia (Table 14. 2 ). Most of the patients were young and otherwise healthy, but excess weight (40 %) and pregnancy (two patients) were notable factors. Seven patients (7/10, 70 %) underwent NIV. Two patients were intubated on admission, and one did not require mechanical ventilation. Overall mortality was 10 % (one patient). This patient had been transferred from another hospital with multi-organ failure and died 24 h after admission. A group of fi ve patients with hypoxemia were analyzed (Table 14. 2 ) especially in connection with radiological signs of hypoxemia and liver failure. All patients were treated with NIV and continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP). Orotracheal intubation was not required in any cases, and no patients died in the ICU or during the hospital stay (Tables 14.1 and 14. 2 ). The mean interval from the onset of symptoms to ICU or hospital admission was 5 days. Our tentative explanations for these highly satisfactory results are (1) the virtual absence of co-morbidity in a relatively young group of patients whose only adverse factors were excess weight and pregnancy (according to most series) [ 5 -8 ] ; (2) a low organ-failure score on the Sepsis-Related Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) scale-on which hypoxemic respiratory failure was the most salient problemcompared with the scores in other series [ 3 -5 , 7 ] ; (3) the heightened awareness of health personnel, who had received health-authority guidelines to the effect that patients with pulmonary infi ltrates and signifi cant hypoxemia were to be admitted to the ICU straightaway to receive assisted ventilation. That is why our intervals to ICU admission are similar or lower than those in previously published studies [ 3 , 4 , 7 ] given that, with one exception, the patients were not placed in wards fi rst. Similar to our results, the Argentina series [ 8 ] showed that 64 patients were treated with NIV to good effect. In that case, NIV boosted patient survival (24 % vs. 13 %, p = 0.02). These data support the idea that greater use of NIV might have reduced the need for IMV and quite possibly the mortality rate, but this is of course no more than a supposition.",

By contrast, our results [ 10 ] showed successful NIV-based treatment. We therefore recommend early NIV/CPAP treatment for at least a few hours in young patients with pneumonia-induced hypoxemia caused by type A infl uenza and where no organ failure is apparent on the SOFA scale. This does not mean that NIV is an alternative to IMV but, rather, that clinically wellplaced patients may benefi t from NIV for treating ARF. If there is no improvement or the patient suffers from organ dysfunction, it is best to proceed with orotracheal intubation to prevent death-a course of action recommended in one series [ 5 ] , where there was a higher mortality rate among patients in which NIV failed than among those who had been intubated from the outset.",
