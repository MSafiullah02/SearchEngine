In this paper, the influence of harvest time and cultivar on the chemical and nutritional composition of almonds (Prunus dulcis (Mill). D.A. Webb) were evaluated. Ten cultivars were considered, grown in the same orchard and subjected to the same agronomical regime. Almonds were collected at two different harvest times: (i) when the fruits were unripe, but already edible, and showed green and moist hull; and (ii) when the fruits were ripe, with dry brown hull. The analyses of proximate composition, fatty acid profile, total phenolic compounds, and antioxidant activity were carried out.",

CONCLUSION: Harvest time and cultivar significantly influenced the chemical and nutritional composition of almonds. Genotype strongly influenced fatty acid composition and total phenolic compounds. The changes of bioactive compounds and antioxidant activity suggest that the synthesis of antioxidants also occurs in the last stage of ripening. Unripe almonds, a valuable niche product, showed interesting nutritional value.",

            "text": "Almond (Prunus dulcis (Mill.) D.A. Webb) is one of the oldest cultivated nut trees in the world and a major nut tree crop in hot-arid countries of the Mediterranean basin, 1,2 including southern Italy and, particularly, the Apulia region. 3 Almond trees produce nutrient-dense nuts appreciated for their favorable lipid profile, and for high contents of vitamin E and polyphenols. Almonds are mostly consumed without removing the skin, but may also be blanched and peeled, then milled and processed to nondairy beverages, or confectionery delicacies. 4 The importance of almonds from an agronomical and nutritional point of view explains the presence of numerous studies related in particular to the characterization of the chemical composition of fruit, with particular emphasis on the lipid fraction. 5 The latter is characterized by the predominance of unsaturated fatty acids, such as oleic and linoleic acid, and low amounts of saturated fatty acids, as well as by the presence of antioxidant compounds. 6 Previous studies showed the influence of several factors, such as genotype and harvest year, on the antioxidant compounds of almonds. In particular, Bolling et al. 7 reported that the synthesis of the individual polyphenols was related only to the cultivar. Flavonoids, antioxidant activity, and total polyphenols instead showed a significant interaction between genotype and environmental conditions. Furthermore, almond genotype is the main cause of variability of fatty acid composition, oleic/linoleic acid ratio, and content of minor compounds (squalene and -tocopherol). 8, 9 At the same time, several studies 10, 11 reported that both lipid content and fatty acid composition were affected by growing region, pointing out the significant interaction between genotype and environment. Finally, Yada et al. 12 showed that moisture, total lipid, monounsaturated fatty acids, dietary fiber, and ash content of almonds were significantly affected by the harvest year, although this aspect was not univocally demonstrated in literature.",

Nanos et al. 1 carried out a study on two cultivars ('Texas' and 'Ferragn\u00e8s') studying the effect of both harvest time and irrigation strategies on lipid content, lipid quality and sugar content. Cherif et al. 22 studied three cultivars ('Achaak', 'Perlees', and 'Mazzetto') and reported an increase of lipid content during ripening, with significant changes in fatty acid composition. Hawker and Buttrose 23 considered two cultivars ('Chellaston' and 'Johnston Prolific') and studied the anatomy and the chemical composition of different parts of the fruit, reporting the evolution of lipid, protein, and sugar contents during ripening. Soler et al. 24 reported the changes of carbohydrates, proteins, and free amino acids during almond fruit developing, considering a single cultivar. Egea et al. 25 investigated the changes of both carbohydrate and protein content during fruit development in a single almond cultivar ('Marta'), under deficit irrigation conditions.",

All trees had the same age, and standard cultural practices were performed. Fruits were randomly collected from four different trees for each cultivar at two different harvest times, as follows: (i) T 1 (14 July 2016) corresponding to stage 'J' 33 -that is, an early stage of almond maturity, when the fruit was still unripe, with green and moist hull, but with developed cotyledons, easily separable from almond skin; (ii) T 2 (between the second half of August and the beginning of September 2016), corresponding to stage 'L' 33 -that is, ripe fruits with dry brown hull. Whole fruits collected at T 1 and T 2 were quickly stored at \u221218 \u2218 C until analysis. Then, the hull and shell were removed to obtain the kernel. Finally, almonds were finely milled by an electric grinder (B7301, Imetec, Azzano S. Paolo, Bergamo, Italy) and analyzed with three replicates. Samples at T 1 were lyophilized (De Mori, Milan, Italy) prior to milling.",

Principal component analysis was applied to define the influence of cultivar and harvest time. Table 1 reports the mean values of weight and size of kernels collected at two different harvest times: T 1 , corresponding to unripe fruits with green and moist hull, traditionally consumed fresh, and T 2 , corresponding to drier fruits collected at full ripening time. Almond size's indices at T 1 were characterized by a great variability; in particular, kernel weight ranged from 1.63 to 3.14 g. Kernel weight remarkably decreased at T 2 , due to moisture loss, with a lower variability than at T 1 (range 1.21-1.78 g). JP cv showed the highest kernel weight both at T 1 and T 2 and was affected by the highest weight loss (exceeding 43%) during ripening. The same cultivar showed the longest kernels. The cultivars under investigation were characterized by different kernel shape, varying from round (MA cv , with 0.80 and 0.76 width/length ratio at T 1 and at T 2 respectively) to elongated (JP cv , with 0.43 and 0.47 width/length ratio at T 1 and at T 2 respectively). Table 2 reports the chemical composition of almond cultivars at the two different harvest times considered. All almond cultivars showed a remarkable variability for the chemical parameters evaluated. T 1 almonds were characterized by a high moisture content (450.8 g kg \u22121 as mean value, reaching 562.0 g kg \u22121 in TE cv ), which dramatically decreased to 58.3 g kg \u22121 in T 2 almonds. The lipid content at T 1 was between 200.6 g kg \u22121 (in TE cv ) and 301.1 g kg \u22121 (in DL cv ) on fresh matter, and considerably increased at T 2 , reaching 561.7 g kg \u22121 (in FC cv ). The latter cultivar also showed the lowest protein content at both T 1 and T 2 (101.1 g kg \u22121 and 141.2 g kg \u22121 respectively).

Moreover, owing to their high moisture content, unripe almonds have a lower energy value than fully ripe fruits. However, such a high moisture level determines a very low shelf-life, limiting the consumption of unripe almonds, as fresh product, to a short period of the year. 41 Frozen storage could be effective to extend the shelf-life of this nutritionally valuable product.

Considering the effect of harvest time, eight out of ten cultivars showed significant differences between T 1 and T 2 . In particular, six cultivars showed a significant increase during ripening, probably as a consequence of the incomplete biosynthesis of phenolic compounds in unripe green almonds.

MA cv at T 2 was characterized by the lowest phenolic content, with a mean value of 391.98 mg kg \u22121 gallic acid. This unusual result was also found by\u010coli\u0107 et al., 51 who reported a total phenolic compound content of 204 mg kg \u22121 gallic acid.
