Consequently, the regulation of DC maturation should reflect these multifaceted immunological processes. In the present study, we have defined the role of particular cytokines, Toll-like receptor (TLR) ligands and T lymphocytes in the porcine monocytederived DC (MoDC). Interferon-a (IFN-a) alone was a poor inducer of MoDC maturation, but in association with tumour necrosis factor-a (TNF-a), or TLR ligands such as lipopolysaccharide and polyinosinicpolycytidylic acid I:C, an up-regulation of major histocompatibility complex II and CD80/86 expression was noted, along with reduced endocytic activity. In contrast, TNF-a alone or in combination with the TLR ligands was a poor inducer of DC maturation, but co-operated with T-lymphocytes in the presence of antigen to induce DC maturation. Natural interferon producing cells (NIPC, or plasmacytoid DCs) represent a danger-recognition system of the immune defences, and can respond to viruses not otherwise recognized as posing a danger. Indeed, MoDC did not respond to transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV), whereas NIPC produced high levels of IFN-a and TNF-a after TGEV stimulation. Moreover, supernatants from the stimulated NIPC induced maturation in MoDCs. These matured MoDCs displayed an enhanced ability to present antigen to and thus stimulate T cells. Taken together, the present work demonstrates that maturation of MoDC not only results from TLR signalling, but can require co-operation with various cell types -principally NIPC and activated T cells -which would reflect the particular immunological situation.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Abstract"}], "body_text": [{"text": "Dendritic cells (DC) are professional antigen-presenting cells (APC) specialized in antigen capture, migration to secondary lymphoid organs and T-cell priming. DC maturation is essential for the generation of effective immune responses against most pathogens. This process can be induced by proinflammatory cytokines, microbial products, or cross-linking of CD40 molecules. [1] [2] [3] Mature DCs are most efficient at expressing peptide-major histocom-patibility complexes (MHCs) on their surfaces to activate T cells, for which the high expression levels of MHC and costimulatory molecules -such as CD80, CD86 and CD40 -on the DC is essential.

For example, the stimulation of DC by bacterial or fungal PAMPs can result in autoimmune processes or immune responses against relatively harmless gut flora and food antigen. It can therefore be of benefit to the immune system that DCs involved in antigen presentation do not express all Toll-like receptors (TLR)s to recognize all PAMPS. With human immune defences, mainly the natural interferon producing cells (NIPC, or plasmacytoid DC) express TLR7 and TLR9, important receptors for microbial nucleic acid. 4 Of course, a result of this differential TLR expression may be that myeloid DC might not be fully equipped to recognize certain viruses.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 819, "end": 820, "text": "4", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Introduction"}, {"text": "Both human and porcine DC closely resemble each other, making the porcine system a valuable model for studies such as evaluation of vaccine adjuvants and identification of responsiveness to pathogens.

These are known to induce pro-inflammatory cytokines and the maturation of DC required for initiation of specific immune responses. An imbalanced trigger of these responses has been associated with tolerance to antigens, or alternatively with autoimmune diseases. Consequently, DC maturation should be subject to a complex regulation, to avoid such processes. Knowledge of the components involved, and their role in DC matur- ation, is required for both an understanding of disease pathogenesis and the development of improved immunotherapies with appropriate targeting. With these goals in mind, the present work sought to characterize the cellular interactions at play during the regulation of DC maturation in an in vitro model using porcine MoDC. Although the TLR3 ligand pIC, and the TLR4 ligand LPS have been reported to activated MoDC 8, 9, 19 the present results demonstrate that the individual application of IFN-a, TNF-a, pIC, and LPS have only a relatively weak capacity to induce DC maturation. In contrast, IFN-a together with TNF-a, as well as IFN-a together with pIC or LPS, were particularly effective at inducing DC maturation.

The refractory behaviour of porcine MoDC noted in response to the TLR ligands LPS and pIC in the present manuscript was surprising considering the literature on mouse and human DC, and could represent an in vitro phenomenon found with this type of culture.

The second signal would be delivered during the interaction of the DC with the T lymphocytes, resulting particularly in further up-regulation of the MHC II molecules on the DC.

In fact, the TNF-a alone was superior in this context. It should be stressed that the model used a secondary immune response, and it can be expected that the process of 'terminal' maturation would be dependent on the level of T-cell activation.

In this situation their maturation can only occur indirectly through cytokines produced by other cell types, in particular NIPC. When exposed to viruses such as TGEV, as well as to CpG-ODN type A, these cells are particularly potent producers of IFN-a and TNF-a, 11 representing the cytokine cocktail effective at inducing the first stage of DC maturation. Furthermore, porcine and human myeloid DCs do not produce IFN-a in response to CpG type A motifs. Nevertheless, it has been recently described that porcine MoDC express some levels of TLR9 enabling them to respond to a CpG in terms of an up-regulation of MHC II and CD80/86 as well as mRNA of certain TLRs, IL-12 p35 and IFN-c. 8 However, in our hands, no response of MoDC in terms of the induction of maturation and the induction of TNF-a/IFN-a protein was detected. 11 Again, this discrepancy might have been caused by different experimental procedures, readouts, source of cells or CpG sequence used.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 622, "end": 624, "text": "11", "ref_id": "BIBREF10"}, {"start": 1044, "end": 1045, "text": "8", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}, {"start": 1184, "end": 1186, "text": "11", "ref_id": "BIBREF10"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "Based on the present studies and relating to what as been described for human NIPC 21 it is in fact the NIPC which play a major role in responding to viral and ODN stimuli by producing the cytokine response required for myeloid DC maturation. 10, 11 Stimulation of the NIPC by CpG-ODN Type A did induce levels of IFN-a/TNF-a which resulted in an indirect maturation of MoDCs. The importance of this functional link between the NIPC and myeloid DC has recently been reported by Fonteneau et al. 29 demonstrating that human immunodeficiency virus-activated plasmacytoid DCs (NIPC) mediate an indirect maturation of CD11c + DCs (myeloid DCs). Together, these two sets of observations confirm the concept that NIPC represent a crucial cell type in the immune system recognizing certain viruses and nucleic acid sequences to produce high levels of IFNa and TNF-a, which promote myeloid DC maturation.
