However, concerning these viruses, COVID-19 presents a higher degree of uncertainty in the scale and geographical scope of the outbreak within and outside China. SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV-based propagation analysis and prediction models may be no longer suitable in the fight against the COVID-19 pneumonia. Therefore, it is very urgent to use the latest data to establish an efficient and highly suitable epidemic analysis and prediction model according to the actual situation, and then to give reliable epidemic predictions. This work could provide an important reference for the government to formulate emergency macroeconomic decisions and medical resources allocation. Moreover, the significance is also of great reference value for the country's deployment and adjustment of economic activities throughout the year 2020.",

Especially, with the implementation of the Chinese government's multiple epidemic control policies, the control of nationwide epidemic has become obvious. However, the medical supplies in Hubei will still affect the implementation of national policies. In this study, the models driven by data are used to describe the current data of the epidemic, to predict the ongoing trend, and to estimate the outbreak size of the COVID-19 in both Hubei and other areas in mainland China. This data-driven study could present another prediction to the epidemic compared with the susceptible-infectiousrecovered (SIR) or SEIR model.",

I, which are also graphically shown in Fig. 1\u223c Fig. 3 , in which China is used to denote the mainland China, and \"Other\" mainland China other than Hubei province. Fig. 1 shows the number of total and daily suspected and confirmed cases in mainland China, Hubei, and China other than Hubei. The accumulated number of suspected cases reaches the maximum on the 19th day (Feb. 8), and then drops rapidly. Fig. 2 displays the number of total and daily deaths caused by this epidemic in mainland China, Hubei, and China other than Hubei. Notice the data of the deaths caused by the epidemic in China (black) almost coincides with that in Hubei (red). Almost all the cases of deaths (1068/1113, 96%, until Feb. 11, 2020) locates in Hubei province. This also motivates us to process the data in Hubei separately with that in China other than Hubei.",

Another limitation is that although we process separately the data of Hubei and China other than Hubei, this is still quite rough for the considerable differences among cities within Hubei province. Also, as a data-driven forecast study, the seasonality of COVID-19 transmission, the effects of the quarantine, the limitations on population transportation, and other specific reasons that may affect the spread of the epidemic, are not explicitly included in the study.

After this work has been written, the Hubei reported 14840 confirmed infections (including 13332 clinically diagnosed cases) on Feb. 12, 2020, which is almost 9 times greater than the data of the previous day. This huge fluctuation of the infections is due to the changing of diagnostic criteria in Hubei. And we believe this clinical criteria taken by Hubei would play an active and important role in controlling the outbreak.In order to continue this forecasting research, we consider these 13332 clinically diagnosed infections follow the same statistical distribution as these cases confirmed by nucleic acid detection. Then the updated prediction of final accumulated infections would be 1.4 times larger than before, namely, totally there would be 54600 infections in Hubei. However, this would overestimate the real COVID-19 infections, since part of the clinically diagnosed cases would be excluded by the nucleic acid detection later.",
