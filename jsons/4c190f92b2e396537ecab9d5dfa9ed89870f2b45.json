Using a standard microarray spotter, we print carbohydrate antigens directly on the nitrocellulose-coated bioarray substrates. Because these substrates support noncovalent immobilization of many spotted antigens, in general no chemical modification of the antigen is needed for microarray production. Thus, this bioarray platform is technically simple and applicable for high-throughput construction of carbohydrate antigen microarrays. A number of nitrocellulose-coated glass slides with different technical characteristics are commercially available. Given the structural diversity of carbohydrate antigens, examining each antigen preparation to determine the efficacy of its immobilization in a given type of substrate and the surface display of the desired glycoepitopes in a microarray assay is essential.",

They may be specifically or selectively recognizable by either soluble or membranebound cellular proteins. In the higher eukaryotic species, the expression of cellular glycoconjugates, and especially their complex carbohydrate structures, is frequently cell type or tissue specific. In microbes, many sugar chains, including those displayed on the surface of a microbial cell and those secreted outside it, have been recognized as \"signatures\" of specific pathogens. Exploring the biological information content of sugar chains is a current focus of glycomics research.",

These carbohydrate microarrays are all solid-phase binding assays for carbohydrates and their interaction with other biological molecules. In spite of their technological differences, they share a number of common characteristics and technical advantages. First, they have the capacity to display a large panel of carbohydrates in a limited chip space. Second, the amount needed to spot each carbohydrate is drastically smaller than that required for a conventional molecular or immunological assay. Third, the microarray-based assays have higher detection sensitivity than most conventional molecular and immunological assays; this increased sensitivity is due to the fact that the binding of a molecule in solution phase to an immobilized microspot of ligand in the solid phase minimally reduces the molar concentration of the molecule in solution (14) . Therefore, it is much easier to have a binding equilibrium take place in a microarray assay and result in a high sensitivity.",

Technically, we make the use of complementary methods to diversify and extend the repertoires of glycoepitopes in bioarray substrates. It is important to note that carbohydrate microarrays constructed by various methods may differ in their technical features and suitability for a given practical application. For example, they may differ in the detection specificity. The carbohydrate antigen microarray discussed here would be antigen specific but not epitope specific, if the native carbohydrate antigens were spotted. This is owing to the fact that many carbohydrate antigens, such as polysaccharides, glycoproteins, and glycolipids, display more than one antigenic determinant, including glyco-and nonglycoepitopes. Examining the finer details of the binding properties would require the use of microarrays of pure saccharide sequences. The mono-and oligosaccharide array-based binding assays, such as sister chapters in this book, may be employed, in combination with saccharide competition assays, to decipher precise saccharide components of a specific antigenic determinant or glycoepitope (6, 11, 13) .",

In addition to printing carbohydrate microarrays, this platform is also applicable for producing protein microarrays (15) . As with carbohydrate microarrays, there is no need to chemically conjugate a protein for its surface immobilization. However, it is recommended that each antigen preparation be tested on chip substrate for the efficacy of immobilization and expression of antigenic determinants.",
