The abstracts of the identified studies were reviewed independently by both authors. Differences were resolved through discussion, until a consensus was reached. The abstract review resulted in the exclusion of 28 records. Full-text retrieval and review were conducted for the remaining 14 articles. Two studies were then eliminated based upon the above selection criteria (Figure 1\n). The percentage agreement on the inclusion between the two reviewers was 86%, with Cohen's kappa statistic \u03ba = 0.72 (95% confidence interval (95% CI) 0.58\u20130.85).

The primary outcome measure was the prevalence of comorbidities in severe MERS-CoV cases. Meta-analysis of proportions (and 95% CI) was calculated for the clinical symptoms and for each of the selected comorbidities using OpenMeta Analyst version 10.10 (www.cebm.brown.edu/open_meta), a free, cross-platform, open-source program. A binary random-effects model was used, since it was assumed that the relationship between the comorbidities and severe MERS-CoV varies across populations. The presence of heterogeneity among the identified studies (Cochran's Q) and the extent of heterogeneity (I\n2 index) were examined, as described previously.13 Forest plots were used to illustrate the prevalence of comorbidities in severe MERS-CoV from the selected studies and to inspect the heterogeneity of the individual findings.",

            "text": "Metabolic syndrome-related conditions such as diabetes, hypertension, CAD/CVD, and obesity, together with their predisposing conditions, can be linked etiologically to the pathogenesis of MERS-CoV. These disorders are known to down-regulate key mediators of the host innate immune response to pathogenesis. For example, diabetes, hyperglycemia, and insulinopenia attenuate the synthesis of proinflammatory cytokines such as interferon gamma (IFN-\u03b3) and interleukins (ILs) and their downstream acute phase reactants, to functionally impair the innate and humoral immune systems of the host.20 Chronic diseases share several common features with infectious disorders and their complications, such as endothelial dysfunction, the proinflammatory state, and the attenuation of the innate immune response.21, 22, 23 The cytokine overload related to the Th1 to Th2 shift in severe viral infection when accompanied by the cytokine synthesis that arises from metabolic diseases, can be detrimental to the endothelium and lead to a range of subsequent complications.22 The potential role of altered innate immunity and the shift in the Th1 (microbicidal action of IFN-\u03b3) to Th2 (anti-inflammatory IL-4, -5, -10, and -13) response in linking metabolic diseases to severe viral presentation, may also be supported by the high prevalence of allergy observed in fatal viral infections24 and the eosinophilic responses in other infections.25 Furthermore, metabolic disorders impair macrophage and lymphocyte functions with a subsequent status of reduced immune response,26 which may render individuals more susceptible to infectious disease complications. In support, levels of glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) \u22659%, for example, have been linked to a 60% increased risk of pneumonia-related severity and hospitalization.27 Furthermore, the OR for severe MERS-CoV has been reported to range from 7.2 to 15.7 in diabetic subjects.2, 9, 10, 11\n",

Previous studies have reported diabetes prevalence of up to 34.9% among the countries of the Arabian Peninsula, with higher rates in men.28 The prevalence of metabolic disorders such as impaired glucose tolerance (IGT, a pre-diabetic status) in this region has been estimated at 7.8%.29 Although some of the chronic disease trends in this region are largely consistent with global patterns, some conditions are more prominent causes of premature death and disability than they are worldwide, e.g., CVD and depression.30 These observations may imply that the high frequency of chronic diseases in severe MERS-CoV simply reflects their elevated prevalence in the Middle East region.",

The reports identified showed a wide among-studies variance in the proportion of diabetes, hypertension, CAD/CVD, and obesity (Figure 2), which may have contributed to the observed significant heterogeneity. Additional sources of heterogeneity may relate to the large variation among studies in the sample size (5 to 261 patients) and the different study designs. These factors may levy some limitations on the estimated contribution of chronic diseases to severe MERS-CoV cases and render the results as a guide to generate more accurate estimates for national or international intervention strategies for infectious diseases in subjects with chronic disorders. Further investigations are warranted to examine the nature and extent of coexistence between MERS-CoV severity and non-communicable diseases.",

Public health practices to prevent MERS-CoV and its related complications could be suggested to emulate those proposed previously for seasonal influenza. During the 1957\u201358 pandemic and in response to substantial morbidity and mortality, the US Surgeon General recommended annual influenza vaccination for individuals with chronic debilitating disease, people aged \u226565 years, and pregnant women.31 For these high-risk groups, the first recommendation for national universal seasonal influenza vaccination was established in 2010 by the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP).32 A recent systematic review demonstrated that influenza vaccination can prevent all-cause hospitalization in infected subjects.33 For example, in diabetic patients and people aged \u226565 years, vaccination prevented all-cause hospitalization with a vaccine effectiveness of 58% and 45%, respectively.33 Furthermore, a significant protective effect of influenza vaccine was noted on intensive care unit admission (vaccine effectiveness of 81%), all-cause mortality (32%), cardiac death (16%), and hospitalization due to pneumonia (14%).34 However, given the quality of the body of evidence, it was proposed that these observations should be considered with caution.33, 34 Indeed, despite numerous recommendations from public health organizations across the world (US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), WHO, etc.) to administer respiratory disease vaccines annually (e.g., influenza), the vaccination rates in subjects with chronic diseases remains low. The current level of vaccination falls short of the 2010 health objectives call in elderly (90%) and younger (60%) individuals with co-existing risk factors (e.g., diabetes).",
