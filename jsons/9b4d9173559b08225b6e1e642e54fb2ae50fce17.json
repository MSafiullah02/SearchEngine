After induction of expression, the expected 32-kDa protein was identified by Western immunoblotting with specific rabbit anti-idiotype antibodies. The scFv fragments were purified from soluble cytoplasmic preparations by affinity chromatography on nickel agarose, which was possible with an N-terminal but not with a C-terminal histidine tag. Purified scFv fragments retained the antigen-binding properties of the parental antibody, could inhibit its binding to viral antigens with apparently higher efficiency than monovalent antigen-binding (Fab) fragments, but neutralized viral infectivity with lower efficiency (about sevenfold at a molar level). To evaluate the usefulness of these smaller and less immunogenic molecules in the treatment of viral diseases, mice were treated with purified recombinant scFv fragments and challenged with a lethal viral dose. A small delay in mortality was observed for the scFv-treated animals. Therefore, even though the scFv could neutralize viral infectivity in vitro, the same quantity of fragments that partially protected mice in the form of Fab only slightly delayed virus-induced lethality when injected as scFv fragments, probably because of a much faster in vivo clearance: the biologic half-life was estimated to be about 6 min. Since a scFv derived from a highly neutralizing and protective mAb is only marginally effective in the passive protection of mice from lethal viral infection, the use of such reagents for viral immunotherapy will require strategies to overcome stability limitations.",

We subcloned the scFv into the PET-1 6b vector which expresses the histidine tag at the N-terminal end of the protein.

Indeed, 50 % inhibition of binding of the parental antibody to viral antigen was achieved with only 0.6 pg of scFv whereas 10 pg of Fab fragments only inhibited 42 % of binding [9]. However, this did not correlate with a better neutralization activity of the SCFV, with molar titers about sevenfold lower than these of Fab fragments. Even with an apparent higher affinity than Fab fragments, the scFv was less effective in the passive protection of animals against lethal viral infection. This was most likely due to a shorter half-life, which we measured to be about 55-fold shorter (6 min The very fast blood clearance of scFv fragments represents an advantage for some clinical uses such as tumor immunotargeting for diagnosis or treatment of cancer but represents a major limitation for their utilization in viral immunotherapy.

These authors also concluded that a short half-life of the antibody fragments hampered passive protection of mice against lethal infection and showed that protection required pre-incubation of the challenge virus with antibody fragments. This confirms that monovalent antibody fragments may be able to passively protect against viral infections and emphasize the need to engineer more stable molecules before clinical uses can be envisaged.",

The rapid in vivo blood clearance of scFv is well documented, with reported half-lives ranging from 2.4 to 32 min [35-391, as compared to 5.5 h for Fab fragments of mAb 7-10A [9]. Although large quantities of scFv did not achieve complete protection of a proportion of treated mice, as could Fab fragments, the short delay in mortality suggests that the scFv fragments did have a limited protective effect on viral infection. It is likely that repeated injections of even larger doses of scFv fragments or a less overwhelming viral challenge would reproduce the passive protection achieved with Fab fragments [9].",
