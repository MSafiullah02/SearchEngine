The ubiquitin\u2013proteasome system is responsible for much of the regulated proteolysis in the cell, as well as many other regulatory processes such as transcriptional regulation, DNA damage, quality control, trafficking, inflammation, and autophagy. Ubiquitin is a small 76-amino acid protein that can be reversibly attached to protein substrates. Several ubiquitin-like proteins (Ubls) have also been identified including ISG15, NEDD8, and SUMO, which share a characteristic three-dimensional fold with ubiquitin but are otherwise distinct. The ubiquitin\u2013proteasome system has multiple essential biological roles, and thus its function and dysfunction, are important factors in various human diseases, including cancer, infection, inflammation, and neurodegeneration [1\u20134].",

            "text": "Ubiquitylation of substrate proteins first involves an ATP-dependant activation of the ubiquitin polypeptide by the activating enzyme E1. Activation involves covalent linkage between the carboxy terminus of ubiquitin and a cysteine residue present on the E1, forming a thioester bond. The activated ubiquitin is then transferred to an E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme forming a thioester linkage. In the final step, an E3 ligase transfers the ubiquitin from the E2 to the substrate protein. The majority of E3 ligases are classified as RING finger E3s and act by bringing the substrate and E2 enzyme in close proximity. The RING finger E3s directly transfer ubiquitin from the E2 to the substrate. The HECT domain E3s act by forming an intermediate thioester linkage with ubiquitin before transfer to the substrate (reviewed in [5]). More recently, a third class of E3 ligases with an intermediate mechanism of action has been identified. The RING-in-between-RING (RBR) E3s are an unusual family of ubiquitin E3-ligases composed of a dozen proteins. Their activities are autoinhibited, causing a requirement for activation by protein\u2013protein interactions or posttranslational modifications. They catalyze ubiquitin conjugation by a concerted RING/HECT-like mechanism in which the RING1 domain facilitates E2-discharge to directly form a thioester intermediate with a cysteine in RING2. This short-lived, HECT-like intermediate then modifies the target [6, 7].",

Polyubiquitin chains can be formed using the N-terminus (linear) or any of the seven internal lysine residues found in ubiquitin, and these various chain topologies lead to different functional outcomes. Of the most well studied linkages, K63-linked polyubiquitin chains are often involved in nonproteolytic signal transduction while K48-linked chains generally target substrates for proteasomal degradation. A number of additional linkages such as Met1, K6, K11, K27, K29, and K33 have been identified and their nondegradative cellular signaling roles are still subject to a number of investigations. The complexity of ubiquitin chain signaling is further enhanced by the existence of mixed-lineage chains [8, 9].",

Proteins that have been appropriately polyubiquitylated are recognized and degraded by the 26S macromolecular proteasome complex [11]. The 26S complex consists of a 20S catalytic core particle that is capped at both ends by 19S regulatory particles. The 19S regulatory particle can be further subdivided into lid and base components. Following recruitment to the proteasome, polyubiquitylated proteins undergo deubiquitylation and unfolding. The removal of ubiquitin is accomplished by deubiquitylating enzymes (DUBs) associated with the 19S lid. Ubiquitin polypeptides that are removed from substrate proteins can be directly recycled by the cell. The 19S base component plays a key role in the unfolding of the substrate protein and delivery of the deubiquitylated, unfolded protein into the 20S catalytic core particle. The 20S consists of four layers of ring-like structures [12]. The outer rings are composed of seven \u03b1 subunits with the inner rings composed of seven \u03b2 subunits. The \u03b21 subunits exhibit caspase-like activity, the \u03b22 subunits trypsin-like activity, and \u03b25 subunits chymotrypsin-like activity, collectively degrading proteins into short oligopeptides as well as recycling amino acids [5, 13].",

Ubiquitylation is a reversible process carried out by the opposing activities of ubiquitin ligases and DUBs. The human genome encodes approximately 100 DUBs [14\u201316]. Of the five families of DUBs, four ( UCH, USP, MJD, and OTU) belong to the cysteine peptidase class, while one (JAMM) belongs to the metallopeptidase class. As DUBs have been shown to play critical roles in many pathological processes, particularly cancer, infectious disease, and neurodegeneration, they have begun to attract significant attention from the pharmaceutical industry [17\u201320]. Unlike most posttranslational modifications, ubiquitin is able to form polymeric chains [21]: the ubiquitin linkage in the chain as well as the length of the chain will impact on the fate of the protein modified by the polymer of ubiquitin [9, 22].",

A number of conceptual and technological obstacles need to be overcome in order to progress genuine DUB therapies. A major challenge in characterization of DUB inhibitors is the development of high throughput assays monitoring \u201con-target\u201d inhibition in cells and in vivo. Monitoring DUB target engagement by small molecule inhibitors in vivo has a number of implications. Firstly, as a biomarker readout of inhibition and for understanding the physiological implication of inhibiting a class of enzymes for which there is usually no known unique ubiquitylated substrate. Secondly, for assessment of the selectivity of compounds as well as understanding the mechanism of action of the inhibition, including duration, reversibility, and pharmacodynamic parameters.",

ABPs are usually composed of a reactive electrophile, to covalently modify an active-site residue, and a reporter group to allow detection of the labeled enzyme [28], see Fig. 1a, b. Activity probes have been designed for a number of enzyme classes such as serine hydrolases [29], metalloproteases [30, 31], proteasomes [32], and oxidoreductases [33]. Epitope-tagged ubiquitin and ubiquitin-like derivatives have been utilized in a variety of assays to identify or monitor active DUBs in biological samples [34, 35] (Fig. 1c). Ubiquitin ABPs have been instrumental in the identification of a number of new DUBs [36] including a novel class of DUBs: OTUs [37]. Unlike other proteolytic enzymes, for optimal recognition, DUBs require not only an electrophilic trap but also a very large portion of ubiquitin or chains of ubiquitin for binding and recognition in the enzyme active site: truncated portions of ubiquitin are usually not sufficient to trap DUBs. In addition, the isopeptide nature of the covalent linkage of ubiquitin to the target protein imposes a restricted number of choices of electrophilic warheads. Monitoring the activity of endogenous enzymes such as DUBs in their native, full-length status as well as under all possible naturally occurring posttranslational modifications or interference/allosteric regulation from binding partners is a major advantage of ABPs. The irreversible covalent nature of ABPs toward their enzyme targets has a number of advantages when compared to many other analytical technologies that rely on weak, naturally transient and difficult to capture interactions between an enzyme and its substrate. Various warheads (Fig. 2) have been employed including alkyl halides (chloroethyl, bromoethyl, bromopropyl), Michael acceptors ( vinyl methyl ester (VME), vinyl methyl sulfone (VMS), vinyl phenyl sulfone, vinyl cyanide) and more recently propargyl (PA) [36, 38, 39].\n\n",

The identity of each labeled band was verified using individual yeast DUB mutant strains. The initial version of the ubiquitin vinyl sulfone probe was labeled with iodine125and allowed for detection of a number of DUBs in mouse tissues as well as in mouse cell lysates. In the same study, Borodovsky et al. described the use of unlabeled ubiquitin vinyl sulfone to detect a specific DUB by monitoring a shift in the apparent molecular weight in SDS-PAGE followed by immunoblotting: USP7 was labeled efficiently in mammalian cell lysates. Finally, the authors were also able to identify USP14 as a novel DUB associated with the proteasome thanks to the use of ubiquitin vinyl sulfone in fractionation and immune-purification assays.",

Dramatic differences in the levels of active DUBs in cell lines derived from various tissues as well as in primary tissues has been observed [45]. For a small number of DUBs, the activity as monitored by activity probe binding can be correlated with the malignant status of the cell line or tissue, suggesting a possible therapeutic window for DUB inhibitors [45].

Initial global characterization of the ubiquitin-modified proteome has been made possible in proteomic studies taking advantage of a monoclonal antibody that recognizes (di-Gly)-containing isopeptides following trypsin digestion of complex cellular lysates [53, 54]. In the Ubiquitin-AQUA approach, synthetic isotopically labeled internal standard peptides are used to quantify branched peptides and the branched -GG signature peptides generated by trypsin digestion of ubiquitin signals [55]. Proteomic studies looking at DUB interaction partners have also generated a great deal of information about their substrates, regulation, and function [56]. Additional studies have evaluated the functional role of DUBs using RNAi libraries [57, 58] or GFP-DUB fusions [59, 60], and have linked DUBs to specific cellular pathways. While such studies are very informative and have generated a wealth of data on the biological roles of DUBs, they provide only limited information regarding the dynamic activity profile of DUBs, and are not able to distinguish the catalytic state (active versus inactive) of DUBs. As the cellular activity of DUBs can be controlled by multiple factors including protein interactions [61], stoichiometric changes to the structure of the protein [62, 63], and posttranslational modifications [64, 65], the advantage of activity probes is their specific reactivity with catalytically active DUBs.",

A chemical activity-based proteomic approach using HA-tagged ubiquitin labeled with electrophilic warheads (HA-UbBr2 or HA-Ub-VME) was undertaken to characterize the selectivity of two USP7 inhibitors either in immunoblots or by quantitative mass spectrometry following treatment of cells or cell lysates with compounds [66]. An independent study using another USP7 inhibitor displaying selectivity in a panel of biochemical DUB assays, was also subjected to cellular selectivity profiling using HA-Ub-VMS followed by immunoblotting [24]. In a more targeted approach, an active-site ubiquitin probe (HA-Ub-VMS) has been used to demonstrate that USP14/UCHL5 inhibition by a small molecule (b-AP15) inhibits the 19S proteasome in a reconstituted biochemical assay. A similar probe approach was also used to demonstrate that b-AP15 is not a general inhibitor of DUBs in a cell lysate probed with an anti-HA antibody detecting the conjugated ubiquitin species [67]. While the studies mentioned above are paving the way for elucidating DUB selectivity profiles in a cellular context, coverage of the \u201c DUBome\u201d is still limited. Technological improvements are still required to increase sensitivity and accurately monitor DUBs in a given cell or tissue experiment.",

Indeed, it is possible to determine the dynamic nature of DUB inhibitors by using ABPs to monitor the reversibility or the duration of DUB inhibition. Furthermore, most of the work so far on DUBs using ABPs has been restricted to cellular studies. Recent progress in developing DUB inhibitors with in vivo preclinical potential is currently driving the tools for pharmacodynamic as well as mode-of-action understanding of DUB inhibitors in vivo. Activity probes based on selective inhibitors of peptidases have already been developed such as probes targeting proteasomes [68], cathepsins [69] or caspases [70] and are proving their usefulness for in vivo imaging studies as well as for diagnostic purposes [71].",

A similar approach has been described using a different family of proteins: glycine fluoromethylketones, which serve as probes to selectively target SENPs [77]. A more conventional derivatization of the carboxy-terminal end of Ubls with electrophilic warheads has also been pursued and a general derivatization procedure to produce any Ubl domain chemically activated at its C-terminus by formation of a thiol ester. Reaction of the thiol with a nucleophile produces the desired derivatives taking advantage of the intein fusion technology [78]. There is no technical challenges preventing the development of fully synthetic Ubl ABPs and indeed, a number of such reagents are already commercially available from various sources.",

However, incorporation of electrophilic warheads into polyubiquitin chains remains problematic. An intermediate approach to the generation of polyubiquitin ABPs was elaborated on the basis of the synthesis of branched-peptides incorporating an isopeptide-linked ubiquitin and an electrophilic warhead [84]. In addition, the synthesis and characterization of K48- or K63-linked di-ubiquitin probes bearing dehydroalanine as a warhead near the isopeptide bond has been described [85]. Finally, ABPs engineered for di-ubiquitin chains incorporating the 8 known ubiquitin linkages have been successful and now allow DUB ubiquitin-linkage specificity in a cellular context to be addressed[86\u201388]. Structural studies of DUBs with di-ubiquitin have demonstrated that in addition to the peptide flanking the ubiquitylated residues, more extensive interactions between DUBs and the proximal ubiquitin in the chain also contribute to the recognition by DUBs. Probing DUB selectivity with the latest generation of probes not only generates a distinct pattern from that obtained using mono-ubiquitin ABPs, but also suggests that the promiscuity of some DUBs for their substrates is probably much less pronounced than initially anticipated.",

In certain cases, it is quite clear that unique substrates do not exist: e.g., USP14 or UCHL5 are DUBs that indiscriminately recognize any ubiquitylated substrates which is targeted to the proteasome [93]. Ubiquitin ABPs can play a critical role as tools to monitor the dynamics of the activation or inhibition of DUBs under specific physiological or pharmacological pathway alterations. The problem is especially acute for the monitoring of DUB activity upon inhibition with specific inhibitors: the pharmaceutical development of DUB inhibitors requires a good understanding of the pharmacokinetic modulation of the target upon treatment with compounds. The development of ABPs for proteomic evaluation of target engagement is currently being investigated by a number of groups. In addition, higher throughput ABP-based strategies are also under development for the determination of DUB target engagement in cellular contexts as well as in tissues or eventually for clinical sample evaluation (Fig. 3).\n",

Indeed, the complexity of the recognition site of DUBs, which requires the binding of full-length ubiquitin in the catalytic site as well as the challenges in the characterization of potent and selective DUB inhibitors, has hindered production of ABPs for DUBs. However, following on from the ground-breaking evolution of cell-permeable and in vivo-compatible activity-based imaging probes developed for other proteases such as caspases or cathepsins [69, 70], the next generation of probes for DUBs will certainly be agents that enable direct visualization and quantification of DUB activity in vivo. Such noninvasive agents have great potential for early diagnosis as well as pharmacodynamic evaluation of DUB inhibition in preclinical as well as clinical settings. One attractive avenue to explore for the development of selective DUB activity probes is based on the design of copper-catalyzed click-labeled DUB inhibitors with quenchable or nonfluorescent labels [94]. Click-labeled ABPs allows for selective labeling, visualization, and enrichment of active enzymes in a complex proteome. Another approach will likely be based on the generation of noninvasive substrate probes that do not bind covalently to the enzyme. The advantage of this approach is based on the theoretically higher signal that can be generated, in contrast to covalent activity probes which are limited by the stoichiometric labeling of the enzyme (the signal being proportional to the amount of enzyme in various tissues). So far a very limited number of reporter substrates are available, none being cell permeable, or suitable for in vivo applications. Again, noninvasive permeable substrates will likely be derived from selective inhibitors of individual DUBs or knowledge around selectively ubiquitylated sites on DUB substrates. Probably one of the most promising avenues for developing cell- and tissue-permeable selective ubiquitin ABPs for DUBs will rely on the modification of selective small molecule inhibitors of DUBs. Similar approaches have already achieved some preliminary success for other enzymes of the UPS such as E1 enzymes [95] and proteasome probes [96]. The limiting step in developing such probes for DUBs is currently a lack of potent, specific and selective DUB inhibitors available, however, the community is successfully designing novel generations of selective DUB inhibitors.",

            "text": "Protein ubiquitylation is critical for the control of protein half-life, localization, and function. Deregulation of this process is a causative factor of many diseases. The development of ABPs has allowed for major advancement in the identification and characterization of cysteine DUBs. Significant progress has been made in terms of probe design and preparation. For example, five papers have been published in the past 3 years describing di-ubiquitin ABPs, underscoring the importance of these tools for DUB research. The JAMM family remains difficult to target using ABPs due to the catalytic mechanism which does not involve a covalent DUB-substrate intermediate. Hopefully new approaches and novel probe designs will yield better tools to investigate this class of metalloproteases. ABPs will ultimately shed light on the function and relevance of DUBs involved in various chain-specific ubiquitin signaling, and will continue to advance our knowledge of DUB regulation and function in a cellular context. Furthermore, ABPs will aid the development and characterization of DUB inhibitors, allowing the monitoring of target engagement as well as selectivity in vivo. Finally, while ubiquitin ABPs have not yet been as broadly used as one might expect to monitor DUBs in developmental or pathological evaluations, they can provide a unique dynamic assessment of the activity of DUBs, and will undoubtedly become a more familiar option for many researchers.",
