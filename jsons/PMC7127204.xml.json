Flavonoids and alkaloids are the two kinds of major components of S. tonkinensis. Pharmacological studies reported that the flavonoids in S. tonkinensis possessed significant bioactivities, such as antioxidant, anticancer, anti-gastric ulcer, and inhibiting gastric acid secretion effects [[3], [4], [5], [6]]. The alkaloids of S. tonkinensis exhibited antiviral activity against hepatitis B virus (HBV), influenza virus A/Hanfang/359/95 (H3N2) and coxsackie virus B3 (CVB3) [7,8].",

It\u2019s notable that, traditional Chinese medicine commonly had beneficial effects on infectious diseases by inhibiting inflammation and reducing fever, and the mechanism is probably related to inhibiting excessive activation of the complement system in vivo [14,15]. Hence, the discovery and application of complement inhibitors should become a potential therapeutic strategy for the treatment of these infectious diseases.",

However, their clinical applications are completely different [28,29]. S. tonkinensis is frequently used internally to treat acute throat infections while S. flavescens is mostly used externally for the treatment of skin diseases, such as eczema and dermatitis [30]. And their different flavonoid constituents could serve as the qualitative markers for identification of S. tonkinensis and S. flavescens. S. flavescens roots barely contain flavonoid glycosides but mainly contain isoprenylated flavonoids (Fig. S8), which are inactive on the complement system and unable to be metabolized by intestinal bacteria. As expected, almost no change was detected when the flavonoids of S. flavescens were incubated with human intestinal bacteria, except trifolirhizin (1) metabolized to maackiain (1\u2032) (Fig. S9, Table S3). These results further explain the different effects and administration routes of S. flavescens and S. tonkinensis.",

The contents of flavonoid aglycones with potent anticomplement activity were enhanced significantly under the hydrolytic action of intestinal flora on the flavonoid glycosides. Among the eighteen flavonoids identified using UPLC-ESI-LTQ/MS method, isoflavone and flavonol aglycones (formononetin and quercetin) and three flavonol glycosides (rutin, isoquercitrin and quercitrin) were the major anticomplement constituents of TFST and should be taken as the quality markers of S. tonkinensis roots. The in vivo anti-inflammatory and anticomplement effects of formononetin, the most potent constitent and metabolite of TFST, will be investigated in the near future.",
