According to a recent report from the world health organization [56], it is vital to include environmental sampling as part of the comprehensive outbreak investigation and combine environmental sampling with the results of COVID-19 patient investigations. Nonetheless, the suggested protocol for sampling the environment is limited to the hospitals and other health care facilities that have a high possibility of being contaminated with the virus. Other possibly contaminated areas of the environment, such as grocery stores, service areas, and workplaces, are not considered. As the proposed framework in this paper is able to identify and localize such infected areas, it can provide a tool for epidemiological investigation teams that supports the efficient sampling of the environment to detect potential threats. Effective localization of these threats can help in applying the required actions or the appropriate quarantine necessary to contain the spread of the infection promptly.",

At the higher-level, a hierarchy of software agents deployed on fog nodes are responsible for aggregating monitoring data within their assigned regions and detecting potential threats. Moreover, the framework provides an adaptive multi-agent system for reorganizing the monitored environment structure to cope with the evolving dynamics and to alleviate the consequences of the static hosting infrastructure.",

As can be seen in the Figure, with an infection radius of 300 or 400, the framework is unable to identify all infected cells in the environment. Nevertheless, as the cell size decreases, the percentage of false negatives also decreases. Yet, in case of monitoring more number of humans, the percentage of false negatives also deceases. For instance, the percentage of false negatives will drop to zero percent starting from level (3) in case of monitoring 3000 humans (see Fig. 10c). Although monitoring more humans might slightly affect the accuracy of the framework as discussed above, it will result in a higher chance of covering more infected areas. Consequently, it helps in minimizing the percentage of false negatives and in enhancing the reliability of the framework.\n",
