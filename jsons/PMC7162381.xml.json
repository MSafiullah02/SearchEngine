Here, 200 different molecular dynamics simulations of monomeric CCP in explicit water (4.0 ns for each simulation with a 1.0 fs time step and different initial velocities) were executed to refine the homology model.\n11\n\n,\n\n17\n Then, we screened 361,413 chemicals against the CCP model refined by MMDSs and identified 12 chemicals for antiviral testing.

In fact, many protein targets are functional only in a multimeric form. With target information at the gene level only, it is difficult to deduce the precise multimeric form required for the function of the protein target, let alone the challenge of simulating proteins in their multimeric forms. This problem appears to mitigate against the use of the genome\u2010to\u2010drug\u2010lead approach. However, information concerning ternary structure is not required if virtual screening is searching for inhibitors (not activators) of protein targets. Indeed, an inhibitor lead identified from the inactive, monomeric CCP binds to the monomeric CCP, and possibly to the dimeric CCP as well. While binding to dimeric CCP can certainly inhibit CCP, binding to monomeric CCP also can inhibit CCP because the dimer is in equilibrium with the monomer and binding to the monomer can convert the active dimeric CCP to the inactive monomeric CCP. This explains why a 23 \u03bc\nm inhibitor lead was successfully identified using the inactive monomeric CCP in virtual screening.",

Using the traditional trial\u2010and\u2010error approach, it is certainly difficult to improve the potency of a 100 \u03bc\nm lead by several orders of magnitude. For this reason, the definition of a drug lead is commonly defined as a chemical possessing an inhibitory potency less than 50 \u03bc\nm. However, using MMDSs to guide structural modification, we improved an inhibitor lead of a zinc endopeptidase in botulinum neurotoxin serotype A from 15% inhibition at a drug concentration of 100 \u03bc\nm to 19% inhibition at 2.5 \u03bc\nm.\n20\n This demonstrates that the 23 \u03bc\nm inhibitor is useful as a drug lead, especially because its potency was determined by a cell\u2010based assay.
