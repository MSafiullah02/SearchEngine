(2) To assess the perceived usefulness of social media and other forms of media for COVID-19 public health campaigns. Design: A descriptive WhatsApp messenger-based cross-sectional survey in April 2020. Setting: Makerere University Teaching Hospitals (MUTH) and 9 of the 10 medical schools in Uganda. Participants: HCPs at MUTH and MS in the 9 medical schools in Uganda. Main outcome measures: We collected data on sociodemographic characteristics, sources of information on COVID-19, preferences of social media platform and perceived usefulness of the different media platforms for acquisition of knowledge on COVID-19. Result: Overall, response rate was 21.5% for both MS and HCPs. In total, 877 (HCPS [136, 15.5%], MS [741, 85.5%]) were studied. Majority (n=555, 63.3%) were male with a median age of 24 (range: 18-66) years. Social media was a source of information for 665 (75.8%) participants. Usage was similar among MS and HCPs (565/741 (76.2%) vs. 100/136 (73.5%), p=0.5). Among the MS, commonly used social media were: WhatsApp (n=705, 95.1%) Facebook (n=405, 54.8%), Twitter (n=290, 39.1%), Instagram (n=178, 24.0) and Telegram (n=80, 10.8%). Except for WhatsApp, male MS we more likely to use the other social media platforms (p= <0.001 -0.01). Mass media (television and radio) and social media were preferred the most useful tools for dissemination of COVID-19 related information.",

Among medical students, WhatsApp and Facebook were the most frequently used social media platforms; and they preferred mass media and social media as the most useful tools for dissemination of COVID-19 related information.

Social distancing guidelines and lockdowns have also posed a challenge to public health campaigns. This therefore necessitates a shift from popular print media (newspapers, magazines, banners, etc.) to wireless media. Our study suggests that common wireless media like televisions, radios and social media can be effective in improving awareness on COVID-19. Over 40% of the world's population have access to internet to date [11] . Social media are the most used networking sites globally, with Facebook being the most used social networking platform [12] . Social media can be used for dissemination of knowledge and clearing myths the public has on COVID [9] . However, misinformation can be equally spread by social media leading to fear, panic and anxiety among the public [13] . Infographics can be therefore be widely distributed via these platforms by verified pages and accounts of public agencies and health officials. WHO already has dedicated WhatsApp numbers and groups in various languages to disseminate info on COVID-19 [14] .",
