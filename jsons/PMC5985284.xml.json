Surfactant proteins (SP)-B and SP-C are highly hydrophobic and essential for the surface activity of lung surfactant.2 ATP-binding cassette A3 (ABCA3) transports surfactant phospholipids into lamellar bodies where they bind SP-B and SP-C to form surfactant.3 Secreted lung surfactant is partially recycled by type II epithelial cells, and the remainder is taken up and catabolized by alveolar macrophages (AMs). Granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) is implicated as essential for catabolism of lung surfactant, as well as the proliferation and maturation of human AMs.4",

APAP is caused by excess production of autoantibodies against GM-CSF.6 AMs of APAP-affected individuals show a typical foamy appearance.7 SPAP is associated with underlying malignancies or blood diseases, such as myelodysplastic syndrome (MIM: 614286).8 GPAP is caused by mutations in several genes.9, 10 SP-B, encoded by one of the genes associated with GPAP, SFTPB (MIM: 178640), is required for the maturation of SP-C. SP-B deficiency (MIM: 265120) is an autosomal-recessive disease characterized by respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) (MIM: 267450) at birth, which then develops into infantile type PAP.11 Abnormalities in SP-C (encoded by SFTPC [MIM: 178620]) (MIM: 610913) and ABCA3 (encoded by ABCA3 [MIM: 601615]) (MIM: 610921) are likely to yield manifestations of GPAP and interstitial pneumonitis.12, 13, 14 Mutations in genes encoding GM-CSF receptor (CSF2RA [MIM: 306250] and CSF2RB [MIM: 138981]) are also associated with GPAP (MIM: 300770, 614370) in infants and adults.15, 16, 17 Mutations in GATA2 (MIM: 137295) are associated with monocytopenia and mycobacterial infection (MonoMAC) syndrome (MIM: 614172), which shows a broad spectrum of clinical manifestations, including PAP.18",

The genomic DNA of two affected siblings (A-II-1 and A-II-3) from family A was extracted by phenol/chloroform methods and stored at \u201380\u00b0C (Figure S1A). The genomic DNA samples of other family members were extracted from heparinized peripheral blood samples using SepaGene (Sankojunyaku). All DNA samples were amplified with an Illustra GenomiPhi DNA Amplification Kit (GE Healthcare). In addition, we established Epstein-Barr virus-transformed lymphoblastoid cell lines (EBV-LCL) from the two siblings, one affected (A-II-4) and one unaffected (A-II-2), and extracted their DNA. WES analysis was performed as described previously.19 Briefly, 3 \u03bcg of whole-genome amplified DNA from peripheral blood or DNA samples from EBV-LCL were used in sample preparation. Genome partitioning was performed with SureSelect Human All Human Exon v4 (Agilent Technology) according to the manufacturer\u2019s protocol. The samples were run on a HiSeq2000 (Illumina) with 101-bp paired-end reads and 7-bp index reads. Reads were mapped to the human reference genome (GRCh37.1/hg19) by Novoalign 2.08.02.

For the homozygous model, we first removed synonymous variants and then selected (1) rare variants (n \u2264 1/153) in our in-house exome data, (2) variants with minor allele frequency (MAF) \u2264 0.01 in ESP5400, (3) variants outside segmental duplication, and (4) variants shared in three affected children. For autosomal compound heterozygous variants, we first removed synonymous variants and then selected (1) rare variants (n \u2264 1/153) in our in-house exome data, (2) variants with MAF \u2264 0.01 in ESP5400, (3) variants outside segmental duplication, and (4) variants shared among three affected children. To estimate the mosaic variation in their parents, we counted the reads with variation using the BAM file with Integrative Genomic Viewer (see Web Resources). To confirm the presence of the variant allele in peripheral blood, we sequenced the 151-bp amplicon covering the candidate OAS1 (MIM: 164350) variant by deep sequence analysis using MiSeq with Miseq Reagent Kit v1 (300 cycles) (Illumina). Genomic DNA samples from two unrelated simplex individuals from families B and C (B-II-1 and C-II-1) (Figures S1B and S1C) were subjected to PCR amplification of OAS1 with primers to cover three transcriptional variants sharing the same exons 1 to 4 (RefSeq: NM_016816.3, NM_002534.3, and NM_001032409.2) as listed in Table S1.

The conformation of OAS1 is stabilized in a catalytically active form, which is capable of binding to ATP and Mg2+ ions upon binding to dsRNA. Ala76 in hOAS1 (Ala75 in pOAS1) adjoins the two active site aspartic acid residues, Asp75 and Asp77 (Asp74 and Asp76 in pOAS1), which bind to Mg2+ ions. The side chain of Ala76 is involved in a hydrophobic core that would define the active site structure in the RNA-bound form, indicating that the p.Ala76Val variant would affect enzymatic activity. There are structural differences around Cys109 between the RNA-bound and apo forms. The side chain of Cys109 in hOAS1 (Cys108 in pOAS1) is involved in a hydrophobic core of the apo form of OAS1, which is rearranged upon dsRNA binding. Leu198 in hOAS1 (Leu197 in pOAS1) is involved in a hydrophobic core, which is located close to the ATP binding pocket. Thus, the p.Leu198Val variant in hOAS1 (corresponding to p.Leu197Val in pOAS1) might impair ATP binding and enzymatic activity.",

The OAS1 protein, encoded by OAS1, is a member of the 2-5A synthetase family essential for innate immune response against viral infection.25, 26, 27 OASs are induced by interferons and use adenosine triphosphate in 2\u2032-specific nucleotidyl transfer reactions to synthesize 2\u2032,5\u2032-oligoadenylates. These molecules activate latent RNase L, which results in degradation of both viral and endogenous RNA. In addition to antiviral activity, the OASs were reported to be involved in fundamental cellular functions, such as cell growth and differentiation, gene regulation, and apoptosis.28 A single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP), rs10774671, causing OAS1 splicing variant p46 but not p48 and p52, is associated with increased susceptibility to plasma leakage and shock in individuals infected with dengue virus-2, indicating that immune overreaction could be triggered by the specific OAS1 genotype, at least in dengue virus infection.29 Although the functions of OAS1 on AMs have not been fully elucidated, expression of OAS1 in AMs could be induced by oxidative stress.30 Two SNPs are associated with severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) susceptibility: the G-allele of non-synonymous A/G SNP rs1131454 in exon 3 (p.Ser162Gly) located near the dsRNA binding domain and SNP rs2660 in the 3\u2032 untranslated region of OAS1, possibly associated with expression of each transcriptional variant.26, 27 This association suggests the immune-modulating function of OAS1 protein especially in the respiratory system. Therefore, we speculated that the heterozygous mutations of OAS1 observed in the three families, presumably gain-of-function mutations, might be associated with exaggerated immune reaction especially in AMs in response to viral infections, leading to dysfunction of AMs and impaired catabolism of lung surfactant.",

Glomerular diseases, including glomerulosclerosis, are increasingly observed especially in individuals with graft versus host disease after HSCT.33 As renal biopsy was performed at the end stage of renal failure, it was difficult to determine whether glomerulosclerosis observed in B-II-1 was associated with HSCT. As another affected individual, A-II-4, showed proteinuria before initiation of monthly IVIG, OAS1 dysfunction itself could cause glomerular diseases. Long-term observation and accumulation of more individuals with this disease are necessary to evaluate this association.",

C-II-1 has had cord blood engraftment for 2 years without any respiratory symptoms. It has been reported that AMs are derived from precursor cells in bone marrow.36 Pulmonary transplantation of differentiated wild-type AMs derived from bone marrow in GM-CSF receptor-\u03b2-deficient mice showed long-term effectiveness due to proliferation of transplanted AMs.37 Although IVIG could transiently improve the clinical condition, HSCT is the most effective therapy for this disease at present.",
