Although the mechanism of action for vidarabine is unclear, the drug is phosphorylated by cellular kinases to its triphosphate form and prevents viral DNA synthesis through inhibition of the viral DNA polymerase. Vidarabine has efficacy for the treatment of herpes encephalitis, neonatal HSV infection, herpes keratitis, and mucocutaneous HSV infection and zoster in the immunocompromised host. The drug is not easy to use, however, because of its toxicity, poor solubility in water, and rapid deamination in vivo to a less active compound, arahypoxanthine. As such, vidarabine is seldom used and has been largely replaced by acyclovir. Resistance to vidarabine has not been identified in a clinical setting, although drug-resistant isolates can be induced in the laboratory and are caused by an altered viral DNA polymerase.22 Vidarabine has in vitro activity against acyclovir-resistant HSV and VZV isolates, but the drug has not proven useful for the treatment of these isolates in HIV-infected patients.89\n",

Acyclovir accumulates only in cells infected with herpesviruses in which it is phosphorylated by a viral-specific thymidine kinase to its monophosphate form. It is further phosphorylated to the diphosphate and active triphosphate forms by cellular enzymes; the acyclovir triphosphate inhibits viral DNA polymerase by acting as an immediate DNA chain terminator. Acyclovir is efficacious for the treatment of primary and recurrent HSV and VZV infections, HSV encephalitis, neonatal herpes, and the management of mucocutaneous HSV infection. Resistance to acyclovir can result from mutations in the genes encoding the viral thymidine kinase (TK) or the viral DNA polymerase.23, 42, 53, 94 Mutations in the gene for TK can result in viral isolates that are either deficient (TK\u2212) in or have altered production (TKA) of viral thymidine kinase activity.23, 34, 42, 50, 94 Viral isolates with a TK\u2212 phenotype cause a decrease or lack of acyclovir phosphorylation, whereas TKA strains result in altered substrate binding properties for acyclovir.",

It is rapidly and extensively absorbed following oral administration and is converted to its active triphosphate form of penciclovir by mechanisms that are similar to acyclovir. Like acyclovir, penciclovir has good in vitro activity against HSV and VZV and limited activity against EBV and CMV. Unlike acyclovir, penciclovir is not an obligate chain terminator but is an effective inhibitor of DNA chain elongation. Also, despite a less powerful inhibition of the viral DNA polymerase than acyclovir, famciclovir has a much higher oral bioavailability, and its active form is phosphorylated much more efficiently and has a significantly longer intracellular half-life in herpes-infected cells. This may ensure prolonged antiviral activity in virus-infected cells and may be responsible for the lower and more convenient dosage regimen of famciclovir. Resistance to the active metabolite of famciclovir has been documented, but the mechanisms have not been fully elucidated. Acyclovir-resistant clinical isolates of HSV and VZV that are deficient in viral thymidine kinase are cross-resistant to penciclovir91; penciclovir is active in vitro, however, against some acyclovir-resistant isolates of HSV and VZV with an altered thymidine kinase or DNA polymerase.17, 107 Foscarnet-resistant HSV isolates seem to be susceptible to penciclovir in vitro.17, 91\n",

Although the in vitro activity of ganciclovir is equal to acyclovir for the inhibition of HSV and VZV, its toxicity and lack of selectivity for viral enzymes has limited the clinical use of ganciclovir to the treatment and prophylaxis of serious CMV infections in immunocompromised patients. Ganciclovir is activated to its monophosphate form by a viral-specific thymidine kinase in HSV-infected cells and, in CMV-infected cells, by a phosphotransferase encoded by the UL97 gene of CMV.105 Conversion to the active triphosphate form of ganciclovir is accomplished by cellular kinases. Ganciclovir triphosphate inhibits viral DNA synthesis by competitive inhibition of viral DNA polymerases and by direct incorporation into viral DNA, thereby terminating viral DNA elongation. The mechanisms of resistance to ganciclovir in CMV include alterations in the gene encoding the viral DNA polymerase5, 71, 108 and mutations in the catalytic domain of the phosphotransferase gene leading to a deficiency in drug phosphorylation.20, 21, 101, 117\n",

Because it contains a phosphonate group, viral-specific enzymes are not required for initial phosphorylation. Unlike ganciclovir, cidofovir is phosphorylated by cellular enzymes to its active diphosphate form, which selectively inhibits the viral DNA polymerase. This may prove advantageous for the alternative treatment of herpesvirus resistance to nucleoside analogs caused by deficient or altered viral enzymes that are required for conversion of certain drugs to their monophosphate form.60, 98 The active diphosphate form also has a long intracellular half-life, allowing for a more convenient dosage regimen than either ganciclovir or foscarnet. Ganciclovir and foscarnet must be administered 2 or 3 times daily during initial treatment and once daily for maintenance, whereas cidofovir can be given once weekly for 2 weeks followed by once every other week. In vitro combinations of cidofovir with acyclovir, ganciclovir, foscarnet, and zidovudine have demonstrated additive or synergistic inhibition of several human CMV strains. Although viral resistance to cidofovir has been demonstrated in vitro, it has not been documented in patients treated with the drug.65\n",

Idoxuridine and trifluridine are phosphorylated to the monophosphate form by viral thymidine kinase in HSV-infected cells and to the triphosphate form by cellular enzymes. Disruption of viral replication is thought to be related to inhibition of the viral DNA polymerase, but the exact mechanism of action of these drugs is unknown. Currently, only trifluridine is licensed for use in the United States. It has activity against HSV-1, HSV-2, vaccinia virus, and some strains of adenovirus. Trifluridine is indicated for the topical treatment of primary keratoconjunctivitis and recurrent epithelial keratitis caused by HSV-1 and HSV-2 and has been used as a topical treatment for acyclovir-resistant chronic mucocutaneous genital HSV infections in HIV-infected patients. Viral resistance to idoxuridine and trifluridine has been demonstrated in vitro, but resistance following clinical use has not been reported. Resistant mutants are thought to possess deficient or altered thymidine kinase activity, although the mutants have not been extensively characterized.62 Isolates resistant to idoxuridine are cross-resistant to trifluridine.",

Foscarnet exerts its inhibitory effect by acting at the pyrophosphate binding site on viral-specific DNA polymerases and reverse transcriptases. Phosphorylation by thymidine kinase or other kinases is not required for activation of foscarnet. Thus, acyclovir-resistant HSV isolates that are TK\u2212 or TKA mutants and CMV UL97 mutants resistant to ganciclovir may be sensitive to foscarnet. Resistance to foscarnet is caused by mutations in the viral DNA polymerase gene53, 108; acyclovir- or ganciclovir-resistant isolates with altered DNA polymerase activity may be resistant to the drug. Foscarnet is indicated for the treatment of ganciclovir-resistant CMV retinitis in patients with AIDS32, 55 and for the treatment of acyclovir-resistant mucocutaneous HSV infections in immunocompromised patients.19, 38, 87, 89, 92, 112, 118 Acyclovir-resistant VZV has also been successfully treated with foscarnet.88, 97\n",

The enzyme is required for viral infectivity. Inhibition of HIV protease activity, therefore, leads to the development of immature, noninfectious viral particles. Protease inhibitors act at a postintegration step of HIV replication and have the distinct advantage over reverse transcriptase inhibitors of blocking late stages of viral replication and, thereby, preventing the spread of HIV from cells already infected with the virus. The major disadvantages of the protease inhibitors are their low solubility in aqueous medium and poor oral bioavailability.

The number of original articles on this subject is extensive and the readers should refer to references 26, 28, 29, 82-84, and 102 for more comprehensive reviews of the literature. The emergence of HIV antiviral drug resistance is thought to be a function of the length of therapy, stage of disease or viral burden, and the high spontaneous mutation rate in the viral genome during active replication of the virus. Prolonged therapy and advancing disease increase the likelihood of developing viral resistance. In vitro and in vivo resistance to various antiretroviral drugs is caused by the accumulation of specific mutations in the coding regions of either the reverse transcriptase or the protease of the virus, leading to single amino acid substitutions in the viral protein targets. The extent of resistance seems to be correlated with the number of mutations, although individual mutations can be interactive, causing changes in the resistance or susceptibility of HIV isolates.",

Mutations in the reverse transcriptase gene at codons 41, 67, 70, 215, and 219 confer resistance to AZT. Individual mutations cause only low-level resistance, whereas four mutations are required for high-level resistance to AZT. High-level AZT resistance develops with time and has been associated with a more rapid clinical progression of disease while receiving therapy. Also, AZT-resistant virus has been transmitted by parenteral exposure to HIV-infected blood, sexual contact, and from mother to fetus. Similarly, mutations in the reverse transcriptase gene at codons 74 or 184 are associated with resistance to ddI and cross-resistance to ddC, whereas the change at codon 74 can also suppress the effect of the AZT resistance mutation at codon 215 and restore sensitivity of the isolate to AZT. Resistance to ddC also has been associated with mutations at codons 65, 69, 75, and 215, whereas cross-resistance to ddI has been observed with mutations at codons 65 and 75. Additionally, point mutations at positions 50 and 75 are associated with resistance to d4T and those at positions 65 and 184 with resistance to 3TC. Under the selective pressure of AZT, cross-resistance to other antiretroviral agents is uncommon and confined only to nucleoside analogs with an azido group. Therefore, AZT-resistant viruses will remain susceptible to all other nucleoside analogs, the non-nucleoside analogs, and the protease inhibitors. Unlike the other nucleoside analogs, resistance to 3TC monotherapy develops within days or weeks because high levels of resistance are conferred by only a single mutation at codon 184. The same mutation at codon 184 also can reverse the effects of multiple AZT resistance mutations.",

Coresistance to AZT and nevirapine can develop. A mutation at codon 236 has been described for the resistance of HIV isolates to delavirdine, which also confers an increased susceptibility of the isolates to other non-nucleoside inhibitors.

There are three major classes of human interferons, including interferon-\u03b1, interferon-\u03b2, and interferon-\u03b3. Only interferon-\u03b1 has been approved for use in the treatment of certain viral infections (Table 3). Chronic liver disease caused by hepatitis B and C viruses and condyloma acuminatum caused by human papillomaviruses have been shown to respond to treatment with interferon-\u03b1. Also, interferon-\u03b1 has antiretroviral activity against the replication of HIV by directly inhibiting virus assembly or release. The in vivo actions of interferon-\u03b1, its role as an antiviral agent, and how viruses avoid the effects of this drug is complex and is not yet completely understood.",

A standard inoculum of the virus is then used to infect cell cultures to which various concentrations of an antiviral agent are added. The activity of the antiviral agent against the replication of the virus is measured by one of many methods, including the inhibition of plaque formation or virus-induced cytopathic effect; a decrease in the production of viral antigens, enzyme activities, or total virus yield; a reduction in viral nucleic acid synthesis; or the inhibition of cell transformation. With each method, results are expressed as the drug concentration that causes a 50% inhibition (IC50) in the growth of the virus. Phenotypic antiviral susceptibility assays have been developed and are currently in use for HSV, CMV, VZV, influenza A virus, and HIV-1. Such assays have proven to be accurate and reliable for the determination of antiviral resistance.",

Comparison of in vitro susceptibility data among different laboratories are valid only if the same assay, host cell, virus inoculum, and range of drug concentrations are used. The definition of a sensitive or resistant isolate may differ for each assay system and for different laboratories performing the same assay. Efforts to develop standardized consensus assays for HSV, CMV, and HIV-1 are currently in progress. With the exception of HSV, phenotypic antiviral susceptibility testing also can take many weeks to complete for slow-growing viruses, such as CMV, VZV, and HIV-1, and therefore may not be rapid enough to influence therapeutic decisions. The current goal for these viruses is to develop more rapid phenotypic assays. In vitro susceptibility results also may not always correlate with clinical response. HSV isolates resistant to acyclovir in vitro have responded to antiviral treatment with the drug36, 103 and patients with isolates that remain susceptible to acyclovir in vitro have failed therapy.39 Furthermore, patients can possess a heterogeneous population of viral isolates with different in vitro susceptibilities to a given drug.86\n",

Genotypic assays have been used to screen CMV isolates for the identification of mutations in the CMV UL97 phosphotransferase gene and the UL54 DNA polymerase gene that confer resistance to ganciclovir and/or foscarnet.5, 100 Also, these assays have been employed for the detection of specific mutations in the HIV-1 reverse transcriptase and protease genes following treatment of patients with antiretroviral drugs.56 Site-directed mutagenesis can be used to produce a new recombinant virus possessing defined genetic mutations to demonstrate that the presence of a suspected drug-resistant mutation causes a change in drug susceptibility of the virus. Genotypic assays offer the distinct advantages over phenotypic assays of speed and efficiency in analyzing large numbers of viral isolates. However, these assays are cumbersome, technically demanding, and not routinely available in clinical laboratories. Also, current genotypic assays only detect known drug-resistant mutations and the results may be confounded by the presence of mutations that have no bearing on drug resistance. Phenotypic assays are still required to identify drug-resistant viruses with novel mutations for antiviral resistance.",
