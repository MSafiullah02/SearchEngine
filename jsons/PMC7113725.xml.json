PED was first reported in Belgium and the United Kingdom in 1978, and frequent outbreaks have occurred in various Asian countries (Chen et al., 2010). Since 2007, acute PED outbreaks have continually occurred in Thailand, China, and the USA, which have resulted in substantial economic losses (Puranaveja et al., 2009, Li et al., 2012, Chen et al., 2013, Huang et al., 2013, Marthaler et al., 2013, Stevenson et al., 2013, Yang et al., 2013, Chen et al., 2014).

Previous studies have investigated various control measures to protect against PEDV infection, such as vaccines, diagnostic tools, and therapeutic drugs (Sun et al., 2008, Ren et al., 2011, Sun et al., 2012, Zhu et al., 2013, Guo et al., 2013, Kim and Lee, 2013). Various aspects of PEDV infection remain unclear, for example, swine testis (ST) cells expressing porcine aminopeptidase N of PEDV receptor were not susceptible to PEDV infection. African green monkey kidney (Vero) cells are highly susceptible to PEDV infection, and are widely used for the primary isolation and cultivation of PEDV (Pan et al., 2012, Guo et al., 2014). Therefore, Vero lineages are suitable hosts for understanding the mechanisms of PEDV infection.",

Among current proteomics methods, quantitative high-throughput proteomics approaches are useful for the analysis of infection-associated proteins of pathogens (Linde et al., 2013, Papachristou et al., 2013, Ye et al., 2013, Zeng et al., 2015). In our current study, we used a quantitative proteomics approach based on an iTRAQ tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) technique to identify proteins differentially expressed between PEDV-infected and mock-infected Vero E6 cells. The functions of the differentially expressed proteins (DEPs) were analyzed to determine whether they might be associated with PEDV infection. Our findings provide valuable insight into the changes in cellular processes that occur during PEDV infection.",

The following parameters were used for protein identification: a peptide mass tolerance of 20 ppm; an MS/MS tolerance of 0.1 Da; trypsin digestion; a missed cleavage value of 2; the fixed modifications included carbamidomethyl, iTRAQ8plex(K), and iTRAQ8plex(N-term); the variable modification was oxidation; and an FDR value \u22640.01.

The average quantitative value of each protein in samples C1, C2, and C3 (mock-infection group) was used as the internal reference. The value of the quantitative ratio for each protein relative to the internal reference was calculated, and averaged to obtain the quantitative ratio (V/C) of the proteins identified in the treatment groups (Unwin et al., 2010). A protein was considered to be differentially expressed between the PEDV-infected and mock-infected groups based on the following criteria: the protein had to be present in three replicates of both groups, the difference in the level of the protein between the two groups had to be statistically significant (P\n < 0.05), and the change ratio for the protein had to be \u22651.2 (Yuan et al., 2012).

The differentially expressed proteins (DEPs) annotated to virus infection-associated signaling pathways, autophagy, and virus entry-associated proteins were analyzed further to assess their potential roles in PEDV infection. In mammals, the first line of defense against virus infection is the innate immune system. Early antiviral responses are initiated upon the recognition of pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) by pattern recognition receptors (PRRs), resulting in the production of interferons for the innate immune response and the maturation of dendritic cells for establishing acquired immunity (Yokota et al., 2010). The PRRs are grouped into the TLRs, RLRs, and nucleotide binding-oligomerization domain-like receptors. Our results showed that PEDV infection induced the DEPs that participated in six signaling pathways involved in viral infection, including the RLR, Rap1, PI3K-Akt, MAPK, Jak-STAT, and TLR signaling pathways.",

The S protein of PEDV is a glycoprotein peplomer on the viral surface that plays an important role in receptor-mediated binding and cell membrane fusion. In our study, the integrin recognized sequences of PEDV S protein was analyzed based on Ruoslahti's (1996) report. The results indicated that four conserved integrin-recognized amino acid motifs (Asp-Gly-Glu, Lys-Gly-Glu, Arg-Leu-Asp, and Leu-Asp-Val) were found in the S proteins of various PEDV strains (data not shown).

Fifteen DEPs were mapped to the lysosome and phagosome pathways. Of the 15 proteins, 12 (80%) were down-regulated DEPs. Although the autophagy pathway plays an antiviral role in virus-infected cells, the autophagy machinery is exploited by certain viruses for viral evasion and propagation. Our results showed that PEDV infection induced the downregulation of the expression of many autophagy-associated proteins. Therefore, PEDV infection might inhibit autophagy in Vero E6 cells, thus facilitating virus replication. Previous studies have shown that the microtubule-associated protein 1B is a useful biomarker protein for autophagy (Dong and Levine, 2013).

PEDV infection-associated pathways and proteins are described and discussed based on the bioinformatics analysis of the differentially expressed proteins. Our analysis of Vero E6 cell responses to PEDV infection identified relevant targets for subsequent in-depth studies of PEDV pathogenesis, expand the current knowledge base regarding the interaction between the PEDV and the host cell, and provide useful basic information about other coronaviruses. Although the Vero E6 cells are highly susceptible to PEDV infection and facilitate experimental design and performance for proteomics, the Vero E6 cell line is an interferon-deficient cell line and not a pig cell line. So, the detailed functions of these pathways and proteins in PEDV infection require further verification in the actual host cells of PEDV.",
