In order to gain insight into the emergence, evolution and adaptation of SARS-CoV-2 viruses, a comprehensive analysis of genome composition and codon usage of \u03b2CoV circulating in China was performed. A biased nucleotide composition was found for SARS-CoV-2 genome. This bias in genomic composition is reflected in its codon and amino acid usage patterns. The overall codon usage in SARS-CoV-2 is similar among themselves and slightly biased. Most of the highly frequent codons are A-and U-ending, which strongly suggests that mutational bias is the main force shaping codon usage in this virus. Significant differences in relative synonymous codon usage frequencies among SARS-CoV-2 and human cells were found.

Viruses from this family possess a single stranded, positive-sense RNA genome ranging from 26 to 32 kilobases in length (Su et al., 2016) . Coronaviruses (CoV) have been identified in several avian hosts, as well as in mammals, including humans, bats, civets, mice, dogs, cats, cows and camels (Clark, 1993; Cavanagh, 2007; Zhou et al., 2018) . Although several CoV are pathogenic to humans, most of them are associated with mild clinical symptoms (Su et al., 2016) . Nevertheless, two notable exceptions have been described: severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus (SARS-CoV), a novel \u03b2CoV that emerged in southern China in 2002 (Peiris et al., 2004) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) coronavirus (MERS-CoV), which was first detected in Saudi Arabia in 2012 (Zaki et al., 2012) . Before the SARS epidemic, bats were not known to be hosts for CoVs. In the last 15 years, bats have been found to be hosts of more than 30 CoVs. Interactions among various bat species themselves, batanimal and bat-human interactions, such as the presence of live bats in wildlife wet markets in China, have been proved to be important for interspecies transmission of CoVs (Wong et al., 2019) . In fact, both SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV likely originated in bats, and genetically diverse CoVs that are related to these viruses were discovered in bats worldwide (Cui et al., 2019) .

This bias can also have a major influence on derived parameters, as previously demonstrated for other CoVs (Berkhout and Van Hemert, 2015) . This is in agreement with the results of this work, since the nucleotide composition of SARS-CoV-2 has a strong influence in the codons that are used by this virus for the translation of its RNA genome. Previous studies on codon usage in RNA viruses have shown that mutational pressure is the major factor in shaping codon usage patterns in comparison with natural selection (Jenkins and Holmes, 2003; Wang et al., 2011) . Although mutational pressure is still a major driving force, it is certainly not the only evolutionary force that might be considered in RNA viruses. In these studies, a significant A genomic content was found in SARS-CoV-2 in comparison with other human CoVs (Fig. 3) . Previous studies done in Human Immunodeficiency virus (HIV) found that this virus has an A-rich genome and this property has been proposed to help the virus to avoid recognition by the innate immune system (Vabret et al.,2012) . This could provide a strong selective pressure on retroviruses as well as many others RNA viruses, including CoVs (Kindler and Thiel, 2014; van Hemert et al., 2014) . Moreover, previous studies done in HIV suggest that an RNA genome with A-rich domains may provide a molecular signature that is recognized during virus replication (van Hemert et al., 2013) . In the context of CoV, A-rich regions, like the Transcription Regulation Sequence (TRS), which is involved in transcription of sub-genomics RNAs have been established (Pyrc et al., 2004) . This suggest that nucleotide bias may serve distinct biological function in SARS-CoV-2 as J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f well as in other CoVs and is in direct relation to the characteristic codon usage of these viruses (Berkhout and Van Hemert, 2015) .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 200, "end": 231, "text": "(Berkhout and Van Hemert, 2015)", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 609, "end": 635, "text": "(Jenkins and Holmes, 2003;", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 636, "end": 654, "text": "Wang et al., 2011)", "ref_id": "BIBREF46"}, {"start": 1134, "end": 1154, "text": "(Vabret et al.,2012)", "ref_id": "BIBREF42"}, {"start": 1271, "end": 1296, "text": "(Kindler and Thiel, 2014;", "ref_id": "BIBREF21"}, {"start": 1297, "end": 1321, "text": "van Hemert et al., 2014)", "ref_id": "BIBREF43"}, {"start": 1488, "end": 1513, "text": "(van Hemert et al., 2013)", "ref_id": "BIBREF44"}, {"start": 1683, "end": 1702, "text": "(Pyrc et al., 2004)", "ref_id": "BIBREF28"}, {"start": 1925, "end": 1956, "text": "(Berkhout and Van Hemert, 2015)", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 82, "end": 90, "text": "(Fig. 3)", "ref_id": "FIGREF6"}, {"start": 917, "end": 925, "text": "(Fig. 3)", "ref_id": "FIGREF6"}], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "A mean ENC value of 48.54 \u00b1 2.34 was obtained for SARS-CoV-2 strains enrolled in these studies, suggesting that the overall codon usage among SARS-CoV-2 is similar among themselves and slightly biased.

Cytosine deamination and selection against CpG motifs have been proposed as two independent selection forces that shape codon usage bias in CoV(Woo et al. 2007), suggesting that immune selection may play a role in SARS-CoV-2 codon usage bias.On the other hand, UpU, ApA, UpG are markedly over-used (mean \u00b1 S.D. = 1.96\u00b10.00, 1.55\u00b10.00 and 1.40\u00b10.00, respectively) (Supplementary MaterialTable 2).
