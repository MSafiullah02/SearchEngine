The \u201cSpanish Flu\u201d pandemic of 1918\u20131930, estimated to have infected 500 million people and claimed 40 million lives, caused major central nervous system morbidity [34]. More recently, the epidemic influenza A (H3N2) strain was associated with a surge in cases of encephalitis/encephalopathy in Japan [18, 28, 46], Europe [40] and America [25]. The spectrum of neurological conditions arising from neurovirulent strains of influenza includes seizures [4, 25, 40], acute necrotising encephalopathy (ANE) [30, 40, 42, 44], Reye\u2019s syndrome [3], transverse myelitis [21], acute disseminated encephalomyelitis [21], Guillain\u2013Barre syndrome [9, 21], mutism [29] and movement disorders [37].",

In England, the paediatric mortality was estimated at six per million (70 cases) from an observational population-based study [38]. Thus far, neurological complications have been reported in 26 paediatric cases from three case series from America [2, 7, 8] and in 38 additional cases worldwide [1, 5, 11, 14, 16, 22\u201324, 26, 31\u201333, 36, 39, 41, 43, 45]. Table 1 details the neurological presentation and outcome of these paediatric cases. In this paper, we report the neurological manifestations and outcomes of children who presented to a single UK institution with the 2009 H1N1 virus infection and review their neurological complications in conjunction with the previously reported cases from this epidemic worldwide.\n\n",

ECH has 140 paediatric beds, admits 20,000 children annually and serves a population of seven million (1.5 million children). Hospital data (case notes) of all children hospitalised with the 2009 H1N1 virus infection identified from microbiological records between 1 April 2009 to 31 March 2010 were reviewed. A child with acute neurological complications associated with the 2009 H1N1 virus infection was defined as having laboratory-confirmed infection with seizures, encephalopathy, encephalitis or any focal neurological syndrome (e.g. ataxia) within 1 week of an influenza-like symptom. Children with pre-existing epilepsy who presented with seizures were excluded. Encephalopathy was defined as altered level of consciousness for more than 24 h, including lethargy, irritability or change in personality and behaviour [12]. Encephalitis was diagnosed when encephalopathy was present with two or more of: fever or history of fever (\u226538\u00b0C), seizures and/or focal neurological findings (with evidence of brain parenchyma involvement), cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) pleocytosis (>4 white blood cells/\u03bcl), electroencephalogram (EEG) findings in keeping with encephalitis and neuroimaging in keeping with encephalitis [12].",

Quadruple anticonvulsant therapy achieved sufficient seizure control to allow extubation after 10 days. Drowsiness, marked choreoathetoid movements, aphasia and motor weakness gradually improved, although seizure control was not sustained. Episodes of acute confusional state and aggression responded to risperidone therapy. He was discharged after 6 weeks, still having frequent focal and generalised seizures. He had two further courses of IVIG at monthly intervals. Repeat brain MRI at 3 months showed subtle increased signal in a periventricular distribution bilaterally. Neuro-metabolic investigations showed no evidence of an aminoacidaemia, organicacideamia, urea cycle or fatty oxidation defect. There was no identifiable evidence of an autoantibody-mediated encephalopathy. One year after the acute illness, his seizures remain refractory to treatment, necessitating admission to a specialised inpatient hospital educational setting.

Demographic data available for our cohort indicated that only one patient with neurological complication was from our local population (2%; 1/53) compared with the four patients referred from the region either via the intensive care unit or paediatric neurology service (13%, 4/30), highlighting the referral bias with referred patient tending to be more severely affected and having more neurological complications.

Two of our patients developed both seizures and movement disorders; one developed neuropsychiatric manifestation during the disease evolution and is only the second reported case of this complication associated with the 2009 H1N1 pandemic strain [11]. Movement disorders following viral encephalitis have generally been associated with basal ganglia involvement [20, 21, 37].

Although initial neuroimaging was normal for the other three patients, the interval MRI was abnormal in two. One showed increased signal in periventricular distribution bilaterally, the other revealed significant loss of cerebral volume. Normal acute imaging followed by brain atrophy is well described with IAE, most patients being left with marked neurological sequelae [2, 46], as in our patient.

Case 2 was empirically changed to IV zanamivir due to the severity of this child\u2019s clinical condition and the potential severity of outcome associated with ANE and because of the potential of oseltamivir resistant virus. IV zanamivir was supplied on a compassionate basis by Glaxo-Smith-Kline (Brentford, England) and is thought to carry the same efficacy as oseltamivir [19]. Although the use of antiviral medications can decrease the risk of complications from influenza [6, 27], specific neuro-therapeutic effect is uncertain [25]. In line with previous reports, it was not possible to determine whether antiviral treatment decreased the severity or improved neurological outcome in this series or in the other reported cases.",

While we await the emerging epidemiology of H1N1 and other strains of influenza in coming seasons, early consideration of influenza strains as a cause when children present with neurologic symptoms is advocated, given the potential for significant long-term sequelae especially in previously healthy children (57% of reported cases; 34/59). Normal neuroimaging at presentation should not be over-interpreted; interval imaging is advocated if recovery is not swift. Neuroimaging suggestive of ANE, basal ganglia involvement and volume loss appears to be associated with worse neurological outcome. Whether early treatment with antiviral drugs improves neurological outcome is unknown, but until there is evidence to guide management, early antiviral therapy is advocated. The role of immunomodulatory adjuvant therapy, however, remains speculative and likely should be reserved for the most severe cases.",
