The characteristic sequence of coughing followed by oral expulsion must be determined from the history or observation. Regurgitation and vomiting typically occur without simultaneous coughing, although regurgitation is often accompanied by tracheitis and aspiration pneumonia. However, a patient that is expectorating may \u201cgag\u201d so hard because of pharyngeal/laryngeal irritation that it eventually vomits.",

Gagging is the expulsion of oral or pharyngeal material and may be associated with disorders causing dysphagia (i.e., difficult swallowing) or regurgitation. The relatively minor abdominal contractions associated with gagging are typically different than the vigorous abdominal contractions that classically occur with vomiting. Regurgitation may follow seconds to hours after eating or drinking. Patients may regurgitate white foam (i.e., salivary secretions that have been swallowed) and/or food. Regurgitated food material is undigested and sometimes has a tubular form conforming to the shape of the esophageal lumen. Most clients cannot reliably distinguish undigested from digested food. Regurgitated material that has remained in the esophagus for long time periods can appear \u201cpartially digested\u201d because it is macerated, odoriferous, and mixed with saliva. If blood is present, it is usually undigested (i.e., bright red), whereas blood originating from the stomach is usually partially digested by gastric acid and has a \u201ccoffee grounds\u201d appearance readily distinguishing it from the undigested form (unless the patient vomits before the blood can be partially digested).",

Vomiting may cause secondary esophagitis and subsequent regurgitation, or a patient with long-standing esophageal disease may develop another concurrent disorder causing vomiting. It is therefore important to clarify the chronologic order of specific signs. Finally, some patients with signs \u201cclassic\u201d for regurgitation are vomiting instead. To aid in differentiation, one may attempt to observe the act of expulsion by feeding the patient, although this is very unreliable (\u201cwatched\u201d regurgitating patients often do not regurgitate). Watching the patient eat occasionally helps if there is obvious pharyngeal dysphagia that suggests oropharyngeal disease. Some patients with pharyngeal dysphagia also have concurrent esophageal dysfunction. Contrast radiographs and/or fluoroscopy of the pharynx and esophagus can usually differentiate vomiting from regurgitation.",

            "text": "Regurgitation is usually best evaluated by history, physical examination, plain and contrast radiographs, and/or esophagoscopy (Figure 9-1\n). Contrast radiographs should use barium instead of iodide contrast agents unless esophageal rupture is suspected (e.g., finding air or fluid in the mediastinum on plain radiographs). The main purpose of a contrast esophagram is to distinguish esophageal motility abnormalities from anatomic lesions (e.g., obstruction, mass, inflammation, fistula). Some drugs (e.g., xylazine, ketamine) can cause esophageal hypomotility, making the radiographs potentially misleading. Esophagoscopy is insensitive for diagnosing esophageal muscular weakness but sensitive for finding anatomic lesions, differentiating intramural from extramural obstruction, identifying esophagitis, and removing foreign objects. Patients with acquired esophageal weakness should be evaluated for myopathies, neuropathies, and myasthenia gravis (generalized or localized to the esophagus). Occasionally, hypoadrenocorticism, hyperkalemia, lead poisoning, Spirocerca lupi, and selected central nervous system (CNS) disorders (e.g., distemper, hydrocephalus) may be responsible. Generalized or localized myopathies and neuropathies have several causes (e.g., trauma, dermatomyositis, thymoma, botulism, tick paralysis, systemic lupus erythematosus, nutritional factors, toxoplasmosis, trypanosomiasis). Dysautonomia occurs in dogs and cats, causing generalized dysfunction of the autonomic nervous system producing esophageal hypomotility. It is important to detect underlying disorders so that one may treat the cause rather than just the symptoms. It is also wise to evaluate patients with unexpected esophageal foreign objects (e.g., a relatively small bolus of food) for partial obstructions (e.g., subclinical vascular ring anomaly, stricture).",

Persistent and profuse loss of gastric contents from any cause may produce hypokalemic, hypochloremic metabolic alkalosis with aciduria. However, most patients with gastric vomiting are not alkalotic. Insignificant acid-base changes or metabolic acidosis due to dehydration are probably more common. Intestinal obstruction may cause acidosis due to loss of pancreatic bicarbonate, although some patients have a normal blood pH or a metabolic alkalosis if the obstruction is high in the duodenum.",

Very young (i.e., <12 to 14 weeks of age) and very small (i.e., <3 kg) patients should undergo blood glucose monitoring to detect secondary hypoglycemia. More precise testing is occasionally required to diagnose these disorders (e.g., serum bile acids for hepatic insufficiency, adrenocorticotropic hormone [ACTH] stimulation test for hypoadrenocorticism).

Pancreatitis can occur in any dog, but middle-aged obese female dogs, schnauzers, and Yorkshire terriers seem to be predisposed. Vomiting may or may not be associated with eating, abdominal pain, fasting hyperlipidemia, bloody diarrhea, and, rarely, diffuse subcutaneous fat necrosis. On radiographic examination, a mass or indistinctness due to localized peritonitis may be visible in the cranial right abdominal quadrant. CBC, serum amylase, and serum lipase activities are insensitive and nonspecific; patients with pancreatitis can have almost any result on these tests. Increased ALT and SAP concentrations (as the result of the proximity of the pancreas to the liver and obstruction of the biliary duct) are common but insensitive and nonspecific. Mild to moderate hypocalcemia sometimes occurs. Abdominal ultrasonography can be very specific for canine pancreatitis, but its sensitivity depends upon operator skill and timing (i.e., ultrasound findings can change dramatically in a matter of hours). If a pancreatic mass is discovered during surgery, it must be biopsied; chronic pancreatitis can be grossly indistinguishable from pancreatic neoplasia. The canine immunoreactive pancreatic lipase (spec cPL) (IDEXX, Westbrook, ME) test is the most sensitive test for pancreatitis, but its specificity for clinically important disease is still being determined. Chronic pancreatitis may be presumptively diagnosed if one finds exocrine pancreatic insufficiency in a breed that is not affected by pancreatic acinar cell atrophy.",

Vomiting is not as prominent in feline pancreatitis as it is in canine pancreatitis. Feline trypsin-like immunoreactivity (fTLI) concentrations are increased in some patients. Abdominal ultrasonography is specific, but the sensitivity is uncertain. A pancreatic biopsy may be required for a definitive diagnosis. The feline immunoreactive pancreatic lipase (spec fPL) test appears to be useful in diagnosing pancreatitis. Feline pancreatitis occasionally is due to toxoplasmosis or to feline infectious peritonitis (FIP) (see Chapter 15).",

Abdominal ultrasound is potentially specific and may delineate infiltrative or inflammatory intestinal patterns, but it is insensitive. If gastritis or enteritis is suspected or if the other major causes of chronic vomiting have been ruled out, gastric and intestinal mucosal biopsies via endoscopy or laparotomy may be helpful. Inflammatory bowel disease is an important cause of feline chronic vomiting. Duodenitis is also a significant cause of vomiting without diarrhea in dogs; therefore both gastric and intestinal biopsies should be performed. Finally, because 10% to 20% of patients with colitis vomit, it is sometimes helpful to perform endoscopy on the upper and lower intestinal tracts in patients (especially cats) with chronic vomiting. It is critical that good-quality mucosal tissue samples be taken and handled properly to avoid artifacts, which can render them nondiagnostic.",

History should explore the possibility of recent dietary change and exposure to infectious agents. Diet, bacteria, viruses, and parasites are the major identifiable causes of acute diarrhea in dogs and cats. Because intestinal parasites may contribute to any diarrheic state, fecal examinations (direct and flotation) are typically warranted in diarrheic patients. Giardiasis may require special diagnostic techniques (see Fecal Giardia Detection later in this chapter). The need for diagnostics depends upon (1) the severity of the problem (i.e., more severely ill patients require more diagnostics), and (2) the likelihood that the patient has an infectious agent that has potential to be nosocomial or zoonotic.Box 9-4Major Categories of Causes of Acute Diarrhea in Dogs and Cats\nIntestinal Parasites (common)\nHookwormsRoundwormsWhipworms (primarily dogs)Coccidia\nGiardia (sometimes difficult to diagnose)\nStrongyloides\n\nTritrichomonas (primarily cats)\nDiet (common)\nPoor-quality food/food poisoningSudden dietary change (especially young animals)Food intolerance/allergy\nAcute Viral or Bacterial Enteritis\nParvovirus (canine and feline) (common)\nCoronavirus (canine and feline)\nClostridium perfringens (common)\nCampylobacteriosis (rare)Salmonellosis (rare)\nEscherichia coli (suspected, but not proven)\nIntussusception\n\nIntoxication\nGarbageFood poisoningHeavy metalOrganophosphate\nHemorrhagic Gastroenteritis\n",

Clinical trials using pancreatic enzyme preparations are very insensitive and nonspecific. Powdered enzyme is often superior to tablet formulations, and some enzyme preparations are clearly superior to others. Some dogs with EPI also require a low-fat diet, antacid therapy (rare), or treatment for concurrent ARE (common) before the enzyme replacement therapy becomes effective, even when appropriate enzymes are administered. Up to 15% of dogs with EPI never respond to therapy. Too often, failure of empirical enzyme replacement therapy leads to unnecessary tests (i.e., biopsy) because EPI was incorrectly eliminated. No consistent hematologic or serum chemistry profile changes are seen. Undigested fats can often be found in the feces; however, this is inconsistent. The fat absorption test yields many false results. The TLI assay is the standard test for EPI. It is important to note that the TLI tests are species specific.

Intestinal lymphangiectasia produces some of the lowest serum albumin concentrations that occur in alimentary disease (e.g., <1.0 g/dl). Hypocholesterolemia is common, and peripheral lymphocyte counts occasionally are decreased. If hepatic insufficiency and loss from the kidneys and skin have been eliminated in a severely hypoalbuminemic patient, PLE becomes the major differential diagnosis by process of elimination. If PLE is suspected in a patient that has another potential explanation for its hypoalbuminemia (e.g., renal protein loss, hepatic insufficiency, severe exudative skin disease), then measuring fecal alpha1-protease inhibitor concentrations may clarify whether or not excessive GI protein loss is occurring. Alpha1-protease is relatively stable and resistant to GI degradation; consequently, it can be measured in the feces. Intestinal biopsy is usually the definitive test for determining the cause of PLE. Full-thickness biopsy may risk dehiscence if the serum albumin level is less than 1.5 g/dl; serosal patch graft techniques decrease the risk of dehiscence. Gastroduodenoscopy-ileoscopy plus biopsy is relatively safe and often diagnostic. Occasionally the intestinal lesion is inaccessible via endoscopy. Although not recommended, dietary trial with an ultra-low-fat diet may be substituted for biopsy in patients suspected of having lymphangiectasia.

            "text": "Generalized hepatomegaly necessitates careful clinicopathologic evaluation. Hepatomegaly may be caused by primary or secondary hepatic disease. Diagnosis may be confirmed with a history of exposure to certain toxins (Box 9-5, Box 9-6\n) or diagnosis of a systemic disease (e.g., hyperadrenocorticism) known to affect the liver. Changes in ALT, SAP, hepatic function tests, and hepatic size, although suggestive of hepatic disease, are not diagnostic of specific entities. This is true even in breeds with predispositions to specific hepatic diseases (e.g., Doberman pinschers, Bedlington terriers). Changes in the SAP or ALT may also be caused by primary nonhepatic disease (e.g., hyperadrenocorticism, IBD, diabetes mellitus, heart failure). A definitive diagnosis usually requires hepatic biopsy. The clinician should first seek to rule out nonhepatic causes of secondary hepatic dysfunction. Hepatic biopsy should be considered in patients with obviously significant hepatic disease, those that do not have obvious nonhepatic causes (e.g., hyperadrenocorticism, right heart failure), and those that have persistent (>1 month) changes in serum ALT consistent with chronic or progressive hepatic disease or abnormal hepatic function tests (see Figure 9-8). It is not always possible to accurately distinguish primary hepatic from secondary hepatic disease before biopsy; therefore whenever hepatic biopsy is performed via laparotomy or laparoscopy, the rest of the abdomen should be explored and other organs sampled if they might be involved. Fine-needle aspirates with cytology are sometimes useful in detecting diffuse hepatic infiltrative disease and hepatic lipidosis (Figure 9-9\n); however, fine-needle aspirates (even when guided by ultrasound) often miss infiltrative processes. A negative cytologic finding from a fine-needle aspirate never excludes infiltrative hepatic disease. Hepatic biopsy may be done with ultrasound guidance, laparoscopy, or laparotomy. Laparoscopy allows for much superior hepatic biopsies compared with ultrasound-guided core needle biopsies and is not as invasive as surgery.Box 9-5Drugs that Have Been Documented or Suspected to Cause Increased Alanine Aminotransferase (Alt) Levels Due to Hepatic DiseaseAcetaminophen (especially cats) (important)Amiodarone\nl-AsparaginaseAzathioprineBarbiturates (important)Carprofen (important)ClindamycinDoxycyclineDiazepamErythromycin estolateGlucocorticoids (dogs only) (important)GriseofulvinIbuprofenItraconazoleKetoconazole6-MercaptopurineMethimazoleMethotrexateNitrofurantoinPhenobarbital (important)Primidone (important)SalicylatesSalicylazosulfapyridineSulfonamidesTetracyclineTrimethoprim-sulfa drug (important)NOTE: These drugs do not reliably cause hepatic disease.

If a patient has signs of hepatic failure (i.e., icterus, hepatic encephalopathy, hypoglycemia, weight loss, vomiting, hypoalbuminemia, ascites, microhepatia), one generally assumes that the increased SAP is due to primary hepatic disease.

If a patient had a reasonable appetite when weight loss began, major differential diagnoses are small intestinal disease, maldigestion, hepatic disease, increased use of calories (e.g., hyperthyroidism, lactation), increased loss of calories (e.g., diabetes mellitus) or caloric-deficient diet. If no other identifiable problems (other than weight loss or anorexia) can be pursued, a systematic search is indicated (Figure 9-13\n). One should first preclude as many causes as possible with the history and physical examination (i.e., lack of food, calorie-deficient food, inability to eat, regurgitation, vomiting and diarrhea). Next, extensive clinicopathologic screening is indicated. Imaging is considered an extension of the physical examination, and abdominal ultrasound plus thoracic radiographs are appropriate. Thoracic radiographs may be very revealing, even if a patient does not have coughing or abnormal lung sounds. Abdominal ultrasonography is particularly desirable and often more useful than radiographs, assuming the operator is accomplished. If laboratory or radiographic abnormalities are not present or are unconvincing, one may repeat the tests at 1- to 3-week intervals, depending on the clinical condition of the patient, or immediately proceed to function tests, biopsies, or both. Certain hepatic and adrenal gland diseases may require such function tests.

Abdominal ultrasonography is useful to examine the liver, spleen, pancreas, kidneys, and prostate, as well as to detect peritoneal fluid. If abdominal fluid is present, abdominocentesis or abdominal lavage with cytologic analysis is indicated.
