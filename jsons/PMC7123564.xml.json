In the first decade of the twenty-first century, infectious diseases continue to be a serious cause of visual loss, mortality, and morbidity. We should not rest on the laurels we have won for overcoming the classic infections, but we should, rather, prepare ourselves to confront the microorganisms emerging from the degradation of our ecosystem as well as those bacteria that are becoming increasingly antibiotic resistant.

Antibiotics, however, can cause harm as well as good. Erlich, in 1900 in Germany, introduced the concept of selective toxicity of chemicals, showing that it is possible to use an antibiotic that is toxic to the microorganism but does not harm the host. In 1929, Fleming recorded his observation that agar plates in his laboratory contaminated with Penicillium spp. were free of other bacteria such as staphylococci and went to discover penicillin. In 1935 in Germany, Domagk described sulfonamide, not only winning the Nobel Prize in 1939 but also launching a new era of antimicrobial agents. It was not until 1940, however, when Chain and Florey used penicillin in the treatment of Streptococcus pneumoniae infections, and that was the turning point in the management of infectious diseases.",

The results showed that while 95 % of strains of S. epidermidis were sensitive to fusidic acid and 84 % were sensitive to bacitracin, only 45 % were sensitive to methicillin, 53 % to gentamicin, 56 % to erythromycin, and 33 % to chloramphenicol [29]. Unfortunately, resistant strains of staphylococci to fusidic acid started to appear. Currently, close to 52 % of ocular isolates of staphylococci are sensitive to fusidic acid. The topical use of antibiotics such as chloramphenicol is less effective and carries risks of systemic adverse effects. Chloramphenicol is an antibiotic which is considered to have a very narrow spectrum, with many organisms resistant to it, and carries the risk of aplastic anemia. It is vital that chloramphenicol be prescribed only when absolutely necessary, for example, treating strains of Haemophilus that are resistant to other antibiotics.",

It has been shown to be highly effective against chlamydial infections as well as against Gram-positive bacteria [31\u201333]. Azithromycin has a long elimination life reaching 68 h. Azithromycin has been found to be effective in the treatment of genital Chlamydia. A single, 1-g dose is sufficient to eradicate it. Azithromycin is also effective in the treatment of trachoma [34]. A 1-week course or repeated 3-day courses of azithromycin are required in chronic active cases of trachoma. The drug has high intracellular concentration in the macrophages and polymorphonuclear cells. Following a single oral dose of azithromycin, the drug remains in the conjunctiva above the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of Chlamydia for up to 2 weeks [31]. The drug is currently available as eyedrops at a concentration of 1.5 % as Azyter\u00ae (Laboratoires The\u00e1, Clermont-Ferrand, France) and 1.0 % concentration as Azasite (Inspire Pharmaceuticals Inc, NC, USA). The tear concentration of topical azithromycin was studied following topical administration of a single dose of azithromycin 1.0 and 1.5 % in healthy volunteers [32]. This study was a prospective, randomized double-masked study. A total of 91 healthy volunteers with normal tear functions were included. Twenty-three subjects received azithromycin 0.5 % eyedrops, 58 subjects received azithromycin 1.0 % eyedrops, and 38 subjects received azithromycin 1.5 % eyedrops. Tears were collected from each subject at seven time points over a 24-h period using the Schirmer strips that were weighed before and after tear sampling. The tear samples were analyzed for azithromycin by high-performance liquid chromatography mass spectrometry (HPLC-MS). The peak of azithromycin was noted 10 min after instillation and the mean concentration remained above 7 mg/l for 24 h. A late-onset increase in the tear concentration of azithromycin was noted at 8\u201312 h and may be explained by the known azithromycin release from the tissues after storage in the cells [31, 35, 36].",

It is considered a bacteriostatic agent, and the main indication of linezolid is the treatment of severe infections caused by Gram-positive bacteria that are resistant to other antibiotics. It has a narrow spectrum and, therefore, remains a reserved antibiotic for cases with severe infections due to resistant bacteria. Linezolid has been associated with Clostridium difficile-associated diarrhea and pseudomembranous colitis. The long-term use of linezolid may lead to bone marrow suppression and thrombocytopenia.",

Complex formation is followed by reversible inhibition of DNA synthesis. As fluoroquinolone concentrations increase, cell death occurs as double-stranded DNA breaks releasing trapped gyrase and/or topoisomerase IV complexes. In many Gram-negative bacteria, resistance arises primarily from mutation of the gyrase A protein, while in some Gram-positive bacteria, primary resistance occurs via mutation in topoisomerase IV. In addition, efflux pumps that actively pump antibiotics out of the bacteria confer multidrug resistance via these membrane-associated efflux pumps. Gatifloxacin and moxifloxacin are more resistant to these efflux pumps. This change additionally confers added anaerobic activity. Gram-negative organisms may also exhibit decreased levels of outer membrane proteins that facilitate diffusion into the bacterial cell of drug, thereby conferring additional resistance, which can work in concert with the efflux pumps. These last two mechanisms confer a form of resistance and can be overwhelmed by higher concentrations of drug [65].",

Fluoroquinolones are approximately 20\u201330 % protein bound. This value has been found to be independent of the drug concentration. Following oral administration of lomefloxacin, 10 % of the drug is protein bound in the serum. Evidence from animal studies suggests that lomefloxacin is excreted unchanged by the kidney, although small concentrations of 5 metabolites have been described. The most notable drug interaction occurring is the effect of fluoroquinolones on the clearance of theophylline. Plasma concentrations of theophylline are raised by approximately 19 % during coadministration with perfloxacin as compared to 111 % for enoxacin and 23 % for ciprofloxacin. Ofloxacin and nalidixic acid do not increase the apparent plasma level of theophylline. The interaction is supposed to rise, not through the parent fluoroquinolone but through their 4-oxo metabolites. This interaction is produced through the effect on hepatic p450-related isoenzymes resulting in reduced capacity of N-demethylation of theophylline. No oxo-metabolite is produced in the metabolic elimination of lomefloxacin, and the drug is extensively excreted. Theophylline adjustment does not seem to be necessary in patients receiving concomitant lomefloxacin.",
