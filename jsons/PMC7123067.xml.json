            "text": "After the Anopheles mosquito aspirates with gametocytes infected blood, the gametocytes develop to gamete in the mosquito\u2019s intestines. In the blood of the mosquito, the microgametes (male) penetrate the macrogametes (female), forming zygotes. Then cells are changed to an elongated, motile ookinete. This evolves into an oocyst. After the oocyst bursts, sporozoites are released and get in the saliva of the mosquito. The entire cycle inside the mosquito takes 8\u201316 days. If sporozoites enter the human bloodstream through the saliva of the mosquito, liver cells via the bloodstream get infected. They penetrate liver cells and turn into schizonts (exo-erythrocytes cycle). With the exception of P. oval, merozoites are released in the bloodstream after the liver cycle (exoerythrocytic cycle). P. vivax and P. ovale produce hypnozoites, which can stay dormant in liver cells. Merozoites enter red blood cells and multiply there asexually. By rupturing erythrocytes, merozoites are released, which some of them are infecting other erythrocytes. The cycle repeats every 2 or 3 days. The blood stage parasites are responsible of the typical malaria symptoms. Some merozoites differentiate into gametocytes, after being aspirated by the mosquitoes. Again, in a mosquito infected with the pathogen, transfer of the parasite to someone else is possible (\u25d8 Table 32.2, \u25d8 Fig. 32.1).",

Additionally to the symptoms, a blood test is the most important diagnostic tool. The parasite can be demonstrated using a blood smear and thick drop. A single negative smear does not exclude malaria. A negative smear should be repeated three times within 12\u201324 h. In the thick drop, existing parasites with a low count can be accumulated and detected. After a positive test, the number of parasites in the erythrocytes should be calculated. A parasite count >2% might be an indication for complicated malaria. A PCR-test for Plasmodium DNA is a good diagnostic tool and commonly used. It is slightly more sensitive than the blood smear. It also allows a discrimination of the malaria species. Another test is the antigen detection. These immunologic tests often use a dipstick or cassette format and provide results within 2\u201315 min. Hence, they are referred as \u201cRapid Diagnostic Tests\u201d (RDTs). RDTs should be followed up by microscopy. RDTs and smear microscopy currently provide the best results in testing for malaria. The Plasmodium antibody test is not suitable in the initial phase, as antibodies only can be detected after 6\u201310 days. It is only to retrospectively confirm a previous infection. Regular monitoring of the blood count and renal function and a careful fluid balance is necessary during the treatment of malaria. A CXR may be necessary, if respiratory symptoms are present.",

In children methaemoglobinaemia can be provoked by giving primaquine. A single dose of primaquine 45 mg for P. falciparum, P malaria and P. knowlesi can be given to sterilise the gametocytes.

In nearly all tropical areas, there is a risk of getting infected with malaria. In some tourist areas, this risk might be small, but infection is still possible. In particular day trips to more remote areas pose a risk. Some areas have malaria outbreaks and therefore should be avoided. In general, mosquito bites should be avoided to minimise the risk of any mosquito-borne infections. Mosquitoes transmitting malaria are mainly active at night, sunrise and sunset. However, mosquito bites are also possible throughout the day. Long-sleeved shirts, long pants and closed shoes cover the skin and provide protection against insect bites. Insect repellent for the skin and clothes offer additional protection. Higher concentrations offer better and longer protection. The protection period of a normal insect repellent lasts usually only 1\u20132 h. Slow release products can prolong the effect. Mosquitoes avoid air-conditioned rooms. So staying in air conditioned rooms itself provides certain protection. Spraying insecticides in rooms and surroundings can be helpful to repel and minimise the quantities of mosquitoes. The bed should be covered with a mosquito net (\u25d8 Fig. 32.2).",

Severe side effects of these vaccinations are severe allergic reaction (1:55000), vaccine-associated neurotropic disease/post-vaccinal encephalopathy (1:125000) and vaccine-associated viscerotropic disease/multi-organ failure (1:400000). For travelling into countries where yellow fever is endemic, vaccination is mandatory. The side effects seem to be age-related and occur increasingly with progressive age or in young children. The vaccination is contraindicated in children below 9 month and during pregnancy. Analysis of yellow fever vaccines adverse events demonstrated an increased frequency of serious adverse events in persons age 60 years and older. The risk of viscerotropic side effects in <65 years is 1:400000, in a population of 65\u201375 years of age 1:40000 and in >75 years of age 1:4000. A failure to be vaccinated or being documented can lead to a refusal of entry into other countries or to a certain time in quarantine when leaving the area where yellow fever occurs. If there is a clinical indication against receiving yellow fever vaccine (e.g. children <9 month or poor immune status), a written medical exemption can be granted, to enable to travel to these countries without vaccination.",

T. brucei gambiense has an incubation period of months to years and T. brucei\nrhodesiense weeks to months. The initial phase is the haemolytic-lymphatic phase, in which pathogens replicate in tissues, blood and lymphatic tissues. Symptoms are intermittent fever, headache, myalgia and pruritus. Additionally, a painless, indurated chancre on the skin 5\u201315 days after the bite and lymphadenopathy (axillary and inguinal) can be associated. In the second phase, the CNS affected causes continuous headache, behavioural disorders (mood swings and depression), delirium, sensitivity disorders, coordination problems and disruptions of the sleeping cycle (daytime somnolence). The diagnosis is mainly made clinically. Only for the T. b. rhodesiense, a blood test (centrifuged or wet preparation) to detect the parasite is available. Examination of buffy coat increases sensitivity. A biopsy of the lymph node to detect the pathogens can be diagnostic for T. brunei\ngambiense or be used for a culture and PCR. The card agglutination test for trypanosomiasis (CATT) is a field test suitable for mass population screening in endemic areas for T. b. gambienses but has a low specificity and is hence only used for identifying suspected cases. All diagnosed patients need to have their cerebrospinal fluid examined for staging, which influences treatment options (\u25d8 Table 32.4). The treatment is dependent on the pathogen and the staging.

The disease is transmitted by mosquitoes or sandflies (Phlebotomus and Lutzomyia). The cutaneous form is the most common one, which causes skin ulcerations. Typically this form appears weeks to months after the initial mosquito bite. Initially papules are formed, which later ulcerate. They can be painful or painless. The visceral form affects organs, especially the liver, spleen and bone marrow. Therefore, this form can be quite dangerous. The changes occur within months and years. Hepatosplenomegaly and pancytopenia develop. The mucus form is rare. Ulcerative changes of the mucous membranes (e.g. nose, mouth and throat) are typical for this. Endemic areas for leishmaniasis are East Africa, some Arabic countries, India, Bangladesh, Brazil and some other South American countries. Historically, the diagnosis was made by taking a biopsy (skin, bone marrow or other tissues) for culture. Now PCR or serological testing with high sensitivity replaced biopsies for making diagnosis. As the visceral disease is fatal without treatment, it needs to be treated in any case. All other forms require normally no treatment.

They spread through infected urine, which enters water or soil. Leptospires can survive for several weeks and months. Infections can be caused by contact with either direct contact with the urine or other body fluids except saliva as well as with contaminated soil and water. The bacteria enter the body through the skin or mucous membranes. A broken skin increases the risk of infection. Increased risk is after heavy rainfall or flooding. The incubation period is usually 5\u201314 days, but can range from 2\u201330 days. Symptoms vary greatly. Usually sudden onset of headaches, fever, chills, myalgia, nausea and vomiting, diarrhoea, rash and jaundice are common signs of the first phase for 3\u20138 days. If the patient doesn\u2019t recover the second phase (Weil\u2019s disease) develops, with renal failure, ARDS, hepatomegaly, jaundice, haemorrhage and meningitis. This has a fatality rate of 1\u20135%. Untreated symptoms can persist for several months. Treatment is either doxycyclin 100 mg BD or benzylpenicillin 1.2 g QID or ceftriaxone 1 g OD for 7 days.",

Rickettsias are divided into the typhus group and the spotted fever group. Orienta make up the typhus group. The reservoir is found in mainly animals, like rodents, but some species are found in fish. The vector is commonly ticks. In scrub typhus the vectors are larval mites. Others have fleas and lice as a vector. Infection occurs either by bites of the vectors or by direct contact, inoculation or inhalation of contaminated fluids or faeces. The clinical presentation varies. Mild symptoms are headache, myalgia, abdominal pain, cough and rash. Some rickettsial infections, like Rocky Mountains and Brazilian spotted fevers, Mediterranean spotted fever, scrub typhus and endemic typhus, have a fatality rate up to 20\u201360%. Diagnosis is made clinical and by serology. The treatment should be started early by suspicion as serology reports can take quite some time and a delay in treatment may be fatal. Doxycyclin 100 mg BD for 7 days or azithromycin 500 mg OD at the first day 250 mg OD for further 4 days are the antibiotics of choice.",

            "text": "Q-fever is a zoonosis caused by the protozoa Coxiella burnetii. The bacterium is quite resilient due to its sporelike life cycle and remains virulent for months even up to more than a year. The primary reservoir is cattle, goats, sheep and other wildlife like kangaroos, rats and cats. Rarely is it transmitted by tick bites or by ingestion of unpasteurised milk or dairy products. The incubation time is usually 2\u20133 weeks but can range from 2 days to 6 weeks. The initial acute Q-fever comes with sudden onset of high fever up to 40 \u00b0C, headache (retrobulbar), myalgia, chills, non-productive cough and sweats. The symptoms settle within 5\u201314 days. 50% of all infections are however asymptomatic. Often thrombocytopenia and abnormal LFTs are found. Complications are ARDS, endocarditis and meningoencephalitis. The diagnosis is based on detecting phase II and phase I antibodies (IgG) 4 weeks apart. The initial test (phase II) should be taken at the end of the first week of illness. IgM and IgG rise almost at the same time. A fourfold rise is diagnostic. An initial negative titre doesn\u2019t rule out Q-fever. Seroconversion occurs usually between days 7 and 15 but is almost always present by 21 days. PCR testing can be used in the first 2 weeks but before antibiotic administration. However, a negative PCR result doesn\u2019t rule out Q-fever. Chronic Q-fever develops in 0.2\u20134%. It can result in endocarditis, aneurysms, osteomyelitis, hepatitis, neurogic (mononeuritis, optic neuritis), pulmonary (interstitial fibrosis, pseudotumor) and renal (glomerulonephritis) disease. Chronic Q-fever usually develops shortly after the infection. However, chronic endocarditis may not come apparent until 2\u20134 years or even longer. Chronic fatigue syndrome is described in approx. 10%. Typically in chronic Q-fever, the initial IgG titre is increasing (>1:800). The treatment for acute Q-fever is doxycyclin 100 mg BD for 14 days or for at least 3 days after fever subsides and until clinical improvement. As serological confirmation takes time, treatment should not be delayed. Early treatment is effective at preventing severe complications. For chronic Q-fever, 18 months of doxycyclin 100 mg BD and hydroxychloroquine 200 mg TDS is recommended as standard treatment.",

Initial infections can be asymptomatic or cause unspecific symptoms such as cough, night sweats, loss of appetite, fatigue or erythema nodosum. People with normal immunity develop symptoms of tuberculosis only to 10%. The initial infection usually turns into latent tuberculosis. Tuberculosis can affect other organs to approximately 20%.
