Uncoating results in the degradation of the outermost capsid protein \u03c33 and the subsequent cleavage of the underlying viral protein \u03bc1/\u03bc1C to generate an infectious subviral particle (ISVP).7\n,\n8 This processing gives the subvirion particle the capacity to penetrate the endosome/lysosome or the plasma membrane and thereby gain entry to the cytoplasm where reovirus replication can occur.9\n,\n10\n,\n11 Work in animal models suggests that, during natural enteric infections, \u03c33 is proteolytically degraded extracellularly within the intestinal lumen.12\n,\n13 In cell culture, however, reovirus takes advantage of endosomal and lysosomal proteases for its proteolytic conversion into ISVP.11\n,\n14 The necessity of reovirus uncoating for infectivity in vivo and in vitro is further demonstrated by the capacity of protease inhibitors to block enteric infection in mice and restrict reovirus uncoating and infection in cell culture.13\n,\n14\n,\n15\n,\n16\n,\n17\n,\n18\n,\n19\n,\n20\n,\n21\n",

The oncolytic properties of reovirus are also being investigated in clinical trials23\n,\n24 (http://www.oncolyticsbiotech.com). These studies revealed that reovirus infects all but a few cancer cells while leaving normal cells relatively unaffected. Atlhough it has been proposed that reovirus requires an activated Ras signaling pathway in order to mediate oncolysis,25\n,\n26\n,\n27 other studies have demonstrated that active Ras alone does not control susceptibility of cells to reovirus infection.28\n,\n29\n,\n30 Several cell lines, including the highly susceptible L929 mouse fibroblasts, are very susceptible to reovirus despite low levels of Ras activity (T.A. and P.A.F., unpublished results). Furthermore, we have observed that the addition of proteases into the culture medium or direct infection with ISVPs of restrictive cells can render them permissive for reovirus infection.31\n,\n32 These observations suggest that the protease-mediated disassembly of reovirus' capsid may determine whether or not a cell or tumor is permissive for reovirus infection and that this may be independent of elevated Ras activity.",

Protease-generated ISVP particles efficiently infect these disassembly-restrictive cells and other reovirus-resistant cancer cells. We also find that synthetic dsRNA does not protect transformed cells from infection. These results support a model in which the requirement for proteolytic uncoating determines the susceptibility of cancer cells to reovirus oncolysis. Our finding that reovirus can productively infect and mediate in vivo oncolysis of tumors that restrict disassembly in vitro suggests that the microenvironment of tumors and the cellular environment of cancer cells, perhaps through elevated cathepsin B and L activity, facilitate the extracellular conversion of reovirus virions into particles that can penetrate cell membranes and mediate oncolysis.",

To examine reovirus capsid disassembly in susceptible and resistant cells, [35S]-labeled reovirus particles were exposed to the glioma cell lines U87 and U118, the Ras-transformed NIH3T3 (NIH3T3-Ras), and the empty vector pBabe-transfected NIH3T3 (NIH3T3). We found that [35S]-labeled reovirus is proteolytically processed in the susceptible cell lines but not in resistant cell lines. Removal of \u03c33 and cleavage of \u03bc1C to \u03b4, indicative of ISVP formation, can be readily observed 3 hours post infection (h.p.i.) in the U87 cells but not in the reovirus-resistant U118 cells even up to 24 h.p.i. (Figure 1a\n). Processing, although minimal when compared to the susceptible glioma U87 and the L929 cells, was also observed in the Ras-transformed NIH3T3 cells but not in the NIH3T3 controls (Figure 1b). Reovirus disassembly has previously been reported to be inhibited when cells are exposed to the cysteine protease inhibitor E64.8\n,\n16\n,\n17\n,\n18\n,\n19 To verify that this compound could also block reovirus uncoating in our susceptible cells, permissive cells (U87, NIH3T3-Ras, and L929) were exposed to E64 (100 \u03bcmol/l) 1 hour before [35S]-labeled reovirus exposure as just described. We found that the degradation of \u03c33 protein and cleavage of \u03bc1C into \u03b4 was completely inhibited in the presence of E64 up to 24 hours after exposure to the virus (Figure 1c). Similar results were obtained in a subsequent experiment by Western blotting with a specific anti-\u03bc1 reovirus antibody that recognizes both \u03bc1C and \u03b4 (Figure 1d). These results demonstrate that the proteolytic conversion of reovirus virions into ISVPs is deficient in cells resistant to reovirus infection (U118 glioma and the non-transformed NIH3T3 cell line) and that such ineffective reovirus uncoating could explain, in part, the resistance of these cells to infection and oncolysis.",

Cells were incubated with [35S]-labeled reovirus for 1 hour at 4\u00b0C before collecting the cell lysate for quantitative measurements by scintillation counting. We found that different amount of reovirus could bind to resistant and susceptible cells (Figure 2a\n). L929 cells were the most efficient at binding reovirus, followed by the highly susceptible glioma cell line U87 and NIH3T3 cells. The reovirus resistant U118 glioma cells had the lowest binding for reovirus. Although inferior binding with the glioma U118 and the NIH3T3 cells may reduce the permissiveness of these cells to reovirus infection, virions do bind onto these cells. Moreover, the binding measured for the resistant NIH3T3 cells was the same as for the susceptible Ras-transformed NIH3T3, further suggesting that the level of binding on these cells does not mediate differential susceptibility. E64 treatment did not affect the level of reovirus binding in any cell line tested, which excludes the possibility of reduced susceptibility via interference with binding.",

On the other hand, in resistant cells and E64 disassembly inhibited susceptible cells, a punctuate Cy3 fluorescence pattern was observed that was restricted to the same compartment as the lysosomal associated membrane protein 2, indicating lysosomal localization (Figure 2b).",

Therefore, this model would predict that infection by ISVP particles should also be restrained in the resistant NIH3T3 and U118 cell lines through a translation block. In contrast, we found that ISVPs efficiently infected both the resistant glioma cell line U118 and the non-transformed NIH3T3 cells (Figure 3a\n). Whereas reovirus protein synthesis from reovirion infection was apparent in the susceptible cell lines U87 and Ras-transformed NIH3T3\u2014though not when these cells were treated with the disassembly inhibitor E64 (or the weak base ammonium chloride (data not shown))\u2014viral protein synthesis following ISVP infection occurred in the resistant U118 and NIH3T3 cell lines as well as the susceptible cell lines even when treated with E64. Similar results were obtained by immunofluorescence using a rabbit anti-reovirus type-3 antibody followed by FITC\u2013conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG to detect positive reovirus infection (green fluorescent cells) (Figure 3b). Increased viral progeny was also measured in conditions where productive reovirus infection was observed (Figure 3c). We next examined the viability of the resistant and susceptible cells following reovirus or ISVP infection with or without treatment with E64 as described previously (Figure 3d). We found that the protease inhibitor E64 efficiently prevented oncolysis 48 h.p.i. of our susceptible cancer cells infected with reovirus but not with ISVPs. ISVP infection also resulted in a significant decrease in viability of the reovirus-resistant glioma U118 cells. The non-transformed NIH3T3 cells generally remained viable at 48 h.p.i.",

In contrast, our data using ISVPs show that \u201cresistant\u201d cells (i.e., resistant to infection with virions) support a productive infection; ISVPs bypass the limitations of viral entry, uncoating, and penetration into the cytoplasm. To further examine the proposed viral translation block in resistant cells, we assessed whether pretreatment of cells before reovirus infection with synthetic dsRNA (poly(I:C) (20 \u03bcg/ml)), a potent activator of the dsRNA-dependent pathways of interferon and other anti-viral mechanisms, could inhibit viral protein synthesis. We found that viral protein synthesis was reduced in the non-transformed cells (NIH3T3 and HS68 cells) that were pretreated with poly(I:C) and infected with ISVPs. However, exposure of dsRNA did not prevent reovirus/ISVP infection of the susceptible transformed cells (U87 glioma, Ras-transformed NIH3T3, and the Burkitt lymphoma Raji cell lines). In addition, ISVP infection of the reovirus resistant glioma U118 and Burkitt lymphoma Daudi was not prevented by poly(I:C) treatment (Figure 4a\n). Moreover, reovirus exposure to NIH3T3 cells 6 hours before ISVP infection did not result in the inhibition of viral protein synthesis that synthetic dsRNA provided (Figure 4b). Reovirus may be insufficient to stimulate an anti-viral response against ISVP infection in NIH3T3 cells owing to a lack of penetration by the virus. These data support a general model whereby cancer cells\u2014but not normal cells\u2014have defects in their anti-viral mechanism.37 They also suggest that, in reovirus-resistant cancer cells, the foremost factor in the resistance of these transformed cells is at the level of reovirus disassembly and not at the level of a viral messenger RNA translation block. Normal cells may benefit from the additional level of protection provided by an activated anti-viral pathway, but it appears that their primary resistance to reovirus resides in the inability to efficiently uncoat reovirus.",

Both have been reported to mediate reovirus disassembly and permit reovirus infection.14\n,\n17 In addition, these proteases have been implicated in the progression of various cancers, including gliomas,38\n,\n39 and are elevated by Ras activation in NIH3T3 cells.40 We determined whether cathepsin B and L are critical in promoting permissiveness to reovirus in susceptible cell lines. Reovirus-susceptible cells treated or untreated for 6 hours with 10 \u03bcmol/l of the cathepsin B (CA-074) and L (Inhibitor III) (Invitrogen) were lysed, and equal amounts of protein from each sample were assayed for cathepsin B or L protease activity, respectively. Both inhibitors strongly impeded the activity of their respective protease and also had some inhibiting effect on the activity of the other cathepsin (Figure 5a\n). We then found that inhibition of cathepsin B and L 1 hour before reovirus infection significantly protected susceptible cells against reovirus oncolysis 48 h.p.i. (Figure 5b). The combination of both inhibitors had the strongest effect in blocking reovirus oncolysis in the susceptible cell lines U87, Ras-transformed NIH3T3, and L929. As anticipated, ISVP infection was unaffected by these inhibitors. Furthermore, this result was specific to cathepsins because we did not find protection from infection when these cell lines were treated with the broad-spectrum synthetic matrix metalloproteinase inhibitors AG3340 or BB-94 (data not shown).",

U118 tumors were allowed to grow until the establishment of a palpable mass and were then challenged with 1 \u00d7 107 plaque forming units (pfu) of live reovirus or saline intratumorally. We observed a lack of tumor growth in animals treated with reovirus (Figure 6a\n). Hematoxylin and eosin stained sections showed necrosis of tumor cells after live reovirus treatment, and immunohistochemistry with a polyclonal anti-reovirus antibody showed the presence of reovirus (brown) in the U118 tumor; uninfected tumors showed no staining (Figure 6b). We then determined the levels of cathepsin B and L activity from in vivoglioma tumor samples grown in severe combined immunodeficiency mice compared to their respective glioma cells grown in culture, finding elevated cathepsin activity for both U87 and U118 tumors in vivo (Figure 6c). These results provide additional evidence that cell lines resistant to reovirus oncolysis in vitro can be rendered permissive once grown in animals and that this may be due to the proteolytic microenvironment of the tumor. The permissivenessof the U118 cells in vivo (in contrast to their resistance in vitro) was not a consequence of upregulated Ras in the in vivosetting, since Ras\u2013GTP levels from U118 tissue lysates remained low\u2014as in U118 cells grown in culture (Figure 6d).",

According to the reovirus-ras model, ras signaling (through an unknown mechanism perhaps through p38 signaling27) releases a block in translation of viral transcripts by the dsRNA-activated protein kinase (PKR) found in resistant cells. In support of the model, viral transcripts were found to be equivalent with respect to both susceptible and resistant cells. However, we have four observations that are inconsistent with the model. First, we found a restriction of reovirus uncoating in reovirus-resistant cancer cell lines and non-transformed cells. Infection by reovirus requires the disassembly of its outermost capsid in order to penetrate the host and initiate viral gene transcription.9\n,\n10\n,\n11 Second, we found that ISVPs efficiently infected \u201creovirus-resistant\u201d cells. Golden et al. also found that the addition of proteases to the media of resistant cells rendered them susceptible to infection.31 Third, the infection of reovirus-resistant cells by ISVPs was not prevented in cells transformed by pretreatment with synthetic dsRNA. The reovirus-ras model predicts that this treatment would activate PKR, resulting in a translation block and an unproductive infection. Finally, consistent with the ineffective penetration of the virus in resistant cells, we found a lack of reovirus S1 transcripts in resistant cells rather than the equivalent levels of transcripts predicted by that model. Taken together, these results suggest that reovirus disassembly is a critical determinant for oncolysis of cancer cells and a primary factor in resistance to reovirus oncolysis.",

Since reovirus infects a vast majority of cancer cell lines and since most of these do have ras activation, it follows that mutations leading to activated ras may contribute to reovirus susceptibility by increasing protease activity40 (e.g., by increasing expression or reducing expression of an inhibitor) or otherwise facilitating viral entry and disassembly.

First, it is encouraging that the efficiency of some viruses might be enhanced in vivoby the protease-rich environment of the tumor. However, this complicates predictions of efficacy based on in vitro assays because cells that are resistant in vitro may be susceptible in patients. Second, improving disassembly and viral entry may be important strategies to employ in the design and use of oncolytic viruses for clinical use. Isolation of reovirus variants that disassemble more efficiently or require cancer-type specific proteases for uncoating may increase the efficacy of reovirus in vivo and provide further specificity. A related strategy has been used with a measles virus variant specifically engineered to selectively fuse to and infect cancer cells that overexpress metalloproteinases.44 Finally, a better understanding of the molecular basis of reovirus oncolysis will allow us to properly select the patients who are most likely to benefit from this treatment and optimize its use.",
