Her body temperature was 36\u00b75\u00b0C, oxygen saturation was 99% on room air, and respiratory rate was 16 breaths per min. Lung auscultation showed no abnormalities. Neurological examination disclosed symmetric weakness (Medical Research Council grade 4/5) and areflexia in both legs and feet. 3 days after admission, her symptoms progressed. Muscle strength was grade 4/5 in both arms and hands and 3/5 in both legs and feet. Sensation to light touch and pinprick was decreased distally.",

Nerve conduction studies (day 5) showed delayed distal latencies and absent F waves in early course, supporting demyelinating neuropathy (Table 1, Table 2\n). She was diagnosed with Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome and given intravenous immunoglobulin. On day 8 (Jan 30), the patient developed dry cough and a fever of 38\u00b72\u00b0C. Chest CT showed ground-glass opacities in both lungs. Oropharyngeal swabs were positive for SARS-CoV-2 on RT-PCR assay. She was immediately transferred to the infection isolation room and received supportive care and antiviral drugs of arbidol, lopinavir, and ritonavir. Her clinical condition improved gradually and her lymphocyte and thrombocyte counts normalised on day 20. At discharge on day 30, she had normal muscle strength in both arms and legs and return of tendon reflexes in both legs and feet. Her respiratory symptoms resolved as well. Oropharyngeal swab tests for SARS-CoV-2 were negative.",

Given the patient's travel history to Wuhan, where outbreaks of SARS-CoV-2 were occurring, she was probably infected during her stay in Wuhan. We consider that the virus was transmitted to her relatives during her hospital stay. Retrospectively, the patient's initial laboratory abnormalities (lymphocytopenia and thrombocytopenia), which were consistent with clinical characteristics of patients with COVID-19,2 indicated the presence of SARS-CoV-2 infection on admission. The early presentation of COVID-19 can be non-specific (fever in only 43\u00b78% of patients on admission2). Considering the temporal association, we speculate that SARS-CoV-2 infection might have been responsible for the development of Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome in this patient. Furthermore, the onset of Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome symptoms in this patient overlapped with the period of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Hence Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome associated with SARS-CoV-2 might follow the pattern of a parainfectious profile, instead of the classic postinfectious profile, as reported in Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome associated with Zika virus.3, 4\n",

Besides, the patient's fever and respiratory symptoms developed 7 days after the onset of Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome symptoms. Therefore, it is prudent to consider the alternative explanation that the patient coincidentally developed Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome of unknown cause and acquired SARS-CoV-2 infection nosocomially; although, there was no report of COVID-19 in the neurological ward during her stay nor in her close contacts (except for her two relatives).",
