It continued during the nineteenth century with the introduction of several more vaccines to control some viral and bacterial infections, but the major contributions occurred in the twentieth century.\n1\n Over 70 different infectious agents commonly cause disease in humans. Nearly all of these have been (or are now) the target of vaccine development. Currently, there are over 30 registered individual vaccines, approximately half of which are commonly used, mainly to prevent childhood infections and especially in many developed countries. Approximately one dozen candidate vaccines to prevent other diseases have passed stage 2 clinical trials.\n2\n, \n3\n\n",

Some countries have kept records of vaccine efficacy based on the changing incidence of some common childhood diseases; in the USA, data from as far back as 1912 are especially impressive. The incidence of disease during an epidemic some years before the vaccine became available has been compared with the incidence in the late 1990s, some years after the vaccine became available. The drop in incidence was: (i) 100% for indigenous poliomyelitis, (ii) >99% for diphtheria and measles, mumps, rubella (MMR) and (iii) >97% for tetanus.\n4\n, \n5\n Two or three doses of many vaccines are needed to achieve maximum protection.\n4\n Although many vaccines can give side\u2010effects, the great majority are minor and claims to the contrary are usually wrong. For example, claims that the MMR vaccine causes inflammatory bowel disease and autism have not been substantiated in at least 10 epidem\u00adiological studies.\n4\n\n",

In the drive to globally eradicate poliomyelitis, three major regions \u2212 the Americas, Europe and the Western Pacific \u2212 have now been declared free of endemic disease. However, global eradication is proving to be more difficult due, in part, to the occurrence of revertent strains, and the failure in some countries to maintain a high level of vaccination.

The first demonstration that the poor immuno\u00adgenicity of polysaccharides could be greatly enhanced by conjugating to a protein was in 1931;\n6\n approximately 30 years before the discovery of T lymphocytes. It also took a long time for the medical community to take advantage of the finding. The first polysaccharide : protein conjugate vaccine is the Haemophilus influenzae type b, which prevents subsequent disease in at least 95% of infants.\n7\n Three more recent successes, which in each case protected more than 90% of infants or children from invasive disease, are: (i) a seven valent (different specificities) Streptococcus pneumoniae conjugate vaccine,\n8\n (ii) a Neisseria menin\u00adgitidis, serogroup C conjugate vaccine\n9\n and (iii) a Salmonella typhi Vi carbohydrate conjugate vaccine.\n10\n The higher immunogenicity of the conjugates is due to the protein component inducing strong T\u2010helper cell activity in the very young.

Only a few thousand B cells make antibody molecules (and T cells) of exactly the same specificity.

Following an infection, the appropriate T and B cells are activated, mature and replicate to form many progeny cells, most of which die after the infection is cleared. However, pools of memory cells with those specificities are formed and persist. Over time, B memory cells are activated by contacting retained foreign antigen and become antibody\u2010secreting cells (ASC) or new memory cells. The net result is that, after an infection or immunisation/\u00advaccination, a specific antibody will be continually made for long periods, sometimes many years (decades). Pools of memory T cells are also made following an infection/\u00adimmunisation, however these persist as such until there is a second exposure to the same (or very similar) \u00adinfectious agent, when they may rapidly differentiate to a fully effector state.",

However, the antibody approach has not been successful to date with a growing number of agents, especially those displaying considerable antigenic variation like HIV\u20101. Thus, the amino acids in up to 30% of the envelope antigen (gp120) of HIV may vary, and as many as 10 different amino acids may be found at a few sites in one segment (the V3 loop of gp120 in isolates). After almost 20 years of intensive research, there are now available a few high titre (monoclonal) antibody preparations which neutralize the infectivity of a wide range of antigenically different HIV\u20101 field isolates. One of these (IgG1b12) prevents the binding of the virus to the main cellular receptor (CD4).

Cells infected with the chimeric virus produced the antigen(s) coded for by the inserted DNA. Immunisation of hosts with the chimeric virus induced strong antibody and T cell (including CTL) responses and protected against a challenge by the infectious agent that was the source of the foreign DNA.

The additional insertion of DNA coding for the interleukins (IL\u20104 or IL\u201012) into the vector induced a very strong antibody or effector T cell response, respectively.

Vaccination of infants in Taiwan with the hepatitis B virus vaccine specifically reduced the incidence of the liver cancer in 6\u221214 year old children by 50% and reduced the incidence of death due to this cancer by 70%.\n29\n Clinical trials of a candidate vaccine based on the antigen E7 (in the form of virus\u2010like particles) of the papilloma virus type 16 have recently concluded. All 41 cases of new HPV16 infection occurred in the placebo group.\n30\n Based on this excellent result, a phase III trial is being initiated with a tetravalent vaccine (strains HPV16, 18, 6 and 11). The first two types are responsible for >50% of cervical cancer; the last two types are linked to 90% of genital warts cases.\n31\n In a clinical trial in China, an aggregate of the L1 antigen of HPV type 6 and HPV type 11 induced strong antibody responses and caused complete regression of genital warts in 22 of 33 subjects.\n32\n However, there are at least 13 other HPV types that are considered carcinogenic,\n33\n so much work lies ahead to develop a more broadly protective vaccine. In addition, it now seems likely that vaccine formulations will be forthcoming, which control some of the malignancies caused by Epstein\u2212Barr virus infections such as Burkitt's lymphoma and nasopharyngeal carcinoma.\n34\n\n",

In 1930, Burnet proposed the concept of \u2018immunosurveillance\u2019 in which he postulated that the immune system would recognize many newly developing malignant cells as foreign, and would destroy them.\n35\n Tumours that did arise had escaped such recognition by, for example, mutation. Experiments with model systems that were available at the time \u2212 such as the \u2018nude\u2019 mouse (having few T cells) \u2212 did not support this concept, however it recently became possible to completely inactivate the murine adaptive system. When exposed to carcinogens, such mice develop more tumours than control mice,\n36\n thus substantiating Burnet's concept. However, this means that the spontaneous tumours that occur naturally are \u2018immunoselected\u2019 to resist an immunotherapeutic attack. Nevertheless, there are some encouraging findings based on developing strong CTL responses to tumour\u2010associated antigens. In small clinical trials in which strong CTL responses to melanoma antigens were induced, partial or complete remissions were achieved in approximately \u226430% of participants.\n37\n, \n38\n\n",

Many immuno\u00adtherapeutic approaches to control these diseases are currently under trial,\n40\n and some involve approaches that could be regarded as novel forms of vaccination. For example, in the case of autoimmune diseases, instead of inducing immunity, one approach is to induce specific tolerance to the target antigen by oral administration of the antigen. This approach has worked well in animal models but has been largely unsuccessful in humans. Another unusual approach is to immunise against the amino acid sequences (peptide epitopes) which confer specificity to the T cell receptors that recognize the antigens involved in the main autoimmune diseases.

It has been demonstrated that immunisation of BALB/c mice with plasmid DNA containing DNA segments coding for T cell epitopes in mites (Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus) induces a Th\u20101 response. The allergic reaction seen when the \u00adimmunised mice were later exposed to these allergens was much less than the response of control mice.\n43\n Non\u2010infectious childhood vaccines, such as diphtheria : acellular pertussis : tetanus (DaPT), preferentially induce a strong antibody response (Th\u20102), whereas a natural infection induces mainly a Th\u20101 response. Thus, recovery from natural measles infection reduced childhood incidence of allergic reactions to house dust mites to half that seen in vaccinated children.\n44\n The neonatal human immune system has a \u2018Th\u20102 bias\u2019 which slowly changes to a mixed Th\u20102/Th\u20101 response. The tetanus\u2010specific cytokine profile was found to be initially Th\u20102 strong following admini\u00adstration of the DaPT vaccine, however there was increasing IFN\u03b3 (a Th\u20101 cytokine) production over time (\u226418 months) in most infants. Those infants who did not switch to the Th\u20101/Th\u20102 profile and remained strongly Th\u20102 biased were found to come from families with a history of allergies.\n45\n The inoculation of such infants within the first year with one or two vaccines inducing a strong Th\u20101 response might correct this imbalance and protect from later allergies. A recent retrospective study has shown that children in Europe who live on farms \u2212 and are hence exposed to animal stables and farm (non\u2010pasteurized) milk in the first year of life \u2212 had a greatly reduced risk of allergic diseases in later life.\n46\n\n",
