Nevertheless, this is the first prospective study to reveal that RV infections involving the lower respiratory tract in LTRs predispose these patients to P. aeruginosa isolation (HR 8.54, 95% CI 1.54-47.4, p = 0.01). Although we did not statistically control for other effects, the results of our investigation support this notion.

Our methodological strategy has been used in other prospective studies (1, 11) , and the probability of this error is very unlikely because the infection rates are the highest described in the medical literature until now (7, 8, 11) .

The mean postoperative follow-up period was 3.4 years (IQR 2.5-4.0 years). The overall detection rate of RVs was 0.76 per patientyear (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.67-0.87), significantly lower than the rate in patients with symptomatic RV infection (2.08 per patient-year, 95% CI 1.77-2.43). The RV detection rate was 2.33 per patient-year (95% CI 1.89-2.84) for URTID, not significantly different from the rate of 1.79 per patient-year (95% CI 1.38-2.28) for LRTID.
