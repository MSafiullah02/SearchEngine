Although canine gestational time is consistent with the timing of hormone surges, it is not predictable based on the time from mating. In general, gestation length in dogs is relatively constant when measured from the beginning of ovulation or the ovulatory surge in luteinizing hormone (LH). Because the LH surge can be measured or estimated (via serial serum progestrone levels) with some accuracy, timing events with the LH surge as a reference point (day 0) can be helpful. The LH surge typically triggers ovulation within 2 days of the surge, and, if fertilization occurs, gestation is 64 to 66 days from the LH surge to parturition.",

The first estrous cycle in cats is at 6 to 12 months on average, but can be as early as 4 months. Cats are seasonally polyestrous and induced ovulators; ovulation will only occur with adequate coital stimulation. Multiple matings in cats can result in multiple ovulations and more than 1 sire in a litter of kittens. If the queen does not ovulate, an interestrus follows for 2 to 3 weeks, and the cycle repeats until fall. If she ovulates without proceeding to fertilization, metestrus or diestrus results for 30 to 40 days; if pregnant, this will last for 60 to 65 days.",

Suppression of prolactin release by dopamine agonists (bromocriptine, cabergoline) shortens the duration of anestrus and induces estrus in animals with prolonged anestrus.30, 31 The dopamine agonist, bromocriptine, was the first prolactin inhibitor studied in dogs for estrus induction, but resulted in significant vomiting in dogs.25, 32 A newer agent, cabergoline (Galastop, Dostinex), has been shown to induce estrus in most bitches (0.005 mg/kg orally daily, until 3-8 days after onset of proestrus or day 40) with fewer side effects.3, 33 The drug is available in generic form (Par Pharmaceutical, Inc., Woodcliff Lake, NJ), but remains relatively expensive ($160.00/8 tabs or approximately $20.00/tab) and difficult to dose accurately in small dogs. Cabergoline is only available as a 0.5-mg tablet that is inactivated over time in aqueous solutions containing water. For accurate dosing of small animals, tablets can either be compounded into the appropriate-strength capsules, or a portion of the tablet can be crushed and diluted with fluid just before dosing. McLean and coworkers also report that cabergoline is stable for 28 days if compounded in acidic fluids (1% acetic acid solution).34\n",

Currently, no commercially available replacement exists. Compounding pharmacies have attempted to provide deslorelin in various formulations. BET Compounding Pharmacy (Lexington, KY) makes an injectable deslorelin in a proprietary sustained-release vehicle (BioRelease) that contains 1.5 mg/mL of deslorelin. The drug is not Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved and lacks the stringent oversight of an FDA manufacturer's approved facility.",

GnRH agonists (leuprolide, lutrelin, deslorelin) have been shown to suppress gonadal activity in both male and female dogs with few side effects. The agonists act by causing a downregulation of the GnRH receptors. Chronic suppression of LH and FSH concentrations and suppression of gonadal hormone secretion and gametogenesis occur. The final result is a chemical castration of males and a protracted anestrus in females, which is reversible. Clinical trials of 2 products (Suprelorin; Peptech Animal Health, Macquarie Park, Australia, and Gonazon CR; Intervet, Boxmeer, Netherlands) have shown efficacy, but neither is available commercially in the United States.

Bitches and queens with good breeding potential (less than 5 years of age, healthy) whose owners decline ovariohysterectomy can be offered new agents and techniques that have been attempted with some success. Naturally occurring prostaglandins (PGF-2\u03b1) have been administered to cause luteolysis and evacuation of uterine contents in open pyometra, but should not be used in closed pyometra because of the potential for uterine rupture. PGE (misoprostol) can be administered intravaginally (1-3 \u03bcg/kg every 12-24 hours) in an attempt to relax the cervix before PGF-2\u03b1 administration. Synthetic prostaglandins have been used in canine patients to date, including cloprostenol and alfaprostol. Synthetic prostaglandin are more specific for uterine smooth muscle, causing fewer observed side effects (nausea, diarrhea, cramping, panting). Prostaglandins stimulate uterine contractions and variably relax the cervix, causing evacuation and drainage of purulent uterine contents. The dose of prostaglandin depends on the drug used. The lowest effective dose should be used; this has not been established in all cases. PGF-2\u03b1 is administered at 0.1 mg/kg SC every 12 hours for 48 hours, then at 0.2 mg/kg SC every 12 hours to effect. Cloprostenol is administered at 1 to 3 \u03bcg/kg every 12 to 24 hours. Therapy may be necessary for 7 to 10 days.61, 64, 65 Side effects after the initial doses can include restlessness, panting, vomiting, elevated heart rate, fever, and defecation. To clear the uterus of infected material, prostaglandin administration should be continued as long as abnormal fluid is seen within the uterine lumen ultrasonographically. Progesterone levels should fall to <2 ng/mL.",

Seroprevalence rates range from 1% to 6% in many areas of the United States, but may be much higher in the South. In Peru and Mexico, rates have been reported to be as high as 25% in dogs.91\nB. canis is a Gram-negative intracellular coccobacillus that is spread by inhalation, oral ingestion, or contact with the fetus or fetal membranes after abortions/stillbirths of infected fetuses. Venereal transmission or transmission through the genital, oronasal, or conjunctival mucosa also occurs.92 Abortion occurs between 45 and 59 days of pregnancy. B. canis is most prevalent in large breeding kennels where contact with infective discharges or fetal tissues occurs. Because there is no permanent cure for B. canis, infected animals must be eliminated from breeding. The infection affects both females and males. Males may develop chronic prostatitis and orchitis/epididymitis, which can continue to shed bacteria for months. Although some dogs may clear the infection, others may remain bacteremic for years. In large kennels, testing for this organism is recommended on a routine basis, which may help prevent the further spread of disease. Kennels should only be considered clear of disease if all animals test negative for 3 months. Eradication is difficult and may take 5 to 7 months in closed kennels and may never be achieved in open kennels. Privately owned bitches should be tested before each breeding, and stud dogs annually. Even maiden bitches should be tested before breeding because of the potential for oronasal mucosal transmission.",

Dogs are a natural reservoir of the organism. B. canis can live in areas with high humidity, low temperatures, and no sunlight for long periods of time. It can live in water, aborted fetuses, feces, equipment, and clothing for several months. The most common route of human infection is via aerosolization of contaminated dust or dirt, or direct contact with canine abortion products or infected vaginal discharge via mucous membranes or abraded skin. It may also be transmitted via ingestion from contaminated hands or if an infected dog is allowed to lick around the face or mouth.",

Doxycycline with rifampin was found to be better than quinolones with rifampin. Combination therapy with 2 or 3 antibiotics was better than single-agent therapy, particularly if an aminoglycoside was included.

An epidural often requires further sedation of animals, but avoids anesthetic exposure of the fetuses. It is inexpensive, produces minimal depression in the newborn, and allows the mother to return to preanesthetic alertness rapidly. Clinical expertise in the administration of an epidural is necessary. Lidocaine 2% without epinephrine is the most common local anesthetic administered. If given as an epidural, neonatal blood concentrations should be minor. Disadvantages of epidural anesthesia include respiratory depression or arrest if the epidural block advances to the anterior thoracic or cervical area. Hypotension, bradycardia, hypothermia, cord laceration, spontaneous movements of the head and front limbs, and difficulty in epidural needle placement can occur. If respiratory problems occur, it may not be possible to intubate the mother without the use of a general anesthetic. General anesthesia therefore remains the technique of choice.115, 116 After the epidural, incoordination of the dam can be problematic, contributing to trauma of the neonates if adequate supervision is not performed.",

Burke and Roberson demonstrated the efficacy of fenbendazole granules (50 mg/kg orally once daily starting at 40 days' gestation through day 14 postpartum) against Toxocara canis and Ancylostoma caninum.133 This resulted in 89% fewer roundworms and 99% fewer hookworms in pups born to medicated dams. Efficacy was shown to be schedule dependent, such that if treatment was stopped the day of parturition, there was only a 64% reduction in roundworms and an 88% reduction in hookworms. A reduction in hookworm burden (85%) of second litter pups to bitches initially treated with fenbendazole but without further treatment was also noted.133 Albendazole and oxfendazole at doses of 100 mg/kg orally, starting at day 30 of pregnancy through days 12 to 18 after parturition, also appear to prevent T. canis infections in pups.134, 135 Fenbendazole is also highly effective (90%-100%) against Giardia at doses normally used to also eliminate roundworms, hookworms, whipworms, and tape worms (50 mg/kg orally \u00d7 3 days; nonpregnant animals). Both albendazole and mebendazole and, potentially, fenbendazole, are excreted into human and animal breast milk (2%-10%), but the negligible bioavailability of the parent drugs suggests that clinically significant amounts do not occur.136, 137 Ideally, because fenbendazole is labeled for use in pregnancy, this may be the preferred drug in pregnant animals.",

Ideally, this must be considered on a case-by-case basis, especially with the risk for potential infections. In general, certain viruses, such as parvovirus, last for years in the soil and without any protection, or low-level protection from maternal antibodies, and young pups may quickly succumb to the virus. Even with early- and high-frequency vaccinations of pups, they are still susceptible before boosters are complete. Ideally, serologic testing of such dams to establish if adequate antibodies are present can be performed. However, one must remember that serologic testing is not always a good indicator of the potential immunity for some viruses and that a low titer might not indicate the dam's ability to mount an anamnestic response once challenged. If the risk of exposure is high (such as in an animal shelter), then vaccination is indicated against potentially fatal diseases (canine and feline distemper, parvovirus). The use of recombinant vaccines is ideal in this scenario. General Vaccine Guidelines for Shelters should be followed here as outlined in the 2006 American Animal Hospital Association Canine Task Force Vaccine Guidelines (www.aahanet.org). Immediate vaccination of all dogs older than 6 weeks with core vaccines (3-4 weeks in cases of disease outbreak) is highly recommended as long as the animal is not sick or under physiologic stress.",

A number of killed (inactivated) parvovirus vaccines that are currently recommended for use in pregnancy include: Parvocine (BioCor, Yardley, PA), Performer (Agri Labs, Central Hawkes Bay, New Zealand), Vanguard (Pfizer, New York, NY), ImunoVax (RXV, Memphis, TN) and Canlan (FD, Fort Dodge, IA). Killed vaccines do not replicate in the bitch like the modified live vaccine viruses, but often contain a large amount of reactive adjuvants. This increases the risk of allergic reactions, including anaphylaxis. Although uncommon in a pregnant animal, any sudden cardiovascular collapse or alteration of blood pressure can potentially result in death of the bitch or her fetuses.",

Finasteride, a synthetic 5 alpha-reductase inhibitor used in human medicine, has more recently been evaluated in dogs. At a dose of 5 mg/kg orally for 8 to 53 weeks, the drug decreased serum dihydrotestosterone concentrations to baseline values and decreased prostatic size and semen volume, with no adverse effects on semen quality or testosterone concentrations.161, 165, 166 The drug is not approved in dogs in the United States but was very well tolerated with no adverse effects.

TMS is sometimes associated with severe side effects (aplastic anemia, keratoconjunctivitis sicca, polyarthritis), particularly when given long term or at high doses. Ciprofloxacin penetrates well into human prostate tissues, but its prostate:blood concentration ratios are not as high as enrofloxacin in dogs. Canine prostatic fluid tends to be more acidic than in humans, so that agents such as fluoroquinolones may be less active.62 If a Gram-positive organism is suspected, erythromycin, clindamycin, or trimethoprim can be given empirically. Treatment is long term for up to 4 to 6 weeks.62 Castration is also recommended to reduce the risks of future infections and shorten the infection duration. For some infections such as Brucella canis, high-dose, long-term enrofloxacin (> 30 days) or multi-drug therapy with an aminoglycoside (2 weeks) in combination with oral doxycycline or minocycline +/\u2212 rifampin for an additional 2 weeks (see antibiotic section) is recommended to successfully clear the infection.",

Furthermore, few new drugs have been extensively studied in canine and feline patients, and most are not labeled for reproductive indications. The use of older agents (estrogens, DES, antiestrogens, and so forth) for estrous induction and pregnancy termination are associated with significant risks to the patient and should be avoided.
