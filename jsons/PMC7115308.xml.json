This compliance rate was compared with those of other institutions in the project, so that we could benchmark our performance.

            "text": "The project had 3 arms: daily care process, early mobility, and low tidal volume ventilation. Participation could be in 1, 2, or all 3 of the arms (Fig 1\n). Our hospital selected daily care process and early mobility, because low tidal volume ventilation was already a standard practice in our ICUs for all patients on MV.I.Daily Care Processa.\nEndotracheal tube with subglottic suctioning (SUB-G EET)\n\nAll patients anticipated to need MV for >48 hours were intubated with a TaperGuard evacuation oral tracheal tube (Covidien, Mansfield, MA). The data collectors inspected patients for the presence of SUB-G EET when indicated and documented whether the subglottic drainage lumen was connected to the wall suction at the appropriate intermittent negative pressure.12\n\nb.\nHead of bed (HOB) \u226530\u00b0\n\nThe hospital was equipped with Hill-Rom hospital beds (Hill-Rom, Chicago, IL). The angle of the HOB was measured with an electronic device or built-in protractor present on the bed. Elevation of the HOB was the default order for all patients on MV. Exceptions were hypotension; unstable physiological status; low cardiac index; recent cervical, thoracic, or lumbar surgery or instability; ventricular assist device; intra-aortic balloon pump; open abdomen; and patient refusal.12 This element required that the data collector directly observe the angle of the HOB.\nc..\nSpontaneous Awakening Trials (SAT)\n\nA nurse-led sedation vacation protocol was implemented that allowed the nurse to stop all sedation at 8:00 a.m. if the patient fulfilled certain criteria.12 The SAT was continued until either the patient was agitated or fully awake and could be assessed for delirium. For this element, the data collectors asked the bedside nurse whether sedation was interrupted. They then reviewed the patient\u2019s daily flow sheet to confirm the nurse's statement. If the chart did not reflect sedation interruption, then this bundle was considered noncompliant.\nd.\nSedation-minimized (Sedation Score target)\n\nSedation orders were entered via a standardized computer order set, with dosage adjusted based on the patient\u2019s weight and renal and hepatic functions. In addition, a target sedation score (Richmond Agitation-Sedation Scale [RASS]) had to be assigned to the patient by the physician before the order could be completed. The targeted RASS was addressed daily in rounds, and the nurse\u2019s documentation was examined to determine whether the patient's actual sedation score matched the planned target.\ne.\nSpontaneous Breathing Trials (SBTs)\n\nA ventilator weaning protocol was drafted that allowed respiratory therapists to wean all patients on MV starting at 9:00 a.m., 1 hour after the sedation was held. Patients who met the following criteria were weaned to pressure support ventilation:\n\u2022Awake or off sedation with RASS \u22653 or for >1 hour\u2022Spontaneous inspiratory efforts\u2022Oxygen saturation >88%\u2022FiO2 \u22640.5\u2022PEEP <8 cm H2O\nThe spontaneous breathing trial was conducted by placing the patient on pressure support (5-8 cm H2O) with or without 5 cm H2O PEEP. Both the patient's ICU flow sheet and respiratory therapist's notes were monitored to assess this element.\nf.\nDelirium assessment\n\nThe CAM-ICU advocated by the Society of Critical Care Medicine was used to evaluate for delirium. In our hospital the assessment tool was translated into Arabic, and, after a validation process of several Plan-Do-Study-Act cycles, staff were trained to perform this appraisal. The CAM-ICU score was recorded at 10 a.m. daily and documented7:\n\u2022P if the patient is positive for delirium based on CAM-ICU assessment\u2022N if the patient is negative for delirium based on CAM-ICU assessment\u2022UTA if unable to assess (ie, RASS = \u22124 or \u22125)\u2022X if CAM-ICU assessment was not completed\u2022NK if CAM-ICU was completed, but results are not known\u2022NK was also used if it was not known whether the CAM-ICU was performedII.Early Mobilitya.\nMobility\u2014tailor goals to maximize mobility\n\nAll patients admitted to the ICU had standing orders for physical therapy (PT) and occupational therapy as part of the admission order sets. The level of mobility (0 to 8) was recorded: 0: passively rolled or exercised; 1: transfer from bed to chair without standing; 2: sitting in bed/exercising in bed; 3: sitting at edge of bed; 4: standing with or without assistance; 5: transfer from bed to chair with standing; 6: marching in place; 7: walking at least 4 steps; and 8: unknown what level of activity occurred. Additionally, any perceived barrier to achieving a higher level of mobility was documented.\n",

VAE surveillance has a quality metric character and appears to identify potential safety opportunities to improve care and outcomes for patients.19 Theoretically, interventions most likely to prevent VAEs are those that help patients avoid intubation, minimize the duration of MV, or prevent the conditions that most commonly trigger a VAE (pneumonia, volume overload, acute respiratory distress syndrome, and atelectasis).20 Use of high-flow nasal oxygen for hypoxemic and noninvasive ventilation for hypercapnic respiratory failure may avoid intubation. Minimizing sedation, performing daily coordinated SATs and SBTs, and perhaps early mobility are strategies to decrease the duration of MV. Strategies to prevent pneumonia, volume overload, acute respiratory distress syndrome, and atelectasis include HOB elevation, conservative fluid management, conservative blood transfusion thresholds, low tidal volume ventilation, and early mobility.14 These interventions are consistent with the best care practices advocated by the ABCDEF bundle, the Surviving Sepsis Campaign, and the Society for Healthcare Epidemiology of America's recommendations to prevent VAP.21, 22, 23 Growing data support that implementing and optimizing these practices can lower VAE rates and improve patient outcomes.

Goddard and colleagues,28 using a Theoretical Domains Framework of behavior change, found that the social influences domain (local champions, ICU leadership, discord between team members and family members) and behavioral regulation domain (feedback and having a unit protocol) may act as barriers or facilitators to early rehabilitation. Based on these findings, we formulated a multidisciplinary team and a mobility protocol to provide tools to standardize the care of our patients (Appendix 1).",

Despite its strengths, our study has several potential limitations. First, a reduction in VAE rates might be beyond the effect of just implementing the bundle, because the VAE rates might have decreased secondary to other simultaneous infection control projects in our ICUs. Second, this was not a preintervention and postintervention study, so analyzing the full effect of the bundle is difficult. Third, despite having standardized data collection techniques and sources, team members might be motivated to demonstrate improvement and potentially could bias results. Fourth, we report VAE rates per 1,000 ventilator days, and any intervention that decreases ventilator days may paradoxically increase VAE rates and underestimate the impact of the intervention on VAE outcomes. Fifth, ICU LOS may depend on multiple complex factors and not only VAEs. Finally, the data represent a cohort study from a single center, and our inventions might not be generalized to other institutions.",
