Around every fifth patient develops a severe pneumonia with dyspnea, tachypnea and disturbed gas exchange. Approximately every fourth of these patients, i.e. 5% of all infected patients, is critically ill with severe lung dysfunction, need for ventilation, shock or extrapulmonary organ failure [12, 13]. There are no reliable data regarding the additional group of symptom-free or weakly symptomatic cases that have not been tested (Fig. 3). If this group is sufficiently large\u2014as often assumed\u2014increased testing of mildly symptomatic patients will lead to a shift of the frequencies described above in favor of the milder cases. On the other hand, severely ill patients will be more often recorded in scenarios with limited testing, therefore presenting a larger proportion of severe cases. This phenomenon is probably responsible for the high number of severe courses and fatal outcomes in relation to the total number of confirmed cases in Italy (10% critically ill patients), the USA and Iran.",

The median incubation period from exposition to onset of first symptoms is 4 days (interquartile range, IQR 2\u20137 days), maximum incubation period is assumed by the RKI to be 14 days; however, there are case reports showing longer incubation periods of up to 19 or 24 days. A median of 10 days from onset of symptoms to admission to the ICU has been reported, from the time of infection it takes nearly 2 weeks (Fig. 4). This is of considerable relevance for calculating the expected need of ICU beds based on the current epidemiological situation. Faster and slower progression have been reported as well, presumably depending on the specific health care system. Critical courses tend to have a faster progression than milder cases.",

For SARS-CoV\u20112 that situation is different; most infections take place outside hospital. Among other reasons, this is due to the fact that contagiousness and infectiousness of mildly symptomatic patients and probably also of asymptomatic infected persons are higher [17]; however, for epidemiological reasons and also because the risk they present for staff, including related fears and impairment to healthcare system functionality, nosocomial infections are still important and need to be minimized by suitable measures. According to official figures, in China 3.8% of all cases were medical staff, corresponding to approximately 2000 cases. In the Italian region of Lombardy, it was officially stated at the beginning of March that 10% of all physicians and nurses were tested positive for SARS-CoV\u20112 and were not available for patient care. A case series with 138 patients in a university hospital in Wuhan has shown an infection rate of 29% of the medical staff, and the incidence of nosocomial infections among patients was 12% [6, 11]. The majority of infections took place on the general wards; only 2 cases were reported for ICU. A quarter of nosocomial cases in medical staff and fellow patients were traced back to a single patient who was admitted to the general surgery department because of primarily abdominal symptoms.",

Using eye protection (safety goggles or visor) in addition to normal safety equipment has been proven to provide a significant reduction of nosocomial transmission in the SARS epidemic [18] and is thus suggested in the care of COVID-19 patients. Wearing medical headgear does not offer additional protection, but it might help reduce unintentional hand-face contact and makes putting on the protective equipment without contamination easier. Make sure that FFP2/3 masks sit tightly; bearded men may require shaving. Figure 6 shows a complete protection equipment as an example. Putting on the protection gear in a correct way, and in particular taking it off without contamination, requires training. Ideally, pictured instructions are available in each double door system changing area. If available, a powered air-purifying respirator (PAPR) can of course be used, especially for activities or in areas with particularly high risks.",

The risk for assistant personnel was at least as high as for the intubating person [19]. It must, however, be stated that at least in Canada intubation standards with nebulization of topical anesthetics and without muscle relaxants were apparently used [21]. Interestingly enough, applying ECG electrodes was also associated with a high risk [18].",

Patients who are not yet intubated should wear mouth-nose protection until induction and also immediately after end of anesthesia. Because of the risk situations at applying the monitoring, intubation and extubation as described, only experienced staff in small teams wearing full personal protection should be deployed [23]. Entering the operating suite via holding areas and leaving via recovery rooms must be avoided. By analogy to flu, bag valve masks and tubes should be changed when using a respiratory gas filter [24].

Sometimes clinical signs of dyspnea may be missing even in cases of severe hypoxia, especially in older patients [15]. At least in the specific situation in Hubei, in China most severe oxygenation failures with an oxygenation index <100 mm Hg [8, 12] were already present when patients were admitted to ICU. Treatment with noninvasive ventilation or high-flow oxygen, as has become established for primary hypoxemic lung failure in the last few years, is critically discussed for COVID-19 treatment and many experts reject this approach [12, 22, 25]. Success rates in critically ill COVID-19-patients are limited, delayed intubation is associated with poor outcome and the treatment as well as a possibly necessary emergency intubation in cases of treatment failure increase the risk for transmission to staff [8, 12, 15, 22]; however, in situations with an imbalanced resources-needs ratio, this approach could help bridge the time until decision-making and intubation, or it could also be a therapeutic option in cases of lacking ventilatory capacities. For ARDS therapy, the commonly known intensive care principles apply, as e.g. documented in the S3 guidelines invasive ventilation. Classical rescue therapies for severe oxygenation failure, such as recruitment, relaxation and prone positioning are primarily successful in most patients [12, 15]. In the course of time some of the patients develop severe hypercapnia of unknown origin [12]. Barotrauma, often observed in SARS, has been reported only in single cases; however, this might result from a trend towards more lung-protective ventilator settings compared to 2003 [8].",
