United State Food Drug Administration (US FDA) urgently gave the Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) permission for remdesivir in COVID-19 on May 1, 2020. The current EUA have permitted the use of remdesivir only to treat adults and children with suspected or laboratory confirmed COVID-19 and severe disease defined as SpO2 \u2264 94% on room air, requiring supplemental oxygen, mechanical ventilation, or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) in an in-patient hospital setting [16] . Historically, this would be the third time USFDA has given any drug to have a EUA in human, in the absence of approved indication, pending the results from a large robust trial. Interestingly, earlier on March 30, 2020, FDA also gave EUA to chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine in the treatment of COVID-19, in the absence of approved indication [17] . In the past, an investigational neuraminidase inhibitor -peramivir was given EUA by the FDA Nevertheless, this prompted us to conduct a systematic search of remdesivir to understand its pharmacology, safety and efficacy in patients with COVID-19.",

SBECD is used in the formulation as a solubilizing agent due to the limited aqueous solubility of remdesivir.

Pharmacologically, remdesivir has been designed to efficiently deliver the monophosphate nucleoside analog GS-441524 into cells. Inside the cells, the GS-441524 monophosphate undergoes rapid conversion to the pharmacologically active nucleoside triphosphate form GS-443902. Nucleoside triphosphate GS-443902 acts as an analog of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) and competes with the natural ATP substrate to selectively inhibit viral RNAdependent RNA polymerase (RdRp). The primary mechanism of inhibition is the incorporation of the nucleoside triphosphate GS-443902 into nascent RNA chains by viral RdRp, causing delayed RNA chain termination during the process of viral replication [4]. In summary, remdesivir is a prodrug and inhibits viral RNA polymerases, when intracellularly metabolized to an ATP analogue.",

Clinical improvement was defined as a two-point improvement on a 6-point ordinal scale (as mentioned above in study by Grein et al). Moreover, no significant difference in 28-day mortality observed between the remdesivir and placebo (14% death in remdesivir vs. 13% in placebo group; \u2206 1.1%, 95% CI, -8.1 to 10.3%) group. No difference in viral load exhibited between the two arms. Neither any difference in outcome was observed in patient receiving remdesivir early (within 10 days of illness) or late (after 10 days of illness). It should be noted that this trial was stopped early after recruiting 236 patients due to the lack of eligible patient in Wuhan, although it was powered for the inclusion of 453 patients. This early stop may have made this a statistically underpowered trial to have any conclusive result. Nevertheless, it was calculated that even if 453 patients would have been recruited, this trial could not have demonstrated any benefit [22]. Collectively, this suggest that despite an available result from a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, we still do not know the benefit or harm of remdesivir, compared to the placebo in patients with severe COVID-19. Another DBRCT of remdesivir in mild to moderate COVID-19 patients (n=308) conducted in China is expected anytime soon [23]. Meanwhile on April 29, 2020, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), announced an interim result of a randomized, controlled trial named ACTT (Adaptive COVID-19 Treatment Trial) involving 1063 patients (NCT04280705) that started on Feb 21, 2020 and closed on April 19, 2020 for new enrollments.

            "text": "summarize the comparison of results from both pre-clinical and clinical studies of these 4 repurposed candidate drugs. Animal studies clearly hinted that early administration of remdesivir was more effective like other acute viral diseases. From this point of view, treating patients those already have respiratory failure, may not represent the optimal use of remdesivir. However, since viral shedding in COVID-19 and intensive care tend to be more protracted, even late administration could be useful. In this regard, FDA has currently authorized remdesivir only in severe COVID-19 in both adults and children. With regards to the outcome of remdesivir in COVID-19, while one RCT found no benefit, preliminary results from other RCT have shown some benefit. Therefore, the overall outcome with remdesivir is perhaps in a stage of clinical equipoise at this point of time. The safety profile of remdesivir in COVID-19 is incompletely characterized in COVID-19. While the safety data from the previous use during acute EVD suggest no specific alarm, COVID-19 differs profoundly in its clinical characteristics from EVD. Nevertheless, hitherto no safety findings allows remdesivir to be used in COVID-19, under a proper pharmacovigilance. Special attention should be given for disproportionate rise in ALT or decrease in GFR during the treatment with remdesivir. The current contraindication of starting remdesivir with concomitant vasopressors use is primarily based on this being an indication of end organ failure. In contrast, once a patient initiates treatment with remdesivir, subsequent use of vasopressors is not a reason for discontinuation of remdesivir. Moreover, the use of vasopressor at low/medium doses for inotropic support due to the use of sedation and paralytics while on the ventilator is allowed.",
