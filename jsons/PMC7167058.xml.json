Subsequent isolation of PRVs were made from bats and patients first in Malaysia [Pritchard et al., 2005; Chua et al., 2007, 2008, 2011], followed by isolation from patients after visiting Bali, Indonesia which is geographically near Malaysia [Wong et al., 2012; Yamanaka et al., 2014; Lorusso et al., 2015] and from different species of bats in China [Du et al., 2010; Hu et al., 2014]. Clinical presentation of the patients ranged from acute respiratory syndrome to mild influenza\u2010like illness. Up until now, all these studies were conducted on individual patients. Here, we report a prevalence study by molecular detection of PRV from oropharyngeal swabs of out\u2010patients suffering from acute respiratory tract infections in Rembau, Malaysia. Phylogenetic analysis using partial gene sequences indicated that the PRVs detected in this study have great genetic relatedness to each other as well as to PRVs previously isolated in Malaysia.",

The epidemiological details and the clinical features of the six patients randomly select for this analysis are given in Table I. As shown in Figure S1, sequence alignment of these regions indicates that although they are high related to each other and to the other known PRVs previously detected in Malaysia, they are not identical to each other. Furthermore, phylogenetic analyses based on these partial gene sequences revealed two important findings. First, all the PRV sequences detected in the six independent specimens are closely related, but not completely identical (see Table SI). Second, the PRVs detected in this study are more related to Malaysian/Indonesian PRVs than to other PRVs (92\u201399% and 97\u201398% similarity to sigma1/A and sigma2/B proteins of Melaka virus, respectively). In addition, comparing the phylogenetic topology (Fig. 1) of the two gene segments among the six different PRVs detected in this study, it is plausible to conclude that reassortment between PRVs occurs at a high frequency.",

This study demonstrated that PRV infection is more common than expected, at least in this region of Malaysia. The new finding should be taken into consideration in future diagnosis and treatment of patients with URTI in bat\u2010populated areas in Malaysia and neighboring Southeast Asian nations. On reviewing patients' histories, approximately 90% of the patients did not reveal history of direct contacts with bats and, therefore, the mode of transmission of PRV is yet to be determined. It is worth to note that human\u2010to\u2010human transmission of PRV has been observed previously in at least two independent studies [Chua et al., 2007, 2008]. In this context, it will also be important to determine in future studies whether similar incident rate of PRV infection is also present in URTI patients in other regions or states in Malaysia where no bats or different bats are in circulation.",

First, as shown in Figure S1, the sequences from different samples were not identical (as one would expect from laboratory contamination). Second, the positive samples were randomly distributed, rather than clustered (e.g., for the first 20 samples, #1, 3, 5, 7, 12, and 15 were positive and the rest were negative).
