It has caused worldwide outbreaks, resulting in 8102 cases in 29 countries, with 744 fatalities in 2003.\n1\n SARS\u2013CoV belongs to the Coronaviridae genus, and hepatitis C virus (HCV) belongs to the Flaviviridae genus. These are two different viruses, but both are positive single strain RNA viruses (+ssRNA), which have some similar characteristics in immune responses that might offer some insight into the treatment of SARS.",

These results suggest that interferon alpha and glycyrrhizin could be beneficial in SARS treatment. Similarly, interferon alpha and glycyrrhizin are also effective in treating HCV infections.\n9\n, \n10\n Glycyrrhizin lowers serum ALT during treatment, reduces the inflammation of HCV infection, and prevents the development of hepatoma.\n9\n, \n10\n Glycyrrhizin has fewer side\u2010effects and seems more effective than ribavirin in treating HCV infections. Taken together, these results suggest that SARS\u2013CoV and HCV might have similar immunopathogenesis.",

This suggests that the host immune response in early SARS infection might favor viral replication, but 2\u20133 weeks after SARS\u2013CoV infection, the host immune response can induce specific immunity for virus clearance or immune\u2010mediated damage. Based on the skewed immune responses, we therefore postulate to use interferon alpha in the early stage of SARS infection to deviate Th2 predominant reaction to Th1 reaction, and hold back corticosteroids until appearance of late exacerbation showing augmented Th1 response.",
