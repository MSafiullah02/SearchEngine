In this work, we present a general multi-group SEIRA model for representing 15 the spread of COVID-19 among a heterogeneous population and test it in a numerical case of study.

From the first self-isolation measures to total lock-downs and quarantines for preventing 23 its spreading, the way humans interact has changed, and probably, for good. Joined efforts from the scientific 24 community have helped to design strategies for supporting public-health policies, and for providing a better 25 understanding of the current scenario. In particular, several mathematical models have been proposed in 26 recent weeks to fit public databases on the SARS-CoV2 outbreak and forecast its evolution. Despite their 27 particularities, most of them evolve from the well-known SIR model proposed by Kermack and McKendrick 28 (1927) . The basic idea behind this model, and its variants, is to divide a population in different compartments, 29 representing the S (susceptible), E (exposed), I (infected), A (asymptomatic), R (recovered), D (dead), Q (quarantined), among other fractions of it. Centering our analysis on the spread of COVID-19, and restricting 31 our search to those models recently proposed, we may find different combinations of the variables mentioned 32 above. 33 Even though research has been done on SIR and SIRD models for COVID-19, with different levels of Nevertheless, the different models listed above do not account for the several factors that could result in a 53 heterogeneous spread of the infection in the population. Barriers can be risen by the geo-spatial configuration 54 of a country and differential connectivity between its regions, or even by the way the different communities 55 or social classes interact in a city. Even though work has been done in multi-group SIR models (Hethcote In this work, we present a general multi-group SEIRA model for representing the spread of novel COVID-19 60 through populations with heterogeneous characteristics, such as a heavily centralized organization with poor 61 connections between the provinces, substantial social inequality among the population, or age/behavioral 62 groups. Due to the generality of our model, we can easily modify it to account for different particularities of 63 any population. In our model, we represent the interactions between the different groups by a non-necessarily 64 symmetrical matrix connecting the different sub-groups, accounting for the fraction that effectively interacts.",

There exists an incubation period for the virus, which average has been reported to range between 5.2 74 days (Li et al., 2020a; Lauer and Grantz, 2020) and 6.4 days (Backer et al., 2020). This fact justifies 75 the existence of a compartment E (exposed). The asymptomatic fraction of a given population, which varies from 29% (Li et al., 2020b), going through 77 50% (Mizumoto et al., 2020) and rising between 50 and 75% (Day, 2020), will be considered constant \u03b1. 78 This hypothesis makes sense if the size of the population and its immunological characteristics are 79 homogeneous.
