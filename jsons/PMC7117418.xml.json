            "text": "Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV), a single-stranded, positive-sense RNA virus, is characterized by a high mutation rate with the potential of genetically diverse strains evolving over time (Forsberg et al., 2001, Hanada et al., 2005, Pirzadeh et al., 1998, Rowland et al., 1999). In the past, PRRSV isolates have emerged within the swine population with varying degrees of virulence (Fang et al., 2007, Han et al., 2006, Nelsen et al., 1999) possibly due to a high degree of mutation and recombination (Yuan et al., 1999, Yuan et al., 2000, Yuan et al., 2001, Yuan et al., 2004). More recently, attention has focused on the occurrence of high mortality in Chinese swine herds which was associated with novel PRRSV isolates and described as porcine high fever disease in 2006 (Tian et al., 2007, Tong et al., 2007, Wu et al., 2009). The PRRSV isolates involved in porcine high fever disease contained unique nucleotide differences compared to other isolates. Specifically, a discontinuous, 30 amino acid deletion was identified within the nsp2 region which was initially suggested to be correlated with the pathogenicity of the virus (Tian et al., 2007, Wu et al., 2009). However, more recent reports have concluded that this deletion is unrelated to virulence (Zhou et al., 2009) in spite of the high mortality that was initially associated with this PRRSV variant (Tian et al., 2007, Tong et al., 2007). Interestingly, analysis of 582 samples from affected pigs resulted in the identification of PRRSV, porcine circovirus type 2 (PCV2) and classical swine fever virus as the most common co-infection pathogens, suggesting that a potential synergistic interaction among these viruses may account for the unusually high mortality (Lv et al., 2008, Wu et al., 2009).",

            "text": "PCV2 is a small, circular, non-enveloped DNA virus belonging to the Circoviridae family in the genus Circovirus. PCV2 can be further divided into several subtypes of which PCV2a and PCV2b are prevalent worldwide (Patterson and Opriessnig, 2010). To date, experimental infections comparing PCV2a and PCV2b in gnotobiotic and conventional pigs have not demonstrated major differences in virulence (Beach et al., 2010, Fort et al., 2008, Lager et al., 2007, Opriessnig et al., 2008b). PCV2 is the cause of porcine circovirus associated disease (PCVAD) with multiple clinical manifestations including respiratory disease (Harms et al., 2002). PRRSV has become an important component of the porcine respiratory disease complex (PRDC) with major economic impact on the swine industry (Chae, 2005). Retrospective studies identified PRRSV as the most common cofactor in cases of PCVAD (Pallar\u00e9s et al., 2002). Experimental coinfection with PRRSV and PCV2 has yielded mixed results. One study completed in 2002 reported minimal clinical disease or death loss in conventional pigs coinfected with PCV2 and PRRSV (Rovira et al., 2002). In contrast, in another study, severe clinical disease and death in 10 of 11 pigs between 10 and 21 days post-infection (dpi) was reported in dually infected, caesarian-derived and colostrum-deprived (CDCD) pigs (Harms et al., 2001). Despite differences in severity of clinical presentation, experimental coinfection of pigs with PCV2 and PRRSV has consistently resulted in up-regulation of PCV2 replication (enhanced viremia and PCV2 tissue load) and increased severity of PRRSV-induced lesions in lung tissues (Allan et al., 2000, Harms et al., 2001, Rovira et al., 2002).",

The objective of this study was to characterize the infection dynamics and pathogenicity of two different type 2 PRRSV isolates in a conventional pig model under the influence of concurrent PCV2a or PCV2b infection. The severity of clinical disease, macroscopic and microscopic lesions, amount of PRRSV and PCV2 antibodies and nucleic acids in sera, amount of PRRSV and PCV2 antigen associated with lesions, and interferon gamma (IFN-\u03b3) concentrations in serum were measured and compared between groups.",

In addition, batch 3 (B3) consisted of 9 colostrum-fed crossbred pigs derived from sows free of PRRSV and M. hyopneumoniae but seropositive for PCV2.

Serum from the pigs infected with VR-2385 in 2001 was used to re-isolate the virus followed by two subsequent passages in MARC-145 cells to produce the virus stock of VR-2385 for this study. PRRSV isolate NC16845b with a RFLP pattern 1-18-2 was isolated in 2006 from a clinically affected 9-week-old pig with systemic PCVAD from a group of pigs from North Carolina with a history of severe respiratory disease in 50% of the pigs and approximatley 20% mortality in the group (Gauger et al., 2012). The passage 2 virus of the original isolate was used to experimentally infect a set of PRRSV-free conventional pigs (data not shown) and the lung tissues from these pigs collected two weeks after infection were used for re-isolation of the NC16845b virus followed by two subsequent passages in MARC-145 cells to produce the NC16845b virus stock for this study. The two inocula were separated in different aliquots, stored at \u221280 \u00b0C, and virus of the same lot was used for all batches of pigs.

All samples were run in duplicate. The reactions were carried out under the following conditions: 50 \u00b0C for 2 min, 95 \u00b0C for 10 min, followed by 40 cycles of 95 \u00b0C for 15 s and 60 \u00b0C for 1 min. The sensitivity and specificity of the real-time PCR reaction was evaluated using known PCV2a and PCV2b isolates as well as PPV, PRRSV, and PCV type 1 (PCV1) isolates. Samples were considered negative when no signal was observed within the 40 amplification cycles.",

Summary statistics were calculated for groups to assess the distributional property and data that were not distributed normally (PCR data) were log transformed prior to analysis. As log transformation can only be applied to numbers above 0, a constant number (1) was added to each number in the data set prior to log transformation. A linear mixed model with the random effects \u201cSource\u201d (Source A: B1 and B2 and Source B: B3) and \u201cBatch\u201d (B1, B2, B3, nested within \u201cSource\u201d) and the fixed effects \u201cPRRSV strain\u201d (none, VR-2385, NC16845b) and \u201cPCV2 subtype\u201d (none, PCV2a, PCV2b) was used first on all outcomes.

The final model to analyze continuous data collected over time (rectal temperatures, blood cell counts, log transformed PCV2 and PRRSV genomic copies, and ELISA S/P ratios) was a repeated measures analysis of variance (ANOVA), where PRRSV strain, PCV2 subtype, DPI and their interactions were the fixed effects and pig was the subject of repeated measures. Compound symmetry variance-covariance structure was used to model the within pig correlation. A one-way ANOVA was used to analyze cross-sectional data (macroscopic and microscopic lung lesions) where PRRSV strain, PCV2 subtype, and their interaction were the fixed effects. Differences among the interacting groups (PRRSV strain \u00d7 PCV2 subtype) in the repeated measures ANOVA or the one-way ANOVA were assessed using Tukey's t-test. A p-value of less than 0.05 was considered significant. Differences in prevalence of PRRSV and PCV2 antigen between groups (IHC staining) were determined by Fisher's exact test.",

Interestingly, in gnotobiotic pigs the effect of the coinfection appeared additive rather than synergistic (Van Reeth and Nauwynck, 2000). More recent studies have shown that PRRSV modifies the innate immune response, induces immunosuppression and enhances the inflammatory response to PRCV in pigs (Jung et al., 2009, Renukaradhya et al., 2010). In another study, dual infection of specific pathogen-free pigs with PRRSV and pseudorabies virus (PRV) resulted in more severe clinical signs and increased pneumonia in pigs inoculated with both viruses compared to pigs infected with PRRSV or PRV alone (Shibata et al., 2003). It is also well recognized that PCV2 replication is enhanced by concurrent PRRSV infection in both CD and conventional pigs compared to singularly inoculated pigs (Allan et al., 2000, Rovira et al., 2002). To the authors\u2019 knowledge, the pathogenicity of genetically different PRRSV isolates in the presence of concurrent viral infection has not been evaluated in vivo.",

Coinfected groups had significantly higher mean rectal temperatures compared to pigs infected with PRRSV alone and the negative controls. Interestingly, when organized by coinfection status and analyzed by PCV2 subtype, pigs inoculated with PCV2a had significantly higher mean group rectal temperatures compared to pigs inoculated with PCV2b on dpi 9 which was associated with an anti-PCV2-antibody response in 38.9% (7/18) of the PCV2a-inoculated pigs on dpi 9 whereas a delayed antibody response was seen in PCV2b- inoculated pigs (11.1%; 2/18).",

The uniqueness of the current study is the utilization of two temporally and genetically different PRRSV isolates both from cases of high morbidity and mortality in the field but isolated 15 years apart. In a separate in vitro study comparing phenotypic traits of the two PRRS viruses, NC16845b demonstrated reduced growth characteristics compared to VR-2385 (Gauger et al., 2012). NC16845b plaque sizes were slightly smaller than VR-2385 and the peak viral titer demonstrated by NC16845b was approximately 13-fold lower than the VR-2385 peak titer. This is in contrast to the in vivo growth characteristics demonstrated in this report. There were clear differences in initial replication between the two PRRSV isolates used in this study. The VR-2385-inoculated pigs had significantly higher levels of PRRSV RNA in serum on dpi 3 and 6. Moreover, NC16845b replicated at higher levels at dpi 9 and dpi 12 compared to VR-2385 which was associated with significantly lower levels of lymphocytes at dpi 9 and a significantly lower N/L ratio at dpi 12. These results suggest that highly pathogenic PRRSVs may replicate more efficiently in vivo in contrast to their decreased growth properties in vitro as previously suggested (Johnson et al., 2004, Wang et al., 2008). This is further supported by the data obtained from the pigs infected with PRRSV alone (B2 and B3) which clearly show an increase in replication in pigs infected with NC16845b in the later stages of the in vivo study.",

            "text": "Similar to other PCV2-PRRSV coinfection studies (Allan et al., 2000, Harms et al., 2001), macroscopic and microscopic lesions in coinfected groups were enhanced compared to pigs singularly infected with PRRSV. Recently, it has been shown that pigs infected with VR-2385 had significantly prolonged (until 70 DPI) PCV2 viremia and shedding in PRRSV-PCV2 coinfected pigs (Sinha et al., 2011). A similar approach using PRRSV NC16845b, which replicated differently from VR-2385 in the early stages of infection, could potentially offer new insights on viral interactions in pigs. In the current study, PCV2b replication was significantly up-regulated shortly after initiation of the study at dpi 3 compared to PCV2a. Furthermore, the CoI-92-2b group had significantly higher quantities of PCV2b in the serum compared to CoI-06-2a (dpi 3 and 12) and CoI-06-2b (dpi 12) which was associated with a higher prevalence of PCV2 antigen in tissues (93.8% versus 75.0%) indicating a synergistic relationship between PRRSV-1992 (VR-2385) and PCV2. Unlike previous studies where the average trial length ranged from 21 to 32 days (Allan et al., 2000, Rovira et al., 2002), this trial was terminated at dpi 12 to evaluate PRRSV-induced lung lesions which tend to be most severe between dpi 10 and dpi 14. It remains unknown if the observed trend would have resulted in a difference in clinical disease in the later stages of infection. As expected, and similar to a previous study (Yu et al., 2007), the pathological lesions associated with PCV2 were either not present or they were mild; however, PCV2 antigen was detected in most tissues in coinfected pigs. In this study, PCV2 na\u00efve pigs were utilized, thus the relevance of the model to actual field situations is limited considering the majority of young pigs have high levels of passively acquired anti-PCV2 antibodies (Opriessnig et al., 2004b). Therefore, the impact of anti-PCV2 immunity on the PCV2 infection could not be ascertained in the experiment; however, this was not a major concern as we know from several experiments that pigs with passively derived antibodies, although protected from clinical PCV2 associated disease, can still be infected with PCV2 (McKeown et al., 2005, Opriessnig et al., 2008a). Therefore, we believe that a PCV2 na\u00efve pig model increases the ability to identify trends and associations between PRRSV and PCV2.",

This model of simultaneous dual inoculation does not fully mimic the population dynamics due to the variability in timing of exposure to these two pathogens within and between herds in field situations. On many conventional farms, endemic exposure and seroconversion to PRRSV often occurs earlier than exposure to PCV2. Infection of pigs with PRRSV prior to PCV2 may contribute to the manifestation of more severe PCV2-induced clinical disease and lesions. PRRSV is immunosuppressive, primarily infecting porcine alveolar macrophages (Drew, 2000), which decreases the pig's ability to clear subsequent infections. In contrast, prior PRRSV infection may induce an immunostimulatory effect on the host immune response that serves to enhance PCV2 replication and lesions (Krakowka et al., 2001).",

While this is also applicable to the current study, we attempted to minimize this risk, by using a relatively low passage of both viruses with a pig passage followed by only two in vitro passages in MARC-145 cells. Inoculation was completed two days after weaning and transport of the pigs to the research facility. It is also possible that the stress from weaning, transport, new socialization, and adjusting to a new environment may have affected the ability of the pigs to respond to concurrent PRRSV-PCV2 infection and influenced the level of PRRSV replication in the pigs. However, the data obtained from pigs infected with PRRSV alone indicate that this was not the case and that the ability of the pigs to develop a humoral immune response was normal.",

Differences in in vivo replication kinetics were identified. VR-2385 initially replicated more quickly and to higher levels and peaked at dpi 6 and the amount of VR-2385 RNA steadily declined thereafter. In contrast, pigs infected with NC16845b had lower levels of PRRSV RNA in serum initially and this steadily increased through termination of the study at dpi 12. Concurrent PCV2 viremia was enhanced by PRRSV VR-2385 infection but not by concurrent PRRSV NC16845b infection. A higher prevalence of PCV2 antigen was demonstrated in the lungs of pigs coinfected with VR-2385 (83.3%) compared to pigs coinfected with PRRSV NC16845b (66.7%). This work further emphasizes in vivo replication differences among PRRSV strains and the importance of coinfecting pathogens on PRRSV kinetics. Additional investigations are necessary to further elucidate the specific mechanisms of the PCV2-PRRSV interaction in pigs.",
