            "text": "Outbreaks such as those caused by the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (SARS CoV), the influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 pandemic of 2009, and more recently the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV), Ebola virus and Zika virus have demonstrated the high potential risk of emerging and re-emerging infectious diseases to spread within and between countries [1], [2], [3], [4], [5]. These in turn cause increasing challenges for public health systems, including the increasing burden of infectious disease, and the need to build a surveillance and response system that is able to identify newly emerging disease rapidly, both regionally and internationally which calls for international collaboration, and the need for drug and vaccine research and production [6], [7], [8]. While the response to endemic diseases may be less urgent, the burden caused by pathogens such as influenza or malaria is high [9], [10], [11], and due to their endemicity, many countries have long standing surveillance systems to track outbreaks and guide response, from vector control to hospital bed utilization [12], [13], [14], [15]. Early warning systems aiming to predict epidemics as soon as possible can allow control methods to be carried out rapidly and increase their chance of success [16], [17]. To do so, decision makers need to be able to make accurate forecasts of incidence and to automate this forecasting process based on routinely collected notification data [18]. If accurate forecasts were available in both the near and far future, effective policies could then be targeted to the expected future needs. Existing approaches to real-time forecasting include generalized linear regression, seasonal autoregressive integrated moving average (SARIMA) model or a simpler ARIMA form of it, phenomenological models like the logistic growth model and Richards model, and mechanistic models like the SIR models [19], [20], [21], [22], [23], [24]. Often such approaches involve the challenge of integrating environmental factors including temperature, humidity and rainfall, which may influence pathogen transmission directly or affect the vector activities (for vector borne diseases), especially in temperate regions [25], [26], [27], [28], [29]. For instance, influenza virus is more transmissible in low temperature and low humidity conditions [30], [31], while the primary vector of dengue, the yellow fever mosquito Aedes aegypti, favors higher temperature [32], [33]. The availability of real time data-streams on seasonal variation and climatic variability therefore holds the potential to lead to more accurate prediction algorithms, potentially improving public health response.",

            "text": "Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) regression is a machine learning method that can find patterns within large datasets while avoiding the problem of over-fitting [34]. Estimation and variable selection are simultaneously carried out using the LASSO method, and as such it is commonly used in studies in fields with large numbers of explanatory variables to reduce the variable space. This algorithm trades off model accuracy with model parsimony by introducing a penalty term into the objective function (which in standard linear regression is the sum of squares of residuals). The penalty term can, for linear regression models, be made equivalent to a constraint on the sum of the absolute parameter coefficients. This constraint imposed by LASSO regression has the effect of shrinking some estimated coefficients towards zero, which may help reduce biases caused by separation in some forms of regression [35], while simultaneously producing some parameter estimates that are exactly 0, so that the covariate associated with this coefficient is not associated with the outcome variable in that model. The optimal balance between model accuracy and complexity is typically obtained through cross-validation: repeatedly partitioning the data into training and validation sets, varying the degree of penalty, optimizing the regression parameters for each penalty value, then selecting the penalty that minimizes out of sample predictive accuracy. Computationally efficient methods to explore the penalty and parameter space exist [36], making it feasible to use LASSO as part of a \u2018real-time\u2019 forecasting pipeline for routinely collected health data such as infectious disease notifications. This computational speed allows the forecasting to adapt to changes in the underlying disease dynamics by permitting refitting of the model each time new data are reported, which may be important for diseases in which the severity changes between outbreaks, such as influenza [37]. Forecasts at different time horizons can be obtained through splicing together separate LASSO models, each trained on the data available at the time of the forecast, but tailored to predict at different windows into the future.",

Four representative infectious diseases were included in the study: two mosquito-borne infections (Dengue and Malaria) and two infections that spread from person to person (Hand Foot and Mouth Disease (HFMD) and Chickenpox). For all four pathogens, a relationship has previously been found between incidence and climatic variables [40], [41], [42] or for there to be a seasonality to incidence [43]. Not all four pathogens were considered for each country: some are not present in each country while others are not captured in routine infectious disease surveillance systems.",

At each time point, up to six month ahead predictions are shown in the figure, using data available at the time the prediction was made. The number of variables from each category that were selected by our LASSO models are presented in Supplementary Fig. 7 and the effect size of each climatic variable at different lags for all forecast windows are shown in Supplementary Fig. 8. Generally, the 95% projection interval of the forecast captured the actual scenario more than 80% of the time, indicating slight under-coverage. Coverage rates for the full models are tabulated in Table 2\n. MAPE for full models at all prediction windows are shown in Table 3\n. RMSE and R-squared values for full models are included in Supplementary Tables 1 and 2. For most diseases, predictions made beyond 4 weeks ahead were increasingly discrepant from the actual scenario., , , , , , , Predicted cases against actual cases at 1 week, 2 weeks, 4 weeks and 8 weeks for all prediction period for all diseases were plotted in Fig. 4\n. For all diseases, as the prediction window gets longer, the magnitude of the error grows, especially for the largest sizes of outbreaks where there is likely to be more stochastic variability. Cumulative density functions of the observed time series of all diseases and predicted time series at various forecast windows are shown in Fig. 5\n: those derived from predictions are generally close to that from the observed time series. Short term predictions generally performed better than longer term predictions. Table 4\nshows the classification accuracy of our prediction models being able to correctly classify one week/month to be an epidemic week/month. A percentage above 75% suggested that the prediction model performed better than a random guess. Models that passed the binomial test of having accuracy significantly higher than 75% were marked with the asterisk. Predictions for HFMD epidemic were generally accurate even at long prediction windows; for most other diseases, prediction within 5 weeks were above 75%. However, for chickenpox in Japan and dengue in Singapore, only predictions within 3 and 4 weeks were significantly above 75% from the Binomial test. This suggests that the approach can predict the timing of periods of elevated transmission at about one month in advance but that the absolute magnitude is hard to predict accurately, given the larger errors at high levels exhibited in Fig. 4.",

The prediction errors arising from each model were then compared with the simplest incidence only model. A ratio substantially less than 1 shows prediction accuracy increased by including the set(s) of variables. For some diseases like chickenpox in Thailand, dropping some variables affected prediction accuracy by a large extent, indicating the importance of including monthly effect to achieve greater accuracy in predictions. For other diseases like dengue in Taiwan, dropping the climatic variables had only minimal effect on the accuracy of the predictions, which suggests that the features in those sets are not necessary for routine predictions. Panels in the second and fourth columns in Fig. 6 showed prediction error for all diseases for different prediction windows. Prediction error was quantified by the mean absolute percentage error. In line with our previous observations, as the prediction window gets longer, prediction error increases. More complicated models show less prediction error but the improvements varied by diseases and countries.",

Most of the variation in incidence was explained by the autoregressive terms as there was no or minimal improvement in forecast accuracy by including more variables other than autoregressive terms in the prediction model shown in Fig. 6. Long term predictions were not accurate, even when we include multiple climatic variables as candidate features. We believe this reflects the difficulty in using weather data relating to current conditions to predict disease levels in several months\u2014in contrast, most other analyses use climate data from near the time point being forecast [28], [57], which is typically not available in real time.

This approach can readily be automated to run on routinely collected case data, but the accuracy of the prediction is very much dependent on the timeliness at which such data become available. This calls for a comprehensive regional and country level infectious diseases surveillance system, whether using clinician/laboratory driven case notification, or mining of electronic medical records. Weather data, in contrast, are widely posted to sources like the Weather Underground which can be mined in real-time. An example of this in practice can be found in Singapore, where the National Environment Agency has a weekly dengue forecast, as described elsewhere [38]. The LASSO model building process involves identifying the model complexity through optimal out of sample predictive performance, and as such it is naturally suited to making forecasts. By fitting separate models at each forecast window, variables whose predictive performance is expressed differently at different lags can be efficiently exploited: this might be particularly beneficial for vector borne diseases in which the effect of weather on transmission is mediated through one or more generations of vectors.",
