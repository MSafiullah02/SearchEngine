The study was held in 12 public hospitals, from a geographically defined low-income region in the Buenos Aires suburbs, that provide care to an estimated population of 56 560 children younger than 2 years who lacked medical insurance [20]. Previous studies in this population examined RSV LRTI severity and the role of cytokines in human rhinovirus (hRV) infections [19, 21\u201325]. The study was approved by institutional review boards at each participating hospital, the state of Buenos Aires, and Vanderbilt University.

The virus has been reported to trigger Th2 cytokines through thymic stromal lymphopoietin, IL-4, IL-5, IL-13, and Th-17 responses via the release of IL-1\u03b2, IL-17, and IL-6 [17, 18, 33\u201335].

Importantly, the hMPV case fatality ratio in hospital was almost half that reported for RSV in the same population, highlighting that, to date, RSV remains the most important target for prevention [23].",

First, because (as is the case for most studies) we did not analyze our samples for all other viruses, such as coronavirus or parainfluenza virus type 3, their effect on our observations is unknown. Second, given the age of our subjects and the prospective nature of this program, whether severity depended causally on maternal disease versus infant atopy/asthma cannot be answered. Third, given the observational nature of our study design focused on generating new hypotheses, no adjustment for multiple testing was performed. Additional research is needed to confirm the role of maternal asthma as a risk factor for severity in hMPV-infected children. However, our program also has significant strengths, including its prospective design and the evaluation of respiratory samples using state-of-the-art laboratory RT-PCR techniques. Furthermore, to our knowledge, this is the first population-based study seeking to define the burden of hMPV disease in a vulnerable population from a low- or middle-income country. In addition, this large study addressed numerous prenatal and perinatal risk factors, examining how they modify the severity of infection.",
