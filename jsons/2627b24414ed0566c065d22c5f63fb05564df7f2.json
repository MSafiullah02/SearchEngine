Existence of the model's equilibrium points has been investigated. According to some special cases of the derivative-orders in the proposed model, the asymptotic stability of the infection-free equilibrium and endemic equilibrium has been proved under certain conditions. These stability conditions related to the derivative-orders depend on not only the basic reproduction rate frequently emphasized in the literature but also the newly obtained conditions in this study. Qualitative analysis results were complemented by numerical simulations in Matlab, illustrating the obtained stability result.",

FOC, expressed as a generalization of ordinary differentiation and integration to arbitrary non-integer order and extensively used in different fields of science recently, is a branch of mathematical analysis [2, 3] . Most important feature of FOC is memory concept. If the output of a system at each time depends only on the input at time , then such systems are said to be memoryless systems. Otherwise, if the system has to remember previous values of the input to specify the current value of the output, then such systems are called memory systems [4] . In modeling of various memory phenomena, it is mentioned that a memory process usually consists of two stages. One is short with permanent retention, and the other is governed by a simple model of fractional derivative [5] . Numerous literature has been developed on the applications of FODEs and their systems (FOSs), a new and powerful tool that has recently been employed to model complex structures with nonlinear behavior and long-term memory [6] [7] [8] . Especially, biological systems are also rich source for mathematical modeling through FOSs [9] .",

Currently, there exist 21 families of viruses expressed to cause diseases in humans. Some of these diseases are very seriously infectious diseases such as (acquired immuno deficiency syndrome), Hepatitis, Herpes Simplex, Measles, avian influenza, and -or -like coronavirus [23] . They have common features, such as they are all highly pathogenic to humans or livestock [24] . In particular , most severe stage of (human immunodeficiency virus) infection, is remarkable as a fatal disease [25] . Considering Considering Eqs (1), several nonlinear models, given in [28, 29] through ODEs and [12, 21, [30] [31] [32] [33] through FODEs, were studied by researchers. In this sense, they analyzed qualitatively and/or numerically their models by developing Eqs (1) Mascio et al. [34] also considered the effect of antiviral drugs for Eqs (1) , and so, the efficacy of these drugs was estimated by mathematical modeling for retroviruses such as . While a protease inhibitor causes infected cells to produce immature non-infectious virus particles, a reverse transcriptase inhibitor effectively blocks the successful infection of a cell. In this sense, they assumed that when an antiretroviral drug such as a protease inhibitor or a reverse transcriptase inhibitor are applied to a patient in steady state as the viral load falls. To model this fall, the effectiveness of the drug is introduced into the model. Therefore, the virus dynamics is reformed to the following ODEs:",

In about 200 days, while infected cells and viral particles disappear, response of host approaches its carrying capacity. On the other hand, it takes a long time for the uninfected cells to approach its equilibrium value. In here, it was shown that the conditions related to the stability of in the Table 2 were satisfied, and it was supported by Figs. 8-9. As can be seen from these figures, clearing the infection takes at least 200 days. In this study, we proposed the new model including the five time-dependent variables: the host cells as susceptible and infected, the viral particles as infectious and noninfectious and the host's immune system response as cells. This model proposed in Eqs (14) is the form of incommensurate fractional-order nonlinear system (FOS) with the Caputo fractional derivative. In addition, the derivative-orders of these dependent variables in the system are as follows and in interval ( -, respectively. Considering the models in the literature, the main innovations in our model are follows: \uf0b7 We built the model by using incommensurate FOS consisting of five equations. \uf0b7 We have assumed that cells of the host have the effect of destroying both infected cells and viral particles, and cells have followed the logistic growth model. Our model exhibits two equilibria, namely, disease-free equilibrium and the endemic equilibrium points. In general, the models in literature trying to explain the infection process with the ONLY parameter basic reproduction rate . By qualitative analysis of our model, what we found are as follows \uf0b7 Disease-free equilibrium point always exists and is asymptotically stable, \uf0b7 Endemic equilibrium point exists when .
