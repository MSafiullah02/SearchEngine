            "text": "Severe acute liver failure is defined as the development of overt liver failure with encephalopathy over eight weeks or less in previously healthy individuals. In hyperacute liver failure, deterioration occurs in less than 14 days. Whilst it is a relatively uncommon reason for admission to the intensive care unit (ICU), acute liver failure is important because it often occurs in previously well young adults and carries a high mortality. Management of these patients presents considerable challenges within the ICU due to the extreme nature of the associated pathophysiological processes, which affect multiple systems. Integrated management strategies have been poorly studied and treatment is often center-specific [1] . Clinical manifestations include a reduced conscious state, jaundice with abnormal liver function tests (especially elevations in amino acid transferase levels more than 25 times the upper limit of normal) and coagulopathy. Further deterioration can involve marked cerebral edema, hypoglycemia and severe shock with lactic acidosis and multiple organ failure. The use of clinical management guidelines may assist in the treatment of these patients by providing an evidence-based framework for care by staff at the bedside, which ensures that all important priorities are adequately addressed. It is possible that a coordinated combination of specific and general therapies may reduce mortality and the need for liver transplantation. Consideration for transfer to a unit with expertise in liver transplantation may be appropriate in order for this option to be available as a life-saving treatment should supportive care fail to arrest deterioration.",

Causes of severe acute liver failure requiring ICU admission vary across regions, with drug-induced liver injury more common in industrialized nations and viral pathogens more common in developing countries. Up to a fifth of cases have no clear cause and may be due to as yet unrecognized viral entities, unusual presentations of autoimmune processes or unrecognized drug complications. Patients in whom critical illness develops rapidly (e.g., hyperacute liver failure from paracetamol [acetaminophen] toxicity) may recover completely without the need for liver transplantation if not overwhelmed by multiple organ failure, severe cerebral edema or complications, such as sepsis. For patients who exhibit a less fulminant course (e.g., as a result of idiosyncratic drug reactions), death is a frequent outcome unless transplantation is undertaken. Severe liver injury can sometimes also occur as a consequence of prolonged shock, where situations of advanced hemodynamic compromise result in ischemic hepatitis and considerable derangement of liver function. In this setting, ICU management is most appropriately directed to addressing the cause of the shocked state and its consequences, with specific liver failure directed therapies rarely required. ",

            "text": "Cerebral edema occurs in many patients with high-grade encephalopathy. Brainstem herniation is a common cause of death in acute liver failure and occurs because of severe cerebral swelling causing refractory intracranial hypertension. The pathophysiology of acute liver failure-associated cerebral edema is complex, but the accumulation of metabolic toxins, such as ammonia [3] , and the loss of cerebral autoregulation resulting in hyperemia [4] are two key drivers. Ammonia is a waste product of nitrogen metabolism and undergoes detoxification via the urea cycle. The liver is responsible for most of this detoxification activity and hyperammonemia is a cardinal feature of severe liver failure. Ammonia readily crosses the blood brain barrier and the increasing brain tissue concentrations cause neuroexcitation, astrocyte swelling and disruption of many crucial neuronal processes. A range of crucial astrocyte signaling and intracellular functions are also impacted, causing further central nervous system (CNS) impairment. Ammonia concentrations more than 117 \u00b5mol/l are highly associated with the development of severe cerebral edema and intracranial hypertension [5] . Severe acute liver failure also results in the accumulation of false neurotransmitters, CNS depressants, and inflammatory mediators, which may reduce consciousness. Like ammonia, these neurotoxic substances are generally small and water-soluble and may, therefore, be removed by extracorporeal therapy.",

Clotting factor support may be required to facilitate insertion of large venous catheters. Modalities incorporating both diffusive and convective clearance (e.g., hemodiafiltration) may be more effective than filtration alone. Lactate-free replacement fluid (i.e., bicarbonate buffered) must be used for hemofiltration to avoid contributing to elevations in blood lactate concentrations. Modern integrated CRRT machines used in the ICU have integrated heating mechanisms, which may be turned off or run at the lowest permitted temperatures as a way of lowering the patient's core temperature. Anticoagulation is rarely required, especially if good circuit blood flows can be achieved. The use of an extracorporeal blood purification therapy, such as CRRT, can rapidly lower blood ammonia concentrations and is a key neuroprotective strategy [8] . Ammonia undergoes similar clearance to urea when CRRT is applied and treatment should be given at sufficient intensity to lower levels to near the normal range. Treatment should not be delayed until overt renal failure or uremia is evident. Additional benefits of CRRT include achievement of an even fluid balance, correction of electrolyte disturbances, improvement of acid-base abnormalities and prevention of fever. High dose CRRT may result in hypophosphatemia and measurements should be undertaken at least daily with low serum levels being treated as required. Intermittent dialysis is less preferred in acute liver failure [11] because of the undesirable impact on already compromised hemodynamics and problems associated with discontinuous therapies, such as rebound hyperammonemia.",

The combination of quadruple-H therapy and comprehensive general intensive care support can be provided in most critical care settings and may reduce mortality and the need for liver transplantation. In extremely unwell patients, transfer to a major transplant center may be appropriate in order to optimize care, even if need for transplantation is not considered a likely ultimate outcome.",
