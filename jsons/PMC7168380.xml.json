In the interests of farm animal welfare, rapid diagnosis and treatment are required to avoid pain, injury and disease in animals. Furthermore, outbreaks of disease directly reduce the production or quality of dairy products, resulting in huge economic losses and threatening food security. In 2001, an outbreak of foot\u2010and\u2010mouth virus infected around one million cattle in the U.K. and the resulting economic losses were estimated to amount to US$12.3\u201313.8 bn (Thompson et al., 2002). However, zoonotic viral diseases of cattle, such as Rift Valley fever and Crimean\u2013Congo haemorrhagic fever, remain constant threats to human populations (Ganter, 2015; Schuster et al., 2016). Therefore, a sustainable system for the surveillance of infectious disease on livestock farms is essential to the monitoring and control of such diseases.",

            "text": "Investigations into arbovirus vectors and their ecological characteristics are important for controlling arboviruses in the field, but the vector species of bovine arboviruses in Taiwan are still unknown. A comprehensive investigation conducted in dairy farms in Taiwan found 17 species of Culicoides biting midge (Chien, 2015). However, the present study identified only five species, although this may reflect the short duration of the period of collection of live specimens for virus detections. Culicoides oxystoma is a dominant species on dairy farms, and is also associated with paddy rice fields (Yanase et al., 2013). This species is identified as a vector of BEFV, AKAV, AINOV, PEAV and CHUV in Taiwan and Japan (Yanase et al., 2005). The present findings revealed an ornithophilic species, C. arakawae, which may also be a potential vector of BEFV, and its occurrence may be related to the dynamic of wild birds or to distance from a poultry farm (Yanase et al., 2005). Although target bovine arboviruses are considered to be mainly Culicoides\u2010borne viruses, mosquitoes may also play an important role in bovine arbovirus transmission. Culex tritaeniorhynchus may be a potential vector of BEFV, AINOV and CHUV. In a previous study, AKAV was isolated from Cx. tritaeniorhynchus in Japan (Yamakawa et al., 2006), but was not in the present study; however, AKAV was detected in Cx. quinquefasciatus in Taiwan. Thus, the susceptibility of Cx. quinquefasciatus and Cx. tritaeniorhynchus to Taiwanese AKAV strains requires further examination. Culex quinquefasciatus may be a potential vector of AINOV, whereas Cx. tritaeniorhynchus, Culex pipiens molestus and Culex fuscocephala are possible vectors of CHUV in Taiwan. The present authors recorded the first finding of Ar. subalbatus as a potential vector of AINOV and CHUV and propose that An. sinensis is a potential vector of BEFV and AKAV. The habitats of these mosquito vectors are associated with rice paddy fields, human residues and cattle dung (Ohba et al., 2013). Dairy farms in Taiwan are commonly located near other livestock farms or close to rice paddies, which provides these vector species with various ideal habitats.",

There are no previous reports of MIRs of the five detected arboviruses, but the MIRs of Schmallenberg virus (Orthobunyavirus) and bluetongue virus (Orbivirus) were found to fall in the interval between 0.1 and 100 (Braks et al., 2017). However, MIRs are vulnerable to interference by intrinsic and extrinsic factors, such as the extrinsic incubation period in a vector, sampling population size, and the sensitivity of the detection method (Bustamante & Lord, 2010). Thus, the present group proposes to examine the vector competence of the potential vector species identified for detected arboviruses because most of these can be bred in the laboratory.",

The current arbovirus detections demonstrate that both AKAV and CHUV, but not IBAV, were epidemic during 2012\u20132015. The present study used a different primer set designed for the Taiwanese IBAV strain (Table S1), but the result was the same as in the previous survey. It is possible that the vectors in the current collections may not carry IBAV in the field or that IBAV was not epidemic in 2012\u20132015; however, its occurrence needs further investigation.",

In the present study, the first detections of AINOV were in YL\u2010A in October 2012, but the main detections were recorded from the end of 2013 to the middle of 2014 in five sampling farms. However, PEAV was detected only in YL\u2010A in November 2012, and in 2013 and 2015, and this temporal and geographic profile of PEAV requires further study. Some reassortment between AINOV and PEAV may occur in nature (Yanase et al., 2010), although this phenomenon has not yet been observed by cloning their structure genes (data not shown). In 2012\u20132013, BEFV broke out in both the Yaeyama Islands, Japan, and Taiwan; BEFV may have been transferred from the Yaeyama Islands to eastern Taiwan through an airstream (Ting et al., 2014; Hayama et al., 2016). The initial outbreak of BEFV occurred in September 2012 in eastern Taiwan, but the virus soon spread to western Taiwan via Pingtung County; this temporospatial pattern of occurrence is in line with predictions made by airstream simulation (Hayama et al., 2016). Another viewpoint indicated that BEFV may spread in a seasonal direction from southern China to southwestern Taiwan (Walker & Klement, 2015). Therefore, phylogenetic and biogeographic analyses of vectors and pathogens are essential for understanding temporospatial patterns of occurrence of bovine arboviral diseases in terms of the influences of geographic distributions and seasonal atmospheric conditions in countries of eastern and southeastern Asia.",

Both characteristics are useful for elucidating the feasibility of vector\u2010based approaches in dairy farms. The present results showed a positive rate of 18.75%, but the conversion of data between regular serum investigations and vector\u2010based approaches requires further study. The vector\u2010based approach may also be applicable for the surveillance of other pathogens in cattle blood, such as Anaplasma spp., Babesia spp. and Trypanosoma spp. The detection of BVDV and RVA demonstrated that a vector\u2010based approach can also be applied to transient viraemia viruses. Rotavirus A is abundant in cattle faeces, and although the contamination by faeces of vector specimens could not be completely excluded in this study, RT\u2010PCR analyses in three other pools collected at the same time from the same trap showed negative results.",

The vector\u2010based approach provides rapid results by RT\u2010PCR detections within 24 h and allows for a high frequency of sampling. It also reduces the pain and possible distress associated with blood sampling in cattle. Furthermore, users of this approach do not need professional expertise to identify vector species if the targets of analysis are non\u2010arboviruses, and the pooling of different vector species will not affect the detection of non\u2010arboviruses. However, the current vector\u2010based approach requires further improvement if it is to be applied in the field because the efficiency of this approach must be comparable with that of other sampling methods, such as blood or milk sampling, and other details of this approach, such as the parameters of trap setting, limitation of collection time and the effects of blood digested in the midguts of vectors, also require further investigation. Therefore, the present authors suggest that the vector\u2010based approach has the potential to be used as a surveillance tool to increase understanding of epidemics of both arboviruses and non\u2010arboviruses on livestock farms.",
