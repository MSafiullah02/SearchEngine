In addition to antibiotics, advanced cases require surgical resection of necrotic bowel.

It was prevalent between 1944 and 1948 but then disappeared in Europe as the nutritional status of its population improved. In 1963, a similar disease was reported from the Highlands of Papua New Guinea, where predominantly male children and young adults presented with severe abdominal pain after ceremonial feasting on large amounts of sweet potatoes and inadequately cooked pork contaminated with pig intestine. It was termed \u201cpigbel,\u201d a pidgin English term for abdominal pain following a pig feast.

This occurs rapidly, and solitary organisms can be seen in the lamina propria without apparent mucosal abnormality. Mycobacteria within the lamina propria are phagocytosed by macrophages, but intracellular killing does not occur. Instead, the macrophages become stuffed with organisms as they multiply intracellularly. With continued bacterial replication, the host cell ruptures. This process leads to the presence of sheets of macrophages laden with AFB. Unimpaired replication of mycobacteria results in massive thickening of the intestinal wall,151 and infection spreads via mural lymphatics to involve lymph nodes. Mycobacteria replicate in the lymph nodes as well, and eventually the normal histology of the lymph nodes is effaced. Hematogenous dissemination occurs concurrently. Reticuloendothelial organs such as the liver, spleen, and bone marrow are the most frequent distant sites.150\n",

In an unfavorable environment, rhabditiform larvae transform into filariform larvae (parasitic phase).

Commonly, the changes are patchy, and the overall mucosal architecture is preserved. Minimal degenerative changes, limited to the upper half of the mucosa, can be seen. These include mucin depletion and epithelial damage with flattened cytoplasm associated with cryptic dilatation.
