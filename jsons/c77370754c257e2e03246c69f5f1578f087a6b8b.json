A, Phylogenetic tree of SmHCVs based on nucleotide sequence from NS3 to NS5 regions. Neighbor-Joining tree was produced using MEGA7 software with the p-distance method (https://www. megasoftware.net). Bootstrap value (%) was 1,000 replicates. The scale bar indicates nucleotide substitutions per site. The sequences marked with the black circle were obtained in this study. B, Histopathology and SmHCV RNA detection in the liver samples of Asian house shrew. Cryostat sections of liver tissue were stained with hematoxylin-eosin (HE) and Oil red staining. Inflammatory cell infiltration caused by SmHCV in SZCDC10. Severe steatosis and piecemeal necrosis caused by SmHCV in SZCDC19. Inflammatory cell infiltration caused by SmHCV in SZCDC22. Liver sections without virus infection in SZCDC32. C, Dark blue indicates viral RNA detected in liver tissue of SZCDC10 by RNA probe targeting viral genomic NS3 gene labelled with digoxigenin (DIG). The cryostat sections were scaned on Pannoramic MIDI and pictures were taken by Pannoramic Viewer 1.15.3. Scale bars: 100 \u03bcm. Nanshan districts. More importantly, we found SmHCV positive samples collected in three independent years at Luohu district, though only small amount of samples were collected in year 2013 and 2014.",

In this study, we found the Asian house shrew is another group of animal hosts of hepacivirus. Shenzhen is a highly populated and rapid urbanization city with a high chance of close contact with wild animals. With the high diversity of SmHCVs presented in this region, there should be a high chance of virus transmission from animals to humans. Thus, long-term surveillance should be conducted in the future. As the fourth most commonly reported infectious disease in China, HCV infection maybe get more complicated because of novel hepaciviruses discovery (Qin et al., 2015) . In addition, our investigation was just based on small sample numbers in Shenzhen city. Considering geographically wide distribution of Asian shrews, we believe there should be more hepaciviruses to be discovered in the future.",
