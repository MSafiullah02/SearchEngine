We characterized the mRNA copy number, 7 glycosylation status, transduction efficiency, and innate immune property of the new vaccine 8 platform.

Primary 20 splenocytes and THP-1 cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 (Gibco, USA) with 10% fetal bovine serum 21 (Gibco, USA). THP-1 cells were differentiated into macrophage-like cells with 150 nM phorbol 12-22 myristate 13-acetate (PMA) (Sigma) before the experiment. 23 24 Plasmids 25 pCCL-PGK-spike-flag and pCCL-PGK-spike-mut-flag were constructed by replacing the GFP gene 26 in pCCL-PGK-eGFP with spike or mutant spike (K1003P and V1004P) gene. pCMV-spike-mut-27 6XMS2, pCMV-spike-6XMS2-flag, pCMV-spike-mut-6XMS2-flag were generated by inserting 28 6XMS2 stem loop repeats between the stop codon of spike or mutant spike gene and polyA sequence 29 while the whole expression cassette is under the control of CMV promoter. 30 31 Production of VSP, IDLVs, and pseudovirus 32 VSP, IDLV, and pseudovirus were produced by 293T cells in 15-cm dishes. Cells were seeded in the 1 15-cm dish at a density of 10 7 /dish 24 hr before calcium phosphate transfection. The media were 2 refreshed 12 hr after transfection. 48 hr and 72 hr post-transfection, supernatants were filtered through 3 a 0.45-\u00b5m filter (Millipore) and ultracentrifuged at 4\u00b0C for 2 hr. Pellets were re-suspended in PBS 4 and stored at \u221280\u00b0C. To produce GFP-expressing spike pseudovirus and IDLV (IDLV-spike or 5 IDLV-spike-mut), cells were transfected with 9.07 \u00b5g pMD.2G (or corresponding spike plasmids), 6 7.26 \u00b5g pRSV-Rev, 31.46 \u00b5g pMDlg/pRRE-D64V, 31.46 \u00b5g pCCL-PGK-eGFP (or pCCL-PGK-7 spike-flag or pCCL-PGK-spike-mut-flag). To produce VSP-spike (or VSP-spike-mut), cells were 8 transfected with 9.07 \u00b5g pMD.2G, 31.46 \u00b5g pMS2M-PH-gagpol-D64V, 31.46 \u00b5g pCMV-spike-9 6XMS2, or pCMV-spike-mut-6XMS2, or their flag tag versions.

After adding GlycoBuffer 2 and NP-40 (10%), the mixtures 18 were incubated with/without PNGase F at 37\u00b0C for 2 hr. Mixtures were then incubated with SDS 19 loading buffer (Beyotime Biotechnology) before sample loading. To detect spike protein expressed 20 in cells, 293T cells were lysed in RIPA 36 hr after transfected with VSP or IDLV. The lysates were 21 incubated with SDS loading buffer supplemented with 2.5% \u03b2-Mercaptoethanol at 37\u00b0C for 30 min 22 without boiling. The proteins were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and 23 transferred to the PVDF membrane. The membrane was blocked by 5% fat-free milk dissolved in 24 TBS/0.05% Tween-20 for 1 hr then cut off according to the marker and incubated with anti-flag 25 monoclonal antibody (Sigma) overnight at 4\u00b0C.

Animals were sacrificed by cervical dislocation under isoflurane. The 9 animal study has complied with the guidelines of the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee 10 (IACUC) of the Shanghai Jiao Tong University. 11 12 Splenocytes isolation 13 Spleens were removed aseptically, placed in RPM 1640 medium, gently homogenized, and passed 14 through the cell strainer (Jet Bio-Filtration) to generate a single-cell suspension. Erythrocytes were 15 rapidly washed and lysed by the RBC lysis buffer (Sangon Biotech), and the splenocytes were 16 resuspended in 1mL RPMI 1640 medium. 17 18 ELISA 19HIV p24 ELISA (Beijing Biodragon Immunotechnologies) was used to measure the p24 level of the 20 lentiviral particles according to the manufacturer. To detect SARS-CoV-2-spike specific antibodies 21 in vivo, serum from the animals were used to test the spike-specific IgG by Mouse IgG ELISA (Bethyl) 22 with a few modifications. 200 ng recombinant spike proteins were coated in 96-well ELISA plates 23 overnight at 4\u00b0C in a carbonating buffer (pH 9.5). The plates were blocked with PBS containing 0.05% 24Tween 20 (PBS-T) and 2% bovine serum albumin (BSA) for 1 hr. Serum samples were diluted 1: 4 25 using PBS incubated for two hours, then washed and test follow the manufacturer's instructions. To 26 find the involvement of cellular immunity, the cytokine production in the splenic cells upon treatment 27 of spike peptides in vitro was measured. For the IFN-\u03b3 and IL-2 assay, the splenocytes were plated 28 in a 96-well plate at a density of 5\u00d710 5 cells/200 \u00b5L. Cells were incubated with a pool of SARS-CoV-29 2 spike peptides of 1 \u00b5g/mL final concentrations for each peptide for 24 hr, or 5 \u00b5g/mL concanavalin30 A (ConA) (Sigma) and culture medium as controls. A pool of 210 peptides (15-17-mer) overlapping 31 by 10 spanning the entire SARS-CoV-2 spike protein were synthesized and kindly provided by Dr. 32 Shengce Tao from Shanghai Jiao Tong University, China. Peptides were pretreated with 100 \u00b5g/mL 1 polymyxin B (Beyotime) for 30 min on ice before stimulation to exclude the LPS contamination. 2 Cytokine IFN-\u03b3 and IL-2 in the supernatants were detected using the corresponding ELISA Kits 3 according to the manufacturer's instruction (MultiSciences Biotech). A standard curve was 4 established according to the OD values, and antibody concentrations were calculated. To determine the serum neutralization activity against GFP-expressing spike pseudovirus. Vaccinated 8 mouse serum (40\u00d7dilutions) were incubated with GFP-expressing spike pseudovirus at 37\u00b0C for 1 hr 9 before adding the mixtures to Huh-7 cells (4\u00d710 4 cells per well in 48-well plates). The media were 10 changed after 12 hr and photos were token at 48 hr post infection. For luciferase-encoding spike 11 pseudovirus neutralization assay. Serial dilutions of ShaCovacc or placebo vaccinated mouse serum 12 were incubated with luciferase-encoding pseudovirus at 37\u00b0C for 1 hr before adding to Huh-7 cells 13 (10 4 cells per well in 96-well plates). The culture media were refreshed 12 hr post-infection, which 14 was followed by an additional 48 hr incubation. Huh-7 cells were subsequently lysed with 50 \u00b5L lysis 15 reagent (Promega), and 30 \u00b5L lysates were transferred to 96-well Costar flat-bottom luminometer 16 plates (Corning Costar) for the detection of relative light units using the Firefly Luciferase Assay Kit 17 (Promega) with an Ultra 384 luminometer (Tecan). A nonlinear regression analysis was performed 18 on the resulting curves using Prism (GraphPad) to calculate half-maximal inhibitory concentration 19 (EC50) values. 20 21 Immunofluorescence imaging 22 293T cells were seed to 48-well plates with 0.1 mg/mL poly-D-lysine coated cover glasses at a destiny 23 of 4\u00d710 4 /well. On the next day, cells were transduced by 150 ng IDLVs or VSPs, or transfected by 24 0.6 \u00b5g pCMV-spike-6XMS2 or pCMV-spike-mut-6XMS2 plasmids. Cells were fixed using 4% 25 paraformaldehyde 36 hr after transduction and transfection. Cells were then stained by anti-flag tag 26 antibody (Proteintech) followed by Alexa Fluor 555 IgG incubation (Cell Signaling Technology) and 27 nuclei staining with DAPI (Beyotime Biotechnology). The imaging was performed on a confocal 28 microscope (A1Si, Nikon) to verify the expression of Spike proteins. 29 30 Statistics 31 Data are presented as mean \u00b1 S.D. in all experiments.
