One of the most important findings of extensive empirical studies is\nthat a wide variety of real networked systems exhibits scale-free behavior,5 characterized by a power-law degree\ndistribution P(k)\u223ck\u2212\u03b3\nwith degree exponent \u03b3 lying in the interval of [2,3].\nNetworks with such broad tail distribution are called scale-free networks, which display\ninhomogeneous structure encoded in the exponent \u03b3: the less the exponent\n\u03b3, the stronger the inhomogeneity of the\nnetwork structure, and vice versa. The heterogeneous structure critically influences many\nother topological properties. For instance, it has been shown that in uncorrelated random\nscale-free networks with node number N (often called network\norder), their average path length (APL) (Ref. 6)\nrelies on \u03b3:7,8 for \u03b3=3,\nd(N)\u223cln N,\nwhile for 2\u2264\u03b3<3,\nd(N)\u223cln ln N.",

The obtained explicit formula displays that in\nlarge networks with N nodes, the MFPT grows linearly with\nN, which is independent of\n\u03b3 and, showing that the structure\ninhomogeneity has no quantitative influence on the MFPT to the hub in Koch networks, which\nlies in their symmetric structure and other special features and is quite different from the\nresult previously reported for uncorrelated random scale-free networks.
