To date, three different coronaviruses have been identified in dogs (Erles et al., 2003, Pratelli et al., 2003). Canine coronaviruses (CCoVs) type I and II are included in group I coronaviruses and their evolution is tightly intermingled with that of feline coronaviruses (Pratelli et al., 2003). Molecular methods able to distinguish between the two genotypes have detected at high frequency mixed infections caused by both genotypes (Pratelli et al., 2004, Decaro et al., 2005c). Usually, they cause infection of the enteric tract with occurrence of mild to severe diarrhoea in pups, although fatal infections with viral spread to internal organs have been reported (Buonavoglia et al., 2006).",

Group II coronaviruses also include porcine haemagglutinating encephalomyelitis virus (HEV), mouse hepatitis virus (MHV), sialodacryoadenitis virus (SDAV), human enteric coronavirus (HECV) 4408 (Enjuanes et al., 2000), and the newly recognised HCoV-HKU1 (Woo et al., 2005). The human coronavirus associated with severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV), initially defined as prototype of a new group IV, has been placed more recently within group II coronaviruses, in a subgroup IIb (Gorbalenya et al., 2004, Weiss and Navas-Martin, 2005).",

However, due to the absence of representativity of the samples examined, it should be taken into account that these data are only indicative of the real circulation of the virus.

Despite the wide distribution of the virus in the organism, as determined by the RT-PCR positive results obtained from several tissues, attempts to isolate the virus on HRT-18 cells were unsuccessful.
