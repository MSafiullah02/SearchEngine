            "text": "In 2003, a new member of the coronavirus family was identified as the causative agent of the previously unknown disease severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) (Drosten et al., 2003, Ksiazek et al., 2003, Peiris et al., 2003). This highly contagious human disease originated in Southern China, but was quickly and efficiently spread to other places in the world. At least three other human coronaviruses OC43, 229E and NL63 are known to cause upper respiratory tract illnesses. They account for approximately one-third of the common colds that appear in the late fall and winter (Holmes, 2004). Sequence analysis of the RNA genome of the SARS-associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV) indicated that this virus is genetically distinct from the other human coronaviruses (Rota et al., 2003, Marra et al., 2003). SARS-CoV-like virus was isolated from a few Himalayan palm civets (Paguma larvata) and a raccoon dog (Nyctereutes procyonoides) during the SARS epidemic of 2002\u20132003, whose genomic sequence displayed 99.8% identity with that of the human SARS-CoV (Guan et al., 2003). Also, Song et al. (2005) reported that the genomic sequence of SARS coronaviruses from human and palm civet of the 2003/2004 outbreak in the city of Guangzhou, China, were nearly identical. Very recently, Lau et al. (2005) reported the isolation of a CoV closely related to SARS-CoV of humans and CoV of civets from wild Chinese horseshoe bats. Coronaviruses seem to exist in a wide variety of other animals including bovine, murine, porcine, avian, canine and feline species (Holmes, 2004).",

Type II strains of FIPV can be easily cultured in Crandell-Reese feline kidney (CRFK) cells and are harmless to humans. We have now evaluated a wide variety of semisynthetic-modified glycopeptide antibiotics that were previously found to inhibit HIV (Balzarini et al., 2003, Printsevskaya et al., 2005), for their side-by-side activity against both SARS-CoV and FIPV. These studies were aimed to determine (i) whether these glycopeptide antibiotic derivatives would also be active against SARS-CoV and FIPV, and, if so, (ii) whether there would be a correlation in their structure-activity relationship for both coronaviruses. These studies should also reveal whether FIPV could be used as a surrogate virus to discover active compounds against SARS-CoV. The antiviral activity values found for FIPV and SARS-CoV in this study were compared with the previously reported anti-HIV data (Balzarini et al., 2003).",

The Vero and CRFK cells were seeded in 200 \u03bcl-wells of 96-well-microtiter plates and grown to nearly confluency. The drugs were then added to the cell cultures before virus was administered. This allows the compounds to block any of the different steps in the virus-infected process, including virus adsorption. Three days (SARS-CoV) or 4 days (FIPV) after infection, the number of viable cells was quantified by a tetrazolium (MTT, 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide (Sigma Chemical Co., St. Louis, MO))-based colorimetric method as previously described for HIV by Pauwels et al. (1988). The cytotoxic concentration was determined as the concentration of the compound that reduced cell viability by 50% (50% cytotoxic concentration (CC50)) and the antivirally effective concentration was determined as the compound concentration that suppressed the viral cytopathic effect by 50% (50% effective concentration (EC50)). An EC50 value preceeded by the sign \u201c>\u201d means that the indicated compound concentration does not afford antiviral activity. Higher (five-fold) concentrations were either not evaluated, or, were cytotoxic to the cell cultures. A CC50 value preceeded by the sign \u201c>\u201d means that at the indicated compound concentration no significant cytotoxicity was observed.",

Moreover, no marked correlation was found between the EC50 values of the compounds against both coronaviruses (Fig. 1\n).

These observations may point to a rather specific interaction of the compounds with a viral (HIV) factor that is absent in the coronavirus entry process. Although we assume that the glycopeptide antibiotics, akin to their action against HIV, most likely interfere with the coronavirus entry process, it is known that both human and type II feline coronaviruses recognize a different cellular receptor to enter their target cells (i.e. angiotensin converting enzyme-2 (ACE-2) for SARS-CoV and feline aminopeptidase N for FIPV) (Li et al., 2003, Tresnan et al., 1996). Therefore, both viruses may obviously have different structural requirements for optimal interaction with the glycopeptide antibiotic derivatives.",

Indeed, the observation that the CRFK cells used in the FIPV assay are generally more sensitive to the toxic effects of the compounds than the Vero cells used in the SARS-CoV assay, and that the compounds were generally also endowed with lower EC50 values (more potent antiviral activity) against FIPV than SARS-CoV, may be in agreement of the latter hypothesis. The elucidation of the molecular basis of the interaction of the lipophylic glycopeptide antibiotics with their cellular or viral target is currently subject of further investigations in our laboratory and may lead to the rational design of more potent and specific anti-coronavirus glycopeptide antibiotic derivatives. In a preliminary experiment, the teicoplanin glycopeptide antibiotic has been included in a \u201ctime-of-addition\u201d experiment, in which the administration of the compound was delayed for several time periods after virus infection. A reference pyridine N-oxide compound known to inhibit the transcription process (Balzarini et al., 2006) was added as a control compound. Clearly, the addition of the glycopeptide antibiotic to the virus-infected cell cultures could be markedly less delayed after FIPV infection than the pyridine N-oxide compound (data not shown) to ascertain full antiviral activity of the compound. These data point to inhibition of a much earlier event in the infection cycle of the virus than targeted by the pyridine N-oxide derivative, and may be suggestive for inhibition of the viral entry process as also shown to be the target of inhibition of HIV infection (Balzarini et al., 2003).",

            "text": "The most antivirally active lipophylic glycopeptide analogues have EC50 values between 3 and 5 \u03bcM against coronaviruses. This is in the same range as the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) at which vancomycin and teicoplanin are inhibitory to Staphylococcus aureus. Several lipophilic glycopeptides have been given to humans (oritavancin, telavancin) without acute side effects, and it is therefore possible that a therapeutic agent based on the lipophilic glycopeptide structure described in this study could become a useful therapeutic agent. Recently it was demonstrated that adamantyl-2 amide of eremomycin (AN0900) is effective in a vegetative anthrax intravascular infection in BALB/c mouse model, and implies excellent deep tissue penetration. Pharmacokinetic parameters of AN0900 obtained after single dose intravenous administration to mice showed that AN0900 had long half-life (185 min), high tissue levels (Vss 26285 ml/kg) and deep tissue penetration (lung, spleen) in comparison with vancomycin. AN0900 completely protects mice in a mouse model of inhalational anthrax at doses as low as 10 mg/kg when given subcutaneously (Maples et al., 2005). However, given the limited selectivity index seen for most of the glycopeptide antibiotics included in this study, it is felt that further improvement of potency and/or selectivity needs to be made before a clinical candidate lead compound can be put forward. Our structure-activity relationship study may be helpful to design such novel compounds.",

In fact, whereas the introduction of a hydrophobic substituent is beneficial for both antiviral and antibacterial activities, the lack of the sugar moieties in the glycopeptide molecules is often detrimental for antibacterial activity, although several hydrophobic derivatives of eremomycin and teicoplanin aglycons are known to exhibit good antibacterial activity (Printsevskaya et al., 2003). However, the fact that the antibacterial activity of the glycopeptide derivatives evaluated in this study is mainly based on their ability to inhibit the bacterial cell wall biosynthesis by a reversible non-covalent binding of the drugs to the d-Ala-d-Ala fragment of the prokaryotic peptidoglycan cell wall precursor (Walsh, 1993), an efficient dissection must be able between antiviral and antibacterial activity, since the molecular target (peptidoglycan synthesis) for antibacterial activity is entirely absent in viruses and mammalian cells.",

Some of the compounds inhibited virus infection in the lower micromolar range without measurable cytotoxicity at 80\u2013100 \u03bcM. Although the molecular mechanism of anti-HIV and anti-FIPV action is likely to be the viral entry process, no close correlation could be established between the activity of the compounds against HIV-1 and both coronaviruses, or between their activity against SARS-CoV and the FIPV. It would appear, therefore, that the FIPV model is not an adequate surrogate model for detecting specific anti-SARS coronavirus inhibitors within the structural class of glycopeptide antibiotics.",
