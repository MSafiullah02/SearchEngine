Experimental samples were treated by pasteurization. The results of blood-group typing, irregular antibody screening, and cross-matching were compared between these 2 groups. Finally, samples of suspected SARS-CoV-2 were treated with pasteurization. Treated samples were used to test transfusion compatibility. Patients with suspected COVID-19 then received red blood cell (RBC) transfusion, and the effectiveness and safety of these transfusion were evaluated.",

In the Rh blood group, the agglutination intensity of D antigen was reduced from 4+ to between 2+ and 3+ after heat treatment (Fig. 1). Regarding the effect of heat treatment on irregular antibody screening, our results showed that the response pattern of panel cells remained unchanged after heat treatment when the agglutination intensity was negative(-), uncertain(\u00b1) or zero, and 1+, 2+, or 3+, respectively. However, the agglutination intensities of samples rating 4+ were reduced to 3+ after heat treatment (Fig. 2). Finally, no effect of heat treatment on the primary cross-matching was observed.",

Reports indicated that SARS-CoV-2 was sensitive to heat and thermal inactivation could efficiently eliminate the coronavirus infectivity.6 Heat treatment causes RBCs to rupture and form RBC fragments, which may have affected the detection results. Especially in gel microcolumns, false-positive results are likely. Therefore, the classic test-tube method should be used to instead of blood-type cards to perform blood-group typing of the heat-treated samples. However, irregular antibody screening and cross-matching could be performed using the anti\u2013human-globulin card method.",
