Recent emergence events exemplified by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) in humans (1) and swine acute diarrhea syndrome coronavirus (SADS-CoV) in domestic pigs (2) have demonstrated how devastating these viruses can be within naive populations. To date, there are no approved antivirals or effective vaccines that protect humans from coronavirus diseases.

Replication of the virus initiates with the engagement of the spike glycoprotein with a host cell receptor and the release of the positive-sense RNA into the cytoplasm of the cell. The large (\u223c32-kb) viral genomic RNA is translated to produce two long polyproteins, pp1a and pp1ab, which are processed by viral proteases, including the papain-like proteases (PLP1 and/or PLP2) and the 3C-like protease (3CLpro or Mpro), into 16 nonstructural proteins (nsp1-16, Fig. 1A). To generate the viral replication complex, the coronaviral nsp\u2019s sequester host endoplasmic reticulum (ER) to generate convoluted membranes and double-membrane vesicles (DMVs), which are the sites of viral RNA synthesis (3, 4). The viral replication complex generates a nested set of double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) intermediates to produce copious amounts of mRNAs, which are then translated to produce the structural (spike, envelope, membrane, and nucleocapsid) and virus-specific accessory proteins. The genomic RNA and structural proteins assemble in the ER-Golgi intermediate compartment to generate infectious virus particles that are released from the cell (5, 6).",

As a result, CoVs have evolved multiple strategies to counteract and delay activation of these host immune responses and establish an environment amenable to virus replication. These strategies include (i) expressing species-specific accessory proteins as modulators of innate immune responses (reviewed in reference 7), (ii) encoding highly conserved nonstructural proteins that serve as interferon (IFN) antagonists (8\u201310), and (iii) sequestering viral RNA in DMVs (3, 4) to prevent detection by host pattern recognition receptors. A key component in the assembly of the DMVs is nsp3 (11, 12). To date, eleven distinct nsp3 domains have been identified using either bioinformatic approaches or enzymatic studies (Fig. 1A). Here, we focus on two multifunctional components contained within nsp3, the macrodomain (MAC) and papain-like protease 2 (PLP2).",

Structural and biochemical studies revealed that the X domain exhibited structural similarity to the cellular histone MacroH2a and catalyzed measurable ADP-ribose-1\u2033-phosphatase (ADRP) activity (16\u201318), although the functional significance of this enzymatic activity was unclear. Using reverse genetics to inactivate the catalytic site of the enzyme, researchers found that ADRP activity was not essential for CoV replication in cultured cells (19). However, further studies revealed that an ADRP-catalytic mutant virus was attenuated in mice (20) and that ADRP activity in SARS-CoV and human CoV-229E mediated resistance to antiviral interferon responses (21). These findings were consistent with an essential role for enzymatic activity in vivo, although the target for the ADRP activity was still unclear. A breakthrough came in 2016 from a study revealing that the macrodomain of HEV acts as an ADP-ribose hydrolase (22). ADP-ribosylation is a known posttranslational modification that regulates cellular activities (23); therefore, viral enzymes that reverse this process could interrupt host cell signaling. For CoVs, nsp3 macrodomain activity was shown to promote MHV-induced encephalitis (24) and increase virulence during SARS-CoV infection (25).",

PLpro also functions as a deubiquitinating enzyme (DUB) which is capable of removing polyubiquitin chains from substrates (28, 29). Structural studies revealed that CoV PLpro/PLP2s are similar to cellular DUBs (30). Enzymatic analysis revealed that CoV PLpro/PLP2s are multifunctional, with protease, deubiquitinating, and deISGylating activities (30\u201333). Viral DUB activity has been implicated as a modulator of the innate immune response to viral infection (32, 34, 35), but the target(s) of the DUB activity has not yet been identified. Thus, both the PLP2 and macrodomains of nsp3 have been independently identified as contributors to coronavirus virulence.",

Complementation analysis indicated that tsNC11 harbors mutations in the open reading frame 1a (ORF1a) region of the replicase polyprotein, but the specific mutations were unknown. To identify the nucleotide changes in tsNC11, we isolated the genomic RNA from the viral supernatant, subjected it to deep sequencing, and then aligned the reads to the genomic sequence of MHV strain A59 (MHV-A59) (GenBank accession no. AY910861). In agreement with the complementation study by Schaad et al. (36), the sequence analysis revealed seven nonsynonymous substitutions in ORF1a of tsNC11. These substitutions resulted in 7 amino acid (aa) changes: two in nsp2 (I4V and T543I), four in nsp3, and one in nsp10 (P23S). The four mutations within nsp3 are distributed between the macrodomain (K532E and G554D) and the PLP2 domain (D1026N and D1071N) (Fig. 1A). As noted above, previous studies documented the importance of the macrodomain and PLP2 domain in virus replication and disease; therefore, we focused our efforts on evaluating how these substitutions contributed to the ts phenotype, the stability of the phenotype, and the pathogenesis of the virus in mice.",

As expected, all viruses replicated to high titers and formed similarly sized plaques at 32\u00b0C (Fig. 2, upper panel). tsNC11 is profoundly temperature sensitive, with a low number of plaques detected at the 10\u22121 dilution on the plate incubated at the nonpermissive temperature. The tsNC11 plaques that were detected at the nonpermissive temperature exhibited a large-plaque phenotype, suggesting that these viruses may be revertants. We found that the PLP2mut virus formed large plaques at 40\u00b0C, which is consistent with the results of the kinetic analysis and indicates that the mutations in the PLP2 domain are not sufficient to cause the ts phenotype. Analysis of the MACmut virus revealed a mixed population of small and large plaques at the nonpermissive temperature, the majority of which displayed the small-plaque phenotype. The MAC/PLP2 mutant virus mirrored the plaque size and plating efficiency of tsNC11. We calculated the EOP values, which represent the ratio of viral titers obtained at 40\u00b0C and at 32\u00b0C (Fig. 2B). Again, the PLP2mut and icWT viruses had similar titers at both temperatures, resulting in an EOP of \u223c1. In contrast, the MACmut virus exhibited titers that were significantly lower at 40\u00b0C than the titers obtained at 32\u00b0C (EOP of 10\u22122). These results indicate that the MACmut virus, but not the PLP2mut or icWT viruses, has a defect in plaque formation at the nonpermissive temperature. Taken together, these data demonstrate that the mutations in the macrodomain, but not those in the PLP2 domain, are the major determinants of the ts phenotype of tsNC11. In addition, these results are consistent with a critical role of the macrodomain in viral replication. Interestingly, we found that the MAC/PLP2 mutant virus mirrored the plaque size and low reversion frequency of tsNC11 (EOP of 10\u22125), supporting a role for the PLP2 domain as a genetic enhancer of the ts phenotype. A genetic enhancer, as defined by genetic studies of eukaryotic organisms, is a mutation in one gene that intensifies the phenotype caused by a mutation in another gene (38).",

The large plaques consistently appeared even after several rounds of plaque purification of the small-plaque isolates. Therefore, we sought to determine whether the small plaques were formed by temperature-sensitive viruses while the large plaques were due to revertant viruses. To address this question, we selectively isolated plaques with different sizes and propagated them at 32\u00b0C to obtain viral stocks for subsequent analysis (Fig. 3). We found that the small-plaque isolates recapitulated the phenotype of the parental MACmut virus: small plaques and similar EOP values (Fig. 3A). In contrast, the large-plaque isolates exhibited a phenotype similar to that of icWT. Sequencing results of PCR amplicons, representing the region spanning the macrodomain and the PLP2 domain, revealed that small-plaque isolates had no additional mutations in either the macrodomain or PLP2. In contrast, the large-plaque isolates had either a true reversion (D554 to G) or harbored putative suppressive mutations located within the macrodomain or the adjacent downstream sequence (Fig. 3B). Among seven large-plaque revertants, all maintained the K532E mutation, indicating it was not associated with the ts phenotype. Three isolates had the D554-to-G reversion, suggesting that it may be sufficient for the ts phenotype of the MACmut virus. We found that isolates 4 to 7 maintained the engineered mutations but had also acquired additional, potentially suppressive mutations in the downstream region. Together, these results indicate that altering the coding sequence of either the macrodomain or the downstream region is likely sufficient to revert or suppress the ts phenotype caused by the G554D mutation. We also evaluated the MAC-PLP2 region of tsNC11 large-plaque revertant viruses and found that all three isolates had the D554-to-G reversion (Fig. 3C), consistent with our findings with the MACmut revertants.",

We found that the replication of the MACmut virus was defective at 40\u00b0C but not at 37\u00b0C. In addition, the MACmut virus exhibited a higher EOP value (10\u22122) than that of tsNC11 (10\u22124) (Fig. 2B), indicating a relatively high reversion frequency. These data imply that mutations outside the macrodomain may enhance the ts phenotype by stabilizing the replication defect, thereby preventing reversion to the wild-type phenotype (38). Therefore, we sought to determine whether the addition of the PLP2 mutations observed in tsNC11 could enhance the ts phenotype of the MACmut virus and reduce reversion. We found that the MAC/PLP2mut virus exhibits a severe replication defect at both 37 and 40\u00b0C (Fig. 1B) and replicated only under permissive conditions, similar to tsNC11. The MAC/PLP2mut and tsNC11 viruses exhibited similar EOP values (\u223c10\u22124) (Fig. 2B). Of note, the low titer of the MAC/PLP2mut virus at 40\u00b0C indicates a low level of reversion to the wild-type phenotype, suggesting that the PLP2 mutations stabilize the MACmut virus. Taken together, these data demonstrate that while the PLP2 mutations are not sufficient to cause the ts phenotype, they act to enhance the ts phenotype caused by the mutation in the macrodomain. Enhancement of phenotypes has been described for other coronavirus interacting proteins (39, 40), which motivated us to determine whether the enhancement phenotype we detected here is due to an interaction between the macro and PLP2 domains.",

The capacity of the PLP2 mutations to enhance the ts phenotype in the presence of the macrodomain mutations raises the possibility of domain-domain interaction between the macrodomain and PLP2. To test this hypothesis, we generated plasmids that express either an epitope-tagged macrodomain (HA-MAC) or PLP2 domain (PLP2-V5) (depicted in Fig. 4A). When these plasmids were cotransfected into HEK-293T cells, expression of both the macrodomain and PLP2 was detectable by the cognate epitope antibodies (Fig. 4B). We detected HA-MAC in lysates immunoprecipitated with anti-V5, and inversely, PLP2-V5 was detected when HA-MAC was immunoprecipitated from the lysates. These results indicate that the ectopically expressed macrodomain associates with PLP2 in cell lysates, consistent with either a direct or indirect interaction.",

To determine whether the mutations in the macrodomain and/or the PLP2 domain alter protein stability, plasmid DNA expressing wild-type or mutant forms of MAC/PLP2 polypeptide (Fig. 5A) were transfected into HEK-293T cells. The cells were maintained at 37\u00b0C throughout the experiment. We added cycloheximide (CHX) at 16 h posttransfection to block translation and harvested cell lysates at the indicated times. The level of expressed proteins was determined by immunoblotting (Fig. 5B and C). The MAC/PLP2 (WT) protein was maintained at levels comparable to those prior to treatment up to 5 h posttreatment with CHX. In contrast, we detected rapid reductions in the levels of all of the mutant forms of the protein. Addition of the proteasome inhibitor MG132 blocked degradation of the proteins (Fig. 5B and C). These results indicate that mutations in both the MAC and PLP2 domains affect protein folding and stability, rendering the proteins more susceptible to proteasome-mediated degradation.",

In addition, coronaviral macrodomains have been shown to suppress IFN production both in vitro and in vivo (20, 21, 24, 25). We sought to determine whether the mutations in the macrodomain and PLP2 modulate the type I interferon response during infection of macrophages. As shown in Fig. 7A, infection of mouse bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs) with mutant viruses at the permissive temperature produced significantly more IFN-\u03b1 during infection than icWT virus infection. At 12 h postinfection, the MACmut virus induced 2-fold more IFN-\u03b1 than icWT virus. Furthermore, the level of N gene transcripts, which reveals the abundances of all viral mRNAs, was reduced in the MACmut-infected cells compared to that for the wild-type virus. We found that the PLP2mut virus elicited dramatically more IFN-\u03b1 than WT virus, while the level of N gene expression was similar. The MAC/PLP2mut virus exhibited the most robust IFN-\u03b1 response and the lowest level of N gene expression. These results show that mutations in the macrodomain and the PLP2 domain result in elevated levels of type I IFN mRNA expression during infection of macrophages, further supporting the role of the macrodomain and PLP2 in modulating host innate immunity.",

Here, we described an unanticipated interplay between two previously characterized virulence factors, the macrodomain and the papain-like protease, of coronaviruses. The enzymatic activities of these domains have been implicated in removing posttranslational modifications: macrodomains remove mono- or poly-ADP-ribose from proteins (18, 22, 23), and the deubiquitinating activity of viral papain-like proteases removes mono- or polyubiquitin chains from signaling proteins (30, 32, 47). Our study stems from characterizing a temperature-sensitive mutant virus that harbored mutations within both the macrodomain and the PLP2 domain of nsp3. We found that the mutation within the macrodomain (G554D) was associated with the most significant temperature-sensitive phenotype but that this alteration of the macrodomain reverted to the wild-type phenotype at high frequency. However, viruses containing mutations in both the macrodomain and the PLP2 domain reverted less frequently, consistent with the PLP2 domain having an enhancing effect on the ts phenotype. Although these two enzymes reside within the same nsp3 polypeptide (Fig. 1A), to our knowledge this is the first suggestion of an interplay between these domains. By expressing the macrodomain and papain-like protease 2 domain on independent expression plasmids, we were able to evaluate and detect coimmunoprecipitation of the proteins, which is consistent with either a direct or an indirect interaction. Furthermore, we report that the mutations identified in the macrodomain and PLP2 domain destabilize the proteins, as revealed by proteasome-dependent degradation. Lastly, we demonstrated that these mutant viruses promote type I IFN production from macrophages in tissue culture and are attenuated in mice. This study confirms and extends previous studies that independently identified the macrodomain and the papain-like protease 2 domain as modulators of the innate immune response and virulence factors (reviewed in references 31, 35, 48, and 49).",

Studies of the alphavirus chikungunya virus (CHIKV) revealed that the macrodomain at the N terminus of nsp3 hydrolyzes ADP-ribose groups from monoribosylated proteins and that this deribosylating activity is critical for CHIKV replication in vertebrate and insect cells and for virulence in mice (50). Interestingly, viruses engineered to encode a mutation of the CHIKV macrodomain catalytic site rapidly reverted to the wild-type sequence (51), similar to the high-frequency reversion we reported for the MHV MACmut virus (Fig. 3). Studies of the role of the macrodomain during coronavirus replication indicate that catalytic activity is not required for virus replication in interferon-nonresponsive cell lines (19, 20, 24). However, catalytic activity is important for replication in primary cells and in mice, implicating the macrodomain in evading the innate immune response and promoting viral pathogenesis (20, 24, 25). Identifying the ribosylated substrates that are targeted by the viral enzymatic activity is an important future direction for this work.",

Interestingly, the helicase domain adjacent to the macrodomain of HEV was found to modulate macrodomain activity. Biochemical assays revealed that the presence of the HEV helicase domain in cis enhanced the binding of the macrodomain to ADP-ribose and stimulated the hydrolase activity (22). Furthermore, we previously found that mutations in the Ubl2 domain could cause a ts phenotype and destabilize the PLP2 domain (52). Here, we found that the mutations in the macrodomain and PLP2 domain destabilized the replicase proteins, as shown by the more rapid degradation of the proteins after temperature shift. We speculate that there may be a dynamic interaction between adjacent domains within the nsp3 polyproteins.",

To date, four essential functions have been documented for this multidomain protein: (i) interaction of the Ubl1 domain with the nucleocapsid (N) protein, which is important for genomic RNA synthesis and encapsidation (39, 40); (ii) proteolytic processing of the N-terminal region of pp1a and pp1ab to release nsp1, nsp2, and nsp3 (26, 27); (iii) hijacking of the cellular reticular network in concert with other membrane-associated proteins (nsp4 and nsp6) to form virus-specific membrane structures for RNA synthesis (11, 12); and (iv) antagonizing of the innate immune response through the actions of the de-ADP-ribosylating activity of the macrodomain and the deubiquitinating activity of the PLP2 domain (reviewed in references 31 and 48). The removal of posttranslational modifications such as ADP-ribosylation and polyubiquitination could be directed at cellular proteins either to redirect them for use during viral replication or to subvert signaling of innate immune responses. Ultimately, structural and biochemical studies will be needed to fully investigate the multiple cis and trans interactions of nsp3 and to determine whether there is a dynamic interplay that modulates the stability, substrate specificity, and/or affinity of the enzymes and substrates.",

For nsp10, previous studies revealed that this protein plays critical roles in 3C-like-protease-mediated polyprotein processing and viral RNA synthesis (54, 55). The results from these studies indicate that the mutations in nsp2 and nsp10 may also contribute to a ts phenotype.
