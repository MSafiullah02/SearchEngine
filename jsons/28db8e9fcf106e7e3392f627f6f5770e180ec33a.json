The RTS,S/AS01 is the only world's first European Medicines Agency (EMA) approved malaria vaccine with partial protection in young children (36.3%) for use to only Sub-Saharan African region along with severe adverse effect (24.2%-28.4%) and incurable adverse effect (1.5%-2.5%) [61, 62] . In addition, the efficacy was further declined to almost zero after 4 th year and negative in 5 th year [63] . The aforementioned facts warrant exhaustive efforts/research towards the development of a more effective PV that can elicit robust immune response globally. The present study is an extension of our previous report [24] that exploits 5 homologous antigens conserved among human malaria parasites P. falciparum, P. vivax, P. ovale and P. malariae (with minimum 38.62% identity recognized through BLASTp tool) as potential platform for designing of PVs [64] .",

In this context, the exploitation of computational approaches is not only cost-effective for vaccine development but also diminishes time period and risk of failure in experimental studies [26, 27, 65, 66] . In this study, 82 continuous B cell epitopes were forecasted from 5 GDPAP using BCPREDS (Supplementary Table S1 ). These 82 continuous B cell epitopes were found to possess total 433 T-cell epitopes including 142 HLA class I epitopes and 291 HLA class II epitopes (Supplementary Table S2 ). These T-cell epitopes were forecasted from the pool of predicted continuous B-cell epitopes as the antigen presentation to T-cells was supposed to be more J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f efficient if it is recognized by the B-cell. In addition, an antigen-specific B-cell may present multiple T-cell epitopes to the immune system and, thus enhances its ability to be triggered in a specific manner [67] [68] [69] . Further, based on the PPC analysis an epitope ensemble of 13 HLA class I epitopes with 98.75% and 3 HLA class II epitopes with 56.85% world coverage were designed using criteria described previously (Table 2 ) [24] . However, a combined set of 16 were also reported in similar study conducted by Pritam et al. [24] . ",

However, mainly the CD4+ T lymphocytes (also known as helper T cell (Th), Th1 and Th2) elicit IFN-\u03b3 and IL-4, correspondingly) regulate the malaria infection [68, 70] . Besides these, TLRs are also involved in the activation of different signalling cascade that ultimately express the genes of pro-inflammatory cytokines like IFN-\u03b3, etc. [71] . The IFN-\u03b3 is associated with depletion of liver-stage parasites [72, 73] . This is also supported by present study, where the epitopes T2, T7, T8, T10, T11 and T1, T2, T3, T4, T5, T6, T7, T8, T9, T11, T12, T13, T14, T16 were found to induce the IFN-\u03b3 and IL-4 responses, correspondingly (Supplementary Table S3 ).

            "text": "Linear B-cell epitopes is linked to antibody generation, where identification of such epitopes using traditional approaches is not only costly but also time consuming with involvement of difficult processes [75] . In order to overcome aforementioned issues, the present study involved the prediction of T-cell epitopes using linear B-cell epitopes as input instead of whole antigen so as to minimize not only the size of PV but also elicit both cellular (T cell epitope) as well as humoral (Bcell epitope) immune responses. Further, the non toxic nature of adjuvants A and B also helps in production of several cytokines (e.g., INF-\u03b3, TNF-\u03b1, IL-2, IL-4, IL-6, IL-12) through induction of dendritic cell, B cell, macrophage and T-cell, which ultimately boost the concentration of the antibodies reported in several studies linked to various disease causing agents including human rotavirus, HIV, Helicobacter pylori, Influenza virus [76] [77] [78] [79] . Therefore, 15 PVs were designed through epitope ensemble of T cell epitopes and/or linear B-cell epitopes having epitope ensemble with different linkers as well as adjuvants, which are responsible for the activation of TLR2 and TLR4 receptors pertaining to malaria. Initially, five non-adjuvant PVs (PV1-PV5) were designed followed by incorporation of TLR2 and TLR4 binding specific adjuvants that resulted into respective design of 10 adjuvant PVs, i.e., PV1A-PV5A and PV1B-PV5B (Table 3) . Further, EAAAK linker was incorporated at N-terminal of PVs as it is stiff and prevents the assembly of adjuvant with other vaccine domain [80, 81] . Although, the adjuvants are found to enhance the immunogenicity of vaccines but they may cause toxicity/adverse reaction. Therefore, we have designed 5 PVs without adjuvants, where the designing of PV1 having only T cell epitopes (HLA J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f class I and II) and they were joined together by using linker L 2 and L 3 . Likewise, in PV2, we have exploited merely linear B-cell epitopes attached together with linker L 3 . Similarly in PV3, both Tand B-cell epitopes were joined with linkers L 2 and L 3 while, in PV4, we have exploited merely linear B-cell epitopes attached together with linker L 2 . Amongst these two linkers, L 3 is a universal linker, which can enhance the proteasome processing along with immunogenicity, while L 2 is a flexible linker that can stimulate better immune response [42, 77, 82] . As exemplary vaccine is found to induce multi-immune response (B-and T-cell immune response), therefore in the designing of further PVs both the T-and B-cell epitopes were used so as to elicit humoral/cellular response [83] . The PV3 and PV5 were differing from each other with respect to linkers L 3 and L 2 , respectively used for joining continuous B-cell epitopes. However, in case of designing a negative polypeptide vaccine control, linkers L2 and L3 were employed to connect non-HLA class I and II T cell epitopes (Table 3 ). -T2-L2-T5-L2-T6-L2-T9-L2-T11-L2-T12-L2-T13-L2-T1-L2-T4-L2-T8-L2-T10-L2-T4-L2-T3-L2-T7-L3-T14-L3-T15-L3-T16-L3  4  PV2 299 T2-L2-T5-L2-T6-L2-T9-L2-T11-L2-T12-L2-T13-L2-T1-L2-T4-L2-T8-L2-T10-L2-T4-L2-T3-L2-T7-L3-T14-L3-T15-L3-T16 14  PV5A  643  L1-A-L1-T2-L2-T5-L2-T6-L2-T9-L2-T11-L2-T12-L2-T13-L2-T1-L2-T4-L2-T8-L2-T10-L2-T4-L2-T3-L2-T7-L3-T14-L3-T15-L3-T16-L2-B2-L2-B5-L2-B6-L2-B8-L2-B9-L2-B10-L2-B9-L2-B1-L2-B4-L2-B3-L2-B7-L2-B11-L2-B5-L2-B13-L2  15  PV5B  649  L1-B-L1-T2-L2-T5-L2-T6-L2-T9-L2-T11-L2-T12-L2-T13-L2-T1-L2-T4-L2-T8-L2-T10-L2-T4-L2-T3-L2-T7-L3-T14-L3-T15 A and B) , T-cell epitopes (T1-T16), and B-cell epitopes (B1-B13).",

TLR2 as well as TLR4 are available not only on the immune cells, but also on epithelial cells and fibroblasts that recognizes PAMPs and bridge the innate as well as adaptive immunity of the host by regulating the balance between Th1 and Th2 (50s ribosomal L7/L12) in designed PVs could be the good choice against P. falciparum [77, 78, 86, 93] . Even combining two distinct TLR agonists into an adjuvanted subunit vaccine have showed synergetic protective efficacy [94, 95] . Altogether, these facts led to the hypothesis of using both TLR2 and 4 receptors agonists A and B, respectively in the designed PVs and subsequently docking experiment was performed to reveal the possible association among PVs and TLR [96, 97] . For molecular docking, the tertiary structures of 15 PVs were predicted that revealed more than 80 % of amino acids in favoured regions. Overall 22 docking studies were carried out using ClusPro2.0 tool including control C1 and C2 against receptors TLR2 and TLR4, respectively (Table 4 ). This resulted into total 18 docked models, i.e., M1 to M18 including 16 PVs and 2 controls. It is quite interesting to note that the PVs designed without adjuvants were also able to interact (dock) with TLR2 and TLR4 (having good energy scores) over control except PV3. Therefore, they might be capable to elicit innate immunity [98] [99] [100] , which are in well agreement with earlier studies regarding the rapid production of IFN-\u03b3 [101, 102] . Amongst 15 designed PVs, PV3, PV5A and PV4B were not able to dock by ClusPro tool with their respective receptors. So, a total 12 potential PVs with 16 docked models were obtained for TLR2-TLR1 (M2-M9) and TLR4-MD2 (M11-M18).",

These clearly indicated that the PVs without adjuvants have interacting domain to induce innate immune system. This is in agreement with the recent study where human TLR4-derived self-assembling peptide nanoparticles have been used as non toxic vaccine adjuvant with filarial antigenic protein to induce the immunological responses in mice [103] . Besides these, the linker L2 has been utilized in the designing of PV1A, PV3B and PV4 (Table 4 ). However, based on overall docking J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f 18 score, PV1A (-1275.5) and PV3B (-1269.2) against receptors TLR2 and TLR4, respectively were selected as leading PVs for further structural and functional analysis (Fig. 4) . were forecasted by AllergenFP tool at threshold value > 0.8.

The IgG antibodies (named in order of decreasing abundance IgG1, IgG2, IgG3, and IgG4) are one of the most abundant pathogens neutralizing molecules found in human serum. These antibodies share more than 90% amino acid sequence identity but each subclass has exclusive effector properties including half-life, epitope binding, immunological complex formation, complement activation, triggering of effector cells and placental transport. Moreover, the IgG profile of a given individual is determined by their inherited allotypes that can potentially influence the clinical manifestation of the immune response [122] . However, broadly neutralizing J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f antibodies (bNAbs) have been found in a rare population of patients that control the infection [123] [124] [125] . These bNAbs tend to target different conserved antigenic regions exposed on the outer surfaces of a pathogen across the circulating strains. Here, in the present study, a protein-protein global docking method (ClusPro server) was used to reveal the shape complementarity between PVs (as ligands) and the interacting domains of antibodies IgG1 and IgG3 (as the receptors) to eliminate the need of a long term exposure of malaria patients to selected antigen mimetics PV1A and PV3B involving the epitopes (B1, B4 and B5) of P.falciparum strains. These antibodies could be considered as bNAbs if they found with a well detectable neutralization activity in wet lab experimental studies [126] [127] [128] [129] [130] . Furthermore, the respective source proteins P28, P25 and MSP1of epitopes B1, B4 and B5 have been characterized as leading vaccine candidates [130, 131] . Also, the antibodies IgG1 and IgG3 have been found associated with human malaria protection [132, 133] .",

The Codon Adaptation Index (CAI) values for PV1A and PV3B were 0.9857 and 0.9584, respectively. For reliable optimization of codon, CAI value should lie between 0.9-1.0 [138] . However, the GC content of improved DNA sequence of PV1A and PV3B were found 42.12% and 43.12% which are lying in the optimal range (30% to 70%) that could be easily expressed in any suitable expression host [139] . Although, P. falciparum antigens could be expressed in E. coli but require the codon harmonization (reduction of amino acid J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f misincorporation) to improve the immunogenicity [140] . In the present study, the solubilisation probability of recombinant proteins (PV1A and PV3B) to be expressed in E. coli revealed by bioinformatics tools RPSP, Protein-Sol, CamSol and SOLPro was lower compare to positive vaccine controls (C3, C4) that indicated to look for alternative expression host (Table 5) .",

In recent years, several wet lab studies have confirmed the utilization of L. lactis as an expression host to produce properly folded, pure and stable chimeric and/ or single antigenic proteins of many pathogens that elicited high levels of functional antibodies/cytokines including P.

Moreover, L. lactis-mediated delivery of DNA vaccines also lead to the expression of post-translationally modified antigens by host cells resulting in presentation of conformationally restricted epitopes to the immune system for induction of both cellular and humoral immune responses [112] .",

Finally, the size of PV1A and PV3B recombinant DNA (obtained after insertion of cDNA into pIL1 expression vector) was observed as 7477 bp and 8377 bp, respectively which lies inside the ORF and could be translated into respective protein sequences with four additional amino acids (MCKC) at the Nterminus (Fig. 10) . Therefore, an ideal multi-epitope polypeptide vaccine should compose of a series of epitopes and or adjuvants that can elicit simultaneous and strong innate and adaptive However, the present problems in the field of multi-epitope vaccine design include the selection of appropriate candidate antigens and systematic arrangement of their immunodominant epitopes for effective oral delivery through virus-like particles and SAPN.

One of the major bottlenecks of malaria vaccine development is immune escape mechanism of pathogen through antigenic variation and/ or HLA diversity. The designed PVs (PV1A and PV3B) under present study may overcome the aforementioned issues as they possess both B and T cell epitopes derived from 5 antigenic proteins that involve multi stages of pathogen life-cycle with worldwide human population coverage (99.46%). Moreover, these PVs have the higher potential to elicit both innate (TLR2 and TLR4) and adaptive (cellular and humoral) immune responses.

The C-ImmSim is a simulator of agent-based model, which forecasts the induction of immune response (Cellular and humoral response) along with forecast of T cell epitope as well as B-cell epitope [50]. The default simulation parameters were chosen except HLA allele, number of antigen (10000) and time steps [51]. The host HLA alleles (HLA-A*02:01, HLA-B*53:01 and HLA-DRB1*04:11) were selected based on prevalent alleles associated with human malaria [52-55].

The advantage of using linkers and adjuvants used in the present study for designing of multi-epitope malaria PVs have been also revealed by several contemporary researchers against other diseases [36, 84, 85] to enhance the antigen processing and presentation ability as well as immunogenicity. Also, the cost effective Cholera toxin B subunit adjuvant is cytokines inducer (Th1 and Th2 response) which increases the antibody titration [86]. Thus, the use of both T cell and B cell epitopes together with linkers and adjuvants can increase the potential of PVs towards induction of multi immune responses.",

The C4 is a novel fusion protein of Staphylococcus aureus that indicated a high titer of specific antibodies (IgG1 and IgG2a) responses and decrease the viable cell counts through elicitation of mixture of Th1, Th2, and Th17 immune responses. The simulation results were displayed no alteration in antigen level as well as immunogenic responses except generation of IFN-\u03b3 against negative control (C5). While the positive vaccine controls as well as PV1A/PV3B showed drastic decrease in antigen counts that ultimately reached to zero after 5th day of injection (SupplementaryFig. 1). Besides these, they were also involved in the elicitation of B lymphocytes, cytotoxic T lymphocytes, helper T lymphocytes and macrophages responses that lead to generation of cytokines (IFN-\u03b3, TGF-\u03b2, IL-2, IL-10 and IL-12) as well as antibody titration (IgG + IgM and IgG1 + IgG2).The generation of high level of IgM under study pointing towards better primary immune response as well as decrease in antigen level with enhancement in B cell population with antibodies (IgM, IgG + IgM), which further reflecting good secondary and tertiary immune responses. These results agree well with the earlier finding of Shey et al.[66]. Utilizing similar in silico approach, the leading PVs designed and characterized in the present study was compared with the wet lab experimental data ofKaba  et al. [48] and Ahmadi et al. [49] (Table 6). The predicted result of immune simulation indicated the elicitation of macrophages, B and T lymphocytes for the production of cytokines (IFN-\u03b3, TGF-\u03b2, IL-2, IL-10 and IL-12) as well as antibodies (IgG + IgM and IgG1 + IgG2) against proposed top two PVs which seems to be similar observations obtained by aforementioned research group in mice. Fig. 7 summarizes the comparative account on immune simulations of C3, C4 with one of leading PVs (PV1A) having higher potential to induce protective immune responses that might be owing to use of Cholera toxin B subunit adjuvant. Therefore, designing strategy used in PV1A/PV3B could be highly effective in stimulation immune responses. Moreover, validity of immunoinformatics tools for prediction of epitopes, protective immune response analysis, constructing chimeric multi-epitope vaccine, assessment of vaccine safety as well as efficacy and immunization modelling have been exercised in the last five years with more than 500 literatures in the PMC database that assisted in the preclinical and clinical studies of several vaccine project including Hepatitis B Virus, Dengue, Schistosoma haematobium, Treponema pallidum, S. aureus, Trypanosoma cruzi, Helicobacter pylori, Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus, Zika virus [26, 45,119, 120]. Therefore, the use of bioinformatics tools for prediction of antigenicity, epitopes and molecular interaction are convenient and adequate approach in vaccine design and development [47, 84, 121].",

It also provided the profiles of deformability (c, d), mobility (e, f), eigenvalue (g, h), variance map (i, j), covariance matrix (k, l) and elastic network (m, n). The value of NMA-B-factors (mobility) indicated the relative amplitude of the atomic displacements around the equilibrium conformation. While the deformability calculated the gradient of the atomic displacements summed over all modes at every atomic position. High values are expected in flexible regions such as hinges or linkers between domains, whereas low values usually correspond to rigid parts. The obtained higher and lower values of maximum mobility and deformability for PV3B (2.038E+02, 1.088E-06) indicated towards more flexible regions compare to PV1A (3.443E+01, 4.740E-06). The eigenvalue associated to each normal mode represented the motion stiffness. Lower the eigenvalue, easier the deformation i.e., lower energy is required to deform the complex structure. The respective eigenvalues for PV1A and PV3B complexed with TLR2 and TLR4 were found 1.064E-06 and 7.498E-09 that indicated the greater stability of complex PV1A-TLR2. The individual andcumulative variances associated to each normal mode were inversely related to the eigenvalue. The covariance matrix indicated the coupling between pairs of residues, i.e. whether they experience correlated (red), uncorrelated (white) or anti-correlated (blue) motions whereas elastic network graph characterizes pairs of atoms connected by springs and each dot in the graph represented one spring between the corresponding pair of atoms[137].",
