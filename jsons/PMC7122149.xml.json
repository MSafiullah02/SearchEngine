It also is possible to perform antimicrobial susceptibility testing on cultured isolates, so conventional culture methods with biochemical phenotyping are still the most common procedures performed in clinical microbiology laboratories [1]. To further assist in microbial identification, nucleic acid amplification has been introduced in the clinical microbiology laboratory. Such testing was initially done for viruses, allowing detection of small amounts of viral nucleic acid quickly. Similar tests also have been applied to bacteria, especially those that require cell cultures, are difficult to grow on routine culture media, or are slow growing such as Chlamydia, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, and Mycobacterium. In addition, there are ongoing attempts to apply these new techniques for routine clinical microbiology testing, including the diagnosis of sepsis [1].",

It is a crucial preanalytic step in the development and performance of any successful molecular diagnostic method and ensures a reliable result [3, 4]. We must pay attention to the technical progress of the nucleic acid extraction as well as to the method for amplification and detection of nucleic acids in order to obtain satisfactory results. Nucleic acid extraction consists of three major processes: isolation, purification, and concentration. Commercial extraction kits are commonly used in the clinical microbiology laboratory [2]. These kits provide the essential requirements for nucleic acid extraction. These essential requirements have been well described by Boom et al. [6, 7] as follows: Extraction should be simple, rapid, and should show high sensitivity and specificity. It is preferred that there be no requirements for specialized equipment or special knowledge and skills. The final nucleic acid should be pure and easy to modify for various amplification techniques. The reagents and their product should be harmless, and the process of preparation should resist contamination with other specimens. If the final volume of eluate is small, detection limits are maximized. When we deal with clinical specimens, we also should consider the elimination of potential inhibitors of the DNA polymerase and the removal of pathogenicity from hazardous pathogens as well as good target recovery and establishment of the integrity of nucleic acid targets [2]. Ideally, the final target is pure nucleic acid without amplification inhibitors or contaminants such as protein, carbohydrate, and other nucleic acids [8].",

Usually, we extract DNA or RNA, and some times, we may extract both, depending on the circumstances. The targets for nucleic acid extraction are diverse. They can be the cultured bacterial isolates themselves. Alternatively, we can use culture media, including blood culture bottles or various clinical specimens such as sputum, stool, urine, tissue, or cerebrospinal fluid [1]. In terms of nucleic acid extraction, they may target the same nucleic acid, but they have different implications for the extraction procedure itself. Nucleic acid extraction from cultured bacteria is relatively simple because they are pure colonies and they contain large numbers of organisms. However, we need to recognize that gram-positive bacteria have thick walls, such that nucleic acid extraction is more difficult than it is from gram-negative bacteria, which have thinner walls [5]. For clinical specimens, the details of the method depend on the characteristics of each specimen. It is important to remember that the subject is nucleic acid, not of humans, but of bacteria, virus, or fungus. If we extract from clinical specimens containing human cells, we cannot help mixing human DNA and sometimes, recovery of microbial DNA can be diminished by the presence of human DNA.",

The basic principle of this method is to use the difference in density between the cesium ion and water and intercalation of EtBr, which shows good results for separation of various DNAs and the procurement of high-yield DNA [11]. For example, each DNA can be separated as independent bands as a result of the differences in each DNA\u2019s density in the gradient by the intercalation of EtBr [7]. However, it has important limitations in that it requires an expensive ultracentrifuge and considerable time, it is difficult to perform, and EtBr is harmful [7, 8]. Consequently, this method is not suitable for clinical microbiology and has not been used in the clinical laboratory.",

            "text": "Phenol\u2013chloroform extraction is widely used. The process consists of vigorous mixing of phenol\u2013chloroform solution and sample followed by centrifugation [7]. Phenol does not completely inhibit RNase activity, and this characteristic enables isolation of nucleic acid by combination with chloroform and alcohol [12]. After centrifugation, the upper (aqueous) phase containing the DNA can be separated from the lower (organic) phase containing denatured proteins, and DNA can be precipitated by adding ethanol or isopropanol with a high concentration of salt [8]. After washing with 70% ethanol to remove any remaining ethanol or isopropanol, the final target DNA is collected by dissolving it in TE buffer or sterile distilled water [13]. This method is also used for RNA extraction by concomitant use of guanidinium isothiocyanate. This combination can overcome the limitation of RNA extraction using the guanidinium isothiocyanate itself, so RNA could be isolated conveniently using a single-step technique by Chomczynski et al. [12, 14]. Total RNA is recovered by precipitation with isopropanol after separation of the upper phase containing the total RNA from the lower phase containing DNA and proteins [12, 14]. Although the phenol\u2013chloroform method is relatively easy compared with CsCl/EtBr and is very useful for the extraction of nucleic acids, it is problematic for the clinical microbiology laboratory because phenol has important limitations due to it being toxic, caustic, and flammable [5, 15, 16].",

The function of this siliceous core particle is similar to that of phenol, but it has a few advantages in that it is safer, and cross-contamination can be reduced. It is well known that the precipitation in the phenol/chloroform method causes DNA loss, and Meijer et al. could reduce it by replacing the precipitating step with silica particles [18]. Solid-phase nucleic acid extraction was incorporated into many commercial kits, and it still is the basis of many extraction methods, although siliceous core particles have been replaced by other materials such as silica matrices, glass particles, diatomaceous earth, and anion-exchange carriers (Fig. 11.1) [7].\n",

            "text": "Solid-phase extraction uses a spin column operated by centrifugal force allowing DNA to be purified rapidly and efficiently without the limitations of liquid extraction, including incomplete phase separation [8]. Solid-phase extraction using silica now is one of the most common methods for nucleic acid extraction. Silica that possesses a positive charge combines strongly with DNA, which possesses a negative charge, so it can enable rapid, pure, and quantitative purification [7]. In 1990, Boom et al. [6] used an innovative approach in which diatomaceous earth served as a matrix for solid-phase extraction. The principle of this method is that it immobilizes DNA onto its particles in the presence of a chaotropic agent. The technique can purify rRNA as well as single-stranded and double-stranded DNA. It takes only a short time and can be applied to clinical specimens as well as to DNA and bacteria. The process of solid-phase extraction involves cell lysis, nucleic acid adsorption, washing, and elution [7, 8]. Column conditioning is obtained using a buffer at a particular pH [19]. The nucleic acid will be released after cell lysis and decanting of lysis buffer into the column. Nucleic acid adsorption is completed in a chaotropic salt solution [19]. Washing buffer contains a competitive agent and can remove contaminants such as proteins and salts. In elution, TE buffer is applied to the column so that purified nucleic acid will be released [19].",

The beads have a negative surface charge and bind proteins and cellular debris selectively [7]. So, DNA can be isolated easily from specimens by removing proteins and cellular debris on the beads. This has the potential advantages of removing the need for repeated centrifugation, vacuum filtration, and column separation for washing and elution as well as organic solvents [7, 8]. The magnetic bead method is very simple and convenient; so many commercial kits are available for this method [8]. Some manufacturers combined the techniques of solid-phase extraction using silica and magnetic beads, which satisfies the customers\u2019 requests for time- and labor-effectiveness and efficiency (Fig. 11.2). This method is commonly used in automated extraction methods such as miniMag (bioMerieux) and MagNA Pure (Roche). In terms of new technology, additional commercial kits using this new technique are being launched into the market. The enzymatic method is an example of these new extraction methods [20]. These new methods help investigators by giving advantages of more convenience, requirement for only small volumes of specimen, and enhancement of DNA recovery.\n",

In recent years, we have been able to extract the viral nucleic acid from clinical specimens having cellular components, and there have been a few trials of these kits to detect various clinically important viruses [29\u201331].

However, the detection rates were quite different in another report: only 26.2 and 68.0% between 1 and 2 weeks after disease onset [33].

Many researchers have found that there are numerous PCR inhibitors in blood culture bottles such as sodium polyanetholesulfonate (SPS) and hemins [35]. Millar and collaborators compared several commercial and in-house extraction methods used to detect bacteria and fungi in BacT/Alert blood culture bottles [36]. To reduce the detection time, the serum, plasma, or whole blood is used as a main specimen for detection of bacteria and fungi. Serum or plasma is more efficient and convenient than whole blood because whole blood includes many PCR inhibitors [37]. Most commercial kits showed a high recovery rate of pathogen DNA, but only those methods that used heat lysis with an alkali wash could remove PCR inhibitors. Detection of brucellosis was highly sensitive even though Brucellae are facultative intracellular pathogens [38]. Similarly, kits containing proteinase K showed better yield of Brucella in serum specimens [39]. However, to enhance the sensitivity of PCR amplification, whole blood is considered as a final target because it contains more pathogens than serum or plasma [40]. Although the nucleic acid kits were not developed to extract microbial DNA from whole blood, all commercial kits are able to do so [21]. In recent years, we have been able to use several automated systems to extract bacterial or fungal DNA from whole blood [30, 41, 42], although they are expensive. They are suitable for high-throughput detection [43].",

It is different from whole blood in that the tiny specimen may contain very few causative pathogens. At present, many kinds of commercial or noncommercial DBSs are in use. Because the amount of blood is small, inadequate DNA extraction can be a problem and result in a low sensitivity. Several investigators attempted to detect CMV DNA in DBS using several extraction methods and found that the recovery of CMV DNA differed according to the extraction method used [46\u201350]. The lysis buffer used also can affect the yield of RNA from DBS, and column extraction methods revealed significant loss in RNA recovery [51].",

Moreover, the detection rates in certain clinical specimens such as whole blood are low because of the very low loads of fungal cells [53\u201355]. So the extraction once again is a crucial step and can determine the sensitivity of a particular PCR assay [56, 57]. To recover small amounts of fungal DNA from clinical specimens, a protocol should be established for an optimal extraction method. The QIAamp DNA blood kit was successful in extracting Candida DNA and was suitable to use with a TaqMan-based PCR assay, whereas all other kits tested failed to detect low amounts of Candida DNA [15]. In another study, the investigators were successful with all of the extraction methods used in their study, even though those kits were not specifically designed for the extraction of fungal DNA from whole blood [58]. We encounter a similar difficulty in extracting nucleic acid from Mycobacteria. Many researchers have tried to find optimal extraction methods for most clinically important specimens; the most appropriate method for each laboratory\u2019s situation should be applied [59].",

It is well known that bile salts, hemoglobin, and polysaccharides can inhibit PCR [60, 61]. There also may be contaminating bacterial or fungal DNA in the reagents [39, 58, 62]. Most PCR assays can be influenced by reaction inhibitors and other contaminants, especially when the various clinical specimens containing these inhibitors are used as samples, and nucleic acid extraction thus becomes the crucial step that determines their influence [63]. In previous reports [29, 64], the presence of inhibitors was confirmed when the MagNA Pure Compact system was used for a principal nucleic acid extraction. In one other report [45], the authors compared the MagNA Pure Compact system and QIAamp DNA minikit for the detection of Toxoplasma DNA from blood. The sensitivity of PCR using the MagNA Pure Compact system was lower than that of the QIAamp DNA minikit, so the presence of inhibitors may have been responsible for the difference of sensitivity between the two methods. Moreover, the combination of the extraction kit and the master mix can make a difference in PCR performance in terms of inhibition [44]. We should also consider the fact that many human DNAs are mixed with relatively rare pathogen DNAs in clinical specimens, meaning abundant human DNA will be obtained during extraction for pathogen detection [65].",

However, the manual extraction method is still labor-intensive and time-consuming and requires a well-trained technologist. There were also reports of outbreaks of cross contamination when the samples were treated at the same time [39, 75]. In recent years, many manufacturers developed and launched various automated extraction instruments; these instruments vary in principle, procedure time, cost, and size (Table 11.2). The automated extraction instruments are easily divided by their workload capacity; the most appropriate instrument thus can be selected according to each laboratory\u2019s workload situation from low-throughput instruments such as MagNA Pure compact, NucliSens miniMAG, and BioRobot EZ1 systems to medium- to high-throughput instruments such as the MagNA Pure LC and BioRobot M48/9604 [76].\n",

It provides constant reproducibility for recovery of nucleic acid, avoiding person-to-person variations seen with manual extraction methods.

They compared viral yield using cultured cells containing CMV, EBV, HSV, BK, VZV, or HHV-8. The procedures of the kits were similar, and DNA extraction was successful with all kits. There were some variations of viral yields, which were only 50% compared with those of the manual kits. The differences of yields are not of great significance if we consider the biologic range of viral loads in clinical practice as the manufacturer\u2019s recommendation. In the study of multiplex molecular detection of infection in septic patients using automated extraction, the recovery of DNA was similar to that of the conventional manual method at the point of maximal binding surface of MagNA pure nanoparticles [76]. Many leukocytes are present in the blood sample, so the final DNA amounts recovered by the manual method can be about three times those obtained by MagNA pure extraction [82]. We can face different results for the evaluation of automated extraction instrument. The efficiency of the NucliSens easyMAG was low for CMV [49] and respiratory viruses [29]; however, in another study, the NucliSens miniMAG showed the best results for the isolation of polyomavirus BK virus and the human beta-actin gene from urine specimens [2] and severe respiratory syndrome coronavirus RNA in stool samples [34].",

To use such a system, an expensive instrument and extraction reagents, including disposables, are needed. Sometimes, this increased cost for the automated system precludes its use. However, the influenza A (H1N1) pandemic in 2009 demonstrated the value of an automated extraction system. At that time, requests for influenza A (H1N1) identification were increasing rapidly, and many laboratories could not perform all the requested tests because of limited personnel. This made clear the usefulness of the automated extraction system. Although the detection rates and yield recovery are the most important factors in selecting commercial extraction methods, other factors, including ease of use and cost per extraction, also must be considered [28].",
