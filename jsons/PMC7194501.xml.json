For each patient, only the CXR report with the highest score was considered for this validation study. The frontal chest projection linked to these 100 CXR reports was independently assessed by an experienced thoracic radiologist who reassigned the score for each CXR examination.",

We use the kw (specifically the linear kw) because the CXR scoring system was designed on an 18-point continuous-ordinal scale and the degree of disagreement between the scores had a different weight. The Mann\u2013Whitney U-test was also used to compare CXR scores with the final outcome (recovery or death) in selected patients. We used this non-parametric test because the CXR score was not normally distributed. All statistical analyses were performed using commercial software (MedCalc Statistical Software version 19, Ostend, Belgium). P-values of less than 0.05 were considered statistically significant.",
