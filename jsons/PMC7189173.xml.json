Some difficulties with assessing uveitis patients remotely is the lack of clinical examination for objective signs of inflammation; rather, the consultation relies on patients\u2019 symptoms and simple examination tools such as visual acuity, Amsler, and color vision testing. Nevertheless, KEC is currently exploring the possibility of implementing teleconsultations for stable cases.",
