Inactivated vaccines have been used in exotic and very susceptible carnivores as the use of attenuated CDV is unsafe in these species (Appel and Summers, 1995). The canarypox-vectored CDV MLV (recCDV or rD) vaccine was licensed for use in dogs in 1997 in the USA (Pardo et al., 1997) with the benefit that postvaccinal CDV encephalitis cannot occur with this vaccine. This vaccine is also being used in several Latin American countries where the field pressure of CDV infection is the greatest. Since 2001, the recCDV vaccine has also been available in the USA in monovalent presentation for use in domestic ferrets.",

Although colostral antibody is vital for the protection of puppies during the first weeks of life, interference from this antibody can make a CDV vaccination program for puppies difficult to design. Newborn pups, given the opportunity to ingest colostrum, will acquire an initial CDV serum neutralizing antibody (SN) titre of up to 77 per cent of the serum titre of the dam (Greene and Appel, 2006). If the titre of passively acquired SN CDV antibodies in the pup is too high, these can interfere with active immunization, whereas if the titre is too low, the pup could be susceptible to CDV infection. In order to overcome this very practical issue, a range of alternative approaches has been investigated.",

Intranasal administration of CAV-2 to pups in the face of CAV maternally derived antibodies is known to engender a good antibody response (Appel et al., 1975). For this reason the potential of CAV-2 vectored CDV vaccines in puppies born to CDV and CAV-2 vaccinated dams was investigated (Fischer et al., 2002). Two experimental replication-competent canine adenovirus type 2 (CAV-2)-based vaccines expressing CDV haemagglutinin (HA) and fusion (F) glycoproteins (vCA13 and vCA17, respectively), were tested in pups with maternally derived antibodies to CDV and CAV-2. CDV neutralizing antibodies were induced, and solid protective immunity against intracerebral challenge with virulent CDV was present, in all subcutaneously vaccinated pups, despite the presence of pre-existing systemic immunity to the CAV-2 vector. This approach may be an efficient strategy to overcome passively acquired immunity to CDV and CAV-2 in pups. However, when the same constructs were administered intranasally to pups with pre-existing systemic immunity to CAV-2, anti-CAV-2 vector interference was shown, suggesting limitations for the practical use of such recombinant viruses for intranasal vaccination in the face of maternally derived immunity.",

We have demonstrated that vaccination of SPF puppies with a lipid-formulated DNA plasmid vaccine, encoding HA and F CDV membrane glycoproteins, protects against a severe CDV virus challenge (Fischer et al., 2003). Researchers in Denmark subsequently confirmed the potential of CDV DNA vaccination, using plasmid DNA encoding the CDV HA and nucleoprotein antigens to protect against a lethal CDV challenge (Dahl et al., 2004). The protective efficacy of experimental CDV DNA vaccines in pups with CDV maternally derived antibodies has been demonstrated by the University of Wisconsin and Mayo Clinic (Reed et al., 2003) and the Institute of Virology and Immunoprophylaxis, Swiss Federal Veterinary Office (Griot et al., 2004).",
