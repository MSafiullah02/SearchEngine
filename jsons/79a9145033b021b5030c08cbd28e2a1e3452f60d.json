Lee et al. compared the three coronavirus outbreaks. 1 The already available data suggested that the 2019-nCoV may be less pathogenic than the MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV. However, the rapidly increasing number of COVID-19 cases suggests that this virus might transmit more effectively among humans compared to prior strains of coronavirus and that mild illness might be quite common in infected individuals. These features confer a high pandemic potential of COVID-19.",

However, coronaviruses can cause diarrhea and be found in the feces. Hormati et al. reported patients with COVID-19 exhibited various gastrointestinal symptoms, including epigastric pain, constipation, diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, muscle pain, and melena in Iran. 2 They hypothesized that COVID-19 has a wide spectra of clinical symptoms, and unusual gastrointestinal symptoms may be present. Ma el al. found that near 30% patients with recovery of COVID-19 had viral shedding in their stool but no viral shedding in respiratory specimens, and 75% of these patients were children. 3 These findings indicate that gastrointestinal symptoms were not uncommon and children had longer fecal viral shedding than adults.",

Chen et al. reported the preventive strategies in hospitals for managing the COVID-19 pandemic in Taiwan. 4 As this pandemic spreads, access to personal protective equipment (PPE) for health workers is a key concern. The hospitals should set up a core team, which includes the hospital managers, infection control team members, infectious disease experts, and specialists representing the intensive care unit and accident and emergency departments. Yen et al. suggested interruption of COVID-19 transmission by implementing enhanced traffic control bundling, based on the 2003 SARS outbreak in Taiwan. 5 The successful prevention of the COVID-19 spread could be ensured by protecting the healthcare workers (HCWs) and patients from fomite, contact, and droplet transmissions within hospitals. Such measures could ensure that the viral transmissions are disrupted both within the hospitals and between the hospitals and the community, which could essentially contain and control the communityhospital-community transmission cycle.",

There have been confirmed COVID-19 cases among travelers to Wuhan and individuals on the cruise ships. Furthermore, several countries, including Singapore, Japan, Thailand, and South Korea, have identified clusters of locally transmitted cases. Many countries have instituted temporary restrictions on travel to China. However, an increasing number of cases with or without travel history to China were confirmed daily. Lau et al. analyzed all the available data of confirmed cases of COVID-19 from January 20, 2020 until February 18, 2020 worldwide. 6 A significantly lower proportion of COVID-19 cases without travel history to China were reported in countries with lower Healthcare Access and Quality Index (HAQ-Index). The data indicated that the countries with lower HAQ-index might have under-reported COVID-19 cases, which could lead to new local epicenters of the disease.",

The reporting criteria of COVID-19 in Taiwan included clinical criteria, epidemiologic criteria, and laboratory criteria. With the evolving reporting criteria, the designated hospitals could maintain high quality of medical care under an optimal loading and work efficiently to identify the potential cases of COVID-19. Furthermore, the officials integrated Taiwan's national health insurance database with its immigration and customs database. This enabled the government, hospitals, clinics and pharmacies to track the 14-day travel histories for each patient. 8 The COVID-19 pandemic outbreak still continues to pose challenges. The presence of asymptomatic or mild 2019-nCoV infections facilitates rapid spreading of the virus, and the preventive efficacy of present efforts for containment should be continuously evaluated. Although clinical trials for new treatments are underway, development of effective vaccines and antiviral agents against this virus is urgently needed.",
