Eight patients had a history of living in Wuhan, 5 patients had history of contact with proven COVID-19 cases, and 4 patients had no known contact with any COVID-19 patient. Ten of the 17 patients had no significant medical history. The remaining 7 patients had a history of the following comorbidities: hypertension (n=2), chronic gastritis (n=2), rheumatic heart disease (n=1) and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (n=2). RT-PCR of all the patient's sputum was positive for the novel coronavirus nucleic acid. All the 17 patients had lymphopenia on presentation. The white blood cell di\ufb00erential count showed that 8 patients had increased neutrophils, 15 patients had decreased eosinophils and 16 patients had decreased lymphocytes.

The distribution of abnormalities was in the subpleural lung regions in 12 patients, bilateral in 14 and unilateral in 3 of 17 patients. Both upper and lower lobes were involved in 15 patients, only upper lobe was involved in 2 patients. Air bronchogram was identified in 3 patients. None of the patients had tree-in-bud pattern, cavitation or pleural effusion. Follow-up HRCT scan were performed in 5 patients. In three of the 5 that showed markedly decreased consolidation, fibrotic changes developed (The time intervals between the initial HRCT and follow-up was ranged between 6 and 11 days), while the other 2 patients showed mild progression with increased extent and density of opacities (The time intervals between the initial HRCT and follow-up was ranged between 2 and 3 days).
