However, animal-strain Cv can cause extensive epidemics of lower respiratory tract diseases in livestock and poultry. Current evidence suggests that the SARS-associated Cv is a previously unknown Cv strain, probably originating in nonhuman hosts, which has somehow acquired the capacity to infect human beings. Airborne transmission by both large droplets and droplet nuclei appears to allow this Cv to reach the alveoli, leading to a high incidence of pneumonia.",

            "text": "Angioedema, an uncommon and potentially fatal adverse reaction to treatment with angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor drugs, is thought to be due to increased levels of bradykinin present when the kininase activity of ACE is inhibited. However, it is unclear why fewer than 1% of those treated with ACE inhibitor drugs manifest angioedema, sometimes only after weeks to months of treatment. Therefore, it has not been feasible to identify individuals at increased risk for ACE inhibitor\u2013induced angioedema. It appears that another enzyme, aminopeptidase P, assumes a major role in catabolizing bradykinin and its active metabolite, des-Arg9-bradykinin, when ACE is inhibited. This study assessed mean plasma levels of aminopeptidase P activity in 39 hypertensive individuals with previously documented ACE inhibitor\u2013induced angioedema. These levels (16 nmol/mL/min) were significantly lower than the plasma levels in 39 age-/sex-matched hypertensive individuals with no previous reactions to ACE inhibitor treatment (23 nmol/mL/min) and the levels in 116 normal untreated controls (22 nmol/mL/min; P = .001). In contrast, there were no significant differences in the mean plasma levels of carboxypeptidase N, a minor catabolizer of bradykinin, in the 3 study groups. However, the authors found no correlation between plasma levels of aminopeptidase P and the time between the previous initiation of ACE inhibitor therapy and onset of angioedema episodes in individual patients. Thus, a predictor of angioedema reactivity to ACE inhibitor therapy might have been identified. However, it is still unclear why there is a variable time of onset of such angioedema and why it occurs only episodically when ACE inhibitor drugs are taken daily.",

            "text": "Investigating lymphocyte responses to allergens has been hindered by the low frequency of circulating allergen-specific lymphocytes. It has generally been assumed that allergens induce TH2 responses because most cultured allergen-specific clones have a TH2 phenotype. However, analysis of allergen-specific lymphocytes in nonallergic individuals has not been extensively examined. In the current paper, the investigators reported a new approach using carboxyfluorescein succinimidyl ester (CSFE) to detect allergen-specific lymphocytes by flow cytometry. The CSFE dye is equally distributed into dividing cells so that its level is a specific indication of the number of replication cycles that a cell has undergone. Accordingly, the investigators examined CSFE-low cells after culture in medium supplemented with peanut antigen. Comparison of (1) peanut-allergic individuals, (2) non\u2013peanut-allergic individuals, and (3) individuals who had outgrown peanut allergy revealed interesting findings. Notably, T cells of peanut-allergic donors showed a TH2 polarization; in contrast, T cells of individuals who had outgrown their allergies and T cells of nonallergic individuals showed TH1 cytokine responses to peanut antigen. Similar results were seen in lymphocytes of individuals with egg allergy when the lymphocytes were cultured with ovalbumin. These results suggest that food antigens (in particular, peanut antigen) do not intrinsically induce TH2 skewing but that the type of response depends on the donor's allergic status. The finding that lymphocytes of individuals who outgrow peanut allergy do not have a TH2 skewing suggests that shifting of a TH2 response to a TH1 response underlies clinical tolerance to orally administered allergens. The application of this novel approach to examine antigen-specific T cells is likely to be informative in developing better strategies for immunotherapy.",

            "text": "It has been suggested that in utero exposure to maternal smoking and early onset of asthma in infancy are independently associated with subsequent chronic decreases in lung function in childhood. This study compared the effects of these factors, present individually and in combination, within a population of 5933 participants in a Children's Health Study. As predicted, children without asthma who had previously been exposed in utero to maternal smoking showed decreased FEV1/forced vital capacity (FVC) ratios and FEF25-75. Among children without prior in utero exposure to maternal smoking, those with early-onset asthma had larger decreases in FEV1, FEV1/FVC, and FEF25-75 than those with later-onset asthma. However, the largest decreases in pulmonary function were seen in children with both in utero tobacco smoking exposure and early-onset asthma (FEV1/FVC decreased approximately 9%; FEF25-75 decreased approximately 28%). Somewhat surprisingly, there was no significant effect of postnatal environmental tobacco smoke exposure alone on childhood lung function. These findings suggest a possible additive effect of in utero tobacco exposure and early-onset asthma on childhood lung function, providing further evidence of the deleterious effects of maternal smoking during pregnancy. Such smoking during pregnancy might be particularly harmful in situations in which the child to be born is at increased risk for expression of asthma.",

            "text": "Although inhaled corticosteroids (ICSs) are recommended as first-line therapy for moderate to persistent asthma, there is still debate about the role and long-term effects of ICSs in the treatment of mild persistent asthma. This multi-institutional study was a randomized, double-blind trial carried out in 7241 subjects (aged 5 to 66 years) in 32 countries who had mild persistent asthma of less than 2 years' duration and no previous regular treatment with ICSs. A comparison was made of either (a) inhaled budesonide (400 \u03bcg/day in adults, 200 \u03bcg/day in children) or (b) placebo in addition to the preexistent asthma therapy. After the end of the study 3 years later, there had been a significantly lower frequency of acute asthma exacerbations in those receiving the budesonide treatment (3.3%) than in those treated with placebo (5.5%; P < .0001). There was also less prn (as-needed) use of systemic corticosteroids in the budesonide-treated subjects. The pre-bronchodilator FEV1 was modestly better in the budesonide-treated individuals than in the placebo-treated individuals (mean, +2.24% at 1 year and +1.71% at 3 years; P < .001); the post-bronchodilator FEV1 was also better in the budesonide-treated subjects. These effects of budesonide treatment were independent of the baseline lung function as well as of the types of baseline medication. In children less than 11 years old, the growth rate after 3 years was reduced by a mean of 1.34 cm in those treated with budesonide, most of this reduction (0.58 cm) occurring during the first year. These findings suggest that relatively early intervention with ICSs decreases the risk of acute asthma flares and the need for systemic steroid use and modestly improves airflow function. It remains to be seen whether the ICS-associated reduction in growth velocity is persistent or progressive.",

J Clin Invest 2002;110:1823-30. IgG Fc receptors (R) and complement are known to be critical effectors in acute inflammatory responses to immune complexes (ICs), but the exact interaction between these 2 key components has not been established. In the present study, the investigators used a mouse model of acute pulmonary IC-mediated hypersensitivity to determine the interaction between these 2 pathways. They first demonstrated that Fc\u03b3RIII and C5aR knockout animals had diminished inflammatory responses to ICs. They subsequently localized the expression of Fc\u03b3RIII and C5aR to alveolar macrophages and showed that administration of recombinant C5a powerfully modulated the expression of the Fc\u03b3R. In particular, C5a caused upregulation of Fc\u03b3RIII and downregulation of the inhibitory receptor Fc\u03b3RII. Furthermore, they demonstrated that the expression of C5a during the acute inflammatory response kinetically correlated with Fc\u03b3R modulation. These results establish that the C5a anaphylatoxin is a major regulator of Fc\u03b3R-mediated responses in the lungs.\u2022\nAndonegui et al. Endothelium-derived Toll-like receptor-4 is the key molecule in LPS-induced neutrophil sequestration into lungs. J Clin Invest 2003;111:1011-20. The Toll-like receptor-4 (TLR4) is a critical molecule in mediating LPS-induced neutrophil responses; however, the exact mechanism involved has not been defined. In this study, the investigators aimed to determine whether TLR4 expression on neutrophils or on resident lung cells was critical for neutrophil recruitment. Through use of adoptive bone marrow transfer, chimeric mice expressing TLR4 either in leukocytes or in lung resident cells (endothelial cells) were examined for the contribution of TLR4 expression on these particular cells. Surprisingly, systemic LPS induced a dramatic increase in lung neutrophilia in mice lacking TLR4 selectively on leukocytes. In contrast, mice lacking TLR4 on lung resident cells (endothelium) showed a marked reduction in neutrophil sequestration into the lungs. These findings challenge the conventional view that LPS directly activates neutrophils to trap in the lungs; the results suggest instead that LPS effects involve a far more complicated pathway involving TLR4 signaling in endothelial cells.\n",
