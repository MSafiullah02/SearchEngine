            "text": "Plasmodium falciparum merozoite surface protein-3 (PfMSP-3) is a protein mainly expressed at the schizont stage of the parasite. This protein is initially synthesized as a 62 kDa precursor and then is subsequently processed into a mature protein with an approximate size of 44\u201348 kDa via removal of the N-terminal region in the parasitophorous vacuole [1, 2]. PfMSP-3 plays critical roles in erythrocyte binding of the parasite and protecting the parasite against toxic haem that is inevitably produced by haemoglobin hydrolysis [3]. It is also reported that PfMSP-3 is a target of host immune responses. PfMSP-3 induced naturally acquired immunity by producing antibodies that mediate antibody-dependent cellular inhibition of the parasite [3]. Immunization of PfMSP-3 induced protective immunity in animal models [4, 5]. Moreover, anti-PfMSP-3 antibodies suppressed the growth of P. falciparum in vitro in the presence of blood monocytes [2, 6]. Vaccines formulated with PfMSP-3 alone or in combination with other vaccine candidate antigens have been designed and their effectiveness in inducing production of cytophilic antibodies that could inhibit P. falciparum erythrocytic growth has been evaluated [7, 8]. GMZ2, the vaccine formulated with a chimeric antigen constructed with the C-terminal region of PfMSP-3 and the N-terminal region of glutamate rich protein (GLURP), was well tolerated and immunogenic, and elicited high levels of functional antibodies suppressing multiplication of the parasite [9\u201312]. The essential biological functions of PfMSP-3 during parasite survival and the accumulated evidence that specific antibodies for PfMSP-3 are effective in parasite killing and protection against clinical malaria suggest that this protein as a promising vaccine candidate antigen.",

            "text": "Genetic polymorphisms in vaccine candidate antigens of P. falciparum are great hurdles to develop effective vaccines since they could generate a variant-specific immune response that is less effective against parasites with other genetic variants. Like other vaccine candidate antigens, the genetic diversity of pfmsp-3 was also reported in natural parasite populations [13\u201316]. The pfmsp-3 consists of 3 separated regions: the N-terminal region containing four alanine heptad repeats (AHR) having the AXXXAXXX motif, the glutamate rich domain, and the C-terminal region containing a leucine zipper motif [17\u201320]. The gene is classified into 2 different alleles, 3D7 and K1, based on the difference in size of the AHR at the N-terminal region [17]. It has been proposed that the N-terminal region was polymorphic, whereas the C-terminal region was relatively well conserved in P. falciparum populations in several countries including Iran [14], Thailand [13, 15], Cameroon, Republic of Congo, Burkina Faso, Ghana, and Senegal [16]. In-depth understanding of the population genetic structure of pfmsp-3 in the natural P. falciparum population is important not only for evaluating the genetic nature of the vaccine candidate antigen, but also for advancing effective vaccine development.",

Ex Taq DNA polymerase (Takara, Otsu, Japan) with proof- reading activity was used in all PCR amplification steps to minimize the nucleotide mis-incorporation. PCR products were resolved on a 1.2% agarose gel, and were visualized under ultraviolet (UV). Each PCR product was purified from the gel, and cloned into the T&A vector (Real Biotech Corporation, Banqiao City, Taiwan). Ligation mixture was transformed into Escherichia coli DH5\u03b1 competent cells, and positive clones with appropriate insert were selected by colony PCR. The nucleotide sequence of cloned insert was analysed by automatic DNA sequencing with M13 forward and M13 reverse primers. Plasmids from at least two independent clones from each transformation mixture were sequenced in both directions to verify the sequence accuracy.

The Tajima\u2019s D values were also calculated on sliding window plot of 10 bases with a step size 5 bp to estimate the natural selection parameter across the gene.",

Sequence alignment analysis of the sequences suggested that they were classified into 2 allelic types, 3D7 type (n = 43) and K1 type (n = 29). For the 3D7 allelic types, 164 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were identified at 87 polymorphic sites, in which 122 SNPs were non-synonymous mutations, resulting in amino acid substitutions at 49 positions. Four amino acid positions showed tri-morphic changes (F12L/S, D142E/G, Y192C/H, and D278E/M) and the others were di-morphic amino acid changes. The most predominant amino acid substitutions identified in Myanmar pfmsp-3 were L68S and D278E/M, which accounted for 90.7% and 58.1% in frequency, respectively. The other amino acid changes occurred at very low proportions. Amino acid changes at 25 positions (G71S, E98G, T117A, D142E/G, A163V, Y192C/H, K236E, E245G, E249G, E253K, S261T, D263E, E267V, E274R, E275K, E276K, N277K, D278M, K281E, K285T, N311D, K331E, G332E, Q335R, and V344I) were novel ones that have not been reported previously. The glutamate rich domain of Myanmar pfmsp-3 was varied because of different repeat numbers of glutamate residues, ranging from 4 to 8 repeats. Deletions of E271 and/or E272 were identified in 12 distinct haplotypes and insertion of 2 additional glutamates was found in haplotype 26. Based on these polymorphic patterns, the 3D7 allelic types of Myanmar pfmsp-3 were further classified into 31 distinct haplotypes, in which haplotype 9 had the highest prevalence (23.3%) (Fig. 1). In the K1 allelic types, a total of 25 distinct haplotypes were identified. Haplotype 21 was the most prevalent, accounting for 17.2%. Sequence analysis revealed that there were 944 SNPs at 117 polymorphic sites, among which 576 SNPs were non-synonymous ones leading to amino acid substitutions at 75 positions. Sixty-nine di-morphic and 6 tri-morphic (P72A/S, T81C/S, K110N/Q, Q114D/E, K188Q/R, A352T/V) amino acid changes were found. High frequency of a glutamate (E) insertion at position 79 was identified at AHR domains. Insertions of 13 amino acids (ETEEEELEEKNEE) and 1\u20133 glutamate (E) were also detected at positions 280 and 298 in the glutamate rich domain, respectively. Amino acid deletions at 6 positions (G169, E301, N302, E303, K304, and K305) were also found in the K1 allelic types of Myanmar pfmsp-3 (Fig. 2).",

Given the partial sequence information of pfmsp-3 from other global populations, analysis focused on the 3 regions corresponding to AHR, the glutamate rich domain and the leucine zipper domain. For 3D7 allelic types, most amino acid polymorphisms were accumulated at glutamate rich domains, but the frequencies were different by country (Fig. 3). The deletion of E272 (E272-) and an amino acid change (D280E) were found in all analysed populations. Insertions of 1 to 3 glutamate residues at the position of 272 (E272 + , E272 ++, and E272 +++) were more prevalent in African pfmsp-3 than in Asian pfmsp-3. The AHR and leucine zipper domains were relatively well conserved in 3D7 allelic types of global pfmsp-3. Amino acid changes at 9 positions were identified in AHR domains of global pfmsp-3, most of them only in Myanmar pfmsp-3. Only 2 amino acid changes (A103S and K164E) were found in Thailand and Kenya pfmsp-3. The five amino acid substitutions (N311D, K331E, G332E, Q335R, and V344I) in the leucine zipper domain were detected only in Myanmar pfmsp-3. Polymorphic patterns of amino acid changes were more diverse and greater in global K1 allelic types (Fig. 4). Most amino acid changes detected at AHR domains were shared by the global pfmsp-3 population with high frequencies. Only five amino acid substitutions, G75I, T81C, S98F, T165A, and K188R, were uniquely identified in Myanmar pfmsp-3. Although the overall patterns of amino acid polymorphisms identified in global pfmsp-3 were similar, the frequencies of A112S, Q114E, Q117E, S119A, D121E, E123V, K124M, and E130K were relatively higher in Asian pfmsp-3 than in African pfmsp-3. The glutamate rich domain also showed polymorphic patterns in global pfmsp-3. Insertions of glutamate (E) at position 79, 13 amino acids (ETEEEELEEKNEE) at position 280, and glutamate (E) at the position 298 were found in pfmsp-3 from Thailand, Kenya, and Nigeria. Deletion of glutamate (E) at position 297 was also identified in pfmsp-3 from Kenya and Nigeria. Meanwhile, the leucine zipper domain was well-conserved in global pfmsp-3. Only 5 minor amino acid changes (N335S, N336S, T350A, A352T, and A352V) were uniquely identified in Myanmar pfmsp-3. Polymorphic patterns of the B-cell epitopes of 3D7 allelic types of global pfmsp-3 were analysed. The amino acid residues constructing the B-cell epitopes were tightly conserved in global pfmsp-3 allelic types (Fig. 5). However, di-morphic and tri-morphic amino acid changes at the corresponding residues were detected in Myanmar pfmsp-3.",

In contrast, the highest values of \u03c0 were detected at the glutamate rich domain for the 3D7 type. The leucine zipper domains showed low values of \u03c0 in both allelic types of Myanmar pfmsp-3 (Fig. 6a).

The value of Tajima\u2019s D for the 3D7 allelic types was negative (\u2212 2.692, P < 0.001), suggesting that 3D7 allelic types of Myanmar pfmsp-3 were under purifying selection. Meanwhile, the value was positive for the K1 allelic type (0.373, P > 0.1), implying that the K1 type was under balancing selection (Table 1). The sliding window plot analysis of Tajima\u2019s D across Myanmar pfmsp-3 also indicated that the values were negative across the entire gene for the 3D7 allelic types, whereas positive values of Tajima\u2019s D were predicted at AHR domains and the leucine rich region of K1 allelic types (Fig. 6b).",

The dN\u2013dS value was negative for all countries analysed, indicating that negative natural selection may occur in global pfmsp-3. However, the value of Tajima\u2019s D was different by country: negative for Myanmar and Kenya, but positive for Nigeria and Thailand. The values of Fu and Li\u2019s D and F for each country also showed a similar trend of negative or positive values. Meanwhile, more complex patterns of natural selection were predicted in K1 allelic types (Table 1). The values of nucleotide diversity (\u03c0) of K1 allelic types were greater than those of 3D7 allelic types in all countries analysed. The values ranged from 0.0230 to 0.0420. The value of dN\u2013dS was positive in Kenya, but in other countries including Myanmar, Nigeria, and Thailand was negative.

In this study, genetic diversity and natural selection of Myanmar pfmsp-3 were analysed. Two allelic types of pfmsp-3, 3D7 and K1, were identified in Myanmar pfmsp-3 with the predominance of the 3D7 allelic type (59.7%). This is consistent with other reports that 3D7 allelic types are more prevalent in Peru [27], East Republic of Congo and Burkina Faso [16], and the Thailand-Laos border [15]. Meanwhile, the recombinant allelic type, which was reported in pfmsp-3 from Iran and Africa countries with a very low frequency [14, 16], was not identified in Myanmar pfmsp-3. The lack of a recombinant allelic type may result from the large sequence difference between the two dimorphic alleles, which impedes recombination during meiosis. Otherwise, the sequence dimorphism among pfmsp-3 may be strictly maintained in the population by balancing selection [28, 29]. However, recombination between and among the same allelic type of Myanmar pfmsp-3 is likely to occur, considering the Rm value in each allelic type. Particularly, the K1 allelic type of Myanmar pfmsp-3 revealed many recombination events, indicating that active intragenic recombination is occurring in the population.",

The major amino acid substitutions and insertions/deletions found in both allelic types of Myanmar pfmsp-3 were shared by global pfmsp-3, but their frequencies differed by geographical origin. Interestingly, novel amino acid changes that were not reported previously for either allelic type of Myanmar pfmsp-3, which renders genetic diversity of Myanmar pfmsp-3 more complex; 31 and 25 haplotypes for the 3D7 and K1 allelic types, respectively. Although incidence of malaria has been remarkably decreased in Myanmar in recent years [30], it seems likely that much genetic diversity is still maintained in Myanmar P. falciparum population. Regardless of the declining population in recent years, substantial levels of genetic heterogeneities in pfmsp-1, pfmsp-2, pfama-1, and pfcsp have been reported in the Myanmar P. falciparum population [31\u201334]. The reason for this is not clearly demonstrated yet and therefore further study to understand this phenomenon would be necessary.",

Major amino acid changes and insertions/deletions found in both 3D7 and K1 allelic types were observed at the AHR and glutamate rich domains. The repeats of the AXXAXXX motif, which plays a role in maintaining and forming an \u03b1-helical secondary structure of PfMSP-3 [19], were highly conserved in global pfmsp-3 regardless of diversity within and flanking the ARH. The B-cell epitopes of 3D7 allelic types were also well conserved in the global pfmsp-3 population. The N-terminal region of pfmsp-3 including the B-cell epitopes is a target of naturally acquired immunity. In particular, the regions corresponding to amino acids 21 to 238 not only is an important immunogen to produce a protective immune response but also is involved in the interaction with PfMSP-1 [35]. The prevalence of opsonizing antibodies against the N-terminal region rather than the C-terminal region of pfmsp-3 also suggests a critical role of the N-terminal region as a target of opsonizing antibodies. Therefore, the N-terminal region of pfmsp-3 may represent an attractive candidate for formulation of a PfMSP-3-based vaccine. Meanwhile, the leucine zipper domain was relatively well conserved in global pfmsp-3. The limited polymorphic pattern of the C-terminal region, especially in the leucine zipper domain, may result from its crucial function in the formation of protein oligomerization [3, 36]. Moreover, the C-terminal region of pfmsp-3 plays an essential function in the invasion process of merozoite by mediating specific binding with erythrocytes [37].",

Meanwhile, the values of Tajima\u2019s D and Fu and Li\u2019s D and F revealed complicated patterns that were different by country. These suggest that a complicated natural selection may act on 3D7 allelic types of the global pfmsp-3, in which either positive selection or purifying selection might have occurred in the population, depending on the geographical origin. As expected, overall nucleotide diversity in K1 allelic types was greater than that in 3D7 allelic types in the global isolates. The positive values of Tajima\u2019s D indicated that K1 allelic types of global pfmsp-3 evolved under balancing selection. Amino acid substitutions, insertion or deletions may be the main pressure to generate genetic diversity of the allelic types. High recombination parameters also support the notion that recombination may be one of a force contributing to generate genetic diversity of K1 allelic types of global pfmsp-3.",

Overall patterns of nucleotide diversity and distributions of amino acid changes and insertions/deletions found in Myanmar pfmsp-3 were similar to those from global pfmsp-3, even though minute regional differences were also identified between and among each population. Complicated patterns of natural selection and recombination events were predicted in the global pfmsp-3, which may act as major driving forces to maintain and generate genetic diversity of the global pfmsp-3 population. These results suggest that the functional consequences of the polymorphism should be considered for development of a vaccine based on PfMSP-3. This study provides in-depth insight into the genetic nature and population structure of global pfmsp-3. Considering that rather few global pfmsp-3 sequences were currently available, further examination of the genetic diversity and evolutionary aspect of pfmsp-3 with more global pfmsp-3 sequences would be necessary to better understand the genetic make-up of pfmsp-3 in the natural P. falciparum population.\n",
