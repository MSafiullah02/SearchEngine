Infection results in the development of coronavirus disease of 2019 (COVID-19) (WHO 2020). EMS providers are potentially exposed to SARS-CoV-2 while providing patient care during the COVID-19 pandemic, yet data concerning Emergency Medical Services (EMS) providers and COVID19 is scarce. A search of NCBI using the terms \u201cEMS AND COVID-19\u201d returned no articles. Response to COVID-19 in the pre-hospital setting is currently guided by the Interim Guidance for Emergency Medical Services (EMS) Systems and 911 Public Safety Answering Points (PSAPs) for COVID-19 in the United States. (CDC 2020). This study aimed to investigate individual EMS provider competency and resource accessibility amid COVID-19 in the United States using a self-report survey questionnaire. Limitations for this study include a limited sample size and the consideration that no current model for this type of questioning exists.",

The survey also featured a COVID-19 opinions section. Between April 1, 2020 and April 16, 2020 the survey was randomly distributed to various active Emergency Medical Services (EMS) personnel in all 50 U.S. states including the District of Columbia (n=192) by way of multi-organizational distribution and promotion, press release, and social media distribution. An ethics approval was obtained and certified by the Institutional Review Board. The public or participants of this study were not involved in the design, conduct, reporting, or dissemination plans of research. Based on available U.S. Census data for EMS professionals, we approximate a 95% confidence interval with a marginal error of \u00b1 0.07 to reflect representation of practicing providers in the United States.",
