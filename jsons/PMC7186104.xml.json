Given the high risk of contamination of front-line emergency medicine personnel, the use of appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) is critical. There are generally two approaches to training exercises - focused training with periodic refresher courses or just-in-time training. The cost burden of preparing for high-risk, low-frequency events such as CBRN incidents is a significant challenge since it places a financial and personnel/time burden on hospitals [1-3]. Moreover, training exercises tend to focus on donning and doffing PPE, and not procedural competence while in PPE. ",

While there is also conflicting evidence regarding the impact of ultrasound on intravenous (IV) cannulation, there are no studies that address its use with PPE [13-14]. Our study is the first to examine these parameters while using both VL for intubation and ultrasound for intravenous cannulation.",

Therefore, it is difficult to compare the intubation times in this study with other studies where the start time was post-preparation or insertion of the laryngoscope. However, we felt strongly that this should be included since preparing equipment requires manual dexterity that is influenced by PPE, and in an emergency situation, this preparation will likely be done while donned. Unfortunately, there is limited and somewhat conflicting literature that addresses the question regarding the appropriate time needed to successfully complete airway tasks by otherwise procedurally competent personnel while wearing PPE [4-8]. In our study, the median times for successful intubation with DL and VL (including preparation for intubation), regardless of the use of PPE, were 67 seconds and 89 seconds, respectively. We feel that a time under one and half minutes for preparation and successful endotracheal intubation is an acceptable timeframe.",

Castle et al. found an increase in the mean completion time of IV cannulation when wearing PPE Level C (40.8 sec vs. 129.6 sec) [6]. MacDonald et al. found a statistically significant increase in completion time for IV cannulation when wearing PPE (158 sec vs. 220 sec, P < 0.01) [7].

Second, we did not track the time taken for each individual stage of the procedure; that is, specific time for preparation, time from the insertion of the laryngoscope to passing the ETT and lung inflation. This would have been beneficial in making a direct comparison of our results to existing literature. Finally, while our participant group of trainees completed the procedures in what we consider an appropriate time frame, future studies should include a group of experienced clinicians so that a \u201cgold standard\u201d can be introduced for comparison.",
