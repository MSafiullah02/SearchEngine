            "text": "Coronaviruses (CoVs) belong to the family Coronaviridae, order Nidovirales. This subfamily is currently divided into 4 groups based on phylogenic relationship (International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses and King, 2012). Groups alpha and beta consist of mammalian CoVs, whereas gamma and delta viruses infect birds and marine mammals (Woo et al., 2010). Human CoVs for years were considered relatively harmless common cold viruses outside on the mainstream research on viral pathogens. That has changed after the outbreak of the SARS-CoV (Drosten et al., 2003, Ksiazek et al., 2003, Peiris et al., 2003) which brought CoVs to the limelight. An intense of CoVs research resulted better understanding of their pathogenesis and biology. Furthermore, two novel human CoVs were discovered: human coronavirus NL63 (van der Hoek et al., 2004) and human coronavirus HKU1 (Pyrc et al., 2010, Woo et al., 2005). Their detailed investigations revealed great variability of coronaviral species infecting animals and the potential threat of zoonotic transmission to human community. Very recently this viral family again drew attention, as another animal coronavirus \u2013 Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) \u2013 crossed the species border, proving that the emergence of SARS-CoV was not an isolated case (Centers for Disease and Prevention, 2013, Zaki et al., 2012).",

            "text": "Intensified research on coronaviruses and development of a novel research tool based on a coronaviral backbone (e.g., vectors, vaccines) requires a method for safe storage and shipment of infectious material. Coronavirus particles are relatively stable, but previous reports show that this stability is insufficient for storage and transport of coronavirus-based vaccines, vectors and for the material exchange between laboratories (Lamarre and Talbot, 1989, Muller et al., 2008). Lyophilization is the method of choice for cost-effective stabilization of infectious material. It is a process, where a sample is frozen and subsequently the solvent is removed by sublimation (primary drying) and then by desorption (secondary drying) to the level that inhibits biological growth and chemical reactions (Jennings, 1999). To improve the stability of a sample during lyophilization and storage stabilizing substances, including lyoprotectants (Townsend and DeLuca, 1988) and bulking agents (Jennings, 1999), are added. There are numerous reports describing the freeze-drying of viruses, mainly for vaccine production (Amorij et al., 2008, Audouy et al., 2011, Bieganski et al., 1998, Burger et al., 2008, Croyle et al., 1998, de Jonge et al., 2007, Furuya et al., 2010, Geeraedts et al., 2010, Gupta et al., 2010, Kang et al., 2010, Lang et al., 2009, Levy and Fieldsteel, 1982, Yannarell et al., 2002). These methods differ in terms of process parameters and buffer content and stability of preparations ranging from 12 weeks at +4 \u00b0C (de Jonge et al., 2007) to one year at ambient temperature (Geeraedts et al., 2010, Levy and Fieldsteel, 1982). Precausta et al. developed a protocol that allowed storage of the Infectious Bronchitis Virus (IBV) for 12 months at +6 \u00b0C using 40 mg/ml mannitol as the lyoprotectant (Precausta et al., 1980). Roseto et al. lyophilized Bovine Enteric Coronavirus without addition of any stabilizing formulation for structural studies using electron microscopy (Roseto et al., 1982). Virus stability during storage was not tested. No studies on freeze-drying preservation of other coronaviruses, including human coronaviruses were previously reported.",

To this end LLC-MK2 cells (ATCC: CCL-7; Macaca mulatta kidney epithelial cell line) were used for in vitro culture of HCoV-NL63 (Schildgen et al., 2006). The cells were cultured on T25 flasks (TPP, Germany) at +37 \u00b0C with 5% CO2 in minimal essential medium (MEM), containing 2 parts of Hank's MEM and 1 part of Earle's MEM (Life Technologies, Poland) supplemented with 3% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (Life Technologies, Poland), penicillin (100 U/ml), and streptomycin (100 \u03bcg/ml) (H/E medium). HCoV-NL63 (Amsterdam I strain) stock was generated by infecting LLC-MK2 cells. Infected cells were lysed 6 days post-infection by two freeze\u2013thaw cycles. The virus-containing fluid was cleared by centrifugation, aliquoted and stored at \u221280 \u00b0C. A control from mock infected cells was prepared in the same manner as the virus stocks. Virus yield was assessed by virus titration on fully confluent LLC-MK2 cells, according to Reed and Muench formula (Reed and Muench, 1938). All formulations used during lyophilization are presented in Table 1\nand were prepared as 2\u00d7 concentrated solutions in distilled water. Five times concentrated HBS buffer was prepared in distilled water. All samples were sterilized by filtration. Samples were prepared as follows: formulations 1\u20137: 80 \u03bcl 5\u00d7 HBS, 20 \u03bcl sterile water, 200 \u03bcl 2\u00d7 concentrated stabilizing formulation, 100 \u03bcl HCoV-NL63 stock (TCID50\n = 1.4 million) in medium H/E 3% P/S; formulations 8\u201313: 100 \u03bcl sterile water, 200 \u03bcl of 2\u00d7 concentrated stabilizing formulation, 100 \u03bcl HCoV-NL63 stock (TCID50\n = 1.4 million) in medium H/E 3% P/S; HBS control: 80 \u03bcl 5\u00d7 HBS, 220 \u03bcl sterile water, 100 \u03bcl HCoV-NL63 stock (TCID50\n = 1.4 million) in medium H/E 3% P/S; PBS control: 300 \u03bcl 1\u00d7 PBS (NaCl 8.0 g/l, KCl 0.2 g/l, Na2HPO4 1.44 g/l, KH2PO4 0.24 g/l, pH 7.4), 100 \u03bcl HCoV-NL63 stock (TCID50\n = 1,4 million) in medium H/E 3% P/S:-H/E 3% P/S.

For sterilization, the box was disinfected with 70% ethanol and exposed to ultraviolet radiation. The gas exchange between the container and the lyophilizer was possible via the vent protected with a 0.1 \u03bcm air filter (Sartorius stedim, Germany). Before the lyophilization the container was pre-cooled at \u221220 \u00b0C. Process parameters were chosen based on literature data.

Second, the requirement for a bulking agent was confirmed, in line with observations made by Jennings (1999). Lack of a bulking agent (e.g., in sample Sucr0.5) resulted in excessive foaming during freeze-drying process, what rendered the storage of the sample impossible. Conversely, samples buffered with Sucr74.6, containing similar concentration of sucrose as samples buffered with Sucr0.5, produce during the freeze-drying a cake of good structural properties. This can be explained by the presence of gelatin.",

To prevent the cytotoxic effect of these formulations, the virus/mock medium was applied on cells for 2 h; following this time cells were washed and fresh medium was applied. Samples lyophilized with Sor2, Sor10 and Treh100 (Table 1) buffers showed lower TCID50 values, compared to reference samples, i.e., 1\u00d7 PBS and 1\u00d7 HBS (Fig. 1\n).

Sample storage at \u221220 \u00b0C or +4 \u00b0C for 56 days did not affect virion infectivity. When the preparation was stored at ambient temperature, the considerable virus titer decrease was observed during first weeks. These most likely resulted from hydrolysis reactions caused by residual water present in samples (Jennings, 1999). Further, a slight increase in the virus titer after 56 days of storage at +4 \u00b0C for both storage buffers was observed. Similar phenomenon was previously observed and it was suggested that virions aggregate during freeze-drying process what lowers their infectivity. Prolonged storage results in aggregate dissociation and restoration of the infectivity (Cowdery et al., 1976).",
