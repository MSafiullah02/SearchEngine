Molecular methods directly assay for the presence of the microorganism at the time the specimen is obtained, which is ideal for the acutely ill patient. Serologic methods assay for an antibody response to the microorganism, typically requiring at least a week of symptoms even for immunoglobulin M tests. Immune-compromised and immune-suppressed patients frequently will not mount an appropriate antibody response. Thus for serologic assays, evaluation of the patient early in the course of the disease or testing a patient with immune dysregulation will often yield false-negative results. Patients who have been treated with intravenous immunoglobulin in the preceding year will typically have immunoglobulin G present against a wide array of infectious agents that they have never seen, which can lead to false-positive serologic tests. Optimal serologic evaluation typically requires retesting at 4 to 6 weeks after infection (ie, convalescent titers) to demonstrate an increase in titer associated temporally with the recent illness, further delaying a definitive diagnosis.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "INTRODUCTION"}, {"text": "Molecular methods can also provide a more rapid diagnosis of etiology than is possible with culture, with results available within hours if the assay can be performed locally. Many infectious agents cannot be grown by standard culture methodologies (eg, Mycoplasma pneumoniae) or are fastidious (eg, Bordetella pertussis), leading to frequent false-negative results. Other organisms grow very slowly (eg, Mycobacterium tuberculosis) such that culture results are not available for weeks. Most clinical microbiology laboratories cannot afford to offer virology services owing to the high expense of performing tissue culture because it is labor intensive, requiring highly skilled laboratory personnel and the purchase of tissue culture cell lines every week that may not be used. Even when available, virus culture typically requires 3 to 10 days for results, depending on the particular virus. However, for the vast majority of bacterial pathogens culture still remains the gold standard of diagnosis, typically yielding a microbiological diagnosis in 1 to 3 days followed by antibiotic susceptibility results.

Each section is further divided between diagnostics most appropriate for normal hosts, then additional diagnostics pertinent to immunecompromised hosts. Thus, diagnostics for the normal host will usually also be relevant to immune-compromised hosts.

In contrast to conventional PCR, which simply amplifies a targeted DNA molecule, real-time PCR can detect, amplify, and quantify a targeted DNA molecule in real time. In real-time PCR, fluorescent dyes are used to label PCR products during thermal cycling. Real-time PCR instruments then measure the accumulation of fluorescent signal during the exponential phase of the reaction for rapid and precise quantitation of PCR products. Quantitation can yield absolute numbers of copies of a given sequence or a relative amount when standardized to a known amount of DNA. Clinically this is particularly useful, for example, in determining viral load from plasma or serum of an individual infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). 3 Fluorescence-based diagnostic realtime PCR assays are now available in-house as well as commercially (approved by the Food and Drug Administration [FDA]) for many human pathogens (reviewed in Ref. 1 ). By virtue of its ability to simultaneously detect and quantify in a sealed PCR plate with no post-PCR processing steps, real-time PCR lends itself to automation and rapid turnaround time while reducing human error. In addition, multiplex realtime PCR assays on the same automated instrument to simultaneously detect and screen for a variety of pathogens are currently under development and are expected in time to replace stand-alone assays for specific pathogens. 4 Despite these exciting possibilities, the cost of such multiplex instrumentation is a significant limitation for many smaller clinical laboratories.

However, if CSF cannot be obtained, many of these tests can also be performed on blood. For meningoencephalitis in the normal host, herpes simplex virus (HSV) 6 and enterovirus 7 testing have become routine tests on CSF in many centers.

Unfortunately, in the case of bacterial meningitis molecular techniques to identify the etiologic agent are currently lacking. In the absence of reliable CSF cultures (eg, antibiotic therapy before lumbar puncture), identification of suspected pathogens has traditionally depended on the use of assays such as the latex agglutination or related immunochromatographic membrane assays for the direct qualitative detection of antigens to common bacterial pathogens causing meningitis (eg, Haemophilus influenzae B, Neisseria meningitides, Group B Streptococcus, Escherichia coli, and Streptococcus pneumoniae). In the latex agglutination assay, for example, specific antibodies are bound to the surface of the latex particles on a slide. On addition of the specimen, visible agglutination occurs when the specimen containing any of these bacterial antigens reacts with its respective antibodycoated latex bead. As this assay is completely dependent on accumulation of polysaccharide antigen in the specimen, many false negatives can occur and sensitivity remains a critical issue. In addition, antigen in the sample can come from organism colonization of mucosal surfaces, leading to false-positive results. 8 For the immune-compromised category, a quantitative assay for Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) and cytomegalovirus (CMV) exists and is in extensive use. The quantitative assay for these pathogens and HIV are discussed in the Bloodstream and Systemic Infections section. For Cryptococcus neoformans, identification in CSF relies on antigen identification through latex agglutination assay or enzyme immunosorbent assays; however, as opposed to bacterial antigen testing, the cryptococcal antigen test has proved itself to be very accurate and reliable. 9, 10 For the other pathogens listed here, qualitative realtime PCR assays exist to identify these pathogens in CSF and blood.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 1325, "end": 1326, "text": "8", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}, {"start": 1871, "end": 1873, "text": "9,", "ref_id": "BIBREF8"}, {"start": 1874, "end": 1876, "text": "10", "ref_id": "BIBREF9"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 18, "end": 25, "text": "Table 1", "ref_id": "TABREF0"}], "section": "Molecular Diagnostics in Disease Emergencies"}, {"text": "The diagnostic tests in this section focus on the evaluation of pneumonia ( Table 2) . A variety of rapid influenza diagnostic tests (RIDTs) have been available for several years, providing a very useful tool in the emergency, urgent care, and outpatient settings for detection of influenza virus A and B. 11 The RIDTs are immunoassays that identify the presence of influenza A or B nucleoprotein antigens from clinical specimens in a qualitative fashion. These tests are popular in that they can provide a result within 15 minutes or less, and many such commercially available tests are approved for office/bedside use. Disadvantages of the test include suboptimal test sensitivity, resulting in false-negative results, especially in periods when influenza activity is high. In addition, although specificity is high, false-positive results may also occur when influenza activity, and therefore pretest probability, is low. 12 The H1N1 2009 pandemic strain was poorly detected by standard RIDT at the time, leading to development of reverse-transcription PCR technology to identify this strain. 13 The reference standards for laboratory confirmation of influenza virus infection are currently viral culture or real-time PCR. Rapid respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) antigen detection has become a standard diagnostic tool in the evaluation of children with bronchiolitis or pneumonia. 14 The development of PCR diagnostics for fastidious organisms such as Legionella pneumophilia 15 and B pertussis 16 should improve the ability to diagnose these pathogens. Real-time PCR technology to diagnose tuberculosis is relatively new, but may prove useful for achieving a rapid diagnosis for this slow-growing organism. 17 Acid fast bacillus culture will still need to be performed because of the growing problem of drug resistance in M tuberculosis. Also exciting is the development of new multiplex assays that evaluate for multiple respiratory pathogens rapidly and simultaneously from a single sample. 18 These multiplex platforms are designed for use in local clinical microbiology laboratories such that results can be available in hours, as discussed later. Table 2 lists the individual pathogens that are typically assayed by these multiplex platforms, but there is variation regarding how many and which organisms are tested depending on the particular platform. As illustrated in Table 2 , individual real-time PCR assays currently exist for each of the bacterial, viral, and fungal pathogens. In the case of influenza and RSV, the rapid antigen assays can be verified with real-time PCR. Given that influenza A/B and RSV may cause illness that is clinically indistinguishable, a real-time PCR panel test that includes both influenza A/B and RSV (Mayo Diagnostic Test: PROD) should be considered. As already mentioned, innovative PCR-based multiplex molecular diagnostic tests are currently under development that can screen multiple respiratory pathogens at once. For example, the eSensor instrument (GenMark Dx, Carlsbad, CA) can identify the following pathogens in its respiratory viral panel: Influenza A (generic), Influenza A (H1 Seasonal Subtype), Influenza An H1 Mexico strain, Influenza A (H3 Seasonal Subtype) Influenza B, Respiratory Syncytial Virus subtypes A and B, Parainfluenza viruses 1, 2, 3, and 4, Human Metapneumovirus, Rhinovirus, Adenoviruses B, C, and E, and Coronaviruses NL63, 229E, OC43, and HKU1.

In the setting of a sepsis-like illness or severe systemic illness likely to be due to an infectious etiology, bacteremia remains the most common and important cause. 33 Thus, blood cultures remain the gold standard in the evaluation of these patients. In addition to blood culture, molecular diagnostics can be useful in the evaluation of these patients depending on the clinical scenario. 34 HIV is included in this section because acute HIV infection (ie, acute retroviral syndrome) can present as an acute febrile illness with multiple manifestations. 35 There is real-time PCR testing available for multiple tick-borne illnesses, with Rocky Mountain spotted fever (Rickettsia rickettsii) being potentially fatal. 36 EBV, CMV, HSV, varicella zoster virus (VZV), adenovirus, and parvovirus are included in the immune-compromised section because these infections are typically self-limited in the normal host, but potentially fatal in the immune-compromised host. As shown in Table 5 , specific real-time PCR assays are available for many bloodstream pathogens unlikely to be detected via standard blood cultures. In the case of HIV, the real-time PCR reaction involves an initial reverse transcription step because HIV is a retrovirus containing a bipolar, plus-sense RNA genome. Because of the wellstudied relationship of HIV RNA copy number to the stage of HIV disease and efficacy of HIV therapy, many truly quantitative real-time RT-PCR assays exist for HIV, with analytical sensitivity commonly as low as 20 copies/mL. 37 In the United States ticks are a significant vector of infectious diseases, and rank second only to mosquitoes in disease transmission across the world. 38 Given the many different agents associated with tick-borne disease (eg, R rickettsia, Borrelia burgdorferi, Ehrlichia spp, and Babesia microti), commercial real-time PCR tickborne panels are currently available to differentially identify the causative agent. In most cases this is a qualitative assay, and results are reported as either negative or positive for the targeted organisms. In the case of Rocky Mountain spotted fever, real-time PCR in a skin biopsy can be more useful for detecting the etiologic agent than an acute blood sample, owing to the low numbers of rickettsiae circulating in the blood in the absence of advanced disease or fulminant infection. 39 In the immune-compromised category, the herpesviruses EBV and CMV are of significant concern in transplantation recipients. [40] [41] [42] Quantitative real-time PCR assays exist for both these pathogens, which can reliably detect between 2000 and 200 million copies per milliliter. It is important to recognize that there may be variation between results obtained from one laboratory and another laboratory. Clinically this can cause difficulty in interpreting whether a significant change in viral replication has occurred. A common example is when an EBV or CMV copy number is reported from one institution, after which the patient is transferred to another institution and a second quantitative PCR is performed. As these tests become more standardized over time, this should be less problematic. Qualitative real-time PCR assays are also available for herpesviruses HSV and VZV as well as adenovirus and parvovirus. 43, 44 ", "cite_spans": [{"start": 318, "end": 320, "text": "33", "ref_id": "BIBREF32"}, {"start": 542, "end": 544, "text": "34", "ref_id": "BIBREF33"}, {"start": 707, "end": 709, "text": "35", "ref_id": "BIBREF34"}, {"start": 869, "end": 871, "text": "36", "ref_id": "BIBREF35"}, {"start": 1678, "end": 1680, "text": "37", "ref_id": "BIBREF36"}, {"start": 1834, "end": 1836, "text": "38", "ref_id": "BIBREF37"}, {"start": 2504, "end": 2506, "text": "39", "ref_id": "BIBREF38"}, {"start": 2631, "end": 2635, "text": "[40]", "ref_id": "BIBREF39"}, {"start": 2636, "end": 2640, "text": "[41]", "ref_id": "BIBREF40"}, {"start": 2641, "end": 2645, "text": "[42]", "ref_id": "BIBREF41"}, {"start": 3428, "end": 3431, "text": "43,", "ref_id": "BIBREF42"}, {"start": 3432, "end": 3434, "text": "44", "ref_id": "BIBREF43"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 140, "end": 147, "text": "Table 5", "ref_id": "TABREF4"}, {"start": 1129, "end": 1136, "text": "Table 5", "ref_id": "TABREF4"}], "section": "BLOODSTREAM AND SYSTEMIC INFECTIONS Clinical Perspective and Molecular Diagnosis"}, {"text": "In the setting of infectious disease emergencies, rapid and accurate identification of the causative agent is critical to optimizing antimicrobial therapy in a timely manner. It is clearly evident that the age of molecular diagnostics is now upon us, with realtime PCR becoming the standard of diagnosis for many infectious disease emergencies in either monoplex or multiplex format. Other molecular techniques such as whole or partial genome sequencing, microarrays, broad-range PCR, restriction fragment length polymorphisms, and molecular typing are also being used. However, for most small clinical laboratories, implementation of these advanced molecular techniques is not feasible owing to the high cost of instrumentation and reagents. If these tests are not available in-house, samples can be sent to national reference laboratories (eg, Mayo Medical Laboratories and Quest Diagnostics) for real-time PCR assays that can be completed in 1 day. It is anticipated that over time commercial real-time PCR tests and instrumentation will become more standardized and affordable, allowing individual laboratories to conduct tests locally, thus further reducing turnaround time. Although real-time PCR has been proved to expand our diagnostic capability, it must be stressed that such molecular methodology constitutes only an additional tool in the diagnosis of infectious diseases in emergency situations. Phenotypic methodologies (staining, cultures, biochemical tests, and serology) still play a critical role in identifying, confirming, and providing antibiotic susceptibility testing for many microbial pathogens. As multiplex assays become increasingly available, there will be even greater temptation for taking a \"shotgun\" approach to diagnostic testing. These new technologies will not substitute for a proper history and physical examination leading to a thoughtful differential diagnosis. None the less, these new molecular tests increase the capability of the diagnostician to rapidly identify the microbiological etiology of an infection.
