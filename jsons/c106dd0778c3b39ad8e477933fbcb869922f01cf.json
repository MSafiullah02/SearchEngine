            "text": "Despite antiretroviral therapy, lung disease is a leading cause of death in individuals infected with human immunodefi ciency virus type 1 (HIV). Individuals infected with HIV are susceptible to serious bacterial and viral infections, such as pneumococcus and infl uenza, which are particularly problematic for lung health, resulting in lung injury. Additionally, HIV-infected individuals are susceptible to a number of pulmonary diseases for unknown reasons. Alcohol, the most commonly abused drug in the world, continues to exact an enormous toll on morbidity and mortality in individuals living with HIV. Chronic alcohol abuse has been shown to affect lung immunity, resulting in signifi cant lung injury. There is a paucity of literature on the additive effects of HIV and alcohol, two diseases of immune senescence, in the lung. This chapter begins by discussing the latest literature evaluating the epidemiology of HIV, alcohol use, and lung health focusing on two prevalent infections, tuberculosis and pneumococcal pneumonia. In parallel, we discuss the interactions of alcohol and HIV on the risk for acute lung injury and subsequent morbidity and mortality. We then discuss the pathophysiology of how these two diseases of immune dysfunction affect the lung, with a focus on the oxidative stress, alveolar macrophage host immune capacity, and immunomodulatory role of zinc in the airway. Finally, we review the latest literature on how HIV and alcohol affect other pulmonary disorders including chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, pulmonary hypertension, and lung cancer.",

In this cohort, approximately 67 % were current users and of these, 41 % drank in moderation, 23 % drank hazardously, and 35 % carried a diagnosis of abuse or dependence. The degree of alcohol use varied by demographic and HIV-related factors, and antiviral therapy (ART) did not vary signifi cantly by alcohol use. When considering timing of alcohol consumption, past consumption demonstrated an equivalent or a higher prevalence of disease than did current consumption, so the authors concluded that past consumers were somehow different than lifetime abstainers. Associations of medical disease with alcohol use were independent of age, CD4 cell count, viral load, intravenous drug use, smoking, and exercise. Consequently, the authors concluded that there was no evidence of a \"safe\" level of consumption of alcohol among those with HIV infection [ 20 ] . Using 1999 and 2000 data from Active Bacterial Core surveillance and the National Health Interview Survey, Kyaw et al. determined the rates of invasive pneumococcal disease in healthy adults and in adults with high-risk conditions and found that, compared with healthy adults, the risk of invasive pneumococcal disease was 11-fold higher for those that abused alcohol and 23-48-fold higher in adults with HIV/AIDS [ 42 ] . The risk also increased with the number of conditions present, suggesting that the combination of HIV/AIDS and alcohol had compounding effects on the risk of pneumonia [ 42 ] . Murdoch et al. showed in an observational cohort of 300 HIV-infected individuals receiving care between 1996 and 2005 that a high proportion (60 %) reported prior and/or current alcohol abuse [ 43 ] . Multivariate analyses showed that younger age, alcohol use, lack of ART use, lower CD4 counts, and higher HIV RNA were independent predictors of pneumonia. Most recently, Crothers et al. analyzed data from the VACS virtual cohort of 33,420 HIV-infected veterans and 66,840 age-, sex-, race-, and site-matched uninfected control subjects to determine the incidence of pulmonary diseases in HIVinfected persons compared with non-HIV persons. They found that, even in the era of ART, HIV infection increased the risk of bacterial pneumonia ~7-fold (7.5 % vs.",

ART has decreased morbidity and mortality [ 50 -52 ] , and overall ICU and hospital mortality associated with critical illness in HIV-infected individuals has decreased [ 53 -57 ] . However, given the high prevalence of alcohol-use disorders in this population and the likelihood that these individuals will not adhere to ART and other HIV therapies, there is an increased likelihood of worsened outcomes in HIV-infected persons who abuse alcohol. Palepu et al. prospectively analyzed a database of 7,015 index ICU admissions at two teaching hospitals in Canada, of which 4.4 % where HIV infected and 56 % of these patients had a history of drug and alcohol dependence. In contrast, only 7.4 % of the HIV-negative patients had a history of drug and alcohol dependence. Using multivariate regression, the authors found that a history of alcohol dependence, regardless of HIV status, was not associated with hospital mortality after adjusting for age, sex, APACHE II scores (an index of acute and chronic health stresses), and acute overdose diagnosis. In contrast, HIV infection was strongly associated with increased hospital mortality [ 58 ] . Further, other studies have shown that HIV infection independently increased mortality in patients with acute lung injury [ 59 , 60 ] .",

Chronic HIV infection alone has been known to cause signifi cant oxidative stress systemically, both in preclinical [ 73 -75 ] and clinical studies [ 76 -78 ] . GSH levels were found to be decreased greater than 90 % in HIV transgenic rats compared to wild-type rats, and the GSSG/GSH ratios were increased threefold [ 75 ] . In response to endotoxemia induced by intraperitoneal lipopolysaccharide instillation, HIV-infected animals also have decreased GSH, increased nitric oxide metabolites, and increased superoxide anion production [ 73 ] . Clinically, plasma cysteine levels were significantly lower in HIV-infected subjects compared to control subjects [ 78 ] , and several studies have shown that HIV-infected individuals have disturbances in GSH redox balance [ 79 -81 ] . GSH defi ciency has even been associated with impaired survival in HIV-infected subjects [ 82 ] . Chronic alcohol consumption is known to cause deleterious effects on host defense and immune responses. Alcohol toxicity has also been associated with oxidative stress and free radical-mediated injury [ 83 , 84 ] and lipid peroxidation [ 85 ] .

Bautista et al. demonstrated in a simian model of simian immunodefi ciency virus (SIV) and alcohol intoxication enhanced reactive oxygen species formation by Kupffer cells and endothelial cells [ 87 ] . The liver is a major organ for clearance of microbial particles because of the preponderance of tissue Kupffer cells or macrophages. During HIV infection or prolonged alcohol use, Kupffer cells can produce a wide array of infl ammatory substances while also serving as scavenger cells. Alcohol can enhance the body's susceptibility to retrovirus infection, thus increasing the progression to AIDS [ 88 ] . Alcohol-induced alterations in signal transduction may also lead to host immune dysregulation. Helper T (Th) cells produce a number of cytokines that modulate the immune system. Retrovirus infection has been known to cause abnormal cytokine production, such as increases in IL-4 and IL-5, which results in a switch from a Th1 to a Th2 response. These changes have resulted in a progression to AIDS, defi ned by a decline in T-cell production [ 89 ] . In a murine model of AIDS, Wang et al. found that elevated levels of Th2 cytokines were further increased by alcohol consumption [ 90 ] . Additionally, release of IL-2, normally suppressed in murine AIDS, was further suppressed with alcohol [ 91 ] . These results suggest that chronic alcohol consumption could exacerbate the Th1/Th2 imbalance seen in AIDS. The role of antioxidant defense mechanisms to protect against oxidative stress is well characterized in the liver, and the effects of alcohol in altering oxidant/antioxidant systems in the liver are also well known. Although the exact effects of HIV on this system are unknown, there are several antioxidant defense systems that could be altered by both alcohol and HIV, including superoxide dismutase, catalase, and glutathione peroxidase. Chen et al. investigated the effects of chronic alcohol ingestion on antioxidant defenses in mice infected with retrovirus, which causes an AIDS-like disease [ 92 ] . They found that alcohol and murine AIDS alone caused specifi c effects on antioxidant mechanisms, but the combination led to more severe effects with respect to liver GSH levels and superoxide dismutase. The mechanism of this observed synergistic effect of alcohol and HIV infection is unclear at this time. It is possible that the virus leads to higher alcohol concentrations, as was seen in a previous animal study [ 92 ] , and thereby potentiates alcohol toxicity or that HIV inhibits pathways of alcohol metabolism.",

Our research group at Emory University has been instrumental in many studies examining the effects of alcohol abuse on lung immune function [ 48 , 93 -95 ] . Specifi cally, we have shown that chronic alcohol ingestion causes oxidative stress as refl ected by GSH defi ciency and epithelial barrier dysfunction in both preclinical and clinical studies. With respect to HIV infection, our group identifi ed that chronic HIV transgene expression in animal models causes signifi cant alveolar oxidative stress, as refl ected by a greater than 90 % decrease in GSH levels, and a threefold increase in GSSG/GSH ratios [ 74 ] . Others have also shown similar results [ 73 , 96 ] . In clinical studies, the results have been somewhat less conclusive. Pacht et al. reported that the concentration of GSH in the epithelial lining fl uid was similar between HIV-infected and non-infected subjects [ 97 ] ; however, these same authors demonstrated in a small study of 33 HIV-infected subjects that GSH levels in the epithelial lining fl uid were signifi cantly decreased over time [ 98 ] . Others have also shown that HIV-infected subjects had a defi ciency of GSH in the lung [ 99 , 100 ] , but these studies have involved small number of subjects. Our group determined that chronic alcohol ingestion exacerbated defects in alveolar epithelial permeability and lung water clearance in HIV-1 transgenic rats [ 101 ] . Additionally, cultured alveolar epithelial cells from alcohol-fed HIV-1 transgenic rats had increased paracellular permeability to sucrose. This dysfunction correlated with alterations in the expression of tight junction proteins. These effects appeared to be mediated by oxidative stress as alveolar epithelial barrier function and tight junction protein localization were restored by supplementation with procysteine, a GSH precursor.",

Tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-\u03b1) serves as an important mediator in the pro-infl ammatory response of the host to an invading pathogen [ 107 ] . Numerous studies have shown that neutralization of TNF-\u03b1 impairs clearance of a variety of microorganisms including S . pneumoniae and M . tuberculosis [ 108 , 109 ] . Stoltz et al. conducted a study to determine the effects of alcohol and SIV on alveolar macrophage TNF-\u03b1 production and found that alveolar macrophages from SIV-infected nonhuman primates had a depressed response and that alcohol ingestion further suppressed the TNF-\u03b1 response by approximately 50 % [ 110 ] . Because of the vital role of TNF-\u03b1 in generating an effective immune response, these results suggest that alcohol abuse may further impair host immune defense in HIV-infected individuals. Others have also reported decreased TNF-\u03b1 production by alveolar macrophages from subjects with HIV [ 111 ] and alcohol [ 112 ] . Nelson et al. utilized the macaque SIV infection model to examine the effect of chronic alcohol feeding on SIV burden during the course of S . pneumoniae infection and found that the chronic alcohol-fed macaques showed a prolonged increase in SIV RNA in their lungs [ 113 ] . Additionally, alveolar macrophages from these alcohol-fed animals had greater nuclear factor kappa beta (NF-\u039aB) activation. This study suggests that chronic alcohol abuse results in increased SIV replication within the lung and it is possible that increased NF-\u039aB activation is part of the mechanism.",

Studies have shown that alcoholism causes systemic alterations in zinc metabolism [ 115 , 116 ] . Further, there is evidence that chronic alcoholism alters zinc bioavailability in the lung and may be an important mechanism by which chronic alcohol exposure predisposes individuals to pulmonary infection and acute lung injury [ 117 , 118 ] . Recent experimental evidence has demonstrated that the HIV phenotype is characterized by a similar state of zinc defi ciency and immune dysfunction within the alveolar space [ 119 , 120 ] . This zinc-depleted state contributes to further immune dysfunction in a host that is already compromised by HIV. While there have been no studies to determine the combined effect of alcohol and HIV, it stands to reason that zinc defi ciency and its consequences would be much more severe among HIV-infected individuals who suffer from alcohol-use disorders.",

COPD presents at an earlier age, with fewer pack-years of smoking, and is more prevalent in HIVinfected individuals than in uninfected individuals [ 19 ] . In addition, a high HIV viral load and a low CD4 cell count were associated with an increased prevalence of spirometry-defi ned obstructive lung disease in a cohort at risk for COPD and HIV infection [ 121 ] . Unfortunately, no assessment of alcohol use was reported in this study. In parallel, other studies have suggested that HIV may also be associated with an increased risk for several different manifestations of airway and obstructive lung disease, including features of emphysema [ 122 , 123 ] , chronic bronchitis [ 124 ] , nonspecifi c airway disease or bronchial hyper-responsiveness (such as is seen in asthma) [ 125 , 126 ] , and bronchiectasis [ 127 ] ; nonspecifi c focal air trapping with decreased expiratory fl ow rates [ 128 ] and bronchial dilatation [ 129 ] have also been described.

This increased risk was found to be independent of smoking [ 135 ] . In a large VA study comparing HIV-infected to uninfected veterans, HIV infection was found to be an independent risk factor for lung cancer after controlling for potential confounders including smoking [ 136 ] . In this study, alcohol abuse, defi ned by ICD9 codes, was not independently associated with lung cancer. Outcomes for patients with lung cancer were initially found to be poor and related to low CD4 counts [ 137 ] . In the large Swiss cohort study, lung cancer was not clearly associated with immunodeficiency but was attributable mainly to heavy smoking [ 138 ] . A recent report found no signifi cant difference in clinical outcome between patients with HIV and uninfected controls with non-small-cell lung cancer, including those with curative surgical resection in early-stage disease [ 139 ] . These data suggested that HIV status should not affect therapeutic decision making.",

Alcohol abuse also decreases adherence to medical regimens including the consistent use of ART, which only further exacerbates the HIV infection. Alcohol abuse and HIV each imposes oxidative stress and zinc defi ciency within the lung and together cause severe lung epithelial and macrophage dysfunction. Therefore, it is critically important that alcohol-use disorders be identifi ed and treated whenever possible in the care of an individual living with HIV.",
