A dilemma that confronted them was that post-nuclear America would need a C3 (command, control and communications) network, linking city-to-city, state-to-state and base-to-base. A nuclear attack would render any conceivable network in tatters, no matter how meticulous the planning for network protection was to make it nuclear and EMP proof. Baffled by the problem of control, the Rand Corporation discarded the concept of centralized authority over the network on the reasoning that such a network would be the first to be targeted and eliminated by an enemy missile attack [1].",

One major NSA supplier \"The IDEAS Operation\" now offers micro-miniature digital receivers, which can simultaneously process Sigint (Signal Intelligence) data from eight independent channels. This radio receiver is the size of a credit card. It fits in a standard laptop computer. IDEAS claim, reasonably, that their tiny card performs functions that would have taken a rack full of equipment not long ago [1] .",

The most serious attack has been that of the Chernobyl virus., written by a Taiwanese computer-engineering student, Chen Ing-hao. The virus, released on the Internet in 1998, lay dormant until April 26, 2003, when it got activated and wreaked havoc on computers around the globe. It reportedly impaired 360,000 computers in China and caused damage of up to $120 million, according to the official New China News Agency. Whereas China accused Taiwan of complicity, the Taiwanese authorities maintained that it was an individual act of crime. The Guaangzhou Military Region, which includes the South China Sea Fleet and the Second Artillery units, was hit with a computer virus throughout its entire network, linking 85 strategic and combat bases. In the morning hours of April 26, 2003, the entire system was paralyzed. The Central Military Commission and the Headquarters of the General Staff had no alternative but to declare a state of emergency in order to mobilize the command system and military defenses. At the same time, Jiang Zemin immediately signed an emergency order placing the Nanjing Military Region and the East China Sea Fleet on second-degree combat readiness. This was the first time China's military entered a second degree combat readiness since the death of Deng Xiaoping in February 1997. According to an internal military announcement, it was discovered that computer operations of the Chinese Central Command had been severely disrupted. After the incident, the State Council and the Central Committee Military Commission promptly ordered the formation of a task force composed of the General staff Intelligence Department; General staff Technology and Communications Department; Ministry of Defense Technological Intelligence Department; Institute of Military Sciences' Special Technologies Department (also known as Department 553)",
