At present there are nearly 3.5 million global cases of SARS-CoV-2, with nearly 250,000 deaths. Treatments are rapidly evolving during the time of this deadly pandemic and several drugs remain under investigation as potential therapies for critically ill COVID-19 patients. Proposed antiviral treatment options include hydroxychloroquine, remdesivir, and lopinavir/ritonavir, which are all safe in pregnancy [1]. Other potential therapies which are contraindicated in pregnancy include ribavirin and baricitinib [1]. Ribavirin has teratogenic properties; it induces miscarriages and leads to craniofacial and limb defects in mouse models [1,2]. Baricitinib has shown embryotoxicity in mouse models [1,3].",

Taking into account this patient's severe respiratory failure, established co-morbidities, and the limited fetal benefit of steroids at 22 weeks of gestation, antenatal steroids were deferred during her admission.

However, given the correlation of significant cytokine storm with severe disease, the use of low- to medium-dose glucocorticoids may be of use in patients who have already progressed to a critical disease state [11]. As the patient had rapid progression from mild to critical disease, with a known history of asthma, the decision was made to initiate a short course of IV glucocorticoids with hydrocortisone 50 mg IV which was started as a three times daily dose and tapered over the course of five days. Appropriate steps to establish management of hyperglycemia were also initiated at this time.",

The patient was gradually weaned off paralytics with an appropriate response.

Oxygen requirements were gradually decreased and on HD 11, the patient was successfully transitioned to room air. Liver enzymes normalized. No renal dysfunction was observed throughout the hospitalization. No further episodes of cardiac arrhythmia occurred during this admission. On HD 14, at 24 weeks and 2 days of gestation, she was ambulating with mild shortness of breath, vital signs remained stable and within normal limits, and the patient was found to be appropriate for discharge following her final dose of remdesivir.

At present no official guidance has been published for the use of remdesivir in the treatment of COVID-19, but use under compassionate-use protocols it is available as research into the efficacy of this therapy is ongoing. On the date of this patient's admission an application was made for compassionate-use remdesivir therapy, which was subsequently approved. Remdesivir was initiated on day 5 of this patient's hospitalization, by which time the patient's status had deteriorated and she required mechanical ventilation as described. Following initiation of remdesivir the patient improved relatively quickly and was able to be extubated on day 5 of the 10-day course of remdesivir therapy. The patient was able to be transitioned to room air 24 h later, and was subsequently discharged on no supplemental oxygen on day 10 of her remdesivir trial. This result is in line with other such case reports of compassionate-use remdesivir, which, while limited in power and uncontrolled, have shown that initiation of remdesivir may reduce time to extubation, increase the rate of extubation, and decrease mortality in COVID-19 patients requiring mechanical ventilation or extracorporeal oxygen therapy [7]. Randomized controlled trials are ongoing and needed to determine the efficacy of remdesivir in the management of critically ill SARS-CoV-2 infected patients, but this case and other limited case series show promise for remdesivir as a viable therapy for COVID-19.",
