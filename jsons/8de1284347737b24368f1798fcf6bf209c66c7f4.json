            "text": "Article type: CorrespondenceThe novel coronavirus diffused rapidly in Europe and especially in Northern Italy in the second half of February 2020 after the Chinese outbreak in the beginning of December 2019(1) (2) (3). Shortly after, it was characterized as a pandemic by the World Health Organization.Many hospitals had to face a shortage of hospital beds as ordinary care and intensive care units became dedicated to patients affected by COVID-19 (4). This issue became immediately evident and a massive reorganization of the hospital units took place(5).As elective operations were cancelled, surgeons are currently performing only emergency or undeferrable oncologic surgery. The increased need for Intensive Care Unit (ICU) beds led to the conversion of operating rooms and recovery areas into critical care units as well as the relocation of the surgical staff to ICU and COVID-19 units. Surgical units were consequently reshuffled in order to admit a totally different kind of patients. This quick transformation of a surgical unit into a COVID-19 unit requires a various number of technical precautions and practical steps. At a time when guidelines and recommendation were not yet available, our team had to face this emergency situation taking sharp decisions in order to re-organize the surgical units and staff.",

            "text": "Some unit may experience an increase in daily oxygen need of about 400% (in our experience the usual oxygen flow was about 800 lit/die per unit, increasing up to 3500 lit/die during COVID-19 patients' hospitalization). In fact, in a hospital unit of approximately 30 beds, oxygen flow level must be kept above 400 lit/min within a 4 bar pressure in order to simultaneously run continuous positive airways pressure (C-PAP) hoods, Venturi masks and high flow nasal cannula. The dedicated technical staff must establish how many C-PAP hoods and high-flow bags can operate simultaneously in that unit. It is essential to develop a hospital control panel for the overall oxygen consumption in order to distribute the patients in C-PAP hood without overloading the single units. A sudden decrease of oxygen pressures inside the C-PAP hoods can in fact bring to a rapid respiratory failure due to the increase in carbon dioxide pressures.3. COVID-19 patients need continuous nursing assistance. The nursing staff must be empowered to meet this need. The surgical nurses should stay employed to guarantee the routine care of patients. However, a nurse coming from a unit where non-invasive ventilation is routinely performed must be included in every nursing guard shift.",
