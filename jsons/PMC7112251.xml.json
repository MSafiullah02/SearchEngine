Lower airway symptoms included cough during the day and during the night, wheezing/noisy breathing during the day and during the night, and cough/wheezing/noisy breathing during exercise. Each of these symptoms was scored from 0 (no symptoms) to 4 (severely troublesome symptoms). Parents were advised to contact the study physician and arrange an appointment within 48 hours after the child started wheezing and having at least 1 of the lower airways symptoms, difficulty breathing, or nighttime awakening. PEF was measured daily in the morning and evening by using the electronic PEF meter PiKo-1 (nSpire Health, Longmont, Colo), which records time and date along with the PEF measurements. These records were used as an indirect way to assess compliance in filling out the diary cards.

This is not the case for nasal NO of subjects with disease limited to the upper respiratory tract,37 suggesting that NO production is mainly associated with lower respiratory tract pathology. Moreover, it has been shown that rhinovirus is able to infect the bronchial epithelium and induce local inflammation, probably leading to asthma exacerbations in predisposed subjects.38 Because airway NO is considered to play a pivotal role in antiviral defense,39 Feno changes measured during these episodes conceivably reflect host-defense response to virus-induced airway inflammation. Feno measurements in our study returned to baseline values within 10 days, probably reflecting basal NO production rather than disease activity, as previously suggested in a more persistent population.10 It is not clear whether virus-induced Feno increase can be downregulated by corticosteroids, but it seems unlikely because steroids, especially for rhinovirus infection, do not seem to modulate virus-induced interferon responses of the bronchial epithelium.40 This might explain why, at least in this phenotype and age group, Feno does not seem to perform well in predicting inhaled corticosteroid response41 and why corticosteroid therapy does not seem to have any disease-modifying effect on the progression of episodic wheezing.42, 43 However, it is not known whether this acute, short-lasting inflammatory response, especially if it relapses multiple times after new respiratory tract viral infections, could predispose to or explain the transition from an unclear and uncertain asthmatic status to a definite chronic inflammatory process characterizing asthma. Further studies are needed to elucidate this issue, and some promising approaches have already been initiated (www.predicta.eu).",

            "text": "In conclusion, this study clearly demonstrates that inflammation, airway limitation, and symptoms are significantly associated in a longitudinal manner throughout an acute wheezing episode in 4- to 6-year-old children with virus-induced wheezing episodes. Feno values increase significantly during the first 48 hours of the episode and return to baseline \u201cpersonal normal\u201d values within 10 days. On the basis of the FET expected in this age group, FEV0.5 seems to be the most appropriate parameter to assess airflow limitation and bronchodilation response both at baseline and during a wheezing episode. Both Feno and FEV0.5 are also promising in correctly identifying and monitoring patients with (virus-induced) airway obstruction at the acute phase of a wheezing episode. Longitudinal assessment of time-dependent lung function and airway inflammation parameters appears to be superior to cross-sectional analyses, while at the same time it highlights the need for an individualized approach in patients with complex diseases, such as asthma.Key messages\n\u2022Mild virus-induced wheezing episodes in 4- to 6-year-old children are characterized by airflow limitation and airway inflammation, sharing these characteristics with other asthma phenotypes.\u2022Feno values increase during the first 48 hours of such an episode and return to personal baseline values within 10 days without anti-inflammatory treatment and independently of atopic status.\u2022Feno and FEV0.5 values, when assessed longitudinally and in an individualized manner, might help when monitoring such episodes.\n\n",
