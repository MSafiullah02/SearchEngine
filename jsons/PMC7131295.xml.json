It leads to an increase in urine protein, myocardial calcium protein at an early stage. Its severe rate is quite high [[13], [14], [15]]. The latest literature shows that the mortality rate of patients with severe new coronavirus lung infection can be as high as 61.5% [16]. Therefore, the burn department medical staff must fully realize the characteristics and hazards of the new coronavirus. Both Hubei and other places that have been slightly alleviated, should establish a high degree of vigilance on the epidemic in clinical work. The epidemic prevention and control awareness shall be truly implemented into every procedure and detail of clinical work. By improving the prevention and control programs and strengthening personal protection awareness and training skills, try the best to minimize or avoid infection of medical personnel.",
