Intravenous cidofovir therapy was initiated, but shortly thereafter he required another admission for refractory hemoptysis, which was found to be stemming from the large, right-sided endobronchial lesion. After multiple failed bronchial artery embolizations, the patient underwent right pneumonectomy. He initially did well after surgery and was discharged to home on oxygen administered by nasal cannula. However, he presented approximately 1 week later with shortness of breath. He was found to have hypercarbic respiratory failure, which progressed to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and this was the cause of his death at age 20 years. Of note, pathology from his pneumonectomy revealed squamous cell cancer with positive mediastinal lymph nodes. Figure 13 .3 shows a cut section of the lung with multiple areas of squamous cell carcinoma invading the adjacent lung parenchyma. Figure 13 .4 shows photomicrographs of four pathologic specimens obtained at the time of pneumonectomy. ",

            "text": "Respiratory papillomas are the most common benign laryngeal tumor in children. Juvenile recurrent respiratory papillomatosis (RRP) is typically identified between the ages of 2 and 3 years and is related to acquisition of HPV during passage through the birth canal of an infected mother. Risk factors for development of RRP include being a firstborn child, which often implies longer labor, having a teenage mother with genital condylomata, and having a mother with a lower socioeconomic status. RRP is caused most commonly by HPV types 6 and 11 and less commonly by type 16. The estimated incidence of juvenile RRP is 4.3 per 100,000 children. RRP can cause obstruction of the larynx, which can lead to hoarseness and respiratory difficulty. Laryngoscopy will often reveal multiple verrucous growths along the true vocal cords, along the false vocal cords, in the subglottic region, and in the trachea. Many children with RRP will require multiple procedures to excise the papillomas. Often, the lesions will diminish around puberty. Rarely, the papillomas can spread into the lower respiratory tract and undergo malignant transformation. Multiple therapies have been attempted for RRP, including interferon, photodynamic therapy, ribavirin, acyclovir, intralesional and intravenous cidofovir, intralesional mumps vaccine, bevacizumab, and others. Systemic therapy should be considered when the patient requires more than four surgical interventions per year, when there is evidence of spread to the lungs, when the papillomas are noted to regrow rapidly after excision, and when there is airway obstruction. Approximately 10% of patients with RRP will require systemic therapy. \u03b1-interferon is the most common sys-temic therapy utilized in patients with RRP. It is believed to trigger a host immune response that inhibits viral protein synthesis. However, responses have been mixed in the literature and there are tolerability concerns. Some experts recommend a trial of \u03b1-interferon for 6 months followed by an assessment of disease response before deciding to continue. Abbreviated from [3] ",

(b) (Right upper): A benign squamous papilloma (left) extends into an airway lumen, with no invasion into the airway wall (right). HPV-related changes are present in the squamous epithelium, but high-grade dysplasia is absent (H&E, 2.5\u00d7). (c) (Left lower): Benign squamous papillomas extend from the bronchiolar wall into the airway lumen (top half of photomicrograph",

Squamous cell carcinoma arises from the benign papillary epithelium and invades the underlying lung parenchyma (lower right) (H&E, 2.5\u00d7). (d) (Right lower): Squamous cell carcinoma (lower left) invades and destroys the normal alveolar lung parenchyma (upper right). Note the pushing border of invasion, neutrophilic microabscesses, and tumor necrosis. Significant keratinization is absent (H&E, 10\u00d7) (Photos courtesy of Dr. David B. Chapel, University of Chicago, Department of Pathology) which is acquired during passage through the birth canal. \u2022 RRP causes papilloma growth in the larynx and trachea and rarely can spread to the lower respiratory tract and undergo malignant transformation. \u2022 RRP is often treated with local, intralesional therapy. \u2022 Systemic therapy should be considered in patients who require multiple surgical interventions per year, when there is spread to the lungs, when the papillomas rapidly regrow after excision, and when there is airway obstruction. \u2022 Although HPV 6 and 11 are considered low risk for malignancy, in RRP, they may cause squamous cell cancer of the lung as in this patient. \u2022 Gardasil 9 includes HPV types 6 and 11 that are considered low risk for malignancy but cause genital warts and HPV types 16, 18, 31, 33, 45, 52, and 58 that associated with high risk for cervical, vaginal, vulvar, anal, penile, and oropharyngeal squamous cell cancer. \u2022 HPV 16 and 18 cause approximately 70% of all cervical cancers, and HPV types 31, 33, 45, 52, and 58 cause about 15% of all cervical cancers.",
