            "text": "Duck viral enteritis (DVE), or duck plague (DP), is an acute, contagious herpesvirus infection of ducks, geese, and swans of all ages and species. The disease has been responsible for significant economic losses in domestic and wild waterfowl as a result of mortality, and decreased egg production (Saif et al., 2003). The disease is caused by duck enteritis virus (DEV), and is characterized by vascular damage, tissue hemorrhages, eruptions on the digestive mucosa, lesions of lymphoid organs, and degenerative changes in parenchymatous organs (Barr et al., 1992, Shawky et al., 2000). The disease is difficult to monitor and control because the virus establishes an asymptomatic carrier state in waterfowl that is detectable only during periods of intermittent virus shedding (Burgess et al., 1979). The diagnostic procedures that are currently used to identify DEV antigen include virus isolation and identification (Burgess and Yuill, 1981, Hwang et al., 1975), the reverse passive hemagglutination test (Deng et al., 1984), histopathology (Shawky et al., 2000, Xuefeng et al., 2008a), immunofluorescence (Proctor, 1975), immunoperoxidase staining (Malmarugan and Sulochana, 2002), immunohistochemistry (Islam et al., 1993, Xuefeng et al., 2008b), electron microscopy (Yuan et al., 2005), and the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) (Hansen et al., 1999, Hansen et al., 2000, Pritchard et al., 1999).",

The methods mentioned above are both time consuming and labor intensive; moreover, samples for virus isolation are easily contaminated, and the equipment or personnel required for PCR may not be available. The antigen-capture ELISA (AC-ELISA) technique, with characterized sensitivity and specificity, has been applied to the detection of viruses, e.g. avian influenza virus (He et al., 2007, Velumani et al., 2008), bovine leukaemia virus (Juliarena et al., 2007), and the nucleocapsid antigen of SARS-CoV (Che et al., 2004). The genomic organization of DEV remains unclear, however, and there are very few reports of the prokaryotic expression of DEV genes, or on use of the AC-ELISA method for the efficient detection of DEV antigen.",

Moreover, the use of polyclonal antibodies to detect antigens by ELISA is more sensitive than use of a monoclonal antibody (El-Mekki et al., 1987). Fortunately, the DEV UL24 gene had been newly isolated and identified, and the protein had been expressed in a prokaryotic expression system in our laboratory. The DEV UL24 protein, a conserved protein, may play an important role in the life cycle of the virus, as with other herperviruses described previously (Blakeney et al., 2005, Pearson and Coen, 2002), but there is no information about its properties or function. Thus, it is necessary to perform research on the immunogenicity of UL24 and to establish a more rapid ELISA method for detection of the DEV UL24 antigen with a protein antibody directed against UL24. The development and evaluation of a sensitive and specific AC-ELISA to detect the DEV UL24 antigen, using both rabbit and duck anti-DEV UL24 IgG antibodies prepared by prokaryotic expression of the UL24 protein, are described in this paper.",

            "text": "To improve their ability to detect DEV, as well as for disease control purposes, laboratories need more rapid and less cumbersome methods for the direct identification of the viral antigen in clinical specimens. Current methods for the detection of antigen, such as immunohistochemistry, viral isolation, and immuno-electron microscopy, are unable to detect antigen quickly enough. However, of the numerous techniques developed for the rapid diagnosis of viral infections in recent years, the AC-ELISA provides a platform that is capable of mass screening of clinical specimens. It also offers well-documented advantages over more traditional methods of antigen detection. The use of monoclonal antibodies may not only improve the sensitivity and specificity of an ELISA, but may also allow distinction between virus serotypes and different antigens, as well as between subclasses of IgG antibody (Clavijo et al., 1998). In some studies of captured antigens, not only single strains of monoclonal antibody (Stephanie et al., 2008, Van den Berg et al., 2004, Velumani et al., 2008), but also multiple strains of monoclonal antibodies (Katarzyna et al., 2002), have been used to enhance the sensitivity of the test. Although the components of polyclonal antibodies are complex, and the specificity is inferior to that of tests that use monoclonal antibody, some researchers are still inclined to choose polyclonal antibodies for the detection of antigens by ELISA, because of the higher sensitivity (El-Mekki et al., 1987). The antigenicity and immunogenicity of DEV from different regions are almost identical, and the diversity of different strains of DEV can be ignored (Jansen, 1968, Shawky and Sandhu, 1997). Therefore a polyclonal antibody is superior to a monoclonal antibody for the detection of DEV antigen. In this study, in order to enhance the specificity and sensitivity of the AC-ELISA, rabbit polyclonal antibodies with high affinity and specificity for DEV, prepared by use of the DEV UL24 protein, were used for antigen capture. The results showed that the limit of sensitivity of the AC-ELISA for detection of the DEV antigen was approximately 46 ng/100 \u03bcl.",

Furthermore, a blocking assay was used to demonstrate the specificity of the AC-ELISA. It was shown that serum samples positive for antibodies against DEV UL24 reduced the OD450 nm values obtained using purified DEV significantly. The high sensitivity and specificity of the assay are likely to be due to the fact that the DEV UL24 expression protein contained a single component. Complete DEV virions probably integrate with the two exposed epitope-binding sites of the polyclonal anti-DEV UL24 IgG in serum, and then the combination combines with the enzyme-tagged antibody.",
