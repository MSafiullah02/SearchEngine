The purpose of this study was to investigate the prevalence of recently identified viruses, including human metapneumovirus (hMPV), human bocavirus (hBoV), human coronavirus NL63 (hCoV-NL63), and human coronavirus HKU1 (hCoV-HKU1) in children with acute wheezing. Viral etiology was identified in 231 children hospitalized with acute wheezing, aged from 1 month to 5 years. Viral antigens for common respiratory viruses were detected by IFA or multiplex PCR. RT-PCR was used to detect respiratory rhinoviruses, hCoV-NL63, hCoV-HKU1, and hMPV. PCR assays for hBoV DNA were performed using the primer sets for noncapsid protein (NP1) and nonstructural protein (NS1) genes. Viruses were found in 61.5% (142/ 231) of the study population and a single virus was detected in 45.5% (105/231) of the study population. Rhinovirus (33.3%), human respiratory syncytial virus (hRSV; 13.8%), and hBoV (13.8%) were the most frequently detected viruses. hMPV and hCoV-NL63 were detected in 7.8% and 1.3% of wheezing children, respectively. HCoV-HKU1 was not detected. In 16.0% of the study population, more than one virus was detected. In children with acute wheezing, rhinovirus, hRSV, and hBoV were most frequently detected. Further studies including healthy control subjects are needed to define the clinical significance of hBoV in acute wheezing.",

            "text": "Viral respiratory infections are the most common cause of acute expiratory wheezing in children. Human respiratory syncytial virus (hRSV) and rhinovirus are known to be important triggers of acute expiratory wheezing in children [Sigurs et al., 2000; Lemanske et al., 2005] , and recent studies using rhinovirus specific RT-PCR have indicated that rhinovirus is a major etiologic agent for acute bronchiolitis in infants [Papadopoulos et al., 2002; Jacque et al., 2006] . Recently, several new respiratory viruses have been identified, including human metapneumovirus (hMPV), and the human coronaviruses (hCoV-NL63 and hCoV-HKU1) [van den Hoogen et al., 2001; van der Hoek et al., 2005; Woo et al., 2005] . Of these new viruses, hMPV has been proposed to be an etiologic agent for acute wheezing in young children and adults, although some results have been contradictory [Rawlinson et al., 2003; Jartti et al., 2004; Williams et al., 2005] . Human bocavirus (HBoV) was recently identified as a member of the Parvoviridae and found to cause respiratory tract infections in people in Sweden [Allander et al., 2005] . Although the clinical significance of hBoV infection is still unclear despite frequent detection in respiratory specimens, hBoV has been detected in children with lower respiratory tract infection or asthma exacerbation Arnold et al., 2006; Chung et al., 2006; Ma et al., 2006; Sloots et al., 2006] . The purpose of this study was to investigate the role of recently identified respiratory viruses in acute expiratory wheezing in children.",

A total of 231 specimens, which were sufficient for virus diagnostic evaluation, were tested with IFA (DAKO, Cambridgeshire, UK) or multiplex RT-PCR for common respiratory viruses. Acute bronchiolitis was defined as expiratory wheezing with or without tachypnea, air trapping, and substernal retraction in children aged <3 years, and bronchial asthma was diagnosed when acute wheezing occurred three or more times in children of any age or occurred one or more times in children aged >3 years [Mertsola et al., 1991] . All the samples were collected after informed consents were obtained from the parents. The study protocol was approved by the Ethics Committee of the Sanggyepaik Hospital, Inje University. On admission, a nasopharyngeal aspirate sample was collected using a disposable catheter and suction device after application of normal saline 2 ml into the nostril. Nasopharyngeal aspirates were centrifuged and the supernatants were stored at \u00c0708C until tested.",

This difference may be due to several factors such as lower sensitivity of antigen detection methods and no test for enterovirus. These results show that the most frequently detected viruses in children with wheezing were rhinovirus and hRSV, which is consistent with previous reports [Heymann et al., 2004; Jartti et al., 2004] . RT-PCR has been used to show that rhinoviruses are the most frequently detected viruses in school-aged children with wheezing and that they are also found in 50% of the adults with acute wheezing [Rawlinson et al., 2003; Thumerelle et al., 2003; Heymann et al., 2004; Jartti et al., 2004] . In the present study, influenza A viruses were detected infrequently in the study population, which may be due to the low rate of influenza virus infection during the study period. In previous reports, co-detection of viruses was reported for 18-20% of children hospitalized with asthma, and hRSV and rhinovirus or hRSV and enterovirus were the most frequently detected virus combinations [Jartti et al., 2004; Nagayama et al., 2006] . In this study, of the 137 children in whom viruses were detected, 33 children were infected with more than one virus. Rhinovirus and hRSV, rhinovirus and hBoV, and hRSV and hMPV were the most common co-infections.",

In this study, peak rate of rhinovirus detection in wheezing children was in September, but hBoV and hMPV was in peak in May. It is an interesting finding that hBoV was detected most frequently during spring season, because it was found throughout the year in previous study [Chung et al., 2006] . This finding is different from those of previous studies, which show year-round detection of hBoV and mostly in winter months Arnold et al., 2006; Weissbrich et al., 2006] .

HCoV-HKU1 was not found in children with acute wheezing, which is different from recent studies showing high prevalence of hCoV-HKU1 in lower respiratory tract infections. This difference of hCoV-HKU1 prevalence may be due to several factors such as size of study population, low sensitivity of primers used, geographical variance, and cyclic pattern of hCoV-HKU1 infections.",

Other limitations of this study are not performing PCR for enteroviruses which were frequently detected in young children with asthma in previous studies [Rawlinson et al., 2003; Jartti et al., 2004] , and diagnostic tests for Chlamydia pneumoniae and Mycoplasma pneumoniae, both of which are known to be associated with the exacerbation of wheezing. However, it has previously been reported that M. pneumoniae infections are not often detected in patients with exacerbated asthma (1-5% of patients are infected) and C. pneumoniae infections are more commonly associated with prolonged asthmatic symptoms than with acute exacerbation [Cunningham et al., 1998; Freymuth et al., 1999; Thumerelle et al., 2003 ]. There are some other limitations including low specimen numbers which could account for no detection of hCoV-HKU1, the absence of specimens in some months, and mixed use of antigen detection methods and PCR testing for common respiratory viruses, which could have a different sensitivity or specificity.",
