            "text": "Referring to infectious disease, respiratory tract infections engage with all surfaces in the respiratory tract. Based on the infected zone, respiratory infections can be categorized into upper tract infection (URI or URTI) and lower tract infection (LRI or LRTI). Each involves different parts of the respiratory tract infections, which vary in type and severity of microorganisms. Although there are different types of respiratory tract infections, the acute form in the upper respiratory tract infection predominates and includes several complications, such as sinusitis, pharyngitis, epiglottitis, laryngitis, and tracheitis. On the other hand, lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI) includes both acute and chorionic types, such as pneumonia and bronchitis. Based on pathogenicity, bacterial and viral pathogens are the most common microorganisms in both types (ie, LRTI and URTI). Moreover, infection distribution leads to varieties based on the patient\u2019s age; for example, acute respiratory infections pose severe problem in childhood, which mainly occur in upper respiratory tract. Although the bacterial pathogens play a significant role in intensifying LRTIs, the major acute respiratory infections occur in upper respiratory tract, in these cases viral pathogens are the primary common pathogens, including influenza A and B, parainfluenza (type 1 and 3), adenovirus, and respiratory syncytial virus. Some of the common pathogens of the respiratory tract are listed in Table 16.1\n. Pathogen biodiversity, complexity, and mixed infections in many cases of respiratory tract infection have generated several problems for the treatment of respiratory infections. For example, various bacterial pathogens are encountered in several cases of viral infections. Therefore, the treatment of respiratory infections is a complex therapy which consists of several chemotherapy strategies.1., 2., 3. Antiviral (the same as antibacterial medication) is used to control the treatment and prevention of respiratory infections.",

The solidified medium in the Petri dish was inoculated with an appropriate colony of the microorganisms. This inoculation was accomplished by using a solution such as physiological saline solution containing adequate colony unit (commonly 100\u2013200 (CFU)/mL). The essential oil is incorporated into the mediums in two ways: on a paper disc or into a well (hole) which is made in the agar medium. Diluted or undiluted essential oils based on the goals were added to a sterile blank filter disk (5 mm diameter) and placed on top of the cultured media in a Petri dish or added to the holes. After incubation under optimal conditions such as temperature and time, two different zones were considered in view of the average diameter of changes: (1) the zone where there is no growth of the microorganism, called total inhibition; and (2), the zone where growth of the microorganisms was significantly reduced in terms of amount of colonies, compared to blank assays. The growth of the microorganisms is recognizable with instruments or can be seen visually by one of the commonly used techniques, called turbidimetry, in which the optical density changes in the growing culture (OD) are measured. Some commercial systems have been produced for monitoring of the microorganisms growth as well as other methods were proposed (eg, bioautography).76\n",

The difference is that agar broth cultures are grown in Petri dishes or tubes, but liquid broth cultures are cultivated in conical flasks filled with 100 mL medium or test tubes with 2.5\u20135 mL medium (bacteria and moulds). The inhibitory growth index is determined for the liquid broth in conical flasks (percent changes in mould\u2019s biomass comparing to the control culture). There is an inhibitory effect of essential oil which appears in the test tube cultures and is measured turbidimetrically or with the plate count method. The estimation of essential oil activity both in agar and liquid broth would be simplified through counting the tested microorganisms that can remain in the membrane. The lowest essential oil concentration in the broth that results in the lack of visible microorganism growth changes is known as the MIC. The microorganisms are then transferred from the lowest essential oil concentration medium (with no visible microorganism growth) into a new broth medium and incubation to determine the lethal activity of essential oil.78., 79.\n",

Phagocytic clearance of an infecting organism by inflammatory cells is an appropriate and necessary component of the host defense system.91 At the same time, much of the evidence points to destructive effects spectrum made by products of these inflammatory cells.92 These products can increase mucus secretion and impair ciliary clearance, thereby setting the stage for exacerbations and recurrences of infection. Primary inflammatory cell products can amplify the other steps of the inflammatory cycles and can paradoxically even impair the immune response. These observations suggest that modulating the inflammatory response may be an important aspect of definitive therapy for respiratory tract infection. The primary defense systems are the lung secretions and the mucociliary escalator, which entrap organisms and sweep them away. At the same time, the lung secretions also contain a variety of proteins that inhibit microorganisms, especially bacterial adherence for example immunoglobulin A (IgA) systems, which prevents bacterial adherence to epithelial cells, inhibit bacterial growth, and attempt to neutralize bacteria. The macrophages are a secondary defense system, which not only phagocytose microorganisms but also release biochemotactic factors that recruit other defense cells such as monocytes and neutrophils that are necessary for further phagocytosis process.93 The inflammatory response form a key part of the secondary defense system that accompanies additional proteins, such as immunoglobulins and complement factors. Although neutrophil infestation is part of the natural defenses against an invading organism, it may have destructive effects on the pulmonary systems. One of the destructive factors is the proteolytic enzyme neutrophil elastase, which is preformed and stored within the neutrophil. This proteinase is released after the neutrophil is activated and migrates into the tissues and phagocytosis invasive microorganisms. It produces a condition that histologically simulates chronic bronchitis. The potential role of neutrophil elastase in the pathogenesis of pulmonary diseases is characterized by neutrophil infiltration of the airways and increased mucus secretion.94 It has also been reported that \u201csecretions from patients with acute bronchial infection cause a significant reduction in ciliary beat frequency and that the addition of a neutrophil elastase inhibitor can reverse this effect.\u201d95 The increase in the mucus secretion and the decrease in ciliary beat have been found as an important feature of chronic lung disease frequently. Besides the phagocytic cell immediate responses, stimulated epithelial cells and macrophages produce the potent neutrophil chemoattractant, such as interleukin- 8 (IL-8), which was found to be present in high concentrations in the sputum of patients with chronic inflammatory airway disease.96 At the same time, elastase released by activated neutrophils also stimulates IL-8 production by the epithelial cells.97 Therefore, when these events are initiated, they become a self-amplifying cycle. This phenomenon is observed in patients with acute pneumonia that has apparently been cured by appropriate antibiotic therapy.",

These compounds have shown promising antiinflammatory potency among the many essential oil compounds.99 For example, 1,8-cineole (6) the major constituent of eucalyptus oil is another active essential oil constituent that is well tolerated in inhalation administrations. This compound can also be effective for airways inflammation in clinical trials, based on such finding 1.8-cineole (6) is registered as a licensed medicinal product and has been available for airways inflammation for many years.100 Similar effects were also observed in other monoterpenes especially in carvacrol (1) and thymol (2), which are main constituents in thymus, oregano, savory, clove, and nutmeg essential oils.

There is a good correlation observed between antiinflammatory activity of the limonene (25) and the essential oils rich in limonene (25) like grapefruit, lime, and celery.

It has been evaluated that activity of some of the essential oils such as Western red cedar (Thuja plicata) to inactivate several viruses implicated in respiratory infections, and to inhibit the influenza virus-induced secretion of cytokine (IL-6) in cultured human lung cells. However, the liquid essential oil phases are generally a higher irritant and possibly toxic for nasopharyngeal or oral applications, although a few reports have indicated that the vapors of some essential oils might be useful for application in inhaled vapors for respiratory infections in low concentrations.103 Because of the noteworthy role of inflammation in respiratory infectious disease persistence and recurrence, many laboratory models have been developed for inflammation and inflammation/infection-mixed respiratory complications research. Some of these models, such as ovalbumin-induced respiratory allergic eosinophilia arise especially for inflammation process which responds to them, including eosinophils, neutrophils, and other immune cell infiltration to the inflammation sites.104 In other models, in addition to this cellular pathogenesis, more attention is considered on the infection\u2019s correlation with inflammation mechanisms.105\nTable 16.5\nshows some of the attributes of inflammation and inflammation/infection major models that are used in screening of the new antiinflammation compounds.\n",

The massive biodiversity of natural sources, such as plants, means that the selection of the suitable starting source point is a critical step for achieving the best screening results. In particular, paying attention to the main chemical constitutions of these natural sources will help to clarify the results of this research. Analysis of the relationship between the chemical structures of natural compounds has led to a better overview of the rational uses of natural compounds and natural remedies for the control and treatment of disease, and has led to the development of therapeutics. The broad diversity of the chemical makeup of essential oils has caused some uncertainty over their best selection in complementary or investigative research. Therefore, a correct understanding of the relation between the potential effects and the plant\u2019s family is a useful guide for physicians and researchers. According to this finding, the volatile oils of plant families such as Asteraceae, Lamiaceae, Scrophulariaceae, Fabaceae, Myrtaceae, Rutaceae, Cupressaceae, and Pinaceae have good potential for use in infectious and inflammatory respiratory diseases, in both research and treatment. These plant based essential oils have a good feasibility for presentation as therapeutics in many of the respiratory infections and inflammatory diseases. Although these natural compounds have been used as complementary therapeutics, scientists must still give attention to their safety and dosage.",
