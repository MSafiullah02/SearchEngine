The immune assessment was carried out by utilizing assays described in the avian immune assessment panel (Dietert et al., 1994) . These included 1) the bursa, thymus, and spleen weight to body weight ratio as a measure of lymphoid organ integrity, 2) antibody response against SRBC as a measure of humoral immunity, and 3), PHA-P toe web assay as a measure of cell-mediated immunity. The PEMS-exposed poults exhibited significant suppression in all of these immunological end points when compared with the unexposed controls. The lymphoid organ data indicate that the growth of both primary and secondary lymphoid organs was suppressed significantly. Thymic atrophy started earlier than bursal atrophy in PEMS-exposed poults and was of a greater magnitude (fold decrease) than for the bursa and spleen. These atrophic changes in lymphoid organs started earlier in Trial 2 than in Trial 1 post-PEMS exposure. Such variation may be due to a possible uneven PEMS exposure, as the poults in each trial were exposed to PEMS agent(s) via different infected seeder poults rather than controlled injection with a defined agent. The changes in lymphocyte populations in these organs have not been determined yet. Preliminary immunohistochemistry observations suggest lymphoid depletion and fewer surface immunoglobulin-positive Blymphocytes in the bursas from PEMS-exposed poults than in the bursa of unexposed controls (unpublished observation).

This indeed, was found to be the case. When antibody response against SRBC was quantified, poults in the PEMS group were clearly suppressed. Within the first 3 to 4 d post-SRBC injection, PEMS poults had 1 to 2 log lower antibody levels. This suppression persisted for the entire 7 d period post-SRBC injection. In both antibody response trials, the observed decline in antibody levels was comparable between the PEMS-exposed and unexposed poults at the terminal stage of the primary anti-SRBC antibody response. By this age, PEMS exposure induces significant bursal, thymic, and splenic atrophy. However, what is not yet known is the integrity of lymphoid components (e.g., lymphocyte numbers, CD4 + , CD8 + cells) during the progression of lymphoid organ atrophy and disease. Studies are currently ongoing that would help in establishing any correlation between the lymphoid cell numbers:subpopulation ratios and the observed slower induction of primary antibody response in the PEMS-affected poults. Furthermore, antibody levels around Day 8 to 9 after SRBC injection in PEMS-exposed poults were lower than the unexposed poults numerically in Trial 1 (Table 4) and statistically in Trial 2 (Table 5) .
