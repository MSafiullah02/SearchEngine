France contractually controls several resources generated by the continent of Africa. Herein lies a technical proposal to free Africa from the financial and economic agreements coerced upon the continent over a century ago by utilizing decentralized collaboration through advanced technology. AfricaOS (AOS) aims to provide a philosophical, and fundamental framework for implementing a simple, distributed, collaborative computer for agreement amongst peers. The work also demonstrates an algebra over transactions, use of the protocol for privatization, a method for tokenizing barter economies, and methods to design mechanisms for use in implementing protocol behavior.",

The Banque de France will remain the guarantor and regulator of converting the Eco to the Euro. They will also maintain a fixed parity between the two currencies.

The price of Bitcoin has been nearly cut in half since the number of corona virus cases has spread so widely. It is at times like this where we realize the amount of reliance the general public has on government programs, and the currency of their nation. In my opinion, this will mark a changing point in our economic expectations of which will be similar to the time Satoshi Nakamoto introduced the Bitcoin project.

If \u03bb, the price of g in the transaction, is 0, the political pressure felt by the seller will be high, but the buyer will be elated at g being free, feeling little or no pressure. Once a value of \u03bb is proposed by M , a and b both report their p-function values at \u03bb. In this example, the goal function is to balance, or optimize \u03bb. This is just an ex-ample goal function over both p-functions, and much more advanced goal functions can be constructed using the same principles. Figure 11 shows the p-function for the seller of g. When \u03bb takes the value of 0, the political pressure felt by the agent representing the seller is maximal. Intuitively, this is because the seller of g is not economically incentivized to give g away for free. When \u03bb takes the value of 1, this represents the price of g being equivalent to the buyer's total reserves. The opposition to this p-function is the p-function of agent 2, a 2 , of which is representing the buyer. If \u03bb is 1, then the political pressure imposed by the buyer onto a 2 is maximal. \u03c4 2 max can be viewed as 100% of the value of g, or 100% of the buyer's reserves.",
