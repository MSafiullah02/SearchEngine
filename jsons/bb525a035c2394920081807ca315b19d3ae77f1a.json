            "text": "Objective and methods Various papers related to the application of adverse outcome pathways (AOPs) for the prevention of occupational disease were reviewed. The Internet was used as the primary tool to search for the necessary research data and information, using such online resources as Google Scholar, ScienceDirect, Scopus, NDSL, and PubMed. The key search terms were \"adverse outcome pathway,\" \"toxicology,\" \"risk assessment,\" \"human,\" \"worker,\" \"occupational safety and health,\" and so on. Results and conclusion The aim of this paper is to explain the use of AOP for the understanding of chemical toxicity as a conceptual means and to predict the toxic mechanism. The tools of AOP have emerged as a forward-looking alternative to the existing chemical risk assessment paradigm. AOP is being applied to the assessment of acute toxicity and to chronic toxic chemicals in the workplace. Not only can it lead to breakthroughs in occupational and environmental cancer prevention, it is also widely used in chemical risk assessment and has led to breakthroughs in the prevention of occupational disease in the workplace.",

Humans routinely use chemicals and can be exposed to them in everyday accidents. Although they are widely used, the impact of many chemicals on human health is still unknown. With increasing concern about the safety of chemicals, human exposure has emerged as an important issue such as humidifier disinfectants. Given the widespread use of chemicals, there are many risks associated with chemical accidents and diseases. Chemical incidents reported worldwide between 1970 and 1998 resulted in leaks, fires, and explosions involving more than 100,000 casualties [2, 3] . Since chemicals are stored in huge quantities, the magnitude and extent of damage when a chemical accident occurs can be significant [2] .",

In this context, the \"adverse outcome pathway (AOP)\" is a biological pathway that disturbs homeostasis, which causes toxicity. The description of toxicity begins with chemical characterization and explains the interaction between them. Target tests to identify impacts at critical stages of the pathway and dose-response extrapolation to estimate human exposure are required. Predicting ecosystem impacts requires additional population-based modeling. This is a conceptual framework for organizing existing biological information, and AOP consists of molecular initiative event (MIE), key events (KEs), and adverse outcome (AO). This independent element represents a biological response and is associated with major event relationships. The AOP concept provides instinctive risk identification to help assess the carcinogenicity of chemicals. This highlights the application of the AOP concept and the effective application of cancer prevention by predicting the carcinogenicity of chemicals [5] .",

Establishing the mode of action (MoA) hypothesis is based on causality criteria, considerations of coherence, specificity of relationships, coherent time relationships, dose-response relationships, biological validity, coherence of evidence, and alternative explanations [7] [8] [9] . The WoE is the concept of providing evidence that meets information requirements using information from independent sources [10] . One AOP should have one MIE and one AO, but there is no limit to the number of intermediate KEs, and each KE can be included in a different AOP. Adverse outcome pathways describe the sequence of causality in biological responses to chemicals at various levels [11] [12] [13] . Any type of information related to a biological response (e.g., in vivo and in vitro test results, electronic data, biomarkers, etc.) may be applied to the AOP [8] . Thus, AOP is a dynamic technology that allows existing information to be more accurately changed as the technology used to monitor biological responses evolves [14] . Because AOP is expressed in a simple flowchart, it is easy to instinctively understand the side effects of chemicals, and the concept of AOP is not a sudden occurrence, but an evolution of existing concepts related to toxic mechanisms [11, 15] .",

Early IPCS techniques set out some basic principles of pathwaybased techniques, and MoA is defined as a series of key events along biological pathways from initial chemical interactions to toxicological consequences. One MoA was studied at a time, recognizing that MoA does not have to be complete to be useful; a chemical can have more than one MoA and may therefore be associated with multiple possibilities, each of which can be critical to toxicity studies. To establish a model for defining \"key events\" as possible pathway steps and to systematically establish causal relationships between key events, the MoA must ensure the importance of setting quantitative parameters. In this regard, the MoA is distinguished from the mechanism of action, the latter being a more detailed description of pathways involving molecular interactions [16] . The MoA has generally been updated to accommodate insights into the pathway-based approach to risk assessment, where MoA and AOP are conceptually similar, but MoA does not necessarily imply toxic expression (e.g., effect as drugs) [16] .",

Of the many reports in the burgeoning field of predictive toxicology, the US NRC's \"21st Century Toxicity Testing: Vision and Strategy\" attracted considerable attention and discussed the need for a paradigm shift in the assessment of the hazards and risks of chemicals [4, 11, [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] . The NRC report plans to change the current way of conducting toxicological tests, which are based on animal phenotypes, with techniques that are increasingly dependent on understanding the molecular mechanisms of toxicity in human cells and tissues. The transition to more mechanistic hazard assessment is the \"high-throughput screening (HTS) and high-content screening (HCS)\" in mammalian (especially human) cell lines and/or tissue cultures. This implies the use of in vitro tests based on various calculations for data analysis and interactions between toxicity and molecular targets, side effects, and outcomes. The general premise of AOP technology means that there are sufficient events to explain biological pathways and to predict toxic pathways at different levels of biological tissue (cells, tissues/organs, organisms, populations). A basic understanding of molecular interactions and effects should be able to predict the side effects of organisms and populations.",

[11] adverse outcome pathway is a \"causal, mechanical, inferential, or correlated relationship.\" It is a flexible technology that can include infrastructure-based connections, and the information on which they are based can include both mechanisms and MoA in vitro, in vivo, or computational systems. Adverse outcome pathway describes an MIE that occurs at the onset of chemical exposure, beginning with the interaction between the biomolecule (e.g., proteins, receptors, etc.) and the molecule and subsequently health in cells and in humans. All types of information can be integrated from the molecular level to the individual level to predict hazard consequences and provide biological arguments (or a set of hypotheses), including individual toxicity levels for hazards or environmental hazards. The Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), and the European Commission (EC) joint research centers have developed a chemical knowledgebased toxicity pathway (AOP-KB), and the AOP-KB has attracted the interest and participation of stakeholders, including government, academia, and industry, in that it provides a point of contact with academic research achievements that can be directly linked to government chemical regulation. The concept of AOP is useful for developing predictive toxicity tools, and even short-term imperfect AOPs can show the relationship between chemicals and risk. The certainty of interpretation between existing and new information can be increased, and it can be used as an integrated test strategy to maximize that certainty [22] .",

Medium impact DB processes chemical information and describes how chemicals cause MIE or KE. AOP Xplorer is a calculation tool for mapping AOP. Intermediate DB and AOP Xplorer are currently in development, and all four systems share information through the AOP-KB hub. Since each element of AOP-KB is individually arranged, AOP-KB is useful for the development of AOP and is applied from various studies [13] . The OECD provides comprehensive management of AOP development and evaluation [6] and is overseen by the OECD extended advisory group on molecular screening and toxicogenomics (EAGMST). The AOP-Wiki is administered by the Toxic Pathology Society, in accordance with the OECD extended advisory group on molecular screening and toxicogenomics guidelines [23] . Since the OECD published its first AOP, \"Skin sensitization pathways initiated by covalent bonds to proteins,\" several reports and guidance on AOP have been published, and the OECD provides eight AOP-related publications. As of August 2018, the AOP development program workbook lists 60 projects [24].",

Given the complexity of the ACD, a single alternative cannot replace LLNA, but integrated testing strategies (ITS) can be used to gather important information about molecular mechanisms related to skin sensitivity and to understand the molecular process of the ACD. A systematic review of in vivo studies has been carried out, and an ACD molecular map is prepared. Also, limited comparisons of toxic genomes in humans and mice have revealed similarities, although additional data are needed to identify subtle differences. For insight into the molecular mechanisms represented by various in vitro systems, comparative analysis with in vitro toxicogenomic data can be used to compare new molecular in vitro methods, in addition to mathematical predictability. In addition, new classifications by in silico, in chemico, and in vitro methods can be complemented by immobilizing AOP and ACD molecular maps, thus laying the foundation for developing test strategies that accurately reflect key events of skin sensitivity [28] . Many of these case studies have shown ways to inform AOP development in chemical hazard assessment [29] . AOP technology provides a means of organizing and sharing knowledge of the mechanisms of chemical toxicity, including quantitative structure-activity relationships (QSAR) based on chemical and computational, in vitro, and integrated testing strategies, including toxicologically relevant readings. It comprises an explanatory method or integrated approaches to testing and assessment (IATA) that can be used as the basis for predictive techniques. The recently published OECD guideline provides guidance on what information is needed to identify and document AOP in terms of relevance and suitability [30] .",

AOP can be used to reasonably combine mechanical knowledge related to toxicity by nanomaterials to fill data gaps and develop toxicological testing strategies, captured by AOPs selected for chemical-induced toxicity.

The predicted value of these in vitro tests is partially associated with mechanisms that contribute to their toxicity. Numerous adverse effects on fabricated nanomaterials, such as multi-walled carbon nanotubes due to changes in the dielectric, have been identified, one of which has recently been evaluated as carcinogenic. It is currently being used as a state-of-theart strategy for analyzing genome effects from exposure to manufactured nanomaterials, focusing on lung disease [32] .

Two-year carcinogenicity studies, clinical chemistry, and histopathological endpoints in rodents have been considered the \"gold standard\" for detecting substance-induced toxicity in animal models, but genome-wide expression analysis and in vivo high-throughput testing (HTS) are increasing.

Thus, the field can explore ways to use multiple processes of chemical knowledge to help further definition, classification, characterization, and hazard assessment and suggests the role of MIE research in the development of in vitro and in silico toxicology; studies are underway to identify and characterize MIE by a combination of chemical approaches [51] .",

At the same time, biomarkers for developing preclinical endpoints that indicate the risk of death associated with a future disease or impaired lung function can also be derived from AOP [53] [54] [55] [56] . In many studies, it is important to determine whether subsequent events, such as increased ROS levels compared to fresh air, include AOP-based EGFR activation and downstream signaling. AOP is a key combination of appropriate in vitro models and tests. It can provide a framework for the systematic assessment of events (KE).

In vivo and in vitro data should be supplemented with human data collected from occupational health and molecular epidemiological studies. Research needs to be designed to provide as much information as possible about the relationship between genetic and epigenetic mutations and toxic pathways. In addition, attention should be paid to ethical, legal, social, and political impacts when genetic and epigenetic (epigenomic) data are used for occupational health issues.

Although there are few QSAR models currently available for predicting inhalation toxicity, the applicability areas of QSAR (e.g., TopKAT and MultiCASE) are examined to determine whether a model can be optimized for occupational toxicity prediction. It is necessary to identify the differences between the advantages of existing models and to clarify which models can be used for specific applications. Also, new models can be developed using data collected from other sources, and the US EPA Center for computational toxicology (https ://compt ox.epa.gov/dashb oard/) is a convenient platform to accommodate available models and their predictions [71] . It is important to carefully assess the variability associated with in vivo data that rely on developing new models to quantify the uncertainty associated with model prediction, and best practice protocols are being developed in in silico methods involving various endpoints [76] . There are also a number of AOPs involved in exposure, but additional AOPs need to develop specific toxic expressions that may occur with inhalation exposure. This will be useful for the ongoing construction of AOP on mechanisms of inhalation toxicity. AOP development can be used for the likelihood of causing specific toxicity and to establish confidence in in vitro tests characterizing key events (KEs). For example, each researcher should also be encouraged to work with an AOP expert to bridge the gap between AOP development and knowledge, by providing an interactive virtual platform for AOP using an AOP-Wiki designed to create international consensus on the developed AOP. Many systems can be used for the evaluation of inhalable toxicants, but cell-based systems also need to be specific for their ability to metabolize compounds. In particular, three-dimensional (3D) tissue and lung-on-a-chip models are believed to represent human characteristics, but should be developed as a standardized test protocol to maintain consistency between laboratories.",

Experts with a variety of expertise (in vitro, in vivo inhalation toxicity, computational modeling, exposure science, etc.) should work together to design this approach. A key step in this process is proof-of-concept testing that focuses on specific chemicals, such as industrial and environmental toxicants, pesticides, tobacco, or pharmaceuticals, and is useful in describing key events in the pathogenesis for a particular AOP. The development and implementation of non-animal assays for inhalation toxicity testing and the acceptance of global regulations require cooperation between various stakeholders, and the International Science Consortium and the NTP Interagency Center for the Evaluation of Alternative Toxicological Methods (NICEATM) have formed a working group. Researchers' participation is encouraged in these activities. The success in this area will develop platforms that can predict mortality and preventive effects from inhalation exposure, and these new techniques will lead to a better understanding of toxic mechanisms, without the use of animals, unleashing the potential of protecting workers' health for science of the twenty-first century.",

The goal of AOP is to accurately predict the toxicity of chemicals, by serving as an alternative to traditional chemical risk assessment. First introduced for ecological toxicity, AOP is now widely used in chemical assessments. The AOP, which is applied to inhalation toxicity especially carcinogenicity assessment, will be a tool to understand the effects of the use of chemicals in the workplace and the chronic exposure of the workers involved and make their predictions very useful. Based on this forecasting tool, it is expected to bring dramatic advances in occupational and environmental cancer prevention.",
