In man, S. typhimurium infection usually leads to a self\u2010limiting gastroenteritis. However, in susceptible mouse strains this bacterium provokes a typhoid\u2010like disease, very similar to the typhoid fever caused in humans by the closely related S. enterica serovar typhi\n1, 2, 3.

It enters the human body by infecting microfold (M) cells, which are specialized epithelial cells in the intestinal tract, or by infecting other intestinal epithelial cells. Once the epithelial barrier has been passed, they can infect macrophages, adjacent to the epithelial layer 4, 5. Salmonella can also enter the bloodstream when they are taken up by dendritic cells that are present at the basolateral side of the intestinal epithelium 6. The infection of epithelial cells is a crucial step in Salmonella infection. The bacterium invades this type of cells by inducing its own uptake. For this purpose it employs a specialized secretion apparatus, called a type three secretion system (T3SS).",

            "text": "The S. typhimurium genome encodes two T3SSs that can translocate a large number of effector proteins from the bacterium into the cytosol of a host cell 7, 8, 9, 10, 11. These effector proteins modify host cell functions to the benefit of the bacterium. The T3SSs are encoded by the Salmonella pathogenicity islands 1 and 2 (SPI\u20101 and SPI\u20102; for reviews, see 7, 8, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16). To enable Salmonella's invasion of epithelial cells, the SPI\u20101\u2010encoded T3SS of the bacterium translocates effectors across the plasma membrane of the epithelial cell. Among others, these effectors cause actin rearrangements, which induce ruffling of host cell's plasma membrane and uptake of the Salmonella by macropinocytosis 17, 18, 19, 20. Once inside the host cell, the bacterium resides in a so\u2010called Salmonella\u2010containing vacuole (SCV). The SPI\u20102\u2010encoded T3SS, T3SS\u20102, translocates effector proteins across the membrane of the SCV into host cell's cytoplasm to promote intracellular survival and replication of Salmonella. In order for Salmonella to replicate, the SCV moves to the perinuclear region where it becomes surrounded by membranes of the Golgi apparatus. During the migration to the Golgi region, the SCV matures and recruits several markers from the endo/lysosomal system by interacting with the endocytic and secretory pathway (for extensive reviews on SCV maturation and biogenesis, see 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26). Three T3SS\u20102 effectors, SifA, SseF and SseG, were shown to be important for the maintenance of the SCV in the Golgi region 27, 28, 29, 30. Although there is no evidence for a direct contact between Salmonella and the Golgi apparatus, it has been shown that intact Golgi membranes are required for efficient Salmonella replication. Drug\u2010induced disruption of the Golgi apparatus has been demonstrated to decrease Salmonella replication 29. In addition to positioning itself in the Golgi region during replication, S. typhimurium can also redirect host secretory traffic. This results in the accumulation of exocytic cargo vesicles (post\u2010Golgi vesicles) in close proximity of the SCV 31. Thus, during infection, Salmonella interacts with the host cell secretory pathway in several ways. However, the details of these interactions and the host proteins involved are largely unknown. Insight into the interplay between Salmonella and the host is important for our understanding of Salmonella infection.",

Subsequently, the cells were incubated with the primary antibodies targeting the Golgi marker GM130 (anti\u2010GM130, 1:400, BD Transduction Laboratories) or the lipopolysaccharide of Salmonella (anti\u2010LPS, 1:400, Abcam) in BB for 60 min at room temperature. Cells were washed thoroughly with PBS and incubated with the secondary antibodies (goat\u2010anti\u2010mouse or goat\u2010anti\u2010rabbit antibodies conjugated with Alexa dyes 488 or 568; all from Invitrogen) for another 60 min at room temperature. After this incubation step, cells were washed three times with PBS, mounted on glass slides using FluorSave reagent (Calbiochem) and analyzed on a confocal microscope (Leica TCS Sp2 CLSM). For quantification of two different microcolony phenotypes (tight and dispersed), three independent experiments were performed in which 100 cells were counted per condition. We scored a microcolony as being dispersed when the percentage of open space within the microcolony area was higher than 75%.",

Detailed insight into Salmonella\u2013host interactions is important for our understanding of Salmonella infection and may also lead to new possibilities for therapeutic intervention. In a previous report 33 we applied SILAC\u2010based quantitative proteomics to investigate coronavirus\u2013host interactions. In this study, we used the same approach to study Salmonella infection in epithelial cells. Because of the known role of the secretory pathway, and more specifically the Golgi apparatus, in the infection cycle of Salmonella, we focused our attention on isolated Golgi\u2010enriched fractions. We compared protein abundances in these fractions isolated from Salmonella\u2010 and mock\u2010infected HeLa cells. We identified 105 proteins that changed in abundance in the Golgi\u2010enriched fractions upon Salmonella infection.

Proteins annotated to be localized to several cellular compartments were found in the Golgi\u2010enriched fraction. This is not unexpected as our Golgi isolation procedure is based on established protocols that show a maximal 52\u2010fold enrichment of Golgi markers, with a 1\u20134\u2010fold enrichment of protein markers from other organelles 35, 36, 37. Of note, proteins localizing primarily in other organelles than the Golgi may very well also be present in the Golgi, albeit at lower levels. We identified 765 proteins in the Golgi\u2010enriched fraction from which 105 were affected upon Salmonella infection. From Figs. 2 and 3 it is clear that Salmonella infection affected proteins from several different groups. Proteins predicted to associate with the cytoskeleton/annotated to the CYT function group (Figs. 2 and 3) were consistently affected. This is in agreement with several reports showing that Salmonella infection affects the cytoskeleton during entry and movement to the Golgi region in order to establish a replicating niche 17, 28, 46, 47, 48. Some of the affected CYT proteins in the Golgi\u2010enriched fraction were increased in abundance, whereas others were decreased. It remains to be established whether a change in the location of a cytoskeleton\u2010associated protein is initiated either by Salmonella to promote its replication, or by the host cell to elicit an immune response. In addition, proteins annotated to the membrane traffic group, mainly predicted to localize to the Golgi apparatus/endosomes, were consistently affected upon Salmonella infection. The majority of those proteins were depleted from the Golgi fraction upon Salmonella infection. The depletion of these affected proteins from the Golgi region upon Salmonella infection might be the result of relocation of these proteins away from the Golgi either induced by the bacterium for its own benefit or by the host cell as a defense mechanism. Our preliminary data (RT\u2010PCR analysis of mRNA levels in uninfected vs infected cells) indicated that the affected proteins are not down regulated, suggesting that the change in their abundance in the Golgi more likely results from altered membrane dynamics/protein relocation than from altered protein degradation/altered gene expression (data not shown). These data were confirmed by comparison of protein levels (STOM, TBC1D10B and PRDX6) in PNS of uninfected versus infected cells using Western blot analysis (Fig. 5). The results showed that at least for STOM, TBC1D10B and PRDX6 the cellular protein expression level did not change upon infection and suggest that relocation of these proteins is a likely cause of depletion or enrichment in the Golgi\u2010enrieched fraction. As a (loading) control for this experiment, antibodies recognizing G\u03b1G\u03b2 and \u03b2\u2010actin were used. As can be seen in Fig. 5, the signal for these proteins is the same in uninfected and infected PNS.",

In addition to the effect of these five proteins on Salmonella replication, depletion of STOM or ITGB4 resulted in a dispersal of the Salmonella microcolony (Fig. 6). This is an interesting phenotype, although with our present knowledge, hard to explain. Efficient Salmonella replication in epithelial cells is known to be dependent on tight microcolonies that are surrounded by intact Golgi membranes. Dispersed microcolonies were shown to result in decreased replication by others before 29. However, in our case, cells that are depleted of STOM or ITGB4, show an increased Salmonella replication, despite of (or because of) dispersed microcolonies. This interesting phenotype is currently subject of further investigation.",

Despite the difference in the effect of infection on the abundance in the Golgi fraction of PRDX6 on the one hand, and that of the other four proteins on the other hand, depletion of each of the five proteins by siRNA led to increased Salmonella replication. Although at first sight this may look like a discrepancy, it should be kept in mind that the siRNA treatment leads to depletion of the respective proteins in the whole cell, whereas the changes in abundance upon infection in our assay system were observed in isolated Golgi fractions. Moreover, with our current knowledge we cannot say whether the effects on the abundance of the five proteins seen in the Golgi fraction reflect changes initiated by the Salmonella to promote its own replication or changes initiated by the host cell to inhibit Salmonella replication. This may, of course, differ for the various proteins.",

Recently, another report has shown that PRDX6 can be translocated to the plasma membrane where its PLA2 activity can be activated 53. A function of PRDX6 in Salmonella infection has not been described, but as the SCV has several interactions with the endo/lysosomal pathway during maturation, PRDX6 might as well be involved in those interactions. Furthermore, PRDX6 might also interfere with the oxidative stress response that is induced by the host cell upon Salmonella infection.",

They also transduce signals that regulate gene expression and cell growth. Integrins are composed of different combinations of \u03b1 and \u03b2 subunits that differ in their ligand binding specificity. The role of ITGB4 in Salmonella infection has not been elucidated so far. Interestingly, ITGB4 has been shown to bind to ERBB2IP (a.k.a. ERBIN and LAP2 54) that was also found in our screen. Members of the LAP (leucine\u2010rich repeats and PDZ domains) family of proteins are involved in maintaining the shape and apical\u2010basal polarity of epithelial cells 55. ERBB2IP has been found to bind to Nod2 in epithelial cells infected with Shigella flexneri\n56. Nod2 is a member of the NACHT\u2010LRR proteins (NLRs) that can sense bacterial components in order to elicit an immune response 57. It is localized to the cell membrane and this localization is important for its bacterium\u2010sensing function 58. Kufer et al. 56 showed that ERBB2IP and Nod2 partially co\u2010localize at the cell membrane and at the entry foci during infection with Shigella. It was furthermore shown that ERBB2IP acts as a negative regulator of Nod2 signaling 59. The decreased amount of ERBB2IP in the Golgi fraction isolated from HeLa cells infected by Salmonella may reflect a relocation of ERBB2IP, resulting in changed dynamics of the Nod2/ERBB2IP complex. This was also shown in Shigella infection 52 although the biological relevance of this observation remains to be established.",

Smith et al. 61 studied the association of various Rabs with SCVs that either contain wt Salmonella or a non\u2010invasive Salmonella mutant that travels to late endocytic compartments (considered the model phagosome). Eighteen Rabs were found to be associated with the maturing SCV. Rab35 was not present on wt SCVs but was associated with the model phagosomes, which suggests a role for Rab35 in phagosome maturation 61. Since TBC1D10B was depleted from our Golgi fraction upon Salmonella infection, this may suggest an affected Rab35 activation and thereby an affected SCV maturation.",
