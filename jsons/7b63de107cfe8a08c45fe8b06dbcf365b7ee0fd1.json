A similar effect was observed with the amiodarone-related agent dronedarone and the L-type calcium channel blocker verapamil. Inhibition by amiodarone was concentration dependent and similarly affected pseudoviruses as well as authentic filoviruses. Inhibition of filovirus entry was observed with most but not all cell types tested and was accentuated by the pre-treatment of cells, indicating a host cell-directed mechanism of action. The New World arenavirus Guanarito was also inhibited by amiodarone while the Old World arenavirus Lassa and members of the Rhabdoviridae (vesicular stomatitis virus) and Bunyaviridae (Hantaan) families were largely resistant.",

These include the folate receptor, 10 members of the Tyro3 family of receptor tyrosine kinases (Axl, Dtk, Mer) 11 and T cell immunoglobulin and mucin domain 1, 12 although the relevance of the folate receptor for filovirus entry was later disputed. 13, 14 In addition, numerous C-type lectins, calcium-dependent carbohydratebinding molecules, including the asialoglycoprotein receptor, 15 DC-SIGN and DC-SIGNR, 16, 17 human macrophage galactose-type C-type lectin 18 and liver and lymph node sinusoidal endothelial cell C-type lectin 19 have been reported to interact with GP 1 and promote filovirus entry.",

            "text": "Following host cell binding, filoviruses are taken up into the cell most likely through macropinocytosis. 20, 21 The low pH-dependent cathepsin B/L-mediated cleavage of filovirus GP is then required for fusion with a late endosomal membrane. 22 In addition, the endosomal cholesterol transporter Niemann -Pick C1 (NPC1) acts as an essential intracellular receptor. 23, 24 This intricate multistep route of viral entry is likely to require some form of coordination, which may take advantage of cellular signalling, as has been shown for coxsackie group B viruses 25 and hepatitis C virus. 26 Indeed, the phosphoinositide-3 kinase/Akt pathway as well as protein kinase C and small cellular GTPases have been implicated in filovirus entry. 27 Although (as discussed below) several experimental antifiloviral approaches have been reported, no vaccine or specific antiviral treatment has yet been established. Given low case numbers and geographical restriction to resource-limited regions, industry-sustained drug development programmes are unlikely. Nonetheless, there is a clear unmet clinical need from naturally occurring cases as well as an additional potential need given that filoviruses are considered to be CDC category A bioterrorism agents (www.bt.cdc.gov/bioterrorism). Given the complex filoviral route of entry, we hypothesized that drugs which perturb cellular signalling networks and are approved for other indications might also interfere with filovirus entry. We performed a small-scale screen and found that amiodarone, a multi-ion channel inhibitor used clinically as an anti-arrhythmic agent, acts as a potent and specific inhibitor of filoviral cell entry. The concentrations of amiodarone that are required for filovirus inhibition are well within the range that is achieved in serum during anti-arrhythmic therapy in humans, i.e. 1.5 -2.5 mg/mL. 28",

There was a clear concentration-dependent reduction in the percentage of NP-positive cells while the overall cell number was unchanged ( Figure S1 , available as Supplementary data at JAC Online). Significant inhibition was observed at amiodarone concentrations of 0.5 mg/mL or higher ( Figure 3 ). On averaging all the experiments performed, the IC 50 was 0.25 mg/mL, corresponding to a calculated therapeutic index of above 50.

Among a broader range of human pathogenic enveloped viruses that enter target cells through endocytosis and in a pH-dependent manner, we observed a significant inhibition of pseudoviruses bearing the GP of the New World arenavirus Guanarito (Figure 4b ). VSV-G-(Rhabdoviridae family), Lassa virus GP-(Old World arenavirus) and Hantaan (Bunyaviridae family) virus GP-pseudotyped lentiviruses were affected to a lesser extent.

Dronedarone, a newer drug with a pharmacodynamic profile similar to amiodarone, showed a marked concentration-dependent inhibition of MARV and EBOV GP-bearing pseudoparticles similar to amiodarone (Figure 7a ). The L-type calcium channel blocker verapamil similarly inhibited filovirus GP-mediated entry, although higher absolute and molar concentrations were required (Figure 7b) . Conversely, the selective T-type calcium channel blocker ethosuximide had no effect. The sodium channel blocker lidocaine, the b 1 -selective adrenoreceptor antagonist metoprolol, and the nonselective b-blocker and potassium channel blocker sotalol were also without detectable effects (Figure 7c ). Drug concentrations were chosen based on plasma levels reported to be achievable in humans. Relevant toxicity or anti-proliferative effects at the concentrations used were excluded using an EAhy cell line stably expressing a luciferase reporter ( Figure S4 , available as Supplementary data at JAC Online).

Mortality is very high in resource-poor settings, and even when modern intensive care is available, treatment is Amiodarone inhibits filovirus entry 2127 JAC challenging. 43 Several potential approaches have been suggested based on in vitro or animal data. These include monoclonal antibodies isolated from survivors, 44 lipid-stabilized small-interfering RNAs directed against viral genes 45 and a recombinant VSV-based vaccine. 46 However, it will be difficult to transfer these highly experimental approaches into routine clinical care. Very recently, the oestrogen receptor modulator clomiphene, which is licensed for ovarian stimulation in humans, has been reported to inhibit filovirus infection, possibly by perturbing the role of NPC1 in filoviral entry. 47, 48 Amiodarone is available both as an oral and an intravenous formulation and has been used for decades for both the long-term and short-term treatment of cardiac arrhythmias. As a generic drug, its use would be feasible in both resource-rich and resource-poor settings. It is known to have a narrow therapeutic window, but serum levels to treat cardiac arrhythmias are in the range of 1.5 -2.5 mg/mL, which is 6-to 10-fold above the in vitro IC 50 we observed for authentic filoviruses. 28 The known side effects of amiodarone (which include ocular and pulmonary toxicity, thyroid dysfunction and pro-arrhythmic effects) are generally manageable, especially in the short term. Importantly, they would clearly be acceptable if the drug at the same time increased the odds of survival in the setting of acute filoviral haemorrhagic fever. Given that filoviral haemorrhagic fever involves the spread of infection to a broad range of cells and tissues, it is plausible that a potent entry inhibitor would limit systemic spread and hence might reduce mortality. However, clinical studies would be needed to determine this. At this point, we do not know the exact mechanism by which amiodarone and the other anti-arrhythmic agents studied inhibit filoviral cell entry. Several observations suggest that amiodarone acts on the host cell rather than the incoming virion: (i) preincubation of target cells with the drug also had an inhibitory effect on MARV; (ii) the most pronounced effect was seen when the drug was present before and during infection; and (iii) the inhibitory effect was cell type dependent in the sense that it was detectable to a variable extent on most cell types tested, with the notable exception of primary human hepatocytes. However, there was also a trend to reduced infectivity when pseudoviruses were pre-treated with amiodarone and then washed before being added to the target cell. This might suggest that either we were unable to completely separate the drug from the virus or that amiodarone inhibition requires some form of ternary interaction between drug, filovirus and host cell.",

Since both are thought to enter target cells via the late endosome, this would be consistent with an amiodaronemediated perturbation of this compartment. 22, 51, 52 Indeed Shoemaker et al. have reported that clomiphene and other related inhibitors of filoviral entry they have identified have in common that they are cationic amphiphiles causing a Niemann -Pick-like accumulation of cholesterol in the endosomes. 47 This could be due to inhibition of acid sphingomyelinase by a broad range of cationic amphiphiles. 53 Amiodarone, dronedarone and verapamil, with pKa values of 8. 5, 9.8 and 8.8, respectively, 49,54 all fit into that category. Moreover, entry through late endosomes has also been suggested for hantaviruses, one of which was modestly inhibited by amiodarone in our research. 55 In a different study, an inhibitory effect of very high concentrations of amiodarone on severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus was reported. 50 That paper suggests that the inhibition of infection occurs after fusion of the viral envelope with the late endosomal membrane and delivery of the viral genome to the cytosol. Since a block at a post-fusion step would be expected to affect all pseudoviruses equally, this does not explain our observation that some pseudoviruses are inhibited by amiodarone while others are not.",
