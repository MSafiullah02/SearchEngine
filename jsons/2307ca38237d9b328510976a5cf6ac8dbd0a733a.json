During the initial preparation of this article, a novel coronavirus causing disease in humans was emerging at the humananimal interface in China.

The World Health Organization recently coined this term to represent uncertainty as a critical planning element in preparedness for a serious international epidemic and specifically to encourage preparedness activities that account for uncertainty. 1 There are many sources of uncertainty that are essentially the \"who, what, when, where, why, and how\" characteristics of a public health emergency. The \"who\" might be unexpected at-risk groups, such as persons with obesity who developed severe illness during the 2009 H1N1 influenza pandemic. 2 The \"what\" could be unexpected outcomes such as microcephaly in infants born to mothers with Zika virus infection during pregnancy. 3 The \"where\" could be an unexpected location for disease emergence, such as the H1N1 pandemic influenza that began in North America, rather than Asia, as had been anticipated and planned for. 4 Finally, in the event of an unknown pathogen such as SARS in 2003 and now with COVID-19, the outbreak response must run parallel with a rapid gathering of international evidence (clinical, laboratory, epidemiological, etc), meaning that the level of uncertainty is dynamic and the response will need to be adjusted as and when we know more.",

They give responders an indication of what real-time data to collect, or what to watch for, to either validate the planning assumptions or signal that a change in approach is needed. For example, an assumption used in influenza pandemic planning posits that the novel influenza virus will be transmitted from person to person in the same way seasonal influenza is transmitted. Healthcare providers will thus know what Infection Prevention and Control (IPC) precautions to utilize, which builds confidence in responders when dealing with unknowns. This starting point also helps to inform how IPC measures can be scaled up or down if reality proves to be different from the planning assumption. Therefore, assumptions are a foundational component for the development of preparedness and response plans and essential for incorporating flexibility.",

To manage demands and risks by scaling up (eg, adding more resources, enhancing active surveillance activities) or scaling down when there is evidence to indicate that specific response actions are no longer needed to achieve response objectives. A key lesson learned from past responses is that uncertainty and/or risk aversion can lead to overcompensation during a response (eg, inappropriate use of limited resources, responder burnout, or angst when trying to de-escalate). Overcompensation can be avoided by ensuring there is sufficient content in guidance, plans, and emergency exercises to demonstrate how and when the response will be scaled up or down based on risk assessments and specific data analyses that build confidence and reduce risk aversion.",

Specifically, this involves making an assessment of current resources available to mitigate and respond to the risk. Assumptions can be used as a starting point to create scenarios against which risks and capabilities can be identified and assessed. For example, a planning scenario might include a person who presents to the emergency department complaining of nausea, weakness, and fever. To prepare for uncertainty, planners must consider variables in the scenario. For example, if this person had recently returned from a country with an ongoing Ebola outbreak, would the existing triage system be sufficient to identify, assess, and rapidly contain a possible Ebola case? This type of assessment helps identify specific risks, such as not including Ebola in the intake differential diagnosis for ill travellers returning from an affected area. Likewise, scenarios can facilitate a discussion regarding what capabilities are currently in place to mitigate this risk.",

It was only learned later that the patient had been exposed to the true index case, who did have a significant travel history but was not seen in a healthcare setting. 5, 6 This flagged a gap in our risk mitigation-that the capability to rapidly identify, and therefore contain, a SARS case that had no travel history was lacking. To close this gap, triage questions also needed to include questions about close contact with an ill traveller.",

Built on an infectious disease outbreak response model, this network can potentially be leveraged for rapid mortality surveillance for emerging health events beyond opioids. There are also international efforts underway to invest in platform technologies for vaccines and therapeutics that can be adapted to target new pathogens once they are identified. 9 Utilizing sustainable, flexible governance structures and resources ensures the response system is well exercised and able to adapt to uncertainties, while supporting readiness for other health threats and emergencies.",
