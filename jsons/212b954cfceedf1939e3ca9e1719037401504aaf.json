Another challenge is to include a nonpneumonia group that may help to better comprehend the respiratory infection in children as some studies have shown that rhinovirus and ADV detections are usual even among children without pneumonia. 18 It may be that these viruses cause minimal or mild disease, but depending on the subtype or the combination with bacterial or viral coinfections may result in CAP or severe CAP. This hypothesis follows observations of detection of viruses in the nasopharynx of children in the absence of clinical signs and symptoms. 47 This is the first study conducted in a city in the Brazilian pre-Amazon region to identify viruses in children with CAP.

This disagreement suggests that new studies with higher numbers of subjects are necessary to resolve the relevance of gender as a risk factor. The risk factors, eg, domestic environment and nutrition, are crucial to set the course of infection. However, the etiology of infection constitutes the fundamental basis of CAP development. In despite its high prevalence, few others have tested for this pathogen. 18-21 Liu et al 22 mentioned the importance of investigating the presence of rhinovirus in samples from patients with a respiratory infection, reporting that they considered including it in their study.", "latex": null, "type": "table"}, "TABREF2": {"text": "with single viral infections. However, other studies have suggested that viral coinfections do not result in more severe respiratory manifestations.35,36 Several factors including viral seasonality and pathogenicity, differences in detection methods, and viral interference might explain that conflicting information.37 In the viral coinfections observed in our study, Rhinovirus/RSV was the most common combination. Jiang et al38 observed similar results, showing that 48.6% of viral infections were Rhinovirus/RSV codetected infections. Likewise, Asner et al 39 showed that among 77 children with ARI and viral infection, 16.9% (12 of 77) were children with Rhinovirus/RSV codetected.It is also necessary to highlight that the environment directly influence the severity of the manifestations, the virus species, and the coinfections. Multiple studies have reported that climatic variations influence both the etiology and frequency of CAP hospitalizations.40,41 In this context, it is relevant to note that the city of S\u00e3o Lu\u00eds, MA has two distinct climates: one rainy season from January to June and one dry season from July to December. In this study, was observed no seasonality for rhinovirus infections.Morikawa et al 42 primarily detected HRV type C in winter, whereas type A rhinovirus was detected throughout the year. This study did not assess all rhinovirus types, which may produce its occurrence throughout the year in the population studied.FluA was only detected in the rain season. These data agree with the data of Nascimento-Carvalho et al41 who found a predominance of influenza during the rainy, summer, and fall seasons, in the city of Salvador, Brazil. On the other hand, Caini et al 43 demonstrated that influenza cases peaked between June and September (dry season), in countries of the Southern hemisphere, including south and southeast Brazil. Regarding the seasonality of RSV, Bouzas et al 44 analyzed the incidence of RSV associated with seasonal distribution in the city of Salvador, Brazil. They observed the prevalence of RSV group A genotype in the dry seasons and, on the other hand, the higher incidence RSV group B genotype in the rainy season. These results agreed with ours. Understanding the seasonality associated with these pathogens is fundamental for developing seasonal strategiesfor prevention and treatment.45 Currently, there are few available antiviral medications for the treatment of CAP; and only vaccines are available against influenza and ADV.46", "latex": null, "type": "table"}}, "back_matter": []}
