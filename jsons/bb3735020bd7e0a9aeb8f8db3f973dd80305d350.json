LAIV infection led to transiently increased pneumococcal acquisition at day 2 (60.0% and 40.3%, as detected by molecular methods, in LAIV groups and control groups, respectively) 14 . LAIV also increased S. pneumoniae carriage load in the first 14 days following pneumococcal inoculation 14 (Supplementary Fig. 1 ). We collected a series of nasal microbiopsies and nasal lining fluid throughout the study to assess ongoing cellular and cytokine responses. Participants were grouped into those who did not become colonized following S. pneumoniae challenge (carriage \u2212 ) and those who did (carriage + ), as determined by classical microbiology (Fig. 1a) . To investigate whether LAIV-induced immune responses were associated with a predisposition to pneumococcal carriage, we measured the concentrations of 30 cytokines and of proteins, including interleukin 1 receptor antagonist (IL-1RA), in nasal lining fluid (Fig. 1b) . After multiple-testing correction, we found that at day 0, directly prior to S. pneumoniae inoculation, LAIV significantly increased concentrations of 20 cytokines, including CXCL10 (IP-10), tumor-necrosis factor (TNF), interleukin 10 (IL-10), IFN-\u03b3 and IL-15 ( Fig. 1b and Supplementary Table 1 ). In contrast, the control group did not show any significant increase in cytokine response at day 0. Following S. pneumoniae inoculation, S. pneumoniae carriage in the absence of LAIV was associated with increased concentration of epidermal growth factor at day 2 and decreased concentration of IL-1RA at day 9 after S. pneumoniae inoculation (compared with that at baseline), neither of which remained significant after multiple-testing correction. No other cytokines, including IL-17A or CCL2, were significantly altered by carriage alone (Fig. 1b) .",

In particular, IL-10 was significantly increased in LAIV-vaccinated subjects who did not acquire S. pneumoniae following inoculation (5.8-fold increase), but not in those who became carriers following inoculation (2.0-fold increase). In contrast, CXCL10 was significantly increased in subjects who went on to become carriers (2.4-fold increase), but not in those who remained carriage-negative (1.5fold increase). Moreover, subjects with increased concentrations of CXCL10 before inoculation displayed higher pneumococcal load following S. pneumoniae inoculation (Fig. 1d ). This suggests that differences in the response to influenza virus are associated with secondary susceptibility to S. pneumoniae. To test whether this was specific for LAIV infection, we measured CXCL10 in nasal washes and TIGIT counts on sorted neutrophils before LAIV or in control arm (n = 6, red) and following LAIV (n = 4, blue).

These comprised infections with rhinovirus (n = 12), coronavirus (n = 5), respiratory syncytial virus (n = 2) and parainfluenzavirus (n = 1) 29 . The predominant virus, rhinovirus, was recently shown to associate with increased pneumococcal acquisition and transmission 30 . In these virus-infected subjects, CXCL10 concentration was increased ( Supplementary Fig. 2) , and baseline CXCL10 concentration correlated with increased pneumococcal load also in this second cohort (Fig. 1e) . Unfortunately, sample sizes were too small to further investigate in depth the effects of infection with the different viruses, which are likely to have divergent consequences. Although the correlation was modest in this validation cohort, suggesting that other host and environmental factors are involved, we identified a biomarker, CXCL10, that was predictive of S. pneumoniae load.",

            "text": "We observed pre-existing high numbers of neutrophils in the human nasal lining, and pneumococcal carriage did not lead to significant further recruitment of neutrophils ( Supplementary Fig. 3a ,b). To investigate whether luminal neutrophils were involved in the early control of carriage, we measured concentrations of myeloperoxidase, a marker for neutrophil degranulation 31 , in nasal washes. Concentrations were increased (2.2-fold) at 2 days after challenge in control carriage + but not carriage \u2212 individuals (Fig. 2a) . This neutrophil activation was impaired in the LAIV group, who displayed high carriage load during early carriage and had increased acquisition compared with that of controls. Together, these findings suggest that neutrophil degranulation is important for the initial control of carriage. To investigate whether neutrophils were also impaired systemically following LAIV, as reported during wild-type influenza infection 32 , we isolated blood neutrophils before, and at 3 days after, LAIV administration from a subset of subjects. We confirmed that opsonophagocytic killing (OPK) of S. pneumoniae by blood neutrophils was decreased following LAIV (Fig. 2b ). This effect could be mimicked by the addition of TNF, but not CXCL10, to neutrophils from healthy donors in vitro, decreasing killing capacity in a dosedependent manner (Fig. 2c,d) . NanoString expression analysis of 594 genes revealed ten differentially expressed genes in blood neutrophils 3 days post-LAIV (Supplementary Table 2 ). Among those were the genes encoding MAP4K2 (mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase kinase kinase 2; 3.2-fold increase), which acts on the TNF signal-transduction pathway 33 , and the co-inhibitory receptor TIGIT (T cell immunoreceptor with immunoglobulin and ITIM domains; 3.6-fold increase; Fig. 2e ). TIGIT expression levels were also negatively correlated with neutrophil killing capacity (r = \u2212 0.73; Fig. 2f ). TIGIT is an immunological checkpoint protein that has been described to promote regulatory T cell function 34 , but its expression on neutrophils has not been previously appreciated, to our knowledge. Incubation of whole blood with recombinant TNF increased TIGIT levels on neutrophil surfaces within 30 min in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 2g) . Taken together, these findings indicate that inflammation following LAIV impairs the response of nasal and systemic neutrophils to pneumococcus, which could be mimicked by addition of exogenous TNF to neutrophils and is associated with an upregulation of TIGIT.",

Nasal responses associated with pneumococcal clearance are impaired by LAIV. To assess anti-pneumococcal responses induced by carriage, we collected nasal cells 29 days after S. pneumoniae inoculation, stimulated them in vitro with heat-killed S. pneumoniae and measured concentrations of 30 cytokines in the supernatant. Increased production (fold change > 2 and q < 0.05 (P value corrected for multiple testing) to unstimulated control) of TNF, macrophage inflammatory protein 1\u03b1 (MIP-1\u03b1 ), IL-10, IL-6 and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor upon restimulation was observed in the control carriage + group ( Fig. 4a and Supplementary Fig. 6a ). In the LAIV carriage + group, however, this boosting of anti-pneumococcal cytokine responses by rechallenge was absent ( Fig. 4a and Supplementary Fig. 6a ). The production of the above five cytokines correlated with decreased pneumococcal load at day 29 after S. pneumoniae inoculation, suggesting these responses are involved in S. pneumoniae clearance (Fig. 4b) .",

DEGs of carriage + subjects receiving LAIV and DEGs of carriage + subjects without LAIV showed very little overlap, with only 38 DEGs at day 2 and 2 DEGs at day 9 in common. Very little overlap was observed at the pathway level between these groups, indicating LAIV alters the natural responses to pneumococcus ( Fig. 5b and Supplementary Table 5 ). This could reflect transcriptome kinetics, due to altered differentiation and cellular activation, or it could reflect changes in cell migration to the nasal mucosa. The LAIV carriage + group showed enrichment for genes encoding molecules involved in the Toll-like receptor 3 (TLR3) signaling cascade, in retinoic acid-inducible gene I (RIG-I)/melanoma differentiation-associated protein 5 (MDA5)-mediated induction of IFN-\u03b1 /\u03b2 pathways and in IFN-\u03b3 signaling, which is in agreement with the induction of antiviral responses following LAIV vaccination 35 . Moreover, TLR4 signaling was also enriched in this group. The pneumococcal protein pneumolysin is sensed by TLR4 36 , and it is possible that the increased pneumococcal load following LAIV vaccination led to increased pneumolysin sensing. O-linked glycosylation of mucins, which are used by S. pneumoniae as a carbohydrate source for growth 37 , was also enriched in the LAIV carriage + group (including the genes ST3GAL4, GALNT7, GCNT3 and B4GALT5). ST3GAL4 encodes a sialyl transferase, and cleavage of sialic acids by the influenza neuraminidase has previously been shown to promote pneumococcal growth 38 . This finding supports a LAIV-mediated effect on pneumococcal growth through alterations of host factors. Common genes and pathways between the LAIVvaccinated carriers and control carriers include 'innate immune system' and 'signaling by interleukins' (IL1B, CLEC4E, CD55 and IL1RN). In conclusion, the genome-wide transcriptomic response to pneumococcal carriage was substantially altered on both the gene level and the pathway level by LAIV.",

LAIV is an attenuated influenza strain, and wild-type influenza viruses might have even more pronounced effects on the host response to pneumococcus. Carriage in the absence of LAIV was associated with only limited inflammation, corroborating the view of S. pneumoniae as a commensal bacterium that can asymptomatically colonize healthy adults 43 . In contrast, robust proinflammatory cytokine responses were measured following LAIV at both the protein-and gene-expression level. These results provide an explanation for the published finding that LAIV increased acquisition of S. pneumoniae and carriage load 14 .",

Our data showed that individuals with higher concentrations of CXCL10 prior to S. pneumoniae inoculation had higher bacterial loads. In a previous study, children with pneumonia with viral and bacterial (predominantly pneumococcal) co-infection had increased amounts of CXCL10 compared with those of children with only viral or bacterial pneumonia, a finding that is associated with disease severity 46 . Data in mice suggest that CXCL10 plays a direct role during pneumonia. Mice with genetic ablation of CXCR3, the receptor for CXCL10, CXCL9 and CXCL11, showed increased survival, decreased lung inflammation and less invasion following infection, depending on the pneumococcal inoculation strain used 47 . Moreover, addition of exogenous CXCL10 prior to infection of mice with influenza virus or respiratory syncytial virus increased pneumonia severity 48 .",

Nonetheless, the observation that carriage load and duration decline in parallel for all serotypes following repeated exposure suggests that immunological control of newly acquired S. pneumoniae is mediated by similar mechanisms independent of the colonizing serotype 49 . In conclusion, this study highlights the importance of innate immunity-which was impaired by pre-existing viral infectionsin the control of carriage load and clearance of S. pneumoniae. Secondary bacterial infection following viral respiratory tract infection creates a large disease burden worldwide, and disrupting viralbacterial synergy through host-directed therapy could prove an attractive addition to current therapeutic and vaccination options 50 .",

            "text": "Study design and sample collection. Healthy adult volunteers were 1:1 randomized to receive either intranasal LAIV (2015/2016 Fluenz Tetra or FluMist Tetra, AstraZeneca) or intramuscular quadrivalent inactivated influenza vaccination (Fluarix Tetra, GlaxoSmithKline), as described previously 14 . The control group also received a nasal saline spray, while the LAIV group also received an intramuscular saline injection. Three days post-vaccination, all subjects were inoculated with 80,000 colony-forming units (CFU) per nostril of S. pneumoniae 6B type as described previously 6, 51 . Nasal microbiopsies (ASL Rhino-Pro, Arlington Scientific) and nasal lining fluid samples (Nasosorption, Hunt Developments) were collected and stored at \u2212 80 \u00b0C as previously described 52 .Clinical trial details. The double-blinded, randomized clinical LAIV-EHPC (experimental human pneumococcal carriage) trial was registered on EudraCT (number 2014-004634-26) on 28 April 2015 and ISRCTN (number 16993271) on 2 September 2015 and was co-sponsored by the Royal Liverpool University Hospital and the Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine. Key eligibility criteria included capacity to give informed consent, no immunocompromised state or contact with susceptible individuals, no pneumococcal or influenza vaccine or infection in the last 2 years and not having taken part in EHPC studies in the past 3 years. The primary endpoint was the occurrence of pneumococcal colonization as determined by the presence of pneumococcus in nasal wash samples at any time point postinoculation up to and including day 29, detected using classical microbiology or lytA quantitative PCR as previously described 6, 51, 53 . In this study, 130 volunteers were inoculated with pneumococcus, giving an 80% power to identify a 50% increase in carriage acquisition. Of 130 vaccinated volunteers, 5 were natural pneumococcal carriers (2 in the LAIV arm and 3 in the control arm) and were excluded from further analysis. Another 8 subjects in the LAIV arm were excluded following a systematic LAIV dispensing error by a single practitioner, as recommended by the trial steering group. This resulted in final totals of 55 subjects analyzed in the LAIV arm and 62 subjects in the control arm. Key secondary endpoints included the load of pneumococcal colonization in nasal wash samples at each time point following pneumococcal inoculation (days 2, 7, 9, 14, 22 and 29), detected using classical microbiology; the area under the curve of pneumococcal colonization load following pneumococcal inoculation (days 2, 7, 9, 14, 22 and 29), detected using classical microbiology or by molecular methods (lytA); and the immunological mechanisms associated with altered susceptibility to pneumococcus following LAIV. The outcomes reported in this manuscript were a priori included in the study protocol. Flow cytometry analysis. Immunophenotyping of nasal cells obtained by curettes was performed as previously described 52 . In brief, cells were dislodged from curettes and stained with LIVE/DEAD Fixable Violet Dead Cell Stain (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and an antibody cocktail containing Epcam-PE (9C4; BioLegend), HLADR-PECy7 (L243; BioLegend), CD16-APC (3G8; BioLegend), CD66b-FITC (G10F5, BioLegend), CD3-APCH7 (SK7; BD Biosciences), CD14-PercpCy5.5 (M\u03c6 P9, BD Biosciences) and CD45-PACOrange (HI30, Thermo Fisher Scientific). Whole blood was stained for 15 min at room temperature with TIGIT-PECy7 (A15153G, BioLegend) and CD16-APC, followed by 2 \u00d7 10 min incubation steps with FACSLysis buffer (BD Biosciences) to remove erythrocytes. Samples were acquired on an LSR II flow cytometer (BD Biosciences) and analyzed using Flowjo X (Treestar). Fluorescent minus one controls for each of the included antibodies were used to validate results. For the LAIV and control cohorts, but not the additional validation cohort ( Supplementary Fig. 5c ), 84 of 553 samples (15.2%) had less than 500 immune cells or 250 epithelial cells and were excluded from further analysis.Neutrophil opsonophagocytic killing. Neutrophil killing capacity was evaluated as previously described with minor modifications 54 . Briefly, neutrophils were isolated through density-gradient centrifugation, followed by 45 min incubation with serotype 6B pneumococci (inoculation strain, multiplicity of infection 100:1), baby rabbit complement (Mast Group) and human intravenous immunoglobulin (Gamunex; Grifols). In some experiments, recombinant TNF or CXCL10 (Bio-Techne) was added.Luminex analysis of nasal lining fluid or stimulated nasal cells. Nasal cells collected in RPMI medium containing 1% penicillin-streptomycin-neomycin (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and 10% heat-inactivated FBS (Thermo Fisher Scientific) were incubated with 50 \u03bc g ml \u22121 DNase I (Sigma Aldrich) at room temperature for 20 min and filtered over a 70 \u03bc m filter (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Cells were spun down at 440g for 5 min, resuspended, counted and incubated at 250,000 cells ml \u22121 in 96-well or 384-well plates (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Heat-killed S. pneumoniae inoculation strain was added at a concentration of 5 \u00b5 g ml \u22121 of total protein (corresponding to 4.3 \u00d7 10 7 CFU ml \u22121 ), and cells were incubated for 18 h. Bacterial protein concentration was measured by Bradford assay, using BSA as standard, and titration experiments were performed to determine dose. Supernatant was collected and stored at \u2212 80 \u00b0C until analysis. For nasosorption filters, cytokines were eluted from stored filters using 100 \u03bc l of assay buffer (Thermo Fisher Scientific) by centrifugation, then the eluate was cleared by further centrifugation at 16,000g. Prior to analysis, samples were centrifuged for 10 min at 16,000g to clear samples. These were acquired on an LX200 using a 30-plex magnetic human Luminex cytokine kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and analyzed with xPonent3.1 software following the manufacturer's instructions. Samples were analyzed in duplicate, and nasosorption samples with a coefficient of variation (CV) of > 25% were excluded.RNA extraction and sequencing. Nasal cells were collected in RNALater (Thermo Fisher Scientific) at \u2212 80 \u00b0C until extraction. Extraction was performed using the RNEasy Micro Kit (Qiagen) with on-column DNA digestion. Extracted RNA was quantified using a Qubit (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Sample integrity assessment (Bioanalyzer; Agilent), library preparation and RNA sequencing (Illumina HiSeq4000, 20 million reads, 100 paired-end reads) were performed at the Beijing Genome Institute.NanoString. Purified blood neutrophils were stored in RLT buffer (Qiagen) with 1% 2-mercaptoethanol (Sigma Aldrich) at \u2212 80 \u00b0C until RNA extraction as above. The single-cell immunology v2 kit (NanoString) was used with 20 pre-amp cycles for all samples. Hybridized samples were prepared on a Prep Station and scanned on a nCounter MAX (NanoString). Raw counts were analyzed using DESeq2 with internal normalization, which gave lower variance than normalizing to included housekeeping genes. DEGs were identified using a model matrix correcting for repeated individual measurements.",

Read counts from the resulting binary alignment map files were obtained with featureCounts using a general transfer format gene annotation from the Ensembl database 56, 57 . The R/Bioconductor package DESeq2 was used to identify differentially expressed genes among the samples, after removing absent features (zero counts in more than 75% of samples) 58 . Genes with a false-discovery rate value of < 0.1 and an absolute fold change of > 1.5 were identified as differentially expressed.Coexpression analysis. For coexpression analysis, counts were normalized using log[counts per million (CPM)], and the log 2 [fold change] was calculated for each time point in a subject-wise manner. The coexpression analysis was performed separately for each group (control and LAIV) using the CEMiTool package developed by our group and available at Bioconductor (https://bioconductor.org/packages/ release/bioc/html/CEMiTool.html) 39 . This package unifies the discovery and the analysis of coexpression gene modules, evaluating whether modules contain genes that are over-represented by specific pathways or that are altered in a specific sample group.
