Real-time multiplex PCR technology is a quantitative and very sensitive technique for virus detection, based on measuring fluorophoric-labelled oligonucleotides. It can be applied to multiple targets in the same PCR and permits rapid viral identification (15, 16) . Therefore, we hypothesized that patients with clinically stable, severe asthma exhibit increased and more prolonged presence of viruses in the airways as compared to patients with mild asthma and healthy controls. Second, we postulated that such presence can be monitored by longitudinal, noninvasive sampling of the airways, using induced sputum, exhaled breath and standard nasal/throat swabs. Therefore, the primary aim of the study was to perform viral identification in patients with asthma and controls by noninvasive assessment and to associate the presence and types of respiratory virus with clinical severity of asthma. The second aim was to examine whether the assessment of viral presence could be reproduced at 6 and 12 weeks after the initial sampling.

Adenovirus, rhinovirus, RSV, PIV 3&4, influenza B virus, coronavirus, hBoV were identified, whereas enterovirus, influenza A MPV, parechovirus and parainfluenza 1-2 remained undetected. Notably, positive viral identification rates did not significantly differ between patients with mild and severe asthma and healthy controls, nor did infections persist during the 12-week follow-up period. These findings suggest that clinically stable asthma is not characterized by elevated or persistent viral presence in the intraluminal airways. To our knowledge, this is the first study addressing the longitudinal persistence of viral presence in asthma, by repeated sampling of the nasopharynx, induced sputum and exhaled air using a pentaplex PCR for 14 respiratory viruses. Our results extend the cross-sectional findings by Harju et al. (13) who observed no significant differences in the presence of four respiratory viruses (rhinovirus, enterovirus, RSV and adenovirus) in induced sputum between clinically stable asthmatics and controls. Nevertheless, when examining bronchial tissue, it has been reported that rhinovirus is more frequently detected in clinically stable asthmatics as compared to controls (12) . This discrepancy may be attributed to differences in viral presence between airway tissue and intraluminal samples. The latter is supported by a recent cross-sectional study examining 13 respiratory viruses in bronchoalveolar lavage also showing similar detection rates between asymptomatic asthmatic children and controls (25) . Taken together, the present data suggest that respiratory viruses are not more prevalent in the intraluminal airways of asthmatics as compared to controls. The currently observed overall viral detection rate of 6% is considerably lower than the rates reported by invasive techniques such as bronchoalveolar lavage or bronchial biopsies (12, 25) . However, when collectively examining all sam- pling techniques for each subject, 30% of the asthmatics showed virus positivity at a given visit (Figs 1 and 2) . Hence, different detection rates between studies are likely to be because of technical, temporal and/or biological factors, as invasive methods are sampling different locations of the respiratory tract where viral presence may differ from regions sampled by noninvasive methods (13) . Although some studies concluded that nasal washes are slightly more sensitive in viral detection than swabs (26) , others have reported that their sensitivity is equal in adults (27) . We chose the latter, because nasal swabs are easier to carry out than nasal washes and are causing less discomfort. We observed particularly low detection rate in the gelatine-filtered expired air and the EBC, which was not unexpected (28) . Even though the sampling rates did not differ significantly between the five techniques in the present study, our results suggest that induced sputum may represent a better option in this respect. This fits in with previous studies using induced sputum for viral detection (13, 29) and suggests there is a discrepancy between upper and intrapulmonary airway sampling with regard to the detection of respiratory viruses in asthma and controls. We made large efforts for adequate selection of subjects and to use optimized methodology. First, the patients were carefully selected based on the latest asthma guidelines (1). On top of this, we added objective criteria to confirm or exclude variable airways obstruction in patients and controls, respectively. Furthermore, the distinction between mild and severe asthma was based on objective and quantitative criteria, including medication usage (17) . We were careful to exclude patients who had symptoms of respiratory infections in the past 4 weeks. This timing may not totally exclude the possibility of a recent viral illness, because experimental infections have shown that viruses can occasionally persist in the lower airways for more than 4 weeks (30) . Finally, we cannot exclude a medication bias, particularly regarding the dose of inhaled steroids, between the groups. However, this difference was inevitable when selecting mild and severe asthma.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 1014, "end": 1018, "text": "(13)", "ref_id": "BIBREF12"}, {"start": 1386, "end": 1390, "text": "(12)", "ref_id": "BIBREF11"}, {"start": 1716, "end": 1720, "text": "(25)", "ref_id": "BIBREF24"}, {"start": 2059, "end": 2063, "text": "(12,", "ref_id": "BIBREF11"}, {"start": 2064, "end": 2067, "text": "25)", "ref_id": "BIBREF24"}, {"start": 2509, "end": 2513, "text": "(13)", "ref_id": "BIBREF12"}, {"start": 2624, "end": 2628, "text": "(26)", "ref_id": "BIBREF25"}, {"start": 2694, "end": 2698, "text": "(27)", "ref_id": "BIBREF26"}, {"start": 2936, "end": 2940, "text": "(28)", "ref_id": "BIBREF27"}, {"start": 3216, "end": 3220, "text": "(13,", "ref_id": "BIBREF12"}, {"start": 3221, "end": 3224, "text": "29)", "ref_id": "BIBREF28"}, {"start": 3836, "end": 3840, "text": "(17)", "ref_id": "BIBREF16"}, {"start": 4146, "end": 4150, "text": "(30)", "ref_id": "BIBREF29"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 2214, "end": 2228, "text": "(Figs 1 and 2)", "ref_id": "FIGREF0"}], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "Second, our microbiological findings were obtained by the pentaplex PCR, which is able to yield results in qualitative manner. This pentaplex approach is increasingly applied to routine practice of molecular diagnostics for the respiratory viruses, showing an almost complete concordance between the multiplex PCR and the corresponding single-target PCR (15) . Although crossing point (CP) values could give some indication of high or low viral loads, the assay is essentially qualitative and does not allow statements about replicative properties of the virus in the airways of asthmatic patients and healthy controls. The implicit limitation of our approach is that we did not test for the presence of other nonviral respiratory pathogens that have been linked to the persistence and severity of asthma. This was beyond the objective of the present study. Finally, the current sample size provided a power of 0.80 to detect differences of 2.5-fold between the groups. We reasoned that clinical or pathophysiological relevance could only be obtained at >2-fold differences in viral detection rates between the groups. That is why we accepted a 2.5-fold difference with 12 subjects per group. Rather than expanding the sample size, and thereby increasing the statistical power, we chose to sample each subject at three subsequent time points.

However, by using 6-week sampling windows, we cannot exclude the possibility that pre-existing cytokine profiles or airway inflammation in asthma may still impede viral clearance in asthma (32) . Nevertheless, none of the samples showed consistent presence of viruses in individual subjects between 0, 6 and 12 weeks. The variability of virus strains over time extends previous findings in infants (33) and illustrates that series of infections rather than persistent infections occur both in asthmatic and in healthy adults.

This may suggest a link between host characteristics or medication usage and the presence of bocavirus virus in the airways in asthmatics. This needs to be confirmed by larger prospective studies in asthmatics and controls. Furthermore, we cannot exclude that the presence of atopy with or without exposure to relevant allergens may have affected our results. However, this question was beyond the scope of the present study.
