            "text": "Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) is an arterivirus from the Nidovirales order that causes reproductive failure and respiratory disease in pigs and poses a constant threat to the global pig industry. The PRRSV-encoded nonstructural protein 11 (nsp11) is a nidovirus-specific endoribonuclease (NendoU) that is conserved throughout the Arteriviridae and Coronaviridae families. Previously, our research and that of others demonstrated that PRRSV nsp11 inhibits type I interferon (IFN) production through NendoU activity-dependent mechanisms. Here, we found that PRRSV nsp11 also inhibited IFN-stimulated response element (ISRE) promoter activity and subsequent transcription of IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs). Detailed analysis showed that nsp11 targeted interferon regulatory factor 9 (IRF9), but not transducer and activator of transcription 1 (STAT1) or STAT2, key molecules in the type I IFN signaling pathway. Furthermore, the nsp11-IRF9 interaction impaired the formation and nuclear translocation of the transcription factor complex IFN-stimulated gene factor 3 (ISGF3) in both nsp11-overexpressed and PRRSV-infected cells. Importantly, nsp11 mutations (H129A, H144A, and K173A) that ablate NendoU activity or its cell cytotoxicity also interacted with IRF9 and retained the ability to block IFN signaling, indicating that the nsp11-IRF9 interaction is independent of NendoU activity or cell cytotoxicity of nsp11. Taking the results together, our study demonstrated that PRRSV nsp11 antagonizes type I IFN signaling by targeting IRF9 via a NendoU activity-independent mechanism, and this report describes a novel strategy evolved by PRRSV to counteract host innate antiviral responses, revealing a potential new function for PRRSV nsp11 in type I IFN signaling. IMPORTANCE The nidovirus-specific endoribonuclease (NendoU) encoded by PRRSV nonstructural protein 11 (nsp11) is a unique NendoU of nidoviruses that infect vertebrates; thus, it is an attractive target for the development of antinidovirus drugs. Previous studies have revealed that the NendoU of nidoviruses, including porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) and human coronavirus 229E (HCoV-229E), acts as a type I interferon (IFN) antagonist. Here, for the first time, we demonstrated that overexpression of PRRSV nsp11 also inhibits IFN signaling by targeting the C-terminal interferon regulatory factor (IRF) association domain of IRF9. This interaction impaired the ability of IRF9 to form the transcription factor complex IFNstimulated gene factor 3 (ISGF3) and to act as a signaling protein of IFN signaling. Collectively, our data identify IRF9 as a natural target of PRRSV NendoU and reveal a novel mechanism evolved by an arterivirus to counteract innate immune signaling.",

After being cleaved by four virus-encoded proteases, nonstructural protein 1\u2423 (nsp1\u2423), nsp1\u2424, nsp2, and nsp4, the two polyproteins are further cleaved into individual nonstructural proteins that perform different functions during the viral life cycle (5) .

Upon recognition of PAMPs, PRRs initiate signaling pathways that ultimately trigger the production of type I IFNs. Subsequently, the Janus kinase/signal transduction and transcription activator (JAK/STAT) pathway is activated by type I IFNs (9, 10) . Briefly, type I IFNs bind to their surface receptors (IFNAR1 and IFNAR2) and then activate and phosphorylate the two intracellular tyrosine kinases Janus kinase 1 (JAK1) and tyrosine kinase 2 (TYK2). These activated tyrosine kinases mainly phosphorylate two transcription factors, namely, signal transducer and activator of transcription 1 (STAT1) and STAT2, which interact with IFN regulatory factor 9 (IRF9) to form IFNstimulated gene factor 3 (ISGF3) (11) . The transcription factor complex ISGF3 (STAT1/ STAT2/IRF9) is transported to the nucleus, where it recognizes IFN-stimulated response elements (ISREs), leading to the induction of hundreds of IFN-stimulating genes (ISGs) (12) . Many ISGs function as potent antiviral effectors, directly preventing viral infections by targeting viral processes such as viral entry, viral genome replication, viral protein synthesis, or viral body release (13) .",

            "text": "During coevolution with their hosts, many viruses have developed elaborate strategies to circumvent the JAK/STAT pathway in IFN signaling (14) . Among several known viral evasion strategies, targeting the transcription factor complex ISGF3 is a particularly powerful means of inactivating IFN signaling, because this strategy effectively inhibits common downstream ISG expression. For example, our recent study showed that porcine deltacoronavirus blocks the JAK/STAT pathway by 3C-like protease-mediated cleavage of STAT2 (15) . The nonstructural protein 1 (NSP1) of rotavirus mediates the degradation of IRF9 by targeting the C-proximal IRF-binding domain and inhibits IFN-mediated phosphorylation of STAT1 (16, 17) . Sendai virus C protein binds STAT1 to block the formation of STAT1/STAT2 heterodimers or STAT1/STAT1 homodimers, which inhibit IFN signaling (18) . Previous studies have shown that PRRSV nsp11 inhibits type I IFN production through nidovirus-specific endoribonuclease (NendoU) activitydependent mechanisms (19) (20) (21) . However, the NendoU activity of overexpressed nsp11 unexpectedly exhibited extensive substrate specificity in vitro and is extremely toxic to prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells, indicating that the inhibition of IFN production by wild-type (WT) PRRSV nsp11 may be due to its cytotoxicity (21) . Here, we found that PRRSV nsp11 also inhibits ISRE promoter activity and the transcription of ISGs, thereby interfering with the type I IFN signaling pathway. Importantly, mutations that eliminate NendoU activity and its cytotoxicity in nsp11 retain the ability to block IFN signaling. Detailed analysis showed that nsp11 inhibited type I IFN signaling by targeting IRF9, a key molecule in the ISGF3 complex, revealing a potential novel function of PRRSV nsp11 in type I IFN signaling.",

Type I IFN signaling induces a potent antiviral response in cells by inducing the expression of hundreds of ISGs, which is vital for the control of viral infections (22) . To assess the potential role of PRRSV nsp11 in type I IFN signaling, the mRNA levels of IFN-stimulated gene 15 (ISG15), ISG54, ISG56, and 2'-5'-oligoadenylate synthetase 1 (OAS1) were analyzed in human embryonic kidney cells (HEK-293T) overexpressing hemagglutinin (HA)-tagged PRRSV nsp11. As shown in Fig. 1A , PRRSV nsp11 significantly inhibited the transcription of ISGs induced by IFN-\u2423 compared with the control group results. Because of the presence of ISRE in the ISG promoter regions, various concentrations of PRRSV nsp11 expression plasmid and ISRE-luciferase reporter plasmid were cotransfected into HEK-293T cells or porcine kidney cells (PK-15). The results showed that nsp11 strongly inhibited IFN-\u2423-induced ISRE promoter activity in a dose-dependent manner in HEK-293T cells (Fig. 1B) and PK-15 cells (Fig. 1C) . These results confirm the antagonistic nature of PRRSV nsp11 in type I IFN signaling.",

            "text": "PRRSV nsp11 inhibits type I IFN signaling in an endoribonuclease activityindependent manner. In arterivirus, the nsp11 endoribonuclease is important for viral replication (19, 21, (23) (24) (25) (26) . Several previous studies have shown that PRRSV nsp11 inhibits type I IFN production in a NendoU activity-dependent manner (19) (20) (21) . We considered such a possibility for PRRSV nsp11-mediated inhibition of type I IFN signaling to be associated also with its NendoU activity. On the basis of their chemical properties and known residue requirements, the three catalytic residues of endoribonucleases (His129, His144, and Lys173 [numbering based on PRRSV nsp11]) were shown to be directly involved in catalysis (21, 23, 25) . Thus, three endoribonuclease catalytic residue mutations, His129Ala (H129A), His144Ala (H144A), and Lys173Ala (K173A), were introduced into PRRSV nsp11 and the corresponding eukaryotic expression plasmids expressing the N-terminally HA-tagged nsp11 endoribonuclease inactive mutants were constructed. To test whether the HA-tagged nsp11 mutants lose endoribonuclease activity, HA-tagged WT nsp11 and three mutants were expressed in Escherichia coli. The recombinant proteins were purified ( Fig. 2A) , and fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) assays were performed to detect the endoribonuclease activity. As shown in Fig. 2B , the levels of endoribonuclease activity of the three HA-tagged nsp11 mutants were significantly decreased compared with the WT nsp11 (Fig. 2B) . However, none of the endoribonuclease inactive mutants (H129A, H144A, or K173A) showed a loss of the ability of nsp11 to inhibit ISRE promoter activity in cells overexpressing HA-tagged nsp11 mutants (Fig. 2C) . We also used PRRSV nsp9 as a negative control and porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) nsp15 as a positive control. In agreement with a previous study (27) , PEDV WT nsp15 suppressed IFN-\u2423-induced ISRE promoter activity whereas such an inhibitory effect was not observed in cells expressing a PEDV nsp15 endoribonuclease inactive mutant (H226A) or PRRSV nsp9 (Fig. 2C) . These data suggest that although the NendoU activity of PEDV nsp15 is important for inhibiting IFN signaling, PRRSV nsp11 does not depend on the NendoU activity. We further tested the ability of nsp11 mutants to inhibit IFN-\u2423-induced ISG expression. As shown in Fig. 2D , each endoribonuclease inactive mutant (H129A, H144A, or K173A) of nsp11 also inhibited the IFN-\u2423-induced transcription of ISGs. Since these three mutants are also devoid of cell cytotoxicity (21), our results indicated that the inhibition of IFN signaling observed in nsp11-expressing cells is independent of its endoribonuclease activity and cell cytotoxicity.",

ISGs are antiviral effectors induced by IFNs through the formation of a tripartite transcription factor, ISGF3, which is composed of STAT1, STAT2, and IRF9 (11) . Given the pivotal role of the transcription factor complex ISGF3 in type I IFN signaling, we further investigated whether overexpression of nsp11 inhibits ISGF3-mediated signaling. As shown in Fig. 3 , coexpression of the components of transcription factor complex ISGF3 (STAT1, STAT2, and IRF9) significantly activated the ISRE promoter compared with the results seen with the empty plasmid control. However, activation of the ISRE promoter by ISGF3 was significantly inhibited in the presence of PRRSV nsp11 (Fig. 3) . Similarly to the results seen with WT nsp11, each endoribonuclease inactive mutant (H129A, H144A, or K173A) was also able to suppress the ISGF3-mediated IRES promoter (Fig. 3) , suggesting that the endoribonuclease activity of nsp11 does not govern the ability of nsp11 to block the activity of the ISGF3-induced IRES promoter. Consequently, we speculated that PRRSV nsp11 might target the ISGF3 complex to inhibit type I IFN signaling.",

The levels of phosphorylated STAT1 and STAT2 were greatly increased after IFN-\u2423 treatment, and no difference in the levels was found between nsp11-expressing cells and nsp11-nonexpressing cells (Fig. 4, lanes 3 and 4) . Similarly, nsp11 mutants lacking endoribonuclease activity (H129A, H144A, and K173A) had no effect on the phosphorylation of STAT1 and STAT2 (Fig. 4 [compare lane 3 to lanes 5 to 7]). These results indicated that PRRSV nsp11 and its endoribonuclease inactive mutants do not target the ISGF3 complex for degradation or prevent type I IFN-induced STAT1 proteinactivating tyrosine phosphorylation.",

To investigate which domain of porcine IRF9 is involved in nsp11 protein binding, four mutants with deletions of different domains of IRF9, including IRF9 (aa 1 to 120; DBD), IRF9 (aa 1 to 200; DBD-FL), IRF9 (aa 200 to 411; IAD), and IRF9 (aa 120 to 411; FL-IAD), were constructed by mutagenesis (Fig. 5E ). HEK-293T cells were cotransfected with various combinations of Flag-tagged full-length or deleted versions of IRF9 and the HA-tagged PRRSV nsp11 protein. As shown in Fig. 5F , PRRSV nsp11-IRF9 interaction impairs the IFN-induced formation and nuclear accumulation of ISGF3. Since the function of ISGF3 relies on the selective interaction between phosphorylated STAT2 and the IRF-association domain of IRF9 (36, 37) , the observed interaction between nsp11 and IRF9-IAD led us to speculate that this interaction may impair the recruitment of phosphorylated STAT2 by IRF9 and the subsequent nuclear accumulation of ISGF3. To test this hypothesis, HEK-293T cells were transfected with the indicated nsp11 expression plasmids and then treated with IFN-\u2423. The PRRSV nsp11 protein and phosphorylated STAT1/STAT2 (STAT1-Y701 and STAT2-Y690) were immunoprecipitated with an anti-IRF9 antibody. As shown in Fig. 6A , IFN-\u2423 treatment significantly induced the phosphorylation of STAT1 and STAT2, and IRF9 efficiently pulled down phosphorylated STAT1/STAT2 after IFN-\u2423 treatment (compare lanes 1 and 3). However, the amount of phosphorylated STAT1/STAT2 that bound to IRF9 remarkably decreased in the presence of PRRSV nsp11 and its mutants (H129A, H144A, and K173A) (Fig. 6A, lanes 3 and 4 to 7) .",

Of note, PRRSV infection has been found to produce abnormally low levels of type I IFNs and to inhibit the ability of type I IFNs to induce antiviral responses (1, 38) . The endoribonuclease encoded within the PRRSV nsp11 sequence, which has the uridylate-preferred cleavage site for RNA that is necessary for virus replication, has been found to be a multifunctional protein (19, 21) . Previously, it has been demonstrated that PRRSV nsp11 is involved in the inhibition of IFN production through multiple distinct mechanisms, as follows. (i) nsp11 represses the transcription of type I IFNs by inhibiting the activation of transcription factors IRF3 and nuclear factor kappa B (NF-B), which directly activate the promoters of type I IFNs (19, 20) . (ii) nsp11 reduces the levels of transcripts and proteins of mitochondrial antiviral signaling protein (MAVS) and retinoic acid-inducible gene I (RIG-I), two critical factors in the IFN induction pathway (19) . (iii) nsp11 removes the ubiquitin chains from IB\u2423 (inhibitor of NF-B alpha), thereby preventing the proteasomal degradation of IB\u2423 and subsequent liberation of NF-B (39). (iv) nsp11 recruits the OTU deubiquitinase with linear linkage specificity (OTULIN) to enhance its ability to remove the cellular protein ubiquitin associated with innate immunity, resulting in the additive effect of suppressing type I IFN production (40) . However, whether nsp11 also regulates IFN signaling remains unclear. In this report, we present evidence that PRRSV nsp11 suppressed type I IFN signaling by targeting IRF9, a key molecule in the JAK/STAT pathway, revealing a potential new function for the nidovirus endoribonuclease in type I IFN signaling.",

            "text": "PRRSV nsp11, a conserved NendoU within the Arteriviridae and Coronaviridae families, belongs to the Xenopus laevis poly(U)-specific endoribonuclease (XendoU) superfamily and plays an important role in nidovirus replication and pathogenesis (41) . The structures of the arterivirus nsp11, coronavirus (CoV) nsp15, and XendoU catalytic domains, essential for endoribonuclease activity, and particularly the active site residues (His129, His144, and Lys173; numbering based on PRRSV nsp11), were found to be highly conserved. Besides PRRSV nsp11, several other studies have reported that CoV nsp15 inhibits IFN production in ectopic expression experiments. In support of this, infection with NendoU activity-deficient CoVs, such as PEDV, murine hepatitis virus, and human CoV 229E (HCoV-229E), produced a remarkably high level of type I IFN in primary cells compared with WT infection, which effectively demonstrated the IFNantagonistic properties of nsp15 of CoVs (27, 42, 43) . These data appear to indicate that endoribonuclease activity is sufficient for NendoU-mediated IFN transcriptional repression; however, the NendoU activity of overexpressed nsp11/nsp15 may unexpectedly mediate nonspecific cleavage, thereby inducing cytotoxicity (21, 41) . Unfortunately, it was impossible to determine whether the cell cytotoxicity also contributed to the inhibition of IFN induction by NendoU, as mutations disrupting the ability of NendoU to block IFN production abrogated not only endoribonuclease activity but also its cell cytotoxicity (21) . Thus, the observation of IFN transcriptional suppression in previous studies could have been the result of cytotoxicity as a consequence of ectopic over-expression of NendoU. Previous studies have shown that PRRSV WT nsp11 is toxic to E. coli and that the expression levels of WT nsp11 are extremely low and that one of the NendoU mutants (nsp11 K173A) can be expressed at high levels under identical conditions (19, 25) . Similar phenomena were observed in our experiments designed to express and purify nsp11. Indeed, in our previous study (21) , we found that PRRSV WT nsp11 exhibited cytotoxicity to eukaryotic cells whereas no cytotoxicity associated with the NendoU mutants of nsp11 was detected. Similarly, recombinant nsp11 of equine arteritis virus (EAV) has been reported to be extremely toxic to a variety of hosts (25) . Thus, the lower level of expression of PRRSV WT nsp11 may have been due to its cytotoxicity (Fig. 4) . Interestingly, our results clearly showed that the PRRSV nsp11 mutants (H129A, H144A, and K173A) devoid of both NendoU activity and cell cytotoxicity retained the ability to block type I IFN signaling by targeting IRF9, as did WT nsp11, indicating that nsp11 has evolved a new mechanism for the impairment of IFN signaling that operates in an endoribonuclease activity-independent and cell cytotoxicity-independent manner, distinct from the inhibition of IFN induction.",

            "text": "As a potent antiviral response, type I IFN signaling can control viral infections by activating the transcription factor complex ISGF3 (STAT1/STAT2/IRF9), resulting in increased transcription of hundreds of ISGs and contributing to the development of an antiviral state (12, 13) . It is becoming increasingly apparent that IRF9 is a central factor not only for mediation of but also for regulation and direction of type I IFN responses (44) . While many IFN effects, in particular, those associated with type I IFNs, require all three canonical signaling molecules, studies of IRF9 deficiency revealed unique roles for IRF9 that were distinct from those of STAT1 and STAT2 (45, 46) . Recently, evidence has emerged that IRF9 is the main viral target of the host's innate immune response. For example, our previous study (31) revealed that porcine bocavirus nonstructural protein 1 (NS1) inhibits the DNA-binding activity of ISGF3 by interacting with IRF9. Another study showed that the E7 oncoprotein of papillomavirus binds to IRF9 to block the formation of the ISGF3 complex (47) . Moreover, many virus-encoded proteins, such as varicella-zoster virus ORF63, adenovirus early region 1A protein (E1A), and rotavirus NSP1, mediate IRF9 degradation (16, 48, 49) . Human cytomegalovirus also reduces the protein levels of IRF9 in human embryonic lung fibroblasts (50) . To survive in the host, PRRSV has also evolved strategies to block IFN signaling. Previous studies have revealed that PRRSV nsp1\u2424, a papain-like proteinase, blocks the nuclear translocation of ISGF3 by inducing degradation of karyopherin-\u24231 (51, 52) . Here, we showed that nsp11 is another PRRSVencoded antagonist of IFN signaling. PRRSV nsp11 adopts a mechanism distinct from that of nsp1\u2424, i.e., interaction with IRF9, an essential component in the formation of ISGF3. Our data not only highlight the multifaceted control of type I IFN signaling by PRRSV but also uncover a novel mechanism by which PRRSV antagonizes innate immune signaling.",

            "text": "It is well established that IRF9 exhibits several functionally conserved regions among the members of the IRF family, such as an N-terminal DNA-binding domain that recognizes and binds to ISRE motifs in the promoter region of most ISGs and a C-terminal IRF-association domain that is responsible for selective interaction with the coiled-coil domain (CCD) of STAT2 (36, 37) . Recently, Rengachari and colleagues reported the crystal structures of IRF9-IAD alone and in a complex with STAT2-CCD (53) . The structure of the IRF9-IAD/STAT2-CCD complex revealed that surface features had deviated from their respective paralogs to enable a specific interaction between IRF9-IAD and STAT2-CCD required for ISGF3 function in cells (53) . In this study, we found that PRRSV nsp11 specifically interacted with IRF9-IAD. Thus, it may be the case that the targeting of IRF9-IAD by nsp11 sequesters the interaction between IRF9 and STAT2. This may help to explain why the formation and nuclear translocation of ISGF3 were severely impaired in PRRSV nsp11-transfected cells and PRRSV-infected cells. Interestingly, PRRSV nsp11 mutants (H129A, H144A, and K173A) also impaired the formation and nuclear translocation of ISGF3 by interacting with IRF9. Furthermore, the three-dimensional (3D) structures of NendoU activity-defective arterivirus nsp11 (K173A in PRRSV nsp11; H141A and K170A in EAV nsp11) are remarkably similar to those of WT PRRSV nsp11 (21, 23) , with an overall root mean square deviation (RMSD) range of 0.408 to 2.000 \u00c5 (data not shown), suggesting that the Ala substitution in His129, His144, and Lys173 of PRRSV nsp11 in this study might not prevent the core conformations of nsp11 protein from folding correctly. On the basis of data presented here and those reported by others mentioned above, we speculate that the ability to interact with IRF9 correlated with the correct folding of nsp11 but not with NendoU activity or cell cytotoxicity. Future investigations will be required to identify the structural basis of the nsp11-IRF9 interaction.",

            "text": "Although our data clearly demonstrated that PRRSV nsp11 could be coimmunoprecipitated with endogenous IRF9 in PRRSV-infected cells, thereby inhibiting the formation and nuclear translocation of ISGF3 (Fig. 7) , whether PRRSV nsp11 also functions as an antagonist of IFN signaling during PRRSV infection has not been fully understood. One of the obstacles to studying arterivirus with NendoU activitydeficient nsp11 mutants in cell culture is that catalytic residue mutations have been reported to nearly completely abolish viral replication even in IFN-deficient cells (19, 26) . Future investigations designed to identify other nonactive site residues of nsp11 that are involved in the nsp11-IRF9 interaction but that do not affect PRRSV replication will be required to fully elucidate the function of nsp11 in IFN signaling. In summary, our data identify PRRSV nsp11 as a newly recognized antagonist in IFN signaling and show that the nsp11-IRF9 interaction is involved in inhibition of the formation and nuclear translocation of ISGF3. This novel function of PRRSV nsp11 offers new insight into the interaction between a viral EndoU and the IFN signaling pathway, potentially aiding the development of novel therapeutic targets and more-effective vaccines against PRRSV.",
