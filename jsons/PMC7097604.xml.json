Based on tumour stage classification, UBC is grouped into non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC) and muscle-invasive bladder cancer (MIBC)2,3. NMIBC includes carcinoma in situ (Cis or Tis), pTa and pT1 tumours, with cancer cells located in the mucosa and submucosa of the bladder, and MIBC includes pT2\u2013pT4 tumour stages, indicating invasion of cancer cells into the muscle layer of the bladder and beyond2,3. Most low-grade NMIBCs are prone to recurrence after treatment; flat Cis noninvasive lesions and papillary tumours are always characterized by high-grade cancer cells, with the risk of progression to MIBC and subsequent occurrence of metastases in 40\u201380% of patients, depending on the extent of the disease2,4,5. Patients with MIBC are treated with radical cystectomy, lymph node dissection and urinary diversion, and these patients are at high risk of metastatic tumour progression and cancer-related death3,6.",

Among these virulence factors, many bacterial enzymes that can degrade the ECM have been extensively characterized, including collagenase, elastase and hyaluronidase14,15. In addition, the bacterial invasion of tissues induces inflammation, a reaction which further sustains ECM remodelling, as well as the generation of oxygen radicals, which induce DNA damage and mutations that drive cancer and cancer recurrence16.",

Hence, an urgent need exists to better understand processes underlying bladder carcinogenesis, progression and metastasis, and to identify new prognostic and predictive markers, as well as novel potential therapeutic targets17,18. The ECM and microbiota represent two microenvironments that contribute to the onset and progression of tumours, which has been extensively studied in colorectal cancer19. In this Review, we provide an overview of the ECM and microbiota of the human epithelium, highlighting how dysregulation of either environment might influence the development and progression of UBC. An in-depth investigation of these two microenvironments and the role of their dysregulation in UBC might eventually provide novel prognostic, diagnostic and predictive biomarkers and new treatment strategies for this disease.",

Indeed, increased expression levels of MMP-10 in the bladder have been associated with an invasive phenotype of UBC76, increased expression levels of MMP-7 (both in tissue and serum samples) have been associated with the occurrence of metastatic disease in patients with UBC77, and MMP-14 expression levels correlated with tumour stage and grade, as well as poor prognosis78,79. MMP-2 and MMP-9 have also been extensively evaluated in UBC, owing to their collagenolytic activity against collagen IV, which is distributed in the basal membrane, but the results were conflicting80. In agreement with the increased expression levels of MMP-7 in UBC, MMP-7-mediated shedding of the transmembrane proteoglycan syndecan-1 was found to be independently associated with UBC progression and poor survival81, and the same process has been reported to be involved in chemotherapy resistance of colorectal cancer82.",

The turnover of hyaluronic acid is profoundly altered during UBC progression, owing to increased expression of hyaluronan synthase 1 (Ref. 84) and hyaluronidase-1 (Ref. 83), resulting in increased levels of hyaluronic acid fragments, and hyaluronic acid receptors (CD44 and the receptor for hyaluronan-mediated motility, also known as RHAMM)84. These factors contribute to the formation of a protumoural environment. Hyaluronic acid fragments boost the inflammatory response by releasing hyaluronic-acid-bound proinflammatory mediators85, and by inhibiting type 2 immune responses, thus, favouring angiogenesis and cell motility86, which are likely to contribute to the tumour-supporting effect of hyaluronic acid87,88. In addition, RHAMM expression in the urothelium has been associated with MIBC progression84, holding promise for further evaluation as a prognostic marker or therapeutic target in UBC treatment. In 2014, the determination of urinary levels of hyaluronic acid and hyaluronidase was reported to be a highly accurate and noninvasive method for detecting bladder transitional cell carcinoma regardless of tumour grade89,90.",

Although almost all available data come from observations made in the gut, they clearly demonstrate that microbial products can be directly profibrogenic. For example, progressive fibrosis was observed in the intestine of rats 17\u201326 days after injection of a bacterial cell wall component into the rat bowel155,156. Similarly, the same consequences were observed 7 days after autologous injection of faecal material or anaerobic bacteria into rats157. In both experiments, fibrogenesis was associated with an increase in classical profibrotic mediators, such as TGF-\u03b2 in the mucosa, and could be inhibited by antibiotic treatment. These findings suggest that if microbial components can cross through urothelial barriers, similar to intestinal ones, they could also trigger inflammation, as well as fibrosis and bladder stiffness at the same sites. Moreover, underscoring the complexity of this interaction, the microorganisms found in a patient with established fibrosis might not be the same as the organisms that triggered the initial events. Indeed, as observed in intestinal fibrosis in mice, once fibrogenesis is initiated, it might be self-perpetuating158. In addition, ECM accumulation leads to increased tissue stiffness that can in itself drive fibrogenesis through an integrin-mediated fibroblast activation159.",

Moreover, regardless of sex, in 75% of samples, more than 50% of bacteria belonged to the phylum Firmicutes. Samples from women also had members of the phyla Actinobacteria and Bacteroidetes, which were generally absent from the samples collected from men. In addition, midstream urinary analysis confirmed the existence of a core microbiome \u2014 also in the bladder \u2014 but with variability in the amount of the core bacteria, along with a variable prevalence of other bacteria, across age groups. This observation was even more pronounced in the urinary tract than in the gut microbiome166,167, supporting the hypothesis that bladder colonization with specific genera over the course of a lifetime might ultimately influence the propensity for bladder pathology in later life. These findings might also explain the difference in the frequency of urinary diseases observed in men and women.",

Indeed, this was one of the reasons why the bladder microbiome was not originally included in the Human Microbiome Project. However, sampling of the midstream bacterial population only might not enable detection of bacterial communities in biofilms in the bladder that adhere to the mucosa for long periods of time in direct interaction with the urothelium. For example, a different composition of mucosa-associated and luminal microbiota has been reported in the process of characterizing the intestinal microbiota168,169,170,171. Thus, similar to the intestinal microbiota, further studies are needed to help understand the modulation of the composition and variety of bladder-associated bacterial strains, which are likely to be dependent on age, gender, breast feeding, dietary and socioeconomic status.",

The association between bladder-associated microbiota and the incidence of cancer in men and women has not yet been comprehensively assessed. For example, whether the preponderant bacterial strain Lactobacillus in the bladder of women might provide protection from UBC is not known, although many reports have shown that Lactobacillus might reduce chronic inflammation and potentiate a number of immune responses172,173,174,175,176. A multicentre, double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized trial in 138 patients with primary bladder tumours reported that daily oral administration of freeze-dried Lactobacillus casei sp. Shirota for 1 year prevented the recurrence of UBC after transurethral resection of the tumours177. Another multicentre, prospective, randomized, controlled trial that enrolled 207 patients demonstrated that patients treated orally for 1 year with L. casei sp. Shirota in addition to transurethral epirubicin (for 3 months) had a significantly lower UBC recurrence rate at 3 years compared with the epirubicin only group, although the overall survival did not differ between the groups178. In addition, a case-control study in 180 patients and 445 population-based controls showed that regular (1\u20132 times per week) probiotic intake reduced UBC risk in the healthy population179. Taken together, these results strongly support the protective role of L. casei Shirota against bladder cancer.",

Whether a chronic state of bacterial colonization is associated with a chronic state of low-grade bladder inflammation still requires investigation. In healthy individuals, intentional instillation into the bladder of E. coli sp. 83972 (the prototype strain of asymptomatic bacteriuria)185 resulted in a normal acute neutrophil response but only a modest inflammatory response186. This finding suggests that, indeed, chronic low-grade bladder inflammation can be present even in the absence of symptomatic infection and that this inflammation can be associated with low pathogenic or nonpathogenic bacterial strains that colonize the urothelium. The association between chronic inflammation, mucosa-associated microbiota and the development and outcome of solid tumours has been validated for a variety of neoplasia, in particular colorectal cancer187,188. In bladder cancer, a preliminary study found an association between urinary dysbiosis (specifically, an altered ratio among Pseudomonas and Anaerococcus versus Streptococcus) and urothelial carcinoma189.",

Establishing the stiffness of bladder ECM and the correct ratio of ECM components, in particular the total amount of collagens and elastin, will probably contribute to the design of scaffolds resembling native features of the bladder.

Abnormal ECM composition and structure affect cancer progression by either promoting cellular transformation and metastasis or deregulating behaviour of stromal cells, eventually facilitating tumour-associated angiogenesis and inflammation9.

Bacteria-induced posttranslational modifications of host proteins might also alter functions that are regulated by ECM components, such as cell localization, proliferation and adhesion. Identification of pathogenic bacteria associated with specific diseases will open the way for searching post-translational modifications associated with the onset and progression of these diseases. Post-translational modifications of ECM components will probably also be discovered for solid tumours and other solid diseases.
