Prior to the introduction of measles vaccine, more than 130 million cases and 7-8 million deaths due to measles were estimated to have occurred annually, and almost everyone was infected during childhood. Measles mortality declined in the first half of the twentieth century in developed countries as a consequence of improvements in living conditions, better nutritional status, and the availability of antibiotics for secondary bacterial infections. The introduction of measles vaccines beginning in the 1960s led to substantial reductions in measles incidence, morbidity, and mortality in both developed and developing countries. Measles vaccines were not available for many of the world's children, however, until the World Health Organization (WHO) launched the Expanded Programme on Immunization (EPI) in 1974, which provided vaccines against six target diseases including measles. Global vaccine coverage against EPI targeted diseases increased from less than 5% at the start of the program to almost 80% by 1990.",

Although reducing case fatality through appropriate case management is an important component, measles mortality reduction is achieved largely through a reduction in incidence. To reduce incidence, measles vaccine is administered as a single dose through routine immunization services ( Fig. 9 . 2 ), with the optimal age 5'000'000 4'500'000 4'000'000 3'500'000 3'000'000 2'500'000 2'000'000 1'500'000 1'000'000 500'000 0 0 1980 1981 1982 1983 1984 1985 1986 1987 1988 1989 1990 1991 1992 1993 1994 1995 1996 1997 1998 1999 of immunization determined by the average age of infection and the rate of decline of maternal antibodies. In areas where measles is endemic, and the average age of infection is low, measles vaccine is routinely administered at 9 months of age in accordance with the EPI schedule (WHO 2004) . In countries where MV transmission has been significantly reduced, the age at first vaccination is often increased to 12-15 months, resulting in a higher proportion of children who develop protective immunity. If vaccination coverage is sufficiently high, substantial reductions in incidence and mortality occur, the period between epidemics lengthens, and the age distribution shifts toward older children and young adults, further contributing to a reduction in measles case fatality. Mortality reduction can also be achieved by proper case management, including the administration of vitamin A to persons with measles (D'Souza and D'Souza 2002) and prompt antibiotic treatment of secondary bacterial pneumonia (Duke and Mgone 2003) . Provision of vitamin A through polio and measles vaccination campaigns further contributes to the reduction in measles mortality (WHO 2005).",

Small outbreaks of primary and secondary cases may occur following importation from outside the region, but sustained transmission does not occur. Because of the high infectivity of MV and the fact that not all persons develop protective immunity following vaccination, a single dose of measles vaccine does not achieve a sufficient level of population immunity to eliminate measles. A second opportunity for measles immunization is necessary to provide protective immunity to children who fail to respond to the first dose, as well as to immunize those children who were not previously vaccinated. Two strategies to administer the second dose of measles vaccine have been used. In countries with sufficient health infrastructure, and where children routinely receive well-child care beyond the 1 st year of life, the second dose of measles vaccine is administered through routine immunization services, typically prior to the start of school (4-6 years of age). High coverage levels can be ensured by school entry requirements (CDC 2007) . A second approach, first developed by the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO) for South and Central America (PAHO 1999) and modeled after polio eradication strategies, involves mass immunization campaigns (called supplementary immunization activities or SIA) to deliver the second dose of measles vaccine. This strategy was successful in eliminating measles in South and Central America (de Quadros et al. 1996 and has resulted in a marked reduction in measles incidence and mortality in much of sub-Saharan Africa (Otten et al. 2005; WHO 2006b ).",

The catch-up activity consists of a one-time, mass immunization campaign that targets all children within a broad age range regardless of whether they have previously had wild-type MV infection or measles vaccination. The goal is to rapidly achieve a high level of population immunity and interrupt MV transmission. These campaigns are conducted over a short period of time, usually several weeks, and during a low transmission season. Under the PAHO strategy, children 9 months to 14 years of age were targeted for vaccination, a substantial proportion of the total population in many countries. The appropriate target age range depends upon the age distribution of measles cases. In regions where measles is endemic, the majority of older children are likely to be immune. Nevertheless, seroprevalence studies usually are not conducted prior to catch-up campaigns, and this broad age range first adopted by PAHO has been widely used in sub-Saharan Africa and Asia. These campaigns require significant financial investments and the commitment of large numbers of personnel; extensive logistical planning to transport and store vaccines, maintain cold chains, and dispose of syringes and needles; and community mobilization to ensure participation. If successful, SIA are cost effective (Dayan et al. 2004; Uzicanin et al. 2004 ) and can abruptly interrupt MV transmission, with dramatic declines in incidence and mortality.",

Follow-up refers to periodic mass campaigns to prevent the accumulation of susceptible children. Followup campaigns typically target children 9 months to 4 years of age, a narrower age group than targeted in catch-up campaigns. Follow-up campaigns should be conducted when the estimated number of susceptible children reaches the size of one birth cohort, generally every 3-5 years after the catch-up campaign. These campaigns need to be conducted indefinitely because of the potential risk of MV importation, or until the health infrastructure is sufficiently developed so that the second opportunity can be provided through routine immunization services. Mop-up campaigns target difficult-to-reach children in areas of measles outbreaks or low vaccine coverage. Difficult to reach children include those living on the street or in areas of conflict.",

Despite 98% measles vaccination coverage in the state of Indiana (among sixth-graders), 34 cases of measles resulted, of whom 94% were unvaccinated. Second, the widespread circulation of MV and ease of global travel allows for MV importation. Perhaps surprisingly, these importations frequently arise from countries with ample resources for measles control. A multistate outbreak of measles in 2007 occurred at an international sporting event after importation from Japan (CDC 2008a), the country responsible for the most imported cases of measles into the US over the past several years (Takahashi and Saito 2008) . Thousands of measles cases occur annually in Japan as a consequence of low vaccination coverage resulting from the relaxing of vaccination requirements after an outbreak of aseptic meningitis from the Urabe mumps vaccine strain (Gomi and Takahashi 2004) . Third, as measles control efforts are increasingly successful in reducing disease incidence, public perceptions of the risk of measles diminish and are replaced by concerns of possible adverse events associated with measles vaccine. An outbreak of measles in San Diego in 2008, imported from Switzerland, resulted in 11 additional cases in unvaccinated children and two generations of secondary cases (CDC 2008b). Among the nine cases older than 1 year of age, eight were unvaccinated because of personal exemption beliefs.",

Outbreaks can occur in populations in which less than 10% of individuals are susceptible. The contagiousness of MV is best expressed by the basic reproductive number R o , which represents the mean number of secondary cases that would arise if an infectious agent were introduced into a completely susceptible population. R o is a function not only of the infectious agent, but also of the host population. The estimated R o for MV is 12-18, in contrast to 5-7 for smallpox and polio viruses and 2-3 for SARS-coronavirus. The high infectivity of MV implies that a high level of population immunity (approximately 92%-94%) is required to interrupt MV transmission (Gay 2004 ).",

Despite progress in measles mortality reduction and elimination, there are several limitations of the licensed vaccines that may make measles eradication more challenging. First, attenuated measles vaccines are inactivated by heat and a cold chain must be maintained to support measles immunization activities. Second, in contrast to oral polio vaccines, measles vaccines must be injected subcutaneously or intramuscularly, necessitating trained healthcare workers, needles, syringes, and proper disposal of hazardous waste. Third, both maternally acquired antibodies and immunological immaturity reduce the protective efficacy of measles vaccination in early infancy, hindering effective immunization of young infants (Gans et al. 1998) . Fourth, the attenuated measles vaccine has the potential to cause serious adverse events, such as lung or brain infection, in severely immunocompromised persons (Angel et al. 1998; Monafo et al. 1994 ). Lastly, a second opportunity for measles vaccination must be provided to achieve sufficient levels of population immunity to interrupt MV transmission.",

The polio eradication campaign in Nigeria, for example, was perceived negatively to trigger a massive outbreak response for just three confirmed cases of polio in Adamawa State in 2005, whereas hundreds of deaths due to measles did not result in a comparable response (Schimmer and Ihekweazu 2006) .

Measles elimination may be particularly difficult in impoverished areas of large cities in Africa and Asia where several factors converge to facilitate MV transmission, including the high population density and difficulties in achieving high vaccination coverage.

Children born to HIVinfected mothers have lower levels of passively acquired maternal antibodies, increasing susceptibility to measles at an earlier age than children born to uninfected mothers (Moss et al. 2002; Scott et al. 2007) , and protective antibody levels following vaccination wane within 2-3 years in many HIV-infected children not receiving antiretroviral therapy , creating a potential pool of susceptible children (Tejiokem et al. 2007 ).

This may change with increased access to antiretroviral therapy, which may prolong survival without enhancing protective immunity in the absence of revaccination.

Whether the threat from bioterrorism precludes stopping measles vaccination after eradication is unclear but, at the least, a single-dose rather than a two-dose measles vaccination strategy could be adopted (Meissner et al. 2004) .",

In contrast to polioviruses, prolonged shedding of potentially virulent vaccine viruses and environmental viral reservoirs will not be challenges to measles eradication. Although MV can be carried by persons during the incubation period, transmission from mobile, asymptomatic carriers is not as common as with poliovirus. However, higher levels of population immunity are necessary to interrupt MV transmission, more highly skilled healthcare workers are required to administer measles vaccines, and containment through case detection and ring vaccination will be more difficult for MV than smallpox virus because of infectivity before rash onset. New tools, such as aerosol administration of measles vaccines (Low et al. 2008) , will facilitate mass vaccination campaigns, allowing less highly trained workers to administer vaccine and diminishing the medical waste disposal problems. Critics of eradication programs claim they can divert resources from primary healthcare and are imposed on countries or communities from outside. Enormous resources and efforts may be required to eradicate the few remaining measles cases, and the economic and social costs of eradication need to be carefully considered (Cutts and Steinglass 1998) . Despite enormous progress, measles remains a leading vaccine-preventable cause of childhood mortality worldwide, and continues to cause outbreaks in communities with low vaccination coverage rates in industrialized nations. To achieve the measles mortality reduction goal, continued progress needs to be made in delivering measles vaccines to the world's children.",
