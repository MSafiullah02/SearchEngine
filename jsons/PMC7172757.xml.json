            "text": "One of the challenges in the laboratory diagnosis of central nervous system (CNS) infections is the relatively high number of potential causative pathogens, including e.g. herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1) and 2 (HSV-2), varicella zoster virus (VZV), Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato, and Mycoplasma pneumoniae. Nucleic acid detection from cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) is usually the method of choice for the diagnosis of neuroinvasive virus infections, especially for different herpes viruses. However, virus serology from serum and CSF provides complementary information, and plays an important role particularly in prolonged infections, and in the investigation of long-term sequelae. For neuroinvasive M. pneumoniae infections, both nucleic acid detection and serology are generally used, while serology is most sensitive for neuroborreliosis. However, the serodiagnosis of Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato is generally complicated by the very variable antibody responses observed between individuals and those at the different stages of the disease. Furthermore, the borrelial antibody response may not reflect an infection, but merely a contact with a tick carrying the pathogen. Due to the complex nature of borreliosis, several different diagnostic methods, e.g. enzyme immunoassays (EIA) and immunoblotting, are often used in parallel to obtain more specific and reliable results for diagnosis Lyme borreliosis. In addition, for the serodiagnosis of borrelial infection, it is generally suggested that two specific antigens should react with patient's serum to establish the diagnosis.",

Such platforms include multiplex bead-based immunoassays and multiple antigen microarrays, which allow for parallel antibody detection.

Borrelia afzelii and VlsE IgG ELISA kit (Sekisui Virotech GmbH), Liaison\u00ae Borrelia IgG (DiaSorin), and Borrelia Europe Plus TpN17 Line IgG Line Immunoblot (Sekisui Virotech GmbH, R\u00fcsselsheim, Germany) were used for the detection of borrelial IgG. The linear measurement ranges were 9\u201340 AU/ml for the Sekisui Virotech test, and 5\u2013240 VE/ml for the DiaSorin test. A positive reaction in the immunoblot required distinct reactions against at least two of the antigens included in the assay (OspC, VlsE-mix, p39, DbpA, p58 or p83). All tests were performed according to the manufacturers' instructions. A validated and accredited in-house sandwich-EIA (HUSLAB, Finland) with VZV glycoprotein EIA antigen (Institute Virion Ltd, R\u00fcschlikon/Z\u00fcrich, Switzerland) and in-house adenovirus EIA (HUSLAB, Finland) with inactivated whole adenovirus antigen were used for VZV and adenovirus IgG detection, respectively.

This study evaluated antigens for the detection of IgG antibodies against important CNS pathogens, namely HSV-1, HSV-2, VZV, adenovirus, M. pneumoniae and species of B. burgdorferi sensu stricto, which is the predominant species in North America, as well as B. garinii and B. afzelii, both predominant in Eurasia (Steere, 2001, Qiu et al., 2002, Hengge et al., 2003, Bunikis et al., 2004), causing Lyme borreliosis.

Recent investigations exploited the microarray platform for profiling of immune responses to Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato (Xu et al., 2008), and another to influenza viruses, suggesting that some level of humoral immunity may not be measured by the traditional hemagglutination inhibition assays (Koopmans et al., 2012). Recently, a similar approach was applied for the different coronaviruses (Reusken et al., 2013). We have earlier demonstrated that detection of viral antibodies and quantitation of C-reactive protein is feasible in a single microarray (Viitala et al., 2013). With the microarray technique, multiple antigens can be present in the same reaction and immunologic history can be examined simultaneously for several viral or bacterial targets. This provides an opportunity for more comprehensive and rapid identification of the causative pathogen.",

Some of the serum samples were reactive in the microarray test without reaction in the reference test; e.g. for HSV-1 there were 5/47, and for HSV-2 15/57 such samples. It must be noted that the specimen panels did not represent an unbiased general population, but rather individuals suspected of a particular infection. Therefore, some of these discordant samples may be truly positive for the respective targets. This is highlighted particularly in the case of adenovirus for which the microarray was reactive for all positive panel samples (100% sensitivity), and for 3/19 of the negative panel specimens. The same whole adenovirus antigen was used both in the reference assay and in the microarray, and thus the superior sensitivity of the microarray platform is plausible.",

In the microarray developed in this study, six borrelial antigens were used, and results from single antigens, as well as antigen combinations were evaluated. As demonstrated in Table 2, the requirement of simultaneous reactivity (sensitivity) and non-reactivity (specificity) against several antigens considerably decreased the performance values. Sensitivity values can be artificially increased by using less strict rules, e.g. with the requirement of reactivity for only one out of two antigens representing the same Borrelia species (Table 2). However, this will subsequently result in less optimal specificity values, and does not reflect the requirements of a diagnostic laboratory, which cannot rely on a single antigen. Our study highlighted the importance of a careful selection of diagnostic criteria and antigens when such an approach is adapted for clinical use. If the diagnostic criteria are chosen without proper validation, very variable results may be obtained when using multiple antigens.",

The DbpA sequence site has high inter- and intraspecies heterogeneity and it is considered to be a sensitive antigen in the late phase of Lyme borreliosis, and particularly in neuroborreliosis (Roberts et al., 1998, Heikkil\u00e4 et al., 2002a, Heikkil\u00e4 et al., 2002b, Heikkil\u00e4 et al., 2003, Schulte-Spechtel et al., 2006, Panelius et al., 2007).

In the case of B. burgdorferi sensu lato infection, specificity is the major challenge of laboratory diagnostics. This study further highlighted the requirement for the use of multiple borrelial antigens in order to increase specificity without a major lack of sensitivity. The overall performance of the platform proved promising in terms of test performance and technical features, and while it only requires a small samples volume, it is potentially adaptable also for CSF specimens.",
