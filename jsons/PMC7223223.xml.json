They accumulate receptors, proteases, antimicrobial peptides and proteins inside cytoplasmic granules that mediate the production of reactive oxygen species or DNA-based extracellular traps (NETs), both of which are highly toxic and allow for effective containment of pathogens1,2. Several types of granules coexist in the neutrophil cytoplasm3, including primary (azurophilic) granules that store myeloperoxidase (MPO), secondary (specific) and tertiary (gelatinase) granules and secretory vesicles, each of which carry distinct types of cargo1,4. The different granules form at different stages of granulopoiesis in the bone marrow5,6, and the synthesis of granule proteins declines as neutrophils differentiate7,8. In contrast, receptors needed for sensing, migration and phagocytosis are mostly synthesized once they reach the circulation7,8.",

However, this does not imply immediate elimination, as they can be found within the vessels or parenchyma of multiple organs, with a preference for the spleen, bone marrow and lungs10. The homeostatic infiltration of granule-laden neutrophils, a process enabled by a cell-intrinsic program that relies on the chemokine receptor CXCR2 and the core clock protein Bmal1 (ref. 12), can be potentially damaging to highly vascularized tissues such as the lungs. Indeed, lungs are highly susceptible to neutrophil-mediated damage, which can cause respiratory dysfunction and death, as shown in murine models of lung injury13\u201315. In humans, neutrophil-mediated acute vascular damage followed by pulmonary edema and distress is common in patients with underlying pneumococcal infections or other pre-existing conditions13,16.",

However, because transcriptional changes take a relatively long time (in the range of hours) and diurnal transcriptional programs in mouse neutrophils favor their migration into tissues, we examined alternative mechanisms that might protect the tissues from the toxic activity of neutrophils. We undertook a proteomic approach to explore the changes in protein content in neutrophils at different times after their release from the bone marrow. Because the number of neutrophils that can be purified from the blood of na\u00efve mice at night (when neutrophils are released from the bone marrow) or at noon (when neutrophils have spent several hours in the circulation)17 is low, we increased the number of night-like neutrophils released from the bone marrow by a one-time intraperitoneal injection at zeitgeber time 4 (ZT4, or 4 h after lights on) of AMD3100, an antagonist for CXCR4 that induces the rapid mobilization of neutrophils from the bone marrow18. To increase the number of day-like neutrophils in circulation we injected blocking antibodies against endothelial selectins (1 mg kg\u22121, intravenously at ZT5 at days \u22125, \u22123 and \u22121 before collection)12,17 (Extended Data Fig. 1a). The proteomic analysis of these night- and day-like neutrophils isolated at ZT5 from the blood of wild-type mice yielded 6,677 proteins (Supplementary Table 1). A total of 171 proteins were differentially detected when comparing the night-like versus the day-like group, with proteins involved in regulation of the cytoskeleton (Arghdib, Rufy3), adhesion (Thbs1, Itgam), inflammasome (Nlrp3, Nlrp4e) and vesicular transport (Vps33b) (Fig. 1a) enriched in night-like neutrophils compared to day-like neutrophils. The differential expression of identified proteins in night- versus day-like neutrophils, such as VEGFR1, CD74, CD16/32, CD63 or CD14, was confirmed by flow cytometry (Extended Data Fig. 1b). Gene ontology analyses (Supplementary Table 2) indicated involvement of the differentially expressed proteins in immune defense, cytokine signaling and angiogenesis (Extended Data Fig. 1c). Night-like neutrophils were enriched for pathways linked to c-Kit signaling and platelet production, possibly reminiscent of their time in the bone marrow, as well as GTPase Rho signaling (Fig. 1b), consistent with the enhanced migratory capacity of \u2018younger\u2019 neutrophils12. Day-like neutrophils showed upregulation of protein synthesis, pathogen sensing and respiration (Fig. 1b), suggesting specialization for effector functions and enhanced TLR signaling, as previously suggested12,19. Comparison of the neutrophil proteome with transcriptional datasets associated with diurnal time12 showed poor correlation (Extended Data Fig. 1d), suggesting that the proteomic changes are not driven by direct transcriptional regulation. These results therefore identify prominent changes in the neutrophil proteome that are associated with the time spent in the circulation.",

To assess if these variations in side scatter were caused by degranulation, we stained cytospins of Ly6G+ blood neutrophils purified at the same times as for MPO, a protein of azurophilic granules, and analyzed granule content by high-resolution confocal microscopy (Fig. 1d). The maximal abundance of MPO+ granules was observed at ZT17 (midnight, when neutrophils leave the marrow), while the valley was at ZT1 (Fig. 1e and Extended Data Fig. 2c), indicating progressive loss of primary granules. MPO+ granule content in neutrophils was in antiphase with elastase activity in plasma (Fig. 1f), suggesting the release of granule content into blood. A 12-h shift in the animal light cycle for three weeks completely readjusted the pattern of granule content in neutrophils (Extended Data Fig. 2d), indicating that degranulation was circadian in nature. Finally, Ly6G+ neutrophils from lungs, spleen and liver had a lower MPO+ granule content compared to Ly6G+ neutrophils in the blood (Extended Data Fig. 2e,f). Thus, neutrophils undergo homeostatic degranulation in the circulation before they enter tissues.",

Among the proteins found in the proteomic analyses, those associated with NETs (Supplementary table 3) were enriched in the proteome of night-like neutrophils (Fig. 2a), suggesting that NET release is more prevalent at this time. To directly examine whether the formation of NETs varied during the course of a day, we treated Ly6G+ neutrophils purified at ZT5 or ZT13 from the blood of wild-type mice with phorbol myristate acetate (PMA), a NET-inducing compound, and analyzed for the presence of extracellular DNA decorated with MPO protein and citrullinated histone 3 (cit-H3). We found that neutrophils at ZT13 (night) formed more NETs than at ZT5 (daytime) (Fig. 2b), revealing a correlation between diurnal azurophilic granule content and NET-forming capacity in blood Ly6G+ neutrophils. Next, we assessed the presence of NETs by whole-mount immunostaining with the same markers in cremaster muscles of wild-type and Lyz2CreMcl1fl/fl mice, which are neutropenic22, after ischemia-reperfusion. Many more NETs were detectable in the muscles of mice at ZT13 than at ZT5, while no NETs were detected in the Lyz2CreMcl1fl/fl mice (Fig. 2c). Thus, proteomic changes and degranulation of circulating neutrophils temporally coincide with loss of NET-forming ability.",

We therefore tested whether this mechanism caused the proteome changes. Treatment with CXCL2 induced degranulation in isolated wild-type Ly6G+, circulating neutrophils (Fig. 3a). Analysis of the granule content of blood neutrophils from MRP8CRE\nCxcr2fl/fl (referred to as CXCR2\u0394N hereafter)12, which have a neutrophil-specific deficiency in CXCR2, at ZT5 and ZT13, showed no differences in MPO+ granule content or in side-scatter properties in blood neutrophils, compared with neutrophils from wild-type mice (Fig. 3b and Extended Data Fig. 2b). CXCR2\u0394N neutrophils degranulated in response to PMA and lipopolysaccharide (LPS) (Extended Data Fig. 3a,b), indicating that degranulation could be induced in these cells. We also found a loss of diurnal oscillations in granule content in blood neutrophils from Cxcl2\u2212/\u2212 mice (Fig. 3b). Neutrophils from CXCR2\u0394N and Cxcl2\u2212/\u2212 mice also showed no differences in NET formation between ZT5 and ZT13 (Fig. 3c).

We used ALI-prone Balb/c mice, which displayed normal diurnal variations in neutrophil number and phenotype (Extended Data Fig. 5a\u2013c)12. Lungs from Balb/c mice treated to induce ALI (by intraperitoneal injection of 0.1 mg kg\u22121 LPS 24 h before intravenous injection of 0.5 mg kg\u22121 of an anti-H2d antibody) showed evidence of NETs, defined by staining for MPO, DNA and cit-H3 (Fig. 4a and Supplementary Videos 1 and 2)24,26. To assess the kinetics of NET formation in vivo during ALI, we performed high-speed multichannel intravital imaging of the lung microcirculation28. Neutrophils were identified by Ly6G staining, while NET-like structures where identified by the rapid extrusion of Sytox-green-labeled DNA from Ly6G+ neutrophils, as a result of intravenous injection of the dye 5 min before imaging (Fig. 4b and Supplementary Video 3). The Sytox-green+ extrusions were inhibited by the PAD4 inhibitor chloramidine injected intravenously 1 h before induction of ALI (Fig. 4c), indicating that they represented NETs. Continuous tracking of neutrophil behavior for 40 min showed higher release of Sytox-green+ extrusions at ZT13 compared with ZT5 (Fig. 4c and Supplementary Video 3). The enhanced NET production at night was detectable minutes after induction of ALI and was sustained for the rest of the experiment (Fig. 4c). In contrast, the number of Ly6G+ neutrophils was similar at ZT5 and ZT13 in untreated and in chloramidine-treated mice (Extended Data Fig. 6a\u2013c). Because platelets have been involved in neutrophil activation and NET formation during ALI15,25, we assessed their possible involvement in the observed differences between ZT5 and ZT13. We found a sharp increase in the number of platelets in the pulmonary vessels in mice with ALI; however, their numbers were comparable at ZT5 and ZT13 (Extended Data Fig. 6b), suggesting that the number of neutrophils or platelets did not influence the diurnal changes in pulmonary NET formation.",

Intravenous injection with Evans blue dye after ALI induction at ZT5 indicated a marked increase in pulmonary vascular permeability during ALI, compared to LPS-only treated mice (Extended Data Fig. 7a), which was specific to the lungs. We then used computerized tomography (CT) to track the in vivo dynamics of edema in mice in which we induced ALI at ZT5 (day) or at ZT13 (night). We found a rapid and sharp increase in water content of the lungs, which occurred earlier and was higher in ZT13- compared with ZT5-induced mice (Fig. 4d,e). This correlated with reduced survival of mice in which ALI was induced at ZT13 compared to those induced at ZT5 (Fig. 4f). Finally, treatment with chloramidine 1 h before induction at ZT5 protected mice from edema and death (Fig. 4e,f), indicating that the release of NETs was a primary cause of ALI. Thus, the severity of lung injury during ALI displays diurnal patterns that correlate with the granule content and the capacity of neutrophils to form NETs.",

In contrast, CXCR4\u0394N neutrophils at ZT5 had strong reductions in azurophilic granule content compared with wild-type neutrophils at any time point (Fig. 5a,b). NET formation in response to PMA was elevated in ZT5 Bmal1\u0394N neutrophils, and strongly reduced in CXCR4\u0394N neutrophils, relative to ZT5 wild-type neutrophils (Fig. 5c).

Intravital microscopy analyses showed faster and elevated NET formation in the lungs of Bmal1\u0394N mice compared with lungs of CXCR4\u0394N mice, which were similar to the differences found at ZT13 and ZT5, respectively, in wild-type mice (Fig. 5d). Intravital microscopy and flow cytometry showed similar numbers of neutrophils and platelets, as well as the number of interactions with each other, within the microvasculature of wild-type, Bmal1\u0394N and CXCR4\u0394N mice (Extended Data Fig. 6d\u2013g), indicating an otherwise normal behavior of intravascular neutrophils in these mice. We found marked elevation in pulmonary edema and reduced survival in Bmal1\u0394N mice during ALI induced at ZT5 compared with CXCR4\u0394N mice (Fig. 5e,f and Supplementary Video 4). The protection from pathology correlated with preservation of vascular permeability in the lungs of CXCR4\u0394N mice after intravenous injection of Evans blue (Extended Data Fig. 7b,c). Intravital imaging in wild-type mice allowed visualization of two distinct NET-like formation events, \u2018flowing\u2019 NETs, in which the extruded NETs were immediately washed away by the bloodstream, and \u2018adherent\u2019 NETs, in which the extruded DNA remained adherent to the vasculature (Extended Data Fig. 7d and Supplementary Video 5). The frequency of adherent NETs was elevated compared with flowing NETs in Bmal1\u0394N mice, but not in wild-type or CXCR4\u0394N mice (Extended Data Fig. 7e), suggesting that the ability of neutrophils to deposit NETs onto the endothelium enhanced vascular damage in Bmal1\u0394N mice.",

These observations indicated that impaired diurnal changes in the proteome and the granule content in neutrophils were related to the magnitude of inflammation.",

Gene ontology analyses revealed that the differentially detected proteins were in pathways related to vesicle-mediated transport, secretion, exocytosis or degranulation (Extended Data Fig. 9b and Supplementary Table 7), consistent with a loss of granule content in human neutrophils over time. Many of the individual proteins identified in the mouse analyses were not detected or did not show diurnal changes in the human samples (not shown), probably indicating a high variability among humans compared with co-housed and strain-matched mice. However, numerous granule proteins, such as MPO, MMP9 or LTF, were more abundant at 8:00 than at 14:00 in human neutrophils (Fig. 6g). Similar to mouse neutrophils, there was a poor correlation between transcript and protein amounts in human neutrophils (Extended Data Fig. 9c), suggesting that the proteomic changes were largely independent of transcriptional regulation. Ex vivo assays of human neutrophils purified using density gradients and treated with vehicle or PMA indicated a marked reduction in NET-forming capacity between 8:00 and 14:00 (Fig. 6h,i), corresponding with more NET-related proteins at 8:00 compared with 14:00 (Extended Data Fig. 9d).

Assessment of the temporal patterns of disease onset and severity (using the pneumonia severity index), by plotting the times of admission against the pneumonia index and death in this subset of patients, revealed consistent diurnal oscillations, with a peak around 9:00 and a trough at 17:00\u201319:00 for both parameters (Fig. 6j).

The circadian transcriptional regulation of migration-associated genes by Bmal1 controls the migratory properties of neutrophils, and allows the infiltration of na\u00efve tissues in anticipation of potential infections12. In addition to these transcription-mediated mechanisms, we uncovered here that the neutrophil proteome is also subject to circadian regulation, which blunts the ability of neutrophils to release toxic mediators and to produce NETs. This level of immune regulation may be particularly relevant for granulocytes, a group of innate immune cells that synthesize and store the majority of their early-response mediators inside dedicated organelles. Because the formation of granules and their content occurs as neutrophils differentiate in the bone marrow7,33, it is unlikely that changes of the granule proteome that occur in the circulation are transcriptionally regulated, as illustrated by the poor correlation between the proteome and the transcriptome in these cells. Our data, however, suggested a model in which upstream control of transcription of Cxcl2 by Bmal1 (ref. 12) allowed indirect regulation of the neutrophil proteome by the canonical circadian machinery. Conceptually, the temporal nature of this process in blood aligns with the evolutionary value of circadian oscillations in segregating mutually antagonistic processes, in this case potent antimicrobial responses and protection of the host against immune-mediated damage.",

Because neutrophil proteases are also important for the activation of many biological mediators, including cytokines, chemokines, growth factors and adhesion and pattern-recognition receptors34,35, and even modulate signaling cascades in other cells36,37, the programmed proteome changes reported here may have pleiotropic consequences in physiology.

Large numbers of neutrophils accumulate within the pulmonary microcirculation in mice, rabbits and nonhuman primates after stimulation or in the steady state10,18,40, and the lungs can provide a niche for effective antimicrobial responses41. The homeostatic accumulation of neutrophils in the lungs at the end of the light cycle in mice10 would predict higher susceptibility to inflammatory stimuli at this time. However, we found that neutrophils recovered from na\u00efve lungs had reduced granularity, and that mutant mice with constitutive low levels of granules in neutrophils displayed permanent protection from ALI, suggesting a dominant contribution of the disarming process in tissue protection.",
