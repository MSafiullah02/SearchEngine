The chirality of drugs has become a major theme in the design, discovery, development, patenting and marketing of new drugs [5]. For many years, including at the time of the approvals of CQ and HCQ, the pharmacopoeias were dominated by racemates. This trend was inverted in the mid-1990s: most of the chiral new molecular entity (NME) drugs were developed and marketed as single enantiomers [5]. The strategy of chiral switches has emerged \u2013 the development of a single enantiomer from a chiral drug that has previously been developed (and often approved and marketed) as a racemate or as a mixture of diastereomers. Nevertheless, the development and approval of racemic drugs has continued to be viable and the continuing approval of racemic NMEs could have implications for the persistence of the chiral-switch strategy [6].",

CQ and HCQ could potentially display therapeutic efficacy for the treatment of COVID-19 2, 3, 8. The toxicity profiles of CQ and HCQ have been well known for many years; their administration is safe, although both can have serious side effects, especially at high doses or when combined with other medicines. Advantages of (S)-(+)-HCQ (the eutomer) vis-\u00e0-vis (R)-(\u2013)-HCQ and the racemate (R,S)-(\u00b1)-HCQ have been recorded in the above-mentioned patents, especially with regard to retinopathy, a severe side effect of HCQ which is caused by an enantioselective accumulation of the (R)-(\u2013)-HCQ enantiomer in the ocular tissue, R/S ratio = 1.58 \u00b1 0.24 (in rabbits, EP0588430B1).
