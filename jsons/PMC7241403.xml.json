Physicians in Europe and the United States made significant contributions to this field of geomedicine. During the early 19th century Daniel Drake, a practicing physician in Cleveland, Ohio, wrote a 2-volume treatise titled Principal Diseases of the Interior Valley of North America. He surmised that diseases are influenced by climate, locality, and society. Drake also emphasized the importance of rocks and soils in causing disease, establishing the link between different rocks\u2014argillaceous and calcareous\u2014in sickness and well-being of a population (Drake, 1854).",

Later, following John Snow's detailed investigation of cause of cholera in the Soho district of London in 1854, and acceptance of the germ theory, collaboration between medicine and geography gradually declined as physicians shifted their focus from the physical environment to germs as leading cause of diseases. However, recent advances in remote sensing and GIS technology have revived medical geography, facilitating surveillance of vector-causing infectious diseases, such as Ebola, dengue fever, zika, COVID-19, and other zoonotic diseases. Valuable health-related databases, such as the map series on the United States population health produced by the Centers for Disease Control (CDC), Dartmouth series of atlases on health care, and others combine medical information with GIS to present valuable interactive maps that can be used by laypersons and researchers alike.",

Writing in the American Journal of Science and Arts, the physician wrote:\u201cMedical Geology\u2014At some future day, I have no doubt that we shall discover that there is such a science as medical geology, viz. that certain strata are, as foundation ground for human habitations, much more liable to be affected with certain causes of diseases than others, and we shall probably not only know the fact, but ascertain the cause and the remedy. The county of Norfolk [United Kingdom] has long been famous or infamous for the astonishing number of patients affected with the stone, nothing has hitherto been done to investigate the cause. The earth, I have long since been persuaded, contains within itself agents destined to affect future changes of the solid surface, and also of the atmosphere. The pestilence and earthquake which reigned together, for 70 years during the reign of Justinian and depopulated the fairest portion of the civilized world\u2014were doubtless the result of certain subterranean laws which regulate its internal economy\u2014laws known only to its creator\u201d.(Anonymous, 1834, p. 182).\n",

An educated person with basic understanding of natural healing substances, such as plants and minerals, could become a physician. In fact, physicians in Europe until the late 18th century were \u201clearned gentlemen\u201d who had acquired effective practical skills to practice medicine. Although the first medical schools in the United States were founded in the 1760s, most doctors were practicing medicine following a 3\u20134 years apprenticeship with a reputed physician (Custers and Cate, 2018). Prior college education for admission into a medical school became a requirement in Europe during the last decade of the 19th century. In the United States too, until the mid-19th century, formal education at a college was not required and an extended apprenticeship was all the medical education one needed to practice medicine. In 1895, the Chicago Medical School (now part of the Northwestern University) made college education a requirement for admission into its medical school. Later, in 1898, Johns Hopkins University required all medical school applicants to have a bachelor's degree. Harvard University in 1901 also required a college degree for medical school admission.",

Lag of the Finland Geological Survey who edited a major book on the subject (Lag, 1990), was one of the two names considered for the emerging subspecialty. But it did not find favor because geomedicine connotes a subspecialty of medicine, such as family medicine, nuclear medicine, etc. So, the term medical geology, first mentioned in 1834 by an anonymous British physician (see quotation above), was officially adopted about 163 years later in 1997 at a meeting of the medical geology working group at the 4th International Symposium on Environmental Geochemistry held at Vail, Colorado, United States. Professor O. Selinus, as a member of The Commission on Geological Sciences for Environmental Planning (COGEOENVIRONMENT) of the International Union of Geosciences (IUGS), had earlier (in 1996) suggested the idea of forming a working group on medical geology. IUGS accepted the proposal and appointed Selinus chair of the working group. The working group at Vail officially adopted the title Medical Geology at a meeting with several geoscientists, public health professionals, and medical scientists. It was fully agreed that the term geomedicine was not the appropriate name to describe this discipline as the name was not considered by the medical and public health communities to be applicable and relevant to their profession (Selinus, 2019, 2020).",

For example, control of geologic factors on (i) the prevalence of cardiovascular and Alzheimer's disease, neurological disorders from imbalance of trace elements; (ii) antibiotic properties of clay minerals; (iii) lithium levels in drinking water and tendency for suicide; (iv) surveillance and mitigation of zoonotic and other diseases triggered by climate change; and (v) control of pollution related mortality and morbidity.

It was used extensively from the 13th to 16th centuries and was mentioned in all medical books until the 18th century. Its claimed medical benefits were considered to be associated with faith and superstition. However, recent studies have shown that the high cation exchange capacity of certain clay minerals, such as montmorillonite, that is known to take up harmful toxic heavy metal ions (e.g., As, Hg), may account for use of montmorillonite-rich samples of terra sigillata as an antidote for poisoning. High absorbency of toxic molecules by kaolin and other clay minerals could also explain use of certain terra sigillata for effective treatment of gastrointestinal problems, particularly gastroenteritis.",

This principle relies on the finding that all chemicals, even water and life-supporting oxygen, can be toxic if too much is consumed. Trace elements provide best example to illustrate this maxim. For a long time, the response to toxic substances on living organisms was studied in the laboratory on test animals, typically mice, and rabbits, but other species such as minnows, and even monkeys, have also been used to determine the optimum doses of chemicals. This is a very slow, inhumane, and extremely expensive process that has deterred testing of thousands of chemicals that are in everyday use. However, recent advances in robotics technology aided by high power computation led to the establishment of Tox21, in 2008, a collaborative program between three U.S. federal agencies: the Environmental Protection Agency, National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences, and the Food and Drug Administration. Tox21 is capable of testing a chemical or biological substance at various concentrations and evaluating its effect on living cells very rapidly. Over a million chemicals can be tested at concentration levels spreading over four orders of magnitude. Tox21 holds the promise to rapidly test the multitude of commercial chemicals whose toxicity is poorly understood. Refinements in testing procedures are being made continuously and updates of the Tox21 program are available on-line at: https://tox21.gov/.

During this time, the capability to probe, detect, and analyze almost any material to a high level of precision took a quantum leap forward. Sophisticated analytical equipment, supported by powerful computers enables the analysis of geological materials rapidly at a high level of precision and accuracy. Detection of chemical elements and compounds in environmental samples to sub-ppm levels has become routine procedure in modern analytical laboratories. This development has led to an enhanced interest in understanding the geochemistry of the natural environment and initiation of ambitious projects to prepare geochemical atlases at local, state, regional, and national levels in the European Union, the United States, China, and many other countries. These geochemical surveys that commenced in the 1960s are still continuing. Information on occurrence, distribution, and concentration of chemical elements in soil, sediment, water, and plants has been used for a variety of applications, such as agriculture, environmental pollution, fisheries, medicine, public health, water supply, wildlife nutrition, and other areas (Thornton, 1993). The pioneering work done by the national geological surveys of Sweden, the United Kingdom, and the United States on the influence of trace elements on health between the 1960s and 1980s laid the foundation for focused studies on the relationship between geological materials and processes on human health. It should be noted that similar studies on animals and plants had been carried out much earlier by animal and plant scientists, who investigated the association of essential and trace elements on diseases in animals and plants. Despite the numerous studies linking chemical elements and compounds on occurrence of disease in human beings, such studies remained as isolated investigations in geochemistry and epidemiology. However, an interdisciplinary symposium held in Montreal, Canada, at the 1964 meeting of the American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS), organized by its Geology and Geography sections, and the Geochemical Society, provided a major impetus for recognizing the importance of geological factors in human health. The landmark publication Environmental Geochemistry in Health and Disease (Cannon and Hopps, 1971) by the Geological Society of America was seminal in this context. At the same time, various initiatives in Europe by the British, Finnish, and Swedish geological surveys served as the needed catalyst for establishment of a new subspecialty within the earth sciences.",

These two programs were merged into the Environmental Health Mission Area in 2010, whose objective is to assess and advise the nation about risks to the environment from contaminants and pathogens. The program investigates contaminant and pathogen sources, transport, exposure, pathways, uptake, biological effects, and human health implications. Its electronic newsletter GeoHealth, now in its 19th year of publication (the initial issue, called Epidemiology News, was published in May 2002 and later renamed GeoHealth in 2004), contains information on the latest researches in environmental health that are timely and offer useful information to citizens, students, and professionals in medical geology.",

In all, 25 annual conferences were held, covering a variety of topics on the role of trace substances in human and ecological health. Its proceedings volume contains a wealth of information on trace substances and their impact on human and ecological health. The Society for Environmental Geochemistry and Health (SEGH) that was formed in Dallas, Texas in December 1968 at the symposium on \u201cEnvironmental Geochemistry in Health and Disease\u201d collaborated with the ETSC and held its first annual meeting in 1970 during the \u201c3rd Annual Conference on Trace Substances in Environmental Health\u201d at UMC. SEGH continued to hold its annual meetings at UMC until 1993 when the ETSC closed and the conference series ended. The symbiotic relation between these two organizations attracted all well-known researchers in the field from the world over, and the conference proceedings still serve as a valuable resource to students and professionals alike. Many of the SEGH members and officers served on the U.S. National Research Academy's Subcommittee on the Geochemical Environment in Relation to Health and Disease created under the U.S. National Committee for Geochemistry, a Division of Earth Sciences of the National Research Council, when it was established in 1969.

Major regions affected are in Argentina, Bangladesh, Burkina Faso, Cambodia, Chile, China, Hungary, India, Laos, Mexico, Nepal, Romania, Spain, Taiwan, Thailand, and Vietnam. Arsenic can become mobilized into the environment, notably water, through a complex set of biogeochemical reactions and human activities, such as mining, fossil fuel combustion, and use of pesticides, herbicides, arsenic-based additives in livestock feed, and in treated wood.

The animals grazed for months on native legume Astragalus bisulcatus, which is known to be a selenium accumulating plant. This legume was in full bloom during the spring, at their most succulent and Se-enriched state when the animals grazed on them.
