She denied any previous hospital visits or recent travel outside of Taiwan. The patient recollected a 3-hour train journey to Taipei 12 days prior, when she was in close proximity to a female who had a persistent cough. The patient went to the emergency room of Hospital A in the morning of April 9, 2003. A chest X-ray showed extensive bilateral lower lung infiltrates (Fig. 1\n, Panel A). Soon after arrival in our hospital, she required 100% oxygen through a non-rebreathing mask to maintain her oxygen saturation. A second chest X-ray taken in the afternoon showed progressive changes (Fig. 1, Panel B). By that evening, the patient developed progressive tachypnea and had to be intubated. The sputum Gram-stain obtained after intubation showed many inflammatory cells without visible bacteria (Fig. 2). She was treated with empiric antibiotics, ribavirin and corticosteroids. On the eighth hospital day, her fever subsided, and her oropharyngeal swab came back positive for SARS-associated coronavirus by RT-PCR. On the same day, her husband and son were admitted to other hospitals in Taipei due to fever and pulmonary infiltrates. Both subsequently proved positive for coronavirus by RT-PCR. On April 23, the patient was extubated.",

Rigorous multivariate analysis could not be meaningfully performed, however, given the small sample size in our series. Age and comorbidities were also not associated with an adverse outcome in our series as observed elsewhere.4., 20., 24., 29. This may also reflect our sample size. Further reports involving larger patient populations will be necessary to clarify our understanding of the risk factors and optimal treatment of SARS.",
