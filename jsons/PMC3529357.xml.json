In humans, inherited monoallelic TP53 mutations lead to diverse early childhood cancers (Hollstein et al., 1991). Somatic mutations in the TP53 gene are responsible for the development of up to 50% of certain types of human cancer (Hollstein et al., 1991; Olivier et al., 2010). Analysis of the mutation spectrum of TP53, caused by various environmental factors, and the resulting tumor spectrum are valuable for elucidating cancer etiology (Olivier et al., 2010).",

            "text": "The TP53 protein is ubiquitously expressed throughout the body as an inactive transcription factor that is activated and stabilized by various cellular stresses (Lavin and Gueven, 2006). In the past three decades, various Trp53 loss-of-function mouse models have been developed (Clarke and Hollstein, 2003), including gene disruptions (Donehower et al., 1992; Jacks et al., 1994), humanization of the DNA binding domain (Luo et al., 2001) and a variety of point mutations (Petitjean et al., 2007), demonstrating good correlation between decreased TP53 activity and increased incidences of tumor formation. However, constitutively high expression of mutants that enhance TP53 activity is associated with increased tumor resistance and premature aging (Tyner et al., 2002), whereas an additional single copy of wild-type Trp53 gene under endogenous gene context (on a BAC) gained the transgenic animal tumor resistance without compromising longevity (Garc\u00eda-Cao et al., 2002). These models have proven useful for studying TP53 protein function and its interaction network and have enabled many cancer studies that are not feasible to be carried out in humans. Yet, there are limitations of mouse models for certain types of cancers found in people with abnormal TP53 function, including breast cancer (Kim and Baek, 2010), brain and adrenocortical tumors (Olivier et al., 2003) and metastases (Bos et al., 2010; Francia et al., 2011).",

            "text": "The rat is a popular model system in biomedical research, with a wealth of information on its physiology, pathology and responses to drugs and other compounds. Tp53 knockout rats would be useful in both basic research and preclinical studies for drug development. As in the case of Trp53 knockout mice (MacDonald et al., 2004), a rat lacking functional TP53 could be used in the carcinogenicity bioassays required for each new drug, shortening the assay time from 2 years to several months (King-Herbert et al., 2010). Multiple efforts have been made to create Tp53 knockout rats. Tong and colleagues created a TP53-deficient Dark Agouti rat (referred to subsequently as the TP53-deficient DA rat) via homologous recombination in the rat embryonic stem cells (Tong et al., 2010). During the review process of this manuscript, the same group published phenotypic analysis of the TP53-deficient DA rats (Yan et al., 2012). Homozygous TP53-deficient DA rats lived no longer than 6 months and developed hemagiosarcomas and lymphomas. Heterozygous TP53-deficient DA rats survived to 12 months of age and exhibited a broader variety of sarcomas, including mammary carcinoma in about 20% of female rats. van Boxtel and colleagues recently reported phenotyping of a TP53-deficient rat model, containing a nonsense mutation in exon 6, C273X, created via ENU-mediated random mutagenesis (van Boxtel et al., 2011). The Tp53C273X/C273X rat, which was developed in a Wistar Han background (referred to subsequently as the TP53-deficient Wistar rat), expressed primarily sarcomas and survived until about 4 months of age, whereas the Tp53C273X/+ rats predominantly developed osteosarcoma, with onset of tumor occurring at around 43 weeks.",

ZFN technology has been shown to be a powerful tool for rat genome engineering, with high efficiency and incredible germline transmission rates (Cui et al., 2011; Geurts et al., 2009; Mashimo et al., 2010). Our results revealed a homozygous null rat, Tp53\u039411/\u039411, with complete loss of TP53 protein and a shortened disease-free lifespan due to early onset of cancer. The tumor spectrum in the null mutant rat included sarcomas and carcinomas, with a predominance of nervous system neoplasia. The Tp53\u039411/+ rats experienced a longer latency to tumorigenesis than Tp53\u039411/\u039411 rats and developed skin and endocrine cancer in addition to the cancer types recognized in the null model, demonstrating a broader spectrum than those reported in both TP53-deficient Wistar rats and the TP53-deficient DA rats.

Further, small deletions resulting from ZFN-mediated non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) events are likely to cause little disturbance of expression of neighboring genes, whereas the conventional knockout technology often relies on the insertion of a selection marker, with a higher chance of a neighboring effect.

The expanded cancer spectrum in this model is most similar to those described in the Li-Fraumeni and Li-Fraumeni-like syndromes in man (Olivier et al., 2010). Li-Fraumeni patients have a range of inherited TP53 gene mutations and develop osteogenic and muscle sarcomas, breast cancer, brain cancer (predominantly glioblastoma in pediatric patients), lymphoma and adrenocortical tumors prior to the age of 45 years.

Because rats are common rodent models for toxicity and carcinogenicity studies, historical databases of spontaneous lesions and tumors are available for SD, Wistar Han (Son et al., 2010) and DA rats (Deerberg, 1991). Interestingly, the spontaneous tumors of the parent stock and strains of rats are dissimilar to those that develop in Tp53 knockout rats of each respective background. In Wistar rats, the most common spontaneous tumor is lymphoma followed by mammary tumors, yet the TP53-deficient Wistar rats developed predominantly hemangiosarcoma and osteosarcoma. In the inbred DA rats, the most common spontaneous tumors are pituitary tumors, histiocytic sarcoma and endometrial carcinomas (Deerberg, 1991). However, the homozygous TP53-deficient DA rats develop liver hemangiosarcoma at a rate of about 80%, with most of the rest of the cohort developing lymphoma, whereas heterozygous TP53-deficient DA rat lesions were predominantly T cell lymphoma (55%), hemangiosarcoma (25%) and breast cancer (19%). In our study, the prevalence of neoplasia in the Tp53\u039411/\u039411 SD rats is essentially the reverse of that found in wild-type SD rats (Dinse et al., 2010; Ginkis, 2004). Osteosarcoma, brain neoplasia and hemangiosarcoma are less common in wild-type SD rats, but were the most frequent tumors in our SD Tp53 knockout model. These studies highlight the fact that differences in genetic background can significantly influence the development of tumors in the rat, and comparison of multiple models might help better understand cancer etiology in humans, who are genetically diverse. Our data also confirm the value of building new cancer models in search for those that better reflect human pathology.",

With the goals of decreasing the incidence of both false positives and false negatives as well as reducing the time the assay takes, many alternatives to the 2-year rodent cancer risk models have been evaluated, with varying results. Models such as the Trp53 knockout mouse and the Tg-rasH2 transgenic have been shown to be useful in some cancer bioassays (Cohen et al., 2001). Some working groups examining cancer hazard identification have recommended the use of multiple models and strains in order to best assess pharmaceutical compounds (King-Herbert and Thayer, 2006). Based on positive results seen through the use of the heterozygous Trp53 mouse in accurately determining compound toxicity, there is the potential for the heterozygous Tp53 knockout rat to be similarly useful. Comprehensive testing of a panel of chemicals and accompanying mechanistic research will need to be performed in order to determine the potential usefulness of the Tp53 knockout rat for screening of new pharmaceutical compounds.",

Rhabdomyosarcomas involving the epaxial muscles of the back, hind limb and intercostal muscles of the thoracic wall were composed of interlacing bundles of plump spindloid to globoid cells with oval to cigar-shaped nuclei with up to two prominent centrally located nucleoli and moderate amounts of eosinophilic cytoplasm, which often had striations typical for striated muscle.

Most neoplastic cells had strong immunoreactivity for desmin and 40\u201350% of the cells, most notably strap cells, were immunoreactive for muscle actin. Hemangiosarcomas were most often observed as soft, often bloody masses in the subcutis, and also observed once in the pancreas of a Tp53\u039411/\u039411 rat.

The neoplastic adipocytes in an abdominal liposarcoma in a Tp53\u039411/+ rat had metastasized to the lung. Pleomorphic sarcomas characterized as a myxosarcoma contained interlacing bundles of spindle to polygonal, often multinucleated, cells in a mucinous matrix. Undifferentiated sarcomas were also in the subcutis, and were composed of sheets or bundles of pleomorphic spindle cells that were immunoreactive to vimentin, but lacked reactivity to a battery of antibody assays used to identify muscle, endothelial cells and nervous tissue (S100 protein). Multicentric lymphoma was recognized in splenic red pulp, bone marrow and vasculature of many parenchymal organs.

Neoplastic cells were pleomorphic to fusiform and were arranged in sheets and in pseudorossettes around capillaries or cores of eosinophilic fibrils. Individual cells varied from round to ovular in shape with large oval to carrot-shaped nuclei, and mitoses were common (averaged 10\u201320 per 400\u00d7 field).
