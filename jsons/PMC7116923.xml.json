            "text": "Many of the recommendations made in the ERC Guidelines 2005 remain unchanged, either because no new studies have been published or because new evidence since 2005 has merely strengthened the evidence that was already available. Examples of this are the general design of the BLS and AED algorithms, the way the need for cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) is recognised, the use of AEDs (including the shock protocols), the 30:2 ratio of compressions and ventilations, and the recognition and management of a choking victim. In contrast, new evidence has been published since 2005 that necessitates changes to some components of the 2010 Guidelines. The 2010 changes in comparison with the 2005 Guidelines are summarised here:\u2022Dispatchers should be trained to interrogate callers with strict protocols to elicit information. This information should focus on the recognition of unresponsiveness and the quality of breathing. In combination with unresponsiveness, absence of breathing or any abnormality of breathing should start a dispatch protocol of suspected cardiac arrest. The importance of gasping as sign of cardiac arrest should result in increased emphasis on its recognition during training and dispatch interrogation.\u2022All rescuers, trained or not, should provide chest compressions to victims of cardiac arrest. A strong emphasis on delivering high quality chest compressions remains essential. The aim should be to push to a depth of at least 5 cm at a rate of at least 100 compressions per minute, to allow full chest recoil, and to minimise interruptions in chest compressions. Trained rescuers should also provide ventilations with a compression\u2013ventilation ratio of 30:2. Telephone-guided CPR is encouraged for untrained rescuers who should be told to deliver uninterrupted chest compressions only.\u2022In order to maintain high-quality CPR, feedback to rescuers is important. The use of prompt/feedback devices during CPR will enable immediate feedback to rescuers, and the data stored in rescue equipment can be used to monitor the quality of CPR performance and provide feedback to professional rescuers during debriefing sessions.\u2022When rescuers apply an AED, the analysis of the heart rhythm and delivery of a shock should not be delayed for a period of CPR; however, CPR should be given with minimal interruptions before application of the AED and during its use.\u2022Further development of AED programmes is encouraged\u2014there is a need for further deployment of AEDs in both public and residential areas.\n",

            "text": "Sudden cardiac arrest (SCA) is a leading cause of death in Europe. Depending on the way SCA is defined, it affects about 350,000\u2013700,000 individuals a year.4, 5 On initial heart-rhythm analysis, about 25\u201330% of SCA victims have ventricular fibrillation (VF), a percentage that has declined over the last 20 years.6, 7, 8, 9, 10 It is likely that many more victims have VF or rapid ventricular tachycardia (VT) at the time of collapse but, by the time the first electrocardiogram (ECG) is recorded by ambulance personnel, their rhythm has deteriorated to asystole.11, 12 When the rhythm is recorded soon after collapse, in particular by an on-site AED, the proportion of victims in VF can be as high as 59%13 to 65%.14 Many victims of SCA can survive if bystanders act immediately while VF is still present, but successful resuscitation is much less likely once the rhythm has deteriorated to asystole.",

Most of these links apply to victims of both primary cardiac and asphyxial arrest.15\n1.\nEarly recognition of cardiac arrest: This includes recognition of the cardiac origin of chest pain; recognition that cardiac arrest has occurred; and rapid activation of the ambulance service by telephoning 112 or the local emergency number. Recognizing cardiac chest pain is particularly important, since the probability of cardiac arrest occurring as a consequence of acute myocardial ischaemia is at least 21\u201333% in the first hour after onset of symptoms.16, 17 When a call to the ambulance service is made before a victim collapses, arrival of the ambulance is significantly sooner after collapse and survival tends to be higher.18\n2.\nEarly bystander CPR: Immediate CPR can double or triple survival from VF SCA.18, 19, 20, 21 Performing chest-compression-only CPR is better than giving no CPR at all.22, 23 When a caller has not been trained in CPR, the ambulance dispatcher should strongly encourage him to give chest compression-only CPR while awaiting the arrival of professional help.24, 25, 26, 27\n3.\nEarly defibrillation: CPR plus defibrillation within 3\u20135 min of collapse can produce survival rates as high as 49\u201375%.28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35 Each minute of delay before defibrillation reduces the probability of survival to discharge by 10\u201312%.19, 36\n4.\nEarly advanced life support and standardised post-resuscitation care: The quality of treatment during the post-resuscitation phase affects outcome.37, 38, 39 Therapeutic hypothermia is now an established therapy that greatly contributes to improved survival with good neurological outcome.40, 41, 42\n\n",

Healthcare professionals, as well as lay rescuers, have difficulty determining the presence or absence of adequate or normal breathing in unresponsive victims.53, 54 This may be because the airway is not open or because the victim is making occasional (agonal) gasps. When bystanders are asked by ambulance dispatchers over the telephone if breathing is present, they often misinterpret agonal gasps as normal breathing. This incorrect information can result in the bystander withholding CPR from a cardiac arrest victim.55 Agonal gasps are present in up to 40% of cardiac arrest victims in the first minutes after onset, and are associated with higher survival if recognised as a sign of cardiac arrest.56 Bystanders describe agonal gasps as barely breathing, heavy or laboured breathing, or noisy or gasping breathing.57 Laypeople should, therefore, be taught to begin CPR if the victim is unconscious (unresponsive) and not breathing normally. It should be emphasised during training that agonal gasps occur commonly in the first few minutes after SCA, and that they are an indication to start CPR immediately; they should not be confused with normal breathing.",

The purpose of the chest compressions is primarily to attempt to remove the airway obstruction in the unconscious and supine victim, and only secondarily to promote circulation. Therefore, chest compressions are required even when a professional rescuer still feels a pulse. If the obstruction is not relieved, progressive bradycardia and asystole will occur. During CPR for choking, each time the airway is opened the victim's mouth should be quickly checked for any foreign body that has been partly expelled. During CPR in other cases, therefore, a routine check of the mouth for foreign bodies is not necessary.",

This concept has been challenged, because evidence has suggested that a period of chest compression before defibrillation may improve survival when the time between calling for the ambulance and its arrival exceeds 5 min.140, 141 Two recent clinical studies142, 143 and a recent animal study144 did not confirm this survival benefit. For this reason, a pre-specified period of CPR, as a routine before rhythm analysis and shock delivery, is not recommended. High-quality CPR, however, must continue while the defibrillation pads are being applied and the defibrillator is being prepared. The importance of early delivery of minimally interrupted chest compression is emphasised. Given the lack of convincing data either supporting or refuting this strategy, it is reasonable for emergency medical services that have already implemented a specified period of chest compression before defibrillation to continue this practice.",
