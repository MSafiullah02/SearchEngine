            "text": "Yellow head disease (YHD) emerged in 1990 in farmed black tiger shrimp (Penaeus monodon) in Thailand (Limsuwan, 1991). It is a devastating disease that can cause total crop losses within a few days following the appearance of gross signs (Chantanachookin et al., 1993). The causative agent, yellow head virus (YHV), is a bacilliform, enveloped, (+) ssRNA virus classified in the genus Okavirus, family Roniviridae within the order Nidovirales (Walker et al., 2005). A related nidovirus, gill-associated virus (GAV), occurs commonly as a chronic infection in healthy wild and farmed P. monodon in eastern Australia (Spann et al., 1995, Cowley et al., 2000a, Walker et al., 2001). GAV has been associated with a disease described as mid-crop mortality syndrome (MCMS) in which mortalities progressively accumulate from the mid-late juvenile stage onwards (Spann et al., 1997, Walker et al., 2001). A variant YHV genotype has also been detected in healthy P. monodon broodstock from Thailand (Soowannayan et al., 2003) and YHV or related viruses have been reported in P. monodon and Penaeus japonicus farmed in Taiwan (Wang et al., 1996, Wang and Chang, 2000). However, these viruses were not associated with typical YHD and their relationships to YHV or GAV remain unconfirmed. There are also reports of YHD or YHV in P. monodon in several other countries in the Asian region including the Philippines, India, Indonesia, Sri Lanka, Malaysia, Vietnam and China (Walker et al., 2001) but these have rarely been confirmed by laboratory analysis.",

            "text": "Like other nidoviruses, the polyadenylated, (+) RNA genomes of YHV (26,662 nt) and GAV (26,235 nt) are expressed from a nested set of genomic and subgenomic mRNAs (Cowley and Walker, 2002, Cowley et al., 2002a, Sittidilokratna et al., 2008). The genomes are organized similarly (5\u2032-ORF1a/ORF1b-ORF2-ORF3-(ORF4)-polyA-3\u2032). ORF1a encodes a long polyprotein (pp1a) containing 3C-like and papain-like proteases required for auto-processing, and overlaps ORF1b which encodes a \u2018SDD\u2019 RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, helicase, metal-ion-binding, exonuclease, uridylate-specific endoribonuclease and ribose-2\u2032-O-methyl transferase domains (Cowley et al., 2000b, Ziebuhr et al., 2003, Sittidilokratna et al., 2002, Sittidilokratna et al., 2008). A -1 ribosomal frame-shift element at the ORF1a/ORF1b overlap facilitates translation of the complete pp1ab polyprotein (Cowley et al., 2002a). ORF2 encodes the nucleoprotein (p20) and ORF3 encodes a polyprotein that is processed to generate two envelope glycoproteins (gp116 and gp64) and a small N-terminal triple-membrane-spanning (TMS) fragment of unknown function (Cowley and Walker, 2002, Jitrapakdee et al., 2003, Cowley et al., 2004a, Sittidilokratna et al., 2006). ORF4 is a short open reading frame that, although possibly expressed in GAV (Cowley and Walker, 2008), is severely truncated in YHV and unlikely to encode a functional protein (Sittidilokratna et al., 2008). Intergenic regions (IGRs) upstream of ORF2 and ORF3 contain conserved transcription regulatory sequences (TRSs) that facilitate transcription of two sub-genomic mRNAs (sgmRNAs) which, together with the genome-length mRNA, form a 3\u2032-coterminal nested set characteristic of nidoviruses (Cowley et al., 2002a, Sittidilokratna et al., 2008). The genome sequences of YHV and GAV are \u223c 79% identical, with amino acid sequence identity ranging from \u223c 73% in gp116 to \u223c 84% in pp1ab (Sittidilokratna et al., 2008). Based on levels of sequence divergence, YHV and GAV have been regarded as closely related variants that are likely to represent geographic topotypes in a larger complex (Cowley et al., 1999, Walker et al., 2001). Currently, they are each classified as the species Gill-associated virus (Walker et al., 2005).",

Sequencing of the structural gene region of representatives of genotypes 3, 4 and 5 identified significant diversity, particularly in IGRs and the N-terminal gp116 region, but preservation of TRS-like elements and a 3\u2032-terminal hairpin structure likely to be involved in negative-strand RNA synthesis.",

PCR products were amplified from 25 (66%) of the broodstock (Fig. 1A). Nucleotide sequences were determined for six of these in addition to PCR products amplified from juvenile shrimp from YHD outbreaks in Thailand and Taiwan and healthy broodstock and postlarvae from hatcheries in Australia, Vietnam and Sarawak in Malaysia (Table 1\n). Using 25 sequences, ClustalX was used to align the 231 nt segment bounded by the nested PCR primers (equivalent to the sequence A17492 to A17722 in the GAV reference strain; GenBank AF227196). An unrooted neighbour-joining phylogenetic tree generated from this alignment segregated the sequences into three clusters (Fig. 1B). One cluster (genotype 1) included the YHV reference strain (GenBank AY052786) and all eight viruses from juvenile shrimp from YHD outbreaks. Whilst slight nucleotide variation occurred between some of these viruses, the sequences of one Thai (THA-00-D11) and three of the four Taiwanese viruses (TWN-00-D1, TWN-00-D2, TWN-00-D3) were identical. The second cluster (genotype 2) included the GAV reference strain, the two other Australian viruses from either healthy or MCMS-affected shrimp, and one of the five Vietnamese viruses from healthy postlarvae (VNM-01-H65). The third phylogenetic cluster (genotype 3), which has not been described previously, comprised all viruses from healthy broodstock from Thailand and Sarawak and the other four Vietnamese viruses detected in healthy postlarvae. The Vietnamese viruses appeared to form a sub-group within genotype 3.",

Another lineage (genotype 5) comprised viruses derived from a healthy sub-adult from Malaysia (MYS-03-H4), a sub-adult from Thailand displaying slower than normal growth (THA-03-SG21), and a batch of healthy postlarvae sampled from the Philippines (PHL-03-H8). The relationships among the three genotype 5 viruses were more disparate than viruses clustering within the other lineages. Pair-wise alignments indicated that THA-03-SG21 and MYS-03-H4 share 97.3% sequence identity and that the levels of identity of these two viruses to PHL-03-H8 (92.8% and 93.4%) was less than that distinguishing viruses clustered in genotypes 2 and 6 (\u223c 96.5%) and comparable to that distinguishing viruses clustered in genotypes 2 and 3 (\u223c 93.3%).

The pp3 sequences of the genotype 3 (1642 aa) and genotype 4 viruses (1638 aa) were similar in length to GAV (1640 aa) and somewhat shorter than YHV (1666 aa). A ClustalX alignment of the pp3 sequences indicated overall identity to vary between 75.4% (genotypes 1 and 4) and 86.7% (genotypes 2 and 4). Identity was lower in gp116 (71.3%\u201383.4%) than gp64 (81.8%\u201392.4%). Of the four genotypes, YHV was most distantly related in all three polypeptides generated by pp3 processing. All 50 cysteine residues located in the predicted ectodomains were perfectly conserved and, of the 25 likely disulphide bridges, two occurred in the TMS fragment, 12 in gp116, and 11 in gp64. Predicted N-linked glycosylation sites are less well conserved amongst the genotypes. Both sites in the GAV TMS ectodomain also exist in genotypes 3 and 4 but only one is present in YHV. In the gp116 ectodomain, GAV contains eight potential sites. YHV contains seven of which six are present in GAV (Cowley and Walker, 2002, Jitrapakdee et al., 2003). All seven potential sites in genotype 3 are shared with GAV as are six of the seven sites in genotype 4, the other being unique.

In YHV, the TRS-like sequence is highly conserved but ORF4 is severely truncated (20 aa) (Sittidilokratna et al., 2008). As shown in Figure 5A, the 3\u2032-terminal regions of genotype 3, 4 and 5 viruses also contain TRS-like elements immediately upstream of truncated ORF4 sequences. This region is highly conserved across all five genotypes, with a conserved block of 22 nt sequence encompassing the TRS-like element (5\u2032-UAGCUA(U/)UU(G/U)CAACCUUAUUCU-A-3\u2032) containing only a U insertion in genotype 3 and a G/U substitution in YHV. This sequence includes 9 of 15 nt that were invariant and two others highly dominant in the WebLogo analysis of IGR1 and IGR2 (Fig. 5B). However, in the putative IGR3 of all genotypes, the conserved the 5\u2032-A nucleotide of the sgmRNA terminal sequence motif (5\u2032-ACAAC) is corrupted by a (G/U) substitution (Fig. 6A).",

Both strands of YHV helix 4 possessed compensatory C:G > U:A changes and the leading strand possessed a CC > AU change allowing the formation of additional A:U and U:A base pairs that extended the helix. Moreover, a two nucleotide (UA) insertion maintained a hairpin loop size (6 nt) in YHV comparable to the loops of GAV (7 nt) and genotypes 3 (7 nt) and 4 (6 nt).

This paper provides evidence for the existence of at least six distinct genetic lineages of YHV distributed across most of the natural geographic range of P. monodon from Africa, through South and Southeast Asia, to eastern Australia. Viruses assigned to genotypes other that genotype 1 (YHV) or 2 (GAV) were detected exclusively as low level infections in apparently healthy shrimp. All viruses clustering with the 1998 Chachoengsao (Thailand) reference YHV isolate (genotype 1) occurred in shrimp displaying typical signs of YHD sampled from pond outbreaks in Thailand and Taiwan between 2000 and 2003. Some genotype 2 (GAV) viruses were detected in moribund Australian shrimp sampled from MCMS-affected ponds. However, whilst similar in histopathology to YHD, MCMS is far less severe, developing less rapidly and rarely causing mass mortalities (Owens, 1997, Spann et al., 1997). GAV is also far less virulent (\u223c 106-fold by LD50) than YHV in experimental bioassays (Sittidilokratna and Walker, unpublished) and occurs at a high prevalence in healthy wild and farmed P. monodon along eastern Australia (Spann et al., 1995, Cowley et al., 2000a, Walker et al., 2001) due to its likely maintenance in a natural cycle by vertical transmission (Cowley et al., 2002b, Cowley and Walker, 2008). Although one virus (THA-03-SG21) assigned to genotype 5 was detected in a shrimp affected by a condition of unknown aetiology described as monodon slow growth syndrome (MSGS) (Chayaburakul et al., 2004), there is no evidence to suggest its causal association with this condition for which at least one other virus (Laem Singh virus) has been implicated (Sritunyalucksana et al., 2006).",

Extensive surveys have failed to provide evidence of genotypes other than genotype 2 in eastern Australian P. monodon. It appears, therefore, that GAV is an endemic natural infection of this tiger shrimp population and that other genotypes have not been introduced to Australia because of a prohibition on the importation of live crustaceans (Doyle et al., 1996). Many genotype 2 viruses found at lower prevalence in healthy P. monodon sampled from hatcheries in Thailand and Vietnam showed no clear segregation from Australian viruses, suggesting their possible recent introduction through the export of eastern Australian broodstock. The exclusive clustering of Indian viruses in genotype 4 and Mozambique viruses (with one exception) in genotype 6 may also reflect their isolation from the active trade in P. monodon broodstock and seed that occurs throughout East and South-East Asia. It has been hypothesized that, prior to the advent of aquaculture, efficient vertical transmission allowed individual genotypes to co-evolve with penaeid shrimp host populations in geographic isolation (Cowley et al., 2002b, Cowley and Walker, 2008). The similarity of Australian genotype 2 and Mozambique genotype 6 viruses is intriguing and mirrors the close relationship between Australian and African strains of infectious hypodermal and haematopoietic necrosis virus (IHHNV) infecting P. monodon (Cowley et al., 2004b). Although there has been no recorded traffic in shrimp to between Australia and Africa for aquaculture purposes, the translocation of viruses via shipping routes cannot be excluded.",

Sequence relationships in the structural protein genes were largely consistent with genotype assignments based on the phylogeny of the ORF1b gene sequence and supported the view that YHV is more distant from each of the other genotypes. The YHV nucleoprotein encoded by ORF2 is 2 aa longer and sequence variations, which occur primarily near the N- and C-termini, include substitutions in the binding site of monoclonal antibody (MAb) Y20 which has been used for differential detection of YHV and GAV (Sithigorngul et al., 2000, Sithigorngul et al., 2002, Sithigorngul et al., 2007, Soowannayan et al., 2003, Sittidilokratna et al., 2006). MAb Y20 should also detect genotypes 3, 4 and 5 as their sequences are identical to GAV in this region. In contrast, the binding site for MAbs Y19 and YII4 (IVPDPSL) is preserved across all five genotypes and appears to be a useful group-specific epitope (Sittidilokratna et al., 2006).",

Sequence divergence is most significant in gp116 due to insertions of several amino acid blocks at its N-terminus, the longest of which occurs immediately downstream of the TM3 domain signal peptidase type I cleavage site. It is not yet clear how these insertions might affect the structure of gp116 but it is conceivable they may be responsible for the high virulence of YHV. The efficiency of proteolytic cleavage of virion surface proteins influences virulence and pathogenicity in several diverse groups of RNA viruses (Nagai et al., 1976, Nagai and Klenk, 1977, Rubin and Fields, 1980, Toyoda et al., 1987, Gorman et al., 1988, Scolaro et al., 1990, Gotto and Kawaoka, 1998). Persistent YHV infection in some palemonid shrimp species in the absence of disease has been associated with suppressed gp116 expression relative to the p20 nucleoprotein (Longyant et al., 2005), and it is possible this is also due to aberrant pp3 processing. Variations in sequence at the critical cleavage site at the N-terminus of gp116 may modulate the availability and turnover of mature envelope glycoproteins with consequences for virion maturation, release from infected cells, and progression to chronic persistent infection or acute infection and disease.",

It has been postulated that the ronivirus TRS elements direct the attenuation of polymerase extension during minus-strand RNA synthesis and that the anti-TRS component of minus-strand templates might directly promote subsequent polymerase recognition and transcription of the corresponding sgmRNAs (Pasternak et al., 2006). Significantly, neither this core 12 nt block nor the absolutely conserved adenosine residue at sgmRNA1 and sgmRNA2 5\u2032-termini are preserved in the TRS-like element in the untranslated sequence immediately upstream of ORF4. The absence of these features appears to preclude both efficient attenuation of minus-strand synthesis and the initiation of sgmRNA transcription, and this consistent with the absence of abundant sgmRNA initiating at this site in GAV or YHV (Cowley et al., 2002a, Sittidilokratna et al., 2008). Although there is some evidence of low-level expression of ORF4 protein in GAV (Cowley and Walker, 2008), this is thought to occur either by internal initiation from sgmRNA2 or from variable-length RNAs transcribed in low abundance from sites in the upstream region of the 3\u2032-UTR (J.A. Cowley et al., unpublished data). Nevertheless, the severe truncation of ORF4 in YHV and genotypes 2, 3, and 5 suggests it is unlikely to generate a functional product. It is not clear whether the ORF4 gene is under construction or deconstruction but the existence of the conserved TRS-like sequences upstream of ORF4 and the high level of sequence homology within ORF4 and downstream of the point of truncation indicate that the 3\u2032-region of the ronivirus genome is a genetic resource in active evolutionary transition.",

            "text": "MFOLD analysis of the 3\u2032-UTR sequences of YHV, GAV and genotypes 3 and 4 identified a highly conserved, thermodynamically stable RNA hairpin with four helices, the first of which (helix 1) included the first adenosine residue of the poly-A tail. Helix 1 was absolutely conserved and the importance of helices 2 and 4 in maintaining the structure was supported by the occurrence of compensatory nucleotide changes to maintain base-pairing in different genotypes. Only one nucleotide change, which slightly relaxed the stability of long helix 3, occurred in three of the four genotypes. The 3\u2032-UTR of other positive-strand RNA viruses, including coronaviruses and arteriviruses, contains sequence and/or structural elements critical to polymerase recognition and minus-strand genomic RNA synthesis (Buck, 1996, Dreher, 1999). In the coronavirus, mouse hepatitis virus (MHV), a 55 nt 3\u2032-terminal sequence including the poly-A tail is the minimal signal needed to initiate minus-strand RNA synthesis (Lin et al., 1994). In MHV and other subgroup II coronaviruses, this region forms an RNA pseudoknot, and an upstream bulged RNA hairpin structure and sequence elements that bind four host proteins also appear to be involved in minus-strand RNA synthesis (Williams et al., 1995, Williams et al., 1999, Hsue and Masters, 1997, Hsue and Masters, 1998, Nanda et al., 2004). Stem\u2013loop structures in the 3\u2032-terminal region of arteriviruses also act as signals for the viral polymerase and host protein recognition and are needed to initiate minus-strand synthesis (Verheije et al., 2002, Maines et al., 2005, Beerens and Snijder, 2006). The highly conserved nature of the ronivirus 3\u2032-UTR RNA structure suggests it may also act as a polymerase recognition signal for minus-strand RNA synthesis.",
