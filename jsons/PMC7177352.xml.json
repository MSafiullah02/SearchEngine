Through a gamified process, game elements and mechanics like achievements, progress bars, badges, leader boards, levels and points are employed to engage users [40]. In the context of marketing, gamification refers to a new marketing strategy that aims at changing the consumers\u2019 behavior in predetermined ways to foster engagement and ultimately to buy products [41,42]. In order to attain this goal, designation of an engaging experience plays a key role. Previous studies show that gamified and engaging experiences may result in brand recall and buying behavior [43].",

These concerns arise out of the degree and type of engagement between the brand and consumers due to the highly engaging gamified experience. Deep sense of participatory engagement in gamification can also be compared to co-creation marketing [46,47] in which consumers\u2019 co-produce products by actively engaging in the design process [48].

The Hook model advises a four-step loop to make the desired behavior a habitual one. The first step is the trigger, which refers to an external or internal stimulus that tells the user what to do next and how to behave next. The second step, action, refers to the actions of the user based on the information provided by the stimulus. The third stage, namely reward, refers to the acquisition of a variable reward as a consequence of the actions mentioned above. The last step, investment, means having the users make a deliberate effort to invest in the platform as in the form of time, effort, social capital investment to increase the likelihood of the repetitive behavior.",

The fact that the reward is variable allows the unconscious to be stimulated by surprise, causing dopamine release in the brain and regarding the perception of the reward as reinforcing [55]. Immediate variable rewards work perfectly well when the brain is in the unconscious mode [55] by gradually associating the reward with the trigger. ",

Then, the educator taught the participants to build the communication rules and facilitate the quality of social communication without phone. Recent studies showed that 72% of adolescents (as opposed to 48% of adults) feel an urge to respond to an incoming call or a message immediately [63]. This phenomenon can be attributed to the wrong interpersonal communication etiquette as well as low self-control and peer pressure.

Although there are some mindfulness-based intervention studies that have proven to reduce smartphone use [84], to our knowledge, this is the first study in which a marketing-focused education program has been developed to approach smartphone addiction.
