            "text": "Biological membrane organization mediates numerous cellular functions and has also been connected with an immense number of human diseases. However, until recently, experimental methodologies have been unable to directly visualize the nanoscale details of biological membranes, particularly in intact living cells. Numerous models explaining membrane organization have been proposed, but testing those models has required indirect methods; the desire to directly image proteins and lipids in living cell membranes is a strong motivation for the advancement of technology. The development of super-resolution microscopy has provided powerful tools for quantification of membrane organization at the level of individual proteins and lipids, and many of these tools are compatible with living cells. Previously inaccessible questions are now being addressed, and the field of membrane biology is developing rapidly. This chapter discusses how the development of super-resolution microscopy has led to fundamental advances in the field of biological membrane organization. We summarize the history and some models explaining how proteins are organized in cell membranes, and give an overview of various super-resolution techniques and methods of quantifying super-resolution data. We discuss the application of super-resolution techniques to membrane biology in general, and also with specific reference to the fields of actin and actin-binding proteins, virus infection, mitochondria, immune cell biology, and phosphoinositide signaling. Finally, we present our hopes and expectations for the future of super-resolution microscopy in the field of membrane biology.",

            "text": "Biological membranes mediate vast numbers of cellular functions, serve as the fundamental barrier between cell exterior and interior, and spatially define most cellular organelles (Alberts, 2002) . Biological membranes are composed of proteins, lipids, and other small molecules, typically arranged in two opposing monolayers (i.e., a bilayer) (Alberts, 2002) . The bilayer arrangement allows hydrogen bonding between the aqueous phase (i.e., the cytoplasm on one side, and extracellular medium on the other) and hydrophilic lipid head groups, while restricting interactions between hydrophobic lipid tails and the hydrophilic cytoplasm and extracellular medium (Tanford, 1991) . The lipids found in membranes include a large number (thousands) of molecular species, which can be subdivided into several general classes: phospholipids (including sphingolipids and glycerophospholipids with saturated and/or unsaturated fatty acid chains), glycolipids, and sterols (including cholesterol) (Alberts, 2002; Lehninger, Nelson, & Cox, 2013) . The idea of a cell membrane as a mosaic structure of globular proteins within a phospholipid bilayer was proposed in 1971 by S.J. Singer (Singer, 1971) and popularized the following year (Singer & Nicolson, 1972) . This \"fluid mosaic\" model proposes the free lateral diffusion of membrane proteins, which assume a long-scale random distribution in the two dimensional homogenous lipid fluid phase (see Figure 1 (A)). One fundamental departure from this theory has been pivotal in shaping membrane research from the 1980s. Rather than being strewn randomly throughout a homogenous cell plasma membrane, proteins and lipids were proposed to be laterally heterogeneous, distributed in discrete patches. While researchers worldwide were embracing this view of cell membranes, to this day there remains deep division in the community: what are the driving forces behind plasma membrane heterogeneity?",

            "text": "In the 10 years after the popular SingereNicolson (Singer & Nicolson, 1972) paper was published, researchers were theorizing that cell plasma membranes were organized into discrete lipid domains, and already proposing lipideprotein interactions (Moore, Lentz, & Meissner, 1978) analogous to the present day lipid shell model and boundary lipid theories (Anderson & Jacobson, 2002) ; researchers were also beginning to theorize that cytoskeletons could modulate lateral mobility of membrane molecules (Karnovsky, Kleinfeld, Hoover, & Klausner, 1982) . The ability of glycosphingolipids to self-associate and form discrete patches (reviewed in (Thompson & Tillack, 1985) ), was then understood to also encompass protein distributions. Glycosphingolipid self-association in the Golgi could form patches with which Dances with Membranes: Breakthroughs from Super-resolution Imaging membrane proteins would combine, and these mixtures could theoretically be transported to the apical membrane, mediating the sorting of sphingolipids and proteins in polarized epithelial cells (Simons & van Meer, 1988; Simons & Wandinger-Ness, 1990) . Biochemical analyses appeared to support this modeldthe association of (glycophosphatidyl inositol) GPIanchored proteins along with glycosphingolipids in cell lysate insoluble detergent fractions was taken as evidence of lipideprotein complexes in native membranes (Brown & Rose, 1992) . In 1997 came a popular stating \"Lipid raft\" model. Sphingolipid and cholesterol patches are populated with proteins which have an affinity for these patches. Protein species can be raft associated or nonraft associated. (C) \"Lipid shell\" model. Some proteins will be targeted to selfassembled cholesterol and sphingolipid complexes which form a \"lipid shell\" around the protein. These \"lipid shells\" have an affinity for, and can coalesce with, larger lipid domains. (D) \"Picket Fence\" model. Transmembrane proteins are restricted in their diffusion by actin filaments (the \"fence\") which appose and run parallel to the cytoplasmic leaflet of the membrane, and by other transmembrane proteins bound to these filaments (\"pickets\", not shown). (E) \"Active composite\" model. Short actin filaments adjacent to the cytoplasmic membrane leaflet are arranged in \"asters\". Transmembrane proteins and GPI-anchored proteins are advected by actin and myosin to the centers of these asters, resulting in protein nanoclustering. See Section 1.1 for more detail. Readers please note that depictions of cell membranes here do not show as much protein (relative to lipid) as would be found in actual cell membranes. (See color plate) Bagatolli, Gratton, Khan, & Chong, 2000; Baumgart, Hammond, et al., 2007; Bagatolli, Sanchez, Hazlett, & Gratton, 2003; Baumgart, Hess, & Webb, 2003; Baumgart, Hunt, Farkas, Webb, & Feigenson, 2007; Dietrich et al., 2001; Korlach, Schwille, Webb, & Feigenson, 1999; Veatch 2007; Veatch et al., 2008; Veatch et al., 2006; Veatch & Keller, 2005) . GUVs made from a mixture of 1:1:1 (unsaturated lipid:saturated lipid:cholesterol), for example, can be made to phase separate at or close to physiological temperature. In general, due to differences in fatty acid chain order and/or length, saturated and unsaturated lipids will under many conditions separate into liquid and gel phases unless sufficient sterol (cholesterol) is present to prevent demixing (Stottrup, Veatch, & Keller, 2004; Veatch & Keller, 2002 , 2003a , 2003b . Intriguingly, disruption of interactions between the cell plasma membrane and the cortical actin cytoskeleton in a process called \"blebbing\" (Keller, Rentsch, & Hagmann, 2002; Tank, Wu, & Webb, 1982) has been shown to lead to lipid phase separation in bilayers attached to or derived from cells (Baumgart, Hammond, et al., 2007; Veatch et al., 2008) . Thus, cell membranes can be caused to phase separate, but whether phase separation occurs in unperturbed cell membranes, and if so, under what conditions and on what length scales, is still unclear.",

Proteins act as individual units each wrapped in a sphingolipidecholesterol lipid shell (see Figure 1 (C)); these lipid shells do not form a distinct lipid phase, but are thought to be mobile units in the membrane. However, larger scale lipid domains (such as caveolae and \"lipid rafts\") are proposed to have a characteristic Lo phase, and proteins in lipid shells would have an affinity for these domains due to the compatibility of lipids in the shell and the Lo phase of the lipid domain. Interactions between shelled proteins and those already in lipid domains may influence their time of residence in the domain, as may ligand binding.",

The actin-based \"membrane skeleton\" (MSK), or \"fence\", creates compartments with diameters of 40e300 nm (Kusumi et al., 2012) , and various transmembrane proteins bound to these actin filaments act as \"pickets\", which span the bilayer. Short-term diffusion of membrane lipids and non-MSK-bound membrane proteins can be confined within these compartments (see Figure 1 (D)), with longer term trajectories punctuated by \"hop\" movements between adjacent compartments (termed \"hop diffusion\") (Fujiwara, Ritchie, Murakoshi, Jacobson, & Kusumi, 2002; Kusumi, et al., 2012) . More recently, the model has been amended to include lipid rafts and protein oligomers, such that entire assemblies of proteins and lipids together may move within a compartment, but still be confined by the picket fence (Kusumi, et al., 2012) .",

These nanoclusters were reported to be transient and continually remodeling. However, they do not join or coalesce into larger domains, and the ratio of monomers (80%) to clusters (20%) is independent of total expression levels (Goswami et al., 2008) . The authors propose the cytoplasmic side of the plasma membrane is abutted by a system of \"short\" (although estimated as w250 nm in length) actin filaments arranged in \"asters\", (see Figure 1 (E)) which are formed by actin s i g n a l t r a n s d u c t i o n s i g n a l t r a n s d u c t i o n Proteins cluster at the nanoscale in the plasma membrane. These clusters are proteinelipid (left, transmembrane protein and PIP2), mediated by ligand binding (middle), or proteineprotein (right; depicted as a heterocluster; a homocluster oligomer is not shown). Of course, in clusters of any protein there exists the potential for local lipid clustering also. These proteineprotein or proteinelipid clusters are collectively referred to hereafter as \"membrane clusters.\" In each case, signaling to the actin cytoskeleton initiated by proteins and/or lipids in membrane clusters elicits the local remodeling of actin (B), either through the recruitment and binding of actin filaments to the membrane lipids or proteins, the de novo nucleation of new filaments or branches thereof, or both. ABPs which mediate these interactions are not shown, but see Section 3.1 for more detail. The treadmilling and myosin contractility. Myosin contractility results in the barbed (or plus) ends of actin filaments pointing toward aster centers. In regions rich with myosin-bound actin filaments, peripheral actin filaments can be aligned with these other filaments, and pulled toward the most actin dense regions (the centers of asters). The authors posit that these forces are transmitted to (for example) GPI-anchored (exoplasmic leaflet) proteins, and proteins which bind F-actin, which are advected along with these filaments toward the centers of asters, forming nanoclusters at aster cores. Thus actin treadmilling and actinemyosin contraction would drive dynamic nanoscale clustering of proteins at the cell surface (Gowrishankar, Ghosh, Saha, Mayor, & Rao, 2012) . The theoretical basis for this model is further discussed below.",

            "text": "We propose the \"cluster feedback\" model (see Figure 2 ) whereby the reciprocal influence between two assemblies: (1) proteins and lipids in the membrane, and (2) the underlying actin cytoskeleton and associated actin binding proteins (ABPs), results in the formation of plasma membrane domains. We theorize that it is membrane-associated molecules which signal to induce local actin organization, and that these new actin platforms immediately adjacent to the membrane modulate the clustering of membrane proteins and/or lipids . This model does not discriminate between different hypotheses explaining the initial formation of membrane clusters (depicted in Figure 2 (A)). We propose that when proteins are recruited into expanding membrane clusters they do so because of proteineprotein interactions (either through other cluster proteins or by binding to actin filaments), or because actin filaments affect their mobility through steric interactions. The recruitment of new molecules into the cluster subsequent to local actin remodeling must, in some cases at least, contain a method by which this recruitment is differential, thereby sometimes increase in actin density immediately adjacent to the membrane cluster then acts as a recruitment platform for other proteins (or lipids, not shown) diffusing in the membrane to join existing membrane clusters (C). This results in changes in the size, density, perimeter, and/or number of molecules within membrane clusters. Readers should note, the numbers of proteins depicted above are only for ease of communicationd we do not hypothesize about the specific sizes (or numbers of molecules within) any of the membrane clusters here. Clusters may exist on the nano-, meso-, or micro scale; the Cluster Feedback model only predicts changes (here shown as increases) in cluster sizes from (A) to (C). See Sections 1.1 and 3.1 for more detail. (See color plate) = Dances with Membranes: Breakthroughs from Super-resolution Imaging favoring recruitment of \"like\" proteins into preexisting membrane clusters. This model is further discussed in Section 3.1. The basic goal of science is to gain knowledge through the testing of falsifiable hypotheses. In many ways and for many years, membrane research has been prevented from achieving this goal. The lack of adequate methodology has resulted in only indirect measurements being used, which has often provided insufficient evidence to discriminate between competing models. As membrane domains are widely theorized as being submicron and dynamic, their visualization with light or electron microscopy (EM) has remained indefinite. In the absence of direct images of membrane domains, the above models of membrane organization have been incompletely tested. Many experimental approaches are controversial in their ability to distinguish membrane domains. For example, cold low density detergent-insoluble fractions of lysed cell membranes have been extensively used as a determinant of lipid rafts (from (Brown & Rose, 1992) to (Recktenwald et al., 2015) ), however their representation of domains in native cell membranes is tenuous and yet to be verified (Edidin, 2003; Kraft, 2013; Lichtenberg, Goni, & Heerklotz, 2005) . Relying on cholesterol dependence to define raft-associated processes is also problematic. The cholesterol dependence of membrane domains is often tested by perturbing cholesterol, which is known to alter phosphatidylinositol (4,5)-bisphosphate (PIP2) availability, and in turn the organization of the actin cytoskeleton (Kwik et al., 2003) , as well as other fundamental cellular processes such as endocytosis (Borroni et al., 2007) . Additionally, perturbing cholesterol with cyclodextrins can result in phospholipid redistribution, and these drugs can interact with membrane proteins (Zidovetzki & Levitan, 2007) . Additional hypotheses of cholesterol-mediated scaffolding of signaling proteins can also explain cholesterol dependence in lipid raft-free models of protein organization (see review in (Kraft, 2013) ). Furthermore, cholesterol was found not to be enriched in membrane clusters of sphingolipids in fibroblast cells , and even in GUVs made from ternary lipid mixtures, the concentration of cholesterol was only modestly enriched in the Lo phase compared to the Ld phase (Veatch et al., 2006) . Thus, despite its involvement in an abundance of biological functions and diseases (Maxfield & Menon, 2006; Maxfield & Tabas, 2005; Michel & Bakovic, 2007; Pichler & Riezman, 2004; Rojo, Sjoberg, Hernandez, Zambrano, & Maccioni, 2006; Saini, Arneja, & Dhalla, 2004; Song, Kenworthy, & Sanders, 2014; Tabas, 2002) , the roles of cholesterol in membrane lateral organization require further clarification. While the importance of cholesterol and other lipids has been heavily investigated in the field of membrane organization models, clearly membrane and cytoskeletal proteins also play a crucial role in cell membrane biology.",

For example, a recent revision of the fluid mosaic membrane model envisages that actin fences, lipid rafts, and lipid shells (among other factors) can be congruous and all contribute to the segregation of integral membrane proteins (Nicolson, 2014) . However, some aspects of these models are mutually exclusive: actin filaments in the \"active composite\" model are proposed as being w250 nm long (Gowrishankar, et al., 2012) , which would presumably result in asters with diameters w500nm, too large to be bounded by actin membrane compartments of 300 nm diameter proposed by the \"picket fence\" model (Kusumi et al., 2012) . Moreover, some tenets of these models are directly competing. For example, the \"lipid shell\" model hypothesizes that GPI-anchored protein clustering results from Lo phase coalescence between lipid shells and lipid domains (Anderson & Jacobson, 2002) . Conversely, the \"active composite\" model hypothesizes that GPI-anchored protein clustering results from these proteins advecting with the movement of actin filaments toward the centers of actin asters (Gowrishankar et al., 2012) . These are two very different mechanisms, each proposed to explain the same phenomenon, namely the clustering of GPI-anchored proteins.",

If transmembrane proteins bound to F-actin are advected along with treadmilling actin filaments, and these filaments have their barbed ends pointing toward the center of an aster, then the motion of the transmembrane proteins will be toward the periphery of the aster, rather than toward the center (i.e., the treadmilling of actin will push the actin-bound transmembrane protein toward the actin filament pointed end, which is at the aster periphery).

Studies of protein dynamics are highly informative, but considering the importance of the cytoskeleton, methods which can image multiple species (e.g., cytoskeletal and integral membrane proteins) simultaneously are highly desirable. Single particle tracking (SPT) can fulfill this role when combined with another microscopy method, or when adapted to allow multiple species to be tracked simultaneously (Weigel, Simon, Tamkun, & Krapf, 2011) . This approach has already provided valuable information on the apparent restriction of Fc\u03b5RI receptors by the actin cytoskeleton (Andrews et al., 2008) , and this technique is a great tool for gathering precise information on dynamics of very small numbers of molecules. However, SPT tends to be used to quantify motions of individual particles, rather than specifically for imaging. The use of homo-F\u20ac orster resonance energy transfer (homo-FRET) in describing cell surface distributions of proteins is also a powerful and dynamic method (Gowrishankar et al., 2012; Sharma et al., 2004 ), yet is limited in length scales to less than roughly twice the F\u20ac orster radius (i.e., <10 nm) and to diffractionlimited scales (i.e., >200 nm), blocking direct observation of the size and shape of membrane domains.",

Stimulated emission refers to the phenomenon whereby a molecule in an excited state can interact with an incident photon and emit a second in-phase photon of the same wavelength, deexciting the molecule in the process. In STED, the fluorescence of molecules is interrupted (outcompeted) by stimulated emission so that the emission of fluorescent molecules not at the precise center of the focal volume can be quenched and the effective focal volume size reduced to a few tens of nanometers, or even smaller, in either two or three dimensions (Hein, Willig, & Hell, 2008; Meyer et al., 2008) .

These probes, often fluorescent proteins or dyes, are characterized by their ability to exhibit changes to their fluorescent properties, such as transitions from an inactive dark state to an active fluorescent state, when illuminated with a particular wavelength of light (often in the blue or ultraviolet wavelength range). Two lasers are typically used in combination, an activation laser to convert inactive (nonfluorescent) molecules to an activated state and a readout laser to drive the activated molecules to emit light. Since the activation of the fluorescent Dances with Membranes: Breakthroughs from Super-resolution Imaging probes is a stochastic process, with probability proportional to the activation laser intensity, using low activation laser intensity can cause a small subset of the total population of fluorescent molecules in the sample to be activated at any given time. This subset of activated molecules will fluoresce when excited with a readout laser and then photobleach or return to a dark state. With low density of active molecules, there is a high probability that each fluorescent molecule will be resolvable from the others. When this occurs, each molecule can be localized by finding the centroid of the image or by fitting the image with an appropriate function, such as a two-dimensional Gaussian. The process of activation, readout, and photobleaching of the fluorescent probes can be repeated until there are no more fluorescent molecules in the sample or until a desired number of molecules has been recorded (Betzig et al., 2006; Hess et al., 2006; Rust et al., 2006) .",

Furthermore, these types of localization microscopy can be used to produce images in three dimensions by introducing z-dependent elements to alter the detection point spread function (PSF). This z dependency can be added in a number of ways, such as by using a cylindrical lens to induce astigmatism (Huang, Wang, Bates, & Zhuang, 2008) , by simultaneous bi-plane detection (Juette et al., 2008) , or by introducing strong axial dependence of the PSF using a spatial light modulator (Jia, Vaughan, & Zhuang, 2014; Pavani et al., 2009) or 4Pi detection geometry (Shtengel et al., 2009) .",

FPALM and PALM initially used fluorescent proteins (Betzig et al., 2006; Hess et al., 2006) while STORM initially used antibodies conjugated to organic dyes to label structures of interest (Rust et al., 2006) . The intracellular introduction of antibodies generally requires cell membranes to be permeabilized in some manner, a consideration when STORM is used for live cell studies. However, organic dyes have the advantage of being relatively bright and photostable, especially in the presence of an oxygen scavenging system. This allows for resampling of the same fluorophore several times before photobleaching. While this increases sampling density, and potentially resolution, this resampling can result in overcounting of the number of localized molecules in the sample. Fluorescent proteins, by comparison, sometimes emit fewer photons before photobleaching. Such characteristics reduce the rates of overcounting, but fewer detected photons per molecule can also limit localization precision and, in the presence of background, the number of molecules identified. However, fluorescent proteins are expressed by the cell, eliminating the need to introduce large antibodies through the cell membrane, and they also do not require use of reducing agents in the imaging buffer. Since these localization methods rely on constructing an image from many localized point sources, labeling density and specific probe photophysics tend to be the most limiting factors.",

SOFI can be applied to many fluorescence imaging modalities provided that the fluorescent label used has two or more distinguishable states (for example, a bright and dark state), and that each molecule switches stochastically and independently of the others. To achieve enhanced resolution, a movie of a fluorescently labeled sample is acquired, and an n-th order autocumulant is calculated, effectively filtering the acquisition such that only highly correlated fluctuations remain. This results in an image with greatly reduced background and a resolution that is the square root of 2 better than the diffraction limited case. Alternatively, cross-cumulants may be used instead for even larger increases in resolution (Dertinger, Colyer, Vogel, Enderlein, & Weiss, 2010) . SOFI can be used in 3D imaging applications (Dertinger, Xu, Naini, Vogel, & Weiss, 2012) , with living samples (Geissbuehler et al., 2014) , and has been demonstrated with organic dyes (Dertinger, Heilemann, Vogel, Sauer, & Weiss, 2010) .",

In uPAINT, highly specific fluorescent ligands are added to the sample via solution just before imaging. The ligands bind to target proteins of interest and, with an appropriately chosen concentration, are sparse enough to be localized. Excited fluorophores will eventually photobleach but are stochastically replenished by ligands from solution. An oblique laser illumination profile is used to excite the fluorophores in order to limit the focal volume, reduce background, and prevent bleaching of out of focus molecules. uPAINT is well suited to tracking single molecules for many time steps, and multiple dye molecules can be bound to a single ligand to further increase tracking duration (up to tens of seconds). uPAINT has been used to examine up to two species simultaneously (Winckler et al., 2013) . Typical localization precisions are within the range of 40e50 nm (Giannone et al., 2010) .

The K-function quantifies the number of objects (e.g., imaged proteins or lipids) of a given type found within a circle of specified radius from each other object of the same type (or a different type for co-distribution measurements) and normalizes the amplitude by the overall density such that an amplitude of zero corresponds to a random distribution (Ripley, 1977) . The PCF quantifies the number of probes at a given distance from each other molecule, normalizes by the area of each ring and the average molecular density, and averages over all molecules, such that an amplitude of 1 corresponds to random. Typically, these tests are performed over a range of radii in order to determine whether there is any clustering of the probes and if so, to elucidate properties such as mean cluster radii or mean cluster density Hess et al., 2005; Philimonenko et al., 2000; Plowman et al., 2005) . There are other tests to measure spatial heterogeneity such as the Getis G statistic (Getis & Ord, 1992) , which includes different normalizations and weighing parameters dependent on molecular spatial position. These differences result in increased sensitivities to certain cluster parameters (Itano et al., 2014) . The Ripley's cross-K-function (cross-K) and pair cross-correlation function (PCCF) quantify the spatial relationship between two differently labeled species in a sample. In principle, the algorithms work similarly to Dances with Membranes: Breakthroughs from Super-resolution Imaging the K-function and PCF, by counting the measured numbers of probes of one species at a distance r from each molecule of the other species, then averaging over all molecules. These tests quantify the degree to which and the range of distances over which two labeled species colocalize Philimonenko et al., 2000) .",

Single-linkage cluster analysis (Sneath, 1957) defines all molecules within a user-defined distance of any other molecule in the set to be within the same cluster. This type of algorithm is useful because it precisely defines the set of molecules within each cluster, and thus the localized coordinates of those molecules can be quantified directly ( Bar-On et al., 2012; Gudheti et al., 2013) . The nearest neighbor distance distribution can also be used to determine the local density of the clustered probes. This information allows for comparison of cells that have been treated to disrupt or enhance clustering (Hess et al., 2005) or for comparison of nonclustered probes in different regions of the plasma membrane (Stryer, 1978; Zacharias, Violin, Newton, & Tsien, 2002) . Additionally, an angular histogram (the angle between a molecule and its two nearest neighbors) reveals any preferential orientation of probes within the cluster. Orientational order can result from hexatic phases or interactions with other cellular components which may induce ordering of the proteins, such as cytoskeletal components (Hess et al., 2005) .",

These high-density maps of short molecular trajectories provide both spatial and dynamic information, and in many ways are a high-density limit of SPT, where low densities of labeled molecules are typically used. Likewise, as single-molecule localization methods have advanced, computational methods have developed which enable larger numbers of SPT molecules in close proximity to be concurrently analyzed (Jaqaman et al., 2008) .

In return, membrane proteins and lipids can locally remodel (or create new) actin filaments (see review by (Saarikangas, Zhao, & Lappalainen, 2010) ). While the precise mechanisms are still under debate, instrumental in many actinmembrane interactions are actin binding proteins (ABPs), which can variously connect actin filaments with membrane proteins or the lipid membrane itself, and modulate the local nucleation, branching, cross-linking, and dissociation of actin filaments.

By understanding the spatial and functional relationships between ABPs, actin, and the membrane, we can better understand exactly how cell systems are able to coordinate a staggering array of varied and distinct molecular processes at the membrane. Before assessing the future opportunities in this field, we first summarize the techniques which have led us to this point.",

Kenworthy et al. used FRAP very effectively to distinguish between membrane models with and without cytoskeletal interactions (Kenworthy et al., 2004) , and discovered that the slow diffusion of the cholera toxin subunit B (CTxB) is due to confinement by the actin cytoskeleton (Day & Kenworthy, 2012) .

FCS of lipid probes in cell membranes demonstrated anomalous diffusion ) consistent with cytoskeletal interactions or nanodomains. FCS measurements of diffusion as a function of observation volume size (Wawrezinieck, Rigneault, Marguet, & Lenne, 2005) have been very effectively used to quantify GPI-anchored protein clustering, and results also suggest that cytoskeletal interactions mediate membrane lateral organization (Lenne et al., 2006) .

As examples, actin and lytic granules (see also Section 3.4) have been imaged together with dual-color STED in cells lacking an isoform of the ABP coronin, fuelling a novel model of granule secretion (Mace & Orange, 2014) . Dual color FPALM has shown that clusters of influenza hemagglutinin (HA) can either be colocalized with, or completely exclude, the ABP cofilin . Sequential dual color PALM/dSTORM imaging has revealed a tight spatial association between the post synaptic density and Arp2/3, which is functionally reliant on the Rho GTPase Rac (Chazeau et al., 2014) . Dual-color PALM has shown that actin and GPI-anchored proteins (which have extensively been used to demonstrate aspects of various models of membrane organization (see Section 1.1)), cluster on the nanoscale without appreciable colocalization, until antibody cross-linking stimulates formation of GPIanchored protein clusters many microns in size which do associate with actin (Sengupta et al., 2011) . Dual-color STED imaging of PC12 membranes has shown that mesoscale membrane clusters contain many species of protein which are further spatially organized within a single cluster, and these clusters exclude, and are strikingly bordered by, actin and spectrin (Saka et al., 2014) .",

As examples, FPALM has already elucidated that clusters of the influenza protein HA are associated spatially and dynamically with clusters of actin (i.e., not contained in an actin poor compartment and bounded by a fence, but rather shuffling on top of a thick actin hedge) . Exciting avenues for testing between models of membrane organization are now being realized with the ability of super-resolution microscopy to visualize the dynamics of three protein species simultaneously, in living cells, at the nanoscale. Three-color live cell FPALM experiments have already shown that HA and transferrin receptors (previously considered putative \"raft\" and \"nonraft\" markers, respectively) each form spatially segregated nano-and microscale clusters, yet both species spatially and dynamically correlate with actin clustering (Gunewardene et al., 2011) .",

            "text": "The insights into membrane organization afforded by super-resolution microscopy, along with observations from decades of membrane research Dances with Membranes: Breakthroughs from Super-resolution Imaging provide the basis for our cluster feedback model (see Section 1.1), whereby the relationship between (1) membrane proteins and lipids (including PIP2), and (2) actin and ABPs is bidirectional. The differential regulation of ABPs by membrane-associated molecules can induce the local formation and reorganization of actin filaments. These actin filaments can then work to locally alter the distribution and diffusion of membrane molecules, creating clusters of proteins and lipids in membrane domains. This model builds on ideas published in a range of membrane protein clustering contexts (Chichili & Rodgers, 2009; Gowrishankar et al., 2012; Gudheti et al., 2013; Jaumouille et al., 2014; Viola & Gupta, 2007; van Zanten et al., 2009) . Experimental evidence for this model has come from observations that (1) increasing actin stability can increase coclustering of membrane proteins (e.g., (Chichili & Rodgers, 2007; Gudheti et al., 2013) ), (2) ABPs are differentially localized with respect to clusters of membrane proteins (Chazeau et al., 2014; Gudheti et al., 2013; Saka et al., 2014) , and (3) altering ABP expression can be sufficient to modulate membrane protein mobility (Pore et al., 2013) and clustering (e.g., (Alvarez-Guaita et al., 2014; Chazeau et al., 2014) . Feedback has been demonstrated by, for example, work showing that Fcg receptor activation can influence actin polymerization, which in turn affects Fcg receptor mobility (Jaumouille et al., 2014) , and in the T-cell activated remodeling of F-actin, which in turn mediates the organization of plasma-membrane bound signaling proteins (see review in (Kumari, Curado, Mayya, & Dustin, 2014) ). Upstream regulators of ABPs have also been measured with respect to membrane protein organization, such as the elegant dual color NSOM study demonstrating that ligand binding of integrins induces clustering of, and colocalization with, GPI-anchored proteins (van Zanten et al., 2009) . We hope to see more studies using superresolution microscopy to directly image actin, membrane proteins, and the ABPs themselves, so that we may further test hypotheses of membrane proteindactin/ABP feedback predicted by the cluster feedback model.",

Similarly, actin can contribute to many processes which alter spatial organization of membrane proteins (e.g., endoand exocytosis). Single species imaging of membrane proteins with or without ABPS (or actin disrupting drugs) can test for effects on membrane protein distribution, but cannot easily determine how. Better understanding of mechanisms can come from simultaneous imaging of the membrane protein and the ABP (and/or actin) being investigated. Research into other membrane platforms, such as focal adhesions, has been aided by superresolution microscopy elucidating (for example) movement of single talin molecules with respect to b-integrins (Rossier et al., 2012) and the organization in three dimensions of multiple ABPs with respect to the membrane (Kanchanawong et al., 2010) . Despite the benefits that super-resolution microscopy has afforded membrane research, many competing models of how ABPs and actin influence distributions of membrane proteins and lipids are yet to be tested. The development of photoactivatable lipid tags (e.g. Mizuno et al., 2011) has already allowed exciting super-resolution imaging of membrane lipids (Abe et al., 2012; Honigmann et al., 2013 ), yet many opportunities for multichannel lipid/actin/membrane imaging remain relatively unexplored. Studies which visualize and analyze the three-dimensional organization of the membrane and actin cytoskeleton will continue to be extremely fruitful.",

            "text": "Even though direct optical imaging of membrane domains with diffraction limited techniques is not always possible, many properties of viral assembly and function can be uncovered through indirect imaging methods. FRET microscopy has reported the association between viral proteins and putative lipid raft markers (Engel et al., 2010) , and FRET has been quite useful in quantifying clustering of many membrane proteins on length scales <10 nm (Karpova et al., 2003; Kenworthy, 2001 Kenworthy, , 2005 Kenworthy & Edidin, 1998; Kenworthy, Petranova, & Edidin, 2000) . FRAP (Elson, Schlessinger, Koppel, Axelrod, & Webb, 1976) has yielded insight into mechanisms of diffusion of viral membrane proteins at the cell membrane (Kenworthy et al., 2004) , and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) has revealed how lipid phase changes as a function of temperature help protect viral stability (Polozov, Bezrukov, Gawrisch, & Zimmerberg, 2008) . However, FRET is insensitive to length scales from w10 to 200 nm, NMR does not provide an image, and FRAP does not give direct information about spatial organization below the diffraction limit. Using super-resolution imaging, investigators have been able to directly quantify shapes, sizes, and densities of membrane protein distributions, as well as the degree of spatial overlap between different species of proteins at the nanoscale Gudheti et al., 2013; Gunewardene et al., 2011; Hess et al., 2007; Shroff et al., 2007) . These capabilities have allowed researchers to answer previously inaccessible questions about viral assembly, viral protein trafficking, and viral interactions with host cell components, which help build our understanding of the infection process, and have the potential to reveal new anti-viral drug targets.",

            "text": "hijacking your cells The influenza virus is responsible for tens of thousands of deaths annually. Influenza can use host cell proteins to aid in infection, and mass spectrometry has shown that a number of host cell proteins are also preferentially incorporated into influenza virus released from infected cells (Shaw, Stone, Colangelo, Gulcicek, & Palese, 2008) , leading to the question of how these associations occur. Some answers may be found with the influenza membrane protein hemagglutinin (HA), which is crucial in many steps of viral infection. HA binds sialic-acid containing cell surface receptors (Skehel & Wiley, 2000) ; HA catalyzes membrane fusion necessary for viral entry (Biswas, Yin, Blank, & Zimmerberg, 2008; Chernomordik, Frolov, Leikina, Bronk, & Zimmerberg, 1998; Skehel & Wiley, 2000 Wiley & Skehel, 1987) ; and clustering of HA in the viral membrane is crucial for fusion to be accomplished (Bentz, 2000; Chernomordik et al., 1998; Chernomordik, Leikina, Frolov, Bronk, & Zimmerberg, 1997; Kozlov & Chernomordik, 1998; Kumar, Kenworthy, Roth, & Zimmerberg, 2001; Takeda, Leser, Russell, & Lamb, 2003) . HA assembles with other viral components before budding (Nayak, Hui, & Barman, 2004) , and in the late 1990s, biochemical experiments were able to show that the influenza virus buds from areas of the host membrane where viral components including HA and certain cell lipids are concentrated (Scheiffele, Rietveld, Wilk, & Simons, 1999; Scheiffele, Roth, & Simons, 1997) . HA dynamics have been investigated with SPT, which helped elucidate the HA-dependent mechanism by which viral RNA traverses the nuclear envelope (Babcock, Chen, & Zhuang, 2004; Lakadamyali, Rust, Babcock, & Zhuang, 2003) , and FRAP experiments measured the diffusion coefficient of HA w0.1 mm 2 /s, and suggested an immobile fraction (w25%) of HA (Kenworthy et al., 2004) . While these experiments have greatly helped shape our understanding of influenza infection, they have not fully clarified the nanoscale organization of viral and host cell components during infection.",

Super-resolution microscopy has also been used to determine the spatial distribution of the host cell protein CD81 (tetraspanin), which is recruited to assembling influenza viruses, and is concentrated at the growing tip and budding neck of progeny viruses (He et al., 2013) . CD81 can control the progression of membrane protein distributions in, for example, immunological synapse formation (Rocha-Perugini et al., 2013) , and form complexes with a number of signaling proteins and other master regulators such as the integrins (Berditchevski, 2001) . Tetraspanin redistribution by influenza may be one method by which the virus is able to reorganize other host cell membrane proteins on the surface of budding virions.",

            "text": "relationship? One other host cell protein which is greatly exploited by influenza, and viruses in general, is actin (Radtke, Dohner, & Sodeik, 2006) . While it was shown that HA clusters (which are necessary precursors of viral budding (Scheiffele et al., 1997) ) can persist over timescales of at least tens of seconds , high-speed FPALM showed that fluctuations in area, perimeter, and shape of these clusters can occur on timescales as short as 0.1 s (Nelson et al., 2014) leading to the question of how clusters are able to persist. Multicolor FPALM imaging in live cells has shown that HA mobility decreases with increased cortical actin density. Along with the discovery of two distinct populations of HA, one with low (non-zero) mobility and confined motion on 100e200 nm length scales , these findings suggest that local actin is influencing the dynamics of this membrane protein. Colocalization of HA clusters with actin clusters and the increase in HA cluster size upon treatment with actin-stabilizing jasplakinolide treatment do not seem consistent with a picket-fence description . Moreover, the intriguing nanoscale differential anti-and colocalization of HA and ABPs, including cofilin (which is strikingly excluded from some HA clusters, yet strongly colocalizes with others), suggests the relationship is more involved than HA molecules simply being confined between actin fences . Rather, these insights made possible by super-resolution microscopy suggest a dynamic \"cluster feedback\" between membrane HA and the underlying actin cytoskeleton (see Section 1.1 and Figure 2 ). Understanding these HA organizing mechanisms could be vital in identifying novel antiviral drug treatments, and understanding the HA/actin/ABP interplay may illuminate cellular processes which are used to organize the distributions of many other membrane proteins.",

Understanding of the molecular dynamics involved in HIV infection and replication is critical for developing future medical treatments for infected individuals, as well as for preventing infection. Formation of the HIV immature capsid (and in turn budding, release, and maturation of the virus) depends on formation of a polyprotein assembly of the HIV protein group-specific antigen (Gag) (Lingappa, Reed, Tanaka, Chutiraka, & Robinson, 2014) . Live cell sptPALM was used to compare the dynamic behaviors of Gag and the vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) G protein (Manley et al., 2008) . This allowed researchers to build dense \"trajectory maps\" of many different proteins to help understand the dynamic behavior of individual proteins, and entire populations and assemblies, in the plasma membrane. While the distributions and mobility of Gag and VSV-G proteins differed greatly, they were both found to be consistent with results obtained through diffraction-limited techniques (Jouvenet et al., 2006; Kenworthy et al., 2004) . Using STORM, researchers revealed that Gag recruits and corrals the HIV viral envelope protein (Env) into large immobile clusters on the plasma membrane, in a process dependent on the Env cytoplasmic tail (Roy, Chan, Lambele, & Thali, 2013) . STED has also elucidated this relationship, revealing that clustering of Env on viral envelopes changed as a function of viral maturity, and that this clustering required the Gaginteracting Env tail (Chojnacki et al., 2012) . Using sptPALM and PALM images, micro-RNA overexpression was shown to reduce Gag mobility, and also reduce Gag cluster size and density , which could in turn affect the clustering of HIV-1 Env and overall infectivity of the virus.",

In particular, the manipulation of host membrane protein organization by viruses has been shown, at the nanoscale, to be imperative for some steps in viral infection. These microscopy methods could also be employed to help understand currently unknown mechanisms in past and rising health threats such as pox viruses (e.g., smallpox and vaccinia), coronaviruses (e.g., SARS), and filoviruses (e.g., Ebola and Marburg viruses). There are at least six membrane proteins known to be associated with the currently unclear process of virion formation in the vaccinia virus (Liu, Cooper, Howley, & Hayball, 2014) . In filoviruses, the proteins responsible for viral assembly and virion production have been identified, but the mechanisms of interaction with the host cell remain unclear (Stahelin, 2014) . Understanding the interplay between host and viral membrane protein organization at the nanoscale with superresolution microscopy will undoubtedly continue to rapidly improve our understanding of virus infection, and so aid in the development of targeted and efficacious antiviral therapies. Super-resolution microscopy has also been used to study the defenses mounted by cells upon viral infection (see Section 3.4.1 for more detail on immune cells). FPALM imaging of zebrafish Dances with Membranes: Breakthroughs from Super-resolution Imaging cells showed that snakehead rhabdovirus (SHRV) infection resulted in downregulated caveolin expression, which in turn dispersed the clustering of a zebrafish type I interferon receptor (IFN-R) homolog, the clustering of which was crucial for the innate immune response . Exciting recent developments now show that FPALM can be used in vivo to image membrane structures within living zebrafish (Gabor, Kim, Kim, & Hess, 2015) , suggesting that changes in membrane organization during viral infection, and many other possibilities, can now be investigated in vivo.",

While these experiments provide invaluable information about the viral life cycle, they explore only a part of the full story. More research into the organization and dynamics of the virion envelope during binding, entry, and uncoating, could provide additional insights and help identify new antiviral drug targets. As many entire virions can be smaller than the diffraction limit, questions relating to the organization of host cell and viral proteins within the virion itself require the ability to image nanoscale structure. Super-resolution can see at the nano-and virus-scale, and we can now resolve host cell proteins (and lipids) in living cells as they are commandeered by the virus. These capabilities are well suited for understanding infection, so we can better develop methods to combat it. We look forward to seeing in real time at the nanoscale exactly how viruses use, abuse, and steal our membranes and associated proteins for their own infective purposes.",

Further investigation into the distributions of proteins at the nanoscale will inform as to the processes which allow the highly ordered physical arrangements of convoluted mitochondrial membranes in the meso-and microscale.

When multivalent antigen cross-links these IgEe Fc\u03b5RI complexes, mast cells are stimulated to release preformed granules containing immune system mediators (see review in Siraganian, 2003) . EM imaging has demonstrated that antigen cross-linking induces Fc\u03b5RIe IgE complex aggregation in fixed cells (Stump, Pfeiffer, Seagrave, & Oliver, 1988; Veatch, Chiang, Sengupta, Holowka, & Baird, 2012) . In live cells, antigen cross-linking induces altered dynamics as demonstrated with SPT (Spendier, Lidke, Lidke, & Thomas, 2012) , and with nonimaging methods (e.g., FCS and FRAP with stationary spot illumination) (Larson, Gosse, Holowka, Baird, & Webb, 2005; Menon, Holowka, Webb, & Baird, 1986 ) but super-resolution imaging provides a means of directly imaging the protein dynamics and clustering, and their context as a function of time in living cells. The kinetics following antigen cross-linking of IgEeFc\u03b5RI complexes was measured in living rat basophilic leukemia (RBL)-2H3 mast cells at the nanoscale with STORM, first reported in 2013 (Shelby, Holowka, Baird, & Veatch, 2013) . Importantly, this allowed the imaging of a distinct time series in receptor organization. Prior to antigen addition, IgE-bound Fc\u03b5RI receptors are uniformly distributed throughout the membrane. Within 2 minutes of antigen addition, the mobility of receptors slows dramatically and the receptors themselves are laterally confined. It is not until 5 minutes post antigen addition that receptors organize into w70 nm clusters, which are too small to resolve using conventional microscopy. Furthermore, the mobility of single receptors after antigen addition was highly dependent on the surrounding receptor density, even before strong clustering occurred. Single receptors reversibly associated with small and slowly moving receptor clusters soon after antigen addition, and before calcium mobilization, suggesting initial signaling promoted these molecular associations. Antigen-mediated clustering could be reversed; addition of an antigencompetitive monovalent ligand restored the uniform distribution of receptors in nonantigen-treated cells. This elegant and robust study is a fine example of the profound biological insight which can be gained from carefully quantified super-resolution data.",

            "text": "One long-standing question has faced immunity research for years: how can NK cells pass a cannonball through the eye of a needle? NK cells (and cytotoxic T cells) can directly eliminate virus-infected or tumor cells through specialized secretory lysosomes known as lytic granules (Bryceson et al., 2011; Lieberman, 2003) , with diameters around 250 nm (Brown, Oddos, et al., 2011) . Confocal studies suggested granules were secreted through a large (many microns in diameter) central clearance in an otherwise hyperdense actin barrier (Orange et al., 2003) . Recent super-resolution imaging of NK cells showed actin filament accumulation at the IS upon NK cell stimulation, which is not centrally cleared as previously thought ((SIM; Brown, Oddos, et al., 2011; STED; Rak et al., 2011) ). Rather, the holes in the actin mesh (only present upon cell activation) are only large enough to accommodate a single granule (Brown, Dobbie, Alakoskela, Davis, & Davis, 2012; Brown, Oddos, et al., 2011; Rak et al., 2011) . Two-color STED showed the close spatial association of actin and granules adjacent to the IS (Mace & Orange, 2012a) , and that the actin ABP coronin aided actin hole formation, facilitating granule secretion through the otherwise dense actin cortex (Mace & Orange, 2014) . So, the lytic granule cannonball can pass through, not because of a large barrier clearance, but because the eye of the dense actin mesh needle locally expands to accommodate it. This fundamental change in ideas is due to the insight made possible by imaging advances: \"The use of super-resolution imaging was critical to the identification of the granule-sized clearances formed in response to activating signal\" (Mace & Orange, 2012b) .",

ZAP-70 and Lck mediate the phosphorylation of the scaffolding proteins linker for activation of T-cells (LAT) and SH2 domain-containing leukocyte protein-76 (SLP76) (for review see (Le Floc'h & Huse, 2015) ). These multimolecular signaling complexes (along with other associated effectors and adaptors) can further group into microclusters, and these complexes and microclusters drive signal amplification and underpin T-cell activation (for review see (Sherman et al., 2013) ). As such, the spatial distributions and dynamics of these proteins, and TCR-dependent signaling microclusters, are of tremendous interest.

In resting T-cells, plasma membrane-bound TCR and LAT were shown with single color PALM to precluster into independent \"protein islands.\" Following T-cell activation, these islands appeared to concatenate, forming TCR and LAT microclusters, respectively (Lillemeier et al., 2010) . Further use of dual color PALM also indicated that TCR and ZAP-70 resided in separate clusters which mixed upon T-cell activation (Sherman et al., 2011) .

Similarly, dual-color PALM imaging of ZAP-70 and another of its substrates, SLP-76, indicated that ZAP-70 and SLP-76 clusters segregated as a function of time after activation (Hsu & Baumgart, 2011) . Debate ensued. How were T-cells regulating the precise clustering, mixing, and segregation of signaling proteins in response to activation? Dances with Membranes: Breakthroughs from Super-resolution Imaging Through the use of super-resolution microscopy, a story has begun to emerge. Single-color PALM revealed that following activation, T-cell plasma membranes contained dramatic increases in the numbers of clusters of LAT (Hsu & Baumgart, 2011; Williamson et al., 2011), SLP-76, and ZAP-70 (Hsu & Baumgart, 2011) . Dual-color dSTORM and PALM imaging suggested that T-cell activation involved docking of subsynaptic vesicles and subsequent localized delivery of LAT molecules to plasma membrane activation sites, forming new, immobile LAT clusters (Williamson et al., 2011) . Dual-color PALM showed SLP-76 accumulation at the rims of LAT clusters in activated T-cells (Sherman et al., 2011) , and dual color dSTORM-TIRF imaging showed that upon T-cell activation, phosphorylated (p)LAT formed vesicular fusion-dependent \"signaling nanoterritories,\" elongated pLAT nanoclusters adjacent to (within 20 nm), but spatially segregated from clusters of phosphorylated SLP-76 (Soares et al., 2013) . Conversely, pLAT that was preclustered in the plasma membranes of resting T-cells (in morphologically distinct circular nanoclusters) rarely associated with pSLP76 (Soares et al., 2013) . These results suggest that two different populations of LAT exist; with (1) activation induced fusion of vesicular LAT to the plasma membrane predominantly contributing to signaling complexes, and (2) preexisting plasma membrane-bound LAT clusters remaining relatively inert with respect to signal transduction.",

Imaging by tracking single molecules with STORM has shown that individual BCRs, and BCR microclusters, each exhibit reduced mobility in ezrin deficient cells (Pore et al., 2013) . Imaging with dSTORM showed for the first time that BCR isotypes IgM and IgG, and the co-factor CD19, are differentially assembled into preformed clusters on the naive B-cell plasma membrane (Mattila et al., 2013) . Antigen activation induces a local coalescence of nanoclusters of BCR and the cofactor CD19, with the membrane spanning molecular organizer CD81 (tetraspanin) determining reorganization. Mattila et al. propose that CD19 is sequestered from BCR nanoclusters by CD81, and B-cell activation induces actin remodeling which allows CD19 to converge with BCRs and elicit cell signaling (Mattila et al., 2013) . The alterations in the clustering of these proteins occur at the nanoscale, without alterations to their global distributions. These studies highlight the insights allowed by super-resolution in understanding immune processes which are otherwise invisible (see review by (Grove, 2014) ).",

Mammals produce seven different types of phosphoinositide, each of which is found in a different domain of the membrane, and each of which is differentiated by the location of the phosphorylation of the inositol ring (Di Paolo & De Camilli, 2006) . Phosphoinositides are involved in, and regulate, an immense number of cellular events, including cell signaling, membrane transport and regulation, cytokinesis, and organelle distinction (Di Paolo & De Camilli, 2006) . They can do this by directly binding to proteins, by activating proteins upstream of structural change, and by mediating a number of signaling pathways. One particularly important phosphoinositide is phosphatidylinositol (4,5)biphosphate (PIP2), which is also one of the more prevalent subspecies (Liu & Bankaitis, 2010) . Of particular interest in membrane organization research, PIP2 has the potential to be a master regulator, as it can function to remodel the actin cytoskeleton in many different ways (see Section 3.1 for more detail), and may be a functional conduit between membrane proteins, lipids, and membrane-associated actin. Though these lipids are essential for cellular functionality, data suggest that PIP2-mediated processes are altered by nanoscale spatial distributions not resolvable by conventional microscopy. Superresolution microscopy has allowed nanoscale investigation to begin.",

The direct imaging of PIP2 and other lipid species at the nanoscale in living cells is a tantalizing prospect. Due to the compatibility of super-resolution microscopy with live cell imaging, much can be learned about biological membranes; for example, how are PIP2 and PIP3 molecules spatially segregated? Are molecular motions confined within clusters, or do certain molecules just spend longer dwell times within? Localization microscopy can provide single-molecule information such as high-density molecular trajectories Manley et al., 2008) within the context of other membrane components, information which can be invaluable for quantification of membrane organization and dynamics to address a wide range of interesting questions.",

            "text": "As is frequently the case in fluorescence methods, the properties of fluorescent probes themselves can be limiting, and can restrict the speed at which fast images can be acquired. Ideally, probes would emit very large numbers of photons (i.e., >10 5 ) before switching to a dark state or bleaching, they would have minimal blinking on millisecond and microsecond timescales (as this can lead to erroneously increased estimates of molecule number), and probes would not disrupt biological function. Of course, increased numbers of detected photons can in principle improve localization precision, although many other factors are involved at length scales below 20 nm, such as localization errors due to emission dipole orientation effects (Enderlein, Toprak, & Selvin, 2006) , camera pixel heterogeneities (Pertsinidis, Zhang, & Chu, 2010) , and sample/stage drift (Mlodzianoski et al., 2011) . However, to gain substantial increases in imaging speeds, using probes with high peak emission rates (i.e., 10 6 photons detected per molecule per second), may be the most important (and perhaps overlooked) property. While organic dyes can emit very large numbers of photons, they are still limited in emission rate by blinking, flicker, and saturation. Furthermore, very little data on maximum emission rate per molecule is availabledmost studies focus on number of detected photons, measured extinction coefficient and quantum yield, which do not address emission rate at saturation. To optimize use and choice of probes, there is considerable need for systematic photophysical studies of probes used for localization microscopy, such as those being carried out by Markus Sauer (van de Linde & Sauer, 2014), Carlos Bustamante (Lee, Shin, Lee, & Bustamante, 2012) , Dominique Bourgeois (Avilov et al., 2014) , and others.",

Development of increasingly efficient algorithms for larger numbers of spatially overlapping PSFs is of great interest, and can enable live cell imaging with speeds fivefold faster or more, especially when coupled to use of labels with high emission rates (Huang et al., 2013) . In addition, high-speed cameras capable of imaging the action are also crucial, and recent developments in sCMOS and EMCCD sensor technology and electronics for readout have helped the field tremendously.

As all interactions between light and a biological sample can potentially cause disruption of biological function, super-resolution techniques (including both STED and localization-based methods) seem to be particularly susceptible; the high intensities often used are expected to cause more damage, and the short length scales typically of interest are also more likely to manifest changes (however subtle). Notwithstanding, there is very little consensus in the field related to the intensity or dose thresholds for photodamage. Currently it seems that each group has their own method for testing for possible photodamage, and there seems not to be any standardization, making generalizations extremely difficult. Thus there is considerable need for systematic exploration of this crucial issue. Once better understanding of the most common damage mechanisms has been established, methods can be developed to mitigate photodamage while still allowing nanoscale structures to be imaged.",

Current work in the field is helping to overcome these challenges, so it is likely that in the near future, localization microscopy will become used more widely for quantification of molecular numbers, information which is not directly accessible by a number of other techniques.

Also emerging are new ways to reliably identify tagged species when there may be spectral overlap (including ratiometric analyses, but also the development of color recognition in sensor systems).

While many models propose a starting and ending point in a dynamic process, the steps and dynamics which occur between those points can now be visualized directly. More attention should be spent on these \"intermediate points,\" which can strongly govern how a biological system approaches a given outcome, even when multiple models predict the same final outcome.

Not only can this strategy be helpful in discerning differences between models of how membrane proteins are regulated in their spatial distributions, but also it can allow a fuller understanding of the richness of cellular functions and interactions which are possible in such systems. For example, considering the actin cytoskeleton as its native three-dimensional self allows for ABP coupling between actin, membrane proteins, lipids, lateral organization, and three-dimensional membrane topology. That is to say, both proteins and lipids are clearly important. Likewise, as many cellular organelles have three-dimensional structures and complex membrane topologies, it is clear that we must approach such systems three-dimensionally, while also further investigating how lateral organization (i.e., domains) can occur within the membrane.
