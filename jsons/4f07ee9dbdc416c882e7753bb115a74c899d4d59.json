Droplet and contact transmission require relatively close contact between the infected and susceptible individuals for efficient disease transmission. Therefore, spatial spread via these routes of transmission must be driven by human movement.

The model is built on the concept of an infectious cloud surrounding each infected individual, an idea also considered in [20] . In this work we investigate the airborne spread of an infection through a closed spatial environment within which the human population is confined for a prolonged period of time. For example, such outbreaks have been documented in public settings including prisons [21, 22] , boarding schools [23] , long-term care facilities [24] and on board large cruise ships [25, 26] . In the absence of intervention measures, such outbreaks can persist for many weeks. We extend the zero-dimensional model to include the spatial dynamics of airborne-droplet transmission (also known as aerosol transmission) and investigate how an ambient airflow can influence disease spread. Accordingly, we neglect transmission by droplet spray, a close-contact transmission mode that occurs via direct deposition onto a susceptible's mucous membranes, and by (physical) contact transmission. Furthermore, we consider transmission only by respirable expiratory droplets, droplets whose post-evaporation diameter is less than 10 \u00b5m, neglecting transmission by inspirable droplets, droplets whose post-evaporation diameter is between 10 and 100 \u00b5m. We follow [27] and take the droplet post-evaporation diameter to be half the pre-evaporation diameter. Inspirable droplets contribute to disease transmission by inhalation almost immediately after generation (e.g., during the first breath) as they are considerably larger than respirable droplets and they gravitationally settle very fast. As in the case of droplet spray, transmission by inspirable droplets occurs only at close contact.",

Average expiration velocities are 11.7 ms \u22121 and 3.9 ms \u22121 for coughing and speaking respectively [29] . For respirable droplets, the droplet relaxation time, the time required to adjust the droplet velocity to a new condition of forces, is of the order \u223c 10 \u22127 \u2212 10 \u22124 s. Therefore, the droplet velocity rapidly tends to the carrier-gas (air) velocity. The exhaled air flow has been modelled as a continuous turbulent round jet [30, 31] . For a steady-state turbulent jet, small droplets, which follow the instantaneous fluid streamlines, may reach relatively large distances from the source (more than 8 m after 100 s). However, it was argued in [32] , where the air flow within a calm room was calculated via a Computational Fluid Dynamics software, that droplets smaller than 30\u00b5m diameter would disperse within the room without significant influence of gravity or inertia. Accordingly, we consider that the initial velocity of the exhaled respirable droplets is the underlying fluid velocity, namely either the ambient air velocity, or zero in its absence. For convenience, we henceforth refer to the ambient airflow as the ventilation. This airflow could be naturally induced (e.g. a draft through an open window) or be the result of an artificial indoor ventilation system.",

Therefore, the spatial spread of disease will be driven by the diffusion of people as droplets are essentially stationary relative to the human population. Mathematically, this observation follows immediately from the inequality \u03b7 d \u226a \u03b7 p . We first consider the disease spread when a localized infected density is introduced to a uniformly distributed susceptible population. We find that, for small times (t 5 \u2248 3 hours), droplet density rapidly increases until D(x, t) \u2248 I(x, t) and subsequently droplets and infected dynamics are indistinguishable.",

This indicates that there is no separation between droplets and infected individuals and close contact is required for efficient transmission. At larger times the localized infectious peak is observed to grow in amplitude, Figure 2(a) . An outbreak in a closed population could be expected to persist for many weeks. However, times in excess of t = 2000 \u2248 53 days are unrealistic for an influenza epidemic. At such times the model predicts the formation of two infectious traveling pulses, propagating in opposite directions. Accordingly, the density of susceptibles evolves into a wave front slowly infiltrating the completely susceptible population ahead of the front, Figure 2 (b). There are several reasons why this behavior is observed. Firstly, the idealized case of a homogeneous population, where the infected population is surrounded by a constant source of susceptibles is uncharacteristic of a true human population distribution. In the absence of susceptible individuals the density of infected individuals would rapidly decay, Figure 3 . Secondly, once an outbreak is identified within the closed population, interventions such as isolation, quarantine or treatment would be imposed to limit the impact of the outbreak. Diffusion models used to describe the larger scale geographic spread of disease display such traveling wave behavior, with transportation networks simulated using larger diffusion coefficients and timescales of the order of years being considered [6, 7] .",

As before, the droplet density rapidly approaches the density of infected individuals and the two densities are thereafter indistinguishable from each other. We find that, even with very close contact between the two groups, diffusion is too slow a process to effectively transmit infection. In the absence of a susceptible population, and since \u03b7 p \u226a 1, the density of infectious individuals at any point x = x 0 will decay via I(t) = I 0 (x 0 )e \u2212\u03bbt \u2192 0 as t \u2192 \u221e. The lifetime of the infected population is thus 1 \u03bb which (dimensionally) corresponds to the disease infectivity time scale \u03c4 i of 5 days. The infected population recovers before diffusion has time to effectively transmit the infection, \u03c4 i \u226a \u03c4 p . To conclude, in the absence of an ambient airflow, diffusion is an inefficient mechanism for the spatial spread of disease which will, presumably, be driven by contact and droplet transmission during close contact events.",

In order to derive the contact rate with a droplet we assume that each infected person is surrounded by a droplet cloud with volume V cl . It is further assumed that a susceptible individual comes in contact with a droplet through breathing during an encounter with this droplet cloud. If the average breathing rate is B and \u03c4 ct is a characteristic time of breathing during the encounter then the contact rate c d can be expressed as c d = c B V cl \u03c4 ct , where c is the average number of total contacts a susceptible individual has per unit time.

            "text": "a droplet with diameter d 1 = 4 \u00b5m will settle under gravity in a tranquil environment in approximately 50 minutes. Decreasing the droplet diameter by an order of magnitude results in the droplet remaining airborne for approximately 2.56 days. The pathogen inactivation rate \u00b5 p , assumed to be independent of size, is taken to be 8.64 per day[37] and a droplet is effectively removed through pathogen inactivation in under 3 hours. Therefore, pathogen inactivation is a crucial process for the removal of smaller droplets that could, theoretically, take days to settle under gravity alone. Taking both gravitational settling and pathogen inactivation processes into account, droplets remain airborne and infectious for 38.5 minutes (d 1 ) and 2.66 hours (d 2 ).The inclusion of removal through inhalation, the last term on the right-hand-side of Eq.

In an unventilated environment, with v \u2248 0 m s \u22121 the molecular diffusivity of droplets is calculated as D d 1 = 6.2 \u00d7 10 \u221212 m 2 s \u22121 and D d 2 = 8.34 \u00d7 10 \u221211 m 2 s \u22121[36].

The convective timescale \u03c4 c represents the time it takes for the ambient airflow to carry the droplet the entire length of the domain. If l is of the order of 10 1 \u2212 10 3 m then typical convection times are \u03c4 c = O(10 2 \u2212 10 4 ) seconds and, clearly, convection is a fast process relative to the disease dynamics with \u03c4 c \u226a \u03c4 t . Intuitively, this implies that lower ventilation velocities, which increase the convection time \u03c4 c , result in greater disease transmission. The droplet-removal (droplet infectivity) time scale is the inverse of the size-dependent droplet removal rate \u03b1 d with \u03c4 r (d 1 ) \u2248 38.46 minutes and \u03c4 r (d 2 ) \u2248 2.66 hours. Thus, since\u03c4 r (d 1 ) < \u03c4 r (d 2 )we have that \u03bd d 1 < \u03bd d 2 and convection effects, for a constant air-ventilation velocity, are stronger for smaller droplets since they remain airborne longer and can be carried further from their point of origin. Furthermore, \u03bd is inversely proportional to the length l and convection will thus exert greater influence on droplet dynamics over shorter domains as droplets will be rapidly transported the entire length of the domain.The droplet diffusion time scales depend on the presence or absence of an ambient airflow.For an unventilated environment, typical Brownian diffusion time scales will be \u03c4 d (d 1 ) \u223c 10 9 \u221210 13 days and \u03c4 d (d 2 ) \u223c 10 8 \u2212 10 12 days for l \u223c 10 1 \u2212 10 3 m. In a ventilated environment, we estimate the time scale of turbulent diffusion to be \u03c4 tur d \u223c 1 \u2212 10 4 days. Thus, for the short term spread of infection, since droplets are only airborne for O(1 hour) and \u03c4 r \u226a \u03c4 d , diffusion is an insufficient mechanism to transport droplets throughout the domain with the largest influence occurring at very short lengths and with non-zero airflow. However, over such lengths contact and droplet transmission are more likely to drive disease transmission. From the preceding discussion on droplet timescales it is evident that, in a ventilated environment, droplets are rapidly transported out of the domain and disease transmission is comparatively too slow to result in substantial infection. For larger domains convection times can be significantly increased and the transmission of infection will become more efficient (e.g. \u03c4 c \u2248 3.5 days for l = 60, 000 m). We estimate R 0 = 1.34 and \u03bb = 0.005 for d 1 = 4 \u00b5m and R 0 = 0.0019 and \u03bb = 0.022 for d 2 = 0.4 \u00b5m.

However, we emphasize that this is an approximate value obtained for the relatively small diffusion of people and neglecting the possibility of contact and/or droplet transmission. In addition, the true air velocity will depend on the distancefrom the ventilation source, with larger velocities closer to the source. The unstable evolution of an arbitrary perturbation when v = 0.01 m s \u22121 is shown in Figure 5. An infectious pulse can be seen to propagate through the susceptible population in the direction of positive air flow. Droplet and infected densities are qualitatively similar and only slightly out of phase with each other, with droplets propagating ahead of the infectious pulse. Dynamically this implies that, for small air velocities, the dynamics of droplets and infectious individuals are closely coupled and only separate from each other at sufficiently high velocities. Finally, we consider the spatial transmission of infection resulting from a heterogeneous initial population distribution, where infected and susceptible populations are placed at separate locations in the domain, Figure 6. For small times, t 10 \u2248 6 hours, the infected population generate droplets which are subsequently transported in the direction of positive air flow.

At later times these secondary cases produce droplets of their own and a secondary peak in the droplet curve can be observed, t = 500 \u2248 13 days. The amplitude of the secondary curve for infectious individuals is obviously influenced by the initial distance between the infectious and susceptible populations. At large times, t = 1000 \u2248 26 days, it is clear that the amplitudes of both curves for infectious individuals decay. This behaviour results from the decay of the initial infectious population through recovery and the subsequent reduction in droplets being convected towards the susceptible region. This demonstrates that it is possible for infection to occur in the absence of an infected population and purely as the result of the airborne non-diffusive transport of aerosol droplets.6. DiscussionIn this work we developed a model for the spatial spread of an airborne infection driven by pathogen-carrying droplets. Two droplet diameter values, d 1 = 4 \u00b5m and d 2 = 0.4 \u00b5m, were considered that are representative of experimentally determined droplet size distributions. Droplet dynamics are governed by generation and removal processes, the latter being dominated by gravitational settling and pathogen inactivation. Inactivation is a particularly crucial removal process for smaller droplets that could remain airborne for days. Smaller droplets are found to be a weak disease vector. Their relatively large generation rates do not result in greater transmission due to the small viral load and the associated duration required to transmit infection. Transmission is, thus, dominated by the larger droplets.A delay equation was derived for the droplet density as a function of the infected population density. The role of droplets in disease transmission is to introduce a delay into the system, with disease transmission at a given time dependent on the number of infected individuals present at a previous time. The equation also highlights how droplet-driven transmission decays with distance from the source of infection.",

In the homogeneous scenario and for long time scales, the model displays the classic infectious wave propagating through a susceptible population, following an initial transient state until a balance is achieved between droplet generation and removal processes. In contrast, human diffusion is an insufficient mechanism to transmit disease in the heterogeneous scenario, with the infected population recovering before encountering sus-ceptible individuals, \u03c4 i \u226a \u03c4 d . However, the inclusion of ventilation effects and the subsequent transport of droplets from the source of infection can result in a secondary outbreak if susceptible individuals are encountered. This signifies that infection is possible without direct contact between susceptible and infected individuals. Furthermore, it was shown that increasing the velocity above a critical value can impair disease transmission in a homogeneously distributed population as droplets will be rapidly transported out of the domain causing minimal infection since the time required for transmission is large relative to the convective time scale \u03c4 c \u226a \u03c4 t . The use of ventilation to prevent disease transmission is well-accepted by both society and science. However, little work has been done on implementing control strategies based on this knowledge. Identifying optimum air velocities for indoor environments could mitigate transmission and reduce the disease burden in health-care facilities, schools and other densely populated locations. The model presented here indicates that, in a fixed size environment, the distribution of sick/healthy individuals and the ambient air velocity are the primary factors to consider when analysing such an intervention.
