            "text": "Many new and clinically important picornaviruses have been discovered during the last few years due to advances in metagenomics and other molecular biological approaches. Both the enterovirus (EV) genus and the human parechovirus (HPeV) species of the parechovirus genus have been expanded with a number of new genotypes (Benschop et al., 2008, Oberste et al., 2007). The EV genus now contains more than 100 genotypes, and the HPeV species contains 16 genotypes (www.picornaviridae.com). As the number of genotypes increases, the diagnostic methods need to be validated and updated if necessary in order to ensure a high sensitivity and specificity. From a clinical perspective, both the EVs and the HPeVs are capable of causing meningitis and septicaemia, as well as more trivial illnesses like rhinitis and unspecific fever without other symptoms, and diseases with these viruses have been described as indistinguishable in neonates (Verboon-Maciolek et al., 2008). Therefore, it seemed prudent to develop a diagnostic test that included both EV and HPeV. Consequently, the EV assay in use at Statens Serum Institut (SSI) was updated and combined with a previously published HPeV assay (Baumgarte et al., 2008), thereby creating a multiplex one-step real-time RT-PCR (reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction) assay for simultaneous detection of EV and HPeV.",

Primers (EV08-1 GGTGCGAAGAGTCTATTGAGC; EV08-2 CACCCAAAGTAGTCGGTTCC) were designed using the primer3 software (http://frodo.wi.mit.edu/primer3/), and the probe (Fam-CCGGCCCCTGAATG) was designed as a MGB (minor groove binder) probe using the Primer Express software (Applied Biosystems, Life Technologies, Naerum, Denmark). This new EV assay was combined with an already published HPeV assay (Baumgarte et al., 2008) resulting in a multiplex assay. The HPeV specific probe was labelled with a Hex-dye. The HPeV assay was not validated beyond the multiplex combination as the assay had already been published.",

Since the primary evaluation of the PCR, the 2009 and 2010 QCMD enterovirus/parechovirus panels and the 2009 and 2010 WHO poliovirus panels have also been tested in the multiplex assay. The multiplex assay could detect all EV positive samples in the 2010 QCMD panel (10\u22127 dilution of CA9, E11, E30 and EV71; 10\u22126 dilution of CB3, 10\u22125 dilution of CA9, E11, E30, and EV71). In the 2009 panel, the new assay detected all (10\u22127 dilution of CB3; 10\u22126 dilution of CA16, E16, and P3; 10\u22125 dilution of CB3, E11, and EV71) but the most diluted preparations of CB3 (10\u22128) and EV71 (10\u22127) tested positive by 27% and 41% of all other participants, respectively. In the parechovirus part of the 2010 QCMD panel, HPeV type 3 was detected in the 10\u22124, but not the 10\u22126 dilution. The latter dilution, categorised by QCMD as infrequently detected, had been detected by 63% of all other participants. In the 2009 QCMD panel, none of the 2 HPeV type 3 positive samples (10\u22125 and 10\u22127) were found positive.",

However, when analysing specimens with a suspected low concentration of virus, such as cerebrospinal fluid samples, a drop in sensitivity should not be tolerated (Bennett et al., 2011). A contemporary study by Bennett et al. (2011) has also described an enterovirus parechovirus multiplex PCR assay. Their study used two published EV and HPeV assays in multiplex format comparing two commercially available enzyme kits. In this study a new enterovirus assay has been developed and combined with an established parechovirus assay, and the functionality of this multiplex assay has been demonstrated. A continuous revalidation and update of existing EV assays is essential as the number of viruses has been increasing considerably over the last few years. Both the multiplex assay by Bennett et al. (2011) and the assay presented in this paper have been evaluated with the 2010 EV/HPeV QCMD panel. The same high sensitivity for EV was found with both tests, whereas the method presented by Bennett et al. seems to be slightly more sensitive for HPeV-3 as their method alone could detect the highest dilution (10\u22126) of HPeV-3.",
