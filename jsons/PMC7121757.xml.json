            "text": "References to natural disasters are scattered through the surviving documents of the ancient Greeks and Romans, and abundant geological and archaeological evidence offers confirmation for them. The Mediterranean area is the unstable meeting place of several of the Earths moving tectonic plates, so that earthquakes are common, as are sporadic volcanic eruptions of various kinds and intensities, from the explosion of the island of Thera in the seventeenth century BCE to the relatively constant rumblings, smoking, and lava flows of Mount Etna. Thucydides (3.89) gives an excellent circumstantial account of a tsunami that struck the Aegean seacoasts in 426 BCE and concludes that the cause was an earthquake (Papadopoulos and Chalkis 1984). Pliny the Elder (Historia Naturalis 2.82, 83, 86) remarks that earthquakes cause waves at sea and inundations on land. A major earthquake off the west coast of Crete in 365 CE created a tsunami that killed thousands of people in the Nile Delta and elsewhere around the coasts of the eastern Mediterranean (Stiros 2001, 545\u2013562). Other earthquakes caused landslides and avalanches (Guidoboni 1994). The climate, although much admired by northern Europeans, is unstable, with extreme variations in rainfall from year to year producing heat and cold waves, flood, and drought. Floods are natural disasters because they result from excessive precipitation, but they are much more sudden, and carry damaging material such as rocks and silt, when forests have been removed from the watersheds by fire and/or cutting by humans. The latter is certainly true of the floods of the Tiber River in Rome, which increased in frequency over the centuries as the land upstream was deforested (see Aldrete 2007). The predictable annual flood of the Nile in Egypt provided a blessed gift of water and fertile soil, but either low or very high floods could bring lean years and famine (Garnsey 1988). Winds such as the sirocco and mistral cause sand- and dust storms, while thunderstorms are an annual occurrence, and cyclones and tornadoes or waterspouts are not uncommon.",

Most noteworthy were the plagues that killed appreciable proportions of human populations during their attacks. Nosos and loimos, the Greek words for plague, are general terms for disease; in Latin, the equivalents are pestis and pestilentia. The most-noted instances in ancient Greek and Roman sources are the plague of Pericles in Athens, which began in 430 BCE; the plague of Marcus Aurelius in Rome, 165 CE; and the plague of Justinian in Constantinople, 542 CE. These diseases, which are not easy to identify, occasioned the loss of as much as 20\u201340 % of the population in the areas they affected. Malaria, which incrementally invaded the Mediterranean basin, became an undulating drain on health and population rather than a sudden disaster, and although the fact that mosquitos are the vector was unknown, people learned to avoid living in wetlands, building villages on hilltops where possible (Sallares 2002).",

            "text": "It is clear that many natural disasters can be identified in the classical Mediterranean world, but it becomes more problematic to recover the responses of people and societies to disasters. There are several important reasons for this. One is the simple lack of evidence for some periods and places, especially from early times and less urbanized areas. Literature survives from the upper, educated class, from those who could write it and whose texts were valued by later generations of literati. Another factor is that many descriptions of disaster were written long afterward, lacking direct sources of information and possibly corrupted by tendentious explanations that had arisen in the interim. It is also all too easy for a writer to imagine how he and his society might have reacted in a similar situation and to impute that reaction to different people living under other circumstances and with different traditions and beliefs. This occurs with a historian writing in Roman times about classical Athens, Plutarch, for example, or with Christian writers like Eusebius or Sozomen writing about what they considered to be pagan antiquity. It can be a pitfall for historians writing in the present age too, this author included, if we are not careful.",

Pericles (see Fig. 7.2), a general and the leading statesman in Athens, had led Athens into war against Sparta. Since the Spartans were the most-feared army in Greece, while the Athenian navy ruled the waters of the adjacent seas, the Athenians had built strong walls around the city and parallel walls connecting it with the port of Piraeus (see Fig. 7.3) so that they could have naval and mercantile access to the sea without exposing themselves to Spartan incursions on land. When the war began, Pericles ordered the Athenians to abandon their farms and other holdings and move inside the walls, abandoning the countryside to the Spartans, who made an annual invasion and ravaged the crops but did not attack the walls. Conditions inside the city were very crowded; in the emergency, citizens occupied every bit of ground even including sacred groves. Estimates of the Athenian population vary, but it is probable that the normal peacetime population in metropolitan Athens and Piraeus was around 100,000, with perhaps 200,000 additional in the rest of Attica. Recognizing that many Athenians were absent from the city with military expeditions on land and sea,1 it still seems safe to say that the population within the walls at least doubled as a result of the Periclean decree. Ships brought food and other necessities into Piraeus, and it was through the port that the plague also arrived. Thucydides reported that the first cases appeared there.\n\n",

Thucydides does not try to guess the name of the contagion but gives a detailed clinical description of the symptoms, which he knew well because he had experienced them himself and wanted his readers to recognize them if the disorder should recur:Many who were in perfect health, all in a moment, and without any apparent reason, were seized with violent heats in the head and with redness and inflammation of the eyes. Internally the throat and the tongue were quickly suffused with blood, and the breath became unnatural and fetid. There followed sneezing and hoarseness; in a short time the disorder, accompanied by a violent cough, reached the chest; then fastening lower down, it would move the stomach and bring on all the vomits of bile to which physicians have ever given names; and they were very distressing. An ineffectual retching producing violent convulsions attacked most of the sufferers, some as soon as the previous symptoms had abated, others not until long afterward. The body externally was not so very hot to the touch, nor yet pale; it was of a livid color inclining to red, and breaking out in pustules and ulcers. But the internal fever was intense; the sufferers could not bear to have on them even the finest linen garment; they insisted on being naked, and there was nothing that they desired more eagerly than to throw themselves into cold water. And many of those who had no one to look after them actually plunged into the rain tanks, for they were tormented by unceasing thirst, which was not in the least assuaged whether they drank little or much. They could not sleep; a restlessness that was intolerable never left them. While the disease was at its height the body, instead of wasting away, held out amid these sufferings in a marvelous manner, and either they died on the seventh or ninth day, not of weakness, for their strength was not exhausted, but of internal fever, which was the end of most; or, if they survived, then the disease descended into the bowels and there produced violent ulceration; severe diarrhea at the same time set in, and at a later stage caused exhaustion, which finally with few exceptions was fatal. For the disorder which had originally settled in the head passed gradually through the whole body, and, if a person got over the worst, would often seize the extremities and leave its mark, attacking the privy parts and the fingers and the toes; and some escaped with the loss of these, some with the loss of their eyes. Some again had no sooner recovered than they were seized with a forgetfulness of all things and knew neither themselves nor their friends. (Thucydides, Peloponnesian War, 2.49)\n",

No present-day communicable malady matches exactly this list of symptoms, but disease organisms can mutate genetically and phenotypically, and this is certainly possible over a period of 2,500 years. Nevertheless, numerous attempts, some of them very convincing, have been made to identify the outbreak as bubonic plague, typhus, measles, anthrax, smallpox, hemorrhagic fever, or even toxic shock syndrome or Ebola virus. Typhoid fever is possibly the most likely candidate; a study of the dental pulp of the skulls of victims by Dr. Manolis Papagrigorakis (2006) and others at the University of Athens found in a burial pit that can be dated to the first years of the Peloponnesian War (see Fig. 7.4) shows DNA sequences similar to those of the bacterium that causes typhoid. I recited a list of the symptoms reported by Thucydides to Dr. Eric A. Hughes, M.D., Ph.D., a recognized authority in the field of communicable disease and my son-in-law, and he immediately suspected that it was typhoid. Thucydides writes that carrion-eating birds and dogs either died of the plague or escaped it by not touching the bodies of the dead. Typhoid is known to have canine and avian victims.\n",

As I write (2012), they are raging in parts of sub-Saharan Africa, such as Zambia, Zimbabwe, and the Democratic Republic of Congo, with millions of victims. Usually, outbreaks are local and caused by contamination of water and food by fecal material from infected persons or animals. A rumor reported by Thucydides said that the Peloponnesians (the Spartans and their allies) had poisoned the open reservoirs that supplied Piraeus. He did not believe the rumor, and it is unlikely that the Spartans were guilty since they were not suffering from the plague (Thucydides, Peloponnesian War, 2.57),2 but the story does connect its spread with the water supply. It is more likely that the city\u2019s water was contaminated after the plague entered, given the overcrowded conditions. There were numerous wells, local springs, and cisterns that might have received sewage, and even the bodies of victims crazed with thirst, whereas the main supply came through an aqueduct that ran 7.5 km (2.3 miles), from nearby Mount Hymettus, built in the sixth century BCE by the tyrant Peisistratus and his sons, with branches added later from other mountains including Parnes and Penteliko (Tassios 2006, 2007). These were tunnels with vertical airshafts usable for maintenance access built at a distance apart of 40\u201350 m; the diameter of these shafts is about 1.5 m (4\u20135 ft), and many of them still exist (Crouch 1993). Outside Athens, the conduits met in a large reservoir, from which the water was distributed by a ramification of underground channels throughout the city. The main one under the agora, which supplied the main springhouse called Enneakrounos (\u201cfountain with nine spouts\u201d), is high and broad enough to allow two men to pass in it. Often pipes of baked clay, about 20 cm (8 in.) in diameter, were laid within them (Koutsoyiannis et al. 2008). This system was built to prevent enemies from interfering with it, but the Spartans, in control of everything outside the walls, could have cut the aqueducts at times, inadvertently causing the Athenians to use sources inside the city that, unknown to them, carried the disease organisms. Whether there was interference with the aqueducts or not, the crowding would have caused water shortage and the use of many sources other than the aqueducts (Hanson 2005, 65, 68).",

            "text": "The reactions to the plague as reported by Thucydides are not always those that might be expected by those with some knowledge of ancient Greek literature. The Homeric poems (Iliad, 1, 33\u201367) say that the gods, Apollo in particular, send pestilence when they are angry. They do this not to punish some sin or moral failure but to avenge dishonor against themselves or those they protect. It would be reasonable to expect that the Athenians would ask which of the gods had smitten them with the plague and which offerings to make to mollify the divine anger. Nothing of the sort is mentioned by Thucydides, who says people noticed that those who worshipped the gods died with the same frequency as those who did not. He does say that old men remembered an ancient oracle that said \u201cA Dorian [Spartan] war shall come and with it a pestilence\u201d (2.54.2). Then, further showing his skepticism in matters of religion, he notes that the word loimos (pestilence) is pronounced about the same as limos (famine) and that the oracle could be taken in more than one way, as often happened. Another oracle, from Apollo at Delphi, promised the Spartans that he would fight on their side, and since Apollo\u2019s weapons in the Iliad are arrows of plague and that the plague did not affect the Spartans, Thucydides recalls that some Athenians believed that depressing interpretation of the oracle. The Spartans, fearing that they might contract the plague from the Athenians, did not invade Attica in 429, although they returned the next year. But the connection of disease with the gods remained; a temple to Asclepius, the god of healing and son of Apollo, was erected near the Theater of Dionysus below the south side of the Acropolis in 420 BCE (see Fig. 7.5), after the abatement of the plague (Mitchell-Boyask 2008, 1). Sophocles\u2019 play Oedipus Rex, written soon after or even during the Athenian plague, opens with a disease devastating Thebes, and although in the play the cause of the disaster is refusal to accept an oracle of Apollo, the chorus specifically blames the plague on Ares, the god of war. Sophocles\u2019 Theban plague was undoubtedly a reference to the Athenian plague he had experienced and the character Oedipus a likely metaphor for Pericles.\n",

He is the most astute social critic among ancient historians, analyzing the underlying reasons why individuals on different sides of a conflict make the decisions they do. He shows that in times of war and other disasters, they abandon more embracing considerations of community life for narrow personal interest, and society degenerates into partisanship and even anarchy. He portrays this clearly in the case of the plague. Since those who helped friends that had the disease usually caught it themselves, others decided to leave them to suffer. The sacrosanct way in which burial rites were held by the ancient Greeks is illustrated by the character Antigone in Sophocles\u2019 play of the same name, who was willing to die in order to give her brother burial. But Thucydides says that facing the ongoing destruction of human life by the plague, the Athenians abandoned the most-hallowed rituals for cremating the dead, even throwing corpses on the funeral pyres of strangers. This is confirmed by archaeological evidence showing the neglect of traditional burial customs, in that skeletons among the 150 found in the plague pit mentioned above that were found at the lower levels were better arranged but in a chaotic state near the top as if they were simply thrown in (pp. xii\u2013xii, Mitchell-Boyask 2008; see also Baziotopoulou-Valavani 2002).",

Two of his sons had caught it and died. His speech indicates that he intended to lead Athens through the rest of the war, but that was not to be. Within a few weeks, he contracted the plague and died from it. Thucydides estimates the total number of plague deaths among the Athenian military as 4,400 heavily armed infantry and 300 cavalry (who were from the upper class), along with \u201ca number of the multitude\u201d (3.87). The worst result of the plague according to Thucydides was that it killed Athens\u2019s best leader at the time when he was most needed. The plague returned in the 2 years after Pericles\u2019 death and then slowly disappeared. Athens fought the war for another quarter century, punctuated by a cold war \u201cpeace\u201d involving proxy wars and a hubristic but ultimately tragic campaign in Sicily.

It was not that Romans were ignorant of volcanoes. Mount Etna on Sicily, just across the strait of Scylla and Charybdis, smoked almost all the time and coughed up lava fairly often, and small islands in the Tyrrhenian Sea such as Vulcano and Stromboli put on a good show as well. Silius Italicus writes of a flare-up of Vesuvius in 217 BCE \u201cwith flames worthy of Etna\u201d (Punica 8.653\u2013655, 12.140\u2013157), which is possibly confirmed by stratigraphy in the local area and ice core evidence from distant Greenland (De Boer and Sanders 2002, 80; Stothers 2002, 182\u2013185). An earlier explosion detected by modern volcanologists is the Avellino eruption of Vesuvius around 1640 BCE, which covered the area that is Naples today (Sulpizio et al. 2010, 559). Diodorus Siculus (Bibliotheca Historica 4.21.5), Vitruvius (De Architectura 2.6.2), and Strabo (Geography 4.5.8), all writing before 79 CE, thought that the rocks and activity on Vesuvius indicated past eruptions (De Carolis and Patricelli 2003, 41). Strabo believed they had ceased, saying, \u201cone might infer that in earlier times this district was on fire and had craters of fire and then because the fuel gave out, was quenched\u201d (Strabo, Geography 4.5.8.). Seneca leaves Vesuvius off his list of well-known volcanoes (Seneca, Quaestiones Naturales 6.1, 6.27). Pliny the Elder (Historia Naturalis 2.110) lists all the volcanoes he has heard of, and other places where fire comes out of the ground, including some near the Bay of Naples but does not include Vesuvius. He must not have recognized its volcanic character or perhaps thought it was extinct and not worth mentioning. It is therefore not surprising that when Pliny the Younger on one day in 79 CE5 was called away from his books to see what he described as an awesome cloud shaped like a pine tree, with a trunk rising up in the air to a high elevation where it spread out (see Fig. 7.7), what we might call a \u201cmushroom cloud,\u201d he had to guess which place it was coming from. Soon afterward, he learned that it was Vesuvius.\n\n",

His mother, Plinia Marcella, was the sister of Pliny the Elder, renowned author of Natural History, a comprehensive encyclopedia of the Roman state of knowledge about every aspect of nature, which is extant, as well as several histories that are mostly lost. Uncle Pliny was in residence as prefect (admiral) of the most important naval base in the Roman Empire at Misenum in the Bay of Naples, within sight of Vesuvius (see Fig. 7.8), and his sister and nephew were staying with him at his villa there (see Fig. 7.9). He had no children, so his will (to be read all too soon) adopted the younger Pliny and endowed him with his very considerable wealth and extensive properties. Pliny the Younger\u2019s father had died when he was young, so he lived with his mother, Plinia Marcella; his uncle and his guardian Lucius Verginius Rufus were with the army on the German frontier most of the time while he was growing up. In the years after 79, Pliny rose rapidly in the cursus honorum, the ladder of position and political power. He studied law under Quintilian, entered the Senate, was chosen Consul (the highest Senatorial office), and became a member of the judicial council of the emperor Trajan. This is the trajectory of a man whose life was dedicated to supporting the political structure of the Roman Empire. Finally, he was appointed imperial legate (governor) of the province of Bithynia and Pontus (between the Sea of Marmora and the Black Sea in what is now northwestern Turkey). We are lucky to have a generous sampling of his copious correspondence, including letters to emperors and literary figures such as Tacitus, writer of the Histories (Pliny the Younger, Epistles 6.16, 6.20), to whom the letters describing the eruption were written about 25 years after the event.6 While we must allow for distortion of memory over the intervening time, Pliny\u2019s vivid account conveys the impression of immediacy.\n\n",

His lifelong devotion to natural science asserted itself. He decided to take a small ship across the bay to observe at closer hand, and invited his nephew to join him, but the younger man decided that reading about the past was more important to him than observing the present, so he stayed behind. On leaving the house to board the boat, the elder Pliny was given a letter from his friend Rectina, who was in her villa at the foot of Vesuvius, and could get away only by boat. He decided to try to rescue victims of the eruption and ordered the fleet to assist. Finding that shallow water and debris from the volcano prevented him from landing, he used the wind to cross the bay to Stabiae, where he found that another friend, Pomponianus, had loaded his boats to escape but could not due to the contrary wind and rough waves. Demonstrating unwarranted calm in the face of danger, Pliny the Elder bathed, dined, and took a nap. By then, the stones and ash had piled up so deep that they threatened to trap him in his room. He and his friends realized that if they decided to remain there, they would be buried, so they went down to the shore in total darkness with pillows tied on their heads as protection against falling rocks. Then Pliny, an obese man who had trouble breathing, died overcome by ash, gases, and overexertion, and the others had to abandon his body. It was found 2 days later, his nephew learned, clothed, and looking more asleep than dead. Experience studying modern volcanic disasters indicates that death in circumstances like this most likely results from asphyxiation due to fine ash filling and plugging the lungs and esophagus, but the reason Pliny died while his companions survived is probably his corpulence, overexertion, and weak constitution.",

First, denial. Like his uncle, he had a bath followed by dinner and then tried to sleep but was roused when his mother, terrified, broke into his room. They sat on the terrace while Pliny resumed his reading of Livy, rejecting the warnings of a friend of his uncle. Then, since the house was shaking violently and threatening to collapse, they decided to flee from the town, along with a crowd of others. Their carts were thrown around by the earthquakes. They paused, only to see the seawater retreating in advance of a tsunami and the ominous pyroclastic cloud approaching across the bay over Capri to the cape of Misenum itself. He and his mother fled a little further then stopped because absolute darkness overtook them. He heard the vocal exclamations of the refugees:You could hear women lamenting, children crying, men shouting. Some were calling for parents, others for children or spouses; they could only recognize them by their voices. Some bemoaned their own lot, others that of their near and dear. There were some so afraid of death that they prayed for death. Many raised their hands to the gods, and even more believed that there were no gods any longer and that this was one last unending night for the world. Nor were we without people who magnified real dangers with fictitious horrors. Some announced that one or another part of Misenum had collapsed or burned; lies, but they found believers. It grew lighter, though that seemed not a return of day, but a sign that the fire was approaching. The fire itself actually stopped some distance away, but darkness and ashes came again, a great weight of them. We stood up and shook the ash off again and again; otherwise we would have been covered with it and crushed by the weight. I might boast that no groan escaped me in such perils, no cowardly word, but that I believed that I was perishing with the world, and the world with me, which was a great consolation for death.

Pliny does not report anyone blaming the likeliest gods, Vulcan himself or the malevolent Titans, who were imprisoned under volcanoes according to mythology. And yet the gods were seen as causes of disasters like this. Martial, who was a contemporary of Pliny, lamented the destruction of a rich agrarian landscape (Stefani 2010):This is Vesuvius, green yesterday with viney shades; here had the noble grape loaded the dripping vats; these ridges Bacchus loved more than the hills of Nysa [his home]; on this mount of late the Satyrs set afoot their dances; this was the haunt of Venus, more pleasant to her than Lacedaemon; this spot was made glorious by the fame of Hercules [Herculaneum].

Volcanic deposits can become some of the richest agricultural lands on Earth because they contain a wide variety of the elements needed for plant growth. In the Mediterranean region, these rich black soils contrast with the meager red and yellow soils that develop on the prevalent limestone base (Fisher et al 1997). They attract farmers to the very places that may be in danger of further eruptions. In addition, the pozzolano ash deposits that were the main ingredient of Roman concrete attracted miners to the region around Vesuvius (De Boer and Sanders 2002, 74\u2013107; Darley 2011, 18). The only effective plan to avoid damage and loss of life from eruptions is to avoid settlement on volcanic soils near an active volcano. Because the length of time between eruptions can be many years, generations, or even millennia, the short-term economic needs of people lead them to bet against a new eruption in their own lifetimes or those of their children.

It is probable that his reimbursement for lost property actually worked and that well-to-do Romans were able to rebuild their villas on the shores of the bay, although they may not have been in a hurry to reoccupy them. Survivors could be helped to resettle in nearby towns. However, the restoration of the deeply buried cities soon appeared to be impossible. Repair had always taken place after earthquakes, but the sites of Pompeii and Herculaneum were not reoccupied in ancient times. Residents and looters tunneled into Pompeii, breaking through walls as they looked for treasure. In Herculaneum, the solidified pyroclastics defeated any such efforts. \u201cWhen this wasteland regains its green, will men believe that cities and peoples lie beneath?\u201d asked Statius (Silvae 4.4). Evidently not. Farms were opened above the phantom ruins, but the sterile volcanic ashes were transformed into soil of exceptional richness only after decades (Allison 2010).

Humans are powerless against volcanoes, so the plans have to involve relocation outside the danger area or evacuation before or during an eruption. The Italian government has endorsed both approaches. Relocation is unpopular; the amount offered as a subsidy is small, and only 5,697 families applied in the first 2 years, a number smaller than those who have moved to the slopes of Vesuvius, many illegally, and occupy homes that may not meet building standards. In 1995, the Italian Civil Protection Agency approved a Vesuvius evacuation plan that assumes a warning of about 2 weeks before an eruption on the basis of seismicity, ground deformation, geochemistry of gas, and gravitometry. These factors are all recorded by the Vesuvius Observatory, founded in 1841 on the mountain by Fernando II, King of the Two Sicilies, as the world\u2019s first scientific volcano observatory. The building on Vesuvius is now a museum, while the work of the volcanologists has been moved to Naples. The evacuation plan defines a red zone containing a number of villages around the volcano, with a total population of almost 700,000, to be evacuated by bus, train, and boat to other parts of Italy in advance of an eruption. The plan has been attacked and its implementation stymied by bitter political controversy. A counterplan called Vesuvius 2000 was prepared at a conference of scientists and experts and described the government plan as inadequate, which of course it could well prove to be in an actual event (Dobran 2006). Meanwhile, real estate promoters and others with development interests tell people that Vesuvius is extinct. Scientists, gathering information from benchmarks, gravity stations, seismic stations, tidal gauges, and leveling lines for surveillance of changes and having detected a huge pool of magma under the mountain, disagree.",

Pliny reports that those around him when he fled from his uncle\u2019s house were disoriented, panicked, and willing to follow anyone who looked as if he knew what he was doing, whether this was true or not. The fact that he tries to portray himself as calm in the midst of storm only protests his own disorientation.

The pestilence ran its course but weakened the military strength and leadership of Athens. Titus, who had shared imperial power with Vespasian for about 9 years, became sole emperor only 2 months before Vesuvius blew its top. He organized relief efforts intended to prevent anarchy in an essential part of Italy, but full restoration proved impossible, and he perished 2 years later, when power was seized by Domitian, a man ill suited to wield it.",
