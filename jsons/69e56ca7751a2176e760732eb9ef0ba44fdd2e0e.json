Second, the 6-carboxytetramethylrhodamine (TAMRA)-labeled PCR products were hybridized specifically with oligonucleotide microarrays. Finally, matched duplexes were detected by using a laser-induced fluorescence scanner. The usefulness of this method was illustrated by analyzing severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus RNA. The detection limit was 10 0 copies/\u03bcL. The results of the asymmetric multiplex nested reverse transcription-PCR were in agreement with the results of the microarray hybridization; no hybridization signal was lost as happened with applicons from symmetric amplifications. This reliable method can be used to the identification of other microorganisms, screening of genetic diseases, and other applications.",

The common problems encountered in multiplex PCR are spurious amplification products, uneven or no amplification of some target sequences, and difficulties in reproducing the results. A successful multiplex PCR assay needs the following parameters to be set properly: relative concentration of the primers, concentration of the PCR buffer, balance between the magnesium chloride and dNTP concentrations, cycling temperatures, and amount of template and DNA polymerase. An optimal combination of annealing temperature and buffer condition is essential to ensure high specificity of multiplex PCR. Magnesium chloride concentration needs to be proportional to the amount of dNTPs. Adjusting primer concentration for each target sequence is also essential (15, 16) . Henegariu et al. (17) presented a step-by-step protocol for multiplex PCR, after study, of some of these factors.",

The method is especially useful for hybridizing PCR product against probes such as the ones used in microarray hybridizations. Oligonucleotide microarray has provided a powerful platform for nucleic acid analysis (19) (20) (21) (22) . Hybridization of labeled nucleic acid targets with microarrays of surfaceimmobilized oligonucleotide probes was the central event in the detection of nucleic acids on microarrays (23). Before hybridization, the ssDNA targets were prepared by using denaturation of the PCR products or by other methods. Only one of the two DNA strands was available for hybridization with the immobilized probes; the other one competed with the probes for the target and therefore was regarded as the interfering strand (24). What was worse was that the annealing effect of the two complementary strands was dominant, because of their faster kinetics and higher thermodynamic stabilities. Kawai et al. (25) reported that the sensitivity with ssDNA targets was fivefold higher than that with boiled double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) targets, when they were hybridized with oligonucleotide probes. Thus preparation of ssDNA targets was preferred for high efficient hybridization on oligonucleotide microarrays.",

To allow detection of SARS CoV, multiple regions from the open reading frame (ORF) of replicase 1a, spike glycoprotein, and nucleocapsid protein were selected as the targets for hybridization detection. 3. To amplify the four segments from these three ORFs in the genome of SARS CoV, four sets of outer and inner primers were designed, as listed in Table 1 . The four outer primer sets were designed in the selected genes using Primer3 (39) by setting the optimal T m to 67\u00b0C and the size of PCR product from 400 to 1200 bp. Two universal primers were allowed to bind to the 5\u2032 end of the designed inner primers for efficient labeling of the PCR product. 4.

            "text": "quite different from that of another. The most curious factor of multiplex PCR is the competition of the primers involved. The development of an efficient multiplex PCR requires strategic planning and multiple attempts to optimize the reaction conditions. Approaches have been reported with varying degree of success. For example, Shuber et al. (40) added an unrelated sequence to the 5\u2032 end of the primers to reduce the differences in annealing efficiencies of different loci. Henegariu et al. (17) optimized the final concentration of different primers step by step and followed by adjusting the amplification buffer. However, none of the approaches are both time saving and effective enough. 2. Our approach is unique in the utilization of the universal primers in one reaction tube. With a pair of universal primers, the preferential amplification in ordinary multiplex PCR may be avoided. If amplification of one pair of gene-specific primers is inefficient, supplemental amplification would be performed by the universal primers (Fig. 1) . The higher the amplification efficiency of gene-specific primers, the less the universal primers participate in the reaction. So the universal primers probably act as a balancer in the novel multiplex PCR, and different targets may be amplified with nearly equal opportunity. In other word, all the primer pairs in a multiplex PCR should allow similar amplification efficiencies for their respective targets. 3. The universal primer-mediated multiplex PCR has a unique advantage. It makes the optimization of multiplex PCR more straightforward than ever. The concentration of the primers does not need to be adjusted repeatedly to overcome the amplification bias. In this work, all inner primers were with the same concentration, 0.2 \u03bcM. In our laboratory the concentration for gene-specific primers has been used successfully without optimization for over 2 y already. Attention is only paid to the concentration of the universal primer(s), which should be higher than the concentration of the gene-specific primers. In this study the concentration of the universal primers for symmetric multiplex PCR was up to 1 \u03bcM, which confirmed that the primers were competitive with gene-specific primers in the reaction and that enough labeled strand was produced for hybridization. 4. At the initial stage of this research on SARS viral RNA detection, only symmetric multiplex PCR was performed. It was puzzling that no hybridization signal was detectable for probe 40 (see [a] in Fig. 5) . A PCR reaction was performed in which only the pair of inner primers 40 were used. A sharp and bright band with the predicted size was observed on agarose gel, but no hybridization signal was visible (data not shown). So we excluded the possibility of primer interactions in the multiplex PCR reaction. The PCR product was subsequently sequenced, and no mutation was found (data not shown). At that time we were certain that the problem was loss of hybridization signal. To resolve this problem, asymmetric PCR was taken into account automatically. As expected, when asymmetric multiplex PCR was performed, strong fluorescence signal for probe 40 was obtained on the microarrays. 5. Asymmetric PCR is a powerful tool for generating ssDNA. Without self-annealing, ssDNA hybridization with probes should be more efficient than dsDNA, even if dsDNA is denatured by boiling or alkaline treatment before hybridization. Some researchers have reported that hybridization efficiency was much greater with the single-stranded products compared with to the boiled double-strand PCR products (41, 42) . In traditional asymmetric PCR, the primer length or concentration is usually out of proportion. However, if several targets are amplified simultaneously by use of those tactics, the outcomes are often disappointing owing to ineffectiveness or nonspecific amplification. By comparison, the novel asymmetric multiplex PCR reported here is preeminent, because only the universal primers are involved during asymmetric amplification. As shown in Fig. 4 [(b) , (c), (d) vs (a)], with asymmetric PCR amplification efficiency was no less than with symmetric PCR. Above all, the hybridization signal for probe 40 was on, owing to the asymmetric amplification ( Fig. 5 [b-d] ). 6. Why only probe 40 lost the hybridization signal when symmetric PCR was performed is an interesting problem. We have analyzed the GC content of the sequence for all five inner primer amplicons and discovered that the amplicon hybridizing with probe 40 possesses the highest (49.0%) GC content. The GC content for other sequences is from 40.9 to 41.9%. As we know, two strands of DNA rich in G and C will hold to each other more tightly, and they tend to reassociate by themselves after denaturation. This phenomenon may shed partial light on the signal loss for probe 40. Possibly the sequence context of dsDNA also played a role in the signal loss. The loss of signal may be pernicious for hybridization analysis because falsenegative results may be reported. The problem could be resolved by using asymmetric amplification whereby ssDNAs are produced. In this study, the detection limit of the microarray assay for symmetric amplification was 10-fold less than that of asymmetric amplification by virtue of the signal loss of probe 40. 7. Although the asymmetric multiplex PCR reported here works well, a few issues should be kept in mind. The design of the gene-specific primers should comply with the basic principles of conventional multiplex PCR. Special attention to primer design parameters (such as homology of primers with their target nucleic acid sequences, primer length, and GC content) has to be considered (40,43-47), because the overall success of a specific amplification depends on the rate at which primers anneal to their targets, and the rate at which annealed primers are extended along the desired sequence during the early cycles of amplification. The universal primer should be designed to have an appropriate T m with the gene-specific primers (excluding the universal sequence), to have the least homology with the target nucleic acid sequences, and to avoid the formation of dimmers with the gene-specific primers.",

            "text": "Occasionally, even if all these factors are considered, the result may not be the same as predicted owing to the unforeseen interactions of primers. The problem could be solved by changing one of the gene-specific primers. 8. A fluorescence molecule, TAMRA, was labeled to the 5\u2032 end of the universal primers in our study. The hybridization results are in agreement with the asymmetric multiplex PCR results ( Table 3 and Fig. 4) , so we consider the labeling is adequate for scanning. However, there is a hidden trouble. Some DNA strands produced by the gene-specific primers should also be able to hybridize with the corresponding probes printed on the microarrays, but no fluorescence signal is detectable under these circumstances. To increase the hybridization signal, the gene-specific primers may also be end-labeled. 9. SARS is a serious respiratory illness with significant morbidity and mortality rate (31-37). Its diagnosis depends mainly on the clinical findings of an atypical pneumonia not attributed to any other cause and a history of exposure to a suspect or probable case of SARS, or to the respiratory secretions and other bodily fluids of individuals with SARS. Definitive diagnosis of this novel CoV relies on classic tissue culture isolation, followed by electron microscopy studies to identify the virus in cell culture, which is technically very demanding. Serological testing for increasing titer against SARS-associated CoV was shown to be highly sensitive and specific (32) but was not suitable for quick and early laboratory diagnosis. Molecular tests have also been attempted for the detection of this virus or to confirm infection (48,49) . However, only one target was detected in one test using the existing methods, so a higher risk of false negatives was inevitably encountered. Our method is quite different from the existing methods: asymmetric multiplex nested RT-PCR amplification followed by microarray hybridization. The assay was sufficiently sensitive that 10 0 copies/\u03bcL viral RNA could be detected. We have used this method to realize the early sensitive detection of SARS virus from clinic samples (unpublished work). In actual application, the universal primer uf was omitted. In other words, the ratio of 0:1 for universal primer uf to ur was adopted for efficiency and convenience. 10 . In summary, we have established a sensitive and versatile asymmetric multiplex PCR method. Combining with the microarray assay, this method may be applicable in a number of fields, such as identification of microorganisms, detection of the drug-resistant genes, and diagnosis of genetic diseases.",
