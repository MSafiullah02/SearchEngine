These concerns became particularly evident early in the AIDS epidemic. In 1989, the American Heart Association issued guidelines to address concerns related to infection risk during CPR and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention issued guidance for the prevention of HIV and hepatitis B virus transmission to health-care workers (HCWs) and public safety workers.6, 7 Public health officials stressed the lack of evidence for HIV or Hepatitis B virus transmission during CPR even when mouth-to-mouth rescue breathing was used, yet recommended use of barrier devices to further reduce risk.",

A survey of first responders suggested that attitudes toward providing CPR to strangers in an out-of-hospital setting had been adversely affected as a result of the AIDS epidemic.9 Among physicians and nurses in the late 1990s, reluctance to provide mouth-to-mouth resuscitation in outpatient or inpatient settings resulted in marked delays in ventilation.10, 11 Possible discrepancies in quality of CPR delivered to those infected with HIV vs those not infected have been associated with worse outcomes in the former group.12\n",

Consequently, ICU use for the care of patients with AIDS during this era decreased, and end-of-life discussions between patients and their medical providers increased prior to hospital admission.14 By 1988, however, despite lack of effective HIV antiviral therapy, ICU use and subsequent survival of patients with AIDS with Pneumocystis pneumonia increased, likely due to more aggressive supportive care, increasing use of a growing spectrum of antibiotic choices, and the use of steroids as adjunctive therapy.15, 16\n",

Futility does not apply globally to categories of patients, general medical situations, or to all geographic locations. Lifesaving and life-sustaining measures that might be considered futile at a single point in time might not be viewed as such as knowledge or practice advance. Similarly, resuscitation efforts in a resource-limited country where escalated levels of post-resuscitation life support are not available might be futile, whereas the same interventions may be effective in locations where advanced care is readily available.",

These include limitations to physical dexterity and the introduction of barriers to effective communication related to PPE wear. To heighten awareness of these challenges, we have implemented mock code-simulation training sessions. During these scenarios, the code-team members are asked to perform tasks that are likely to be necessary during a resuscitation effort, such as handling the code cart, drawing up and administering medications, placing defibrillation pads on the patients and delivering shocks. The use of PPE can muffle voices and, therefore, requires extra attention to speak with others at a louder level than usual and with clarity. During this training, we emphasize the need to define clear roles and responsibilities to the team members. Importantly, effective communication is achieved by speaking up and clearly, by making direct eye contact with other members of the team, and by practicing closed-loop communication. Additionally, use of hands-free communication devices can be considered under the powered air-purifying respirator hood (e-Appendix 1: emergency response SOP).",
