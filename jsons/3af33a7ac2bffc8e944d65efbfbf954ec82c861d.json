SARS-CoV-2 cellular entry depends on binding 33 between the viral Spike protein receptor-binding domain (RBD) and the 34 angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) target cell receptor. Here, we report 35 on the isolation and characterization of 206 RBD-specific monoclonal 36 antibodies (mAbs) derived from single B cells of eight SARS-CoV-2 infected 37 individuals. These mAbs come from diverse families of antibody heavy and light 38 chains without apparent enrichment for particular families in the repertoire. In 39 samples from one patient selected for further analyses, we found coexistence 40 of germline and germline divergent clones. Both clone types demonstrated 41 impressive binding and neutralizing activity against pseudovirus and live SARS-42 CoV-2. However, the antibody neutralizing potency is determined by 43 competition with ACE2 receptor for RBD binding. Surprisingly, none of the 44 SARS-CoV-2 antibodies nor the infected plasma cross-reacted with RBDs from 45 either SARS-CoV or MERS-CoV although substantial plasma cross-reactivity 46 to the trimeric Spike proteins from SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV was found. 47 These results suggest that antibody response to RBDs is viral species-specific 48 while that cross-recognition target regions outside the RBD. The specificity and 49 neutralizing characteristics of this plasma cross-reactivity requires further 50 investigation. Nevertheless, the diverse and potent neutralizing antibodies 51 identified here are promising candidates for prophylactic and therapeutic 52 SARS-CoV-2 interventions.",

            "text": "53 54 3 Introduction 55 The source of the recent Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak in 56 Wuhan, China is a novel pathogenic coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2 1-4 . Its unique 57 pathogenesis and rapid international transmission poses a serious global 58 health emergency 5-9 . SARS-CoV-2 belongs to the betacoronavirus family and 59 shares substantial genetic and functional similarity with other pathogenic 60 human betacoronaviruses, including Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome 61 Coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 62 (MERS-CoV) 2-4,10,11 . The virus is believed to have originated in bats, although 63 the source and animal reservoirs of SARS-CoV-2 remain uncertain 2-4,10-12 . No 64 SARS-CoV-2-specific treatments or vaccine are currently available but several 65 antiviral drugs including remdesivir are being investigated clinically. 66 SARS-CoV-2 utilizes an envelope homotrimeric Spike glycoprotein (S) to 67 interact with cellular receptor ACE2 2,13,14 . Binding with ACE2 triggers a 68 cascade of cell membrane fusion events for viral entry. Each S protomer 69 consists of two subunits: a globular S1 domain at the N-terminal region, and the 70 membrane-proximal S2 and transmembrane domains. Determinants of host 71 range and cellular tropism are found in the RBD within the S1 domain, while 72 mediators of membrane fusion have been identified within the S2 domain 15,16 . 73 We and others have recently determined the high-resolution structure of SARS-74 CoV-2 RBD bound to the N-terminal peptidase domain of ACE2 14,17 . The 75 overall ACE2-binding mechanism is virtually the same between SARS-CoV-2 76 and SARS-CoV RBDs, indicating convergent ACE2-binding evolution between 77 these two viruses 18-22 . This suggests that disruption of the RBD and ACE2 78 interaction would block SARS-CoV-2 entry into the target cell. Indeed, a few 79 such disruptive agents targeted to ACE2 have been shown to inhibit SARS-80 CoV infection 23,24 . However, given the important physiological roles of ACE2 in 81 vivo 25 , these agents may have undesired side effects. Anti-RBD antibodies, on 82 the other hand, are therefore more favorable. Furthermore, SARS-CoV or 83 MERS-CoV RBD-based vaccine studies in experimental animals have also 84 shown strong polyclonal antibody responses that inhibit viral entry 15,26 . Such 85 critical proof-of-concept findings indicate that anti-RBD antibodies should be 86 4 able to effectively block SARS-CoV-2 entry. Here, we report on the isolation 87 and characterization of 206 RBD-specific mAbs derived from single B cells of 88 eight SARS-CoV-2 infected individuals. Using bioinformatic and biologic 89 characterization, we identified several mAbs with potent neutralizing activity 90 against pseudovirus and live SARS-CoV-2. However, no cross-activity between 91 RBDs from SARS-CoV or MERS-CoV was found, suggesting that the RBD-92 based antibody response is viral species-specific. The potent neutralizing 93 antibodies identified here are promising candidates for prophylactic and 94 therapeutic SARS-CoV-2 interventions. 95 Results 96 Plasma and B cell responses specific to SARS-CoV-2. We collected 97 cross-sectional and longitudinal blood samples from eight 98 SARS-CoV-2-infected subjects during the early outbreak in Shenzhen (Table 99 S1). Samples were named by patient number and either A, B, or C depending 100 on collection sequence. Six patients (P#1 through P#4, P#8, and P#16) had 101 Wuhan travel history and the remaining two (P#5 and P#22) had direct contact 102 with those from Wuhan. P#1 through P#5 is a family cluster with the first 103 documented case of human-to-human transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in 104 Shenzhen 5 . All subjects recovered and were discharged from the hospital 105 except for P#1 who succumbed to disease despite intensive intervention. To 106 analyze antibody binding, serial plasma dilutions were applied to enzyme-linked 107 immunosorbent assay (ELISA) plates coated with either recombinant RBD or 108 trimeric Spike derived from SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV, and MERS-CoV or 109 recombinant NP from SARS-CoV-2. Binding activity was visualized using 110 anti-human IgG secondary antibodies at an optical density (OD) of 450nm. 111 Varying degrees of binding were found across individuals and among samples 112 from the same individual. Samples from P#1, P#2, P#5, and P#16 113 demonstrated higher binding to both SARS-CoV-2 RBD and NP than the rest 114 (Figure 1A). Three sequential plasma samples collected from P#2 over nine 115 days during early infection showed similar binding to SARS-CoV-2 RBD and 116 NP and remained relative stable over the course of the infection. To our surprise, 117 virtually no cross-reactivity between SARS-CoV RBD and MERS-CoV RBD 118 5 was detected (Figure 1A), despite strong recognition by the positive control 119 antibodies (data not shown). However, strong cross-reactivity was detected 120 against trimeric Spikes from SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV in both ELISA (Figure 121 1B) and cell-surface staining (Figure S1). All samples except P#4A 122 demonstrated significant levels of cross-binding to SARS-CoV trimeric Spike 123 while only those from P#1, P#2 and P#4B cross recognized MERS-CoV trimeric 124 Spike (Figure 1B). None of the plasma samples were reactive to HIV-1 125 envelope trimer derived from strain BG505 27 . The same plasma samples were 126 also evaluated for neutralization of pseudoviruses bearing the Spike proteins of 127 either SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV, or MERS-CoV. Consistent with the antibody 128 binding results, varying degrees of neutralizing activities against SARS-CoV-2 129 were found across individuals (Figure 1C). However, cross-neutralizing against 130 SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV is rather minimal as all plasma samples tested, 131 including healthy control plasma, had negligible levels of neutralization (Figure 132 1C). No detectable neutralization was found for any plasma sample against the 133 pseudovirus control bearing the HIV-1 envelope MG04 (Figure 1C). Taken 134 together, these results suggest that RBDs from SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV, and 135 MERS-CoV are likely to be immunologically distinct despite substantial 136 sequence and structural similarities 14,17 . Thus, regions beyond RBDs likely 137 contribute to the observed cross-reactivity against SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV 138 Spike protein. 139 Flow cytometry with a range of gating strategies was used to study 140 SARS-CoV-2-specific B cell responses and identity B cells recognizing 141 fluorescent-labeled RBD probes (Figure 1D and Figure S2). As shown in Figure 142 1E, the RBD-specific B cells constitute about 0.005-0.065% among the total B 143 cell population and 0.023-0.329% among the memory subpopulations. The 144 number of RBD-specific B cells are relatively higher in P#2, P#5, P#16, and 145 P#22 (Figure 1E), which appeared to correlate well with binding activity of 146 corresponding plasma samples to SARS-CoV-2 RBD and trimeric Spike protein 147 (Figure 1A and 1B). However, sample P#1A demonstrated the lowest RBD-148 specific B cell response despite high-level plasma binding. As P#1 was the only 149 patient succumb to disease, it is uncertain whether this dichotomy of high 150 plasma binding activity and low levels of RBD-specific B cells is a surrogate 151 6 marker of rapid disease progression. This phenomenon needs study in a larger 152 population of samples.",

We 155 further isolated RBD-binding B cells into single cell suspension for cloning and 156 evaluation of the mAb response ( Figure 1D and Figure S2 ). Immunoglobulin 157 heavy and light chains were amplified by RT-PCR using nested primers. The 158 amplified products were cloned into linear expression cassettes to produce full 159 IgG1 antibodies as previously described 28, 29 . The number of B cell clones 160 varied from 10 to 106 among the subjects and each clone has been differentially 161 represented ( Figure S3 ). Individual IgGs were produced by transfection of 162 linear expression cassettes and tested for SARS-CoV-2 RBD reactivity by 163 ELISA. On average, fifty-eight percent of the antibody clones were reactive, 164 although great variability was found among different individuals ( Figure S3 ). 165 Out of 358 antibodies, we obtained 206 that bound to SARS-CoV-2 RBD with 166 165 distinct sequences (Table S2) (60-80% of clusters with OD 450 > 3) and low-(< 60% cluster with OD 450 > 3) 186 binding clusters were also widely distributed and each consisted of 187 disproportionally represented VH gene families. (Table S2) . 202 More importantly, these clonally expanded antibodies were identified in all three 203 samples indicating that they are strongly selected for during infection. When 204 comparing their representation within each cluster, VH1-2*06 and VH3-9*01 205 appeared to increase from approximately 33 to 45%, whereas VH3-48*02 206 decreased from 33 to 9% over the three time points, although the number of 207 clones was too small for statistical significance. Interestingly, the somatic 208 hypermutation (SHM) or germline divergence for VH1-2*06 was 0% and this 209 cluster persisted during the study period. However, the SHM for VH3-48*02 210 reached as high as 9.6% and for VH3-9*01 reached 3.8% compared to the 211 overall average of 2.2% \u00b1 3.3 % among the 69 VH sequences. Furthermore, 212 the CDR3 length for VH1-2*06, VH3-48*02, and VH3-9*01 was 19aa, 16aa, CoV-2 RBD showed that P#2 antibodies had dissociation constants (Kd) 226 ranging from 10 -8 to 10 -9 M while those from P#1 ranged from not detectable to 227 10 -9 M (Table 1 and Figure S4 ). SHM did not appear to correlate with Kd; some 228 germline clones with 0% divergence in both VH and VL genes (P2A-1A10, P2B- suggesting that their expansion may not be driven by affinity maturation. Next, 233 we measured each antibody for competition with ACE2 for binding to the SARS- 234 CoV-2 RBD. Specifically, the RBD was covalently immobilized on a CM5 sensor 235 chip and first saturated by antibody and then flowed through with soluble ACE2. 236 Competing capacity of each antibody was measured as percent reduction in 237 ACE2 binding with the RBD (Table 1 and Figure S5 ). As shown in Table 1 MERS-CoV RBD except P1A-1C7 (Kd=4.85\u03bcM), for which only limited cross 249 reactivity with SARS-CoV RBD was detected ( Figure S4 ). 250 We next studied antibody neutralizing activities against pseudoviruses 251 bearing the Spike protein of SARS-CoV-2. Consistent with the competing 252 capacity findings, neutralizing activity varied considerably with IC 50 values 253 ranging from 0.03 to > 50 \u03bcg/ml ( Figure 4B , 4A and Table 1 ). P2C-1F11 and 254 P2B-2F6 were the most potent, followed by P2C-1A3 and P2C-1C10. Overall, 255 ACE2 competing capacity correlated well with the neutralizing activities, 256 although this correlation was not exact in some instances. Notably, no cross- while that of P2C-1A3 was somewhat lower, although it needs to be noted that 264 CPE assay is not particularly quantitative ( Figure 4C ). Lastly, we determined 265 whether these antibodies compete for similar epitopes on the SARS-CoV-2 266 RBD. We selected a total of six antibodies with ACE2 competitive capacities of 267 at least 70% and analyzed them in a pairwise competition fashion using SPR.",

Based on the sequential and 311 structural similarities of RBDs from SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV, we predicted 312 some degree of cross-binding and even cross-neutralization between the two 313 viruses. However, species-specific RBD responses in SARS-CoV-2 patients do 314 11 suggest that RBDs from SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV are immunologically 315 distinct. If so, antibodies and vaccines must target each viral species differently 316 in order to achieve maximum efficacy in protecting the host from infection. Our 317 finding somewhat resolves the question of why many previously isolated 318 SARS-CoV antibodies failed to cross-neutralize SARS-CoV-2 despite 319 detectable levels of binding with Spike of SARS-CoV-2 36 . The absence of cross-320 recognition between RBDs was also apparent at the plasma level. Although 321 strong binding to SARS-CoV-2 RBD was identified, plasma samples from the 322 study subjects failed to demonstrate appreciable cross-reactivity with either 323 SARS-CoV or MERS-CoV RBD, highlighting the immunological distinctions 324 among the RBDs from the three viruses. However, substantial cross-reactivity 325 were found when the same plasma samples were applied to the trimeric Spike 326 proteins of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, although this was higher with the 327 former than the latter. This indicates that such cross-reactivity likely occurs in 328 regions outside the RBD. Determining whether this cross-reactive response 329 has any neutralizing or protection capacity against infection would require 330 further investigation. Finally, despite successfully isolating and characterizing a 331 large of number mAbs against SARS-CoV-2, we cannot draw any firm 332 correlation between antibody response and disease status at this time. In 333 particular, the three severe cases (P#1, P#2, and P#5) appear to have relatively 334 higher plasma binding and neutralizing activities against SARS-CoV-2 than 335 those with relative mild symptoms. A larger number of patients must be studied 336 to elucidate the drivers and impact of associations between antibody response 337 and disease progression, which will provide pivotal reference for our antibody-338 based intervention as well as vaccine development. Patients and blood samples. The study enrolled a total of eight patients aged 347 10 to 66 years old infected with SARS-CoV-2 in January 2020 (Table S1) . A 348 plasma sample from a healthy control was also included. Of these eight patients, Bac-to-Bac baculovirus system (Invitrogen) as previously described 18, 19, [37] [38] [39] .",

The recombinant RBDs and trimeric Spike derived from 389 SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV and the SARS-CoV-2 NP protein 390 (Sino Biological, Beijing) were diluted to final concentrations of 0.5 \u03bcg/ml or 391 2\u03bcg/ml, then coated onto 96-well plates and incubated at 4\u00b0C overnight. 392 Samples were washed with PBS-T (PBS containing 0.05% Tween 20) and 393 blocked with blocking buffer (PBS containing 5% skim milk and 2% BSA) at RT 394 for 1h. Either serially diluted plasma samples or isolated mAbs were added the 395 plates and incubated at 37\u00b0C for 1h. Wells were then incubated with secondary 396 anti-human IgG labeled with HRP (ZSGB-BIO, Beijing) and TMB substrate 397 (Kinghawk, Beijing) and optical density (OD) was measured by a 398 spectrophotometer at 450nm and 630nm. The serially diluted plasma from 399 healthy individuals or mAbs against SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV or HIV-1 were 400 used as controls. 401 Isolation of RBD-specific single B cells by FACS. RBD-specific single B 402 cells were sorted as previously described 28,40 . In brief, PBMCs from infected 403 individuals were collected and incubated with an antibody and RBD cocktail for 404 identification of RBD-specific B cells. The cocktail consisted of CD19-PE-Cy7, 405 CD3-Pacific Blue, CD8-Pacific Blue, CD14-Pacific Blue, CD27-APC-H7, IgG-406 FITC (BD Biosciences) and the recombinant RBD-Strep or RBD-His described 407 above. Three consecutive staining steps were conducted. The first was a 408 LIVE/DEAD Fixable Dead Cell Stain Kit (Invitrogen) in 50\u00b5l phosphate-buffered 409 saline (PBS) applied at RT for 20 minutes to exclude dead cells. The second 410 utilized an antibody and RBD cocktail for an additional 30min at 4 \u00b0C. The third 411 14 staining at 4 \u00b0C for 30min involved either: Streptavidin-APC (eBioscience) 412 and/or Streptavidin-PE (BD Biosciences) to target the Strep tag of RBD, or anti-413 his-APC and anti-his-PE antibodies (Abcam) to target the His tag of RBD. The 414 stained cells were washed and resuspended in PBS before being strained 415 through a 70\u03bcm cell mesh (BD Biosciences). RBD-specific single B cells were 416 gated as CD19+CD3-CD8-CD14-IgG+RBD+ and sorted into 96-well PCR 417 plates containing 20\u03bcl of lysis buffer (5 \u03bcl of 5 x first strand buffer, 0.5 \u03bcl of 418 RNase out, 1.25 \u03bcl of 0.1 M DTT (Invitrogen) per well and 0.0625 \u03bcl of Igepal 419 (Sigma). Plates were then snap-frozen on dry ice and stored at -80 \u00b0C until RT 420 reaction. 421 Single B cell PCR, cloning and expression of mAbs. The IgG heavy and 422 light chain variable genes were amplified by nested PCR and cloned into linear 423 expression cassettes or expression vectors to produce full IgG1 antibodies as 424 previously described 29,41 . Specifically, all second round PCR primers 425 containing tag sequences were used to produce the linear Ig expression 426 cassettes by overlapping PCR. Separate primer pairs containing the specific 427 restriction enzyme cutting sites (heavy chain, 5'-AgeI/3'-SalI; kappa chain, 5'-428 AgeI/3'-BsiWI; and lambda chain, 5'-AgeI/3'-XhoI) were used to amplify the 429 cloned PCR products. The PCR products were purified and cloned into the 430 backbone of antibody expression vectors containing the constant regions of 431 human IgG1. Overlapping PCR products of paired heavy and light chain 432 expression cassettes were co-transfected into 293T cells (ATCC) grown in 24-433 well plates. Antigen-specific ELISA was used to detect the binding capacity of 434 transfected culture supernatants to SARS-CoV-2 RBD. Monoclonal antibodies 435 were produced by transient transfection of 293F cells (Life Technologies) with 436 equal amounts of paired heavy and light chain plasmids. Antibodies in the 437 culture supernatant was purified by affinity chromatography using Protein A 438 beads columns (National Engineering Research Center for Biotechnology, 439 Beijing) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Concentrations were 440 determined by BCA Protein Assay Kits (Thermo Scientific). SARS-CoV, MERS-441 CoV, and HIV-1 mAbs were also included as controls. SARS-CoV antibodies 442 (S230 and m396) previously isolated by others 42 were synthesized and binding kinetics, epitope mapping, and competition with 449 receptor ACE2 measured by SPR. The binding kinetics and affinity of mAbs 450 to SARS-CoV-2 RBD were analyzed by SPR (Biacore T200, GE Healthcare). 451 Specifically, purified RBDs were covalently immobilized to a CM5 sensor chip 452 via amine groups in 10mM sodium acetate buffer (pH 5.0) for a final RU around 453 250. SPR assays were run at a flow rate of 30ml/min in HEPES buffer. The 454 sensograms were fit in a 1:1 binding model with BIA Evaluation software (GE 455 Healthcare). For epitope mapping, two different antibodies were sequentially 456 injected and monitored for binding activity to determine whether the two mAbs 457 recognized separate or closely-situated epitopes. To determine competition 458 with the human ACE2 peptidase domain, SARS-CoV-2 RBD was immobilized 459 to a CM5 sensor chip via amine group for a final RU around 250. Antibodies (1 460 \u03bcM) were injected onto the chip until binding steady-state was reached. ACE2 461 (2 \u03bcM), which was produced and purified as above, was then injected for 60 462 seconds. Blocking efficacy was determined by comparison of response units 463 with and without prior antibody incubation. 464 Analysis of plasma and antibody binding to cell surface expressed 465 trimeric Spike protein. HEK 293T cells were transfected with expression 466 plasmid encoding the full length spike of SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV or MERS-467 CoV and incubated at 37 \u00b0C for 36 h. The cells were digested with trypsin and 468 distributed into 96 well plates for the individual staining. Cells were washed 469 twice with 200\u00b5l staining buffer (PBS with 2% heated-inactivated FBS) between 470 each following steps. The cells were stained at room temperature for 30 471 minutes in 100 \u03bcl staining buffer with 1:100 dilutions of plasma or 20 \u03bcg/ml 472 monoclonal antibodies. The cells were then stained with PE labeled anti-human 473 IgG Fc secondary antibody (Biolegend) at a 1:20 dilution in 50 \u03bcl staining buffer 474 at room temperature for 30 minutes. Finally, the cells were re-suspended and 475 16 analyzed with FACS Calibur instrument (BD Biosciences, USA) and FlowJo 10 476 software (FlowJo, USA). HEK 293T cells without transfection were also stained 477 as background control. S230 and m396 targeting the RBD of SARS-CoV spike 478 42 and Mab-GD33 targeting the RBD of MERS-CoV spike 43 were used as 479 positive primary antibody controls, while VRC01 targeting HIV-1 env 40 was 480 used as an irrelevant primary antibody control. 481 Neutralization activity of mAbs against pseudovirus and live SARS-CoV-2. 482 SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV pseudovirus were generated by co-483 transfection of human immunodeficiency virus backbones expressing firefly 484 luciferase (pNL43R-E-luciferase) and pcDNA3.1 (Invitrogen) expression 485 vectors encoding the respective S proteins into 293T cells (ATCC) 37,38,44,45 . 486 Viral supernatants were collected 48 h later. Viral titers were measured as 487 luciferase activity in relative light units (Bright-Glo Luciferase Assay Vector 488 System, Promega Biosciences). Control envelope glycoproteins derived from 489 human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-1 and their corresponding pseudoviruses 490 were produced in the same manner. Control mAbs included VRC01 against 491 HIV-1 40 ; S230 and m396 against SARS-CoV 42 ; and Merb-GD33 against 492 MERS-CoV 43 . Neutralization assays were performed by incubating 493 pseudoviruses with serial dilutions of purified mAbs at 37\u00b0C for 1h. Huh7 cells 494 (ATCC) (approximately 1.5 \u00d7 10 4 per well) were added in duplicate to the virus-495 antibody mixture. Half-maximal inhibitory concentrations (IC 50 ) of the evaluated 496 mAbs were determined by luciferase activity 48h after exposure to virus-497 antibody mixture using GraphPad Prism 6 (GraphPad Software Inc.). 498 All experiments involving live SARS-CoV-2 followed approved Biosafety 499 Level 3 laboratory standard operating procedures. Neutralization assays 500 against live SARS-CoV-2 were conducted using a clinical isolate 501 (Beta/Shenzhen/SZTH-003/2020, EPI_ISL_406594 at GISAID) previously 502 obtained from a nasopharyngeal swab of P#3. The isolate was amplified in Vero 503 cell lines to make working stocks of the virus (1 \u00d7 10 5 PFU/ml). To analyze the 504 mAb neutralizing activities, Vero E6 cells were seeded at 10 4 /well in 96-well 505 culture plates and cultured at 37 \u00b0C to form a monolayer. Serial dilutions of 506 mAbs were mixed separately with 100 PFU of SARS-CoV-2, incubated at 37 \u00b0C 507 for 1 h, and added to the monolayer of Vero E6 cells in duplicates. Cells either 508 unexposed to the virus or mixed with 100 PFU SARS-CoV-2 were used as 509 negative (uninfected) and positive (infected) controls, respectively. Cytopathic 510 effects (CPE) were observed daily and recorded on Day 2 post-exposure. 511 Gene family usage and phylogenetic analysis of mAbs. The program 512 IMGT/V-QUEST (http://www.imgt.org/IMGT_vquest/vquest) was used to 513 analyze germline gene, germline divergence or degree of somatic 514 hypermutation (SHM), the framework region (FR) and the loop length of the 515 complementarity determining region 3 (CDR3) for each antibody clone. The IgG 516 heavy and light chain variable genes were aligned using Clustal W in the 517 BioEdit sequence analysis package (https://bioedit.software.informer.com/7.2/). 518 Phylogenetic analyses were performed by the Maximum Likelihood method 519 using MEGA X (Molecular Evolutionary Genetics Analysis across computing 520 platforms). Several forms of the phylogenetic trees are presented for clarity. 521 Antibody production. The production of antibodies was conducted as 522 previously described 38,46 . The genes encoding the heavy and light chains of 523 isolated antibodies were separately cloned into expression vectors containing 524 IgG1 constant regions and the vectors were transiently transfected into 525 HEK293T or 293F cells using polyethylenimine (PEI) (Sigma). After 72h, the 526 antibodies secreted into the supernatant were collected and captured by 527 protein A Sepharose (GE Healthcare). The bound antibodies were eluted and 528 further purified by gel-filtration chromatography using a Superdex 200 High 529 Performance column (GE Healthcare). The purified antibodies were either used 530 in binding and neutralizing assays.",
