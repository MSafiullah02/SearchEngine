This is a timely Comment, considering the 2009 influenza pandemic, regional experiences with Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus and plague, and ongoing Ebola outbreaks. We strongly endorse the observations made regarding the nature and magnitude of the problems identified and the proposed solution of using existing networks with established research infrastructure and proven capabilities.",

This work builds on the work of the Canadian Critical Care Trials Group and the Australia New Zealand Intensive Care Society Clinical Trials Group, who did observational research during the 2009 pandemic. Currently, using approved observational protocols for severe acute respiratory infection, we collect periodic data annually to determine baseline severity and to identify problems with the existing research infrastructure. Future steps will include expanding research tool development to other syndromes likely to cause future outbreaks, such as encephalitis, incorporating health system capacity for accurate population-level burden assessments, and ensuring that these varied research networks continue to intersect in meaningful ways.",
