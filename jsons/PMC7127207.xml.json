            "text": "Service industries have accounted for an increasing share of labour, output, and trade among the advanced economies of the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) over the last quarter century. This phenomenon of sustained growth in services (both in absolute and relative terms) can be observed at the national level among OECD member countries in terms of the changing composition of gross domestic product (GDP) and employment, but is especially pronounced at the urban or city-region scale. Final demand service industries (for example retail, education, and most government services) are strongly tied to large metropolitan consumer markets, while intermediate services are even more spatially centralized, reflecting the influence of urban and agglomeration economies on the locational pattern of specialized, contact-intensive services. Following the protracted decline of traditional manufacturing, service industries have led employment growth among most advanced city-regions over the last three decades.",

At the broadest theoretical level we can discern intimate associations between service industries and redefining urban socio-economic processes and stylistic innovation over the past century. The growth of high-rise office complexes was an integral feature of the production of modernist urban landscapes, while advanced service industries have been central to the experiences of post-industrialism, flexible specialization, and post-modernism which have transformed urban landscapes, production sectors, and occupational structures over the past several decades. More particularly, service industries are directly involved in fundamental shifts in the urban economic base and industrial structure, but are also deeply implicated in the reconfiguration of regional structure, the metropolitan space-economy, and urban form. The rapid growth of service occupations among the most advanced post-industrial cities has also had profound implications for urban class structure and for the metropolitan social morphology, and is associated with the evolution of urban culture and even political preferences.",

At the apex of the global city hierarchy the most privileged status is associated with high concentrations of specialized banking and finance, and the projection of corporate power, as well as encompassing a more diversified ensemble of specialized service industries.",

The purpose of this paper is to propose a framework for investigating the influence of service industries on urban development within the Asia-Pacific, with an emphasis on dimensions of transformational change, both within the metropolis, and at the broader urban systems level. This entails an assessment of economic implications of tertiarization for cities and city-regions within the Asia-Pacific, including the emergence of new urban functions or vocations, and constituent shifts in the urban economic base, employment structure, and mix of industries. Advanced or specialized services\u2014especially, banking and finance, business and trade services, professional and \u2018informational\u2019 service activities, among others\u2014are increasingly associated with modernization aspirations among the region's post-industrial, late-industrial and transitional societies, as reflected in development strategies and programmes. However, the parameters of urban change within the Asia-Pacific associated with tertiarization extend beyond this economic dimension to encompass impacts of service industry growth on urban structure and form, the built environment, social class and social morphology: i.e. the comprehensive facets of transformation (and re-imaging) of cities increasingly engaged in advanced services production, exchange, trade and consumption.",

Accordingly, the analytical focus will be on service industries and activities which the research literature has identified as \u2018propulsive\u2019 in urban growth and development; i.e. intermediate (rather than final demand) services, specialized service industries, and knowledge- and technology-based or informational services. At the same time, the record of urban services growth within the Asia-Pacific region discloses wide variations in stages of services development and mixes of service activity from place to place, and this variegation must be acknowledged in the interests of presenting a more rounded perspective on the experience than an exclusive discussion of leading edge examples would allow. Indeed, some of the most interesting and instructive stories of urban tertiarization within the Asia-Pacific concern the juxtaposition of informal and advanced services in transitional societies, with ensuing social, land use, and planning conflicts.",

Defining elements of advanced urban tertiarization are identified, and are constituted within a taxonomy of global cities' service functions. The following section (Chapter 3) addresses both commonalities and contrasts in service industry developments among city-regions of the Atlantic and Pacific cores, and identifies five principal implications of service growth for urban change within the Asia-Pacific. These include the role of service industries in reshaping urban development trajectories, in the reconfiguration of urban space, and in urban social and cultural change, as well as the ramifications of accelerated tertiarization for the everyday experiences of city life and for urban identity and image.",

The spatial development of specialized services production within the Asia-Pacific is described, including both polarized patterns and more extended territories of tertiary sector growth, observed in the form of incipient urban corridors. These corridors (or clusters) represent a functionally specialized form of territorial development which exhibit features of co-operation as well as competition, and in part express policy responses to the pressures of globalization.",

The first (Chapter 5) describes the basic evolution of local policy responses to urban tertiarization over the last quarter-century, from early development control policy regimes imposed to manage negative externalities of rapid service industry growth, to more balanced approaches, which combined developmental as well as regulatory elements. This chapter concludes with a set of important processes and events which have shaped a new policy environment for urban service industries in the early 21st century. Next, Chapter 6 extends this discussion, by introducing a framework of six strategic urban policy models which are deployed in cities within the Asia-Pacific, including experiments in progressive planning (co-operative regional development, sustainable city-regions), as well as familiar models associated with globalization and restructuring objectives. The paper concludes with suggestions for a research agenda, emphasizing developmental and transformational implications of service industry growth for city-regions within the Asia-Pacific.",

The inexhaustible differentiation of regional histories, political traditions and structures of governance, culture and geographical and environmental factors are seen to underpin the persistence of variegation and exceptionalism among regions and localities within both the old and new cores. The confluence of exogenous forces, including the rise of MNEs, and increasing market integration and technological diffusion, has imposed some measure of developmental convergence and commonality across international space (as well as increasing disparities within urban social structures), but there are after all limits to the homogenizing effects of globalization, as the recent scholarly development literature attests. Without denying the impressive global sweep of MNEs and speculative capital, it is essential to acknowledge the significance of (largely) localized development influences, such as site and environment, the structures of social networks and civic institutions, and the quality of public policy and regulation.",

            "text": "In an insightful book aimed at \u2018reasserting the power of the local\u2019, a number of scholars enrich the discourse on globalization by an elucidation of factors which reaffirm the power of local identity, and which provide some friction to the movement of capital and firms. Storper, notably, asserts the significance of \u2018territorialization\u2019 in embedding some specialized forms of economic activity within specific locations, beyond the more generic considerations of urban agglomeration which can bind (especially contact-intensive) firms to central places, such as higher-order service enterprises which cluster within the corporate complex of the central business district (CBD). In this interpretation, a firm or activity is \u201cfully territorialized when its economic viability is rooted in assets (including practices and relations) that are not available in many other places and that cannot be easily or rapidly created in places that lack them\u201d (Storper, 1997: 21). This concept of territorialization can also incorporate the quality of civic institutions and civil society as influences on economic development and socio-economic welfare, as disclosed in Putnam's seminal study of regional and community development in Italy (Putnam et al., 1993). Other important factors of locality that can influence differentiation in patterns of economic growth and development are exemplified by amenity attributes, which may include access to education and learning opportunities, and community levels of tolerance and equity, as well as air and water quality, leisure, and recreational opportunities. Thus, the forces of globalization, as powerful and pervasive as they demonstrably are, may be significantly tempered, mitigated, or renegotiated at regional and local levels.",

This crisis, which delivered a major check to the continued growth and progress of many of the leading economies of the region, presents a complex set of economic, socio-cultural and political issues and underlying causes that vary widely from place to place, but certainly includes important structural factors (relating to governance, policy, regulation, and financial supervision), as well as more transitory or cyclical attributes (McLeod and Garnaut, 1998). An apparent recovery process can be discerned in some of the Asia-Pacific economies, but the experience is likely to be protracted and wrenching for many, as the (now decade-long) recession in Japan seems to attest. Sustained recovery (and, more pointedly, a shift from growth to development) will require major adjustments to the political structures of Asia-Pacific states, as well as to the governance of corporations and industrial enterprises, and to the supervision and regulation of banks and financial institutions. Both the depth and breadth of this economic downturn (and attendant social and political upheavals), and the quarter century or so of recurrent high growth levels that preceded it, raise questions concerning the contrasting trajectories of development within the mature Atlantic economies and those of the new core of the Pacific Basin, as well as the factors underlying these patterns of differentiation.4\n",

Beyond the obvious reality that the leading states of both the Pacific and Atlantic spheres contain advanced industrial production sectors, and are experiencing growth in tertiary activity, it is important to acknowledge that while the growth of services represents a dominant motif of the economic and social reconstruction of western economies and societies, the accelerated growth of manufacturing industry and employment has been the principal story in the rise of the Asia-Pacific economies over the past four decades. Among the mature economies of the OECD, concentrated within the old Atlantic core, this same period has seen a massive contraction of production capacity and labour in basic industries, especially in Fordist mass-production manufacturing, manifested most dramatically by wrenching processes of industrial decline (consisting mostly of outright factory closures but also some measure of locational decentralization) within long-established inner-city industrial precincts of large- and medium-size cities, and consequent losses of employment, income and revenue (Noyelle and Stanback, 1984). New industries characterized by flexible specialization processes and technology-intensive outputs have emerged in \u2018lead regions\u2019 and \u2018new production spaces\u2019 (Scott, 1988) within the Atlantic core, so aggregate manufacturing output has held up or even increased (by value) in some areas (Coffey, 1996), but in general manufacturing activity has lost ground in relative terms in most OECD regions.",

At the same time, the post-war period has seen among the most advanced societies the sustained expansion of service industries which (with related shifts in industrial production processes) have profoundly changed the economic base, industrial mix, labour force, land use and physical form of city-regions within the Atlantic zone. Service sector growth has thus constituted a central feature of economic restructuring among advanced nations and regions, with service-type occupations leading employment formation not only in the tertiary and quaternary (or informational) sectors, but also in manufacturing, where the growth of management, clerical, sales and technical workers has exceeded that for direct production workers and operatives in most cases.5\n",

There is of course considerable variation in the temporal sequencing, specific industry emphasis, scale and stage of manufacturing growth among individual nations (and even among regions and sub-regions), but accelerated industrialization, supported in most cases by state policies and programmes, has been central to the expansion of every high growth Asian-Pacific state (Douglass, 1994), including (1) the Japanese ascendancy, seen in the industrial development of the Japanese archipelago (especially within the principal conurbations of Honshu but also including urban centres in Kyushu and Hokkaido) over much of the present century, with accelerated development of production in industrial and consumer goods from the 1950s, including the expansion of global-scale industrial conglomerates and MNCs; (2) the origins of takeoff growth among the Newly Industrializing Countries (NICs), with accelerated industrialization initiated in Taiwan and Hong Kong in the 1950s, and Singapore and South Korea about a decade later (McGee and Lin, 1993); (3) the later emergence of the \u2018threshold\u2019 or \u2018near\u2019 NICs, notably Malaysia and Thailand, which retain important bases of agriculture and staple production outside the principal metropolitan zones, but which have experienced substantial manufacturing growth over the past two decades; (4) the tumultuous growth and transformation of China, dating from the ideologically impelled industrialization programme enunciated in the series of 5-year economic plans commencing in the period 1953\u201357, to the industrial stimulus generated by the economic liberalization policies launched in 1978, and then to the more recent expansion of advanced manufacturing in the Lower Yangtze, Pearl River Delta, and certain other coastal regions; (5) the larger role played by industrial development in the transition of other populous agrarian nations, notably Indonesia and the Philippines; and (6) the current economic restructuring programme in Vietnam, associated with the \u2018doi moi\u2019 policy of economic and social renovation. In addition to these important examples, industrialization also represents a goal (or ideal) of lagging states within the region, such as Laos, Burma and North Korea, although the realization of these industrial aspirations has been seriously impeded by a prejudicial m\u00e9lange of factors including war, flawed development models, governmental corruption and administrative incompetence, lack of capital and other resources, and isolation.",

At the end of the 20th century, then, industrialization represented the dominant trajectory for many states and regions within the Asia-Pacific, constituted a significant aspect of growth (together with specialized services) in some of the more advanced economies of the Pacific realm, and remained an aspiration of less-developed, agrarian and staple-dominated countries in the region. These industrialization trajectories will continue to be highly influential in the development of Asia-Pacific city-regions in the new century, but it is equally clear that service industries will emerge as increasingly significant features of urban growth and change, a theme we will explore in the following chapters.",

At the vanguard of growth and change there are also an expanding number of firms in the computer software and knowledge industry groups that are so crucial to the progress of advanced, information-based economies. In general, however, this intermediate services subsector (comprised mainly of small- and medium-size firms) is somewhat less well-developed in Asia than is the case among the leading regional and national economies of Europe and North America, where the producer services are seen as essential to the efficient operation of flexible production regimes, and have constituted the most dynamic elements of these economies and labour forces over the past two decades. This disparity is reflected in the large balance of trade deficits in specialized services incurred by most Pacific Asian nations (Daniels and O'Connor, 2000).",

However, there are also important structural factors as well. These include, notably, contrasts in the regulatory conditions and legal and contractual regimes between countries, which impose different kinds and levels of requirements upon firms domiciled within these jurisdictions. Within many of the Western societies these regulatory and legal regimes have become exceedingly complex and demanding, giving rise to specialized intermediate service firms which provide expert advice to corporations on a subcontracting basis, as the demand arises. Within the Asian realm, as we have already noted, many of these specialized service inputs are generated either internally within the corporation, as is the case with some of the larger Korean and Japanese conglomerates; or, as is the practice in many firms in China and Southeast Asia, are supplied by a network of advisors defined by kinship and social relations. Moreover, there has been a substantial (if spatially and temporally uneven) growth of producer services within the Asia-Pacific, reflecting \u201cthe wide socio-cultural heterogeneity in this region and the distance between trade centres\u201d (Ho, 1998: 179).",

There is also a tendency toward greater levels of specialization in services production among larger cities, although there are to be sure some notable exceptions to this. This correlation between tertiarization levels, growth rates and degrees of specialization is of course most easily observed among the region's major corporate centres, such as Tokyo, Hong Kong, and Singapore, but the familiar spatial manifestations of service industry growth (CBDs, corporate complexes, commercial strips and nodes, and the like) are features of a growing roster of Asia-Pacific city-regions, although their specific form may be locally distinctive.

As in other facets of urban development, it is essential to achieve an appreciation of signifying contrasts in urbanization experiences in the Asia-Pacific, as distinct from the patterns of urban development within the Atlantic core (Lin, 1994). These contrasts include the following:1.Generally higher growth rates of service industries and employment among Asia-Pacific nations and city-regions over the past decade and a half, reflecting more incipient stages of tertiarization in many Asian jurisdictions and, broadly, more buoyant economic conditions over the past two decades or so. By way of contrast, service growth in Europe has been (as Daniels notes) slow or even stagnant (Daniels, 1993). (It must, however, be acknowledged that the depressed condition of certain Asian currencies and financial markets are diminishing growth expectations in financial and service sectors among certain business centres over the short- to medium-term, and ensuing political instability and social unrest will almost inevitably exacerbate those impacts. Moreover, urban service sector growth rates will inevitably slow among advanced cities with high existing levels of services labour, including Singapore, Hong Kong, and Japanese cities).2.Highly differentiated trajectories of tertiarization and economic restructuring among Asia-Pacific city-regions, which represent in many cases significant departures from the more linear patterns of service industry growth common to the old Atlantic-centred core. These contrasting tertiarization trends and processes are in part a consequence of the widely varying stages of overall development among specific national and regional jurisdictions, but are also associated with important (and in some cases decisive) policy factors and local development strategies.3.The diversity of services-production linkage patterns among Asia-Pacific economies, which to some extent may follow the services externalization and subcontracting processes widely documented among European and North American firms, but are also exemplified in other respects by the distinctive nature of industrial organization in \u2018lead\u2019 Asian economies in which large integrated corporations (keiretsu in Japan, the chaebol in South Korea) maintain internalized service supply; by the intricate entrepreneurial networks based on kinship relationships in parts of East and Southeast Asia (Hsing, 1995); and by the intimate spatial linkages between industrial production and service providers observed in exurban or countryside production regimes in certain regions of China (Marton, 1996).4.Variation in the reconfiguration of metropolitan space-economies to accommodate the introduction of new, specialized service industry nodes and clusters, which follow to some extent the locational tendencies of services in advanced economies and city-regions; while at the same time exhibiting persistent spatial patterns derived from more traditional systems of urban and regional economic development, as exemplified in the desakota areas of Southeast Asia and Japan, and, at a smaller scale, the intimate juxtaposition of advanced and informal service activities in central areas of developing societies (Leaf, 1996). In the most advanced cases, new spatial patterns of specialized services production include clusters of design, creative services, and advanced-technology service industries within reconstructed inner city precincts.5.Distinctive divisions of labour within urban service industries, which may appear to mimic the Western model at the apex of the occupational hierarchy (i.e., the growth of managers, professionals, knowledge-based and advanced-technology workers), but also display substantial variation, derived in large part from localized culture, class structures and traditions, the pre-existing base of service workers, and region-based entrepreneurial or mercantile cultures.\n",

Here, the growth of (especially advanced) service industries and related occupational cohorts generates an increasingly tertiarized labour force, which Daniel Bell described as a pre-condition for the emergence of a post-industrial society, over a quarter century ago (Bell, 1973): a contested idea, to be sure (Gershuny, 1978), but a seminal and prescient contribution in many ways. Within the highly tertiarized city, the growth of specialized services leads to significant socio-spatial effects, including the familiar pattern of social upgrading within inner city neighbourhoods, and the formation of new suburban communities comprised largely of service workers, but also the recent emergence of a \u2018new middle class\u2019 of higher-echelon service labour (Ley, 1996). The rise of this new middle class of elite service workers (professionals, executives and managers, entrepreneurs and creative services occupations) as a presence in the inner city, a larger process than earlier, more incremental experiences of gentrification, comprises individuals who view the metropolitan core as a place to work, live, and recreate, leading to the transformation of the central city with respect to structure, land use, form, and lifestyles. There are also broader cultural connotations associated with the new middle class, as seen in shifts in tastes, values, behaviours, and even political affiliation. This new middle class enjoys a hegemonic status within the most highly tertiarized cities in the region, such as Vancouver, Seattle, San Francisco, and Sydney, and comprises the ascendant social cohort within Singapore, Tokyo, and Hong Kong, but is also observed as a growing presence (with some local variation in specific features) within the central districts of Seoul, Shanghai, Guangzhou, and Kuala Lumpur, among other cities.",

Although much of the scholarly analysis of tertiarization has emphasized change within the three strategic categories described earlier, a more nuanced appreciation of the more intensely localized implications of growth in services is essential to attaining an appropriately rounded profile of the process. These include, for the purposes of illustration, the impact of service industries and the growth of service occupations on the quality of working life, and on localized displacement and dislocation at the neighbourhood and household levels (Chua, 1989, Chua, 1991), especially within a context of industrial decline or restructuring. There is considerable potential for research on the important gender aspects of tertiarization, which may include the tendency for over-representation of females within many service occupations and industries. Within the highly tertiarized societies of the old Atlantic core, the past several decades have seen both the impressive progress of women within some of the credentialized service occupations, for example in law, accountancy, and planning, but also a more discouraging tendency for women to congregate in more menial, poorly paid and distinctly marginalized positions.",

Lin observes that characteristics of mobility, flexibility and entrepreneurial skills are defining attributes of Hong Kong migrants (Lin, 2000: 13), enhancing their attractiveness to receiving urban societies and business communities. In certain cities, recent immigrants are over-represented both within entrepreneurial and management occupations, but also among more menial service occupations; this is especially the case in large global cities (Sassen, 1991). Again, as in other facets of tertiarization, we can discern within Asian labour markets some powerful resonances of trends initially observed in mature cities of the Atlantic core, but there are also quite distinctive, persistent traditional socio-cultural contexts to consider.",

In many Asian cities, these smaller scale service operations may be viewed as an extension of the traditional population of informal service workers (itself a contested term), service activities which occupy the urban interstices between the more formal corporate business and retail structures. These can be seen as persistent features of the central city, not only among the mega-cities of Southeast Asia, such as Bangkok and Jakarta, but also within the downtown spaces of modern world cities such as Tokyo. They are not simply residual activities, but essential, if often undervalued, operations that support the more formal service economy in 100 different ways within the metropolitan core, including the provision of food and beverages (Yasmeen, 1992). These small-scale, low-return service firms survive by virtue of entrepreneurship, reliability, thrift, and knowledge of where the commercial niches exist in the modern city, and they contribute to the vitality and identity of the urban place.",

The perceived image of a city can be substantially altered by comprehensive processes of tertiarization, as seen in the repositioning of Singapore and Hong Kong as post-industrial, specialized service centres, although usage of decidedly obsolete nomenclature such as \u2018newly industrializing economies\u2019 is surprisingly persistent, as are outdated tropes like \u2018little dragons\u2019 or \u2018little tigers\u2019 (Cartier, 1999).12\nIn some cases national governments have supported specialized service industry projects as quite deliberate instruments of urban re-imaging, as seen in the creation of international banking and producer services in the Pudong development in Shanghai, and in the construction of the Petronas Towers in the central area of Kuala Lumpur. These initiatives are designed in part to underscore a commitment to modernity, and by extension to symbolize national economic progress and aspirations to global status and engagement, but also to supplant traditional (or, more pejoratively, \u2018backward\u2019) industries and related social groups.

            "text": "The issue of urban identity may also be deeply problematic, as the rapid growth of services elites within Asian-Pacific cities can presage decisive shifts in power relations (political as well as economic) within the urban community. In some cases the ascendancy of upper-tier service workers represents a new socio-economic and socio-political hegemony, implying a coincident subordination of traditional industrial-sector cohorts, as well as an exacerbation of income disparities. As in other aspects of urban tertiarization within the Asia-Pacific, contrasts in scale and stages of development are significant, as are tendencies toward exceptionalism when case studies are subjected to closer analysis. Thus, Baum concluded that the sustained growth of specialized service industries, advanced-technology activities and related occupations in Singapore, coupled with comprehensive public housing programmes and education investments, has resulted in a predominantly professionalized (as opposed to polarized) occupational and social structure within the city-state (Baum, 1999). In Hong Kong, where specialized services have also driven urban growth and socio-economic change (Kwok, 1996), the post-colonial record since 1997 includes growing poverty (about 600 000 residents earn less than $600 per month), attributable in some part to the inadequacies of the secondary school system, a situation which one legislator fears may lead to \u2018serious social instability\u2019 (Lee Cheuk-yan, quoted in Far Eastern Economic Review: 26 October 2000). At a larger scale, a combination of market liberalization and selective tertiarization in certain Chinese cities, with attendant political and bureaucratic corruption, has generated income polarization rates approaching or even exceeding the American level. This striving for new urban identities in the Chinese case, with its repressed tensions and conflicts, can be seen in the Shanghai government's preference for \u2018high class\u2019 individuals (well-educated, with the right attitudes, outlooks and professional profiles) for the glittering new towers of the Pudong project (Halliday, 1995), a far cry indeed from the earlier Communist exaltation of the urban industrial worker and fraternal colleagues in the PLA and in rural peasant communes.",

In the case of Singapore, the last decade has seen the demise of the Kampung Kopi-tiam (informal eating places, serving authentic local fare) as a result of relentless modernization (Chua, 1995), and the almost total disappearance of traditional rural life, while other local retail and shopping districts have been subject to the reformation of identity associated with the tastes and behavioural preferences of affluent expatriate populations.

Many of these firms have been concentrated within \u201cnew service production landscapes\u201d within or proximate to the central area, exemplified by \u2018Silicon Alley\u2019 and Telok Ayer in Singapore, Yaletown in Vancouver, Belltown in Seattle, and the northeast Mission and South Park districts of San Francisco (Hutton, 2000).

These massive city-regions contain to be sure huge concentrations of manufacturing, and, indeed, exhibit greater industrial strength than many of the first order global cities of the Atlantic realm, such as London, Paris, and New York. Both Tokyo and Los Angeles have important, global scale advanced-technology industrial sectors, situated within their metropolitan and immediately proximate territories, including Orange County (in the case of Los Angeles) (Scott, 1988), and the new production spaces of the Tokyo Metropolitan Region (TMR) (Fujita and Hill, 1996). However, while both Tokyo and Los Angeles retain an impressive base of modern manufacturing capacity, their most insistent claim to global city status rests on their downtown complexes of international banking and finance, and headquarters of MNCs, supported by highly specialized producer services and superior international communications systems and transportation networks. Los Angeles and Tokyo are also global centres of cultural production and dissemination, media concentration, and applied design and creative industries. They contain major universities of high international standing, including UCLA and USC (Los Angeles), and Tokyo University and Waseda within the Japanese capital. Of these two Pacific regional first-tier global cities, Tokyo has conventionally been ranked as the leading centre, in view of its base of multinational head offices, and more particularly, its concentration of major banks, securities firms and trading companies, but this status may need to be reconsidered in light of the fall-out from the 1997 crisis (and, indeed, the failure to effectively address structural and institutional problems in the national banking and financial sector over the last decade). Tokyo has considerable underlying industrial and overall economic power, but there is certainly the prospect of serious erosion in its financial sector over the medium-term at least, which may jeopardize its position within the triumvirate of highest-order world centres (which also includes London and New York).13\n",

For example, both Singapore and Hong Kong specialize in advanced service industries, including finance and banking, producer and other high order services, tourism and convention activities, and higher education. Each is now a major exporter of services; Hong Kong is ranked as the 10th leading exporter of services globally (Hang Seng Bank, 1996). Manufacturing has declined from 29.5% of Hong Kong's employment in 1989, to only 12.2% in 1998, a level comparable to that of the most highly tertiarized Atlantic core societies (Asian Development Bank, 2002). Upper-tier service industry professionals, managers and entrepreneurs constitute the dominant social class in Hong Kong (Kwok, 1999). However, Hong Kong's emergence as a centre of specialized service production and trade has been impelled principally by an exceedingly liberal regulatory regime, while Singapore's restructuring trajectory has been enhanced by a more direct application of policy measures. Following a brief but sharp recession in 1985, the Singapore government resolved to transform the city-state from a branch-plant industrial enclave to a regional (and world) centre of tertiary production and trade, with the aim of becoming the \u2018Switzerland of Asia\u2019 by 2000. This overarching economic development and transformation goal has been to a large extent realized, and Singapore now represents a policy experience that other nations (notably China) are endeavouring to emulate.",

A sequence of policy and (especially) physical planning measures were deployed to promote economic transition and transformation, including the industrial new town programme of the 1960s, the expansion of the Hong Kong CBD eastward toward Wanchai and Causeway Bay in the 1980s, and the recent investments in transportation infrastructure, as in the linking of Hong Kong with Guangzhou by expressway, and the construction of the international airport at Chek Lap Kok. There have also been substantial new public investments in tertiary education, training and housing, underscoring a substantial government commitment to upgrading the quality of Hong Kong's human resources and social capital. These investments and land use policy initiatives suggest that contrasts between Singapore's and Hong Kong's approaches to economic transformation which insist on sharply dichotomous contrasts may be somewhat overstated, although the extent (and sustained commitment) of direct policy intervention in the Singapore case is in many respects singular.14\n",

In general, the central government has been concerned both with the need to maintain a leading edge position in industrial production within the Asia-Pacific, while preparing the large cities for more advanced roles in specialized services industries, both for the domestic economy, and for trade purposes. Much of the research on economic restructuring in Japan has emphasized \u2018hard services,\u2019 notably technology, and its role in transforming both industrial production modes and urban economic structures (Glasmeier, 1988), while another major body of scholarship deals with the transformation of Tokyo, Japan's first-order \u2018world city\u2019 (Masai, 1989). Important themes concerned with Tokyo's transformation include tensions and conflicts between the capital's international roles and local functions (Fujita, 1992), and the problems of accommodating (or, prospectively, relocating) central government functions from Tokyo's metropolitan core (Isomura, 1990). However, there has also been some important work focusing on the restructuring (and, more specifically, tertiarization) of other principal Japanese city-regions. These experiences include the economic restructuring of Tokyo (Machimura, 1992), the expansion of advanced services such as finance, information services, and education in the major industrial city of Nagoya over the last two decades (Hayashi, 1992), and the new emphasis on advanced knowledge-based service industries for the transition of Yokohama from gateway port (and \u2018shadow city\u2019 for Tokyo), to a more independent role as international business centre (Edgington, 1991).",

Following the industrialization policies and programmes of the period over the 1950s, 1960s, and 1970s (including the ruinous \u2018Great Leap Forward\u2019), Chinese cities \u201cwere endowed with a massive and diffuse manufacturing capacity, and provided with few incentives (until the last decade) to develop the services sector\u201d (Hamer, 1995: 11). The economic policy reforms of 1978 (and more specifically) the mid-1980s embodied a recognition that modernization would require the more efficient deployment of cities and their resources, and thus heavy manufacturing was increasingly decentralized to outlying areas, and services (especially financial and producer services) were encouraged, both by economic planners in Beijing, and by local authorities. In order to achieve growth in advanced production and transition to a more knowledge-based economy, Hamer estimates that \u201cup to 40% of the local labour force will have to be employed in the producer services sector\u201d (Hamer, 1995: 11), a proportion that seems high even by the standard of more advanced OECD cities, but is perhaps nonetheless indicative of municipal aspirations. Lin also underscores the crucial role of cities in the modernization of the Chinese economy as represented by their concentrations of advanced service industries and occupations which enable higher levels of creativity, efficiency, and internationalization (Lin, 1998:111\u2013112).",

In this respect, Shanghai has certainly attracted an impressive quantity of investment in banking and commercial (and supporting public) infrastructure, as well as a growing number of MNCs and MNEs, but has not yet achieved the high concentrations of domestic and expatiate professional expertise in specialized services that is a defining hallmark of highest-order global cities.

Here, Hong Kong is likely to hold a competitive advantage over other Chinese cities over the short to medium-term by virtue of the territorialization (Storper, 1997) of this expertise and specialized human capital. The two fundamental shifts in Shanghai's development trajectory over the past several decades can be interpreted empirically. In 1952, the \u2018tertiary sector\u2019 (i.e. commerce, finance, communications, science and technology, education and culture) constituted 42.3% of Shanghai's regional GDP. Following 20 years of investment in manufacturing capacity and employment, this proportion was reduced to only 17.3% by 1972. The intensive promotion of advanced service industries during the 1980s resulted in an increase in the tertiary sector's share of GDP to 30% by 1990, while Shanghai's economic development strategy called for an increase in this proportion to about 60% by 2000 (Fung et al., 1992), led by the advanced services complex in the Pudong redevelopment mega-project. (Shanghai's service sector grew by 12% in 1992, and by 15% in 1993; Chreod Ltd, 1996) Overall, Shanghai's experience of accelerated industrialization and subsequent re-tertiarization must represent one of the most dramatic episodes of economic restructuring among large metropolitan cities in the post-war period.",

As in other large Chinese cities, economic policy priorities following 1949 entailed the transformation of Guangzhou from a \u2018consumer city\u2019 to a \u2018producer city\u2019. This strategy of large-scale industrialization was perhaps less fully realized than in the case of Shanghai, because of the persistence of entrepreneurial traditions in the province, and Guangzhou's distance from the national capital, which enabled at least a degree of autonomy. Building on its well-established gateway and entrep\u00f4t functions, Guangzhou was strategically positioned to immediately benefit from the opening up of Chinese coastal cities. In the period 1978\u20131992, growth in services exceeded that for agriculture or manufacturing, with lead tertiary sector industry groups including finance and corporate support services (Nanjiang, 1996). Guangzhou is the urban centre for the Pearl River Delta economic region, which represents (with the lower Yangtze region and southern Fujian) major growth regions and access points for China to the broader Asia-Pacific and global markets (Johnson, 1996). The issue of whether Guangzhou can extend its regional role more fully into the national realm remains an open question (Tsang, 1995), as are the \u2018terms of co-existence\u2019 with Hong Kong following the latter's post-colonial status as a Special Administrative Region of the PRC as of July 1997. There is to be sure potential for complementarity as well as competition as characteristics of the relationship between Guangzhou and Hong Kong within the Pearl Delta extended urban cluster, a theme to be addressed in more detail below, but over time Guangzhou will aspire to greater shares of the region's international financial and business activity.",

This fourth category of Asia-Pacific cities includes two sub-groups: first, advanced, highly tertiarized cities with substantial manufacturing capacity and associated labour cohorts, and propulsive corporations, notably Seattle, Melbourne, and Yokohama; and a larger contingent of specialized services cities with relatively modest industrial production sectors, including Vancouver, Portland, Fukuoka, and Brisbane. In many respect these jurisdictions embody features of service industry development observed within the mature urban and regional economies of the old Atlantic core, which typically include (a) a dominant status for services within the metropolitan industrial mix, export base, and occupational structure; (b) the formation of corporate complexes within the CBD; (c) the emergence of new, creative services (culture, applied design, multimedia) on the CBD fringe and inner city; (d) the influence of suburban business centres and \u2018edge cities\u2019 in regional multinucleation; (e) intersections between services growth and changes in urban housing markets; and (f) the increasing role of services in the reformation of urban identity, politics, and lifestyles (Ley and Hutton, 1991). At the same time, many of the city-regions within Pacific America and Australasia also exhibit tendencies common to other Asia-Pacific metropolitan areas, such as (relative) economic dynamism and higher growth rates in services, and are also linked to Asia-Pacific cities, markets and societies by increasingly diverse networks of trade, investment, immigration and travel. As a crucial intersection of two principal processes of urban development, large-scale immigration, especially from Asian societies, has in important respects augmented urban tertiarization processes, reinforcing entrepreneurial, professional and management occupations, and contributing to export services trade by enhancing the connectivity between trading centres. We can therefore position these cities as geographically peripheral, but functionally integral, nodes of the Asia-Pacific urban system and as important examples of a distinctive stage of urban tertiarization within the Pacific realm.",

The emergence of relatively small service sector occupational elites within mega-urban city-regions such as Jakarta, and Manila must be set against a vastly larger informal sector of hawkers, vendors, and peddlers, which McGee described as the urban \u2018proto-proleteriat\u2019 (McGee, 1976). Even in second-tier cities, such as Bandung, economic restructuring incorporating both industrial development and tertiarization has promoted a deeply polarized social structure (Pribadi and Sofha, 1993). The imposition of advanced, high order services within the central and inner-city areas of Southeast Asian mega-cities has produced a distinctive juxtaposition of socio-economic classes, typified in part by the persistence of shanty towns, squatter settlements and informal sector activities proximate to high-rise office towers, high-end shops and boutiques, and other accoutrements of the later 20th-century corporate complex (Leaf, 1993). As Leaf observes, the explanation for this notionally incongruous pattern of traditional social morphology and modern capitalist development features \u201clies in the segmentation of urban land markets\u2026Which is now most commonly expressed in terms of formal and informal sectors\u2026derived from early patterns of land use not governed by market principles\u201d (Leaf, 1996: 5). In the case of Jakarta, in which about three quarters of the population live in informal settlements (Kampung), social class differentiation is expressed \u201cnot so much by zone or neighbourhood, such as what one would expect in the capitalist city, but at a more minute scale, between streetside and inner block locations within the same neighbourhood\u201d (Leaf, 1996: 5) underscoring the complex (and often deeply problematic) impact of economic restructuring on urban social structure within developing societies. The continuing economic crisis within Southeast Asian economies has no doubt impacted the poor disproportionately, but has also damaged the small service elite of professionals, financial and business services workers within the region's primate cities. In addition to the direct effects of this crisis on the employment and incomes of the service elite themselves, it seems likely that wider ramifications may include the diminution of the advanced services production capacity of these developing economies, as well as an erosion of the (already small) middle and upper-middle classes within their respective societies.15\n",

Culture, amenity and lifestyle may constitute supporting elements of intra-regional services development in some cases, notably in the transboundary Pacific North West corridor. Advanced services have been crucial to the post-staples development of the Pacific North West; at the same time, the amenity provided by wilderness areas is widely seen as a positive inducement to the specialized services and advanced-technology industries which increasingly define the economic base of this region, and is also embedded in social values and lifestyles.",

At the same time, there are to be sure examples of the \u2018uneasy co-existence\u2019 of national primate and second- and third-order cities within extended clusters, derived from hegemonic inter-city relations; the examples of Seoul and Pusan, and Tokyo and Osaka, come to mind. The dynamics of regional competition and complementarity can further be illustrated by reference to the Pacific North West Corridor, which includes the three major ports of Vancouver, Seattle, and Tacoma. There is to be sure considerable competition among the three ports (which is likely to increase as major shipping lines continue to rationalize their trans-Pacific rotations), but we can also observe aspects of specialization and complementarity: Seattle and Tacoma are major container ports, while Vancouver specializes in bulk commodity exports and cruise ship travel (The Port of Seattle has recently increased its efforts to attract cruise ship traffic, with at least a measure of success.). At a broader level, the reciprocal strengths of services specialization observed in Seattle, Vancouver and Portland enable the North West Corridor to compete in some trade sectors with the San Francisco Bay Area Cluster (for example in international gateway functions), about 1000 km to the south.",

Within certain of these corridors, for example the Yangtze Delta Cluster, and the Southern Malay Peninsula Corridor (incorporating Singapore and the Kuala Lumpur\u2013Putrajaya\u2013Cyberjaya technology corridor) this developmental aspiration is a matter of quite explicit political strategy (see for example the discussion in Corey, (2000)). In the Japanese case, the central government has attempted to promote complementary clusters or corridors of advanced-technology industries and services within three hierarchical levels, in order to maximize efficiency gains, and minimize damaging inter-regional competition (Edgington, 1994). There is a perceived need to transcend the everyday rivalries of regional competition, in order to promote powerful services, production and trade platforms, along the lines of mature counterparts within the old \u2018Atlantic core\u2019, such as the US northeastern \u2018Megalopolis\u2019 corridor, the Paris\u2013Ile de France region, and the London\u2013Oxford\u2013Cambridge triangle. A demonstration of the mutual benefits of inter-city complementarity and co-operation in this sphere may in turn facilitate broader efforts at inter-regional and international colloboration, as encouraged by Douglass (2000), among others. At the moment, cities within the region tend to see themselves as entities within essentially competitive international urban systems, with an obligation to devote more policy attention and public resources to fostering competitive advantage, at the expense of planning efforts designed to enhance local welfare (Thornley, 1999).",

Planning concerns during this period included the implications of rapid office development for the over-specialization of the urban economy, for the displacement of non-office industries and housing, and for long-distance commuting within the regional commuter shed. Indeed, the journey-to-work problem, shaped by the expansion of the CBD's office complex, and the simultaneous decentralization of the urban residential population and labour force, was broadly seen as a defining metropolitan planning issue in many city-regions (Davis and Hutton, 1981). The planning response to high levels of central city office development over the 1970s and 1980s included both increasingly stringent development control policies for the core (including downzoning, the imposition of annualized development quotas or thresholds, and fiscal measures), as well as efforts to promote new office subcentres within suburban areas.",

In Britain and in other parts of Western Europe, left-leaning councils actively discouraged service industries, which were seen as displacing traditional manufacturing industries. This essentially prejudicial local attitude toward service industries was in part conditioned by research which subordinated the tertiary sector to secondary manufacturing within the urban or regional economy, based on measures of export performance, productivity, and sales and employment multipliers. However, to some extent stringent local planning controls on (especially office-based) services were strongly influenced by political opposition to the speculative property market, which was seen to favour office development over industry and housing, reflecting higher returns on investment (ROI) for office development relative to other land use categories. Examples of this ideologically derived planning response to urban tertiarization included the Greater London Council and most inner city boroughs during the 1970s and early 1980s.",

Table 6 contrasts planning approaches toward service industries according to preferences for \u2018developmental\u2019 or \u2018growth management\u2019 policy objectives, although in practice many local authorities tended to implement a blended suite of promotional programmes and regulation (Daniels et al., 1991). However, important examples of quite dramatic policy shifts can be referenced, notably within cities of the broadly defined Asia-Pacific region. In the well-known case of Singapore, a short, sharp economic downturn in the mid-1980s led almost immediately to aggressive new policies favouring specialized, high-value, exportable services, in part reflecting concerns about the prospects for Singapore's manufacturing industry and regional entrep\u00f4t roles. In Hong Kong, the colonial government assertively supported the expansion of office activity and other key intermediate services, exemplified by the territorial expansion of the CBD, by public investments in education, and by increased international marketing (Taylor and Kwok, 1989). And in Vancouver, a centre-left City Council approved an economic development strategy which set out a series of policies and programmes to foster 10 important service sectors and industries, together with co-operative measures to be undertaken among key institutions, labour cohorts, and business groups (City of Vancouver, 1983). At the same time, the City of Vancouver continued to co-operate with the regional planning authority, the Greater Vancouver Regional District, in managing externalities of rapid growth in services, for example by supporting office development in designated regional town centres (RTCs), exemplifying the tendency to \u2018blend\u2019 both regulatory and developmental programmes within local policy suites.",

However, major changes in urban development conditions in the most recent period have led to a new phase of urban policy innovation, with policies for advanced services at the heart of much of this experimentation. These new policy conditions include the following processes, trends, and events:1.Continuing processes and pressures of globalization, stimulating local and regional policies promoting competitive advantage at the city-region level (as well as well-publicized protests and demonstrations), but also encouraging interest in the possibilities of co-operative programmes between cities and local governments situated within \u2018extended metropolitan regions\u2019 (McGee et al., 1999).2.The severe (although spatially differentiated) impacts of major exogenous shocks on regional and national economies, including the aftermath of the 9/11 experience in New York, the Bali night-club explosion of October 2002, and the lingering effects of the 1997 fiscal and economic crisis in the Asia-Pacific. These impacts have included inter alia sharply diminished air travel and tourism in many regions, increasing unemployment, and problems of corporate illiquidity and bankruptcies. We can also acknowledge the recent impact of sars (severe acute respiratory syndrome) upon major Asia-Pacific service industries, notably airlines, hotels and retail trade.3.Economic and developmental implications of a series of unresolved security crises within Asia and the Middle East especially, including the apparently intractable Palestinian question, the Iraq crisis, and the problem of North Korea's incipient nuclear capacity. These implications include a more problematic investment climate within affected nations and proximate regions.4.The rapid rise (and even more dramatic contraction) of the so-called \u2018New Economy\u2019, over the last 5 years. The collapse of the dot.coms notwithstanding, however, information and telecommunications industries constitute essential features of all advanced economies, and are playing increasingly central developmental roles within the Asia-Pacific region (Corey, 1998).5.The emergence of the \u2018urban cultural economy\u2019, underpinned by what Allen Scott describes as the convergence of culture and urban development, and comprising both cultural production and consumption as leading sectors within a growing number of cities and city-regions (Scott, 2000). Cultural industries (including creative design industries, media and multimedia, and film, video and music production) represent increasingly important sectors of the urban economy, in cities such as Los Angeles, Tokyo, Kyoto, Singapore, Bangkok, and Melbourne.6.Sharply divergent economic fortunes of the Asia-Pacific's major nation-states, including the remarkable growth of advanced industrial production and trade in China, the continuing Japanese economic malaise, and slow growth in the American economy (The stagnation of American consumer markets has also seriously retarded exports from other Asia-Pacific nations.).7.Continuing processes of restructuring and transition among the advanced economies of east and southeast Asia, including Taiwan, South Korea, and Singapore, as well as in \u2018threshold\u2019 NICs such as Malaysia, Thailand, and Vietnam. To illustrate, an \u201cimportant feature of ASEAN economic development has been the growth of their services sector\u201d (Tongzon, 2002: 71), as reflected in GDP and employment data.8.New phases of development within the industrial structures and space-economies of Asia-Pacific city-regions, exemplified by processes of accelerated tertiarization, decentralization, and multinucleation among major Chinese coastal city-regions (Yeh and Wu, 2001), and by the emergence of \u2018new economy\u2019 clusters within inner city sites of cities such as Tokyo, Singapore, San Francisco, and Vancouver.9.Increasing awareness within the Asia-Pacific of ecological implications of accelerated development (and more particularly rapid industrialization), including resource depletion and overall environmental degradation, stimulating interest in principles of sustainable development.10.Exacerbation of urban social problems (increasing income disparities, social polarization, and community dislocation), both in rapidly growing states (notably China) and also in some lagging countries and regions within the Asia-Pacific. These social costs are discounted by some as inevitable outcomes of rapid economic growth, but there has also been evidence of interest in exploring possibilities for reducing social inequities, both in terms of new socio-political \u2018compromises\u2019 at national government levels (Scott et al., 1999), and also commitments to social planning as an integral feature of local government and administration.\n",

The single-minded pursuit of transformational urban development through market integration, enhanced (or induced) comparative advantage in export service trade, and comprehensive local re-imaging has led to large-scale community displacement and dislocation (as in Shanghai), high corporate and municipal financial exposure (Yokohama's MM21 project, and Tokyo's waterfront development), and inflation in local property markets (many instances throughout the region).",

In a number of cases, urban programmes of accelerated tertiarization have been undertaken within a context of urban-regional industrial decline or obsolescence. This has been observed within the Japanese metropolitan system, where the \u2018hollowing out\u2019 of the national industrial economy has been deeply felt, in terms of factory closures (or relocation offshore) and protracted structural unemployment.

Underpinning this defining policy shift was the work of a special subcommittee exploring the merits of manufacturing\u2014versus services-led urban development and growth. The subcommittee concluded that advanced, specialized services enterprises \u201ccontribute about twice as much value-added as manufacturing firms\u201d (Clad, 1986), and constituted a more promising growth sector than most forms of goods production. Accordingly the Government of Singapore embarked upon a comprehensive programme to accelerate growth in specialized services in 1986, including incentives for foreign investors, new expenditures in education and training, sweeping fiscal changes (including major tax cuts, and reductions in payroll taxes), service industry support programmes, and marketing and information strategies.",

David Edgington has written extensively about the role of industrial restructuring policies for the important Nagoya\u2013Chukyo Region, a key part of Japan's industrial heartland. He depicts schematically a progression of new industrial vocations for Chukyo over the second half of the 20th century, which includes (first) a mix of heavy industry (aircraft production and munitions) up to the 1950s; secondly, a shift to heavy industries (steel and petrochemicals) and consumer products over the 1960s; followed by strong growth in auto production (Toyota), heavy engineering, and light industries during the 1970s and 1980s. However, the last decade in the Nagoya\u2013Chukyo region has seen new local (prefectural and municipal) policies and planning in support of a \u2018new vocation\u2019 of knowledge-intensive industries, including aerospace, advanced electronics, new ceramic materials, information technology, biotechnology, and fashion design and production (Edgington, 1996: 67). This new vocation builds upon the Nagoya\u2013Chukyo Region's embedded excellence in advanced industrial production, but with greatly enhanced services, design, and technology inputs to production. Here, the role of local government (as distinct from the well-known national government industrial support programmes) has emphasized \u201cstrengthening regional culture, design and general amenity upgrading for Chukyo\u201d as an \u201cimportant part of regional restructuring\u201d (Edgington, 1996: 69). The Nagoya\u2013Chukyo experience represents an example of complementarity between central and local governments in promoting industrial restructuring at the regional level.",

These efforts to pursue co-operation in economic development have been documented in a recent book edited by Anthony Gar-on Yeh et al. (2002), titled Building a Competitive Pearl River Delta Region: Co-operation, Co-ordination, and Planning. To some extent, of course, this desire to achieve co-ordination is related to the need to avoid wasteful, inefficient duplication of functions, to preserve resources, and to rationalize spatial planning in a congested, high growth region. There is also a need to \u2018manage\u2019 competition between the two major centres of the region, Hong Kong and Guangzhou (Kwok and Ames, 1995, Cheung, 2002). However, an important principle underpinning the increasing levels of co-operation within this administratively fragmented and complex region is the exigency of responding to pressures (and opportunities) of globalization. In this respect, the Pearl River Delta contains both a dense pattern of manufacturing and industrial production, as well as concentrations of specialized service industries, institutions, and functions, including banking and finance, seaports, airports, higher education, cultural and creative services, and public administration. These specialized services represent the best prospects for future growth and development in the region, and greater co-operation and co-ordination of these key services can significantly strengthen the PRD's competitive position within East Asia and global markets.",

Within the Guangzhou city-region, the combination of liberalized development policies, a greatly expanded role for the market, and high levels of growth have reshaped urban structure and land use over the last 15 years, as disclosed in a recent empirical study by Fulong Wu and Anthony Gar-on Yeh. During this period, there has been substantial redevelopment within Guangzhou's central city, but its overall spatial reconfiguration \u201cis changing from a compact city to a dispersed metropolis as a result of reforms which introduced land values and markets to its urban areas\u201d (Wu and Yeh, 1999: 393). A measure of this dispersal and sprawl consists of industrial estates, but new service industries and commercial development, driven in large part by foreign investors, also play a role in this process. As Wu and Yeh conclude, \u201c[the] conflict between urban spatial restructuring and development control is inevitable\u201d (Wu and Yeh, 1999: 393) in high-growth cities characterized by the decline of central planning and inadequate local planning powers. Michael Leaf goes even further, asserting that in these dynamic Chinese cities, \u201cthe practice of urban planning may have passed from irrelevance under the command economy of the past to gross ineffectiveness in the socialist market economy of today\u201d (Leaf, 1998: 145). Moreover, local planning systems in at least some Chinese cities are developing more sophisticated planning styles, and an increasing number of planning professionals are engaged in exploring sustainability principles, so it may be that the next generation of city-region plans will incorporate stronger elements of sustainable development.",

Agglomeration of advanced service industries promotes the \u2018cluster-driven\u2019 process of advanced urban development, as seen in the Vancouver example described earlier. Other important examples within the Asia-Pacific include the global-scale concentration of advanced-technology service industries clustered in Redmond, Washington, within the metropolitan Seattle-King County city-region, and the recent development of Sydney's North Shore high-tech corridor. This corridor has seen a functional and spatial evolution over the past four decades, initiated in the 1950s by a secondary CBD in North Sydney, at the north end of the Sydney Harbour Bridge, followed by the establishment of a major regional shopping centre in the 1960s, and the development of Macquarie University on a nearby site (O'Connor et al., 2001). With these activities serving as a base, the last two decades have seen the dramatic growth of new technology-based industries and advanced services: the north Shore corridor is anchored by Microsoft Corporation at one end, and Cable and Wireless Optics at the other, with five commercial clusters situated between these two major poles (O'Connor et al., 2001). By the mid-1990s, employment within the North Shore corridor exceeded 200 000, included jobs situated within 325 member companies of the Australian Information Industry Association (O'Connor et al., 2001). Sheehan quotes a property consultant as describing the North Shore corridor as \u201ctechnology land, but it's not physical production, it's brain power and computer power, biased toward sales, service and management rather than research, development and production\u201d (Sheehan (1999: 6), as quoted in O'Connor et al. (2001: 4\u20135)). Clearly, on this evidence, market players (investors, entrepreneurs, and professionals) have been central to the development of Sydney's North Shore corridor, but government and public agencies have played leading roles in terms of regional spatial planning, municipal land use policy, and in tertiary education investment. The Sydney North Shore corridor experience also vividly depicts the functional evolution of service industry clusters over time, in this case from a secondary office and shopping centre to an incipient high-technology site, and finally to a large-scale \u2018New Economy\u2019 site of national significance, including advanced-technology industries and specialized service functions.",

As Allen Scott has observed in a well-known treatment of \u2018the cultural economy of cities\u2019, \u201c[a]s we enter the 21st century, a very marked convergence between the spheres of cultural and economic development seems to be occurring\u201d (Scott, 1997: 323). Within cities, the expansion of this new cultural sector includes film, video and music production, graphic artists, industrial design, fashion design, and architecture, as well as \u2018hybridized\u2019 firms which combine creative and technological outputs toward products (goods and services) imbued with high design content, including multimedia and \u2018new media\u2019 activities, internet graphics and imaging, and software design. Again to reference Scott, \u201can ever-widening range of economic activity is concerned with producing and marketing goods and services that are infused in one way or another with broadly aesthetic or semiotic attributes\u201d (Scott, 1997: 323).

The rapid expansion of these important new industries can be seen as the most recent development phase in the continuing evolution of the urban service economy, and the enduring competitive advantage of cities for specialized cultural production, as well as the reassertion of production activity in the inner city districts of some urban areas. Moreover, these new forms of specialized cultural services production are characterized by a distinctive interface with consumer markets, as many of these industries supply what Scott terms \u2018cultural products\u2019 (Scott, 1997: 323) which influence public tastes and preferences, and are concerned with differentiating consumer market segments. The \u2018new cultural economy\u2019 represents a leading-edge urban policy area. Within the mature urban societies of the Atlantic core, there is a significant record of policy innovation. For example, within the EU, there are numerous programmes for both national and local governments to support cultural industries, including the annual designation of \u2018European Cultural Cities\u2019.

In Shenzen, a new three-year study of the city's dynamic cultural industries will include empirical research on clustering, linkage patterns (both place- and web-based), and the discourse of cultural landscapes, both to enlarge scholarly appreciation of these industries, and to inform policy (Li, 2002, personal communication). On the other hand, the city of Shanghai is demolishing the warehouses along Suzhou Creek which have provided a distinctive milieu for artists, artisans, and other creative workers. This eradication of Shanghai's artist-loft district has been criticized as inimical to the fostering of cultural industries which complement the commercial functions of world cities, and to the emergence of an important \u2018spontaneous\u2019 (as distinct from induced) creative services cluster.

The growth of advanced service industries will be crucial to the development of Asia-Pacific city-regions (and indeed to national economic progress) over the first decades of the new century. More particularly, advanced, specialized service industries will be central to employment and human capital formation, to the expansion of the urban middle class, to the more efficient operation of advanced industrial production systems and trade networks, and both to urban competitive advantage and the socio-economic sustainability of Asia-Pacific cities. Reinforcing this latter point, many of the region's large industrial metropoles will begin to \u2018shed\u2019 manufacturing employment (as experienced in the wrenching deindustrialization of mature Atlantic city regions, and in the \u2018hollowing out\u2019 of Japanese manufacturing capacity), and will need services growth to partially offset these contractions. At the same time, growth in advanced service industries and employment will require greater public policy commitments, not only in the areas of infrastructure and supporting systems, and in land use policies, but also in education and training. Here, we can return to an earlier comparative theme addressed in this paper, by acknowledging that effective policies for services (incorporating developmental as well as regulatory elements) have been seen as lacking in the old Atlantic core (Daniels et al., 1991, Coffey, 1996), despite a relatively early experience of growth in advanced services within the region as a whole. The cities of the Asia-Pacific (and their respective central and regional governments) will need to develop more innovative policy approaches toward service industries over the next decade and beyond, reflecting the increasing significance of advanced services for economic transition and modernization.",

The facilitation of advanced services growth can, as we have seen in a number of Asia-Pacific cities, entail the dislocation of traditional industries, informal services, and residential populations. A balance must be struck between the imperatives of economic modernization and the claims of social justice, as well as respect for diversity and pluralism. A progressive urban planning posture should support the preservation of informal services and historic city districts, both of which sustain the authenticity of local identity, while at the same time promoting the intermediate, technology-based, creative and other specialized services essential to development. The idea of sustainable development, which has been articulated in some urban strategic plans within the region (at least at a rhetorical level), may present a progressive planning framework for integrating social, economic, and ecological values. Recent research has disclosed that there may in fact be significant policy complements intersecting urban sustainability and competitive advantage, including policies for compact urban structure and land use, efficient transportation and transit, and education investments (Goldberg and Hutton, 2000), which may inter alia support advanced service industry development, as well as enhancing social welfare and ecological sustainability.",

These contrasts can be attributed in part to different models of intermediate services production and exchange, to the special roles of government policy in promoting accelerated services growth, and to the marked disparities in overall development at national and regional scales within the Asia-Pacific. These contrasts were identified and incorporated in our provisional typology of urban service specialization. The differentiated growth rates and levels of specialization in advanced services decisively influences urban hierarchy within the region, as well as patterns of services trade and exchange, and global city-region status (Rimmer, 1996). Indeed, one of the salient issues for the future will be the extent to which full globalization processes may override established regional service markets, for example in finance, property and real estate, among others. The specialized service centres and corridors described earlier may emerge as platforms for the globalization of services produced within the Asia-Pacific, as well as engines of development within the region.",

There is a need to reconsider urban models embedded within the industrialization paradigm, in order to accommodate the increasing influence of service industries in the development of urban regions within the Pacific realm. These theoretical exercises will naturally acknowledge the centrality of industrial trends and economic factors, but will ideally transcend narrow economistic parameters to consider both the social implications of services growth, as well as the socio-cultural basis of advanced tertiarization, following the lead of progressive urban scholarship both in the Atlantic and Pacific spheres (Moulaert and Gallouj, 1993, Kim et al., 1997). More specifically, there is a clear need for conceptualization of trajectories of service sector development within the Asia-Pacific which embody experiences of differentiation and exceptionalism that abound within the region, as well as more widely observed features. Beyond this important theoretical terrain, urban scholarship should address the relationships between the location of service industries and the reconfiguration of regional structure and the metropolitan space-economy. Innovative new research in this realm includes Larissa Muller's work on business services in Southeast Asia, incorporating commentary on opportunities \u2018for localizing international investment\u2019 within the region (Muller, 2002). At the larger metropolitan scale, these models would position services as decisive influences on multinucleation, and would encompass spatial linkages between advanced services and manufacturing enterprises in regional production systems. At a more localized level, new urban spatial models should incorporate the emergence of emerging clusters of specialized services within reconstructed precincts of the inner city, including constituent ensembles of integrated services production networks. This should include research on the \u2018New Economy\u2019 industries and cultural and creative activities which comprise the most recent phase of urban service industry development.",

The extent to which these three powerful sets of forces\u2014an ascendant new middle class of elite service workers, emerging social divisions of service labour, and globalization processes\u2014influence social change and exacerbate social polarization tendencies within Asia-Pacific cities will surely assume greater theoretical and normative importance over the next decade and beyond.",
