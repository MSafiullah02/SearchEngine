Rarely, fever pattern can be diagnostic, such as alternate-day fever in tertian malaria (vivax or falciparum) and saddle back biphasic fever (dengue). Biphasic fever with the first phase lasting 5\u20137 days is followed by a second febrile phase for 1\u20132 days.Anorexia and weight loss:History of severe weight loss is present in some tropical infections such as tuberculosis, visceral leishmaniasis, brucellosis, giardiasis, and schistosomiasis.Diarrhea and vomiting:Acute watery diarrhea is a presenting feature of cholera, Giardia, rotavirus, Cryptosporidium, Isospora, and Bacillus cereus (toxin).Bloody diarrhea occurs in amebic dysentery, enteroinvasive and enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli, Shigella, Salmonella, Yersinia, Clostridium perfringens, and Campylobacter.Chronic diarrhea (>2 weeks) is characteristic of giardiasis, amebiasis, ileocecal tuberculosis, strongyloidiasis, schistosomiasis, and Trichuris infestation.Abdominal pain:Acute abdomen with features of peritonitis may be present in typhoid perforation and ruptured amebic liver abscess.Other tropical infections presenting as acute abdomen are amebic liver abscess, splenic rupture (malaria, typhoid), biliary colic (Ascaris), intestinal obstruction or volvulus (Ascaris), acute salpingitis (Chlamydia), and severe gastroenteritis.Jaundice:Jaundice with fever may be a presenting feature of certain tropical infections such as viral hepatitis , leptospirosis, typhus, typhoid, yellow fever, brucellosis, amebic liver abscess, miliary tuberculosis, malaria (hemolysis\u2014G6PD deficiency), ascending cholangitis (Ascaris), and hemolytic uremic syndrome (Shigella, E. coli).Cough and dyspnea:These may be prominent in infections such as extensive pulmonary tuberculosis, amebic lung abscess, acute respiratory distress syndrome (scrub typhus, leptospirosis, malaria during late phase), diffuse intra-alveolar hemorrhage (dengue, leptospirosis, hemorrhagic fever), pulmonary hydatid disease, paragonimiasis, and pneumonic plague.Headache:Most febrile illnesses\u2014especially malaria, typhoid, and dengue fever\u2014are accompanied by headache.Sore throat:Severe sore throat with painful swallowing is characteristic of Corynebacterium diphtheriae infection.Hematuria, dysuria, and renal colic:Some tropical infections such as schistosomiasis, renal tuberculosis, and chlamydial urethritis can present with hematuria.History of skin rash (see\nStep 3).Travel history: A list of places visited in recent past in chronological order should be elicited. Endemic infections in different geographical areas should be considered in differential diagnosis.Occupational history: Exposure to contaminated water source may be a clue to leptospirosis.Seasonal variation: Many tropical infections have propensity to occur during the monsoon season.Animal exposure: pet dogs (ticks\u2014rickettsial infection, ehrlichiosis etc.)\n\n",

In the secondary dengue, IgG antibodies are present in high titer early in illness.Detection of antibodies by hemagglutination inhibition assay: at least fourfold rise in titer of neutralizing antibodies in paired samples.\nLeptospirosisSerology with the microscopic agglutination test is the gold standard with either a fourfold rise in titers between acute and convalescent serum or a single titer of more than 1:800 being diagnostic.Other serological tests are IgM antibody by an enzyme-based dot immunoassay with a sensitivity of 30% at 3 days and of 100% at 10 days into the illness.Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test for Leptospira antigen shows considerable promise.Raised creatine phosphokinase levels is a supportive finding.\nMalariaThree thick and thin smears 12\u201324 h apart should be obtained. The highest yield of peripheral parasites occurs during or soon after a fever spike; however, smears should not be delayed while awaiting fever spikes.Thick smears are 20 times more sensitive than thin smears, but speciation may be more difficult. The parasitemia can be calculated based on the number of infected RBCs.Thin smears are less sensitive than thick smears but facilitate speciation. This should be considered a qualitative test.The quantitative buffy coat is a technique that is as sensitive as thick smears.Malarial antigen\u2014immunochromatographic tests based on antibodies to malarial antigen like histidine-rich protein-2 (Pf HRP2), parasite LDH (pLDH), or plasmodium aldolase appear to be very sensitive and specific.RDT has sensitivity and specificity of >95%. Malaria is ruled out if two RDTs respectively are negative.\nRickettsial infectionLook for eschar (black crust, 5\u201320 mm)\u2014found in 40% cases.IgM Scrub TyphusWeil Felix OXK: 1 in 320 or more (highly specific, poor sensitivity.

Cultures of bone marrow is 90% sensitive until at least 5 days after commencement of antibiotics. Blood, intestinal secretions and stool cultures are positive in 85\u201390% of patients who present within the first week of onset. Multiple blood cultures (>3) yield a sensitivity of 73\u201397%. Large volume (10\u201330 ml) blood culture may increase the likelihood of detection.Special investigationsProcalcitonin, ESR, CRP.Aspirates, scrapings, and pustular fluid may be obtained for Gram staining and culture. When a herpes simplex virus infection is suspected, a Tzanck test may be performed by unroofing a lesion and taking a scraping of the lesion base.Biopsy samples from nonhealing or persistent purpuric lesions: Biopsy of inflammatory dermal nodules, ulcers, and muscles (tropical pyomyositis) should be done.HIV serology.Imaging: chest x-ray, echo, ultrasound of abdomen, and CT scan (when indicated).\n",

            "text": "\nDengueA protocol for intravenous fluid therapy has been developed by the World Health Organization (WHO).An initial bolus of 5% dextrose in normal saline or Ringer lactate (20 mL/kg of body weight) is infused over 15 min, followed by continuous infusion (10\u201320 mL/kg/h, depending on the clinical response) until vital signs and urine output normalize.Crystalloids are equally effective as colloids in fluid resuscitation.Normalization of the hematocrit is an important goal of early fluid repletion.However, a normal or low hematocrit may be misleading in patients with overt bleeding and severe hypovolemia.Close clinical observation is essential, even after normal blood volume is restored, because patients can develop shock for 1\u20132 days after initial fluid resuscitation, which represents the period of increased vascular permeability in dengue hemorrhagic fever.Management of fever:Control fever with paracetamol, cold sponging, and cold IV fluids.Avoid aspirin and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs due to bleeding risk and risk of developing Reye syndrome (encephalopathy).Manage shock and multiorgan failure.Manage secondary infections.Manage complications.Clinical guides for bleeding.Bleeding timeFundus examination\u2014retinal hemorrhagesHess capillary test/Tourniquet test: positive is more than 20 petechiae in an area of 1 in. when the blood pressure cuff is inflated midway between systolic and diastolic blood pressure for 5 min.Platelet transfusions need to be given for symptomatic thrombocytopenia.Platelet transfusions have not been shown to be effective in preventing or controlling hemorrhage but may be warranted in patients with severe thrombocytopenia (<10,000/mm3) and active bleeding. Prophylactic platelet transfusions in patients with severe thrombocytopenia but without active bleeding are generally not recommended.Manage complications of fluid therapy in dengue fever.A decrease in hematocrit together with stable hemodynamic status and adequate urine output indicates hemodilution and/or reabsorption of extravasated fluids.Judicious use of intravenous fluids with proper monitoring is recommended.Fluid therapy may have to be discontinued if required, immediately, to avoid pulmonary edema, electrolyte imbalance, hypo- or hypernatremia, and hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis.LeptospirosisTreatment involves the use of crystalline penicillin at a dose of six million units daily or ceftriaxone 1 g every 12 h.In penicillin-allergic patients, intravenous or oral doxycycline, 100 mg every 12 h, can be used.Manage shock, disseminated intravascular coagulation, and multiorgan failure.Scrub typhusDoxycycline is the drug of choice.In case of small children and pregnant women, azithromycin is the drug of choice.Rifampicin has also been used as an alternative drug.Enteric FeverCeftriaxone i.v. 50\u201375 mg/kg/day for 10\u201314 days is the drug of choice to cover MDR S. typhi. Azithromycin and Ciprofloxacin are alternatives.Consider dexamethasone 3 mg/kg followed by 1 mg/kg 6 hourly for 48 h in selected cases with encephalopathy, hypotension or DIC.Falciparum malariaFor Plasmodium falciparum infections acquired in areas without chloroquine-resistant strains, patients should be treated with oral chloroquine. A chloroquine dose of 600 mg base (=1000 mg salt) should be given initially, followed by 300 mg base (=500 mg salt) at 6, 24, and 48 h after the initial dose for a total chloroquine dose of 1500 mg base (=2500 mg salt).For chloroquine-resistant strains, treatment options are as follows:Artemisinin derivatives clear parasites very rapidly, are now a key component of malaria treatment worldwide, and have been shown to reduce mortality in severe malaria compared with parenteral quinine. Artemisinin-based combination therapies, including artesunate\u2013mefloquine, artemether\u2013lumefantrine, artesunate\u2013amodiaquine, and dihydroartemisinin\u2013piperaquine, are highly efficacious.Under the CDC protocol, intravenous artesunate is administered in four equal doses of 2.4 mg/kg of body weight over a period of 3 days. The dosing schedule recommended by the WHO entails doses every 12 h on day 1 and then once daily.Up to 7 days of therapy may occasionally be indicated in very ill patients.\nQuinine sulfate: Quinine has a rapid onset of action and, in combination with tetracycline, doxycycline, or clindamycin, has been shown to be a very efficacious treatment option for P. falciparum infections acquired in regions with chloroquine-resistant strains.\n",
