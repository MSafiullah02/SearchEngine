These estimates vary widely, however, depending on the extent of active surveillance and the use of serologic vs. molecular diagnostics. Respiratory infections are of particular concern among HCP because of the close contact of HCP with patients [2], and the risk of HCP transmitting respiratory viruses to others [3]. Although recent research suggests that certain subgroups of HCP, such as those who perform aerosol-generating procedures, may be at heightened risk of infection with influenza and other respiratory pathogens [4], incidence of infections among HCP is not well characterized across different occupations and responsibilities. Furthermore, although HCP often work while ill [5\u20137], the extent to which infected HCP transmit respiratory pathogens to patients is not clear [8]. Further research is needed on the frequency and types of interactions HCP have with patients when they have symptomatic, atypical, or asymptomatic [1, 9] influenza virus infections.",

Numerous studies on the knowledge, attitudes, and practices (KAP) associated with influenza vaccine acceptance and rejection have been conducted among HCP in high-income countries in North America and Europe [13\u201316]. However, much less is known about the barriers to vaccine acceptance among HCP in countries in the Middle East [12]. In Israel, a high-income country, less than half (49%) of HCP received influenza vaccine for the 2015\u20132016 influenza season; vaccine coverage was somewhat higher among hospital-based physicians (53%) than nurses (46%) [17]. More information is needed on the occupational, socio-demographic, and KAP factors that may explain variations in influenza vaccine acceptance in Israel, including how the personal KAP of HCP may impact on their promotion of influenza vaccination among their patients.",

Given that vaccinated individuals are less likely to seroconvert after an influenza virus infection and so can appear as not having been infected [20, 21], the use of serologic outcomes likely biases (and specifically, inflates) vaccine efficacy estimates.",

Evidence is also needed to validate the potential of the vaccine in reducing the severity and duration of disease and diminish infectiousness among those who have breakthrough infections despite being vaccinated [24, 26]. Because HCP often receive influenza vaccine during multiple years, studies of HCP also provide an opportunity to examine how prior vaccinations may modify immunogenicity and vaccine effectiveness, and may provide answers to questions regarding the extent of residual protection and/or negative vaccine interference across seasons [27\u201329].",

Egg-grown viruses will be supplied by the US CDC\u2019s International Reagent Resource. Preparation of serum samples will include (a) treatment with a receptor-destroying enzyme to remove nonspecific inhibitors, and (b) removal of nonspecific agglutinins by serum adsorption with packed red blood cells (RBC). Standard 0.5% turkey RBC will be prepared for influenza A (H1N1)pdm09 antigens and ether-treated B influenza antigens. Given indications that neuraminidase of circulating antigenic clusters of influenza A(H3N2) viruses (since 2014) have acquired the ability to bind to RBC, modified HI assays will be conducted for influenza A(H3N2) antigens using guinea pig red blood cells in the presence of the antiviral oseltamivir carboxylate, which inhibits influenza neuraminidase. Serum will be diluted 2-fold starting from 1:10. The HI titer will be the reciprocal of the serum dilution in the last well with complete HI. The geometric mean titer from duplicate results will be reported; HI < 10 will be considered 5 for the purposes of statistical analyses.",

Soroka University Medical Center, the only general hospital in the Negev region in southern Israel, serves two main local populations: Jews, who mostly live in urban settings, and Bedouin Arabs, who live in a range of settlement types, from cities to unrecognized rural villages that lack electricity and running water [42, 43]. Beilinson Hospital, located in central Israel, serves a mostly urban population of a relatively higher socio-economic status compared to Soroka University Medical Center. Conducting our study in these two different settings may allow us to identify socio-demographic differences in KAP, vaccine uptake, and influenza illness attack rates.
