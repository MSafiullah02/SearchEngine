However, the recent COVID pandemic has resulted in a serious shortage of these masks leading to a worldwide effort to develop decontamination and re-use procedures. A major factor contributing to the filtration efficiency of N95 masks is the presence of an intermediate layer of charged polypropylene electret fibers that trap particles through electrostatic or electrophoretic effects. This charge degrades quickly when the mask is used. Moreover, simple decontamination procedures (e.g. use of alcohol) immediately degrade any remaining charge from the polypropylene, thus severely impacting the filtration efficiency post decontamination. In this brief report, we summarize preliminary results on the development of a simple laboratory setup allowing measurement of charge and filtration efficiency in N95 masks. We show how the charge on the mask changes due to decontamination treatments, and correlate with reduced filtration efficiency. Additionally, we propose and show that it is possible to recharge the masks post-decontamination treatment and recover filtration efficiency. Importantly, recharging can be performed using readily available equipment and materials, and so can be employed both in urban and rural settings.",

At the present time, various brands of masks available commercially are meant for one-time usage due to potential contamination, as well as the rapid degradation of their filtration efficiency with use.

A particle can be captured either if it finds a mask material fiber directly in its way or if the mask material can attract the particles and trap them [5] . Flow through the mask is usually thought to be laminar, such that the flow would usually bend smoothly around an obstacle (fiber). If this is the case, mechanical capture of the particle on the surface of the fiber happens either when the inertia of the particle is large enough such that it can deviate from its streamline path and make an impact with the mask material, or the particle is small enough such that its Brownian diffusion is strong and it deviates from the streamline which allows it to make an impact with material.",

Most N95 masks depend on both mechanical and electrostatic effects to achieve filtration. The electrostatic filtration of N95 masks is performed by a mesh of charged polypropylene melt-woven charged fibers (electrets).

Nevertheless, the charge on the polypropylene undergoes significant degradation when open to the surroundings, which is exacerbated by the warm humid environment created by respiration during use.

The experimental protocol was as follows: 1. A pristine mask was first placed on a flat metal piece connected to the electrometer to measure its charge. The filtration efficiency of this mask at 0.3 \u00b5m was measured using the mask tester. There is an apparent correlation between the amount of charge in the pristine mask and its filtration efficiency, \u03b7, as shown in Table 1 .

            "text": "The Magnum mask was sanitized by dipping it in ethanol. After recharging the mask to \u223c 1 nC the efficiency recovers to \u223c 86% . This recharged mask was discharged in situ by dropping ethanol on the mask (see 9 (a)).Specifically, the protocol for this run was:1. Baseline: We measured the filtering efficiency, \u03b7, of a brand-new N95 Magnum mask with the edges taped for 0.3\u00b5m particles to be \u223c 95%. The measured charge was \u223c 1nC.2. The mask was sanitized by dipping it in ethanol and drying overnight, after which the charge was measured to be \u223c 0.03nC, indicating that the mask had lost effectively all its charge.3. The mask was then recharged for at 1000V for 60 minutes.4. The charged mask was put on the mask tester (see Fig. 9 (a) at 2200 s). The edges of the mask were taped to prevent leakage from sides. We obtain efficiency of about 86%.5. At about 3125 s (see Fig. 9 (a)) about 1 ml of ethanol was spread on the mask. The filtration efficiency, \u03b7, was reduced to 70 %. This is due to the loss of charge in the mask.6. At about 4500 s (see Fig. 9 (a)) this mask was taken off. It was then dried by blowing hot air (50 \u2022 C).7. The dried mask was then put back on the mask tester. The efficiency, \u03b7, of this mask is about 50%. This indicates that residual alcohol was responsible for blocking pores of the mask, resulting in apparent increased filtration efficiency.In situ recharging measurementsThe previous experiments involved extensive handling of the masks in attaching and detaching them from the filtration tester. In order to reduce errors due to changes in mask fitting on the apparatus, as well as those due to handling, we undertook an in situ experiment. In this experiment, a mask was",
