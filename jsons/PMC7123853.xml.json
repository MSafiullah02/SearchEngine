            "text": "Historically, most of the currently used anti-infectives of natural origin were derived from soil-dwelling microorganisms, such as fungi and actinomycetes, and in limited cases from terrestrial plants (antimalarial agents) [2, 3]. A few notable examples include the \u03b2-lactam antibiotic penicillin G from the fungus , the macrolide erythromycin from the actinomycete , and the antimalarial compound artemisinin from the plant [4]. Most of these agents were introduced between the 1940s and 1960s, during the so-called \u2018golden era\u2019 of antibiotic discovery; however, the development of novel antibiotics dramatically dropped over the past several decades, partially based on the misleading notion that the battle against microbial infections has been won. Moreover, in recent years, the emerging microbial drug resistance against many clinically used anti-infective drugs has jeopardized their treatment efficacy. In particular, according to the World Health Organization (WHO), resistant strains of Gram-positive bacteria (Staphylococcus aureus and Enterococcus sp.), Gram-negative bacteria (Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Acinetobacter baumannii), Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Candida sp., Plasmodium falciparum, or HIV, among others, have become a global threat [5]. This antibiotic resistance crisis may lead to extremely severe public health consequences unless adequate global responses, including development of new antimicrobials, are achieved [6]. Thus, the discovery of new antimicrobial agents from nature, preferably with new mechanisms of action, higher selectivity, and less sensitivity to drug-resistance development, remains an important investigation area of natural products research.",

Literature data have shown that the majority of these metabolites, including those entering clinical trials, are mainly being developed in the areas of analgesia and cancer [10]. However, following the success of marine-derived natural products in drug discovery, marine organisms have captured wide attention as a promising source for antimicrobial bioprospecting , as highlighted by the considerable rise of publications in recent years dealing with the discovery of anti-infective agents [1, 11].\n",

Among the purified compounds, 11\u2032,12\u2032-dehydroelaiophylin (17), elaiophylin, 11-O-methylelaiophylin, and efomycin G (18\u201320) were the most potent ones against different MRSA strains and vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE) with MIC values ranging from 1 to 4 \u03bcg/ml [17]. In addition, 18 and 20 were also active against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus epidermidis (MRSE) with MICs ranging from 2 to 16 \u03bcg/ml [17]. No cross-resistance was observed between 17 and 20 and erythromycin or azithromycin (14- and 15-membered macrolides) confirming that the activity of elaiophylins (16-membered lactone) is not affected by the macrolide resistance mechanism in Gram-positive bacteria. SAR studies revealed that the hemiketal moiety at 11 and 11\u2032 positions is important for the antibacterial activity, whereas substitution of the 14\u2032 ethyl group with a methyl group reduces the activity, thereby proving the essential role of the alkyl group at positions C-14 or C-14\u2032.",

Compound 22 exhibited potent activity against a panel of Gram-positive pathogens, including Bacillus anthracis, E. faecalis, S. pneumoniae, as well as methicillin- and vancomycin-resistant strains of S. aureus with MIC values less than 0.25 \u03bcg/ml [19, 20]. Moreover, 22 showed marked effects on the growth rate of MRSA even at sub-MIC concentrations (1/16 MIC; 0.0078 \u03bcg/ml), compared to the antibacterial agent vancomycin. Notably, 22 exhibited low mammalian cell cytotoxicity with an IC50 value of 70 \u03bcg/ml and was shown to exert synergistic effects with the human cathelicidin LL-37 on MRSA growth. Further investigation employing an optimized macromolecular synthesis assay indicated disruption of nucleic acid synthesis from 22 at concentrations near the MIC, thus suggesting that this effect might be related to its mode of action. Following these intriguing results, a murine peritonitis model of infection was employed to ascertain in vivo efficacy of 22. Interestingly, anthracimycin (22) at a single i.p. injection dose of 1 or 10 mg/kg, even one hour after MRSA infection, provided sufficient protection against mortality and was well tolerated by mice, thus suggesting its potential as a novel lead scaffold against MRSA [19].",

(CMB-MF010), isolated from the inner tissues of a mollusk of the genus Siphonaria collected near Shorncliffe, Australia [22]. Viridicatumtoxins\nare a rare family of fungal polyketides structurally related to the tetracycline class of antibiotics. Notably, viridicatumtoxins A\u2013E (29\u221233), as well as compounds 34 and 35, showed potent activity against MRSA and VRE with IC50 values less than 5.5 \u03bcg/ml.

Moreover, viridicatumtoxin A (29) was shown to be remarkably stable when subjected to different acid degradation protocols, suggesting that the viridicatumtoxin framework could potentially be utilized to optimize oral bioavailability and efficacy of tetracycline antibiotics. In a subsequent study, viridicatumtoxin A (29) and spirohexaline (34) were discovered as inhibitors of recombinant undecaprenyl pyrophosphate (UPP) synthase from S. aureus with IC50 values of 2.3 and 5.1 \u03bcg/ml, respectively [23]. Moreover, these molecules showed only weak inhibitory activities toward catalytically related enzymes, such as octaprenyl pyrophosphate (OPP) synthase of E. coli and dehydrodolichyl pyrophosphate (DedolPP) synthase of the yeast S. cerevisiae, thus suggesting that these compounds selectively inhibit UPP synthase, which is in agreement with their anti-S. aureus activity. In addition, molecular docking studies revealed that 29 and 34 bind to the active site of this enzyme and compete with the natural substrate farnesyl pyrophosphate (FPP), thus corroborating their mode of antibacterial action via inhibition of UPP synthase activity [23].",

MCCC 3A00308 that was isolated from deep-sea sediment collected in the South Atlantic Ocean (2,869 m depth) led to the discovery of two new classes of compounds with antimicrobial properties, the antibacterial chlorodepsidones, spiromastixones A\u2013O, and the antiviral aromatic lactones, spiromastilactones A\u2013M (see Sect. 4.1) [32, 33]. Spiromastixones F\u2013J (54\u221258) displayed potent inhibitory effects against MRSA (MIC range from 1.92 to 14.9 \u03bcg/ml) as well as against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus epidermidis (MRSE) strains (MIC range from 0.86 to 14.9 \u03bcg/ml). Likewise, 54 showed activity against vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecalis and Enterococcus faecium with MICs of 1.9 \u03bcg/ml. In addition, spiromastixones G (55), J (58), K (59), and L (60) showed pronounced antibacterial effects against the Gram-positive strains S. aureus, Bacillus thuringiensis, and B. subtilis with MIC values less than 2 \u03bcg/ml, comparable to those of the positive control penicillin G. However, all compounds were found to be inactive against the Gram-negative bacterium E. coli (MIC > 128 \u03bcg/ml), suggesting their selective antibacterial action. Moreover, comparison of the antibacterial properties of the isolated spiromastixones revealed that increase of chlorine substitution as well as O-methylation in ring C are essential structural features for the antibacterial activity of these compounds [32]. Thus, the pronounced growth inhibition effects of 54\u201360 toward several Gram-positive bacteria, including drug-resistant clinical isolates, render these metabolites attractive for further antibiotic development.",

Subsequent mode-of-action studies, employing hemagglutination inhibition, surface plasmon resonance, and polykaryon assays, revealed that 129 binds to the HA1 subunit of hemagglutinin glycoprotein, blocking its interaction with the sialic acid receptor, and thus inhibits the attachment of H1N1 virus to host cells. Interestingly, 129 was found to inhibit influenza virus (strain A/WSN/33) propagation without causing viral resistance, as shown in a multi-passage experiment, employing a plaque formation assay (even after a fifth passage), in contrast to clinically used anti-influenza drugs, such as amantadine [69].

MCCC 3A00308 (see Sect. 2.2) afforded an array of new aromatic lactones with various chlorine atom substituents, spiromastilactones A\u2013M [33]. Bioactivity assays of these compounds revealed that most of the derivatives, bearing a pseudo-depsidone skeleton, possess antiviral activity. Spiromastilactones D (130) and E (131) showed the strongest antiviral activity against A/WSN/33 (H1N1) influenza virus propagated in MDCK cells with IC50 values of 2.8 and 5.3 \u03bcg/ml, respectively, similar to those of the positive controls oseltamivir (3.1 \u03bcg/ml) and amantadine (1.97 \u03bcg/ml). These findings allowed to conclude that monochlorination of ring B, in contrast to dichlorination, is important for expression of the strong antiviral activity of these metabolites. Moreover, formation of the pseudo-depsidone scaffold is essential for mediating antiviral properties, since the respective monomers spiromastilactone A (unit A) and divaric acid (unit B) were inactive. The most active compound, spiromastilactone D (130), exhibited a broad antiviral spectrum toward influenza A and B viruses, including oseltamivir- or amantadine-resistant clinical isolates, and therefore was chosen for further mode-of-action and molecular docking studies. Accordingly, 130 was shown to potentially bind to the hemagglutinin protein (HA1) subunit, adjacent to the sialic acid receptor binding pocket, thus disrupting the HA-sialic acid receptor interaction, which is crucial for the attachment of influenza viruses to host cells. Moreover, 130 was found to inhibit viral genome replication, probably via interfering with the viral ribonucleoprotein complex [33], verifying this metabolite as a potential anti-influenza lead structure for further development.",

Among them, HMPV is the most dangerous one as it can cause significant morbidity especially in infants and in elderly patients [71]. The brown seaweed Stypopodium zonale which is common along the Brazilian coast accumulates mainly meroditerpenes\n, with several of them exhibiting antiviral activity. Two meroditerpenoids atomaric acid\n1 (132) [72] and epitaondiol (133) were obtained from S. zonale, and the methyl ester of atomaric acid (134) was prepared by semi-synthesis [73]. Compounds 132\u2013134 exhibited antiviral activity against HMPV replication and showed selectivity indices of >56.81, 49.26, and 12.82, respectively. Epitaondiol (133) exhibited potent anti-HMPV activity (IC50 = 1.01 \u03bcg/ml) compared to atomaric acid methyl ester (134; IC50= 2.66 \u03bcg/ml) and its parent compound atomaric acid (132) (IC50= 3.52 \u03bcg/ml). Each compound exerted its effect by a unique mechanism: atomaric acid interacts with viral particles outside of the host cells thus preventing infection of the cell cultures. The compound has no effect on cellular receptors or on viral penetration. The meroditerpene epitaondiol (133) inhibits the penetration of viral particles into cells but without affecting the post-penetration stages or interacting with cellular receptors. The methyl ester of atomaric acid inhibits penetration of viral particles without exhibiting any effect on the post-penetration events and cellular receptors. These compounds showed selective antiviral activity with low cytotoxic activity against LLC-MK2 cells, thus highlighting their potential to inhibit HMPV in vitro [73].",

            "text": "In 2008, an intriguing prodigiosin-related compound, marineosin A (175), was isolated from the actinomycete Streptomyces sp. CNQ-617, derived from sediment collected off shore of La Jolla, California [95]. Biosynthetic studies assisted to identify the corresponding mar gene cluster, leading to 175 that appeared to be homologically similar to the red gene cluster described for the soil-dwelling S. coelicolor, responsible for the formation of undecylprodigionine (176) with additional steps requiring the spiroaminal functionality formation [96]. During further investigation, the antimalarial potency of 175 as well as of two further biosynthetic intermediates, premarineosin A (177) and 16-ketopremarineosin A (178), isolated from a mutant strain of S. venezuelae, was observed. Accordingly, the IC50 values of 175, 177, and 178 against P. falciparum (strains D6, Dd2, and 7G8) were detected at the nanomolar range between 0.6 and 84 ng/ml, being comparable or even more potent than those of the positive control chloroquine. Notably, the most active compound, premarineosin A (177), demonstrated high SIs (347 and 2779) against chloroquine-resistant P. falciparum strains Dd2 and 7G8, respectively. The remarkable antimalarial activity of this fascinating group of secondary metabolites inspired extensive medicinal chemistry and SAR studies. Accordingly, Kancharla and coworkers screened a library of B-ring functionalized prodiginins and 94 new synthesized tambjamine derivatives [97]. Naturally occurring tambjamines are found almost exclusively in marine invertebrates (i.e., nudibranchs, bryozoans, and ascidians), and their structures resemble those of prodigiosins, bearing an enamine moiety instead of a pyrrole moiety (ring C) as in the latter [98]. This study revealed that the bipyrrole scaffold of tambjamines has improved bioactivity profiles with regard to in vitro/in vivo antimalarial efficacy and selectivity. In particular, the analogue KAR425 (179) was shown to be an excellent antimalarial lead, being active against the multidrug-resistant strains Dd2 and 7G8 with IC50 values of 16 and 18 ng/ml, respectively, while possessing significantly lower cytotoxicity toward HepG2 cells (IC50 = 5711 ng/ml; SI = 348 and 321, respectively). Moreover, in a subsequent in vivo study, 179 exhibited 100% protection of mice infected with Plasmodium yoelii until day 28 when administered orally during 4 days at doses of 25 and 50 mg/kg or after a single-administration dose of 80 mg/kg, whereas no signs of toxic effects were observed. It is also worth noting that the proposed synthesis of KAR425 (179) includes the use of inexpensive and accessible precursors, such as cycloheptanamine, and does not involve challenging chemical reactions [97]. Thus, tambjamines and prodiginines have proven to be privileged scaffolds for library design and for development of novel antimalarial agents.",

This unusual derivative was isolated from Salinispora sp., obtained from a marine sediment sample, collected near Keawekaheka Bay, Hawaii, at a depth of 15 m. Salinipostin A (180) exhibited potent activity against the chloroquine-resistant W2 strain of P. falciparum with an EC50 value of 0.024 ng/ml, demonstrating a remarkable selectivity index (SI > 1000). Furthermore, a series of related derivatives salinipostins B\u2013K (181\u2013190) were isolated during chemical investigation of Salinispora sp., which allowed to explore the structure-activity relationships of this new intriguing class of antimalarials. The chemical structures of 180\u2013190 were unambiguously elucidated by detailed MS/MS as well as by 1D and 2D NMR analysis, including 31P NMR, and their absolute configuration was deduced by means of VCD. Evaluation of the antimalarial activity of 180\u2013190, which share a common bicyclic phosphotriester motif, revealed a broad range of EC50 values between 0.024 (for 180) and 21.4 \u03bcg/ml (for 189), hinting at the important impact of the side chains (R1 and R2) on the antiparasitic effect of these compounds. Accordingly, derivatives with longer vinyl and/or branched R1 chains as well as with a pentadecyl moiety at R2, such as salinipostins A, F, and I (180, 185, and 188, respectively), showed significantly higher activity than the rest of the analogues. Interestingly, none of the compounds displayed cytotoxicity toward mammalian HEK293T cells, indicating their high selectivity against P. falciparum. Further biological studies on P. falciparum revealed that morphological and developmental changes in the parasite culture, caused by the treatment with the most potent compound salinipostin A (180), differ from those that appear as a result of the treatment with chloroquine, suggesting a novel mode of action for 180. Moreover, growth stage specificity of 180 was evaluated with the respective wash in/wash out experiments that indicated early stages of the parasite life cycle, especially the ring stage, to be the most sensitive ones. A further attempt to generate resistant parasite populations toward 180 failed, thus suggesting that this compound is less susceptible to drug-resistance development than other currently available antimalarial drugs, possibly by targeting fundamental processes in Plasmodium growth [99].",

Among them, eudistidine C (1:1 mixture of 218a and 218b) represents a highly complex alkaloid, bearing fused pyrimidine and imidazole rings, a guanidine, as well as amidine moieties. The proton-deficient nucleus of eudistidine C was unambiguously assigned with the help of a new sensitive NMR pulse sequence LR-HSQMBC (long-range heteronuclear single-quantum multiple-bond correlation ), allowing the detection of 4\nJ\nCH and 5\nJ\nCH correlations [114]. Total synthesis of eudistidine C confirmed the structure of this alkaloid, and a series of aryl-substituted (at C-10) derivatives were obtained. Eudistidine C epimers (218a and 218b), eudistidine B (219), and their synthetic congeners (220\u2013224) exhibited significant antiparasitic activity against chloroquine-sensitive D6 and chloroquine-resistant W2 P. falciparum strains with IC50 values in the range from 0.26 to 3.4 \u03bcg/ml [113]. The antimalarial potency of these compounds was investigated employing a plasmodial lactate dehydrogenase activity assay with artemisinin and chloroquine as positive controls. Interestingly, 218a showed an up to 1.7-fold stronger antimalarial activity toward both P. falciparum strains in comparison with its epimer 218b. Among the tested compounds, 219 and its synthetic derivative 224 exhibited the most potent antiplasmodial effect against D6 and W2 strains with MIC values of 0.46 and 0.36 \u03bcg/ml (for 219) and 0.48 and 0.26 \u03bcg/ml (for 224), respectively. Moreover, a subsequent cytotoxicity assay against Vero cells (monkey kidney fibroblasts) revealed no apparent activity for 218a,b\u2013224, suggesting their selective antimalarial activity. Additionally, compounds 218b, 220, 221, and 224 were found to inhibit the binding of the oncogenic transcription factor HIF-1\u03b1 (hypoxia-inducible factor 1) to p300 [113]. Thus, eudistidines C (218a,b) and B (219), as well as their synthetic analogues, carrying the tetracyclic eudistidine-like scaffold, represent a novel class of lead structures for the development of potent and selective antimalarial agents.",

In recent years, the emergence of resistant microbial strains against virtually all major classes of known anti-infectives poses a worldwide health threat, and thus further mining of natural sources for novel anti-infective agents is eminent [116]. Marine macro- and microorganisms have not been systematically investigated as a source of novel anti-infective agents, despite the fact that more than three-quarters of the Earth\u2019s surface is covered by the seas and oceans. Nevertheless, continued interest in the quest for structurally unprecedented bioactive secondary metabolites in combination with recent advances in sampling techniques has opened new avenues for the exploration of this fascinating ecological niche [7, 117]. Indeed, over the last decade, increased marine bioprospecting efforts were observed, particularly aimed at the deep-sea environment, providing novel leads [118]. As a matter of fact, the potent proteasome inhibitor salinosporamide A, from the marine sediment actinomycete , has recently entered phase I clinical trials as an anticancer agent [119]. Undoubtedly, the marine environment represents an untapped source of bioactive chemical entities, many of which featuring new carbon frameworks without any terrestrial counterparts. This structural richness may give rise to potential scaffolds for the exploration of new biological targets, thus offering the advantage of the discovery of anti-infective leads with novel mechanisms of action tackling the global challenge posed by antibiotic resistance [120]. Several metabolites from various marine sources (i.e., sponges, bacteria, and fungi), described in this review, have already been identified as lead structures against both drug-sensitive and drug-resistant pathogens, such as the antiviral spiromastilactones (130 and 131), the antibacterial anthracimycin (22), or the antimalarial thiaplakortones (198\u2013201) and salinipostins (180\u2013190) possessing activities at (sub)micromolar concentrations [20, 33, 99, 105]. Hence, given the enormous potential of marine natural products in drug development, as demonstrated by the success stories of several marketed marine-derived drugs (i.e., Halaven\u00ae, Adcertis\u00ae, Yondelis\u00ae), it becomes increasingly apparent that the oceans hold great promises as the next source of novel anti-infective agents.",
