However, despite their widespread distribution and significance, most people have never heard of Mabs or how they have both transformed healthcare and spawned an entire new industry. Produced in the laboratory, Mabs are derived from the billions of tiny antibodies made every day by our immune systems to combat substances, known as antigens, which are regarded as foreign or potentially dangerous. Millions of different types of antibodies can be found in the blood of humans and other mammals. Made by white blood cells known as B lymphocytes, each antibody is highly specific\u2014that is, it has the ability to bind to only one particular antigen, which may be derived from bacteria, viruses, fungi, parasites, pollen, or nonliving substances, such as toxins, chemicals, drugs, or foreign particles considered alien to the body. Once antibodies have marked their antigen, they and other types of cells produced by the immune system can attack it. The field of genetically engineered therapeutic Mabs has relied on many inventions during decades of research, but two key discoveries in the mid-1970s stand out as seminal events that laid the groundwork for this field to exist as we know it today. Although Mabs were first described in 1975 (Kohler and Milstein, 1975), only when the original rodents forms were replaced by their human equivalents did their potential as therapeutic agents began to be properly appreciated (Lonberg, 2005, Winter et al., 1994). The reasons for this are complex, but related to a combination of perceptions including patentability, immunogenicity, effector function, and a wish to avoid undesirable side effects.",

It was developed by IDEC, and it has since merged with Biogen. Rituximab is a Mab against the protein CD20, which is primarily found on the surface of immune system B cells. Rituximab destroys B cells and is therefore used to treat diseases that are characterized by excessive numbers of B cells, overactive B cells, or dysfunctional B cells. This includes many lymphomas, leukemias, transplant rejection, and autoimmune disorders. IDEC teamed up with Genentech to get FDA approval and to comarket Rituxan. In parallel, Genentech developed Herceptin (Trastuzumab) for the treatment of breast cancer associated with the HER2/neu receptor. Herceptin was approved by the FDA in 1998 and is the first important example of personalized medicine requiring a diagnostic test to ensure efficacy, since only patients who express the Her2 gene in their breast cancer tissue have a chance to benefit from treatment with this Mab.",

High-scale production of Mabs at the industrial level could further be achieved. This has sparked a race for the development of antibody-mediated therapeutics in the clinic with the investment of large amounts of money from the biopharmaceutical sector toward that end, which is already paying off. The major success of human Mabs in immune and inflammatory conditions, such as rheumatoid arthritis (RA), Crohn\u2019s disease, ulcerative colitis, spondyloarthropathies, juvenile arthritis, psoriasis, psoriatic arthritis, and others (Andreakos et al., 2002), marks merely the beginning of a rapidly evolving field with more than 150 diverse Mabs currently being evaluated in clinical trials or being candidates for approval by the FDA in the USA.",

Most cell lines in the 1980s yielded only half a gram of Mabs per liter, so production was time consuming and expensive. The ideal was to develop a hybrid cell line that could produce between 5 and 10 g of Mabs per liter. This demanded several steps, and even more, each requiring skill and patience. First was the creation of a hybrid cell, after which a clone secreting Mabs in high concentrations had to be selected. Then a culture medium had to be developed to encourage the optimal growth of the hybridoma. Scaling up such media was not easy in terms of quality control because they contained fifty or more ingredients, and it was important to determine how many nutrients to add. Hybridomas stop secreting Mabs, for example, if given too much glucose.",

Aggregation is driven by the minimization of free energy achieved when antibodies come into close contact\u2014for instance, at relatively hydrophobic sites on the molecules. Dimerization may be thought of as the first step in aggregation, and sometimes the process proceeds no further. Dimers maybe reversible (Moore et al., 1999) or not, but growth can lead to larger and larger oligomers and even potentially insoluble particulates, as time progresses (Wang et al., 2006). Because ADCs are decorated with one or more small molecule drug moieties, they have a different set of biophysical properties compared with the unconjugated antibody, leading to new or altered intermolecular interactions. An antibody that exhibits acceptable aggregation behavior in its unconjugated form may have different physical behavior in its conjugated form, either because of changes in surface properties, such as hydrophobicity due to drug attachment or because the drugs have altered the higher-order structure of the antibody such that new modes of antibody\u2013antibody interactions are possible.

Such a study does not automatically reveal the exact cause of the effect, only that it is related to the conjugated form or conjugation process. The degree to which the molecule has been physically altered by conjugation may be assessed by techniques such as differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) (Wakankar et al., 2010), with physical perturbations manifested as changes (likely decreases) in the onset of melting or melting temperature, Tm, of the conjugated Mab as compared to the unconjugated antibody. This decrease in thermodynamic stability may translate to a decreased colloidal stability of the conjugate compared to an unconjugated antibody.",

For instance, if the unconjugated antibody is susceptible to deamidation or isomerization with known pH dependence, this degradation mode is also likely to be present in the ADC. These types of degradations may impact the product potency, especially if the affected residues are found in the complementarity-determining region. Much has been learned through years of experience with unconjugated antibodies about the susceptibility of various amino acid residues to chemical degradations, allowing substantial insights to be gained from examination of the protein primary sequence alone, coupled to available information about local solvent exposure and flexibility (Kosky et al., 2009, Robinson and Robinson, 2001). It may be expected that most chemical modifications to the primary sequence of the unconjugated antibody will also occur in the ADC form. Fragmentation is another possible chemical degradation pathway for ADCs, driven by the breakage of covalent bonds between chains or within the peptide backbone. The altered physical state of the molecule following addition of the small molecule drug may result in some differences in the susceptibility of the ADC to fragmentation, but the fundamental susceptibility of the ADC to fragmentation is likely derived mostly from the Mab. A common unconjugated antibody degradation mode involves breaking the heavy chain peptide near the hinge region, leading to free Fab and Fab + Fc products (Cordoba et al., 2005). This is still a feasible degradation pathway for ADCs as well. Comparison of fragmentation rates between conjugated and unconjugated antibodies can reveal whether the ADC form has different stability toward fragmentation.",

They are designed to possess unique physicochemical properties, aiming to improve the pharmacokinetic and biodistribution of a drug molecule (Li and Huang, 2008) and to deliver a significant amount of drug molecules. Examples of some therapeutic nanocarriers are lipid-based particles (Al-Jamal and Kostarelos, 2011), micelles (Kedar et al., 2010), nanoparticles (Shi et al., 2010), dendrimers (Svenson, 2009), and polymersomes (Levine et al., 2008). Some of these have been proposed for the treatment of various diseases including cancer (Dhar et al., 2011), coronary artery diseases (Chan et al., 2011), and rheumatoid arthritis (Thomas et al., 2011). In the particular case of cancer, the unique anatomy\u2014that is, the leakiness of the tumoral vasculatures\u2014concedes a passive transport of the nanocarriers by enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect (Maeda et al., 2003). However, the porosity of the tumor blood vessels may vary with the tumor type (Bae, 2009). Even with a successful delivery by the EPR effect, the nanocarriers must be able to internalize into the cancer cells (Gradishar et al., 2005). A new paradigm in drug delivery embroils a combination of active and passive targeting. Targeting ligands, such as antibodies (Mamot et al., 2005), peptides (Srinivasan et al., 2009), small molecules (Kukowska-Latallo et al., 2005), or aptamers (Farokhzad et al., 2006) can be attached onto the surface of a nanocarrier. The carriers recognize and bind to the cell-surface receptors and are subsequently taken by the cells via receptor-mediated endocytosis for releasing the therapeutic payloads (Shi et al., 2011). The binding affinity of targeted nanocarriers can also be increased several orders of magnitude by the multivalent effect (Wang et al., 2010).",

Nanotechnology in the field of cancer has the potential to improve the monitoring of therapeutic efficacy, provide novel methods for the detection and profiling of cancers at early stages, and allow surgeons to delineate tumor margins and sentinel lymph nodes. Nanomaterials have unique features that are attractive and can be applied to biosensing. The development of various nanomaterials and nanotechnology has enabled detection of cancer biomarkers with great precision and sensitivity that could not be achieved before. Many studies are being conducted on developing sensing mechanisms that will push down the detection limit as far down as possible (Anajwala et al., 2010). Ligand-free nano-formulations generally possess passive targeting property with little tissue specificity. To address these limitations, research has been continued to advance active or specific targeting to enhance the efficacy of anticancer therapeutic agents, as well as to reduce the toxicity to nontargeted healthy tissues. Nanoparticles containing the chemotherapeutic agents are specifically designed to target the cancerous cells either by ligand receptor interaction or antibody-antigen recognition. Highly specific Mabs are used to strengthen the immune response and to intensify the immune system\u2019s antitumor capacity. Moreover, Mabs are highly specific when attached to nanoparticles to aid in targeted delivery of various antitumor cytotoxic agents or function themselves as effective therapeutic agents (Sutradhar and Amin, 2014). There are different ways of destroying cancer cells with Mabs: directly by inducing apoptosis, blocking growth factor receptors or inducing the formation of antiidiotype, and indirectly by activating complement-mediated cellular cytotoxicity and antibody dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (Praetorius and Mandal, 2007).",

In addition, they reported well tolerability for maximum tolerated dose, as well as reduced systemic toxicity when modified nanoparticles were administered to mice model compared to control (Chen et al., 2008, Gao et al., 2009).",

However, delivery to the posterior segment via this route is considered inef\ufb01cient and unsuccessful, since less than 5% of the topically applied dose enters the eye and an even smaller fraction of it (0.001%) is expected to reach the posterior segment. Intravitreal administration involves the direct administration of drug solution/suspension into vitreous humor via pars plana using a 30-G needle. In contrast to the topical and systemic routes, intravitreal injection makes high concentrations of drug locally available to the internal eye tissue, including the choroid and the retina. Similarly, the intravitreal administration of Macugen (pegaptanib sodium; P\ufb01zer) and Lucentis (ranibizumab; Genentech/Novartis), vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) inhibitors, is highly successful for the control of AMD. However, agents with molecular weight less than 500 Da when applied intravitreally tend to be drained off from the site of application with a half-life of less than 3 days, indicating a need for repetitive injections. Anyway, the period requiring a repeat dose may extend from a few days to several months for macromolecular antibodies. For example, three is the mean number of injections of bevacizumab (Avastin; Roche) required to be administered per year for the treatment of AMD. On the other hand, the recommended dosing frequency of ranibizumab (Lucentis) is once a month (0.5 mg; 50 \u03bcL) for at least 9 months (Rosenfeld et al., 2006), whereas pegaptanib sodium (Macugen) needs to be injected intravitreally at 6-week intervals for 1 year (Kitagawa and Yuzawa, 2013).",

Mabs are also more effective at preventing infection rather than treating established ones, and unlike vaccines provide only short-term prophylaxis.

The advantage of Mabs is that they can be given as maintenance therapies. This is reshaping our perceptions of some cancers from what was once seen as inevitably fatal to a chronic condition.
