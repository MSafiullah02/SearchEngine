Here, the magnitude of the spreading of infection is determined not solely by the infectiousness of the pathogen but also by the structure of the contact network. In particular, a major factor is the distribution of each node's 'degree,' which is the number of nodes linked to it. If all nodes have the same degree and the links between nodes are random, there exists a threshold value in 'transmissibility,' the probability that an infected node transmits the infection to a susceptible node in contact, less than which an outbreak immediately extinguishes as an endemic [1] . On the other hand, if there are a significant number of high-degree nodes, or hubs, such nodes can become super-spreaders, and allow an outbreak even under weak transmissibility. In fact, in scale-free networks, which only have a power decrease in the number of high-degree nodes, there remains a marginal number of stationary infected nodes under SIS model (nodes transit between susceptible and infected), even for pathogens of infinitely small transmissibility [2] . This phenomenon is typically observed as computer virus infections in the Internet.",

The epidemic mentioned above under SIS model in scale-free networks cannot be stopped by preventive mass vaccination of randomly selected nodes even of a large proportion, but can be halted by prioritized vaccination of hub nodes [5, 6] . However, for vaccination in case of infectious diseases in human, the latter hub vaccination is difficult to implement, because the contact network is not apparent and potential hubs are not evident. On the other hand, among post-outbreak vaccination strategies, the one important in practice is the ring vaccination, in which the susceptible individuals in contact with an infected individual are vaccinated. Yet, there has been no study evaluating the effectiveness of ring vaccination or its combination with preventive mass vaccination, the two practical containment strategies. Moreover, for the study of infectious diseases in human a modeling more realistic than the SIS is necessary.",

Compensating the vulnerability of scale-free networks to weak transmissibility, vaccination worked much effectively for such networks compared to the exponential and constant networks. We simulated for various ratio u of randomly selected nodes preventively vaccinated (mass preventive vaccination) and ratio v of susceptible status nodes in contact with an infected node to be vaccinated (ring vaccination). In exponential or constant networks, the transmissibility necessary to cause emergence of epidmic was enlarged by the factor of 1/[(1-u)\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7(1-v)] compared to the case without vaccination (Table 1) . This can be explained as vaccinations decreasing the number of (susceptible) nodes around an infected node approximately by the factor of (1-u)\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7 (1-v) . In scale-free networks, on the other hand, the transmissibility necessary for epidemic was observed to increase by a much larger factor of 16 u+v (Table 1) . For example, a pathogen of transmissibility T=0.018 could emerge an epidemic under no vaccination, whereas the value arose to T=0.123 under u+v=0.5. Table 1 . Transmissibility T and basic reproductive number R 0 causing emergence of epidemic for various contact networks Finally, we evaluated how the choice of initially infected node affects epidemics. An infection transmits faster when a high-degree node is infected initially (say by hub targeted attack). However, even in the extreme case when the largest-degree node was initially infected, the transmissibility causing epidemic emergence became smaller only by the factor of 0.56 for scale-free network and 0.66 for the exponential, compared to the case when an initially infected node was selected randomly (Table 1 ).",

Horizontal axis indicates the transmissibility T, and vertical axis indicates the final number of removed nodes. Data points for the scale-free network are diamonds connected by lines, those for the exponential network are stars connected by sparsely dashed lines, and those for the constant network are squares connected by densely dashed lines. Standard deviation of five experiments is indicated by a vertical error bar centered at the mean point. The transmissibility (interpolated in log scale) for which 100 nodes are removed was defined as the epidemic emerging transmissbility, and the values for the three networks are indicated by arrowed vertical lines of the same type as those connecting data points",
