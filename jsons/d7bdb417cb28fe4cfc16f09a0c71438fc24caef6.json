The micro-array techno logy is described into detail in Chapter 15. Briefly, by hybridization of the fluorescently-labelled \"target\" mRNA (sample) to the oligonucleotide pro be sequences spotted on the array, the mRNA in a samp le can be quantified by means of fluorescence intensity, which is proportional to the abun dance of the target sequence in the samp le. A limitation of the micro -array technology is the fact that it is by nature a biased approach.

These small sequences of nucleotides can effectively use to identify the original mRNA transcript. The gene tags are linked together, sequenced and nu mb ered to deduce the quantitative expression of th e or iginal mRN A expression in a sample. The first step of SAGE is extraction of the mRNA from a sample to be studied for its mRNA transcription levels (Fig. 1) . The mRNA will be transcribed by the enzyme reverse transcriptase into cDNA (copyDNA) , which is much more stable than mRNA. The total of the transcribed mRNA of a sample (e.g. tumour biopsy) is referred to as cDNA library as it comprises all transcribed sequences of a sample. Next, short sequence fragments (\"tags\") of26-28 basepairs are cleaved from the cDNA strands by restriction endonuclease enzymes cutting the cDNA at defined nucleotide motifs. The cut cDNA fragment s are amplified by PCR and subsequently linked to each other to form one long string of \"tags\" (called \"concatemer\"), This chain of tags is then introduced into a vector to be cloned.",

Mass-spectrometry is an analytical technique based on measuring the mass-to-charge ratio of molecules. Biological samples often comprise a complex mixture of proteins requiring fractionation before analysis by mass spectroscopy. For this purpose, proteins are separated by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (2DE) by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) after enzymatic digestion. Such fractionated peptides are then assessed by mass-spectrometry such as MALDI-TOF (matrix-assisted laser desorption-ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry). A laser beam passes through the sample to be analysed and causes vaporization and ionization of the sample. Ionized molecules fly upward into a tube. \"Time of flight\" through the tube correlates directly to mass: with lighter molecules having a shorter time of flight than heavier ones. Mass-spectrometry is used for qualitative and quantitative analysis of proteins.",

This technique was first designed to study protein-protein interaction in yeast (therefore \"yeast\" two-hybrid). In essence, it is based on the activation of a downstream reporter gene upon binding of a transcription factor to an upstream activating sequence. By splitting the transcription factor into a DNA binding domain and an activating domain, the interaction of a protein coupled to the activating domain (\"prey\") and a protein coupled to the DNA binding domain (\"bait\") brings the two fragments of the transcription factor in close proximity resulting in transcriptional activation of the reporter gene.

            "text": "Mammalian cells are protected by their cell membrane from potential environmental risks such as foreign DNA. Inorder to surmount the lipid bilayer and facilitating the uptake of DNA into the host cell a number of different transfection methods are available in molecular biology. The \"classical\" approach of transfection is based on a transient increase in the permeability of the cell membrane. Calcium phosphate forms precipitates with DNA, which are then taken-up by cells. Cationic lipids and polymers bind the negatively charged DNA and cellular uptake is mediated by fusion of the complex with the cell membrane or endocytosis, respectively.The most efficient and reliable approach for transfection of mammalian cells is by the use viral vectors. Formally, the transfer of DNA into mammalian cells by use of viral vectors is referred to as \"transduction\" in contrast to the chemical based methods mentioned above. Viral mediated transduction strategies consist of a recombinant viral vector/plasmid with the inserted gene of interest, which is transduced into a complementing packaging cell line to produce infectious virions (= extracellular virus particle) . The virions are harvested and employed to transduce the target cells. The resembling of the naturally way of virus infection leads to high yields with near to 100% of transduced target cells. Whereas adenovirus based system result in transient transduction of cells, retro-and lentiviral systems are integrated into the DNA of the target cells leading to stable expression of the insert in dividing mammalian target cells. For transduction of non-dividing and other cells not easily to transfect, lentiviral systems are considered to be the most promising vectors for. To avoid any uncontrolled virus spread viral transduction systems typically employ only replication incompetent viruses lacking essential genes necessary for generation of structural proteins. Still, the conduct of viral transfection experiments requires biosafety level II laboratory facilities. Given the considerable advantages of viral transfection systems they have become the standard for target validation studies in vitro.",

            "text": "A point of criticism inherent to any target overexpression strategy for validation experiments arise about the question whether a target gene overexpressed in a mammalian cell line properly reflects the biological function of the endogenously expressed gene. Overexpression of a transgene might overwrite the fine-tuned balance of intracellular signalling leading to a phenotype aberrant from the one caused by expression of the endogenous target gene. Not only, but also for this reason the reverse strategy of target downregulation is often employed for target validation. By targeted suppression of the gene of interest the resulting phenotype can be attributed to the gene's biological function .For in vitroexperiments, the most versatile tool for target silencing is given by RNA interference.RNA  interference is a naturally existing cellular mechanism of post transcriptional gene silencing. Mello and Fire published in 1998 that gene specific silencing may be achieved by double-stranded RNA complementary to the sequence of the target gene leading to degradation of the target mRNA by induction of an endogenous RNA induced silencing complex (RISC; for details see Chapter 20). Degradation of the target mRNA deprives the cell of the template for its protein translation machinery. Thus, RNA interference allows gene specific silencing of virtually any gene of interest. For target validation in vitro, the RNA interference mechanism may be induced by two different technical approaches. siRNA (= small or short interfering RNA) are short double-stranded RNA fragments, which are introduced intracellular by transfection. Transfection of a cell with siRNA leads to activation of the RISC and subsequent target-mRNA degradation. siRNA experiments are easy to perform straight forward experiments for target validation, but they result only in transient downregulation of target mRNA.",
