In the susceptible-infected model on heterogeneous networks, the cluster of infected nodes in the intermediate-time regime exhibits too large fluctuation in size to use its mean size as a representative value. The cluster size follows quite a broad distribution, which is shown to be derived from the variation of the cluster size with the time when a hub node was first infected. On the contrary, the distribution of the time taken to infect a given number of nodes is well concentrated at its mean, suggesting the mean infection time is a better measure. We show that the mean infection time can be evaluated by using the scaling behaviors of the boundary area of the infected cluster and use it to find a nonexponential but algebraic spreading phase in the intermediate stage on strongly heterogeneous networks. Such slow spreading originates in only small-degree nodes left susceptible, while most hub nodes are already infected in the early exponential-spreading stage. Our results offer a way to detour around large statistical fluctuations and quantify reliably the temporal pattern of spread under structural heterogeneity.",

In reality, taking quick action before reaching the stationary state is necessary to control, e.g., the spread of a life-threatening virus or the word about marketed products. Despite such importance, theoretical understanding of the nonstationary state is far from complete. This is partly because of the time variation of relevant variables and having neither small nor large order parameters in the intermediate-time regime, defying analytic approaches based on approximations which are valid in the early-or late-time regime. Moreover, the speed of epidemic spreading shows a large statistical fluctuation, presumably due to the heterogeneity of the infection seed's degree and the stochasticity of infection trajectories [11, 12] . As we will address here, the epidemic size at a given time suffers from such a large fluctuation that it is disqualified from being a reliable measure, particularly in the intermediate stage of spreading. Therefore, a new reliable measure and its theory * deoksun.lee@inha.ac.kr are required to predict and control efficiently disease and information spreading in real-world complex systems.",

We study the simplest model, the susceptible-infected (SI) model, to investigate thoroughly the statistical fluctuations appearing in the temporal pattern of spreading and provide the theory for an alternative reliable measure. To quantify fluctuation, the distribution of the number of infected nodes I at a given time t is measured, which turns out to be so broad that the mean I t loses its representativeness in the intermediate-time regime on heterogeneous networks. We show analytically that the asymptotic behavior of the distribution is derived from the dependence of the epidemic size I on the time when a hub, defined here as a node with a degree larger than 30% of the maximum degree, is first infected. In contrast, the distribution of the time t taken to infect a given number I of nodes is well concentrated at its mean. This suggests that the mean infection time t I can be a measure for the reliable description of the spreading phenomena. We construct a theory to evaluate the mean infection time, which leads us to discover, for strongly heterogeneous networks, the algebraic relation between t I and I in the intermediate stage contrasted with the well-known exponential spreading in the early stage. The origin of the algebraic-spreading phase is investigated, which helps us understand the temporal complexity derived from the structural heterogeneity in various complex systems.",

In simulations, we use the uncorrelated configuration model [17] to construct the SF networks, in which each node is assigned k link stubs with degree k selected as described below such that its distribution takes a prescribed power-law form, and then those stubs are randomly paired until no single or pair of stubs is left. Finally, an unpaired stub, multiple links, and self-loops are removed, the numbers of which are negligible in all the considered cases. For given N, L, and \u03b3 , the degree k i of node i is given by the integer part of a real-valued random number r from a distribution p(r) = p 1 r \u2212\u03b3 for r 0 < r < \u221a N + 1, with p 1 being a normalization constant and r 0 determined such that the resultant mean degree k = N \u22121 i k i is equal to 2L/N [18] . The degree cannot be larger than \u221a N, a constraint imposed to remove the degree-degree correlation of neighboring nodes, and actually, the maximum degree k max behaves as k max \u221a N for 2 < \u03b3 < 3 and k max \u223c N 1 \u03b3 \u22121 [17] . In the SI model, the state x i of node i is either susceptible (x i = 0) or infected (x i = 1). A susceptible node becomes infected with rate \u03bb by each of its infected neighbors, while the transition from infected to susceptible is disallowed. We run the simulation of the SI model by asynchronous updating [19] as follows. (i) At the initial stage (t = 0), a randomly selected node is infected. (ii) At each time t, we count the number B of links having a susceptible node at one end and an infected node at the other end. And we select randomly one such link and infect the susceptible node with probability \u03bb. This is repeated B times to move to the next time step t + 1. (iii) Repeat step (ii) until all the nodes are infected.",

Hubs are abundant in SF networks, and their infection should play a role in speeding up or slowing down spreading [11] . As seen in Figs. 3(a) and 3(b), the cluster of the first 80 infected nodes in the fastest spreading has many hub nodes infected very early, while that from the slowest spreading has only smalldegree nodes infected early and hub nodes infected late. This suggests that whether and when hubs are infected determine the growth of the infected cluster. To check this, we measure the hub-infection time t hub , the earliest time when any hub is infected. Using different criteria for hubs does not change the results qualitatively. When I is plotted as a function of t \u2212 t hub [ Fig. 3 (c)], its statistical fluctuation is significantly reduced in comparison to the large fluctuation for given t shown in Fig. 1 . Moreover, I grows abruptly for 0 t \u2212 t hub , with being a constant. For example, 5000 for \u03b3 = 2.75 and N = 10 6 . This demonstrates that the global spreading can occur when hubs are infected. The number of infected nodes at time t satisfies the relation",

In SF networks with \u03b3 = 2.75 and N = 10 6 , the mean number of infected nodes at a given time I t is a good measure only in the early-time regime, t 500, or in the late-time regime, t 20 000. In the intermediate-time regime, 500 t 20 000, the standard deviation \u03c3 I;t is not smaller than the mean I t . On the other hand, the mean infection time t I is well defined as long as I 3. One can see a broad region in the (t, I ) plane where only the mean infection time t I is well defined in Fig. 5(c) .",

To see whether this difference remains significant in the limit N \u2192 \u221e, we plot the ratio of I t to the value of I at which t I = t versus t for SF networks and Erd\u0151s-R\u00e9nyi (ER) networks in Figs. 6(a)-6(c). We find that the ratio is significantly larger than 1 in the range 0.1 t/t c 2, where t c = t I c is the mean time to infect I c nodes with I c in Eq. (9). In Fig. 6(d) , the largest value of the ratio is shown to increase quickly with N in SF networks with \u03b3 = 2.75, contrary to a relatively weak or no increase in weakly heterogeneous networks. Therefore, the difference in the two approaches relying on I t and t I cannot be neglected for strongly heterogeneous networks. ",

(8) may diverge with the smaller of the maximum degrees k max and the cutoffk(I ) if the degree exponent \u03b3 is smaller than 3. If \u03b3 > 3, the contribution of the summand for large k is negligible and so is the effect of the exponential term in the whole sum, allowing us to approximate Eq. (8) aswith k = k kP degree (k). If 2 < \u03b3 < 3, the slow decay of the summand for large k causes the divergence of the numerator. From Eq. (8), we findwhere we used the Euler-Maclaurin formula and the incomplete gamma function (s, z) \u2261 \u221e z dk k s\u22121 e \u2212k . The values of k nn (I ) evaluated with Eq. (E2) and by using the numerical degree distribution in Eq. (8) are in good agreement. The incomplete gamma function is expanded as [29] (s, z)which leads us to find, for 2 < \u03b3 < 3 in the limitk(I ), k max \u2192 \u221e, the small-and large-k(I ) behaviors of k nn (I ), given byNoting that k nn for 2 < \u03b3 < 3 is evaluated as ",
