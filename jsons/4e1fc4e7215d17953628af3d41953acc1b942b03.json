ROC analysis was performed to calculate the diagnostic sensitivity (true positive) and specificity (true negative) of the assay. At a standard screening dilution of 1:400, the sensitivity of the S ELISA remained at 89% or greater at ODs <0.51 ( Figure 1C) . Specificity increased to 89% at an OD of 0.09 and 100% at 0.39 ( Figure 1C ). At serum dilutions of 1:800 and 1:1600, the S ELISA remains highly specific, but loses sensitivity at higher ODs as can be expected (Figures 1D and 1E) . and N, at lower ODs, the S ELISA is more specific, while the N ELISA retains higher sensitivity across a large range of ODs. These data are not consistent with one publication examining serial blood draws from a single MERS-CoV patient has suggested their S ELISA is more sensitive than an N ELISA. 15 We have observed significant patient-to-patient differences in the quality and quantity of polyclonal antibody responses, and these conflicting data may be simply explained by human variation in immune response.",

For all sera with ODs above assay cutoff, they will be diluted serially, fourfold from 1:100-1:6400 and used for endpoint titer determinations. Sera that are positive for either N or S or both N and S (titers at 1:400, 1:1600, or 1:6400), will be tested via microneutralization with live MERS-CoV along with 10% of negative sera. We will define positive MERS-CoV serology as positive in two of three assays tested, N ELISA, S ELISA, and microneutralization or positive by microneutralization alone with microneutralization activity as confirmed positive.",

The donor identity was held only by Emory University Transfusion Services and was not released to the CDC in accordance with both institutions approved IRB protocols. The samples used in these studies were de-identified and analyzed anonymously. Serum from a confirmed MERS-CoV patient was used as a positive control for all of our assays. The positive control serum was collected from the first imported case of MERS-CoV into the United States during the case investigation, with a neutralizing reciprocal endpoint titer of 320. 10 The panel of nine serum from patients with MERS-CoV neutralizing antibodies were collected during a 2015 outbreak investigation and during a follow-up investigation from a 2012 MERS-CoV outbreak in Jordan. 11 Specimens were prepared by the Jordan Central Public Health Laboratory (Amman, Jordan) and shipped to the CDC for testing.

A serum from a MERS-positive control serum had a final reciprocal endpoint titer of 1:1600 consistent with high neutralizing antibody titers detected by microneutralization assay (Figure 2A). All sera from humans with a history of other coronavirus infections and normal human sera had reciprocal endpoint titers of less than 100, with 400 and above considered positive. The same set of sera was also tested in Western blot analysis. Purified recombinant MERS-CoV N protein (50 kDa), negative control lysate (pET control), and purified ectodomain of MERS-CoV S protein (157 kDa) were run on SDS-PAGE gels and transferred to membranes. Sera from patients with OC43 and HKU1 faintly detected MERS-CoV N protein (Figure 2B). Sera from patients with 229E, OC43, and HKU1 also faintly detected MERS-CoV S protein. More cross reactivity was seen between SARS serum and MERS-CoV S protein (Figure 2B). Serum from the MERS-CoV patient strongly detected both MERS-CoV N and S as expected. These results suggest that while there is some weak cross reactivities between both MERS-CoV N and S proteins and sera from patients who had a history of other coronavirus infections, the S cross reactivities are not strong enough to result in a positive signal by ELISA. While there have been studies suggesting there may be some cross reactivity between SARS patients sera and MERS-CoV, our study is limited by the availability of only one patient serum. 14 In this study, we have validated an S ELISA using recombinant baculovirus-produced MERS-CoV S ectodomain. We are opting to retain both N and S ELISAs during our MERS-CoV serological screening process. We believe that MERS-CoV N and S ELISAS are complementary for several reasons.
