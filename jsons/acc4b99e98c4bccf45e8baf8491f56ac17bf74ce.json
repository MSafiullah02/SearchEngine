Scientific studies to date have focused primarily on describing the clinical course of patients, identifying treatment options and developing vaccines. In Germany, as in many other regions, current tests for SARS-CoV2 are not being conducted on a representative basis and in a longitudinal design. Furthermore, knowledge about the immune status of the population is lacking. Yet these data are needed to understand the dynamics of the pandemic and to thus appropriately design and evaluate interventions. For this purpose, we recently started a prospective population-based cohort in Munich, Germany, with the aim to better understand the state and dynamics of the pandemic.",

In the absence of vaccinations and specific treatment options, public health interventions were initiated in Germany, similarly to numerous other countries comparably affected. The measures include isolation of confirmed patients, quarantine of their contacts, use of personal protective equipment, social distancing (including school closures), and closure of borders (6, 14) . Prediction models and experiences from countries like South Korea suggest that combination of these measures could be effective in combatting the disease (13, (15) (16) (17) (18) . However, past evidence from other epidemics was not that convincing with respect to controlling virus spread by social distancing (19) . It remains unclear how comparable previous viral disease outbreaks are to SARS-CoV-2 (20). While potentially saving lives and protecting healthcare systems from breakdown, one has to bear in mind that measures of social distancing can have a devastating impact on national and global economies, .

This is partly due to the unknown number of asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 carriers, and thus the number of undetected cases (4, 7, 13, 17, 24, 25) . In addition, the number of confirmed cases depends on access to healthcare, laboratory availability and on the applied criteria for who should be tested. Therefore, the basic and the effective reproduction number can only be very roughly estimated and the hospitalization and mortality rates remain to be confirmed. Community cohorts can help to assess the overall spread of infection in the community and thus provide more reliable estimates of the basic and the effective reproduction number. This will help to evaluate the burden on the healthcare system as well as the effectiveness of public health interventions (26) .",

Low response might affect representativeness of the study population, which in turn might have an effect on the generalizability of the prevalence of positive antibody results to the Munich source population. However, it is unlikely that participation will depend on seropositivity of antibody results as antibody status is unknown prior to inclusion in the study. In addition, the research topic is of uppermost interest for many citizens in the current situation, therefore response is expected to be higher in KoCo19 than in other studies. During the first recruitment days, an overall response of close to 50% was reached providing some evidence for this hypothesis. Response will be increased by revisiting households which did not open the door at the first visit. For the associations under study, representativeness is of less concern (37). However, we might not be able to reach high response especially in specific groups of the target population, e.g. subjects with migration background as they are generally harder to reach in epidemiologic studies (38) and because time constraints do not permit to provide study documents in other languages than German at the initiation of the study. Likewise, the spread of SARS-CoV-2 varies locally and depends on several factors, such as the time course of the infection in the respective region, the population density and age distribution of the population, the available capacities and the countermeasures taken.
