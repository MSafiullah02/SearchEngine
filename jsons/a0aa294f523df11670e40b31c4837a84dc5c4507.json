Since pandemic outbreaks are relatively infrequent, there is a dearth of evidence addressing the following questions: (i) Have the resources invested in strategic and routine communication for past pandemic outbreaks yielded public health preparedness benefits? (ii) Have past efforts sensitized people to pay attention to new pandemic threats? The Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) that was followed closely by major media outlets in the USA provides an opportunity to examine the relationship between exposure to public communication about epidemics and public awareness and knowledge about new risks. Methods In December, 2013, we surveyed a nationally representative sample of 627 American adults and examined the associations between people's awareness to prior pandemics and their awareness of and knowledge about MERS.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Abstract"}, {"text": "Results Awareness of prior pandemics was significantly associated with awareness and knowledge of MERS.

All of these factors coalesce and intertwine with the diverse social and individual characteristics of the audience when developing emergency risk communication strategy. 1 -5 The need for effective communication plans that enable coherent, credible and timely communication and community engagement during public health emergencies is increasingly being seen as integral to emergency response and planning. 6, 7 One area where emergency response and planning is key is with large-scale disease outbreaks. Over the last decade, there has been a succession of large-scale outbreaks of influenza, including the SARS, Avian Flu (H5N1), new bird flu (H7N9) and H1N1 pandemics. These outbreaks raised fears among both scientists and laypeople that an emerging influenza outbreak could repeat the devastation of the Spanish flu of 1918. Governments and public health agencies recognize the importance of emergency risk communication and have invested significant resources in the development and implementation of public health and communication responses to these outbreaks. The stakes of conducting emergency risk communication are even higher during the early stages of an outbreak, as a treatment and/or vaccine is unlikely to be available for at least several weeks or months after the start of a pandemic. Emergency risk communication, such as raising awareness of the disease and promoting health prevention behaviors like hand washing, social distancing and cautioning vigilance among others, plays a vital role in controlling disease transmission. 2, 6, 7 One key importance is to study the association between social and individual factors and communication inequalities-differences among people from different socioeconomic positions (SEPs), racial, ethnic and geographical backgrounds, to understand how individuals access, interpret and act on messages they have received 1,5,8 -13 and to identify the best ways to quickly and effectively reach diverse populations with important preventive information. For example, low SEP individuals have been found to have lower levels of awareness and knowledge regarding pandemics, leading to poorer behavioral responses when dealing with an outbreak. 2,14 -17 However, as pandemic outbreaks are relatively infrequent, there has been a lack of evidence assessing whether the efforts and resources invested in the strategic risk communication during past pandemic outbreaks yielded public health benefits that improved preparedness. Gaining an understanding of whether or not the messages emphasized during the response to previous pandemics helped the public, particularly members of low SEP populations, become more aware and better prepared is invaluable. Therefore, the question that remains to be answered is: Does an awareness of past epidemic risk communication help people become more health aware of an emerging epidemic, or, on the contrary, have the past few pandemic communication experiences created a 'boy cries wolf ' effect, making people less attentive to information provided concerning pandemic outbreaks? 18, 19 In late 2012, the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS), a viral illness caused by a coronavirus, was first reported in Saudi Arabia. Although this particular virus had a very low probability of impacting the USA, major media outlets followed it closely, providing the American general public with an opportunity to become familiar with the outbreak. In this study, we assessed people's awareness of previous pandemic outbreaks and how that awareness affected their awareness and knowledge of MERS. We identified other predictors of MERS awareness and knowledge and investigated the information sources from which people who had heard of MERS first learned about it. We also identified a subgroup of people who had have not heard of most or all risk communication messages regarding five pandemics (i.e. SARS, Avian Flu (H5N1), new bird flu (H7N9), H1N1, and MERS) which have erupted in the past decade.
