            "text": "In order to address the significance of the PCs in proS processing, we cloned the S gene in a pIRES2-EGFP bicistronic vector and added a V5-tag at its C-terminus for immunological detection (pIR-proS-V5; Fig. 1A). Addition of such an epitope in C-terminal was reported not to interfere with the SARS-CoV spike glycoprotein mediated fusion [18]. We first obtained furin-deficient FD11 cells [19] stably expressing either the vector alone or one of the PCs of the constitutive secretory pathway, namely: furin, PC5A, PC5B, PC7, and PACE4. A functional proprotein convertase activity assay showed that these enzymes induced complete processing of pro-platelet derived growth factor-A (proPDGF-A) [20] into PDGF-A (not shown). The expression and processing of the spike protein was analyzed by transient transfection of the cDNA encoding S, followed by Western blotting using a V5 reactive monoclonal antibody. In absence of overexpressed convertase (vector) we observed the presence of a \u223c190 kDa and a \u223c210 kDa proteins (Fig. 1B, lane 2). Endoglycosidase treatment indicated that the \u223c190 kDa protein was endoH sensitive, possibly of an endoplasmic reticulum (ER) form, and the \u223c210 kDa protein was endoH resistant, likely representing a Golgi-modified form (not shown). A very small amount of non-glycosylated proS was also detected (\u223c150 kDa). In addition to the ER and Golgi forms, we also observed two V5-immunoreactive C-terminal fragments (CTFs): a \u223c110 kDa protein and a very small amount of a \u223c80 kDa protein (Fig. 1B, lane 2). Interestingly, the level of the \u223c80 kDa CTF was enhanced by overexpression of the membrane-bound furin or PC7, and least by PC5B (Fig. 1B, lanes 3, 5, and 6), but not by the soluble PC5A or PACE4 (lanes 4 and 7), nor by a soluble form of furin lacking the transmembrane domain (not shown). We also noticed that whenever processing took place, the level of the \u223c210 kDa proS was significantly reduced. This agrees with the known zymogen activation of furin, PC7, and PC5B in the trans Golgi network (TGN). The \u223c110 kDa product was least affected by the overexpression of the PCs. The enhancement in the appearance of the \u223c80 kDa CTF in membrane-bound PC-overexpressing cells suggests that the spike protein of SARS-CoV is a potential substrate for PC-dependent cleavage. It remains to be seen whether the cleavage is a result of direct action of the PCs or indirect via the activation by PCs of other cellular proteases to effect the generation of the \u223c80 kDa CTF.",

Sixteen hours post-infection, the cells were pulse-labeled with [35S]cysteine for 30 min and the cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with the spike reactive polyclonal antibody HMAF. In the vector co-expressing cells, a \u223c190 kDa protein was visualized together with significant amounts of \u223c110 and \u223c80 kDa proteins, and low levels of \u223c150 and \u223c125 kDa proteins (Fig. 1C, vector lane). Interestingly, the levels of the \u223c110 and \u223c80 kDa products were significantly increased upon overexpression of furin, PC7, and PC5B (Fig. 1C, lanes 5\u20137), the same convertases that enhanced the production of the \u223c80 kDa CTF from recombinant proS (Fig. 1B). The \u223c125 kDa product, which was not observed in the V5 antibody experiments (Fig. 1B), might represent an N-terminal S1 fragment, only seen with the HMAF antibody. Thus, apart from the \u223c125 kDa protein, the SDS\u2013polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS\u2013PAGE) profile of SARS-CoV infected cells closely resembled that observed with the recombinant proS in furin-expressing FD11 cells (Fig. 1B). The low levels of the processed proteins precluded microsequencing analysis, and hence the N-terminal sequences of the cleavage products could not be determined.",

We observed a correlation between the efficiency of processing with both the extent of CPE (Table 1) and titer of the virus recovered from the media (Fig. 2A). Accordingly, PC7, furin, and PC5B released more viruses resulting in more extensive CPE than either vector alone or PC5A expressing Vero E6 cells. Although the increase in virus titer is modest (\u223c2- to 3-fold), it concurs with the notion that PC-mediated processing of the spike protein enhances virus release.",

This type of PC-inhibitor has been widely used to block glycoprotein processing and infectivity of several viruses including HIV-1 [11], respiratory syncytial virus [21], and MHV [8]. Thus, Vero E6 cells were infected with SARS-CoV for 1 h without inhibitor; the inoculums were then changed with fresh media supplemented with 60 \u03bcM dec-RVKR-cmk and incubated for 15\u201324 h. Microscopic examination of the cell monolayer indicated that the infected cells showed extensive CPE, while virtually no CPE was observed with the dec-RVKR-cmk treated cells (left panels in Fig. 3\n). This demonstrates that the extracellularly added PC-inhibitor abrogated the CPE caused by SARS-CoV infection. In an attempt to gain more insight into the infection process, we performed immunofluorescence of dec-RVKR-cmk treated and untreated infected cells (right panels in Fig. 3). Infected cells showed extensive antigen staining while dec-RVKR-cmk treated cells showed a modest number of cells infected with greatly reduced spreading evident throughout the intact monolayer. The concentration dependence of the dec-RVKR-cmk effect revealed that at 60 \u03bcM the viral titer was reduced by a factor of \u223c100 (Fig. 2B) and that the CPE was abolished (Table 1). These results strongly suggested the possibility that the inhibitor dec-RVKR-cmk blocks a PC-mediated processing step required for extensive virus spread and ensuing CPE.",

Accordingly, we incubated infected Vero E6 cells in the presence of increasing doses of this inhibitor for 1 h, and then pulse-labeled the cells for 30 min, followed by immunoprecipitation of the lysates with the HMAF antibody (Fig. 4\nA). The data revealed a dose-dependent inhibition of the formation of the \u223c80 kDa CTF (\u223c86% inhibition at 60 \u03bcM; Fig. 4B) and at most only a \u223c40% effect on the \u223c110 kDa CTF (Fig. 4B). This suggests that the dec-RVKR-cmk exerts a dominant inhibitory effect on the generation of the \u223c80 kDa CTF. In addition, it may also exert a partial, possibly non-specific, inhibitory effect on the enzymes generating the \u223c100\u2013110 kDa CTF. Such dominant inhibitory effect of dec-RVKR-cmk has been previously reported for \u03b2-secretase [22] and Adamalysins (ADAMs) [10]. Since viral titer and CPE were maximally reduced at 60 \u03bcM dec-RVKR-cmk (Fig. 2, Fig. 4B, and Table 1), we propose that the inhibition of the \u223c80 kDa CTF production best correlates with these observations.",

These complexes were only observed in SARS-CoV infected cells, but not in cells transfected with recombinant proS, possibly due to the different heating and gel conditions used. Indeed, similar large molecular weight proteins were recently observed by Song et al. [23] that disappear upon boiling at 100 \u00b0C, a similar temperature used in our transfection experiments. In contrast, our protein analysis involving SARS-CoV infection was performed using NuPAGE gel system which requires heating of the samples at 70 \u00b0C for 10 min. Size exclusion chromatography suggested that the \u223c570 kDa complex likely represents a homotrimer of proS [23]. In the media of infected Vero E6 cells, S-containing complexes were largely dominant over proS (Fig. 4C), and no processed products were detected. This raises the possibility that either budding virions selectively incorporated proS or that proS-cleavage products are tightly bound to the high molecular weight complexes. It should be noted that no accumulation of processed spike glycoproteins was observed upon chase periods. However, incubation with dec-RVKR-cmk increased the cellular level of the Golgi-modified \u223c210 kDa proS form in parallel with the inhibition of its cleavage (Fig. 4C). Taken together, our data demonstrate that dec-RVKR-cmk exerts a dose-dependent inhibitory effect on the generation of \u223c80 kDa CTF with a concomitant increase in the levels of the Golgi-modified proS form, clearly demonstrating an alteration in the SARS-CoV spike biosynthesis.",

While the mutant K672A did not abrogate processing, the R667A variant diminished the formation of the \u223c80 kDa product (Fig. 5\nA). These data suggest that while Lys672 is not critical for the generation of the \u223c110 or \u223c80 kDa CTF-products, Arg667 influences the level of the \u223c80 kDa product, possibly via a conformational effect. Since all the mutations tested around the potential sites A and B (Fig. 5A) did not block the processing and in some cases resulted in major retention in the ER (R761A) (not shown), we are unable to precisely map by mutagenesis the processing sites. However, to better define if the generation of the \u223c110 kDa CTF results from the a processing around site A, we tried to enhance proS processing at the potential site A through replacement of the SLLR667 sequence (Fig. 1A) by a furin-favored RRKR667 motif [9]. Compared to control (WT), furin caused a drastic reduction of this mutant \u223c210 kDa Golgi form at the expense of an enhanced \u223c105\u2013110 kDa protein, without significantly increasing the levels of the \u223c80 kDa product (Fig. 5B). Based on the mobility in SDS\u2013PAGE, we suggest that the \u223c110 kDa CTF is produced by processing of proS at a site close to the aligned cleavage sites in other coronaviruses (site A; Fig. 1A), and that the \u223c80 kDa CTF is generated by cleavage at a site downstream from Arg667 by either PC-like enzymes or proteinases activated by PCs. The presence of the RNTR\n761 and PTKR\n797 motifs within the S-protein suggested that one of them might represent the sought PC-like cleavage site responsible for the generation of the \u223c80 kDa CTF. However, neither of the mutants R758A (P4 mutant), R761K or R761Q (P1 mutants), or the double mutant R758A + R761K (P1 + P4 mutant), nor the R797A (P1 mutant; data not shown) eliminated the \u223c80 kDa CTF (Fig. 5A). This suggests that none of them are candidate PC-sites, or that another compensating enzyme(s) could cleave these mutagenized sites, as reported for Ebola virus [24].",

Site B encompassing peptide (QS1; Abz-E-Q-D-R-N-T-R\n761\n \u2193 E-V-F-A-Q-3-nitrotyrosine amide; Abz = 2 amino benzoic acid) was incubated with purified furin in the presence or absence of inhibitors (EDTA and dec-RVKR-cmk) and analyzed by RP-HPLC. The RP-HPLC chromatogram of the furin digestion showed the disappearance of the QS1 peptide (retention time: R\nt\n = 34.3 min, Fig. 6\nA, UV panel) and the appearance of two cleavage products (R\nt\n = 19.4 and 31.2 min). In contrast, when EDTA and dec-RVKR-cmk (CMK) were added to the peptide digestions, such a cleavage was prevented as expected. Detection using the fluorescence channel indicated the appearance of the N terminal cleaved product eluting at 19.6 min. To confirm the identity of the location of the peptide bond cleavage, we analyzed the collected peptides by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry. Mass spectral data showed that the RNTR\n761 containing peptide was indeed cleaved by furin C-terminal to R761 (Fig. 6B). In contrast, the PTKR\n797 (QS2) and SLLR\n667 (QS3) containing peptides were not cleaved at all (not shown). This may be rationalized by molecular modeling of S, whereby the RNTR\n761 sequence is in turn sandwiched between two \u03b1-helices, while the PTKR\n797 is itself within an \u03b1-helix [25], a secondary structure that usually does not favor cleavage [26]. Although the above in vitro data suggested that furin is able to process a peptide encompassing the RNTR\n761 site, and the inhibitor dec-RVKR-cmk reduced the generation of the \u223c80 kDa, ex vivo processing was not affected by mutations around this sequence (Fig. 5A). We conclude that it is likely that the \u223c80 kDa CTF is generated indirectly by a PC-activated enzyme.",

Although other investigators reported the lack of proS processing [27], [28], [29], [30], this report and others [31], [32] detected CTFs by transient transfection of recombinant spike glycoprotein. The inconsistency between these observations may perhaps be due to the recombinant virus expression systems chosen, levels of expression, and the antibodies used. Pulse labeling analysis of infected Vero E6 lysates with a commercially available S-specific antibody and with sera of convalescent patients (not shown) also detected proS processing products. In Vero E6 cells or Vero E6 cells expressing the empty vector alone, the levels of the \u223c80 kDa product were very modest (less than 10% of proS). This would mean that the processing is very inefficient, but that possibly such low level of cleavage may be sufficient to support virus assembly and spread. On the other hand, in cells overexpressing membrane-bound PCs (furin, PC7, and PC5B), we observed an enhancement of CPE and viral titers, indicating a positive correlation between those parameters and the increased appearance of the \u223c80 kDa protein. Interestingly, a soluble form of furin lacking its transmembrane domain was not able to mediate the processing to the \u223c80 kDa protein (not shown). The significance of proS cleavage in SARS-CoV infection was further emphasized by the complete abrogation of CPE with a PC specific inhibitor (dec-RVKR-cmk) (Table 1).",

            "text": "Even though no basic-amino acid stretch aligned with the S-sequences of group II coronaviruses, at least one of the cleavages of the SARS-CoV proS is likely to occur within or close to aa 667, as demonstrated by the enhancement of the \u223c110 kDa CTF production with the RRKR667 mutant. The enzyme responsible for this cleavage appears to be active early in the secretory pathway, since the fungal metabolite brefeldin A [33] does not affect its activity (not shown). It is possible that the cognate protease could be related to the one responsible for the early cleavage of the Crimean Congo Hemorrhagic fever Gc glycoprotein [34]. Moreover, peptides encompassing this region were not cleaved in vitro by furin, supporting the conclusion that furin does not directly generate the \u223c110 kDa CTF. In contrast, the generation of the \u223c80 kDa CTF was sensitive to dec-RVKR-cmk in a dose-dependent manner. Additionally, based on in vitro and ex vivo data, furin or membrane-bound PCs are likely to process proS into a \u223c80 kDa CTF. Whether the proS cleavage is effected directly by the PCs or indirectly by PCs activating another cellular protease remains to be elucidated. The fact that the fluorogenic peptide containing RNTR761 is efficiently cleaved by furin and the cleavage is inhibited by EDTA or dec-RVKR-cmk raised the possibility for a direct role for PCs in proS processing. If that was true, then our extensive mutagenesis analyses should have enabled us to identify the potential processing site(s). Since none of the mutations of the candidate cleavage sites have resulted in the lack of processing, we suggest that the role played by PCs is indirect. In the case of Nipah virus, the F0 protein is cleaved ubiquitously into F1 and F2, and here also none of the mutations of potential cleavage sites were able to inhibit the processing [35]. The authors concluded that Nipah virus fusion protein is processed by a ubiquitous protease which is different from the PCs since it does not require the presence of basic residues at the cleavage site. It is possible that SARS-CoV spike protein is processed by similar proteases, which may require PCs for activation.",

This result raised the possibility that the kinetics of SARS-CoV syncytia formation or cell to cell spread is affected by proS processing. Furthermore, a recent report demonstrated the significance of dec-RVKR-cmk in the prevention of murine hepatitis coronavirus (MHV) spike protein processing and the subsequent effect on cell\u2013cell fusion and not virus\u2013cell fusion as supported by dec-RVKR-cmk treatment [8]. Similarly, in our experiments, dec-RVKR-cmk directly or indirectly reduced the appearance of the \u223c80 kDa protein, which in turn may have resulted in the abrogation of the cytopathicity associated with virus spread. The concentration of dec-RVKR-cmk used in these experiments did not result in microscopically identifiable toxicity effects to the cells and is well below the concentration used in other reports. Future studies should address if the replication of virus was affected by dec-RVKR-cmk. Taken together, our work strongly suggests that proS processing and viral spread are interconnected, and that processed proS may be required for direct cell\u2013cell spread and/or for CPE initiation resulting in enhanced secretion of mature virions [4].",

Inhibition of the PCs may represent an alternative strategy beneficial to patients infected with SARS-CoV, as already suggested for other infectious pathogens requiring host cell PC-processing of their surface proteins [10]. A PC-inhibitor could possibly be used along with vaccination [37] and/or in conjunction with interferon treatment [13] or with the novel compounds targeting the SARS-CoV proteins recently reported [38]. In view of the widespread implication of the PCs in the processing of various surface glycoproteins of infectious viruses, development of a small molecule inhibitor of the convertases is urgently needed, as its usefulness may also extend to too many emerging deadly infectious agents.",
