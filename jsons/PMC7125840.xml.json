            "text": "In recent years, poor air quality [1,2], rapid spread of epidemics [3], and non-biodegradable polymers [4] have become the most serious environmental problems worldwide. The air-borne fine particulate pollutants, such as fine particulate matter (PM2.5), and various pathogens (such as avian influenza), may cause respiratory infections or illness [5]. The non-biodegradable polymers have caused serious environmental impacts. The conventional protective textiles composed of micron-sized fibers, such as cotton fibers, are incapable of filtering fine particulate pollutants such as PM2.5, owing to their relatively large pore size. It also doesn't possess the ability to filter various pathogenic particles. Thanks to the emergence of simple and effective sub-micron fiber fabricating technique - electrospinning [6], the development of electro-spun protective textiles has attracted a lot of interest from researchers. Many polymer materials, such as polyimide (PI) [7], polyurethane (PU) [8], polyacrylonitrile (PAN) [9], polyamide-66 (PA-66) [10], and some other polymers have been successfully fabricated as nanofibrous membranes for filtration. However, these polymers are pure synthetic fibers which are difficult to biodegrade after use which can cause the serious environmental problem. Therefore, the challenge is critical urgent to fabricate a protective fabric which has better filterability to effectively barrier to particulate pollutants and pathogenic particles, and has good biodegradability to avoid generation of non-degradable contaminants after use. In this work, we are committed to developing a biodegradable protective fabric with good filterability and good strength that can be used to protect individuals effectively from particulate pollutants and pathogenic particles.",

One form of regenerated silk fibroin is a microfiber which has been the research hotspot since nanotechnology emerged [23,24]. However, the spinnability of regenerated silk fibroin is poor. The introduction of polymers is an effective way to improve the spinnability of regenerated silk fibroin. Poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) with excellent biocompatibility and biodegradability has been widely used to form electrospun microfibers and is applied to FDA-approved biomaterials. Therefore, the PLGA was chosen to improve the spinnability of the regenerated silk fibroin.",

Graphene oxide (GO) is a single layer of carbon atoms having functional hydroxyl, epoxide, diol, and carbonyl groups [[29], [30], [31]]. These functional groups endow some unique properties to graphene oxide, such as excellent hydrophilicity, dispersibility and biocompatibility [[32], [33], [34]]. GO with a higher specific surface area and abundant functional groups has wide applications in cell adhesion, reinforcing material and antibacterial activity [35,36].

The pore size distribution (PSD) curve of the composite was retrieved with the Barrette-Joynere-Halenda (BJH) model by using the desorption branch.

By adding the GO component to the SF/PLGA, the ultimate stress increases significantly to 3.71 MPa, an increase of 53%. Young's modulus increases to 158.66 MPa. This trend is common for composites which contain nanoscale reinforcing components with good dispersion and form strong interfacial interactions [53,54]. The stress-strain curves of SF/PLGA mat and SF/PLGA/GO mat are shown in Fig. 6\n. Both of SF/PLGA and SF/PLGA/GO mats are destroyed by breaking all the microfibers at one point, leading to a brittle failure of the strong interaction between fibers [55]. It is noted that the elongation of SF/PLGA/GO mat is lower than that of SF/PLGA mat. It is partly because of the addition of GO and forming a strong interaction with SF [56].
