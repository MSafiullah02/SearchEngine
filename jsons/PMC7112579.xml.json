A number of authors propose approaches to disease control [10], [14], [15], [16]. However, application of interventions in free-ranging predators has not resulted in long-term successes and disease threats continue to challenge management of endangered and rare species [10].

Do large protected areas remote from domestic animal reservoirs provide large carnivore species protection from exposure to important pathogens? Is infection always linked to high levels of mortality as has been seen in predators in the Serengeti [19] and Mara ecosystem [3], [20] in East Africa? In light of our exploration of these questions, we then provide recommendations for disease control in free-ranging wildlife with specific attention to their application to predator conservation in southern Africa.",

Likewise, canine rotavirus belongs to the group A rotavirus and canine antibody against RV will react to group specific antigens of bovine group A rotaviruses in an IFA test and thus the type A strain of rotavirus of goat origin isolated in South Africa (V Da Costa Mendes, Medial University of Southern Africa) was used as the target antigen for this test. CPV-2 test antigens were obtained from field strains isolated from clinically ill domestic dogs and cats in South Africa (M. van Vuuran, University of Pretoria).
