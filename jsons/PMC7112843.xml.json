Upon this outbreak, a worldwide collaboration network was coordinated by WHO. As a result of this extraordinary endeavor, in March 2003, SARS-CoV, a novel type of coronavirus, was identified as the etiologic agent of SARS [1]. The genomic sequence of SARS-CoV was completed and it was found that SARS-CoV has all the features and characteristics of other coronaviruses (groups I\u2013III), but it is quite unique from them, representing a new group (group IV) [2], [3]. SARS-CoV is believed to be a mutant coronavirus transmitted from a wild animal that developed the ability to productively infect humans [2], [4].",

However, the N protein is distributed predominantly in the cytoplasm of SARS-CoV-infected and N gene-transfected cells [13]. The SARS-CoV N protein is a highly charged, basic protein that can self-associate to form dimmers [14]. The three-dimensional structure of the N-terminal portion of the protein shares similarity with that of other RNA-binding proteins. The coronavirus N protein is thought to participate in the replication and transcription of viral RNA and to interfere with cell-cycle processes of host cells. As a result, it plays a critical role in SARS CoV pathogenesis [14], [15], [16], [17]. In addition, the N proteins of many coronaviruses are highly immunogenic and expressed abundantly (90%) during infection [18]. High levels of IgG antibodies against N have been detected in sera from SARS patients [19]. The N protein can induce protective immunity or at least set up the protective response in some coronaviruses [20]. It is reported that N protein is a representative antigen for the T-cell response in vaccine setting [21], induces SARS-specific T-cell proliferation and cytotoxic T-cell activity and induces virus-specific cellular responses in human cells using mouse model [21], [22].",

SARS-CoV N protein expression was induced in transformed competent cells by adding 1 mM IPTG (Invitrogen, USA) for 4 h. The expressed N protein, containing a small hexahistidine tag at the C terminus, was subsequently purified by using the His Bind\u00ae purification kits (Novagen) through Ni-IDA resin column and confirmed by SDS-PAGE using 12% polyacrylamide gels followed by western blotting using mouse anti-SARS N protein monoclonal antibody (1:1,000 dilution, Zymed, USA) and horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (1:500 dilution, Zymed, USA) as a primary and secondary antibody, respectively. Purified proteins were then analyzed with pooled sera of convalescence phase of SARS patients as a positive control and healthy volunteers as a negative control.",

This finding that N protein induces a strong IgA response parallels the findings by Tripp et al. [27] that monoclonal antibodies against N protein are present in the mucosal epithelia, as detected by immunohistochemistry on autopsy samples. These locations include the alveolar epithelium, trachea/bronchus, esophagus, gastric parietal cells and the intestinal tract. Strong immunoreactivity towards N protein suggests that the protein may be released from the virus or from infected cells into the circulation during infection. Alternatively, it may be presented by antigen presenting cells (APCs) for cytolysis of target cells. N protein does not appear to undergo rapid mutation like S protein. Coupled with the fact that S protein is more difficult to express, N protein could be a better target for the development of serological assays.",

Using cDNA from full-length N protein expressed in E. coli, fragments were probed with SARS patients\u2019 sera in a study by Chen et al. [28]. Four regions with possible epitopes were identified: amino acids 51\u201371 (EP1), 134\u2013208 (EP2), 249\u2013273 (EP3) and 349\u2013422 (EP4).

We have shown that DNA vaccination can successfully elicit SARS-CoV N-specific humoral and CD8+ T-cell responses in vaccinated mice.

DNA vaccines in larger animals are still not totally effective due to significant restrictions with the recent technologies. Many characteristics still remain to be considered prior to the development of a DNA vaccine against SARS-CoV in humans. In our present report, we have illustrated that the presented SARS N DNA vaccine expressing plasmid induces specific immune responses in mouse. However, we did not run tests to check the protective effect with challenge SARS-CoV.
