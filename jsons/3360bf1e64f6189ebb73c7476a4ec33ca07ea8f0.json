The validity of this conclusion has been demonstrated by another study with a microarray analysis. Expression of mRNAs in cells infected with influenza virus in the presence of lectin PFL, where the virus invasion was prohibited, was compared with that in cells infected with influenza virus in the absence of the lectin, where the virus can invade and propagate in the host cells. Expression levels of 410 genes, which were chosen with keyword \"virus infection\" in Entrez data bank (provided by Keyword Gene Analysis in data mining light (Aligent Technology, CA, USA)), were analyzed in the microarray analysis. Among these 410 genes, 19 genes were found to be expressed differently by 4 times between the infected cells and (Table 1) . It was indicated that the expression levels of 13 genes were decreased and those of 6 genes were increased in the presence of PFL compared with that in the absence of PFL.

As an antiviral drug with a novel mode of action, carbohydrate-binding agents (CBAs) that show specificity for high-mannose glycan, especially, cyanobacterium-and alga-derived lectins: CV-N and GRFT have been actively investigated for drugs targeting the initial entry stage of HIV infection. The CV-N and GRFT have been shown to inhibit in vivo transmission of HIV when used as a topical microbicide that can be applied vaginally or rectally, and they have generated interest as a promising new generation of microbicides characterized by specific and potent activity (Tsai et al., 2004; O'Keefe et al., 2009; Kouokam et al., 2011) . It is possible that treatment with these bacteria-derived lectins may trigger undesirable side effects or immunogenicity including secretion of inflammatory cytokines and activation of host T-cells. In fact, the treatment with PFL disturbed various cellular responses such as proliferation or autophagy. The change of expression in many genes was detected to a varying degree (Sato et al., 2016) . However, the GRFT treatment induces only minimal changes in secretion of inflammatory cytokines and chemokines. The GRFT exhibits superior safety profile for use as a tropical microbicide (O'Keefe et al., 2009; Kouokam et al., 2011) . For antiviral drug of influenza virus, zanamivir and oseltamivir are useful worldwide and have proven clinically effective. But the resistant strains of influenza virus can arise rapidly in the presence of the agents (Gubareva et al., 2000; McKimm-Breschkin, 2000) . They target on the NA protein of influenza virus. The CBAs binding high-mannose glycan, including PFL, PML, and PTL, as well as CV-N and griffithsin, target on the HA protein. These lectins are apparently promising anti-influenza drugs with different modes of action. The virus itself does not control the structure of the specific oligosaccharides added to those sites of virus proteins . It was reported that a relatively long timeperiod of drug exposure was required to afford marked phenotypic resistance against the CBA (Bolmstedt et al., 2001; Balzarini 2007; Fran\u00e7 ois and Balzarini, 2012) .
