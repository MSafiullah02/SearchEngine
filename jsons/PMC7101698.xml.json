            "text": "Adrenal insufficiency (AI) is an entity that results from inadequate basal or stress levels of plasma cortisol. Sepsis, surgery, bleeding, and trauma among other etiologies can cause AI [1\u20134]. Critically ill or injured patients are at increased risk for the development of relative adrenal insufficiency (RAI). Because of comorbid conditions that may mimic or obscure the diagnosis, it is important to make the diagnosis promptly since it is potentially life-threatening and even fatal if unrecognized or untreated. RAI is underrecognized and underdiagnosed because current diagnostic approaches are not sensitive enough to detect it, and if left untreated, RAI is associated with up to 100% mortality [1, 2]. Overall incidence of RAI in critically ill patients has been cited to be as high as 28% [5]. Incidence in patients with septic shock is 60% and can be as high as 95% [1].",

However, this description does not provide us with a standard definition of RAI. Many different tests have been developed for the diagnosis of AI, but the cosyntropin stimulation test has emerged as the preferred test to evaluate patients with AI [2]. In an optimal setting, adrenal function is measured using the cosyntropin stimulation test in which a standard dose of 250 \u03bcg of the synthetic analog of adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) is given and adrenal response is measured after 30 or 60 min or both. A poststimulation serum cortisol level of 18\u201320 \u03bcg/dl or a change in cortisol >9 \u03bcg/dl is considered a response and excludes the diagnosis of AI [2\u20134, 7]. However, this test is an expensive and time-consuming process that costs approximately $500. The test can also take up to 4 h to obtain the results. The cosyntropin test was originally established in nonstressed patients, most of whom had tuberculosis.",

Despite this variable incidence recorded in the literature, RAI remains underrecognized and has emerged as a contributing factor to morbidity and mortality during critical illness.

            "text": "Activation of the HPA axis in response to internal or external stress leads to an increased secretion of corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) and arginine vasopressin from the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus. CRH then stimulates the anterior pituitary to release ACTH. This induces an increased secretion of cortisol from the zona fasciculata of the adrenal cortex [11\u201316]. Cholesterol is the principal precursor for steroid biosynthesis. In a series of sequential enzymatic steps, cholesterol is converted to pregnenolone and then to the end products of adrenal biosynthesis, which includes cortisol [11]. Prolonged elevation of serum cortisol, however, triggers a negative feedback inhibition loop that subsequently results in decreased secretion of both ACTH and cortisol [5]. Cortisol, a glucocorticoid, is an essential multifunctional stress response hormone that has anti-inflammatory, immunosuppressive, catabolic, metabolic, and vasoactive properties on peripheral vessels and cardiac muscles. From an anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive perspective, cortisol decreases the accumulation and function of immune and inflammatory cells like macrophages, natural killer cells, mast cells, and eosinophils at inflammatory sites as a consequence of the activity of cytokines and other inflammatory mediators [10]. A metabolic property of cortisol entails elevation of blood glucose levels by increasing the rate of hepatic gluconeogenesis and inhibition of adipose tissue glucose uptake, thereby facilitating glucose delivery to cells during stress, both acute and chronic. Corticol also stimulates adipose tissue to release free fatty acids and proteins to release amino acids, hence supplying needed energy and substrate for cells to adequately respond to injury or stress [10].",

Hypotension refractory to fluids and requiring vasopressors is the most common feature of acute RAI. Without these presenting symptoms, it becomes difficult to determine which patients arriving in the critical care unit in shock and sepsis should be tested and treated for RAI by using the classic signs alone. A simple quick screening test would provide a way to select a set of patients at high risk of RAI.",

This is well supported in the literature as an adequate cortisol response to critical illness [1, 2, 5, 9, 10, 16\u201320]. Schein et al. [18] reported a mean cortisol level of 50.7 \u03bcg/dl (range = 5.6\u2013400 \u03bcg/dl) in 37 patients with septic shock and only 8% of those patients had a cortisol level <25 \u03bcg/dl. Chernow et al. [19] reported a mean cortisol level of 32 \u03bcg/dl an hour after the moderate stress of cholecystectomy and a level of 52 \u03bcg/dl an hour after the severe stress of subtotal colectomy. In the study by Rothwell et al. [20], the mean cortisol level was 27 \u03bcg/dl in patients admitted to the critical care unit who had cortisol levels drawn on admission and who had survived. In stressed patients in the critical care setting, a random cortisol level of >25 \u03bcg/dl [10] should be considered an adequate response to stress. This is why we defined RAI as a random serum cortisol concentration <25 \u03bcg/dl rather than using the cosyntropin stimulation test with its cutoff cortisol value of 18\u201320 \u03bcg/dl, which does not adequately test stressed patients in the critical care setting. The choice of 18\u201320 \u03bcg/dl is based primarily on the response to exogenous high-dose ACTH stimulation and the response to insulin-induced hypoglycemia in nonstressed non-critically ill patients [10]. It therefore should not be used in the diagnosis of RAI.",
