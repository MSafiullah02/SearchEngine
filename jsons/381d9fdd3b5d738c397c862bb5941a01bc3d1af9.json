This test has been successfully used and evaluated by many authors for MERS-CoV detection in camels. 11, 16, 17 Results have shown that a high number (85%) of dromedary camels from the different farms of Tabuk Riyadh and screened by ELISA test showed that 74% of the animals were found to have antibodies to MERS-CoV. 7 In the same study, 264 archived serum samples collected from dromedary camels from 1992 to 2010 in Riyadh and Kharj were also analyzed by ELISA and showed a high seroprevalence (92%) of MERS-CoV neutralizing antibodies. 7 Our data agree also with previous studies reporting wide antibody prevalence in camels in many countries, including Egypt and Oman. 12, 19 In another study conducted in Oman, all serum samples from 50 dromedary camels were positive for MERS-CoV specific antibodies. 12 Similar results were also reached from a larger study conducted in United Arab Emirates (UAE), where 500 dromedary camels' sera screened in 2013 revealed 96% seropositivity. 18 In Africa, an outbreak investigating serum samples for MERS-CoV assessment in camels has also shown similar results in Nigeria (94%), Tunisia (48.5%), and Ethiopia (96.3%). 20 Likewise, in a study conducted on 189 archived camel sera samples collected in 1997 from Egypt and between 1983 and 1984 from Sudan and Somalia, 81% were found to have neutralizing antibodies to MERS-CoV. 16 Similar results were also obtained in a study from Kenya. 17 While camels in the Middle East and Africa were highly exposed to MERS-CoV infection, camels from Europe and Australia which are geographically isolated were not exposed to the virus. 12 However, serum samples collected from 105 dromedary camels living in the archipelago of Canary Islands, between 2012 and 2013 showed that 14% have antibodies against MERS-CoV. 12 In another study carried out in the same islands, 170 dromedary camel sera were analyzed and only 4.1% were seropositive for MERS-CoV. Data showed that all the seropositive dromedary camels for MERS-CoV were all imported from Africa. In addition, 307 dromedary camels' sera collected from different regions between 2013 and 2014 in the Islands were all tested negative for specific MERS-CoV antibodies. 21 All these findings indicate that active MERS-CoV infection did not occur in the Canary Islands. 22 The same author explained the increase of the seropositivity in adult camels by the age range of the animals which were exposed for long time to the virus infection. 24 For young camels, specific MERS-CoV antibodies could be acquired from their mothers as it was reported by Kamber 25 who suggests that maternal IgG antibodies in camels are acquired through the colostrum intake during the first 24 h post-parturition and not via the trans-placental route. After 24 h, antibody levels in the dam's milk decrease rapidly, and IgG levels in serum cease to rise. 25 We also suggest that maternal antibodies might not have been sufficient to mediate protective immunity for them. Animals would then be exposed to new MERS-CoV infection and specific antibodies would consequently increase in 1-2 years after, which can explain the higher seroprevalence in juveniles then in adults.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 154, "end": 157, "text": "11,", "ref_id": "BIBREF10"}, {"start": 158, "end": 161, "text": "16,", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 162, "end": 164, "text": "17", "ref_id": "BIBREF16"}, {"start": 371, "end": 372, "text": "7", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}, {"start": 593, "end": 594, "text": "7", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}, {"start": 727, "end": 730, "text": "12,", "ref_id": "BIBREF11"}, {"start": 731, "end": 733, "text": "19", "ref_id": "BIBREF18"}, {"start": 861, "end": 863, "text": "12", "ref_id": "BIBREF11"}, {"start": 1038, "end": 1040, "text": "18", "ref_id": "BIBREF17"}, {"start": 1214, "end": 1216, "text": "20", "ref_id": "BIBREF19"}, {"start": 1422, "end": 1424, "text": "16", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1483, "end": 1485, "text": "17", "ref_id": "BIBREF16"}, {"start": 1670, "end": 1672, "text": "12", "ref_id": "BIBREF11"}, {"start": 1849, "end": 1851, "text": "12", "ref_id": "BIBREF11"}, {"start": 2255, "end": 2257, "text": "21", "ref_id": "BIBREF20"}, {"start": 2523, "end": 2525, "text": "24", "ref_id": "BIBREF23"}, {"start": 2632, "end": 2641, "text": "Kamber 25", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2917, "end": 2919, "text": "25", "ref_id": "BIBREF24"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 33, "end": 38, "text": "Tabuk", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 257, "end": 262, "text": "Tabuk", "ref_id": null}], "section": "| DISCUSSION"}, {"text": "The predominance of viral antibodies in young camels could also be explained by animal exposure to the virus few times postparturition and not by mother immunity, which will stimulate antibody secretion in the blood.
