The number of cases and deaths depends on the testing strategy of each country. The deaths that are reported may vary according whether these include only hospitalized cases with definite diagnoses, whereas others may also count deaths occurring at home. There is a lag time between the reporting of the case and the death which can occur up to weeks later. In the country reports, cases and deaths are usually reported at the same time, so the cases in the denominator are usually an overestimate of the true denominator which should be the number of cases reported sometime earlier. This will have a more dramatic effect when the number of cases are rising rapidly. There may be misclassification of cases, depending on the sensitivity and the specificity of the methods used to diagnose a case. The cause of death could be wrongly coded particularly in elderly people with multiple co-morbidities. However, while these factors will affect the calculation of the true CFR, they should not have an important impact on demonstrating the serious limitations in using crude CFRs for country comparisons.
