            "text": "Viruses are among the smallest biological entities and, because of the small size of their genomes, their survival depends on the use of a variety of molecular strategies that allow them to stretch their genome-coding capacities to the limit. For example, the single-stranded DNA Geminiviridae that are ~3 kb in length, a length that would generally allow transcription and translation of a less than 100-kDa polypeptide, employ a sophisticated multiframe reading of their plus-genome and negative-genome strands that amplifies their coding capacity several-folds, considerably increasing the number and size of the translation products that can be obtained (Hull, 2002). Similarly, the coding capacities of many single-stranded RNA viruses are enhanced by the use of read-through products. An even more common strategy is for a few viral expression products to play multiple roles. For example, the p25 gene of the citrus tristeza closterovirus, family Closteroviridae, (i) encodes the coat protein that encapsidates most (~97%) of the viral particles (Febres et al., 1996), (ii) acts as a suppressor of RNA silencing (RSS; Lu et al., 2004), and (iii) is most probably involved in vector adaptation for the natural transmission of this virus from infected to uninfected hosts. Similarly, the p23 protein of CTV serves as (i) an RSS (Lu et al., 2004), (ii) a regulator of RNA strand synthesis (Satyanarayana et al., 2002), and (iii) the inducer of CTV symptoms in certain CTV-sensitive host plants (Flores et al., 2013).",

            "text": "Viral genomes are equipped with a complex and versatile toolbox that allows them to survive and spread, despite a number of serious limitations, such as (i) dependence on just a few insect species for natural transmission, (ii) dependence on a sometimes restricted range of host plants or on only certain types of tissues, and (iii) the challenge of a potent generic host defense mechanism, the RNA-silencing system. Despite the sophisticated replication machinery that viruses have developed for their survival, it is difficult to understand how some large, single-stranded, single-component RNA genomes, such as the ~30-kb genome of animal-infecting coronaviruses and most of the 15- to 20-kb genomes of Closteroviridae members, manage to survive in the face of incidental degradation and targeted dicing by the active host defense silencing machinery within their host cells and/or as they are carried by phloem-feeding aphid vectors. The biological cost of such a situation, in which every single fracture at each of the c. 20,000 possible fragile targets could lead to RNA disruption and to total genetic and energetic loss, could have been detrimental to the continuous survival of such big genomes. In addition, CTV must also contend with the grave consequences of high error rates of viral RNA replication (Lauring and Andino, 2010), which for the large CTV genome is expected to result in average of at least two nucleotide changes per each genome/generation. For CTV tolerant Citrus sp. trees, which often survive tens and even up to 100 years, such a mutation rate could had been expected to result in a considerable genetic diversity. Surprisingly, however, analyses of CTV strains from spatially and temporally separated citrus trees revealed a highly conserved genome (Albiach-Mart\u00ed et al., 2000). Further evidence for the remarkable genetic stability of closterovirus genomes (Dolja and Koonin, 2013), especially of the CTV, is the CTV-based vectors infecting citrus plants. Some of the CTV-based vectors infected citrus trees continued to express the inserted green fluorescent protein (GFP) gene for up to 7 years (Dawson, 2011). The genetic stability of CTV holds apparently only when plants are infected by a monotypic closterovirus isolate (Weng et al., 2007). Genetic analysis of a Floridian CTV isolate from citrus tree infected by three major CTV genotypes revealed numerous variants generated by promiscuous recombination between the major genotypes and additional divergence further increased genotypic complexity of the initial recombinants (Weng et al., 2007; Zhongguo Xiong, personal communication). These results raise the possibility of an unknown mechanism to limit accumulation of point mutation CTV mutants while preserving those generated through recombination. The presence of multiple defective dRNAs in trees infected with many CTV isolates further supports this possibility (Batuman et al., 2010).",

The question of why these heterologous double-recombinants are so small has been raised. CTV-dRNA homologous-sequence double-recombinants (Class 5 dRNAs) are more than 100 nucleotides in length; whereas the heterologous inserts of Class 6 dRNAs are at least 10-fold shorter. One possible explanation for this could be that a naturally occurring selection process eliminates any CTV-dRNAs with inserts of host genes of 21\u201325 nt, which might silence the normal expression of the respective host genes. Such a mechanism could also explain the limited amount of non-self recombinants among RNA viruses, in general, and suggest a new function for RNA silencing of RNA viruses, namely reducing the possibility that virus genomes might amplify RNA segments derived from the mRNA of their hosts.",

Information gathered from Class 2 and 3 CTV-dRNAs led researchers to suggest a fourth mechanism involving the recombination of the 3\u2032 termini of sgRNAs with different-sized pieces from the 5\u2032 end of the CTV genome (Yang et al., 1997; Che et al., 2003). More recent studies have reported recombination involving the 5\u2032 termini of sgRNAs and different-sized molecules from the 5\u2032 part of the virus (see Figure 1, Classes 2 and 4). Components of the replication-associated machinery were found to be involved in the evolution of other viruses and intergenic regions are known to be the preferred crossover sites for brome mosaic virus (BMV) recombinants (Nagy and Bujarski, 1996).",

First, the finding that populations of naturally self-replicating dRNAs (Class 3) and Class 4 dRNAs harboring the entire battery of ORFs analogous to the RNA 2 of criniviruses suggests that similar forms of dRNA may have led to the evolution of the bipartite criniviruses from a monopartite velarivirus parent. In addition, dsRNA molecules corresponding to one or more major CTV-dRNAs have been found to account for substantial amounts of the total dsRNA found in CTV-infected plants. Since dsRNA molecules can be considered the dead ends of the viral replication process, their abundance in Closteroviridae (Dodds and Bar-Joseph, 1983) naturally raises evolutionary questions. One possibility that we would like to suggest is that, in addition to the three suppressor genes, CTV and other Closteroviridae with large, very fragile genomes use the abundant dsRNA in their genomic, subgenomic, and dRNA as a buffering system, to protect their large RNA genomes against the risk of being targeted by the active host defense RNA silencing.",

After two decades of continuous transmission of the VT isolate in Mexican lime and Alemow seedlings, the symptoms observed on the Alemow plants remained unchanged. However, among the SO (sour orange) plants that used to test for SY (seedling yellows), we noticed that some failed to exhibit the typical SY symptoms. The examination of the dRNAs of Alemow plants infected with CTV-VT subisolates that exhibited SY and non-SY reactions revealed the presence of one major dRNA population. The main difference between both subisolate groups was the association of 4.5- and 2.4-kb dRNAs with non-SY- and SY-reacting VT isolates, respectively. Furthermore, VT isolate #12, which contains a large dRNA with a complete 5\u2032 moiety of the gRNA, did not induce the stem-pitting symptoms typically observed in infected Alemow plants. However, the possibility of differences between SY and non-SY, or stem pitting(SP) and non-SP, isolates in other genomic regions was not ruled out and the considerable progress that has been made recently in the field of sequencing techniques is expected to clarify this issue. In conclusion, the roles and biological functions of the numerous dRNAs associated with Closteroviridae remain terra incognita.",

Pro, papain-like protease; MT, methyltransferase; Hel, RNA helicase; RdRp, RNA-dependent RNA polymerase; HSP70h, a heat shock protein 70 homolog; CP, major coat protein; CPm, minor coat protein. Proteins are named according to their relative molecular masses. The figure shows also diagrams of Classes 1\u20136 defective (D) RNAs associated with CTV gRNA.",
