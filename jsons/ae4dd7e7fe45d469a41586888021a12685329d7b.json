Orchitis caused by mumps virus mainly develops in adult patients [22] . The virus attacks the testis directly, destroying the testicular parenchyma, causing degeneration of germ cells, exudation of leukocytes, and deposition of collagen [23, 24] . Apart from HIV and mumps virus, other viruses, such as Hepatitis B and C viruses, Epstein-Barr virus, and Papilloma virus, were also reported to cause viral orchitis [9] . SARS is a new disease caused by a novel coronavirus. We report here that the SARS virus causes orchitis. Germ cells must develop at a temperature lower than 378C. Persistent high fever leads to changes in testicular temperature, contributing to germ cell degeneration and destruction. Previous studies reported that high temperature resulted in meiotic germ cell apoptosis [25] . High fever was also thought to play an important role in mumps orchitis [26] . High fever in SARS might have an indirect effect on testicular dysfunction. CD3 (B and D) .

In the control group, there was a case (C03) with lasting high fever, and this testis demonstrated mild fibrosis and congestion with no obvious germ cell loss or leukocyte infiltration. In addition, the treatment of SARS with steroids could also have affected spermatogenesis. Glucocorticoid had been used in five cases (except S05) and it had been reported to induce rat Leydig cell apoptosis [27] . In this study, we did not find an obvious increase of apoptotic Leydig cell in the six SARS cases (P . 0.05 compared with control). Instead, we found mild Leydig cell hyperplasia in some cases. The testis of case S05, who did not take steroids, also displayed changes of orchitis, as did another five SARS cases. Glucocorticoid should not induce leukocyte infiltration and is routinely used to treat orchitis to suppress inflammation. This indicates that steroid treatment might not be the cause for orchitis in SARS, at least not for case S05. Reports on testicular endocrine function in viral orchitis are rare. Previous studies observed a drop in testosterone level together with an increase in LH and FSH levels in patients suffering from mumps orchitis [28] . Similarly, in some male AIDS cases, low serum testosterone levels associated with high serum LH and FSH levels were also reported [29] . These findings suggest that viruses might act indirectly via changes in the hypothalamic-pituitary-testis axis. However, there were other studies that found no significant abnormality in sex hormone in male patients with HIV orchitis [14] . The absence of clinical information on the levels of testosterone, LH, or FSH in these SARS patients precludes the possibility of a meaningful clinicopathological correlation.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 228, "end": 232, "text": "[19]", "ref_id": "BIBREF18"}, {"start": 233, "end": 237, "text": "[20]", "ref_id": "BIBREF19"}, {"start": 238, "end": 242, "text": "[21]", "ref_id": "BIBREF20"}, {"start": 310, "end": 314, "text": "[22]", "ref_id": "BIBREF21"}, {"start": 482, "end": 486, "text": "[23,", "ref_id": "BIBREF22"}, {"start": 487, "end": 490, "text": "24]", "ref_id": "BIBREF23"}, {"start": 659, "end": 662, "text": "[9]", "ref_id": "BIBREF8"}, {"start": 1038, "end": 1042, "text": "[25]", "ref_id": "BIBREF24"}, {"start": 1117, "end": 1121, "text": "[26]", "ref_id": "BIBREF25"}, {"start": 2295, "end": 2299, "text": "[27]", "ref_id": "BIBREF26"}, {"start": 3060, "end": 3064, "text": "[28]", "ref_id": "BIBREF27"}, {"start": 3197, "end": 3201, "text": "[29]", "ref_id": "BIBREF28"}, {"start": 3438, "end": 3442, "text": "[14]", "ref_id": "BIBREF13"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 1200, "end": 1213, "text": "CD3 (B and D)", "ref_id": null}], "section": "412"}, {"text": "Viruses are known to be capable of infecting the testis directly.

Although the number of cases in this study is limited, the data indicate that SARS infection affected the testes significantly. Like orchitis associated with HIV, mumps, and HBV, several possible mechanisms may be involved in causing testicular damages in SARS patients. Virus does not only cause orchitis, but also leads to sterility and increased incidence of testicular tumor [15] [16] [17] . This is particularly important for SARS patients, as most of them are males in the age range of 20-50 yr.
