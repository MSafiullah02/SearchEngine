However, despite their potential to cause serious respiratory illness in otherwise healthy individuals, most asthma studies describe relatively low levels of IFVs in exacerbations, accounting for approximately 1% to 9% of all virus-related asthma exacerbations (see Table 1).7, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16\n",

Because, unlike other respiratory viruses, vaccines against IFV subtypes and strains are available and asthmatics frequently have increased vaccination rates due to their at-risk status during flu season, IFV-related exacerbations should be reduced or indeed eliminated among asthmatic children and adults.21, 22 However, some studies have shown that despite their three- to fourfold greater odds of having an influenza vaccination (as reported by parents), asthmatic children have higher rates of IFV-related hospital visits23 and that vaccination does not affect the number, duration, or severity of IFV-related asthma exacerbations compared with placebo.24 Other similar studies have shown that influenza vaccination also fails to reduce severe and fatal complications in adults with asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).20\n",

However, if influenza vaccination of asthmatics fails to reduce IFV-proven exacerbations (ie, by RT-PCR during symptomatic illness) then alternative vaccination strategies may be required to increase efficacy.

The HCoV virion also comprises 3 viral encoded proteins (S, E, and M), and characterization has indicated that binding to host cell receptors is mediated predominately via the spike (S) glycoprotein, with each HCoV employing a specific host cell receptor during infection (see Table 1). The virion of Betacoronavirus also contains a hemagglutinin (HE) protein, which is thought to be involved in either host-receptor interactions or release of virus from infected cells.31, 32, 33\n",

This study also described HRV and RSV detection rates in the asthmatic group of 32.4% and 2.7%, respectively, despite none of the participants experiencing respiratory symptoms for the duration of the study (3 weeks). However, a confounding aspect of this study is that the subjects were classified as having mild asthma that was well controlled (fluticasone 100\u2013250 \u03bcg daily) in the 6 months before the start of the study. Nevertheless, the disparity in viral detection between the asthmatic and control groups may imply some mechanism of either persistence in asthmatics or an association with the long-term compliance of glucocorticoid therapy and inhibition of symptoms during respiratory virus infection.",

Given our incomplete knowledge about the role of KIPyV and WUPyV in respiratory illness, it may be plausible that the high codetection rates observed in ARI studies are not the result of bona fide dual infections, but rather may be caused by infection with another respiratory virus evoking an immune response that reactivates latent KIPyV and WUPyV.",

These investigators observed that the proportion of KIPyV- and WUPyV-seropositive individuals increased at around 4 years of age, a finding that they speculated was the result of KIPyV and WUPyV exposure during school attendance. However, they conceded that the serum obtained for their study originated from 2 tertiary referral hospitals and was likely from individuals with underlying medical conditions. Given that ARI represents the most common reason for hospital visits and admissions among school-aged children, and that the incidence of other respiratory virus infections also increases among this age group, the KIPyV and WUPyV antibody detected may not be that produced in response to initial exposure, but rather antibody produced during KIPyV and WUPyV reactivation evoked by infection with another ARI-causing respiratory virus. Indeed, Nguyen and colleagues99 reported that a high proportion of adults were KIPyV- and WUPyV-seropositive which, considering the nature of the study cohort (ie, hospital-based), may not indicate preexisting immunity but again KIPyV and WUPyV reactivation during illness. Future community-based studies will no doubt determine when initial KIPyV and WUPyV exposure occurs and will better elucidate the relationships that exist between ARI, viral codetections, and KIPyV and WUPyV reactivation.",
