            "text": "Inhibition of enzymes may occur either reversibly or irreversibly. In the case of irreversible inhibition, a covalent reaction between a nucleophilic amino acid (in most cases, an activated Cys, Ser or Thr side chain), either of the active or an allosteric site, reacts with an electrophilic functional group of the inhibitor, the so-called \u201cwarhead\u201d. Besides this reactive building block, enzyme inhibitors also contain a recognition unit fitting into the substrate binding pockets. In the case of protease inhibitors these are mainly peptidic or peptidomimetic sequences. However, not all covalent reactions of enzyme and inhibitor lead to irreversible inhibition, and this has received increasing attention in drug development in the last years to design covalent, but reversible inhibitors due to several advantages over non-covalent inhibitors such as longer target residence times or higher potency and ligand efficiency (for reviews on this topic see [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8]).",

The cathepsin L-like protease rhodesain from Trypanosoma brucei rhodesiense, the parasite causing human African trypanosomiasis (HAT), is essential for the parasite\u2019s survival, since it is involved in several pathological processes in the host.

These experiments revealed the formation of an adduct with rhodesain for both acid 8 and ester 7 showing exactly the same pattern (Figure 4). These data are in line with the previous NMR spectroscopic observation that the benzyl ester of the dipeptide recognition unit is first hydrolyzed by rhodesain, which subsequently forms a very stable complex with the hydrolysis product. This may also hold true for inhibitor 4. Since the complex formation is reversible\u2014as shown by the enzyme assays discussed above\u2014and the mass spectra show the mass of the adduct of enzyme and acid 8 and not the mass of an adduct resulting from nucleophilic substitution of either the fluoride or a nitro group, the SNAr reaction cannot be completed. Hence, the data are only consistent with a \u03c0- or a Meisenheimer (\u03c3-) complex.",

All three possible reaction products resulting from substitution of the nitro- (10), fluoro- (11) and of both groups (12) were obtained in the experiments, in which the reaction temperature (rt or 80 \u00b0C), the amounts of thiol and base (excess or two equivalents each) and the reaction time (4 h, 16 h, 28 h) were varied. The main product (ca. 60\u201370%) detected in the 16 h reaction at 80 \u00b0C with a large excess of thiol and triethylamine was the double-substitution product (12) accompanied by small amounts of 10 and 11. At rt with two eq. base and thiol, ca. 70\u201380% unreacted starting material, accompanied by small amounts of all three reaction products (10\u201312), was detected. After 28 h at rt (2 eq. base and thiol), the amount of starting material decreased (to ca. 40%) and the amounts of the three substitution products (10\u201312) increased (to ca. 15\u201325% each).

They were obtained by a full geometry optimization starting with a S\u2026CX distance (X = F, NO2, H) of 1.9 \u00c5. The resulting complexes represent Meisenheimer complexes as can be deduced from the distances: the distances R(S\u2026CX) remain at about 1.9 \u00c5 and the distances R(CAr\u2026X) are already considerably elongated. According to the more accurate MP2 or SCS-MP2 computations, the Meisenheimer complexes represent stable minima on the hypersurface, which lie about 4\u201313 kcal/mol lower than the reactants. The computations also indicate a stable pre-complex stabilized by a hydrogen bond between the NH group and the attacking thiolate, which according to the more accurate MP2- and SCS-MP2-calculations, is similarly stable as the Meisenheimer complexes. It should be noted that wB97XD considerably underestimates the stability of the Meisenheimer complexes. The computations are in good agreement with the experiment, which finds SNAr reactions between 2-phenylethanethiol (9) in the presence of a base in ethanol at rt. Figure 6 also contains the 19F NMR shifts relative to the value computed for the inhibitor.

In the first calculation, we put the thiolate at a distance of about 1.9 \u00c5 from the attacked carbon center of the aromatic ring and performed a full geometry optimization. The resulting complexes are depicted in Figure 6 as \u201cthiolate and imidazolium: full optimization\u201d. The more reliable MP2- or SCS-MP2-computations predict that the resulting complexes are stable with respect to the fragmentation into the inhibitor and thiolate/imidazolium complex. The computed complexes, however, are not Meisenheimer complexes as found for the situation without the imidazolium (only thiolate). The R(S\u2026CX) distances are about 3.9\u20134.0 \u00c5 and the R(CAr\u2026X) are not elongated. Nevertheless, the stability of this complex upon fragmentation into inhibitor and thiolate/imidazolium complex is about 20 kcal/mol, i.e., they are even more stable than the Meisenheimer complexes found for the \u201conly thiolate\u201d situation. It should be noted that the situation found for the attack at C\u2212NO2 does not reflect the situation in the enzyme, because the thiolate and the imidazolium ring interchange their positions during the full optimization to maximize the interaction energy. The same holds true for the attack at C\u2212F due to the orientation of the substituted ring. Both the pre-complex and the situation found for the attack at the CH group of the ring could also take place in the enzyme (see Section 2.7). To get more insights, we also built a complex in which we fixed the S\u2013CX bond lengths to about 1.9 \u00c5, i.e., we enforced a kind of Meisenheimer complex in which the positively charged imidazolium is present. According to MP2 or SCS-MP2, the resulting complexes (Figure 6: thiolate and imidazolium: R(S\u2212CX fixed at 1.9 \u00c5)) are 4\u201310 kcal/mol less stable than the complex obtained by the full optimization. This indicates that a thiolate/imidazolium complex should not be able to form a Meisenheimer complex. Again, the 19F NMR shifts were computed. Their variations with respect to the 19F NMR shift of the pure inhibitor are also given in Figure 6. It can be seen that the NMR shift variations found for the complexes are considerably smaller than those found for the corresponding Meisenheimer complexes. Furthermore, they are of similar size as the experimental shift difference. The comparison between the employed theoretical approaches clearly shows that the DFT functional \u03c9B97XD underestimates the stability of the complexes by up to 10 kcal/mol.",

The latter indicates a strong interaction between the catalytic dyad Cys-25/His-162 and the electrophilic aromatic ring, which was also found for the model system (see Section 2.6). It is worth noting that for poses of the ester 7 in which the electrophilic aromatic ring was also in the vicinity of Cys-25 such a conformational change was not found. In the case of the ester, all poses stayed in conformations with quite long Cys-S\u2026H-N distances.

To investigate the situation for the present question, possible reaction paths of the addition step of the thiolate moiety to the aromatic ring including the influence of the enzyme environment were computed. For this instance, hybrid QM/MM computations were performed in which the most important part is described quantum-mechanically (QM) while the influence of the rest is taken into account by force field approaches (MM) using the ONIOM (own n-layered integrated molecular orbital and molecular mechanics) approach implemented in GAUSSIAN16 [69]. Within these computations, the QM part consisted of 35 atoms. It was described by SCS-MP2/6-31 + G* because the \u03c9B97XD values underestimated the effects in the model computation. The influence of the rest of the enzyme (more than 5200 atoms) was included into the MM part, which was described by the AMBER16 force field. The electrostatic embedding was employed to include possible polarization effects. For the calculations, some frames of the MD simulation performed for the complex of compound 8 and rhodesain were selected, and a full geometry optimization was conducted using QM/MM. The resulting geometry represents the starting point for a possible addition of the thiolate to the substituted aromatic ring as the first step of the SNAr reaction. We computed the minimal energy path of the addition by decreasing the distance between the thiolate and the two reachable carbon centers (C\u2013H and C\u2013NO2).

The specific nature and the interplay of the various interactions still have to be deciphered. As for the model system, the computations for the enzyme environment also find a repulsive reaction path, so that a Meisenheimer complex cannot be formed. As a consequence, a complete substitution reaction cannot take place in the enzyme.",

Because the reaction path of the formation of a Meisenheimer complex is repulsive, a SNAr reaction as found for the reaction of 2-phenylethanethiol with the ester 7 in the presence of a base in ethanol cannot take place in the enzyme. This explains why acid 8 is a reversible inhibitor. The lower inhibitory potency of ester 7 is a consequence of the non-covalent interactions between inhibitor and enzyme, which prevent the formation of such a strong complex.",

The differences in anti-protease and anti-trypanosomal activity between the lipophilic ester 7 and the more hydrophilic acid 8 might be due to different cell permeabilities of the compounds. With the acid 8 being the active protease inhibitor and the more lipophilic benzyl ester 7 being the better anti-trypanosomal compound that is converted to the active protease inhibitor 8 by the target enzyme itself, we presumably have discovered a new prodrug concept for anti-trypanosomal compounds targeting the major trypanosomal cysteine protease rhodesain. These results are in agreement with previous findings [75], which showed that especially rhodesain inhibitors with benzyl ester moieties display high anti-trypanosomal activity.",

The evaluation of (hetero)aromatic electrophiles as possible inhibitory fragments or warheads for peptidic cysteine protease inhibitors is a first important step. Among the inhibitors presented herein, which contain the dipeptide HN-l-Phe-l-Leu-OBn as the recognition unit for cathepsin L-like proteases, the 2-fluoro-3-nitro-substituted benzoic acid amide 4 and the 2-fluoro-4,5-dinitro-substituted aniline derivative 7 were discovered as very potent cathepsin L inhibitors. Amide 4 additionally inhibits the trypanosomal cathepsin L-like protease rhodesain. The compounds were found to exhibit a competitive and reversible mode of inhibition. As shown by NMR spectroscopy, mass spectrometry and hydrolysis assays, the benzyl ester 7 was found to be hydrolyzed to the free acid 8 by rhodesain to yield a highly potent reversible rhodesain inhibitor (Ki = 4.0 nM). Thus, with the benzyl ester 7, we identified an unexpected prodrug that is converted into the active protease inhibitor by the target enzyme itself. This is supported by the T. b. brucei cell survival assays, which revealed the benzyl ester 7 as a compound with significantly enhanced anti-trypanosomal activity. The serendipitous discovery of the dual mode of action of compound 8 implies that other ester- or even amide-type inhibitors may also react similarly. The ester 7 performed SNAr reactions with 2-phenylethanethiol in ethanol in the presence of a base. Such a reaction is also expected for 8 because both possess the same substituted aromatic ring. However, because 8 acts as a reversible inhibitor, such a reaction cannot be the inhibition mechanism of rhodesain.",

The former is a model for the reaction of phenylethanethiol in ethanol in the presence of a base, while the latter mimics the catalytic dyad of the protease. For a single thiolate, the computations predict stable Meisenheimer complexes, which is in line with the observed SNAr reactions. By contrast, for a thiolate/imidazolium dyad, a stable \u03c0-complex is found. The reaction potential of a further approach towards a Meisenheimer complex is repulsive, i.e., the reaction cannot take place. Consequently, while an irreversible reaction is predicted for a single thiolate, a reversible formation of a stable \u03c0-complex is computed for the thiolate/imidazolium dyad. Subsequent QM/MM computations simulating the reaction of 8 with rhodesain indicate a similar situation. Hence, we expect that an SNAr reaction of acid 8 with rhodesain does not take place because the reaction is trapped in a very stable \u03c0-complex. The complex seems to receive additional stability through a strong hydrogen bridge between the thiolate group of Cys-25 and the NH-substituent of the aromatic ring.",

Additionally, no indication for the formation of a stable \u03c0-complex or the thiolate-NH bridge is seen. Hence, we expect that these complexes are less stable, which nicely explains the lower inhibitory potency of ester 7 compared to acid 8. Docking also predicts a reverse, substrate-like binding pose, which is ideal for the hydrolysis of the ester through rhodesain. MD simulations find this pose to be reasonably stable. For the acid 8 in rhodesain, docking and MD find very stable complexes in which the substituted aromatic ring and the catalytic Cys-25/His-162 dyad are sufficiently close. However, as described above, the reaction path towards the Meisenheimer complex only exhibits shallow minima for large distances (R(S-CH) or R(S-CNO2) \u2248 3.1 \u2013 4.0 \u00c5) while it is repulsive for a further approach.
