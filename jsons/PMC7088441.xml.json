An effective disease management strategy reduces the risks from disease, slow down its progression and reduces symptoms. It is the most efficient and affordable way to reduce the risk of disease. Preventive measures strategies are divided into different stages, e.g., primary, secondary and tertiary. Disease prevention can be applied at any prevention level along with the disease history, with the goal of preventing its progression further. Primary It seeks to reduce the occurrence of new cases, e.g., stress management, exercises, smoking cessation to prevent lung cancer and immunization against communicable diseases. Thus, it is most applicable at the suspected stage of a patient. Strategies of primary prevention include risk factor reduction, general health promotion and other protective measure. This can be done by bringing up the healthier lifestyles and environmental health approaches through health education and promotion program. Secondary Purpose of secondary prevention is to either cure the disease, slow down its progression, or reduce its impact and is the most appropriate for those in the stage of early-stage or pre-symptomatic disease. It attempts to reduce the number of cases through early detection of the disease and reducing or halting its progression, e.g., detection of coronary heart patient after their first heart attack, blood tests for lead exposure, eye tests for glaucoma, lifestyle and dietary modification. Common approach to secondary prevention includes procedure to detect and treat preclinical pathological changes early through screening for disease, e.g., mammography for early-stage breast cancer detection. Tertiary The key aim of tertiary disease prevention is to enhance life quality of patient. Once the disease is firmly established and has been treated in its acute clinical phase, it seeks to soften the impact of disease on the patient through therapy and rehabilitation, e.g., tight control of type-1 diabetes, assisting a cardiac patient to lose weight and improving the functioning of stroke patient through rehabilitation program.",

Moreover, data privacy and liability, capital cost, technical issue are other factors. Data privacy is another major hurdle in development of prevention system. Most of the healthcare organizations have HIPAA certification; however, it does not guarantee the privacy and security of data as HIPAA is considering security and policy rather than implementation [7].

It is major lifestyle factor that contributes extensively for disease prevention such as diabetes, cancer, cardiovascular disease, metabolic syndrome and obesity etc. Poor diet and inactive lifestyle are lethal combination. Joint WHO/FAO expert consultation on diet, nutrition and the prevention of chronic diseases states that chronic diseases are preventable and developing countries are facing consequences of nutritionally compromised diet [9]. Individual has power to reduce the risk of chronic disease by making positive changes in lifestyle and diet. Use of Tobacco, unhealthy diet, and lack physical activity are associated with many chronic conditions. Evidence shows that healthy diet and physical activity does not only influence present health but also helps to decrease morbidity and mortality. Specific diet and lifestyle changes and their benefits are summarized in Table 3. Food and nutrition interventions can be effective at any prevention stage. In primary stage, food and nutrition therapy could be used to prevent the occurrence of disease such as obesity. What if disease is already identified and how diet can help to reduce the effect of disease? Recent studies shows, potential of food and nutrition interventions as secondary and tertiary prevention is also effective preventive strategy that reduce the risk factor and slow down the progression or mitigate the symptoms and complications. Thus, at secondary, it could be used to reduce the impact of a disease and at tertiary stage, it helps to reduce the complications, i.e., stomach ulcer. Dietitian plays critical role in disease prevention, i.e., change in lifestyle can help to delay or prevent type II diabetes.",

Moreover, the rapid growth of cellular networks provides opportunity to be in touch with patient [13]. Reminder-based preventive services involves continuous risk assessment of several life-threatening disease (cardiac disease [14\u201317], diabetes management [18\u201321] through vital sciences [14, 15, 18\u201320] or reminder of due for specific preventive services such as vaccination, follow-up appointment, weight loss [22\u201325] or reminder for medicine [22, 23, 26]. This type of communication could by any electronic medium, i.e., call, SMS or emails. Studies found that automated reminder services are very effective in boosting patient adherence [27, 28]. Healthcare databases contain cardiac disease data, but practical methods are required to identify patient at risk and continuous monitoring of those patient through electronic vita science data, i.e., Blood pressure, cholesterol and glucose etc. Several studies have been performed to reduce risk through automated reminder using collected primary care data [14, 15]. Text message-based intervention for supporting diabetic patient helps to improve self-management behaviors and achieve better control over glycemic [18\u201320].

Several companies (i.e., Medtronic, BottomLine, Medisafe, ImPACT, Actismile. Allianz and AiQ) are providing low cost wearable solution like concussion management, cardiovascular, monitoring, reminders, diabetes, overweight, metabolism etc. Recent development in intelligent data analysis methods nano-electronics, communication and sensor technology made possible the development of small wearable devices for healthcare monitoring. Wearable sensors are able to collect most of the useful medical data required for early identification and prevention, but it is still costly and most of the healthcare system are not yet able to process this data. In near future, wearable devices are getting cheaper (few dollars), smaller (almost invisible, i.e., sensor-clad smart garments, implanted devices), accurate (no approximation of data) and powerful (low battery consumption, high communication and processing power). Moreover, due to the recent development high processing sensors, research is shifting form simple reasoning to high-level data processing by implementing pattern recognition, data mining methodologies to provide much valuable information, i.e., fall detection, heart attack detection via data processing and sending message to emergency services or family member for immediate action.",

Unlike logistic regression that depends on pre-determined modal for prediction of binary event through fitting of data onto logistic curve, SVM produces binary classifier that discriminates between two classes by separating the hyperplanes through nonlinear mapping of data into feature space that is high dimensional.

Mostly, the predictive accuracy obtained using machine learning is slightly higher than other analytics methods or human experts [65] and it is high affordable to the noise data. However, despite these fact, neural networks was not preferable choice for data analytics due to facts: NN is quite slow in training and classification making it impractical for large data and trained neural networks are usually not comprehensible [66].

It is built upon strong assumption that features are independent with each other (so that classifier could be simple and fast) and it assumes that the effect of variable value on the given class is independent of other variable values. Mostly, Naive Bayes uses maximum likelihood for parameter estimation and classification is done by taking highest posterior of classified values. Based on given set of variables that belong to known class, the aim is to construct rules for classification of unknown data based. Limitation of Naive Bayes is sensitivity to correlated features. Selective Naive Bayes uses only subset of given attributes in making prediction [71]. It reduces the strong bias of Naive independence assumptions owing to variable selection [72]. The objective is to find among all variables, the best classifier, compliant with the Naive Bayes assumption. Several selection methods have been presented so far [71\u201374]. Selective Naive approach is good for datasets with a reasonable number of variables; however, it does not scale for large datasets with large number variables and instances [72].",

Studies [76\u201378] show that there is a large amount of redundancy, missing values as well as irrelevant variables in healthcare data that can effect the accuracy of disease prediction. Conventional wisdom is that larger corpora yield better predicting accuracy however data redundancy and irrelevancy introduces bias rather than benefits that distorts learned models. Thus, before applying any prediction model, dataset needs to be processed carefully by removing the redundant data (e.g., age, DOB, redundant lab reports) as well irrelevant data (e.g., gender attribute in case of gestational diabetes). However, little is known about the redundancy that exists in the data as well as what type of redundancy is beneficial as opposed to harmful. Statistical methods (correlation analysis etc) could be used to identify irrelevant variables, other alternative is feature selection based on the importance of specific variable. To deal with missing values, it is recommended to use data analysis methods that are robust to missingness that are good to use when we are confident that mild to moderate violations of the technique\u2019s key assumptions will produce little or may be no biasness in the resultant conclusions. As healthcare data is highly sensitive, one drawback of these method for missing or irrelevant information may lead to distortion of important relationship between set of dependent and independent variables. For example, smoking, drinking and helicobacter pylori individually might not affect stomach cancer significantly whereas all together could effect significantly [41]. Thus, efficient approaches are required for data preprocessing to avoid ignorance of that type associated data as deletion of such depended variable will significantly effect prediction power.",

An observation may belong to more than one cluster in fuzzy partitioning [79].

Another issue is the selection of proper parameter and proper clustering algorithm. Inappropriate choice of clustering algorithm or wrong choice of the parameters, clustering may not reflect the desired data partition [79]. Not all methods are applicable to all type of problem, so selection of algorithm is based on the type of problem. Several contributions have been made to address this issue [79\u201384]. One of the most common partitional algorithms is k-means. It uses an iterative refinement technique and attempts to minimize the dissimilarity between each element and the center of its cluster. k-mean partition the data into k cluster represent by their center.

Based on pairwise distance between sets of observations, HCA successively merges (hierarchically group) most similar observations until a termination condition holds. Unlike partition, it does not assume a particular value of k. First step in hierarchical clustering is to look the most similar/closet pair which are then joined to make clustering tree. Division or merging of cluster is performed on the similarity measure that is based on optimal criteria. Strategies for hierarchical clustering generally fall into two types agglomerative and divisive also known as bottom-up and top-down respectively. Divisive clustering starts with single cluster containing all observation and consider all possible way to split into appropriate sub-clusters recursively, whereas agglomerative starts with one point cluster and recursively merges two or more clusters into a new cluster in bottom-up fashion. Main disadvantages of the hierarchical methods are inability to scale and no back-tracking capability. Standard hierarchical approaches suffer from high computational complexity. Typical hierarchical clustering includes BIRCH, CURE and ROCK etc. To improve the performance, several approaches have been presented. In fuzzy based clustering also called soft clustering, where each data point can belong to more than one cluster. It is continuous interval [0, 1] of belonging label, 0, 1 is being used instead of discrete value in order to describe relationship more reasonably. Most widely used fuzzy clustering algorithms are the fuzzy C-means (FCM), fuzzy C-shells and mountain method (MM) algorithm. Fuzzy C-Means get membership of each data point to every cluster by optimizing the object function. Distribution-based clustering is iterative, fast and natural clustering of large dataset. It automatically determines the number of clusters and produces complex models for clusters that captures the dependences and correlation of data attributes. Data generated from the same distribution belongs to the same cluster if there exists several distributions in the original data [85]. GMM using expectation maximization and DBCLASD are of the most prominent method. Density-based clustering identifies distinctive clusters in the data based on high-density region (contagious region of high-density area separated from other clusters having low density region). Typical methods of density-based clustering includes DBSCAN, OPTICS and Mean-shift. DBSCAN (Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise) is the most well-known density-based clustering algorithm and does not require the number of clusters as a parameter. Further detail on clustering algorithms can be found at [85].",

Missing and outlier can significantly effect the measurements of similarity and the computational complexity. Thus, before going to clustering of data, it is recommended to eliminate the outliers. Grouping the data into cluster provides signification information about the object. Without prior knowledge of number of clusters or any other composition information of clusters, cluster analysis cannot be performed. Clustering (distance-based clustering) performance is also effected by distance function used. High dimensionally is another issue of data clustering. Number of features are very high and may even exceed the number of samples. Fixed number of data points become increasingly sparse as the dimensionality increase.

Quadratic and cubic scaling is also fine but with linear behavior. Generally, healthcare data is not totally numerical, thus conversion is required to make it useful. Conversion into numerical value could distort the data that could affect the accuracy, for example there attributes values A, B, C are converted to numerical values 1, 2 and 3.

Association rules are created by analyzing data for frequent if/then patterns and using the criteria support and confidence to identify the most important relationships. Thus, the problem of association rules is divided into two phases: generation of frequent itemset (find all the itemset: frequent pattern that satisfy the minsup threshold) and rule generation (extract the all high confidence rules form frequent patterns). Computation requirement of frequent-pattern generation are more expensive than rule generation that is straightforward. Finding of all frequent item-sets involves searching all possible item-sets in the database thus is difficult and computational expensive that can be reduced by reducing the number of candidate (a priori method) or reducing the number of comparison (FP-Growth, tree generation etc).",

The most common algorithm for association rule is the Apriori algorithm. It is an algorithm for frequent item set mining and association rule learning over transactional databases. It uses breadth-first search and hash tree strategy to count the support of itemsets and uses a candidate generation function which exploits the downward closure property of support. AprioriDP is extension of Apriori that utilizes Dynamic Programming in frequent itemset mining. Finding of frequent sets requires several passes thus performance depends upon the size of the data. Processing of high density in primary memory is not feasible. Accesses to secondary memory could be reduce by effective partitioning. Tree based partitioning approach organizes the data into tree structures that can be processed independently [87]. To relieve the sequential bottlenecks, parallel frequent-pattern discovery algorithms exploit parallel and distributed computing resources. FP-growth counts item occurrence and stores into \u2019header table\u2019 followed by construction of FP-tree structure by inserting instances. Core of GP-growth is the use of frequent-pattern tree (FP-tree), a special data structure to retain the itemset association information. FP-tree is a compact structure that store quantitative information about frequent pattern. Further detail on association algorithms can be found at [30, 88].",

Computational cost could be reduced by sampling database, adding extra constraints, parallelization and reducing the number of passes over the database. To expedite multilevel association rules searching as well as avoiding the excessive computation in the meantime, much progress has been made during last few years. Other issues involved in association mining are selection of non-relevant rules, huge number of rules and selection of proper algorithm. A small number of rules are used by domain expert whereas all rules are used by classification system.

It is quite challenging to develop generic framework for anomaly detection due to unavailability of labeled data and domain specific normality; thus, most of the anomaly detection methods have been developed for certain domain [90]. It is an important problem and has a significant impact on the efficiency of any data mining system. The importance of its detection is due to the fact that its presence in data can compromise data quality and reduce the effectiveness of learning algorithm. Thus, it is a very critical problem and requires high degree of accuracy. Anomaly detection is the detection of items, events or observations in the data that do not conform to an expected pattern [91]. Broadly speaking, based on their nature, anomalies can be classified into four categories are point (individual data instance is considered as anomalous with respect to the rest of data), contextual (data instance is anomalous in a specific context), collective anomalies (collection of related data instances is anomalous with respect to the rest of dataset).",

As availability of labeled dataset for anomaly detection is not easily possible; thus, most of the approaches are based on unsupervised or semi-supervised learning methods where the purpose is to find the abnormal behavior. Supervised learning-based methods uses fully labeled data, semi-supervised anomaly detection uses anomaly-free dataset for training and find anomaly if it deviated from trained dataset whereas unsupervised detection method uses intrinsic information to detect anomalous values based on the deviation form majority of data. Why the supervised learning methods is not that successful for anomaly detection? First of all, not all supervised classification method suits for this task, i.e., C4.5 cannot be applied to unbalanced data [92]. Secondly, anomalies are abnormal behavior and they might not have known prior. Semi-supervised is one-class (normal data)-based method that is trained on normal data without anomalies and after that deviations from that data are considered anomalies. Unsupervised is the commonly used method for anomalies detection and it does not require data labeling. Distance or densities are used to estimates the abnormalities based on intrinsic properties of the dataset. Clustering is the simplest unsupervised methods to identify anomaly in data (Fig. 4).",

It is not able to detect local anomalies and only detect global anomalies. Anomaly score is computed on k-nearest-neighbors distance (computed either single (known as kth-NN) [94] or average (known as k-NN) [95]). Outlier Factor Local outlier factor is well know method for finding anomalous data points by measuring the local deviation of a given data point with respect to its neighboring point. LOF works in three steps: k-NN is applied to all data points; estimation of local density using local readability density; and finally computation of LOF score through LRD comparison with its neighbor LRD. In fact LOF is the ratio of local density. Connectivity-Based Outlier Factor (COF) is based on the spherical density computation rather than k-NN-based selection. Unlike LOF and COF,  Cluster-Based Local Outlier Factor (CBLOF) performs density estimation for clusters. First, clustering is performed to find clusters and then anomaly score is calculated based on the distance of each data point with cluster center. LDCOF  (local density cluster-based outlier factor) is the extension of CBLOF that considers the density of local cluster as well by segmenting into small and large clusters. LDCOF  (local density cluster-based outlier factor) is the extension of LDLOF to overcome the shortcoming of CBLOF and unweighted-CBLOF by estimating the clusters densities assuming a spherical distribution of the cluster members. LDCOF is local score as it is based on distance of instance to its cluster center. LOF and COF output are scores, but they do not determine the threshold. Outlier Probability resolves this issue. Clustering-based Multivariate Gaussian Outlier Score (CMGOS) is another extension of cluster-based anomaly detection. First, k-means clustering is performed followed by computation of covariance matrix. Local density estimation is calculated by estimating a multivariate Gaussian model and Mahalanobis distance is used for distance computation. Histogram-based Outlier Score (HBOS) is unsupervised, anomaly detection method [96]. It is fast than multivariate approach due to independence of features. For each feature, histogram is computed followed by multiplication of inverse height of the bins it resides for each instance. Due to the feature independence, HBOS can process a dataset under a minute, whereas other approaches may take hours.",

Successful approaches need to use a range of techniques to deal with real-world problem especially when data is quite large and complicated. During recent years, a large number of methods have been presented for anomaly detection, selection of method depends upon the type of anomaly and data itself. Before selecting a method, it is important to know which anomaly detection technique is best suited for a given anomaly detection problem and data. When dimensions are high in number, NN and clustering-based methods are not good option as the distance measures in high number of dimensions are not able to differentiate between anomalous and normal data. To deal with high-dimensional data, spectral techniques could be used as they explicitly address high dimensionality issue through high to low dimensional projection mapping. If fully labeled or partially-labeled data is available then supervised- or semi-supervised-based method could be used even in case of high-dimensional data. Semi-supervised method are preferable over supervised methods as supervised methods are poor to deal distribution imbalance of labels (normal vs specific anomaly) thus data need to be preprocessed to overcome this biasness issue. Due to the sensitivity of healthcare finding, one main challenge is to find best feature vector that provide maximum discrimination power and avoid false positive to minimum and has high accuracy. Thus, it is required to find efficient feature vector that characterizes the anomalous occurrence and its location causing agent in time or frequency domain using some domain transformation or wavelets. Another issue that should be considered is computational complexity as anomaly detection methods have high computational complexity especially when dealing with real-time data, i.e., data generated by ICU monitoring sensors. Most of the anomaly detection methods are unsupervised or semi-supervised and these techniques require expensive testing phases which can limit it in real setting. To overcome this issue, one should consider model size and its complexity. Another big challenge that effects the performance of anomaly detection method is data itself. Data should be accurate, complete and consistent. In healthcare sector, data contains noise which tends to be similar as anomalies or effect detection, Thus before applying anomaly detection, data should be cleaned carefully.",

Four years worth of data based on numerous indicators from multiple sources have been analyzed. Patient could be grouped into high-risk disease groups and risk could be minimized by preventive care, i.e., new preventive treatment protocols could be introduced among patient groups with high cholesterol. Rizzoli Orthopaedic Institute, Italy, is using advanced analytics to gain more granular understanding of dynamics of clinical variability within families for improving care and reducing treatment costs for hereditary bone diseases. Result showed significant improvement in healthcare efficiency, i.e., 30% reductions in annual hospitalizations and over 60% reductions in the number of imaging tests. Hospital is planning to gain more benefits by insights into the complex interplay of genetic factors and identify cures. Columbia University Medical Center is using analytical technique to analyze brain injured patients to detect complications earlier. To deal with complications proactively rather than re-actively, physiologic data form the patient who have suffered form bleeding stroke from a ruptured brain aneurysm is analyzed to provide critical information to medical professionals. Analytical techniques are applied on real-time data as well as persistent data to detect hidden pattern that indicate occurrence of complications. North York general hospital, implemented a scalable, real-time analytics solution to improve patient outcomes and develop deeper understanding of the operational factors driving its business. System provides analytical finding to physicians and administrators to improve the patient outcome.",

Jonnagaddala et al. presented a system for heart risk factor identification and progression for diabetic patients unstructured EHR data [104]. System consist of three modules core NLP, risk factor recognition and attribute assignment module. NLP assigns POS-tags and identifies noun phrases and forwards to risk factor recognition phase that identifies medications, disease disorder mentions, family history, smoking history and heart risk factors. Identified risk factors are then forwards to attribute assignment module assign indicator and time attributes to risk factors. In another study, Jonnagaddala et al. presented rule-based system to extract risk factors using clinical text mining [105]. Risk factor is extracted from unstructured electronic health records. Rules were developed to remove records, which do not contain age and gender information. Alneamy and Alnaish used hybrid teaching learning-based optimization (TLBO) and fuzzy wavelet neural network (FWNN) for identification of heart disease [106]. TLBO is used for training parameter updation used for training FWNN. Training data consists of 13 attributes are forward to FWNN and mean square error is computed that is used for weight updation using TBLO.

            "text": "As discussed in Sect. 3, decision tree is one of the best methods and is extensively used for disease prevention. [44, 46, 110\u2013113]. NaliniPriya and Anandhakumar [113] extended the decision tree to handle multivariate datasets. Choudhary and Bajaj [112] utilized k-NN and decision tree for the prediction of root canal treatment needs. When there is little change in ECG, Alizadehsani et al. [114] presented a system to find a way for specifying the lesioned vessel based on para clinic data, risk factor and physical examination. C4.5, Naive Bayes, and KNN methods are used for coronary arteries stenosis identification on set of 303 random visitor (Z-Alizadeh Sani dataset) with additional effective features (function class, dyspnoea, Q wave, ST elevation, ST depression and t inversion) and no missing value. C4.5 achieved best accuracy 74.20% for left anterior descending, 63.76% for left circumflex and 68.33% for right corona C4.5 and Bagging algorithms [115]. The system achieved 79.54%, 61.46%, and 68.96% left anterior descending, left circumflex and right coronary artery respectively. Karaolis et al. [116] investigated three events myocardial infarction (MI), percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), and coronary artery bypass graft surgery (CABG) using C4.5 decision tree algorithm on 528 cases. Based on three event using five splitting criteria (age, smoking, hypertension history, family history), most important risk factors extracted are age, smoking, and hypertension history for MI, family history, hypertension history, and history of diabetes for PCI and age, hypertension history, and smoking for CBAG. The system achieved accuracy 66%, 75%, and 75% for MI, PCI, and CABG models, respectively. Alizadehsani [117] compared different classifier SMO, Naive Bayes, neural network for identification of coronary artery disease on Z-Alizadeh Sani dataset, whereas weighted SVM is used for feature selection. Set of 34 of are selected which had the weight higher than 0.6. The study showed that SMO provides better accuracy 94.08% as compared to 75.51%, 88.11% by Naive Bayes and neural network, respectively. El-Bialy et al. applied fast decision tree and pruned C4.5 tree for the classification of coronary artery disease. Missing, incorrect, and inconsistent data problems is resolved using integration through integration the different datasets [118]. The strategy is to select attributed form different dataset for same medical problem. In this study, four different data coronary artery dataset (Cleveland, Hungarian, V.A. and statlog project heart dataset) are integrated. C4.5 and fast decision tree is applied on each dataset and five common features are selected form all decision tree. These five most common attributes are then used to build new integrated dataset that consist of only selected common features. Result showed that new integrated dataset provided gain in accuracy 78.06% from 75.48%. Fuzzy rules along with decision tree is also used for disease risk prediction [119, 120]. Fuzzy rules with decision tree are applied to overcome problems associated with uncertainty. Kim et al. [119, 121] used fuzzy with decision tree. Cerebrovascular risk factor are elder age, hypertension, heart disease, diabetes mellitus, temporal cerebral ischemia seizure and cerebrovascular disease history, and subordinate risk factors: hyperlipidemia, obesity, polycythemia, smoking, drinking, family heredity, oral contraceptive and other medicine. Elder people are vulnerable to cerebrovascular disease. Yeh et al. utilized decision tree, Bayesian classifier and back propagation neural network for the prediction of cerebrovascular disease [122]. In total 29 variables (9 out of 24, 12 out of 29 and 8 out of 10 for physical exam, blood test [101, 123, 124] and disease diagnosis, respectively) are selected based on clinician recommendation. System provided accuracy/sensitivity (%) 98.01/95.29, 91.30/87.10, 97.87/94.82 for decision tree, Bayes and BPNN, respectively, on 493 patients. Study identified eight major factors (diabetes mellitus, hypertension, myocardial infarction, cardiogenic shock, hyperlipidemia, arrhythmia ischemic heart disease and BMI) for accurately predicting cerebrovascular disease. Classification accuracy/sensitivity (%) is increased to 99.59/99.48 based on 16 extracted diagnose rules. Adnan et al. presented hybrid approach using decision Tree, Naive Bayes for Childhood Obesity Prediction [125]. CART is used to select eight important variables. Outputs of hybrid method is clustered into the positive and negative groups.",

It is quite serious disease that can lead to serious complication if not treated on time and there are several other diseases are related to diabetes. The cause of diabetes is mysterious, and it is due to the low insulin production by pancreas or body does not respond to produced insulin properly. As it is lifelong disease, thus, even for individual patient, massive amount of data is available to interpret [126]. Breault et al. applied CART on 15,902 diabetes patients and concluded that age is the most important attribute associated with bad glycemic control [127]. Using the age information, clinician can target specific set of people. Temporal abstraction method can be integrated with data mining algorithms to support data analysis. In another study, Yamaguchi et al. [128] used data forest software for type 1 diabetes mellitus prediction and predict next-morning FBG based on FBG, metabolic rate, food intake, and physical condition. The study concluded that physical conditions are highly correlated with FBG. Complex temporal abstractions are used for diabetes mellitus and blood glucose management [126, 129]. Cho et al. [130] compared different classification methods (logistic regression, SVM, and SVM with a cost sensitive learning method) for diabetic nephropathy and several feature selection methods have been used to remove redundant features. Study showed that linear SVM classifiers with embedded feature selection methods showed the promising result. Huang et al. applied Naive Bayes, IB1 classifier, and CART on 2,064 patients dataset and identify five important factors (age, insulin needs, diagnose duration, diet treatment and random blood glucose) that effect blood glucose control. Using these five attributes, system achieved 95% accuracy and 98% sensitivity [131].",

Stroke risk and severity prediction can contribute significantly to its prevention and early treatment. Literature shows that there are few post-stroke predictive models and wide range of different techniques has been applied for risk identification related to a particular condition. Strokes factors are age, smoking, diabetes, anti-hypertensive therapy, cardiovascular disease, systolic blood pressure, and left ventricular hypertrophy by electrocardiogram [142]. Khosla et al. [143] presented automatic feature selection method that selects robust features and evaluated three automatic feature extraction approaches forward feature selection (FSS), L1 regularized logistic regression (RLR), and conservative mean feature selection (CM). FSS greedily adds one feature at a time and cross-validation is used to select the best features. CM select relevant and robust to variations features using conservative mean by considering monotonic prediction functions over a single feature. SVM and margin-based censored regression (MCR) is used for classification propose. Study showed that MCR provided better accuracy on set of features selecting using conservative mean method. Sung et al. [144] applied MLR, k-nearest neighbor and regression tree on 3577 patients (approximately one-third are prior stroke patient) with acute ischemic stroke. Three-step feature selection (frequency cut-off operation, correlation-based feature selection and expert opinion) process was used and study identified seven predictive features. Panel of stroke neurologists identified the final set of features by consensus. Study identifies stroke severity indices, which represent proxy measures of neurologic impairment that could be used for ischemic stroke patient to adjust strokes severity. Easton et al. [145] developed post-stroke mortality predictive model for or very short term and short/intermediate term mortality. Study identified certain risk factors differentiated between very short term and intermediate term mortality, i.e., age is highly relevant for intermediate term.

[152] presented three-stage ensemble learning framework called clustering-based decision forests, to tackle unbalanced class learning problem for the prediction of seminal quality. First stage deals with the class imbalancing (Tomek Links method is used for data cleaning) and at second stage, balanced dataset is formed by combining majority subset and bagging minority. Finally, random subspace is used to generate a diverse forest of decision trees. Comparison result on UCI fertility dataset showed clustering-based decision forest outperforms decision tree, SVM, MLP, logistic regression and random forest. To identify lifestyle and environmental features that affect the seminal quality and fertility rate, Sahoo and Kumar [153] applied MLP, SVM, evolutionary logistic regression, PCA, SVM+PSO, chi-square, correlation and T-test. To evaluate the seminal quality and fertility rate, decision tree and Naive Bayes, SVM, SVM+PSO and ML is applied on UCI fertility dataset. Result showed that SVM+PSO provides better accuracy as compared to other classifier and also concludes that age, season, surgical interventions, smoking alcoholic habit have more impact on the reduction of fertility rate. In another study, Gil et al. [154] used SVM, MLP and decision tree to predict seminal quality environmental factors and lifestyle data. Naeem [155] used Bayesian belief network (BBN) on UCI fertility dataset to identify effecting parameter. Girela et al. [156] presented MLP based study on data collected by the questionnaire to predict the results of the semen analysis. Sahoo et al. [153], Naeem [155], Gil et al. [154] and Girela et al. [156]studies showed that life style, environmental features and health status strong effect the semen quality and could be used as a measure for early diagnose male fertility issues. IVF is one of the most effective and expensive treatments for addressing infertility causes that requires selection of healthy embryos and continuous patient observation. Predictive modeling could help to reduce the chance of multiple pregnancy and increase the success rate by finding the effecting parameters. The first study on IVF outcome prediction was presented in 1997 by Kaufmann et al. [157] using neural network. Corani et al. [158] and Uyar et al. [159] used Bayesian network for predicting pregnancy after IVF. Corani et al. conclude that embryo viability (top graded) is a more critical factor than uterus and helps to decide how many and which embryos to transfer. Simulation result on 5000 IVF cycles shows that decision-based transfer increases both single pregnancy and double-pregnancy rate; moreover, it also reduces the average number of transferred embryos from 3 to 2.8. In another study, Uyar et al. compared different classifier Naive Bayes, decision tree, SVM, KNN, MLP and radial bases function network (RBF) classifier on dataset of 2275 instances (15 variables) in order to discriminate embryos according to implantation potentials [160]. Study reported that Naive bayes and RBF perform better as compared to other methods. Siristatidis et al used neural network based on LVQ to predict outcome early [161] and presented a web-based System to predict IVF outcome [162]. Durairaj and Kumar used MLP [163] and rough set theory [164] to identify influential parameters that effect the success of IVF outcome [163]. Fertility analysis is performed on 27 different attributes of 250 patients. Gvenir et al. presented RIMARC ranking algorithm to predict the chance treatment as probability of success for IVF treatment on dataset of 1456 patients [165]. It assign the score based on the past cases. Results are compared with random forest and Naive Bayes. BPNN [166], SOM [167] based approach to predict IVF treatment result. As in IVF, the success rate is quite low, thus selection of appropriate parameter, precondition, post condition, embryo viability could help to improve the chance of conception. Intelligent techniques could help to increase the chance of conception in IVF treatment. Nevertheless, more efforts are required to improve the efficacy. Moreover, the studies done so far are based on small dataset, that is not sufficient for efficient prediction.",

New patients' profile is analyzed against existing patterns and mapped to a particular cluster based on the patients medical parameters followed by prediction of medical condition and probability of being prone to that disease in future. Vijayarani and Sudha [171] applied Fuzzy C-means, k-means and weight based k-means algorithm to predict diseases from hemogram blood test samples. Study result showed that weighted k-mean performed better as compared to fuzzy c-mean and k-means. Norouzi et al. [172] used fuzzy c-mean clustering to predict the renal failure progression in chronic kidney based on weight, diastolic blood pressure, diabetes mellitus as underlying disease, and current. The number of fuzzy rules is equal to the number of membership function of input variable. Feng et al. applied K-center clustering method to analyze clinical data and syndrome information of 154 cases of prethrombosis state. Study showed that traditional clinical syndrome differentiation presented 12 syndrome patterns (blood stasis, qi deficiency, damp turbidity, yin deficiency, yang deficiency, phlegm turbidity, damp-heat (toxicity), qi stagnation, blood deficiency, phlegm heat, and cold accumulation) [173]. Result showed that blood stasis and qi deficiency are more commonly seen (49.1%) syndromes than other, whereas cold accumulation is the most rarely seen syndrome. Yang et al. [174] performed fuzzy cluster analysis of Alzheimer's disease-related gene sequences. Study result indicates that the gene sequences interrelated within one group is consistently having closer relationship within the group other than in another group. Shaukat et al.

K-means is used to recognize the hidden patterns of the benign and malignant tumors separately and membership of each tumor to these patterns is calculated and treated as a new feature for SVM training.

Anomaly detection in disease prevention and health promotion typically work with patient records and it has high potentials in mining hidden pattern and forecasting of disease. EHR have anomalies due to several reasons such as physician error, instrumentation error and patient condition [91]. One particular advantage health organizers look is hot spotting of data in a timely manner. Thus, it is a key task to support disease prevention and requires high degree of accuracy. Typical anomaly detection approaches focus on detection of data instances that deviate from the majority of data. So far, several anomaly detection techniques have been presented for the detection of disease outbreaks. Beside its critical need, anomaly detection in health record is a challenging task due dataset complexity (non standard and poor quality data, privacy issue etc). Supervised anomaly detection method requires complete labeled data for both anomaly and normal data. However, in healthcare, it is rarely possible to acquire complete labeled data (as labeling is done manually by expert that require substantial efforts; moreover, may occur they can occur spontaneously as novelties at run time). The other issue is data itself, there are few anomalies as compared to normal one. Supervised method is not a preferable choice for anomaly detection; thus, we are not focusing it.",

In practice, EHRs are much more complex and were not designed as open system where information can be shared with multiple providers. In fact EHRs were developed with aim to replace paper based work and coordinate patient care within a hospital. It is the most urgent needs in the quest for healthcare improvement. Despite its urgent requirement, the implementation of interoperability is slow due to several factors. One real issue in exchanges of data between providers is that most of the EHRs are unable to interface with each other due to unstructured data. Another issues are data standardization, i.e., varied vocabularies, multiple interpretations.

One of the important purposes of P4 medicine is to enable disease prevention among healthy individuals through early detection of risk factors. Initiative to P4 care has been taken via personalized genomics, mobile health technology and pilot projects [224].

With the exponential rise in healthcare data, remote monitoring and smart devices, researchers are facing the big challenges to anonymize the patients sensitive information in order to prevent its misuse or disclosure? i.e. discarding of patient sensitive personal information such information SSN(social security number) MRN (medical record number), name, age etc. makes it very complex and challenging to link the patient data up to unique individual. Even hiding such information, still hacker can easily identify some of patient sensitive information through association. The other way to hide patient sensitive information is the use of differential privacy that helps to restrict the data access to the organization based on their requirement. However, these privacy challenges are factors that, in fact leads to the situations where, data analytics researchers are facing the issue from both legal as well as ethical perspective. The main privacy challenges associated with healthcare data analytics, overrunning the privacy concerns of traditional data. For example, how we can share the patient data while limiting the disclosure as well as ensuring the sufficient data utility, i.e., YOB, Gender, 3-digit Zip code unique for 0.04% of US citizens while DOB, Gender, 5-digit Zip code unique for 87% of US citizens [226]. However, limiting the data access results in unavailability of important information contents that could be important for certain data analytics task. Furthermore, the real-time data is not static but changes over period of time thus, earlier defined prevailing techniques may results in blocking some of the most required information or sharing the patient sensitive information.",

Nature of health data has evolved, currently, EHRs have simplified the data acquisition process with help of latest technology, but don\u2019t have the enough ability to aggregate, transform, or perform analytics on it. Intelligence is restricted to retrospective reporting that is insufficient for data analysis. A plethora of algorithms, techniques and tools are available for analysis of complex data. Traditional machine learning uses statistical analysis based on a sample of a total dataset. Use of traditional machine learning methods against this type of data is not efficient and computationally infeasible. Combination of big healthcare data and computational power lets the analysts to focus on analytics techniques scaled up to accommodate volume, velocity and variety of complex data. During the last decade, there is a dramatic change in the size and complexity of data thus, several emerging data analysis techniques have been presented. At minimum, in healthcare sector, data analytics for big data must have the support of key functions that are necessary for analyzing the big data in real environment. The criteria for the evaluation of platform may includes, the availability, the scalability, the continuity, quality assurance ease of use, ability to manipulate granularity at different levels, privacy and security enablement [227]. Analyzing healthcare in real time is one of the key requirements, however, facing lot of challenges which required researchers attention, i.e., the lag between data collection and processing, dynamic availability of numerous analytics algorithms etc.",

It deduces the relationship without need of specific model and enables the machine to identify the pattern of interest in huge unstructured data. For example, deep learning-based approach learned on its own from the Wikipedia data that California and Texas are US states. It does not require to understand the concept of country and its states [227]. It reflects that how powerful is deep learning over other machine learning approaches.",

Due to the tremendous advancement in IT, wearable technology and other body sensors, increasingly, the data is quite large (moving to big data), unstructured (80% of electronic health data is unstructured), non-standard as well as in multimedia format. This variety in data makes it challenging and interesting for analysis. The quality of healthcare data is concerned for successful prevention system and is due to three main reasons, are incompleteness (missing data), inconsistency (data mismatch between within same or various EHR sources), inaccuracy (non-standards, incorrect or imprecise data) and data fragmentation. Data quality is a group of different techniques that are data standardization, verification, validation, monitoring, profiling and matching. The biggest problem of poor data in health industry has reached at epidemic proportion and introduces several pernicious effects in particular disease prevention. The problem with dirty data are mostly related to missing value, duplication, outliers and stale records. Thus, the first thing before going to data analytics is to perform cleaning for high-quality data and void the analytics until the data is fully clean. Not all healthcare data is collected directly through sensors, large fraction of data is collected through data entry (i.e., patient history, symptoms, physician recommendation, Lab report data entry etc.) that is not prefect as automatics entry and introduces human error in data. Incomplete data and inaccurate data, can also lead to missed or spurious associations that can be wasteful or even harmful to patient care. The opportunities for data error are relatively limited and easily identified by algorithms.",

Empower physicians as well as maintaining the data quality is quite challenging. So far, this data is excluded from data analytics as its available in natural language and not discrete. Transforming this unstructured data into discreet form requires efficient intelligent technology and it is hard problem of medical IT until now. The only way we can use this unstructured and non-standard data by using NLP to translate that data using ICD or SNOMET CT into discrete data. Systrue system provides clinical NLP platform with advance intelligence techniques that allows the healthcare organizations to power up the content and data layer of their applications. AWARE (Ambient Warning and Response Evaluation) is a viewer and clinical decision support tool designed to reduce risk of error.
