Infections can lead to skin eruptions and mimic drug hypersensitivity reactions (DHR), if a drug is taken at the same time. The most of children are labeled as 'drug allergic' after considering only the clinical history. Objective: To diagnose/detect a hypersensitivity or an infection which mimic DHR in children with non-immediate reactions to BL Methods: A prospective survey was conducted in a group of 1026 children with histories of non-immediate reactions to BL by performing patch tests, skin tests, and in case of negative results, drug provocation tests (DPTs). In 300 children, a study was performed to detect infections by viruses or Mycoplasma pneumoniae. Results: Urticaria and maculopapular exanthemas were the most reported nonimmediate reactions. Only 76 (7.4%) of 1026 children had confirmed non-immediate hypersensitivity reactions to BL. Fifty-seven children had positive delayed-reading intradermal tests (18 of these with a positive patch test). Nineteen children had positive DPT. Sixty-six of 300 children had positive tests for viruses or Mycoplasma pneumoniae and 2 of them had a positive allergy work-up. Conclusions: A diagnostic work-up should be performed in all children with nonimmediate reactions to BL, to remove a false label of hypersensitivity. Even though only 57 (5.5%) of 1026 children displayed positive responses to delayed-reading intradermal tests to BL, such tests appear to be useful in order to reduce the risk for positive DPTs.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Abstract"}], "body_text": [{"text": "Drug hypersensitivity reactions (DHR) are adverse effects of drugs that clinically resemble allergic reactions (1) . Clinically, hypersensitivity reactions to drugs are commonly classified as immediate and non-immediate according to the last drug administration and their onset. Immediate reactions occur within the first hour after drug administration and are induced by an IgE-mediated mechanism. Non-immediate reactions occur more than one hour after drug administration and are often associated with a delayed T-cell-dependent type of allergic mechanism. The most common non-immediate reactions are maculopapular exanthemas and delayed-appearing urticaria and/or angioedema. Rarely, severe reactions such as Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS), toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN), acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis (AGEP), and drug reaction/rash with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS) can be elicited (2) (3) (4) (5) (6) . This classification is important in clinical practice for work-up planning. A precise description of the morphology and chronology of the reaction is mandatory. The route of administration, the role of drug metabolites, and the presence of cofactors and coprescribed drugs may accelerate or slow down the onset or progression of a reaction (1, 7) . There is another limitation in children, as, in many cases, parents did not provide a precise description of the beginning of reactions, because the last dose of the culprit drug is usually administered during the night.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 111, "end": 114, "text": "(1)", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}, {"start": 916, "end": 919, "text": "(2)", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}, {"start": 920, "end": 923, "text": "(3)", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 924, "end": 927, "text": "(4)", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 928, "end": 931, "text": "(5)", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 932, "end": 935, "text": "(6)", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}, {"start": 1278, "end": 1281, "text": "(1,", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}, {"start": 1282, "end": 1284, "text": "7)", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": ""}, {"text": "Infection, especially by viruses, can lead to skin eruptions and mimic DHR, if a drug is taken at the same time.

Some non-immediate reactions, including urticarial and maculopapular eruptions, may result from interactions between viruses and antibiotics (25) .
