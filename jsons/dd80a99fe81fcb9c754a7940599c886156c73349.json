Essential medicines save lives and improve health only if they are available, affordable, and properly used. Nowadays, despite the potential health impact of essential medicines, and despite substantial spending on medicines borne by either the government or the patient, lack of access to essential medicines remains a serious public health problem in many developing countries. Over one-third of the population in developing countries in Asia and Africa still do not have regular access to needed medicines. It is even more tragic that most leading causes of death and disability in many developing countries can be prevented, treated, or alleviated with effective essential medicines.",

            "text": "Affordable prices are fundamental for improving access to medicines. Although the prices of essential medicines have significantly decreased in many cases, compared with local purchasing power in many developing countries, they remain too high. The high level of medicine prices stems from several factors, including lack of price competition, a non-transparent markup system, taxes and tariffs on medicines, the preference of health professionals and consumers for branded products instead of cheaper generics, and the lack of alternative sources for patented medicines. 1 Patent protection for pharmaceuticals is the main factor that leads to the restricted supply and overpricing of an essential product. Stricter patent protection has allowed firms to increase market share and charge high prices. The question of constraints as regards pharmaceutical patenting has been a subject of serious concern and has been intensely debated in the WTO meetings, which led to the adoption of the Doha Declaration on the TRIPS Agreement and Public Health at the WTO Ministerial Conference in Doha in November 2001. 2 The Declaration was an important step forward in improving access to medicines. It affirms that the TRIPS Agreement can and should be interpreted and implemented in a manner supportive of the WTO members' right to protect public health and that mechanisms, such as compulsory licensing, can be used to improve access to medicines for all. 3 Compulsory licensing is a non-voluntary licence issued by the State authorising a third party to perform acts covered by the patents against the will of the patent holder. When the TRIPS Agreement entered into force in 1995, around 100 countries had adopted compulsory licensing under national intellectual property law. 4 This measure can be effective in dealing with situations inhibiting access to medicines, for example when a patent holder fails to use the patent in the granting country or when he or she maintains artificially high prices for patented articles. Despite the significant international development, it remains to be seen how the flexibility margins provided by the TRIPS provisions can be used as safeguards to protect public health interests of the poor countries. 5 Effective mechanisms are also required to support countries that are unable to make effective use of compulsory licensing due to the inefficiency of manufacturing capacity.",

It will take a close look at Thailand's experiences with the use of compulsory licensing to increase access to medicines. Since the majority of compulsory licences issued around the world are related to pharmaceutical patents, this chapter will focus on the use of compulsory licensing in the context of a range of public health responses. The chapter is organised and divided into three major sections. First, it discusses the use by Thailand of the compulsory government use licensing to increase access to medicines. The second part examines international rules on compulsory licensing, including the provisions of the Paris Convention, the TRIPS Agreement, and the Doha Declaration on the TRIPS Agreement and Public Health. Third, the paper discusses various legal issues under the Thai Patent Act regarding the compulsory licensing provisions. It also highlights the possible impact, in a broad sense, of the use of legal mechanisms such as compulsory licensing, which aims to effectively maintain fair market competition and dilute the monopoly power of the patent holder. (3) clopidogrel, an anti-clotting drug sold by Sanofi-Aventis and BMS. Clopidogrel, which is sold under a brand name 'Plavix', is one of the world's biggest selling heart disease medicines, with annual sales of US$6 billion. It was estimated that around 200,000 Thai patients were suffering from heart conditions and blood clotting problems that could be treated with the drug. Although the past decade has seen a number of developing countries granting compulsory licences, 6 Thailand was the first developing country that issued a government use licence for a non-HIV medicine. The grant of a compulsory licence over a non-HIV drug reflected Thailand's view that the compulsory licensing can be used for patented medicines treating all sorts of ailments, not only HIV/AIDS. As for drugs required for the treatment of HIV/AIDS, the Ministry of Public Health claimed that only around 20,000 infected people were able to access the HIV treatment. 7 The Thai Government pointed to high drug prices as the main factor for its inability to provide health care coverage. In the 2007 fiscal year, for example, public health accounts for 9.5 % of the total public expenditure, which is equivalent to 4,373 million baht (about US$112 million). 8 With this amount, the Government claimed that it could afford to provide medicines to one-fifth of the total 500,000 of the Thai people living with HIV/AIDS at the companies' price. The issuance of compulsory licences would allow the Ministry of Public Health to treat many more patients because it could switch to a generic version of the drugs that costs, on average, only one-seventh to one-tenth the prices of the patented and branded products, cutting the drug bill by two-thirds. 9 HIV/AIDS is one of the leading causes of death in Thailand. Approximately, 300,000 have already died from HIV/AIDS-related illnesses since Thailand's first case of HIV/AIDS was reported in 1984. 10 The Thai Government started its 6 The developing countries that have issued compulsory licences for patents on essential drugs include the following: Zimbabwe HIV/AIDS campaigns in the early 1990s with emphasis on prevention, which has subsequently proved to be remarkably successful in slowing down the rate of HIV infections. 11 In 1992, the Ministry of Public Health shifted its HIV/AIDS policy from prevention to the subsidisation of anti-retroviral (ARV) treatment and the introduction of locally produced, low-cost ARVs. 12 At the beginning of the campaigns, only mono-ARV therapy (i.e., AZT or zidovudine) was prescribed free of charge for a small number of selected HIV patients. However, drug resistance occurred as the virus evolved to escape the inhibitory effects of the drug, requiring a change of medication. The Ministry was forced to switch to the combination therapy of using two or three drugs, which is more potent in suppressing the virus but also more expensive than a single therapy, to treat HIV/AIDS.",

Many HIV/AIDS patients who received treatment under the national HIV/AIDS campaigns were forced to discontinue their treatment due to the limitations on the capacity of health systems. Since it was clear that the cost of ARVs far exceeds personal and national budgets, the Thai Government felt that it had no choice but to take different approaches to bring down the cost of ARVs, ranging from local manufacture or importing of generic medicines to coercive government use of patented drugs.",

In fact, a licence granted in November 2006 permitted the Ministry to import a batch of 66,000 bottles of generic efavirenz from India at half the price offered by Merck, increasing access to life-saving drugs for an additional 20,000 patients.",

Article 27.1 of the TRIPS Agreement requires equal treatments for both imported and locally manufactured products and so seems to prohibit the imposition of local working requirements. 22 However, there are several reasons to believe that TRIPS does not totally ban local working of patents. First, TRIPS does not limit the right of countries to establish compulsory licensing on grounds other than those explicitly mentioned in the Agreement. Second, the patent-granting country might impose working obligations in accordance with Article 5A of the Paris Convention, which is incorporated into TRIPS by virtue of Article 2.1 of the TRIPS Agreement. 23 Third, as Article 27.1 is a provision containing general rules of patentability, it is subject to specific rules under Article 28 (Rights conferred) and Article 31 (Other use without authorisation of the right holder) of the TRIPS Agreement. 24 According to a general rule of treaty interpretation under the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties, when general principles are in conflict with a specific provision, the specific rule shall take precedence. The particular or specific provision on compulsory licensing such as Article 31 will therefore take precedence over a conflicting general provision of Article 27.1.",

The Doha Declaration on the TRIPS Agreement and Public Health reaffirms that each country has the right to determine what constitutes a ground for government use, such as national emergency or other circumstances of extreme urgency. In fact, a government use provision covers all uses of a patent by the State for either public non-commercial or commercial purposes. It may also be issued in the public interest (e.g., the protection of the environment, public health, nutrition, and concerns of basic importance to the technological, social, and economic development of the country). TRIPS Article 31(f) stipulates that the use of a compulsory licence must be made predominantly for the supply of the domestic market, and the products produced under a compulsory licence may not be exported to another country. But the term \"predominantly\" is tantamount to \"largely\" or \"mainly\" (i.e., more than 50 %), and the export of drugs produced under the compulsory licence is not completely prohibited. This interpretation has been confirmed by the Doha Declaration on TRIPS and Public Health, in particular the decision of the TRIPS Council of 30 August 2003 on the export of drugs to WTO Members with insufficient or no manufacturing capacities in the pharmaceutical sector.",

No guidelines are provided as to what is the reasonable remuneration. The law only requires both parties to enter into negotiations to evaluate the rate of the royalty.

Parties may appeal the decision to the Board of Patents and, further, to the Intellectual Property and International Trade Court within 60 days. 37 The appeal provisions were adopted in order to comply with TRIPS Article 31(i) and (j), which requires that any decision relating to the authorisation of such use and the remuneration \"shall be subject to judicial review or other independent review by a distinct higher authority in that Member\".

Second, TRIPS Article 31(f) stipulates that the use of a compulsory licence must be made predominantly for the supply of the domestic market. This can be interpreted as meaning that less than half of the production authorised by a compulsory licence can be exported. Paragraph 6 of the Doha Declaration and the decisions of the WTO General Council of 2003 and 2005 reaffirm that WTO Members may issue a compulsory licence to produce and export generic medicines to countries with insufficient or no manufacturing capacity in the 36 See supra note 34, p. 21. 37 Patent Act B.E. 2522, sections 50 and 51. 38 Harrelson (2001), p. 192. pharmaceutical sector. 39 The 2005 Decision also waives the payment requirement in the eligible importing Member. 40 The current law of Thailand does not implement the Decisions adopted by WTO. Thailand may wish to adopt a provision permitting import of medicines that it lacks manufacturing capacity to produce. Since there are large generic producers in Thailand, like the GPO, it may consider incorporating into the national patent law provisions enabling the export of pharmaceutical products manufactured under the compulsory licensing.",

Patent rights are granted based on reciprocity between the inventor and society. The compulsory licensing is the very cornerstone of the patent system. While the law grants exclusive rights, the system ensures that such rights will not be abused by the patentee. When the patent holder fails to fulfil his legal obligation, it is justifiable for the State to intervene and allow another person to make essential products available to the public.",

            "text": "Although the compulsory licensing provisions under the patent law of Thailand looks promising, the failure or the success of the system depends upon a strong political will of the Government. The case of Thailand has proved that government action is essential to protect patients by offsetting the patentee's power to extract excessive prices. The non-voluntary licensing encourages private patent owners to negotiate with the government agency in order to provide medicines at a more reasonable price. It is also likely to lead to an increase in the production or import of the generic version of the drug. States, whether developed or developing, generally use legal measures to facilitate the domestic production of patented inventions and at the same time prevent a single company from dominating the market and creating barriers to entry for potential competitors. There is no reason why developing countries like Thailand should not continue to use these legal mechanisms to achieve the aim of guaranteeing public interests. It is therefore strongly recommended that the relevant authorities of developing countries should instigate employing this available mechanism against those patents that are failing to meet domestic demand.",
