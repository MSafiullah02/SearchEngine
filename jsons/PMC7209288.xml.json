C5 convertase is a protein complex containing the C3 cleavage product, C3b, and other complement components that are specified by the initiating pathway [2,3]. Cleavage of C5 by the C5 convertase produces C5a and C5b, which perform distinct effector functions. C5a is an anaphylatoxin and potent proinflammatory mediator [4,5]. C5b sequentially recruits complement components C6, C7, C8, and up to 18 molecules of C9 to form the membrane attack complex (MAC), a transmembrane pore that disrupts the integrity of the target cell\u2019s membrane [6,7].",

REGN3918 binds human and monkey C5 with high affinity and blocks hemolysis induced by both the classical (CP) and alternative (AP) complement pathways. Following a single 15 mg/kg subcutaneous (SC) dose, REGN3918 displayed prolonged pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics in both C5hu/hu mice and cynomolgus monkeys and blocked complement mediated hemolytic activity ex vivo for at least 35 days. Further, switching the dosing of C5hu/hu mice from in-house eculizumab to REGN3918 normalized serum C5 concentrations, and maintained suppression of hemolytic activity ex vivo in the absence of overt toxicity. Pozelimab may offer an alternative therapeutic option for patients suffering from PNH and aHUS, as our PK/PD results suggest that it may require less frequent dosing, normalize serum C5 levels and be efficacious in patients that carry rare C5 variants.",

Surprisingly, the different anti-C5 antibodies exhibited remarkably variable serum half-lives in C5 humanized mice, ranging from 1 to 11 days (Fig 1A, S2C Fig), with REGN3918 having the longest half-life and highest exposure of the antibodies examined. The PK profile of REGN3918 was similar to that of the IgG4P control antibody (T1/2 \u2248 10d). To determine if the difference in PK for these anti-C5 antibodies was due to differences in target-mediated clearance or intrinsic clearance properties of the antibodies, a follow-up PK study was performed in wild-type (WT) C57BL/6 mice. Mice were dosed SC with 15 mg/kg of an anti-C5 or IgG4P control antibody (n = 4) and blood was collected at pre-specified post-injection time-points to measure serum mAb concentrations.

As shown in Fig 1B, compared to serum from WT mice (96% hemolysis) the serum from C5hu/hu mice induced only 11.1% hemolysis in the CP assay, indicating that the complement pathway is compromised in C5hu/hu mice. However, supplementing C5hu/hu mouse serum with 40, 80, or 120 \u03bcg/mL human C3 (hC3) fully restored hemolytic activity (102.8%, 94.6%, and 106.6%, respectively). In comparison, supplementing serum from C5-/- mice with hC3, up to 500 \u03bcg/mL, failed to fully restore hemolysis (30%), indicating that hC3 specifically restores hemolysis through reconstitution of a functional complement pathway in C5hu/hu mouse serum. Consistent with the prolonged half-life of REGN3918, hemolysis was significantly blocked to <10% of baseline over the duration of the 35-day study (Fig 1G). In the REGN3918 group that was terminally bled on day 30, one of the mice had elevated hC5 levels (75 \u03bcg/ml) compared to the other two (4 and 10 \u03bcg/ml), which resulted in the elevated hemolysis observed at this time point compared to d35. Because these assays were performed using terminal bleeds and mice were not serially bled throughout the study, we were unable to determine whether this was an outlier that may have been improperly dosed. In mice dosed with in-house eculizumab, hemolysis was effectively blocked to <10% 10 days after administration; however, CP-mediated hemolysis returned to baseline levels of 75% hemolysis by day 35 (Fig 1G).",

Similar Cmax values were measured for all three antibodies. As a result, monkeys administered REGN3918 had a greater exposure to drug compared to those that received H4H12161P and H4H12170P. Indeed, ex vivo hemolysis assays demonstrated that REGN3918 blocks both CP- and AP-mediated hemolysis activity for up to 35 days post-dosing, whereas the H4H12170P treated group failed to inhibit CP- and AP-hemolytic activity beyond 10 and 20 days, respectively (Fig 2E and 2F). In both mouse and monkey, REGN3918 displayed a prolonged PK/PD compared to other anti-C5 antibodies that bind C5 with similar affinity, however the mechanism underlying these favorable properties remain unclear. One difference between the monkey and mouse models was the transient rise in serum C5 levels that was observed in monkeys after administration of REGN3918 (Fig 2D).

This site is distinct from the reported eculizumab epitope [15], which includes C5-R885 (Fig 3B). Patients with C5 variants at this position, C5R885H or C5R885C, do not benefit from eculizumab treatment as these amino acid substitutions disrupt binding of eculizumab to C5 (Table 2). However, REGN3918 bound to both of these variants with high affinity (422 and 465 pM for C5R885H or C5R885C, respectively) (Table 2). Furthermore, REGN3918 showed identical HDX profiles when tested with C5R885 and the C5R885H variant (Fig 3A).

Such conditions are likely to be self-limiting and the size of the complexes will be influenced by the molar ratio of the antibodies and antigen, with the largest complexes generally forming when the components are at or near equimolar amounts. Here, we examined the size of complexes formed at 5:1:1 molar ratios of REGN3918:in-house eculizumab:C5 by asymmetric flow field flow fractionation using multi-angle laser light scattering detection (A4F-MALLS).

Several additional minor peaks (Peaks 2\u20134) corresponding to heteromeric complexes of in-house eculizumab, C5, and REGN3918 were also detected in this sample, confirming that both in-house eculizumab and REGN3918 can engage the same molecule of C5 to form extended antibody-antigen lattices. However, the majority of these complexes fractionate into two discrete peaks (Peaks 2 and 3; ~22% total peak area) with calculated average molar masses of ~499 kDa and ~841 kDa. Based on the calculated molar masses of the individual components, peaks 2 and 3 likely represent 2:1 and 3:2 mAb:C5 heteromeric complexes, respectively. A broad, poorly-resolved peak (Peak 4) that likely corresponds to a heterogenous distribution of higher order complexes (~1200\u20132100 kDa) was also detected, but only represented ~12% of the total peak area. Taken together, this data suggests that although in-house eculizumab and REGN3918 can form heteromeric complexes with C5, the formation of very large, heterogeneous, and potentially immunogenic complexes is likely minimal when each component is present at concentrations expected in vivo at the time of the initial dose switch. Furthermore, the formation of these very large complexes is likely transient and should steadily decline as eculizumab is cleared from circulation and/or with additional doses of REGN3918.",

Following the switch from in-house eculizumab to REGN3918, the concentration-versus time profile of total hIgG initially resembled the PK profile of REGN3918 during the second post-switch dosing interval (Fig 4A, Table 4).

A common method for engineering pH sensitive antibodies is to introduce histidine residues, which become protonated at lower pH, into the variable domains of antibodies. This strategy was used in the development of ALXN1210, a modified version of eculizumab, that harbors two variable domain histidine mutations and amino acid substitutions in the Fc domain to increase FcRn binding affinity [19]. Though ALXN1210 is reported to have prolonged PK in humans (T1/2 \u2248 32 days), it binds C5 with reduced affinity (17-fold reduction) at neutral pH [19], which may necessitate the administration of higher antibody concentrations to sustain suppression of C5 cleavage in vivo.",

Many factors can contribute the PK/PD behavior of antibody therapeutics including immunogenicity, charge, glycosylation, and the properties of how an antibody engages its target and Fc receptors. To determine whether pH-dependent target engagement may contribute to the prolonged PK/PD profiles of REGN3918, binding of REGN3918 to C5 at neutral and acidic pH was examined using SPR-Biacore. Both in-house eculizumab and REGN3918 showed some effects of low pH on hC5 binding (t1/2 ratio of binding hC5 at pH7.4/pH6.0 = 5.2 and 3.8, respectively), but the effects were similar and did not help explain their differences in clearance in vivo. It has been reported that calcium-dependent binding of antigen can also influence the recycling of antibodies from the endosome 20. Therefore, we also investigated the calcium-dependence of binding between REGN3918 and C5 using SPR-Biacore, but found that the C5 binding affinity of REGN3918 was not significantly influenced by the presence or absence of calcium (KD = 589nM -EDTA, 221nM +EDTA at 25\u00b0C) and indicating that alternative mechanisms may underlie the prolonged PK of REGN3918 in C5hu/hu mice and cynomolgus monkeys.",

In the latter case, total C5 is expected to accumulate in plasma, which may be consistent with the reported ~100 \u03bcg/mL trough concentration of eculizumab, which is sufficient to neutralize ~ 200 \u03bcg/mL of C5 (approximately 3-fold greater than the C5 concentration in the plasma of healthy individuals) [21]. In our study, a single dose of 15 mg/kg in-house eculizumab induced a ~2-fold increase of total C5 in humanized mice at day 7. A similar pattern of serum C5 accumulation was observed in monkeys dosed with LFG316 [22]. In contrast, only a moderate increase in total C5 serum concentrations (~1.2- and 1.8-fold in C5hu/hu mice and monkeys, respectively) was induced by REGN3918. The contribution of other antibody characteristics, such as charge, glycosylation and target engagement to the prolonged PK of REGN3918 remains unknown, but remains an active area of research.",

These data are consistent with X-ray and cryogenic electron microscopy studies showing that R885 is in close proximity to the C5 epitope for eculizumab [15] and help to explain the loss of binding that is observed for in-house eculizumab to rare human C5R885H and C5R885C variants, and the ability of REGN3918 to bind these same variants with high-affinity. The data also provide an understanding for how REGN3918 completely inhibited hemolytic activity in C5 depleted normal human serum exogenously supplemented with C5R885H or C5R885C, whereas in-house eculizumab was not able to block hemolysis under the same conditions. Like eculizumab, REGN3918 is also capable of blocking hemolysis mediated by preformed C5b/C6 complexes.

Dose switching studies in humanized C5 mice demonstrated that switching treatments from in-house eculizumab to REGN3918 was well tolerated and maintained suppression of complement activity. However, combining antibody therapeutics against a soluble antigen has the potential to generate higher order, immunogenic protein complexes. Using molar ratios of in-house eculizumab:REGN3918:hC5 that would be expected at the time of dose switching, A4F-MALS studies demonstrated in-house eculizumab and REGN3918 can form heteromeric complexes with C5. However, the formation of very large, heterogeneous, and potentially immunogenic complexes was minimal and would likely be transient in vivo. These data may support using an excess of pozelimab when dose switching from eculizumab to minimize the potential for inducing serum sickness-like reactions.

However, a disadvantage of these therapies is that there is a significant lag between the time of drug administration and efficacy and the lack of complete C5 silencing with current agents. Therefore, it may be advantageous to combine these novel treatment strategies with existing therapies, such as anti-C5 antibodies, to control hemolysis between doses and in the event of breakthrough hemolysis.

(E) Concentration of C5a in normal human serum 60 min after inducing CP-mediated hemolysis in the presence of different concentrations of REGN3918 (blue), in-house eculizumab (red) and IgG4P control (black). Both REGN3918 and in-house eculizumab, but not IgG4P control, prevented generation of C5a in a dose-dependent manner. (F) The percent block of CP-mediated hemolysis was determined over a range of antibody concentrations for REGN3918 (blue), in-house eculizumab (red) and IgG4P control (black) in C5 depleted normal human serum supplemented with 80\u201390 \u03bcg/mL hC3 and 42 nM of precomplexed, recombinant C5b/6. Data is plotted as mean \u00b1SD. Representative experiments (C-F) are shown that were performed in duplicate at each mAb concentration; each experiment was repeated with multiple sera from different donors (n > 3).",
