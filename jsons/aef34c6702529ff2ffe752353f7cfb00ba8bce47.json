Knowledge of this process informs an understanding of viral physiology and also will serve as the basis for discussion of antiviral therapeutics (8) (Figure 1 ).

It has not been observed to bind other CoV receptors, namely dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4) or aminopeptidase N (APN) (4, 13) . After binding of ACE2, the virus is internalized via endocytosis without access to the host intracellular compartment until a membrane fusion event occurs (4) (Figure 1 ). This process is mediated, at least in part, by another membrane bound protease known as transmembrane serine protease 2 (TMPRSS2), which cleaves the S protein as a necessary step of membrane fusion (7) . Interestingly, the protease activity of the CoV receptors, ACE2, DPP4 and APN, does not seem necessary for membrane fusion (14) .",

For example, the effects of Ace2-deficiency to result in more severe ALI are abrogated by Ace1-deficiency. Ace2 KO mice demonstrated more severe ALI than Ace2 KO ;Ace1 +/-, with further reduction in severity observed in Ace2 KO ;Ace1 -/- (26) . This dose-responsiveness also implies causation. Comparable effects were seen with myocardial dysfunction, as Ace2 KO ;Ace1 +/and Ace2 KO ;Ace1 -/had no evidence of the contractile deficit observed in Ace2 KO mice (30) . Of note, in each of the above cases, however, the animal models were constitutive knockout systems (rather than lineage-specific or inducible knockout). Thus, the ACE2-expressing cell that mediates each phenotypic abnormality has not been determined. CoV2 is able to utilize ACE2 isoforms from swine, bats, civets and humans suggesting a   mechanism whereby the virus may have been initially transmissible from species to species and, with mutation, evolved into a novel pathogen (4) . Notably, murine ACE2 is not a functional receptor for SARS-CoV2; thereby requiring transgenic expression of human ACE2 if mice are to be used as a research model (4). ACE2 undergoes cleavage by the membrane-bound protease ADAM17; resulting in the release of soluble ACE2 into the blood stream (31) . The effects of soluble ACE2 are unclear in humans, however it appears to have favorable effects on lung function in models of ARDS, influenza, and RSV infection (26, 28, 32) . Soluble ACE2 has been studied in a phase II trial of ARDS, but largescale, well-powered clinical outcomes trials are needed (33) . Research is ongoing to determine whether soluble ACE2 may act as a specific therapeutic to SARS-CoV2 in the role of a decoy receptor, as discussed later (34) .",

ACEi or ARB exposure may result in ACE2 protein upregulation in animal models; however not all animal models exhibit this effect. The existing epidemiology of COVID-19 among patients taking ACEi or ARB is confounded by cardiovascular comorbidities which may alter ACE2 and angiotensin II expression (18) .

In hospitalized patients, respiratory symptoms are common and range in severity from cough (60-80%) or dyspnea (19-40%) to ARDS (17-42%) (51) (52) (53) 56, 57) . ARDS rates were only 3.2% in the largest case series, but this may be an underestimate due to a short average follow up time of 12 days, with the vast majority of patients remaining hospitalized at the end of study (48) . ARDS tends to occur ~1-2 weeks into illness and is often precipitous and protracted (51, 53, 57) . For these reasons, and to avoid risk of provider infection with emergent intubation, professional societies recommend early intubation in the event of respiratory decline (41) . Intubation was required in 10-33% in the various Chinese series; however, rates of high-flow nasal cannula and non-invasive mechanical ventilation also were high (35, (51) (52) (53) . These therapies are believed to result in aerosolization and are generally not recommendedconsequently, more patients will be intubated when unable to be supported by nasal cannula or a non-rebreather mask (41) .",

In studies published to date, acute cardiac injury was variably defined as either cardiac troponin elevation >99 th percentile alone or a composite of troponin elevation, ECG or echocardiographic abnormalities (52) (53) (54) (55) (56) 58) . Importantly, many aspects of this endpoint remain undefined including the frequency and severity of associated structural abnormalities. The reported rate of cardiac injury varies between studies, from 7% to 28% of hospitalized patients, a number which is likely partially dependent upon the definition used and the severity of cases at the hospital from which the data was drawn (52) (53) (54) 56) . Notably, patients with evidence of cardiac injury tend to be older with more comorbidities, including baseline hypertension, diabetes, coronary heart disease, and heart failure (54, 56) . Across all studies, cardiac injury is associated with worse outcomes, including ICU admission and death (52) (53) (54) 56) . Based on serial assessment of troponin, researchers in China reported that the median time to the development of acute cardiac injury was 15 days (IQR 10 -17) after illness onset, occurring after the development of ARDS (53) . Of note, early cardiac injury has been reported, even in the absence of respiratory symptoms (60) . In a case series by Shi et al, the mortality rate for those hospitalized with subsequent evidence of cardiac injury was significantly higher than those without cardiac injury (51.2% vs 4.5%, p<0.001) and, along with ARDS, was an independent predictor of death (56) . The magnitude of troponin elevation correlates modestly with the degree of hsCRP elevation (54) . Dynamic increases in troponin were associated with a higher mortality rate (54, 61) . Importantly, the mechanism of cardiac injury may be multifactorial, including demand-ischemia, toxicity from direct viral injury, stress, inflammation, microvascular dysfunction or plaque rupture, as discussed later (Central Illustration).",

Indeed, patients who suffer from type 2 MI compared to type 1 MI have higher mortality rates, which may in part be explained by a higher burden of acute and chronic comorbid conditions in the type 2 MI population (111) . Furthermore, type 2 MI on the background of coronary artery disease (CAD) has a worse prognosis than those patients without CAD. Given the age and comorbidity profile of patients hospitalized with severe COVID-19, it is reasonable to assume that this population has a higher risk of underlying non-obstructive CAD, and therefore the presence of type 2 MI in this population is likely a marker of and contributor to the poor outcomes of COVID-19 patients with troponin elevations (56) .",

While the practical application of these principles is challenging, there appears to be general agreement across the literature on a number of concepts (160, 163, 164) Most recommend development of a triage or scoring system that accounts for acute and pre-morbid prognosis in order to allocate scarce resources to those who are most likely to benefit. The scoring system should utilize objective clinical information, in order to minimize the need for clinical judgement and the risk of introducing inconsistency and bias. The use of the system -and the determination that stems from it -should be transparent to providers, patients and families. Triage should be applied broadly to all patients requiring a particular resource, not just those suffering from the pandemic disease (e.g. applies to decision to use VA ECMO in patients with myocarditis due to COVID-19 and cardiogenic shock from a non-COVID-19 etiology). A random system (e.g. lottery) should be used to break \"ties\" in cases with a similar estimated prognosis, rather than a first-come-first serve approach. Importantly, many advocate that an independent triage physician make the determination to remove the burden from the bedside healthcare team. The triage physician may be supported, as necessary, by a triage committee, comprised of experts in the area of ethics and relevant medical fields.",

Genomic analyses have identified approximately 87% DNA sequence homology between SARS-CoV2 and two SARS-like CoV isolated from Chinese horseshoe bats, bat-SL-CoVZC45 and bat-SL-CoVZXC21, in the Zhejiang province in China (36). Notably, no bats are sold in the market and at the onset of the outbreak in December most bat species in Wuhan would be hibernating. Thus, similar to SARS-CoV1 and MERS-CoV, while bats may be the natural reservoir for SARS-CoV2, there is likely an unidentified intermediate animal host responsible for animal-to-human transmission. Despite closure of the Huanan market on January 1, 2020, the epidemic continued to expand and case clusters with no exposure to the market were reported indicating the occurrence of human-to-human transmission (37). Akin to other respiratory viruses, SARS-CoV2 spreads primarily through small respiratory droplets that are expelled from infected individuals and can travel approximately 3-6 feet. The virus can exist in nature on surfaces and can last for up to 4 hours on copper, 24 hours on cardboard and up to 72 hours on plastic and stainless steel surfaces leading to fomite transmission (38). In fact, the Japanese National Institute of Infectious Disease reported detection of SARS-CoV2 RNA on surfaces in the cabins of symptomatic and asymptomatic passengers on the Diamond Princess up to 17 days after they were vacated (39). Live virus has also been isolated and cultured from fecal specimens raising the possibility of oro-fecal transmission, though corroborating clinical evidence for this method of transmission is lacking (40). Airborne transmission may be facilitated in healthcare settings where aerosol-producing interventions are being performed including endotracheal intubation, bronchoscopy, suctioning, nebulizer treatment, non-invasive positive pressure ventilation and delivery of oxygen via a high-flow nasal cannula. These transmission data support the clinical recommendations that airborne precautions, including use of N-95 masks, should be implemented in these aerosol-producing settings whereas standard droplet precautions should be used during all other encounters with infected individuals (41). In a fully susceptible population, reflected by early stages of the epidemic in China, studies have estimated a basic reproductive number (R o ) of 2.38 for SARS-CoV2, meaning that every infectedindividual is likely on average to spread the virus to 2 to 3 other individuals(42). An outbreak will continue to increase in size if the R o >1. For context, seasonal influenza has an R o of 1.5(43).",

The immune response to acute viral infection and the accompanying surge of cytokines and inflammatory mediators can lead to localized arterial inflammation which is more pronounced within coronary plaques(61,103). Entry of viral products into the systemic circulation, also known as pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs), can cause innate immune receptor activation which can cascade into activation of immune cells resident in preexisting atheromata driving plaque rupture.(104) Viral PAMPs are also believed to activate the inflammasome, resulting in conversion of pro-cytokines into the biologically active cytokines(105).

Early reports have demonstrated severely elevated levels of inflammatory biomarkers and cytokines, including IL-6, C-reactive protein (CRP), tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-\u03b1, interleukin (IL)-2R and ferritin(112). Higher levels of these biomarkers are associated with more severe COVID-19 manifestations and worse outcomes. A proposed theoretical model of COVID-19 disease progression divides the course into three overlapping yet distinct stages. In this staging framework, stage I represents early viral infection with associated constitutional symptoms. In stage II, direct viral cytotoxicity of the pulmonary system with associated inflammatory activation leads to prominent respiratory system compromise, associated with dyspnea and ultimately acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and hypoxia. With ACE2 receptors serving as an entry-point for viral replication in type II pneumocytes, the pulmonary system becomes the maiden organ of injury. If the host is unable to clear the virus via a productive and protective immune response, COVID-19 progresses to stage III -a hyperinflammatory state associated with profound elevations in inflammatory biomarkers. Patients who reach stage III have severe COVID-19 manifestations with multiorgan dysfunction and cytokine storm, with immune dysregulating akin to that seen in cytokine release syndrome (CRS) associated with chimeric antigen receptor T-cell (CAR-T) therapy(112)(113)(114)(115)(116).",

A retrospective analysis of 84 patients with ARDS secondary to SARS-CoV2 observed an association with improved survival in patients who received solumedrol(51). In the absence of robust evidence, major professional society guidelines do not recommend routine use of corticosteroids in treatment of COVID-19 but rather restricting its use to patients with other indications for steroids, such as refractory shock or advanced ARDS(41). Clinical trials are ongoing to examine the safety and efficacy of corticosteroids in hospitalized non-critically ill COVID-19 patients (Clinical Trials.gov ID: NCT04273321) and in those with ARDS (Clinical Trials.gov ID: NCT04323592).",

Additionally, this class of agents have antiinflammatory effects by inhibiting cytokine release(149). An agent in the class, baricitinib, is being studied in an open-label non-randomized pilot study in patients with COVID-19 (NCT04320277). Currently, a 3-arm randomized control trial is being launched to compare anakinra monotherapy, emapalumab monotherapy and standard of care (NCT04324021).Anakinra is a recombinant monoclonal antibody that blocks IL-1 receptors. It has been used to treat autoimmune conditions including juvenile idiopathic arthritis as well as recurrent pericarditis. Emapalumab is a fully human anti-gamma interferon monoclonal antibody that has been approved by the FDA for treatment of primary hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis, a disease reminiscent of the hyperinflammatory state seen in advanced COVID-19.

Conflicting data exist regarding the effect of renin-angiotensin-aldosterone-inhibitors (RAASi), including ACE-I and ARB, on ACE2 activity/levels in various human tissues and the resultant susceptibility to infection with SARS-CoV2 (18). The totality of the available data is insufficient to recommend cessation of ACE-I/ARB in individuals with an existing indication for life-prolonging therapy with these drugs and major societies have strongly recommended continuation of ACE-I/ARB therapy. An open label randomized trial is on the way to examine the effect of prophylactic ACE-I/ARB withdrawal in COVID-19 naive individuals with essential hypertension as the sole indication for treatment on the risk of infection and subsequent complications (NCT04330300). Based on the pre-clinical data described earlier in this review, two paired trials are currently underway examining losartan therapy in COVID-19 who are ambulatory (NCT04311177) and hospitalized (NCT04312009).",

Host and SARS-CoV2 proteases cleave the replicase to in non-structural proteins, including the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp). RdRp mediates SARS-CoV2 RNA replication and amplification.

Live attenuated viral vaccines are likely to induce significant immune response but may carry risk of disease, particularly in immunosuppressed individuals. Inactivated \"whole\" viral or subunit vaccines are relatively easy to develop, but do not induce immediate or complete immunity, typically requiring multiple doses to promote humoral, but often not cellular, immunity. Immunity may also wane over time, requiring booster dosing. Viral vector-based vaccines would employ other viruses, such as the vaccina virus (a poxvirus used for the smallpox vaccine) or adenovirus, to display SARS-CoV2 antigens. This strategy can promote robust cytotoxic T cell responses but may fail in the face of the pre-existing immunity to or toxicity of the viral vector(159). Nucleic acid-based strategies, which work through delivery of DNA or RNA that are translated by host machinery to produce viral protein antigens, are relatively simple to design but may be limited by toxicity and/or stability concerns.Of note, at this time, there are no approved DNA or RNA vaccines for humans.
