As of April 10, 2020, the Indian Council of Medical Research designated 146 government testing laboratories and 67 private laboratories for COVID-19 testing. 3 On March 24, 2020, a countrywide lockdown was announced and went into effect immediately.",

The number of pharmacists -clinical and staff, working in hospitals have increased steadily in the past decade with the advent of the Pharm.D program and due to hospital accreditation requirements. Lacunae in pharmacy education, training, and lack of resolution around pharmacist roles present challenges in providing health services to patients. This lack of differentiation creates challenges around role specifications and appropriate placement of clinically trained Pharmacy Professionals (PP) along with challenges of their incorporation in Emergency Preparedness & Response (EP&R).",

Engaging PPs in policy making and developing a cadre of EP&R professionals to serve and respond is the first step to address this gap in India's EP&R to COVID-19 and beyond. A welcome initial step was taken by the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare by requesting the Pharmacy Council of India, the accrediting body for Pharm.D education to prepare a state-wise national list of pharmacists who can be enrolled as part of the COVID warriors health force and by making the State Pharmacy Councils as nodal offices (https://covidwarriors.gov.in/). Inclusion of PPs in policy making is encouraged to enable professional expansion (for e.g. in the U.S., many states have implemented collaborative practice agreements allowing PPs to bill for services such as point-ofcare testing and immunizations). 17 Training through continuing education programs is needed to keep PPs updated with current knowledge and practices. Such training could include EP&R modules to address medical and pharmaceutical waste management, minimize contagion, and provide accurate information to patients and communities. Currently, few schools of pharmacy address public health and community health in their curricula. Universities, accreditation bodies and educational boards should consider including EP&R in curricula to address the lacuna in training. 18 In response to emergencies, the National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA) 19 was enacted in 2005 to address disaster preparedness and response, including a National Disaster Response Force (NDRF) 20 that has 12 battalions trained and equipped to respond to natural and man-made disasters. Currently, there is no mention of PPs in the Act or among the NDRF battalions. It is recommended that PPs be included in the NDRF battalions and on task force planning and responses to chemical, biological, radiological, nuclear emergencies. Further, the Indian Council of Medical Research received U.S $500 million from the World Bank's fast track COVID-19 facility. PPs should be included as stakeholders in the development of EP&R measures through this program. 21 ",

With the advent of the Pharm.D, these roles could be further expanded into provision of patient care and population health interventions such as screenings for infectious and certain noncommunicable diseases, addressing medication adherence, evaluating medication utilization, providing stewardship on antimicrobial resistance, leading to additional support to the healthcare sector. For instance, collaborative practice agreements (CPPA) with physicians would enable PP to assess medication adherence, develop patient care plans including medication safety, monitor health outcomes, among others. 17 Ethics and Integrity: Reports in media indicating challenges of hoarding hydroxychloroquine, chloroquine, azithromycin, vitamin C by healthcare professionals and public emerged in several parts of the country 26 following ICMR guidelines on their prophylaxis in COVID-19. 27 In response, the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare imparted Schedule H1 status for Hydroxychloroquine (https://www.mohfw.gov.in/pdf/RevisedNational ClinicalManagementGuidelineforCOVID1931032020.pdf) thereby limiting its demand and inappropriate use. India's pharmaceutical manufacturing sector was directed to increase the output of these drugs to meet surges in demand. Steps were taken to ensure that local demands were met prior to exports to countries in need. In our study, hoarding or price increases were not reported. Nevertheless, rigorous training on professional ethics and integrity needs to be reinforced in pharmacy students and healthcare professionals through ongoing and continuing education.",
