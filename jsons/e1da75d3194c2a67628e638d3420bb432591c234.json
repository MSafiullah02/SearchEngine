This is a modest estimate and the actual incidence of human rabies may be 100 times greater than officially recorded (7) . The public health impact of rabies has been underestimated (8) . Since rabies is fatal in all victims, diagnosis is often based on clinical manifestations only.

Post-mortem diagnosis requires a FAT for detection of RABV in brain tissue. Definitive diagnosis of rabies infection using the \"gold standard\" of FAT as approved by both WHO and OIE is expensive and requires infrastructure and well-trained technicians (9, 10) . Since many rabies endemic countries lack the above-mentioned requirements for the diagnosis of rabies, the exact number of rabies patients remains obscure.
