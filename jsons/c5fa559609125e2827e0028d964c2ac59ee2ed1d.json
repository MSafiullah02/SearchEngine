A rapid detection for influenza A and B antigens was negative from a throat swab. Serological tests were negative for IgM to Legionella pneumophila serotype 1 (LP1), mycoplasma, chlamydia, Q fever rickettsia, adenovirus, respiratory syncytial virus, parainfluenza virus and influenza A and B. Cultures of blood, urine and sputum were negative. Initial blood tests showed normal white blood cells (WBC) of 7 \u00d7 10 9 /L with decreased lymphocyte of 0.406 \u00d7 10 9 /L (reference 1.1-3.2 \u00d7 10 9 / L), procalcitonin was less than 0.25 ng/mL and Creactive protein was 182 mg/L (reference < 8 mg/L).

High fever and increasing respiratory distress prompted a low-dose chest computed tomography with consent from the family and abdomen protection, which revealed massive left lung consolidation and patchy infiltrates in the right middle and lower lobes (Fig. 1) . Severe pneumonia was diagnosed. On day 5, the patient's respiratory rate was about 35 breaths/min with a trough SpO2 of 70% while breathing 12 L/min oxygen through a non-rebreathing facemask.

HAdV are a common cause of lower respiratory tract infection in children, immunocompromised adults 3 and adults in closed settings (particularly those in the military). 4 For immunocompetent adults, prospective studies in the published work (pregnant women were excluded) showed that the adenovirus, especially serotype 7, is an important cause of CAP, accounting for 3.7% (18/487), 4% (11/304), and 5% (48/969) of CAP.
