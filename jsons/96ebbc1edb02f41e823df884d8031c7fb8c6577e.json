In the early 1970s, Kerr et al, 1 observed a single-cell-death phenomenon that occurred in the dying cells of healthy tissues, as well as in cells associated with teratogenesis, neoplasia, tumor regression, atrophy, and involution. The term apoptosis, from Greek origins (apo 5 for, ptosis 5 falling), was chosen to describe the cellular process of programmed cell death. [1] [2] [3] Apoptosis is a tightly regulated intracellular program in which cells destined to die activate enzymes that degrade the cell's DNA and nuclear and cytoplasmic proteins. 4 Programmed cell death eliminates unwanted cells or potentially reactive cell lines either before or after maturation. This process is vital to fetal and embryonic development and to tissue remodeling. 3 Cell populations that normally have a high rate of proliferation, such as the intestinal epithelium, depend upon apoptosis to maintain the necessary number of cells. 5 The number of activated immune cells must be controlled to contain the inflammatory response. 6, 7 Hormone-dependent apoptosis occurs during estrus and causes prostatic atrophy after castration. 8 Kerr et al 1 observed that apoptotic cells share many morphologic features distinct from those in necrotic cells. Cells undergoing apoptosis exhibit 1 or more of the following: cell shrinkage, chromatin condensation and nucleosomal fragmentation, and bubbling of the plasma membrane (blebbing). Biochemical features of apoptosis include DNA fragmentation, protein cleavage at specific locations, increased mitochondrial membrane permeability, and the appearance of phosphatidylserine on the cell membrane surface. 3, 9 There is an increase in mitochondrial permeability leading to the release of pro-apoptotic proteins and subsequent formation of apoptotic bodies. The resulting membrane-bound apoptotic bodies are consumed by neighboring cells or by macrophages. Apoptosis is a single-cell event, and does not induce an inflammatory reaction.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 175, "end": 176, "text": "1", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}, {"start": 515, "end": 518, "text": "[1]", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}, {"start": 519, "end": 522, "text": "[2]", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}, {"start": 523, "end": 526, "text": "[3]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 696, "end": 697, "text": "4", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 899, "end": 900, "text": "3", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1067, "end": 1068, "text": "5", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 1163, "end": 1165, "text": "6,", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}, {"start": 1166, "end": 1167, "text": "7", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}, {"start": 1264, "end": 1265, "text": "8", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}, {"start": 1780, "end": 1782, "text": "3,", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1783, "end": 1784, "text": "9", "ref_id": "BIBREF8"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Introduction"}, {"text": "Apoptosis must be distinguished from necrosis, which is also a form of cellular death. In contrast to apoptosis, necrosis is not a genetically programmed function, it affects groups of neighboring cells, and produces an inflammatory response. 10 The death of a cell by necrosis leads to the release of alarm signal molecules that stimulate 1 or more pattern-recognition receptors on macrophages, dendritic cells, and natural killer cells. 11 The presence of necrotic cells in a tissue is frequently interpreted by the immune system as dangerous and therefore acts as a signal to initiate an immune response. 11 Unlike apoptosis, with necrosis there is cellular swelling with loss of cell membrane integrity, organelle swelling, and lysosomal leakage. The degradation of DNA is random and lysed cells are ingested by macrophages. 12 Whether a cell survives or dies by apoptosis is determined by the balance between pro-apoptotic (stress or death) signals and anti-apoptotic (mitogenic or survival) signals within and around the cell (see Tables 1 and 2 ). Cell injury via oxygen deprivation, heat stress, chemical agents, radiation, infectious agents, genetic derangements, nutritional imbalances, immunologic reactions (eg, anaphylaxis), and other types of severe cell stress will initiate the pro-apoptotic pathways. 4 Dysregulation of apoptosis can affect the equilibrium between cell growth and cell death, resulting in organ dysfunction. Apoptosis in health is a finely balanced process. Too much or too little apoptosis contributes to disease. Apoptosis of infected cells is part of the host's defense mechanism. Some viruses and bacteria, however, have developed the ability to inhibit the infected cell's apoptotic mechanisms and protect their environment. 13 Inhibition of apoptosis is linked to uncontrolled cell growth and the formation of many types of cancer. In humans, excessive apoptosis is linked to stroke and Alzheimer's disease. 14 The activation or restoration of apoptosis is emerging as a key strategy for treatment of cancer and other diseases. [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] Our aim is to provide a basic review of the literature regarding the mechanisms and regulation of apoptosis. Extracellular ligand-directed or intracellular stressinduced stimuli can activate this highly regulated process. Caspases play a central role by initiating and executing the intracellular cascade of events that result in protein and nucleic acid cleavage, and ultimately, cell death. Many of the key apoptotic proteins have been identified, however there is still much to learn regarding the molecular mechanisms of action or activation of these proteins.

There are 3 features that characterize apoptosis: protein cleavage or hydrolysis, breakdown of nuclear DNA, and recognition of the apoptotic cell by phagocytic cells. 4 The cleavage of proteins primarily occurs with the activation of a family of cysteine proteases called caspases (Cysteine ASPartate-Specific ProteASEs). 8 Caspases are synthesized in an inactive form and activated by specific initiation mechanisms. 10 Programmed cell death can also result from caspase-independent mechanisms triggered by cell membrane receptor-ligand binding or damage to cell organelles.

These cell DRs belong to the tumor necrosis factor (TNF) receptor superfamily, with the Fas receptor and TNFR1 as the most intensely studied members. 15 Fas is present on a variety of cell types including activated B cells and T cells. 36 Ligands that activate pro-apoptotic receptors include the Fas ligand (FasL) and TNF-a [37] [38] [39] [40] [41] [42] (Table 1 ). FasL is expressed by a variety of cell types, including activated T cells and natural killer cells. 36 TNF-a is produced predominantly by activated monocyte/macrophages and lymphocytes. 26 The intracellular portion of the DR is known as the death domain (DD). Once 3 or more DR-ligand complexes bunch, their DDs are brought into close proximity and a binding site for an adaptor protein is formed. The adaptor protein is specific for that receptor (eg, Fas-associated DD [FADD] or TNF receptor-associated DD [TRADD] ). This complex of ligand-receptor-adaptor protein is called the death-inducing signaling complex (DISC), leading to the recruitment and assembly of initiator caspases 8 and 10. 43-46 These caspases can now undergo self-processing and release active caspase enzyme molecules into the cytosol.

Specific caspases are found in relatively large amounts as inactive precursors called procaspases within the cytoplasm. Procaspases can be activated by 1 of 3 methods: (1) exposure to another activated caspase, (2) autocatalysis, or (3) association with an activator protein, such as caspase-9, Apaf-1, and cytochrome c. 2 The caspases involved in apoptosis are subdivided into initiator caspases (2, 8, 9, 10) and effector (or executioner) caspases (3, 6, 7) . The initiator caspases are activated by adaptor-mediated self-cleavage. The specific interaction of caspases and activator protein promotes the formation of a multimeric complex that is necessary to bring 2 caspase precursors together to activate each other and produce an active tetramer. 72, 73 This caspase cascade strategy of activation is used by the initiator caspases to cleave and activate the effector caspases. 65 When activated, the effector caspases selectively cleave a restricted set of target proteins that follow an aspartate residue. In most cases, this results in inactivation of the target protein. However, they can also activate proteins, either directly by cleaving off a negative regulatory domain, or indirectly, by inactivating a regulatory subunit. 2, 74 Effector caspases cause cytoskeletal filament aggregation, clumping of ribosomal particles and rearrangement of rough ER to form a series of concentric whorls as seen on electron microscopy (Table  1) . 10, 65 Caspases are also responsible for cleaving nuclear lamins required for nuclear shrinking and budding, and for loss of cellular shape and membrane blebbing. 2, 75, 76 Caspases will activate caspase-activated DNAases (CAD) that breakdown nuclear DNA, the second feature of apoptosis. CAD exists in an inactive form (ICAD) in the nucleus when it is bound to a subunit. Once the effector caspase-3 is activated it migrates to the nucleus and cleaves the inhibitory subunit thus activating CAD. 77 CAD is the nuclease responsible for breaking down the DNA into 50-300-kb pieces that are then cleaved into 180-200-bp fragments by endonucleases. It is these fragments that compose the DNA ladders visualized by agarose gel electrophoresis, a biochemical hallmark of apoptosis. 10 Alternate pathways Granzyme B: There is an accessory method of triggering apoptosis by the serine protease granzyme B, a lymphocyte granular enzyme expressed by activated cytotoxic T lymphocytes and natural killer cells. Granzyme B will bind to its cell surface receptor, an insulin-like growth factor II receptor, causing endocytosis of the protease. It remains in the endocytic vesicle until stimulation by an activated cytotoxic T cell. 78 Activation of almost all of the activator and effector cas-pases can occur through the action of the granzyme B pathway. A number of caspase sensitive targets, as well as other unique proteins not normally cleaved by caspases, can be cleaved directly by granzyme B. 74, 79 This mechanism is dependent on mitochondrial disruption, as overexpression of anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 will halt this process.

They are synthetic peptides that are resistant to enzymatic degradation and are being used for their pro-apoptotic effects on Bid as well as their antagonism of IAPs. 144, 145 In cancer treatments, there are trials attempting to block the overexpression of Bcl-2 because it is the cessation of normal apoptosis that leads to the growth of tumors. In addition to the direct effects on the apoptotic programs, discoveries are being made that allow chemotherapeutics to act synergistically with various anti-apoptotic therapeutics. 78 Treatment strategies for sepsis had previously targeted the hyperimmune phase rather than the hypoimmune phase. Addressing apoptosis can be therapeutically challenging because targeted blockade of apoptosis in lymphocyte populations must be specific enough to primarily target those cell populations undergoing increased apoptosis and to be sufficiently transient to prevent the risk of malignant transformation associated with prolonged blockade of apoptosis. 146 This poses a challenge to try to target specific pathways. Attempts at blocking the circulating mediators and cytokines that induce apoptosis have not been successful because of the inherent redundancy and fail-safe mechanisms of the apoptotic pathways. 119 Caspase inhibitors show promise because caspases are common factors to many apoptotic pathways. Broad-spectrum caspase inhibitors have been shown to prevent lymphocyte apoptosis and improve survival in animal models of sepsis. 13, 147, 148 Caution must be expressed, though, because increased dosages of caspase inhibitors can cause cytotoxicity and TNF-a induced injury. 149, 150 Gene therapy studies have shown that overexpression of Bcl-2 delays or blocks apoptosis and improves survival in septic mice. 10, 151, 152 Other therapies target Akt, a regulator of cell proliferation and death.
