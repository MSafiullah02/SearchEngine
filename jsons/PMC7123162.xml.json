The private villas of wealthy citizens boasted indoor plumbing, with flush toilets, and baths were often included in their dream homes, sometimes staffed by one or more athletes. Ordinary citizens made wide use of public baths. A water commissioner named Frontinus (40\u2013103 CE) reported that under his jurisdiction there were 856 baths in Rome alone. Visitors to the baths gave their belongings to slaves, and then entered the cold-plunge-bath. After exercising in this pool, they moved into a warm and humid room where they sweated and were massaged. They could then progress to a yet warmer room with a mosaic floor immediately above the furnace, finishing with a brief spell of dry sweating in the hottest room of the facility. Women used an adjoining, smaller set of baths.",
