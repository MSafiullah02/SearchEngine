The first edition of the experts [13] divided CT manifestations into three stages: early, progressive, and severe according to the extent and features of the pulmonary abnormalities. However, it did not clarify the relationship between the extent of inflammation and the clinical presentation of the patient.

We used the same method to quantify pulmonary inflammation and correlate to the clinical classifications. There was significant difference in scores between common type and severe-critical type (p < 0.001). However, there was also a score overlap between the two groups, which showed that 8 cases in the common type had a higher score, and 5 cases in the severe-critical type had a lower score. Among 8 cases of common type, 7 cases had fibrotic lesions which indicated that the lesions began to be repaired, and all of the 8 patients were less than 70 years old (range 36\u201365, average 52.5 years), none of them had pulmonary complications. The specific situation of 5 patients in a severe-critical type which had a lower score was as follows: 3 of the 5 patients were over 70 years old; among them, 1 patient was a female smoker with diabetes, aged 80 years old, with moderate emphysema and a small amount of pleural effusion; 1 patient was a 70-year-old female, with emphysema and a small amount of pleural effusion as well; the other one was 75-year-old female with high blood pressure; the forth case was a 44-year-old male without any underlying disease; however, CT images showed only progressive lesions such as ground-glass opacification and consolidation without any fibrotic lesions (Fig. 5). The last case was a 58-year-old female without any underlying disease; further analysis was needed to find out the cause of clinical severity. Overall, we believe that many factors, such as advanced age, underlying diseases, and pleural effusions, would relate to the clinical severity, which call for a comprehensive evaluation.",

In the review of several recent published literature of COVID-19 in Wuhan, China, all patients reported in articles had ground-glass opacities in the lungs. Huang et al reported 41 infected cases in Wuhan, all had pneumonias [1]. Chen et al reported 99 confirmed cases in Wuhan with 74 bilateral pneumonias and 25 unilateral pneumonias [19]. However, the most recent report from Guangzhou had similar findings, which showed 23.6% confirmed patients without abnormalities on chest CT [20]. To further explore our data, we found several characteristics. Nine cases had a short time interval from onset to the latest CT examination with a range of 0\u20137 days, which indicated that the chest CT could be normal at the early phase. Another 9 cases had a longer time interval from onset to the latest CT scan with a range of 8\u201319 days. The negative findings may not relate to the shorter onset time. It remains to be further explored whether the CT negativity may relate to the degree of infection and autoimmunity. Finally, the last 6 patients had no symptoms. These patients were negative in both clinical and imaging, suggesting that some cases were potential sources of infection, which should be paid more attention to.",
