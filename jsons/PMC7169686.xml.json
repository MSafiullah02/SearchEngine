Therefore, larger volumes from inactivated samples were tested to increase the sensitivity and the dynamic range of the assay as shown in Table 1. Nonetheless, no viable virus was detected post pathogen inactivation treatment even when 15 to 30 mL of plasma was tested.

No CPE was observed from the negative control or inactivated samples even on Day 7 postinoculation or after passaging for three times compared to the positive or pretreatment samples, which completely destroyed all cells by Day 3 (data not shown). To further confirm these results, the viral genomic RNA titer was measured by RT\u2010qPCR from supernatant collected on Day 3 from all samples in the three consecutive passages. As shown in Table 3, viral genomic titer in positive control and pretreatment samples ranged from 9.03 to 10.51 and 9.48 to 10.22 log RNA copies/mL, respectively, in the three passages indicating presence of replicating viruses in these samples.

Using IBS, we were able to show a mean reduction of 4.67 \u00b1 0.25 log in MERS\u2010CoV infectious titers (ranging from 4.51 to 5.04) in plasma (Table 1) which is approximately 1.5 logs higher than the minimum reduction titer recommended by the European Committee of Blood Transfusion,43 suggesting an inactivation capacity of MERS\u2010CoV in plasma with a high safety margin. In contrast to the infectious titer, the genomic titer was only affected slightly by the pathogen inactivation treatment (Table 2). The amotosalen/UVA process effectively crosslinks nucleic acids, but does not break the strands. Therefore, to ensure that there are no remaining amounts of infectious virus particles, the collected supernatants were passaged three times after inactivation for 3 days. The absence of CPE even after 7 days of incubation in cultures inoculated with the posttreatment samples suggests that there is no infectious MERS\u2010CoV remaining in these samples. No viral genomes were detected in the supernatant of cell cultures inoculated with posttreatment samples even after multiple passages mostly due to nonreplicating viral genome and degradation of viral RNA during the incubation period. This is in contrast to the pretreatment and the positive control samples that showed a high level of viral RNA after incubation in all three passages. This demonstrates the loss of infectious virus through passaging and the successful inactivation of infectious particles by the IBS treatment.",

A recent study investigated the inactivation of MERS\u2010CoV in plasma using riboflavin and UV light.47 The study showed a reduction of at least 4.07 and at least 4.42 log in viral titers for pooled and individual donor plasma, respectively. However, passaging experiments after pathogen reduction were not conducted, so complete inactivation of all infectious particles cannot be taken for granted. Several previous studies have also proved the efficiency of IBS in inactivating a large number of pathogens (viruses, bacteria, and parasites). The study described here adds MERS\u2010CoV to the list of pathogens that can be inactivated by IBS. Taken together with previously published work, our data show that IBS could represent an economically and logistically efficient protective solution to reduce the risk associated with the circulation of MERS\u2010CoV in the Arabian peninsula and the potential transmission of not only MERS\u2010CoV but also other known or unknown pathogens for which there is no commercially available screening assays.",
