            "text": "PPR is one of the most contagious and fatal disease of animals primarily affecting small ruminants and is currently endemic in most parts of Asia, Africa and the Middle East. For a long time in the past, PPR had been misdiagnosed as rinderpest. A major break-through in the history of animal plague took place in 1942 when Gargadennec and Lalanne, while working at Ivory Coast, identified a disease in sheep and goats that was similar to but different from rinderpest and was not transmissible to cattle. This disease was later named as peste des petits ruminants (PPR). In the past, it had several common names such as goat plague, ovine rinderpest, plague of small ruminants, Kata and peste des petits ruminants (PPR). PPR the French denomination stands for small ruminant plague has been adopted as the scientific denomination of the disease and is commonly used worldwide. In 1956, Mornet and colleagues demonstrated that PPR and rinderpest viruses are closely related antigenically (Mornet et al., 1956b). Causative agent, the PPR virus (PPRV) was isolated for the first time in sheep cell culture in 1962 by Gilbert and Monnier (Gilbert and Monnier, 1962a) while Bourdin and Laurent-Vautier (Bourdin and Laurent-Vautier, 1967) observed the virus for the first time under the electron microscope. PPRV was classified as a member of the genus morbillivirus under the subfamily Paramyxovirinae, the family Paramyxoviridae and the order Mononegavirales in 1979 (Gibbs et al., 1979). There are seven known members of the genus morbillivirus: measles virus (MV), rinderpest virus (RPV), PPRV, canine distemper virus (CDV), cetacean morbillivirus (CeMV), phocine distemper virus (PDV) and feline morbillivirus (FMV) (Kumar et al., 2014). Morbilliviruses cause disease both in humans and animals (Diallo, 1990).",

Whereas PPRV strains belonging to all four genetic lineages are prevalent in Africa, all PPRV strains from Asia belong to type IV lineage (Kumar et al., 2014). Introduction of Asian lineage (type IV) of PPRV into Africa was reported for the first time in 2008 from a PPR outbreak in Morocco (Kwiatek et al., 2011). PPRV lineage type III has also been reported only once from Asia (Shaila et al., 1996). Lineage classification may be useful in monitoring PPRV circulation and tracing the source of outbreaks. Although a perfect cross protection is believed to occur among various PPRV strains, lineage classification could help in preparing homologous vaccine for adequate immunization.",

            "text": "The incubation period of PPR is 2\u20137 days (Kumar et al., 2014) and the disease is characterized by high fever, development of vesicular lesions on tongue and gums, ocular discharge, leukopenia, diarrhea, and dyspnea (Kumar et al., 2004, Mariner et al., 2016). Pregnant animals may abort. Animals usually die within 4\u20136 days after the onset of fever. PPR leads to high morbidity (up to 100%) and mortality (up to 90%) (Baron et al., 2016, Kumar et al., 2014) and occurs round the year, though a seasonal variation has been observed (Abubakar et al., 2009). The clinical disease may be complicated by secondary invaders such as Pasteurella spp., Escherichia coli and Mycoplasma spp. (Kumar et al., 2014). The clinical signs of PPR mimic other diseases like foot-and-mouth disease (FMD), capripox, contagious pustular dermatitis, bluetongue and contagious caprine pleuropneumonia (Singh et al., 2009), therefore, differential diagnosis should be confirmed by appropriate laboratory tests. Morbilliviruses are highly infectious and lead to profound immune suppression (de Vries et al., 2015), however the individuals that survive infection usually develop lifelong immunity (Kerdiles et al., 2006).",

Discharges from the nose, eyes and mouth contain high amount of virus that releases fine infective droplets in the air which could be inhaled by animals in close contact so as to become infected (Abegunde and Adu, 1977). Although close contact is the most important mode of transmission; contaminated water, feed troughs and bedding are additional sources of infection. The indirect transmission is unlikely as the virus is heat-labile and sensitive to lipid solvents (Lefevre and Diallo, 1990). The possibility of transmission of infection at market places is high wherein small ruminants from different sources gather for trade.",

Cattle and pigs seroconvert upon contact with infected sheep and goats, but without detectable clinical disease (Nawathe and Taylor, 1979, Taylor and Abegunde, 1979), therefore, acting as dead-end hosts (Gibbs et al., 1979). However, evidences of pyrexia and oral lesions in calves (Mornet et al., 1956a, Mornet et al., 1956b) and fatal infection in buffaloes (Govindarajan et al., 1997) have been observed during experimental infection of PPRV. Detection of PPRV antibodies in animals other than natural hosts such as cattle, buffalo and camel suggests natural transmission of the PPRV among these species under field conditions (Balamurugan et al., 2014a, Khalafalla et al., 2010, Khan et al., 2008, Woma et al., 2016a, Woma et al., 2016b). The PPRV identified from camels have been found to be phylogenetically identical to small ruminants (Albina et al., 2013). Occasionally the virus may overcome the innate resistance of the host to produce clinical disease. Of late, the potential of camels to act as a reservoir host for PPRV infection has also been suggested (Abraham, 2005).",

Likewise, subclinical infection has been reported in Nilgai (Tragelaphinae) in Arabian Gulf (Furley et al., 1987). Experimental infection of PPRV in American white deer (Odocoileus virginianus) has also been reported (Hamdy and Dardiri, 1976). Clinical and serological evidences also suggested the involvement of Gazelle, deer, antelope and other small wild ruminants (Abu Elzein et al., 1990, al-Naeem et al., 2000). The peridomestic rats have also been suspected to play a role in the epizootiology of PPRV in goats in Nigeria, but experimentally infected rats (subclinical) failed to transmit the infection to goats (Komolafe et al., 1987). These evidences imply the maintenance of PPRV in the environment by the animals other than the natural hosts (wild animals) (Couacy-Hymann et al., 2005).",

While such inoculation trials were continued, experts realized that stamping-out was not possible with free ranging animals. In 1896, Koch tried bile from rinderpest infected animals for inoculation but it increased the spread of the disease rather its prevention. Inoculation of the serum obtained from recovered animals resulted in protection of recipient from rinderpest (Koole and Turner, 1897). In 1917-18, Dr. William Hutchins developed an early vaccine for rinderpest which was based on organ extracts of treated animals (Pastoret et al., 2006). A major breakthrough was achieved in 1920 when Dr. J. T. Edward, Director at Imperial Bacteriological Laboratory Mukteswar, India, developed an effective vaccine for rinderpest through attenuation of the virus by serial passages (600 times) in goats. The vaccine provided long-lasting immunity against rinderpest in cattle and buffaloes without any side effects.",

However, in non\u2010endemic regions which are under threat, such as Europe, live-attenuated vaccine is usually not recommended by veterinary authorities, thus inactivated vaccines remains only viable alternative. Therefore, in recents times some new formulations of inactivated PPR vaccines have been developed and tested. One such vaccine developed by Cosseddu provided sterile immunity and was found to resist challenge with virulent PPRV, though two doses of the vaccines were required (Cosseddu et al., 2015). Another inactivated PPR vaccine was formulated with delta inulin and TLR9 agonist oligonucleotide as adjuvants which induced 100% seroconversion in rats and goats after 2 injections. All the immunized goats seroconverted to PPRV by day 9 and remained seropositive for >133 days (end of the experimental period) (Ronchi et al., 2016) suggesting that the inactivated vaccine, in combination with delta inulin adjuvant, represent a promising alternative to live attenuated PPR vaccines. However, in vivo challenge studies are required to warrant its use in the field.",

It also facilitated the process of attenuation of RPV and hence developing tissue culture rinderpest vaccine (TCRV) vaccine which led to successful global eradication of rinderpest (Plowright and Ferris, 1962). It was observed during RPV attenuation that during initial passages, the virus exhibited a minor surge in its pathogenicity, which later waned off leading to development of an avirulent strain at passage level 40 (Plowright and Ferris, 1962). In the beginning when homologous PPR vaccine was not available, heterologous rinderpest vaccine, formalized rinderpest spleen (Gargadennec and Lalanne, 1942) and lapinised rinderpest vaccines (Mornet et al., 1956c) were used for the control of PPR with variable success. Subsequently, with the successful application of TCRV (Bourdin et al., 1970) in protecting goats against PPR, OIE recommended it for PPR prophylaxis. The TCRV vaccine provided protection for about a year against PPR (Mariner et al., 1993, Taylor, 1979). However, this vaccine was later banned because of its possible interference with Global Rinderpest Eradication Program (GREP) to achieve rinderpest free zone and hence necessitated the development of a homologous PPR vaccine.",

Similarly, CPE manifestation in the form of cell rounding, detachment and syncytia formation (Laurent, 1968) was observed following infection of RPV in calf liver cells (Plowright and Ferris, 1959a, Plowright and Ferris, 1959b). Initially, PPRV forms microsyncytia which become larger as the infection progresses. The successive passage of PPRV in sheep liver cells resulted in reduced pathogenicity but the authors could not obtain a completely avirulent strain even at passage level 55 (up to which the virus induced a slight hyperthermia). A study by Benazet (1973) wherein PPRV was serially propagated in sheep liver cells also did not result in a complete avirulent strain even up to 65th passage [reviewed in reference (Diallo et al., 1989b)]. The unsuccessful attenuation of PPRV by previous workers could be attributed to insufficient quantity of virus inoculums used to generate mutants, type of cell culture system employed and inherent nature of the PPRV strains used for attenuation.",

During adaptation of PPRV/Nigeria/75/1, they observed that in the beginning of serial passages (up to passage level 10), CPE could not be observed until 4\u20137 days post-infection, however, after 50th passage, this period was reduced to 2 days. Like in case of RPV, PPRV also lost its virulence quickly upon successive passages in Vero cells; at 20th passage virus only induced slight fever in animals and became completely avirulent at 55th passage. It was also observed that this vaccine virus (at 63rd passage), when used to immunize goats, elicited protective antibody response as early as 7 days post-vaccination (Diallo et al., 1989a). Several vaccine trials of PPRV/Nigeria/75/1-based vaccine were conducted in more than 98,000 sheep and goats during 1989\u20131996 without any untoward effects. Besides, the vaccinated sheep and goats resisted challenge of virulent virus and did not transmit the challenge virus to in-contact susceptible animals. The protective antibodies persisted for more than 3 years in the vaccinated animals. Taken together the vaccine demonstrated its efficacy of protecting sheep and goats against virulent PPRV. Though in the beginning it was used worldwide for protection against all genetically defined lineages of PPRV but subsequently lineage type IV vaccine was also developed.",

Introduction of SLAM into cells facilitates morbillivirus replication (Pawar et al., 2008). However, the amino acid sequence of SLAM varies between species, and often requires adaptation of a particular virus to different versions of the SLAM (human, canine, goats and cattle) (Meng et al., 2011, Sarkar et al., 2009). On the contrary, nectin-4 is highly conserved between different mammals, and unlike SLAM, does not need receptor adaptation by the virus. As compared to Vero cells expressing canine SLAM (VeroDogSLAM), nectin-4 expressing cells (VeroDogNectin-4) were found to be highly sensitive for PPRV isolation (23% versus 4.5% efficiency from swab samples and 89% versus 67% efficiency in tissue specimens) (Fakri et al., 2016).

Since the PPRV vaccine is mostly required for use in hot and humid climate in South Asia and Africa (Begum et al., 2016), therefore, maintenance of cold chain is essentially required for transportation of the vaccine in the field which significantly increases the overall cost of vaccine package. To circumvent the problem of cold chain maintenance, a range of improved freeze-drying methods have been developed to enhance the thermostabilty of the PPR vaccine. Mariner et al. developed a lyophilized Vero cell-adapted rinderpest vaccine, stabilized with lactalbumin hydrolysate and sucrose, wherein the moisture content of vaccine was greatly reduced, thereby increasing the thermostability of the TCRV vaccine (Mariner et al., 1990). Similarly, Worrall et al. developed a rapid method of dehydration and preservation of live attenuated PPRV vaccine (Xerovac) wherein the virus was diluted 1:1 with a sterile 5% w/v aqueous solution of trehalose dehydrate and then subjected to drying by simple dehydration. The resulting vaccine was able to resist 45 \u00b0C for a period of 14 days without any major loss of potency (Worrall et al., 2000). Silva tried various strategies to increase the thermostability of PPR vaccines (i) use of Tris/trehalose to increase the virus half-life in liquid formulation (21 h at 37 \u00b0C and 1 month at 4 \u00b0C) (ii) Tris/trehalose also enhanced the thermostability of the lyophilized PPR vaccine wherein viral titers were maintained for relatively longer time [0.6 log loss at 4 \u00b0C in 21 months, 0.6 log loss at 37 \u00b0C in 144 h and 1 log loss at 45 \u00b0C in 120 h] (iii) replacing fructose with glucose enhanced intrinsic PPRV vaccine stability in terms of higher stability and higher virus production (1 log increase) (iv) increasing concentrations of NaCl facilitated the release of the virus from infected cells and reduced the cell-associated fraction of the virus (Silva et al., 2011, Silva et al., 2014).",

One such vaccine was developed using PPRV/India/2003/Jhansi strain. The virus was initially grown in Vero cells for 25 passages at 37 \u00b0C and then additional 25 passages were performed in Ta-Vero cells (at 40 \u00b0C). The resultant attenuated virus (Ta PPRV), when used as vaccine candidate in sheep and goats, was found to be safe, potent and efficacious vaccine candidate, thus providing an alternate to existing PPR vaccine (Table 1\n).

It elicited a protective immune response and could withstand the extremes of temperature in the field, now commonly used in Europe and the USA to control rabies in the wild animals (Brochier et al., 1991). Vaccinia-rinderpest recombinants have also been developed (Barrett et al., 1989, Yilma et al., 1988) using \u201cF\u201d and \u201cH\u201d protein genes. However these vaccines were based on WR strain of the vaccinia virus which was not considered quite safe to be licensed in the absence of smallpox. One of the important concerns when using vaccinia virus vectored recombinant vaccine is the safety of vaccinators, particularly in Africa where a significant population is immunocompromised due to HIV-1 infection. Moreover, vaccinia virus vectored vaccine produced severe lesions at the site of inoculation in animals (Belsham et al., 1989), probably due to insufficient attenuation. Therefore, few more sufficiently attenuated strains such as LC16mO (Yamanouchi et al., 1993) and Wyeth (Verardi et al., 2002) have been examined subsequently.",

Capripox vectored rinderpest vaccine had three main advantages; firstly, it had long-lasting immunity (>three years) in cattle, secondly, it could protect cattle against two diseases, rinderpest and lumpy skin disease (LSD) and thirdly, due to strong antigenic relationship within the genus morbillivirus, goats and sheep could also be protected against PPR (Jones et al., 1993, Romero et al., 1994a, Romero et al., 1994b). However, the disadvantage is that the pre-existing antibodies against LSD virus (LSDV) interfere in vaccine intake (Ngichabe et al., 2002). Capripox virus vectored vaccines have also been developed against PPR which act as dual vaccine to protect against both PPR and sheep and goat pox (Berhe et al., 2003, Chen et al., 2010). Though, the vaccine was found to be relatively thermo-stable, it did not elicit optimum antibody response probably because of the pre-existing immunity against vector (Chen et al., 2010). Later on, fowlpox (FP) virus vector, which had been successfully used in humans, when used in ruminants, elicited very poor antibody- and cell-mediated immune responses (Cubillos-Zapata et al., 2011).",

Neither insertion of eGFP nor mutation in the H protein affected the functionality and viability of the recombinant PPRV.

Therefore, alternative negative marker vaccines were produced by generating chimeric viruses with genes for immunogenic proteins derived from related viruses i.e. PPRV and RPV. The H and F genes of the RPV were replaced by corresponding genes from PPRV, resulting in chimeric RPV-PPRV recombinant virus vaccine (Das et al., 2000). Virus-specific serological response in such vaccines can be identified by specific ELISAs and therefore allowing discrimination of infected and vaccinated animals. Later on, N protein-based, chimeric RPV-PPRV marker vaccine was developed which provided protection against challenge with virulent RPV in cattle (Parida et al., 2007).",

Idiotype is located on the variable regions of antibody molecules. Immune response can be regulated by a number of idiotypic determinants (Ids) and its counterpart, an anti-idiotypic antibody (anti-Id) or Ab2 (Jerne, 1974). An internal image anti-Id, Ab2 \u03b2 resembles to the original antigen (McNamara and Kohler, 1984) and recognizes an idiotypic determinant within the antigen combining site. The internal image Ab2 \u03b2 antibodies have shown immunogenicity against hepatitis B virus (Kennedy et al., 1986a, Kennedy et al., 1986b) and bluetongue virus (Zhou, 1999). An internal image Ab2 against RPV and PPRV H/HN protein has also been shown to elicit virus specific antibody and cell-mediated immune response in the mouse model (Vani et al., 2007a). Moreover, DNA encoding VH region of Ab2 has also been shown to elicit long-lasting antibody and cell-mediated immune response in mouse in the complete absence of viral antigen (Vani et al., 2007b). Such DNA vaccine which codes for the heavy chain variable region of an internal image anti-idiotypic antibody (that mimics a region on the HN protein of PPRV) was also found capable in eliciting antibody and cell-mediate immune response in sheep in complete absence of viral antigens (Apsana et al., 2015). DNA-based vaccines are considered heat stable and generate immune response against a desired antigen (against PPRV HN protein in above vaccine), therefore it has potential to overcome both the limitations (thermo-sensitivity and DIVA) of current live-attenuated PPR vaccine being used for mass immunization in the field.",

Some of the laboratories around the world are also maintaining live RPV which could be released accidentally and could enter the environment to cause a devastating pandemic. It could also be released deliberately as an act of sabotage or bioterrorism either as natural isolate or one rescued by reverse genetics (based on RPV genome sequence available in the public domain). Therefore, alternative vaccine which could replace traditional live attenuated RPV strains is of utmost importance. These assumptions led Holzer et al. to evaluate if cattle can be protected from rinderpest by inoculating related morbillivirus, PPRV (Holzer et al., 2016a). Cattle immunized using the established PPRV vaccine strains viz: Nigeria/75/1 or Sungri/96 developed antibody and cell-mediated immune responses but failed to resist virulent RPV challenge, though the animals infected with wild-type PPRV were protected from RPV challenge (Holzer et al., 2016a). Therefore, use of PPR vaccine would not serve as a heterologous vaccine candidate against rinderpest in cattle and hence it would not be feasible to eliminate stocks of live RPV being held for development of RPV vaccine. This was probably the last study that was approved to handle live RPV.",

Similarly, RPV has been shown to subclinically infect small ruminants (Kumar et al., 2014). In this context it is imperative to speculate whether anti-RPV antibodies prevent the transmission of PPRV in small ruminants and similarly whether the presence of anti-PPRV antibodies in cattle affect epidemiology and transmission of RPV. However, only the virulent virus but not the vaccine virus is able to self transmit from the infected animals to in-contact susceptible animals [reviewed in reference (Kumar et al., 2014)]. In this context, it is desirable to develop a vaccine against PPR that transmits the virus to self immunize in-contact susceptible animals including cattle. Though PPRV can infect cattle to make them seropositive, it has not yet succeeded in adapting as bovine PPRV which could be maintained in nature independently without the small ruminants.",

In contrast, PPRV causes an acute lethal disease in sheep and goats with a mild infection in cattle. During GREP, mass vaccination was carried out only in cattle and buffaloes whereas sheep and goats were not covered (Couacy-Hymann et al., 2006). There have been speculations that PPRV may have emerged from RPV by natural passage in sheep and goats. In the recent times, evidences of PPRV infection in cattle and buffaloes (Abraham et al., 2005, Khan et al., 2008) suggest the possibilities of emergence of bovine PPRV. Therefore, it becomes pertinent to explore the possibility of inclusion of cattle in the mass vaccination campaign against PPR which is underway in Asia and Africa.",

The only limitation in using the current vaccine is that the vaccinated animals cannot be differentiated from naturally infected animals. This would be essential to evaluate the impact of vaccination during serosurveillance program post-vaccination. Since other diseases can also be included along with the PPR control program, multi-disease diagnostic assays need to be developed for effective containment of the disease. In order to overcome the necessity of cold-chain, a technology for thermo-stable vaccine should also be developed. Besides, research should also be undertaken on the development of aerosol/eye drop vaccine. Classically the level of herd immunity required to prevent transmission of the virus is 80%, however, precise level of herd immunity required for blocking effective transmission of PPR needs further investigations.",
