We have already noted an emerging generationalized rhetoric that has characterized how people of different ages have been affected by and reacted to the COVID-19 pandemic. These narratives have been especially present in discussions of how work and careers will be affected by this crisis. In this essay, we outline problems with applying the concept of generations, especially for researchers seeking explanations for how COVID-19 will affect careers and career development. We urge researchers to eschew the notion of generations and generational differences and consider alternative lifespan development theoretical frameworks that better capture age-graded processes.",

            "text": "Humans naturally seek simplified explanations for their own and others' behavior through a process of sensemaking, especially during -uncertain times\u2016 (Kramer, 1999) . This process is enacted through numerous means, including the construction and adoption of stereotypes (Hogg, 2000) . To this end, there is a tendency to broadly classify people into distinct groups based on demographic characteristics, such as age and gender, and to make generalized assumptions about the -typical\u2016 attitudes, values, and behaviors of all members in a given group that distinguish them from members of other groups. In particular, we often see sentiments that members of one generational group are markedly different in various ways from members of another generation. Such differences are noted across domains, for example, members of certain generations are often chided for -killing\u2016 various industries (e.g., napkins, Koncius, 2016; cereal, Severson, 2016; fabric softener, Terlep, 2016 explanations are those the rest upon the assumptions that (1) distinct generations exist, (2) there are demonstrable differences between generations, and (3) these differences can be empirically studied. Unfortunately, each of these assumptions represents a -myth\u2016 about generations that does not hold up to logical or empirical scrutiny. The assumptions that support generationalized explanations are dependent on one-another, forming a logical -house of cards,\u2016 wherein falsifying any single assumption invalidates the entire idea of generations and generational differences. In our previous work, we have outlined these issues in some detail, so we only allude to them briefly here (see Rudolph, 2015; Rudolph & Zacher, 2015 , 2017 Zacher, 2015) .",

Generations provide a convenient way for us to describe otherwise complex phenomena associated with human aging into simpler, if not consequently reductive and deterministic terms (Walker, 1993) . Generations and assumed differences between them are socially constructed through numerous mechanisms, for example, these ideas are born from and reinforced by the media, often through sensationalized headlines (e.g., Glazer, 2020) .",

Of particular note, the conflation of cohort and period effects bears some consideration, especially to the extent that one is attributed to the other. Factors that occur contemporaneously and that are experienced broadly (e.g., economic conditions, global pandemics) manifest as period effects, not as cohort (i.e., generational) effects.

The lifespan development framework has a long history in vocational behavior research (e.g.,Vondracek, Lerner, &   Schulenberg, 1986), which makes it an ideal fit to the types of research and practice questions that would otherwise give rise to generationalized explanations. In following our advice to adopt a lifespan development perspective, vocational behavior researchers could attempt to understand how the effectiveness of individuals' personal and contextual resources (e.g., capacities for emotion regulation, social support) for coping with specific demands imposed by the pandemic (e.g., increased work demands, social isolation) change with age. Additionally, vocational behavior researchers could investigate various career and life management strategies (e.g., primary and secondary control striving;Heckhausen & Tomasik, 2002; selection, optimization,   compensation; Wiese, Freund, & Baltes, 2000)  that people use to successfully manage transitions from school to work, from employment to unemployment, from work to retirement, and viceversa, during the COVID-19 pandemic.J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f THE FUTILITY OF GENERATIONAL EXPLANATIONS",
