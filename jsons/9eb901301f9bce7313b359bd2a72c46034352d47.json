Mutations in the LLP12 domain in this region have been shown to significantly affect viral competence. It is likely that the impaired infectivity of this mutated virus involves certain biochemical aspects of the peptide LLP12. To test our assumptions, some important biochemical properties and functions of LLP12 domain were studied. The recombinant peptide LLP12 (LLP12 domain on gp41, including LLP1 and LLP2 domains) was prepared via bacterial expression system. Biochemical analysis directly demonstrated its multimeric potential and membranebinding ability. Several arginine residues in this domain were observed to be extremely highly conserved. Interestingly, the LLP12 mutants constructed by substitution of these arginine residues with alanine (separate mutations in LLP1 or LLP2 or both) showed apparent decreases in their multimeric potential and membrane-binding ability. Comparing our results with independent data on human immunodeficiency virus from other researchers, it appears that both the multimeric state and the membrane affinity of the LLP12 domain of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 gp41 could be involved in viral competence and in the mechanism of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 Env-mediated cell fusion.",

            "text": "The cytoplasmic domain of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) envelope (Env) transmembrane (TM) glycoprotein gp41 plays important roles in the virus life cycle. The existence of its unusually long endodomain, more than 150 amino acids, when compared to the 20-40 amino acids for most other retroviruses, suggests its own biological significance, although not fully understood. Recently, great interest has grown in this domain, especially with respect to two highly conserved cationic amphipathic a-helical motifs, known as lentivirus lytic peptide 1 and 2 (LLP1 and LLP2). It is implied by increasing evidence that various functions, including virus replication, infectivity, transmission, and cytopathogenicity, are closely related to the cytoplasmic domain (1) (2) (3) . The functions of the cytoplasmic domain have been examined by creating frameshifts, deletion, or truncations, indicating that this domain can affect viral replication, infectivity, and cytopathicity (1) (2) (3) (4) (5) . Mutant HIV lacking the Env cytoplasmic domain cannot replicate in peripheral blood mononuclear cells and in the majority of T cell lines in vitro (6) . Some point mutations in gp41 endodomain reduce apoptosis and calmodulin binding without affecting viral replication (7) . Point mutations in LLP2 domain result in decreased binding of neutralizing antibodies to the Env ectodomain (8) . Interestingly, Kalia and colleagues reported that arginine substitutions in LLP12 could affect the virus infectivity in a single-cycle assay (9) . An explanation for all of these phenomena requires knowledge of the exact structure and function of the cytoplasmic domain of gp41; however, this has not been demonstrated directly.",

Circular dichroism (CD) studies of synthetic LLP1 and LLP2 peptides showed that their a-helicity increased with the addition of lipids, indicating the formation of lipid-associating amphiphathic helices (10, 11) . A recombinant fusion protein of gp41 cytoplasmic tail fragment and an Escherichia coli beta-galactosidase was expressed in living mammalian cells to examine the membrane-binding ability of this region (12) . Moreover, two 15-mer gp41-derived peptide libraries, covering the entire endodomain, were constructed and detected for their membranotropic (membrane-binding) properties (13) . To prove that the cytoplasmic domain has higher-order structures, a fusion protein of the gp41 cytoplasmic domain and the E. coli malE protein was generated and demonstrated to have a tendency to self-assemble into a multimeric complex, which, in turn, may play a key role in the virus life cycle (14) .",

Nevertheless, the reason why changing only a few amino acids exerts such a severe influence on such virological properties has not yet been explained. Based on an interest to characterize the effects that mutations in LLP12 have on the structural and functional properties of this important viral protein, we sought possible evidence for a correlation with mutant's decreased infectivity, and we mutated several highly conserved arginine residues within the LLP12 domains, and examined their multimeric potential and membrane-binding ability in this study. Comparing our results with previous virus experiments by others researchers (9) , it appears that the aforementioned biochemical properties of LLP12 domain of HIV-1 gp41 may be involved in viral infectivity and the HIV-1 Env-mediated cell fusion.",

The two PCR products were then amplified in a second round of PCR, by using p1 and p2 as primers, to generate a 300-bp fragment of LLPM1 and LLPM2 containing the desired mutations in LLP1 and LLP2 domains. Then LLP1 was used as the template to generate the mutant of LLPM3, which contains both mutations in LLP1 and LLP2 domains.

When the purified LLP12 protein (wild type) was eluted at 12 min, it was shown that LLP12 was prone to selfassemble into a complex over 150 kDa ( Figure 3B ). In comparison to LLP12, the fractionation peak of LLPM1 was observed about 1 min later. Therefore, the mutations in LLP1 domain demonstrably decreased the multimerization potential of LLP12 protein. However, the LLPM2 mutant was eluted almost at the same time as the wild type, suggesting that the mutants in LLP2 domain did not affect the multimerization formation of the whole protein (LLP12). Then LLPM3 mutant was eluted almost at the same time as LLPM1, which could be explained based on the previous results.

The binding affinities of the mouse antisera and all four involved proteins, together with GST as the proper control, were proved in ELISA ( Figure 4E ). To further test the changes in intermembrane-binding ability in vivo, LLP12 fused with EGFP was inserted into pCDNA3 plasmid, which was then transfected into 293T cells. These cells were examined under fluorescence microscope 24 h later ( Figure 4F ). There were intense fluorescence signals in the perinuclear area of EGFP-LLP12 in contrast to EGFP control, and this confirmed previous research studies on LLP12 intermembrane-binding ability (12) . A similar phenomenon was observed in cells transfected with EGFP-LLPM1, EGFP-LLPM2, and EGFP-LLPM3, indicating that none of these mutants notably affected their intermembrane targeting signal on LLP12.

Both of main properties of LLP12, multimerization potential and cellular membrane-binding ability, were identified by comparison with these mutants. It proved that the mutations in LLP1 domain significantly decreased the multimerization potential of LLP12 protein (Figure 3 ), which may be due to the secondary structural alteration by two arginine substitutions in LLP1. Furthermore, all three mutants showed an impaired ability in binding to the outer membrane of 293T cells (Figure 4) .

The three-dimensional structural differences between wide-type HIV-1 virions and cytoplasmic tail-truncated SIV virions also suggest a direct inter-Env interaction mediated by the cytoplasmic (22) . In the present study, we purified the LLP12 segments with no tag add-on using bacterial expression system ( Figure 2 ) and analyzed the multimeric potential of HIV gp41 LLP12 domain, which provided a more direct method to study the biochemical properties of this domain, comparing with the synthetic peptides or recombinant proteins (14, 23, 24) . LLP12 and LLPM2 (each with a MW of approximately 10 kDa) were eluted as complexes that were apparently larger than 150 kDa ( Figure 3B ). This finding indicated that they assembled into a higher-ordered form, such as possibly a tetramer of tetrameric forms. Similarly, we incubated the HeLa cells with LLP12 protein and examined the membrane-binding ability through anti-LLP12 sera, providing a more direct binding ability of LLP12 domain to cellular outermembrane.",

It has been reported that the Env mutant with a point mutation in the fusion domain dominantly interferes with fusion and infectivity (25) . Like the N-terminal peptide, the biological properties of the usually long C-terminal cytoplasmic domain of gp41 influence the virus entry into host cells in various ways. Our present study showed the more direct evidence of some intrinsic features of LLP12 domain and provided the possible link between mutation caused defective in virus infectivity and changes in biological functions. It is likely that the LLP12 segment organize into highly ordered forms and such bind viral membranes to take part in the membrane fusion progress. Our study may provide insight into the structural and functional role of the conserved gp41 cytoplasmic LLP12 domain in membrane fusion and may help to unravel the complex process of Env-mediated virus-cell fusion.",
