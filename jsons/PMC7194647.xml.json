It is therefore imperative to be judicious in the use of RT and to consider shorter courses of palliative RT for oncologic emergencies. Existing recommendations, such as those from the Choosing Wisely campaign, support the use of short-course RT as a component of value-based care (13). However, utilization in the United States has been limited, and therefore less equipped to optimally manage patients considered for palliative radiation (8,14,15). Here, we aim to provide a more detailed departmental approach to triaging and shortening radiation therapy for oncologic emergencies at a major comprehensive cancer center in New York City, an epicenter of COVID-19 in the United States.",

Patients with favorable prognosis and appropriate for stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS), we continue to provide SRS for patients an treat all or the dominant lesion(s) that is most likely to cause morbidity, in order to delay or potentially avoid whole brain radiation. However, for patients with urgent indications, such as progressive neurologic symptom from multiple brain metastases or leptomeningeal disease, whole brain radiation is often indicated. For these patients, particularly those who are hospitalized, ten-fraction treatment increases the risks for patients and staff exposure to SARS-COV-2. Thus, while several dose options are available, though we favor 20 Gy in 5 fractions, which has been safely used in multiple studies (23,24). Standard fractionation (30 Gy in 10 fractions) with memantine could be considered for patients in whom longer term survival is expected, in order limit neurocognitive complications (25). In patients with limited prognosis, the QUARTZ study demonstrated similar rates of overall survival and quality of life with steroids and best supportive care alone as compared to whole brain radiation therapy (26), and therefore observation is likely preferred to limit unnecessary exposure to SARS-COV-2.",

We utilized the NOMS paradigm to facilitate selection of optimal treatment (27). If radiation is indicated, over 30 studies have shown equivalent functional outcomes of single-fraction radiation treatment instead of multifraction radiation treatment (4,28), with recent meta-analysis of three randomized clinical trials demonstrating preserved motor response with no clinical difference between single-fraction radiation treatment (8 Gy x 1 fraction) and multifraction treatment at a two month timepoint (29, 30, 31, 32, 33). While there is conflicting evidence regarding the role of single-fraction radiotherapy for spinal cord compression, particularly given that the SCORAD III study did not meet its prespecified non-inferiority endpoints even though the absolute difference of ambulatory status at 8 weeks was small (69.3% in the single-fraction group vs. 72.7% in the multifraction group). However, 8 Gy x 1 provides acceptable rates of palliation and allows for safe retreatment with either conventionally fractionated or SBRT approaches if warranted. In the setting of COVID-19 pandemic, the risk for nosocomial infection from patient daily exposure and prolonged hospitalizations, and the potential exposure to staff and other patients must be balanced against the potential benefit of multifractionated treatment.",

This \u201cQuad Shot\u201d regimen has also been effective in head and neck malignancies (35).

Per NCCN guidelines for Supportive Care, many medical strategies can also be considered for the management of bone metastases (38). If patients have an impending fracture, we recommend a multidisciplinary discussion with orthopedic surgery and/or interventional radiology to decide on mechanical stabilization and potential role for radiation therapy. The risk of prolonged hospitalization from pathologic fracture may expose the patient to potential hospital acquired infections including SARS-COV-2, and thus planned surgical intervention should be considered for patients with impending fracture. Otherwise, radiation should be considered if it is anticipated that localized pain from a metastasis would result in potential admission for pain crisis. If radiation is indicated, several studies and the Choosing Wisely campaign support 8 Gy x 1 fraction treatment for uncomplicated bone metastases (13,39,40). Additionally, for patients with less urgent symptoms who are able to wait for complex treatment planning, single-fraction stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) may also be an appropriate way to provide faster and more durable palliation still in a single treatment session, based on randomized evidence (41, 42).",

For patients with metastatic cancer, prognosis must first be clearly estimated and communicated with the patient, followed by a goals of care conversation. Data from China suggests that 40% of patients with active cancer diagnoses required either intubation or died, although the authors report that they are only presenting a small sample size, and acknowledge the presence of other comorbidities such as age, and smoking history (9). Patients who have prognostic awareness are less likely to choose and therefore receive aggressive oncologic treatments in the last month of life (43). As such, these patients may opt for medical supportive care. For patients suitable and requiring palliative RT, abbreviated courses of treatment is of particular importance to reduce the risk of viral exposure to all patients and staff, without compromising functional outcomes. Furthermore, as staffing and clinical treatment capacity remains at risk for fluctuation, abbreviated RT courses better allow for treatment completion without delay. Fortunately, there is high-level evidence supporting these courses for oncologic emergencies to maximize patient benefit and resource allocation. As such, hypofractionated regimens for palliative radiation are preferred to reduce risk and maximize benefit for both individuals and the population during the COVID-19 pandemic.",
