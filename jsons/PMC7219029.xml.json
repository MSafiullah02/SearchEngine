Sporadic cases were extracted from 16 February (the earliest date of onset for a sporadic case) to 6 March; cases peaked at six per day on 6 March and then declined, indicating that the FF100 was increasingly incomplete.",

Delays between symptom onset and reporting were accounted for by fitting a gamma distribution to time between symptom onset and CC admission for FF100 patients (see Supplement Chapter 2). When fitting modelled CC admissions to FF100, incidence was inflated by 18.6% compared with CC admissions fitted to CHESS, to adjust for the ratio of the population of the UK to that of England (the ratio of reported COVID-19 cases in the UK to that reported in England on 15\u201323 March would give a similar inflation factor of 19.8%).",

The Louren\u00e7o scenarios producing these conclusions rely on severity pyramids that are much milder than those observed from Chinese [5], US [6] and Italian [7] data. Our own analyses indicate that severity is indeed a key driver of uncertainty in case estimates but across all scenarios, the majority of the UK population remained uninfected, and hence timely interventions to reduce physical contact could have a large impact. Importantly, our analyses relied on data from these countries only to establish the proportion of infected people who required critical care (which we expect to vary less between countries with reasonable healthcare access), and not for parameters likely to differ widely between countries such as the proportion of cases which are reported.",

In particular, the number of cases reported in the two databases differ markedly, with the FF100 reporting far fewer CC cases (e.g. six cases on 6 March from FF100 compared with 100 on 18 March from CHESS). Our model projections suggest that the FF100 numbers are lower even after accounting for different periods of coverage and delays to reporting. Further analysis also suggested delays between the date of being reported as a case and the date on which a case is actually recorded in the FF100 database which made correcting for right-truncation of cases difficult (see Supplement Chapter 2). Also, the proportion of cases estimated to require CC treatment was substantially lower than observed in other countries (and hence the multiplication factors to convert CC cases to infections are higher) because of the young age profile of CC cases in both FF100 and CHESS. For example, 34% of CC patients were younger than 45 years in CHESS compared with only 12% in published US data up to 16 March [6]. This may reflect biases in CHESS reporting, differential propensity to test by age or a higher triage threshold for CC admission of older patients than in the US. ",

Our model was fitted to data from early on in the epidemic (16 February) to just before the national lockdown (20 March). Furthermore, the order of magnitude is the same as data from situation reports that have less granularity but possibly better coverage. Lower numbers in the situation reports may in part reflect decreasing propensity to admit patients as CC beds become filled, in line with triage guidelines issued during the pandemic [9]. In addition, our model may have slightly overestimated cases if their rate of increase had slowed down even before the lockdown started. This highlights the need to triangulate case estimates from multiple surveillance streams whenever possible. Our investigations highlight the usefulness of CC surveillance in understanding epidemic dynamics and informing response measures, and hence the need for timely and complete reporting over the course of the epidemic.",
