We find that information technology plays a key role across nearly all components of the business models, orchestrating resources and processes to efficiently deliver personalized financial services to customers. Focusing on the IT-enabled value propositions across the fintech startups in our sample, we find that the startups tend to emphasize low-cost offerings that may pose a threat to incumbent business models in financial services.",

This study is a part of a broader research stream exploring the role of technology in innovation. Here, we seek to address the following research questions: (1) How does IT contribute to innovation in fintech? and (2) What types of IT-enabled innovations are likely to disrupt existing financial services? To address these questions, we focus on the leading startups in the NYC fintech ecosystem based on the funds raised from investors in the past 5 years and we examine how IT contributes to the value creation within each product or service offering. We also evaluate the likely disruptive impact of the IT-enabled innovations.",

The systems encapsulate and automate business processes, e.g. account application processes, they also provide seamless integration with partner systems where such integration is vital to service delivery, e.g. in the case of online banking and wire transfer services. By the virtue of encapsulating the core business processes and key partner relationships, the IT systems developed by fintech startups become the focal assets that support resource coordination that create value for the customers. In other words, information technology is interwoven into all elements of the fintech business model.",

The online trading platform Stash offers free equity trading. These offerings do put pressure on the traditional revenue streams in financial services.

To address this gap in research, we examined the leading startups in the New York City fintech ecosystem that have collectively raised over $1.1 billion in funding. We drew on the business model canvas framework and we examined how the startups leverage technology across their business model components. We find that technology platforms form the core of the innovative service offerings developed by the startups in our dataset. Further, we find that startups use low-price offering as the dominant strategy for disrupting the existing financial services markets. These observations provide empirical support for the theoretical arguments that call for the reexamination of the organizational logics underlying technology-driven innovation [36] .",
