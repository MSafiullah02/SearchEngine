After that, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) was first noticed in Vietnam in the February of 2003, and, by the end of that year, 29 countries were under the threat of SARS with a total amount of 8096 suspected cases and 774 deaths (cumulated from 1 November 2002 to 31 July 2003) (WHO, 2009a). Unfortunately, a new influenza virus, H1N1 (referred to as \u201cswine flu\u201d early on), is now spreading all over the world. Up to 23 May 2009, 43 countries have officially reported 12,022 cases of H1N1 infection. Mexico has reported 3892 cases of infection, including 75 deaths (WHO, 2009b). Within few years, human beings faced three new kinds of highly-infectious and lethal diseases, which made the whole world pay more attention to disease prevention and infection control. Infection control is deemed as one of the important tasks which should be fulfilled in the 21st century (Hsueh & Yang\u2019s report, 2003).",

The Taiwanese government pays much attention on the effects of infection control. For example, it is known from the Medical Care Act that Taiwan\u2019s government has stipulated that hospitals should take the responsibility for infection control, and the performance of which weighs heavily in the hospital accreditation. In practices, hospitals are asked to offer a lot of disease prevention measure, keep an eye on the epidemiological study, and establish an infectious disease reporting system. And the infection control department is deservedly taken as the communicating channel with the stakeholders; the department, hence, covers the disease prevention at not only the hospital, but also its neighboring community. But, this trend has caused an increase in workload for infection control department.",

Many scholars believe that the organizational need is an important factor which triggers the willingness to utilize the information technology (Premkumar and Ramamurthy, 1995, Zmud, 1984). Whether an investment should be made is pondered over only when the decision makers are in need of and willing to adopt the innovative technology.

Tait and Vessey (1998) suggest that user system, technical system, and development process variables should also be taken into account in assessing the effect of user involvement on system success. Similarly, Lawrence and Low (1993) argue that the group formed by users should guarantee that they should actively join the process of developing the system, understanding the system objectives, receiving enough training, and providing sufficient technology documents. According to Hartwick and Barki (1994), the most important evaluation indicators for user participation are: taking the responsibility throughout the development, the correlation between users and the information system, and personally joining the activity design. This leads to our last hypothesis:Hypothesis 4Project planning poses a significant influence on the ICP\u2019s willingness to adopt ICKM.Hypothesis 4.1:Task force skills pose a significant influence on the ICP\u2019s willingness to adopt ICKM.Hypothesis 4.2:Assistance from the information consultant poses a significant influence on the ICP\u2019s willingness to adopt ICKM.Hypothesis 4.3:User participation poses a significant influence on the ICP\u2019s willingness to adopt ICKM.\n\n",

In addition, hospitals of different levels possess different amount of available resources, and a hospital and its infection control department may hold different attitudes to the introduction of ICKM. Therefore, it is suggested that hospitals make early planning, properly allocate available resources, and encourage and nurture staff who are experienced in ICKM. Meanwhile, as a trend, despite having long been applied by other industries, KM per se and its combination with IT are still new concepts in the healthcare industry, and medical colleagues\u2019 understanding in them is limited. Hence, it is suggested that more ICKM-related instruction and on-the-spot visits should be provided, and executives and ICPs should be encouraged to take part in these activities in an attempt to enrich their knowledge in ICKM. As consequence, executives\u2019 and colleagues\u2019 willingness to adopt ICKM will be raised, and they would actively join the project planning, too. Additionally, if we want to retain and spread colleagues\u2019 ICKM-related experiences and knowledge, the incorporation of IT is inevitable. Thus, it is suggested that hospitals integrate current resources, make more effective use of existing knowledge, and classify and preserve the existing knowledge in an effort to set up an adequate KM mechanism.
