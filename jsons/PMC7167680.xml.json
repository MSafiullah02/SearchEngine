Eligible subjects were \u226418 years of age at the time of BAL and had multiple underlying diagnoses (Table 1). To identify cases, the BAL procedure records of the Pediatric Pulmonology division were reviewed. If a subject underwent more than one BAL during the study period, all procedures were included. Flexible bronchoscopy was performed to obtain BAL specimens in patients who were intubated endotracheally, or less commonly, via laryngeal mask airway (LMA). Sites for BAL were chosen based on chest imaging, usually CT scan, and by findings at the time of bronchoscopy. BAL was performed at multiple sites if there were multiple areas of involvement on imaging, or by bronchoscopic appearance.
