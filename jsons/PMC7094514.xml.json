The disease is caused by trypanosomes belonging to the sub-genus Trypanozoon namely Trypanosoma brucei rhodesiense and Trypanosoma brucei gambiense. T. b. rhodesiense causes disease in eastern, central and southern parts of Africa, while T. b. gambiense occurs in west and central Africa, extending from Angola to southern Sudan and Senegal. Other parasites of the sub-genus Trypanozoon are Trypanosoma brucei brucei and Trypanosoma evansi which cause diseases in livestock. However, a human case of T. evansi infection was recently reported in India (WHO, 2005, Truc et al., 2006), highlighting the need to develop definitive diagnostic tests for trypanosomes in humans.",

Routine diagnosis of the disease is based on direct visualisation of the parasite in blood, lymph node aspirates and CSF using a microscope (Van Meirvenne, 1999). This method has limited sensitivity due to fluctuating parasitaemia. In efforts to improve detection of trypanosomes, a number of diagnostic methods have been developed, including the mini-anion exchange centrifugation technique (mAECT; Lumsden et al., 1979), PCR (Welburn et al., 2001, Gibson et al., 2002, Radwanska et al., 2002, Jamonneau et al., 2003) and recently, a dipstick test (Deborggraeve et al., 2006) has been evaluated. Despite these advances, diagnosis of HAT remains unsatisfactory. The PCR-based tests have good sensitivity. However, the need for precision instruments and elaborate visualisation methods are obstacles to their wide application in clinical settings in Africa. Consequently, diagnosis of HAT involves a combination of parameters, such as origin of the patient, symptoms, demonstration of parasites by microscopy, or detection of specific antibodies using the Card Agglutination Test for Trypanosomiasis (CATT; Magnus et al., 1978). The paucity of definitive tests means that some patients go undetected and therefore become potential sources of infection to other people.",

Treatment of patients with late-stage disease, when parasites have invaded the CNS, is difficult due to the cost and long treatment schedules, which normally require hospital admission. Melarsoprol, the only drug that is effective for the late-stage T. b. rhodesiense form of disease, causes a post-treatment reactive encephalopathy in an estimated 10% of patients, half of which are fatal (P\u00e9pin and Milord, 1994, Kennedy, 2004). Modification of treatment regimes has not reduced mortality (Schmid et al., 2004) and treatment failure has been reported in the field (Legros et al., 1999, Matovu et al., 2001). Treatment of early stage HAT is much easier and safer, although some side effects have been reported when pentamidine or suramin are used (Lejon et al., 2003). Definitive diagnostic tests are therefore crucial for the early detection of cases. This would minimise false positives, and exposure of patients to drugs that are potentially dangerous (Inojosa et al., 2006), and whose efficacy may not be guaranteed.",

            "text": "Recently a rapid, simple and sensitive technique called loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) of DNA was developed by Notomi et al. (2000). LAMP is a novel strategy for gene amplification which relies on the auto-cycling strand displacement synthesis of DNA by Bst DNA polymerase under isothermal conditions (60\u201365 \u00b0C). The technique uses a set of six primers recognising eight sections of the target DNA (Nagamine et al., 2002). This increases amplification specificity, efficiency and rapidity. Moreover, the technique amplifies target DNA three-fold every half cycle, producing large amounts of product within 30\u201360 min (Notomi et al., 2000). The large amount of DNA formed allows visual detection of amplification through the addition of fluorescent dyes such as SYBR Green I (Poon et al., 2006) or Calcein (Boehme et al., 2007) and measurement of turbidity (Mori et al., 2001). LAMP has been used successfully in detection of human infectious agents for severe respiratory syndrome coronavirus (Hong et al., 2004), periodontis (Yoshida et al., 2005), malaria (Poon et al., 2006), peptic ulcers (Minami et al., 2006) and tuberculosis (Boehme et al., 2007). Further, Kuboki et al. (2003) demonstrated the potential of LAMP based on a single copy target (PFRA gene) for the detection of several T. brucei sp. More recently Thekisoe et al. (2007) have reported LAMP tests for T. evansi, Trypanosoma vivax, Trypanosoma congolense and T. b. gambiense. The LAMP test is attractive for diagnosis of HAT in sub-Saharan Africa where facilities are minimal, due to its speed, independence of specialised heating systems and results that can be visually inspected.",

In the present study, we have used the conserved region in the RIME gene to develop a sensitive and specific LAMP test for the subgenus Trypanozoon. The test was evaluated and compared with PCR using Trypanozoon isolates and clinical samples.",

The resulting sequences (GenBank Accession Nos.

Diagnosis is even more complicated as the disease progresses, since the clinical symptoms can mimic those of other diseases that are common in the endemic areas (Atouguia and Kennedy, 2000). Patients normally consult a health professional when the disease is advanced and irreversible brain damage has probably occurred (Robays et al., 2004). Development of a sensitive and reliable test for HAT is therefore a priority for early treatment and implementation of appropriate control measures. Furthermore, a test that is rapid and can give results at the point of care, would be ideal in the expansive and remote endemic areas of Africa. In the present study, we have demonstrated the use of LAMP technology in diagnosis of HAT using laboratory propagated isolates, as well as clinical samples. The RIME LAMP test that we have developed is rapid, and results are obtained within 35 min using a normal water bath to maintain the temperature at 62 \u00b0C. The analytical sensitivity was the equivalent of 0.001 trypanosomes/ml, indicating that it would be possible to detect very low parasitaemias in patients.",

In our hands, the RIME LAMP test could amplify DNA from clinical samples within 20\u201330 min. However, we optimised the tests for 35 min to ensure detection of DNA at very low concentrations. Purified DNA at \u2a7e200 ng (\u223c2.0 \u00d7 106 trypanosomes/ml) had an inhibitory effect on LAMP reaction as monitored in real time, and showed very weak bands on the agarose gel. It is, however, unlikely that such a high concentration of DNA would be found in a human host. The DNA concentrations in the 10\u22127 to 10\u22125 dilutions (\u223c0.1 to 10 trypanosomes/ml) gave the best results (efficient reaction in real time). Using the same dilutions, we observed an optimum concentration of \u2a7e10 pg (\u223c100 trypanosomes/ml) for LAMP tests based on maxicircle COX-1 and 18S genes, with detection limits below 10\u22127 (results not shown), a factor that is probably associated with the number of copies of each gene. In their studies to detect Trypanozoon sub-genus, Kuboki et al. (2003) used a lowcopy gene (PFRA) and four primers. Their detection limit was 1 pg (10 trypanosomes/ml), observations that were also confirmed in this study (Table 4). In the RIME LAMP test, we have used a target that is a multicopy gene and six primers, which may explain the higher sensitivity.",

Further, LAMP amplified DNA using 1\u20134 \u03bcl of largely native sera and buffy coat with no inhibitory effects in a 25 \u03bcl reaction. The ability to use heat-treated samples without compromising sensitivity eliminates the need for DNA extraction, and further shortens the LAMP reaction. Other studies have shown superior tolerance of LAMP for biological substances (Enomoto et al., 2005, Kaneko et al., 2007, Yamada et al., 2006), and heat-treated blood has been used successfully in the detection of malaria (Poon et al., 2006). During LAMP reactions, DNA separation is achieved through destabilisation of the DNA helix by betaine (Notomi et al., 2000). The increase in sensitivity associated with pre-heating of the template could therefore be due to faster DNA strand separation, translating into a more efficient LAMP test. Since HAT LAMP tests appear to be amiable to several templates, further work is needed in selecting and streamlining the best protocols for template preparation.",

The combination of SYBR Green I with the double-stranded DNA (amplicon) initiates a colour change from orange to green (Iwamoto et al., 2003). This colour change is rapid and eliminates the need to use ethidium bromide, which is potentially mutagenic, to visualise the products. In three laboratories (each in Kenya, Uganda and Tanzania), it was possible to process a template, perform the LAMP test and read results for 10 samples in 1 h, while the procedures for PCR took up to 4 h, excluding the time required for DNA isolation. The efficiency of amplification in a LAMP reaction is higher than that of PCR because there is no loss of time in the thermal change, since the reactions occur at a constant temperature. The test was reproducible in the field and no false positives were observed. Further, the usefulness of this assay was confirmed by its ability to detect both T. b. rhodesiense and T. b. gambiense directly from archived human blood and CSF samples (Table 2). The superior sensitivity demonstrated by detection of infections below the limits of other molecular techniques reported to date and negative results for P. falciparum, a co-endemic parasite in sub-saharan Africa, favours adaptation of the assay.",

Demonstration of trypanosomes in the CSF is the clearest indicator that CNS invasion has occurred. However this is always difficult to determine as the number of parasites in CSF is persistently low, leading to use of indirect and inconsistent markers such as white blood cell counts (WHO, 1998). Demonstration of CNS involvement is critical as it forms the grounds for the therapeutic choice, either early- or late-stage drugs. Some novel molecular tests such as proteomic signature analysis (Papadopoulos et al., 2004) and a PCR test (Jamonneau et al., 2003) have shown sensitivity and specificity of \u2a7e96%, however their adaptability in the endemic region is still a challenge.

This is because LAMP yields a range of product sizes that appear as a ladder on agarose gels, unlike in PCR where a characteristic single band size is observed. Furthermore, the test kit should be developed with a focus on reading colour change, to limit post-reaction DNA manipulations. In the present study, amplification of the target sequence was confirmed with specific restriction enzyme digestion using NdeI, melting curves (Fig. 2), and unequivocally through sequence analysis. Since the technique uses six primers, higher specificity and sensitivity were achieved. Real time analysis forms an important component in diagnostic test development, since it allows the monitoring of the test instantaneously. It was possible to monitor the LAMP amplification, obtain the melt curves and cut-off point through monitoring fluorescence of the double-stranded DNA intercalating dye \u2013 SYTO-9. To our knowledge this is the first time that SYTO-9 has been used in LAMP studies. The data obtained was reproducible, robust and consistent. The SYTO-9 dye has an advantage over other intercalating dyes in that it has a less inhibitory effect, shows a broader working range of dye concentration and does not selectively bind to amplicons (Monis et al., 2005). This wider working flexibility makes SYTO-9 an effective option in LAMP studies.",

The emerging information suggests: (i) that pre-heating of the template prior to its addition into the reaction mixture increases the test sensitivity by 10-fold, (ii) that amplification can easily be achieved using unprocessed template (buffy coat, supernatant and native serum) without inhibition or compromising RIME LAMP sensitivity and (iii) that a normal water bath is sufficient to reproduce results in endemic countries. This study provides direct evidence that addition of loop primers to the RIME LAMP test increased the test sensitivity and efficiency to a new level. It is apparent that a RIME LAMP test is promising as a diagnostic test and may be used as a back up to other tests in active or passive screening for HAT in endemic areas where diagnostic equipment are minimal. Determination and optimisation of protocols for processing the template to make the assay more user-friendly is a crucial next step. The data presented in this study will not only form an excellent comparator for further LAMP studies but will be useful towards development of a HAT test kit.",
