The decision was made to obtain a computed tomography (CT) scan of the brain without contrast in the setting of reported \u201climp\u201d appearance after antibiotics at home, and absent Babinski reflex bilaterally, with thigh twitching in the ED. The CT scan revealed a right cerebral hemisphere hypodensity concerning for acute infarction involving the right frontal, parietal, temporal, and occipital lobes in addition to hyperdensities concerning for thrombosed cortical veins (Figure 1\n). The patient was transferred for neurology and neurosurgical evaluation. A lumbar puncture was not performed in the ED because of the CT findings, and antivirals were not started in the ED because of the urgency of the patient\u2019s condition. Magnetic resonance (MR) imaging of the brain without contrast showed recent infarct without hemorrhagic conversion involving the territories of the right middle cerebral artery and posterior cerebral artery territories, with additional findings suggestive of thromboembolic disease. MR angiography of the brain and neck showed no aneurysm, vascular malformation, or occlusion, and MR venography of the brain showed no evidence of venous sinus thrombosis. Further work-up at the outside hospital revealed no hypercoagulability with prothrombin time 12.6 s (normal 11.9\u201315.0 s), partial thromboplastin time 33.4 s (normal 25.1\u201336.5 s), and an international normalized ratio of 0.9.

While the exact pathophysiologic mechanism by which influenza causes AIS is poorly studied, published literature recognizes AIS as a neurologic complication of influenza infection. To our knowledge, 2 reported cases of pediatric AIS caused by influenza virus infection have been reported in the literature. A 4-year-old male with influenza A was diagnosed with a subacute infarct of the left middle cerebral artery, and a 9-month-old female diagnosed with influenza HIN1 was diagnosed with a left posterior middle cerebral artery stroke 5, 6. Infectious influenza virus has a prothrombotic effect by activating procoagulant pathways and inhibiting anticoagulant and fibrinolysis pathways, and this patient\u2019s influenza A infection likely contributed to this patient\u2019s AIS (7). Poor oral intake and dehydration may have been contributing complicating factors, although the patient\u2019s blood urea nitrogen/creatinine ratio was normal on initial laboratory assessments. Fullerton et al. also found that infection transiently increased the risk of childhood AIS, with as many as 39% of patients with AIS reporting infection in the preceding 4 weeks and 18% in the preceding 1 week (adjusted odds ratio 6.5 [95% confidence interval 3.3\u201313] for infection in the previous week) (8).",

AIS in children frequently presents with a focal neurologic deficit, and hemiplegia is present in \u226494% of cases (2). However, infants and toddlers may present with increased crying, sleepiness, irritability, feeding difficulty, vomiting, and sepsis-like symptoms 2, 9. These symptoms can easily be attributed to alternate pathology, resulting in the potential for a missed diagnosis. A thorough neurologic examination is necessary, and abnormal findings can be subtle. A tense anterior fontanelle on examination can be indicative of increased intracranial pressure, and should be investigated further (10). The published literature indicates that the extensor plantar reflex, commonly referred to as Babinski sign, is present in most infants, with transition to a flexor response at approximately 6 months of age 11, 12. The mute Babinski response in this case was a subtle clue warranting further evaluation.",
