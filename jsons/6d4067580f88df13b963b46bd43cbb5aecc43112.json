            "text": "Coronavirus infections are a continuous threat raised time and again. With the recent emergence of novel virulent strains, these viruses can have a large impact on human and animal health. Porcine epidemic diarrhea (PED) is considered to be a reemerging pig disease caused by the enteropathogenic alphacoronavirus PED virus (PEDV). In the absence of effective vaccines, infection prevention and control through diagnostic testing and quarantine are critical. Early detection and differential diagnosis of PEDV infections increase the chance of successful control of the disease. Therefore, there is a continuous need for development of reduced assay-step protocols, no-wash, high-throughput immunoassays. This study described the characterization of the humoral immune response against PEDV under experimental and field conditions using a rapid, sensitive, luminescent proximity homogenous assay (AlphaLISA). PEDV IgG and IgA antibodies were developed toward the beginning of the second week of infection. PEDV IgG antibodies were detected for at least 16 weeks post-exposure. Remarkably, the serum IgA levels remained high and relatively stable throughout the study, lasting longer than the serum IgG response. Overall, AlphaLISA allows the detection and characterization of pathogen-specific antibodies with new speed, sensitivity, and simplicity of use. Particularly, the bridge assay constitutes a rapid diagnostic that substantially improves upon the \"time to result\" metric of currently available immunoassays.",

The other group (control) was inoculated with 20 mL of Eagle's minimum essential medium (EMEM, ATCC, Manassas, VA, USA).

A consensus sequence of the amino-terminal S1 domain of the spike protein was generated from PEDV non-S-INDEL strains. The sequence was codon optimized for expression in mammalian cells. A 5' terminal eukaryotic native signal was followed by a 3' terminal tobacco etch virus cysteine protease site with a human IgG1 Fc portion tag. Genes were amplified then cloned in the pNPM5 expression vector (Novoprotein, Short Hills, NJ, USA), which was used to transfect into human embryonic kidney 293 (HEK293) cells (Invitrogen, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Grand Island, NY, USA) by polyethylenimine (PEI) treatment at a 1:4 plasmid to PEI ratio. Transfected cells were grown in serum free FreeStyle 293 expression medium (Gibco, Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA, USA) at 37 \u2022 C with 5% CO 2 and orbital shaking at 120 rpm. Five days after transfection, culture supernatants were harvested and filtered for subsequent purification. The expression of Fc tagged S1 protein was confirmed by sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel (12%) electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE). The Fc portion was then cleaved off and the S1 portion was purified by protein A chromatography and nickel-chelating Sepharose Fast Flow affinity chromatography (GE Healthcare, Pittsburgh, PA, USA) according to manufacturer instructions. Purified S1 protein (717 amino acids) was then dialyzed against phosphate buffered saline (PBS) pH 7.4, and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting.",

In brief, the homotrimeric S glycoprotein, class I fusion protein essential for both host specificity and viral infectivity, is the main driver of the neutralizing antibody and T-cell immune responses against PEDV and a major immunogenic target for vaccine design [25] [26] [27] . Similar to other coronaviruses, PEDV S protein is composed of two subunits; the highly variable S1 subunit (N-terminal) contains receptor-binding domain(s), which remains unknown, responsible for viral attachment and the conserved S2 subunit (C-terminal) which mediates fusion between the viral and host cell membranes, and contains immunodominant neutralizing epitopes [28, 29] . The selected S1 region is characterized by multiple amino acid insertions, deletions, and substitutions [30] , that allow for a differential serodiagnosis of PEDV and rule out cross-reactivity against other porcine coronaviruses that might be cocirculating in swine herds [23] . However, S1 may not recognize some neutralizing antibodies specifically directed against S2 [29] . Although structural proteins N and M are highly antigenic, they are also one of the most conserved and, therefore, cross-reactive proteins among coronaviruses [23] .",

Therefore, the aim of the study was to characterize the humoral response to oral exposure to PEDV non S-INDEL strain, currently circulating in North America, under controlled (i.e., time to exposure to PEDV) experimental (livestock-infectious disease BSL-2 isolation facility) and field (wean-to-finish commercial farm) conditions, respectively. To achieve this objective, a homogeneous (no washing steps required) 2 h and two-steps AlphaLISA IgG/IgA assay platform was used. Experimental serum samples were previously tested by IgG ELISA and multiplex Luminex platform [24] , while field serum samples were previously tested by IgG/IgA ELISA [23] . Like in these previous studies, PEDV IgG and IgA specific antibodies were detected by AlphaLISA toward the beginning of the second week of infection, regardless of exposure conditions. Longitudinal field study allowed further assessment of the duration of IgG and IgA antibody response in a serum. In concordance with our previous study [24] , PEDV IgG antibodies were detected for at least 16 wpe by AlphaLISA, showing a similar downward trend than that obtained by ELISA. However, the AlphaLISA serum IgA levels remained high and relatively stable throughout the study lasting longer than the IgA levels previously reported by ELISA. Unexpectedly and contrary to the serum antibody profile obtained by ELISA, we reported a strong long-lasting AlphaLISA IgA response compared to the AlphaLISA IgG response. This study demonstrates that isotype antibody detection would depend on the analytical sensitivity and dynamic range of the immunoassay platform used.",
