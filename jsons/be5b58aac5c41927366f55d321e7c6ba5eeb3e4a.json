While COVID-19 patients are its direct victims, patients with other medical conditions may become collateral damage due to failure to provide them timely and adequate treatment. Oncologic patients, such as those with bone and soft tissue sarcomas and with skeletal metastases fall into this category, particularly those with indication for surgery who may see their treatment cancelled or delayed due to lack of Hospital resources such as ICU beds, blood and even operative rooms which may be transformed into ICU hubs.",

For the majority of musculoskeletal tumour surgery, the following scenarios and possibilities should be considered: 1) Sarcomas for which surgery is the first or unique curative treatment (ex. chondrosarcomas and soft tissue sarcomas). Some of these sarcomas can metastasise if not treated. With tumoral growth they can invade neighbouring structures that may ultimately preclude a limb salvage procedure. For these reasons, sarcomas in this group should be considered high priority even in case of severe resource constraints.",

While patients with cancer and patients with previous chemotherapy are transiently immunosuppressed, it has been shown that they are not at an increased risk of COVID-19 infection, for which the most important morbidity factor should be considered to be exposure to an infection source [1] . As such, and because surgery in these patients is often curative, its delay may compromise outcome. Therefore, surgical treatment should be considered of high priority, independently of the health system constrains.",

This is a trauma-equivalent clinical situation and treatment decision-making should be based on fracture location and pattern, as it may impair quality of life causing high morbidity and mortality. While some fractures should be considered high priority for surgery (such as proximal hip fractures), others may be considered for conservative treatment (radiotherapy) -such as impending pathologic fractures even when involving the lower limb. 8) Impending or established pathologic fractures of the spine. Spinal cord compression due to an unstable pathologic fracture is an oncologic emergency, no matter how severe the constraints to the health system are. If the tumour is responsive to radiotherapy, however, this option may be preferable as it is less resource consumptive and may be initially offered in a low resource situation. If the metastasis is radio-resistant or if radiotherapy is not available within the first 12-24 hours, surgery should be considered of high priority to prevent permanent neurologic injury.",
