This is a single cell, and the yolk represents a very large lipid inclusion in its cytoplasm.",

Neutral lipids are deposited as yolk in the oocytes, 8 to 9 weeks before onset of lay; then a small number oocytes start to enlarge, depositing more white, primordial yolk. They then enter the final rapid growth phase, with deposition of yellow yolk, which has lipids along with water, proteins, minerals, and vitamins. Follicles grow to larger than 35 mm in 7 to 11 days in the domestic hen. Developing follicles are an oocyte, surrounded by granulosa cells, and an outer layer of thecal cells. There is no fluid-filled cavity; the entire follicle is filled with yolk material. In the avian ovary, follicles do not mature synchronously; there is a hierarchy of maturation with the largest most orange coloured follicle being the next to ovulate. The next largest follicle will ovulate 25 hours later, and so on. Usually a hen's ovary has up to 10 follicles containing yolk, a larger number of small yellow follicles, and numerous small white follicles awaiting recruitment or atresia.",

Physiologically, she is striving to establish a clutch of eggs but is being thwarted on a daily basis by the stock keeper. After a clutch of eggs are laid, a hen's behaviour changes, and she becomes broody. This may be a desired quality if the owner wishes a hen to incubate her own fertilised eggs; it may be an undesirable trait if the purpose of the hen is to lay eggs for human consumption or to produce fertile eggs for artificial incubation. To prevent broodiness, eggs should be collected daily, and there should be few dimly lit hiding places for a hen in her enclosure. From an endocrinological perspective the following is occurring:\u2022In the ruptured follicle, granulosa cells synthesize progesterone, and, if sufficient, it inhibits further ovulation.\u2022The ovary, oviduct, and comb regress.\u2022LH levels decrease during incubation and hatching but increase if the hen lays a second clutch of eggs.\u2022Gonadal steroids decrease, whereas prolactin increases.\u2022Prolactin increases in males and females during egg laying, peaks during incubation, and declines when chicks hatch.\n",

Brood patches develop in response to ovarian steroid exposure. The tactile simulation of the defeathered, oedematous brood patch triggers transition from egg laying to brooding due to prolactin release. The blood flow to the brood patch is greatly increased, such that the heat from skin in this area incubates the eggs. Sensory fibres detect skin temperature where there is skin-to-egg contact. If the hen's body temperature falls she will shiver to generate heat and increase her metabolism to ensure that eggs are at the optimal temperature for incubation.

The downside is that measuring the egg shell temperature may require opening of the machine, with a resultant dissipation of heat. From about halfway through incubation, an embryo changes from a net absorber of heat to a net producer of heat, though the optimal temperature for the embryo remains in the range 37.8\u00b0C to 38\u00b0C.

Eight days postinfection, there is a massive growth in the pouch cell gland region of the oviduct, coincident with the occurrence of egg shell changes. Progeny from these infected eggs can hatch and appear clinically normal but latently infected. When a latently infected individual reaches peak lay, the virus is reactivated. The virus can be transmitted vertically and should an unprotected flock become infected during lay, the egg drop can be profound. Transmission is possible horizontally via the faecal/oral route. Classically an infected flock will initially show a loss of shell pigmentation, followed by thin shelled, soft shelled, and shell-less eggs. There is an apparent drop in egg production, though overall production may be normal, but there will be fewer normal eggs. It has been calculated that the loss equates to about 10 to 16 eggs per hen when a na\u00efve flock is infected (Pattison et al. 2008). Confirmation of a challenge is possible with rising antibody titres on paired serology or PCR testing (assuming isolation of the virus is not required). No treatment is available, but even in small flocks, vaccination should be considered. The only licenced EDS vaccines in the UK and internationally are polyvalent inactivated vaccines. Replacement pullets for an infected site should be injected with this vaccine intramuscularly between 14 and 16 weeks of age.",
