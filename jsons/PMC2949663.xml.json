            "text": "The genus Alphavirus (Family Togaviridae) consists of viruses with positive sense, single stranded, capped and polyadenylated RNA genomes [1]. Of the 29 recognized species in the genus, 28 are pathogens of higher vertebrates in the terrestrial environment, and the transmission cycle of these viruses includes an arthropode vector. The only species of the genus that infects fish, Salmon pancreas disease virus, today more commonly designated Salmonid alphavirus (SAV), is genetically distinct and a pathogen of farmed salmonids in Europe [2-4]. The genome of SAV is 11.9 kb long and has a genomic structure homologous to terrestrial alphaviruses with two large open reading frames (ORFs) of 8 and 4 kb length that are flanked by three untranslated regions (UTRs). The first ORF encodes non-structural proteins 1-4 (nsP1-4) and the second one encodes the structural proteins capsid, E3, E2, 6K, TF and E1 [5,6], of which capsid, E2 and E1 have been demonstrated to be expressed during replication [7,8]. The nsPs, possibly together with host proteins, make up the replicase complex (RC) that replicates the viral genome and transcribes the second ORF [9,10]. The structural proteins are translated from the subgenomic mRNA of the second ORF, that is controlled by a SAV RC specific promoter [2,3,10]. Following its translation in the cytoplasm, the capsid protein cleaves itself from the adjacent structural proteins. Studies from terrestrial alphaviruses have demonstrated that the cleaved capsid interacts with viral genomic RNA to form nucleocapsids [1]. It has also been suggested to have additional non-structural functions as the capsid of several alphaviruses, including SAV, may localize to the nucleus during infection [8,11-15]. The remaining structural proteins are translated into the membrane of the endoplasmatic reticulum, where they undergo glycosylation and proteolytic cleavage, before they are transported to the cell membrane. Budding of viral particles is induced by interactions between the capsid protein and the cytosolic parts of viral glycoproteins [16]. The glycoproteins are functional in the recognition and binding to receptors on the cell surface (E2), and fusion of the viral membrane with the host cellular membrane (E1) [1]. It is likely that SAV uses the same route of budding, entry and glycoprotein maturation, based on homology in sequence motifs between alphaviruses and the observed intracellular localization of the glycoproteins during infection [2,3,7].",

In these systems the complete or partial viral genome is cloned as cDNA where a promoter for RNA transcription controls the expression. Such systems may be designed as replicons, where the viral structural ORF is replaced with a gene of interest (GOI). Alternatively, the structural ORF is intact and addition of a second alphaviral promoter controls expression of the GOI. Expression of the GOI will then follow the same kinetics as the viral structural proteins.",

            "text": "Sequence analyses of SAV strains have suggested that at least six genetically distinct subtypes of the virus, SAV1-6, have evolved [17]. Some of the observed sequence differences also lead to variations in antigenic epitopes [5]. Of these subtypes, SAV1, 2 and 3 are the best studied, and full-length genomes of strains belonging to these subtypes have been sequenced [5,9,18]. Strains grouping to subtype 1 have primarily been associated with disease in the marine production phase of Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) in Ireland, those grouping to subtype 2 with disease in Rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) in the freshwater phase in continental Europe and UK, and recently reported from marine Atlantic salmon in Scotland, and subtype 3 strains with disease in Atlantic salmon and Rainbow trout in the marine production phase in Norway [17-19]. Experimental infection trials have demonstrated that strains belonging to the different subtypes cause similar clinical signs and pathologies in the target species [4]. With the exception of SAV2 infections in rainbow trout fingerlings [10], the mortality rates observed in laboratory experimental transmission of SAV are typically low, if any mortality at all [5,20-22]. Higher mortalities have sometimes been reported from field outbreaks [23,24]. Although these variations in mortality could be explained by differences in virulence between viral strains, the contribution from factors other than SAV, such as fish strain, environmental variations and other pathogens, could be equally important. Different transmission routes of SAV have been suggested to be of importance in aquaculture [17,25-28], but transmission mechanisms remain poorly understood. In Norway, SAV appears to be genetically homogenous, suggesting one or few original common sources for all outbreaks [25]. After an outbreak, SAV may remain in the fish population in the form of a possibly lifelong, persistent infection in some individuals [20,29,30]. Information about viral and host mechanisms that regulate the persistency is not available, but could be useful for proper management of infected fish populations.",

In general, outbreaks of several alphaviral epidemics have been associated with such point-mutations in E2 and E1 [31,32]. Recently, studies of the epidemic caused by the alphavirus Chikungunya virus (CHIKV), have demonstrated how reverse genetics systems can be powerful tools for understanding evolution, mechanisms of pathogenesis and genetic factors contributing to epidemics [32-34]. Reverse genetics systems addressing such topics should express viral proteins that are closely related to those of the naturally occurring virus. A reverse genetics system has been developed for an attenuated strain of SAV2 originating from rainbow trout [10]. Here we report the construction of a reverse genetics system that enables the recovery of a recombinant SAV subtype 3 with putatively identical proteins to those previously reported from the SAVH20/03 strain originally isolated from diseased Atlantic salmon in Norway [18]. The system can be particularly useful for studies of evolution and mechanisms of pathogenesis and transmission of SAV.",

We therefore obtained an antiserum against the E2 protein. A partial E2 coding sequence of SAVH20/03 was chosen based on a nucleotide alignment with a known antigenic region in Sindbis virus (SINV) and Ross River virus (RRV) (Figure 1a). The fragment was successfully expressed as a His-tagged peptide in E. coli (results not shown) and used to immunize a rabbit. Specificity of the obtained antiserum was verified by IFAT on Chinook salmon embryo (CHSE) cell cultures infected with the wild type SAV3 strain SAVH20/03. A positive signal was localized to the cell membrane (Figure 1b) and to cytoplasmic structures believed to be ER and Golgi (Figure 1b, arrow) as visualized by confocal microscopy. This corresponds well with the previously reported localization of E2 during infections with SAV [7,35], as well as with the localization of E2 of terrestrial alphaviruses [16]. No staining could be observed in mock treated cells (Figure 1b).",

The XbaI site was kept in the final construct and functioned as a genetic tag that could be used to verify the origin of progeny virus from infectious clones. Sequencing of the obtained full-length cDNA clone, prSAV3, revealed amino acid sequence identity, but 10 nucleotide mutations, not leading to amino acid changes, were present compared to previously reported consensus sequences of SAVH20/03 (accession nos. AY604235 and DQ149204). Of these, four were located in the non-structural ORF, two constituted the genetic tag in the junction, two were located in E2 and two were located in the 3'UTR (Table 1).

The sequence of pEGFPrSAV3 was identical to that of prSAV3 with the exception of the additional subgenomic cassette expressing EGFP from the subgenomic promoter of SAV located upstream of a transcription cassette expressing the structural ORF. The exact start of the subgenomic promoter in the nsP4 sequence is not known for SAV, but the length of the fragment chosen was based on a previously reported SAV2 promoter that had been shown to be functional [10]. The EGFP ORF is flanked by AgeI and AscI sites that allow exchange of the EGFP ORF with other cDNAs. Transfection of pEGFPrSAV3 into BF2 cells produced EGFP expression 5 days p.t. Foci of cells expressing EGFP were evident and the foci increased in size the following days. Passage of supernatant from transfected cells 8 d.p.t. onto new cells confirmed the presence of infectious particles, and packaging of genomes with the EGFP transgene into these (Figure 3b). CHSE cells infected with EGFPrSAV3 showed expression of EGFP already at 24 hours post infection (h.p.i.). The EGFPrSAV3 virus gave weak or no CPE compared to rSAV3, although the majority of cells were infected (EGFP positive). In one experiment, passage 3 of EGFPrSAV3 was grown in CHSE and BF2 cells for 30 days. After this prolonged incubation period less than 1% of cells still expressed EGFP, suggesting either gradual loss of the virus from cell culture or loss of/disruption of the transgene when incubation time is very long. During the work with constructing pEGFPrSAV3, a clone, pEGFPrSAV3nsP3263M323G was obtained that had accumulated mutations in nsP3 positions 263 (K to M) and 323 (E to G), likely a coincidence occurring during the cloning process. This clone was studied further in order to test the relative sensitivity of SAV to random mutations in this conserved region of nsP3. Although replicating and infectious recombinant virus expressing EGFP could be recovered after transfection (not shown), these clones appeared to spread slowly in infected cell cultures and was no longer detectable after two passages (Table 2).",

We also recently reported a replicon based on the SAVH20/03 genome to differ from the wild type sequence through an alanine to aspartic acid mutation in nsP2197 [9]. Through genetic modifications of the prSAV3 plasmid, the nsP2197A or nsP2197 D was expressed in combination with E2206 S or E2206P and all four viral mutants were recovered and shown to be infectious by serial passage in CHSE cells followed by IFAT (Table 2). A visible CPE indistinguishable from wild type CPE was produced by both mutants containing nsP2197A, while no CPE could be seen for mutants containing nsP2197 D (Figure 4a). IFAT on infected cells suggested that foci of infection were small with the nsP2197 D mutants and that the majority of cells remained uninfected. After three passages in cell culture, infection by the two rSAV3nsP2197 D virus variants could not be detected by IFAT, while cells infected with the clones containing the nsP2197A remained readily detectable (Table 2). The E2S206P mutation did not cause lack of recognition by the E2 antiserum since indistinguishable staining was obtained with the two virus mutants (Figure 4b). Sequencing of the partial E2 coding sequence verified that both these mutants were genetically stable during three passages in CHSE cells (Figure 4c). Endpoint titration of supernatant from infected cell layers confirmed that the virus titer was reduced in the nsP2A197 D mutant while for the E2S206P mutant the production of infectious particles appeared to increase by almost one log (Table 3). Recombinant SAV with E2206P produced similar titers as the wild type SAVH20/03 isolate also carrying the E2206P.",

Still, important questions related to viral and host mechanisms that contribute to transmission and pathogenesis remain unanswered. Here we report the development of infectious clones for a subtype 3 strain where the viral genome is transcribed by cellular RNA polymerase II from a CMV promoter in a pVAX1 backbone. The recombinant virus was also engineered to express non-viral RNA from an introduced, additional subgenomic promoter. Subtype 3 appears to be genetically homogenous, indicating a relatively recent common source for all known isolates [25]. We therefore designed the system to recover viruses that express proteins identical to those reported previously from consensus sequences of SAVH20/03, the only subtype 3 strain where both ORFs have been completely sequenced [9,18,25]. Such alphaviral reverse genetics systems are suitable for studies of evolution and mechanisms of emergence and pathogenesis. For CHIKV, development of infectious clones with high similarity to wild type CHIKV has led to identification of point-mutations important for the emergence of epidemic strains [32-34]. Using the obtained SAV3 infectious clones, we demonstrated that point-mutations indeed may alter the replication properties of SAV dramatically.",

However, compared to previously reported sequences from SAVH20/03, the prSAV3 plasmid contains 10 mutations that do not lead to amino acid change (Table 1). Although such mutations not leading to amino acid changes certainly have the potential to affect viral replication, the obtained recombinant virus had titer production comparable to SAVH20/03 and other wild type SAV isolates in cell culture [37]. Similar to some other DNA-launched positive stranded RNA virus systems [38,39] the exact rSAV3 3'-end is uncertain since transcription is stopped by the BGH signal in the pVAX1 vector, leaving some nonsense (non-viral) sequence downstream of the introduced polyA tail. This nonsense sequence will most likely be lost during replication, since alphaviruses are believed to maintain and repair their polyadenylated 3'-ends by the use of their RC [40-42]. Still, future work could benefit from investigating the true 3'end of the obtained transcripts, and potentially developing a more authentic 3' end, for example by inserting a Hepatitis delta virus ribozyme immediately downstream of the polyA tail [39]. Such studies could also focus on understanding the impact of different lengths of polyA tails, as this has been reported to affect replication of alphaviruses [43].",

When we recovered an infectious recombinant SAV3 strain, we made a similar observation, as a mutation in nsP2197 dramatically reduced the ability of the virus to infect and replicate in CHSE cells. This mutation is located in a conserved region of nsP2 in alphaviruses, believed to include an NTP binding motif that is essential for RNA triphosphatase, helicase and NTPase activity of the protein [44]. Thus, it is likely that an aspartic acid compared to the wild type alanine in this position reduces efficiency of the viral capping apparatus as well as helicase activity. Similarly, the virus with two mutations in nsP3 had a clearly reduced ability to replicate, and resulted in the loss of the virus from infected cells after two passages. Both mutations were located in a region of nsP3 that is conserved among alphaviruses, but outside the described macro domain [45,46]. Although these mutations demonstrate that SAV can tolerate single amino acid mutations in highly conserved motifs of the RC, they also address the relatively large impact such single mutations may have on the viral phenotype. This suggests that SAV, like other alphaviruses [31,32], has the potential of major changes in some phenotypic features as a result of minor genetic change. A similar observation has been done for a SAV2 strain which adapted to replication at an elevated temperature through six mutations in the structural ORF [10].",

Such systems are suitable for identifying mutations that contribute to the emergence of outbreaks. Alphavirus epizootics appear to be particularly associated with point mutations in the viral receptor protein E2 or the fusion protein E1 [31,32]. These mutations could lead to changes in cell tropism and affinity for host species [32]. We utilized the rSAV3 system to confirm that the previously reported E2S206P mutation [25] enhances the viral titer production in CHSE cells. This is in agreement with the hypothesis that this mutation may be a beneficial adaptation for replication in CHSE cells. Our phylogenetic analyses suggested, however, that a proline is the ancient aa residue in this position of E2 in natural populations of SAV, and that the mutation towards serine is a relatively recent event that has happened in the SAV3 subtype only. Alignments of sequences from SAV3 isolates have previously demonstrated that several SAV3 isolates still carry the proline [17,25]. This suggests that a proline codon might still be part of a viral quasispecies in SAV3 strains. If so, it could indicate a regulator of pathogenesis. In further support of this idea, in silico analyses predicted the E2206 to be located on the surface of the protein, probably in an area used for receptor recognition. It appears, however, that the mutation does not have any major effect on the antigenic properties, since both the serine and proline mutants were readily detected by the antiserum that was raised against a short peptide containing this region. Clearly, data from experimental transmission studies in fish are needed in order to better understand the role, if any, of the E2S206P mutation during an in vivo infection.",

Like other alphavirus vectors, they could provide several advantages over traditional vaccine vectors, since expression of the antigen occurs in the context of a viral infection [47]. Another powerful future aspect of the pEGFPrSAV3 plasmid could be to address tissue tropism of SAV3 mutants through bioluminiscence imaging, as has been done for other alphaviruses [33,48,49]. Such studies could help clarify the role of tissue tropism in SAV pathogenesis. We observed, however, that rSAV3 with double subgenomic promoter is unstable similar to what has been shown with such constructs for other alphaviruses [50]. It is possible that the virus is able to sustain in only a small fraction of cells when it contains a transgene, but it is more likely that the transgene itself is gradually lost or mutated as the infection progresses due to the lack of selection pressure. Further development of these SAV based expression systems should therefore aim at incorporating selection pressure on the transgene, as has been done for SINV [51].",

The E2206 mutation did not appear to affect CPE. Representative images of CPE are shown for each mutant. (B) The E2206 mutation did not affect antigenicity of the E2 protein notably, since both the serine and proline mutants were readily detected by IFAT. (C) RT-PCR and sequencing of passage 3 of recombinant viruses confirmed that both the serine and the proline codons were stable.",
