Most of the cases and deaths have occurred in Wuhan city in China where the outbreak started. As drugs or vaccines are not yet available, various non-pharmaceutical measures have been recommended to reduce the spread of infection, including hygiene and disinfection, improving environmental control, early detection and reporting, isolation, quarantine, use of personal protective equipment, social distancing and travel restrictions ((World Health Organization (WHO) 2014; Bell et al., 2006)). In most pandemic plans, tiered strategies which target front line health workers first, followed by the general community, are usually defined. Yet many of these strategies have some level of controversy attached and lack a large evidence base (MacIntyre et al., 2014). Some are starting to be phased out in some settings such as the use of thermal scanners at airports, due to a lack of evidence, especially for infections with pre-symptomatic transmission (Gunaratnam et al., 2014). However, the use of other interventions continues to be debated.",

The World Health Organization (WHO), the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and other leading health organisations have different recommendations for the selection of respiratory protection. For example, the WHO recommends using masks to protect health workers from COVID-19 during routine care and respirators during aerosol generating procedures (World Health Organisation (WHO) 2020). In contrast, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) 2020) and the European Center for Disease Prevention and Control (European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) 2020) recommend using respirators during both routine care of COVID19 patients and high risk situations. Individual countries also have different policies; some are in line with the WHO, and others with the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. For example, the Australian (Communicable Diseases Network Australia (CDNA)) and Canadian guidelines (Government of Canada) align with the WHO, while UK (Public Health England) and Chinese guidelines (Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention 2020) align with the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and European Center for Disease Prevention and Control. While all organisations recommend using N95/ P2/FFP2 or equivalent respirators, Public Health England (UK) recommends using filtering facepiece 3 (FFP3) respirators for all cases and the European Center for Disease Prevention and Control recommends using FFP3 during aerosol generating procedures. Australian guidelines also recommend powered air purifying respirators while performing aerosol generating procedures on multiple patients. Although US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidelines also discuss powered air purifying respirators indication of their use is not clear.",

The community trials show a benefit of face masks with or without hand hygiene, conditional on compliance (Simmerman et al., 2011; Aiello et al., 2012; Aiello et al., 2010b; Suess et al., 2012; MacIntyre et al., 2009; Cowling et al., 2009).

Masks were originally designed to prevent spread of infections from wearers to other people around them, referred to as \u201csource control\u201d. They are also used to protect from infections transmitted through the droplet mode and splashes or sprays of blood or body fluids. Disposable medical or surgical masks are common types of face masks used by both health workers and general public. In contrast to this, respirators are designed for respiratory protection. A medical or surgical mask may be enough to prevent droplet transfer, while a respirator is required for airborne infection. In terms of mask use, the physical barrier may also prevent contact transmission such as hand to face/mouth/nose. A respirator may provide protection against multiple modes of transmission, including droplet, airborne and hand-to-mouth/nose transmission. Whilst the relative contribution of each mode is difficult to quantify, clinically, the debate about the modes of transmission is academic if an intervention is shown to prevent infection.",

There had been evidence of airborne transmission of SARS as well, therefore respirators were recommended for SARS during 2002\u201303 outbreak (McKinney et al., 2006). In Canada, initially masks were recommended, but this recommendation was later changed to respirators due to the deaths of health workers. A recent study demonstrated the presence of coronavirus in anal swabs from infected patients and possibility of transmission through faecal-oral route (Zhang et al., 2020). Transmission dynamics for COVID-19 are still unclear and pharmaceutical control measures are not yet available, therefore N95 or higher respirators should be offered to health workers who are working at the frontline (MacIntyre et al., 2014a; MacIntyre et al., 2014b). Health workers and other first responders in high coronavirus transmission areas (e.g. Wuhan) should use respirators during routine care of coronavirus cases. Health workers and first responders in low risk countries should use a respirator when encountering a suspected or confirmed case of coronavirus. If respirators are not available, then masks should be used.",

According to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, extended use refers to \u201cthe practice of wearing the same N95 respirator for repeated close contact encounters with several patients, without removing the respirator between patient encounters\u201d (Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) 2014a).

Shortages of respirators were reported in many hospitals in US and Japan during the 2009 influenza H1N1 pandemic and staff had to use medical masks (Lautenbach et al., 2010; Rebmann and Wagner, 2009; Tomizuka et al., 2013).",

However, the outer surface of medical masks or respirators may be contaminated and may be a source of infection ((Institute of Medicine (IOM) National Academy of Sciences 2010; Viscusi et al., 2009)). A recent study showed that pathogens may be present on the outer surface of around 10% masks and risks increase with prolonged mask use (Chughtai et al., 2019).
