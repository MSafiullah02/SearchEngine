We immobilized each lion using Ketamine (Ketamine HCL; Wildlife Pharmaceutical, Ft. Collins, CO; 2.0\u20137.0 mg/kg) and medetomidine hydrochloride (Domitor; Wildlife Pharmaceutical; 0.2\u20130.7 mg/kg). Medetomidine was reversed using antisedan (Atipamezole hydrochloride; Pfizer Inc., New York, NY) at a dose of 3 mg of atipamezole for every 1 mg of medetomidine. We collected blood via saphenous venipuncture into serum separator tubes, placed the samples on ice, and (within 1\u20134 hr after collection) had them centrifuged (15 min at approx. 3,000 rpm). We froze the serum samples (\u221212\u00b0C) until they were tested.",

We also calculated the percent of each home range that was in an urban area (Fig. 1). We created an urban boundary layer by combining high\u2010resolution satellite imagery (1\u2010m pixel resolution) with an Arizona Department of Transportation (ADOT) urban boundary layer and a road\u2010density layer. The ADOT city layer already accounted for incorporated cities in Arizona and we used this layer as the base map. To find towns not accounted for, or to modify the existing boundary of an ADOT city boundary, we used the road\u2010density layer to locate high\u2010density areas (>3 km of road/0.5 km2) and overlaid them on satellite imagery. We then used heads\u2010up digitizing to outline urban areas (for more details see Nicholson 2009).",

Our (n = 3/9 [33%]) seropositive results for FIV antibodies are reasonable because FIV is not uncommon in mountain lions. Chronic infection is asymptomatic in this host in Montana, Washington, Texas, and Florida in the United States (Evermann et al. 1997, Biek and Poss 2002, Biek et al. 2006, Miller et al. 2006), or in Brazilian felids (Filoni et al. 2006) and African lions (Roelke et al. 2006).

Mountain lions in the southwestern United States (i.e., AZ, CA, NM) were reported to be more likely to be seropositive for T. gondii than those from northwestern and mountain states because of climatic differences or survival of the tachyzoites in the prey of mountain lions (Kikuchi et al. 2004).",

Infection by CDV might have resulted from contact with an actively infected wild or domestic canid, collared peccary, or raccoon. The collared peccary is a common prey of mountain lions in the Southwest and has been reported as infected with, or seropositive to, CDV (Murphy et al. 1999, Noon et al. 2003). In a 4\u2010year study on CDV exposure in peccary in and around Tucson, 58% of samples collected were positive for virus\u2010neutralizing antibody (Noon et al. 2003). Contact between mountain lions and infected feral or domesticated felids or other infected free\u2010ranging wild felids present in their habitat might explain some of our findings.",
