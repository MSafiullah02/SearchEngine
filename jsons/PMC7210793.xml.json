However, injection vaccination often shows difficulty in sponsoring the antigen-specific immune responses at mucosa, which is the gate whereby most infectious agents invade hosts [5]. Thus, injection of vaccines can hardly elicit mucosal immunity to form the first line of barrier to pathogen attack. Also, injection involves inconvenience of management, poor compliance, and difficult administration without trained medical professionals [6]. By contrast, mucosal vaccination can be conveniently carried out and demonstrates the ability of triggering systemic as well as mucosal immunity toward pathogens. Moreover, mucosal administration is considered the beneficial vaccination route, because mucosal immune system is evolved with numerous mucosa-associated lymphoid tissues (MALTs) [7]. MALTs contribute to constituting the mucosal immune network throughout the body and function to facilitate setting up comprehensive immunity against invading agents [8]. Mucosal vaccination can be undertaken at mucosa of several physiological and anatomical sites, such as gastrointestinal lumen, nasal cavity, pulmonary alveolus, vagina and oral cavity [9\u201315].",

            "text": "Respiratory system mucosa represents the most vulnerable and popular site whereby lethal pathogens attack and knock out hosts, because it shows a mild environment and exchanges air and borne materials most frequently with the outside [16]. Recently, several ravaging epidemics or pandemics with a high fatality are all associated with respiratory system infections, e.g., 2003 SARS, 2009 H1N1 swine flu, 2012 MERS, and the now ongoing COVID19 caused by SARS-CoV-2 (severe acute respiratory syndrome-associated coronavirus-2) [17\u201319]. In particular, SARS-CoV-2 is now still rapidly spreading across the whole world from initial epicenter of Wuhan in China, and has caused a severe pandemic claimed nearly 15 000 people\u2019s lives among more than 300 000 infections [20]. To prevent the epidemic situation worsening, China has taken tough measures on containment of the transmission, such as putting epicenter and many other cities on lockdown, keeping it from being exported to other countries, and aggressively tracing anyone the infected were in contact with and quarantining those people for 2 weeks [21]. However, the devastating SARS-CoV2 seems unstoppable to march stealthily toward many more places and shows high possibility to engender another pandemic. These facts suggest that measures taken at present such as infection quarantine and travel restrictions may not be adequate to contain the epidemics, especially, the ones caused by the air-borne viruses aggressing host respiratory system. Vaccines are thought to be the ultimate arsenal enabling people to finally control such SARS-like life-threatening epidemics. As such, researchers are racing against time to develop vaccines that should be promptly available in sufficient quantities for massive use [22].",

            "text": "Conventional vaccines using the attenuated live microbes and the inactivated/killed microbes can hardly meet with the requirements of handling urgent epidemics. These kinds of vaccines are manufactured thorough production of large volumes of pathogens involving microbe proliferation and egg/cell culture medium preparation, thus engendering a considerable lag time between vaccine development and vaccination conduct [23]. Novel modes of making vaccines tend to focus on purified antigens (Ags), e.g., using Ag-coding DNA and mRNA to develop a nucleic acid vaccine [24], engineering viruses to deliver whole Ags as a recombinant vaccine, and making expression system to secret Ags for formulating a subunit vaccine [25]. Nucleic acid vaccines can be developed rapidly with the Ag sequence, e.g., an mRNA vaccine against SARS-CoV2 was developed ready for clinical trial in just 6 weeks from the virus sequence identification. But DNA/mRNA vaccines are rigid in formulating with an adjuvant, which is usually indispensable for enhancing immunostimulatory efficacy of Ags presented alone [26]. Preparation of recombinant virus-vectored vaccines also involves lengthy large-scale culturation of microbes and often takes time long enough to miss the vaccination window of an epidemic [27]. By comparison, subunit vaccines using purified Ags rapidly expressed by a microbial system can be flexibly combined with a vaccine adjuvant-delivery system (VADS) to achieve immunization purpose. A VADS can fulfil multiple immunostimulatory functions such as targeting delivery, changing immune response type, and promoting comprehensive cellular as well as humoral reactions [28]. Also, it has been confirmed that mucosal vaccination is most efficient in inducing robust immunity at the administration site [7]. Therefore, various nanoparticulate carriers have been developed as a pulmonary VADS for delivering subunit vaccines but few succeed in taming the highly contagious pathogens, such as SARS and MERS CoVs, which invade hosts via respiratory mucosa [29].",

            "text": "Notably, the most frequently used VADS is alum (aluminum salt) which has been used in many clinical vaccines since 1920s [30]. The alums in licensed vaccines include aluminum hydroxide, aluminum phosphate and potassium aluminum sulfate, all of which can effectively enhance antibody response to vaccines with, however, not-exactly known mechanisms [31]. Whatever aluminum salt is used as an adjuvant, in an aqueous medium, its acid groups will always be substituted to some degree by the anionic hydroxyls [32]. The latter facilitate formation of hydrogen bonds between alum primary nanoparticles, which are thus associated into micrometer clusters engendering a gel-like suspension. The gel-like alum adjuvants may not fit certain administration modes, such as pulmonary vaccination, since their sticky property is likely to cause bronchoalveolar airway obstruction. Moreover, alums have another two disadvantages: they are a strong antibody adjuvant but unable to induce cellular reactions; they sometimes stimulate unacceptable local irritations as side effects [33]. As a result of this, researchers are now making efforts on reformulation of conventional alums to improve their adjuvanticity. In particular, it was found that engineering of alums into special nanostructures, with/without certain materials, such as phospholipid engendering the phospholipid bilayer-coated aluminum nanoparticles (PLANs) and poly(acrylic acid) generating nanorods, can remarkably reduce their local irritating activity while rendering them able to enhance cellular immune responses toward the carried Ags [34\u201339]. These outcomes inspire us to trial the feasibility of using aluminum nanoparticles (ANs) as a pulmonary VADS for delivering vaccines to elicit strong mucosal immunity against air-borne pathogens, such as SARS-CoV2 and MERS, that incline to infringe and disable human respiratory system.",

The microscopic images indicated that, like normal ones (Fig. 4a), the lung issues of mice received ANs (Fig. 4b) showed no sign of significant histopathological alterations, though they were noticed of a few of cells the tissue areas close to certain blood vessels. By contrast, pulmonary administration of AMs caused a plethora of inflammatory cells to infiltrate mouse whole lung tissues (Fig. 4c). In addition, death as well as body-weight loss that occurred in mice received AMs completely denied alum to act as a pulmonary VADS (data are not shown). Similar damages were also observed in mice intranasally immunized with alum adjuvanted RSV (respiratory syncytial virus) vaccines by other researchers [44]. Nevertheless, outcomes of this investigation proved that nanotechnology still works well in improving adjuvanticity of alums, so that it allows Al2O3 NPs to be used as a VADS for pulmonary vaccination.",

Because pulmonary vaccination of AMs was noticed of severe cytotoxicity, mice in the alum control group were immunized by subcutaneous injection (s.c.). All the animals were immunized twice with a 3-week interval. ELISA examination revealed that, by pulmonary administration, OVA-ANs were much more efficient than free OVA in inducing synthesis of anti-Ag IgG (Fig. 5a). Notably, at a high AN dose (OVA/AN of 1:20), the serum IgG levels in OVA-AN mice even surpassed the levels in s.c. OVA-AM mice after first vaccination but declined significantly after the second vaccination. A similar trend was also observed in vaccine-induced anti-Ag IgG1 and IgG2a, both of which showed lowered levels after second mouse vaccination in either OVA-AN or OVA-AM group (Fig. 5b and c). The exact reason for this remains to be fully disclosed but might well be argued relevant to certain side effects associated with pulmonary ANs or s.c. AMs, as mouse bodyweight in either vaccine group seemed to decrease after first immunization (Fig. 5d). IgG1 and IgG2a isotypes are argued as markers for Th2 and Th1 lymphocytes, respectively, and thus may present some insight into the type of Th cell immune response [45]. IgG2a-to-IgG1 ratio values in mice received OVA-ANs were much higher than that received free OVA or OVA-AMs, suggesting Al-nanocarriers have a tendency to induce a more balanced Th1/Th2 response. This observation was further supported by cytokine assay outcomes, which indicated that mice stimulated by pulmonary OVA-ANs produced more IFN-\u03b3, whereas those triggered by s.c. AMs secreted more IL-4 (Fig. 5e and f).",

By contrast, gel-like alums exist in micron-sized clusters and are known, and evidenced again in this report, able to promote only humoral reactions besides the infeasibility of pulmonary immunization due to its sticky property and local irritations [31, 32]. The sticky property is apparently resulted from the gels aggregated at administration site and aggravated by secreted mucus leading, possibly, to pulmonary obstruction. Local irritation may arise from actions and disturbance exerted by bulk alum on the contacted cell membranes [46]. These effects may also present high stress and even damages to cells, thus aborting cellular uptake and immune responses while causing irritating inflammation instead (Figs. 2 and 3b) [28, 31].",

Pulmonary vaccination favors setup of mucosal immunity across most of human organs, especially, the respiratory system and should be particularly beneficial for defending against the airborne pathogens, such as flu, MERS and SARS-CoV2, which is now just rapidly spreading throughout the world [48]. The tendency of ANs to facilitate cellular immunity observed in this report was also specifically described in a previous study, wherein alum was engineered as nanosized rods loaded with the recombinant tuberculosis Ags [36]. These outcomes support a correlation between the alum size and immunological response [49], although the underlying mechanism remains still elusive but may well be argued here to function as a resulted of APC internalization of the VADS and Ag lysosomal escape (Fig. 3b). Also, minimizing alum into nanoparticles remarkably enhances the VADS traffic to the draining lymph nodes, wherein different types of functional cells have an enlarged chance to be stimulated by vaccines to orchestrate to improve immunological reactions contributing to elevated immunity [14, 37, 38].",

Compared with coarse alum adjuvant, ANs showed enhanced biocompatibility and safety and, especially, the ability for delivering antigens to pulmonary immune cells. Moreover, ANs possessed the adjuvanticity of helping model antigens induce both humoral and cellular immune responses at systemic as well as mucosal level via pulmonary administration. Therefore, ANs may be a promising mucosal VADS for delivering vaccines against pathogens, particularly, the ones that invade hosts via respiratory system, such as MERS and SARS coronaviruses.",
