This situation requires the selection of specific strategies to be used in the doctor-patient relationship. Historically, two key options have been trialled to promote behaviour change, confronting and collaborating. A vast amount of evidence from the scientific literature pleads for the latter as being a more effective change method than the former [10] . However, recent accounts from the field of eating disorders suggest that collaborating could elicit verbal rather than behavioural motivation, which in turn can obstruct recovery [11] .

In fact, our way of life, and progress in general, have been obtained as a direct consequence of energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions. This is precisely because it deeply contradicts the lifestyles of wealthy societies that such a withdrawal strategy seems counter-intuitive and therefore has little chances to reunite enough participants to be effective ( Table 2 ). 6.

For Greta Thunberg, as for so many others, only two options can explain that political leaders are currently failing to act against climate change: their evilness or their actual lack of understanding of the problem. Here, I plead for a more realistic option, that is, lack of political action is a direct consequence of their ambivalencewhich is also that of our society. Climate action can save the world, but it can also seriously perturb the lifestyle we are so attached to. The originality of this qualitative study comes from its psychiatric lens: interpreting politicians' inaction against climate change as a core motivational issue, politicians may resemble patients that are stuck with inaction.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 263, "end": 267, "text": "[35]", "ref_id": "BIBREF38"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Summary of findings"}, {"text": "I have used scientific evidence from the literature on motivational change and clinical analogies from the eating disorders field to critically analyse current attitudes aiming at promoting action. On the one hand, discounting the challenges that politicians have to face on a day-to-day basis, and reacting emotionally or forcefully as if they were \"evil\", is equivalent to playing a power struggle, which risks increasing their resistance to change. On the other hand, adding more arguments, discussions and statements of intents to the table, as if politicians had not understood the climate problem, risks feeding their manifestos without promoting active change. Going a step further, I have discussed withdrawal from politicians' manifestos as a third strategy that could create change. Yet, both disability training (based on scientific warnings) and disinvestment (from public institutions) have only little chances to succeed. This is because the benefits of climate action are seriously outweighed by the benefits that are dependent on our current greenhouse gas emissions, even after bypassing the manifestos.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Summary of findings"}, {"text": "Some have termed the discrepancy between climate facts and climate inaction a \"climate paradox\" and have discussed better communication methods as a way to promote climate action [36] .

This may better reflect the root cause, as well as the deadlocks, of the climate paradox. Under the motivational framework emphasis is put on the very strong value of greenhouse gas emissions (as a force for no-change), which systematically outweighs potential reasons for change.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 179, "end": 183, "text": "[36]", "ref_id": "BIBREF39"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Summary of findings"}, {"text": "Communication strategies to reverse politicians' decisional balance have all great potential, however, counteracting strategies from those who do not want to lose the values attached to greenhouse gas emissions are arguably at least as powerful.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Summary of findings"}, {"text": "Political manifestos are used in this line, to continue with business-as-usual, greenhouse gas-related, social norms whilst also promising change.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Summary of findings"}, {"text": "First, despite striking similarities between the clinical and climate situations, an important difference is that the latter involves many more actors than the former. This is of particular significance for the withdrawal strategy. Strategic withdrawal from the therapist removes the benefits of the patients' manifesto because the clinical situation involves a \"simple\" patient-therapist interaction. Conversely, in the climate situation, the multiplicity of interactions between different social groups complicates the power and pressure plays. In that sense, it is possible that withdrawal (e.g. with scientists' warnings or school boycotts) will have no effect on a politician's interaction with social groups that are not participating in the strategy. In turn, a politician's manifesto could still have a role to play when interacting with these social groups. This potential limitation is however orthogonal to the other, core drawback of the withdrawal strategy discussed in this paper, that is, the compelling benefits of the disorder (in the clinical situation) and of greenhouse gas emissions (in the climate situation).", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Study limitations"}, {"text": "Second, it could be argued that politicians are simply waiting for greater demands from citizens to implement climate action and that one should focus on finding strategies to influence citizens, rather than politicians per se. If a politician's decisions follow the demands of citizens, however, it is likely that the decisional balance of citizens is similar to that of politicians. In that sense, citizens facing climate change would also be subject to a core motivational dilemma and the three investigated strategies would lead to similar roadblocks than for politicians.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Study limitations"}, {"text": "Confirming these predictions, for instance by comparing politicians vs. citizens motivation using semi-structured interviews could be an interesting prospect for future research.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Study limitations"}, {"text": "A third important issue is that of temporality. One might be tempted to think that political climate action is only a matter of time, especially if climate-related demonstrations, conferences, warnings or boycotts, as well as ecological or economic disasters, increase in number (and the COVID-19 crisis could potentially be an important trigger for climate action [37] ). Yet, while there is potential for a politician's manifesto to turn into action at some point, parts of the planet might already be inhabitable by then. To avoid this situation, this study pleads for a discontinuation of current strategies aiming at promoting climate action.

Greenhouse gas emissions being at the core of our normative way of life, enhanced methods may be necessary to change our mindset about climate change. Enforcing strict constraints to impose climate action, for instance through authoritarian governance or dictatorship, is a potential solution that we obviously would like to avoid, just as we all tend to avoid sectioning patients to impose weight gain in anorexia. A more interesting and viable option may reside in increasing the level of support to those who need to change. In anorexia, adolescents have good evidence of recovery with family-based therapy [38, 39] , and increasing the level of care into a day programme or full-time hospitalisation has shown good (and persistent) rates of remission [40] . In the world of climate change, the solution might also come from solid, powerful and effective institutions that could support politicians to create change, for instance justice, education, businesses and cultural industries.

Moreover, some educational systems [43] , but also music bands [44] , sport stars [45] and even airline companies [46, 47] have acknowledged the climate problem or even started to decrease their greenhouse gas-related activities. Here, rather than simply confronting, discussing, or withdrawing from reassuring speeches, these institutions and industries may have implemented the very first steps towards the adoption of more sustainable practices, and as such could be setting examples for policy-makers.
