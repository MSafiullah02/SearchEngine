One definition of public health illustrates its breadth and focus:the promotion of health and the prevention of disease and disability; the collection and use of epidemiological data, population surveillance, and other forms of empirical quantitative assessment; a recognition of the multidimensional nature of the determinants of health; and a focus on the complex interactions of many factors \u2013 biological, behavioral, social, and environmental \u2013 in developing effective interventions (Childress et al. 2002).\nLawrence O. Gostin (2001) further highlights the critical role of collective entities like communities and governments in ensuring the public\u2019s health because although individuals, given the means, can do many things to protect their own health, there are health benefits such as a healthy environment, safe roads, potable water and clean air that require \u201corganized and sustained community activities\u201d. In short, public health programs deliver to populations health benefits that cannot be effectively secured on an individual or small group basis (Childress et al. 2002).",

It envisions medical care in which \u201cdrugs and drug doses are made safer and more effective because they are chosen according to an individual\u2019s genetic makeup\u201d (Lesko 2007). Others, such as the Ickworth Group (Burke et al. 2010), characterize personalized medicine as any medical \u201ccare that is tailored to the individual or stratified by the population subgroup\u201d. Common to all of these definitions is the emphasis on customizing therapy to the individual patient. Indeed, for as long as clinicians have been caring for patients, medicine has been personalized (Ramsey 1961), but it is the accelerant of genetic technology that has led some to think that today\u2019s medicine has the potential to be even more \u201cpersonalized\u201d than its historical predecessors.",

            "text": "Of course, with the benefit of further reflection, the contrast between personalized medicine and public health is not so stark. For instance, the collectivist approach of public health does not preclude a role for clinical interventions and choices at the individual level. Moreover, the claim that the treatment of a sick individual improves the health of the population of which she is a member is all but tautologous. Vaccination is an example that fits both conditions. Seen this way, personalized medicine and public health are not mutually exclusive, but rather incompletely overlapping. The goals of public health practice certainly include the impact on the health of individuals, and included in the potential value of a genomic approach to medical care is its generalizability to the public\u2019s health, for example through better screening and prevention programs (Burke et al. 2010). Recognition of this potential for demonstrating the relationship between public health and genomics is evident in a new area of study complete with its own journal, Public Health Genomics that hopes to address some of these very issues. It has been noted, for instance, thata better understanding of what lies between the genes that make up the genome, the role of the environment on gene expression and the role of the interaction between genes will help us to know why some individuals remain healthy while others are more susceptible to genetic diseases. This understanding will also benefit the public health sector where the prevention and expression of communicable and infectious diseases, for example, is related in part to understanding genetic susceptibility\u2026 (Knoppers et al. 2010).\nThe Ickworth Group recently examined the potential for genomics and personalized medicine to inform public health practice and concluded that much still needs to be done before the promise can be realized (Burke et al. 2010). In particular, they made six recommendations:Efforts to integrate genomics into public health and practice should continue.An appropriate research infrastructure for generating an evidence base for genomic medicine needs to be established and maintained.Model public health genomics programs and clinical services need to be developed, implemented and evaluated.International collaborations should be promoted.Appropriate genetic services and genome-based research should be fostered within low and middle income countries.Programs, research and strategies in public health genomics should be informed by accepted ethical principles and practices.Such qualified support for the potential for genomic impact on public health is not surprising, as others have commented on the status of promises made and kept (Evans et al. 2011; Hall et al. 2010).",

The storied history of the many uses of biological materials that help to improve the understanding, clinical diagnosis and treatment of human disease is long and impressive with detailed reports of the clinical value of banked specimens dating to the early eighteenth century (Ackerknecht 1967; Korn 2000). Without access to stored specimens of blood, urine, tumors, body tissues, DNA and other human biological materials, important advances in cancer, infectious disease, cardiovascular care and mental disorders would not have been possible (Nat\u2019l Bioethics Adv. Comm. 2000). For example, the Pap smear would not have been developed (Younge et al. 1949) and the nonsteroidal estrogen hormone, diethylstilbestrol (DES), would not have been found to be carcinogenic (Herbst 1981). Without the knowledge gained from autopsies of Korean War veterans, science would have known less about the age of onset for atherosclerosis (Enos et al. 1955). Moreover, the CDC would not have been able to isolate and understand the Hantavirus (Wrobel 1995) and researchers would not have been able to make progress on certain brain tumors (Will et al. 1996). No doubt researchers hoping to understand the impact of radiation leaks on residents near the Fukushima nuclear plant in Japan will make use of the Chernobyl Tissue Bank established in 1998 to study the effects from (until this point) the world\u2019s foremost nuclear plant disaster (http://www.chernobyltissuebank.com).",

For example, the international community, led by Canadian researchers, was able to rapidly sequence the SARS virus from obtained specimens (Marra et al. 2003). Others used similar technology for the H1N1 virus (Graham et al. 2011; Zhang and Chen 2009), dramatically shortening the time it took to understand the nature of the threat and prepare a public health response. Moreover, the prospect of using genome technology on already stored specimens for enhanced genetic diagnostics, drug development, and even domestic and international security threat analysis (Meslin 2003; Bugl et al. 2007; Atlas 2002) offers a glimpse into the future of a genetically-informed public health capacity for nation-states. Indeed, it is the fortuitous combination of genomics and pharmacology that gives rise to the most promising example of personalized medicine\u2014the field of pharmacogenomics (Evans 2006; Evans et al. 2004; Desta and Flockhart 2007).",

The vectors of medicine and public health diverged further when schools of medicine and public health in the United States were officially separated in 1916 (Khoury et al. 2007), in part due to the conflicting goals of professionals in the fields (Porter 2006). Additional ideas include \u201cthe rise of medical authority with the expansion of hospital-based specialist practices\u201d (Porter 2006) as well as a corresponding split between individualist and collectivist modes of analysis in the social sciences (Arah 2009).

For instance, postwar antismoking campaigns in Great Britain set a trend that involved educating and influencing individual behavior and lifestyles (Porter 2006). The approach, later adopted to combat heart disease, obesity and cancer, helped solidify the individualist and behavioral model already prevalent in clinical medicine (Beauchamp 1985; Porter 2006). Hence, the population perspective implicit in public health ethics was at times at odds with the individualist methods employed to serve the public\u2019s health. A further rationale for the individualist bias of bioethics is the backlash against the misuse of population-based policies in the field of eugenics, resulting in an understandable suspicion of collectivist bioethical analysis (Pernick 1997; Kirkman 2005; Lombardo 2011).",

For this reason, modern human rights, arising entirely outside the health domain, and seeking to articulate the societal level preconditions for human well-being, seems a more useful framework, vocabulary, and template for public health efforts to analyze and respond directly to the societal determinants of health than any framework inherited from the past biomedical or public health tradition.

The two classes of rights reflected the ideological priorities of the contending sides and were enshrined in two separate treaties in the 1960s. The International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (1966) (ICCPR) reflected the capitalist and liberal emphasis on such rights as free speech, freedom of movement, freedom of religion, the right to vote and the right to privacy. These civil and political rights required governments to refrain from interfering with the liberties of their individual citizens.",

In part due to their being costlier than civil and political rights and also because of their questionable justiciability (i.e., their enforcement in courts of law) (Tarantola 2008), social and economic rights were not given the same priority as civil and political rights by governments. The main result of this focus on individualist civil and political rights is that many governments have not invested as heavily in addressing issues at societal or population level\u2014issues such as housing, education and health.

The reasons he provides in support of a human rights framework include the fact that much biomedical activity has clear human rights implications (e.g., the rights to life and physical integrity); human rights have developed into a transcultural ethical discourse with the potential for setting common standards; and there are few if any other viable mechanisms that can serve as a \u201cglobal normative foundation\u201d. Considering the then incipient UNESCO Universal Declaration on Bioethics and Human Rights, T. A. Faunce (2005) noted the increasing application of human rights to address challenges traditionally considered within the sole purview of bioethics and medical ethics. In the narrower context of genomics, Knoppers (2000) has argued that benefit-sharing in the context of genetic research \u201cis an aspect of fundamental human rights and serves to counterbalance the effects of commercialization and patenting\u201d. She has also proposed human rights as a compelling model for policy governing new genetic technologies (Knoppers 2004).",

His first criticism is that such a framework pays inadequate attention to the structural and social effects of genetic information. He argues that because economic, racial, ethnic and power disparities already exist between groups in societies, genetic information used without ethical oversight can exacerbate these differences and result in discrimination and exclusion. Iles infers that human rights may adequately protect individuals facing genetic profiling in employment or insurance contexts, but it is questionable whether the framework\u2019s individualist lens can monitor the effects of genetic information on relations between and among groups. Iles\u2019 second criticism of the applicability of human rights as a foundation for ethical uses of genomics is that individual freedom of choice regarding the use of genetic information can have an aggregate population-wide effect. For example, the choice parents make to have a \u201cnormal\u201d child rather than one with a \u201ccomparatively inert and tolerable\u201d disorder is not only heavily influenced by society\u2019s values but also determines eventually the society\u2019s constitution (Iles 1996).

These included \u201csecuring peace after the First and Second World Wars, achieving freedom for colonial peoples, reducing the gross economic inequalities between developed and underdeveloped countries, and preserving a healthy environment when the technologies in one nation seriously damage an environment shared by all nations\u201d (Wellman 2000).

It is a particular instance of the ethical principle underlying solidarity rights, which proposes that community is not an elective component of human well-being.

As its official title suggests, the Banjul Charter includes the concept of peoples\u2019 rights, which, like the collective rights of indigenous peoples, is a version of group rights. The Banjul Charter deliberately omits a definition of the term \u201cpeople,\u201d thereby leaving the term open to several interpretations, e.g., persons struggling to gain political independence, persons living in a territory and sharing certain characteristics, or simply all people living in a country (Kiwanuka 1988). Whatever their precise legal definition, peoples\u2019 rights in the Banjul Charter are based on the African philosophical belief that a human being is not \u201can isolated and abstract individual, but an integral member of a group animated by a spirit of solidarity\u201d (Kiwanuka 1988). The kinship between this African principle and the ethical norms undergirding solidarity rights and the rights of indigenous peoples discussed above is evident.

First, it may avoid having to resolve the seemingly interminable debate about the proper approach to obtaining individual informed consent for research using human biological materials. In situations in which groups may be consulted, approached and from which permission to participate in biobanks may be sought, informed consent may be necessary but not a sufficient mechanism for engaging a community. Second, it recognizes the institutionalization and application of human rights discourse at international forums by providing tools for discussing the values of public health across national borders. This is important in light of observations by recent commentators of a linguistic shift with both practical and ethical implications: the gradual transition of the term \u201cinternational health\u201d to \u201cglobal health.\u201d \u201cInternational health\u201d was used to describe a technical endeavor conducted jointly by developing countries and their partners in the industrialized world through such large institutions as the World Health Organization (WHO) and CARE International (Elmendorf 2010).

Importantly, the terminological shift from \u201cinternational\u201d to \u201cglobal health\u201d is also reflected in the bioethics literature (Chadwick et al. 2011). A specific example of the application of \u201cglobal\u201d rather than \u201cinternational\u201d health is the \u201cOne World, One Health\u201d initiative, a framework that builds on efforts to contain the avian influenza outbreak (FAO et al. 2008).

In a publication on health and human rights, WHO (2002) notes that[w]ithin the human rights community, certain trends associated with globalization have raised concern with respect to their effect on states\u2019 capacity to ensure the protection of human rights, especially for the most vulnerable members of society. Located primarily in the economic-political realm of globalization, these trends include: an increasing reliance upon the free market; a significant growth in the influence of international financial markets and institutions in determining national policies; cutbacks in public sector spending; the privatization of functions previously considered to be the exclusive domain of the state; and the deregulation of a range of activities with a view to facilitating investment and rewarding entrepreneurial initiative. These trends serve to reduce the role of the state in economic affairs, and at the same time increase the role and responsibilities of private (non-state) actors, especially those in corporate business, but also those in civil society.\nThis transfer of responsibilities from governments to private actors is critical because the operation of international law depends both on governments assuming legal obligations by signing agreements and on these governments being held accountable for fulfilling the responsibilities they undertake. Generally speaking and despite recent changes in international criminal law, private actors are not accountable under public international law, the branch of international law to which human rights belong (Jessberger 2010). Hence, the transfer of governmental responsibilities such as health provision to private actors removes a growing number of issues from the direct supervision of human rights. Governments retain the duty to ensure that private actors such as transnational corporations do not violate human rights, but monitoring and enforcing the norms remains a major challenge (Gruskin et al. 2007; Tarantola 2008).",

We noted also how the change was reflected in the explicit recognition of \u201ccollective\u201d rights in the 2007 United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples. These rights \u201coperate at an international level to assure public goods that can only be enjoyed in common with similarly-situated individuals and thus cannot be realized through individual rights claims against the state\u201d (Meier and Fox 2010). The premise grounding the recognition of collective rights is that the realization of some human rights is simply not reducible to their exercise by an aggregate of individuals. Harmon (2008) writes that social solidarity has been incorporated, even if implicitly, into UNESCO\u2019s major instruments on genomic research, namely the Universal Declaration on the Human Genome and Human Rights (1997) and the Universal Declaration on Bioethics and Human Rights (2005). He maintains that the emergent notion of social solidarity mitigates the excesses of modern individualism and is \u201cgrounded in the recognition that individuals are socially embedded\u201d. His analysis of the UNESCO documents describes a solidarity based on the fundamental unity of all humans, a focus on \u201cthe collective, the observance of duties and the creation and preservation, through personal and collective action, of a just and decent society\u201d.",

Developed in the context of international law governing the management of resources in outer space and the high seas, this concept is founded on three basic principles: \u201c(1) absence of private property rights i.e. the right [usually of governments] to use resources but not to own them; (2) international management of all uses of the common heritage; and (3) sharing of benefits derived from such use\u201d (White 1982). Also included in the concept is an obligation to use the resource in a peaceful and responsible way, keeping the resource accessible to all and considering the interests of future generations (Knoppers 2005a).",

First, collective rights, premised conceptually on the fact that certain rights can be protected only in groups, is virtually analogous to the population perspective of public health, which presumes that certain health challenges require society-wide, rather than individual, interventions. The kinship of the two perspectives is highlighted in the argument made by Meier and Fox (2010) that public health be recognized as a collective right. Second, the classification of genetic databases as the common heritage of humanity, which precludes private ownership while requiring shared uses and benefits, buttresses the view that biobanks should be managed under principles that consider the whole of humanity rather than narrower interests, no matter how seemingly benign. Again, these principles would share an affinity with the principles of public health that target the health of the whole population. Third, the arguments for the status of genetic information as a non-rivalrous and non-excludable global public good also support an approach to managing biobanks that recognizes the public character of the resource. Together, these features ground the management of international biobanking in a framework that keeps foremost the population perspective of public health.",

Commentators have pointed out the costs associated with this infusion of private funding. They raise concerns that such involvementmay influence the type of research, distort the process by restricting the direction of research, prevent collaboration, and restrict the sharing of the raw data generated by the research. It also might prevent the results of the research being disseminated effectively or cause publication bias. Most importantly, it may serve to reduce public trust in the research process. Some evidence suggests that potential participants may be less willing to engage in research if this is privately funded (as they perceive themselves to be more exposed to potential exploitation) (Ickworth 2010).\nThe risks expand significantly when, as projected, biobanking expands globally. Most LMICs have vulnerable populations and lax to minimal research regulation. But even where LMIC governments have the ability to regulate research activity, we have noted above the growing trend under globalization for governments to delegate traditional responsibilities to private actors. This constitutes a major administrative and ethical challenge in the regulation of biobanks because, as a rule, governments rather than private actors assume international obligations (Ratner 2001). The situation requires an ethical framework for protecting vulnerable populations living under governments either unwilling or incapable of protecting their interests.",
