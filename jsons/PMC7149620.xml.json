In settings where voluntary and public resources are insufficient to provide long-term care, millions of children initially cared for by relatives have now been orphaned. However, many guardians themselves get sick or become overwhelmed by the number of dependents for whom they have to provide care. The growing number of street children and child-headed households are often the outcomes of a chain of events that begin with the HIV infection of a mother, her partner, or both.\n",

Disseminated disease with Mycobacterium avium complex may occur in children with HIV and advanced immunologic deterioration.

The largest proportion of newly diagnosed children with HIV in many US centers are foreign born and at higher risk of prior and potentially ongoing exposure to TB. TB is almost always transmitted to children by an adult, most commonly a household contact, and the infection in children is primary infection rather than reactivated disease as in adults. There should be an increased index of suspicion of TB infection and disease in children with HIV, particularly in the context of clinical wasting and a low threshold for empiric antituberculosis therapy, even when diagnostic investigations fail to identify a TB-causing organism.",

Reduced BMD secondary to cART administration was first described in 2001 from DEXA scans in vertically infected children, with the severity of osteopenia directly related to lipodystrophy [51].

Enteral supplementation with gastrostomy feeding has improved nutrition in a number of chronic childhood illnesses by providing adequate energy intake to promote weight gain when oral intake is poor. Miller et al. [37] first investigated the effects of gastrostomy tube feeding on weight gain, height, body composition, immune parameters, morbidity, and mortality in 1995 on 26 children with HIV. Weight Z-scores before therapy were \u20131.6 and had decreased to \u20132.2 on initiation of nasogastric feedings. Gastrostomy tube feedings significantly improved weight Z-scores to get back to baseline approximately 5 months after initiation of feeding. Significant predictors of response to gastrostomy tube feedings included higher CD4 counts at initiation and lower weight-for-height Z-scores at baseline. These findings suggested that early intervention during acute weight loss offers the best chances of improving weight in children with HIV. Children with the greatest improvement in weight after gastrostomy tube placement spent less time in hospital and had a greater likelihood of survival compared with children who did not gain weight [37]. This small but important study demonstrated that early nutritional intervention improved quality of life and reduced morbidity in children with HIV at a time when effective cART was unavailable. In the cART era, compliance with medical therapy is often improved with more reliable delivery of ARVs through the gastrostomy tube and is associated with improved CD4 T-lymphocyte counts, virologic suppression, and improved longitudinal growth.",

            "text": "In the 1980s and early 1990s, the devastating effects of HIV infection on the health of infants, children, and adolescents became apparent and required a rapid and effective response globally. Over time, in the United States, with the introduction of ARVs, the clinical manifestations associated with HIV infection as well as its treatment were seen to increase, driven by the short- and long-term toxicities of these new formulations in combination. In children with HIV, these manifestations reflected metabolic changes; wasting and stunting from gastrointestinal dysfunction were most often described in the 1980s, but new clinical concerns in the early 2000s were related to altered body composition, lipid abnormalities, and abnormal regulation of glucose metabolism. These complications were often attributed to the first-generation NRTIs and PIs. The long-term cardiovascular risks of these ARVs on subjects with HIV are still unknown. After 2007, newer PIs and integrase inhibitors became more widely available and appear to have fewer metabolic adverse effects, although ongoing surveillance of these ARVs and tenofovir will be important to evaluate incidences of renal tubular dysfunction and BMD.",

These principles include ongoing comprehensive nutritional assessments and follow-up. When cART providing effective viral suppression was unavailable, enteral and parenteral support was associated with improved weight and body composition and overall survival and is still a key part of care for children and adolescents who present with advanced HIV disease. In addition, periodic vitamin A supplementation in children with HIV who are older than 6 months of age is supported by clinical trials in Africa. Children with HIV should also receive zinc supplements in the management of diarrhea and severe acute malnutrition in the same way as uninfected children with the same conditions. Investigators should continue to study the effects of oral hypoglycemic agents, lipid-lowering medications, and lifestyle changes on cardiovascular risk factors in patients with lipodystrophy and hyperlipidemia at this time when obesity has become endemic in many communities in the United States. This unfortunate development on long-term health also has implications for children and adolescents with HIV across the United States.",
