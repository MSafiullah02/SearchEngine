To explore the potential intermediate animal host of the SARS-CoV-2 virus, we reanalyzed virome data sets from pangolins and representative SARS-related coronaviruses isolates from bats, with particular attention paid to the spike glycoprotein gene. We performed phylogenetic, split network, transmission network, likelihood-mapping, and comparative analyses of the genomes. Based on Bayesian time-scaled phylogenetic analysis using the tip-dating method, we estimated the time to the most recent common ancestor and evolutionary rate of SARS-CoV-2, which ranged from 22 to 24 November 2019 and 1.19 to 1.31 \u00d7 10 \u22123 substitutions per site per year, respectively. Our results also revealed that the BetaCoV/bat/Yunnan/RaTG13/2013 virus was more similar to the SARS-CoV-2 virus than the coronavirus obtained from the two pangolin samples (SRR10168377 and SRR10168378). We also identified a unique peptide (PRRA) insertion in the human SARS-CoV-2 virus, which may be involved in the proteolytic cleavage of the spike protein by cellular proteases, and thus could impact host range and transmissibility. Interestingly, the coronavirus carried by pangolins did not have the RRAR motif. Therefore, we concluded that the human SARS-CoV-2 virus, which is responsible for the recent outbreak of COVID-19, did not come directly from pangolins.

Previous studies revealed that both SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV are zoonotic in origin, originally coming from bats, [9] [10] [11] [12] with SARS-CoV spreading from bats to palm civets to humans, [13] [14] [15] and MERS-CoV spreading from bats to camels to humans. 16, 17 Recent research has also reported that the SARS-CoV-2 virus likely originated in bats, a proposal based on the similarity of its genetic sequence to that of other known coronaviruses. 18 However, like SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and many other coronaviruses, the SARS-CoV-2 virus may have been transmitted to humans by an intermediate animal host. 19 Therefore, the identity of the animal source of SARS-CoV-2 remains a key and urgent question. Furthermore, to stem future outbreaks of this type and preventing the transmission of zoonotic diseases to humans should be a top research priority.",

We also identified six transmission clusters (number of sequences 2 to 23) when the genetic distance between the SARS-CoV-2 strains was <0.001% substitutions/site ( Figure 5) . However, our conclusions should be considered preliminary and explained with caution due to the limited number of SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences presented in this study. As more genome sequences become available, there may be stronger among-lineage rate variation over time as to warrant using a relaxed clock model, but we anticipate that the evolutionary rates and TMRCA dates will be broadly similar to those estimated here. As the number of substitutions is still small, it is tempting to speculate that sequencing errors could have a considerable impact on the evolutionary rate and TMRCA date estimates.

This insertion constitutes an RRAR motif in the spike protein at the junction of S1 and S2 junction in the human SARS-CoV-2 virus, after considering the next amino acid (R) of the unique peptide (PRRA) ( Figure S6 ). Of note, the highly favored motifs for furin cleavage are Arg-X-(Arg/Lys)-Arg (RXRR or RXKR), and the minimal motifs for furin cleavage can be RXXR. 48 We also note that some of the other coronaviruses have a furin motif in almost the same location in their spike proteins. 49, 50 Lentiviruses have an RKXR (R, arginine; K, lysine; X, any amino acid) site between gp120 and gp41, cleaved by furin to convert gp160 into subunits. [51] [52] [53] [54] Therefore, it is tempting to speculate that cleavage or lack of cleavage of the spike protein at this site could significantly impact host range and transmissibility. Taken together, the pangolin coronavirus samples (SRR10168377 and SRR10168378) were less similar to the SARS-CoV-2 virus than to the BetaCoV/bat/Yunnan/ RaTG13/2013 virus and did not have the RRAR motif. Therefore, we concluded that the human SARS-CoV-2 virus, which is responsible for the current outbreak of COVID-19, did not come directly from pangolins. However, due to the limited viral metagenomic data obtained from pangolins, we cannot exclude that other pangolins from China may contain coronaviruses that exhibit greater similarity to the SARS-CoV-2 virus.",
