An oligo-based microarray was employed to analyse mRNAs from rhabdomyosarcoma cells infected with the MS/7423/87 strain of enterovirus 71 (EV71) at 20 h post infection. Using Acuity software and LOWESS normalization, 152 genes were found to be downregulated while 39 were upregulated by greater than twofold. Altered transcripts include those encoding components of cytoskeleton, protein translation and modification; cellular transport proteins; protein degradation mediators; cell death mediators; mitochondrial-related and metabolism proteins; cellular receptors and signal transducers. Changes in expression profiles of 15 representative genes were authenticated by real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), which also compared the transcriptional responses of cells infected with EV71 strain 5865/Sin/ 000009 isolated from a fatal case during the Singapore outbreak in 2000. Western blot analyses of APOB, CLU, DCAMKL1 and ODC1 proteins correlated protein and transcript levels. Two-dimensional proteomic maps highlighted differences in expression of cellular proteins (CCT5, CFL1, ENO1, HSPB1, PSMA2 and STMN1) following EV71 infection. Expression of several apoptosis-associated genes was modified, coinciding with apoptosis attenuation observed in poliovirus infection. Interestingly, doublecortin and CaM kinase-like 1 (DCAMKL1) involved in brain development, was highly expressed during infection. Thus, microarray, real-time RT-PCR and proteomic analyses can elucidate the global view of the numerous and complex cellular responses that contribute towards EV71 pathogenesis.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Abstract"}], "body_text": [{"text": "Enterovirus 71 (EV71) was first identified in 1969 in California, when it was isolated from the feces of an infant suffering from encephalitis (Schmidt et al ., 1974) .

The virus is also associated with non-neurological diseases like hand, foot and mouth disease (HFMD), herpangina and pulmonary oedema. Among young children, EV71 is a notable cause of central nervous system (CNS) disease that usually results in rapid clinical deterioration and death, the molecular pathogenesis of which is still elusive (Kehle et al ., 2003) . In Singapore, the major EV71 outbreak in 2000 involved 6402 cases with four deaths (Singh et al ., 2002a) , and prompted the closure of pre-school centres for about 2 weeks.

This is also observed in the related and widely studied poliovirus (Barco et al ., 2000; Goldstaub et al ., 2000; Calandria et al ., 2004) , which belongs to the same genus as EV71. Apoptosis is a complex mechanism that involves a network of cross-talk and multiple specifically controlled pathways. The process may be triggered by the interactions of the pro-apoptotic stimuli with various sensors such as the receptor-mediated pathway through caspase 8, mitochondrial-related pathway through caspase 9 (Desagher and Martinou, 2000) and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress-triggered pathway through caspase 12 (Nakagawa et al ., 2000) . Apoptosis in viral infection is the host response to lyse prematurely in order to curtail the reproductive cycle of the virus (Clem and Miller, 1993) . In addition, the significance of apoptosis is to enable macrophages to phagocytose dead cells in order to prevent dysregulated inflammatory reactions, and to initiate specific immune responses in the infected host (Sun and Shi, 2001) . However, the immune response can also result in apoptosis of uninfected cells, which causes enhanced immunosuppression or specific organ toxicity (Ahr et al ., 2004) .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 240, "end": 259, "text": "(Kuo et al ., 2002)", "ref_id": "BIBREF49"}, {"start": 267, "end": 285, "text": "(Li et al ., 2002)", "ref_id": "BIBREF55"}, {"start": 355, "end": 376, "text": "(Barco et al ., 2000;", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}, {"start": 377, "end": 401, "text": "Goldstaub et al ., 2000;", "ref_id": "BIBREF34"}, {"start": 402, "end": 426, "text": "Calandria et al ., 2004)", "ref_id": "BIBREF11"}, {"start": 792, "end": 821, "text": "(Desagher and Martinou, 2000)", "ref_id": "BIBREF25"}, {"start": 897, "end": 921, "text": "(Nakagawa et al ., 2000)", "ref_id": "BIBREF62"}, {"start": 1050, "end": 1073, "text": "(Clem and Miller, 1993)", "ref_id": "BIBREF21"}, {"start": 1290, "end": 1309, "text": "(Sun and Shi, 2001)", "ref_id": "BIBREF81"}, {"start": 1458, "end": 1477, "text": "(Ahr et al ., 2004)", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Introduction"}, {"text": "Besides apoptosis, the other host response is the development of canonical cytopathic effect (CPE) following productive poliovirus infection, which often leads to inflammation. Thus, the interplay of the two cell death processes highlights both apoptotic and antiapoptotic effects of poliovirus (Agol et al ., 2000; Belov et al ., 2003; Romanova et al ., 2005) . It is postulated that in early infection during which the poliovirus RNA genome is translated, sufficient quantities of pro-apoptotic proteins are synthesized to trigger an early apoptotic response. However, with the onset of viral replication, the apoptotic response is interrupted by the apoptosis-suppressing effect of the virus, which dominates the entire period of productive infection. Only at the later stages of infection such as after the development of CPE, can some signs of apoptosis be obvious (Carthy et al ., 1998) . Although many RNA viruses do not encode antiapoptotic genes and the mechanism of this apoptosis-suppressing effect is still unclear, enterovirus 2B protein which exhibits membrane permeabilizing activity (Agirre et al ., 2002) , may have a significant role. Campanella et al .

Expression of the TPT1 microtubule-stabilizing protein was also downregulated, which may promote an increase in microtubule dynamics (Yarm, 2002) observed in enterovirus infection. The guanine nucleotide dissociation inhibitor activity of TPT1 may also prevent eEF1A activation into eEF1A-GTP before it is recruited by other components of the translational machinery to form a complex with a de novo-aminoacylated tRNA (Cans et al., 2003) . Thus, decreasing TPT1 expression in infected cells may be a means to decrease the efficiency of host protein synthesis, to stifle cell proliferation, which allows the host's resources to be channelled to virus replication.

Its disruption will lead to an increase in hydrogen peroxide which can cause oxidative damage, and a decrease in cholesterol synthesis that may affect the integrity of cellular membranes. Furthermore, the synthesis of lipids for myelin production may also be compromised, and be potentially linked with the neurodegenerative disorders observed in certain EV71infected patients. On the other hand, the decrease in DNM1L will also limit its activity in the scission of the outer mitochondrial membrane, thus preventing caspase activation and subsequent apoptosis (Breckenridge et al., 2003) .

However, LDL is considered as an undesirable cholesterol, and APOB results in platelet activation (Relou et al., 2002) . An increase in both processes may enhance the risk of atherosclerosis and eventually myocardial infarction (Qureshi et al., 2002) . Indeed, enteroviruses have been detected in some patients with atherosclerosis (Kwon et al., 2004) . In contrast, CLU is a controversial protein whose accumulation may culminate in antiapoptotic (Miyake et al., 2004) as well as pro-apoptotic (Trougakos and Gonos, 2004) events. However, Chen et al. (2004) showed that the action of CLU is dependent on its two different isoforms, one nuclear, and the other secreted and cytoplasmic. Notably, overexpression of CLU is also observed in neurodegenerative diseases (Duguid et al., 1989) , which is relevant to the CNS disease model of enterovirus infection. Given the hypothesis that nuclear CLU function is pro-apoptotic, it would be interesting to investigate its isoforms as well as the localization of the upregulated CLU in EV71 infection. DCAMKL1, a protein involved in neuronal development, was very highly expressed during EV71 infection. It is a probable member of the Ser/Thr protein kinase family that may be involved in a calcium signalling pathway that controls neuronal migration in the developing brain (Burgess and Reiner, 2002) , and may also participate in functions of the mature nervous system. Although its significance in EV71 infection is yet to be elucidated, it may represent a scrambled effort by the host to salvage the hostile infection.

CFL1 is a member of the CFL/actin depolymerizing factor (ADF) family, which regulates actin dynamics by increasing the rate of actin depolymerization and facilitating actin filament turnover (Chen et al., 2000) . In neutrophils and neutrophil-like cells, the dephosphorylation of CFL1 and its translocation to F-actin-rich regions, correlate with the production of superoxide and hydrogen peroxide (Nagaishi et al., 1999) . This is congruent with the downregulation of DNM1L, which leads to an increase in hydrogen peroxide level. In cultured hippocampal and cortical neurons, mitochondrial dysfunction leads to the rapid dephosphorylation of ADF and CFL1, which coassemble with actin to form rods that span the diameter of the neurite and disrupt the normal cytoskeleton (Minamide et al., 2000) . Such persistent rods cause degeneration of the distal neurite without killing the neuron. These findings suggest a common pathway that can lead to loss of synapses, which mirrors the neurodegenerating disorder seen in some EV71-infected patients. Dephosphorylated CFL1 binds to actin and translocates into mitochondria, and actin cytoskeletal changes may enhance mitochondrial translocation of pro-apoptogenic proteins resulting in mitochondrial dysfunction, release of cytochrome c and apoptosis (Chua et al., 2003) . Thus, enhanced CFL1 level in EV71 infection and its dephosphorylation may lead to destruction of neuronal processes and the initiation of apoptosis in the late phase of infection, similar to poliovirus infection (Agol et al., 2000) .

Compared with wild-type p53, the C-terminally altered p53 protein inhibits both p53-dependent apoptosis and transactivation (Almog et al., 2000) ; binds more efficiently to DNA in a sequence-specific manner; and is more efficient in concentration-dependent transcriptional repression of the promoter of the p21 cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor gene.

The separated proteins were transferred to polyvinylidine difluoride membranes, reacted with 1:500 dilutions of the corresponding primary specific antibodies in TBST with 0.1% gelatin. This was followed by incubation with secondary anti-rabbit or anti-goat IgG conjugated with horseradish peroxidase at dilutions.

This strategy increased the mass of each protein that could be loaded onto the gel in order to bring the low abundance proteins into the dynamic range of detection, and also produced less crowded individual protein maps thus simplifying analysis and interpretation. The fractions were dialysed overnight against 30 mM Tris pH 8.5 and 7 M urea in mini-dialysis tubes (Amersham). The dialysed samples were concentrated using the 2-D clean up kit (Amersham). The proteins were then dissolved in rehydration buffer comprising 2% CHAPS, 2 M thiourea, 8 M urea and 0.5% IPG buffer. An equal amount of each protein fraction (\u223c250 \u00b5g) was loaded onto each 24-cm Immobiline DryStrip with pH range 4-7 or 6-9 (Amersham). The strips were later focused on the Ettan IPGphor isoelectric focusing system (Amersham) according to the manufacturer's recommendation. Prior to second dimension separation, each IPG strip was equilibrated with 10 ml of SDS equilibration buffer containing 50 mM Tris pH 8.8, 2% SDS, 30% glycerol, 6 M urea and 0.002% bromophenol blue. The SDS-PAGE separation process was performed at 18\u00b0C, and then stained with the silver stain plus kit (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA). The gel images were captured as 400 dpi TIFF format using ImageScanner (Amersham), and analysed using Delta2D v3.2 (DECODON, Greifswald, Germany). The differentially expressed protein spots were subjected to MALDI-TOF-TOF mass spectrometry analysis with automated database (Mascot) search for protein identification based on the peptide mass fingerprinting and partial sequence data.
