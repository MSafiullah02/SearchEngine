Notwithstanding the commonness of circulatory and endocrine comorbidities, patients with Covid-19 rarely reported as having comorbid respiratory diseases (particularly COPD).

It should be stressed that the observed frequency of comorbidity may also reflect the transmission dynamics within particular age groups, case detection or testing practices or hospital admission policies during the early phases of the epidemic.

A main limitation was the self-report of comorbidities on admission. Under-reporting of comorbidities, which could have stemmed from the lack of awareness and/or the lack of diagnostic testing, might contribute to the underestimation of the true strength of association with the clinical prognosis. Under-reporting of comorbidities could also lead to over-estimation of strength of association with adverse outcome. However, significant under-reporting was unlikely because the spectrum of our report was largely consistent with existing literature [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] and all patients were subject to a thorough history taking after hospital admission. The relatively low age might help explain the low prevalence of COPD in our cohort. Moreover, the duration of follow-up was relatively short and some patients remained in the hospital as of the time of writing. More studies that explore the associations in a sufficiently long time frame are warranted. Caution should be exercised when extrapolating our findings to other countries where there are outbreaks of Covid-19 since the prevalence of comorbidities may differ among different countries.
