            "text": "Post-weaning multisystemic wasting syndrome (PMWS) is a worldwide disease that debilitates nursery and fattening pigs with systemic lymphoadenopathy and interstitial pneumonia and has contributed to significant economic loss to swine industry (Allan et al., 1998, Ellis et al., 1998). Porcine circovirus 2 (PCV2) alone has been demonstrated to induce PMWS in gnotobiotic (Ellis et al., 1999), cesarean-derived colostrum-deprived (CD/CD) (Bolin et al., 2001), and specific pathogen-free (SPF) (Magar et al., 2000) pigs. However, experimental infection with PCV2 alone only produced minimal symptoms and mild bronchiolitis and interstitial pneumonia (Allan et al., 2000, Bolin et al., 2001, Ellis et al., 1999, Magar et al., 2000). Pigs with PMWS often had concurrent infection with porcine parvovirus (PPV) (Choi and Chae, 2000), porcine reproductive and respiratory virus (PRRSV) (Segal\u00e9s et al., 2002), or Aujeszky's disease virus (PRV) (Quintana et al., 2001). Experimental dual infection of PCV2 and PRRSV-induced PMWS in CD/CD pigs that had more severe interstitial pneumonia and enhanced replication and distribution of PCV2 in the tissues (Allan et al., 2000, Harms et al., 2001). These findings, therefore, suggest that the development of full-blown PMWS-induced clinical symptoms and pathological lesions requires other porcine pathogens as the co-factors.",

Alveolar macrophages (AMs) are essential defense cells in the lungs. However, there is no study addressing the effects of dual infection of PCV2 and PRRSV on swine AMs. Interferon-alpha (IFN-\u03b1) and/or tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-\u03b1) have been shown to possess anti-viral activity (Vilcek and Sen, 1996, Wong and Goeddel, 1986). Porcine respiratory coronavirus (PRCV)-induced IFN-\u03b1 was shown to interfere with PRRSV replication in the lungs of pigs, but PRRSV infection has little or no effect on the replication of PRCV in porcine lungs (Buddaert et al., 1998). Currently, the interaction between PCV2 and PRRSV in swine AMs and the production of cytokines associated with individual or dual infection are unclear. The purpose of the present study was to determine the effects of PCV2 and/or PRRSV infection on swine AMs regarding infectious rate, cell viability, apoptosis, production of IFN-\u03b1 and TNF-\u03b1, and the role of IFN-\u03b1 and TNF-\u03b1 in the interaction.",

After 1 h of incubation and PBS wash, the cells were counterstained with 1% Hoechst 33258 (Sigma) and mounted with coverslips. Apoptotic cells had green fluorescent nuclei. The percentage of AMs with apoptosis from each group was counted on a fluorescent microscope.",

Before the measurement, the culture supernatants collected at various incubation intervals were thawed and irradiated with UV light at a distance of 15 cm for 20 min by using a GL-15 UV lamp (15 W, Toshiba, Tokyo, Japan) to inactivate the remaining PCV2 and PRRSV. Complete inactivation was further confirmed in PK-15 or MARC-145 by IFA. The IFN titers were then determined by the CPE reduction bioassay using Madin\u2013Darby bovine kidney (MDBK) cells (kindly provided by National Veterinary Research Institute, Tamsui, Taiwan) and vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) (kindly provided by Dr. Tse-Wen Chang, Department of Life Sciences, National Tsing Hua University, Hsin-Chu, Taiwan). MDBK cells were seeded at 5 \u00d7 105\n cells/well in 96-well culture plates in 100 \u03bcl of DMEM-C. After overnight incubation and medium removal, 100 \u03bcl of serially two-fold diluted culture supernatants or recombinant porcine IFN-\u03b1 (Chemicon, Temecula, California, USA) used as a standard were added. Following another 18 h of incubation, 50 \u03bcl/well of VSV at an m.o.i. of 0.1 or DMEM-C were then added. Twenty-four hours later, CPE was examined by light microscopy. After removing the medium, the cells were washed with PBS and fixed with 4% PFA in PBS (pH 7.4) at room temperature (RT) for 10 min. After PBS wash, 100 \u03bcl/well of a 0.05% crystal violet solution in 20% ethanol were added and reacted at RT for 10 min. Following tap water rinse and drying, 100 \u03bcl/well of absolute methanol were added. The plates were gently agitated, and the optical densities (ODs) were read on an ELISA reader (Model EL311sx, Bio-Tek, Winooski, VT, USA) at 595 nm. All samples were tested in triplicate. Data were expressed as mean unit (U)/ml, where 1 unit of IFN-\u03b1 activity was defined as the reciprocal of the dilution producing 50% inhibition of CPE. To verify the anti-viral activity of IFN-\u03b1, culture supernatants were mixed with an equal volume of a mouse anti-recombinant porcine (rp) IFN-\u03b1 antibody at 1 \u03bcg/ml (Serotec, Oxford, England) before subjected to IFN-\u03b1 bioassay.",

In addition, PCV2 antigen is predominantly and persistently present in the cytoplasm of infected AMs. Such findings were consistent with others that despite the presence of persistent infectious virus, viral antigen, and viral DNA, there was no detectable viral replication and cellular injury in PCV2-infected swine AMs (Gilpin et al., 2003) and monocyte- or bone marrow-derived dendritic cells (Vincent et al., 2003). It has been suggested that PCV2 may enter dendritic cells by endocytosis rather than active infection (Vincent et al., 2003). In the present study, scattered pinpoint to small granular positive signals were detected as early as 1 h after the inoculation of either non-UV-treated or UV-inactivated PCV2 and the signal intensity in both groups increased with time in a similar pattern (data not shown). This indicated that PCV2 could indeed passively enter and accumulate in the cytoplasm of AMs. Antigens of PCV2 detected in AMs might result from active infection and passive endocytosis and/or phagocytosis. Thus, MPS lineage cells may function as an important reservoir to help PCV2 evade the immunosurveillance and also assist PCV2 to spread.",

As seen in a previous study (Chiou et al., 2000) and the present study, PRRSV-infected AMs had a low but constant infectious rate between 5 and 10%, markedly reduced cell viability, and significantly increased apoptosis and TNF-\u03b1 production. Currently, available data suggest that the low PRRSV infectious rate but prominent cell injury in AMs might well be the result of a non-viral indirect mechanism due to the bystander effect of the released PRRSV open reading frame 5 gene product (Suarez et al., 1996) or TNF-\u03b1 (Choi and Chae, 2002) from the infected cells. In the present study, significantly elevated TNF-\u03b1 production occurred in all PCV2 and/or PRRSV-infected groups, particularly in the PRRSV-A group. Co-infection of PCV2 and PRRSV is often seen in PMWS-affected pigs (Allan and Ellis, 2000, Segal\u00e9s et al., 2002). Compared to PRRSV infection alone, simultaneous PCV2 and PRRSV infection caused variable degrees of reduction in the PRRSV-associated infectious rate, cell death, and apoptosis of swine AMs. Such findings might have resulted from decrease in the infectivity and/or replication of PRRSV. A prior PRCV infection could interfer the subsequent swine influenza virus (SIV) replication in the lungs of pigs, characterized by markedly reduced nasal excretion and pulmonary infection of SIV; the PRCV-induced anti-viral activities were suggested due to the IFN-\u03b1 and TNF-\u03b1 released in the lungs (Van Reeth and Pensaert, 1994a, Van Reeth and Pensaert, 1994b). A similar anti-viral effect may also be present in PCV2-infected groups as evidenced by high levels of IFN-\u03b1 detected shortly after PCV2 infection in all PCV2-infected groups in the present study. The result indicates that PCV2 is a potent IFN-\u03b1 inducer for swine AMs and the released IFN-\u03b1 may contribute to the anti-viral effects to PRRSV in PCV2/PRRSV group.",

            "text": "Induction of type I IFNs by most RNA viruses is initiated by virus-derived double-stranded RNA produced during replication (Vilcek and Sen, 1996). For retro-, DNA-, and some RNA viruses, the interaction of viral envelope glycoproteins with host cell membrane serves as an alternative mechanism of IFN induction (Ankel et al., 1998, Capobianchi et al., 1992, Charley and Laude, 1988). PCV2 is a non-enveloped DNA virus and possesses a small and circular genome, which is quite similar to the plasmid DNA. The relatively high content of unmethylated CpG dinucleotides in plasmid DNA is known for its immunostimulatory activity in vertebrates, including cytokine production (Tighe et al., 1998). A recent study has shown that one out of five oligodeoxynucleotides (ODNs) with central CpG motifs selected from the genome of PCV2 exhibited an inhibitory activity in IFN-\u03b1 production in porcine peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), while the other four had a stimulatory effect; this inhibitory ODN also showed a complete or variable inhibitory action on other stimulatory ODNs or known inducers of IFN-\u03b1, respectively, and this particular genomic sequence was speculated to be associated with the immunosuppressive effect of PCV2 (Hasslung et al., 2003). Our data of IFN-\u03b1 induction by intact infectious PCV2 or UV-inactivated PCV2 in swine AMs, however, clearly displayed a strong stimulatory activity. The discrepancy may be explained by the observation that the position of the inhibitory sequence in relation to a stimulatory sequence on the same strand of DNA is considered of importance with respect to the net effect of the ODN (Yamada et al., 2002). Further studies are needed to elucidate the mechanisms of IFN-\u03b1 induction by PCV2.",

The surface of macrophages and dendritic cells is known to contain Toll-like receptor 9 and unmethylated CpG ODNs could effectively activate macrophages and dendritic cells after binding with this receptor (Ashkar and Rosenthal, 2002). The DNA of either live or UV-inactivated PCV2 was speculated to continuously stimulate swine AMs to produce IFN-\u03b1 resulting in the situation that the amount of IFN-\u03b1 for reduction in CPE overrode that the anti-rpIFN-\u03b1 antibody for neutralization.",

However, PRRSV is fairly sensitive to the anti-viral effect of IFN-\u03b1 (Buddaert et al., 1998). This may explain the reduction in the infectious rate, cell death, and apoptosis of swine AMs in the PCV2/PRRSV group when compared with the PRRSV-A group. TNF-\u03b1 has been shown to synergize with interferons in the inhibition of viral replication (Wong and Goeddel, 1986). Recombinant porcine TNF-\u03b1 at 100 ng/ml could induce a slight but clear and reproducible inhibition in PRRSV replication in AMs (Lopez-Fuertes et al., 2000); however, the TNF-\u03b1 level in our testing system was lower than 1 ng/ml (Fig. 5). Such low level of TNF-\u03b1 may explain the consistent negative result in the protection assay.",

Crystal violet is used to stain the survival cells; \u00d7115. Complete (A) or almost complete (B) protection from PRRSV-induced CPE is found by adding UV-treated or non-UV-treated supernatant of PCV2-infected AMs collected at 54 HPI, respectively; \u00d7115. No protection from PRRSV-induced CPE is found by adding the AM supernatant pre-mixed with a mouse anti-recombinant porcine IFN-\u03b1 antibody (C); \u00d7115.",
