The epidemic continues to evolve with recent outbreaks occurring among epidemiologically-linked household contacts in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, the United Kingdom, Italy, and Tunisia, and hospital contacts in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, Jordan, the United Kingdom, and France providing evidence for MERS-CoV's potential for person-to-person transmission.17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23\n",

Given the limited time available to develop novel anti-MERS-CoV agents in this evolving epidemic, we attempted to provide an alternative solution by identifying potential broad-spectrum antiviral agents against MERS-CoV and influenza A viruses by a small compound-based forward chemical genetics approach using chemical libraries consisting of 1280 drug compounds already marketed or having reached clinical trials in the United States, Europe, or Asia (Microsource Discovery Systems, USA).25 We then assessed the anti-MERS-CoV activities of the identified drug compounds in cell culture by cytopathic effect (CPE) inhibition, viral yield reduction, and plaque reduction assay (PRA) assays, as well as drug cytotoxicity.",

Some may offer potential therapies in the evolving MERS-CoV epidemic. Influenza A/WSN/1933 (H1N1) virus, instead of MERS-CoV, was used for initial screening because its manipulation did not require a Biosafetly Level III laboratory. Other human betacoronaviruses such as HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-HKU1 were not used because of their slow replication and low viral titres in cell culture.14 Among the 10 identified drug compounds, only mycophenolic acid exhibited an EC50 of <10 \u03bcM, which is a common cut-off value for lead compound detection, and a high selective index of >100. Additionally, we tested other agents reported to have in vitro activities against SARS-CoV and/or MERS-CoV.32, 34, 40 Imukin (interferon-\u03b31b) and the HIV protease inhibitors, nelfinavir mesylate hydrate and lopinavir, showed suboptimal EC50 in the initial CPE inhibition assay and were therefore not further evaluated. Together with mycophenolic acid, four other drug compounds in five preparations, namely ribavirin, Intron A, Avonex, Rebif, and Betaferon, showed in vitro anti-MERS-CoV activity of varying magnitude across four assays.",

In addition to potent immunosuppressive activity, mycophenolic acid also has broad activity in vitro and/or in animal models against different viruses including West Nile,42 Japanese encephalitis,43 yellow fever,44 dengue,45 Chikungunya,46 and possibly hepatitis B viruses.47 Furthermore, it inhibited the in vitro and in vivo replication of hepatitis C virus by augmentation of interferon-stimulated gene expression and depletion of guanosine.48, 49 Combination treatment with interferon-\u03b1 showed additive effects on interferon-stimulated gene expression and enhanced interferon-induced luciferase reporter activity.48 As for coronaviruses, mycophenolic acid was found to be ineffective against SARS-CoV in an animal model, although it did not significantly increase the viral load in the lungs of SARS-infected BALB/c mice as ribavirin did.50 We are unaware of data on its activity against other human coronaviruses.

In the case of SARS-CoV, their antiviral activities in in vitro susceptibility tests had been conflicting.34 None of them were tested systemically in large-scale randomized controlled trials and the results from clinical trials involving their use in SARS were often confounded with the concomitant use of corticosteroids.51, 52 Although their clinical use in MERS-CoV infection has not been described, a recent study found that ribavirin had in vitro anti-MERS-CoV activity at very high concentrations which was potentiated when given together with interferon-\u03b12b.40 Another study showed that MERS-CoV is 50\u2013100 times more sensitive to pegylated interferon-\u03b1 than SARS-CoV in Vero cells, which is possibly related to the lineage-specific genetic differences between the two coronaviruses with MERS-CoV lacking the homolog of the SARS-CoV ORF6 protein responsible for the blockade of interferon-induced nuclear translocation of phosphorylated transcription factor STAT1.53 Furthermore, the delayed and aberrant induction of inflammatory cytokines and chemokines by MERS-CoV might support the use of adjunctive immuno-modulatory treatment combined with antivirals in patients with MERS.54, 55 Among the four preparations of interferons tested, Betaferon exhibited the lowest EC50 of 17.64 IU/ml, which was below the mean peak serum concentration of 40 IU/ml after a subcutaneous dose of 16 million IU or an intravenous dose of 0.2 million to 64 million IU.56 Although the other preparations of interferons also demonstrated in vitro anti-MERS-CoV activities, their EC50 were generally above the peak serum concentrations achievable with usual therapeutic dosing. Combination treatment consisting of mycophenolic acid and Betaferon resulted in a 1.7\u20132.8-fold reduction in the EC50 of mycophenolic acid in Vero cells with 6.25\u201312.5 IU/ml of Betaferon, and 1.1\u20131.8-fold reduction in the EC50 of Betaferon in Vero cells with 0.016\u20130.063 \u03bcg/ml of mycophenolic acid.

            "text": "Compared with ribavirin and interferons, mycophenolic acid exhibits a number of attributes that support its practical use in MERS-CoV infection. It is commonly available in two forms, the prodrug mycophenolate mofetil and the salt mycophenolate sodium, and could be given orally or parenterally. The serum concentration of mycophenolic acid peaks at around 10\u201350 \u03bcg/ml after a 1000 mg oral dose of mycophenolate mofetil or 26.1 \u03bcg/ml after a 720 mg oral dose of mycophenolate sodium. These far exceeds its EC50 of 0.17 \u03bcg/ml and is 60\u2013300 times higher than the concentrations at which the replication of MERS-CoV is inhibited in cell culture and PRA.57 With average plasma elimination half-lives of 17.9 h and 16.6 h after a 1000 mg oral dose and 1500 mg intravenous dose of mycophenolate mofetil respectively,41 the usual regimens consisting of 1000 mg twice daily oral or 1500 mg twice daily intravenous mycophenolate mofetil would be sufficient to achieve levels well above the EC50 throughout the dosing interval. In contrast, the EC50 of ribavirin for MERS-CoV between 9.99 and 41.45 \u03bcg/ml is just marginally effective in some cell lines and greatly exceeds the drug's serum concentration with usual oral doses. Peak concentrations with high intravenous doses may reach approximately 24 \u03bcg/ml in humans, but steady-state requires at least 4 weeks to achieve.40, 58 Furthermore, the use of ribavirin, and hence also its combination with interferon-\u03b12b, may be limited in the clinical setting, because a significant proportion of patients with MERS-CoV infection have developed acute renal failure often requiring renal replacement therapy.2, 24 It has been suggested that systemic ribavirin should best be avoided in patients with a creatinine clearance of <50 ml/min because of the increased risk of haemolytic anaemia.59 Although mycophenolic acid may also be associated with acute renal impairment, the dosage adjustment in such a setting is generally well established.41 The potent in vitro anti-MERS-CoV activity of mycophenolic acid may allow it to be used as a monotherapy if concomitant interferon is not available or tolerated by the patient. Finally, drug level monitoring for mycophenolate mofetil is generally available in most tertiary hospitals which are the usual referral centers for cases of severe MERS-CoV infections requiring intensive care facilities such as extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. However, the risk of immunosuppression at the onset of adaptive immune responses or polarization towards a deleterious Th1 response by mycophenolic acid needs to be considered.60 One possible approach is a short course of mycophenolate mofetil combined with an interferon, particularly interferon-\u03b21b, to provide synergistic antiviral and immune-enhancing effects against MERS-CoV. These options should be considered for study in randomized control clinical trials for this highly fatal disease.",

Vero cells have been described as being comparatively resistant to ribavirin due to their inefficient conversion of the drug into its mono- and tri-phosphate forms.63 However, we decided not to perform the experiment using another cell line as this has been done in another recent report using Vero and LLC-MK2 cell lines which also demonstrated anti-MERS-CoV activity of high ribavirin concentrations similar to our findings.40 It would be important to extend these in vitro studies to human respiratory epithelial cell systems and explants.",

            "text": "To optimize treatment options for MERS-CoV infection, further studies on the anti-MERS-CoV activities of other potential anti-coronavirus agents which have been previously identified for SARS-CoV should be undertaken. Replication of many coronaviruses including SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV requires proteolytic processing of the replicase polyprotein by two viral cysteine proteases, a chymotrypsin-like protease (3CLpro) and a papain-like protease (PLpro). However, the protease inhibitors such as nelfinavir and lopinavir were not found to be active in our in vitro study. Helicase inhibitors are another group of agents with in vitro anti-SARS-CoV activities but their anti-MERS-CoV activities remain undetermined.39, 64 Inhalational nitric oxide was used as rescue therapy for SARS and might be useful for treating MERS-CoV infection if organic nitric oxide donors such as S-nitro-N-acetylpenicillamine also show anti-MERS-CoV activity.65, 66 Antiviral peptides or neutralizing antibodies designed against heptad repeat region 2 of S2 which may inhibit membrane fusion and cell entry of SARS-CoV could theoretically be harnessed for MERS-CoV since the S2 region shared significant homology amongst betacoronaviruses.67, 68, 69, 70 Other agents with in vitro anti-SARS-CoV activities such as glycyrrhizin, baicalin, reserpine, aescin, valinomycin, niclosamide, aurintricarboxylic acid, mizoribine, indomethacin, chloroquine, and experimental agents like small interfering RNA (siRNA) and inhibitors targeting the binding interface between the S1 domian and receptor in vivo, should also be evaluated.34, 35, 71 We did not test these agents in this study because most of them have the problems of either not being commercially available or having therapeutic levels that are not easily achievable clinically. Recently, cyclophilin inhibitors, such as cyclosporine which is available commercially, have also been reported to exhibit anti-MERS-CoV and anti-coronavirus activity in cell culture and viral load studies.53, 72 Further evaluation of its potential therapeutic effects of these commercially available agents with in vitro activity should be conducted in randomized clinical trials as good animal models for MERS are not widely available at this stage.73\n",
