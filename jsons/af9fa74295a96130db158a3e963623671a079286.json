A time-dependent Susceptible, Exposed, Infectious, and Recovered (SEIR) model was proposed and applied to fit and then predict the time series of COVID-19 evolution observed in the last three months (till 3/22/2020) in various provinces and metropolises in China. The model results revealed the space dependent transmission/infection rate and the significant spatiotemporal variation in the recovery rate, likely due to the continuous improvement of screening techniques and public hospital systems, as well as full city lockdowns in China. The validated SEIR model was then applied to predict COVID-19 evolution in United States, Italy, Japan, and South Korea which have responded differently to monitoring and mitigating COVID-19 so far, although these predictions contain high uncertainty due to the intrinsic change of the maximum infected population and the infection/recovery rates within the different countries. In addition, a stochastic model based on the random walk particle tracking scheme, analogous to a mixing-limited bimolecular reaction model, was developed to evaluate non-pharmaceutical strategies to mitigate COVID-19 spread. Preliminary tests using the stochastic model showed that self-quarantine may not be as efficient as strict social distancing in slowing COVID-19 spread, if not all of the infected people can be promptly diagnosed and quarantined.",

The COVID-19 pandemic is infiltrating almost every aspect of life, damaging global economy and altering both man-made and natural environments. Urgent actions have been taken but further effective and efficient strategies are promptly needed to confront this global challenge. To address this challenge and promptly guide the next efforts, it is critical to model the transmission, infection, and recovery dynamics of COVID-19 pandemic. Mathematical models are among the necessary tools to quantify the COVID-19 dynamics and are the primary objective motivating this study.",

Efficient strategies are therefore needed to mitigate the 4 COVID-19 outbreak.

The SEIR model was also applied by Li et al. [7] (using the observed data up to 2/6/2020) to compare the effect of city lockdowns on the transmission dynamics in different cities in China. The SIR model with time-dependent transmission and recovering rates was used by Chen et al. [8] (using data up to 2/20/2020) to analyze and predict the number of confirmed cases of COVID-19 in China. The SIR model was extended by Wang et al. [9] (using data up to 2/12/2020) to incorporate various time-varying quarantine protocols for assessing 5 interventions on the COVID-19 epidemic in China. The SEIR model and its modifications were also successfully applied by others [10] [11] [12] [13] , mostly for assessing the early spreading of in China. Previous applications of the popular SEIR model, however, may contain high uncertainty since they had limited data access for only a short period of the COVID-19 outbreak.",

Therefore, the condition of A being infected is not deterministic but rather a random, probability-controlled process. This probability is related to various factors, such as the duration that A and B are in contact, the infectivity rate, and the distance between the two people, which may be characterized parsimoniously by the interaction radius R that controls the number of reactant pairs (susceptible + infectious) in a potential reaction (infection) [23] .

However, the value for this peak (scenario 1, =198 people) is lower than that for scenario 3 (=267 people), although the total number of the infected people for scenario 1 (9,336) is slightly larger than scenario 3 (9,322). This may be due to a greater separation of infection cases for the higher number of initial coronavirus carriers in scenario 1, which causes a lower and relatively flatter COVID-19 evolution peak than scenario 3. Scenario 2 has the lowest peak value (=121 people) and the most-delayed peak in the curve of new cases, and the total infection time is almost doubled compared to the other two 17 scenarios, indicating that people living with strict social distancing may also suffer from a much longer period of COVID-19 threat.

On February 27, 2020, the number of Wenzhou's infected people suddenly declined, combined with the sudden increase of the number of people cured. This abrupt change can be efficiently captured by the SEIR model (2) with an impulse in the recovery rate ( ). This impulse is most likely due to the new hospital, the No. 2 Affiliated Hospital of Wenzhou Medical University, built in this city in early February, which significantly improved the public health system.

Second, the model results showed that, if the infection and recovery rates remain stable, then the number of cumulative infections is likely to decline to 1% of the total infected populationwithin one month (from 3/22/2020) in China. The overseas imported cases, however, may break the internal asymptotic status and significantly postpone the ending time of COVID-19 in China. Third, predictions using the validated SEIR model showed different evolution dynamics of COVID-19 within populations of the United States, Italy, Japan, and South Korea. For example, it may take at least 1~3 months for the current infected population to drop below 1% of the cumulative infected population in the U.S. (requiring more efficient mitigation strategies), while South Korea may control the COVID-19 spread in less than 35 days from 3/22/20. However, these predictions contain high uncertainty due to uncertainty in the maximum infected population, and changes of transmission/infection and recovery rates among different countries.Fourth, a stochastic model based on the Lagrangian scheme, analogous to a mixing-limited reaction mechanism model, showed that self-quarantine may not be as effective as strict social distancing, since not all the infected people can be diagnosed and immediately quarantined. While strict social distancing can apparently slow COVID-19 spread, the pandemic may last longer. Best-fit parameters of the SEIR model(2) for Hubei province and three cities in China.
