            "text": "Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) is the causative agent of an emerging human infectious disease, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) (Drosten et al., 2003, Ksiazek et al., 2003, Peiris et al., 2003b, Rota et al., 2003) and is related to the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS-CoV). Infections from either virus are associated with high morbidity and mortality. Due to its high morbidity and mortality, SARS has evolved as an important global respiratory disease. Even in a situation of no new infections, SARS remains a potential major health hazard, as re-emerging epidemics may arise. The serious consequences posed by virulent emerging pathogens such as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV to which our populations have little or no immunity was highlighted by SARS outbreak in 2002\u20132003. The principal containment strategy to date has emphasized rapid diagnosis and isolation of infected patients and to some extent contacts with those patients. However, in spite of enormous effects and funds expended, no agents have been approved for treating SARS-CoV or MERS-CoV.",

Thus, numerous types of agents have been tested against SARS-CoV both in vitro and in vivo (Barnard and Kumaki, 2009). Notably, it has been shown that antibodies to the SARS-CoV spike protein block entry of the virus into cells (Sui et al., 2004) and small peptides derived from the heptad repeat (HR) regions of SARS-CoV S protein have been shown to inhibit SARS-CoV infection by interfering with SARS-CoV fusion to target cells (Bosch et al., 2004, Ho et al., 2006). Additionally, the main protease of SARS-CoV, which is essential for the replication cycle of SARS-CoV, has been a key target for developing anti-SARS-CoV drugs (Anand et al., 2003, Barnard and Kumaki, 2009, Yang et al., 2003). Another approach that was explored for treating SARS-CoV infections was to evaluate RNA species as therapies. Thus, antisense ribonucleic acid (RNA) and RNA interference (RNAi) technologies have shown potential in treating some severe diseases including SARS-CoV infection (Ahlquist, 2002, Gibson, 1994, Johnson-Saliba and Jans, 2001, Leonard and Schaffer, 2006). Using siRNAs to inhibit SARS-CoV infection in Rhesus macaques, it was demonstrated that siRNAs were effective both prophylactically and therapeutically (Chang et al., 2007). Another approach has been the use of drug combination. The combination of ribavirin and corticosteroids was the most frequently administered antiviral therapy used during the SARS outbreak (Booth et al., 2003, Ho et al., 2003, Peiris et al., 2003a, Tsang et al., 2003, Tsui et al., 2003). However, ribavirin alone at nontoxic concentrations was found to have little in vitro activity against SARS-CoV (Cinatl et al., 2003), although an improved clinical outcome was reported among SARS patients receiving early administration of Kaletra plus ribavirin and corticosteroids (Tsang and Seto, 2004). In several mouse models and in vitro, ribavirin was even found to enhance the SARS-CoV infection (Barnard et al., 2006a, Barnard et al., 2006b, Day et al., 2009). More recent data demonstrated that Urtica dioica agglutinin (UDA) treatment of SARS-CoV-infected mice lead to a substantial therapeutic effect that protected mice against death and weight loss that result from the infection (Kumaki et al., 2011b).",

In earlier studies, we evaluated a few compounds approved for therapeutic use in humans and some in vitro inhibitors of SARS-CoV for inhibition in the mouse SARS-CoV replication model (Barnard et al., 2006a). A hybrid interferon, interferon alpha (IFN-\u03b1) B/D, and a mismatched double-stranded (ds) RNA interferon inducer, Ampligen (poly I:poly C124), were shown to potently inhibit virus titers in the lungs of infected mice (Barnard et al., 2006a). To evaluate the prophylactic potential of antivirals directed against SARS-CoV infection, new lethal animal models for SARS are needed to facilitate antiviral research. We adapted and characterized a new strain of SARS-CoV (strain v2163) that was highly lethal in 5- to 6-week-old BALB/c mice (Day et al., 2009). A number of compounds were tested for the efficacy in SARS-CoV-infected BALB/c mice (Day et al., 2009). The use of adenovirus vectored mouse interferon-alpha (mDEF201) as a prophylactic treatment and a therapeutic countermeasure for treating lethal SARS-CoV infection in BALB/c mice was very efficacious in protecting mice against death (Kumaki et al., 2011a). In other studies, treatment with an interferon inducer, polyriboinosinic-polyribocytidylic acid stabilized with poly-L-lysine and carboxymethyl cellulose (poly IC:LC), given by the intranasal route, was effective in protecting mice against a lethal infection with mouse-adapted SARS-CoV and reduced viral lung titers (Kumaki et al., 2010). The active immunomodulator, poly IC:LC (Hiltonol\u00ae), was effective when therapy was initiated 24 h before infection or as late as 8 h after virus inoculation, at a time when clinical signs of SARS were being manifested in the BALB/c mice. In this report, we further evaluated the use of Hiltonol\u00ae as an extended prophylactic or therapeutic countermeasure for treating lethal SARS-CoV infection in BALB/c mice caused by a mouse-adapted SARS-CoV. In addition, its value as a vaccine adjuvant was assessed.",

Did this apparent moderation of the inflammatory response both in the lungs and on the surface of the lungs due correlate with a reduction of virus replication in the lungs of infected mice, the presence of virus protein the likely culprit for inducing edema? In general, virus lung titers at day 3 after inoculation with virus were almost 0.5 log10 lower or more in mice treated with 2.5 mg/kg Hiltonol\u00ae compared to the placebo-treated control (Table 3). However, only the virus lungs titers of mice treated with 2.5 mg/kg Hiltonol\u00ae 14 days before infection were significantly reduced compared to the virus titers of mice receiving PSS. They were reduced by almost one log10 compared to the placebo treated mice (Table 3). None of the other treatments, including Ampligen\u00ae, achieved such a reduction in virus lung titer.",

The effects of Hiltonol\u00ae treatment on immune responsiveness were also investigated by analyzing the neutralizing antibody levels to the virus 7 and 14 days after virus challenge. Sera from all groups of mice used in the long term prophylaxis experiment were analyzed for neutralizing antibody (Fig. 2\nA and B). The data suggest that the mice treated with the high dose of Hiltonol\u00ae could still mount a robust virus neutralization response, even though the drug did significantly reduce virus lung titers in only one case. In fact, mice receiving pretreatment with Hiltonol\u00ae beginning at day 21 and day 14 before virus challenge had significant higher neutralizing antibody titers than did the corresponding placebo-treated mice (Fig. 2A; p < 0.001, p < 0.0001; respectively). The neutralizing antibody titers remained equivalently high or higher at day 14 post virus challenge (Fig. 2B). Interestingly, the group of mice receiving the lowest dose of Hiltonol\u00ae appeared to have the higher neutralizing antibody titers at day 14 than at day 7. One could speculate that this observation was driven by the fact that virus titers were higher in these mice. Treatment of mice with low dose Hiltonol\u00ae and Ampligen\u00ae also showed similar results. This would suggest that this dose of Hiltonol\u00ae did not adversely affect the adaptive immune response.",

Survival and weights were monitored daily for at least 14 days. Hiltonol\u00ae given at 5 mg/kg/day resulted in 90% survival of treated, infected mice when administered 8 h post virus challenge, at a time when clinical signs of SARS are starting to be manifested in the untreated BALB/c mice (p < 0.001, Table 4\n).

These data suggest that Hiltonol\u00ae treatment of SARS-CoV infection in mice leads to substantial therapeutic effect that protects mice against death only when administered within 8 h after virus exposure or when using a therapeutic multiple dosing regimen. Hiltonol\u00ae given one time at 5 mg/kg/day was not protective against death when treatment was at 32, 48 or 72 h after SARS-CoV infection (Table 4).

In another subsequent therapeutic experiment, Hiltonol\u00ae was administered intranasally 16 and 24 h post virus exposure. At day 6, 60% of mice receiving Hiltonol\u00ae 16 and 24 h after exposure to virus were still alive compared with the other therapeutic regimens in which all were dead or only one mouse had survived (data not shown). This data suggest that treatment beginning 16 h after virus exposure might temporarily prolong survival, but that the pathogenesis caused by the virus finally overwhelms the mice.",

            "text": "Interleukin 6 (IL-6) is a multifunctional cytokine that regulates the immune response, hematopoiesis, the acute phase response, and inflammation (Hirano, 1998). We have previously reported that IL-6 levels were increased in SARS-CoV-infected mice, and high IL-6 expression was associated with mortality (Day et al., 2009). Therefore, we evaluated the effects of virus infection in mice deficient in IL-6 (B6.129S2-IL6tmlKopf/J). Since these IL-6 mutant mice show defects in responses to various viruses and in inflammatory responses to infection, we hypothesized that mortality and disease parameters might be reduced in IL-6 -/- mice infected with SARS-CoV because increased IL-6 levels contributed greatly to the lethality of the infection in normal mice (Day et al., 2009). This hypothesis assumed that IL-6 production was a major source of lung disease in SARS-CoV-infected mice. When both SARS-CoV-infected mice (C57BL/6J, IL-6 +/+ and B6.129S2-IL6tm1Kopf/J, IL-6 -/-) were treated with Hiltonol\u00ae at 1.0 mg/kg/day, the typical depression of weight gain by Hiltonol\u00ae treatment was observed at days 3\u20134, although it was significantly more severe in the B6.129S2-IL6tm1Kopf/J mice (IL-6 -/-) (data not shown). However, the surviving mice gained back the lost weight by the end of the experiment. Hiltonol\u00ae did not significantly protect mice from death in either strain of mouse compared to the placebo-treated mice of both strains (Table 5\n) and IL-6 -/- mice still supported virus lung replication. In addition, the mean day of death was the same for all groups. However, the virus lung titers in these mice were significantly reduced at day 3 post virus exposure (Table 6\n, p < 0.001). All IL-6 -/- mice had significantly highly virus titers than did the normal C57BL/6J mice (Table 6, p < 0.001), suggesting that IL-6 was necessary to control virus replication in the lungs. Interestingly, at day 6, Hiltonol\u00ae-treated IL-6 -/- mice had significantly increased virus lung titers compared to untreated, infected IL-6 +/+ mice (Table 6, p < 0.001). In addition, the virus infection of the lungs likely induced a significant yet slight inflammatory response in untreated, infected IL-6 -/- mice (p < 0.05), as measured by the increase in lung score but there was no induction of edema in these mice as can be seen by the normal lung weights (Table 6). The inability to significantly control virus replication may be one of reasons why IL-6 -/- mice were not protected against death. Thus, virus cytopathic effects may have sufficiently destroyed enough lung cells to contribute to poor lung function that may have lead to death for mice that succumbed because of the virus infection. Our data suggest that these mice (57BL/6J mice, B6.129S2-Il6tm1Kopf/J mice, IL-6 -/-) lack a pathway with which Hiltonol\u00ae interacts to prevent lethal SARS-CoV infection in mice.",

In the current study, we hypothesized that intranasal infection of TLR4 -/- mice with mouse-adapted SARS-CoV would result in an acute respiratory disease with a higher lethality. When both strains (C57BL/6J and C57BL/6J/10ScNJ TLR-4 -/- mice) were infected with SARS-CoV and treated with Hiltonol\u00ae, infected, untreated C57BL/6J mice lost weight, but onset of weight loss was delayed relative to Hiltonol\u00ae-treated, infected mice (data not shown). An exception was the one C57BL/6J/10ScNJ TLR-4 -/- mouse that died at day 5 post virus exposure. Despite not inducing death of these strains of mice, the virus was able to replicate quite rigorously in the lungs of C57BL/6J mice (Table 7\n) as previously seen in other mice (Table 6). Yet the virus induced no significant inflammatory response, as manifested by lack of increased lung scores and lack of induction of edema manifested as normal lung weights (Table 7). Nevertheless, virus lung titers were dramatically reduced in both strains of mice treated with Hiltonol\u00ae (p < 0.001), but more so in the C57BL/6J/10ScNJ TLR-4 -/- mice, especially at day 6. In addition, the C57BL/6J/10ScNJ mice were less suitable hosts for prolonged lung virus replication than the C57BL/6J mice, because virus lung titers at day 6 in C57BL/6J/10ScNJ TLR-4 -/- mice were significantly lower than in C57BL/6J mice (p < 0.01). These data indicated that Hiltonol\u00ae action appeared to be independent of the TLR-4 locus.",

            "text": "The host innate immune response against viral insult includes the production of interferon type I (IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2), which is initiated to limit viral replication. The virus-infected cells usually cause the activation of several transcription factors, such as interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF-3), which play a central role in downstream gene activation (Lin et al., 1998). Once interferon is synthesized and secreted from the cells, it binds to cell surface receptors and induces transcription, which results in an anti-viral state in the target cells. Epithelial cells secrete interferon-\u03b2 as an initial response to viral infection (Marie et al., 1998). Dendritic cells are able to produce INF-\u03b1 subtypes (Diebold et al., 2003). However, the production of interferon type I by SARS-CoV-infected cells is limited (Chen and Subbarao, 2007, Spiegel et al., 2005) and neither endogenous interferon transcripts nor interferon promoter activity are detected (Spiegel et al., 2005). This lack of interferon activity has been attributed to proteins, which antagonize interferon and block transcription factors necessary for the expression of interferon (Kopecky-Bromberg et al., 2007). Although SARS-CoV antagonizes the production and effect of endogenous interferon, it remains susceptible to exogenous interferons (Chen and Subbarao, 2007, Kumaki et al., 2011a).",

            "text": "Interferon induction occurs mainly by an intracellular pathway: double-stranded (ds) RNA and 5\u2019-triphosphorylated single-stranded (ss) RNA trigger a signaling chain, which activates interferon-\u03b2 gene expression (Hornung et al., 2006, Pichlmair et al., 2006, Weber et al., 2006). Retinoic-acid-inducible gene I (RIG-I) and melanoma-differentiation-associated gene 5 (MDA-5) are the main intracellular receptors of viral RNA (Andrejeva et al., 2004, Kato et al., 2006, Yoneyama et al., 2004). The binding of a viral RNA to RIG-I and MDA-5 induces a signaling chain which results in the phosphorylation of the transcription factor IRF-3 (Fitzgerald et al., 2003, Sharma et al., 2003). 2\u2032,5\u2019-oligoadenylate synthetases (2\u2032,5\u2032-OAS) (Silverman, 1994) and the protein kinase R (PKR) (Williams, 1999) have also been characterized in detail. 2\u2032,5\u2032-OAS catalyses the synthesis of short 2\u2032-5\u2032 oligoadenylates that activate the latent endoribonuclease (Silverman, 1994). PKR is a serine-threonine kinase that phosphorylates the alpha subunit of the eukaryotic translation initiation factor eIF2 (Williams, 1999). In addition, interferon induction also does occur by an endosomal pathway in selected cells. Myeloid dendritic cells (mDCs) (Diebold et al., 2003) and plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs) (Colonna et al., 2002) are the main interferon producers of the lymphatic system. Myeloid dendritic cells (mDCs) can sence dsRNA by the classic intracellular pathway (Diebold et al., 2003) and, the endosomal toll-like receptor (TLR) (Alexopoulou et al., 2001). TLR-7/8 and TLR-3 recognize viral ssRNA and dsRNA, respectively, and activate interferon-\u03b1/\u03b2 transcription via the transcription factors IRF-7, IRF-3, and NF-\u03baB.",

            "text": "The pathogenesis of severe acute respiratory syndrome has not yet been fully characterized. One hypothesis is that the pathogenesis of SARS-CoV is caused by a disproportionate immune response, illustrated by elevated levels of inflammatory cytokines and chemokines, such as interferon gamma inducible protein 10 (IP-10), monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1), interleukin 6 (IL-6) and interleukin 8 (IL-8) (Jiang et al., 2005, Wong et al., 2004). Chemokines are involved in the recruitment of leukocytes into sites of tissue inflammation (Sauty et al., 1999). SARS-CoV has been shown in vitro to induce changes of cytokines and chemokines in various human and animal cells (Spiegel and Weber, 2006, Yen et al., 2006). IL-6 is a monomor of 184 amino acids secreted by T-cells, macrophages and endothelial cells to stimulate immune response during the infection (Ray et al., 1989, Sehgal et al., 1988, Sehgal et al., 1995). Xiao et al. speculated that dampening of the proinflammatory cytokine response in SARS-CoV infection, in particular the production of IL-6, could have a clinically beneficial effect (Xiao et al., 2008). We noticed that SARS-CoV infection increased IL-6 in mice, and high IL-6 expression corrected with mortality (Day et al., 2009). Levels of IL-6 dropped when BALB/c mice were treated with ribavirin, UDA (5 mg/kg/day), Ampligen\u00ae or Hiltonol\u00ae (1 mg/kg/day) (Day et al., 2009, Kumaki et al., 2011b). IP-10 and other cytokines are released from both the apical and basolateral sides, while IL-6 is secreted through the apical surface (Yoshikawa et al., 2009). It can be speculated that IP-10 in SARS patients might directly be produced by virus-infected cells, whereas upregulation of IL-6 is likely a secondary response due to the activation of the immune system. In addition, the TRIF pathway leads to the production of type I interferons via interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF-3) and also cause delayed NF-\u03baB activation via activation of TNF receptor-associated factor 6 (TRAF6) (Hoebe et al., 2003, Sato et al., 2003). Imai et al. also showed that TRIF-dependent lung injury is likely to be mediated by production of interleukin 6 (IL-6), as IL-6-deficient mice were protected from injury (Imai et al., 2008).",

            "text": "Toll-like receptors (TLRs), a family of evolutionarily conserved pathogen recognition receptors, are a class of proteins that play a key role in the innate immune system. The TLR family consists of 13 mammalian members. Viral protein binds to TLR-2 and TLR-4. The single stranded RNA binds to TLR-7 and TLR-8. The double stranded RNA binds to TLR-3 while viral DNA binds to TLR-9. TLR-3, TLR-7, TLR-8, and TLR-9 recognize viral nucleic acids on endosomal membrane. The binding of ligands to TLRs might trigger downstream signaling pathways that are involved in both the cytokine release during the primary induction of inflammation and secondary activation of anti-inflammatory mechanism (Netea et al., 2004). Each TLR has its own intrinsic signaling pathway and induces specific biological responses against microorganisms, such as dendritic cell maturation, cytokine production, and the development of adaptive immunity (Akira et al., 2006, Murawski et al., 2009). TLR-4 recognizes the viral proteins, such as the fusion (F) protein from respiratory syncytial virus and the envelope protein of mouse mammary tumor virus (Uematsu and Akira, 2007). TLR-4-mutated C3H/HeJ mice are sensitive to respiratory syncytial virus infection (Murawski et al., 2009). TLR-4 triggers the induction of proinflammatory cytokines by myeloid differentiation primary response gene 88 (MyD88) pathway, and TLR-4 also interacts with TIR-domain-containing adapter-inducing interferon-\u03b2 (TRIF)-mediated signaling pathways (Yamamoto et al., 2003) that are involved in interferon induction (Uematsu and Akira, 2007).",

Hiltonol\u00ae (Poly IC:LC, or polyinosinic-polycytidylic acid stabilized with polylysine and carboxymethylcellulose) is a chemically stabilized active double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) therapeutic that activates host innate and adaptive immunity by various pathways/mechanisms leading to induction of the immediate antiviral state. The immediate antiviral state is characterized by induction of a \u2018natural mix\u2019 of interferons, cytokines, and chemokines; activation of dsRNA-dependent host defense systems such as RIG-I, MDA-5, 2\u2032,5\u2032-OAS, PKR, stimulation of mDCs, of natural killer (NK) cells and others via toll-like receptors. Toll-like receptors are also implicated in lung airway injury as well as leading to beneficial responses to antigen insult. Imai et al. demonstrated that acute lung injury (ALI) is triggered by the signaling of oxidative stress through Toll-like receptor 4 (Imai et al., 2008). Khanolkar et al. reported that C3H/HeJ mice harboring a natural mutation in the gene that encodes Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) that disrupts its normal function exhibited the enhanced morbidity and mortality following i.n. mouse hepatitis virus strain 1 (MHV-1) infection, indicating that TLR-4 plays an important role in respiratory CoV pathogenesis (Khanolkar et al., 2009). In this study, we hypothesized whether intranasal infection of TLR-4 -/- mice with mouse-adapted SARS-CoV would result in an acute respiratory disease with a higher lethality. However, the data presented is not consistent with this hypothesis.",

            "text": "Toll-like receptor (TLR-3) is a member of the Toll-like receptor family of pattern recognition receptors of the innate immune system (Rock et al., 1998). TLR-3 is expressed on respiratory epithelium as well as on mDCs, especially in response to respiratory infections such as influenza. Using TLR-3-deficient mice, Gowen et al. indicate that TLR-3 plays an important role in Punta Toro virus (PTV) infection (Gowen et al., 2006). Ichinohe et al. have also demonstrated an even earlier activation of lung TLR-3 in response to nasal Hiltonol\u00ae or poly-IC in mice (Ichinohe et al., 2005). While these host defense mechanisms are typically activated by presentation of \u2018foreign\u2019 dsRNA species generated by viral replication, many of them are also frequently the target of inhibition by many neoplasms and viruses, including influenza virus and SARS-CoV. Treatment with mucosally applied Hiltonol\u00ae may preempt or reverse some of those viral evasive mechanisms. The apparent modulation by Hiltonol\u00ae of the usual relationship between host survival and replication of SARS-CoV, as manifested by clinical protection of animals in spite of some evidence of viral replication, is also of much interest. For example, complete inhibition of viral replication might be counterproductive to the generation of longer term adaptive immunity. Thus, while some of the dsRNA dependent antiviral/antiproliferative pathways mentioned above may help control replication, the potential activation of mDCs via TLR-3 Hiltonol\u00ae\u2019s can be seen as improving the efficiency of antigen presentation and may be particularly suited to generation of a Th1 cellular antiviral immunity. In fact, the TLRs have been proposed as a \u2018bridge\u2019 between innate and adaptive immunity. It remains to be further determined whether TLR-3 is involved in SARS-CoV infection in mice.",

Initial high-dose studies were quasi-empirical and driven by its induction of interferon, yet only recently have its effectiveness at lower doses and broad mechanisms of action begun to be more fully elucidated. There is an extensive early, empirical experience on the broad in vivo antiviral actions of Hiltonol\u00ae, yet these actions have not been fully exploited in the context of prophylaxis of emerging infections, pandemic containment and biodefense. Mucosal (intranasal) Hiltonol\u00ae provides rapid and complete protection from respiratory viruses such as influenza virus, SARS-CoV, and RSV (Guerrero-Plata et al., 2005, Kumaki et al., 2010, Wong et al., 1995, Wong et al., 1999). Wong et al. has demonstrated 80\u2013100% protection lasting up to 3 weeks provided by intranasal aqueous or liposomal Hiltonol\u00ae in otherwise lethal murine challenge models of influenza A and avian (H5N1) influenza viruses. Hiltonol\u00ae has been shown to have efficacy against yellow fever (Stephen et al., 1977), simian hemorrhagic fever (Levy et al., 1976), Japanese encephalitis (Harrington et al., 1977), rabies (Baer et al., 1977) and Rift Valley fever (Kende et al., 1987). The antiviral activity of Hiltonol\u00ae is believed to be mediated by its ability to augment the production of interferon-\u03b1, -\u03b2 and -\u03b3 (Levy et al., 1975). Hiltonol\u00ae also activates natural killer cells and macrophages. The antiviral efficacy of Hiltonol\u00ae was previously evaluated against avian influenza virus and Hiltonol\u00ae appeared to provide effective and broad-spectrum prophylaxis against avian influenza virus (Wong et al., 2007). For our in vivo studies, we recommend to administer the safe dose of Hiltonol\u00ae at 2.5 mg/kg/day. In a pilot trial, Salazar et al. reported that low dose Hiltonol\u00ae (about 10\u201350 mcg/kg) was given intramuscularly two to three times weekly for up to 56 months to 38 malignant brain tumor patients (Salazar et al., 1996). Patients tolerated the regimen well, with little or no toxicity and a preserved quality of life. We conclude that the concept of long-term, broad spectrum stimulation of host defenses with non-toxic, inexpensive double-stranded ribonucleic acids, such as Hiltonol\u00ae at 50 mcg/kg, might be applicable to the treatment of virus infections.",

Host-targeted therapeutics such as Hiltonol\u00ae that activate innate immunity and provide immediate broad spectrum resistance could fill the early gap in protection by allowing time for more specific vaccination strategies to take effect, and could thus become an important element of the rapid response to a bioterror attack or pandemic outbreak. Hiltonol\u00ae represents a relatively new host-directed paradigm in therapeutics that seeks to activate non-specific and specific host defense systems that have been highly evolved over millions of years. Hiltonol\u00ae also has the potential to be used prophylactically in those who have been potentially exposed to the SARS-CoV, but not yet showing symptoms, thus enabling clinicians to \u201cring\u201d and isolate the focus case with individuals prophylactically treated and unlikely get severe disease or unlikely not get disease at all. The demonstrated clinical safety of Hiltonol\u00ae's, its immediate induction of an innate immune persistent broad spectrum antiviral state, its relatively low cost, its stability in storage and relative ease of use make it a potentially very valuable agent for containment of epidemics caused by respiratory pathogens. Because Hiltonol\u00ae has broad spectrum antiviral activity, it also represents a potential therapy for MERS-CoV infection as well, since MERS-CoV is a related coronavirus causing severe respiratory infections as dose SARS-CoV.",
