Steinberg and colleagues developed the sterile model of zymosan (the cell wall of the fungus saccharomyces A) plus mineral oil injected intraperitoneally to induce MODS in rodents [8]. This model results in initial hypovolemic shock followed by persistent macrophage activation. Injection of either zymosan or mineral oil alone does not induce MODS, suggesting the need for a \u201ctwo-hit\u201d insult of both toll-like receptor (TLR) stimulation by zymosan and unremitting particulate irritation by mineral oil to induce persistent macrophage activation. In another rodent model, Behrens and colleagues reported that repeated (i.e., not single time) TLR9 stimulation with CpG oligodeoxynucleotides transformed an otherwise innocuous endotoxin challenge (TLR4 stimulation) in mice into a MODS model of macrophage activation with cytopenias, splenomegaly, hyperferritinemia, and hepatitis [9]. Similarly, in another murine model of cecal ligation and perforation-induced sepsis, additional CpG injection induced cytokine production by macrophages and hepatic mononuclear cells, followed by the development of liver injury and MODS-induced mortality [10]. Importantly, the sHLH phenotype elicited with repeated TLR9 stimulation is exacerbated in knockout mice deficient in native hepatic IL-1 receptor antagonist protein production but can be ameliorated by interferon-\u03b1-induced production of IL-1 receptor antagonist protein or with direct administration of recombinant IL-1 receptor antagonist protein (anakinra) in vivo [11]. In short, liver dysfunction in this model appears to be related in part to IL-1-mediated inflammation [12].",

The NK cell, as the most important \u201ccellular\u201d controller of macrophage and T lymphocyte activation, is considered central to the pathobiology of these conditions. Uncontrolled inflammation can be due in part to ineffective NK cell cytolytic function. Defects or deficiencies in the ability of the NK cell to kill viruses and cancer cells and to turn off the host reticuloendothelial system, macrophage, dendritic cell, and lymphocyte activation can be related to one of the three pathologic conditions: (1) absent NK cell cytolytic activity unrelated to numbers of NK cells present (familial HLH), (2) reduced NK cell cytolytic activity unrelated to numbers of NK cells present (sHLH/MAS associated with rheumatologic disease), and (3) normal NK cell cytolytic activity per cell but NK cell cytopenia (sepsis-induced hyperferritinemic MODS).

Gene knockout models for this pathway result in murine HLH and death after infection with otherwise innocuous LCM (lymphocytic choriomeningitis) virus infection. In the wild-type mouse exposed to LCM virus infection, host NK and T cells respond to control the virus, whereas in the perforin knockout mouse, LCM virus infection cannot be killed leading to T-cell proliferation and activation and consequent overproduction of interferon-\u03b3 (reflected by very high levels of CXCL9, the monokine induced by interferon-\u03b3). T lymphocyte-derived interferon-\u03b3 induces macrophage activation and organ injury. Etoposide, one of the traditional treatments for familial HLH, destroys proliferating activated T cells and reduces interferon-\u03b3 production, preventing undue macrophage activation.",

For instance, some patients with systemic juvenile idiopathic arthritis (sJIA), a known trigger for sHLH, are hypomorphic or heterozygotes for the perforin-granzyme pathway gene variants. As heterozygotes, these patients have some NK cytolytic activity. For the most part, these patients respond nicely to anti-inflammatory therapies such as anakinra (IL-1 receptor antagonist protein). The IL-1 receptor antagonist protein anakinra is FDA approved for inflammasome-driven conditions (e.g., sJIA). IL-18, the interferon-\u03b3-inducible factor, is also increased in these patients. There is optimism that IL-18-binding protein (which neutralizes IL-18) as well as interferon-\u03b3 monoclonal antibody could help these patients.",

            "text": "Reduced number of NK cells with normal NK cytolytic activity per cell is the basis of hyperferritinemic sepsis-induced MODS. When NK cell numbers recover, then inflammation and MODS resolve. During bacterial infection, NK cells switch from an overall low cytokine-producing, high cytolytic activity phenotype to a high cytokine-producing, low cytolytic activity phenotype [13]. In hyperferritinemic sepsis-induced MODS, NK cell cytopenia and T-cell cytopenia occur with reticuloendothelial system activation but decreased to absent interferon-\u03b3 production. When the reduction in NK cell and T-cell numbers is below 10% of normal, there is a significant decrease in host ability to kill viruses and cancer cells as well as to induce apoptosis in activated macrophages. Because T cells and interferon-gamma production are already low to absent, etoposide is unlikely to be of benefit in reducing macrophage activation in these children. Indeed, etoposide may worsen outcomes in sepsis patients by preventing the recovery of lymphocyte counts needed to resolve infection. Compared to patients with other forms of HLH, those with hyperferritinemic sepsis-induced MODS have lower production of interferon-\u03b3-inducing IL-18. The promise of interferon-\u03b3 monoclonal antibodies in treating familial HLH and MAS is therefore less likely to be realized in hyperferritinemic sepsis-induced MODS. Further, inability to produce interferon-\u03b3 is associated with increased mortality in experimental models of sepsis.",

These pathways are depicted in Fig. 14.3 [14]. Endotheliopathy in sepsis leads to hemolysis, particularly in patients with gene variants related to atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS) and low to absent inhibitory complement production. The released free hemoglobin complexes with haptoglobin and binds to the macrophage CD163 receptor, which is internalized, leading to the production and release of extracellular ferritin. Extracellular ferritin activates liver stellate cells causing pro-inflammatory cytokine-mediated liver injury. Ferritin also increases toll-like receptor (TLR) expression including TLR9 on innate immune cells while inhibiting the adaptive immune response by preventing lymphopoiesis. DNA viremia, enabled in part by lymphopenia-induced viral reactivation, complexes with the macrophage TLR9 receptor resulting in inflammasome activation and production of IL-1, IL-18, and more extracellular ferritin. This cascade results in a feed-forward positive feedback inflammation loop with more liver injury, innate immune cell inflammation, and adaptive immune cell depression [14]. Plasma exchange can be used in these patients to remove free hemoglobin and extracellular ferritin as well as to replace inhibitory complement. Intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg) can also be given to neutralize DNA viremia and to block further TLR9 stimulation. Interestingly, IL-1 receptor antagonist protein is effective in reversing both ferritin and TLR9-induced liver injury while inducing a delayed type 1 interferon response to combat DNA viremia.\n",

Specifically, they suggested that the combination of hepatobiliary dysfunction and disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) can be representative of sHLH including hyperferritinemic sepsis-induced MODS. Further, they hypothesized that if the combination of these two organ dysfunctions represents sHLH, then treatment with IL-1 receptor blockade should improve sepsis-related macrophage activation as it does in the previously mentioned experimental model [10] and in children with sJIA-related MAS [15\u201317]. In their secondary analysis of an adult with severe sepsis IL-1 receptor blockade trial, Shakoory and colleagues compared patients with combined hepatobiliary dysfunction (HBD) and DIC (HBD + DIC) to those without this combination (non-HBD + DIC) [17]. The investigators found the following: (1) 5.6% of severe sepsis patients had HBD + DIC; (2) patients with HBD + DIC had a higher incidence of shock (HBD + DIC = 95% versus non-HBD + DIC = 79%) and acute kidney injury (HBD + DIC = 61% versus non-HBD + DIC = 29%), but not acute respiratory distress syndrome (HBD + DIC = 21% versus non-HBD + DIC = 26%); and (3) IL-1 receptor blockade significantly increased 28-day survival in patients with HBS + DIC (IL-1 blockade = 65.4% versus placebo = 35%), while 28-day survival in non-HBD + DIC did not change (IL-1 blockade = 71% vs placebo = 71%). It can be, therefore, extrapolated that sHLH diagnosed by the presence of HBD and DIC constitutes a small but significant subset among severe sepsis patients; death attributable to superimposed sHLH can be remedied in some patients with adjunctive therapy with IL-1 receptor blockade.",

Of note, history of consanguineous parenting or family history of children dying from fever, especially in a patient presenting less than 2 years of age with significant CNS pathology, should raise suspicion for familial HLH.

If ferritin is greater than 500 ng/dL and other signs or symptoms of sHLH are present, especially DIC or hepatobiliary dysfunction, the diagnosis of hyperferritinemic sepsis-induced MODS should be made. We also recommend monitoring systemic inflammation associated with macrophage activation at the bedside by measuring C-reactive protein (CRP) and serum ferritin at least twice weekly. CRP is a pattern recognition receptor made by the liver in response to bacterial infection or necrotic tissue. CRP binds to C-components of microbes or the externalized phosphatidylcholine moiety of necrotic cells, complexes with complement, and attaches to the CRP receptor on the macrophage for internalization, degradation, and presentation to the adaptive immune system. Ferritin is released by macrophages in response to free hemoglobin and to DNA viremia. Hyperferritinemia occurs in iron overload states and can also be released by dying cells during necrosis. Mortality risk increases as the circulating CRP and serum ferritin increase. The goal of therapy is to subdue the inflammatory response for which CRP and serum ferritin are surrogate biomarkers. If CRP increases while serum ferritin decreases, this combination is a harbinger of new or worsening infection and warrants attention to better source control and reduction in immune suppression. If ferritin does not come down or increases, then ongoing iron overload and/or macrophage activation (possibly associated with DNA viremia) is likely. Attention should be given to reducing hemolysis, quelling macrophage activation, and neutralizing DNA viremia. This approach to monitoring is illustrated in Fig. 14.4.\n",

For patients presenting with erythroderma, one must consider toxic shock from Group A Streptococcus or Staphylococcus aureus, which warrants therapy with clindamycin to prevent toxin production and an antimicrobial drug which kills both of these pathogens such as vancomycin. We do not use linezolid because hepatobiliary dysfunction reduces its safety window; specifically, linezolid can become a host mitochondrial toxin when blood concentrations increase due to poor clearance. We recommend immunomodulation with corticosteroids (30 mg/kg per day of methylprednisolone \u00d7 3 days) and IVIG (2 g/kg over 1\u20134 days). If the patients have evidence of acute kidney injury, thrombocytopenia, and elevated lactate dehydrogenase, we recommend daily plasma exchange 1.5 \u00d7 blood volume on day 1 followed by 1 \u00d7 volume daily until serum ferritin decreases to less than 500 ng/mL.
