            "text": "Neoplastically transformed astrocytes express functionally active cell surface \u03b2 adrenergic receptors (\u03b2ARs). Treatment of glioma models in vitro and in vivo with \u03b2 adrenergic agonists variably amplifies or attenuates cellular proliferation. In the majority of in vivo models, \u03b2 adrenergic agonists generally reduce cellular proliferation. However, treatment with \u03b2 adrenergic agonists consistently reduces tumor cell invasive potential, angiogenesis, and metastasis. \u03b2 adrenergic agonists induced decreases of invasive potential are chiefly mediated through reductions in the expression of matrix metalloproteinases types 2 and 9. Treatment with \u03b2 adrenergic agonists also clearly reduce tumoral neoangiogenesis, which may represent a putatively useful mechanism to adjuvantly amplify the effects of bevacizumab. Bevacizumab is a monoclonal antibody targeting the vascular endothelial growth factor receptor. We may accordingly designate \u03b2agonists to represent an enhancer of bevacizumab. The antiangiogenic effects of \u03b2 adrenergic agonists may thus effectively render an otherwise borderline effective therapy to generate significant enhancement in clinical outcomes. \u03b2 adrenergic agonists upregulate expression of the major histocompatibility class II DR alpha gene, effectively potentiating the immunogenicity of tumor cells to tumor surveillance mechanisms. Authors have also demonstrated crossmodal modulation of signaling events downstream from the \u03b2 adrenergic cell surface receptor and microtubular polymerization and depolymerization. Complex effects and desensitization mechanisms of the \u03b2 adrenergic signaling may putatively represent promising therapeutic targets. Constant stimulation of the \u03b2 adrenergic receptor induces its phosphorylation by \u03b2 adrenergic receptor kinase (\u03b2ARK), rendering it a suitable substrate for alternate binding by \u03b2 arrestins 1 or 2. The binding of a \u03b2 arrestin to \u03b2ARK phosphorylated \u03b2AR promotes receptor mediated internalization and downregulation of cell surface receptor and contemporaneously generates a cell surface scaffold at the \u03b2AR. The scaffold mediated activation of extracellular regulated kinase 1/2, compared with protein kinase A mediated activation, preferentially favors cytosolic retention of ERK1/2 and blunting of nuclear translocation and ensuant pro-transcriptional activity. Thus, \u03b2AR desensitization and consequent scaffold assembly effectively retains the cytosolic homeostatic functions of ERK1/2 while inhibiting its pro-proliferative effects. We suggest these mechanisms specifically will prove quite promising in developing primary and adjuvant therapies mitigating glioma growth, angiogenesis, invasive potential, and angiogenesis. We suggest generating compounds and targeted mutations of the \u03b2 adrenergic receptor favoring \u03b2 arrestin binding and scaffold facilitated activation of ERK1/2 may hold potential promise and therapeutic benefit in adjuvantly treating most or all cancers. We hope our discussion will generate fruitful research endeavors seeking to exploit these mechanisms.",

Human (e.g., U-251-MG, LM, and 1321 N1 astrocytoma cell lines) and rat (e.g., C6, C62B) glioma cells widely overexpress pharmacologically-stimulable and functionally active cell surface \u03b2 adrenergic receptors (\u03b2ARs) [4, 5] . In mice transfected with U87 cells in order to induce gliomagenesis in vivo, tumors overexpress \u03b2 2 ARs by approximately two-fold compared with cells of nearby healthy parenchyma [6] . Accordingly, \u03b2 adrenergic receptor modulated signaling regulates intracellular signal transduction pathways implicated in the initiation, promotion, and progression of carcinogenesis. Studies have extensively indicated \u03b2 adrenergic signaling powerfully modulates tumor cell proliferation, angiogenesis, invasiveness, and metastasis [7] . Authors have collectively elucidated these effects in glioma models in vitro [8, 9] and in vivo [10] . We extensively discuss differential signal transduction pathways conveying \u03b2 adrenergic signaling to cytosolic and nuclear mechanisms mediating cell surface receptor desensitization in untransformed and neoplastically transformed glioma cells [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] . Our molecularly-oriented discourse will shed light on the apparent paradoxical behavior of carcinomas in response to pharmacological agonism or antagonism of \u03b2 adrenergic receptor modulated signaling in vitro and in vivo. In so doing, we effectively illumine the potential utility of developing compounds modulating \u03b2 adrenergic receptor modulated signaling in the treatment of cerebral gliomas [10] . The development of a thorough understanding of these mechanisms will pave the way and enhance our capacity to develop novel therapeutic approaches to induce log cell eradication of malignantly transformed astrocytes constituting cerebral gliomas [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] .",

Cyclic AMP allosterically activates protein kinase A (PKA) by binding its regulatory subunits and physically releasing its catalytic subunits [24] [25] [26] [27] . Ligand binding mediated promotion of \u03b2 adrenergic receptor modulated signaling concurrently potentiates the catalytic enzymatic activity of phospholipase C, generating diacylglycerol (DAG) and inositol triphosphate (IP 3 ) from the precursor phospholipid phosphatidyl inositol diphosphate (PIP 2 ). DAG allosterically activates protein kinase C, which phosphorylatively modulates a host of intracellular signal transduction pathways. Binding of IP 3 to receptors studding the phospholipid bilayer membrane of the sarcoplasmic reticulum enhances the release of divalent cationic calcium from abundant organellar stores to the cytosol. Ligand-activated \u03b2 adrenergic receptors transactivate intracellular tyrosine, serine-threonine, or SRC kinase-coupled membrane protein growth factor receptors [28] [29] [30] [31] . C-terminal phosphorylated \u03b2 adrenergic receptor \u03b2 arrestin complexes constituting nidal signaling scaffolds may selectively and specifically potentiate ERK1/2 activity and a set of variably related intracellular signal transduction pathways (Figs. 3, 4) [32] [33] [34] .",

(N.B. C6 glioma cells undergo downregulation of cell surface \u03b2 adrenergic receptor expression when grown in serum [37] ). Agonist binding to the \u03b2 adrenergic receptor renders it suitable to undergo carboxyl terminal phosphorylation by \u03b2 adrenergic receptor kinase (\u03b2ARK) [11, 14] , \u03b2 arrestin 1 and/ or 2 binding of phosphorylated \u03b2 adrenergic receptor C-terminal sterically hinders \u03b2AR-G protein coupling [66, 81] . The adapter function of \u03b2 arrestin proteins promotes binding of clathrin to the internal layer of phospholipid zones surrounding \u03b2ARs, which effects clathrin-coated pit-mediated receptor endocytosis [13] . The \u03b2AR-\u03b2 arrestin scaffold promotes binding of ERK1/2, c Jun N terminal kinase 3 (JNK3), Raf, cRaf1, and MEK1 (Figs. 3, 4) [11, 12, 15] . Preferential activation of these signaling proteins which classically promote cellular proliferation when activated by protein kinase A by the scaffold mechanism coordinately favors cytosolic retention and effects of these proteins and prevents nuclear translocation and pro-transcriptional activity-mediated promotion of deoxyribonucleic acid and proteins constituting the mitotic machinery [11, 12] . \u03b2 arrestin 1 exhibits preferentially stable binding kinetics with the \u03b2AR compared with \u03b2 arrestin 2. Binding of the amino terminus of \u03b2 arrestin 1 to the carboxyl terminus of \u03b2AR generates stable receptor internalization and slow \u03b2AR GPCR dephosphorylation, slowing return to the cell membrane [15] . Stable \u03b2 arrestin 1 \u03b2AR binding favors scaffold assembly and scaffold mediated activation of the pleiotropically-acting kinase ERK1/2 [12, 15] . Thus, the same set of mechanisms which mediates desensitization and internalization of the \u03b2 adrenergic receptor [15] coordinately contributes to modulating the effects mediated by ERK1/2 [11, 12, 15] .",

Kinetics of \u03b2 arrestin dissociation from GPCRs powerfully determine receptor conformational changes and dictate effects of downstream signaling [15] . Angiotensin 1 A , vasopressin 2, neurotensin, and dopamine receptor carboxyl termini bind \u03b2 arrestin 2 stably with slower dissociation kinetics compared with the carboxyl terminal of \u03b2ARs, generating stable clathrin coated pit-mediated internalization with slower dephosphorylation and return to the cell membrane [15] . The stable binding preferentially favors the cytosolic retention and activity ERK1/2, while downregulating the nuclear effects of the kinase [11, 12] . \u03b2 arrestin 2 binds the \u03b1 1b and \u03b2 2 adrenergic A Turkey \u03b21 adrenergic receptor sequence illustrated in relation to secondary structural elements (these refer to alpha helices, beta pleated sheets, and beta bends).

Rapid dissociation kinetics generates equivalently rapid removal of phosphate moieties from the G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) and return of endocytosed receptor to the plasmalemmal phospholipid bilayer [15] and preferentially enhances G protein mediated effects of G protein coupled receptor activation and comparatively attenuates scaffold mediated effects upon signal transduction pathways, coordinately promoting nuclear translocation of, and transcriptional upregulation mediated by, activated ERK1/2.",

Studies have provided evidence indicating ligand activation of \u03b2 adrenergic receptor modulated signaling may either promote or blunt proliferation of malignantly transformed cells in glioma models [4, [38] [39] [40] [41] [42] [43] [44] and extra-neuraxial carcinoma [45] [46] [47] [48] [49] . Specifically, ligand activation of \u03b2 adrenergic receptors potently amplifies cellular proliferation in lung [7] , gastric [50] , hepatocellular [51] , pancreatic [52] , colorectal [53] , breast [54, 55] , ovarian [56, 57] , and prostatic [49] carcinoma models in vitro. Paradoxically, pharmacological antagonism of \u03b2 adrenergic receptors also potently attenuates cellular proliferation in hemangioblastoma [58] and hepatic [55] , pancreatic [59] , gastric [50] , colorectal [46] , breast [54, 55] , ovarian, and prostatic [60] carcinoma models in vitro. \u03b2 antagonists reduce cellular proliferation and migration in neuroblastoma cell lines [8] , enhance therapeutic concentrations of co-administered medications [8] , and reduce expression of P-glycoprotein inhibitors [61] . \u03b2 adrenergic receptor agonists were shown to reduce the proliferation of MDA-MB-231 human breast cancer cells [48, 118] . Succinctly, blunting of tumor cell proliferation in vitro by \u03b2 adrenergic agonists results from desensitization and by \u03b2 adrenergic antagonists results directly from receptor antagonism [62] . Studies have alternately demonstrated improved [63] or reduced [64] survival in patients harboring ovarian carcinoma receiving pharmacological antagonists of \u03b2 adrenergic receptors. The bitopic agonist and GPR55 antagonist ( , ' )-4\u2032-methoxy-1-naphthylfenoterol, which may be designated as ( , ' )-MNF, significantly reduces mitogenic potential in melanoma by modulating cyclic AMP protein kinase A-dependent pathways [65] .

The bitopic compound ( , ' )-fenoterol inhibits proliferation of, and reduces l-arginine uptake in, N1321 astrocytoma and U118 glioblastoma cells [9] . Stimulation of purinergic receptor Fig. 2 \u03b2 adrenergic receptor G protein cycle. A Extracellular agonist binds to the \u03b2 adrenergic receptor effecting conformational changes within the cytoplasmic ends of the receptor transmembrane domains, allowing the heterotrimeric G protein to bind the \u03b2 adrenergic receptor. G protein binding to the \u03b2 adrenergic receptor facilitates conformational changes promoting GTP-GDP exchange by the \u03b1 subunit, facilitating dissociation of the catalytic \u03b1 and noncatalytic \u03b2gamma subunit. The G protein catalytic \u03b1 and noncatalytic \u03b2gamma subunits mediate various effector activities. The G protein activity stimulates adenylate cyclase activity and the noncatalytic \u03b2gamma subunit is demonstrated activating membrane calcium channels mediating entry of extracellular calcium to the cytosol. The \u03b1 subunit subsequently catalyzes hydrolysis of bound guanosine triphosphate to guanosine diphosphate, mediating G protein \u03b1 and \u03b2gamma subunit reconstitution. The G protein \u03b2gamma noncatalytic subunit also ferries the \u03b2 adrenergic receptor kinase towards the \u03b2 adrenergic receptor. B The purified \u03b2 adrenergic receptor Gs protein complex free of nucleotides is maintained in detergent micelles. The G\u03b1 subunit consists of the Ras domain (\u03b1Ras) with GTPase activity and the \u03b1-helical domain (\u03b1AH). Both subunits are involved in nucleotide binding. In the nucleotide-free condition, the \u03b1 helical domain has a variable position relative to the G\u03b1 Ras domain. Reprinted with permission from Rasmussen et al. [81] (P2Y12) modulated signaling inhibits cyclic AMP from tonically inhibiting protein kinase B, which in turn tonically restricts C6 glioma cells from undergoing differentiation [70] . Thus, we may, by extension, consider promoting the enzymatic catalytic activity of adenylate cyclase enhances the synthesis of cyclic adenosine monophosphate and restricts protein kinase B from tonically inhibiting proliferation of C6 glioma cells. Similarly, phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3K) mediated enhancement of cyclic AMP synthesis would concurrently promote cellular differentiation [70] . Though our best understanding of molecular pathways converging upon, and diverging through, protein kinase A, would lead us to surmise enhanced levels of intracellular cyclic adenosine monophosphate and activity of ERK1/2 (2) \u03b2 arrestins facilitate ubiquitinylation of receptors by forming scaffolds comprised of E3 ligase, bringing these enzymes into close proximity with the receptors, thereby promoting receptor ubiquitinylation and trafficking to lysosomes for degradation. (3) \u03b2 arrestin1 serves as an adaptor protein bringing the E3 ligase MDM2 to the activated insulin like growth factor-1 receptor, thereby promoting ubiquitinylation of receptor and subsequent proteasomal degradation. (4) \u03b2 arrestins compete with insulin receptor substrate 1 for MDM2, thereby reducing insulininduced MDM2-mediated ubiquitinylation of insulin receptor substrate 1 and proteasomal degradation. Insulin receptor substrate 1. \u03b2 arrestins thus enhance sensitivity to insulin signaling. (5) Stimulation by insulin through tyrosine kinase receptors promotes phosphorylation of \u03b2-arrestin, ubiquitinylation, and receptor downregulation, thereby augmenting heptahelical transmembrane receptor-mediated G protein signaling and reducing signaling facilitated by the adapter function of \u03b2 arrestin promoting scaffold assembly. \u03b2-arrestinmediated signaling (e.g., to extracellular regulated kinase 1/2). (6) In Drosophila melanogaster, Kurtz, the nonvisual homologin of arrestin, interacts with the ubiquitin ligase Deltex in order to facilitate Notch ubiquitinylation. Notch ubiquitinylation promotes its proteasomal degradation. Reprinted with permission from Lefkowitz et al. [13] Fig. 4 Conventional compared to biased heptahelical transmembrane receptor signaling. A Agonist-stimulated heptahelical transmembrane receptor signaling is mediated via both heterotrimeric G proteins and \u03b2 arrestins. B Conventional antagonists bind heptahelical transmembrane receptor proteins and prevent agonist stimulated signaling through both heterotrimeric G proteins and \u03b2 arrestins. C Soi-disant biased agonists/antagonists (e.g., SII-angiotensin II) prevent heterotrimeric G protein signaling mediated by agonist stimulation of G protein coupled receptor while promoting \u03b2 arrestin facilitated scaffold signaling.

Cross-talk between \u03b2AR with G i protein-coupled receptors may contribute to differential effects mediated by \u03b2 adrenergic receptor modulated signaling. For example, ligand activation of GABA B receptors inhibits isoproterenol-mediated enhancement of pancreatic cancer cell proliferation [89] , providing evidence indicating a critical importance of crosstalk amongst \u03b2 adrenergic and the complement constituents of the family of G protein-coupled receptors. Crossmodal modulation of cell surface receptor activation, desensitization, and scaffold-mediated effects may critically contribute to differential effects generated by alternate stable or transient ligand binding of pharmacological agonists or antagonists to \u03b2ARs in different tumor cell lines [88] .

Enhancement of cytosolic calcium concentrations by treatment with thrombin reverts cellular morphology from astrocytic-to epithelial-like [98] , presumably via calcium-mediated downregulation of \u03b2ARmediated enhancement of cytosolic concentrations of cyclic AMP. Treatment with the direct thrombin inhibitor hirudin, but not with antithrombin III [98] , inhibited \u03b2AR activation mediated cellular morphological transformation. Thrombin effects upon cellular morphology are likely mediated through activation of cell surface platelet activated receptors (PARs). The experimental findings collectively indicate \u03b2 adrenergic receptor agonists and thrombin coordinately converge on modulating intracellular signal transduction pathways affecting dynamic microtubular architecture by modulating cyclic AMP levels through ligand binding mediated effector coupling of allosterically activated membrane surface receptors [97, 98] . Pharmacological antagonism of the mGlu3 receptor attenuates glioma cellular proliferation and enhances transformation of glioma cells from a fibroblastic to an astrocytic phenotype [55] . The described behavior may play a critical role in invasion and metastasis of cerebral glioma cells through crossmodal modulation amongst and between G s and G i protein coupled receptors [55] .",

Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) modulate cellular proliferative capacity, cellular migration, and neoangiogenesis and enhance glioma cell capacity to invade and metastasize by enzymatically degrading the basement membrane and extracellular matrix [6] . MMP-2 and MMP-9 represent the predominantly extracellularlyliberated isoforms implicated in enhancing invasion and metastasis by glioma cells [102] . Human brain microvascular endothelial cells (HBMECs) maintain the microarchitectural integrity of the blood brain barrier [103] . Treatment of HBMECs grown on collagen I, collagen IV, fibronectin, laminin, or hyaluronic acid with cyclic AMP supplements enhances microarchitectural junctional continuity and expression of zona occludin 1, VE-cadherin, and claudin 5 [103] . Inhibition of MMP-9 effectively forestalls HBMEC neoangiogenesis [104] , invasiveness [104] , and metastasis [105] in vitro. Treatment of rat C6 glioma cells with eugenol encapsulated chitosan nanopolymers reduces tumor cell metastatic potential by reducing the expression of MMP-9 [105] .

Fenoterols represent ideal candidate molecular structures which could be chemically modified in order to optimize agonist potency and generate specific beta adrenergic receptor conformations conducive of tighter binding of \u03b2 arrestins. The fenoterol core structure consists of a bisubstituted meta dihydroxphenyl moiety and an ethanolamine side chain. The side chain attachments include a methyl or ethyl group in the R1 position and various ring form modifications of substituted (hydroxy, amino, methoxy) benzyl or naphthyl rings. IC 50 /EC 50 ratios are inversely proportional to potency of inhibition of tritiated thymidine incorporation, a measure of DNA synthesis and thus cel-lular proliferative capacity. Lower ratios between the IC 50 and EC 50 correlate with lower concentrations of drug necessary to attenuates rates of synthetic thymidine incorporation into DNA. These fenoterol derivates effect potent inhibition of cellular proliferative capacity and effect cellular apoptosis. Different fenoterol stereoisomers generate differential percentage changes of HepG2 cells and inhibition of 1321 N astrocytoma cell mitogenic capacity, as measured by tritiated thymidine incorporation. The \u03b1 carbon and \u03b3 amine groups represent steroisomerically active centers [51, 65, 66, 73, 85, 86] . Reprinted with permission from Paul et al.

We detail a subset of the findings relevant to the emergent acquisition of an integrated and cohesive conceptual framework from which to understand the crossmodal interactions of these pathways by, and satisfaction of, the distinguished reader [111] . Hypoxia [1% O 2 ] upregulates the expression of HIF-1\u03b1, MMP-2, and MMP-9 downregulated expression of TIMP-1 in U87MG, U251MG, U373MG, and LN18 human glioma cell lines related to normoxic [21% O 2 ] conditions [111] . Treatment with HIF-1\u03b1 small interfering ribonucleic acid (siRNA) reduced expression of HIF-1\u03b1, MMP-2, and MMP-9 and blunted tumor cell invasion in glioma spheroids co-cultured with rat-derived brain slices; the magnitude of these effects was preferentially amplified under normoxic conditions (1%) [111] . The results collectively indicate hypoxia enhances glioma tumor migration and invasive potential by upregulating the expression of MMP-2 and MMP-9 in a HIF-1\u03b1-dependent manner [111] .

Protease inhibitor-mediated attenuation of ADAM17 proteolytic enzymatic activity or siRNA mediated downregulation of ADAM17 expression reduces hypoxia-mediated enhancement of 9L rat gliosarcoma and U87 human glioma cell invasiveness [107] . Molecular inhibition of the mammalian target of rapamycin induced G 1 cell cycle arrest, reduced synthesis of VEGF, and downregulated the expression of MMP-2 and/or MMP-9 in PTEN (phosphatase and tensin homolog deleted from chromosome 10)-null U87MG and D54 human glioma cells, but not PTEN-null HOG oligodendroglioma cells [77] . Treatment of U87 xenografts in vivo induces glioma regression, presumably indicating cellular apoptosis, reduces tumoral VEGF expression, and blunts the expression of MMP-2 [77] . Treatment with fentanyl reduces cellular proliferation, migration, and invasion of gastric cancer MGC-803 cells in vitro, attenuates PI3K/ Akt signaling, reduces expression of MMP-9, and enhances expression of the pro-apoptotic proteins caspase-9 and death-associated protein kinase 1 (DAPK1) [105] , the latter pair of effects synergistically enhanced by treatment with the PI3K molecular inhibitor LY294002 and MMP-9 molecular inhibitor SB-3CT. Accordingly, pharmacological modulation of \u03b2 adrenergic receptor modulated signaling may be exploited to blunt tumor cell invasion by reducing MMP expression levels in human intracranial (e.g., glioma, glioblastoma, gliosarcoma) and extra-neuraxial (e.g., melanoma, breast cancer, gastric cancer, pancreatic cancer, colorectal cancer, prostate cancer, ovarian cancer) carcinomas and sarcomas. These effects may be synergistically enhanced by coordinately administering \u03b2AR modulators with mTOR inhibitors, HIF-1\u03b1 pathway modulators, the serine protease inhibitor and tryptase inhibitor nafamostat mesylate, conventional cytotoxic chemotherapy, monoclonal antibodies to tumor-specific growth factor receptors, tumor-specific cytotoxic CD3 + CD8 + T cells.",

Treatment with norepinephrine [115] or dopamine [116] and stress promote angiogenesis in ovarian carcinomas by potentiating \u03b2AR mediated attenuation of PPAR\u03b3 signaling and thus disinhibiting the synthesis of VEGF and FGF2, molecular behavior putatively extending to cerebral gliomas [116] . Reciprocally, pharmacological antagonist of \u03b2 adrenergic receptor modulated signaling specifically forestalls incipient endothelial tubulogenesis and emergent angiogenesis, sans altering cell viability or migratory capacity, by reducing the expression of matrix metalloproteases in HBMECs in vitro [6] . Chronic stress attenuates PPAR\u03b3-mediated signaling via upregulating activity through \u03b2 adrenergic receptor modulated pathways, effectively disinhibiting the synthesis of VEGF and FGF2 and precluding angiogenesis in models of ovarian carcinoma, a set of effects attenuated through the use of pioglitazone [113] . To this end, pediatricians now commonly espouse the use of propranolol to effect involution of the vascular endothelium in infants harboring benign hemangiomas [6] . The revealed set of molecular effects may be exploited to therapeutic benefit to generate marked reductions in glioma [6, 76] and extra-neuraxial [113, 114] hypervascular carcinoma growth potential, invasiveness, and angiogenesis.

            "text": "\u03b2AR modulated signaling and downstream target pathways play critical immunomodulatory roles by regulating MHC class II expression human glioma cell lines [124] . In differentiated U-373-MG, U-105-MG, and D-54-MG glioblastoma cells, treatment with the \u03b2AR agonist isoproterenol (1 \u00d7 10 -6 to 5 \u00d7 10 -6 M), adenylate cyclase activator forskolin, or cyclic AMP analogue deoxybromo-cyclic AMP (DBcAMP), enhance membrane cell surface expression of MHC class II DR molecules, effects generally mediated by enhanced synthesis of transcriptionally-nascent messenger ribonucleic acid transcripts [124] . For example, treatment with norepinephrine and isoproterenol upregulate MHC class II cell surface expression in U-373-MG differentiated glioblastoma cells [124] . Treatment with isoproterenol enhances expression of MHC class II in U-373-MG cells to a greater extent compared with norepinephrine, given concurrent selective stimulation of \u03b2AR by the former and concurrent stimulation of \u03b2 and \u03b1 adrenergic receptors by the latter. IFN-\u03b3 enhances MHC class II expression in U-105-MG (1.5fold increase) and D-54-MG (2.5-fold increase) glioblastoma cell lines to a greater extent compared with the upregulation of MHC class II synthesis elicited by IFN-\u03b3 in U-373-MG cells [124] . Treatment with IFN-\u03b3 coordinately enhances neuroblastoma membrane cell surface expression of MHC class I \u03b2 2 -microglobulin complexed tetradomain multimers, an effect not generated by treatment with DBcAMP [126] . Treatment with the decarboxylated [3,4-DOPA decarboxylase; cofactor biotin) hydroxylated (dopamine\u03b2-hydroxylase; cofactor tetrahydrobiopterin) 3,4-dihydroxphenylalanine catecholamine derivative norepinephrine prevents IFN-\u03b3 mediated enhancement of MHC class II cell surface expression [127] . The finding perhaps collectively indicates norepinephrine-and IFN\u03b3-mediated enhancement of MHC class II expression share a common and overlapping downstream set of mediators, likely converging upon, and diverging through, cyclic AMP and protein kinase A. Thus, \u03b2 adrenergic agonists and interferon-\u03b3 may generate therapeutically exploitable immunomodulatory effects in treating gliomas by upregulating cellular mediated gliomatotoxic immune responses through adenylate cyclase-cAMPprotein kinase A-dependent upregulation of membrane cell surface expression of MHC class II complexed-tumoral antigens and thus putatively represent effective adjuvants which may enhance the effects of tumor therapies enhancing host immune mechanisms (tumor antigen-specific antibodies, CD3 + CD8 + cytotoxic T cells, and NK cells) curtailing proliferation, angiogenesis, invasion, and metastasis of glioma cells. We present the caveat that treatment with neither isoproterenol nor forskolin upregulated DR\u03b1 gene expression in HL-60 promyelocytic leukemic cells [128] , evidencing possible heterogeneity of the effect according to specific tumor cell type or inter-experimental differences. Treatment with \u03b2AR agonists or TNF-\u03b1 promotes proliferation of C6 glioma cells in vitro, with the latter coordinately upregulating \u03b2AR cell surface density via \u03b2ARdependent and PKC-mediated signaling [124] , effects indicating crossmodal interaction between \u03b2AR signaling and molecular immune mediators. The findings of Lung et al. collectively indicate TNF promotes proliferation of C6 glioma cells through \u03b2 adrenergic receptor activation [39] . The secreted pro-inflammatory protein cytokine tumor necrosis factor \u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1), synthesized and elaborated by macrophages and microglia, binds membrane cell surface receptors possessing intracellular receptor tyrosine kinase activity and potentiates and mediates a spectrum of effects on cellular genetic transcription and tissue physiology. TNF-\u03b1 enhances macrophage synthesis of IL-1, hypothalamic synthesis of prostaglandins and pyrogen proteins, hepatically-synthesized acute phase reactants (IL-6, mannose binding protein), vascular endothelial expression of inter-endothelial cellular adhesion-and vascular cellular adhesion molecule-1 and synergistically potentiate adaptive immune effector and memory mechanisms. TNF-\u03b1 amplifies pyrogenic signaling in hypothalamic nuclei by raising the thermic set point, enhancing equilibria of biochemical metabolism, promoting non-shivering thermogenesis, and augmenting innate and adaptive immune responses, effects we suggest potentiate host immune mediated eradication of malignantly-transformed tumor cells.",

Specifically, isoproterenol was shown to synergistically enhance TNF-mediated upregulation of A20 and IL-6, attenuates TNF-mediated downregulation of LEF1, with a non-statistically significant tendency towards blunting TNF-mediated upregulation of ICAM-1 and VCAM-1 in cultured astrocytes [129] . The biological mechanisms upon which these effects are predicated, investigated in the context of glioma, may be extended to rational therapeutic design of medications designed to treat systemic inflammatory response syndrome, sepsis, severe sepsis, septic shock, and multiorgan dysfunction syndrome [129] . As an aside, \u03b2agonists enhance the synthesis of alveolar surfactant and compliance of the pulmonary parenchyma, a therapeutically exploitable corollary effect of \u03b2agonists upon pulmonary mechanics [130] . In the author's anecdotal experience in the critical care unit, maintaining a very low dose of norepinephrine [1-2 \u03bcg/kg/min) seems to correlate with improved metrics of tissue oxygenation (oxygenation index; P a O 2 :FIO 2 ratio) in patients experiencing severe acute lung injury occurring in the context of septic shock.",

Typical agonists or bitopic agonist-antagonists, such as ( , ' )-MNF, exhibiting contemporaneous effects on GPR55 signaling, may exert cytostatic effects proving therapeutically beneficial in the adjuvant treatment of gliomas and extra-neuraxial malignancies [65] . Reinartz et al. identified the ( , ' ), as well as the ( , ' )-stereoisomers of the bitopic agent 4\u2032-methoxy-1-naphthyl-fenoterol to exhibit preferential binding to \u03b2ARs coupling to G s protein [86] . Since these ligands preferentially favored G proteinmediated signaling in response to \u03b2AR activation, disfavoring phosphorylation of the carboxyl terminal of the \u03b2AR and \u03b2 arrestin binding, these agents represent a unique set of \u03b2agonists to which desensitization develops slowly, and may be exploited therapeutically in the treatment of common medical conditions in lieu of classically utilized \u03b2agonists, postulates subjectable to rigorous empirical interrogation. The specific stereoisomeric conformation of fenoterol derivatives and composition of the aminoalkyl moiety dictates binding affinity to \u03b22 adrenoceptor-G s \u03b1 fusion proteins [85] . The efforts of medicinal chemists to further modify these agents will arm us with the capacity to develop compounds uniquely and preferentially generating carboxyl terminal \u03b2ARK-phosphorylated \u03b2AR-\u03b2 arrestin complexes preferentially favoring scaffold-mediated ERK1/2 activation [11, 12] .",

The prudent modulation of \u03b2AR modulated signaling, putatively employing combinatorial therapeutic strategies exploiting bitopic fenoterol derivative compounds and nafamostat mesylate, may effectively blunt the progression of macular degeneration and retino-degenerative diseases [85, 86] . Molecular pharmacological enhancers or inhibitors of protein machinery contributing to desensitization of \u03b2 adrenergic receptors and modulators of the scaffold promoted effects of distal signal transduction pathways of \u03b2 adrenergic receptor may generate potent antitumoral effects [141, 142] . Studies have thoroughly demonstrated and elucidated the structural conformations of cyto-transductively active and inactive conformations of the \u03b2 adrenergic receptor [13, 14, 16, 81] . This information may be exploited in order to genetically engineer chimeric \u03b2 adrenergic receptor constructs, for example, exhibiting more stable binding dynamics with \u03b2 arrestin, thus promoting scaffold-promoted effects of the G protein-coupled receptor \u03b2 arrestin [13, 85, 86] , including cytosolic retention of activated ERK1/2 and inhibition of its nuclear translocation, thus preventing cellular proliferation consequent to enhanced transcriptional activity [11, 12] . Precedence for these effects was shown by Tohgo et al., who generated chimeric constructs of the vasopressin receptor by replacing its native carboxyl terminal amino acid sequence with that of the carboxyl terminal end of the \u03b2 adrenergic receptor [9] . Further studies utilizing targeted genetic mutations of the carboxyl terminal chain of amino acid residues of the \u03b2 adrenergic receptor and amino terminal chain of amino acid residues of the \u03b2 arrestin protein may enhance our capacity to generate genetically-modified stable constructs promoting scaffold-mediated activation of ERK1/2, chimeric constructs transfectable utilizing adenoviral vectors [11, 12] .",

These therapies may prove of clinical utility in curtailing initiation, promotion, and progression of gliomas and may prove to represent a useful general adjuvant to multimodal therapy of glioblastoma [6, 76, 111] . Immunomodulatory effects of \u03b2 adrenergic signaling, prominently regulating cell surface expression of MHC class II, suggests manipulating these pathways may represent an effective adjuvant technique to be utilized in conjunction with various immunotherapeutic approaches, including generation of tumor specific antibodies, cytotoxic T cells, and NK cells in a variety of cancers [124] .[N.B.: As a brief aside, our empirically derived instinctual conceptualization leads us to surmise coordinate treatment with modulators of \u03b2 adrenergic signaling, the bitopic compounds ( , ' )-MNF and ( , ' )-fenoterol, and/or the serine protease inhibitor nafamostat mesylate may exert synergistically therapeutic effects in the setting of cerebral glioma and extra-neuraxial carcinoma, neurovascular disease, and septic shock (Patent Pending, Ghali and Ghali, authors of the present work) and coronavirus COVID-19 responsible for the emerging international pandemic [148] .

The serine protease inhibitor nafamostat mesylate interferes with pro-S protein cleavage, preventing effective fusion of the Middle East respiratory coronavirus with host eukaryotic target cells [149] . Nafamostat mesylate was shown to prevent 'S'-mediated membrane fusion according to a Renilla luciferase assay and prevent MERS-CoV infection in vitro in a preparation of Calu3 cells [149] . Nafamostat mesylate interferes with the proteolytic cleavage of Ebola virus envelope proteins necessary for virus-host cell fusion by reducing the proteolytic release of CatB from rat pancreas [150] and microvascular leakage in patients with Dengue hemorrhage fever and shock through tryptase inhibition, blocking vascular leakage in vivo [151] .",

Studies have alternately demonstrated amplification or attenuation of cellular proliferation of gliomas [6, 39, 40] and extra-neuraxial carcinomas in response to pharmacological enhancement of \u03b2 adrenergic receptor modulated signaling [8, 45, 46, 49, 51, 52, 54, 57, 63, 152] . The character of \u03b2agonist utilized, tumor model and preparation type, receptor regulation dynamics, and differential distal signal transduction mechanisms may explain inter-experimental differences. The wise development of a set of experiments designed to more precisely characterize the full complement of effects mediated by \u03b2 adrenergic receptor modulated signaling in carcinogenic initiation, promotion, and progression, immunogenic modulation, angiogenesis, and tumor cell tissue invasion and metastasis, specifically [6] . Crystallographic studies will further characterize inactive, transitional, and active tridimensional conformations of the \u03b2 adrenergic receptor and specific conformational modifications induced by treatment with various agonists and antagonists of the heptahelical transmembrane G protein coupled receptor [14, 16] . Conformational protein modifications may differentially stabilize or destabilize binding between \u03b2 adrenergic receptor carboxyl termini and \u03b2 arrestin amino termini, thus generating differential effects upon desensitization, receptor endocytosis, and scaffold formation [11, 12, 14, 16] . Rational drug design and mathematical models of \u03b2AR-drug binding will identify drug-specific and tumor cell-specific factors rendering \u03b2 adrenergic receptor modulated signaling more likely to promote or inhibit cellular proliferation, unveil determinants contributing to preferential G s versus G i activation or inhibition, and identify optimal bio-organic compounds modulating the conformational state of \u03b2 adrenergic receptors in staying the progression of glioblastoma [85, 86, 131, 132] . Adenoviral transfection with chimeric constructs of \u03b2 adrenergic receptors possessing carboxyl termini with high binding affinity to \u03b2 arrestin amino termini and/or \u03b2 arrestins possessing amino termini with high ligand binding affinity to GPCR carboxyl termini targeted specifically to glioma cells and high activity promoters may effectively preferentially promote scaffold-mediated activation of ERK1/2, blunting its nuclear translocation and retaining its cytosolic homeostatic effects, putatively proving to be a useful primary or adjuvant therapeutic approach enhancing the currently employed regimen of maximal safe resection, external beam radiotherapy, as well as concurrent and adjuvant temozolomide [21, 153] . We suggest a panoply of multimodal strategies designed to modulate \u03b2 adrenergic signaling represent promising therapeutic approaches to be exploited in the treatment of glioblastoma [65, 73, 85, 86, 153] . Preclinical studies will prove necessary in order to develop compounds exhibiting the specific and desired effects upon \u03b2 adrenergic receptor modulated signaling. Clinical studies will prove necessary in order to evaluate the safety and efficacy of these medications [65, 73, 85, 86] . Preclinical in vitro and in vivo studies and clinical studies will emergently cultivate an appreciation of the influence of pharmacological agonists, inverse agonists, antagonists of \u03b2 adrenergic receptor modulated signaling, and fenoterol derivative bitopics upon the biomolecular mechanistic underpinnings of \u03b2 adrenergic receptor modulated signaling upon molecular behavior of glioma cells and dynamic patterns of glioma growth, invasion, angiogenesis, and metastasis, and effects on survival metrics [65, 73, 85, 86, 151] (Table 1) .",
