Direct contacts represent the most obvious opportunities for a signal to be transmitted. However, because signals that persist after being deposited into the environment may later be acquired by other group members, indirect environmentally-mediated transmission is also possible. To date, studies of signal transmission within groups have focused on direct physical interactions and ignored the role of indirect pathways. Here, we use an agent-based model to study how the movement of individuals and characteristics of the signal being transmitted modulate transmission. By analysing the dynamic interaction networks generated from these simulations, we show that the addition of indirect pathways speeds up signal transmission, while the addition of physically-realistic collisions between individuals in densely packed environments hampers it. Furthermore, the inclusion of spatial biases that induce the formation of individual territories, reveals the existence of a trade-off such that optimal signal transmission at the group level is only achieved when territories are of intermediate sizes. Our findings provide insight into the selective pressures guiding the evolution of behavioural traits in natural groups, and offer a means by which multi-agent systems can be engineered to achieve desired transmission capabilities.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Abstract"}, {"text": "Animal societies consist of many individuals that must interact to coordinate their actions. The cohesion of such groups is typically achieved through a distributed network of short-range 'direct' interactions between neighbouring individuals. These serve to rapidly transmit information throughout the group [61, 92]. Shortrange contacts also represent a channel for the transmission of harmful pathogens, with the potential for large-scale epidemics being closely linked to the structure of the group interaction network [72, 77, 80, 81, 89] . Whilst information often spreads via dedicated interactions that have evolved for the purpose of communication, diseases often 'piggyback' over a diverse range of different interaction types that have evolved for other purposes, such as sexual contacts [67, 86] or face-to-face conversations [96, 107] . Furthermore, while information and disease play different roles, they may both be viewed as 'signals' that can be transmitted across a group. Although direct interactions based on physical contact are the most obvious means by which such signals can spread, other forms of transmission are possible. For example, some signals remain viable after being deposited into the environment. If such a signal is still viable when that location is later visited by another individual, then the second individual could acquire the signal. As this pathway does not require the sender and receiver to be present at the same time, this is termed 'indirect' transmission [23, 38, 84] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 523, "end": 527, "text": "[72,", "ref_id": "BIBREF71"}, {"start": 528, "end": 531, "text": "77,", "ref_id": "BIBREF76"}, {"start": 532, "end": 535, "text": "80,", "ref_id": "BIBREF79"}, {"start": 536, "end": 539, "text": "81,", "ref_id": "BIBREF80"}, {"start": 540, "end": 543, "text": "89]", "ref_id": "BIBREF88"}, {"start": 799, "end": 803, "text": "[67,", "ref_id": "BIBREF66"}, {"start": 804, "end": 807, "text": "86]", "ref_id": "BIBREF85"}, {"start": 838, "end": 842, "text": "[96,", "ref_id": "BIBREF95"}, {"start": 843, "end": 847, "text": "107]", "ref_id": "BIBREF106"}, {"start": 1507, "end": 1511, "text": "[23,", "ref_id": "BIBREF22"}, {"start": 1512, "end": 1515, "text": "38,", "ref_id": "BIBREF37"}, {"start": 1516, "end": 1519, "text": "84]", "ref_id": "BIBREF83"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Abstract"}, {"text": "Indirect communication is ubiquitous.

Over time edges are created and A susceptible agent j intersects a previously visited location of an infected agent i at t D 3. This gives an intersection delay of i!j .3/ D 2 time steps.

Conversely, slow decay of a signal produces strong trails and highly weighted edges (Figure adapted from Ref. [84]) destroyed. Direct edges appear and disappear whenever two agents make and break contact. An indirect edge appears when one agent (the receiver) visits a location that was previously visited by another agent (the sender), and disappears when the receiving agent leaves that location.

In cases where the dynamics of the epidemic process is much slower than the evolution of the network, this is not a problem as time-scale separation makes it possible to consider an 'annealed' network describing the averaged structure the process will encounter [113] . However, if the process has a similar time-scale to the network dynamics, it is essential that both these aspects are modelled concurrently. Temporal networks are well suited to describing such intermittent fluctuations, as they represent the dynamics as a sequence of static network slices [15, 43, 53, 54] .

For all agent densities, we again found that the transmission speed over combined networks was increased relative to networks composed of direct edges; signals with a low transmission probability and small decay rate saw the greatest enhancement in transmission for the combined networks (Fig. 2.5) . Furthermore, the agent density also modulated the magnitude of the transmission enhancement brought about by the addition of indirect edges; at low agent densities, the strength of the enhancement was maximal (Fig. 2.5, N D 10) , whereas at high agent densities the enhancement was weaker (Fig. 2.5, N D 250) .

This suggests that the beneficial role of indirect pathways has a greater impact when agents are sparse, raising the interesting possibility that natural populations broadly distributed in space will more heavily rely on indirect transmission pathways [25] . The reason for this density dependence derives from the presence of indirect edges. At low agent densities infected agents will have a low rate of physical contacts, whereas they may frequently visit locations that were previously visited by other agents.

This is in stark contrast to when collisions are absent, where infected agents can move throughout the environment to generate direct and indirect interactions with all other members of the population. As described previously, such increased mixing greatly reduces the overall diameter of the network and increases transmission speeds [84] . Long-range interactions also allow for a signal to be seeded at many different locations within the environment, leading to a rapid transmission across the entire population ( Fig. 2.7c) . Conversely, when collisions are present individuals become confined to a local area due to physical exclusion by nearby agents, hence an infected individual can only infect its nearest neighbours (Fig. 2.7c) . At the highest densities, the interaction network is essentially a direct reflection of the agents' spatial locations, with the all edges reflecting short-range interactions between immediate neighbours.

Our simulations have revealed that indirect transmission pathways can play a significant role in shaping the spread of infections with differing environmental decay rates; even signals with a very low probability of transmission can when deposited into the environment propagate quickly throughout an entire group, if they are able to remain viable for some period of time. Both individual behaviour and group density also play an important role in the transmission capabilities of the group. Higher agent densities led to the faster spread of an infection. However, at very high densities, if physical collisions are considered then the movement of each individual becomes sufficiently impaired to reduce the ability for longrange interactions to form and slows transmission.

Nevertheless, it is important to recognise that these simplifications ignore the fact that individuals in many real-world animal populations do exhibit strong behavioural responses to the presence of disease [35] and that these changes can significantly alter the transmission properties of the group [34] . Indeed, many animal species exhibit strong aversive behaviour to others that appear to be disease-carriers [24] , and in highly social species, responses to the presence of disease may also be implemented by coordinated group-level responses.
