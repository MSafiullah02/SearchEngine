A diagnosis of POTS is currently based on an increase in heart rate (HR) of \u226530 bpm, within 10 min of assuming an upright posture (standing or upright tilt), in the absence of orthostatic hypotension [decrease in blood pressure (BP) > 20/10 mmHg]. In young children, a higher HR threshold (\u226540 bpm) should be used, since healthy younger children have a greater physiological orthostatic tachycardia.",

Whereas patients with IST may benefi t from sinus node ablation, this procedure is rarely effective for the orthostatic tachycardia of POTS [ 8 ] . In addition to a cardiac consult, a neurologist may be asked to evaluate headaches or dizziness. A gastroenterology consultation may be requested if abdominal pain and nausea are present. Blood tests for serum electrolytes, a complete blood count, liver and thyroid functions, a celiac panel, and vitamin B 12 are generally normal, but may be useful to rule out other conditions that cause dizziness, fatigue, and gastrointestinal symptoms.",

Patients may complain of symptoms throughout the tilt test, but do not faint.

For POTS, there is an early and sustained increase in heart rate and a slight increase in blood pressure with tilt.

A 4-week trial of long-acting propranolol decreased standing HR without improving the quality of life [ 28 ] . Central sympatholytics (e.g., clonidine and methyldopa) can decrease the sympathetic nervous system tone, but need to be used carefully to avoid undesirable side effects such as drowsiness and worsening of the mental clouding [ 9 ] . Pyridostigmine can also restrain HR in POTS [ 46 ] . It inhibits acetylcholinesterase and raises parasympathetic tone by increasing the availability of acetylcholine at both the autonomic ganglia and the peripheral muscarinic receptors. It has led to long-term symptom improvement in approximately 50 % of patients with POTS, though increased gut motility may lead to discontinuation in 20 % of patients [ 47 ] .",

Presyncopal symptoms in VVS may resemble those in POTS, but their appearance is delayed in VVS (often for several minutes after standing), and they are associated with an abrupt fall in BP and HR. Exercise training is an important therapeutic strategy in POTS. Pharmacological treatments are second-line approaches that often target specifi c pathophysiological features.",
