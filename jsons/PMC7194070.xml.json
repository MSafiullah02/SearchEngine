COPD is a major smoking-associated lung disease characterized by chronic respiratory symptoms, progressive airflow limitation and frequent exacerbations (Barnes, 2016). The diagnosis of COPD is based on the Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) strategy assessing the presence of airflow limitation using spirometry (post-bronchodilator forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) to forced vital capacity (FVC) ratio of <0.7 without significant reversibility). The management of COPD mostly relies on the use of bronchodilators and corticosteroids (Johns, et al., 2014, Ruppel, et al., 2018).",

Increased production of oxidants and inflammatory cytokines produced by various inflammatory cells such as neutrophils, macrophages, CD4+ and CD8 + T cells contribute to the COPD pathogenesis. Recent evidence also suggests the presence of eosinophilic inflammation in COPD patients experiencing exacerbations (Singh, et al., 2018, Selvarajah, et al., 2016). The presence of systemic inflammation evidenced by the presence of several circulating inflammatory markers has been associated with extra-pulmonary manifestations of the disease (Tzortzaki, et al., 2006, Shaw, et al., 2014). Interestingly, accumulating evidence suggests that the IL-6/nitric oxide (NO) axis may play a pivotal role in the regulation of both local and systemic inflammatory mechanisms, thus representing potential therapeutic targets for COPD management/treatment (Cazzola, et al., 2007, Wei, et al., 2015, Rosenberg and Kalhan, 2012).",

IL-6 has been implicated in the regulation of CD4+ T cell-mediated response including secretion of cytokines, production of inflammatory proteins (CRP, fibrinogen) and iNOS expression (Del Giudice and Gangestad, 2018, Agusti, et al., 1999, Tanaka, et al., 2014). These mediators, in turn, have been associated with lung damage through their modulatory effects on mucus production, matrix deposition, and proteases release from granulocytes (Rincon and Irvin, 2012), all of which have been linked to the physiopathology and severity of COPD. Some studies indicated that patients with stable COPD had higher serum IL-6 concentrations than healthy controls while the association between IL-6 concentrations and the severity of pulmonary function impairment is still controversial (Wei, et al., 2015).",

NO can impact lung function via multiple mechanisms including its ability to regulate bronchodilation and/or vasodilation (Stefanska, et al., 2012, Seimetz, et al., 2011, Lundberg, et al., 2008). NO released from cells rapidly auto-oxidizes to yield NO2- and NO3- (nitrates and nitrites respectively, termed NOx), and NOx concentration in the blood has been used in patients as an indicator of endogenous formation of NO and to assess its relationship with disease status (Ignarro, et al., 1999, Rhodes, et al., 1995). The increased production of nitric oxide (NO) seen in COPD patients was tested by looking at the expression of neuronal and inducible isoforms of NO synthase (nNOS and iNOS). iNOS was increased in the peripheral lung tissues of COPD patients and negatively correlated with airflow obstruction (Brindicci, et al., 2010). In addition, both eNOS and iNOS were shown to be significantly up-regulated in the bronchial submucosa of COPD patients (Ricciardolo, et al., 2005). The pathological role of NO resides in its ability to impair many cellular processes and/or enhance inflammatory reactions via the nitration of protein tyrosine residues consequently leading to damage to DNA, lipids, and carbohydrates (Barnes, 2009).",

The nicotinic receptors were found to be expressed on different lung tissues including the epithelial cells (Gwilt, et al., 2007, Lam, et al., 2016), lung fibroblasts (Vicary, et al., 2017), as well as various immune cells involved in COPD such as neutrophils (Safronova, et al., 2016) and alveolar macrophages (Wang, et al., 2019). This non-neuronal ACh has the potential to contribute to COPD pathogenesis (Paleari, et al., 2008) as several reports now suggest that activators of the nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAchR) exert immunomodulatory action in immune cells. Nicotine, for example, has been shown to inhibit the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines from macrophages and lymphocytes cells via the activation of the \u03b17nAChR (Wang, et al., 2003). GTS-21, a selective agonist of the \u03b17nAChR, has also demonstrated immunomodulatory and anti-inflammatory effects in RAW 264.7 cells (Yue, et al., 2015). Further animal studies using GTS-21 and other selective receptor agonists (PNU-282,987), or performed in receptor knockout animals have confirmed the anti-inflammatory role of \u03b17nAChR in disease states such as LPS-induced animal septic model (Wang, et al., 2019) or lung injury induced by acid or sepsis (Su, et al., 2007).",

We show that levels of both mediators were increased in the serum of COPD patients and correlated with impaired lung function. In addition, production of IL-6 and NO by peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) was significantly increased in COPD patients when compared healthy controls. GTS-21 strongly suppressed the production of both IL-6 and NO in PBMCs. We suggest that activation of \u03b17nAChR on PBMCs can suppress the production of circulating inflammatory markers known to be associated with COPD pathogenesis.",

COPD was defined according to the GOLD criteria. COPD was diagnosed when the post-bronchodilator FEV1/FVC (forced vital capacity) ratio was less than 70% (GOLD stages). The GOLD expert panel classified COPD into four stages, ranging from A to D according to lung obstruction and other clinical symptoms (0: at risk; A: mild; B: Mild; C: moderate; D: severe). The healthy subjects group had a normal lung function and no prior history of respiratory conditions (asthma or tuberculosis). All subjects who were receiving systemic corticosteroids (oral or intravenous injection therapy) within the four weeks before the study for the exacerbation patients or three months for the stable one were excluded.

PBMCs were isolated by Ficoll gradient centrifugation according to the instructions of the manufacturer (Sigma Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) from n = 21 subjects. Briefly, after centrifugation (2800 rpm, 15 min), PBMCs were collected from the interface and washed twice with sterile phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). Cells were suspended in RPMI-1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (FCS), 100 U/ml penicillin, and 100 g/ml streptomycin (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO). Immediately after PBMCs isolation, the PBMCs viability was confirmed using Trypan blue dye exclusion test (>95% viability). The number of cells was adjusted to 106 cells per well (200 \u00b5L) and seeded in duplicate in 96-well flat-bottom plates (Greiner, Alphen a/d Rijn, The Netherlands) and incubated for 24 h at 37 \u00b0C, 95% O2, 5% CO2 with LPS (100 ng/ml) or GTS-21 dihydrochloride (10 \u00b5mol/l prepared from 10 mM stock in deionized water). GTS-21 was purchased from Sigma Aldrich (St. Louis, MO). In another set of experiments, PBMCs were LPS pre-treated for 4 hours before being incubated with GTS-21, at the same previous concentration.

Fig. 4\ncompared the basal levels of IL-6 and NO produced by PBMCs from SCOPD, ECOPD, and healthy subjects (HS). These data first demonstrated that basal levels of both IL-6 and NO were significantly higher in COPD patients when compared to that seen in HS subjects. IL-6 levels increased from 250.70 \u00b1 56.12 ng/ml in healthy subjects to 1911 \u00b1 191.5 and 3268 \u00b1 467 ng/ml in SCOPD and ECOPD, respectively (***P < 0.001, Fig.4A). Nitrite levels increased from 18.17 \u00b1 1.97 \u03bcM in healthy subjects to 36.10 \u00b1 3.45 and 55.8 \u00b1 2.57 \u03bcM in SCOPD and ECOPD, respectively (**P < 0.01, ***P < 0.001, Fig.4B). The presence of GTS-21 (10 \u03bcM) did reduce basal levels of IL-6 by 44% and 0.47% in SCOPD and ECOPD (***P < 0.001, Fig.4A). Interestingly, GTS-21 had a greater inhibitory effect on NO at basal levels in the PBMCs of either SCOPD or ECOPD which were completely abrogated by the \u03b17nAChR agonist (***P < 0.001, Fig.4B). Fig. 5\nshows the impact of GTS-21 on the levels of IL-6 and NO induced by LPS. LPS was found to induce greater levels of IL-6 and NO in both SCOPD and ECOPD when compared to that seen in healthy controls. LPS-induced IL-6 levels increased from 1356 \u00b1 135.7 ng/ml in healthy subjects to 4022 \u00b1 200.6 and 4540 \u00b1 297.1 ng/ml in SCOPD and ECOPD, respectively (***P < 0.001, Fig.5A). LPS-induced nitrite levels were quite similar between healthy subjects and SCOPD (44 \u00b1 6.72 vs 46.1 \u00b1 3.63 \u03bcM, NS) but were increased to 70.4 \u00b1 3.89 \u03bcM in ECOPD (**P < 0.01, Fig.5B). Levels of IL-6 release by LPS were found to be not different between SCOPD and ECOPD (Fig.5B) while production of NO was significantly increased in ECOPD group when compared to SCOPD (**P < 0.01, Fig.5B). Interestingly, GTS-21 strongly suppressed IL-6 and NO production induced by LPS stimulation in healthy subjects and COPD patients irrespective of disease status (SCOPD and ECOPD) (Fig.5\nA-B). While production of IL-6 by LPS was completed inhibited by GTS-21 in healthy subjects, GTS-21 did reduced IL-6 responses by 54% and 48% in SCOPD and ECOPD, respectively (***P < 0.001, Fig.5B). GTS-21 suppressed the production of nitrites by LPS by 55%, 62% and 68% in healthy subjects, SCOPD and ECOPD, respectively (***P < 0.001, Fig.5B). These findings suggest that GTS-21 exhibits anti-inflammatory actions by suppressing IL-6 and NO production in both basal and LPS-stimulated PBMCs from COPD patients. It was interesting to note that basal levels of both IL-6 and NO in the supernatants of PBMCs were not affected by GTS-21 in healthy subjects.",

These patients were steroid-na\u00efve at the time of blood sample collection (for at least 1 month in ECOPD and 3 months in SCOPD). A previous systematic review showed that among most biomarkers investigated, CRP was the one consistently increased in ECOPD, while levels of IL-6 or other cytokines such as TNF\u3008were shown to be also increased but with variable and statistical significance (Chen et al., 2016). We here found that plasmatic levels of IL-6 and CRP were markedly increased during exacerbations (ECOPD) when compared to levels seen in patients with stable COPD (SCOPD) (\u223c3-4 fold for IL-6/CRP). Similar results could be seen in cohort of Chinese ECOPD when compared to patients in remission which reported similar levels of CRP (\u223c30-32 mg/ml) but quite higher levels of IL-6 detected at \u03bcg/ml range (Lin, et al., 2019). Our study also demonstrated that levels of plasmatic NO were higher in COPD patients compared to healthy controls (data not shown) which were further increased by 2.16-fold in the exacerbation group when compared to stable patients. Only few studies have demonstrated that NO metabolites (nitrites and nitrates), when measured in the serum, were increased in COPD patients (Garcia-Rio, et al., 2010) or during COPD exacerbation when compared to levels seen in the stable group (Karadag, et al., 2008). Other studies reported increased levels of exhaled NO in hospitalized patients during an exacerbation of COPD (Agusti, et al., 1999). Nonetheless, controversies still exist regarding the use of NO measurement in the management of COPD since not all studies have reported similar NO changes in COPD patients during exacerbation (Csoma, et al., 2019, Ricciardolo, et al., 2004). Various factors could affect the production of these inflammatory markers in ECOPD such as the cause of exacerbations, the underlying inflammatory profile (presence of eosinophils), corticosteroid therapy, and whether these markers were measured in the blood or in the exhaled breath condensate. Nonetheless, our finding has raised the possibility that measuring these inflammatory markers in our cohort of patients could serve as biomarkers of COPD exacerbations, although a larger sample size would be required to further test this possibility.",

We first found positive correlations between levels of IL-6 and that of CRP or NO in agreement with previous studies linking IL-6 to other inflammatory mediators in COPD including CRP (Garcia-Rio, et al., 2010, Heinrich, et al., 1990, Kolsum, et al., 2009). The ability of IL-6 to induce NO production and iNOS expression has been recently demonstrated in PBMCs of patients with rheumatoid arthritis (Arroul-Lammali, et al., 2017) and in femoris muscles in COPD patients (Agusti, 2005). We also found negative correlations between FEV1 (% predicted) values and plasmatic levels of NO and IL-6 (r=-0.532 and r=-0.427, respectively), reinforcing the concept that systemic inflammation drives airflow obstruction in COPD patients. It was interesting to note that whether patients were in stable or exacerbation states did not affect the correlations between NO or IL-6 and airflow limitation (data not shown). Our observation is in part in agreement with previous reports showing that high IL-6 levels, measured either in serum or sputum samples, were associated with impaired lung function or a rapid lung function decline (Garcia-Rio, et al., 2010, Donaldson, et al., 2005, Yende, et al., 2006). Furthermore, IL-6 levels in the sputum were also reported to be present in frequent COPD exacerbators (Koutsokera, et al., 2013). A systematic review and meta-analysis investigating 33 studies reported higher levels of serum IL-6 in stable COPD vs healthy control but failed to see any association with pulmonary lung function. However, the authors did acknowledge that failing to adjust for a number of confounding factors could have influenced the results (Wei, et al., 2015).",

            "text": "The strong correlations observed between levels of nitrites and IL-6 found in the plasma of patients and the supernatants of their cultured PBMCs (r = 0.87, P < 0.0001 and r = 0.79, P < 0.0004, respectively), strongly suggests that PBMCs act as the primary source of such inflammatory mediators in the circulation in COPD. Targeting the pro-inflammatory pathways in PBMCs may represent a promising therapeutic option for the treatment of COPD considering the limited clinical efficacy of corticosteroids and their strong side effects (Ernst, et al., 2015). We here provide the first evidence that GTS-21, a selective \u03b17 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (\u03b17nAChR) expressed in neurons and immune cells (Wang, et al., 2003), can significantly suppress basal and inducible levels of IL-6 and NO in SCOPD and ECOPD patients with no notable effect on basal levels produced in healthy controls. This highly suggests the activation of pro-inflammatory pathways in the immune cells of COPD patients are sensitive to GTS-21. Prior studies also observed that similar concentrations of GTS-21 (\u03bcM range) inhibited production of different inflammatory mediators induced by LPS such as IL-6, IL1-\u00df, and TNF\u03b1 by RAW264.7 cells (Yue, et al., 2015), TNF\u03b1 by peritoneal mice macrophages (Khan, et al., 2012, Garg and Loring, 2019), or microglia (Thomsen and Mikkelsen, 2012). Interestingly, GTS-21 did suppress production of TNF\u03b1 or IL-1\u00ae but did not affect inducible levels of IL-6 in human PBMCs treated with LPS (Kox, et al., 2009), somewhat contrasting with the profound effect of GTS-21 on IL-6 production seen in our healthy controls (Fig.4). Because little information was provided about the demographics of the healthy controls used in their study (Kox, et al., 2009), it was difficult to speculate about the reasons for such discrepancy. Other studies have confirmed that GTS-21 can inhibit the production of inflammatory mediators in response to various stimuli (i.e., ligands for TLR2, TLR3, TLR4, TLR9, and RAGE) in human monocytes (Ro) or in mast cells (Rosas-Ballina, et al., 2009, Guzman-Mejia, et al., 2018), further supporting the therapeutic value of GTS-21 in human inflammatory diseases including COPD. The molecular mechanisms by which GTS-21 exerts its anti-inflammatory actions in immune cells has been attributed to the inhibition of the NF-\u03baB pathway (Yoshikawa, et al., 2006), activation of JAK/STAT pathway (Zoheir, et al., 2012) or increased levels of intracellular cAMP (Andersson and Tracey, 2012). Because GTS-21 (i.e., DMXB-A) appears to be safe in humans and is currently being tested for various neurological conditions (Hilderman, et al., 2015, Freedman, et al., 2008), we believe that GTS-21 and other selective agonists could represent novel anti-inflammatory options to treat COPD. Whether GTS-21 could be used in the treatment of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) due to its ability to suppress IL-6 production by inflammatory cells remains an interesting hypothesis to be tested considering the central role of IL-6 in the regulation of the cytokine release syndrome (CRS) (Liu, et al., 2020). A number of clinical trials testing IL-6 blockade in COVID-19 patients with severe respiratory problems are currently underway.",
