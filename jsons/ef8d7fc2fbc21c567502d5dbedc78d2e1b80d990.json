Recent advances in next generation sequencing technologies enable rapid 26 generation of pathogen genome sequence data, within 24 hours of obtaining a sample in some 27 instances. With these data, one can quickly evaluate the effectiveness of existing diagnostics and 28 therapeutics using in silico approaches. The propensity of some viruses to rapidly accumulate 29 mutations can lead to the failure of molecular detection assays creating the need for redesigned 30 or newly designed assays.",

Only two met our in 37 silico criteria for successful detection and neither had perfect matches to the primer/probe 38 sequences. We designed five new primer sets against BOMV signatures and all had true positive 39 hits to the three BOMV genomes and no false positive hits to any other sequence.

The release of WGS allowed us to test the BioLaboro pipeline (described in this study) to 137 evaluate currently used diagnostic assays and to rapidly design new assays. 138 In a previous study, we described a bioinformatics tool called PSET (PCR signature 139 erosion tool) and used it to show in silico, confirmed with wet lab work, the effectiveness of 140 existing Ebolavirus diagnostic assays against a large number of sequences available at that time 141 [32]. The phrase \"signature erosion\" used here signifies potential false-positive or false-negative 142 results in PCR assays due to mutations in the primers, probe, or amplicon target sequences (PCR 143 signatures). Signature erosion could also mean failure of medical countermeasures; for example, 144 a change in the genomic sequence resulting in an amino acid change that could potentially alter 145 the efficacy of sequence-based therapeutics [33, 34] . 146 In this study, we describe an expanded bioinformatics pipeline called BioLaboro in which 147 we have integrated several tools: BioVelocity\u00ae, Primer3 and PSET for end-to-end analysis of 148 outbreak pathogen genome sequences to evaluate existing PCR assay efficacy against the new 149 sequences, and to identify unique signature regions (BioVelocity), design PCR assays to these ",

            "text": "BioLaboro architecture 158 BioLaboro is comprised of three algorithms -BioVelocity, Primer3, and PSET -which 159 are built into a pipeline for user-friendly applications. The user has the option to launch one of 160 four different job types: Signature Discovery, Score Assay Targets, Validate Assay, or New 161 Assay Discovery. Each of the three algorithms can be run individually or together as a complete 162 end-to-end pipeline (Figure 1 ). For the BOMV use case, in the first phase of the pipeline 163 BioVelocity was used to analyze a set of genome sequences for unique regions that are both 164 conserved and signature to the target sequences selected. This was achieved by splitting a chosen 165 representative whole genome sequence into sliding 50 base pairs (bps) k-mers. Each k-mer was 166 then scanned against all target sequences to determine conservation. Conserved k-mers were then 167 elongated based on overlaps and formed into contigs. These contigs were then split into k-mers \u2264 168 250 bps and scanned against all non-target sequences to determine specificity. All passing 169 sequences were then elongated based on overlaps and the signature contigs were passed to the 170 next step in the pipeline. Primer3 was then used to evaluate the signature contigs to identify 171 suitable primers and probes for assay development. Primer3 was run in parallel against all 172 signatures and the output was ranked by penalty score in ascending order. The top five best 173 primer sets were passed along to the final step in the pipeline, PSET. In this step the primer sets 174 were run through a bioinformatics pipeline which aligned the sequences against large public 175 sequence databases from NCBI using BLAST and GLSEARCH [36] to determine how well each assay correctly aligned to all target sequences while excluding off-target hits. 199 Even the two assays that passed in silico criteria did not have perfect matches raising the 200 possibility that these assays may fail in wet lab testing due to mismatches against currently 201 available BOMV genomic sequences. Hence, as described below, we designed new assays using 202 the BioLaboro platform.",

In the first phase, 280 BioVelocity was used to search for conserved and signature regions within the selected genomes.281 Ninety six complete SARS-CoV-2 whole genome sequences were downloaded from the GISAID 282 and uploaded to BioLaboro as a custom database. These 96 genomes were used as our reference 283 set and EPI_ISL_404253 (Genbank ID: MN988713.1) was used as the algorithmic reference sequence. The algorithmic reference sequence was first split into k-mers of 50 bps each using a 285 sliding window of 1 bp, which amounted to 29,833 k-mers to be evaluated with the conserved 286 sequence detection algorithm. BioVelocity found 79% (23,542) of these k-mers to be conserved 287 in all 96 of the SARS-CoV-2 genomes. The conserved k-mers were then evaluated to determine 288 overlapping segments and were combined into 96 conserved contigs.

The contigs were split into 290 signatures with a max size of 250 bps (longer contigs were split into 250 k-mers with a step size 291 of 1). The conserved k-mer sequences were evaluated against 563,941 complete genomes and 292 plasmids from the NCBI GenBank repository. There were 11,152 sequences found to be 293 signature to SARS-CoV-2.

These data add to the body of evidence suggesting that bats are a 362 reservoir for filoviruses. However, these did not conclusively link the presence of viral RNA in 363 bats to human infections with filoviruses. The discovery of BOMV in bats residing near and in 364 human dwellings and residential areas further highlights the gaps in knowledge about ebolavirus diversity and ecology. Given these gaps and the human and economic impacts of ebolavirus 366 disease, there is an ongoing need for ebolavirus biosurveillance and further characterization of 367 BOMV. Availability of efficient viral RNA detection assays is critical for bio surveillance of 368 these reservoirs. 369 Based on in silico analyses, we determined that current EBOV assays could potentially 370 fail to detect BOMV sequences, and thus there is a need for BOMV specific assays. Using 371 BioLaboro we rapidly designed and evaluated new, more specific assays. An advantage of 372 BioVelocity is that the end user obtains results quickly with high confidence that the output of 373 conserved and unique signature regions are accurate and not based on heuristics and 374 probabilities. Additionally, Primer3 allows an end user to determine which signatures yield the 375 best primers and probes, based on an objective penalty scoring system.

The dedicated large RAM 381 system easily supports multiple users with discrete logins and rapid operations. Moreover, the 382 user-friendly GUI allows scientists without command-line experience to design and evaluate an 383 assay for immediate wet lab testing.384Due to the relative novelty of BOMV there are currently only three complete genomes 385 available from NCBI. As more samples are identified and sequenced the genetic diversity will 386 likely increase. During the 2014 -2016 Western African EBOV outbreak, rapid accumulation of 387 inter-and intra-host genetic variations were observed[43]. Since many of the nucleotide mutations altered protein sequences, it became apparent that the changes should be monitored for 389 impacts on diagnostics, vaccines, and therapies critical to outbreak response. In an earlier study 390 conducted to decipher the impact of the then-available diagnostics, we determined that many of 391 the real-time reverse transcription PCR (rRT-PCR) assays that were in use during that outbreak392 identified regions outside of those that BioVelocity selected as unique to EBOV, SUDV, and 393 RESTV [32]. In another study, signature erosion of diagnostic assays was identified during the 394 2018 outbreak in North Kivu and Ituri Provinces of the Democratic Republic of the Congo [44].395Using the in silico methods described here, only two of the 30 EBOV rRT-PCR assays evaluated 396 against BOMV target sequences met our criteria for successful detection and neither showed 397 perfect matches. For ongoing biosurveillance, we recommend wet lab testing and validation of 398 the rRT-PCR assays described here to ensure detection of BOMV.399    We also tested the BioLaboro pipeline with available SARS-CoV-2 viral genomes and400 rRT-PCR assays. We identified five signature sequences distributed across the genome and in 401 different regions than those of the CDC or German group [39, 40]. There are seven assays 402 currently in use (3 CDC and 4 German) for SARS-CoV-2 diagnostics and they all produced true 403 positive results against the human-derived sample sequences without any signs of signature 404 erosion. A few whole genome sequences that showed false negative results were from 405 environmental samples (Bat and Pangolin origin) indicating that the diagnostic assays are 406 specific for human isolates. The assays that produced true positive results were pan assays. The 407 lack of signature erosion is in agreement with the whole genome sequence data analyzed thus far 408 (February 28, 2020). A simple pipeline consisting of Multiple Sequence Alignment using Fast 409 Fourier Transform (MAFFT), snp-sites, and R we calculated 228 single nucleotide 410 polymorphisms (SNPs) (159 unique) across 145 genomes [45-47]. Each of the 145 WGS contains less than 10 SNPs with the exception of one having 25. None of the variations impact 412 the diagnostic assay signatures. However, real-time monitoring of these assays against WGS as 413 they become available, will enable rapid identification of signature erosion if it occurs and 414 generation of new assays as needed. The newly designed assays we have described here need to 415 be validated in wet lab testing and with appropriate clinical matrices to determine their 416 performance. However, we have demonstrated that the BioLaboro pipeline can be used 417 effectively and rapidly to validate available assays and to design new assays using genome 418 sequences of newly emerging pathogens. 419 Conclusions 420 By periodically re-running BioLaboro on emerging and reemerging pathogen sequences 421 as they become available, over time the relative diversity can be monitored, and assays can be 422 updated to remain current with regards to available data. By tracking assay performance 423 measures over time, one can evaluate the efficacy of MCMs on a routine basis. These analyses 424 would ensure that the most accurate MCMs are available when an outbreak response is 425 necessary. In this study we demonstrate the value of real-time genomic sequencing and MCM 426 evaluation to provide actionable information before and during a public health emergency. 427 Combined with an active biosurveillance of zoonotic reservoirs and generation of sequence data 428 to understand the genetic diversity of these pathogens, BioLaboro is broadly applicable for 429 providing effective diagnostics and medical countermeasures during a crisis involving future an application for rapidly designing de novo assays and validating existing 436 PCR detection assays. It is composed of three tools: BioVelocity, Primer3, and PSET which are 437 built into a pipeline for user-friendly new assay discovery via an interactive graphic user 438 interface. 439 BioVelocity is a bioinformatics tool based on an innovative algorithm and approach to 440 genomic reference indices [32]. Using a fast and accurate hashing algorithm, BioVelocity can 441 quickly align reads to a large set of references. BioVelocity takes advantage of large RAM 442 systems (hardware specification described in AdditionalTable 1) and creates a k-mer index of all 443 selected reference sequences (e.g. GenBank) by identifying all possible base pair sequences of 444 various k-mer lengths. This index is used to determine all possible matches between query 445 sequences and references, simultaneously. The advantage of this approach is that it allows for 446 rapid identification of sequences conserved within or omitted from a set of target references.447Thus, the used has high confidence in the conserved and signature (unique) designations because 448 they are not based on heuristics and probabilities.",

It450 considers a range of criteria such as oligonucleotide melting temperature, size, GC content, and 451 primer-dimer possibilities. Potential new primer sets are identified within the signature regions 452 using Primer3 analysis. For the BioLaboro pipeline, Primer3 has been configured to analyze 22 453 parameters influencing suitability of a sequence to primer creation and construct viable primers 454 which cover identified signature regions. These primers are scored with a penalty scoring system to attempt to determine the fitness of the resulting primers thus allowing an end user to 456 assess which signatures yield the best primers when the signatures themselves may be of 457 similar size. 458 PSET is configured to test PCR assays in silico against the latest versions of public 459 sequence repositories to determine if the primers and probes still match only to their intended 460 targets. An elaborate description of PSET is provided in ref [32]. As NCBI's database and other 461 public databases are updated periodically, newly added genomic sequences can reveal where 462 primers and probes may no longer be functional or where PCR assays may detect previously 463 un-sequenced near neighbors. Using this information, an assay provider can be better aware of 464 potential false hits and design new primers when false hits become an issue. PSET is used to 465 test currently deployed assays as well as new assays designed using BioLaboro's capabilities. 466 The BioLaboro application is composed of a fully functional GUI front-end that allows 467 users to submit jobs to the back-end bioinformatics pipeline hosted on a dedicated large RAM 468 system.

The 469 landing screen, shown in Figure 4, gives the user options for submitting a new job, viewing the 470 current job queue, checking results from previously completed jobs, and exploring the system 471 database management and settings. The landing page of BioLaboro. The BioLaboro application allows job submissions through a simplified user interface 475 designed for scientists with minimal or no command-line experience. The user can search for 476 sequences of interest using the built-in Organism Select tool, Figure 5, which allows for 477 searching on free text, NCBI Accession number, or NCBI Taxonomy ID. The results can then be 478 filtered using a \"smart filter\" which will only include sequences within +/-10% of the calculated 479 median genome length of the results. This tool is useful for automatically excluding plasmids or 480 sequence fragments which can negatively impact signature identification. Alternatively, custom 481 sequence size filters can also be used if the user wants to target specific plasmids or 482 chromosomes. Once all sequences are selected and added the user can optionally choose a 483 specific sequence to serve as the algorithmic reference.",

Given the sequence diversity, we assessed if the current diagnostic assays 184 were effective against BOMV. We compared the current Ebola assay signatures against the three 185 available complete genome sequences of BOMV (NCBI Accession numbers: MF319185.1, MF319186.1, and MK340750.1). Of the 30 Ebola assays examined (assay details in reference 187 [32]), only two met our in silico criteria for successful detection (90% identity over 90% of the 188 length for all primers and probe sequences in the amplicon). Of the two assays that did meet detection criteria for BOMV, neither had perfect matches to the primer sequences. The primer set 190 match percentages (the average identity of all primers/probes) for all 30 Ebola assays against the 191 three BOMV complete genomes are shown in the heat map(Table 1). The two assays which pass 192 the in silico criteria are shown in green while the matches in red indicate failure or no alignment. Heat map of PSET results of Ebola assays against BOMV sequencesTable 1Legend: The average primer set percent identity matches for thirty current Ebola assays tested against the three BOMV genomes. Cells in green have an average primer identity over 90% which indicates likely primer binding while red cells have below 90% average identity or 198 no alignment at all, indicating likely primer binding failure.",
