We found that Pidotimod treatment did not influence the number of B, T and NK cells in the peripheral blood, but improved the survival and function of B cells in vitro. Ex vivo stimulation with CpG measures the ability of B cells to react to TLR9 [24]. In response to CpG, memory B cells proliferate and differentiate into antibody producing cells. Whereas switched memory B cells produce IgG and IgA, IgM memory B cells secrete IgM. We showed that, after Pitodimod treatment, B cells increased in numbers, proliferated more and secreted higher amounts of IgM antibodies, whereas the concentration of IgG and IgA remained stable. Thus, the function of IgM memory B cell is significantly potentiated after Pitodimod treatment. The increased activity of IgM memory B cells in vitro may reflect an improved activity in vivo resulting in a more effective first-line protection and reduction of infection episodes in vivo. Further studies are necessary to evaluate whether Pidotimod may improve the response of other cell types to TLR ligands and re-enforce innate immune defenses, thus explaining the clinical effects of the treatment.",
