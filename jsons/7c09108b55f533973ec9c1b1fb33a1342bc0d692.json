These considerably significant data represents one represents one of the greatest problems of scientific novelties, especially in the case of pandemics like the one we are experiencing: the lack of scientific consensus. Generating this number of studies brings with it a considerable amount of confusion, making the stratum of society that does not have the tools to identify scientific characteristics or critical reading ability especially vulnerable.",

Although we do not J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f have a much more efficient selection method that implies \"scientific quality\", 2 in some cases, the appearance of preprints, early versions of a study, help speed up this process. The benefits of having scientific results before they go through peer review are not in discussion. But what happens with people that are not used to distinguishing between a preprint and a consolidated paper? Great part of the society, even a science-educated society, is taking results published in preprint databases as scientific facts.",

Editors are required more and more publications, imposing culture in the scientific world of \"publish or die\". On the other hand, because a retraction is often considered an indication of wrongdoing, many researchers are understandably sensitive when one of their papers is questioned. That stigma, however, might be leading to practices that undermine efforts to protect the integrity of the scientific literature. 4 All this situation, together with the climate of concern experienced by society, can lead to the use of preprints as a throwing weapon in argumentation, where social networks and the media represent the common thread of this set of opinions and emotions. Although they could represent an advance and improvement, putting themselves at the service of scientific publication, it can be a double-edged sword generating a state of \"misinformation\". Twitter, for example, is a social network that attracts the attention of scientists for its potential to improve its prestige and the scope of its work. 5 Despite the service's efforts to control the quality of information, the network has become a sink for confusing and not very rigorous information. This is a problem because it sometimes blurs the line between what are scientific facts and what are untested hypotheses.",
