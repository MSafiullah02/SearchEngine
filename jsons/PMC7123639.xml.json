The process of crossing the host species barrier can be divided into four phases (Fig. 1): interspecies host-host contact between donor species and recipient species; pathogen-host interactions within an individual host of the recipient species, allowing replication and shedding of the pathogen; intraspecies host-host contact in the recipient species, allowing pathogen spread; and persistence in the recipient species population even during epidemic troughs [3].\n",

Two influenza viruses that successfully spread from animals to humans are HPAI H5N1 virus, originating from poultry, and pandemic H1N1 influenza (H1N1) virus, thought to originate from domestic swine. However, these two influenza viruses differ in a critical aspect: their human-to-human transmissibility. Between 1997 and 2010, HPAI H5N1 virus has caused 507 documented infections in humans, of whom 302 have died (www.who.int/csr/disease/avian_influenza/country/cases_table_2010_10_18/en/index.html), but is not transmitted efficiently among humans [5]. In contrast, human-to-human transmission of pH1N1 virus is efficient: within months of the emergence of pH1N1 virus in Mexico at the beginning of 2009, it had been reported world-wide, resulting in the first human influenza pandemic of the twenty-first century.",

We used a technique which we coined \u201cvirus histochemistry\u201d: we incubated formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue sections with formalin-inactivated fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-labeled influenza virus and detected virus with a peroxidase-labeled rabbit antibody to FITC that was amplified with a tyramide signal amplification system [7].",

This child presented with severe diarrhea but no apparent respiratory illness, followed by rapidly progressive coma, leading to a clinical diagnosis of acute encephalitis. HPAI H5N1 virus was isolated from cerebrospinal fluid, fecal, throat, and serum specimens. The sibling of this child died of a similar illness, although the lack of clinical specimens did not allow diagnosis. Separately, another patient with HPAI H5N1 virus was described with an initial presentation of fever and diarrhea alone [10]. These cases emphasize that clinical surveillance of HPAI H5N1 virus infections should focus not only on respiratory illnesses, but also on clusters of unexplained deaths or severe illnesses of any kind [9].",

At necropsy of these animals, evidence for lesions associated with HPAI H5N1 virus infection were found not only in the lungs but also in multiple extra-respiratory organs, including brain and liver [11]. In order to examine the extra-respiratory spread of HPAI H5N1 virus infection in \u00admammals more carefully, we experimentally infected domestic cats with HPAI H5N1 virus and examined them by virological and pathological assays 7 days after inoculation [12, 13]. Severe necrosis and inflammation were present in lungs, brain, heart, kidneys, liver, and adrenal glands (Fig. 4). The presence of these pathological changes co-localized with the expression of influenza virus antigen in parenchymal cells of these organs (Fig. 4). (Interestingly, experimental infections of domestic cats with other influenza viruses, HPAI H7N7 virus [14] or pH1N1 virus [15], did not extend beyond the respiratory tract.) This study demonstrates that HPAI H5N1 virus causes \u00adsystemic disease in domestic cats, with results corresponding in part to the findings of the above-described non-typical cases of fatal HPAI H5N1 virus infection in humans.\n",

            "text": "When pH1N1 virus emerged in Mexico early in 2009 and started spreading in humans across the world, there was major concern about the level of disease burden and mortality that it would cause. In order to assess the pathogenesis and pathogenicity of pH1N1 virus, we performed experimental infections in ferrets, which are considered one of the most suitable laboratory animal species to model influenza in humans. In these ferrets, we compared the within-host dynamics of pH1N1 virus with that of seasonal human H1N1 virus, which is well-adapted to its human host, and of HPAI H5N1 virus, which is known to cause a high case fatality rate in humans [16]. Our results showed seasonal human H1N1 virus and pH1N1 virus were restricted mainly to the respiratory tract, while HPAI H5N1 virus also replicated extensively in extra-respiratory tissues. Also, we found that the severity of pneumonia and cumulative mortality rate of ferrets infected with pH1N1 virus was intermediate between that for seasonal H1N1 virus and HPAI H5N1 virus infection. Interestingly, influenza virus antigen expression in the pH1N1 virus group was high at all 3 levels of the lower respiratory tract (alveoli, bronchioles, and bronchi) (Fig. 5). This was associated with histopathological changes of diffuse alveolar damage, bronchiolitis, and bronchitis, respectively (Fig. 5). This contrasted with the influenza virus antigen expression in the HPAI H5N1 virus group, which was highest in alveoli, and lower in bronchioles and bronchi; and with that in the seasonal H1N1 virus group, which was low at all three levels. The results of this study suggest that pH1N1 virus has the intrinsic ability to cause more severe pneumonia than seasonal H1N1 virus. This corresponds with the results of other experimental studies in mice, ferrets, and macaques [17\u201319].\n",

In that study, patients with fatal pH1N1 virus infection not only had diffuse alveolar damage associated with the presence of viral antigen in the alveoli, a pattern somewhat similar to patients with fatal HPAI H5N1 virus infection, but also had viral localization along with inflammation and other histopathological changes in trachea, bronchi, and bronchioles, a pattern more commonly seen in severe or fatal cases of seasonal influenza.",

We found that the seasonal human influenza viruses and pH1N1 virus attached abundantly to epithelial cells throughout the human URT. In contrast, the avian influenza viruses, including HPAI H5N1 virus, attached only rarely [24] (Fig. 6). These results indicate that the ability of an influenza virus to attach to human URT epithelium is a critical factor for efficient transmission in the human population.\n",

The human population is therefore permanently at risk of becoming infected with new variants of influenza virus from this animal reservoir. To contain and eradicate such infections requires not only strategic virus surveillance of both animal and human populations, but also a better understanding of the hurdles that a zoonotic influenza virus needs to jump over in order to cross the species barrier and cause a human pandemic. Advances in these two areas will allow us to better predict the risk of emergence of zoonotic influenza viruses in the human population.",

(c) Intraspecies host-host contact in recipient species must allow viral spread (R0  >  1) in the presence of any pre-existing immunity. Superspreader events (red asterisk) early in the transmission chain can help this process.
