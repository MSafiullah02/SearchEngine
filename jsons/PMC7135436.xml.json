The outbreak was first recognized in Guangdong Province, China in November 2002 [4]. The disease was unusual for its severity and patients suffering from this disease did not respond to empirical, antimicrobial treatment for acute, community-acquired typical or atypical pneumonia. The clinical syndromes of SARS are fever, shortness of breath, lymphopenia and rapidly progressing changes on radiography. At the end of this outbreak, a cumulative total of more than 8000 cases and 700 deaths have been reported [5]. The disease is highly infectious and >56% of health care workers caring for SARS patients have been infected [6]. A novel coronavirus (Cov) is identified to be the cause of this disease [1], [7], [8].",

Detection of the virus by RT-PCR in clinical specimens offers the option of diagnosis in the early stage of the disease. In this outbreak, we developed several conventional and real-time quantitative PCR assays for SARS diagnosis [1], [9], [10], [11]. Quantitative analysis of viral RNA in NPA specimens indicated that the viral loads at the early disease onset are low and peak at day 10 of the illness [15]. The presence of low copy numbers of a viral genome in early clinical samples is a major limiting factor for achieving a sensitive molecular test for SARS diagnosis. Recently, we demonstrated that this problem could be overcome by increasing the volume of clinical samples for RNA extraction. By using a modified RNA extraction method and applying quantitative real-time RT-PCR technologies, 80% of specimens collected at days 1\u20133 of the onset were positive in RT-PCR assays [10].",

Evidence of virus infection was also detected in a raccoon dog (Nyctereutes procyonoides), Chinese ferret badger (Melogale moschata) and in humans working in direct contact with these animals [16]. Phylogenetic analysis indicates that these animal viruses are highly similar to human SARS Cov [16].
