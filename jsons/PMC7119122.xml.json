Despite being common and potentially lethal, its importance is often underappreciated. Estimates of the incidence of CAP range from 4 to 5 million cases per year [3], [4]. Eighty percent of patients are treated as outpatients, and their mortality is less than 1%. The remaining 20% of patients require inpatient management, and the overall mortality is approximately 12%. Risk factors for CAP include advanced age, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, renal insufficiency, congestive heart failure, malignancy, diabetes, and alcoholism [5]. The etiologic organism in CAP is undetermined in 50% of cases [6]. Some of the more common organisms that cause CAP and the radiographic appearances are discussed below.",

Classically, it causes a lobar pattern of consolidation that is characterized by the initial development of a peripheral opacity that rapidly becomes confluent. Air- bronchograms are common. Inflammation occurs predominantly at the level of the alveolar sac when the organism is inhaled. There is alveolar spread and the inflammatory response spreads throughout the lung through small channels\u2014the canals of Lambert and the pores of Kohn. The spread of this process through collateral channels, rather than bronchioles, explains why this pattern of pneumonia often does not follow a segmental distribution. The infection easily crosses pulmonary segments and inflammation is limited by pleural boundaries. In addition to localized lobar consolidation, Streptococcus pneumoniae-associated pneumonia also has atypical appearances, such as bronchopneumonia or an interstitial pattern [2]. One study that investigated the radiographic appearances in 81 in-patients with culture-documented pneumococcal pneumonia demonstrated a lobar pattern of consolidation in 81% of the patients. Lobar consolidation was focal in 48% of patients and multifocal in 33%. A bronchopneumonia/lobular pattern of consolidation, often with peribronchial thickening, occurred in 19%. A bronchopneumonia pattern results when infections begin in bronchi and bronchioles and then extend into the contiguous airspace. It usually is patchy, multifocal, bilateral, heterogeneous, and nonconfluent. The radiographic pattern is not influenced by HIV status. Pleural effusions are uncommon, and in this study, were found in 11% of patients [Fig. 1, Fig. 2\n] [7].",

Focal areas of ground glass attenuation often were seen in association with these nodules [1], [10]. Another retrospective study by Tomiyama and colleagues [11], using CT imaging, demonstrated centrilobular nodules in a patchy distribution in 96% of 13 patients who had mycoplasma infections versus 61% of patients who had bacterial pneumonia. Among patients in this study, 88% of patients had airspace consolidation, 100% had areas of ground glass attenuation, and 69% had centrilobular branching \u201ctree-in-bud\u201d structures compared with 34% in bacterial pneumonia.

The exact etiology of pneumatoceles is unclear although a variety of mechanisms has been suggested, including check valve obstruction of small airways, pulmonary infarction, and production of proteases or elastases with lung digestion. Pneumatoceles may predispose to pneumothorax or pneumomediastinum [Fig. 17\n]. Atypical manifestations of PCP include focal consolidation, mass lesions, cavitation, and adenopathy [Fig. 18\n].

In most bacterial infections, mildly enlarged lymph nodes are seen frequently on CT imaging but usually not on CXR. Visibly enlarged nodes on CXR in HIV-positive patients with CD4 counts of less than 200 \u00d7 106 cells/L suggests TB. Pleural effusions are uncommon in patients who have PCP, but are seen more typically in patients who have pyogenic bacterial infections.",

This initial infection has been termed the \u201cGhon focus\u201d and usually heals by developing a fibrous capsule around the focus of infection which often calcifies. Organisms may spread through the lymphatics to hilar and mediastinal lymph nodes where a similar reaction occurs; the combination of lung and hilar infection is called the \u201cRanke complex.\u201d Usually, host defenses are sufficient to prevent overt infection.

Reactivation in these regions may be favored by high oxygen tension and tends to occur when host defenses become impaired. Latent organisms become active and overt infection develops. Unlike the healing that commonly occurs with primary Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) infection, postprimary TB infection is often associated with progressive disease. As inflammation mounts, tissue destruction occurs, caseous material liquefies, and communication with the tracheobronchial tissue can ensue. This produces cavitation, the characteristic pathologic and radiologic finding of postprimary MTB. Cavitation creates the opportunity for endobronchial spread of infection and communication to other individuals. If host defenses triumph, these cavities usually heal by scar formation with bronchiectasis, volume loss, and areas of emphysema. Chronic thin-walled cavities may persist. Typical clinical manifestations of postprimary TB include failure to thrive, fatigue, night sweats, weight loss, and low-grade fever. Bronchiectasis may result in hemoptysis [2].",

It is characterized at histologic analysis by the invasion and occlusion of small- to medium-sized pulmonary arteries by fungal hyphae that lead to the formation of necrotic hemorrhagic nodules or pleural-based, wedge-shaped, hemorrhagic infarcts [38]. CXRs often are abnormal, but nonspecific, and reveal patchy segmental or lobar consolidation or multiple, ill-defined nodular opacities. Characteristic CT findings consist of nodules that are surrounded by a halo of ground glass attenuation (\u201chalo sign\u201d) or pleural-based, wedge-shaped areas of consolidation. These findings correspond to hemorrhagic infarcts. In severely neutropenic patients, the halo sign is highly suggestive of angioinvasive aspergillosis; however, a similar appearance has been described in several other conditions, such as candida, mucor, herpes simplex, CMV, and Kaposi's sarcoma [Fig. 26\n] [39]. As the patient's immune system recovers, about 2 weeks after the onset of infection, CXR or CT may demonstrate an \u201cair crescent sign,\u201d corresponding to necrotic lung around retracted infarcted lung. Although this finding is not specific for angioinvasive aspergillosis, it is highly characteristic in the proper clinical setting, especially when the initial lesion is consolidation or a mass [38]. Air crescent formation was shown to be associated with improved survival [Fig. 27\n] [40].",
