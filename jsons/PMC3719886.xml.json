Even with the advent of laboratory automation and the integration of genomics and proteomics in microbiology, interpretation of results still depends on the quality of the specimens received for analysis. Prokaryotic microorganisms, while genetically less complex than multicellular eukaryotes, are uniquely suited to adapt to environments where antibiotics and host responses apply pressures that encourage their survival. A laboratory instrument may or may not detect those mutations, so a specialist in microbiology is needed to facilitate microbiology laboratory result interpretation. Clearly, all microbes grow, multiply, and die very quickly. If any of those events occur during specimen collection, transport, or storage, the results of analysis will be compromised and interpretation could be misleading. Therefore, attention to preanalytical specimen management in microbiology is critical to accuracy.",

Because result interpretation in microbiology depends entirely on the quality of the specimen submitted for analysis, specimen management cannot be left to chance, and those that collect specimens for microbiologic analysis must be aware of what the physician needs as well as what the laboratory needs, including ensuring that specimens arrive at the laboratory for analysis as quickly as possible after collection (Introduction-Table 1).\n",

The microbiology laboratory needs a specimen that has been appropriately selected, collected, and transported to the laboratory for analysis. Caught in the middle, between the physician and laboratory, are those who select and collect the specimen and who may not know or understand what the physician or the laboratory needs to do their work.

This document illustrates this partnership and emphasizes the importance of appropriate specimen management to clinical relevance of the results.

For the great majority of etiologic agents of BSIs, conventional blood culture methods provide results within 48 hours; incubation for more than 5 days seldom is required when modern automated continuous-monitoring blood culture systems and media are used [1, 2]. This includes recovery of historically fastidious organisms such as HACEK [1] (Haemophilus, Aggregatibacter, Cardiobacterium, Eikenella, and Kingella) bacteria and Brucella spp [3, 4]. Some microorganisms, such as mycobacteria and dimorphic fungi, require longer incubation periods; others may require special culture media or non-culture-based methods. Although filamentious fungi often require special broth media or lysis-centrifugation vials for detection, Candida spp tend to grow very well in standard blood culture broths unless the patient has been on antifungal therapy. Unfortunately, blood cultures from patients with suspected candidemia do not yield positive results in almost half of patients. Table I-1 below provides a summary of diagnostic methods for most BSIs.\n",

For adults, 20\u201330 mL of blood per culture set (depending on the manufacturer of the instrument) is recommended and may require more than 2 bottles depending on the system.

Specimen types include swabs of ulcers, corneal scrapings, biopsies, or anterior chamber or vitreous aspirates. The volume of specimens is always limited. This specimen limitation makes it necessary for the laboratory to prioritize procedures depending on what organisms are sought, and this should always be done after discussion with the ophthalmologist who collects the specimen and the infectious disease consultant when appropriate. This is particularly important because all major pathogen groups\u2014viruses, parasites, bacteria, mycobacteria, and fungi\u2014can cause ocular infection. Both epidemiology and clinical presentation are used to narrow the organism(s) sought and the laboratory tests requested. Because of the limited specimen size seen with scrapings and biopsies, the laboratory and ophthalmologist may agree to inoculate these specimens onto media and prepare smears at the bedside. In this case, the laboratory should supply the necessary media and slides to the ophthalmologist. If these supplies are stored in the clinic or operating suite for ready access by the surgeon, it is the laboratory's responsibility to assure that these materials are not outdated. Aspirates from the anterior chamber or vitreous are the optimal specimens for detection of anaerobic bacteria and viral agents; they can be submitted in syringes with needles removed. Syringes should be placed in a leakproof outer container for transport. Injection of the fluid into a small sterile vial (provided by the laboratory) is preferable.

Because of the distinctive clinical presentation of both bacterial and viral conjunctivitis coupled with the self-limited nature of these infections, determining its etiology is infrequently attempted [31]. When tests are requested, diagnosis of bacterial conjunctivitis is often compromised by the prior use of empiric antibacterial therapy [29, 30]. Sexually active patients who present with bacterial conjunctivitis should have an aggressive diagnostic work-up with Gram stain and cultures because of their risk for Neisseria gonorrhoeae conjunctivitis. This is a sight-threatening infection that can result in perforation of the globe. In the developing world, trachoma, a form of conjunctivitis due to specific strains of Chlamydia trachomatis, is a leading cause of blindness, especially in children [32]. Off-label use of commercial NAAT assays is used for detection of this agent in research settings [33]. Certain organisms that are part of the indigenous skin and mucous membrane microflora such as coagulase negative staphylococci, Corynebacterium spp, and viridans streptococci are generally considered nonpathogenic when recovered from the conjunctival mucosa and are considered to be \u201cnormal flora.\u201d In specimens taken from the surface or interior of the eye, these organisms along with Propionibacterium acnes are considered pathogens, especially in patient post-cataract or LASIK surgery [26]. Adenovirus, the etiologic agent of \u201cpink eye,\u201d is highly transmissible in a variety of settings. This is almost always a clinical diagnosis although for epidemiologic purposes culture or NAAT can be done [26]. Most cases of neonatal conjunctivitis are due to either Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Chlamydia trachomatis, or herpes simplex virus. Commercial NAATs for both N. gonorrhoeae and C. trachomatis are not FDA approved for this specimen type, so culture or in the case of C. trachomatis, direct fluorescent antibody testing, if available, can be used [26].",

Depending on the mode of pathogenesis, the spectrum of causative agents will vary (Table III-3). Specimens for diagnosis of endophthalmitis can be obtained by aspiration of aqueous or vitreous fluid or via biopsy [43]. Specimen amounts are small, so discretion must be exercised in determining for which agents the specimen should be examined. Post-operative endophthalmitis is most often caused by gram-positive organisms with coagulase-negative staphylococci predominating; chronic post-operative endophthalmitis can be due to P. acnes, so this organism should not be dismissed as a contaminant [44, 45]. Environmental organisms such as dematiaceous fungi, Fusarium spp, Bacillus cereus, Nocardia spp, Mycobacterium chelonae, and glucose fermenting gram-negative rods are more commonly encountered in patients with exogenous endophthalmitis [45, 46]. Endogenous endophthalmitis, because of its association with bacteremia and fungemia, is usually caused by those organisms most responsible for bloodstream infections (eg Candida albicans and related species, Aspergillus spp, S. aureus, S. pneumoniae, the Enterobacteriaceae, especially Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa) [45, 47, 48]. Viruses and parasites are rarely found to cause endophthalmitis, however, as in cases of trauma or severe immunosuppression, infection due to agents such as the herpes viruses, Toxoplasma gondii, Toxocara spp, Echinococcus spp, and Onchocerca volvulus do occur [39, 49] and typically involve the uvea and retina. For further information on the diagnosis of ocular infections caused by Onchocerca volvulus, see Section XV-C.\n",

The comparison of intraocular antibody levels in aqueous humor to that in serum has been found to be a useful means for diagnosing ocular toxoplasmosis but because the specimen needed for testing can only be obtained by a highly invasive procedure, it is unlikely that this technique will be used outside the research setting [54]. NAAT of blood, vitreous or aqueous fluids, is not as sensitive as intraocular antibody determinations, but the specimens for testing may be more easily obtained. Sensitivities of NAATs ranging from 50% to 80% have been reported in patients with T. gondii retinitis depending on the sequence used and the specimen tested. It should be noted that the total numbers of specimens tested in these studies are small, so the diagnostic value of NAAT in T. gondii retinitis is not yet clear [55, 56].",

Nevertheless, cases do occur in HIV patients who have either failed HIV therapy or as an AIDS-presenting diagnosis [53]. In addition, CMV retinitis has been a well-recognized complication of bone marrow and solid organ transplantation, less frequent recently due to improvements in preemptive detection and therapy. CMV retinitis is frequently diagnosed clinically because of characteristic lesions seen on ophthalmologic examination. Quantitative CMV NAAT performed on peripheral blood is also a useful tool in the diagnosis and management of this infection. Patients with detectable CMV viral loads have a higher likelihood of retinal disease progression, and those with high CMV viral loads have increased mortality. Patients with undetectable CMV viral loads have a low likelihood of having virus that is resistant to antiviral agents [57]. Because of inter-laboratory variation in viral quantification, what represents a positive CMV viral load and a high CMV viral load will vary among laboratories [58]. Physicians should consult the laboratory performing the CMV viral load for assistance with test interpretation. As with CMV viral loads, persistent CMV antigenemia also predicts a higher likelihood of retinal disease progression and death [59].",

Alloiococcus otitidis is also thought to cause AOME, but additional studies are needed to determine the true significance of this organism [70]. A variety of respiratory viruses are known to cause AOME; however, there exists no pathogen specific therapy and as a result, there is little reason to attempt to establish an etiologic diagnosis in patients with a viral etiology. Efforts to determine the cause of AOME are best reserved for patients likely to have a bacterial etiology (recent onset, bulging tympanic membrane, pain, or exudate) who have not responded to prior courses of antimicrobial therapy, patients with immunological deficiencies, and acutely ill patients [69, 71]. The only representative specimen is middle ear fluid obtained either by tympanocentesis or, in patients with otorrhoea or myringotomy tubes, by collecting drainage on minitipped swabs directly after cleaning the ear canal.

The role of respiratory viruses in sinusitis needs further studies.

In maxillary sinusitis, antral puncture with sinus aspiration and, in adults, swabs of material draining from the middle meatus obtained under endoscopic guidance represent the only adequate specimens. Cultures of middle meatus drainage specimens are not recommended for pediatric patients due to potential colonization with respiratory tract pathogens. Examination of nasal drainage material is of no value in attempting to determine the cause of maxillary sinusitis.

In addition, identification of certain pathogens such as Legionella species, influenza viruses, and the agents of bioterrorism have important public health significance. Currently, IDSA/ATS practice guidelines consider diagnostic testing as optional for the patient who is not hospitalized [89]. Those patients who require admission should have pretreatment blood cultures, culture and Gram stain of good-quality samples of expectorated sputum and, if disease is severe, urinary antigen tests for S. pneumoniae and Legionella pneumophila where available. Laboratories must have a mechanism in place for screening sputum samples for acceptability (to exclude those that are heavily contaminated with oropharyngeal flora and not representative of deeply expectorated samples) prior to setting up routine bacterial culture. Poor-quality specimens provide misleading results and should be rejected because interpretation would be compromised. Endotracheal aspirates or bronchoscopically obtained samples (including \u201cmini BAL\u201d using the Combicath [KOL Bio Medical Instruments, Chantilly, VA] or similar technology) may be required in the hospitalized patient who is intubated or unable to produce an adequate sputum sample.

The clinical strategy is based on the presence of a new lung infiltrate plus the presence of 2 of 3 clinical features (fever, leukocytosis or leucopenia, and purulent secretions) [92]. Determining the cause of the pneumonia relies on initial Gram stain and semiquantitative cultures of endotracheal aspirates or sputum. A smear lacking inflammatory cells and a culture absent of potential pathogens have a very high negative predictive value. Cultures of endotracheal aspirates, while likely to contain the true pathogen, also consistently grow more mixtures of species of bacteria than specimens obtained by bronchoscopic techniques. This may lead to additional unnecessary antibiotic therapy. The bacteriologic strategy uses quantitative cultures of lower respiratory tract secretions obtained either bronchoscopically or via endotracheal aspiration without a bronchoscope [92]. Quantities of bacterial growth above a threshold are diagnostic of pneumonia and quantities below that threshold are more consistent with colonization. The generally accepted thresholds are as follows: Endotracheal aspirates, 106 CFU/mL; BAL, 104 CFU/mL; protected specimen brush samples (PSB), 103 CFU/mL. These values have significance only when the samples have been obtained >72 hours before the initiation or a change of antibiotic therapy. Quantitative studies require extensive laboratory work and special procedures that smaller laboratories may not accommodate. Bronchial washes are not appropriate for routine bacterial culture.",

Table VI-4 summarizes the major pathogens. Any significant accumulation of fluid in the pleural space should be sampled by thoracentesis. Specimens should be hand carried immediately to the laboratory or placed into appropriate anaerobic transport media for transport. In some institutions, bedside inoculation into blood culture bottles has become an established practice. This is acceptable providing that the manufacturer's guidelines are followed with respect to the volume inoculated and whether supplementation is required to enhance recovery of fastidious pathogens such as S. pneumoniae. If blood culture bottles are used, an additional sample should be sent to the microbiology laboratory for Gram stain and culture of nonbacterial pathogens when indicated. Fluid should be sent for cell count, pH, protein, glucose, and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH). These values assist with the determination of a transudative or exudative process and in the subsequent management of the syndrome. For example, the following parameters suggest the need for drainage: pH <7.28; glucose <40 mg/dL; LDH >1000 IU/L or the presence of polymorphonuclear leucocytes (PMNs) [94]. Most infections result in an exudate or PMNs (empyema) within the pleural cavity. When tuberculosis or a fungal pathogen is thought to be the likely cause, a pleural biopsy sent for culture and histopathology increases the diagnostic sensitivity. Always notify the laboratory of a suspicion of tuberculosis so that appropriate safety precautions can be employed. An elevated adenosine deaminase level in the pleural fluid (>70 IU/L) in a patient with appropriate risk factors for tuberculosis has been shown to have a high sensitivity in high prevalence regions. A level <40 IU/L excludes the diagnosis. This marker of lymphocyte differentiation should be used in conjunction with hematologic and chemical parameters and other diagnostic tests such as NAAT, culture, and histology of a pleural biopsy. The performance of this assay in developed countries has been shown to be quite variable and is related to multiple factors including the type of method used, the likelihood of tuberculosis, and \u201cfalse positive\u201d results in patients with other causes of lymphocytic pleural effusion such as rheumatoid disease, mesothelioma, and histoplasmosis [95].\n",

A limited number of organisms have been implicated in chronic infections (Table VI-5). Early in childhood, infections are caused by organisms frequently seen in the non-CF pediatric population such as S. pneumoniae, H. influenzae, and S. aureus. At some point later in childhood or adolescence, P. aeruginosa becomes the most important pathogen involved in chronic lung infection and the concomitant lung destruction that follows. The P. aeruginosa strains adapt to the hypoxic stress of the retained mucoid secretions by converting to a biofilm mode of growth (mucoid colonies). Nosocomial pathogens such as S. maltophilia and Achromobacter xylosoxidans may be acquired during a hospital or clinic visit. Burkholderia cepacia complex is a very important pathogen in these patients. B. cepacia genomovar III (B. cenocepacia) is highly pathogenic and is responsible for rapid decline and death in a subset of patients who acquire the virulent clones. Special microbiological techniques are required to recover and differentiate B. cepacia complex from the mucoid P. aeruginosa strains. Less common gram-negative organisms that appear to be increasing in their frequency of recovery, but whose role in the pathogenesis of CF lung disease is still unclear, include B. gladioli, Ralstonia spp, Cupriavidus spp, and Pandorea [96].\n",

The advantage to the noninvasive assays such as the urea breath test and stool antigen determinations is that patients can avoid endoscopy and gastric biopsy.

Utilization of an assay that detects both toxin A and toxin B improves the sensitivity. With the availability of NAAT assays, EIAs for toxin alone are no longer recommended as stand-alone assays.",

To reduce turnaround time and costs, some laboratories may employ an algorithm that uses a rapid screening test for glutamate dehydrogenase (GDH) antigen with or without toxin A and B detection followed by cytotoxin or NAAT confirmation where indicated. NAAT testing should be employed if GDH antigen and toxin screening results do not agree. This algorithm allows for both the rapid reporting of most negative specimens and the sensitivity of cytotoxin testing or NAAT but could result in delays in diagnosis that range from hours to days, depending on the laboratory testing platform employed [109, 110].",

SBP tends to be monomicrobic and caused by aerobic organisms from the intestinal tract; therefore, anaerobic cultures are less valuable. Sufficient fluid (eg, 10\u201350 mL if available) should be obtained to allow for concentration by centrifugation and a cytospin Gram stain evaluation. At a minimum, at least 10 mL of peritoneal fluid (not swabs of the fluid) should be collected aseptically and transported to the laboratory prior to the administration of antimicrobial agents. Additional laboratory testing should include fluid analysis for protein, cell count and differential, lactate concentration and pH along with 2\u20133 sets of blood cultures for the identification of concomitant bacteremia (Table VIII-1). Alternatively, because SBP and infections of ascites fluid tend to be monomicrobic, an aerobic blood culture bottle can be inoculated with fluid (volume dependent on blood culture system) if the presence of a single organism is reasonably certain. A Gram stain may be used prior to broth inoculation to evaluate the morphology of the organism(s) present. Since the differentiation between SBP and secondary peritonitis may be uncertain, it may be beneficial to submit peritoneal fluid in a sterile container for conventional culture and stain as well as inoculate blood culture bottles at the bedside with the fluid. Sequencing and 16S PCR can be used to identify isolates present in these specimens if these techniques are available to the laboratory. In the next few years, next generation sequencing will be able to analyze such specimens to determine the total microbial load by species. If more than 1 morphologic type is noted in the Gram stain, a broth should not be inoculated. The caveat for use of blood culture bottles with fluid other than blood is that not all systems have been evaluated for this purpose. Further, broth cultures do not accurately reflect the bacterial burden or the variety of organisms at the time the specimen is obtained and the presence of a true pathogen may be obscured by the overgrowth of a more rapidly growing organism.",

The location, size, and number of liver abscesses is often not helpful for differentiation purposes as the majority are in the right lobe and can be seen in single or multiple loci [124\u2013126]. In regions where E. histolytica disease is endemic, the use of serology or serum antigen detection tests can be helpful to exclude amebic abscess [127] whereas examination of stool for cysts and trophozoites is generally not (Table VIII-2). Liver abscess aspirates can be tested for the presence of E.histolytica antigen as well as submitted for direct microscopic evaluation for parasites. When amebic disease is unlikely, the abscess should be aspirated and the contents submitted in anaerobic transport for aerobic and anaerobic bacterial cultures. Commonly recovered isolates include Klebsiella spp, E. coli, and other Enterobacteriaceae, Pseudomonas spp, Streptococcus spp including Streptococcus anginosus group spp, Enterococcus spp, viridans group Streptococcus, S. aureus, Bacteroides spp, Fusobacterium spp (especially with Lemierre's syndrome), Clostridium spp, and rarely Candida spp [124\u2013126]. Aerobic and anaerobic bacterial culture should be requested (Table VIII-2). Blood cultures can also be helpful in establishing an etiology if collected prior to the institution of antimicrobial therapy [125, 126]. Occasionally, patients with primary genital infections due to N. gonorrhoeae or C. trachomatis can have extension of the disease to involve the liver capsule or adjacent peritoneum (Fitz-Hugh-Curtis syndrome).",

As much specimen as possible is desirable; specimens may include pieces of intact bone, shavings, scrapings and excised necrotic material. In true osteomyelitis, the bone tissue is often so necrotic that it can be easily obtained with a curette. Swab cultures of sinus tracts are not diagnostic and are not recommended. Similarly, determining the etiology of joint infections usually requires sampling the joint space directly with aspiration of synovial fluid and/or biopsy of the synovium. Concomitant or secondary bacteremia or fungemia occurs sporadically in patients with both osteomyelitis and infections of joints, although patients with contiguous spread osteomyelitis rarely develop bacteremia and blood cultures are rarely appropriate for that population. Thus, blood cultures collected during febrile episodes are recommended for the evaluation of patients suspected of having secondary bacteremia or fungemia. Assessment of acute phase reactants or nonspecific markers of inflammation such as procalcitonin, C-reactive protein, and erythrocyte sedimentation rates are not diagnostic in patients with these infections, but they may yield helpful information during therapy. Some less common agents may require molecular detection methods, which will often need to be sent to a reference laboratory with ensuing longer turnaround time for results (Table IX-1) [136].\n",

It is important to change to a fresh sterile scalpel after making the initial incision. One recommendation to differentiate true coagulase-negative staphylococcal infection from contamination occurring during surgical removal of tissue surrounding a prosthetic joint is to obtain 3\u20136 separate small tissue biopsies or curettings during the surgical procedure.

A European publication documented rapid (1\u20132 hour) pre- and perisurgical identification of S. aureus, MRSA, and putative methicillin-resistant coagulase negative staphylococci from joint fluids using a rapid NAAT assay [143]. Intra-operative Gram stains have poor yield (33%\u201350%) but if positive, may be helpful. Shoulder joints, whether natural or prosthetic, are preferentially infected with Propionibacterium acnes, a normally commensal skin organism [144]. Anaerobic cultures of shoulder tissue biopsies should be incubated in anaerobic broth for up to 14 days before discarding as negative. Recent work, primarily from Mayo Clinic, recommends sonication of prosthetic joint biopsy samples and culture of the post-sonication fluid [145]. Another recent technique that was found to increase yield of bacteria and perhaps yeast from joint tissue and bone removed during prosthetic revision surgery was bead mill processing using 1 mm glass beads [146]. Since fungi and mycobacteria are extremely rare in this setting, they should not be sought without special communication with the laboratory [147, 148]. If fungi are suspected, the bead mill method would likely destroy hyphal elements, so mincing bone and tissue and direct inoculation onto fungal agar is still recommended. Both sonication and bead mill processing are not available in most laboratories.",

These provide diagnostic recommendations that are similar to those presented here (Table X-1). The differentiation of cystitis and pyelonephritis requires clinical information and physical findings as well as laboratory information, and from the laboratory perspective the spectrum of pathogens is similar for the two syndromes [159]. Culturing only urines that have tested positive for pyuria, either with a dipstick test for leukocyte esterase or other indicators of PMNs may increase the likelihood of a positive culture, but occasionally samples yielding positive screening tests yield negative culture results and vice versa [160]. The Gram stain is not the appropriate method to detect PMNs in urine but it can be ordered as an option for detection of high numbers of gram-negative rods when a patient is suspected of suffering from urosepsis. Because urine is so easily contaminated with commensal flora, specimens for culture of bacterial urinary tract pathogens should be collected with attention to minimizing contamination from the perineal and superficial mucosal microbiota [161]. Although some literature suggests that traditional skin cleansing in preparation for the collection of midstream or \u201cclean catch\u201d specimens is not of benefit, many laboratories find that such specimens obtained without skin cleansing routinely contain mixed flora and if not stored properly and transported within one hour to the laboratory, yield high numbers of one or more potential pathogens on culture. Interpretation of such cultures is difficult, so skin cleansing is still recommended. The use of urine transport media in vacuum-fill tubes or refrigeration immediately after collection may decrease the proliferation of small numbers of contaminating organisms and increase the numbers of interpretable results. Straight or \u201cin-and-out\u201d catheterization of a properly prepared patient usually provides a less contaminated specimen. If mixed enteric bacteria in high numbers are recovered from a second, well-collected straight-catheterized sample from the same patient, a rectal-urinary fistula should be considered. Laboratory actions should be based on decisions arrived at by dialogue between clinician and laboratory.\n",

Culture from indwelling catheters is therefore strongly discouraged, but if required, the specimen should be taken from the sampling port of a newly inserted device. Cultures of Foley catheter tips are of no clinical value and will be rejected. Collection of specimens from urinary diversions such as ileal loops is also discouraged because of the propensity of these locations to be chronically colonized. Chronic nephrostomy collections and bagged urine collections are also of questionable value. Multiple organisms or coagulase-negative staphylococci may be recovered in patients with urinary stents, and may be pathogenic. It is important that Urologists and Nephrologists who care for patients with complicated infections discuss any special needs or requests with the microbiology director or supervisor. Specimens from these patients may contain a mixed flora and if specific interpretive criteria are documented for these specimen types, the laboratory must be aware of the documentation and the special interpretive standards. Laboratories routinely provide antimicrobial susceptibility tests on potential pathogens in significant numbers. Specimens obtained by more invasive means, such as cystoscope or suprapubic aspirations should be clearly identified and the workup discussed in advance with the laboratory, especially if the clinician is interested in recovery of bacteria in concentrations less than 1000 colony forming units (cfu) per milliliter. Identification of a single potential pathogen in numbers as low as 200 cfu/mL may be significant, such as in acute urethral syndrome, but requests for culture results reports of <10 000 cfu/mL should be coordinated with the laboratory so that an appropriate volume of urine can be procesed.",

Recovery of Mycobacterium tuberculosis is best accomplished with first-voided morning specimens of >20 mL, and requires a specific request to the laboratory so that appropriate processing and media are employed. Recovery of adenovirus in cases of cystitis requires a specific request for viral culture.

The 2006 consensus guidelines are discussed in the American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology by Wright et al. regarding routine high-risk HPV testing and available at the website www.asccp.org/consensus/histological.shtml (accessed 2-3-13) [170]. A more recent American Society for Colposcopy and Cervical Pathology (ASCCP) HPV genotyping update discusses the testing specifically for HPV 16/18 genotype in women over 30. Basically, HPV testing is recommended for the purposes of triaging women >20 years of age with atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance (ASC-US) or ASC-H (atypical squamous cells cannot exclude high grade squamous intraepithelial lesion [HSIL]). Only testing for those high-risk HPV types that are associated with cervical cancer is appropriate. Follow-up testing for abnormal cytology and/or positive HPV is complicated and readers are referred to the ASCCP guidelines for management decisions. In addition, recommendations for testing for genotypes 16/18 HPV for women over 30, where high risk HPV testing can be ordered in conjunction with cytology, should be considered. In general, results of cytology negative but HPV high risk positive warrant HPV 16/18 genotype determination for identification of patients at higher risk for progression to invasive cervical cancer [171]. Endocervical specimens in liquid cytology medium have a higher sensitivity for detecting significant lesions (eg squamous intraepithelial lesions (SIL) and can facilitate subsequent HPV testing in patients since it can be done from the same specimen. Patients with a cervix remaining after hysterectomy, HIV positive patients, and patients that have received the quadrivalent recombinant HPV vaccine (Gardasil from Merck and Co.) should undergo routine Papanicolaou (Pap) and HPV screening and management. Pap and/or HPV testing should be postponed when a woman is menstruating [170, 172, 173].",

            "text": "In the United States, testing for syphilis traditionally has consisted of initial screening with an inexpensive nontreponemal test (rapid plasma reagin, RPR), then retesting reactive specimens with a more specific, and more expensive, treponemal test (eg T. pallidum particle agglutination [TP-PA]). If a nontreponemal test is being used as the screening test, it should be confirmed, as a high percentage of false positive results occur in many medical conditions unrelated to syphilis. When both test results are reactive, they indicate present or past infection. However, for economic reasons, some high-volume clinical laboratories have begun using automated treponemal tests, such as automated EIAs or immunochemoluminescence tests, and have reversed the testing sequence: first screening with a treponemal test and then retesting reactive results with a nontreponemal test. This approach has introduced complexities in test interpretation that did not exist with the traditional sequence [174]. Specifically, screening with a treponemal test sometimes identifies persons who are reactive to the treponemal test but nonreactive to the nontreponemal test. No formal recommendations exist regarding how such results derived from this new testing sequence should be interpreted, or how patients with such results should be managed. To begin an assessment of how clinical laboratories are addressing this concern, CDC reviewed the testing algorithms used and the test interpretations provided in four laboratories in New York City [174]. Substantial variation was found in the testing strategies used, which might lead to confusion about appropriate patient management. A total of 3664 (3%) of 116 822 specimens had test results (ie, reactive treponemal test result and nonreactive nontreponemal test result) that would not have been identified by the traditional testing algorithms, which obviate additional testing if the nontreponemal test result is nonreactive. If they have not been previously treated, patients with reactive results from treponemal tests and nonreactive results from nontreponemal tests should be treated for late latent syphilis.",

However, the mode of transmission and/or acquisition is not necessarily that of an STI for BV or VVC, but it is for TV. A number of point-of-care tests (POCTs) can be performed from a vaginal discharge specimen while the patient is in the healthcare setting. Although POCTs are popular, the sensitivity and specificity of POCTs for making a specific diagnosis varies widely and these assays, while rapid, are often diagnostically poor. Some of the tests include a pH strip test, scored Gram stain for BV, wet mount for TV, and 10% KOH microscopic examinations for VVC. For BV, use of clinical criteria (Amsel's diagnostic criteria) is equal to a scored Gram stain of vaginal discharge. However, a scored Gram stain is more specific than probe hybridization and POCT tests (that only detect the presence of G. vaginalis as the hallmark organisms for altered vaginal flora). For VVC and TV the presence of pseudohyphae and motile trichomonads, respectively, allows a diagnosis. However, proficiency in microscopic examination is essential given that infections may be mixed and/or present with atypical manifestations. Unfortunately consistent microscopic exam of vaginal specimens and interpretation are difficult for many laboratories to perform and wide variation of sensitivities (40%\u201370%) for both TV and CVV using smear exam exists relative to NAAT and culture, respectively. It should be noted that recent publications utilizing NAATs highlight the prevalence of Trichomonas as equal to or greater than CT and GC and point to a growing trend toward screening for TV, CT and GC simultaneously. Tests for the entities of vaginosis/vaginitis are shown in Table XI-2 [173, 175\u2013178].\n",

Sampling of the burn wound by either surface swab or tissue biopsy for culture is recommended for monitoring the presence and extent of infection (Table XII-1). Quantitative culture of either specimen is recommended; optimal utilization of quantitative surface swabs requires twice weekly sampling of the same site to accurately monitor the trend of bacterial colonization. A major limitation of surface swab quantitative culture is that microbial growth reflects the microbial flora on the surface of the wound rather than the advancing margin of the subcutaneous or deep, underlying damaged tissue. Quantitative bacterial culture of tissue biopsy should be supplemented with histopathological examination to better ascertain the extent of microbial invasion. Be advised that quantitative bacterial cultures may not be offered in all laboratories; quantitative biopsy cultures should be considered for patients in which grafting is necessary. Prior to any sampling or biopsy, the wound should be thoroughly cleansed and devoid of topical antimicrobials that can affect culture results. Blood cultures should be collected for detection of systemic disease secondary to the wound.\n",

However, a negative smear result does not necessarily rule out a tick borne disease due to the often low and variable sensitivity of peripheral blood smear examination for these organisms. Therefore, clinical specimens for culture, molecular analysis and the majority of serologic assays are, for the most part, sent to reference laboratories. In addition, because most NAATs for the diseases listed are not FDA-cleared, such tests are not universally available. With these limitations in the availability of and performance of various testing formats (ie culture, molecular analysis, and the majority of serologic assays), the provider needs to check with the laboratory for availability of testing, the optimum testing approach, appropriate specimen source, and turn-around time.",

Performing an HIV RNA test after a negative initial antibody and/or antigen test in persons suspected of acute infection may therefore be helpful. Because of the time course of test positivity and the possibility of seronegativity, the laboratory diagnosis of primary (acute) HIV-1 infection is usually based on a high quantitative HIV-1 RNA (viral load) result (typically >105 copies/mL), or qualitative detection of HIV-1 RNA and/or proviral DNA; (Table XIV-1) [227]. Outside of the setting of acute HIV infection however, HIV viral load assays should be used with caution for diagnosis of HIV infection because of the possibility of false positive results. False positive results are generally of low copy number (<5000 copies/mL); therefore, low copy number results should prompt retesting of a second specimen. Notably, because there is a 10- to 14-day period after infection when no markers are detectable, testing another specimen two to four weeks later should be considered if initial antibody, antigen or RNA tests are negative. NAAT is not 100% sensitive in individuals with established HIV infection due to viral suppression, either naturally or therapeutically, or improper specimen collection/handling. If NAAT is used to make a diagnosis of acute HIV-1 infection, it may be helpful to document subsequent HIV-1 seroconversion by conventional serologic testing.\n",

            "text": "HIV p24 antigen may be detected in serum or plasma between 14 and 22 days after infection (before antibody becomes detectable); it typically decreases below detection limits thereafter, limiting utility of p24 antigen testing alone. Combined HIV antibody plus p24 assays (ie, fourth generation assays) are in widespread use as initial screening assays and the Association of Public Health Laboratories and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention now recommend them as initial screening tests for diagnosis of HIV infection [225, 226]. The testing algorithm associated with their use does not require Western Blot. Instead, individuals with reactive results are further tested with an antibody immunoassay that distinguishes HIV-1 from HIV-2 antibodies. If the differentiation assay is negative, further testing with a qualitative or quantitative NAAT is recommended to rule out acute HIV-1 infection. If the differentiation assay is positive, viral load testing (and usually also CD4 determination) is recommended to direct management. An alternate approach is an initial HIV antigen/antibody combination assay that discriminates detection of antigen from antibody; p24 reactivity is subsequently confirmed by NAAT and antibody reactivity by an HIV-1/HIV-2 differentiation assay. The traditional laboratory diagnosis of nonacute HIV-1 infection (Table XIV-1) begins with screening for HIV-1/-2 antibodies. When testing by the screening assay shows reactive results, confirmatory testing by Western blot is performed. (As an alternative, NAAT testing or a second antibody immunoassay\u2014using different antigenic constituents or based on different principles\u2014may be considered.) An initial positive HIV antibody immunoassay using an oral fluid specimen is followed by an immunoassay performed on blood, serum or plasma, a positive result of which is followed by NAAT or supplemental antibody testing to corroborate infection. A negative blood, serum or plasma result requires follow-up testing as previously described [225, 226]. Using the traditional algorithm, if the Western blot result is positive, the patient is considered to be infected with HIV-1. If negative, testing for HIV-2 antibodies is recommended to rule out the possibility of HIV-2 infection causing the reactive combined HIV-1/-2 antibody result. If the Western blot test is unreadable (ie, due to high background reactivity of the strip), testing with an HIV-1 antibody-specific indirect immunofluorescence assay or qualitative or quantitative testing for HIV-1 RNA or for proviral DNA should be considered. According to Association of Public Health Laboratories and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, an HIV-1 antibody Western blot result is interpreted as positive when at least 2 of the 3 following bands are present: p24, gp41, and gp120/gp160. If only one of these bands is present, the result is indeterminate, and additional supplemental testing with an HIV-1 antibody-specific indirect immunofluorescence assay, an EIA for HIV-2 antibodies alone, and a qualitative HIV-1 RNA and/or proviral DNA assay should be considered. Causes of indeterminate Western blots include evolving antibody profiles, specimen contamination, antibody decline with immune system failure (late stage infection), nonspecific reactivity due to viral or cellular protein components, other infections (eg, syphilis, other retroviruses, some parasites), immune-modulating conditions (eg, pregnancy), and infection with groups N, O, or P HIV-1, or HIV-2. High-risk patients with reactive serologic screening test results and indeterminate Western blots but negative supplemental tests should be considered for retesting two to four weeks later. If this does not resolve the issue, additional supplemental testing (eg, NAAT) may be considered. Western blot assay is less sensitive than third or fourth generation EIAs during seroconversion with up to three weeks following a positive fourth generation assay before a positive Western blot assay. Since as many as a third of healthy HIV-uninfected blood donors have indeterminate HIV-1 Western blot assays, they should not be ordered as the first test for HIV. Line immunoassays incorporating HIV-1 and HIV-2-specific recombinant proteins and/or synthetic peptides (compared to purified proteins separated by electrophoresis used in Western blotting) are alternatives to Western blot assays.",

Alternatively, disappearance of hepatitis B e antigen may denote the emergence of a precore mutant virus; high concentrations of HBsAg and HBV DNA, in the absence of hepatitis B e antigen and presence of antibody to hepatitis B e antigen suggest the presence of a precore mutant virus. Hepatitis B viral DNA is present in serum or plasma in acute and chronic hepatitis B infection [237].

In contrast, the thin films are prepared like a hematology peripheral smear and are fixed in ethanol before staining. Fixation retains the structure of the RBCs and intraerythrocytic parasites and provides ideal morphology for Plasmodium speciation. It also allows for optimal evaluation and differentiation of malaria from Babesia parasites, although the different Babesia species cannot be distinguished from one another by morphology alone. Staining is best performed with Giemsa at a pH of 7.2 to highlight the microscopic features of the parasites. Wright-Giemsa and rapid field stains are also acceptable.",
