            "text": "Acute gastroenteritis is the leading cause of morbidity worldwide especially among children under five years old and elderly population (Patel and Glass 2009). This is associated with important medical and healthcare costs. Foodborne viruses infect humans via gastrointestinal tracts and are excreted through feces, in a process known as fecal\u2013oral route (Lee et al.2013). Among these foodborne agents, norovirus (NoV), rotavirus (RV), adenovirus (AdV) and astrovirus (AsV) are considered the most important aetiological agents of acute non-bacterial gastroenteritis, transmitted by contaminated food and water (Phan et al.2011; Amaral et al.2015). Although nowadays the knowledge about viral foodborne diseases is extensive, the study of fecal\u2013oral route is relatively recent. The first documented outbreak associated with food was in 1914, and the causative agent was recognized as poliovirus and transmitted through raw milk (Jubb 1915). This viral pathogen was later classified as a member of Picornaviridae family (Fenner 1976).",

With regard to the other non-structural proteins, 2C, 3C and 3D regions are well aligned with the corresponding sequences of other picornavirus as Aphthovirus, Cardiovirus and Parechovirus. The 3B protein (VPg) of AiV is longer than other viruses of the same family, the 3C is the protease with conserved motifs characteristic of all picornaviruses, and the 3D region encodes the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) needed for viral replication (Yamashita and Sakae 2003).

On the other hand, in South Korea genotype prevalence is not clearly detected, since both genotypes were detected equally in stool samples from teenagers and adults (Han et al.2014). In other places as Thailand, alternance of AiV A and AiV B as predominant genotypes along the time was observed (Yamashita et al.2000; Saikruang et al.2014; Chuchaona et al.2017). In Europe, AiV B was also reported. In Finland and Spain AiV B was detected, but at lower prevalence than AiV A (Kaikkonen et al.2010; Rivadulla et al.2019). In Germany a genotype drift was detected, and AiV B seems to be more prevalent than in previous surveys (Drexler et al.2011). AiV B was detected in stool samples from Brazilian children suffering diarrhea (Oh et al.2006), and in North American children between 15 days and 5 years of age with symptoms of acute gastroenteritis (Chhabra et al.2013). In Africa, AiV B was detected from one outpatient children in Nigeria (Japhet et al.2018).",

The highly conserved 5\u2032-UTR sequence is a common RT-qPCR target for picornavirus detection (Drexler et al.2011; Nielsen et al.2013). However, a RT-qPCR that amplifies the VP0 region, and could quantify and differentiate between genotypes A and B, was developed for determination of viral RNA load in clinical and environmental samples (Kitajima et al.2013). This RT-qPCR consists in two amplifications: one that uses a universal primer pair that could amplify both genotypes and a universal probe to detect AiV. The second one uses the same primer pair but two different genotype-specific probes. Both methods, VP0 qPCR and 5\u2032-UTR qPCR showed similar efficiency for AiV detection, with the advantage that VP0 qPCR is able to quantify and also differentiate the AiV genotypes.",

Digital RT-PCR (RT-dPCR) is a precise endpoint-sensitive absolute quantification approach, capable of determine the number of target copies without a standard curve. As an example, AiV and eighteen enteric viruses more were targeted with this method and compared with RT-qPCR (Coudray-Meunier et al.2016), the conclusions were that the limit of AiV detection for RT-dPCR assay was lower (7.8 \u00d7 102 genome copies/\u03bcL) than the limit of detection obtained with conventional RT-qPCR (1.0 \u00d7 103 genome copies/\u03bcL). This new technology presents many advantages and possibilities for detection of enteric pathogens in environmental and clinical samples. The RT-dPCR divides each reaction mix across thousands of individual PCR reactions, making this method more tolerant to inhibitory substances and also reducing the difficulty of virus quantification (Pinheiro et al.2012; Ra\u010dki et al.2014).",

As a response, villi get retracted and the absorption surface area decreases. Meanwhile, crypt cells undergo rapid division to repopulate the villi with immature cells resistant to the infection, but the younger cells can not replace the function of those that were infected because they require time to mature and diarrhea appears (Carter 2005). AiV is a cause of chronic infection in X-linked agammaglobulinemia and its prevalence in stool samples from patients with human immunodeficiency virus is high, indicating an opportunistic behavior in people with underlaying T cell defects (Oude Munnink et al.2014; Portes et al.2015; Bucciol et al.2018).",

In addition, evidences of zoonotic infection or interspecies transmission of bovine kouvirus to pig was documented (Kharim et al.2010), suggesting that close contact among different animal species may increase the possibilities of interspecies transmission.

However, the methodological advances in molecular biology lead to the development of new technologies that improve the detection of these pathogens.
