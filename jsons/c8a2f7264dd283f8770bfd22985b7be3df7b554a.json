South Africa had its first COVID-19 case on March 5, 2020 . Fearful that a significant segment of the population was particularly vulnerable-7.7 million South Africans have HIV and even more live in crowded conditions-the president declared a national state of disaster on March 15th when the caseload rose to 51 [1] . The country initially implemented a 3-week lockdown to contain COVID-19's spread, which was later extended to 5 weeks. In preparation for a future swell of COVID-19 patients, the Western Cape Department of Health (WC DoH) implemented a plan to \"de-escalate\" healthcare services to reduce the spread of infection and increase capacity to accommodate COVID-19 patients [2] . All non-urgent elective surgeries and outpatient appointments were postponed. Stable chronic patients were given 2-months supplies of medication with up to 6 months of refills. Only emergency life-saving care, contraception, antenatal care, and immunizations have continued as normal.",

The SAHCS strongly advocated that 6-month supplies of ARVs be issued to stable patients, reducing the risk of COVID-19 exposure inherent in seeking in-person treatment at healthcare facilities as well as to minimize patient flow in a clinic [10] . Ideally, to change from TEE to TLD a patient should have a VL < 50 copies/mL within 6 months, as stipulated by national guidelines. However, the SAHCS and WC DoH advocated switching a patient to TLD, even without a recent VL, if the patient has been on ARVs for > 1 year, the past 2 VLs were < 50 copies/mL, and they have regularly collected ARVs over the past year [7, 10] . Patients fulfilling these criteria are very likely to be suppressed and can be switched to TLD without delay [10] . Additionally, the WC DoH urged same day initiation of ARVs when not medically contraindicated, ARV initiation for all co-infected TB patients 2 weeks after starting TB treatment, and urgently changing all patients failing 1 st line TEE to a 2 nd line ARV regimen, preferably with dolutegravir [7] . Patients unsuppressed on ARVs will need additional clinical contact and adherence support. The SAHCS and WC DoH recommendations seek to fast-track PLHIV onto a robust ARV regimen during the pandemic to maximize their possibility of viral suppression and minimize their exposure to the healthcare system and, potentially, COVID-19.",

Likewise, many of South Africa's lay HIV-counselors have been re-deployed to community COVID-19 screening. Although HIV testing is ongoing, anecdotally testing numbers and new diagnoses of HIV are lower since the WC DoH began discouraging nonessential healthcare visits. HIV self-testing at home or HIV testing in coordination with community COVID-19 screens could potentially fill that gap.",

PLHIV are more likely to continue treatment if it is convenient and they can keep working without sitting all day in un-friendly, stigmatizing clinics to collect medication. In fact, the WHO recommends that clinically stable patients receive ARV refills every 3-6 months to decrease the burden of care [14] . Forced by the pandemic, the WC DoH has advised clinicians to give stable patients up to 6 months of refills of a highly efficacious ARV-TLD-with minimal clinic contact. We have effectively turned most of the HIV service into one giant alternative model of care. It is possible that without the burden of frequent visits, there might be improved retention in care during the pandemic because patients are given the medication and empowered to manage their own health. The roll-out of TLD will confound outcomes, because it will be impossible to tease out if viral suppression rates are due to the better ARV, less burdensome healthcare system, or both.",
