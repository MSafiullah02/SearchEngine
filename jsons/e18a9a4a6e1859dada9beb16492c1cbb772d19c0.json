            "text": "T he coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak was declared a Public Health Emergency of International Concern on January 30, 2020. 1 Health care systems around the world were largely unprepared to deal with the potentially overwhelming surge of affected patients, especially those requiring mechanical ventilation. The World Health Organization has published a range of interim guidelines for all countries on how to prepare for the pandemic, emphasizing the need for intensive care unit (ICU) capacity. 2 Governments and hospitals have needed to redirect resources in an attempt to expand ICU capacity and meet the growing demand.; Current epidemiologic modeling is based on recent viral outbreaks such as severe acute respiratory syndrome, Middle-East respiratory syndrome, and influenza but cannot be regarded as robust until more data are gathered about COVID-19 itself. 3 It has, however, become clear that policymakers must prepare for a health care crisis that may last up to 1, possibly 2 years. The current epicenters are in Europe and North America, and the epidemiologic curve was predicted to peak in most affected countries between April and May, with possible further epidemic waves thereafter. 4 The COVID-19 pandemic undoubtedly has the capacity to overwhelm health care systems, even in affluent societies. This is due not only to the unprecedented surge of patients but also a likely concomitant and high infection rate among doctors and nurses. About 10% of the reported cases in China and Italy have been among health care workers. 5 In our hospital, a cohort of 538 asymptomatic staff members participated in a UK study that aims to ascertain the prevalence of asymptomatic viral carriage in health care workers. As we passed through the initial surge of COVID-19 cases, nearly one quarter of them were found to be antibody positive by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay testing, and only 3% were positive to testing by polymerase chain reaction. Just more than one third of this cohort had previously self-isolated at home with symptoms of COVID-19 (unpublished data Q4 ). Required increases in hospital capacity include, primarily, expansion of ICU and respiratory wards, both as regarding to beds and appropriately trained medical and nursing staff. Preparation is urgent, but options are limited. The pragmatic approach has been to redeploy existing bed capacity and reconfigure health care workforces. Outpatient activity has been reduced and nonurgent diagnostic tests and elective treatments have been postponed. Such changes have inevitably reduced hospitals' capacity to manage other conditions. Neurosurgical care is clearly impacted by these COVID-19 responses. Elective surgical procedures have been cancelled so that operating theater staff and equipment can be used for critical care. Outpatient activity has been reduced, both to redirect resources and to lower transmission of the disease by decreasing the footfall in hospitals. Neurosurgeons have faced unprecedented challenges, including working outside their area of expertise, prioritization of neurosurgical cases with limited resources, facing new ethical dilemmas, and being exposed to moral injuries, medicolegal risks and, in some cases, to financial uncertainties. Neurosurgical training and research also have been reduced, and non\u00c0COVIDrelated global health work has been suspended ( Table 1) . New working models and systems have needed to be developed, within a short period of time, to ensure safe neurosurgical practices as far as possible. 6 Neurosurgeons have needed to rise to these challenges and take collective actions, in their local settings, to mitigate the negative consequences of the pandemic.",

Some emergency work has also decreased, as a direct consequence of government imposed social distancing rules. For example, we have seen a reduced volume of neurotrauma from road traffic collisions and interpersonal violence. Consequently, the neurosurgical workforce has been engaged in task shifting and task sharing. 7 These radical changes have required rapid retraining of neurosurgical staff, not just to manage the initial COVID-19 surge but also to support a maintenance phase for the duration of the pandemic.",

In our hospital, focused training and collaboration with other specialties has nevertheless helped us to build resilient teams able to provide appropriate care to patients. Areas in which transferrable skills can be applied are being explored, for example, application of theaterbased lifting and patient transfer skills, in providing a \"proning\" service for ventilated patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome. We have elected to redeploy trainees initially, leaving senior staff to assume a significant component of providing the care of neurosurgical patients. Although not required to date, we have the option of senior trainees filling gaps in neurosurgical duty rotations and retired neurosurgeons may be asked to return to work. Medical students have taken up some junior, ward-based roles. Above all, we have found that flexibility in our approach is crucial.",

Local mechanisms have been in place to ensure fair and ethical decision-making. In most settings, especially in the developed world, neurosurgical patients have not been competing with other patients for resources. Those at a high risk of imminently developing neurologic disability have been prioritized. In low-and middle-income countries, priority setting has usually been more complex, due to more limited resources.",

In terms of obtaining the best benefit from finite resources, priority may need to shift from treating the sickest to treating those most likely to respond to aggressive intervention. Parameters that were irrelevant or inappropriate previously may now direct our decisions to treat. Factors may include the availability of drugs, equipment, theater time, and ICU capacity but also life expectancy after surgery and age of the patient. The threshold to intervene neurosurgically will likely increase. Those particularly disadvantaged by these factors are elderly, vulnerable, and frail people. A particular consideration for this group of patients, in the context of neurosurgical pathology, is their concomitant greater risk of mortality from COVID-19 if they are being treated in a COVID-positive hospital. There is clear pressure for neurosurgeons to avoid bringing these patients into hospital, and standard treatments may therefore need to be replaced by suboptimal treatment methods. The risks of complications and unfavorable outcomes will inevitably increase.",

Withholding or delaying these and other neurosurgical procedures may result in significant neurologic impairment, or even death, in patients who would otherwise likely have faced a more favorable outcome. In particular, benign pathologies that cause raised intracranial pressure, or lesions that compress the brainstem, the optic apparatus, the spinal cord or the cauda equina, all have a timecritical component to their treatment. Such neurosurgical patients should not be unjustifiably disadvantaged over patients with COVID-19. The most common urgent neurosurgical conditions that require ICU admission are intracranial hemorrhage and traumatic brain injury, with mortality rate of between 30% and 45%. [9] [10] [11] For patients with COVID-19, the in-hospital mortality rate is also regrettably high, at 28% overall, but it is much greater, at more than 50%, among those requiring mechanical ventilation. 12 In contrast, the prognosis for patients admitted to ICU following elective neurosurgical procedures is much more favorable. 13 There are currently no data to suggest that critically ill neurosurgical patients have been denied access to treatment as a result of the COVID-19 outbreak. It is nevertheless still early and the full impact of the pandemic will not be established until after the crisis. Furthermore, the effects of COVID-19 will likely not be the same across the world. In some countries and cities the situation has been kept under control and, hopefully, may remain so throughout the duration of the pandemic. At the same time, some geographic locations have not reached their epidemic peak. Epidemiologic predictions are uncertain, and it remains unclear still quite how the pandemic will evolve. There are as yet no vaccines against COVID-19, and there is no imminent prospect of effective treatments becoming available. 233  234  235  236  237  238  239  240  241  242  243  244  245  246  247  248  249  250  251  252  253  254  255  256  257  258  259  260  261  262  263  264  265  266  267  268  269  270  271  272  273  274  275  276  277  278  279  280  281  282  283  284  285  286  287  288  289  290   291  292  293  294  295  296  297  298  299  300  301  302  303  304  305  306  307  308  309  310  311  312  313  314  315  316  317  318  319  320  321  322  323  324  325  326  327  328  329  330  331  332  333  334  335  336  337  338  339  340  341  342  343  344  345  346  347  348 Neurosurgeons should therefore continue to plan for worst-case scenarios. Neurosurgical services may be further compromised by factors unlikely to be present in normal times, such as staff sickness and shortages of essential supplies. Plans should therefore be developed, with built-in resilience, to cope with fluctuations in demand on services and a unit's capacity to deliver these. Recent reports describing the reconfiguration of neurosurgical services in countries that have already experienced the peak of the pandemic have been valuable in guiding similar endeavors elsewhere. [14] [15] [16] The sharing of knowledge and experience, among neurosurgeons, could certainly assist in the delivery of timely and effective responses in other countries.",

Governments worldwide will and already are being judged on their responses to this pandemic. Their prioritizing the management of COVID-19 is understandable, but this approach inevitably limits the access to health care by other patient groups, leading to \"collateral damage\" and potential inequalities in health care. Neurosurgeons must therefore establish strategies that recognize and mitigate potential health care injustices against their patients.

Such provisions will lessen the impact of moral injuries and promote psychological resilience.

They need to contribute to the response to COVID-19 and continue delivery of care for timecritical neurosurgical conditions. The challenges are massive and involve infrastructure and workforce considerations at multiple levels with limited data to inform decision-making. The pandemic is evolving, and it is not clear to what extent neurosurgery, or health care services in general, will revert to how they were before COVID-19, or what may become the \"new normal.\" The pandemic will likely have a lasting influence on the future of health care, and it is vital that neurosurgeons develop a framework for addressing this crisis and similar global health challenges that may arise in the future.
