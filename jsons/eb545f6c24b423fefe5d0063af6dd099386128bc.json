            "text": "Understanding the immune responses against Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) is important to prevent infection and to design control strategies. We evaluated both systemic and mucosal immune responses to PEDV in pigs and assessed if prior exposure to virus protects against re-infection. Three-week-old pigs were infected with PEDV and immune response in blood, intestine, and mesenteric lymph node (MLN) was evaluated. At 30 dpi, virus exposed pigs were challenged with a field isolate of PEDV and immune response at 5 d post challenge was evaluated. We found that PEDV RNA persists in the intestine even after fecal shedding of the virus was stopped at 28 dpi and pigs previously exposed to PEDV are protected from virus shedding after re-infection. PEDV infection induced both humoral and cell mediated immune response with an increase in PEDV specific IgA and IgG antibodies in intestine and serum. Flow cytometry analysis showed a significantly higher frequency of B cells and lower frequency of T cells at 4 dpi. The frequency of CD4/CD8 double positive (DP) memory T cells was significantly increased in the MLN of challenged animals. These studies may provide further insights into understanding the mucosal immune response to PEDV and its role in protection against disease.

            "text": "Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) is an enveloped single stranded positive sense RNA virus of the genus Alphacoronavirus in the family Coronaviridae. The virus is highly contagious and causes a devastating enteric disease in swine characterized by severe watery diarrhea and vomiting. Although the virus infects pigs of all ages, severe clinical disease and mortality is reported predominantly in neonatal suckling piglets [1] . Since its first identification in the United Kingdom and other European countries in the 1970s [2, 3] , PEDV outbreaks have been reported in many pig producing countries including Japan, Korea, China and the United States (US). In Asia, PEDV outbreaks first occurred in Japan in 1982 and later spread to China and South Korea. Use of inactivated virus vaccines helped control PEDV in the region until [4] . PEDV emerged in a completely na\u00efve US swine population [5, 6] and rapidly spread across the country in 2013, reaching into Canada and Mexico resulting in significant economic losses for the swine industry due to increased mortality and decreased production. PEDV mainly infects epithelial cells of the small intestine and transmission occurs predominantly by fecal-oral route through direct or indirect contact with infected pigs or feces contaminated material [7, 8] . The establishment of both systemic and mucosal immune responses, including secretion of virus specific IgA is essential to provide protection against PEDV infection [9] [10] [11] . Recently, it has been shown in a study using neonatal pigs that route of exposure influences immune response to PEDV infection, with oral infection inducing higher IgA titers both in serum and mucosa compared to intranasal or intramuscular inoculation [12] . In addition to antibody response, cellular immune responses may play an essential role in the protection against PEDV. Exposure to PEDV, through the feedback of fecal and/or homogenized intestine from acutely infected suckling piglets, is considered an important approach to develop short term immunity and to reduce morbidity and pre-weaning mortality in swine herds [6, 7, 13] . However, this feedback method has a potential risk to transmit other pathogens such as porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) and porcine circovirus type 2 (PCV 2), which may cause disease. Currently, modified live attenuated and inactivated vaccines are being used to control PEDV in the US. However these vaccines are not completely effective in providing protection and studies have shown that not all vaccinated sows develop protective lactogenic immunity [14] . The inconsistency in generating lactogenic immunity was attributed to the differences in immunization routes. Higher degree of protection with reduced mortality of suckling piglets was observed when pregnant sows were vaccinated orally with live attenuated PEDV compared to vaccination by intramuscular injection [15] . Although vaccination of sows with live attenuated PEDV reduced mortality of suckling piglets, they neither reduced the severity of diarrhea nor prevented virus shedding after challenge. Genetic differences between vaccine and field strains has been implicated as a possible reason for vaccine failure.",

The pellet was resuspended in sterile PBS and stored in aliquots at -80 o C. Culture supernatant from uninfected Vero 76 cells were processed similarly to use for mock control antigen. For use as antigen in ELISA, purified virus was heat inactivated at 60 o C in a water bath for 1 h. Concentration of total protein in heat inactivated virus stock was determined using Pierce\u2122 BCA protein assay kit (Thermo Scientific, Rockford, IL, USA) according to manufacturer's instructions.",

Briefly, study personnel were allowed to interact directly with seeder pigs experimentally infected with PEDV (USA/Colorado/2013) by intragastric route in an infected animal room. Following 45 minutes interaction with infected seeder pigs, personnel entered low biosecurity sentinel holding room without changing their personal protective equipment (PPE) and interacted with pigs in the low biosecurity room for 45 minutes to allow for transmission of virus to the pigs in low biosecurity room. This procedure was repeated every day until all the pigs in low biosecurity room tested positive for PEDV. Rectal swab samples were collected daily to assess virus shedding. At 30 dpi, PEDV exposed pigs in the low biosecurity room were randomly divided into 2 groups (n = 5 in each group) and housed in two separate rooms. One group of PEDV exposed pigs was challenged via oral route with intestinal mucosal scrapings obtained from acutely infected animals from field strain of PEDV and the other group of PEDV exposed animals was left without challenge. The mucosal scrapings were confirmed to have a high PEDV load, using a quantitative RT-PCR assay. A third group of control na\u00efve age matched pigs (n = 4) were challenged with the same field isolate of PEDV, to compare challenged animals with those getting primary exposure to the virus.",

            "text": "Humoral responses are essential for protection against PEDV infection in the neonatal pig. The first protection for the newborn piglet comes from the lactogenic immunity provided by its mother through colostrum and milk [9, 17] . Previous studies showed that sows previously exposed to mildly virulent strain of PEDV induce lactogenic immunity and cross protect piglets against virulent PEDV [18] . The immune response to PEDV is also determined by route of exposure [12, 15] . Sows vaccinated orally with live attenuated PEDV induced better passive protection to piglets compared to the same vaccine administered by intramuscular injection [15] . Several studies showed that mucosal immunity is induced effectively when vaccines are delivered at the mucosal surface [19] , where microfold (M) cells take up and transport the antigens to dendritic cells and macrophages in the local lymph nodes to initiate antigen specific immune response. In addition, antigen specific response activated at a specific mucosal surface, such as intestine, can mediate an effector response at a distant site. Immune response initiated at the GI surface reaches the mammary gland via gut-mammary gland-sIgA axis and provides passive lactogenic immunity in suckling piglets [20, 21] . Recently it has been shown that induction of lactogenic immune response in pregnant sows depends on stage of gestation and sows infected with PEDV in second trimester provided 100% protection in suckling piglets [11] . While neonatal piglets are protected from PEDV by passive lactogenic immunity induced by vaccinating sows, these piglets become susceptible to PEDV post-weaning, making the induction of active immune responses an important protective mechanism in weaned piglets. Age resistance to clinical disease by PEDV has been described earlier and neonatal piglets exhibit severe clinical signs compared to weaned piglets [1, 22, 23] . In our study, only 50% of pigs exposed to PEDV showed mild diarrhea although all exposed pigs were infected with PEDV and showed virus shedding as determined by PEDV RT-qPCR on rectal swab samples. The duration of virus shedding depends on age of animal and infectious dose [23] and our results are consistent with previous reports, where the virus shedding was observed up to 18 to 28 days in three-week-old pigs [22] [23] [24] . Furthermore, PEDV exposed pigs were completely protected against re-infection when challenged 30 d after initial exposure. A similar trend was reported earlier in challenge studies where pigs previously exposed to virulent PEDV were shown to be protected from infection at challenge and absence of fecal viral shedding after second infection [10, 25] .",

Similar results were observed in a previous study in 4-week-old pigs, where small intestine from 70% of pigs orally inoculated with USA/KS/2013 PEDV isolate were PCR positive at 42 dpi even though immunohistochemistry of intestinal tissue was negative for PEDV N protein and feces were PEDV negative by PCR [26] .

In our present study, intestinal viral RNA load did not increase after PEDV challenge of previously exposed animals. In contrast, challenge infection in na\u00efve pigs showed significantly higher levels of viral RNA in the feces and in intestinal tissue suggesting that prior exposure afforded protection from shedding and consequently transmission. Although the assessment of viral sequences could not distinguish between inoculum and challenge viruses, one could postulate that the inability to shed virus is likely due to a lack of replication of the challenge virus in intestines previously exposed to PEDV.

This finding is consistent with previous reports [10, 29] showing little or no increase in serum IgA and IgG titers or PEDV specific IgA and IgG antibody secreting cells in gut associated lymphoid tissue after challenge in pigs exposed to virulent PEDV. Interestingly, the antibody response to challenge virus in na\u00efve pigs was higher than that was observed after initial infection with PEDV USA/Colorado/2013. While significant antibody response to PEDV was observed only at 21 dpi during primary infection with PEDV USA/Colorado/2013 (Fig 3) , the challenge virus induced robust IgA antibody response as early as 5 dpi in pigs without previous PEDV exposure (Fig 4A-4D \"I\") . This could be due to differences in viral dose of inoculation during primary infection and challenge. Moreover, it is likely that the pathogenesis of viruses used for infection and challenge are different, given the field strain used in these experiments was not characterized. It has been shown that higher and more rapid PEDV specific IgA antibody responses were induced in virulent PEDV inoculated piglets compared to piglets inoculated with an attenuated S-INDEL strain [28] . Neutralizing antibodies in the gut may play an important role in intestinal mucosal immunity and prevent enteric virus infection like PEDV. Previous studies demonstrated presence of neutralizing antibodies in colostrum and milk of PEDV infected sows [30, 31] . In our study, virus neutralizing activity was observed only in serum but not in the intestinal homogenate of infected pigs. The intestinal homogenate used in this study represents a limited sample of the secreted fraction of the IgA antibody and may not be sufficient to assess the neutralizing capacity of the mucosal response to PEDV.",

In an earlier study, virus specific lymphoproliferative response was detected in MLN, blood, and spleen of pigs inoculated with virulent PEDV and showed a strong correlation with protection against virus challenge [32]. More recently, 5 d old suckling mice orally inoculated with PEDV were shown to have a higher frequency of CD8+ T cells but no significant difference in CD4+ T cells compared to control in peripheral blood at 14 dpi [12] . We demonstrate that the frequency of CD4+, CD8+, and CD4/CD8 DP T cells in the mesenteric lymph nodes decrease 4 d after PEDV exposure while B cells in the local secondary lymphoid tissue increase significantly. Like the antibody levels post challenge, anamnestic increase in T cell numbers in response to PEDV challenge was not detected in the blood or mesenteric lymph nodes.",

In swine, they were characterized as memory T helper cells which are activated and proliferate by stimulation with recall viral antigen [34, 35] . Contrary to the response of CD4+ and CD8+ (single positive) T cells, CD4/CD8 DP T cells show a significant increase in frequency within the MLN after challenge in pigs previously exposed to PEDV compared to na\u00efve animals following viral challenge. While this may reflect the expansion of PEDV specific effector memory cells, antigen specificity of these cells was not investigated in this study. The expansion of the DP T cell population in the local lymph node was not reflected in the peripheral circulation suggesting that this is a local response to the challenge virus. This finding indicates that prior exposure to PEDV will foster development of intestinal memory T cells that are capable of immunological response, and perhaps protection against reinfection. The lack of anamnestic responses in the humoral compartment of the mucosal response, argues for an important role of mucosal T cell memory response in PEDV. Further studies are needed to explore antigen specificity and function of the DP memory T cells.",

In addition to antibodies present in the intestines after primary exposure, the increase of DP memory T cells in the mesenteric lymph nodes point to the importance of cell-mediated responses, in mediating protection to the piglet. Future studies may provide additional insights into understanding the immune response to PEDV and help in the design of future mucosal vaccines against PEDV infection.",

The purity of RNA was assessed by calculating the ratio of OD 260 /OD 280 . A portion of the PEDV S gene was amplified with the following primer pairs: Forward 1910: ACGTC CCTTTACTTTCAATTCACA and Reverse 2012: TATACTTGG TACACACATCCAGA-GTCA. PCR amplification was quantified using a FAM labeled probe 1939: FAM-TGAGTTGAT-TA CTGGCACGCCTAA ACCAC-BHQ. The primer and hydrolysis probe set were added to the AgPath-ID \u2122 One-Step RT-PCR Reagents (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) along with 5 \u03bcl of extracted total RNA and amplified using Applied Biosystems\u2122 7500 Fast Real-Time PCR System (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA).
