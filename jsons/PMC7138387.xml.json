On 30 January 2020, the World Health Organization declared the 2019-nCoV outbreak a public health emergency of international concern.6 Countries around the globe have heightened their surveillance to quickly diagnose potential new cases of 2019-nCoV. Due to the increasing outbreak of 2019-nCov, the early diagnosis of patients is crucial for prompt and effective prevention and control of 2019-nCov. Nucleic acid testing is currently the reference standard for diagnosis; however, the nucleic acid kits for testing 2019-nCoV are in short supply. Moreover, some patients infected at an early stage with 2019-nCov are negative for nucleic acid detection of 2019-nCov.7 These cases prolong the time to definitive diagnosis and increase the potential spread of 2019-nCov.",

GGO was defined as subtle GGOs that are seen around the small airways and vessel (Fig 2a). The halo sign was defined as the GGO around a nodule or mass (Fig 4\na). The reversed-halo sign refers to the appearance of a central GGO, which is surrounded by a crescentic- or ring-shaped air-space consolidation (Fig 5\na). The crazy-paving sign refers to the appearance of GGOs with superimposed inter- and intralobular septal thickening (Fig 4b). The sieve-hole sign is a patchy shadow with interlobular septal thickening and bronchodilatation in the transverse section shaped like a sieve (Fig 5b). The cavity sign is a space for gas accumulation, seen as a transparent or low-density region in a mass or nodule in the lung (Fig 5c). The tree -in-bud sign is a branching V- and Y-shaped nodule that resembles the budding branch of a tree (Fig 5d). Bronchodilatation is defined as an increased diameter of bronchus compared to the associated pulmonary artery or the bronchi of similar cross section. Vascular dilatation is defined as increased diameter of a vessel compared to a vessel of similar cross section (Fig 4c). Lymphadenectasis refers to lymph nodes with the diameters >1.5 cm.",

            "text": "The present study found that CT features of COVID-19 manifested as (1) multiple lesions, GGO, involved multiple segment or lobes, causing mild/common-type infection; or (2) multiple lesions presenting with consolidation affected multiple segments or lobes and it was often alongside interlobular septal thickening, causing heavy or critical infection. Furthermore, some infections involved fewer than two lobes and presented with a nodule with or without a halo sign, in patients whose condition often was described as mild or common-type infection. Amongst these patients with COVID-19, lesions of 98.8% (91/93) of patients were with a subpleural distribution, which was inconsistent with the study of Guan et al.\n9 Notably, three patients with COVID-19 had a normal baseline CT. Thus, COVID-19 cannot be excluded in patients with a normal chest CT; isolation and real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to COVID-19 is required if the patient shows respiratory symptoms related to COVID-19 or has a history of epidemiological exposure.",
