            "text": "Human adenoviruses (hAdVs) belong to the genus Mastadenovirus of the family Adenoviridae. There are presently 57 different hAdV types grouped into seven species A to G [1]. Different types cause a wide range of acute and chronic diseases. Acute respiratory disease is predominantly caused by the hAdV types C01, C02, E04, C05 and C06; occasionally by types B03 and B07, whereas gastroenteritis is most commonly associated with the types F40 and F41 [2, 3, 4]. In all age groups, the hAdV infection can include asymptomatic infection or may provoke serious illnesses such as pneumonia (types B03, E04, B07, B14 and B21) or epidemic keratoconjunctivitis (types D08, D19 and D37) [5, 6, 7, 8]. Types E04 and B07 have also caused severe outbreaks of respiratory illness among military recruits [9]. Human AdVs can cause especially severe disease among infants, young children, immunocompromised patients and transplant recipients [10, 11, 12] and hAdV infections occur worldwide as endemic, epidemic and sporadic infections. Therefore, genotype-specific analysis is important for epidemiological studies to provide information on the incidence and distribution of infections by individual hAdV types. Genotype identification is also necessary for the detection of new strains and for understanding hAdV pathogenesis.",

            "text": "Identification of serotypes is traditionally carried out by neutralization with type-specific antisera [13]. The serological detection methods are usually time-consuming, labour-intensive and do not permit a reliable detection of all hAdV serotypes. The availability of rapid diagnostic methods providing uncompromised analytical performance would allow more efficient screening and identification of the pathogen. Today, genotyping by molecular methods such as PCR targeting the hexon or fibre gene, followed by amplicon sequencing or digestion of the amplicon with different restriction enzymes, is often preferred over serotyping [14]. Recently, PCR-based microsphere array and reverse line blot hybridization methods have been described for the detection and differentiation of hAdV genotypes [15,16]. Another approach to multiplex detection is the microarray analysis, which holds great potential for the detection and typing of pathogens. Microarray techniques are flexible, rapid and suitable for high throughput analysis. The sensitivity of PCR and the specificity of DNA hybridization can be combined when the microarray technology is used for the detection and typing of adenoviruses.",

UCPs are inorganic lanthanide-doped crystals that have a unique capability to convert infrared radiation to visible light via absorption of multiple photons. So, no autofluorescence is produced from any biological material, enabling sensitive assay [18].

White plates and nanosized (30 nm) up-converting nanoparticles (UCNPs) were used instead of transparent 96-well microtitre well plates and larger (>110 nm) UCP particles. The exposure time of the white plate is only 1 s, making the assay implementation more user-friendly [17]. New forward primers for real-time PCR were designed because a longer amplicon with more variation in the sequence was needed for the probe design. New oligonucleotide probes were designed to type clinically relevant members of hAdV groups A to F. The updated array-in-well test platform successfully identified hAdV genotypes from ocular swab, respiratory, stool and urine specimens.",

The HPLC-purified oligonucleotides were obtained from http://www.Biomers.net (Ulm, Germany). To improve the probe availability for hybridization, the oligonucleotides were synthesized with three extra T/C nucleotides as spacers at their 5 ends before the terminal amino-link C6 group. Probes g1, g2, g3, g4, g5, g6, g7 and g8 were used for the generic detection of hAdVs (Data S3). Any hAdV genotype was aimed to be identified by at least one generic probe and each target genotype by one or more specific probes in a unique pattern. Microarrays in white 96-well microtitre plates (Nunc, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Roskilde, Denmark) were prepared at the VTT Medical Biotechnology Centre (Turku, Finland).",

The oligonucleotide probes were hybridized with the denatured biotinylated PCR products and the bound biotinylated products were detected with streptavidin-coated UCNPs (see Supplementary material, Data S4). The array-in-well assay was measured with an anti-Stokes photoluminescence imager [17]. The device was constructed for multiplexed testing with laser diode excitation and CCD image sensor, with a minor change in the optics: a Round Diffuser (RD-206-I-Y-A; Holo/Or., Rechovot, Israel) was added between the collimator and the excitation filter. The parameters used in this study were: 2\u00d7 binning, 1 s exposure per well and 7 W laser power. Genotypes were called according to the pattern of fluorescent probe spots.",

Although not all hAdV prototypes were available for in vitro testing, in silico analyses gave a specific pattern for most of the targeted genotypes. Predictably, F40 would not be differentiable from F41 just as B14 was not differentiable from B11. Another weakness is that the PCR method alone is not sufficiently specific for hAdV detection. However, the assay has some attractive advantages compared with other assays. First, the hybridization assay is performed in 96-well microtitre plates allowing the use of common laboratory equipment, and the assay is easy to carry out. Second, microtitre plates enable the analysis of 96 samples at one time. When necessary, it is also possible to add more probes to the 96-well microtitre plate, enabling the typing of additional hAdV genotypes in one assay.",
