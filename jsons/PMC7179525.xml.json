The strain HSR-1 of SARS-CoV, used in this study, was obtained by inoculating Vero cells with a sputum specimen from an Italian patient affected by a severe form of pneumonia of unknown etiology, who had a history of travel from Vietnam to Italy in March 2003 [5]. PBMCs were chosen to perform the experiments because several studies indicated that SARS-CoV is able to infect in vitro PBMCs and to determine virus-specific RNA production [6, 7, 8]. In order to make a comparison, we performed control experiments in which the same cells were induced to produce IFN by vesicular stomatitis (VSV) and Newcastle disease (NDV) viruses.

After adsorption at 37\u00b0 for 1 h, the excess virus inoculum was removed, the cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline, and the wells topped up with medium plus 2% fetal calf serum (Sial, Italy) to 0.1 ml/well.

To further support the view that SARS-CoV is a poor inducer of IFN-\u03b1 subtypes and to gain new insights into the phenomenon, the increase of all IFN-\u03b1 subtypes was measured in PBMCs collected from 5 healthy donors after transfection with double-stranded RNA synthetic analogue such as polyriboinosinic-polyribocytidylic acid (poly-IC) for 24 h. The results of these experiments are shown in figure 3 where it can be seen that relevant amounts of different IFN-\u03b1 subtypes can be measured in cells transfected as above. This observation indirectly underlines that SARS-CoV infection of PBMCs was accompanied by a low induction of IFN-\u03b1 mRNA subtypes and suggests that toll-like receptor 3 (TLR3) together with other pattern recognition receptors could be involved in the signaling leading to expression of type I IFN in PBMCs.",

The potential limitations of our study include the fact that we did not compare IFN response in SARS-CoV-infected PBMCs with those in other relevant human virus. In line with this, it has been reported that in contrast to human coronavirus 229E and influenza A virus (H1N1) there was little or no induction of IFN-\u03b2 in SARS-CoV-infected macrophages [20]. Moreover, it has been shown that SARS-CoV infection of primary human macrophages is associated with a strong induction of chemokines without an associate type I IFN response compared to H5N1 infection [21]. This finding is consistent with the observation that SARS-CoV proteins that prevent IFN induction do exist [22, 23, 24]. In particular, the expression of nsp1 protein of SARS-CoV prevents Sendai virus-induced endogenous IFN-\u03b2 mRNA accumulation without inhibiting dimerization of IFN regulatory factor 3, a protein that is essential for the activation of the IFN-\u03b2 promoter [22]. Furthermore, nsp1 expression promotes degradation of RNA transcripts and host endogenous mRNAs, leading to a stronger host protein synthesis inhibition. In addition, Kopecky-Bromberg et al. [24] found that SARS-CoV open reading frame (ORF) 3b, ORF 6, and N proteins inhibit the expression of IRF-3, suggesting that, like other highly pathogenic viruses, SARS-CoV genome encodes more than one protein able to inhibit IFN.",

Moreover, it has also been reported by Okabayashi et al. [26] that the IFN system was not suppressed by SARS-CoV infection. The reasons for these discrepancies are still unclear. Several factors should be taken into account. These include differences in: (i) cells types used to investigate SARS-CoV capability to induce IFN; (ii) methods employed to determine IFN induction; (iii) timing of sample collections for the analysis of IFN induction with respect to SARS-CoV infections, and (iv) type of virus used to make a comparison with IFN production in SARS-CoV infection.

            "text": "In summary, our data, together with previous results, demonstrate that SARS-CoV (HSR-1 strain) induces a weak IFN response in comparison with well-established IFN-inducing viruses, such as those for VSV and NDV. This phenomenon has also been described for murine hepatitis coronavirus, which is closely related to SARS-CoV [14]. Interestingly, our results further indicate that SARS-CoV-induced activation of the IFN system in human PBMCs is associated with a selective expression of individual IFN-\u03b1 subtypes, IFN-\u03b12 and \u22126 being the most abundant subtypes detected at 24 h p.i. Our results will hopefully make a contribution to further studies of SARS pathogenesis.",
