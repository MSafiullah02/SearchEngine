            "text": "Beta-ketothiolase (mitochondrial acetoacetyl-CoA thiolase, T2) is a key enzyme needed for ketone metabolism and isoleucine catabolism [1]. T2 deficiency is a rare autosomal recessive disorder with an incidence of less than one per 1,000,000 newborns (1]. Owing to diagnostic challenges and lack of awareness, many cases have been missed during their initial presentation [2]. It typically manifests between 6\u201318 months of age as acute and recurrent keto-acidotic episodes triggered by ketogenic stress [1, 2]. Patients are typically asymptomatic between episodes, and the episode frequency decreases with age [2]. The characteristic laboratory finding is the elevation of urine organic acids; tiglylglycine (TIG) 2-methylacetoacetic acid (2MAA) and 3-OH-2-methyl-butyric acid (2M3HB). More than 70 different mutations of the mitochondrial ACAT1 gene have been identified to date as causative for T2 deficiency [3]. Only one case of T2 deficiency has been reported from Sri Lanka, detected by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS), but the diagnosis was not confirmed by genetic studies or enzyme analysis [4]. In this study, we report on the first Sri Lankan case of T2 deficiency confirmed by molecular analysis and characterize a novel mutation in ACAT1 gene.",

Fever settled with medicine prescribed by a general practitioner, but the child\u2019s level of consciousness deteriorated. On admission to the pediatric intensive care unit in a tertiary care hospital, he was afebrile, drowsy, unresponsive to painful stimuli and hypotonic, and had decreased reflexes and sluggish, but equally reactive pupils.

GC/MS analysis revealed very high levels of 2M3HB and TIG (see Fig. 1) which was suggestive of T2 deficiency. However, in the absence of an increase in 2MAA, a deficiency of 2-methyl-3-OH-butyryl-CoA dehydrogenase (MHBD) caused by mutations in HSD17B10 gene was also a possibility.",
