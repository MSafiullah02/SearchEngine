            "text": "Data on transfusion complications, including deaths from transfusion complications, come from passive surveillance (\u201chemovigilance\u201d) studies, active surveillance studies, as well as both RCTs and observational studies. Both the observational studies and the RCTs evaluate consecutive transfused patients at a particular setting(s) as part of a research protocol and\u2014in theory\u2014would be expected to produce the most reliable data. Their downside, however, is that they usually enroll a number of transfused patients that is much too small to document the incidence of rare transfusion complications (or the risk of death from ABT). Active surveillance studies are conducted at a particular hospital or at \u201csentinel\u201d sites in which there is heightened awareness of, and special arrangements have been made for detecting, usually a specific transfusion complication. Passive surveillance systems rely on passive (and often voluntary) reporting of adverse events associated with ABT, including ABT-related deaths. Such hemovigilance systems have been in place in various countries\u2014including France,14 the United Kingdom,15, 16 other European countries, and the province of Quebec17 in Canada. No coordinated hemovigilance system exists yet in the United States, although a pilot program was recently introduced.40 Moreover, the reporting of all identified transfusion-related deaths to the FDA has been required since 1976.1, 4, 18\n",

Awareness of the risk of TRALI in the United Kingdom may have thus preceded that in the United States by approximately 3 years, as did the policy to convert to male-only FFP. After the conversion, the annual number of deaths from TRALI reported to the United Kingdom SHOT system declined (Fig 6\n) until in 2008, for the first time since reporting to the SHOT system started in 1996, no death from TRALI was recorded in the United Kingdom. There were 3 nonfatal cases of TRALI reported in 2008, and all 3 were due to transfusion of FFP from female donors in England (where the use of male donors for FFP is not yet universal).16 By comparison, 7 of the 12 transfusion-related deaths reported to the United Kingdom SHOT system in 2003 had been due to TRALI.16\n",

The recording by the United Kingdom SHOT system of deaths from transfusion-acquired vCJD is due to the active surveillance efforts made in the United Kingdom to identify cases of transmission of vCJD through ABT. Thus, passive surveillance systems are likely to miss even some acute infections transmitted through ABT, as has been demonstrated for TAS,59 and was likely the case with some West Nile virus (WNV) infections occurring in New York in the summer of 1999 (when no transfusion-transmitted cases were reported) and with some dengue fever virus (DFV) infections occurring in endemic areas over many decades.",

Thus, the risk of contracting a TTI from a transfusion of n units (or from exposure to n donors) would equal 1 \u2212 (1 \u2212 p)n, where p is the per-unit probability of transmission of the emerging TTI. Because transfusion risks are very low (eg, 1 per 10 000 in the case of a future HIV-like agent), 1 \u2212 (1 \u2212 p)n approximates p times n, and the per-recipient risk can be calculated by multiplying the per-unit risk by the number of donors to whom a recipient is exposed.",

In 5 reviewed studies, the RBC contamination rate was 0.1% (60/61 136),9 probably because the 4\u00b0C storage temperature of RBCs inhibits bacterial growth during storage. Given that skin bacteria are the major sources of contamination, the difference between measured contamination rates in stored components and septic reactions in transfused patients likely can be explained by low-level contamination that does not evoke a clinical response, concomitant antibiotic therapy that blunts a clinical response, and/or failure to (correctly) attribute sepsis to the platelet transfusion in patients with neutropenia or fever.",

The reported rate of events (1 per 87 000) did not differ significantly from that in the previous period (1 per 75 000). Interestingly, 9 culture-negative single-donor components were passively reported to the ARC as having caused TAS during this latter period. Another estimate of the magnitude of the risk was reported from the Johns Hopkins Hospital that maintains active surveillance for TAS. One per 50 000 culture-negative single-donor platelet components caused TAS between March 1, 2004, and August 31, 2007.118 Only 1 episode of TAS occurred in this study, however, which predated the process improvements implemented by the ARC117 in 2007 to 2008.",

A second \u201chit\u201d is then mediated by biologic response modifiers contained in transfused plasma (eg, lipid-priming molecules found in the plasma supernatant of stored [as opposed to fresh] RBCs and platelets, cytokines, CD40 ligand, and/or WBC antibodies). These molecules activate the sequestered neutrophils to release oxidases and proteases that damage the endothelium and produce capillary leak and ALI.

Females who had never been pregnant, nontransfused males, and transfused males had the same prevalence of HLA antibodies. Transfusion alone did not result in increased prevalence of HLA antibodies. However, the time since the last transfusion in the donors enrolled in the Leukocyte Antibody Prevalence Study was very long (a median of 22 years). The study did not evaluate recently transfused donors who might have circulating HLA antibodies even if such antibodies fall to undetectable levels in a matter of months after ABT.147 The reason for the 1.0% and 1.7%, respectively, prevalence of HLA antibodies in nontransfused males and never-pregnant females is uncertain. They could represent false-positive results, antibodies cross-reacting with bacterial antigens, or immunization associated with vaccination.147\n",

Even in the recent literature, however, the Canadian consensus definition has not been consistently adhered to. For example, in a recent RCT150 of the efficacy of WBC-reduced blood components in preventing TRALI, none of the diagnoses of TRALI assigned in either arm of the trial pertained to ALI occurring within 6 hours of ABT.151 Because ALI is very common in critically ill multitransfused patients, many cases of ALI can be misdiagnosed as \u201cTRALI\u201d because of a temporal association with the transfusion. The demonstration of WBC incompatibility between an implicated donor and the recipient (as opposed to the mere presence of WBC antibodies in an implicated donor's serum) strengthens the evidence that a particular case of ALI (in which all consensus criteria11 have been met and the diagnosis of TRALI has been made before the laboratory workup) represents TRALI. However, whether TRALI is mediated by its own pathogenetic mechanisms (distinct from the generic mechanisms of ALI) remains unknown.152\n",

Seventy-four patients developed TRALI. Of these, 62% had another risk factor for ALI, highlighting the interaction between ABT, patient factors, and development of TRALI. This finding underscores the risk of ARDS (diagnosed as either ALI or TRALI) in critically ill patients with preexisting risk factors of ALI who receive transfusion of even a single-unit of blood.157 Gajic et al43 compared the 74 TRALI cases to 74 controls drawn from among the patients who did not develop worsening respiratory status within 24 hours of the ABT. The cases received more units from female donors and donors with more pregnancies, as well as more FFP and FFP from female donors with more pregnancies. In contrast, the number of RBC transfusions did not differ between the cases and controls. Both WBC antibodies and bioactive lipids accumulating during storage were higher in the components received by the cases than the controls.",

The WBC antibodies were not associated with TRALI in the multivariate analysis that included the various patient-related risk factors for ALI, yet the most straightforward opportunity for TRALI prevention would be the exclusion of female donors from making donations of FFP. The magnitude of the benefit derived from such a conversion to male-only FFP remains to be determined, but an improvement in blood safety even as small as that suggested by the Dutch data (ie, prevention of 25% of the overall TRALI cases and up to 30% of the overall TRALI deaths)148 would make the conversion to male-only FFP a worthwhile blood safety measure.",

Therefore, administrative systems have been developed to analyze errors and prevent their future recurrence.161 Moreover, because proper identification of the transfusion recipient is crucial, barrier systems intended to physically prevent the transfusion of blood without correct identification of the patient have been devised. These include a plastic lock that must be unlocked by the entry of the correct identification code,162 use of a special wristband for identification of transfusion recipients,163, 164 multiple barcodes (on patient wristbands, blood sample tubes, blood component bags, and nurses' identification badges) along with point-of-transfusion reading devices to verify identity,165, 166 as well as other similar approaches.167, 168 These tools require investment in information technology, but they can be integrated with other systems such as medication administration. To guard against miscollection (or mislabeling) of the pretransfusion specimen, some US transfusion services require verification of the recipient's ABO group by the collection of 2 independent pretransfusion samples.169\n",

These investigators204, 205 demonstrated that plasma obtained from stored RBCs primes neutrophils for superoxide production and enhanced cytotoxicity and also activates pulmonary endothelial cells in a dose- and age-dependent fashion. The length of RBC storage was important in these studies because no evidence of neutrophil priming was obtained when plasma stored for short periods was used.

Transfused RBCs have a relatively short life span compared with the approximately 120-day life span of normal RBCs. Transfused RBCs undergo erythrophagocytosis, with release of iron that eventually overloads macrophages. When this excess iron reenters the plasma, it overwhelms the iron-carrying capacity of transferrin and is deposited in tissues as free iron. Increased iron levels become detectable 17 to 22 days after RBC transfusion. Iron overload from long-term transfusions damages the liver, heart, pancreas, thyroid, and other endocrine glands.",

They offered the hypothesis that the observed decrease in the number of deaths might have been due to a proinflammatory microvascular effect of transfused WBCs that affects several organ systems. This hypothesis was buttressed by the findings of a companion before and after study in premature infants.228 In that setting, the implementation of universal WBC reduction coincided with a reduction in several secondary morbidity outcomes from several organ systems (ie, bronchopulmonary dysplasia, retinopathy of prematurity, necrotizing enterocolitis)\u2014an observation consistent with a diffuse proinflammatory microvascular effect of allogeneic WBCs (or their products).

If it is confirmed by future RCTs, it would suggest that, for every 16.9 patients receiving ABT per liberal criteria (for a hemoglobin level falling to 10 g/dL or less, as opposed to falling to 7 g/dL or less), 1 patient might die during her/his hospitalization because of the excess RBC transfusions received (Fig 10).

If the low-dose arm in this clinical setting needs platelet transfusions every 1.8 \u00b1 1.1 days,259 however, it should be possible to devise an inventory management practice whereby the second half of a single-donor platelet concentrate is administered to the same patient when the subject is an in-patient and requires a second platelet transfusion within the shelf life of the product. (According to many clinicians, outpatients might be better off receiving the standard dose to maximize the interval between platelet transfusions.) In this manner, by relying exclusively on split apheresis platelet concentrates, the 9% reduction in the total number of transfused platelets (P = .02) demonstrated by the PLADO RCT257 could translate into a clinically significant reduction in the number of donor exposures for hemato-oncology patients supported with prophylactic platelet transfusions at half the dose that is currently regarded as \u201cstandard.\u201d",

Moreover, even the PR methods under development could not protect the blood supply from all the emerging agents prioritized by the AABB Task Force.29 For example, of the agents listed in that report,29 pathologic prions, human parvovirus B19, and hepatitis A virus would not be inactivated or would probably be inadequately inactivated by PR. It should also be borne in mind that the very concept of emerging infections is that their evolution and manifestations, as well as the properties of the associated pathogen, are intrinsically unpredictable. This is because PR procedures are almost always validated against transfusion-transmitted agents that are already known.276 Thus, emerging infections may be neither inactivated by PR nor associated with specific high-risk groups whose deferral from blood donation could prevent transmission to transfusion recipients. The latter would be the case if the next major transfusion-transmitted pathogen to emerge were foodborne (such as vCJD), vector-borne (such as WNV), or even airborne (such as Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome).102, 277\n",

Some observers have reasoned that because 12.5% of therapeutic platelet doses continue to be provided as pooled whole blood\u2013derived platelets in the United States,56 1 to 2 TRALI fatalities ascribed to pooled whole blood\u2013derived platelets should have been passively reported to the FDA between 2004 and 2008 if transfusion of platelet pools was indeed associated with a risk of fatal TRALI. Alternatively, the absence of any such fatalities1 may be due to chance because such reported deaths represent exceedingly rare events.

The absence of reported deaths from both TAS and TRALI in association with the transfusion of pooled whole blood\u2013derived platelets not subjected to culture supports the hypothesis that pooled whole blood\u2013derived platelets in the United States are likely administered in environments with less monitoring of transfusion reactions and less access to transfusion medicine expertise.

The contribution of PR to safety can be only suboptimal if PR technology cannot simultaneously also be applied to RBCs, with the latter continuing to transmit pathogens to transfusion recipients. Also, until there is a comprehensive system of PR that also encompasses RBCs, permitting various cost-savings from the possible discontinuation of other safety measures, the cost of PR is bound to be incremental and substantial.289 However, many patients receive repeated platelet transfusions only intermittently accompanied by RBC transfusions, and\u2014however medically inappropriate241\u2014platelet and/or FFP transfusions are often given \u201cprophylactically\u201d to patients scheduled to undergo bedside or invasive procedures because of a moderately lowered platelet count or moderately elevated INR.",

Transfusion should never be considered inherently \u201csafe\u201d nor administered prophylactically without evidence of its efficacy to improve oxygen consumption by tissues or prevent hemorrhage. Although acknowledging that a \u201czero\u201d risk is not an attainable goal, discussions of recent progress in blood safety should not detract attention from the fact that more needs to be done, or lessen the sense of urgency for us to continue to strive for an \u201cas low as reasonably achievable\u201d301 risk. In this spirit, we have proposed 6 strategies for further risk reduction that\u2014with the exception of PR technologies for plasma and platelets that are not yet available in the United States\u2014are, in our opinion, ripe for implementation.",

Because HLA antibodies are present in the serum of 24.4% of women who have previously been pregnant,13 and multitransfused patients are likely to have received some blood components from previously pregnant female donors, such recipients will be likely found to have received components from donors whose plasma contains WBC antibodies, regardless of whether TRALI is (or is not) present. Therefore, female donors and WBC antibodies are likely to be spuriously associated with TRALI when the results of such laboratory tests are considered in making the diagnosis. Such spurious associations may have been the origin of TRALI in some of the cases included in series compiled by blood suppliers on the basis of passive surveillance reports received from hospitals when the recipient's serum was no longer obtainable. For these reasons, the consensus criteria11 require that the diagnosis of TRALI be made clinically, without considering the results of laboratory tests. Provided that the diagnosis of TRALI has been made in this manner,11 the further designation of alloimmune TRALI should be reserved for cases of proven WBC incompatibility between an implicated donor and the relevant cognate recipient WBC antigen. In the case of common WBC antigens (and antibodies), even WBC incompatibility between an implicated donor(s) and the recipient can occur by chance. Thus, although such WBC incompatibility strengthens the belief in the correctness of the diagnosis in the appropriate clinical setting, it should not be used as the basis for the diagnosis.",
