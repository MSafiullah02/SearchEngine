IgG transfer occurs via a receptor-mediated transcytosis across the syncytiotrophoblast and a transcellular pathway through the fetal endothelium (Leach et al., 1990). Human placental transfer of protective IgG antibodies to a number of pathogens, including hepatitis B (Hockel and Kaufman, 1986), measles (Lennon and Black, 1986), and group B streptococcus (Baker et al., 1988), has been reported. This process suggests an effective method of neonatal immunization, i.e., immunization of the pregnant mother in order to protect the neonate. Prenatal transfer of IgG in the rabbit occurs via the yolk sac, and in the guinea pig, via both the yolk sac and fetal gut (Waldman and Strober, 1969).",

There is a gradual decrease in transmission over the last 3 days (Waldman and Strober, 1969), and transmission is limited to antibodies of the IgG class (Appleby and Catty, 1983; Hammerberg et al., 1977). Transport is a receptor-mediated process (Simister and Rees, 1983). In rats, the receptor (FcRn) is found in enterocytes of the proximal intestine during the early postnatal period but is absent after weaning (Jakoi et al., 1985). FcRn is specific for IgG and its Fc fragment and consists of two similar polypeptides of 48,000 to 52,000 daltons (p51) in association with \u03b22 microglobulin (Jakoi et al., 1985; Simister and Mostov, 1989). The Fc binding subunit (p51) has three extracellular domains and a transmembrane region that are all homologous to the corresponding domains of class I major histocompatibility complex (MHC) antigens (Simister and Mostov, 1989). Junghans and Anderson (1996) have shown that disruption of the FcRn in knockout mice also destroys the receptor (FcRp) necessary for the prolonged half-life of serum IgG in adults, suggesting that the same receptor protein that mediates transient IgG transport across the neonatal gut functions as the FcRp throughout life.",

Transport of colostral proteins from the lumen of the ileum in ruminants is largely nonspecific, but in the horse and the pig, IgG and IgM are preferentially absorbed. Proteins are actively taken up by epithelial cells through pinocytosis and passed through these cells into the lacteals and intestinal capillaries (Tizzard, 1987). Intestinal absorption occurs for only the first 24 to 48 hours after birth. Following this, the \u201copen gut\u201d closes down, and no further transfer from milk or colostrum occurs (Ellis et al., 1986; Francis and Black, 1984; Tizzard, 1987; Waldman and Strober, 1969). Newborn piglets have also been shown to absorb colostral lymphoid cells during this period (Tuboly et al., 1988). It is unclear whether these cells are fully functional and capable of immune processes such as the transfer of delayed-type hypersensitivity (DTH).",

About 25% of newborn foals fail to obtain sufficient quantities of immunoglobulin (McGuire et al., 1975; Tizzard, 1987). In the McGuire study (1975), two of nine foals affected by FPT died of infections within a few days of birth, and five of the remaining seven developed nonfatal respiratory infections between 2 and 5 weeks of age. McGuire et al. (1976) also reported FPT in calves, finding that 85% of calves less than 3 weeks old dying from infectious diseases have significant hypogammaglobulinemia.

Mucosal immunity to rotavirus, for example, was shown to be transferred to the infant by the S-IgA in milk; there was a positive correlation between titers of secretory component (SC) in the mother's milk and the infant's feces vs. virus-specific IgA in the infant's fecal samples (Rahman et al., 1987). In addition to providing passive mucosal immunity, human breast milk also stimulates the early local production of S-IgA in the urinary and gastrointestinal tracts, thereby accelerating the development of an active local host defense in the infant (Koutras and Vigorita, 1989; Prentice, 1987).",

In humans the amount of IgA acquired from the plasma is low (only 2%) compared with the amount acquired from local production (Delacroix et al., 1982). Transfer of pIgA from the plasma into canine or murine saliva is a selective process requiring the pIgR (Montgomery et al., 1987; Falero-Diaz et al., 2000), while transport into oral fluids in monkeys appears to be by leakage from the plasma into the crevicular spaces surrounding the deciduous molars (Challacombe et al., 1978).",

Other investigators (Koertge and Butler, 1986b; Russell et al., 1982), using assays based on antibody-binding activity, were unable to show transport of IgA into murine milk. Using radiolabeled IgA, Koertge and Butler (1986b) were able to show that the IgA present in milk was degraded and suggested that the previous study (Halsey et al., 1983) detected only IgA fragments that had been transudated into the milk from the serum and not specifically transported IgA. Passively administered IgA is not transported into the milk of rats (Dahlgren et al., 1981; Koertge and Butler, 1986b).",

This difference may reflect an increased contribution of serum antibody due to the transudation of IgG into alveolar fluids. Transport of pIgA into the gut was four to five times more efficient than the transport of mIgA, as expected. The agreement of the nasal secretion and gut transport indices suggests that transport at these two sites could occur by a similar mechanism.

(1994) determined that passively administered monoclonal pIgA isotype-switch variants, generated from IgG hybridomas producing antibodies specific for bacterial respiratory tract pathogens, were selectively transported relative to IgG into both the upper and lower respiratory tract secretions of mice. In agreement with the results of Renegar and Small (1991a), Falero-Diaz et al.

In contrast to Steinmetz et al. (1994) but in agreement with Mazanec et al. (1989), the Falero-Diaz group found efficient transmission of IgG but not of pIgA into the lungs of mice.

They showed, as described above, that intravenously administered pIgA is transported into nasal secretions. To determine whether intravenously administered pIgA anti-influenza monoclonal antibody could mediate protection against local influenza virus challenge, passively immunized mice were challenged intranasally while awake with influenza virus. Twenty-four hours later the mice were sacrificed and the amount of virus shed in their nasal secretions was determined. Of the 24 saline-injected control mice, 23 shed virus into the nasal secretions, while only 5 of the 25 pIgA injected mice shed virus, and those 5 that did shed virus had a low titer. The observed protection was significant (p < 0.001). Passive immunization with influenza-specific pIgA therefore conferred complete protection against viral infection in 80% of the mice and partial protection in the remaining 20%. Serum IgG was found to confer only limited protection against nasal influenza infection (minimal reduction in viral shedding [p < 0.02], with only one of eight mice intravenously injected with influenza-specific IgG not shedding virus [p < 0.5]).",

To confirm that IgA is the mediator of local immunity, mice passively immunized with pIgA were given nose drops of anti-IgA antibody 10 minutes before and 6 hours after they were challenged intranasally with influenza virus suspended in anti-IgA antiserum. Anti-IgA treatment abrogated IgA-mediated protection in the passively immunized mice (Renegar and Small, 1991a). To show that the passive transfer of local immunity by IgA was a reflection of the natural situation, the abrogation technique was extended to mice convalescent from influenza infection (Renegar and Small, 1991b). Nonimmune mice and convalescent mice, i.e., mice that had recovered from an influenza virus infection 4 to 6 weeks earlier and were therefore naturally immune, were treated intranasally with antiserum to IgA or IgG or with a mixture of antisera to IgG and IgM and then challenged while awake with influenza virus mixed with antiserum. Intranasal administration of antiserum was continued at intervals for 24 hours. One day after viral challenge, the mice were killed and their nasal washes were assayed for virus shedding. Nonimmune mice all became infected, regardless of whether the virus was administered in saline, normal rabbit serum, or anti-immunoglobulin antiserum. Convalescent mice, as expected, were protected from viral infection. Administration of influenza virus in either anti-IgG or a mixture of anti-IgG and anti-IgM antisera did not affect protection, i.e., the convalescent mice were still immune. Administration of virus in anti-IgA antiserum, however, abrogated convalescent immunity. These results demonstrate that IgA is a major mediator of murine nasal immunity and suggest that passive immunization mimics the role S-IgA plays in natural immunity. These observations were extended by the work of Philipon et al. (1995). Using the backpack method of monoclonal antibody administration, they demonstrated that monoclonal IgA antibody directed against Shigella flexneri serotype 5a lipopolysaccharide protects mice against intranasal challenge with S. flexneri.\n",

Mice unable to produce IgA antibodies were able to generate a protective anti-influenza response and to transport passively administered anti-influenza antibodies into both the upper and lower respiratory tracts. Knockout mice, however, may not be the best model in which to study the role of IgA in nasal immunity, because, with the congenital loss of IgA, production of other classes of antibody such as IgG may be increased as a compensatory mechanism. The data of Mbawuicke et al. suggest that this may be the case, as influenza-specific IgG levels were higher in immune knockout mice than in normal mice, and an altered IgG subclass distribution in response to influenza infection was observed (Harriman et al., 1999; Zhang et al., 2002). Furthermore, perturbation of mucosal IgA transport in the pIgR knockout mouse (Johansen et al., 1999) led to increased mucosal leakiness and increased serum total IgG levels, indicating a defect in the mucosal barriers. It is known (Renegar et al., 2004) that at a dose high enough to give a serum titer seven times the normal anti-influenza IgG titer of convalescent mice, intravenously administered influenza-specific IgG can lower or eliminate the nasal secretion viral load; however, scanning electron microscopy has revealed that even this high IgG dose does not prevent infection of the nasal epithelium. Thus, the lowered nasal secretion viral titers reported in IgG-protected mice may be due to neutralization of newly replicated virus by serum antibody leaking through the virally damaged epithelium. Furthermore, the serum anti-influenza IgG antibody titer has to be several times higher than that normally observed for the IgG effect to be observed, because serum antibody at a level comparable to that of normal convalescent mice neither depresses viral shedding nor prevents viral pathology in the nasal epithelium.",

In these mice, nasal influenza\u2013specific IgA was severely depressed (\nFig. 46.1B\n), while the serum anti-influenza IgG titer was unaffected (\nFig. 46.1C\n).

These antibodies were able to cross-link bacterial organisms in vitro, suggesting that they might be effective in preventing mucosal colonization by the pathogen in vivo.

The possibility of therapy by passively administered IgA antibody is more problematic. Passive protection by injection is highly speculative because of both the questionable efficiency of transport to the targeted mucosal surface and the potential adverse effects of intravenous IgA antibody. Serum IgA has been associated with both decreased complement activation (Russell et al., 1989) and decreased immune lysis (Griffiss and Goroff, 1983). Systematically administered pIgA may also be suppressive of both specific humoral and cellular responses (Renger and Small, unpublished observations). A more thorough knowledge of the role IgA can play in regulating the immune response is needed before intravenous passive mucosal immunization can become an acceptable means of therapy in man; however, the direct oral or respiratory application of antibodies to the mucosal surfaces is both practical and acceptable.",

IgA antibodies (IgAbulin), given as a nasal spray to the Swedish ski team during the Albertville Winter Olympic Games, significantly reduced the level of upper respiratory tract infections (Hammarstr\u00f6m et al., 1994); however, IgAbulin treatment had no effect on the frequency of upper respiratory tract symptoms in elite canoeists studied during hard and moderate training regimens (Lindberg and Berglund, 1996). IgAbulin nosedrop treatment of variable immunodeficiency patients who were chronic nasopharyngeal carriers of nonencapsulated Haemophilus influenzae eliminated the carrier state in 2 of 5 patients and alleviated coughing in all 5 (Lindberg et al., 1993). Heikkinen et al. (1998) treated 40 children aged 1 to 4 years intranasally with IgA or a placebo and found a 42% reduction in rhinitis in the IgA-treated group. Thus, intranasal instillation of antibodies is feasible and may prove to be effective in the management of immunosuppressed patients.",

A, Viral shedding: Following the surgical placement of intravenous catheters, influenza immune mice were fed mouse chow or intravenous TPN solution (IV-TPN). Nonimmune mice were fed chow. Following 5 days on their respective protocols, mice were challenged intranasally while awake (i.n.) with influenza virus and were assayed 42 hours later for the shedding of virus in their nasal secretions. This figure represents the pooled data from 17 experiments. Nonparametric statistical analysis: chow-fed immune vs. IV-TPN\u2013fed immune, p < 0.0001; chow-fed immune vs. nonimmune, p < 0.0001. B, Nasal IgA: Fifteen mice were infected i.n. while awake with PR8 (H1N1) influenza virus. Three weeks later, they underwent surgical instrumentation and were randomized to IV TPN feeding (n = 8) or chow feeding (n = 7). Following 5 days on protocol, the mice were sacrificed. Levels of influenza-specific IgA in nasal secretions were determined by ELISA and normalized to ng-specific IgA/100 \u03bcg nasal protein (chow vs IV TPN, P < 0.05, ANOVA). Influenza-specific IgA was undetectable in nonimmune mice. C, Influenza-specific serum IgG titers: Immune mice (n = 11) underwent instrumentation and were randomized to IV TPN feeding (n = 6) or chow feeding (n = 5). Following 5 days on protocol, mice were sacrificed and serum IgG anti-influenza titers and nasal viral shedding were determined. Antibody titers were the serum dilution with an ELISA absorbance reading of 0.200 or greater. The IgG titers were comparable in chow-fed and TPN-fed immune mice. All of the TPN-fed mice shed virus in their nasal secretions, while none of the chow-fed mice did so. D, Passive protection: Immune mice were fed on mouse chow or IV-TPN. Following 5 days on their respective protocols, the IV-TPN mice were divided into two groups. Nonimmune controls, (n = 5), the chow-fed immune mice (n = 5), and one of the IV-TPN groups (TPN-NMS, n = 4) received 400\u03bcl ascites fluid containing MOPC 315 (does not recognize influenza) pIgA monoclonal Ab IV. The second IV-TPN group (TPN-pIgA, n = 4) received 400 \u03bcl ascites fluid containing pIgA anti-influenza monoclonal Ab. Four hours later, all mice were challenged i.n. with PR8 influenza virus. After 48 hours, the mice were euthanized and their nasal secretions assayed for viral shedding. Nonparametric statistical analysis: nonimmune vs. TPN-NMS, p = NS; immune vs. TPN-pIgA, p = NS; nonimmune vs. immune chow-fed, p < 0.0001; nonimmune vs. TPN-pIgA, p < 0.0001.",
