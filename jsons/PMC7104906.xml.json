As shown by Crick and Watson, purines (A,G) pair with complementary pyrimidines (C,U), leading primarily to the pairs CG and AU. There exist also so-called wobble pairs of GU. Single stranded RNA is quite flexible with a Kuhn length of, depending on the ionic strength of the solution, one or two nm [2], and can form double helical stems (A helices) with a Kuhn length of about 140 nm [3, 4]. So, double stranded RNA is stiffer than double stranded DNA, which has a Kuhn length of 100 nm, noting that the Kuhn length is twice the persistence length of a so-valled wormlike chain.",

Pairing of bases can be represented by so-called arch diagrams. Nested arches represent helices, while crossings give rise to (the) so-called pseudoknots [5]. The nested pairings can be described quantitatively by recursion relations [6\u20138], which exactly sum all possible pairings without pseudoknots. From a geometrical point of view, the generated structures can be viewed as branched polymers.

Note that in the absence of genome, capsids do not form at physiological pH and salt concentrations. Many spherical viruses adopt structures with icosahedral symmetry [20, 21], which imposes a constraint on the number of subunits in capsids.

In this head-to-head competition, the amount of coat protein (CP) of CCMV was selected such that it could only encapsidate one of the genomes. Quite unexpectedly, the RNA1 of CCMV (the cognate RNA) lost to RNA1 of BMV, i.e. only RNA1 of BMV was encapsidated by CCMV CPs.

Mean-field calculations using annealed (equilibrium) branched polymers as model RNAs have also shown that the length of encapsidated polymer increases as the propensity to form larger numbers of branched points increases [32, 34, 35]. More importantly, these calculations show that a higher level of branching considerably increases the depth of the free-energy gain associated with the encapsulation of RNA by a positively charged shell. This implies that the efficiency of genome packaging goes up with increasing the level of branching, so with increasing compact secondary structure of the genome.",

Figures 1(a) and (b) illustrate the secondary structures of CCMV RNA and those of a randomly sequenced RNA with the same length.

They examined whether RNA topology, i.e. the secondary structure or level of branching, allows the viral RNA to be exclusively packaged by its cognate capsid proteins. More specifically, they studied the competition between CCMV viral RNA with polyU of equal number of nucleotides for virus capsid proteins. They find that CCMV CPs are capable of packaging polyU RNAs and, quite interestingly, polyU outcompetes the native CCMV RNA in a head-to-head competition for the capsid proteins. These findings are in sharp contrast with the previous experimental, theoretical, simulation and scaling studies noted above, which suggest that the branching and compactness of RNA must lead to a more efficient capsid assembly. That being said, the scaling theory of [41] already hints at the subtle interplay between Kuhn length, solvent quality and linear charge density dictating the free energy gain of encapsulation.",

The average duplex length of viral RNA is about six nucleotide pairs [11], which corresponds to about five nm. This value is much smaller than the persistence length of double stranded RNA [36], suggesting that viral RNA can be modeled as a flexible polymer with an average Kuhn length of about six paired nucleotides. There are of course also loop sequences that in our model act as end, hinge and branching points, but how this translates into an effective Kuhn length for the entire branched chain representation of the RNA is unclear. Plausibly, the effective Kuhn length of the internally hybridized chain should be larger than that of the equivalent unstructured non-hybridized chain. Furthermore, another major difference between the linear and branched (base-paired) ssRNA structures seems to be the linear charge density, which doubles for the latter on account of base pairing (hybredization).",

We find that as we increase the chain stiffness or Kuhn length the free energy of encapsulation of RNA becomes less negative than that of a linear chain, at least under certain conditions. Hence, a larger Kuhn length, associated with base-pairing, might decrease the efficiency of packaging of RNA compared to a linear polymer. In contrast, our results indicate that increasing the linear charge density improves the efficiency of packaging of both linear and branched polymers. Thus base-pairing has two competing effects: it makes the chain stiffer, which increases the work required to encapsidate the chain, but at the same time it increases the linear charge density that lowers the encapsidation free energy and augment the packaging efficiency. These results are consistent with the experiments of Beren et al [40], in which the linear RNA, PolyU, outcompetes the cognate RNA of CCMV when they are both in solution with a limited amount of capsid proteins of CCMV, that is, sufficient to encapsidate either PolyU or CCMV RNA but not both.",

In general the duplexed segments of viral RNA contain on average about five to six base-pairs [11]. Note that some studies show that viral RNAs must have between 60 and 70 % of their nucleotides in duplexes, so the linear charge density is almost a factor of two larger and the effective chain length about twice shorter [59]. We argue that while the base pairing on the one hand makes the RNA more compact, on the other hand it increases the effective Kuhn length or the statistical length of the polymer unit. This leads to an increase in the work of compaction of the flexible chain by capsid proteins, which is directly related to the encapsidation free energy of the polymer as plotted in figure 5. We emphasize again that the findings of this paper is not in contradiction with the previous studies: The more strongly branched a polymer is, the more competitive it becomes to be encapsidated by capsid proteins. However, in this work we show that because of base-pairing, the RNA also becomes stiffer and under appropriate conditions can no longer outcompete the linear polymer for binding to capsid proteins.",

Figure 6 shows that as the charge density of branched polymer increases (dotted lines), their free energy decreases. The more distance between the dots, the higher the charge density of the branched polymer. Quite interestingly, the figure shows that the effect of stiffness overshadows the impact of charge density.

These examples do not correspond to \u2018real\u2019 RNA as it is not possible to increase the number of charges to more than 2e per base pair, but they clarify that base-pairing has three competing effects. First, it makes RNA stiffer, which increases the work of encapsidation but, second, in parallel gives rise to the branching effect and, third, a higher charge density, which both lowers the encapsidation free energy and enhances the packaging efficiency of RNA by capsid proteins.",

We found that our conclusion is robust and that the excluded volume interaction only slightly modifies the boundary in the parameter space where the linear polymers are able to outcompete the branched ones. The results of this study can explain the intriguing findings of the experiments of Beren et al [40] in which the unstructured polyU RNA is preferentially packaged and outcompetes native RNA CCMV, despite the fact that viral RNAs have more branch points and as such have a more compact structure. Last but not least, we note that the interaction of RNA with capsid proteins could modify the preferred curvature of proteins and result into the capsid of different sizes and T numbers as demonstrated in [40]. However, since very little is known about this effect, in this paper we exclusively focused on the impact of RNA stiffness resulting from its base pairing in the RNA encapsidation free energy.",

The conclusion of previous works that the more branched an RNA is on account of its secondary, base-paired structure, the larger the competitive edge it has to be encapsulated in the presence of coat proteins needs to be refined. Under appropriate conditions of linear charge density and effective chain stiffness, we find that a linear chain may in fact outcompete even the native RNA of a virus, as was recently also shown experimentally. Of course, our conclusions are based on coarse-grained model in which the RNA binding domains of the coat proteins are represented by a smooth, uniformly charged wall. In future work we intend to more realistically model these polycationic tails that form a complex with the polynucleotide. Of particular interest here is the impact of excluded volume interactions between these tails and the polynucleotide.",
