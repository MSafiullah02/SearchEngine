The causative agent is influenza A virus (IAV), which is an orthomyxovirus with eight negative-sense single-stranded RNA genome segments, coding for at least 13 proteins2. On the basis of the cross-reactivity of antibodies (Ab) specific for the IAV membrane glycoproteins hemagglutinin (H1-18) and neuraminidase (N1-11), the viruses are classified in different subtypes. Owing to their genetic and phylogenetic divergence, the bat-specific H17N10 and H18N11 constitute a special group within the influenza A genus, leading to the term \u201cinfluenza A-like virus\u201d3,4. These differences include an incompatibility of the bat influenza package sequences (PS) with conventional IAVs5.",

Characteristic for all HPAIVs is a polybasic proteolytic cleavage site in the HA protein6. In 1997, the first HPAIV H5N1 virus emerged and, besides poultry, infected humans including fatal cases7. The original H5N1 viruses have further diversified over the time, and new viruses have emerged by replacing the N1 encoding gene segment via reassortment with N2, N3, N5, N6, N8, or N9 gene segments8. Between January 2013 and August 2018, several HPAIV subtypes caused the loss of 122 million domestic birds globally, with H5N1 having a big share9. As HPAIV now is endemic in many countries10,11, causing considerable economic damage, the risk of zoonotic spillover events is eminent12,13.",

In comparison to the economic losses caused by these measures9, effective vaccination could help to prevent disease spread and further zoonotic spillover infections14. Countries where HPAIV is endemic like China, Egypt, or Indonesia already have used inactivated influenza vaccines (IIVs) or vector vaccines, mostly in case of emergency response10. A recent and successful example is the vaccination campaign against the H7N9 HPAIV which emerged in China in 201715,16. The mass vaccination of poultry in China, using a recombinant bivalent H5/H7 IIV, led to a marked drop in human spillover infections from 1567 cases (615 fatal) in the season 2016/2017 to only three reported cases in the season 2017/201814.",

            "text": "However, there are experiments which indicate that influenza live vaccines can \u201celicit higher levels of innate responses, mucosal IgA antibodies, and heterologous protection in 1-day-old chickens compared to IIV\u201d17. Modified live influenza vaccines (MLIV) are able to induce a broad humoral (systemic and mucosal) and cellular immune response. Mimicking a natural infection and stimulating the immune system more broadly is advantageous for MLIVs17,18. The avian IIVs Ab response is mainly based on a systemic IgY, the avian counterpart to mammalian IgG, whereas MLIVs induce also mucosal IgA secretion in the upper respiratory tract contributing to their efficiency18. A major advantage of MLIVs is the possibility of oral application, which allows easy mass vaccination as done for other live vaccines, e.g. against Newcastle disease19,20. The current MLIVs are based on apathogenic influenza viruses, and attenuation is, e.g. achieved by using truncated NS1 proteins21 or restricted replication capacities due to cold-adaptation22 or the introduction of elastase-specific cleavage sites into the HA precursor protein23. Although cold-adapted MLIVs have been licensed for several years for use in humans, there are no MLIVs licensed for poultry yet, and only two types of vector-based live vaccines are on the market18. These vector-based vaccines could induce a broader protection than IIVs, but it is still difficult to express more than the HA protein in the vector backbone, as it is known that also the neuraminidase (NA), the matrix protein (M2), and the nucleoprotein (NP) are beneficial for a broader and more effective immunity24. In addition, preexisting immunity to the used vector viruses limits the efficacy of these vaccines17. Of course, apathogenicity and efficacy of MLIVs in day-old chicks is an issue17,25, mainly due to their immature immune system26,27. However, early immunization enhances the chances to prevent an infection. Therefore, vaccination of day-old chicks is a very interesting application, and it has been shown that MLIVs are more effective than IIVs for the immunization of young individuals17,28.",

The World Organization for Animal Health (OIE) does not recommend the use of influenza live vaccines due to the risk of reassortment29. There are different research attempts to generate reassortment incompatible vaccines: Chimeric influenza B viruses (IBV) were constructed, which carry the HA segment of IAVs with IBV packaging sequences (PS) and therefore do not reassort with IAVs30. These chimeric viruses efficiently protected mice against lethal IAV infection30. In a second approach the PS were switched between the HA and the non-structural protein (NS) gene segment; preventing reassortment of these segments31. None of these approaches has been tested in poultry or ferrets so far. Chickens are used by default for pathogenicity and vaccine efficacy studies for poultry32. Ferrets are the mammalian counterpart, used for vaccine safety evaluation33.",

However, the naive chickens serving as positive controls demonstrated slightly higher viral RNA loads than vaccinated individuals did (Fig. 3c).

Three and four days post CI, individual animals of both groups displayed weak-positive RNA loads (>33.3) until all samples tested negative from 5 dpc onward (Fig. 3c). Viral organ loads following CI can indicate ongoing but unrecognized infections. Animals were killed dpc7, and conchae tissue, brain, heart, and lung samples were taken individually. The samples from brain, heart, and lung were negative from all animals in both groups (Fig. 3e, f). Conchae samples exhibited viral RNA in two samples from subadult chicken, and in one sample from the juvenile group (Fig. 3e). In order to distinguish between PCR-positive but non-infectious samples and samples exhibiting infectious challenge virus, all PCR-positive swab and organ samples collected following CI underwent a cultivation attempt using SPF eggs.

Ferrets were confirmed to be seronegative for IAV antibodies at d0, using a NP-specific ELISA test (Fig. 6a, b). Ten days after PI (d10), all vaccinated ferrets displayed a statistically significant (p-value < 0.0001) seroconversion (Fig. 6a). The level of NP-specific Ab remained stable also 12 days after BI (d22) and 6 days after CI (dpc6). Interestingly, one sentinel ferret tested seropositive at d22 and the following time points, whereas for the other two, the S/N value noticeable decrease (Fig. 6b). The H5-response of vaccinated ferrets was significantly boosted (p-value 0.0003) following BI, leading to seroconversion on d22 (Fig. 6c). The CI did not further affect the H5-specific antibody levels of the vaccinated animals. Although all sentinels were still seronegative 10 days after PI, one animal was tested positive animal 12 days after BI (d22), and two contact ferrets were positive 6 days post CI (dpc6). The H5-specific antibody response of the ferrets compared with the NP-specific response exhibited a delayed phenotype. These results indicate that R65mono/H17N10 is able to induce a pronounced NP-specific immune response ten days after the first mucosal immunization in ferrets, whereas the H5-specific response was delayed reaching comparable levels only following boost immunization (Fig. 6c). Transmission of the R65mono/H17N10 vaccine virus from vaccinated to sentinel animals was demonstrated by the fact that one sentinel was seropositive for NP- and H5-Ab 8 days after BI (d22) (Fig. 6b, d).",

Therefore, replication and transmission of the vaccine virus prototype from the ferret upper respiratory tract is obviously possible. These results indicate that the chimeric strain R65mono/H17N10 is, probably due to the mammalian bat influenza backbone, still more efficient replicating in mammalian than in avian animals. However, after challenge infection none of the nasal washing samples of the vaccinated ferrets tested positive nor did any of the organ samples taken at dpc6. The prime-boost application of riMLIV to ferrets therefore also induced a sterile immunity against a homologous challenge infection, and a good immunity could be expected even after a single shot application, while cross-protection potential does not seem to be exceptional, as shown for H5N8 by in vitro cross-reactivity studies.",

These differences might be caused by a reduced overall sensitivity of the NP-ELISA for the distantly related NP protein of H17N10, or a limited replication of the chimeric virus in chicken resulting in the induction of higher levels of HA- than NP-specific antibodies. The latter is supported by the stronger NP-reaction in the ferret experiment where the more efficient replication induced a more pronounced NP-specific response.",

Thus, serological responses appear less well pronounced. In contrast, the serological response in ferrets was prominent, with high levels of NP-specific and increased H5-specific Ab in the aftermath of PI.

It is known that live influenza vaccines can induce protection by induction of mucosal IgA after local application, and CD4+ and CD8+ T cell responses44. Furthermore, T cell subsets and IgA, IgM, and IgG have been shown to be located at the mucosal surface within the nasal-associated lymphoid tissue (NALT) of chickens45. Therefore, the level of protection cannot directly be correlated to the humoral antibody titers17,46 after immunization with modified live virus vaccines. This is in contrast to IIVs, where protection was mediated by the humoral response only17,47. In addition, day-old chicks do not produce sufficient amounts of antibodies until the age of ~7 days26,27. The sterile protection in chicks resulting from the riMLIV prototype is particularly impressive knowing these limitations. In this context, further investigations on non-humoral immunity are necessary. Finally, we cannot formerly exclude that antiviral immune responses contributed to the protective effect of vaccination, however, the challenge infection here was always several weeks after the first vaccination and several days after booster immunization. Such innate immune responses are rather short-lived antiviral countermeasures of the host, which might not act at later time points.",
