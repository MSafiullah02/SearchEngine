The patient did not have any significant comorbidities or contributory travel history. He was tested for several viral pathogens using a respiratory viral panel by PCR and was found to be negative for all of them (Figure 1\n). A chest X-ray was ordered and initially read as normal (Figure 2\n). However, in retrospect, there is a suggestion of subsegmental ground glass opacities beginning to become apparent given the onset of symptoms 7 days prior to admission. Of note, there is no evidence of lymphadenopathy or pleural effusions on this chest X-ray. While most patients imaged at 0-2 days after symptom onset had normal imaging, studies have shown limited specificity in diagnosing lower respiratory tract illnesses with chest X-ray [1].",

There have been several publications that indicate a role for chest CT in early detection of COVID-19 when combined with clinical suspicion and high pretest probability [3]. For example, one study published in the American Journal of Roentgenology on February 20, 2020 found that there was a low miss rate for COVID-19 on chest CT (3.9% 2/51 cases). Therefore, a negative chest CT may assist in management by allowing physicians to determine whether quarantine is warranted when the patient is within the incubation window [4]. However, in mid-March of 2020, the ACR issued an official statement on this topic and acknowledged that under current shortages and delays in testing: \"some medical practices are requesting chest CT to inform decisions on whether to test a patient for COVID-19, admit a patient or provide other treatment. The ACR strongly urges caution in taking this approach. A normal chest CT does not mean a person does not have COVID-19 infection - and an abnormal CT is not specific for COVID-19 diagnosis. A normal CT should not dissuade a patient from being quarantined or provided other clinically indicated treatment when otherwise medically appropriate [5].\"",

In 2004, after SARS-CoV-1, postmortem histological examinations revealed that there were features of diffuse alveolar damage (DAD) in all patients, pronounced pulmonary edema, and hyaline membrane formation. Changes of fibrosis, including focal honeycombing fibrosis, were also found in what would now be considered the progressive stages, peak stages, and absorption stages [10]. However, the role that fibrosis plays in prognostication has been controversial. For example, one study suggested that patients with fibrous stripes and lesions are forming these during healing and that fibrosis could indicate stabilization. Another study suggested that fibrosis could indicate a poor outcome in the case of SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) and, when seen in earlier stages, could imply an impending progression to the peak stage [11].",

It also highlights the necessity of recognizing the patterns of COVID-19 infection in the early phase if presented with that opportunity. The management implications for identifying common features of viral pneumonia are becoming more clear. Further, it is not entirely unprecedented for radiologists to need to be this specific about an organism on imaging as the accurate diagnosis of tuberculosis carries a similar importance. However, tuberculosis is not as common and it is possible that this will be considered the tuberculosis of this generation of radiologists. One of the most common arguments for not utilizing CT chest for this diagnosis remains the nonspecific features of COVID-19 suggesting the overlap with other peripherally based airspace patterns such as organizing pneumonia. However, at the time of this submission, the chest CT is one of the primary tools used for diagnosis of symptomatic COVID-19 infection along with rRT-PCR and clinical symptoms. It seems practical that identifying and documenting the pertinent negatives of viral pneumonia well enough to suspect COVID-19 infection will remain an important role for the radiologist. Additionally, patients may have comorbidities that can decrease the specificity of chest CT for COVID-19, but this appears to represent a time where advanced cooperation between the radiologist and clinician is one of the most important factors in ascertaining an accurate diagnosis.",

Deep learning algorithms have already shown some success in rapidly identifying patterns associated with this infection via the COVID-19 detection neural network (COVNet) [12]. Additionally, at the time of this submission, there is an ACR Data Science Institute use case for artificial intelligence algorithms which addresses the pertinent findings of COVID-19. The ACR Data Science Institute use cases are created by radiologists and are meant to be used as open-source guidelines for data scientists who wish to design neural network architecture to identify features or patterns of radiographic pathology [13].",
