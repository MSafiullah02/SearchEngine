MODS was defined by an increased SOFA score of at least two organ systems. Pneumonia was diagnosed when the patient met the following criteria: new or progressive pulmonary infiltrates on a chest radiograph with fever (temperature > 38.3 \u00b0C) or leucocytes < 4000 cells/mm3 or > 12,000 cells/mm3 and at least two of the following signs: new or changed production of purulent sputum; new or worsening dyspnoea or cough; declining oxygenation or increased oxygen requirement or need for respiratory assistance [20].

In the study by Cook et al., the correlation between TBI and post-traumatic complications was based on the Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) and not on the AIShead as in our study [31]. The GCS in trauma patients often depends on the time of evaluation and can also change during the hospital stay in patients with severe traumatic brain injury, which might explain the different findings of our study and Cook\u2019s. Further, Hui et al. described how patients sustaining a TBI often require mechanical ventilation, and they demonstrated that this mechanical ventilation increases the risk of pneumonia in these patients, not the TBI itself [32].

Based on both the aforementioned relevance of the different injury patterns and the slightly enhanced risk profile of group poly-trauma IV (TBI + chest trauma) compared to group poly-trauma II (chest trauma) in our study, it is likely that chest trauma per se increases the risk of pneumonia; whereas, TBI exerts its effects mainly via a prolongation of mechanical ventilation.",

Hui et al. demonstrated in their study that each additional day of mechanical ventilation increased the risk of pneumonia by 7% [32]. Further, another study found that mechanical ventilation was the most powerful risk factor for in-hospital infectious complications of ICU patients after trauma, such as pneumonia, urinary tract infection and ARDS [27]. The most likely reason for the high incidence of pneumonia in the trauma population is that the artificial airway, which is often required for a prolonged ( > 48 h) period in these patients [34, 35], obliterates the natural host defences against the tracheal colonization, besides an immunity suppression induced by the injury [5, 11].",

[38] focused on the relevance of TBI in patients with isolated head trauma and in poly-trauma patients and found no influence of pneumonia on mortality. As we found chest injuries to be more relevant for the development of post-traumatic pneumonia, the focus on TBI in the study by Zygun et al. might result in these different findings. Rello et al. [37] described a relatively low pneumonia-related mortality rate (3.1%) in a rather small cohort of severely injured patients (n = 161). As other studies with a significantly higher number of included patients (e.g. n = 1227 [33]) also described a relevant effect of pneumonia on mortality, the size of the study population might represent an issue. Moreover, the study by Rello was performed 25 years ago, and it might be assumed that options for other potentially lethal complications (e.g. sepsis, TBI) were not as good as today, thereby resulting in a lower pneumonia-related mortality rate.",

            "text": "TBI alone is also an independent predictor of in-hospital mortality in poly-traumatized patients. The study by Yucel et al., who found an even greater odds ratio for TBI as a risk factor for mortality, strongly supports our results [39]. This result is not unexpected, as even isolated TBI is considered one of the most lethal traumatic injuries, as illustrated by the study by Para et al. [40]. Combined with a chest injury, TBI is an even stronger independent predictor of in-hospital mortality, although chest injury by itself is not an independent predictor in our study. To our opinion, this shows that TBI and chest injury are synergistic in their effect on in-hospital mortality. Our finding that severe chest injury is correlated with in-hospital complication rates in poly-traumatized patients, but has no influence on mortality rate, is supported by the results of the study of Grubm\u00fcller et al. [25]. In opposition, Chen et al. showed that patients with a higher chest trauma score had a greater prevalence of mortality [28], but this chest trauma score also included factors other than chest injuries (e.g. age). Therefore, this scoring system does not allow a conclusion to be drawn on the relevance of chest trauma as an independent factor for mortality.",

Our finding that severe TBI is associated with an increased duration of both ICU treatment and mechanical ventilation in severely injured patients is supported by the literature. In this context, different studies, as well as the present study, have demonstrated that severe TBI usually is associated with prolonged recovery periods, prolonged stays on the ICU and longer durations of mechanical ventilation [46]. This has been explained by the fact that TBI is usually associated with injuries of other body regions and emergency surgical interventions, aggravating the patient\u2019s condition and prolonging their recovery [2, 47].",

Although we also did not find a significant effect of chest trauma on the clinical course, it seems worth noting that an additional prolongation of ICU treatment and mechanical ventilation in patients with combined TBI and chest trauma was observed in our study.

Focusing on the strengths, we did not lose patients in the follow-up period, as only in-hospital complications were assessed. In addition, the single-centre character might represent an advantage of this study as it excludes bias due to differences in treatment strategies in diverse hospitals. In contrast, this study is limited due to its retrospective design. Further, with 467 patients, the statistical results might be compromised compared to nationwide databases. Finally, the pathophysiology of in-hospital complications (e.g. MODS and ARDS) is multifactorial. However, the presented regression analyses in our study can only represent a statistical model focused on a limited number of included parameter. Diverse parameter that was not included in this study might also have a considerable impact on in-hospital complications.",

Although chest injury is not an independent predictor of mortality, it is an independent predictor of pneumonia and thereby may have an indirect influence on in-hospital mortality. The combination of chest injury and TBI is also an independent predictor of pneumonia. Chest trauma seems to represent a direct risk factor, whereas TBI acts as an indirect risk factor via a prolonged duration of ventilation, which is by itself an independent predictor of pneumonia in poly-traumatized patients. Based on our results, the development of strategies to prevent pneumonia and a prolonged ventilation period in severely injured patients should be prioritized in the clinical setting.",
