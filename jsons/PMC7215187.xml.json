EEZ is an area beyond the territorial sea, extending seaward to a distance of no more than 200 nautical miles (370 km) from its coastal baseline. This territory can be used by the other countries only for transportation. Meanwhile, a coastal state has sovereign rights for the purpose of exploration, development, conservation and management of natural resources, both living and nonliving, in the waters covering the seabed and other activities for economic exploration and exploitation of the zone, such as production of energy from water, currents and winds. The exception to this rule occurs when the exclusive economic zone will be crossed. When an overlap occurs, it is up to the states to specify the actual maritime boundary.",

Using an introduced model of utility values with respect to main resources \u2013 fossil fuels and fish \u2013 we have proposed different scenarios for allocation of territories depending on the importance of each natural resource. As a result, we have evaluated the satisfaction level of countries according to each scenario and proposed allocation with the same satisfaction level of each country and compared it with current allocation. We hope that application of fair division models will help in resolving conflicts in other parts of the world.",
