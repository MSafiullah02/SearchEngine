There are no published case reports that present over ten serial CXRs on the same patient. We present a case report of a 68-year-old patient with confirmed COVID-19 and a prolonged course of admission, receiving nasal and humidified oxygen, non-invasive and then mechanical ventilation. She self-extubated, but remained stable on nasal oxygen only and was transferred for rehabilitation. We present 12 of her serial CXRs over six weeks, showing progression from subtle changes to overt widespread pneumonitis to slow resolution. She is also an example of a rare case of COVID-19 pneumonitis causing persistent hypoxia for over six weeks.",

            "text": "COVID-19 is a predominantly pulmonary pathogen that causes death primarily via respiratory failure (1) . COVID-19 pneumonia is usually bilateral, peripheral or basal, and multilobar (2) . Ground glass opacity (GGO) is seen in two thirds of patients, and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) in one third of patients requiring intensive care unit (ICU) admission (3) . Like Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS), cavitation and lymphadenopathy are not seen, and pneumothorax is rare (4) . The British Society of Thoracic Imaging (BSTI) provided templates for reporting chest x-ray (CXR) changes in suspected COVID-19 patients (5). Normal CXR is labelled as CVCX0, and correlation with viral reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) is recommended. Lower lobe and peripheral predominant multiple opacities that are bilateral are classical or probable COVID-19 (CVCX1). Consolidation or opacities that do not fit with classical or non-COVID are classified as indeterminate (CVCX2), and other features such as lobar pneumonia, pleural effusion, pneumothorax and pulmonary edema, are regarded as non-COVID-19 (CVCX3). COVID-19 pneumonia is further quantified as mild, moderate, or severe. We use these standardized templates in our institution to aid in patients' triage. If CXR is normal or indeterminate and COVID-19 swab is negative, they are labelled as negative and moved to a non-COVID ward. If CXR shows probable COVID-19 and swab is negative, they are still treated as clinical COVID-19 until a nasopharyngeal swab is repeated.",

In the emergency department, she spiked a high temperature, so she was isolated on a COVID-19 ward and had a nasopharyngeal swab for viral RT-PCR which was positive.

Her initial CXR showed patchy air space change in both lower zones with left basal atelectasis, indeterminate for COVID-19 (CVCX2). Her oxygen (O2) saturations on day one were 92% on room air. She was commenced on intravenous Ceftriaxone and Clarithromycin. 48 hours later her inflammatory markers worsened and CXR showed increased consolidation in both lungs, probable for COVID-19 (CVCX1). Over the following 72 hours her O2 saturations dropped to low 80s on room air and she was treated with O2, first via nasal cannula to a maximum of 4 litrers, and then humidified O2 via Venturi mask which was titrated up to 98%. She remained hypoxic and on day seven was treated with 98% O2 via AIRVO. She failed this and on day eight was transferred to ICU. Initially she was managed with continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) alternating with high flow nasal cannula (HFNC), but within 24 hours she was intubated and ventilated and then remained on significant support for many days. She self-extubated after nine days, but remained unsupported and was successfully weaned down to nasal O2 at 4 liters. She completed nine days of intravenous meropenem and linezolid. She was stepped down to a medical ward and remained confused for several days. Her C-reactive protein and lymphocytes normalized. Her CXR changes gradually and slowly resolved, but she remained O2-dependent (at 1.5 liters) at day 47 of admission and was transferred for rehabilitation. Figure 1 shows her serial CXRs from admission to day 41.",

However, this is unlikely going to be the practice in the setting of this COVID-19 pandemic apart from selected cases with lobar pneumonia, though little is known about the natural course of COVID-19 consolidations. In this case, we show that the widespread bilateral opacities are incompletely resolved at six weeks from symptom onset, though significantly improved. Despite the absence of history of smoking or pre-existing lung disease, this patient remained O2-dependent after 6 weeks of the onset of symptoms, which raises questions about the mechanism of lung damage in COVID-19, as this is unusual with other infective lung pathologies.",
