Physical findings and oxygen use within 24 hours and chest imaging within 48 hours of presentation were included in the analyses. Severe LRTD was defined as LRTD that necessitated oxygen use. We defined an immunocompromised state as the presence of primary immunodeficiency or receipt of chemotherapy for treatment of hematologic malignancy or solid tumor, chronic immunosuppressive therapy, solid organ transplant, or hematopoietic cell transplant [13]. Nonimmunocompromised children could have other types of underlying disorders, as previously described [9, 16]. Any virus or bacteria in nasal samples detected by multiplex respiratory PCR at presentation was considered to be a respiratory copathogen. Other coinfections were determined by chart review and microbiologic results obtained within 48 hours of presentation.

To evaluate associations with virologic and host factors, we calculated 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for the percentages of patients in risk-factor categories with each primary outcome and performed bivariate logistic regression modeling for each outcome and covariate. Associations between immunocompromised status and primary outcomes were estimated using bivariate and multivariable logistic regression modeling. Logistic regression modeling was used for exploratory analyses to investigate associations between the primary outcomes and cell counts in the immunocompromised patients and to assess how adjusting for demographic and clinical factors affected the estimated association between viral strain and the primary outcomes. Covariates in the multivariable models included sex, age (<1, 1\u20135 years, or >5 years), presence of an underlying pulmonary disorder (yes or no), and presence of a respiratory copathogen (HCoV only, respiratory syncytial virus [RSV], or non-RSV). To investigate interactions between the HCoV strain and other respiratory copathogens, we calculated 95% CIs for the percentage of patients with LRTD in groups defined by viral strain and the presence of a non-HCoV copathogen (yes or no). All tests were 2 sided, and we used an \u03b1 level of .05 without correction for multiple testing. Analyses were performed using Stata 12.1 (Stata Corp, College Station, Texas).",

The distributions of strains between the immunocompromised and nonimmunocompromised children were similar (Table 1). Respiratory copathogens were detected more commonly in the nonimmunocompromised group than in the immunocompromised group (31% vs 22%, respectively), mostly because of the increased detection of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) (13% vs 6%, respectively) (Figure 2).",

Previous pediatric studies of HCoV infection have included small numbers of immunocompromised children [10, 24, 25]; few data from studies that focused specifically on this high-risk population exist. In our study, an immunocompromised state was associated with a higher risk of severe LRTD after we adjusted for clinical and virologic covariates. This observation is important, because HCoVs are highly prevalent in immunocompromised hosts [25, 26], and our finding might be informative for risk stratification and interventional studies in this vulnerable population.",

The age distributions in the immunocompromised and nonimmunocompromised groups differed. We assume that the broader age distribution in the immunocompromised group reflects the overall age distribution of the immunocompromised population, although these data were not available to us. A prospective longitudinal cohort study examined the effect of 3 HCoV strains on children younger than 5 years and found a substantial burden of LRTD, especially in children younger than 2 years [27]. Lee and Storch [9] characterized clinical features of hospitalized children younger than 5 years infected with HCoV strains OC43 and NL63. The presence of congenital heart disease and a chronic respiratory disorder was associated with severe disease. These reports are consistent with our findings. The overall rates of respiratory copathogens in our study (22% in immunocompromised children and 31% in nonimmunocompromised children) are lower than those of previous studies in children (35%\u201375%) [9, 28\u201330]. Conflicting data regarding the clinical implications of detecting multiple respiratory viruses exist. In children, detection of multiple viruses has been associated with less-severe disease [31], but the opposite result was reported for adults [32]. The specific combination of respiratory copathogens might be important. In this study, we found that compared to HCoV alone, the odds of LRTD or severe LRTD were much higher in children with RSV coinfection than in those with coinfection with a non-RSV copathogen. This result was likely driven by the higher pathogenicity of RSV, as indicated by previous studies [9, 28]. Higher rates of severe LRTD in patients with HCoV plus a copathogen were also found in another pediatric study; RSV accounted for half of the copathogens [19].",

To our knowledge, ours is the largest study to have investigated the associations between particular HCoV strains and clinical outcomes in children. Neither LRTD nor severe LRTD was associated with a particular HCoV strain after we adjusted for covariates, including presence of respiratory copathogens. We were not able to show a particular effect of strain type in the subset analysis of immunocompromised children, although our data do not suggest an effect on acquisition or disease severity. We did find marked seasonality of the HCoV strains, with higher rates of detection for all 4 strains in winter but much lower rates in the other seasons of every year. This effect was not driven by testing bias, because our institution uses multiplex PCR testing for respiratory pathogens year-round. The overall seasonality trend is consistent with that shown in other reports [10, 27, 33].",

The majority of these patients received antibiotics as treatment. In other pediatric studies, respiratory viruses, including HCoV, were detected by PCR frequently in febrile children without localizing signs [9, 13]. Furthermore, respiratory viral infection was implicated recently as playing a possible etiologic role in febrile neutropenia, although the detection of respiratory viruses seemed to be associated more with the presence of respiratory symptoms [34, 35]. Differentiating active infection from asymptomatic shedding is clinically challenging, especially in high risk populations. Future studies that clarify the role of respiratory viruses in patients with fever without a source or with febrile neutropenia might provide useful information for decreasing the rates of hospitalization and antibiotic usage.",

Prolonged shedding of respiratory viruses, including HCoV, in asymptomatic immunocompromised and nonimmunocompromised children has been well described [36\u201338]. Two recent large prospective studies of symptomatic patients with respiratory viruses compared to asymptomatic controls suggested that most of the HCoV detections were associated with symptomatic illness [11, 39]. Nonetheless, the presence of HCoV does not necessarily indicate its etiologic role in clinical symptoms. Furthermore, testing bias by the attending physician was still possible despite the fact that we investigated only patients who visited our institution for acute care. However, most physicians would have a lower threshold for testing (ie, for less severe presentations) in a population at high risk; thus, the positive relationship between an immunocompromised state and severe LRTD would be weakened rather than accentuated. Therefore, a testing bias would be unlikely to alter our interpretation of the role of the immunocompromised state. Last, we were not able to evaluate the viral load in respiratory samples because of the nature of multiplex respiratory PCR test.",
