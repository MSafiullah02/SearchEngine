Recently, two main trends characterise its developments: the adoption of deep learning architectures and the consideration of textual material originating from historical and cultural heritage collections. While the former opens up new opportunities, the latter introduces new challenges with heterogeneous, historical and noisy inputs. If NE processing tools are increasingly being used in the context of historical documents, performance values are below the ones on contemporary data and are hardly comparable. In this context, this paper introduces the CLEF 2020 Evaluation Lab HIPE (Identifying Historical People, Places and other Entities) on named entity recognition and linking on diachronic historical newspaper material in French, German and English. Our objective is threefold: strengthening the robustness of existing approaches on non-standard inputs, enabling performance comparison of NE processing on historical texts, and, in the long run, fostering efficient semantic indexing of historical documents in order to support scholarship on digital cultural heritage collections.",

Around since the seminal Message Understanding Conference (MUC) evaluation cycle in the 1990s [11] , named entity-related tasks have undergone major evolutions until now, from entity recognition and classification to entity disambiguation and linking [21, 25] . Besides the general domain of well-written newswire data, named entity (NE) processing is also applied to specific domains, particularly bio-medical [10, 14] , and on more noisy inputs such as speech transcriptions [9] and tweets [26] .",

First, at the technical level, the adoption of deep learning architectures and the usage of embedded language representations greatly reshapes the field and opens up new research directions [1, 16, 17] . Second, with respect to application domain and language spectrum, NE processing has been called upon to contribute to the field of Digital Humanities (DH), where massive digitization of historical documents is producing huge amounts of texts [30] . Thanks to large-scale digitization projects driven by cultural institutions, millions of images are being acquired and, when it comes to text, their content is transcribed, either manually via dedicated interfaces, or automatically via Optical Character Recognition (OCR). Beyond this great achievement in terms of document preservation and accessibility, the next crucial step is to adapt and develop appropriate language technologies to search and retrieve the contents of this 'Big Data from the Past' [13] . In this regard, information extraction techniques, and particularly NE recognition and linking, can certainly be regarded as among the first steps.",

First, inputs can be extremely noisy, with errors which do not resemble tweet misspellings or speech transcription hesitations, for which adapted approaches have already been devised [5, 27] . Second, the language under study is mostly of earlier stage(s), which renders usual external and internal evidences less effective (e.g., the usage of different naming conventions and presence of historical spelling variations) [2, 3] . Further, beside historical VIPs, texts from the past contain rare entities which have undergone significant changes (esp. locations) or do no longer exist, and for which adequate linguistic resources and knowledge bases are missing [12] . Finally, archives and texts from the past are not as anglophone as in today's information society, making multilingual resources and processing capacities even more essential [22] .",

HIPE slightly recasts and simplifies them, considering only a subset of entity types and components, as well as of linguistic units eligible as named entities. HIPE guidelines were iteratively consolidated via the annotation of a \"mini-reference\" corpus, where annotation decisions were tested and difficult cases discussed.

These contextualized word embeddings rely on neural forward and backward character-level language models that have been trained by us on a large collection (500 m tokens) of late 19th and early 20th centuries Swiss-French newspapers. In accordance to the literature, a Bi-LSTM NER model with an on-top CRF layer (Bi-LSTM-CRF) works best for our data. As a baseline system, which will also be provided for the shared task, we train a traditional CRF sequence classifier [18] using basic spelling features such as a token's character prefix and suffix, the casing of the initial character and the presence of punctuation marks and digits. The baseline classifier shows fairly modest overall performance scores of 69.4% recall, 56.2% precision and 62.1 F 1 (see Table 1 ).",

From the perspective of digital humanities, the lab's outcomes help DH practitioners in mapping state-of-the-art solutions for NE processing on historical texts, and in getting a better understanding of what is already possible as opposed to what is still challenging. Most importantly, digital scholars are in need of support to explore the large quantities of digitized text they currently have at hand, and NE processing is high on the agenda. Such processing can support research questions in various domains (e.g. history, political science, literature, historical linguistics) and knowing about their performance is crucial in order to make an informed use of the processed data. Overall, HIPE will contribute to advance the state of the art in semantic indexing of historical material, within the specific domain of historical newspaper processing, as in e.g. the \"impresso -Media Monitoring of the Past\" project 8 and, more generally, within the domain of text understanding of historical material, as in the Time Machine Europe project 9 which ambitions the application of AI technologies on cultural heritage data. grant number CR-SII5 173719.
