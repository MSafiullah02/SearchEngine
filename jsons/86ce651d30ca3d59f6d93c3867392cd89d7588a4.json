There is a great sense of urgency and a wish to contribute to the evaluation of the evidence base and to generating new knowledge for assessing and managing the COVID-19 pandemic. The focus of this journal is in the methods used to build this knowledge base. Below we list some ideas that we hope our community of readers and authors will tackle. We would welcome good papers on these important methodological challenges, to make a difference in effectively fighting the current pandemic and anticipating possible similar future crises. We consider a Covid -19 section based on these submissions, for which we will set up an expedited process for reviewing and publishing.",

In this context, a concrete challenge is providing methodological approaches/support for: high speed scoping reviews of potentially useful prior knowledge and experience from similar previous events (epidemiological, public health, biomedical, clinical); surveillance to monitor the current pandemic thread and how to model the spread: how to do this, what are useful (big) data sources, and how to assess risk of bias; real-time studies of the occurrence of COVID-19 (incidence, complications rate, lethality, with uncertainty ranges) and its biomedical and social determinants, in order to optimally predict (modeling) numbers and speed of spread, course and duration, relapse risk, and health care needs; evaluation of diagnostic tests for active corona infection: accuracy and prediction of better health outcomes (addressing, e.g., reference standards and appropriate endpoints); past corona infection: accuracy and implications for protection also of other people (knowledge of immunity is crucial for patient care, society and economy); evaluation of (candidate) antiviral agents and vaccines: how to ethically fast-track trials of benefit and assess adverse effects; and how to assess the trade-off of the risk of adverse effects vs. the risk of more casualties or not getting a grip on the problem at all if the intervention is too late; what are appropriate (intermediate) outcome measures; how to recognize risk groups that need to be prioritized; and. how to implement appropriate ethical review; evaluation of pandemic-specific interventions, such as social distancing, personal protective equipment, isolation, apps for tracing COVID-19 contacts, and group-level interventions (e.g., closing schools); standards for research and reporting adapted to the particular situation, both to support researchers working under pressure and to prevent malpractice and abuse; evaluating the strength of recommendations for public health and health care practice; decision making under uncertainty: how to evaluate the effectiveness of, for example, medical decision making, shared care, and multilevel decision making approaches (taking individual-, risk group-, and population-specific interests into account).",

It is now increasingly required for clinical trials and systematic reviews of intervention and researcher designed observational studies, but what about the database studies using administrative datasets not designed for research that are being widely encouraged to provide Real World Evidence [RWE]? Zarin et al. review the situation and argue that four key needs urgently need addressing: (1) an unambiguous list of studies; (2) well-defined and broadly enforced policies to achieve a comprehensive listing of studies; (3) international collaboration on a registration system for the prevention of informational ''chaos''; (4) pre-specified planned analyses with a defined level of detail to distinguish pre-specified from post hoc analyses.

Hayden reports on an under-recognised new threat namely the challenge to the trustworthiness of systematic reviews due to the inclusion of primary studies published in predatory journals. As she points out this is a serious problem since it dilutes the credible literature through citation and further dissemination of untrustworthy evidence; increases the amount of poor quality data, or studies with unusable data; and includes duplicated or fraudulent data in systematic reviews. The magnitude of this is unknown but in one Cochrane review by the author of this commentary, 5 of 65 references when checked were found to be papers from suspected predatory journals. Hayden recommends that action be taken urgently. This could include using search strategies that limit or exclude articles from journals with inadequate peer review processes, using one of the accredited checklists [3] to identifying and excluding reports of trials that exhibit characteristics of predatory publishing, and using sensitivity analyses to test the impact of questionable studies on interpretation of evidence.",

[4] propose the term of 'inferential reproducibility' for making of knowledge claims of similar strength from either a study replication or reanalysis of original data. Schreijenberg et al. report on an example of the latter, a reanalysis of original data from a trial with over 1,500 patients to study the efficacy of paracetamol in low back pain. This was the first and only trial showing that paracetamol had no effect on the outcomes of acute low back pain which contradicted most clinical guidelines so was important to check this for robustness. A second new study was attempted but failed to recruit enough patients so the data from the first study were given to an independent set of investigators who carried out a re-analysis using a different analytic approach and selected different primary outcomes [pain and quality of life] felt to be of greater relevance to clinicians than the primary outcome selected for the first analysis [time to recovery]. Similar results were obtained bolstering the conclusions of the first analysis.",

This covers psychotherapy, surgical, and rehabilitation trials. Alvarez et al. review the impact of this extension on the reporting of trials of manual therapy before and after this CONSORTnpt extension was published. There was improvement in the frequency of a flowchart diagram, the estimated effect size, precision descriptions, and the description of intervention procedures. However, sample sizes remain small with few providing a sample size calculation, and there was persistent poor reporting of randomisation, protection against allocation bias, handling of missing data and assessment of harms.

After completing a training exercise, participants screened abstracts online based on predefined inclusion and exclusion criteria. Although many systemic reviewer organisations including U.S. Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ), the Campbell Collaboration, Cochrane, and the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence allow a single person to screen articles for inclusion, previous studies have shown that with one screener that over 10% of studies get missed.
