Since its first emergence in Wuhan, China, more than 450,000 cases and 20,000 deaths have been recorded globally due to COVID-19 [2]. While most patients with COVID-19 have mild influenza-like illness and may be asymptomatic, a minority of patients will develop severe pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), multi-organ failure (MOF), and death [3]. Clinical and laboratory biomarkers [4] to predict the mortality and severity of COVID-19 are essential in this pandemic situation of which resource allocation must be urgently prepared especially in the context of respiratory support readiness.",

It has been associated with severe COVID-19 [6, 7], and non-survivors of COVID-19 were reported to have a significantly lower lymphocyte count than survivors [7]. Whether lower lymphocyte count and lymphopenia could really be predictor of severity of COVID-19 was our main interest, since this laboratory tools are readily available even in the remote areas. Therefore, in the present study, we conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis in order to investigate the association of lymphocyte count on admission and the severity of COVID-19. We would also like to analyze whether patient characteristics such as age and comorbidities affect the relationship between lymphocyte count and COVID-19.",
