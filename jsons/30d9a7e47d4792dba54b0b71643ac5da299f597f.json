In most cases, recombinant production is required for obtaining suffi cient amounts of homogenous material for detailed analyses [ 1 ] . MultiBac is an advanced expression system that has been designed for overexpressing multiprotein complexes in insect cells infected by a single composite multigene baculovirus. MultiBac has enabled production of many challenging multiprotein complexes, setting the stage to unlock their mechanism [ 2 -4 ] . A bottleneck which can be encountered when many heterologous proteins are co-produced from individual expression cassettes derives from imbalanced expression levels of the individual proteins prohibiting proper complex assembly [ 3 , 5 ] . Some subunits may be expressed stronger, others weaker, and occasionally one subunit is expressed at such a low level that it becomes detrimental to overall yield and a complex containing all desired subunits cannot be obtained.",

A TEV NIa protease cleavage site (tcs) is placed upstream of the CFP encoding gene (Fig. 2a ) . Heterologous genes of interest (GOIs) can be inserted into this polyprotein expression cassette by using the ( a ) MultiBac Acceptor vectors pPBac, pKL-PBac, and pOmni-PBac, tailored for polyprotein production, are shown schematically ( top ). They contain a regular ColE1 origin of replication and a polyprotein expression cassette, which encodes an N-terminal TEV protease and a C-terminal CFP spaced by a TEV cleavage site (tcs). BstEII and RsrII sites are used for inserting the polyprotein encoding ORF of interest. Donor vectors pIDC, pIDK, and pIDS contain a conditional origin of replication derived from the R6K\u03b3 phage [ 13 ] . The multiplication module fl anking the expression cassettes contain a homing endonuclease site and a complementary BstXI site ( boxes in light blue ). Polh and p10 are baculoviral very late promoters; SV40 and HSVtk are polyadenylation signals. MCS1 and MCS2 stand for multiple cloning sites. Tn7L and Tn7R are specifi c DNA sequences for Tn7 transposition; the lef2/603 and Ori1629 homology regions are shown as gray boxes . LoxP sites are shown as red balls .

Ap stands for ampicillin. The F-Replicon is a single-copy bacterial origin of replication.
