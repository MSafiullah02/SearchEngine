These tasks include target identification and validation; screening for active compounds; chemical modification of candidate compounds to achieve optimized pharmacology; formulating the final drug product; and establishing safety in preclinical models. \"Repurposing\" drugs that have previously been approved (or shown to be safe in humans) for new clinical indications can provide a faster, less risky, and more cost-effective route for bringing a new therapy to patients. Such shortcuts in development can be particularly valuable to resource-constrained academicians. When performing drug discovery research, we must be particularly attentive to the robustness of our experiments, because inability to reproduce academic data continues to be a sticking point when projects are transferred to industry. Our experiments must be appropriately blinded, statistically powered, and meticulously documented so that our findings are worthy of the large investment required for their further translation into a drug. This chapter walks through the essential preclinical drug development steps that lead to a clinical drug candidate.",

This low rate was despite cooperation of the academic scientist who reported the original findings to reproduce the work at or with Amgen [1] . In another report, Bayer scientists found that 75% of published academic studies brought in-house could not be reproduced, which resulted in termination of the effort to develop therapeutics based on these academic findings [2] .

Data related to their immune response, eating, exercise, ability to learn tasks, etc. are greatly affected by the time of day when the experiment is conducted. The chow feed is another important variable that can affect animal-derived data; some feed is rich in soy and therefore contributes feminizing hormones to both males and females. Variation in the feed may affect response to drug uptake and metabolism, to the integrity of the immune response, etc. Other confounding factors relate to the housing conditions, including noise, strong smells, and crowding; and a good animal facility should minimize them. Latent or full-blown infection by viruses, bacteria, mites, and other parasites can also affect the results of the study (See Box 2.3). All these variables should be held to a minimum and detailed information should be recorded so that even if there is no room to provide it in full in the publication, we will be able to share the specific conditions used during our study when contacted by a commercial entity or another academic laboratory.",

However, the control experiments need to be done side-by-side with the treatment arm, as unexpected factors can contribute to the outcome.

If you are like me, you contact a statistician only when you try to analyze the data. A recent commentary urges academicians to recognize the critical contribution of statisticians in preclinical research [5] . Statisticians should be engaged early during the study planning to ensure that the number of animals included is sufficient and that the study is powered to provide an unequivocal answer. This will not only ease the review process, but importantly will increase the rigor of the study. Let us not have our budget dictate the number of animals per group we use, or we risk sacrificing the robustness of our results! Biostatisticians can also weigh in on the appropriateness of the statistical tests used to analyze the results. Often, there is more than one statistical test available to compare groups, but characteristics of the data (e.g., size, distribution, etc.) may make some tests inappropriate.

In a recent analysis of 252 drugs approved by CDER between 1998 and 2007, only 47% were considered scientifically novel; and academic discoveries contributed to a third of those novel molecules [6] . In addition, of drugs approved for orphan indications during that period, almost 50% were based on academic discoveries. So academic research is an important engine for innovation in drug discovery. Nevertheless, as Begley and Ellis conclude, the bar for reproducibility in performing and presenting preclinical studies must be raised.

In practice, especially for an academic effort, cost is an important consideration. For enzyme assays, the choice of substrate concentration (relative to K m ) will affect the type of inhibitors or activators that are identified. Running the assay with the starting substrate concentration equal to K m will give the best overall sensitivity to competitive, uncompetitive, and noncompetitive inhibitors [11] .

Phenotypic screens use a biological response (e.g., cell death, protein translocation) to report compound activity.

Most drugs have IC 50 or EC 50 values (half maximal inhibitory concentration or half maximal effective concentration) around 10 nM or so, with considerable variation to either side.

Alternatively, a structure may reveal an unfavorable contact: perhaps a hydrophobic (water-hating) portion of the ligand is exposed to solvent, or a hydrophilic (water-loving) portion is buried in a greasy hydrophobic part of the protein; the medicinal chemist would make analogs of the molecule without the unfavorable contact and test the activities of the new molecules. Ideally this will lead to better potency, but often changes are less dramatic than expected, and additional molecules will need to be made. This iterative process is called structure-based drug design. In the best cases, it is possible to obtain structural information of how the small molecule binds to the target using experimental techniques such as X-ray crystallography or NMR spectrometry.

For example, there are about 500 protein kinases in the human genome, so measuring activity against all or even most of them can get pricey. Fortunately, enough companies have been working in the kinase field that there are now commercial offerings to confirm selectivity against a large number of kinases in a short period of time. However, such selectivity testing for newer classes of targets and enzymes is often not available. Note that selectivity testing within a related family of enzymes or receptors does not rule out the possibility that your compound will bind to a protein outside that family. Before compounds advance into the clinic they are tested against a panel of up to several hundred targets that could cause problems (see below).

Because of this fact, the level of tolerance for risk associated with vaccination is very dependent on the level of perceived danger from the infection being prevented. For example, when polio epidemics were common, the public clamored for a preventative intervention.

In many cases, the in vitro potency (e.g., the thermodynamic affinity with which the compound binds to its target) will be the best predictor. However, in some cases, the kinetic off-rate may be more relevant. For example, when neurotransmitters are released at synapses, this leads to very high local concentrations that persist for short durations. If a competitive antagonist has a rapid off-rate, this will allow the high concentrations of neurotransmitter to compete effectively with the drug. In contrast, if the drug has a slow off-rate, the drug will remain bound to the target during the brief time the neurotransmitter achieves its peak level. In this nonequilibrium condition, a drug with a slow off-rate will out-perform a drug with a fast off-rate even if both drugs have the identical in vitro potencies during equilibrium binding conditions. 2. Which parameter(s) of drug exposure best predict disease efficacy in vivo? In some cases, peak drug levels drive disease efficacy-e.g., for transcriptional activators that promote expression of long-lived proteins.

What is the projected human dose? As part of the feasibility assessment, it is necessary to estimate the expected dose required for efficacy in humans. There are at least two factors which enter into the dose projection: first, quantitation of the exposure required for efficacy in at least one animal model; and, second, prediction of the expected pharmacokinetic (PK) profile in humans. The projection of human PK is generally based upon measurement of PK in multiple species (e.g., mouse, rat, dog, and nonhuman primate). 6. How safe are the compounds and what is the therapeutic index? Safety assessment is generally conducted in two nonclinical species (one rodent and one non-rodent) prior to initiating human studies. The \"no observed adverse effect level\" (NOAEL) is defined as the highest exposure that can be achieved without causing adverse effects in the test species. The therapeutic index is defined as the ratio of the NOAEL exposure: efficacious exposure.

In the case of SGLT2 inhibitors, loss of glucose in the urine is a direct consequence of inhibiting the transporter that mediates reabsorption of glucose from the glomerular filtrate. In addition, loss of glucose in the urine is the key mechanism that drives the decrease in plasma glucose levels.

More commonly, molecules undergo biotransformation, a process of metabolism that involves building or breaking chemical bonds within the molecule to improve the body's ability to excrete it. Biotransformation is grouped into Phase I and Phase II reactions; Phase I enzymes catalyze oxidations, reductions and/or hydrolysis to introduce or unmask functional groups in the molecule. Phase II enzymes conjugate endogenous small polar molecules to the unmasked functional groups to inactivate the drug and improve its water solubility for elimination. A drug may be subject to Phase I metabolism, Phase II, or both. Sometimes, knowledge of a drug's metabolism is exploited by chemists to devise a prodrug, a molecule whose metabolism creates the true therapeutically active compound, to improve ADME properties. The cytochrome P450 (CYP) family of enzymes is composed of a number of related isozymes and is responsible for a major portion of drug Phase I metabolism. CYP enzymes are primarily located in the liver, but also occur in a number of other tissues. CYP isozymes differ in their abundance and importance to metabolism across different tissues. For instance, the CYP3A4 isoform is very abundant in the liver and intestinal epithelium and contributes to the biotransformation of almost one half of drugs, whereas CYP2D6 is one of the least abundant isozymes and yet is involved in the metabolism of a quarter of all drugs [15] .",

A novel excipient or novel use, outside the limits of its current use (e.g., route, dose), will normally require additional evaluation. The use of some excipients is limited by toxicity (e.g., dimethylacetamide, cyclodextrin) and therefore it is necessary to carefully consider the excipient dose and the patient population for which the product is intended. A good strategy for excipient evaluation is to use the clinical formulation without API as the vehicle formulation (control group) in animal studies. It is also advisable to include an additional negative control group, to confirm lack of effects by the excipient.",

It is important to separate doses such that the exposures between groups do not overlap.

Whereas rodents are usually the species chosen for the early efficacy studies, there is typically no information available for dosing in the non-rodent model. If no or limited data are available, short duration non-GLP pilot studies (1-3 days) with minimal numbers of animals should be performed to assist in selecting the appropriate dose range. For compounds with limited evidence of toxicity, the high dose can be set based upon consideration of the animal exposure relative to humans and practical limits such as dose volume or API solubility.",

However, for many drugs, the oral route may not be feasible or practical, as the drug may show poor oral bioavailability and not reach the systemic circulation after oral dosing. For the oral route, there are many forms (tablet, capsule, liquid, suspension, etc.) chosen and manufactured on the basis of the bioavailability of the drug.Another important characteristic of an oral formulation is its rate of absorption. In some settings, rapid absorption is desirable, to achieve a rapid onset of action (e.g., drugs given for pain or for sleep). Tablets may be formulated as \"quick dissolve\" versions. In other settings rapid absorption is problematic, as the high peak concentrations associated with rapid absorption may result in unwanted side effects, sometimes serious or life-threatening. There are many examples of this in the cardiovascular field.There are a number of special formulations used for oral administration intended to prolong the duration of action and/or avoid high peak concentrations. These are often called \"slow release\" (SR) or \"extended release\" (XR) formulations, to distinguish them from immediate release formulations. Such formulations may allow a drug to be administered at longer dosing intervals that improve patient adherence to the medication (e.g., once instead of twice daily, or twice instead of three times daily). Other special oral formulations include enteric-coated formulations that protect the drug from the acidic environment of the stomach and dissolve",
