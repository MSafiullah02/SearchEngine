We simulate stochastic infection curves that incorporate core elements from infection models, ideal-type social network models, and statistical relational event models. Our models demonstrate that while social distancing measures clearly do flatten the curve, strategic reduction of contact can strongly increase their efficiency, introducing the possibility of allowing some social contact while keeping risks low. Limiting interaction to a few repeated 2 contacts emerges as the most effective strategy. Maintaining similarity across contacts and the strengthening of communities via triadic strategies are also highly effective. This approach provides empirical evidence which adds nuanced policy advice for effective social distancing that can mitigate adverse consequences of social isolation.",

Furthermore, as time passes, issues related to the social, psychological, and economic costin addition to compliance fatigueare likely to emerge, which requires the consideration and evaluation of different approaches to the practice of social distancing over the long-term. Once the first peak of the epidemic has passed and strict restrictions can be eased, such longer-term strategies are likely to be needed to avoid a resurgence of an unhindered second wave of infection.",

Reducing the reproduction number decreases the growth rate of infected cases.

At each time step, the disease spreads from infected nodes to every node to which they are connected; thus, in the first step the disease spreads from the seed node to its direct neighbours. In the second step, it spreads to their neighbours, who are at network distance 2 from the seed node, and so forth. Over time, the virus moves along network ties until all nodes are infected. The example shows that the network distance of a node from the infection source (indicated by node colour in Fig. 1 , A and C) is identical to the number of time-steps until the virus reaches it. Thus, the distribution of distances to the source directly maps onto the curve of new infections (Fig. 1, B and D).",

This is because the latter network has longer path lengths than the former oneor in other words, more network distance between the individuals (nodes) due to a different structure of interaction, despite the same absolute contact prevalence. Thus, when adopting a network perspective, flattening the curve is equivalent to increasing the network path from an infected individual to all others, which can be achieved by restructuring contact (next to the generally proposed reduction of contact). Consequently, one aim of social distancing should be increasing the average network distance between individuals by smartly manipulating the structure of interactions. The aim of this study is to provide insight on how to keep the COVID-19 curve flat while allowing some social interaction. Our illustration shows a viable path towards achieving our goal: we must devise interaction strategies that make real-life networks look more like network C, and less like network A.",

            "text": "The contact reduction strategies we propose are based on insights regarding how items flow through networks, such as diseases, memes, information, or ideas (15, 16, 17, 18) . Such spread is generally hampered when networks consist of densely connected groups with few connections in-between, such as among individuals who live in isolated villages scattered over sparsely inhabited rural areas (19) . In contrast, contacts that bridge large distances are related to short paths and rapid spread, For example, when commuters travel between these isolated villages, network distances decrease substantially (15, 19) . Using this knowledge, we can avoid rapid contagion by encouraging social distancing strategies that increase clustering (such as staying within a village) and reduce network short-cuts (such as not commuting between villages) to reap the largest benefit of reducing social contact while keeping the limiting disease spread to a minimum. We propose three strategies that are all aimed at increasing network clustering and eliminating short-cuts. While a more realistic example of the proposed strategies is simulated in the next section, we outline the underlying principles of the model in Figure 2 . Panel A depicts a network in which densely connected communities are bridged by random, long-range ties; this type of network is commonly known as a small world network (19) . It is widely used in simulations, as it represents core features of real-world contact networks, in particular social clustering combined with short network distances, which makes it particularly useful for our illustration (15) . Panels A to D illustrate the successive, targeted contact reduction strategies, while the bar-graph depicts the distribution of distances of all individuals from one of the two highlighted infection sources. To implement the first strategy, individuals need to pay attention to characteristics of their contact partners. Individuals tend to have contact with others which share common attributes, such as the neighbourhood they live in (geographical), the companies they work at (organisational), or that are of similar age (demographic) (20, 21, 22) . This is called 'homophily' and is a ubiquitous and well-established feature of social networks. The node colour in Figure  1 can represent any of these characteristics, such as neighbourhood of residence. Because we are mostly connected to similar others, contact with dissimilar individuals tends to bridge to more distant communities. Restricting one's contact to those most similar helps limit potential network bridges that are known to substantially reduce network path lengths. Panel B in Figure   1 shows the resulting network structure after this strategy of tie reduction has been implemented. The associated bar-graph illustrates that a substantial number of nodes are at a larger distance from the infection source following this network intervention. As indicated in the figure, this strategy promises success in case the characteristic takes on a variety of values for different individuals that promotes forming small communities. A simple split such as for example, along gender or ethnic lines does not promise measurable success, but will instead increase negative consequences of distancing measures. This strategy is supported by epidemiological modelling which suggests that co-residence and mixing of individuals from different ages strongly increased the spread of infectious disease, such as COVID-19, in some countries (23) . Providing a concrete example of a behavioural recommendation for a post-lockdown world, if people only interact with others that live within 3 blocks (increase geographic similarity by constraining the area radius of gyration), more than 30 transmission events would be necessary for a disease to travel 100 blocks. Workplaces where many individuals need to come together can similarly implement routines to limit contact between groups that live in the same geographically distinct areas or come from different age-groups. The more similar a potential contact is, the closer he/she lives, and the more organisations that are shared (e.g., working in the same team; children in the same classroom), then the lower the comparative risk to keeping this contact.",

Tie embedding in triads is a particularly useful topology for containing epidemic outbreaks. Consider a closed triad of individuals i, j, and h. When i infects j and h, the connection between j and h does not contribute to further disease spread: this contact is redundant (26) . When comparing networks with an identical number of connections, networks with more redundant ties tend to have longer path lengths.

Or having tight and consistent networks of medical or community-based carers for those vulnerable to COVID-19 (elderly, pre-existing conditions) limits the transmission chain. Organisations can equally leverage this strategy in structuring work-routines by streamlining work-flows so that individuals rely on repeat contact to few others rather than workers dispersing throughout an organisation.

However, their difference lies in determinants of individual interaction. Strategy 2 relies on a stable and established network structure of durable relations: who are my 'friends' (contact partners) and which pairs of my friends also know each other?

Network ties are generated so that actors have some connections to geographically close alters, some ties to members of the same groups (representing e.g., co-workers), some ties to alters with similar attributes (e.g., similar age), and, finally, some ties to random alters in the population (e.g., haphazardly acquired friends not captured by the previous variables). The exact algorithms which define the networks are described in the Methods section. The importance of different tie formation mechanisms, the total number of network ties of actors, the size of the population and so forth are varied in different simulation scenarios to ensure that results are independent of arbitrary assumptions about specific network features within the modelling framework. Descriptive statistics of the different scenarios employed in the simulations are presented in Table 1 and parameters to generate these are presented in Table S1 in the Appendix. The generated networks represent the structure of alters that an actor can possibly interact with. They represent the members of their so-called 'social circles' (20, 21, 30) with whom they interact with in normal, pre-COVID life (including family, friends, schoolmates or co-workers).",

Social and physical distancing have been suggested as one of the most prominent public health interventions against COVID-19. While a complete or nearcomplete lockdown has been adopted in many countries in order to reduce the first peak of hospital admissions, some form of contact reduction is likely to be necessary in the longer run, possibly until a vaccine is widely available. Adopting a social network approach, we model and test the effectiveness of three simulated strategies that can limit COVID-19 spread as a longer-term, post-lockdown strategy, while allowing to some extent social and economic life to converge towards pre-COVID levels. The proposed strategies are: (1) increasing similarity in contact partners (birds of a feather strategy), (2) strengthening community structure via triadic interaction; and, (3) repetition of contacts in relatively closed social networks.",

By enabling individuals to differentiate between 'high-impact' and 'low-impact' contactsand thus to strategically adjust their behaviour higher levels of compliance could be the result. Instead of asking individuals to completely self-isolate alone, the emphasis on similar, community-based, and repetitive contact measures could make the persistent implementation of these measures more palatable. These more nuanced measures will lighten the psychological burden on those who are likely to suffer the most from social isolation, such as individuals with depression or anxiety or those in difficult living arrangements. At the same time, these measures might assist organisations in structuring contact in economic life so that more businesses can remain operational to some degree by streamlining and restructuring intra-organisational contact, or re-opening schools, whilst not necessarily increasing susceptibility to Covid-19 or other future pandemics, A number of concrete behavioural guidelines for different contexts can be deduced from these strategies. For hospital and other workers, it means keeping the composition of shifts constant over prolonged amounts of time (i.e., repeating contact) and, where possible, distribute people into shifts based on, for example, residential proximity (i.e., homophily). In other organisations, mandating different starting and end-times of workdays and break times by organisational unit can keep contact in small groups and reduce it between them. For schools it means maintaining the similar composition of classrooms, distribution of children within their grades to residential proximity and varying break times. The strategies outlined above can also be applied to private situations in which contact is essential. For example, when providing private care to elderly relatives or neighbours, our models suggest that it is important that the same person provides this care, rather than different relatives or individuals taking turns. The person who provides such care should be the one with fewest bridging ties to other groups and the one who lives geographically closest to minimise transmission risk for all involved and the wider population.",

By following these simple strategies of homophilous interactions, strengthening communities and repeated contact with the same individuals, governments will be able to more effectively describe the impact of social distancing and the public more likely to feel they have the control and understand their logic and follow them.",

Curves are averaged over 48 simulation runs. The first scenario in blue shows an interaction model in which there is no social distancing and actors interact at random. It essentially serves as a null model. The next four strategies all employ a 50% contact reduction compared to this null model in order to compare the different contact reduction strategies. The black line represents na\u00efve social distancing in which actors reduce their contact in a random fashion. The golden line represents the first 'birds of a feather' homophily approach, where we plot the infection curve when individuals employ the homophily strategy for their remaining interactions. The green line models our second strategy of strengthening communities and represents the infection curve when remaining contacts are chosen according to the triadic strategy. Finally, the red line models our third strategy of repeated interaction contacts and shows how infections develop using the repetition strategy to choose interaction partners. This simulation shows that all three of our strategies slow the spread of the virus compared to either no intervention or simple social distancing. The most effective choice is a strategic reduction of interaction with specific repeated contacts (our third strategy), with the homophily and triadic strategies roughly effective at the same levels. The results presented here are consistent across the different network examples that we used for our simulations. We find that in all examples, strategic social distancing strategies are more effective than random reduction, and that repeated social contacts with the same individuals is the most efficient strategy. Whether homophily or triadic closure have a larger effect depends on the specific case. Basic metrics of more examples of simulations under different conditions are found in",
