Studies evaluating the use of gowns and masks to prevent RSV transmission have shown mixed results. In a before-after design, the rate of health care\u2013associated RSV infection among infants during the period that gowns and masks were routinely worn by HCP was not statistically different from the rate during the period when gowns and masks were not used (32% vs 41%).20 A second prospective, randomized study failed to show that the use of gowns and masks prevented respiratory illness among HCP.21 One factor in the ineffectiveness of gowns and masks in these studies may have been poor personal protective equipment adherence among HCP. In another study, as compliance with use of gowns and gloves increased from 39% to 95%, the incidence of health care\u2013associated RSV decreased from 6.4 to 3.1 per 1000 patient-days.22 Some have expressed concerns that the use of gowns and gloves may facilitate transmission by serving as fomites, particularly given the prolonged survival of RSV on rubber gloves compared with skin.18 One study of seven Canadian pediatric hospitals actually noted an increased risk of transmission with the use of gowns, believed to be caused by decreased adherence of other infection control measures related to the overuse of gowns.23\n",

Two studies suggested that wearing eye protection is beneficial.24, 25 Other studies have evaluated the effectiveness of a variety of measures in combination to prevent health care\u2013associated RSV infection. A combination of cohort nursing and routine use of gowns and gloves significantly reduced RSV transmission compared with either intervention alone.26 An intervention consisting of education, hand washing, consistent use of gowns and gloves, isolation or cohorting patients, restriction of visitors, and cohort nursing was associated with a 39% reduction in health care\u2013associated RSV.27 Transmission of RSV in a special care nursery ended after instituting cohort nursing; active surveillance; patient cohorting; a strict policy limiting visitation in the winter; construction of segregate areas; and the use of gown, gloves, and masks with all patient contact.28 A similar intervention that included isolation or cohorting infected infants, hand washing, use of gowns, cohort nursing, isolation of asymptomatic high-risk infants, and limitation of visitors seemed to be effective in reducing transmission among infants from 45% in the previous year to 19%.11 In general, multicomponent infection control measures have shown significantly lower rates of nosocomial RSV infections, although effectiveness of specific components remains unclear.10\n",

Additional interventions to prevent health care\u2013associated RSV include cohort nursing and the exclusion from the hospital of ill HCP and visitors. Rapid RSV antigen screening has also been proposed to prevent health care\u2013associated RSV. Rapid screening of symptomatic children on admission resulted in a greater than 50% decrease in the proportion of RSV infections that were health care\u2013associated.30 Screening of all pediatric admissions, regardless of the presence of symptoms, with cohorting of infected patients reduced the incidence of health care\u2013associated RSV from 7.2 to less than 1 per 1000 patient-days.31 However, rapid antigen detection is an insensitive method for diagnosing RSV infection in adults.32\n",

Transmission of influenza occurred among ferrets in wire-mesh cages separated by at least 5 ft despite susceptible ferrets being placed at a higher elevation.49 To control for air currents in the laboratory, additional experiments were conducted using cages connected by an S- or U-shaped duct. Infection occurred at low air speeds using both types of ducts, which prevented transmission of coarse droplets. Mouse experiments provided similar results on the effect of ventilation and physical separation. Twenty-four hours after their exposure to an aerosol spray of influenza, infected mice were placed in the same cage as noninfected mice in a closed chamber for 24 hours.50 Transmission was not affected by physical separation with a wire screen; however, transmission was inversely correlated with airflow. Because air currents rather than separation affected transmission, the authors concluded that droplet nuclei are the principal means of influenza transmission. Recovery of infectious particles less than 10 \u03bcm from air surrounding the infected mice provided additional support for droplet nuclei transmission.51\n",

During the 1957 to 1958 influenza outbreak, 150 patients with tuberculosis were housed in a building at a Veterans Administration Hospital with upper air ultraviolet radiation.57 An additional 250 patients with tuberculosis were housed in a separate building with nonradiated air. Serologic evidence of influenza infection was found in only 2% of patients in the radiated building compared with 19% of patients in the nonradiated building and 18% of personnel. Radiated and nonradiated patients were equally exposed to personnel, and all persons were assumed susceptible because the influenza strain was new and antigenically distinct from previous strains. Because upper air radiation would not disinfect large respiratory droplets, transmission of influenza via droplet nuclei was proposed. However, the possibility that influenza was not introduced into the radiated building cannot be excluded. The second observation occurred in 1977 when 54 persons aboard a commercial airliner were grounded for 3 hours during which time the ventilation system was inoperative.58 A single index case became ill within 15 minutes after boarding. Within 72 hours, 72% of the remaining passengers developed influenza-like illness. The high illness rates and epidemic curve suggest airborne transmission from a single point source. However, passengers were allowed to move about the plane freely and the index patient sat immediately adjacent to the lavatory and galley areas, so droplet and contact transmission cannot be excluded.",

During the 1958 to 1959 pandemic, a single patient with influenza was hospitalized in a general medical ward before the appearance of influenza in the community.59 Sixteen patients and staff became ill over the next 3 days. The epidemic curve suggested an initial source with subsequent person-to-person spread. Furthermore, no patients in single rooms became infected as would have been expected of airborne transmission. Similarly, most health care\u2013associated influenza cases at the University of Rochester Medical Center occurred in patients housed in the same room adjacent to case patients.60 Patients across the hall from infected patients were less likely to acquire influenza despite open doors and nonuse of airborne infection isolation rooms. Salgado and colleagues37 reported health care\u2013associated influenza was rare, although most cases were placed in private, positive-pressure rooms. Finally, the lack of reports of explosive clusters of health care\u2013associated influenza during annual influenza seasons supports the lack of widespread airborne transmission in health care settings. Although transmission by droplet nuclei may play a role in certain conditions, large respiratory droplets are likely the primary mode of transmission within a health care setting, an environment where frequent air changes and exhaust ventilation occurs.",

A randomized controlled trial demonstrated that masks were noninferior to respirators in protecting HCP from influenza.61 Although a second randomized controlled trial initially reported a difference between respirators and surgical masks, adjustment for the clustered randomization and multiple outcomes yielded no statistical significance between the two types of respiratory protection.62 If patients with influenza must undergo aerosol-generating procedures, such as bronchoscopy, sputum induction, intubation/extubation, cardiopulmonary resuscitation, or autopsy, HCP should wear respiratory protection equivalent to a fitted N95 filtering respirator mask and perform these procedures in a negative pressure room, if feasible.63\n",

Despite recommendations for vaccination and evidence supporting its use, HCP vaccination rates have been traditionally low (45% during the 2007\u20132008 season).76 Barriers to vaccination include fear of needles and vaccine side effects, inconvenience, failure of the employer to pay for the vaccine, doubt about the risk of influenza, perceived lack of vaccine effectiveness, and failure to recognize the role of HCP in transmission of influenza to patients.36, 77 Strategies for improving acceptance of vaccine by HCP have been published, and fortunately vaccination rates among HCP have increased in recent years.36, 77 Many health care organizations have now adopted a policy requiring annual influenza vaccination of all HCP as a condition of employment because of the patient safety ramifications of an unvaccinated workforce.77 In 2013, multiple professional societies and safety advocacy organizations endorsed policies for mandatory influenza vaccination for HCP (Box 1\n). In 2015, the National Patient Safety Foundation Board advocated for two \u201cmust do\u2019s\u201d for HCP to ensure patient safety: hand washing and HCP influenza vaccination.78 During the 2014 to 2015 influenza season, HCP vaccination rate was 44% in clinical settings where influenza vaccines were not required, promoted, or offered on site, whereas HCP vaccination rate was 96% in clinical settings where vaccination was required.79\nBox 1Professional societies and safety advocacy organisms that recommend mandatory HCP influenza immunization\nAmerican Academy of Family Physicians (AAFP)American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP)American College of Physicians (ACP)American Hospital Association (AHA)American Medical Directors Association (AMDA)American Nurses Association (ANA)American Pharmacists AssociationAmerican Public Health Association (APHA)Association for Professionals in Infection Control and Epidemiology (APIC)Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA)National Association of County & City Health Officials (NACCHO)National Business Group on HealthNational Foundation for Infectious Diseases (NFID)National Patient Safety Foundation (NPSF)Society for Healthcare Epidemiology of America (SHEA)United States Department of Defense\n",
