Its genome is approximately 15.4-kb containing a 5\u2032- and a 3\u2032-untranslated region (UTR) and 10 open reading frames (Conzelmann et al., 1993, Johnson et al., 2011, Meng et al., 1994, Meulenberg et al., 1993). It encodes at least 16 non-structural proteins involved in the processing of viral proteolysis, genome replication, transcription and evading host immune responses, which include four proteases (Nsp1\u03b1, Nsp1\u03b2, Nsp2, and Nsp4), the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (Nsp9), a helicase (Nsp10), and an endonuclease (Nsp11) (Dokland, 2010, Fang et al., 2012, Snijder and Meulenberg, 1998, Ziebuhr et al., 2000). It also encodes eight structural proteins including the membrane glycoproteins Gp2a, Gp2b, Gp3, Gp4, Gp5, and Gp5a, the matrix protein (M), and the nucleocapsid protein (N) involved in the process of viral entry, assembling, and release (Dea et al., 2000, Johnson et al., 2011, Meulenberg et al., 1995). These viral proteins are associated with certain host factors to control the whole process of PRRSV infection.",

Recently, there have been devastating outbreaks of atypical PRRS caused by a highly pathogenic PRRSV (HP-PRRSV) strain in China, which is characterized by high fever, high morbidity, and high mortality in all age pigs (Zhou and Yang, 2010). PRRSV has a very narrow cell tropism, showing a preference for cells of the monocyte/macrophage lineage in vivo (Duan et al., 1997). PRSSV is also sustained by MA-104 cell line derived from African green monkey kidney and its derivatives (MARC-145 and CL2621) in vitro (Kim et al., 1993). This cell tropism is mainly determined by the presence or absence of specific receptors in the target cells. PRRSV enters cells via receptor-mediated endocytosis, and heparan sulfate, sialoadhesin, and CD163 are known as the main PRRSV receptors (Van Breedam et al., 2010a). CD163, a macrophage differentiation membrane antigen belonging to the scavenger receptor cysteine-rich (SRCR) family, is shown to be capable of mediating PRRSV infection in non-permissive cells (Calvert et al., 2007).",

The strong evidence for this theory is the presence of lipid rafts that are specialized lipid domains enriched in sphingolipid, cholesterol, and a subclass of membrane proteins (Munro, 2003, Simons and Ikonen, 1997). Rafts can incorporate or exclude proteins selectively and coalesce into large domains to form platforms that function in many cellular processes including signal transduction, membrane trafficking, cytoskeletal organization, and pathogen infection (Brown and London, 2000, Simons and Toomre, 2000). Since lipid rafts are rich in sphingolipid and cholesterol, its resistance to cold detergent extraction has been widely used as an index (Harder et al., 1998).",

            "text": "Lipid rafts are utilized in the lifecycle of numerous enveloped viruses. Many enveloped viruses exploit lipid rafts for their entry stages, in which the viral enveloped glycoproteins probably insert into lipid rafts to interact with the raft-located receptors or convert from their native state to activated form to initiate or facilitate viral internalization and/or fusion (Ahn et al., 2002, Bender et al., 2003, Popik et al., 2002). Lipid rafts are also found in the intracellular structures and many special proteins such as arrays of signal transduction proteins and some viral non-structural proteins are found in lipid rafts on plasma membrane and intracellular membranes, which contribute to efficient trafficking, replication, assembly, and budding (Aizaki et al., 2004, Barman and Nayak, 2007, Bhattacharya et al., 2006, Ono and Freed, 2001). In addition, for certain viruses, the viral membrane shows similar structure to lipid raft in cell membrane, and is critical for their efficient infections (Brugger et al., 2006, Graham et al., 2003). Recently, it was reported that cholesterol-depletion drugs could inhibit PRRSV infection and influence PRRSV entry to Marc-145 cells (Huang et al., 2011). However, there is a lack of detailed and direct evidence to prove whether lipid rafts function in PRRSV entry process. Moreover, we still have little information about whether lipid rafts are required in PRRSV infection and how PRRSV utilizes lipid rafts. Here, we provide more evidence to verify that PRRSV entry is associated with lipid rafts. In addition, we show that lipid rafts in cell membrane play an important role in PRRSV replication and release, and lipid rafts in PRRSV envelope are also critical for its infection.",

Previous studies have shown that upon treatment with M\u03b2CD membrane cholesterol levels will remain low for 9\u201312 h (Li et al., 2007, Rojek et al., 2008). Indeed, treatment with M\u03b2CD for 1 h effectively reduced the level of cellular cholesterol in both Marc-145 cells and PAMs by approximate 80\u201390% compared to that in untreated cells at the concentration of 20 mM (\nFig. 1A). Moreover, 2 h following treatment with 30 mM M\u03b2CD, the Marc-145 cells or PAMs retained relative viability of 100% compared with controls (Fig. 1B), ruling out the possible nonspecific effects of cytotoxicity caused by M\u03b2CD. Next, we treated Marc-145 cells with M\u03b2CD (0, 2.5, 5, 7.5, 10, and 20 mM) for 1 h prior to infection with PRRSV strain CH1a (MOI=1), and examined PRRSV infection using indirect immunofluorescent staining and quantified PRRSV titers of the supernatant 24 h post infection. As shown in Fig. 1C and D, CH1a infection was significantly inhibited by M\u03b2CD in a dose-dependent manner. And a titer-reduction of more than 104-fold was observed at the concentration of 20 mM when compared with the non-M\u03b2CD-treated cells (Fig. 1D). To investigate whether this anti-PRRSV activity is strain specific, we did the same treatment with PAMs and then infected it with HP-PRRSV strain Hpv (MOI=1). Our results showed that M\u03b2CD also inhibited Hpv infection in PAMs, and a more than 1000-fold suppression was observed at the concentration of 20 mM (Fig. 1E).",

A moderate staining of Gp3 and Gp4 proteins was present in the caveolin-rich raft-fraction, indicating that PRRSV Gp3 and Gp4 enveloped proteins were associated with lipid rafts during entry. However, the protein Gp5 was almost excluded from the lipid raft fractions and recovered in non-raft fractions associated with the non-raft maker CD71 (Harder et al., 1998).

Since the enveloped proteins of PRRSV associated with lipid rafts on plasma membrane are Gp3 and Gp4 but not Gp5, we assume that CD163 might be located in lipid raft microdomains. To verify this hypothesis, we also studied the distribution of CD163 during PRRSV entry (Fig. 3A). As expected, CD163 was found to be enriched in the raft-fractions, indicating that CD163 may be a raft-located receptor. However, it is also possible that binding of glycoproteins of PRRSV to rafts recruits CD163 to these domains from non-raft components. Thus, we next investigated whether CD163 was a raft-protein in uninfected cells. We transfected CD163 into Hela cells and then treated cells with 20 mM M\u03b2CD for 1 h at 24 h post transfection. The CD163 distribution on M\u03b2CD-treated cell membrane was compared with that of untreated cells using Immunofluorescent assay. As shown in Fig. 3C, CD163 proteins on untreated cellular membrane were speckled while these spots disappeared and changed into a uniform distribution on cellular membrane upon M\u03b2CD treatment. To further confirm the CD163 location in uninfected PAMs, we directly used sucrose gradients to isolate detergent-insoluble fractions from PAMs and performed immunoblot to analyze CD163 in fractions (Fig. 3D). A substantial portion of CD163 was found to be restricted in the raft-fractions. These results suggest that CD163 proteins are distributed in lipid rafts on cell membrane in PAMs, which may mediate the association of PRRSV glycoproteins with rafts during viral entry.",

Some of these viruses induce distinct membrane structural scaffold to provide platforms for viral RNA replication, such as the formation of lipid raft associated HCV RNA replication complex (Aizaki et al., 2004, Gosert et al., 2002, Westaway et al., 1997). Therefore, we attempted to investigate whether lipid rafts are required for PRRSV RNA production. We infected PAMs with the Hpv (MOI=1) and then replaced the cell medium with fresh medium containing 10 mM M\u03b2CD 12 h later. Viral RNA levels in cells were quantitated using real-time PCR at 0, 6, and 12 h after medium switching (\nFig. 4A). Compared with the PBS-treated cells, a significant reduction of the intracellular viral RNA was observed after M\u03b2CD treatment, suggesting that lipid rafts might be involved in PRRSV replication. Next, we further examined the distribution of Nsp9, the RNA dependent RNA polymerase of PRRSV after flotation analysis of PAMs which were infected with Hpv (MOI=1) for 24 h (Fig. 4B). Significantly, a substantial portion of Nsp9 was in the fraction referred to be as the lipid raft. However, when these infected PAMs were treated with 20 mM M\u03b2CD for 1 h, little lipid rafts were isolated and Nsp9 were co-recovered with CD71 (Fig. 4C). These results suggest that PRRSV RNA synthesis may occur in lipid raft membrane microdomains.",

Thus, we attempted to investigate the effect of cholesterol depletion by M\u03b2CD treatment on PRRSV release. Marc-145 cells and PAMs were infected with CH1a and Hpv for 24 h, respectively, and then medium was replaced with fresh medium containing M\u03b2CD (0, 10, and 20 mM). At 1 h later, the amount of virus released into the medium was quantified by analysis of PRRSV envelope protein Gp5 (\nFig. 5A). Our results showed that the Gp5 release was enhanced with the increasing concentration of M\u03b2CD treatment. However, the RNA level and titer of the released virus particles had no obvious difference when treated with either 10 mM or 20 mM M\u03b2CD compared to that of the no-treatment control (Fig. 5B and C). It is possible that M\u03b2CD-treatment causes the release of more immature viral particles from infected cells compared with that in untreated infected cells. There is also a possibility that M\u03b2CD-treatment changed the virion components of the released PRRSV particles.",

As shown in\nFig. 7A, the amount of N protein exhibited a dose-dependent reduction induced by M\u03b2CD treatment, while the amount of Gp5 was fairly constant up to 80 mM M\u03b2CD. The permeabilization was defined as a greater decrease of the capsid protein relative to the envelope glycoprotein. Thus, depletion of cholesterol from viral envelope resulted in permeabilization of PRRSV virions. We also tested the viral RNA levels of the M\u03b2CD-treated CH1a virions to determine whether viral RNA is retained in PRRSV virions (Fig. 7B). Our results showed little change in the amount of viral RNA in CH1a virions after M\u03b2CD treatment, suggesting that PRRSV particles do not lose viral RNA after permeabilization by M\u03b2CD. These results reveal that depletion of viral cholesterol may impair PRRSV infectivity due to the virion disruption and leak of nucleocapsid protein.",

Thus, cholesterol is a major component of lipid raft microdomains, and manipulation of cholesterol present within membranes is frequently used to implicate lipid rafts. Therefore, we further investigated whether and how PRRSV infection was affected by cellular lipid rafts. PRRSV entry process is mediated by receptor-specific endocytosis, where the virus attachment, internalization and membrane fusion occur sequentially (Nauwynck et al., 1999). Previous study has reported the significant suppression of cellular cholesterol depletion on PRRSV entry, which is in consistent with our results (Sun et al., 2011). These results are similar to the findings observed on some other members of the order Nidovirales such as HCoV-229E, MHV and SARS-CoV (Choi et al., 2005, Li et al., 2007, Nomura et al., 2004, Thorp and Gallagher, 2004). However, how lipid rafts contribute to PRRSV entry is not explicit, Although it has been reported that Gp4 is located in lipid rafts when it is exogenously expressed in HeLa cells and that Gp4 and CD163 co-located in lipid rafts in a porcine kidney cell line (Du et al., 2012), there is no direct and convincing evidence to show the association of Gp4, CD163, and other glycoproteins with lipid rafts in PAMs during PRRSV entry. By the use of Triton X-100 extract and discontinuous sucrose gradient fractionation, we showed that the viral envelope proteins Gp3 and Gp4, but not Gp5, were partitioned in lipid rafts during virus penetration of PAMs. These results correspond well with their roles in PRRSV entry. Gp5 interacts with the sialoadhesin receptor to mediate virus-cell binding and initial endocytosis (Van Breedam et al., 2010b), while Gp3 and Gp4, which form trimers with Gp2, interacting with CD163 are essential for the following internalization and fusion (Van Gorp et al., 2010). These data imply that lipid rafts probably utilize cellular receptor CD163 to mediate its association with PRRSV envelope proteins during entry. Consistent with this assumption, we showed that CD163 was mainly located in lipid raft microdomain of PAM membrane, and the distribution of the CD163 on cell membrane was found to be altered by cholesterol depletion. Moreover, PRRSV enters cells by a process of clathrin-mediated endocytosis which is distinguished from lipid raft-mediated endocytosis pathway (Kreutz and Ackermann, 1996, Mercer et al., 2010, Nauwynck et al., 1999). Therefore, we infer that lipid rafts probably contribute to membrane fusion but not endocytosis in PRRSV entry. The glycoproteins\u2013receptor interaction may trigger the raft clustering to form platforms, which may function in PRRSV membrane fusion.",

            "text": "Viral RNA replication is a multistep process involving a replication complex that is formed by viral and cellular components with the viral genomic RNA template. This replication complex is embedded within particular virus-induced membrane vesicles, which serve as the anchoring sites for the PRRSV replication complex to mediate migration of the replication complex between cellular organelles (Bost et al., 2003, den Boon and Ahlquist, 2010, Netherton and Wileman, 2011). In the present study, a significant reduction of the intracellular viral RNA resulted from cholesterol depletion, indicating that lipid rafts are probably involved in PRRSV RNA production. PRRSV replication is directed by at least 14 replicase proteins that have both common enzymatic activities, especially the viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase Nsp9 (Fang and Snijder, 2010, Yun and Lee, 2013). Flotation analysis of infected PAMs showed that Nsp9 was distributed in lipid raft fractions. Thus, lipid rafts might serve as the sites for viral RNA replication complex anchored to PRRSV-induced special membrane structural scaffold. However, the precise mechanism for this association of special membrane structure with viral replication complex remains to be determined. Membrane lipid rafts have been implicated in the assembly and release of many enveloped viruses. Our results also showed that lipid raft disruption increased the release of PRRSV particles. For some virus such as influenza virus, lipid rafts and their underlying cortical cytoskeleton probably provide a framework for specific and ordered viral protein-protein interactions required for proper assembly (Roberts and Compans, 1998, Simpson-Holley et al., 2002). Cholesterol depletion could induce rearrangement of the cortical actin cytoskeleton in many cells and cortical actin rearrangements also could induce reorganization of lipid raft microdomains (Chadda et al., 2007, Francis et al., 1999, Simpson-Holley et al., 2002). Therefore, perturbation of actin cytoskeleton caused by cholesterol depletion might contribute to the enhanced release of PRRSV particles envelope proteins. However, no increase in viral RNA level or virus infectivity was observed for the PRRSV particles released from lipid raft disrupted cells. It is possible that lipid raft disruption might induce abnormal assembly and release of PRRSV particles.",

            "text": "Cholesterol depletion may also mediate disruption of PRRSV particles and directly cause the reduction in viral infectivity. PRRSV virions contain a certain amount of cholesterol and this lipid feature seems to be critical in sustaining its integrity. Our results showed that both CH1a and Hpv infectivity was decreased in a dose-dependent manner when the viruses were treated with cholesterol-depletion drug. Measuring the residual cholesterol in PRRSV virions exposed to increasing concentrations of M\u03b2CD indicated that the loss of infectivity was closely associated with reduction in virion cholesterol. The loss of viral infectivity after cholesterol depletion is likely due to partly structure destruction such as loss of viral structure proteins or loss of viral RNA. Indeed, PRRSV viral envelopes were permeabilized when treated with M\u03b2CD at a high concentration, evidenced by the loss of PRRSV nucleoprotein (N). Accordingly, we were unable to completely restore virus infectivity by adding back cholesterol to permeabilized virions. Presumably, even though the large holes in the viral membrane can be repaired by cholesterol, patching the membrane probably cannot overcome the loss of critical viral proteins. Recent cryo-electron tomographic structure determination of PRRSV has provided a possible model for the nucleocapsid\u2013RNA organization in the virion. This model speculates that two layers of N dimers form a linked, twisted chain with the RNA in the middle, and this chain is then bundled into a roughly spherical shape that leaves a hollow interior (Dokland, 2010, Spilman et al., 2009). The disordered appearance of the PRRSV core may suggest a more loosely organized nucleocapsid which makes it easier for the N protein to leak upon M\u03b2CD treatment. However, the permeabilization of PRRSV virions may not be enough to result in the loss of the entire genome. Therefore, disassembly of lipid rafts on the virus envelope affected integrity of viral envelope and caused the viral envelope leakage of viral proteins to adversely affect virus infectivity.",

These findings promote us to further investigate how viral proteins are associated with lipid rafts and how lipid raft domains function in the organization of a mature PRRSV particle production. Also, the perturbation of membrane lipid rafts by small molecules to interfere with PRRSV infection could provide a means for development of antiviral agents.",
