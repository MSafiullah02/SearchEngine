            "text": "The global burden of cancer is huge and growing larger every year. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), more than 11 million people are diagnosed with cancer worldwide every year and this number is expected to increase to 16 million by the year 2020. More than 8 million, or 13% of overall deaths, are directly caused by cancer worldwide every year. The relative rate of cancer-caused mortality is even higher in the developed countries, as it accounts for more than 20% of all deaths [1]. Although cancer therapies have improved significantly in recent years, the development of chemoresistance has severely limited the choice of available anticancer drugs. This clearly highlights the urgent need for novel chemotherapeutic agents for more effective treatment of cancer [2], [3], [4], [5].",

            "text": "The 4-aminoquinoline scaffold is found in the majority of drugs commonly used for the treatment of malaria. The class of compounds containing a 4-aminoquinoline moiety (\nFig. 1) was the first to be used for the successful treatment of malaria, and is still the drug of choice [6], [7], [8]. Chloroquine (CQ) is a well-known anti-malarial drug possessing a 4-aminoquinoline scaffold, and it has been shown to have antiviral effects on the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) causative agents [9], [10], [11]. CQ is currently in clinical trials as an investigational antiretroviral agent in humans with HIV-1/AIDS, who often develop tumors, particularly when survival has been prolonged by antiretroviral treatments [12], [13]. Recently, CQ has also been added to a conventional therapy protocol (i.e., surgery + radiotherapy + chemotherapy) for HIV-1 seronegative glioblastoma patients [14]. We have recently demonstrated that CQ significantly increases the cytotoxic effects on MDA-MB 231 cells when combined with radiation [15]. The present work is an extension of our ongoing efforts towards developing new, effective anti-cancer agents. To this end, we synthesized several 4-aminoquinoline derivatives and examined their cytotoxic effects on MDA-MB 468 and MCF-7 breast cancer cell lines. We found that some of these compounds are very effective.",

After exposure to drugs for 24 h, cells were fixed in situ with TCA to represent a measurement of the cell population for each cell line at the time of drug addition (T\nz). Experimental drugs used were solubilized in dimethyl sulfoxide at 400-fold of the desired final maximum test concentration, and were then stored frozen prior to use. At the time of drug addition, an aliquot of the frozen stock was thawed and diluted twice to the desired final maximum test concentration with complete medium. Two-fold log serial dilutions were made to provide a total of seven drug concentrations plus a control.

The alkyl aminoquinoline derivatives (2,3) were prepared by refluxing 7-substituted-4-chloro-quinoline with butyl amine in neat conditions. The aminoquinoline compound (4) was synthesized by refluxing 4,7-dichloroquinoline with an excess of ethane-1,2-diamine in which the temperature was raised slowly and maintained at 80 \u00b0C over 1 h while stirring. The temperature was raised further to 130 \u00b0C and maintained at that temperature for 7 h with continuous stirring. The dimethyl alkyl aminoquinoline derivatives (5\u20139) were also synthesized by a single-step reaction, in which appropriate 7-substituted-4-chloro-quinoline reacts with N,N-dimethyl-alkyl-diamine in neat conditions. The bisquinoline compounds (10,11) were obtained by excess of 7-substituted-4-chloro-quinoline reacting with one mole of alkyl diamine during which the temperature was kept at 130 \u00b0C for 6 h. The mass spectra of all the synthesized compounds were in conformity with their assigned structures. The mass spectra of these compounds showed molecular ion peaks corresponding to their molecular formulas (\nTable 1). Elemental (C, H, N) analysis satisfactorily confirmed elemental compositions and the purity of the synthesized compounds (Table 1).

The drugs at the concentration of 100 \u03bcM were diluted to 1.625 \u03bcM by two-fold serial dilutions. Following the incubation for 48 h in a drug, the cells were treated with SRB to measure their growth/viability (% of the untreated control) using a spectrophotometer as described previously [17]. The reading of SRB staining is known to accurately reflect the levels of total cellular macromolecules [17]. The GI50 concentration for each derivative was calculated with reference to a standard curve (control cells), which represents the concentration that results in a 50% decrease in cell growth after 3 days of incubation. For each compound, the 50% growth inhibition (GI50) was determined and reported in\nTable 3. The data for CQ, amodiaquine and mefloquine were included for comparison. The data showed that these derivatives have significant cytotoxicity against the cell lines screened. Among the nine compounds tested, two compounds showed a GI50 range of 7.35\u20138.73 \u03bcM against MDA-MB468 cells, and one compound showed a GI50 at 8.22 \u03bcM against MCF-7 cells. The remaining seven compounds showed GI50 values above the 10.85 \u03bcM, but not more than 13.72 \u03bcM against MDA-MB468 cells. In the case of MCF-7 cells, the six compounds tested showed GI50 in the range of 11.52\u201314.47 \u03bcM, the remaining two compounds showed GI50 values above 36.77 \u03bcM, but not more than 51.57 \u03bcM. The differences in the GI50 values may be attributable to factors such as the nature of substitution at the seventh positions, the side-chains, and the genetic and biochemical background of the cell lines.",

            "text": "As for compound 2, the replacement of the chloro group with a fluoro group (3) led to an increase in cytotoxicity against MDA-MB-468 cells. It also showed a similar result with MCF-7 cells. In case of the aminoquinoline compound 4 (GI50\n = 11.01 \u03bcM), cytotoxicity increased by 2-fold in comparison to CQ (GI50\n = 24.36 \u03bcM) against MDA-MB-468 cells. With MCF-7 cell lines, however, the compound 4 showed lower cytotoxicity (GI50\n = 51.57 \u03bcM) than CQ (GI50\n = 20.72 \u03bcM). The dimethyl alkyl aminoquinoline derivatives with the 7-chloro substitution of compound 5 showed drastically increased (5-fold) cytotoxicity (GI50\n = 8.73 \u03bcM) against MDA-MB-468 cells in comparison to CQ. However, replacement of the chloro group with a fluoro (6, GI50\n = 11.47 \u03bcM), trifluoromethyl (7, GI50\n = 12.85 \u03bcM) and a methoxy group (8, GI50\n = 14.09 \u03bcM) led to a decrease in cytotoxicity against MDA-MB-468 cells. Interestingly, in the MCF-7 cell lines, these results were in reverse order, and the compound substituted with a chloro group (5, GI50\n = 36.77 \u03bcM) was less active in comparison to that of substituted with a methoxy group (8, GI50\n = 12.90 \u03bcM). The bisquinoline compound 10 (GI50\n = 7.35 \u03bcM) showed 3-fold increased activity in MDA-MB-468 cells, compared to CQ. It is interesting to note that the same compound showed lower activity (GI50\n = 14.80 M) in the MCF-7 cell line. Compound 11 is insoluble in DMSO; therefore, we were not able to examine cytotoxicity on cultured cells. Further structural modifications are in progress to increase specificity and cytotoxicity on cancer cells by 4-aminoquinoline derivatives.",
