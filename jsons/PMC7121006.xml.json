Six regional committees, located in the Americas, Europe, the Eastern Mediterranean, South-East Asia, the Western Pacific, and Africa, focus on regional health concerns.",

It can be used in resource-limited settings, is widely used in Africa and Asia, and has been used in research focusing on progression to symptomatic HIV disease. Most of these conditions are opportunistic infections that can be easily treated in healthy people. The staging system is different for adults and adolescents and children.",

The term interim was used because the evidence was incomplete at that time. Since then, additional evidence has been obtained from randomized controlled trials, observational studies, operational research, and the identification of best practices from programmatic implementation of the collaborative TB/HIV activities recommended by the policy. A number of TB and HIV guidelines and policy recommendations have been developed by WHO\u2019s Stop TB and HIV/AIDS departments.",

The WHO Global Health Sector Strategy on HIV/AIDS: Getting to Zero, and the UNICEF\u2019s strategic and programmatic focus on equity will emphasize the need to tailor national HIV responses to the local epidemics, to decentralize programs, and to integrate with other health and community services to achieve the greatest impact.",

The Global Health Sector Strategy on HIV/AIDS, endorsed by all WHO Member States in May 2011, guides national HIV responses in the health sector and outlines the role of WHO and other partners in achieving targets. The strategy focuses on four strategic directions: optimizing HIV prevention, diagnosis treatment and care; leveraging broader health outcomes through HIV responses; building strong and sustainable health and community systems; and reducing vulnerability and removing structural barriers that impede access to needed services. The prevention of mother-to-child HIV transmission through increased access to antiretroviral therapy and prophylaxis has energized the efforts of UN members to eliminate new infections among children and improve maternal health.",
