            "text": "While a wide range of disinfectants may be used in high-income settings, including chlorine, alcohol-based products, glutaraldehyde, quaternary ammonium compounds, and hydrogen peroxide (12) , disinfection in low-income and emergency settings with limited access to basic supplies (\"low-resource\") is primarily chlorine-based, as this disinfectant is inexpensive and widely available. Another advantage of chlorine is its broad microbicidal spectrum, while disadvantages include corrosive and irritant properties at high concentrations, potential surface staining, inactivation by organic matter, as well as rapid chlorine decay in solution for some chlorine compounds (12, 13) . Four chlorine compounds are commonly used in emergency response. Sodium hypochlorite (NaOCl), also referred to as household bleach, is widely available as a stabilized (pH [9] [10] [11] , colorless liquid at concentrations 4,000-6,000 ppm and a shelf-life of at least a month at 25-30\u00b0C (13, 14) . Electrolyzed water -or generated NaOCl (gNaOCl) -is produced by electrolysis of a salt (NaCl) solution, has a close-to-neutral pH, and is generated on site, as it expires in days to weeks without stabilization (13) . In addition to hypochlorous acid, gNaOCl may contain reactive oxygen species that contribute to disinfection (15) . Sodium dichloroisocyanurate (NaDCC) is available as a stable powder; once in solution, however, it has a low pH (~6) and short shelf-life as it decays rapidly (within hours) (13) . It has been reported to be less sensitive to inactivation by organic matter than other chlorine compounds (16) . Finally, calcium hypochlorite or high-test hypochlorite (HTH) is a salt of hypochlorite, like NaOCl, however it is more commonly found in granular form and produces solutions at pH 9-11 that are as stable as NaOCl (13, 14) .",

The hepatitis A virus produces explosive outbreaks, and causes approximately 1.4 million cases per year, primarily in areas without adequate water, sanitation and hygiene (35, 36) . Rotavirus is responsible for approximately half of the global diarrheal disease burden of 215,000 annual deaths in children under 5 years, concentrated in low-income countries (37, 38) .

Reported chlorine disinfection efficacy outcomes against the seven selected pathogens with potential to cause outbreaks in low-resource settings are summarized in Table 4 , and narratively in text below. Please note we found no data in this review to inform surface disinfection efficacy against Shigella spp. or pathogens listed on the WHO Blueprint list of priority pathogens (41) other than the Ebola virus. Mycobacterium tuberculosis were used in only one study where exposure to 6,000-10,000 ppm NaOCl and NaDCC for 1 minute (CT = 6,000-10,000 mg\u00d7min/L) on stainless steel produced 2.08-3.20 log reduction in absence of soil load and 2.28-3.22 log reductions when sputum was added (44) . Best et al. (44) noted that M. tuberculosis is not typically used in disinfection studies due to safety concerns and slow growth, and tested M. smegmatitis as a potential non-pathogenic and faster-growing surrogate for M. tuberculosis. Varying levels of resistance were observed depending on the tested disinfectant. When exposed to sodium hypochlorite, M. smegmatitis appeared less resistant than M. tuberculosis, highlighting the need to interpret surrogate testing results with caution (44) . Other bacteria from the same genus, M. terrae, underwent 8.19 log reduction following exposure to 2,500 ppm sodium hypochlorite for 5 minutes (CT = 12,500 mg\u00d7min/L) (54) . The limited log reduction observed for treatment with CT up to 10,000 mg\u00d7min/L for Mycobacterium tuberculosis and the high variation in log reductions for related surrogates highlights the need for further evaluation of effective disinfection strategies. Specifically, there is a data gap on exposure times and concentrations producing CT factors higher than 10,000 mg\u00d7min/L against M. tuberculosis. Treatments producing CT factors below 10,000 mg\u00d7min/L are likely insufficient for M. tuberculosis disinfection. The resistance of Vibrio cholerae to chlorine was evaluated in a study focused on improving US preparedness to bioterrorism threats (45) . Chlorine (pH-amended bleach, 6,200 ppm, pH 6. E. coli and P. aeruginosa are two Gram-negative bacteria widely used in surface disinfection efficacy testing and results from studies using these bacteria may provide insight into disinfection of other Gram-negative bacteria including V. cholera and Salmonella spp. (Table S2 ). Relatively high log reductions (4.7 to >7.3) were reported for E. coli across a range of surfaces and CT factors (200-50,000 mg\u00d7min/L). The CT factors reported to achieve 5 to >6 log reductions in the only study with V. cholerae identified in this review were much higher (93,000-186,000 mg\u00d7min/L) than those observed to achieve similar log reduction values (LRV) in E. coli (45) . However, in experiments using NaDCC on six different surfaces (CT = 200-2,000 mg\u00d7min/L), we observed consistently higher reductions in culturable V. cholerae (5.4-7.0 log) compared to E. coli (1.4->6.9) (63). E. coli and Salmonella spp. exhibit similar sensitivities to gNaOCl (47, 50) . While less than 3 log reductions were observed in Salmonella spp. in two studies, with CT factors between 20,000 and 24,000 mg\u00d7min/L for NaOCl and NaDCC (46,49), Riazi et al. (48) reported 2, 4, and 5 log reductions in P. aeruginosa, E. coli, and S. Enteritidis, respectively, exposed to NaOCl (CT = 2,560 mg\u00d7min/L).",

For example, CT factors on the order of 200,000 mg\u00d7min/L could be targeted for disinfection in cholera outbreaks; however, as this may be challenging to implement in practice and data suggest that lower CT factors may be efficacious, future disinfection efficacy assessments should test lower CT factors against V. cholerae. For Salmonella spp., using CT factors >24,000 mg\u00d7min/L is likely necessary to ensure 5 log reduction and further studies are needed to confirm the efficacy and reliability of gNaOCl at low CT factors (<3,000 mg\u00d7min/L) against Gram-negative bacteria.",

Several surrogates have been proposed for human norovirus to overcome the absence of infectivity assay, including murine norovirus and MS2 (3, 15, 49, 60, 62, (67) (68) (69) (70) , feline calicivirus (3, 62, (67) (68) (69) (70) (71) (72) , and Tulane virus (61, 62) . Comparisons between human norovirus and the proposed surrogates were made in four studies. Park and Sobsey (69) determined that similar times (CT = 94-380 mg\u00d7min/L) were required for a 3-log inactivation in human norovirus, murine norovirus, and MS2 exposed to gNaOCl on stainless steel and noted that MS2 resembles human norovirus in terms of persistence and elution from surfaces. Overall, no single virus stands out as a particularly good surrogate for human norovirus in this review and evidence to support chlorine-based disinfection efficacy against human norovirus remains weak; gNaOCl appears as an interesting option but with inconsistent results reported so far. Further testing of gNaOCl to verify reproducibility and alternative disinfectants should be considered. In the absence of additional data to refine estimates, disinfection for norovirus should be conservative and rely on combinations of chlorine concentrations and exposure times that yield CT factors substantially greater than 20,000 mg\u00d7min/L in order to achieve at least 3 log reduction.",

Of the 89 studies investigated, the most common disinfectant application modes were pipetting (n = 54, 61%), immersion (n= 20, 22%), spraying (n = 8, 9%), or wiping (n = 5, 6%). Because disinfection is often combined with cleaning procedures, wiping was investigated and was found to have an effect on viruses and spores even in absence of disinfectant, suggesting that the mechanical action of wiping contributes to reducing contamination levels on surfaces (49, 74) . With spraying, ensuring contact between disinfectant and test organisms can be challenging (75, 76) . Additionally, chlorine loss during the process -from spray nozzle to the targeted surface -is a concern (77). Ni et al. (2016) found consistent increases in efficacy with increasing disinfectant spraying time from 0.5 to 2 minutes and keeping similar exposure times after spraying. A proposed explanation for variable efficacies observed between studies is the use of different spraying equipment, such as gas-powered pressurized sprayers producing high spray velocities and hand-held spray bottles (78) .",

Amongst the 89 studies identified, 27 (30%) tested more than one surface, including 13 (15%) that used porous surfaces (ceramic, fabric, rubber or wood). Porous surfaces were identified as more challenging to disinfect in 8 of these 13 studies. For chlorine-based disinfection in particular, Baek et al. (86) observed lower inactivation in E. coli on wood (3.34 log) and rubber (4.69 log) compared to non-porous surfaces such as stainless steel, glass and polyethylene (5.05-5.18 log) after exposure to NaOCl. While Park et al. (80) found no difference in gNaOCl efficacy against S. aureus on five non-porous surfaces (1.7-1.9 log), Kim et al. (87) reported consistently lower log reductions in S. aureus on scratched polyethylene, polypropylene, glass, and stainless steel compared to the same surfaces without scratches after disinfection with NaOCl. The influence of surface structure on disinfection is further affirmed with observations in another study that E. coli was more challenging to disinfect on heavy duty tarp compared to smoother surfaces like nitrile and stainless steel (83) . Lombardi et al. (85) observed lower log reductions in LPAIV on wood (0.0-1.9) compared to metal (3.1-3.7) and plastic (3.9-4.3) surfaces after exposure to 750 ppm NaOCl or HTH for 10 minutes. Julian et al. (15) compared gNaOCl and NaOCl on PVC and stainless steel; surface type was statistically significant for murine norovirus inactivation (overall higher on PVC) but not for MS2. Yeargin et al. (88) also found that glass and polyester were easier to disinfect than cotton using 5,000 ppm NaOCl with a 5minute exposure time, with 4.5-5.5 log reduction in murine norovirus and feline calicivirus on glass, 4.3-5.1 log reduction on polyester, and 3.1 log reduction on cotton. Additionally, Yeargin et al. (88) noted that surface porosity and hydrophobicity impacted both disinfection efficacy and viral recovery for testing, with the latter potentially biasing disinfection efficacy estimates.",

A wide range of matrices representing soiled surfaces were used in included studies, from the standard ASTM formulation with tryptone, bovine serum albumin, and bovine mucin to human stool, serum, or shrimp and pork meat (Tables S1-S4). The impact of specific matrices used to represent soil loading on observed efficacies are unclear from this review, with the notable exception of the results reported above for the Ebola virus, which was more resistant to disinfection in human blood compared to other testing media (59) . Given the known impacts of chlorine demand on chlorine disinfection efficacy, the large variation in impacts of soil loading on efficacy is surprising. However, one potential explanation is the variation in chlorine demand of chosen specific matrices. For example, the formulation recommended in the ASTM standard has a low chlorine demand, and as such may not be appropriate to assess chlorine-based disinfection against pathogens that are shed in bodily fluids such as vomit and stool (83) . The soil load selection is a good example of the trade-off needed between testing conditions that are relevant to real-world applications (e.g. working with surfaces in contact with seafood) and generating efficacy data that can be compared to the existing literature and support the development of guidelines.",

Given the variation in study findings, we advocate conservative approaches to field disinfection relying on high CT factors for chlorine, driven largely by the assumption that chlorine-based disinfectants are readily available. We recommend following pathogenspecific target CT factors rather than aggregating pathogens by type (i.e., bacteria, virus, protozoa), as we believe that the latter would misrepresent the complexity of surface disinfection efficacy data. Specifically, the data extracted in this review supports use of the following conservative target CT factors: >15,000 mg\u00d7min/L for the hepatitis A virus, >20,000 mg\u00d7min/L for rotavirus and norovirus, and >80,000 mg\u00d7min/L for the Ebola virus, as relatively consistent evidence -although from small numbers of studies -was available for these pathogens. Data for Gram-negative bacteria exhibited particularly high variability, leading to a cautious (and possibly unrealistic) recommendation of 200,000 mg\u00d7min/L for V. cholerae and >24,000 mg\u00d7min/L for Salmonella spp. Insufficient data was available to formulate a recommendation for disinfection of M. tuberculosis. The appropriate combination of chlorine concentration and exposure time to achieve a given CT factor should be selected depending on safety concerns (as high chlorine concentrations may be irritant and corrosive) and practical considerations with regards to applicable exposure times, in compliance with relevant environmental and safety guidelines. Additional rigorous research is needed to better resolve (lower) recommendations for specific pathogens to ensure adequate protection of human health. Furthermore, studies to inform disinfection against the WHO Blueprint priority viruses (41) other than the Ebola virus are needed.",

            "text": "In this review, we also identified themes relevant to outbreak response in surface disinfection efficacy evaluations, including the influence of disinfectant application mode, selected chlorine compound, surface type, and soil load. Each of these is briefly summarized hereafter. Increases in observed inactivation with mechanical action (shaking during immersion, wiping) were reported, as well as specificities of spraying (equipment, spray characteristics, and spraying time matter). Comparisons between the four chlorine compounds typically available in emergency response suggest no clear difference in terms of efficacy. Several studies mentioned that porous surfaces are more challenging to disinfect -and to use in laboratory testing -than non-porous surfaces, which is a concern in outbreaks in healthcare facilities, where mattresses, linens, cloths may need to be disinfected, and in households, where an even wider range of porous materials (wood, ceramic, carpets) may be found. Soil load is expected to impact chlorine disinfection efficacy, as chlorine is inactivated by organic matter, though this review did not observe systematic reductions in efficacy due to soil load. This may be due to the wide range of substances used as soil loads. Notably, no matrix was identified that is known to accurately mimic bodily fluids excreted by cholera or Ebola patients and the development of appropriate soil load mixtures for laboratory testing is still needed.",

            "text": "Surface disinfection efficacy testing standards such as the ASTM Quantitative Disk Carrier test method (91) recommend the use of 1-cm stainless steel disks as surface carriers and chlorine is a widely available disinfectant that has been used for over a century (92) . It is therefore not surprising that most studies focus on stainless steel and chlorine. What is striking, however, is the variability in reported efficacies for similar test organisms, surface types, and disinfectants ( Figure 2 ), which made it infeasible to define appropriate aggregation categories to perform a meta-analysis. We hypothesize that this variability reflects the variability in testing procedures, which was also identified as a concern in large-scale, inter-laboratory studies for the development of standard methods, where researchers advocated for the use of large numbers of replicates (79, 82, 93) . For the registration of bactericidal disinfectants, the US Environmental Protection Agency requires tests to be carried out following the AOAC standard methods using 60 surface carriers on at least 3 different days, with a qualitative outcome after disinfection (positive/negative) (43) , while the quantitative ASTM standard method requires triplicate controls and a minimum of five replicates (91) . In this review, the average number of replicates for data points that passed full text screening was 3.9. A quantitative decision-making framework has recently been proposed by Parker et al. (94) to determine whether the achieved reproducibility for surface disinfection efficacy experiments is acceptable, and we recommend this be more widely adopted in reporting surface disinfection laboratory efficacy results. Lastly, the data extraction spreadsheet (available in Supplementary Materials) includes 1,421 data points that can be filtered by any user depending on the test organism, surface, or disinfectant of interest. We believe this database is a useful tool for those who are designing surface disinfection experiments or searching for specific disinfection efficacy data. This review focused on chlorine-based disinfectants because of their widespread availability and use in low-resource settings, however data was also extracted from studies using other disinfectants ( Table 2 ) and our dataset could be further analyzed to synthesize surface disinfection efficacy outcomes for alternative disinfectants or include additional test organisms.",

In view of the variability in efficacy outcomes observed in this review, replicating experiments over different days or periods of time to account for within-laboratory differences and changes in the resistance of test organisms, as suggested by Bloomfield et al. (93) , seems sensible. The following experimental information should be reported at a minimum: test organism preparation (e.g. washing, growth phase); surface inoculation method, including soil load and test organism concentration, drying time and conditions (e.g. temperature, relative humidity); surface carrier size; disinfectant ingredients, preparation, storage, concentration, application mode and exposure time; recovery methods; number of replicates (for both test and control carriers), and time of testing.",

While log reduction values are the most widespread measure of disinfection efficacy, they are sensitive to the inoculation level and recovery of test organisms in positive controls (81, 93) , which can affect comparisons between studies. A second limitation is the reliance on study descriptors (test organisms, surfaces, and disinfectants) during abstract screening to refine full text inclusion criteria, which may have resulted in the exclusion of some studies relevant to low-resource settings. Similarly, relevant studies published in languages other than those understood by our review team may have been missed. Furthermore, the requirement to only include disinfectants that have five or more relevant publications may have limited our ability to identify novel disinfectants potentially usable in outbreak response. Additionally, this systematic review primarily focused on the scientific literature. Alternative approaches such as screening US EPA-registered disinfectants for ease of use, cost, and international availability may allow identification of other relevant information for the development of recommendations for disinfection in low-resource settings.",

We therefore recommend that laboratory experiments increase reproducibility, for example through replicating experiments over different days or periods of time. More importantly, the high variation in the well-controlled laboratory experiments highlights the need for demonstrating sufficient efficacy under field conditions. We therefore strongly recommend field-based testing and monitoring to ensure effectiveness is achieved in situ. An efficient strategy for laboratory testing could be to conduct studies comparing priority pathogens to test organisms that have been widely studied, such as S. aureus and P. aeruginosa, feline calicivirus, murine norovirus and MS2, or Bacillus spp., so that existing data (available in Supplementary Materials) could be extrapolated to inform surface disinfection guideline development in lowresource settings with minimal additional laboratory testing.",

Reported reductions were >6 log on glass and aluminum after 15 minutes exposure time (CT = 93,000 mg\u00d7min/L) and approximately 5 log on carpet after two disinfectant applications and 30 minutes exposure time (CT = 186,000 mg\u00d7min/L). Efficacy could not be evaluated on wood and concrete due to poor recoveries.The studies investigating surface disinfection efficacy of Salmonella spp. included four studies on Salmonella enterica serovar Enteritidis and one on S. Typhimurium. Exposure of S. Enteritidis to NaOCl (800 ppm) resulted in 3 log reduction after 30 minutes on viscose without soil load (CT = 24,000 mg\u00d7min/L)(46). On stainless steel, Riazi et al.(48) reported increasing log reductions (up to 5 log) in S. Enteritidis with increasing NaOCl concentrations (up to 512 ppm) applied for 5 minutes in absence of soil load (CT = 2,560 mg\u00d7min/L), whereas Tuladhar et al.(49), who assessed the effect of wiping a surface contaminated with S. Enteritidis with a cloth soaked in NaDCC (1,000 ppm), observed a maximum inactivation of 2.9 log after 20 minutes (CT = 20,000 mg\u00d7min/L).

Increasing exposure time only had an effect in absence of soil load, with 5.0 log inactivation in human norovirus reported after 30 minutes (CT = 7,500 mg\u00d7min/L) (61). Cromeans et al.
