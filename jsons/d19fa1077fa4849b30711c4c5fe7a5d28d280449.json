            "text": "Since 2008, the kiwifruit industry has been devastated by a pandemic outbreak of Pseudomonas syringae pv. actinidiae (Psa), the causal agent of bacterial canker. This disease has become the most significant limiting factor in kiwifruit production. Psa colonizes different organs of the host plant, causing a specific symptomatology on each of them. In addition, the systemic invasion of the plant may quickly lead to plant death. Despite the massive risk that this disease poses to the kiwifruit industry, studies focusing on Psa ecology have been sporadic, and a comprehensive description of the disease epidemiology is still missing. Optimal environmental conditions for infection, dispersal and survival in the environment, or the mechanisms of penetration and colonization of host tissues have not been fully elucidated yet. The present work aims to provide a synthesis of the current knowledge, and a deeper understanding of the epidemiology of kiwifruit bacterial canker based on new experimental data. The pathogen may survive in the environment or overwinter in dormant tissues and be dispersed by wind or rain. Psa was observed in association with several plant structures (stomata, trichomes, lenticels) and wounds, which could represent entry points for apoplast infection. Environmental conditions also affect the bacterial colonization, with lower optimum values of temperature and humidity for epiphytic than for endophytic growth, and disease incidence requiring a combination of mild temperature and leaf wetness. By providing information on Psa ecology, these data sets may contribute to plan efficient control strategies for kiwifruit bacterial canker.",

Chev.)] production, which is mostly concentrated in China, Italy and New Zealand, generates a significant agricultural value of over three billion euros annually, with a retail market value worth over ten billion euros (FAO data, 2017) . The emergence and spread in all the key production areas of Pseudomonas syringae pv. actinidae (Psa), responsible for bacterial canker of kiwifruit, has compromised the viability of this production on a global scale [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] . The pathogen is highly virulent, spreading quickly between plants of different cultivars and vines of different ages [5] [6] [7] [8] . For example, in Italy, between 2010 and 2012, more than 2000 ha of kiwifruit orchards have been either destroyed by the disease or cut down, causing severe economic losses for growers, satellite industries, and other stakeholders of the kiwifruit production chain [9] .",

The information available on well-studied, related P. syringae pathovars, such as P. syringae pv. syringae, may provide general indication on conspecific bacteria. However, because of the strict host specificity, molecular and biochemical peculiarities must exist in Psa, and many aspects of this pathovar biology and disease epidemiology still require in-depth investigation. Primary entry points and mechanisms of spread of Psa represent important aspects still to elucidate. This information is the key to assist in the development of effective means of disease control which should be tailored on the key steps of the disease cycle.",

Some short communications have listed plant tissues where the bacteria have been detected [10] [11] [12] : lenticels, lesion margins, buds, woody tissue, suckers and fruit pedicels. However, such studies provided no evidence for direct tissue contamination, since Psa can migrate through the apoplast leading to a systemic plant infection. Further studies identified natural openings and lesions as important entry sites for Psa, as well as the importance of lenticels and fresh cut in the infection process, as observed through a scanning electron microscope [13, 14] . Furthermore, it was observed, through bacterial injections into leaf veins as described by Serizawa and Ichikawa [15] , that bacteria can migrate from young leaves to twigs facilitating a systemic infection throughout the vine [8, 12, 13, [16] [17] [18] . The bacterium was retrieved in xylem vessels and phloem tissues, indicating that the systemic spread can rapidly reach potentially any tissue of the infected plant [14] .",

The main cultivated varieties are A. chinensis var. chinensis and A. chinensis var. deliciosa, the former being characterized by yellow-or red-fleshed fruit, while the latter includes primarily green-fleshed cultivars [21] . However, between A. chinensis var. chinensis and A. chinensis var. deliciosa, there are differences not only in vegetative morphology, flower and fruit morphology, and chromosome number [20, [22] [23] [24] but also in different susceptibility to Psa. In fact, it has been observed that yellow-and red-fleshed kiwifruit (A. chinensis var. chinensis) are generally more susceptible than green-fleshed (A. chinensis var. deliciosa) cultivars such as 'Hayward' displaying a more pronounced symptomatology, enhanced spread, and faster dieback [25] .",

For this purpose, symptomatic plants were uprooted and the soil adhering to roots was analysed. Experiments were also performed in controlled conditions with the same soil samples sterilized and successively inoculated with Psa (10 9 CFU g \u22121 ). To evaluate Psa survival in water sources, 1-L samples were collected from different water sources (i.e. artificial basins inside the orchard, overflow water collector channels, rivers). Water was filtered by using a sterile nitrocellulose filter (pore 0.22 \u03bcm, \u00d8 47 mm).

On the other hand, Actinidia leaves are typically covered with a dense layer of trichomes ( Fig. 2 ) which may play an important role in the infection process [10] , by creating a favourable and humid micro-environment and protecting the pathogen from adverse condition such as UV light, desiccation, pesticide sprays etc. In addition, epiphytic bacteria like Psa can live in large aggregates or microcolonies which can form or be part of a biofilm on the leaf surface, presumably to better resist environmental stresses, like other Pseudomonas species [36] . Indeed, on leaf surface, Psa microcolonies were primarily localized at the base of uniseriate and stellate trichomes ( Fig. 3 b,c). Different Actinidia species present different types and densities of trichomes [37] . On the abaxial leaf surface, multicellular stellate hairs, either petiolate or not, are the most common type of trichome in both A. chinensis var. chinensis and A. chinensis var. deliciosa leaves. Similarly, in other plant species, Pseudomonas syringae pv. syringae bacterial cells, rather than being randomly distributed over the leaf surface, form aggregates associated with leaf structures, such as veins and particularly glandular trichomes [38, 39] . It has been observed that glandular trichomes offer optimal conditions for microbial growth due to their ability to retain water [40] and secrete a diversity of chemical compounds, including sugars, proteins, oils and secondary compounds [41, 42] .

On female flowers, Psa initially colonize the stigma, which provides a nutrient-rich and humid environment allowing a fast growth of the pathogen. From the stigma, Psa migrates along the style till the nectar cup (Fig. 1.2 a) . Systemic penetration into the flower can occur either from the stigma or via the nectarthodes [50] . Psa is often vectored to stigma by contaminated pollen (Fig. 1.2 b) . Experimental inoculation of flowers with Psa (10 6 CFU mL \u22121 ) resulted in (75 \u00b1 5)% of systemic invasion of A. chinensis var. chinensis and (53 \u00b1 6)% of A. chinensis var. deliciosa female flowers. Incidence of systemic invasion of male flowers was, in both species, approximately 60%. Infection threshold on the flowers of the different species has not been yet estimated. However, in the first 6 h after inoculation with low Psa dosage (10 4 CFU mL \u22121 ), Psa population ranged between (3.0 \u00b1 1.6) \u00d7 10 5 CFU and (2.4 \u00b1 1.4) \u00d7 10 6 CFU per flower in A. chinensis var. deliciosa and A. chinensis var. chinensis, respectively.

            "text": "A critical phase of the life cycle of Psa is its ability to endophytically migrate from the leaves to shoots and canes via apoplast [5, 10, 13] . This systemic invasion of the plant may determine the rapid death of plants [10] . Indeed, once inside the host's tissues, Psa can migrate systemically to different organs. Migration occurs preferentially through xylematic vessels (Fig. 1.4) , where Psa is often found attached to the vessels wall. Moreover, plugging of xylem vessel was often observed [13] . Sporadic presence of Psa was also found in sieve elements and schlerenchymatic fibres in the shoot cortex. Psa can migrate both acropetally and basipetally, moreover, Psa can go beyond branching node moving equally in the different directions (Fig. 4e) . The migration rate was evaluated in A. chinensis var. deliciosa and A. chinensis var. chinensis after stab-inoculation of a single shoot of 1-year old potted plants. Previous studies demonstrated that the migration rate negatively correlated with plant resistance [56] . In , open (BBCH 07) and with emerging leaves (BBCH 09) measured in the first 2 weeks. Experiments were performed in screenhouse without controlled environmental conditions. Closed (BBCH 00) or swollen (BBCH 03) [30] buds were inoculated by applying for 24 h a cotton plug soaked in bacterial suspension. Epiphytic and endophytic population were assessed 10 days after inoculation. Experiments was performed on five replicates of 6 bud each. b Incidence of Psa endophytic population in kiwifruit tissues after inoculation of lenticels. The experiment was performed on five replicates of four lenticels each. c Endophytic Psa population after inoculation of leaf abscission scars. Both natural abscission scars (autumn) and mechanically induced ones (late summer) were inoculated. Experiment was performed on six replicates of six scars each. d Psa endophytic population in 3-cm-long wood samples after inoculation of pruning cuts with a Psa suspension (CFBP7286 at 10 7 CFU mL \u22121 ). To verify the time needed for a complete healing of the pruning cuts, inoculation was performed up to 32 days after the cutting and the re-isolation occurred after 10 days. Experiments was performed on five replicates of three pruned canes per each timepoint. e Scheme of the sampling of A. chinensis var. deliciosa potted plant infected with Pseudomonas syringae pv. actinidiae, in order to evaluate the rate of migration of bacteria in the plant. Psa population was determined in different parts of the plant 3 weeks or 4 months after inoculation in a single point. Average endophytic population in the different branching node or section is also reported. Each plant section was 10 cm long. In all panels, average \u00b1 standard error is reported our experiments, migration rate correlated only weakly with the host susceptibility. Indeed, 3 weeks after inoculation acropetal and basipetal migration were 2 and 3 cm, respectively both in A. chinensis var. chinensis and A. chinensis var. deliciosa. However, endophytic Psa population at the same distance from the inoculation points were generally higher in A. chinensis var. chinensis in comparison with A. chinensis var. deliciosa. In 4 months, the furthest migration upward reached 14.5 cm (till the apical bud), whereas downward, it reached 138 cm (Fig. 4e) . Furthermore, Psa completely colonized the roots reaching the most distant (142.5 cm) ones from infection point, passing beyond the grafting union.",

Xylematic flow may easily be invoked to explain the translocation toward transpiring leaves, since Psa is found within xylem vessels (Fig. 1.4) [13, 14] . However, the plant is able to restrict bacterial migration through the xylem to some degree, by producing tyloses [13] . A local increase of hydrostatic pressure, caused by the release of exopolysaccharides and other water-attracting solutes [57] [58] [59] [60] , is commonly considered responsible for the outbreak of bacterial exudates from the bark, but might as well contribute to bacterial migration in the apoplast as mass flow. Indeed, for several bacterial pathogens the systemic migration within the host plant is dependent on exopolysaccharides production [58, 60] . Finally, active bacterial chemotaxis may, at least partially, facilitate the diffusion of Psa within the host tissues. The rate of endophytic colonization has been shown to be dependent on the relative humidity [61] . Thus, conditions with high RH favour both the infection process and the migration inside the host plant.",

Experiments conducted in three consecutive years (2013) (2014) (2015) in three locations suggest that leaf wetness and temperature are the two main drivers of primary symptom occurrence and development (Fig. 9 ). Symptom development concentrates in the spring (April-May), between 7 and 70 days after bud break, as no further increase in leaf spots is observed from late June on. In this period, the average daily temperature was about 18.4 \u00b1 3.7\u00b0C and symptoms occurred at the same time of periods of leaf wetness. Generally, symptoms were observed when leaf wetness in the previous 3 days was lasting more than 4.5 h per day. At the increase of temperature around 22.3 \u00b1 2.2\u00b0C, symptom occurrence ceased also in presence of leaf wetness periods. Finally, the correlation between temperature and relative humidity breaks down during temperature falls below a daily average of approximately 15\u00b0C. During summer, the progress of disease incidence and severity is arrested, most probably as a consequence of temperature, rather than of leaf ontogenetic resistance. In fact, even though older leaves tend to be less susceptible (Fig. 10a, b) the disease progression in field conditions stopped also in 1-and 2-week old leaves at the beginning of June, corresponding to an increase of average temperature above 22\u00b0C (Fig. 10c) . Moreover, in experiments carried out with 3-week-old sentinel plants, placed every week in infected orchards, incidence and population of Psa were correlated, and were promoted by extended leaf wetness. However, similarly to field conditions, symptoms only formed in spring and early summer (supplementary Fig. S4 ). Symptoms (exudates, water-soaked leaf spots) may as well appear in autumn after frost events [66] .",

On the other hand, the chance of infection can be reduced by optimizing agricultural practices and controlling the main risk factors. While the role of clothes and vehicles is negligible [67] , soil particles and agricultural tools can easily spread Psa within and among orchards.

Insects, including pests (Metcalfa pruinosa) and pollinators, may disperse the bacterium within the orchard [69] [70] [71] . However, as Psa does not survive long either in M. pruinosa guts or in beehives, longrange or long-term vectoring by insects seems unlikely. chinensis male and female varieties were averaged. Concerning A. chinensis var. deliciosa, female vines belonged to the cv. 'Hayward', while for male vines data collected from cv. 'Tomuri' and 'Matua' were averaged. Lower case letters indicate statistical differences inside the same variety, whereas, capital letter indicates statistical differences between plant of the same sex belonging to different varieties according to Marascuilo procedure (\u03c7 2 = 0.05) Wind and rain splash are considered main drivers of Psa spread in the orchard [15, 68] . The present study also allowed to verify that the pathogen can be intercepted by the Petri dishes mainly during prolonged rain events and especially in spring and autumn. Accordingly, the observation of a reduced disease occurrence under plastic covers [72; Donati et al., unpublished results] was explained with a lower exposure of plants to wind and moisture. Also frost events were associated with Psa outbreaks [66] , as freeze-thaw cycles promote bacterial growth and production of exudates, which form the primary inoculum for subsequent spread. Frost events during vegetative activity are particularly risky, for the presence of natural entry points (stomata, wounded tissues) that may enable Psa infection. Metagenomic and classical microbiological approaches showed that Psa is generally associated with P. syringae pv. syringae in A. chinensis var. deliciosa and A. chinensis var. chinensis flowers and leaves [73] . Pseudomonas syringae pv. syringae is known to promote ice nucleation [74] and to infect the host through the resulting frost injuries. Therefore, Psa, although not expressing ice nucleation activity, may take advantage from the association with P. syringae pv. syringae. The synergistic copresence of two pathovars has been previously observed [73] , suggesting that, in nature, they may be active as a pathogenic consortium rather than independent pathogens.",

Psa population (10 5 CFU g \u22121 FW) was found on dormant buds. Up to 40% and 17% of dormant buds harboured Psa in A. chinensis var. chinensis and A. chinensis var. deliciosa, respectively. In symptomless canes, Psa was isolated only in proximity of buds. Psa was also found in all the trunk samples collected in proximity of visible cankers (up to 15 cm from the symptoms). Among the plants showing secondary symptoms during the previous season, a considerable fraction (80% of A. chinensis var. chinensis and 40% of A. chinensis var. deliciosa samples) harboured a high Psa population (1.2 \u00d7 10 8 CFU g \u22121 FW) inside the root system. Psa overwintering population was generally higher in A. chinensis var. chinensis than A. chinensis var. deliciosa possibly reflecting the higher susceptibility of the first species. In both species, Psa incidence in buds increased with the breaking of dormancy, suggesting a reactivation of the pathogen in concurrence with an increase of the host metabolic activity. The high root pressure occurring at the end of dormancy, by bringing water from the root apparatus to the opening buds, sustains and increases their metabolism [77] . Psa may exploit the xylematic water transport to migrate from the roots and trunk, where there is the highest overwintering incidence, to buds causing the failure of bud break and the wilting of young sprouts that are common symptoms in early spring.",

During late winter, in concurrence with the late stage of plant dormancy, xylem functionality reactivates leading to the development of root pressure, defined as positive xylem pressure that arises in the roots. Root pressure rise contributes to the swelling of dormant buds which preludes to bud break. Root pressure also results in copious bleeding (exudation) from the xylem if pruning cuts are made during this time [77] . The high root pressure at bud break may also contribute to the reactivation of cankers and to the formation of new ones. In these conditions, in xylematic vessels plugged by a rapid Psa growth and the hydration and swelling of the bacterial exopolysaccharides, the water pressure caused by the end of dormancy may lead to cracking and exudation of the trunk, leaders and canes. Exuding cankers provide the primary source of inoculum [78] . In late winter or early spring, environmental conditions are very favourable for disease development and primary infection can be facilitated by physical damage caused by frost, high winds and rain [49, 79] . In spring, Psa cells spread from the exuding cankers to leaves and young shoots. On leaves, under favourable conditions, the pathogen multiplies epiphytically, rapidly reaching the infection threshold. Infection occurs primarily via stomata (Fig. 3) [10, 48, 80] . For the onset of the infection, leaf wetness is necessary. Indeed, the water film connecting the plant surface with the stomatic chamber and spongy mesophyll is necessary both for bacterial multiplication and for the migration inside the host tissues [45, 81] . Psa strains belonging to biovar 2 produce coronatine [47] , which, among other effects, contrasts stomata closure [82] . However, coronatine does not appear to be strictly required for virulence, since the genes for its biosynthesis are not present in any strain of the biovar 3, even though they are highly virulent [33] . Such strains, in turn, may produce ethylene [5] that can also suppress ABAmediated stomata closure [83, 84] . In addition, ethylene may support pathogen growth and colonization within the plant tissues, due to its antagonistic role against SA-mediated defences [65] . In favourable, high humidity conditions, leaf spots can also produce bacterial exudates (Fig. 3a) , starting a spring leaf cycle by providing the inoculum for a secondary spread of the disease to healthy shoot and leaves throughout spring.",

In infected flower buds, Psa can internally colonize the anthers, leading to the production of infected pollen [50] . Pollen-mediated dispersal contributes to a rapid spread inside the orchard. The flower cycle provides the main source of inoculum during spring, when the environmental conditions are highly favourable for the pathogen growth in plant (Fig. 11) . During the flower cycle, the spread from plant to plant is facilitated by pollinators [50] . Both leaf and flower infection Fig. 11 Disease cycle of the bacterial canker of Actinidia.

Psa was able to infect the plant via stomata, damaged trichomes, flowers, lenticels, buds at different developmental stage (BBCH 00-09), leaf abscission scars and pruning cuts, whilst Psa was unable to infect plants via roots. Therefore, all these entry points need to be protected in order to minimize the risk of Psa infection. After invading the host tissues, the pathogen can colonize the periderm, the sclereids, the pith and the xylem. However, the migration inside the host tissue occurs probably mainly through xylem vessels. Migration can be both basipetal and acropetal and Psa can move across branching nodes.",
