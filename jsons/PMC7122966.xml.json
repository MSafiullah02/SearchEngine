Conventional diagnostic technologies such as polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) have been established as global gold standards. However, they have mainly been used in developed countries and major cities in developing countries due to their sophisticated instrumentation and complex operation procedures that require specially trained staffs [1, 2]. Therefore, there is still a great need for innovative portable POC devices that can provide effective high-value healthcare to underdeveloped and resource-constrained regions. Herein, we argue how plasmofluidics, a synergistic integration of plasmonics and micro-/nanofluidics , can help address current challenges in portable POC devices as well as fundamental biomedical studies. This book chapter focuses on two correlated areas: plasmofluidic tweezers and biosensors. The first part of this book chapter reviews state-of-the-art plasmofluidic tweezers for versatile manipulations of biological cells, DNAs, and proteins, including the latest strategies for overcoming the inherent drawbacks of plasmonic tweezers. The second part discusses various plasmofluidic biosensors for the detection of nucleic acids, proteins, pathogens, and drug molecules. We highlight the progress made at improving the limit of detection (LOD ), response time, and accuracy for analyzing clinical samples.",

For instance, recent years have witnessed large outbreaks of Ebola in Africa and Zika in Central and South America, and there have been serious concerns and heated debates on public health at the global scope. Cancers, which are characterized by the uncontrolled growth and spread of abnormal cells and induced by various factors such as tobacco, infectious organisms, genetic mutations, and immune conditions, are the leading cause of death for much of the US population [3]. The threats from infectious diseases and cancers become increasingly prevalent due to factors such as changing trends in human and animal migration, increasing urbanization, environmental deterioration, and climate change. Early disease diagnosis and effective treatment have become critical for the clinical regulation and management of infectious diseases and cancers. Convectional disease diagnostics has relied on techniques such as optical microscopy, culture, immunoassays, and nucleic acid amplification [4]. A standard process for disease diagnostics includes the following steps: (a) collection and transport of biological samples such as blood, urine, and tissue swabs from the point of care; (b) analysis of the samples by experienced staffs in a centralized laboratory; and (c) notification of the results to the clinicians and patients. Due to highly frequent access to energy resources like electricity, time-consuming procedures, and need for well-trained personnel, the conventional clinical methods prelude the rapid disease detection and response at the primary care. Their drawbacks are prominently revealed in resource-limited and underdeveloped areas.",

These include areas where healthcare infrastructure is limited and high-quality timely medical care is inaccessible [5, 6]. With the advancements of nanotechnologies and micro-/nanofluidic technologies, many innovative POC biosensors with optical, electrical, and mechanical interrogations have been developed. However, two major challenges, matrix effect and system integration, have prevented the further developments and uses of POC devices [4]. Most biosensors can have excellent performance with pristine samples. However, they still need to be strictly evaluated with clinical samples due to the matrix effect. Generally, the matrix of human fluids becomes more complex in infected states, which could lead to the clogging of microfluidic channels and the decrease of the transduction signals. Transformation of POC devices from proof-of-concept and benchtop to bedside care and point-of-care settings requires the system integration. However, to integrate and package various modules for sample preparation and signal detection into a fully automated and user-friendly platform remains challenging.",

SIBA -based plasmonic tweezers were developed to reduce the required power intensity by more than an order of magnitude [25]. As illustrated in Fig. 5.1e, a nanoaperture redshifts in its resonance wavelength when the trapped particle has a larger refractive index than solvent, enhancing the laser beam transmission through the nanoaperture. When the particle tends to escape from the aperture, a drop in the light transmission generates a restoring force and pulls the particle back to the equilibrium position. In other words, when the particle is moving away from the optical potential well, the SIBA force will deepen the potential well and maintain the trapping state, as illustrated in Fig. 5.1f\u2013h.",

The competing factors between light absorption and heat dissipation determine the temperature increase and spatial temperature distribution. For a spherical gold nanoparticle immersed in water and illuminated by a laser of LSPR wavelength, the temperature increase is uniform in the particle and inversely proportional to the distance outside the particle, resulting in a thermal gradient built up at the metal-water interface [26]. For metal nanoparticle arrays as illustrated in Fig. 5.2a, two heating regimes exist depending on the particle size, particle number, and geometry of the array. These are temperature confinement regime and temperature delocalization regime, as shown in Fig. 5.2b [27]. To reach the temperature confinement regime, both large spacing between nanoparticles and small illumination area are preferred.",

As shown in Fig. 5.2c\u2013d, the thermal convection velocity at small plasmonic structures is limited to 1\u2013100 nm/s. In this case, the thermal convection can barely contribute to the motion of the particles in the fluidic environment.

The specimen-binding events change the dielectric constant over the metal layer. Several approaches have been applied to excite SPP s, including prism coupling [30, 31], grating coupling [32], and waveguide coupling [33]. LSPR -based sensors utilize the strong electromagnetic response of metal nanoparticles to refractive-index changes in their surroundings [1, 12, 34, 35]. Various nanostructured metal arrays such as nanohole arrays [36, 37], nanowell arrays [38], nanocross arrays [39], nanocube arrays [40], nanomouth arrays [41], nanomushroom arrays [42], nanodisk arrays [15, 43], and nanobowtie arrays [44] have been designed for the refractive-index sensing with high figure of merit (FOM ). Various techniques such as focused ion beam lithography, electron beam lithography, soft lithography, and nanosphere lithography have been employed to fabricate the large-scale arrays with good repeatability [34, 45\u201347].",

Metal colloids, colloid aggregations in solutions, and metal nanoparticle arrays on substrates are commonly used for SERS -active sensors integrated with microfluidics [55, 56]. There are two major microfluidic approaches toward SERS -active plasmofluidic sensors: (i) mixing the sample with SERS -active colloids in a microfluidic channel (Fig. 5.3c) and (ii) driving the sample through a microfluidic channel with a SERS -active substrate at the bottom (Fig. 5.3d) [52]. Such plasmofluidic sensors have the advantages of measuring biological particles and molecules in their native watery environments. However, since the molecular adsorption or binding to the SERS -active surfaces relies on the diffusion of the analytes in solutions, the Raman signal intensities will be weaker than those of SERS based on dried samples on solid-state Raman substrates.",

Once a temperature gradient is created on a plasmonic substrate that is illuminated with a low-power laser beam, the positive-charged nanoparticles will migrate to the hot region under a thermally induced local electrical field (Fig. 5.4b) and form nanoparticle assemblies at the laser spot (Fig. 5.4c).

Conventional technologies for nucleic acid sensing feature high precision and optimal LOD . However, they require sophisticated instrumentation with multiple time-consuming steps, including pathogen isolation, PCR, and target identification. Plasmofluidic sensors are extensively explored to achieve precise, multiplexed, and label-free detection [31, 69\u201372]. Springer et al. demonstrated a SPP sensor with a four-channel flow cell (known as dispersionless microfluidics), as shown in Fig. 5.7a\u2013b. The microfluidics suppressed the decrease of analyte concentration at the sensing area when different liquid samples were switched and thus improved the kinetic response and sensitivity [73]. Short sequences of DNA (20 bases) that are characteristic for E. coli cells were probed in less than 4 min for a concentration down to fM levels, outperforming most SPP sensors by one order of magnitude.",

Raman signal was significantly enhanced by placing the DNA molecules in the interstices of the gold-particle-on-wire structure. The structure was constructed by sequential incubation of Au NWs premodified by thiolated probe DNAs in solutions of target DNAs and Au NPs functionalized by reporter DNAs with Raman dyes (Fig. 5.7c). A high selectivity is assured because only those target DNAs with sequences complementary to the probe DNAs and the reporter DNAs can form the particle-on-wire structure for the enhanced signal of the Raman dyes. The sensor was applied for quantitative detection of DNA concentrations, multiplexed detection of bacterial DNAs, and identification of pathogenic bacteria in real clinical samples. The results on bacteria agreed well with those obtained by conventional culture-based assays, as illustrated in Fig. 5.7d.",

The cancer is hard to be detected when the tumor is small and at nonmetastatic stage [82, 83]. The sensor is based on gold nanoprisms functionalized with \u2013S-C6-ssDNAs . Direct hybridization between the \u2013S-C6-ssDNAs and the target miRNAs forms DNA duplex (Fig. 5.7e), which increases the refractive index in local environment of the nanoprism and redshifts the LSPR peak wavelength. The high sensitivity down to 10\u221218 M for specific miRNA-10b benefits from multiple factors: (a) atomically flat surface of the nanoprisms allowing efficient duplex formation, (b) high charge density of the duplex greatly altering the local refractive index, and (c) strong field enhancement at the tips of nanoprisms. Detection of miRNA-10b at a low concentration was achieved in pancreatic cancer cell lines, derived tissue culture media, human plasma, and plasma exosomes. Quantification of miRNA-10b in highly purified exosomes that were isolated from patients with PDAC and chronic pancreatitis (CP) was shown in Fig. 5.7f. PDAC patients had much higher miRNA-10b levels than CP patients. Integration of the sensor into microfluidics is expected to further enhance the miRNA measurements and the disease diagnosis with identifiable miRNA signatures.",

A plasmonic sensor with dispersionless microfluidics was developed to detect protein biomarker of MDS disease (i.e., sVEGFR-1) via interaction with its high-affinity bio-receptor VEGF-A [95]. A detection limit of 25 ng/mL was achieved in 2% human blood plasma by using the sequential injection approach. However, the traditional experimental design that relies on a specific bio-receptor (known as \u201clock-and-key\u201d approach) is limited by interference from molecules that are structurally or chemically alike. Moreover, most diseases are associated with multiple biomarkers, which necessitate the detection of a total protein distribution rather than a particular protein. To address these challenges, Choi et al. developed a \u201ccross-reactive\u201d-based sensor using a substrate of multiple segments of surfaces that are pre-adsorbed by different types of proteins. A distinctive pattern of SPP angle shifts arose from the interaction of the substrate with a sample of variable proteins [84]. The SPP angle pattern was used to clarify the concentration distributions of proteins and a specific biomarker, C-reactive protein (CRP), in a cocktail sample.",

However, protein microarrays often involve time-consuming fabrication process. Dehydrated or denatured proteins suffer a shorter lifetime of normal functionality. To overcome these problems, a multiplexed enzymatic synthesis via surface-coupled transcription-translation was employed for in vitro fabrication of protein microarrays and for their immediate use in biosensing based on a microfluidic platform, as illustrated in Fig. 5.8a\u2013c. The plasmofluidic system includes generator, control, and detector components. Multiple RNA transcripts were created at the generator through surface reaction of RNA polymerase with adsorbed dsDNA and translated into proteins by cell-free protein synthesis. The synthesized proteins diffused to the detector element and formed protein microarrays. As a demonstration, binding of anti-GFP and antiluciferase to the protein arrays was characterized with SPRI and time-resolved absorption kinetic measurement, as shown in Fig. 5.8d\u2013g. With multiple surface chemistries, the plasmofluidic system can be further implemented for multiplexed SPRI biosensing in clinical practices.",

Uludag et al. used a matrix elimination buffer to eliminate nonspecific binding of 98% serum proteins and performed a sandwich assay, in which the target proteins were sandwiched between a bottom layer of capture antibody and a top layer of antibody-modified Au NPs [86]. The Au NPs reduced the refractive-index mismatch between the buffer and the sample, leading to amplified SPP signal and enhanced sensitivity. A LOD of 0.29 ng mL\u22121 for tPSA in 75% human serum was attained, which was comparable to that achieved by a quartz crystal microbalance (QCM) sensor. SPP and QCM sensors were further combined to detect sub-attomolar human \u03b1-thrombin [96]. The sandwich immunoassays with SPP -based sensors are expected to improve early-stage cancer diagnosis and prognosis.",

It also enabled multianalyte detection of ten cycles for each sample in 40 min, which is more than ten times shorter than traditional sandwich immunoassays.

The same group further integrated sandwich immunoassay [110] with gradient microfluidics to achieve programmable and automatic analysis of biomarkers with small sample volume, easy sample preparation, and short assay time [89]. After the AFP antigens were captured by the immobilized antibodies on gold microwells, polyclonal anti-AFP antibody-conjugated particles were attached to form the sandwich immunocomplexes, as shown in Fig. 5.10a. A similar methodology was applied to detect hepatitis B virus antigen in human blood and blood plasma. Hepatitis B virus infection is a common cause of chronic liver disease worldwide [112].

The identification was accomplished by measuring the relative signal from the cancer-specific SBT versus the cell-identifying universal control SBT. The discrimination efficiency can reach 1 cancer cell from a population of 100 normal cells due to spectroscopic richness of the Raman bands of the reporter molecules on the two SBTs and algorithmic effectiveness of the two deconvolution strategies for the composite spectrum. The SBT approach provides a continuous, low-cost, and nondestructive tumor cell identification and paves the way toward clinical cancer diagnosis at the single-cell level.",

Viruses have been responsible for a number of epidemic outbreaks (e.g., H1N1 flu and SARS) in recent years. Timely virus detection becomes essential for recognizing and controlling future epidemics. Conventional techniques such as cell culture methods, PCR, and ELISA can detect and quantify pathogens with high sensitivity and specificity [118, 119]. However, they require lab-intensive procedures, expensive equipment, and well-trained operators. Alternative biosensing techniques that can achieve reliable, accurate, and sensitive detection and analysis of pathogens under the variable settings, including source-limited settings and primary care settings, are in great need. Among the various detection platforms that use different mechanisms such as electrical, mechanical, and optical signal transduction [2, 5, 120], plasmofluidic biosensors are promising for label-free detection of infectious agents.",

Detection of drug residues in food and human liquids is frequently needed for food safety and healthcare. The capability of monitoring antibody-polypeptide reaction is desirable for multiplexed drug discovery. Chen et al. proposed a SPRI-based visualization method for monitoring antibody-polypeptide binding in a label-free and high-throughput format [125]. The plasmonic platform can support the dynamic imaging of polypeptide microarray and the time tracing of 3D histograms for monitoring antibody-polypeptide reaction on the surface.",

At the interrogation region, SERS -active nanoparticle dimers and small-order aggregates with methamphetamine predominantly formed. Due to the low affinity of methamphetamine to the silver nanoparticles, the salt was added to induce the aggregation. Trace concentrations of methamphetamine in saliva were detected within minutes.

It is anticipated that future plasmonic tweezers will fully reap the benefits of micro-/nanofluidics to further enhance their functionalities for biosensing and diagnostic applications.
