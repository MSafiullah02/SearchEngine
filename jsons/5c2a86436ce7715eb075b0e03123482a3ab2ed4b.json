A macular erythematous eruption commences on the trunk and spreads centripetally (see Fig. 13 ). Contrary to SSSS, the palms, soles, and mucous membranes develop erythema. Non-pitting edema of the palms, soles, and occasionally throughout the body occurs. This condition can rapidly progress to severe and intractable hypotension with multisystem dysfunction. When fever is persistent, hypotension and shock may develop and lead to multiorgan failure, myositis, fasciitis, or disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). If the patient recovers, desquamation can occur 1-2 weeks after the onset of the illness in 20% of patients, affecting predominantly the palms and soles [ 61, 67, 68 ] .

This condition is caused by the species of the genus Clostridium , particularly C. perfringens , although other gram-positive rods have been described. The severity of the infection can be explained by the versatility of C. perfringens ' a (alpha) toxin, which causes tissue necrosis, leukocyte inactivation, red blood cell hemolysis, and direct depression of the cardio-respiratory system. Leukocyte inactivation prevents host response thus predisposes the patient to a fulminant course.

After an incubation period of 1-2 weeks, each syndrome has two phases: the acute septic phase (4-7 days) and the delayed immune phase (4-30 days) [ 99 ] . Anicteric leptospirosis, also called Pretibial fever or Fort Bragg fever, has a septic phase characterized by high fevers, headaches, myalgias of the lower back and calf muscles, anorexia, nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain. The immune phase is characterized by a more mild fever, more intense headaches, aseptic meningitis, conjunctival suffusion, uveitis, hepatosplenomegaly, and pulmonary involvement. During the immune phase, the characteristic cutaneous manifestation of non-pruritic erythematous patches or plaques on the pretibial areas can occur.

Since the clinical features and routine laboratory fi ndings of leptospirosis are not specifi c, the organism can be cultured to arrive at a diagnosis, although, the defi nite diagnosis is more frequently made by serologic testing [ 101 ] . This is due to the fact that cultures may be negative if drawn too early or too late. Serologic tests include: microscopic agglutination test (MAT), macroscopic agglutination test, indirect hemagglutination, and ELISA [ 102, 103 ] . Therapy may be initiated on the basis of clinical manifestations since cultures may take several weeks to grow, and only specialized laboratories perform the serological tests, which do not yield a positive result for roughly a week after the onset of the illness [ 103 ] .

Hansen's disease is classifi ed by a clinical severity spectrum with tuberculoid leprosy (TT) being the mildest form of the disease and lepromatous leprosy (LL), the most severe. The majority of the individuals exposed to M. leprae develop an effective immune response that is curative, while a small percentage of exposed individuals develop a chronic infection with any form within the clinical spectrum depending on immunological response. Strong cell-mediated immunity (CMI) (IFN-g and IL-2) results in mild forms of disease (TT), with possibly only a few well-defi ned nerves involved and lower bacterial loads. A strong humeral response (IL-4 and IL-10) and weak CMI, results in LL with widespread lesions, extensive skin and nerve involvement, and high bacterial loads. Borderline, or \"dimorphic,\" leprosy (BB) and the intermediary regions (BT and BL) between the two ends of the spectrum, refl ect the variation of host immune response [ 118 ] .",

There are two main classifi cations. The Ridley-Jopling classifi cation divides the spectrum into fi ve groups based on the immunologic response: tuberculoid (TT) at the mild end, borderline tuberculoid (BT), borderline-borderline (BB, in the middle), borderline lepromatous (BL), and lepromatous (LL) at the severe end. Meanwhile, the WHO classifi cation divides the gamut into three groups based on the number of cutaneous lesions: single-lesion leprosy (one skin lesion), paucibacillary leprosy (2-5 skin lesions), and multibacillary leprosy (>5 skin lesions). The Ridley-Jopling classifi cation is more commonly used with revisions adding an Indeterminate (I) category for patients in an early stage of the disease with insuffi cient clinical or histological features to fulfi ll a defi nitive category. In general, Hansen's disease primarily involves the skin and nervous system. In addition to cutaneous changes in pigmentation with possible anesthesia of the lesions, peripheral nerves can become enlarged and palpable [ 115 ] .
