A report of 22 February 1984 to the Director General of Health, under review, \"Proposal for Planning of Epidemiological Preparedness\" by a reference group set up by the Directorate of Health on 30 March 1982. The report states that after the \"nature and extent of the disaster,\" different measures may be needed for the isolation, treatment and care of patients with infectious diseases. \"In all these cases, one must assume that the best suited for these purposes are our many and good hotels.\" It is emphasized that in all parts of the country, preferentially, new hotels should be predesignated for this purpose. Most hotels have a high quality of the building and hygienic standard. They have single and double rooms, most of them with separate bathrooms and toilets, which is of the utmost importance as it facilitates isolation and care. They also have laundry facilities and kitchens, and most have wings that can be shut down. These are qualities that are approaching the requirements of an isolation department. The ventilation should be considered turned off. Ventilation can be done via windows if not large passage of people directly outside (WHO).",
