Schools and universities are providing courses online. By April 23, several businesses had lost their business license and over 600 people have been arrested for breaking the curfew.

Personal protection equipment like N95 masks and face shields are part of our daily outfit. Learning the correct use and cleaning of the equipment is essential to avoid cross contamination. As could be expected, we have adapted our own disinfecting processes before entering our homes to protect our families. Hospital visit hours have been eliminated to reduce social contact and external contamination. Because communication between physicians and care givers has been affected, obtaining family phone numbers and full names has become routine. Telemedicine is practiced on resident's outpatient clinics when available. Patients needing assistance call to clinic in advance to describe their signs and symptoms and medical recommendations are provided regarding the process for the visit. If patients need to be evaluated face-to-face, the visit is scheduled in advance to avoid lines on the waiting area and possible spread of the virus. Many follow up visits are performed by phone and prescriptions are directly sent to the pharmacy, which was not a common occurrence.Residency training has changed significantly as hospitals have decreased capacity.Published articles in academic journals with data from other locations and clinical guidelines regarding diagnosis and treatment strategies have been invaluable (4); equally valuable have been guidelines developed by hospital staff and administration. At our place, like in others, training program leadership continues to work on developing and updating screening and treatment protocols following the latest evidence-based guidelines. Consistent with social distancing recommendations, technology has become crucial for holding meetings and core presentations via videoconferencing and tests follow a digital platform. Overall, we have learned about a new disease, about how to address our patient's needs in the era of social distancing, and about how to behave accordingly at home and at work in a very short period of time (5). I am particularly proud of how Puerto Ricans have managed (and accepted) this new way of life pending new information. Meanwhile, we prepare for the challenges common to the island in coming months including the arboviral diseases. Aedes aegypti is the mosquito vector of arboviral disease, and it is present during the whole year in Puerto Rico. With the raining season getting closer, an outbreak of arboviral diseases, like",

This island of over 3.1 million inhabitants rests in the Caribbean Sea and is a territory of the United States. Since the pandemic began, healthcare providers have been working on the front lines, screening and treating patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 infection. I am an Internal Medicine Resident at the Mayaguez Medical Center located in the Southwest part of the island and I would like to offer my impressions of how the pandemic has affected our approach to patient care and education. The first cases of COVID-19 were reported in the island on March 13, 2020 and as of April 23, Puerto Rico confirmed 1,416 cases from 10,740 tested persons. At that time, the",
