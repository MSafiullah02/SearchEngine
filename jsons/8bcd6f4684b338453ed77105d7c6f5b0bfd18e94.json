[4] [5] [6] [7] Currently, there is no successful treatment for fibrosarcoma in the cat. 7 Although surgery is the treatment of choice, complete excision often is difficult. Wide surgical excision extends the tumor-free interval and increases survival time. 8, 9 Pre-or postoperative radiation therapy extends the median tumor-free time up to 422 days 10 and may reduce the recurrence rate to 42% in cats with clean surgical margins. 11 In the study by Cohen et al, 4 a recurrence rate of 41% after tumor excision, electron-beam radiation, and, in some cases, chemotherapy was documented. Chemotherapy regimens that have been investigated include doxorubicin 12,13 and carboplatin. 11 Martano et al 14 showed that the combination of surgery and doxorubicin does not increase the disease-free interval or reduce tumor recurrence or the rate of metastasis.",

This therapy is based on the use of biologically active proteins with the aim of altering the specific and nonspecific immune responses of the patient. The immune system is capable, under certain circumstances, of recognizing and eliminating tumor cells. 15 Interferons (IFN) are cytokines that have antiviral, antiproliferative, and immunomodulatory effects. The family of IFNs consists of 2 major classes, type I and type II. Type I IFNs include IFN-a, b, d, t, and v, whereas IFN-c is the only type II IFN. The biological activities of type I IFNs include growth inhibition of tumor cells, 16, 17 induction of apoptosis, 17, 18 natural killer cell activation, 19 and an increase in the expression of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I molecules. 20, 21 The amino acid sequence of recombinant feline IFN-v has approximately 60% homology to that of human IFN-v. 22 The antitumor efficacy of human IFN-v has been described in vitro 23, 24 and in vivo. 25 Recombinant feline IFN-v has approximately 60% homology to human IFN-a. 22, 26 Human IFN-a has been used in Germany since 1999 for the adjuvant therapy of malignant melanoma in humans. Because of the close relationship of IFN-v and IFN-a, adjuvant immunotherapy of feline fibrosarcoma by using rFeIFN-v follows the therapy protocol for human IFN-a. 27 Recombinant feline IFN-a is not commercially available, whereas rFeIFN-v is the only IFN licensed for use in cats.",

Two different fibrosarcomas might not have the same biological behavior and potentially may have different antigenic properties. The cats received recombinant feline IFN-v intratumorally or SC at the excision site, and for this reason only 1 tumor could be treated. Consequently, 1 cat with tumors at different sites was excluded from the study. Two cats had multiple tumors at 1 site. In both cats, 3 tumors were present at 1 site, for 1 cat, it was the first recurrence and, for the other cat, it was the second recurrence. This finding was thought to represent a recurrence of 1 fibrosarcoma as multiple small nodules at the surgical site.",

Seven cats that had tumor relapses (6) or metastases (1) had a minimum of 1 fibrosarcoma removed surgically before inclusion in the study. Of these 7 cats, 4 had 1 previous fibrosarcoma and 3 had 2 previous tumors. In contrast, only 3 cats with a primary tumor had tumor recurrence in this study. Of the 10 cats that were tumor free at the end of the study, 7 had a primary tumor and 3 had had 1 previous fibrosarcoma at the time of admission. Visual inspection of the Kaplan-Meier curve (Fig 1) indicated an influence of previous recurrences on recurrence-free time, but, presumably because of small sample sizes, this effect did not achieve statistical significance.",

An increase in expression of MHC class I molecules was observed in all tested fibrosarcoma cell lines after in vitro incubation with recombinant feline IFN-v. The expression of MHC class II molecules was affected by rFeIFN-v to a lesser extent. The incubation of feline tumor cell lines with rFeIFN-c resulted in increased cellular expression of MCH class I and II molecules. IFN-v is a type I IFN and is able to increase the expression of MHC class I molecules. 19, 20 In contrast, IFN-c is able to modulate the expression of MHC class I and II antigens. This effect has been described in different tumor cell lines in vitro. 21, 28, 29 An increase in the expression of MHC class I antigens, and, therefore, an increase in antigen presentation, render tumor cells susceptible to attack by the immune system. 32, 34 Recently, Murgia et al 33 reported down-modulation of MHC antigen expression in a canine transmissible venereal tumor as a tumor escape mechanism. Therefore, by increasing cellular expression of MHC I, recombinant feline IFN-v may promote tumor-cell destruction by the immune system. Immunotherapy with recombinant feline IFN-v in cats with fibrosarcoma is safe and well tolerated.",
