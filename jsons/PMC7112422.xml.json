However, enthusiasm was countered by concerns that targeted objectives could compromise efforts to develop strong primary health-care systems12 and by doubts about the technical feasibility of eradicating any organism after smallpox.13, 14 The most important factor in overcoming scientific concerns was the interruption of poliovirus transmission in large areas of the Americas by use of a four-pronged strategy.15 The leadership for launching a global poliomyelitis eradication initiative was secured at a meeting in March, 1988, at which the WHO Director-General was convinced of the merit of such an effort.12, 16 2 months later, the World Health Assembly, consisting of the ministers of health of all member states, unanimously adopted a poliomyelitis eradication resolution.17\n",

In the few high-income countries in which poliomyelitis cases were reported in 1988 (eg, France and Spain) elimination of the virus was relatively straightforward because of temperate climate, higher vaccine effectiveness in such settings, high levels of sanitation, and strong health systems. By contrast, eliminating endemic poliomyelitis from low-income countries has required massive efforts sustained for 5\u201310 years. Implementation of National Immunisation Days (NIDs) has been a huge challenge; in China and India, for example, about 80 million and 150 million children, respectively, were immunised in a few days\u2014the achievement was repeated 1 month later, and then annually for more than 5 years.22, 23 Because of the huge numbers of people and vehicles required to implement NIDs, governments of many countries have drawn heavily on the private sector, as well as on ministries of information, transport, and defence, among others, to help reach all children.24\n",

The worst-case scenario was assumed to be replacement of this vaccine by universal childhood immunisation with the more expensive inactivated poliovirus vaccine to reduce the risk of vaccine-associated paralytic poliomyelitis or poliomyelitis outbreaks due to a circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus.37, 38, 39 In this analysis, even in the worst-case scenario, poliomyelitis eradication would save money in all countries, apart from low-income countries where the cost per discounted disability-adjusted life-year (DALY) saved would still be low, at about $50 (table 2\n).",

Questions have been asked, however, as to whether short-term disruptions by NIDs in the delivery of routine immunisation and other services will have long-term consequences. Evaluation of the effect on health systems has been hampered by a lack of credible baseline data, the absence of control groups, and the concurrent implementation of major health-system reforms, such as decentralisation and sector-wide approaches.48, 49 Most commentators agree that there are positive synergies between poliomyelitis eradication and development of health systems, but opportunities have yet to be fully exploited.40, 50\n",

On June 21, 2002, an independent commission certified the WHO region of Europe as free from poliomyelitis, bringing the total number of regions certified to three (the Americas in 1994 and the Western Pacific in 2000), comprising more than 3 billion people in 134 countries and areas.

Northern India in particular poses challenges, since the combination of a weak health infrastructure, fragile political alliances and, to a lesser degree, suspicion of government services by minority communities, has hampered efforts to mobilise all sectors of society and reach every child. In parts of Afghanistan, eastern Angola, and the Mogadishu area of Somalia, continued improvement in access to children is needed to break the few remaining chains of virus transmission in these areas.

From the outset of the eradication initiative, much of the attraction of this international health goal has been the argument that its achievement would reap economic as well as humanitarian benefits. These economic benefits would accrue mainly if and when poliomyelitis immunisation could stop. That these economic benefits could accumulate in perpetuity underpinned the arguments of the champions of poliomyelitis eradication, engaged political leadership, and mobilised stakeholders, in particular those from the private sector. However, several factors have complicated the development of, and consensus on, future immunisation policy. These factors range from increasing evidence that vaccine-derived polioviruses can, albeit rarely, regain the capacity to circulate and cause outbreaks, to increasing concerns about the use of biological agents.36, 37, 38, 39 Although cessation of immunisation with the oral poliovirus vaccine remains a major objective of the eradication initiative, much work is required to establish the scientific soundness, operational feasibility, and economic rationale for the strategies that have been proposed to achieve this end.36\n",

Such endorsement will be essential for dealing with the debate and concerns that will arise as the programme is scaled up and opportunity and other costs are increasingly evident and better understood. Although prominent champions had a major role in promoting global eradication of poliomyelitis, the decision to launch the initiative followed debate at the World Health Assembly.12 Despite consensus at that forum, an often heated debate has flared as to whether the opportunity costs of eradication outweigh benefits. Of especial concern has been whether the deployment of resources has compromised the strengthening of health systems in resource-poor countries, or limited their capacity to control other diseases. It has also been noted that some delegates to the assembly in 1988 might not have made a truly informed decision on the launching of the initiative, since there had been no clear statement on resource requirements or strategies.58 These debates have contributed to the programme's chronic funding gap, and to the late introduction of key strategies in some countries. The cost-effectiveness analyses summarised in this paper suggest that all countries stand to benefit from this investment irrespective of income level, but this assessment is not universally accepted.",

Two major factors facilitated participation in the eradication initiative: a well defined, time-limited (1\u20135 days) demand on the community, and sufficient resources to enable the community to implement activities. Ensuring sufficient resources required moving beyond building an international health partnership to managing one efficiently. Critical to achieving efficiency was the use of common strategic plans, clear roles and responsibilities, and national and international forums to coordinate financing, human resources, and institutional arrangements.",

Because all countries will benefit economically from poliomyelitis eradication, Rotary International, as part of its advocacy strategy, calculated so-called fair shares of the total budget to be financed by each major donor country, based on their contributions to WHO's regular budget. However, only 16 of the 22 WHO member states that traditionally give overseas development assistance had contributed to the eradication initiative by mid-2002. Of these, seven contributed the equivalent or more than their estimated fair share and nine substantially less. The six countries that did not contribute are free riders in economic terms, since they will share in the benefits. While the fair-share concept is of great value for setting resource mobilisation targets and negotiating appropriate contributions with interested donors, it has substantial limitations. Most importantly, it will not mobilise funds from donors who did not fully endorse the goal in the first place. Pursuing the fair-share argument can also unveil basic, irreconcilable disagreements on their calculation. Such limitations must be recognised early and alternate strategies developed for settings where this argument alone is not sufficient.",

Although proponents have stated that poliomyelitis eradication strengthens other health services, they and their detractors have used anecdotal information to argue their cases because of a lack of objective criteria and indicators. Of note, some of the largest donors to poliomyelitis eradication are those who are institutionally committed to the strengthening of health systems, but who joined the initiative after reconciliation of concerns about the effect on the delivery of other services. However, proponents of future worldwide health goals should recognise the challenge of measuring such indirect benefits, be modest in arguing their worth, and ensure there are agreed indicators and the capacity and mechanisms for their monitoring.",

            "text": "The final lesson is the need to identify countries, regions, or populations where strategy implementation will be particularly challenging, and to establish appropriate contingency plans. Failure in just one country could be catastrophic for an eradication effort. However, other international health goals might be similarly compromised. For example, the emergence of multidrug-resistant strains of tuberculosis in one country could hamper worldwide efforts to combat that disease.59 Similarly, uncontrolled use of antibiotics in a few countries could seriously affect international work to contain antimicrobial resistance.60 As the poliomyelitis eradication programme began to be implemented on a truly worldwide scale in the mid-1990s, substantial attention was given to the ten countries that had been identified as at particularly high risk for delaying global eradication. As a result of focusing additional human, financial, and political resources in these areas, five of those countries (Bangladesh, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Sudan, Ethiopia, Angola) now seem to have eradicated poliomyelitis, and only three (India, Nigeria, Pakistan) continue to have high-intensity transmission. Although it is tempting to suggest that even greater attention earlier in the programme might have accelerated progress in these areas, the reality is that scant resources necessitated a more pragmatic approach. Other international health goals will require a similar, pragmatic approach to achieve and secure gains where possible, while developing the necessary political, financial, and human resources to address the most challenging areas.58\n",
