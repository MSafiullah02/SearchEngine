These findings, however, are based on in-person visits, which allow the patient to sit face-to-face with their provider, discuss sensitive medical issues, and engage in shared decision-making [8]. More research is necessary to establish which elements of communication and the patient-provider relationship are vital on a telemedicine platform. Furthermore, providers must learn to proficiently use new technology, while balancing quality communication, writing clinical documentation, ordering laboratory testing and building rapport.",

At the end of this ritual, physician and patient are no longer strangers but are bonded through touch [13].\u201d It is unclear whether the same trust and connection important for HIV care outcomes can be maintained under a telemedicine paradigm free of consistent human touch due to COVID-19. However, technological advancements in HIV care are reinventing how providers and patients define connection. This provides an opportunity to identify best practices, informed by the perspectives of PLWHA with complex histories and from historically marginalized groups, and provide training to providers at all levels.",

However, the rollout of telemedicine has not been without challenges. In one recent study, providers reported difficulties establishing rapport and an emotional connection with patients during telemedicine visits [14]. Another study showed patients felt rushed, less involved, and less comfortable asking sensitive questions due to privacy concerns [15]. Furthermore, care for PLWHA is typically performed by a team of doctors, nurses, mental health providers, social workers, and care coordinators. An approach to team-based care will need to be incorporated into the telemedicine model.",

We focused on overcoming gaps in knowledge, experience and comfort to ensure these patients had opportunities and confidence to use such tools. During COVID-19, our care coordinators have been proactively contacting patients to check on medication supply, food and housing security, and to help set up technology during the pandemic. And we have preserved options for in-person visits with appropriate safety measures especially for those with newly diagnosed HIV, new to the clinic, non-English-speaking, with limited access to technology, or low health or technology literacy.
