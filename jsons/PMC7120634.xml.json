He advocated use of sharp dissection and fine sutures, gentle handling of tissues, and complete wound closure.35 More than a century later, perioperative antimicrobial prophylaxis is an adjunctive measure to these mainstays of infection prevention. Although some of the details of prophylaxis for elective surgery are altered in previously hospitalized ICU patients, the principles remain. The purpose of prophylaxis is to prevent intrinsic and extrinsic bacterial contamination of the surgical site that occurs during an operation from developing into a postoperative infection. The ideal prophylactic agent would be active against the major potential infecting agents; not induce resistance; effectively penetrate relevant tissues; have a long enough half-life to maintain effective levels throughout the procedure (re-dosing as necessary); have low toxicity and potential for allergy; have few interactions with anesthetic agents and muscle relaxants; and be cost-effective.36\u201338 It should be administered within an hour before the procedure (within 2 h for vancomycin and fluoroquinolones).39 Postoperative doses provide no added benefit. In a review of 28 studies there was no clear advantage to either multiple- or single-dose prophylaxis (odds ratio 1.06, 95% CI, 0.89\u20131.25).40 Furthermore, unnecessary postoperative doses may cause harm, including allergy or anaphylaxis, prolonged bleeding times, C. difficile colitis, and selection of resistant organisms. This is particularly important in surgical ICU patients, who may require prolonged care and risk progressive acquisition of multidrug-resistant organisms.41 Similarly, \u201cprophylaxis\u201d of drains, tubes, and catheters is both ineffective and hazardous, as is an attempt to \u201cmaintain sterility of the wound.\u201d38,42,43\n",
