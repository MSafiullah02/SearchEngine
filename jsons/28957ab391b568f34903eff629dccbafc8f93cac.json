            "text": "Bronchiolitis is a syndrome of inflammation and obstruction of the lower respiratory tract that usually is caused by a viral infection occurring in the first 12 months of life. 1 Between 2% and 3% of infants younger than 1 year of age are hospitalized with bronchiolitis annually, accounting for 57,000 to 175,000 hospitalizations in the United States. [2] [3] [4] Yearly hospital admissions attributable to bronchiolitis increased more than twofold between 1980 and 1996, likely reflecting the increased use of childcare centers and changes in criteria for hospital admission for children with bronchiolitis. 5 However, during the first 16 years of the 21st century, bronchiolitis hospitalization rates have fallen by 20% to approximately 20 to 30 admissions per 1000 children younger than 12 months of age. 6 One explanation for lower rates of bronchiolitis hospitalization is the improved health of neonates at the time of discharge compared with several years earlier. This can be attributed to the use of antenatal glucocorticoids, surfactant replacement, improvements in methods for ventilatory support, corrective cardiac surgery performed earlier in life, and a better understanding of neonatal nutrition.",

            "text": "The peak incidence of severe disease occurs before 6 months of age, and the highest rates of hospitalization occur among infants between 60 and 90 days of age. 1 Most of those hospitalized for bronchiolitis are term infants with no known risk factors. Chronologic age is the single most important determinant for severe bronchiolitis; about two thirds of hospitalizations occur before 6 months of age. 1,2 Several reasons may account for this age distribution. Birth shortly before or soon after the onset of the RSV season results in a longer period of exposure to RSV earlier in life. Maternal antibody concentrations to RSV also show seasonal variation, and infants born early in the RSV season are more likely to be born to mothers with low neutralizing antibody concentrations. [12] [13] [14] Certain comorbidities, including prematurity (<29 weeks' gestation), chronic lung disease of prematurity, and hemodynamically significant congenital heart disease, may result in more severe disease compared with children without these comorbities. 15, 16 Worldwide, 65,000 to 200,000 deaths due to bronchiolitis were estimated to occur in 2005 20 20 Week no. Number of infections among children younger than 5 years of age. 17, 18 Fewer than 100 US pediatric deaths occur annually as a complication of RSV-associated bronchiolitis. 19 Occurrence of the respiratory virus season is predictable even though the severity of the season, the date of onset, the peak of activity, and the end of the season cannot be predicted with precision. 20 There can be variation in timing of community outbreaks of disease due to RSV from year to year in the same community and among neighboring communities, even in the same season. Southern US communities tend to experience the earliest onset of RSV activity, and those in the Midwest tend to experience the latest onset. The duration of the season in western and northeastern areas is typically between that in the South and the Midwest. Nevertheless, these variations occur within the overall pattern of RSV outbreaks, usually beginning in November or December, peaking in January or February, and ending by the end of March or April. [20] [21] [22] [23] Limited numbers of cases of bronchiolitis may occur during late spring, summer, and early fall, and they often are caused by viruses other than RSV, such as rhinoviruses or parainfluenza viruses. These cases often are milder than RSV-related cases. In tropical countries, the annual epidemic of RSV coincides with the rainy season, although cases can occur throughout the year.",

Intercostal, supracostal, and subcostal retractions are evident. Initially, wheezing occurs during the expiratory phase only and is audible only through a stethoscope. As wheezing progresses, it can be heard without a stethoscope. The chest becomes hyperexpanded and hyperresonant, respirations become more labored, and retractions become more severe. Mild hypoxemia occurs in most infants with bronchiolitis. Respiratory failure can occur due to progressive hypercapnia and respiratory muscle fatigue. 1 Disease severity may be recognized by the absence of audible air exchange on auscultation; flaring of the alae nasi; expiratory grunting; severe subcostal, supraclavicular, and intercostal retractions; and hypoxemia. A child with these findings may require intubation and ventilatory support. Apnea can be an early manifestation of RSV infection, sometimes resulting in respiratory failure. [30] [31] [32] Because the severity of bronchiolitis often waxes and wanes before consistent improvement, serial assessment of respiratory status should be performed. The ability of a young infant to breastfeed or bottle-feed without distress over time often provides a practical guide to disease severity and management.

Therapy is supportive, and most children with bronchiolitis do well regardless of management. 1 Therapies Bronchodilator Therapy. Most randomized, controlled trials have failed to demonstrate a consistent benefit from \u03b1or \u03b2-adrenergic agents. Although transient improvement in respiratory status has been reported, most infants treated with bronchodilators do not benefit from their use. [44] [45] [46] [47] The potential adverse effects (i.e., tachycardia and tremors) and cost of these agents outweigh the potential benefits. Recommendations from the American Academy of Pediatrics state, \"Clinicians should not administer albuterol to infants and children with a diagnosis of bronchiolitis.\" 1 Epinephrine. Epinephrine is an adrenergic agent with \u03b1and \u03b2-receptor agonist activity. It has been evaluated in children with bronchiolitis after systemic administration and when delivered directly into the respiratory tract. Large, multicenter trials comparing nebulized epinephrine with albuterol or placebo in hospitalized children with bronchiolitis found no improvement in outcomes. [48] [49] [50] Available evidence does not support a role for epinephrine use among hospitalized patients or outpatients with bronchiolitis.",

            "text": "Corticosteroid Therapy. Although corticosteroids may benefit selected patients with asthma or croup, no evidence supports the use of corticosteroid therapy in the general population of children with bronchiolitis. Numerous studies have documented a lack of benefit. [51] [52] [53] Oxygen Therapy. Various degrees of hypoxia are commonly seen in infants and young children with bronchiolitis. Intermittent periods of hypoxemia (\u226590% oxyhemoglobin saturation) as measured by pulse oximetry should not be interpreted as a need for supplemental oxygen. Transient desaturation is common in healthy infants. Oxygen saturation has much less impact on respiratory drive than carbon dioxide concentration in the blood. Oxygen saturation and respiratory distress have poor correlation among infants with lower respiratory tract infections. Continuous monitoring with pulse oximetry of children with mild degrees of oxygen desaturation has been associated with prolonged length of stay compared with children who do undergo continuous monitoring. 54, 55 Chest Physiotherapy. Suctioning of the nasopharynx to remove secretions and temporarily improve airflow is a common practice for children with bronchiolitis. Chest physiotherapy using vibration or percussion or deep suctioning is not recommended. 56, 57 Hydration. As many as one third of patients admitted to the hospital with a diagnosis of bronchiolitis require fluid replacement therapy. The ability to swallow may be compromised when the respiratory rate exceeds 60 breaths/min, especially if the child has nasal congestion. For infants who are unable to maintain hydration orally, fluid may be administered intravenously or through a nasogastric tube. 58, 59 Antibiotic Therapy. Antibacterial therapy should not be administered to an infant or young child with bronchiolitis unless there is a strong suspicion of a concomitant bacterial infection. 1 Nebulized Hypertonic Saline. Data suggest that nebulized hypertonic saline may have a modest benefit in infants with RSV bronchiolitis. [60] [61] [62] Hypertonic saline may facilitate mucociliary clearance of the bronchioles that results from the inflammatory response to infection. Some evidence suggests that 3% inhaled saline may be safe and may reduce length of hospital stay when a hospitalization lasts longer than 3 days. Antiviral Therapy. Ribavirin is a nucleoside analogue with in vitro activity against RSV, adenovirus, influenza A and B viruses, and parainfluenza viruses. Early trials indicated that ribavirin therapy was associated with a modest improvement in clinical scores, oxygenation, and duration of mechanical ventilation for infants with severe bronchiolitis due to RSV",
