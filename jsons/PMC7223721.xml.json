A focus in recent years has been to find vaccine formulations that can overcome the impaired immune responses in neonates and young infants.3 Most of this work, though, has focused on injected vaccines and much less interest has been shown in mucosal delivery, which could improve neonatal vaccination by harnessing the enhanced maturity of the local, microbiota-exposed immune system in the first few weeks of life.2,4 Speaking in favor of the latter approach is the fact that oral polio and rotavirus vaccines have both been successfully given, even to pre-term infants, with little apparent side-effects.5\u20137",

Presently, the only widely approved adjuvants for neonatal vaccination are aluminum salts, despite their inefficacy at improving APC-functions in neonates.4,14 Therefore, the search for new adjuvants to improve neonatal vaccines is ongoing, and while some have already been licensed, more knowledge about their mechanisms of action on neonatal immune responses is critically needed.15,16",

Previous studies, have shown that CTA1-DD adjuvant activates complement and can bind to complement receptors 1 and 2 (CR1/CR2) on follicular dendritic cells (FDCs), and, in this way, directly affect the functions of the FDC.22 The FDC network has a critical role in organizing B-cell follicles and the GC reaction (reviewed in ref. 23).24 Depletion of FDC or their ability to trap immune complexes (ICs) strongly impairs class switch recombination (CSR), somatic hypermutation (SHM), and memory development in mice.25\u201327 Furthermore, FDCs express a number of receptor ligands and soluble factors to attract and interact with the activated B cells and provide them with integrated signals to achieve proliferation and differentiation, involving selection of high-affinity memory B cells and long-lived plasma cells.23,28\u201331 Of several factors, CXCL13 has been found critical for the recruitment of CXCR5-positive B cells and Tfh cells into the follicle to form GC.30,32\u201334 Although CXCL13 acts locally, it can also be detected in human plasma, where perturbations in plasma CXCL13 levels have been suggested to be a reliable biomarker for GC formation.35,36",

To facilitate our studies of FDCs, we developed a mouse model in which CD21-positive cells endogenously express membrane bound GFP, whereas CD21-negative cells express tdTomato. Using this model, we could clearly distinguish pure FDCs from other stromal cell populations, which lack markers typically associated with mature FDCs.25,26 Here, we report that CTA1-DD is the first known adjuvant to bind and directly influence gene transcription in FDCs. In this way CTA1-DD greatly upregulated Cxcl13 gene expression, which was associated with an enhanced GC reaction, following parenteral, as well as mucosal immunizations. The effect of intranasal as well as oral immunization on neonatal FDCs was compelling and these cells matured into adult-like cells that strongly promoted GC B-cell and Tfh development. Following combined oral and intranasal immunizations of neonatal mice with a candidate influenza vaccine, CTA1-3M2e-DD, we could demonstrate that oral administration of the vaccine was effective and enhanced vaccine immunogenicity and improved protection against influenza-infection by reducing morbidity.",

To this end, we monitored the kinetics of adjuvant localization in the draining lymph nodes following intravenous (i.v.), subcutaneous (s.c.), and i.n. administrations. We found that mucosal as well as systemic administration of CTA1-DD, as well as enzymatically inactive CTA1R7K-DD, resulted in co-localization of the adjuvant with CD35+ FDC in the B-cell follicle (Fig. 1a), suggesting that the DD part of the fusion protein is instrumental for FDC binding.22 As a control, mice were administered with OVA-FITC, which bound poorly to FDC when analyzed by FACS, revealing the high specificity of the CTA1-DD binding to the FDC network (Fig. 1b). Hence, the adjuvant accumulated to CD21+ FDCs after both systemic and mucosal administration and roughly 25% of the FDC had bound peak levels of the adjuvant already after 3 h (Fig. 1b). The augmenting effect on serum antibodies following i.n. immunization with NP-CPG was similar to that of systemic CTA1-DD adjuvanted immunizations and the effect on generating increased Tfh and GC B-cell levels in the mLN were comparable to those seen in inguinal lymph nodes (iLN) following s.c. immunization (Fig. 1c, d; gating strategies in Supplementary Fig. 1). Taken together, the CTA1-DD adjuvant affected immune responses in draining lymph nodes similarly irrespective of the route of administration.",

As expected, secondary lymphoid tissues in CD21mT/mG mice hosted B-cell follicles with a distinct FDC network (Fig. 2a upper panel). Upon immunization with CTA1-DD adjuvant, we found a much denser and higher GFP-expressing FDC (CD21) network than in unimmunized control mice, as also defined by FDC-M2 co-staining (Fig. 2a lower panel and Fig. 2b). This increase in the percentage of GFP+ lymphoid stromal cells that were CD45\u2212 CD31\u2212 B220\u2212 F4/80\u2212 CD11c\u2212 GR1\u2212 CD138\u2212 was confirmed by FACS analysis, demonstrating a significant increase in FDCs 4 days following s.c immunization with the CTA1-DD adjuvant (Fig. 2c, e, f). Furthermore, Ki67 staining of iLN sections from CD21mT/mG mice and FACS analysis of these cells, confirmed that GFP+ FDC-M2+ cells are proliferating, and increasing in percentage and number in response to CTA1-DD (Fig. 2d, f). Contrary to a previously published study using a similar CD21-Cre-based model, our mice expressed CD21 (messenger RNA (mRNA) and protein; Supplementary Fig. 2a, g) in GFP+ FDC, but not Cxcl12 (mRNA, Supplementary Fig. 2f) and we did not find labeled CD21- stromal cells in the T-cell zone, as reported (Fig. 2a and Supplementary Fig. 2g).41,42 To further evaluate our CD21mT/mG model, we undertook an extensive FACS- and quantitative PCR (qPCR) analysis of FDC and non-FDC stromal cells (Supplementary Fig. 2a\u2013f).28,41,43 Focusing on GC relevant genes, we selected the stromal population expressing the highest levels of the Cxcl13 for further analysis as this encodes the main factor responsible for attracting activated Tfh and B cells to the GC.30,32\u201334 Quantitative reverse transcription PCR (RT-qPCR) analysis of sorted GFP+ lymphoid stromal subpopulations showed highest gene expression of Cr2 and Cxcl13 in FDC-M2 stained cells, affirming a unique FDC-identity of these cells in our CD21mT/mG mice (iLN; Supplementary Fig. 2f and spleen; Supplementary Fig. 2h), and allowing for a detailed investigation of the impact of vaccine-adjuvant treatment on this critical subset of cells for the GC reaction (Fig. 2e).",

To this end, we immunized CD21mT/mG mice s.c. with CTA1-DD adjuvant or its enzymatically inactive mutant, CTA1R7K-DD, and isolated FDC-M2+ GFP+ FDC from the iLNs 4 days after immunization in agreement with already well established protocols.32,44 After enzymatic digestion of draining LNs, FDCs were identified as shown in representative FACS plots (Supplementary Fig. 2b). For gene expression analysis, we isolated mRNA and conducted RT-PCR for pre-selected genes using custom-made qPCR plates (Qiagen and confirmed with qPCR primers). Several genes were upregulated in iLN FDCs after s.c. immunization with CTA1-DD adjuvant (Fig. 2g). Most importantly, Cxcl13 gene expression was increased ninefold compared to resting/naive FDCs, suggesting a direct effect on the ability to recruit activated lymphocytes to the FDC network (Fig. 2g). Other genes influencing GC formation and maintenance were also significantly upregulated, including Icam-1 (26-fold), Cr2 (14-fold), Il-6 (sixfold) and to a lesser extent Il-1\u03b2, Cd40, Lt\u03b2r, and Baff encoding genes (Fig. 2g). The observed upregulation of FDC gene expression was enzyme-dependent, because the inactive CTA1R7K-DD molecule had only minimal effects, especially on the expression of Cxcl13, Il-6 and Icam-1 encoding genes. By contrast, the mutant CTA1R7K-DD caused a significant increase in Il-15 gene expression (25-fold higher than naive and 2.5-fold higher than the CTA1-DD adjuvant), indicating that also CTA1R7K-DD was biologically active, but having a differential effect on gene transcription compared to the enzymatically active CTA1-DD molecule (Fig. 2g). Noteworthy, adjuvant activation of gene expression in other lymphoid stromal cell populations (Cxcl12, Vcam-1) or indicating contamination with GC B cells (Bcl-6), were not apparent after immunization with CTA1-DD or its inactive mutant (Fig. 2g). Neither were genes involved in putative FDC differentiation, such as Rank-L and Madcam-1, affected by adjuvant treatment (Fig. 2g). The enhancing effect on Cxcl13, Cr2 and Icam-1 gene expression was observed already on day 1 after immunization with the CTA1-DD adjuvant, increased to day 4 and was sustained still after 6 days (Fig. 2h).",

We found that in mice with CR2 expression on B cells only or in mice where FDCs were CR2 deficient (WT BM to CR2 \u2212/\u2212 chimeras), expression of target genes was unchanged, while in mice with CR2 replete FDCs we found a significant upregulated Cxcl13 gene expression (Fig. 2i). Hence, the enhancing effect on gene transcription of CTA1-DD adjuvant was linked to CR2 expression on FDCs and unaffected by B cells irrespective of CR2 expression. Taken together, our data provide compelling evidence that CTA1-DD adjuvant not only targets FDCs via CR2, but also directly modulates FDC function by affecting gene expression at an early time point, promoting GC formations, as well as over time supporting a strong GC reaction.",

            "text": "It is well documented that newborn mice do not develop GC because they lack mature FDCs.45,46 To further explore the potential of the CD21mT/mG model system, we investigated young neonatal mice and compared the GFP+ FDC network in young and adult mice with or without immunization with CTA1-DD adjuvant. We found that in 7-day-old mice, no GFP+ CD35+ FDCs could be identified in the spleen or peripheral lymph nodes,24,47 albeit CD21-GFP+ cells were clearly seen in the B220+ B cells (Fig. 3a). By contrast, we observed clear evidence of an FDC network in Peyer\u2019s patches (PPs), supporting the hypothesis that microbial colonization of the gut in early life drives maturation of FDC maturation48,49 (Fig. 3a). However, at 17 days of age, adult levels of FDC-networks (CD35+) were observed also in peripheral lymph nodes of CD21mT/mG mice (Fig. 3a).24,47 We then asked whether the direct gene transcriptional effect of the CTA1DD adjuvant on FDCs could be used to improve GC responses also in neonatal mice. Indeed, we found that CD21+ CD45\u2212 FDCs isolated 4 days after CTA1-DD immunization on post-natal day 3 showed strongly upregulated Cxcl13 gene expression as compared to 7-day-old mice exhibiting no FDCs or unimmunized naive FDC at 17 days of age (Fig. 3b). We found newly developed FDC-networks in 10\u201312% of B-cell follicles of the CTA1-DD immunized mice (Fig. 3c). Most impressively, we observed mature GC (GL-7+) in lymph node sections that were comparable to those in adult adjuvant-treated mice 12 days following a s.c. immunization with NP-OVA admixed with CTA1-DD (Fig. 3d). Indeed, neonatal mice developed the same frequency of GC per B-cell follicle as adult mice as evaluated by IHC, using the same immunization regimen (Fig. 3e). Importantly, antigen-specific isotype-switched anti-NP antibodies were significantly enhanced in neonatal mice following a single s.c. immunization with CTA1-DD adjuvant compared to mice given NP-OVA antigen alone (Fig. 3f). This antigen-specific antibody response increased over time even without a booster immunization, indicating persistence of neonatally induced plasmablasts for at least 5 weeks after priming (Fig. 3f). A booster immunization further elevated the adjuvanted response in neonatal mice to a level comparable to that seen in adult mice (Fig. 3f compare to adult levels in Fig. 1c). We concluded that CTA1-DD adjuvant enhanced Cxcl13 gene transcription and effectively matured neonatal FDCs, which also resulted in strongly enhanced isotype-switched antibody responses. In fact, the adjuvant fully compensated the normally poor ability of neonatal mice to respond to vaccination and significantly increased frequencies of GC B cells and TFH cells both after prime and boost immunizations (Fig. 4a\u2013d). A linear regression analysis indicated that the increased frequencies of TFH and GC B cells correlated equally well in adult and neonatal mice, confirming the exceptional effectiveness of the CTA1-DD adjuvant (Fig. 4e). This was also observed as a dramatically increased expression of BCL6+ TFH cells after CTA1-DD adjuvant treatment of neonatal mice (Fig. 4f).",

This gave us the idea to explore this site further in our attempts to successfully vaccinate neonatal individuals.50,51 Hence we turned to per oral (p.o.) immunizations, although we had previously experienced failure of CTA1-DD to adjuvant oral vaccination in adult mice.52 We immunized CD21mT/mG mice at 5 days of age by feeding them NP-OVA with or without CTA1-DD adjuvant and boosted the mice via oral gavage with NP-OVA alone after 30 days. The induction of TFH and GC B cells was assessed in the PPs, as well as the draining sub-mandibular LN (smLN) and the mesenteric LN (MLN). We found strikingly enhanced immune responses in mice given oral CTA1-DD adjuvant with significantly increased frequencies of GC B cells and TFH cells both after initial priming and after a boost immunization in the PP, in particular (Fig. 5a\u2013d). Indeed, in the PP, 60% of the IgDlowCD95+ GL7+ B cells in adjuvant-treated mice expressed Ephrin-B1, a reliable marker of GC B cells, as opposed to 30% in unadjuvanted mice53 (Fig. 5e). We also noticed a higher frequency of memory CD73+ B cells (Fig. 5e), as well as plasma cells (CD138+ CD19+ cells; Fig. 5f) in the PPs following oral CTA1-DD treatment of neonatal mice.54\u201356 These changes in the PP GC environment accompanied a significantly stronger serum antigen-specific IgG response and high-affinity antibody titers as assessed by the ratio of NP4/NP30 titers, in particular, were greatly augmented, indicating that somatic hypermutation was promoted in neonatal PPs following oral CTA1-DD adjuvant treatment (Fig. 5g). Local gut mucosal IgA expressing B-cell populations were also significantly increased following p.o. priming with CTA1-DD adjuvant in neonatal mice (Fig. 5h). Thus, in contrast to adult mice (Fig. 5i), oral priming immunizations, even with low doses of antigen, revealed a strong adjuvant effect of CTA1-DD in neonatal mice.",

This was followed by two CTA1-3M2e-DD booster immunizations given i.n. before we evaluated the protective effect against a live challenge infection with the X47 influenza virus strain (a reassortant of A/Victoria/3/75 (H3N2) and A/Puerto Rico/8/34(H1N1)). We detected substantial increases in serum anti-M2e IgG-specific antibody levels in mice that received the oral priming dose compared to i.n. only immunized mice (Fig. 6a). In fact, the serum titers were tenfold increased in mice that had received oral priming with the adjuvant compared to i.n. immunized mice (Fig. 6a). Virus-challenged mice were monitored for weight loss, morbidity and mortality for 15 days of the infection. The orally primed neonatal mice exhibited a reduced morbidity and recovered significantly faster than i.n only immunized mice (Fig. 6b). These mice gained weight better upon recovery from the infection. Despite this the overall survival rate was 50 to 60% in both groups compared to the phosphate buffered saline (PBS) control mice, which all died from the lethal challenge infection (Fig. 6b). Also, M2e-tetramer-specific lung CD4+ T cells were effectively induced in both orally primed and i.n. only immunized mice as observed after the challenge infection (Fig. 6c). Similarly, comparable M2e-specific serum IgG and BAL IgA were recorded in both groups after infection (Fig. 6d). Surprisingly, the total gut IgA antibody levels in intestinal lavage after the challenge infection were comparable between the two groups, suggesting that the local intestinal priming effect of oral immunization appeared ineffective and no M2e-specific antibodies were detected (Fig. 6d, e, not shown). Importantly, the enzymatically inactive fusion protein CTA1R7K-3M2e-DD did not stimulate M2e-specific serum IgG or IgA responses nor did it induce M2e-specific lung CD4+ T cells, attesting to the critical role of the CTA1 enzyme for the adjuvant effect (Fig. 6f).",

Peyer\u2019s patches are the major sites for gut mucosal GC reactions and induction of secretory IgA responses and can be targeted via oral immunization.58 Therefore, we attempted oral immunizations and found that this route allowed for effective priming of an anti-influenza immune response that resulted in reduced morbidity upon a virus challenge infection.59",

Hence, a direct targeting of the vaccine-adjuvant formulation to FDCs improved the maturity and function, almost to adult levels, which resulted in significantly stronger Tfh and GC B-cell development. This function appears to be different from that of other adjuvant formulations, of which most have been found to act through receptors on classical DCs.60 Moreover, the mechanism of action was dependent on the ADP-ribosylating ability of the CTA1-enzyme because the inactive mutant CTA1R7K-DD failed to enhance FDC functions. In a previous study we also demonstrated that complement activation by the DD-part enabled access to FDCs via their CR2s (CD21).22 By enhancing Cr2 gene expression in the FDC, CTA1-DD adjuvant could also influence CR2-mediated trapping of ICs to the FDC network, and, in this way increase antigen availability that could promote CSR and SHM in activated B cells. Thus, two different elements of the fusion protein, CTA1 and DD, contributed to its FDC-immunoenhancing functions.",

We found that CTA1-DD adjuvant bound to the FDC network in B-cell follicles of draining lymph nodes within hours of administration and subsequently within 24 h isolated FDCs exhibited enhanced gene expression of several GC-promoting genes, including the Cxcl13 gene, which encodes Cxcl13 that is the major lymphocyte chemokine attractant of activated Tfh and B cells to the GC.61 This effect also resulted in a marked increase in the size and frequency of GCs in the B-cell follicles. Noteworthy, because Cxcl13 has been reported to be a reliable biomarker of the GC reaction,36 correlating to enhanced antibody responses, we believe this effect of the adjuvant is central to its immunoenhancing functions. However, the effects on Icam-1 (26-fold), Cr2 (14-fold), Il-6 (sixfold) and to a lesser extent Il-1\u03b2, Cd40, Lt\u03b2r and Baff gene expression were also enzyme-dependent and likely contributed to the effects on FDC maturation and the augmented GC-functions.22 These transcriptional changes were largely maintained over at least 4\u20136 days, which is the time when the GC reaction develops (reviewed in ref. 62). The inactive mutant as well as the active CTA1-DD fusion protein also strongly enhanced IL-15 gene transcription, which could exert an anti-apoptotic effect on GC B cells in combination with CD40L-expressing Tfh cells.63 We convincingly demonstrated that CTA1-DD did not directly affect the activated B cells using chimeric mice as we were able to exclude B cells as targets of the CTA1-DD adjuvant action. CR2 expression in B cells had no influence on FDC gene expression, while CR-2 deficient FDC failed to show an upregulated Cxcl13 gene expression.",

More precisely, CTA1-DD adjuvant accelerated the kinetics of maturation of neonatal CD21+ FDCs and enhanced Cxcl13 gene expression. While mature FDCs are not found in lymph nodes or spleen of neonatal mice the use of the CD21mT/mG mouse clearly identified and confirmed maturation of the FDC network following treatment with the CTA1-DD adjuvant.64 The effect was accompanied by increased frequencies of GC B cells and Tfh cells. Moreover, whereas the priming effect of CTA1-DD on GC development was prominent, a subsequent booster dose of antigen alone resulted in a dramatic augmentation of affinity matured antibody responses, suggesting that memory B cells, in particular, were favored by adjuvant treatment, which agrees well with previously published work in neonates.64 To this end, we observed that adjuvant enhanced Tfh cells in neonates expressed high levels of Bcl-6, suggesting a strong influence on the GC reaction, which also resulted in long-lived plasma cell formation and an increased level of serum antibodies that was maintained for at least 5 weeks following a single priming immunization with CTA1-DD-adjuvant. Interestingly, following immunization with aluminum-adjuvanted vaccines earlier studies have suggested that the failure to develop TFH cells, in particular, is responsible for the impaired GC development in neonatal mice.65,66 It was suggested that both TFH-intrinsic and environmental factors fail in neonates requiring complementary stimuli to promote GC formations.40 Moreover, the related adjuvant, LTK63, has been reported to enhance GC reactions and specific antibody production in neonates through an effect on FDC maturation.37,39 By contrast, though, these effects appeared independent of gene transcriptional effects, but rather were dependent on marginal zone macrophages migrating into the GC and producing TNF.39 Indeed, LTK63 is largely lacking enzymatic activity and can thus be predicted not to influence gene transcription in FDCs. Other adjuvants have also been reported to affect the GC reaction. For example, MF59 improved GC formation in early life, but the effect depended on an enhanced TFH cell response rather than a direct effect on FDCs.15 As FDCs express TLRs, several other vaccine adjuvants may potentially activate these cells and the TLR4-stimuli LPS, for example, was found to increase CD16/32, ICAM-1 and VCAM-1 but this effect appeared only after 3 days, similar to the effects of Alum and MF59, and could be a consequence of tissue damage and inflammation, rather than an effect on FDCs.67,68 Thus, it appears that the CTA1-DD adjuvant is quite unique and effective at augmenting the GC reaction through a direct gene transcriptional effect on the FDC.",

This fact, was further explored in the influenza vaccine model where we observed reduced morbidity and stronger serum IgG antibody responses in mice orally primed with CTA1-3M2e-DD compared to i.n. only immunization regimens. However, the oral CTA1-DD adjuvanted priming response did not stimulate a significant gut IgA response, arguing for multiple oral doses being  required also in neonates for intestinal responses, which we have documented earlier for adult mice.59",

Earlier attempts at vaccinating against influenza in these age groups have been quite discouraging and associated with significant adverse reactions.71\u201374 However, these studies did not explore the potential of mucosal vaccination, but other vaccine studies have evaluated the use of oral priming in neonatal Macaque and Pig models against Simian immunodeficiency virus and rotavirus, albeit using live attenuated vaccines, with promising results.75,76 As oral priming is more effective for stimulating immune protection against enteric infections we also intend to test neonatal vaccination against rotavirus infections, using a CTA1-VP6-DD fusion protein.76",
