KMnO4 or sulfuric acid-anisaldehyde spray. Column chromatography was performed using Davisil\u00ae (40 -63 \u00b5m) or on a Reverleris X2 (Grace) automated flash unit. NMR spectra were recorded on a Varian Mercury 300 MHz spectrometer. Chemical shifts (\u03b4) are given in ppm and spectra are referenced to the residual solvent peak. NMR signals were assigned by means of gCOSY and gHSQC measurements. After glycosylation reactions, stereo-and regiochemistry was proven by means of gHMBC and NOESY. Exact mass measurements were performed on a Waters LCT Premier XETM Time of Flight (ToF) mass spectrometer equipped with a standard electrospray (ESI) and modular Lockspray TM interface.

The antiviral, other than anti-HIV, assays were based on inhibition of virus-induced cytopathicity or plaque formation in human embryonic lung (HEL) fibroblasts, African green monkey cells (Vero), human epithelial cells (HeLa) or Madin-Darby canine kidney cells (MDCK) . Confluent cell cultures in microtiter 96-well plates were inoculated with 100 CCID50 of virus (1 CCID50 being the virus dose to infect 50 % of the cell cultures) or with 20 plaque forming units (PFU) (VZV) in the presence of varying concentrations of the test compounds. Viral cytopathicity or plaque formation was recorded as soon as it reached completion in the control virus-infected cell cultures that were not treated with the test compounds. Antiviral activity was expressed as the EC50 or compound concentration required to reduce virus-induced cytopathogenicity or viral plaque formation by 50 %. Cytotoxic concentration was expressed as the MCC or minimal cytotoxic concentration being the compound concentration that was required to afford a microscopically visible alteration of cell morphology. Assays involving HCMV and VZV were performed as described in literature. 1",
