Furthermore, long-term treatment with commonly used antifungals, such as amphotericin-B, has toxic effects: ketoconazole, fluconazole and clotrimazole are limited in their spectrum and efficacy and use may result in strain resistance.6, 7 For this reason, there is a need for new active molecules which can serve as lead for further development in antifungal chemotherapy.",

            "text": "Air-dried plant material (10 kg) was pulverized and extracted with 95% ethanol (4\u00d7 15 L) for 24 h at room temperature. The whole extract was concentrated under reduced pressure by using rotatory evaporator at 50 \u00b0C and finally dried under vacuo to get solid mass coded as D002 (315 g). The crude ethanolic extract (145 g) was macerated with n-hexane to get n-hexane-soluble fraction (F003, 2.5 g). The insoluble residue was partitioned between chloroform and water to give chloroform-soluble fraction (F004, 40 g) and aqueous portion. The aqueous portion was then partitioned with n-butanol to give n-butanol-(F005, 63 g) and water-soluble fraction (F006, 39 g). All these fractions were submitted for evaluation of antifungal activity against human pathogenic fungi. The chloroform fraction (F004) showed significant antifungal activity. The fraction F004 (15 g) was subjected to column chromatography by using n-hexane containing increasing amount of acetone as an eluent to give a fraction F007 n-hexane\u2013acetone (9:1 v/v) in which activity was localized. The fraction F007 (7 g) was further subjected to repeated column chromatography by using benzene and increasing amount of methanol as an eluent to give two compounds 1 and 2. The compound 2 was identified as 3-hydroxy-1-methoxy anthraquinone-2-carboxaldehyde by comparison of their spectral data with those reported in the literature9, 10, 11 and the structure of the newly isolated compound 1 was elucidated as 3,4-dihydroxy-1-methoxy anthraquinone-2-carboxaldehyde by their detailed spectral and chemical analysis. Compound 1 was obtained as yellowish amorphous powder and crystallized in methanol acetone mixture, mp 273\u2013275 \u00b0C. In IR spectrum of the compound a strong absorption band for hydroxyl group was observed at 3400 cm\u22121, other characteristic bands appeared at 1670, 1587 cm\u22121 due to anthraquinone nucleus9, 12, 13 and at 1652 cm\u22121 and 1640 cm\u22121 due to the two chelated carbonyl groups. ESMS(+ve) displayed [M+H]+ peak at 299 corresponding to the molecular formula C16H10O6 and other fragment peaks at m/z 271 and 267 were observed after loss of CO and OCH3 groups from the molecular ion. The 1H NMR spectrum of the compound (Table 1\n) showed signal at \u03b4 10.45 (1H, s) for aldehydic proton and two 1H singlets at \u03b4 12.07 and 13.06 due to chelated hydroxyl protons. A multiplate at \u03b4 7.77\u20137.84 (2H, m), signal at \u03b4 8.17 (1H, d, J\n = 7.9 Hz), 8.24 (1H, d, J\n = 7.9 Hz) for the aromatic proton of the type \u2018AA\u2032, BB\u2032\u2019 confirmed the presence of the four aromatic proton.13, 14, 15 Other signal in the 1H NMR spectrum at \u03b4 4.10 was assignable to the OCH3 group. The aldehyde group of the compound 1 was reduced to CH2OH with methanolic sodium borohydride to give compound 1R.16 The 1H NMR spectrum of the compound 1R having a 1H singlet at \u03b4 13.06 due to the hydroxy group chelated with one of the carbonyl group of the anthraquinone nucleus revealing the position of one hydroxy group at C-4 of the anthraquinone nucleus. The signal at \u03b4 12.07 which disappeared on reduction of compound 1 to compound 1R thus belonged to the hydroxyl group chelated to the aldehyde group. It must be located at the carbon ortho to the aldehydic group. Moreover, the methoxy proton signal appeared somewhat down field (\u03b4 4.10) from its normal position \u03b4 (3.50) indicating that methoxy group must be flanked by anthraquinone carbonyl and aldehydic groups. The 13C NMR spectrum of the compound (Table 1) showed a total 16 carbons. Their multiplicity assignment was made by DEPT experiment. It revealed the presence of 1 methyl, 5 methine and 10 quaternary carbons. Out of these signals at \u03b4 127.5, 134.25, 134.35 and 127.5 assigned to four aromatic methines, signals at \u03b4 180.4 and 182.8 for two carbonyl groups of anthraquinone nucleus,12 signal at \u03b4 195 for aldehydic carbon, signals at \u03b4 164.0, 164.5 and 164.09 to oxygenated aromatic carbons, signal at \u03b4 119.0 to the aromatic quaternary carbon bearing aldehydic group and remaining signals at 117.0, 109.0, 134.0 and 133.0 to the aromatic quaternary carbons and the signal at \u03b4 65.6 is due to methoxy carbon. All these spectral data suggested compound 1 to be 3,4-dihydroxy-1-methoxy anthraquinone-2-carboxaldehyde.",
