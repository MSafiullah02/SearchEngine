As citizen Samuel Pepys lamented at the time, \"But Lord, how empty the streets are, and melancholy.\" 3 And as Celina Mu\u00f1oz writes in her brilliant essay The Plague, the Poor, and the Problem of Medicine, \"[In 1665] London residents were locked behind hundreds of shut doors, hastily detailing death records or helplessly succumbing to the plague themselves.\" 4 Glaring differences exist alongside similarities in the medical care delivered in plague-ridden London, when compared to our current situation. In 1665, certain professions were at each other's throats. Mu\u00f1oz states that in London nonphysicians such as apothecaries and surgeons \"were able to challenge the hierarchy of medical professionals by providing what their college-educated counterparts failed to deliver: care.\" 4 While the Hippocratic oath was certainly known to medieval physicians, it was silent on the actual duties of physicians in the event of an epidemic. Physical presence and on-site devotion to patients were widely considered optional by licensed physicians. Therefore Mu\u00f1oz writes, \"During the medieval plague years the prevailing wisdom among licensed doctors was simple: 'flee early, flee far, and return late.'\" 4 Don't stick around and take chances; get out of town; protect yourself.",

A duty-to-treat ethic did exist during this time, however, but its source was religious. It originated in the powerful Christian virtues of charity and service to the poor rather than from a sense of professional obligation. 4 The concept of sin and wrongdoing permeated the idea of disease in the 1600s. Mu\u00f1oz: \"Others preached religious calls to action, claiming that sins had caused God to place the plague upon them. ...Early modern London linked the poor to uncleanliness, uncleanliness to sin, and sin to disease. Government-instituted laws that stemmed from such beliefs worsened poor conditions by failing to properly administer to their problem. This failure left the poor few options for survival, which allowed quacks and swindlers to doubly victimize them.\" 4 Thus during the plague years in London \"religions overtones are everpresent in medical treatises,\" Mu\u00f1oz reports. 4 The poor were regularly singled out as sinful, but so too were able-bodied idle folk who simply chose not to work. This was not surprising, as sloth or idleness was generally considered as one of the Seven Deadly Sins.",

King Charles II himself was taken in by the false claim that fumigation of houses actually cured the plague of 1665. 13 In this instance the fumigation was accomplished by burning a combination of brimstone, amber and saltpetre. The claim that fumigation actually cured plague was false. \"But the burning of brimstone did not get rid of plague; rather, it discouraged rats and other rodents for inhabiting houses,\" reports Mu\u00f1oz. 4 \"The London government,\" says Mu\u00f1oz, \"tricked by a French quack [who recommended fumigation], revealed its inefficiency; not only had the crown allowed poor residents to become victims, but its lack of adequate judgment let a fraud take advantage of the government itself!\" 4 And there was a report of a swindler who had claimed to possess a cure for plague, who actually died of the disease himself. 14 We are in the embrace of history once again via the indiscretions of government in the form of reckless statements by the president. \"When President Donald Trump recently touted the common malaria treatments hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine as potential remedies for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) , he ignited unprecedented demand for the drugs-and set scientists' teeth on edge,\" reported Charles Piller on the Science journal website in an article titled \" 'This is insane!' Many scientists lament Trump's embrace of risky malaria drugs for coronavirus.\" 15 Microbiologist Natalia P. Taschner added, \"Although doctors regard hydroxychloroquine as relatively safe at prescribed doses for short periods, it has been associated with life-threatening cardiac side effects and suicidal behavior\u2026.

Affluent Londoners fled the disease, as did the licensed medical professionals\u2026. Essentially, the plague was attributed to the living conditions, sinful behavior, and corrupted constitutions of the poor; the Crown of London had blamed the victims for their own troubles. The issues of early modern poverty remain relevant to universal concerns about the struggle of underprivileged populations to survive in an increasingly connected, yet still somewhat detached, world.
