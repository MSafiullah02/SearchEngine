Practically no compartmentalization was present in any of the enclosures except for a small separated area for kittens in one enclosure and one separated area for treatment of sick cats in the second enclosure. The original cats\u2019 population was formed by two main groups of animals: one formed of cats rescued during the evacuation of Israeli settlements in the Gaza strip in late 2005 and the other formed of cats raised in a shelter (cattery B) situated about 100 km to the north of cattery A and that was closed due to poor conditions. Small groups of cats were accepted to cattery A after its establishment. No history of vaccination was available for any of these populations. Prior to entry to the cattery, cats were castrated/neutered, but not vaccinated. The animals were feed with commercial cat food and received water ad libitum. Public access to the cattery was limited. A veterinarian visited the cattery approximately three times a week. Most of the sick cats were treated in the cattery, but a few were treated off-site by volunteers. In 2006, a few months after the establishment of cattery A, an outbreak of respiratory disease was reported. Nasal and pharyngeal swabs and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) from sick cats were sent for bacteriological culture in the Kimron Veterinary Institute (KVI). Following the first cases, dead cats started to be sent for post-mortem examination in the KVI and internal organs were sampled for histopathological and bacteriological exams.",

An additional blood agar plate was incubated for 48 h in anaerobic conditions (Pack Anaero, Mitsubishi, USA). Bacteria that grew under aerobic conditions were identified by morphology and standard biochemical methods (Quinn et al., 1994). S. zooepidemicus final identification was confirmed with API Rapid ID32 Strep (bioMerieux, France). Anaerobic bacteria were identified with API ID32A (bioMerieux, France). BAL, swab and lung specimens were inoculated in Mycoplasma broth (Rosengarten et al., 1994) under 37 \u00b0C, 5% CO2 for 48 h, and plated onto Mycoplasma agar (Rosengarten et al., 1994) afterwards. Mycoplasma agar plates were incubated in a moist chamber under the same conditions and observed for Mycoplasma colonies growth every 2 days for up to 10 days. Mycoplasma final identification was performed by immunofluorescence with antibodies for M. felis, M. gateae, Mycoplasma arginini and Mycoplasma felifaucium (Purdue University School of Veterinary Medicine, West Lafayette, IN). Slides for Chlamydophila spp. immunofluorescence stain (Chlamydia Cel LPS, Cellabs Pty. Ltd., Brookvale, NSW, Australia) were prepared from BAL, swab and lung samples.",

Interestingly, one strain of S. zooepidemicus (Ct28/07), isolated from the brain in a case of meningoencephalitis, grew only in an anaerobic atmosphere at first, requiring a 5% CO2 atmosphere for growth thereafter. S. zooepidemicus was not isolated from any of the 29 dead cats that were received for post-mortem examination without clinical and pathological signs of respiratory disease, and only from two of ten cases in which respiratory disease was suspected prior to death, but no gross pathological signs were found in the post-mortem examination.",

Because the vaccination status in cattery A was unknown, the possibility of S. zooepidemicus infection being secondary to viral infections could not be ruled out. Lesions suggesting feline infectious peritonitis were found in a few cases during the pathological examination, but the presence of feline coronavirus was discarded by immunohistochemical stains (data not shown). Lesions resembling feline distemper were also observed in a few cats, but most of these were not included in this report due either to lack of respiratory symptoms or S. zooepidemicus isolation. The prevalence of FHV-1 and FCV was not assessed, but we assumed that these viruses were most probably present in the cattery, as suggested by typical clinical signs of infection with these viruses in some cats. Infections by FHV-1 and FCV are limited mostly to the upper respiratory tract and although they may predispose to secondary infections they do not directly cause pneumonia (Greene, 2006). Stress caused by the transfer and merging of different populations of cats in a single enclosure may have greatly predisposed to the respiratory infections reported here.",

Israeli cat isolates belonging to the same genogroup showed 100% homology. Cat isolates in genogroup II showed a two nucleotide difference compared to S. zooepidemicus strain no. 14, which was isolated from a case of metritis in a mare. S. zooepidemicus isolates belonging to genogroup I were closely related to Streptococcus equi subsp. equi reference strains EF 406086, similarly to previous work (Baverud et al., 2007). No correlation was found between genogroup and time of isolation during the outbreak. The earliest typed strains isolated Ct4/06 and Ct5/06 were clustered in genogroup II, but Ct6/06, which was isolated within 2 months from the above strains, was clustered in genogroup I.

Cattery B was closed due to poor conditions and all the animals were transferred to cattery A at the time of its establishment. This population constituted most of the cats in cattery A at that time. Close to the place where that cat was raised there was a petting farm, with goats, sheep and other farm animals. It is possible that S. zooepidemicus has been introduced to cattery A by the population of cats brought from cattery B and that those cats were somehow infected either by direct contact with animals in the petting farm or through stray cats in the same region.
