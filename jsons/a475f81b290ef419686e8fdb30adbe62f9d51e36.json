As shown in figure  1 , amplification was successful in two out of 5 of the NPA tested (006222 and 006223), whereas there was a very significant decrease in one of them (006221) and no amplification at all in the two samples where we also failed to detect high concentrations of SARS-CoV-2 (006224 and 006225).

In addition, we also found a very high correlation between the two methods in terms of Ct values. The success of SARS-CoV-2 diagnostic using this methodology, however, appeared strongly dependent on the properties and robustness of the RT-PCR commercial mix used since some virus transport media (eg UTM from COPAN swabs) appeared incompatible with subsequent SARS-CoV-2 detection in some mixes. In addition, some non-swab samples (eg NPA), showed PCR inhibitory properties rendering them incompatible with all RT-PCR mixes evaluated in this study.
