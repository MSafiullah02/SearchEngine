            "text": "As the world faces a large outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) epidemic, the airborne transmission risk of the novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) was first confirmed by the National Health Commission of the People's Republic of China (J. Wang & Du, 2020), and then by the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Although the virus diameter of SARS-CoV-2 is from 50 to 200 nm (Guzman, 2020), it has been confirmed that SARS-CoV-2 spreads through inhalation or ingestions of droplets they contaminate. As a result, coughing, sneezing, and touching infected surfaces are primary sources of infection. As a cellular entry receptor for SARS-CoV-2 (H. Zhang, Penninger, Li, Zhong, & Slutsky, 2020), Angiotensin Converting Enzyme 2 (ACE-2) are abundantly present in humans in the epithelia of the lung and small intestine, as well as present in mucosae (mouth and nose) or conjunctiva (eyes). Therefore, it is critical to prevent the SARS-CoV-2 laden droplets from reaching the respiratory systems or the eyes. To slow the spread of COVID-19 via airborne transmission, a \u201csocial distancing\u201d policy of approximately 1.83 m (6 feet) is recommended. However, this social distance is defined with static ambient air which is not realistic, and also neglects the effect of relative humidity (Drossinos & Stilianakis, 2020). In addition, it is often assumed that most of the respiratory droplets fall and reach the floor. However, emitted micro-droplets have low Stokes numbers (Finlay, 2001), which can be significantly influenced by the convection of ambient airflow and transport much farther than 1.83 m. Such an unknown effect increases the complexity of social distancing policy making and may pose potential risks to people in contact with the airborne SARS-CoV-2. Therefore, it is necessary to systematically investigate how the ambient wind and relative humidity can influence the air transmission of SARS-CoV-2-laden droplets generated by coughs from a COVID-19 positive patient to a healthy human subject standing farther than 1.83 (6 feet) away. Such research is also crucial because visualizing the airborne transmission of the SARS-CoV-2-laden droplets between humans to inform people to be aware of the importance to personal protection equipment (PPE), and to be responsible for helping reduce the spread of the virus to protect susceptible population groups, i.e., seniors with underlying conditions such as influenza, cystic fibrosis, and diabetes.",

Zhang & Li, 2012; Zhu, Kato, & Yang, 2006) have been done to either characterize cough aerosol clouds or simulate aerosol transport phenomena in both indoor and outdoor environments. However, most of the numerical studies, either using Euler-Euler or Euler-Lagrange based models, neglected the condensation and evaporation of the cough droplets, which may limit the validity of droplet trajectory predictions. Based on our literature review, only three papers investigated the condensation and evaporation effects of cough droplets (\\Chen & Zhao, 2010; X. Li et al., 2018; Yan, Li, & Tu, 2019). Specifically, using a Euler-Lagrange based method with a single virtual human, Chen and Zhao (Chen & Zhao, 2010) claimed that the indoor temperature and relative humidity (RH) have a negligible effect on the dispersion of saliva droplets with initial diameters from 0.1 to 200 \u03bcm in an indoor environment with specific ventilation conditions. Li et al. (X. Li et al., 2018) investigated the cough droplet transport and size change dynamics of a virtual human in a static ambient air condition. Yan et al. (Yan et al., 2019) investigated the thermal effect of the human body on the evaporation of the cough droplets for a virtual human in a sitting position. All three papers employed a single virtual human, and did not investigate potential exposure health risks to the cough droplets for a second virtual human nearby.",

Specifically, using benchmark data of cough aerosol characterizations (Duguid, 1946; L. Yang, Li, Yan, & Tu, 2018), this study simulated the transient transport, condensation/evaporation, and deposition of SARS-CoV-2 laden droplets emitted by a cough between two virtual humans with different environmental wind velocities. Initial droplet diameters range from 2 to 2000 \u03bcm, and the wind velocities range from 0 to 16 km/h, representing different Beaufort wind scales from calm air to gentle breeze. Ambient relative humidities (RHs) are 40% and 99.5%. The distance between the two virtual humans are selected as 1.83 m, and 3.05 m (6 feet, and 10 feet). Trajectories and size changes of SARC-CoV-2-laden droplets and transient laminar-to-turbulent airflow fields are visualized. Furthermore, local deposition patterns of the virus-laden droplets are calculated and compared with environmental weather conditions.",

The distributions of V* have no significant changes with the increase in wind velocity Vin. However, with the increase in Vin, the strength and complexity of the recirculating flows are enhanced, which can be observed form the topology changes of the streamlines at Y = 0. The intensified recirculating flows have impacts on the cough droplet transport with higher Vin (see Section 3.3). Furthermore, high-velocity flows exist outside of the wake flow formed downstream to the human who coughs (left in Fig. 1), which can be both observed from the velocity contours at planes X = 0 and Y = 0. Specifically, as the V* contours shown at plane X = 0 in Fig. 3(a)\u2013(c), the higher velocity outside of the wake flow generates secondary flows and vortices rotating towards the centerline between the two virtual humans. These horizontal secondary flow patterns also restrict the dispersion of the cough droplets in Y direction during their transport, and most of the droplets were not able to escape from the wake flow region (see Section 3.3). The airflow streamlines also show that the wind flow near the ground is able to pass between the legs of the left virtual human and rise towards the head region of the right virtual human, which indicates the possibility to lift settling droplets toward the face of the healthy virtual human to the right. In addition, the recirculation zone downstream to the healthy virtual human (right in Fig. 1) lead to droplet deposition on the backside.",

Selecting t = 0.5 s as the representative time when the cough jet ends, the droplet sizes and positions in different cases are visualized in Fig. 4(a)\u2013(h). With Vin increases from 0 to 5.5 m/s, the convection due to the ambient wind becomes more dominant to small droplets. This can be proved by the smaller distance between the frontier of the droplet cloud and the healthy human to the right in the figures with Vin increases. It is interesting to see that larger droplets are not affected by the enhanced wind velocity when Vin<5.5 m/s. Specifically, the large droplets in gray color, all traveled approximately 1.81 m at t = 0.5 s in Fig. 4(a)\u2013(f). Such an observation indicates that those the inertia and gravitational sedimentation are dominant for those large droplets. The exceptions are shown in Fig. 4(g) and (h). The enhanced localized turbulence intensity and airflow momentum in the recirculation zones between the two virtual humans, larger droplets are influenced and moved back towards the left human who coughs. Indeed, With high wind velocity entering the computational domain, the local airflow velocities in the recirculation zone have higher magnitude and higher turbulence intensity. Therefore, the convection effect is more dominant so that it can influence the larger droplets and conquer their inertia, forcing them to follow the backward recirculation flow. Such trajectories led to the deposition patterns of the droplets in gray color shown in Fig. 8\n(c) and (d). Moreover, the RH effect on the droplet size change dynamics is noticeable. Droplet sizes in cases with RH = 99.5% (see Fig. 4 (a), (c), (e) and (g)) are larger than the cases with RH = 40% (see Figs. (b), (d), (f), and (h)) This is because the high RH (99.5%) enhances the hygroscopic growths of the droplets, while the low RH (40%) leads to droplet shrinkage due to the evaporation.",

Fig. 5(a)\u2013(f) visualize the cough droplets positions and sizes at different times in static air from t = 1.0 s to t = 15.0 s. Droplets can only obtain momentum and energy from the cough jet when the ambient wind velocity is zero (see Fig. 2 (a)). It can be observed that large droplets move faster and stay more concentrated than small droplets. This is because large droplets have relatively high Stokes number, indicating the less dominant effect of viscous dissipation forces acting on them. Therefore, they are more \u201ccapable\u201d of keeping their initial trajectories. In contrast, with the larger surface area to volume ratio, small droplets lose their initial momentum and kinetic energy quickly due to the viscous dissipation effect from the drag force mainly. Thus, they are dispersed very fast in static air. Fig. 5Fig. 5(e) and (f)(e) and (f) demonstrate that with the current 1.83 m (6-feet) social distancing policy, microdroplets can still transport to the head region of the healthy virtual human standing on the right. Therefore, the current social distancing policy is not 100% safe even for the ideal static air condition.",

Specifically, the droplets are restricted in the region with a width approximately equal to the with of the shoulders. This is because the horizontal recirculation flows towards the centerline between the two humans (see Fig. 3(a)\u2013(c)). In addition, the dominant wind convection conveys extra momentum and kinetic energy to the droplets and accelerates them to move faster towards the head region of the healthy human to the right following the airflow streamlines (see Fig. 5, Fig. 6). With the recirculation effect in the vertical direction compared with the static air, some droplets traveled backward and stayed around the left human who coughs.

With Vin = 1.0 m/s, high RH lead to higher depositions of small droplets on both humans and the ground (see Fig. 8(a) and (b)), while the deposition patterns of large droplets colored in gray and red are similar and not influenced significantly by the RH. With Vin = 5.5 m/s, high RH still lead to higher depositions of small droplets on the healthy human standing on the right, as shown in Fig. 8(c) and (d). However, small droplet deposition patterns are similar on the human who coughs, which are located around the head region and the upper body above the chest (see the deposition patterns in the red circles in Fig. 8(c) and (d)). For larger droplet in gray, higher RH increases the deposition on the human who coughs, but lowers the deposition on the healthy human. Such phenomena are possibly due to the different droplet size change dynamics, which altered the transient droplet-air interactions and the resultant droplet trajectories and their deposition sites. Comparing the deposition patterns between Vin = 1.0 m/s and 5.5 m/s at the same RHs, stronger wind leads to more depositions of larger droplets on both humans. It is because that the stronger secondary flows induced by the high wind velocity and momentum to alter the larger droplet trajectories. Those droplets follow the streamlines and recirculate before the deposition led by gravitational sedimentation and inertial impaction. Besides, it is obvious that both humans have SARS-CoV-2 laden droplets on their body and head region during the single cough event. Therefore, it is necessary to avoid body contact with others before changing clothes and washing hands after possible exposure.",

It can be concluded from Fig. 9(a)\u2013(c) that, high RH increases the deposition fractions (DFs) on both humans and the ground. However, the higher deposition does not necessarily mean higher exposure risk or infection risks, since research indicates that higher RH above 40% may be detrimental to reduce the survival of many viruses including different types of coronavirus (Casanova, Jeon, Rutala, Weber, & Sobsey, 2010; Chan et al., 2011; Dietz et al., 2020; S. W.; Kim, Ramakrishnan, Raynor, & Goyal, 2007). It is interesting that increasing the wind velocity from 3.9 m/s to 5.5 m/s decreases the DFs on both human bodies (see Fig. 10\n(a) and (b)). Therefore, the wind effect on the droplet deposition is obscure and needs further investigation with different wind velocities and directions. Fig. 9 (d) visualized the fraction of droplets suspending in the computational domain at t = 15 s. For static air condition (Vin = 0), there are more droplets suspending in the air with RH = 40% than RH = 99.5%. Such an observation indicates that high RH may lead to faster gravitational sedimentation of airborne droplets due to the hygroscopic growth effect. For the cases with ambient winds, the fractions of suspending droplets are not significantly influenced by the RH. Fig. 9 (d) also shows that increasing wind velocity will result in stronger convection, which provides faster airborne transmission of the droplets and less suspending droplets in the computational domain.",

It can be clearly seen that RH = 99.5% induces hygroscopic growths of the droplets, while RH = 40% induces water evaporation and droplet size reduction. It worth mentioning that the wind effect is negligible on the droplet size changes of suspending droplets, since the wind volumetric flow rate is much larger than the cough jet, so that the relative humidity in the computational domain is determined by the RH carried by the wind velocity. Fig. 10 (b) shows the deposition droplet sizes at different times. With the same RH, droplets deposit faster with high wind velocity due to the strengthened convection than the cases with low wind velocity. For the two cases with RH = 40%, the deposited droplets with the same initial diameters become smaller if they deposit at later times.

Specifically, the reduction of the large droplet deposition on the human who coughs (left in the figures) is due to the altered wake flow patterns between the two humans with the Lsd extension. Compared with Lsd = 1.83 m (see Fig. 7 (c)), large droplets in gray in Lsd = 3.05 m case avoided entering the recirculation region traveled faster forward (see Fig. 11 (d)). Another evidence can be found by the deposition pattern differences shown in between Figs. 8 (c) and Fig. 11 (b). No large droplets deposit on the human who coughs in Fig. 11 (b) than Fig. 8 (c), indicating that no large droplets moved backward in the 3.05 m cases. The other groups of large droplets in red are dominated by the gravitational sedimentation and deposit on the ground due to the larger Lsd = 3.05 m (see Figs. 8 (c) and Fig. 11 (b)). In contrast, microdroplets in blue will still be able to follow the mainstream and transport to the head region of the healthy human (right in and Fig. 7 (d) and Fig. 11 (d) & (f)). Thus, although Lsd = 3.05 m is able to reduce the exposure risks to airborne SARS-CoV-2 laden droplets, i.e., slightly reduced the DF from 2.4% to 1.9% compared with Lsd = 1.83 m with Vin = 5.5 m/s and RH = 99.5%, there is still some deposition on the healthy human 3.05 m (10 feet away) from the human who coughs.",

It is worth mentioning that the gust employed in this study is with a fixed frequency, i.e., 2.0 Hz. Different gust frequencies will be investigated in the future to draw a more generalized conclusion. Based on the comparison between the droplet positions at two different time stations in Fig. 11(c)\u2013(f), it is interesting to find that the gust condition was able to convect the cough droplets faster towards the healthy human direction than the steady-state wind condition. The gust also leads to higher deposition on the healthy human and no deposition on the human who coughs (see Fig. 11 (b)). The difference in droplet transport and deposition between the steady-state wind and the gust is due to the difference in the recirculating flow patterns between the two virtual humans. Specifically, the interval gust condition will not generate the quasi-steady-state recirculations, which lead to the faster transport of the droplets towards the downstream direction. Without moving upstream, no droplets deposited on the human who coughs, and more droplets transported downstream and deposited on the healthy human. Thus, with the same peak wind velocities, the gust enhances the exposure risk of the healthy human compared to the steady-state wind condition.",

The average gap between the face contour and the edge of the N95 mask was intentionally exaggerated to approximately 1.8 cm, mimicking the worst scenario with the inappropriate mask seal. Employing the realistic filtration efficiencies as a function of particle diameter (see Fig. 12 (b)), a customized C code was programmed to reflect the probabilities of particle trapping accurately when the cough droplets enter the N95 mask which is assumed to be a porous media region. For example, when entering the N95 mask region, the C code will generate a random number between 0 and 1 for each particle. If the random number is lower than the filtration efficiency for the specific particle diameter, then the particle will be assigned a velocity equal to zero, which indicates it has been captured by the mask. For the computational domain of the N95 mask, the porosity is 0.88, and the viscous resistance coefficient is 1.12e10 m-2, which is based on existing studies (X. Zhang, Li, Shen, & Cai, 2016).",

As shown in Fig. 12(c)\u2013(f)Fig. 12(c)\u2013(f)Fig. 12(c)\u2013(f), although there are still cough droplets that cannot be captured by the mask, the total number of the cough droplets transport in the air is significantly lower than the case without the mask (see Fig. 7). With the mask, airborne droplets are all relatively small, and entering the airflow is slightly delayed. However, those small droplets can still follow the mainstream airflow streamlines (see Fig. 1 (a)) and reach the healthy virtual human on the right. Thus, it can be concluded that even if wearing facial masks without the proper seal with the face can significantly reduce the airborne transmission of cough droplets.

            "text": "To slow the spread of the COVID-19 virus via airborne transmission, although a \u201csocial distancing\u201d policy of approximately 1.83 m (6 feet) is recommended, it needs to be scrutinized. By visualizing the trajectories and fates of SARS-CoV-2-laden droplets with various ambient conditions using the CFPD model with modeling the condensation/evaporation effects between the ambient water vapor and the droplets, this study found that the 1.83 m (6 feet) social distancing policy is the \u201cminimum requirement\u201d and is not sufficient to avoid the contact of SARS-CoV-2 due to the complexity of environmental wind conditions. These conclusions do not consider the sneeze droplet cloud that can span approximately up to 8 m (27 feet) (Bourouiba, 2020). Therefore, a safe social distance is highly dependent on different factors, so it is highly recommended that people wear masks and other face coverings when in public. Major conclusions are listed as follows:(1)A carrier of COVID-19 who coughs can produce virus-laden droplets in micron size that remain viable in the air exposing healthy people near (6ft) and far(10ft) from the source in a static air environment.(2)Wind effect on the droplet transport and deposition is complex and highly dependent on the wake flow patterns and localized secondary flow intensities between the two virtual humans, as well as the steadiness of the wind. It is certain that the current 6-feet social policy is not sufficient to protect people from SARS-CoV-2 exposure generated by coughs with the ambient wind.(3)High RH = 99.5% leads to higher deposition fractions on both human bodies and the ground, which is not necessarily related to higher exposure risks. High RH = 99.5% can enhance the condensation effect, and the cough droplet sizes keep growing during their transport in the air until the partial pressure at the droplet surface is equal to the saturation pressure of water vapor. In contrast, RH = 40% triggers the evaporation of the water in cough droplets, thereby leading to droplet size reduction, which may lead to a longer time suspended in the air.(4)Although longer social distance can reduce the cough droplet depositions on the human body, there are still SARS-CoV-2 laden droplets that may suspend near the head region or deposit on the healthy human.(5)Even wearing facial masks in an unrealistically loose condition when coughing can significantly reduce the suspension of small droplets in the air.\n",
