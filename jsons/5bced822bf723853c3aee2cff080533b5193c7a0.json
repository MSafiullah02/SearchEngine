This retrospective study was conducted in the general intensive care unit of the University General Hospital of Patras, Greece, during a 5-year period (2012-2016). All adult patients with a Gram-positive BSI were included. PCR was applied to identify mecA gene (staphylococci); vanA, vanB, and vanC genes (enterococci). Linezolid-resistant S. epidermidis, MRSA, and VRE were further typed by multilocus sequence typing. Mutations in region V of 23S rDNA and ribosomal protein L4were investigated by PCR and sequencing analysis. The presence of the cfr gene was tested by PCR. In total, 141 Gram-positive BSIs were included. Coagulase-negative staphylococci predominated (n = 69; 65 methicillin-resistant, 23 linezolid-resistant carrying both C2534T and T2504A mutations and belonging to the ST22 clone), followed by enterococci (n = 46; 11 vancomycin-resistant carrying vanA gene, classified into four clones), S. aureus (n = 22; 10 methicillin-resistant, classified into three clones) and streptococci (n = 4). The most common type of infection was catheter-related (66; 46.8%), followed by primary BSI (28; 19.9%). Overall 14-day fatality was 24.8%. Multivariate analysis revealed septic shock as independent predictor of fatality, while appropriate empiric antimicrobial treatment and catheter-related BSI were identified as a predictor of good prognosis. Even though most of Gram-positive cocci were multidrug-resistant, fatality rate was low, associated with catheter-related BSIs. Among CNS, LR isolates represented one-third of BSIs due to the dissemination of ST22 S. epidermidis propagated by utilization of linezolid.",

Staphylococcus aureus represents the most virulent among Gram-positive cocci and accounts for 9% of BSI in Greece, of which more than 40% were caused by strains resistant to methicillin (MRSA) [5] . MRSA incidence progressively declined from 2000 to 2015 [7] . Occurrence of vancomycin resistance among enterococci declines in Greece, representing 7.5-8.5% of isolates in the UGHP during the study period (personal data). According to the European Center for Disease Prevention and Control, vancomycin resistance among Enterococcus faecalis decreased from 5.2% in 2006 to 0% in 2017; vancomycin resistance among E. faecium decreased during the same period from 42.5 to 30.8% [8] . The high prevalence of multidrug-resistant Gram-positive cocci has led to increased use of antibiotics with enhanced anti-Gram-positive activity, such as glycopeptides, and newer ones like linezolid and daptomycin [1, 9] . The use of linezolid contributed to the rise and dissemination of strains resistant to that antibiotic, especially in CNS [10] [11] [12] [13] .",

The CDC definition was used to characterize BSI as primary or secondary (urinary, respiratory, catheter-related, abdominal, skin and soft tissue infections, endocarditis, meningitis) [14] . Infection was categorized as sepsis or septic shock according to new sepsis definition. The date of collection of the first positive blood culture was defined as infection onset [15] .

The most common type of infection was catheter-related (66; 46.8%), followed by primary BSI (28; 19.9%), urinary tract infections (16; 11.3%), abdominal infection (12; 8.5%), and ventilator-associated pneumonia (10; 7.1%) ( Table 1) . Coagulase negative staphylococci (CNS) predominated (n = 69; 63 S. epidermidis, two S. haemolyticus, two S. lugdunensis, one S. capitis, and one S. hominis; 65 methicillin-resistant, 23 linezolid-resistant), followed by enterococci (n = 46; 11 VRE), S. aureus (n = 22; 10 methicillin-resistant carrying mecA gene, MRSA), and streptococci (n = 4; two S. agalactiae, one S. gallolyticus, one S. mitis). All 23 coagulase-negative staphylococci that showed linezolid MIC > 256 mg/l, were S. epidermidis, carried both C2534T and T2504A mutations and belonged to the ST22 clone. None of them carried the cfr gene or any mutation in the L4 ribosomal protein gene. Among the 11 VRE, eight were E. faecium carrying the vanA gene and belonging to ST117 (n = 4), ST17 (n = 3), and ST203 (n = 1), two were E. gallinarum, vanC-positive, and one E. faecalis vanA-positive belonging to ST28. MRSA belonged to ST80 (n = 4), ST30 (n = 4), and ST239 (n = 2). Overall 14-day fatality was Twenty-three among the 69 coagulase-negative staphylococci were methicillin and linezolid-resistant, therefore, we have performed a secondary analysis for risk factors for development of bacteraemia by linezolid-resistant strains. Multivariate analysis revealed administration of linezolid (P0.015; OR 4.9, CI 1.4-18.1) as the only independent risk factor for development of bacteraemia by linezolid-resistant coagulase-negative staphylococci Table 2 .",

            "text": "As compared to carbapenemase-producing Gram-negative bacilli, fatality of BSIs due to Gram-positive cocci was lower (24.8%), as previously shown [2] . The most consistent predictor of survival in the literature was administration of appropriate empiric antibiotic therapy [1, 22] . In the present study, despite the high rate of multi-drug resistant pathogens (86; 61.0%; 10 MRSA, 65 MR-CNS, 11 VRE), 86.5% of patients received appropriate empiric treatment. This high percentage can be explained by the fact that these pathogens are prevalent in the Greek healthcare system, leading to an empiric initiation of anti-Gram-positive antibiotics, such as glycopeptides (vancomycin or teicoplanin), linezolid, or daptomycin in all patients with a severe infection [5] . Glycopeptides were the preferred agent as empiric coverage in our cohort, with only 11 isolates (8.7%) being resistant. In the EUROBACT study, vancomycin was also the most commonly used antibiotic with anti-Gram positive action, followed by linezolid and daptomycin [1] . Even though many studies have shown during the last decades an increase of vancomycin MIC among MRSA [23] , a phenomenon known as MIC creep, our isolates had an MIC \u2264 1 mg/l, for which vancomycin remains the preferred agent. A previous Greek multicenter study showed a decrease of MIC among MRSA from 2008 to 2012, which was probably due to the reduction of vancomycin utilization in favor to newer therapeutic options, such as linezolid and daptomycin [8] .",

            "text": "Another reason for the low fatality was the fact that Grampositive bacteria, as compared to carbapenemase-producing Gram-negative bacteria, were more commonly associated with CR-BSIs [24] , and better clinical outcome due to easy and rapid source control by removing the infected catheter [1, 4, 21, 25] . In the present study, CR-BSIs accounted for more than half of BSIs, and can explain the fact that CNS predominated among Gram-positive cocci, since they have a propensity to colonize indwelling devices and subsequently provoke infection. Reinforcing strategies for prevention of CR-BSI are the following: training of medical personnel on antisepsis, introduction of checklist for CVC insertion, and education of nursing personnel for disinfecting techniques for inserted catheters [25] . One-third of infections due to CNS were linezolid resistant (LR). Consistently with the literature, prior administration of linezolid was the only risk factor for development of infection by LR isolates [11, 12, 26] . Among patients with LR-CNS [11, 26] . All LR S. epidermidis belonged to ST22 and carried both C2534T, T2504A; aforementioned ST and mutations were found in previous studies from our setting and other Greek and European hospitals underlying the success of that clone [11, 13, 26] . The efficacy of LR-CNS in disseminating and becoming endemic in different hospital wards, including those with low linezolid consumption, was shown in a Spanish university hospital. In that study, LR S. epidermidis belonged to ST2 and apart from G2576 T 23S rDNA mutation, they also carried a variety of mutations in the genes encoding L3 and L4 ribosomal proteins [27] . No isolate in the present study carried the transferable cfr gene which encodes an rRNA methyltransferase; this gene has been detected in CNS, S. aureus and even enterococci, especially in central and north America [28] . Clones of vancomycin-resistant E. faecium found in the present study (ST117, ST17, ST203) represent previously found ones in Greece, belonging to the highly worldwide successful clonal complex 17 [29] . Epidemiology of ST types of MRSA strains represents the current Greek epidemiology with the invasion of the community-acquired ST80 clone in the healthcare system supplanting the previous nosocomial clone of ST239 [7, 30] . The four infections due to ST30 depict this clone's dissemination among patients and personnel of the ICU [31] .",
