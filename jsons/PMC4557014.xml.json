            "text": "Lectins are widespread in nature and have been reported from prokaryotes, as well as from eukaryotes. They are defined as proteins or glycoproteins that recognize carbohydrates. The term of lectin appeared at the end of the nineteenth century as molecules able to recognize the histoblood group of antigens. The name lectin, related to the Latin verb \u201clegere\u201d, which means \u201cto select\u201d, was given by Sharpey and Boyd for describing a protein able to link non-covalently and reversibly to carbohydrates and agglutinate and/or precipitate polysaccharides and glycoproteins [1]. This definition has continuously evolved. Nowadays, a lectin is a protein or a glycoprotein, which differs from an immunoglobulin, with at least one carbohydrate recognition domain. The binding of the protein to carbohydrates does not involve any enzymatic modification or any cleavage of these carbohydrates. The interest of lectins resulted in their biological activities, their involvement in tissue morphogenesis, regulation of physiological functions and metabolism or protection against the environment [2,3,4,5,6]. Efforts in lectin purification were mainly performed in order to explore their biological activities and/or biotechnological potencies.",

Plant lectins, in particular Concanavalin A, demonstrated to affect both apoptosis and autophagy by modulating cell-signaling pathways of cancer cell lines. Concanavalin A showed to collapse the potential of mitochondrial membrane in human melanoma A375 cells, triggering the release of the cytochrome C and the caspase activation, both involved in cell apoptosis. Concanavalin A also induced apoptosis in ovarian cancer SKOV3 cells by modulating the expression of apoptosis-involved proteins cyclooxygenase 2 (COX-2), B-cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl-2), and serine-threonine protein kinase AKT and activating the Foxola-Bim signaling pathways [9]. The bean Phaseolus vulgaris lectin demonstrated to inhibit the proliferation of nasopharyngeal carcinoma HONE-1 cells [10]. Furthermore, plant lectins were also used as polyclonal activators of T-cells in order to study the in vitro lymphocyte functions. Concanavalin A and phytohaemagglutins revealed to bind membrane carbohydrates expressed on T-lymphocytes, and then to activate mitogenic response of lymphocytes and the production of cytokines [11,12].",

The galectin prototypes are non-covalent dimers, each possessing two identical carbohydrate recognition domains. The chimera-type galectins have two distinct domains, an N-terminal collagen-like domain and a C-terminal galectin, which potentially binds non-sugar moieties to sugar moieties. Finally, two carbohydrate recognition domains linked by a functional linker peptide are specific for the tandem-repeat-type galectin. Nonetheless, Porifera galectins differ from the usual animal galectins because they harbor specific structural features. They can create large complex molecules in the presence of Ca2+ (not involved in the carbohydrate binding) and showed an extremely high affinity for N-acetyl-galactosamine-containing saccharides [38].",

This method creates an osmotic shock, which breaks the cell membranes and therefore easily liberates molecules from cytosol. Some protocols used calcium- and magnesium-free seawater (CMFSW) supplemented with 250 mM ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) [50,55,56] in order to maintain the seawater osmolarity and to prevent links between membrane proteins involved in sponge cell-cell adhesion [57].

In most cases, the first purification step involved affinity chromatography [53,54], according to the carbohydrate specificity of the lectin (Table 2). Due to the strong affinity of sponge lectins for galactoside residues, sepharose or lactose-conjugated matrices were often selected [61,62]. By using affinity chromatography with rabbit erythrocyte stroma followed by a gel filtration on Ultrogel AcA 44 column, the Axinella corrugata (George and Wilson, 1919) lectins-I and -II (AcL-I and -II) were purified [53,63]. Sometimes, a specific antibody directed against lectins was fixed onto a column in order to retain the lectins, as illustrated with the Cinachyrella apion (Uliczka, 1929) lectin (CaL), which was purified by using an antibody directed against the Cliona varians (Duchassaing and Michelotti 1864) lectin (CvL) [59,60]. Some lectins were also eluted from the affinity matrix using buffers selected according to different parameters, including substrate competition [58,62], disruption of weak interactions within the substrate-ligand complex [55], ionic force [54], pH stability [60], or chelation of ions (Ca2+) involved in the binding of the protein complex [59].",

A neighbor-joining phylogenetic tree from this alignment using 1000 bootstrap repeats is shown in Figure 1. The results revealed that the studied sponge lectins have evolved from different proteins, already present in the common ancestor of Eumetazoa and Porifera. Sponge galectin, C-type and tachylectin-like lectin genes are more closely related to other animal lectin genes than to sponge lectin genes, except for the sponge galectin genes from G. cydonium and Cinachyrella sp., which are phylogenetically very similar. Both sponge galectin genes are related to vertebrate galectin genes such as the human galectin 1 and 3, the salmon galectin 3 and the conger eel galectin. Surprisingly, both S. domuncula galectin 1 and 2 genes are phylogenetically separated and more related to Crassostrea gigas galectin-8. The S. domuncula galectin-2 gene was found to be closely related to the L. baicalensis MBL gene, encoding for a C-type lectin. The MBL, including L. baicalensis MBL, and the other sponge C-type lectins, including A. vastus lectin, are phylogenetically separated, suggesting that they have evolved from different proteins. The sponge tachylectin-like lectins from S. domuncula and E. fluviatilis, named S. domuncula lectin and E. fluviatilis lectin, respectively, form with tachylectin-1 and Branchiostoma belcheri lectin a phylogenetically conserved group that have evolved from an ancestral protein. The C closely related-type lectin from A. vastus belongs to this group, suggesting that members of this group may have also differently evolved.",

            "text": "The G. cydonium galectin (GCG) was the most studied lectin among the Porifera phylum. GCG was firstly isolated from specimens collected in the Mediterranean Sea by using an affinity chromatography coupling hog A+ blood group substances with Sepharose 4B. This lectin of 60 kDa turned out to be a tetramer with 15 kDa subunits and displayed an isoelectric point (pI) of 4.4. GCG showed to form a multimeric complex in presence of Ca2+, but the link between the lectin and the carbohydrates was not ion-dependent [57]. From a cDNA library obtained from the mRNA of the G. cydonium sponge, two cDNA clones were obtained for GCG, encoding two different GCG polypeptides LECT1 and LECT2 with deduced molecular masses of 15,313 kDa and 15,433 kDa, respectively [66,68,69,70,71]. Later, it was demonstrated that these two cDNAs were not derived from different genes and that three 13, 15 and 16 kDa monomers (GCG subunits) corresponded to alternative splicing variants of the same LECT1 gene. GCG shared characteristics from both prototype and chimera-type lectins [72]. The latter gene also displayed polymorphisms located in the carbohydrate recognition domain. This genetic variation did not concern amino acids involved in the interactions with the carbohydrates. In addition, investigations of the cDNA sequence of the galectin protein precursor revealed that the N-terminal region of the protein might act as a putative transmembrane segment. Following this sequence, an N-terminal secretion signal cleavage site was identified. It was postulated that this sequence probably recruited protease to get the soluble form of GCG. This feature is specific to this galectin because other animal galectins are synthesized without this signal sequence [73]. Analyses of soluble and membrane-containing fractions of G. cydonium revealed that GCG was present in both fractions. The mechanism of the protein maturation and the function of both soluble and membrane-binding galectins remained obscure. The N-terminal region of GCG soluble form contained also a protein domain, which is usually involved in the binding to prokaryotic membrane lipids [57,74]. Intriguingly, by using cytochemical staining of carcinoma cells, it was reported that the nuclear binding of the G. cydonium galectin was mediated by protein-protein interactions with a 56 kDa nucleoplasmic protein (np56) [55].",

The galactoseceramide Sdgal-1 isolated from S. domuncula was found to inhibit the carbohydrates-binding activity of the Sd galectin 1. The Sd galectin 2 underwent self-association in the presence of Ca2+. The primary structure of this galectin consisted of two galactose-binding sites and a hydrophobic domain at the N-terminal region. Its C-terminal hydrophobic domain showed to interact directly with \u03b1 silicatein, an enzyme involved in the spicule formation in siliceous sponges.

However, peptide sequencing revealed at least two isoforms with very similar galactoside-binding domains, which showed to be tolerant to high temperatures (100 \u00b0C). According to the authors, these galectins aggregated to create a stable tetramer [65]. CchG 1 was the first three-dimensional structure of a sponge lectin determined by X-ray crystallography. This lectin demonstrated to be formed by two sequences of five antiparallel \u03b2-sheets paired face-to-face through a hydrophobic core. Therefore, CchG 1 consisted of a rigid toroidal-shaped \u201cdonut-hole\u201d tetrameric arrangement, whose final structure was based on the presence of canonical dimers.

The C. tenuiviolacea lectin (CtL) (22 kDa) was purified by using a gel filtration chromatography followed by affinity chromatography. The agglutination activity of CtL towards human erythrocytes of ABO groups was inhibited by lactose, suggesting a potential specificity for \u03b21-4-linked galactose residues.

Among all tested sugars, haemagglutination activity of HL against human erythrocytes was only inhibited by lactose [46]. The C. alloclada lectin (CalL) was isolated by using an affinity chromatography. The carbohydrates which carry galactose and non-reducing galactosyl groups showed to inhibit its agglutination activity on human erythrocytes [84].

DaL was composed of two subunits of 18 and 36 kDa [86]. The H. okadai lectin-2 (HoL-2) was identified by using an affinity chromatography.

These latter developed channel-like structures, that were very similar to these produced by gemmules during their hatching.

The endothelial leukocyte adhesion molecule-1 (ELAM-1), secreted by blood vessel cells, demonstrated to mediate cell adhesion of leukocytes via recognition of a specific carbohydrate ligand found on neutrophil cells [96]. Similarly, in invertebrates, this role is played by secreted lectins. A 18-kDa lectin-like aggregation factor, purified from the horseshoe crab Limulus polyphemus, revealed to agglutinate horse erythrocytes and to aggregate Limulus amebocytes [97]. The C-type Zhikong scallop Chlamys farreri lectin-2 also revealed its ability to bind the surface of scallop hemocytes and to initiate the hemocytes recruitment in order to enhance the immune encapsulation process [98]. Such roles in innate immunity have been also demonstrated by the Drosophila melanogaster galectins 2 and 3 and the bay scallop Argopecten irradians lectin AiCTL-9, which have shown to bind hemocytes and to enhance the cellular encapsulation [99,100].",

The plant lectin abrin from the rosary pea was the first lectin recognized as a defense protein [113]. Since this work, plant lectins have demonstrated deleterious activities against a large panel of invaders including bacteria, fungi and predatory animals such as insects [114,115,116]. In vertebrates, these defense roles are mainly played by collectins and ficolins, which showed to bind carbohydrates from microorganisms. However, if they do not directly kill microorganisms, they are able to promote the recruitment of immune cells (opsonin), as illustrated with the SP-A human surfactant protein and the l-ficolin [117,118,119]. Similarly, in invertebrates, the MBP-CfC1qDC-2 collectin-related protein, isolated from the scallop Chlamys farreri, can bind numerous pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMP), such as LPS, peptidoglycan (PGN), \u03b2-glucan, mannan, as well as different microorganisms, including Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria as well as yeasts [120]. The Crassostrea gigas C1q complement-related protein CgC1qDC-1 revealed to bind LPS and was supposed to attract immune cells, promoting the phagocytosis of Gram-negative bacteria [121]. In addition to their opsonin role, invertebrate lectins also displayed antimicrobial activities on pathogens, as illustrated with the Manila clam Ruditapes philippinarum MCL-4 and the Chinese shrimp Fenneropenaeus chinensis lectins [122,123].",

However, none study was reported on a sponge lectin symbiotic activity, although the role of carbohydrates was previously investigated and recognized for playing a crucial role in the colonization and settlement of symbionts within the host.",

            "text": "In some associations, the symbionts recognize sugars from the host as shown with the vertebrate intestine symbiont Bacteriodes thetaiotaomicron, which proved to initiate the colonization of intestine in response to fucosylated glycan production by the epithelium cells [131,132]. Another study performed with Xenorhabdus nematophila bacterial symbionts revealed that they adhere to clusters of spherical bodies inside the intestine of the parasite nematode Steinernema carpocapsae, within a mucus-like material composed of N-acetyl-glucosamine or N-acetyl-galactosamine [133]. Similarly, during Vibrio fischeri recruitment by the Euprymna squid, the animal produces a mucus-like material, in which the symbiont is accumulated [134]. The symbiont showed to bind the N-acetyl-d-glucosamine or N-acetyl-d-galactoside-containing sugars within the mucus [135]. On the contrary, in other associations, the symbiont revealed to be the source of the lectin-bound carbohydrate. For example, within the association between the Symbiodinium sp. dinoflagellate and the octocoral Sinularia lochmodes, a galactose binding lectin (SLL-2) was detected on the surface of symbiotic dinoflagellate cells. The authors deduced from these data that lectins could be the mediators of symbiotic associations [136]. Similarly, the marine nematode Laxus oneistus revealed to express a lectin in its mucus, which showed to possess a specific carbohydrate domain involved in the recognition and recruitment of sulfur-oxidizing bacterial symbionts [137]. This nematode lectin showed a similar sequence homology with the human dendritic cell-specific immunoreceptor, suggesting a tiny frontier between symbiotic and parasitic interactions [138]. Regarding the plant lectins, it has been demonstrated that they could mediate the first steps of the symbiont settlement within the legume-rhizobium symbiosis [139]. Specific recognitions between host lectins and symbiont polysaccharides were recognized as promoting the attachment of bacteria onto the roots, enhancing the secretion of the Nod factor and triggering the bacterial infection [140,141].",

Similarly to sponge lectins, the vertebrate galectin 3 was able in some conditions to develop the pro-inflammatory response. The superoxide production increased in neutrophil cultures in presence of recombinant human galectin 3, suggesting their activation [143]. A decrease of peritoneal inflammatory responses against pathogens was observed with galectin 3 deficient (gal3\u2212/\u2212) mice. Gal3\u2212/\u2212 mice developed less inflammation in the peritoneal cavity than in the wild type mice. Activation of inflammatory cells by thioglycollate caused lower levels of NF\u03baB response in gal3\u2212/\u2212 mice. These results support the inflammatory modulating activity of the multifaceted galectin 3. The morphology of macrophages from deficient mice demonstrated to be spindle-shaped, whereas galectin 3 promoted the cell survival of peritoneal macrophages [144]. Human galectin 3 also displayed chemotactic activity on neutrophils and macrophages as described for AcL and CvL [53,142,145]. Pro-inflammatory properties were also observed for lectins from other organisms, such as the algae Ticocarpus crinitus and the mussel Mytilus trossulus lectins, which showed to stimulate the cytokine production and the lymphocyte proliferation [14,15].",

This antibacterial effect was also reported against the bacterium S. aureus, with 90% of growth inhibition at 50 \u03bcg/mL, compared to the control culture [59]. Furthermore, the S. domuncula lectin cDNA displayed high similarities with tachylectin 1 cDNA, also called lectin L6, from hemocytes of the horseshoe crab Tridentatus trunculus [41]. Investigation of the antibacterial activity of this lectin against E. coli and S. aureus only revealed a weak activity (16%) against E. coli at 10 \u03bcg/mL (81% of growth inhibition at 300 \u03bcg/mL). The S. domuncula lectin specifically binds LPS, which are the major components of Gram-negative bacteria cell walls. This antibacterial activity was already evaluated in hemocytes from the horseshoe crab T. trunculus, for which several antibacterial lectins were isolated and identified as tachylectins 1, 2, 3 and 4. Tachylectin 1 showed antibacterial activity against Gram-negative bacteria [40]. Tachylectin 2 exhibited specificity to bind N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) and N-acetylgalactosamine (GalNAc) and was found to agglutinate several S. aureus strains [146,147]. Tachylectin 3 and tachylectin 4 targeted the LPS of Gram-negative bacteria, as described for Sd lectin [148,149]. This ability of sponge antibacterial lectins to target specific carbohydrates could potentially be used to develop antibiotics against resistant bacterial infections.",

The C. varians lectin exhibited agglutinating activity against promastigotes of L. chagasi, suggesting a possible application to fight against pathogenic protozoa. According to the two-fold serial dilution method, this lectin was able to agglutinate up to a titer of eight agglutinating units (AU) that correspond to agglutination of 106 cells by 1 \u03bcg of C. varians lectin [59]. The C. apion lectin showed a similar activity, agglutinating up to AU titer of 4 (6.7 \u00d7 105 cells for 1 \u03bcg of C. apion lectin). The agglutinating activity of both lectins was inhibited in presence of galactoside residues-containing carbohydrates (galactose and lactose) [60]. Similarly, lectins from plant extracts of Ricinus communis, Capparis spinosa, Prosopis farcta and Tamarix nilotica showed to agglutinate and to kill the parasite Leishmania major promastigote in vitro. Authors demonstrated that ingestion of the R. communis extract by the insect vector Phlebotomus papatasi increased the in vivo mortality of the parasites within the sandfly P. papatasi [151]. These results suggest that L. chagasi promastigotes have specific glycosylated receptors for these lectins on the cell membrane of the parasite. Specificities of parasite receptors have extensively been studied, especially for trypanosomatids [152,153,154,155]. These lectins may represent valuable tools for the detection and fight against the protozoan parasites. Similarly, a protective effect was reported for the lectin from the plant Synadenium carinatum on Leishmania amazonensis infection of BALB/c mice, highlighting its potency as an adjuvant in murine model of vaccination against American cutaneous leishmaniasis [156].",

According to the authors, the highest lectin concentrations, which led to a decrease of 50% (IC50) in cell survival, was 9 \u03bcg/mL and 11 \u03bcg/mL for HeLa and FemX cells, respectively [54]. The C. varians lectin also exhibited cytotoxic effects against the K562 erythroleukemia cell line (derived from a chronic myeloid leukemia) and the Jurkat cell line (a human T-cell leukemia cell line) (American Type Culture Collection (ATCC), Rockeville, MD, USA). The proliferation of the K562 cell line was dose-dependently inhibited by CvL (IC50 = 70 \u03bcg/mL); the cell viability reached a maximum decrease (25%) at 80 \u03bcg/mL of CvL. Jurkat cells were less sensitive to this lectin with an IC50 of 100 \u03bcg/mL. Conversely, no cytotoxic effect was detected against normal human lymphocytes [157]. The C. apion lectin was tested against HeLa, PC3 (human prostate adenocarcinoma) and 3T3 (immortalized mouse fibroblast line) cell lines. CaL caused a dose-dependent inhibition of cell proliferation in HeLa and PC3 cells. The IC50 for HeLa cells was obtained at a concentration of 10 \u03bcg/mL of CaL. Toxicity of CaL was demonstrated against 3T3 cells, without a significant effect on cell proliferation. The MTT assay did not reveal any cytotoxicity of CaL either on erythrocytes and peripherical blood cells or on solid tumors [158].",

This regulation suggests an induction of apoptosis and the cell cycle arrest. The lysosomal protease cathepsin B showed to play a central role in CvL-mediated apoptosis. CvL killed K652 cells mainly via a caspase-dependent mechanism, potentially involving the death receptor pathway [157]. The mechanism used by CaL to induce apoptosis of HeLa and 3T3 cells was mediated by caspase-independent and -dependent activities. The expression of Bax and NF\u03baB proteins increased in the presence of CaL lectin until 18 h of treatment before decreasing, but this overexpression was not observed for BcL-2 protein. CaL induces apoptosis via mitochondrial membrane permeabilization, promoting the release of cytochrome C, AIF (apoptosis-inducing factor) and/or endonuclease G [158].",

The specific binding of these lectins on non-solid tumors could be used to discriminate cancerous cells from normal cells, as membrane carbohydrates are different in tumor cells. These carbohydrates can be specifically recognized by lectins. Similarly to CaL, the plant Viscum album Mistletoe lectin I demonstrated to activate the caspase independently to the activation of the cell death receptor, through the release of cytochrome C into the cytosol of leukemic T- and B-cell lines [159]. The jack bean concanavalin A revealed to differently activate the apoptosis of ovarian SKOV3 cells and melanoma A375, triggering the activation of the Foxola-Bim signaling pathways or enhancing the release of cytochrome C from mitochondria, respectively. These results suggest that the same lectin, in this case concanavalin A, can differently act according to the type of cells [9,160]. Several lectins, including the plant Viscum album Mistletoe, the hexacoral Gerardia savaglia GSL and the jack bean Concanavalin A lectins, have been used to differentiate malignant tumors from benign tumors and the degree of glycosylation associated with metastasis [159,160,161].",

            "text": "By searching for molecules with neuromodulatory activities in sponge extracts [65], the authors set-up a bioassay in order to detect active molecules on mammalian ionotropic glutamate receptors, expressed in HEK293-T/17 cells. Both Cinachyrella sp. galectins 1 and 2 were subsequently isolated from a Cinachyrella sp. marine sponge. A 5-min application of CchGs (10 \u03bcg/mL) slowed down the time of desensitization of these currents and increased the amplitude of steady-state currents. The recombinant Cinachyrella sp. galectin a (1 \u03bcg/mL) slowed down in the same way glutamate-evoked currents from homomeric GluK2 kainate receptors expressed in HEK293-T/17 cells [65]. This inhibition was lost in the presence of lactose. Despite the lack of a nervous system in sponges, neural cell-specific proteins have already been found in these animals, such as a metabotropic glutamate receptor-like, potentially regulating membrane ionic canal activity in the demosponges S. domuncula and G. cydonium [162]. These data show that sponge lectins could act on the nervous system of higher animals. This neuromodulatory effect on vertebrate brains was already observed with plant lectins. The plant ConBr lectin, isolated from Canavalia brasiliensis, showed a nervous antidepressant-like activity. This lectin caused a potentiation of the fluoxetine action, a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor, leading to a decrease of the mouse immobility time during forced swimming tests [163]. Furthermore, rats treated with the Canavalia ensiformis concanavalin A dose-dependently demonstrated a velocity decrease of the cortical spreading depression propagation and an increase of the amplitude and the duration of the cortical spreading depression potential [164].",

According to their binding activities, Porifera lectins have been classified into lectin groups, including galectins, C-type, F-type and tachylectin-like lectins. Because of a lack of data, unclassified sponge lectins are presented according to their characteristics as intrachain disulfide bridge-containing, mucin-binding and N-acetyl-galactosamine/N-acetyl-glucosamine-binding lectins.",
