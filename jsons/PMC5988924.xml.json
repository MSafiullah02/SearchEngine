In response, response, the cells upregulate stress response pathways to recover from stress and maintain cellular homeostasis. Mitochondria are the vital intracellular organelles crucial for regulation of various intracellular events such as energy metabolism, innate immunity, and cellular homeostasis (Bratic and Trifunovic, 2010). Mitochondria are highly prone to various cellular stress conditions and undergo damage and dysfunction leading to disruption of vital mitochondrial functions. Owing to their multifaceted role in myriad cellular functions, the maintenance of mitochondrial homeostasis is integral aspect of cellular stress response and homeostasis. Virus infection can directly or indirectly impair mitochondrial function and dynamics. It can be a consequence of physiological stress associated with infection or viral proteins may directly interfere with mitochondrial function and dynamics.",

            "text": "Mitochondrial fission is initiated by recruitment of the dynamin-1-like protein (Drp1) to mitochondria (Fig. 1). Drp1 is a member of the dynamin superfamily of proteins consisting of a GTPase and GTPase effector domain. Drp1 recruitment and its activity is tightly regulated by post-translational modification such as phosphorylation, nitrosylation, and summoylation (Haun et al., 2013). Drp1 phosphorylation at the serine 616 residue by stress-signal-dependent CDK1 promotes Drp1 recruitment to the mitochondria. This process is mediated by mitochondrial outer membrane proteins including mitochondrial fission factor (Mff), mitochondrial division 49 and 51 (Mid49 and Mid51) that serve as receptors for Drp1 on the outer mitochondrial membrane (Palmer et al., 2011). Subsequently, Drp1 oligomerizes and tightly wraps around the mitochondria thereby constricting and severing the inner and outer mitochondrial membranes (Chan, 2006, Youle and Karbowski, 2005). Mitochondrial fission is also shown to be mediated by the ER tubules and actin filaments, independent of the Drp1 scission activity (van der Bliek et al., 2013). Mitochondrial fission facilitates the segregation of the damaged part of mitochondria from the dynamic mitochondrial network to allow its rapid removal through the mitochondria-selective autophagy process (Jin and Youle, 2012, van der Bliek et al., 2013).",

Mitofusins 1 and 2 present on the opposing fusion membranes form homo- or hetero-oligomeric complexes in trans thereby tethering their outer mitochondrial membranes (Detmer and Chan, 2007, Koshiba et al., 2004). Inner mitochondrial membrane fusion is mediated by OPA1. Interestingly, OPA1 presence on adjacent fusing membrane is not essential to facilitate fusion (Song et al., 2009). OPA1 is a multifunctional protein involved in mitochondrial cristae remodeling, bioenergetics and apoptosis. Recent study suggests that selective mitochondrial fusion can be mediated by heterotypic fusion between OPA1 and cardiolipin present on opposing membranes (Liu and Chan, 2017). Mitochondrial fusion allows the joining of healthy discrete mitochondria into the functional mitochondrial network thereby facilitating the isolation of dysfunctional and damaged mitochondria from the network.",

            "text": "Unnecessary or dysfunctional cellular components are removed by a self-destructive process known as autophagy. Autophagy is initiated by the formation of phagophore that engulfs the target cargo resulting in the formation of autophagosome, which subsequently fuses with the lysosome, eventually resulting in the delivery of the phagocytosed cargo to the lysosome (Fig. 1). Selective autophagy of mitochondria termed \u2018mitophagy\u2019 is one such process involved in rapid removal of dysfunctional or damaged mitochondria. Mitophagy is initiated by two distinct pathways; ubiquitin-dependent and independent pathways. (Georgakopoulos et al., 2017, Khaminets et al., 2016). Ubiquitin-dependent mitophagy is mediated by two major proteins; (1) the ubiquitin kinase PINK1 (PTEN-induced putative kinase 1), a mitochondrial serine/threonine protein kinase, which flags the damaged mitochondria and (2) Parkin, an E3 ligase, as a signal amplifier (Fig. 2\n) (Lazarou et al., 2015). In heathy mitochondria, cytosolic PINK1 containing a mitochondrial target sequence (MTS) translocates to the mitochondria and is imported rapidly to the IMM by the translocase of outer mitochondrial membrane (TOM) and translocase of inner mitochondrial membrane (TIM). Subsequently, PINK1 is degraded by downstream proteolytic events; involving excision of the MTS by mitochondrial processing protease (MPP), cleavage by presenilin-associated rhomboid-like protease (PARL), and final degradation (Jin and Youle, 2012). In the damaged mitochondria, the loss of membrane potential (\u0394\u03a8m) compromises TOM and TIM activity. This prevents the degradation of PINK1 and stabilizes PINK1 on the OMM of the damaged mitochondria (Meissner et al., 2011, Narendra et al., 2010). The stabilized PINK1 at the OMM recruits Parkin ubiquitin ligase, a signal amplifier, which gets activated by phosphorylation and ubiquitination. PINK1 phosphorylates the ubiquitin at Ser65 and the ubiquitin domain of Parkin to further activate Parkin ubiquitin ligase activity (Durcan and Fon, 2015, Kane et al., 2014, Kazlauskaite et al., 2014, Koyano et al., 2014, Narendra et al., 2008, Narendra et al., 2010, Vives-Bauza et al., 2010). In this way, PINK1 and Parkin cooperate to facilitate selective tagging of the damaged mitochondria with ubiquitin chains. This process can be negatively regulated by the deubiquitination mediated by the mitochondria localized deubiquitinase USP30 (Bingol et al., 2014) or by inhibiting PINK1/Parkin recruitment via PKA-mediated phosphorylation of MIC60 (Akabane et al., 2016). The damaged mitochondria tagged with ubiquitin chains are then engulfed by the phagophore resulting in formation of mitophagosome. Subsequently, the mitophagosome fuses with the lysosome to deliver the damaged mitochondria to the lysosome. The PINK-Parkin mediated mitophagy process is depicted in Fig. 2. Recently, Lazarou and Sliter et al. revealed that PINK1 can recruit the two primary mitophagy receptors (optineurin and NDP52), which then recruit other autophagy factors such as ULK1, DFCP1, and WIPI1 (Lazarou et al., 2015). Activated PINK1 is required for recruitment of optineurin (OPTN) and NDP52. Parkin is redundant for autophagy recruitment since autophagy receptors can be recruited in the absence of Parkin, however Parkin is required to increase the mitophagic flux. This suggests that phospho-ubiquitin generated by PINK1 serves as a unique signature for recruitment of the mitophagy receptor proteins and Parkin helps by building the ubiquitin chains for signal amplification (Lazarou et al., 2015). Parkin/PINK1 pathway also promotes TBK1 activation, which then subsequently primes the mitophagy receptors (OPTN, NDP52, and SQSTM1) (Heo et al., 2015, Matsumoto et al., 2015). Heo et al. showed that TBK1 phosphorylates OPTN at S473 and S513, which results in enhanced ubiquitin chain binding. The deubiquitinase USP15 widely expressed in brain and other organs antagonizes Parkin-mediated mitochondrial ubiquitination and mitophagy (Cornelissen et al., 2014).",

In case of most RNA viruses, the cytosolic pathogen recognition receptors (i.e., RIG-I and MDA5) recognize viral RNAs and undergo conformational change and oligomerization thereby transducing the signal to the downstream signaling partner MAVS, an antiviral adaptor protein tethered to the OMM and mitochondria-associated membranes (MAM). Activated MAVS then coordinates the assembly of multimeric signaling complex called MAVS signalosome by facilitating recruitment of other host proteins (e.g., TRAFs, TBK1, and IRFs). The MAVS signalosome generates a highly cooperative context dependent signal resulting in the biogenesis of interferons (IFNs). Some viruses [e.g., hepatitis C virus (HCV)] cleave the MAVS protein, thereby suppressing the host antiviral response, which represents one among many strategies exploited by the viruses to target mitochondria and evade host defense strategies (Horner and Gale, 2013).",

As autophagy rapidly clears the damaged cellular organelles, it generally blocks the induction of cell death. Hence, autophagy may play a central role in determining the cell fate during viral infection. Alternatively, viruses can modulate autophagy for their replication and to inhibit cell death as a consequence of virus-induced cellular stress. For example, Dengue and Zika viruses utilize autophagy to improve their replication and induction of autophagy by pharmacological agents (e.g. rapamycin) enhances viral dissemination (Datan et al., 2016, Liang et al., 2016). In case of Chikungunya virus, autophagy limits virus-induced cell death and in vivo mortality (Joubert et al., 2012). Accumulating evidences suggest that mitochondrial dynamics, mitophagy, and interaction with MAM can regulate MAVS signalosome formation (Khan et al., 2015). Further, there is a report suggesting that MAVS can regulate mitochondrial homeostasis via autophagy, suggesting the intricate interplay or feed-back loop to control mitochondria-mediated innate immunity (Sun et al., 2016).",

These two aspects are tightly regulated by many viruses to promote viral persistence. During hepatitis B virus (HBV) or HCV infections, these viruses modulate mitochondrial dynamics to promote mitochondrial fission and mitophagy, to keeping virus-induced mitochondrial injury in check. HBV/HCV induced mitochondrial dynamics also leads to attenuation of IFN signaling in which Parkin-MAVS interactions affects MAVS downstream signaling and the final IFN production, thus crippling innate immunity (Kim et al., 2013a, Kim et al., 2014, Kim et al., 2013b). Both HBV and HCV cause chronic infection and the persistence of the virus in the infected hepatocytes is a major reason underlying the chronic hepatic inflammation leading to the onset of liver disease (Kim et al., 2013a, Kim et al., 2014, Kim et al., 2013b).",

However, recent studies showed that selective mitophagy can affect both cytoprotective and pro-apoptotic conditions (Carroll et al., 2014, Zhang et al., 2014). This might be due to the fact that mitochondria regulates both pro- and anti-apoptotic proteins such as Bcl-2 family, Bax, and Bak (Tsujimoto, 1998). Hence, mitochondrial dynamics, particularly mitophagy, can serve as a major determinant of cell fate during viral infection. Due to the functional significance of mitophagy in viral infection, viruses may modulate mitophagy in distinct fashions independent of autophagy. For example, Dengue virus-induced autophagy inhibits apoptosis to enhance virus replication (Datan et al., 2016, Lee et al., 2008, McLean et al., 2011). On the other hand, Dengue inhibits mitochondrial fission causing mitophagy failure. This process is associated with antiviral immune evasion during Dengue infection (Barbier et al., 2017, Chatel-Chaix et al., 2016).",

Newcastle disease virus (NDV) and measles virus are among the few of the promising cancer-killing oncolytic viruses. NDV and measles virus induce autophagy along with mitophagy in the non-small cell lung cancer cells (NSCLCs) and exploit mitophagy to favor viral replication by blocking cytochrome c release-triggered apoptosis (Meng et al., 2014). Inhibition of autophagy and mitophagy by pharmacological inhibitors such as 3-methyladenine (3-MA) enhanced oncolysis in NDV-infected NSCLCs. Interestingly, the delayed administration of 3-MA induced more effective oncolysis, since the initiation of autophagy is required for efficient NDV replication. Hence, a delay in 3-MA treatment, which inhibits the initial stages of autophagy process, may result in efficient NDV propagation leading to robust oncolysis in NSCLCs (Meng et al., 2014). In contrast, measles virus does not promote cell death via apoptosis but via necrosis or other mechanisms and measles virus-induced oncolysis was abrogated in autophagy-impaired NSCLCs (Xia et al., 2014b). Since the modulation of autophagy in virus-infected cells differentially affects cell viability in virus-dependent manner, it is very important to understand the role of autophagy in the perspective of individual viruses and to adequately design strategies to maximize oncolytic effect. This understanding will help develop effective therapeutic strategies for virotherapy in combination with autophagy or mitophagy targeting strategies.",

Viral infection is associated with physiological stress and is highly likely that infection-associated stress can affect mitochondrial dynamics. However, some viruses can directly modulate mitochondrial dynamics and mitophagy via the viral proteins to regulate mitochondrial homeostasis and innate immune signaling. For example, the Dengue virus NS4B or NS3 proteins promote mitochondrial fusion by downregulating Drp1, thereby blocking mitochondrial fission (Barbier et al., 2017). Another study shows that Dengue virus NS4B induces elongation of mitochondria by inactivating Drp1. The resultant mitochondrial fusion compromises the integrity of MAMs, the sites of ER-mitochondria association, which are critical for innate immune signaling, thus inhibiting the RLR signaling and interferon production (Chatel-Chaix et al., 2016). In contrast, another study suggests that Dengue virus NS2B3 protease cleaves the MFNs, thereby suppressing mitochondrial fusion (Yu et al., 2015). Yu et al. revealed that MFN1 is required in antiviral RLR signaling pathway and the dominant-negative MFN1 mutant (MFN1T109A), which blocks mitochondrial fusion, attenuates the RLR signaling and enhances DENV infection (Yu et al., 2015).",

            "text": "Several neurodegenerative disorders are characterized by mitochondrial dysfunction (Johri and Beal, 2012). HIV-associated neurocognitive disorder (HAND) is a one of such neurodegenerative disorder caused by the infection of human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1) to the central nervous system (CNS), which leads to neurotoxic events and the loss of cognitive and motor functions. HAND patients account for approximately 50% of total HIV patients and 17\u201320% of HAND patients suffer from HIV encephalitis (HIVE), a neuro-inflammation disorder (Gannon et al., 2011). Recently, abnormal mitochondrial dynamics or mitochondrial dysfunction was identified in human brain samples of HIVE or HAND subjects. Altered mitochondrial proteins were associated with HIV-related neuropathology in the HIV-infected patient samples (Avdoshina et al., 2016, Fields et al., 2016). Similar pathologies were also found in mouse brains of HIV envelope glycoprotein gp120 transgenic mice as well as in primary rat neurons exposed to gp120, suggesting that gp120 is responsible for mitochondrial dysfunction (Avdoshina et al., 2016, Fields et al., 2016). HIV viral protein gp120 induces Mfn1 expression and reduces Drp1 expression, but not Nef or Tat. Since Drp1 mediates mitochondrial fission and Mfn1 promotes mitochondrial fusion, Gp120 shifts the delicate balance of mitochondrial dynamics towards mitochondrial fusion. Drp1 overexpression reduced neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration in the GFAP-gp120-tg mice, suggesting a possible strategy to prevent neurodegeneration in HIV patients by promoting mitochondrial fission (Fields et al., 2016). Another HIV protein, viral protein R (Vpr), is also reported to trigger mitochondrial dysfunction or damage leading to cell death (Huang et al., 2012). HIV-1 Vpr is an integral membrane protein that is localized in the MAM, ER, and OMM regions. HIV-1 Vpr forms vesicles in ER/MAM and transports to the OMM by membrane fusion. Vpr damages the OMM by triggering loss of membrane potential, with subsequent damage to mitochondria. Vpr also promotes Drp1 localization to nucleus from cytosol and proteasome-dependent degradation of Mfn2 by interaction with the CUL4 E3 ubiquitin ligase complex, affecting overall mitochondrial dynamics (Casey et al., 2010, Huang et al., 2012, Wen et al., 2007). In agreement, Drp1 and Mfn2 overexpression prevents Vpr-induced loss of mitochondrial membrane potential (\u0394\u03a8m) and apoptotic cell death. (Huang et al., 2012).",

PB1-F2 translocates into the IMM space, where it disrupts mitochondrial organization inducing cell death by interacting with mitochondrial proteins adenine nucleotide translocator 3 (ANT3), and voltage-dependent anion channel 1 (VDAC1) (Zamarin et al., 2005). While full-length PB1-F2 (PR8, 88 W, and 58 W strains) localizes to the mitochondria, the C-terminal truncated version of PB1-F2 (designated as 12S variant) from a major population of the low pathogenic subtype, is localized in the cytoplasm (Yoshizumi et al., 2014). C-terminal domain of PB1-F2 is responsible for the interaction with the ANT3, which mediates PB1-F2-induced loss of the mitochondrial membrane potential (Zamarin et al., 2005). Accumulation of full-length PB1-F2 protein causes loss of mitochondrial membrane potential (\u0394\u03a8m) leading to mitochondrial fragmentation. In contrast, 12S variant (C-terminal truncated form) does not alter mitochondrial membrane potential. The full-length PB1-F2-mediated attenuation of \u0394\u03a8m suppresses the RIG-I signaling pathway and activation of NLRP3 inflammasomes (Yoshizumi et al., 2014). These observations suggest an essential role of PB1-F2 in the virulence of influenza viruses via modulation of host mitochondrial dynamics.",

M mediates TUFM-dependent mitophagy and also serves as mitophagy receptor by interacting with LC3. Interaction of M and TUFM leads to inhibition of type I IFN response. It is further shown that the inhibition of type I IFN response is independent of Parkin/PINK1 and that M protein can induce mitophagy in Parkin-deficient HeLa cells (Lazarou et al., 2015).

            "text": "As mentioned earlier, antiviral response is predominantly mediated by RLR signaling during RNA virus infection. Viral RNAs or pathogen associated molecular patterns (PAMPS) are initially recognized by the helicase domain of RLRs. RLRs and MAVS have similar CARD domains, which facilitates their interaction and oligomerization via CARD-CARD interaction leading to the recruitment of effector proteins in the downstream signaling events (e.g., TRAFs, and TBK1) at mitochondria. The assembled MAVS signalosome activates the transcription factors such as IRF3 or IRF7 to trigger transcriptional induction of IFNs. As MAVS signalosome is mainly formed at the MAM and/or OMM, membrane structures are considered as critical factors (Horner and Gale, 2013). Recent studies, showed a clear link between mitochondrial dynamics and innate immunity (Castanier et al., 2010). For efficient antiviral responses, not only proteins that are associated with mitochondria are important but other features of mitochondria such as morphology, dynamics, and membrane potential also play a crucial role. Castanier et al. observed that Sendai virus promotes mitochondrial elongation during viral infection and the dsRNAs that mimic viral RNAs can activate RLR signaling and promote mitochondrial elongation. Modulation of host proteins regulating mitochondrial dynamics such as Drp1 and MFNs resulted in differential regulation of RLR signaling, indicating that mitochondrial elongation enhances, while mitochondrial fragmentation decreases RLR signaling (Castanier et al., 2010). This study suggests the tight association between RLR signaling and mitochondrial dynamics (Fig. 1). We also observed that the knockdown of genes promoting mitochondrial fission such as Drp1 enhances antiviral responses upon viral infection along with mitochondrial elongation (Castanier et al., 2010, Kim et al., 2014). In contrast, silencing Mfn1 and OPA1 expression results in mitochondrial fragmentation along with reduced antiviral responses upon viral infection (Castanier et al., 2010, Onoguchi et al., 2010). Castanier et al. also demonstrated that Mfn1 binds to MAVS and that the Mfn1/MAVS-mediated mitochondrial fusion promotes ER-mitochondria tethering facilitating MAVS-STING association (Castanier et al., 2010). Onoguchi et al. also revealed the important role of Mfn1-MAVS interaction in RLR signaling. They showed that RLR activation promotes MAVS distribution on the mitochondria forming speckle-like aggregates and that the knockdown of Mfn1 inhibited this speckle-like pattern abrogating RLR signaling. GTPase domain of Mfn1 is critical for interaction with MAVS since the dominant negative GTP-binding-deficient mutant of Mfn1 (Mfn1T109A) fails to activate RLR signaling (Onoguchi et al., 2010).",

However, the precise mechanism involved in MFNs-mediated regulation of RLR signaling still needs to be elucidated. Castanier et al. show that MAVS interact with Mfn1, but not with Drp1, OPA1, Fis1, and Mfn2 (Castanier et al., 2010). However, Onoguchi et al. suggests that MAVS interacts with Mfn2. In this study, Mfn2 silencing did not abrogate RLR signaling (Onoguchi et al., 2010). Interestingly, Yasukawa et al. reported that Mfn2 interacts with MAVS via HR1 not the GTPase domain to inhibit RLR signaling, which is in contrast to the effect of MAVS-Mfn1 interaction on RLR signaling (Yasukawa et al., 2009). More detailed studies are required to characterize the RLR signaling to explain the inconsistency found in these studies.",

            "text": "As mentioned earlier, some viruses (e.g., HBV, HCV, NDV, and measles viruses) shift the mitochondrial dynamics towards fission and mitophagy to favor viral replication (Kim et al., 2013a, Kim et al., 2014, Kim et al., 2013b, Meng et al., 2014). Given the role of mitochondria as a central hub of innate immune signaling, it is easy to speculate that virus-induced disruption of mitochondrial dynamics or mitophagy affects innate immunity. However, viruses can exploit the strategy of altering mitochondrial dynamics to deregulate host innate immune signaling. Also, virus exploits mitophagy to reduce the overall mitochondrial mass to reduce the levels of host machinery staging the antiviral response. In agreement with these scenarios, it has been found that knockdown of autophagy related genes (e.g., ATG7, BECN1, SQSTM1, and RAB7) significantly enhanced virus-induced antiviral immune response during measles virus infection (Xia et al., 2014a). Measles virus infection leads to colocalization of mitochondria with autophagosomes leading to a reduction in overall mitochondrial mass indicating mitochondrial degradation by mitophagy. Particularly, knockdown of SQSTM1 prevented measles virus-induced mitochondrial degradation, suggesting that SQSTM1 mediates measles virus-induced mitophagy contributing to the impaired RLR signaling (Xia et al., 2014a). Other viruses have also been shown to exploit this strategy of reducing the cellular mitochondrial mass to abrogate RLR signaling.",

            "text": "However, Khan et al. found that the inhibition of mitophagy does not affect ISRE activity in HBV expressing cells, suggesting that the effect of Parkin on RLR signaling is independent of its role in mitophagy. Khan et al. demonstrated that HBV-induced Parkin activation suppresses innate immunity via disruption of MAVS signalosome, but not by result of mitophagy. Parkin physically interacts with MAVS and modulates MAVS signaling by facilitating the accumulation of linear ubiquitin chain near the MAVS signalosome that results in the disruption of MAVS downstream signaling (Khan et al., 2016). MAVS also can be ubiquitinated by other E3 ligases such as MARCH5, TRIM25, RNF5, AIP4, RNF125, and TRIM31, and its ubiquitination play a critical role in innate immunity (Heaton et al., 2016, Liu et al., 2017, Yoo et al., 2015). Given that Parkin-dependent mitophagy is also associated with the ubiquitination of mitochondrial outer membrane proteins, ubiquitination might serve as a common factor linking mitophagy and innate immunity. Khan et al. provided a clue in the context (Khan et al., 2016). It is also noteworthy to mention that Parkin can be positively regulated by ISGylation, which is a covalent conjugation of ISG15, a negative regulator of type I interferons (Im et al., 2016). Furthermore, Sun et al. have suggested that MAVS can regulate mitochondrial homeostasis via autophagy (Sun et al., 2016). In short, these accumulating reports suggest a complex interplay between mitochondrial dynamics and MAVS signalosome to control mitochondria-mediated interferon biogenesis.",

EBV, a human herpesvirus 4 (HHV-4), is one of the most common viruses in humans and can cause various lymphoid and epithelial malignancies (Young and Rickinson, 2004). The viral latent membrane protein 2A (LMP2A) has been shown to increase the invasive ability and induce epithelial\u2013mesenchymal transition (EMT) in nasopharyngeal carcinoma. Pal et al. showed that LMP2A promoted mitochondrial fission with elevation of Drp1 level and that LMP2A-induced Drp1 elevation enhanced Notch-pathway-mediated cell migration and EMT (Pal et al., 2014). This suggests the important roles of altered mitochondrial dynamics by viruses in EMT and carcinogenesis. The role of mitochondrial dynamics in carcinogenesis or tumorigenesis during infection with other chronic or oncogenic viruses such as HBV, HCV, HIV, or KSHV is yet to be characterized.",

Activated PINK1 initiates selective tagging of damaged mitochondria by phosphorylation of both ubiquitin and Parkin. Activated Parkin builds up ubiquitin chains, which are, in turn, phosphorylated by PINK1 amplifying the signal. The damaged mitochondria tagged with the unique signature of phospho-ubiquitin via PINK1 and Parkin activities are identified by the mitophagy receptors, which interact with LC3.
