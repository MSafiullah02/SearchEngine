In 1991, another massive wave occurred, affecting 59,478 people with a CFR of 12.9%, predominantly in northern Nigeria. A review of the cholera cases observed from 1991 to the present suggests that cholera has become endemic in Nigeria. The major risk factors identified are poor access to a safe water supply, poor access to proper sanitation facilities and chronic malnutrition [2].",

They also noted that the lack of requisite resources and poorly trained medical personnel contributed to a poor emergency response. In a report of a cholera outbreak in Kenya in 2008, limited staffing of health facilities and a paucity of medical supplies were noted to be the major contributing factors to the high mortality observed during the outbreak [7]. However, different modes of training could be used if they are well tailored to the needs of the local population, as reported in diarrhea case management in Guatemala, in which distance learning and the tutoring model were used [8].",

However, despite the use of PPE, there were reported cases of cholera infection among health care workers involved in case management during the epidemic. This could be due to breakthrough infection at times when the health care workers were overwhelmed and did not use PPE or because of the non-availability or non-use of PPE. A similar occurrence was reported in Hong Kong, where the breakthrough transmission of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) occurred among many hospital workers despite infection control measures during the SARS outbreak in 2003 [10].",
