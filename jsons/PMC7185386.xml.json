Studies of HPIVs have focused primarily on HPIV-1 to -3, and detection methods include mainly cell culture and immunofluorescence. As the recovery rate of HPIV-4 in cell culture is inherently low and most clinical laboratories do not screen for HPIV-4,10, 11 the role of HPIV-4 in ARTIs is unclear and may be underestimated.",
