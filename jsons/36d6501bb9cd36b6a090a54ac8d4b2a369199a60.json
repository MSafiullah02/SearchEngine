In a survey of Canadian nurses (CIHI 2006) , 60% of the nurse respondents had been absent from work for health-related reasons in the year prior to the survey. Those who had been absent reported missing an average of 23.9 days of the year from work, and 14% of nurses reported being absent for 20 or more days. The Canadian Institute for Health Information (2007) found that high absenteeism in health care workers is a problem, noting that in 2006, the average health care worker between 25 and 54 years of age missed nearly 12 days of work as a result of illness or disability, in comparison to 7 days missed by persons employed in other sectors.",

Self-reporting of personal information relies on both a person\u00d5s ability to recall events and to report information accurately (Ross 1989) . Recall is often shaped by the need for self-preservation (Ross 1989) . People have a vested interest in the information they recall, as it has a direct impact on their feelings of self-esteem (Greenwald 1980) . They may choose to remember only those events that yield a favourable self-evaluation, and to disregard information that is viewed as less than socially acceptable (Greenwald 1980; Baumeister 1999) . The ability of a person to edit memory selectively -to recall positive information and disregard negative informationis a crucial step in the formation of a positive self-image (Greenwald 1980; Ross 1989) . People are much more efficient at recalling successes than failures (Greenwald 1980) . Furthermore, even on questionnaires, people may wish to present themselves positively to others. Absenteeism in the workplace is viewed as negative; therefore, nurses who wish to present themselves positively to others may underestimate their absenteeism.",

If nurses are unaware of the number of sick days they have taken that year, but believe this number is less than the average for their work group, it is possible that they may feel it is fair that they take an occasional additional day. If this is the case, feedback about actual absenteeism may be a low-key intervention that leads to reduced absence. Gaudine and Saks (2001) found a trend towards reduced absence in nurses after feedback, but did not measure nurses\u00d5 estimates of their absence and therefore were unable to determine the reason the feedback intervention worked.",

(2) How many days were you off the job in the last year for mental health (stress, burnout, etc.)? and (3) Excluding vacation and statutory holidays, and excused time (e.g., compassionate leave, educational leave, parental leave, union leave), how many total days were you off for personal and family business?

Similarly, Ferrie et al. (2005) found a Spearman\u00d5s rho correlation of 0.79 between self-reported absence and organizational records in their study of British civil servants. We also found a strong positive intra-class correlation for both the transformed and untransformed absence measures.

The fact that absenteeism from self-reports and organizational records are strongly correlated, and that intra-class correlations and Cronbach\u00d5s alphas for both absence measures are high, suggests that research may consider measuring absenteeism with self-reports rather than organizational records, which involves obtaining written consent from study participants and working with organizations to obtain the participants\u00d5 absence rate, a time-consuming and costly procedure for both researchers and organizations.",

For example, nurses may tend to think of their absence in terms of how many days they have taken in the past year, as well as how this compares with the absence rate of their colleagues. Based on employee underestimates of their absence and overestimates of their coworkers\u00d5 absence, Johns (1994a) suggested that providing absence information might lead to improved attendance. Several studies have looked at the impact of providing feedback to nurses about their absence and found a trend that suggests this lowers absenteeism (Gaudine & Saks 2001, A. Gaudine et al. unpublished data) . The intent of these feedback interventions was to base them on the realization that it is in no one\u00d5s best interest if nurses come to work when they are sick. In contrast to many absence interventions, the researchers did not want an intervention that would make nurses who already have low absenteeism to feel guilty about taking a day off, or that singled out persons with high absences, and thus could be viewed as a punitive intervention. It was felt that keeping all nurses informed of their absence in a neutral, non-punitive way might help them to self-monitor their behaviour and help improve attendance.",

Sending the letters quarterly instead of yearly would allow the employee/ employer to seek interventions to correct excessive sick time in a timely manner. Sending letters to all employees may reduce possible feelings of anxiety and guilt felt by employees who are singled out for excessive sick time use, and absenteeism feedback may be viewed in a more positive manner (Gaudine & Saks 2001) . It is a low-key absenteeism intervention, which is important in avoiding sickness presenteeism, a name coined by Aronsson et al. (2000) to identify the issue of attendance at work when sick. Given the current emphasis on pandemic planning and the need to contain infections such as the H1N1 virus or SARS virus, the need to address excessive absence without causing presenteeism is particularly important. Further research is needed regarding the effectiveness of absence interventions based on feedback about absence, together with investigation of how nurses feel about these interventions.",

Also, the findings may not be generalizable because the participants were volunteers and because those who were off work because of illness were not available to volunteer. The reasons for underestimating absence were not examined. This is an interesting area for future research.",
