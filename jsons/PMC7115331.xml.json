Interestingly, 0.5% sodium hypochlorite alone failed due to recovery of infectious viral particles in 1 of the lots. This result may have been due to factors such as inconsistencies in spray application and coverage between lots. Given the design of this study, in which a plate of dried virus film was sprayed with the disinfectant, it is possible that the surface coverage-improving properties of the color additive contributed to improved efficacy compared to 0.5% sodium hypochlorite alone, which tends to bead up and form droplets when sprayed.33 A recent study demonstrated that typical bleach disinfectants cover <33% of a sprayed surface and lose coverage over the duration of the contact time, whereas the addition of color additive improved bleach surface coverage to >99.9% and maintained this level of coverage for 15 minutes.4 When used in real-world settings, this color additive may maximize the efficacy of bleach disinfectants due to superior spray coverage.",
