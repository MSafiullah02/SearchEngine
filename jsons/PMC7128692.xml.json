            "text": "Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), started in Wuhan since December 2019 but has now spread throughout different provinces in China, and has since been declared a Public Health Emergency of International Concern by the World Health Organization (WHO) on 30th January 2020 [[1], [2], [3]]. Hong Kong, in close vicinity with China and ruthlessly affected by the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) 17 years ago, started preparation for COVID-19 on 31st December 2019, when an alert of clustered pneumonia of unknown origin was announced by the Wuhan Municipal Health Commission [4]. The first imported case of COVID-19 in Hong Kong was reported on 23rd January 2020, and the first local case (with no known travel history or travel-related contact history) was reported on 31st January 2020. The WHO currently recommended droplet and contact precautions for patients with suspected or known COVID-19, while applying airborne precautions when performing aerosol-generating procedures (AGPs) [5]. While the Australian Government has adopted the WHO recommendations [6], the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Public Health England and the Hong Kong Hospital Authority (HA), the statutory body responsible for managing Hong Kong\u2019s public hospital service, recommended contact and airborne precautions for patients with suspected or known COVID-19, including placement in an airborne infection isolation room (AIIR) [[7], [8], [9]]. The potential risk of nosocomial transmission of SARS-CoV-2 has posed great stress and anxiety to healthcare workers, a shadow cast by the SARS epidemic in 2003 [10,11]. For COVID-19, current reports from China reveal an attack rate of 2.09\u201329% among healthcare workers [3,12,13] Although the major routes of transmission of SARS-CoV-2 is believed to be droplet and contact, some healthcare workers remained extremely mindful of the potential \u2018super-spreading events\u2019 due to opportunistic airborne transmission through various healthcare-related activities [11,14]. While opening suction of respiratory tract, intubation, bronchoscopy, and cardiopulmonary resuscitation were well accepted as AGPs [5], the extent of infectious aerosols generated by the use of nebulizers, high-flow oxygen (especially through venturi-type masks) and non-invasive positive pressure ventilations were more controversial [15,16]. These activities were avoided during the SARS epidemic in view of the potential risks [15], but a subsequent systematic review found no statistically significant increase in SARS transmission risk with therapeutic activities such as suction before or after intubation, nebulizer treatment, oxygen mask manipulation or chest compression [16]. Here, we report the outbreak investigation and outcome of 49 patients and 71 healthcare workers exposed to a patient with severe pneumonia due to SARS-CoV-2 in a general ward setting before the diagnosis was made.",

Patients who shared the same cubicle with the index case were considered as \u2018patient close contact\u2019. Staff close contacts were subjected to a 14-day work exclusion and quarantined at a designated camp site, followed by medical surveillance for another 14 days. Patient close contacts were quarantined into an AIIR (or quarantine camp if the patient was deemed clinically stable to be discharged from hospital) for 14 days, followed by medical surveillance for 14 days. Other staff and patient contacts (\u2018casual contacts\u2019) were subjected to medical surveillance for 28 days with no restriction to work or discharge from hospital.

All specimens were preserved in viral transport medium before further processing. Total nucleic acid extraction was performed using MagNA Pure LC 2.0 (Roche, Switzerland) (from 3rd to 5th February 2020) or MagNA Pure 96 (Roche, Switzerland)(from 6th February 2020), and the RT-PCR was performed using LightMix\u00ae Modular SARS and Wuhan CoV E-gene, EAV RNA extract control (TIB-MOLBIOL, Berlin, Germany), and the LightCycle\u00ae Multiplex RNA Virus Master (Roche Diagnostics, Mannheim, Germany) on cobas z 480 real-time PCR analyser (Roche Diagnostics, Mannheim, Germany) according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions.

She developed flu-like symptoms on 24th January 2020 with transient improvement after taking antibiotics and symptomatic treatment prescribed by a general practitioner. However, her fever relapsed on 30th January 2020 with productive cough and dyspnea. She had no history of travel in the preceding month, but she owned a fashion boutique with many mainland Chinese customers owing to its proximity to the West Kowloon high-speed rail station. On admission, she had a fever of 39.6\u00b0C with sinus tachycardia of 126 bpm and blood pressure of 198/92 mmHg. She was tachypnoeic with oxygen saturation of 80% in room air. Bilateral crepitations were heard on auscultation and chest X-ray revealed multi-lobar pulmonary infiltrates (Figure 2\n(a)). In the absence of history of travel to China or contact with a confirmed COVID-19 patient, she was admitted to ward A in an open cubicle under standard precautions for community-acquired pneumonia (6 ACH, normal pressure setting) at 01:22 h on 2nd February 2020. She could not wear a surgical mask as she was on oxygen therapy through a simple facemask (Soundway\u00ae, Ningbo Shengyurui Medical Appliances Co. Ltd, Ningbo, China; Figure 2(b)). She also had frequent coughs while residing in the ward. She became more hypoxic around 18:00 h and required an increase in oxygen therapy to 8 L/min, delivered through the same facemask. On 3rd February 2020, she was transferred to an AIIR at 12:35 h and was electively intubated at 13:00 h for progressive respiratory failure. Nasopharyngeal swab for multiplex PCR FilmArray\u00ae RP2 panel (Biofire Diagnostics, bioM\u00e9rieux, Marcy-l\u2019\u00c9toile, France), urine for BinaxNOW Legionella and pneumococcal antigen (Abbott, IL, USA) were negative.

            "text": "More than 100,000 cases of COVID-19 have been reported worldwide at the time of writing, after just over 2 months after the identification of this novel coronavirus [17,18]. While it is believed that person-to-person spread of SARS-CoV-2 occurs predominantly through droplet and contact transmissions, the actual dynamics remained uncertain. The reproduction number of SARS-CoV-2 appears to be higher than SARS, with an initial estimation of 1.4\u20136.49, and median of 2.79 [[19], [20], [21]]. The high attack rates among household contacts [[22], [23], [24]], and passengers on the Diamond Princess Cruise are most concerning [25]. In the described scenario, our patient coughed frequently and a high viral load (as implicated by the low Ct-value) detected from her respiratory specimens; moreover, she could not put on a surgical mask during her stay in the general medical ward. All these factors could have contributed to a great deal of droplet generation from our index patient, with secondary contamination of her surroundings. Moreover, she received oxygen therapy at 8 L/min through a simple oxygen facemask for a significant amount of time. Oxygen therapy with flow of \u22656 L/min was considered an AGP in the HA hospitals. Despite the aforementioned, none of the neighbouring patients or staff contacts were infected. While there is no consensus on what constitutes \u2018close\u2019 and \u2018casual\u2019 contacts, our risk assessment approach was similar to the subsequent published guidance for contact tracing [6,[26], [27], [28], [29]] (Table 2\n). The authors believe that the universal mask wearing of staff, patients and visitors as a component of the Emergency Response in HA hospitals, as well as the heightened alertness to hand hygiene and environmental cleanliness have played a major part in halting further transmissions in this incident. In fact, frequent hand hygiene and appropriate use of surgical masks have previously been shown to be a protective factor against SARS, and influenza [[30], [31], [32], [33]]. In the Shenzhen family cluster of COVID-19, the uninfected family member was the only person reported to have consistent use of surgical masks [22]. Also, the lack of secondary transmission in our experience may imply that oxygen therapy \u22656 L/min with a simple facemask poses a low risk of aerosol generation, consistent with the finding from a previous study [34]. Another local study on aerosol dispersion in various respiratory therapies demonstrated that the air leak through the side vents of the simple oxygen facemask during delivery of oxygen for 6, 8, 10 L/min were limited to 0.22, 0.3 and 0.4 m [35], respectively, hence the neighbouring patients who should be at least 1 m from the index patient were not at increased risk of droplet transmission despite the use of high-flow oxygen.",

However, the detailed description of contact tracing including nature of exposure and PPE worn involving 120 contacts may still be a useful observation of transmission dynamics in a normal ward environment, because the majority of the subsequent patients were admitted directly into AIIR. Secondly, we only tested contacts with fever or respiratory symptoms with RT-PCR, hence the possibility of asymptomatic infection among the staff close contacts can not be entirely excluded. None the less, all 10 close patient contacts, who had stayed in the same cubicle as the index patient for >20 h had multiple negative SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR performed up to days 13 and 14 from the last exposure. Thirdly, quantitative RT-PCR and viral culture were not available at our centre, thus the exact viral load and the viability of the virus can not be ascertained.",
