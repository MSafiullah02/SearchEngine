Methods: We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of the evidence relating influenza and influenza-like symptoms to the risks of MI, HF and stroke. We systematically searched all MEDLINE and EMBASE entries up to August 2014 for studies of influenza vs. the cardiovascular outcomes above. We conducted random effects meta-analysis using inverse variance method for pooled odds ratios (OR) and evaluated statistical heterogeneity using the I 2 statistic. Results: We identified 12 studies with a total of 84,003 participants. The pooled OR for risk of MI vs. influenza (serologically confirmed) was 1.27 (95% CI, confidence interval 0.54-2.95), I 2 = 47%, which was significant for the only study that adjusted for confounders (OR 5.50, 95% CI 1.31-23.13). The pooled OR for risk of MI vs. influenza-like symptoms was 2.17 (95% CI 1.68-2.80), I 2 = 0%, which was significant for both unadjusted (OR 2.23, 95% CI 1.65-3.01, five studies) and adjusted studies (OR 2.01, 95% CI 1.24-3.27, two studies). We found one study that evaluated stroke risk, one study in patients with HF, and one that evaluated mortality from MIall of these studies suggested increased risks of events with influenza-like symptoms. Conclusions: There is an association between influenzalike illness and cardiovascular events, but the relationship is less clear with serologically diagnosed influenza. We recommend renewed efforts to apply current clinical guidelines and maximise the uptake of annual influenza immunisation among patients with cardiovascular diseases, to decrease their risks of MI and stroke.",

The spreadsheet data were then checked for completeness and accuracy by a senior reviewer (YKL). Two reviewers (CSK and SU) then independently extracted the number of events and denominators from the sources papers, thereby enabling calculations of crude (unadjusted) estimates of the risk of adverse events among patients with influenza. Where raw results were not available, we collected results that were the most adjusted risk estimates [adjusted relative risk, odds ratio (OR), or hazard ratios] for cardiovascular events with influenza.

We assumed asymptotic convergence of risk ratio and OR as the proportion of adverse outcomes was low (16) . We evaluated both adjusted and unadjusted data from primary studies, although we preferentially used adjusted data where available. We stratified the main analysis based on the measures of ascertaining influenza (e.g. laboratory serology tests or based on clinical presentation suggesting influenza-like illness) and use of adjustments to account for potential confounders. If different types of influenza were reported, we used the category with the largest number of patients.",

The risk of MI with serologically defined influenza is less evident, however, the only study that adjusted for potential confounders showed an increased risk of MI with positive influenza tests. In addition, there is limited evidence that flu-like illness precipitates both stroke and HF events, although these observations are based on just single publications, thus warranting further study. A major challenge of studies which associate flulike symptoms and CVD is the spectrum of viral infections that can initiate flu-like symptoms. A review of influenza-like illness suggests that respiratory syncytial virus, rhinovirus, adenovirus, parainfluenza viruses and human coronaviruses can present similar to influenza (30) . A study of influenza-like illnesses over successive winters in the UK found that 480 of 2226 swabs (21.6%) were positive for respiratory syncytial virus (31) . A smaller study in Scotland found that picornavirus was also an important cause of influenza-like illness (32) . Other studies have also identified rhinovirus (33), adenovirus (33), human corona virus (33) and parainfluenza virus (34) as important causes of influenza-like illness.",

We have observed that influenza-like illness defined by clinical features, which may be caused by both influenza and other viral infections such as those highlighted above are associated with an increased risk of MI. This association appears to be absent in influenza cases defined by serology. There are a number of possible explanations that might account for this. The clinical features of influenza may be secondary to other viral infections so using clinical features may include other non-influenza infections. Participants in whom influenza was diagnosed by serology may represent a different biological cohort than those patients in whom influenza diagnosis is based on clinical features. This may be because participants identified from serology may be asymptomatic, have atypical or milder symptoms because of infection with less virulent genotypes of influenza virus while participants who are diagnosed with influenza on clinical grounds might have more severe influenza infections which could manifest cardiovascular complications. Inclusion of asymptomatic cases may lead to a cohort with fewer cardiovascular events and reduced likelihood of detecting differences when compared with control group. Second, the timing of the serology test is important to determine if it is associated with cardiovascular event. Serology tests are able to measure the antibodies that develop in response to influenza virus but this response develops within 2-3 weeks of infection (35) (36) (37) . Once developed, antibodies remain at detectable levels for months (38) , thus making the test reliable in confirming influenza infection exposure. Consequently, if serological testing took place in the acute phase infection, the test result may represent a false negative. The quality of the serology test for influenza may also present a problem as high quality and standardised methods should be used to minimise variability in results. It is notable that two of the studies of serology took place in 1977 and 1981 and it is unclear, if the laboratory tests are as reliable and robust as those having been conducted more recently. Serological tests may detect cross-reactive antibodies generated by previous exposure to antigenically similar viruses leading to false positive results. The current gold standard for laboratory confirmation of influenza virus infection is reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction or viral culture although this methodology was not used in studies included in the current analysis. It is notable that there are differences between influenza and influenza-like illness. True influenza, which is confirmed by serology, will not include other flu-like mimics unless there is dual infection. However, serologically defined influenza infection will also include asymptomatic cases that may not be clinically relevant and may be missed unless a study defines a cohort and tests all participants regardless of whether they are symptomatic. Influenza-like illness on the other hand may include other viral illnesses as previously described. This population will represent the clinically relevant cohort and may be larger than the true influenza cohort. However, it may be more heterogeneous in clinical features than the influenza cohort because it may include infections with other viruses. The ideal study should actually consider both in parallel. This can be conducted by taking a defined population and testing all participants for influenza and then prospectively collect data on whether participants develop symptoms of influenza. This study will allow understanding of the specificity of the influenza-like illness that is unclear.",

            "text": "While we found some evidence to support the role of influenza-like illnesses as a trigger for cardiovascular events the precise mechanism is unclear. It has been suggested that influenza and influenza-like illnesses may increase the risk of acute MI by mechanisms such as: antigenic cross-reactivity; increased proinflammatory and pro-thrombotic cytokines; loss of anti-inflammatory properties of HDL particles; increased trafficking of macrophages into the arterial wall; pronounced expression of inflammatory cytokines by infected monocytes; reduced clotting times and induction of pro-coagulant activity by infected endothelial cells and increased expression of tissue factor (18) . Coagulopathy and inflammation are thought to be key factors (39) . Inflammation is also an important part of the atherosclerotic process and inflammatory cytokines such as TNF-a and IL-6 are increased in the context of studies of influenza in mice (40) . Repeated influenza infection may injure the vascular endothelial cells and initiate the inflammatory response that is required to accelerate and enhance atherosclerosis development (18) . Furthermore, viral infections can trigger the production of inflammatory cytokines, which could destabilise existing vulnerable plaques leading to MI (41) . It is worth noting that included studies were of high risk of bias because of their retrospective nature and study designs, which were case-control or case cross-over. In addition, bias may arise from the variation in the way influenza was diagnosed which ranged from symptoms associated with respiratory infection to diagnoses based on serology tests. The most reliable diagnostic methodology is laboratory serological tests, as other chest infections or atypical respiratory infections may have clinical features consistent with influenza infection. However, even when serological tests were used to ascertain influenza infection, it is possible that patients who did not have serology positive influenza did not have flu and this may account for the dissimilarity between the two large cohorts evaluating public health records and the remaining studies. Furthermore, adjustments for potential confounders are important to reduce risk of bias. Only a limited number of studies in the current review adjusted for baseline variables and there is always the risk of unmeasured confounders.",

Another limitation relates to the inclusion of older studies that used different diagnostic criteria for MI. The diagnostic criteria for MI in older studies were based mainly on clinical criteria, echocardiography, electrocardiographical changes and possible enzyme rises of creatinine kinase that are not as sensitive as high sensitivity troponin assays used in contemporary practice to detect myonecrosis, which may have resulted in underreporting of incident MI in older studies Further studies should be conducted to evaluate the risk of CVD with influenza. These observational studies should be prospective in design with outcomes linked to a CVD register. Once potential cases of influenza are identified, further laboratory tests should be performed to confirm diagnosis of influenza. In addition, important potential confounders such as smoking, socioeconomic status, underlying chronic respiratory disease and other cardiovascular risk factors need to be accounted for in risk-adjusted models.",
