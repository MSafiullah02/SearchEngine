No longer is the medical community looking at the diagnosis of RS as solely an infectious process but rather as complex and multifactorial.152 For example, Palmer41 elegantly describes this transition whereby \"generations of doctors and scientists were taught to envision bacteria as single cells that float or swim through some fluid ... in fact, rhinologists continue to foster this view\"; however, \"biofilms are not just single cells, but are structurally and metabolically heterogeneous multicellular communities.\"153 Biofilms demonstrate cell-to-cell signaling, a phenomenon known as \"quorum sensing.\"154 Such is an example of complexity science and holism.",
