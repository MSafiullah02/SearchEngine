Individuals and the communities to which they belong have different capacities for anticipating, responding, and adjusting to change as it occurs. These differences and similarities in exposure, sensitivity, and capacity define the scope of vulnerability to social and environmental change. Vulnerability is, therefore, the state of susceptibility to harm from exposure to stresses associated with environmental and other changes, and from absence of the capacity to adapt. Typically, such vulnerabilities within social and ecological systems are assessed in relation to specific populations and places (Cutter et al. 2003; Adger 2006) . Nevertheless, placebased vulnerability is also the product of processes occurring at multiple spatial and temporal scales.",

The dominant view in this area is that global economic integration, as a large-scale, structural process, has important and primarily negative environmental consequences for particular places. Furthermore, economic integration within the world economy is a major driver of change, with consequences observed in local economies and ecological systems.",

We illustrate these linkages through the examples of the global transmission of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and the interdependent vulnerabilities and adaptations of coffee farmers in Vietnam and Mexico. These cases demonstrate that the vulnerability of specific individuals and communities is not geographically bounded but, rather, is connected at different scales, so that the drivers of their exposure and sensitivity are inseparable from large-scale processes of sociocultural change and market integration. Aggregate outcomes of government policies, trends in global commodity markets, and even decisions by individuals to improve livelihood security can have negative repercussions, not only locally, through transformations of ecological systems and social relations, but also at larger scales.

Specific actors or political entities operating from a relatively narrow base may have global influence (so-called \"spatial stretching\"). Increas-ing connectedness enhances the speed of information flow across space and time, and has the effect of reducing social, cultural, and ecological diversity.

Local drivers of vulnerability are also interdependent with processes manifest at higher scales as ecological conditions reach critical thresholds, and vice versa (O'Neill and King 1998; Polsky and Easterling 2003; Cash et al. 2006) . We also argue that vulnerabilities of local systems, peoples, and places are networked, or \"teleconnected\", in their social and economic implications (cf Chen 1994). By framing vulnerability in terms of nested relationships, we emphasize not only the synergistic and interdependent nature of social-ecological relationships at different scales, but also illustrate how the forces of globalization are making such interdependencies critical determinants of local vulnerability.",

For example, there are real and increasingly recognized thresholds in the impacts of climate change, characterized as non-linear changes in ecosystems and physical systems and brought about through flips in ecosystem function and process, often exacerbated by feedbacks at global and local scales (eg Scheffer et al. 2006) . Physical and biological interdependencies are, we would suggest, better known and understood than those in the social realm.

The integration of global markets becomes the structure for teleconnected vulnerabilities at different levels and spatial scales, and thus also introduces new instabilities into social change. The evolving structure of global commodity chains and the movement toward greater global market integration has exacerbated the disparity between rich and poor, both within and between countries. This growing inequality and persistent poverty has profound consequences for natural resource use, conservation, and the prospects for sustainable development. It is increasingly argued that divergence in development paths among world regions has negative consequences for economic growth, human security, and environmental welfare at global scales (Sachs 2005) . While it is widely recognized that commodity and financial markets serve as a structure for transferring risks and that these risks often fall on poorer regions, we argue here that the nested relationships of vulnerability mean that levels of sensitivity and capacities to cope with shock are influenced by feed-backs between local and global parts of systems.",

Population movements to agricultural frontiers in Amazonia, Africa, and Asia have had negative implications for forests, biodiversity, and soils and, over the long term, have increased the sensitivity of frontier populations to environmental shocks, such as fire and drought. Rapid urbanization throughout the developing world over the past several decades has increased the capacity of individuals to manage and avoid environmental risks associated with fire, pollution, earthquakes, and other hazards. Yet the same processes simultaneously decrease the collective capacity of urban social-ecological systems to manage shocks and disturbance. In southern Africa, for example, migrants become vectors of HIV/AIDS, creating geographic corridors of increased sensitivity to other stressors, such as drought, and decreased capacity to manage such shocks (Leichenko and O'Brien 2008) . Informal settlements of migrant populations are often the most susceptible to impacts from hurricanes, landslides, and earthquakes (Mitchell 1999) .",

In part of a substantial economic liberalization, Mexico's coffee parastatal (a corporation with full or partial government ownership) was dismantled, state-owned coffee processing plants were sold to cooperatives or the private sector, and coffee prices and inputs were deregulated. As a result, coffee production in Mexico stag- Year Coffee Cocoa Palm oil Rubber nated in the 1990s, and out-migration from coffee-growing regions increased. The coffee-producing state of Veracruz, for example, experienced a net population loss, due to migration, of nearly 59 000 in 2004 (equivalent to 8 migrants per 1000 people), up from 40 000 in 1990, an increase driven in part by the coffee crisis ( Figure 5 ). The concurrent gains in the livelihood security of Vietnamese farmers as they expanded production cascaded up through the commodity chain to exert subsequent downward pressure on global prices, decreasing the livelihood security of Mexican farmers. A case study of producers in central Veracruz found that over 80% of coffee growers in two communities surveyed in the region reported declining incomes and difficulty in purchasing basic goods as a result of the crisis . This resulted in substantial abandonment of coffee crops at the height of the crisis (Figure 6 ). Mexican producers were also affected by adverse weather events in 1989, 1997, and 1998 ; the widespread frost in 1989, for example, reportedly damaged 10% of the coffee harvest in the country and caused out-migration of labor from central Mexico.",

However, as a result of rapid land conversion, the province is affected by declining environmental health in the form of forest loss, soil erosion, loss of biodiversity, and the implications of these for food security, exacerbating widespread economic insecurity for the majority of farmers (DiGregorio et al. 2003) .

As a set of nested vulnerabilities, the driving forces in the exposure of farmers in Vietnam and Mexico are similar, yet the local responses and instabilities that have resulted are different. Whereas inmigration and income diversification have driven the Vietnamese coffee boom, in Mexico, out-migration from the coffee regions, as a result of the coffee price slump, has decreased the livelihood flexibility of the farm households that remain. While the aggressive expansion of coffee in Vietnam is generating erosion and deforestation, the abandonment of coffee in Mexico may, in the short term, lead to forest regeneration or, in the long term, to the expansion of less ecologically desirable land uses, such as sugarcane and pasture (Hausermann and Eakin 2008) .",

The increasingly consolidated structure of global markets creates circumstances of nested vulnerability, in which shocks at the global scale cascade down to affect local livelihoods and welfare. However, our examples also illustrate the reverse process: as ongoing development pressures and environmental stress move social-ecological systems nearer to thresholds of critical change, the response of even small communities to economic shocks or to new opportunities may trigger vulnerabilities elsewhere. We argue that vulnerability therefore needs to be recognized as a phenomenon which is interdependent and teleconnected. Thus, it is possible, and indeed necessary, to compare vulnerabilities in different parts of the world, in terms of common drivers and outcomes. Wildlife traders and hunters in China and Vietnam, in securing their own livelihoods, may be creating vulnerabilities to disease elsewhere in the region. Economic incentives for coffee expansion in Vietnam lead to deforestation, thereby increasing vulnerability to environmental degradation locally, while contributing to livelihood insecurity in rural Mexico.",

It is increasingly clear that while local vulnerability assessments are essential, understanding interrelated vulnerabilities in different localities will be an important task of future research. The role of population mobility in both increasing exposure to and altering the capacity of economies to diversify forms of risk is poorly understood. Traditional nomadic populations have always employed strategies that spread risks geographically, and such strategies are common in rural-urban cyclical migration (Adger et al. 2002; Thornton et al. 2007) . But changing risks of drought or storm impact associated with climate change, for example, have much greater spatial extent, so that traditional strategies may no longer be effective. Similarly, technological change is driving specific ecological vulnerabilities. Berkes et al. (2006) demonstrate that the globalization of fisheries has decreased the resilience of marine ecosystems: exploitation of sea urchins and herbivorous reef fish species in the past three decades, in particular, makes reefs more vulnerable to recurrent disturbances such as hurricanes, and to coral bleaching and mortality due to increased sea surface temperatures.",
