However, the basic research on cardiovascular disease was still limited [1, 2] . In-depth basic research could provide a guiding direction for new methods in treating cardiovascular diseases [3] . Therefore, exploring the molecular and cellular mechanisms in the pathogenesis of cardiovascular disease could help us understand the disease process, discover new biomarkers, and find new therapeutic targets [4, 5] . Over the past decade, the development of high-throughput sequencing technologies given us an opportunity to expand our understanding of human transcriptomes [6, 7] . Previous studies have suggested that proteins are the main regulators of cardiovascular disease [8, 9] . However, with the understanding of the complexity human transcriptomes, it was revealed that most human genomes can transcribe RNA, of which more than 98% were untranslated proteins [10] . The number of non-coding RNAs was far exceeds the amount of mRNA encoding proteins [11, 12] . Although the expression level of ncRNAs were generally low and did not encode proteins, they could show strong tissue specificity and express abnormalities in various human diseases and biological processes such as organ development, internal and external environmental stimulation and disease occurrence [13, 14, 15] . So far, more and more studies have shown the important regulatory functions of ncRNAs in participate in biosynthetic steps such as transcription [16] , RNA maturation [17] , translation [18] , protein degradation [19] , and found ncRNAs play an important role in pathological processes such as tumors and cardiovascular diseases [20] . Based on their size, these non-coding RNAs were classified into microRNAs (miRNAs, <200 nucleotides), and long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs, >200 nucleotides), in which lncRNAs can also exhibit a circular shape called circular RNAs (circRNAs).

The precursor of the miRNA first existed in the nucleus. Then after the transcription and subsequently matured by several enzymatic reactions, mRNAs transferred to the cytoplasm to exert their biological functions. miRNAs exerted their regulatory functions by recruiting specific silencing proteins to form an RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC). It was speculated that about 60% of mRNA will be target by miRNA, while a miRNA may target more than 100 mRNAs in human. Specific miRNAs have significantly different expression levels in cardiac tissue and cardiovascular, and played as regulators of cardiovascular function, including cardiovascular cell differentiation, growth, proliferation and apoptosis, angiogenesis and cell contractility regulation. Meanwhile, the pathological changes in the cardiovascular system always accompanied with some specific miRNAs changes. These miRNAs changes have been confirmed to be associated with cardiovascular diseases such as arrhythmia, cardiac hypertrophy, fibrosis, myocardial infarction and heart failure. Recent studies indicated that miRNAs with specific changes in the progression of heart valve disease play key role in the processes of disease progression, such as fibrosis, calcification, matrix degradation remodeling, and inflammation. In addition, some miRNAs could also regulate extracellular body through exosomes and participate in circulation in the exocrine [21] [22] [23] .

What's more, they identified many circRNAs only in CSCD, which contained many different samples including cancer samples. This database also contained the prediction of the microRNA response element sites and RNA binding protein sites for each cir-cRNA, which could be better used for the researchers to understand the functional effects of circRNAs.

They provided many aspects of cir-cRNAs on their circRNA Atlas web server, including their expression patterns, genomic features, conservations and functional annotations. This database was available at http://circatlas. biols.ac.cn/. Researchers could browse, visualize and prioritize the circRNAs they need and get the related information from this database. This database enlarged our knowledge of circRNAs by exploring the landscape of circRNAs in human, macaque and mouse, elucidating their diversities in various tissues. The developers also invented a new method to prioritize disease related cir-cRNAs, which ranked the circRNAs by considering both circAtlas networks and circRNA conservation. As a starting point to investigate the biological importance of circRNAs, cireAtlas will provide a powerful foundation for circRNA studies, and help the circRNA community to annotate and prioritize circRNAs.

In addition, the biological function of the currently known ncRNA was only the tip of the iceberg, and there were still many unknown functions needed to be perfected.
