In addition to the functions recommended by the IOM and the NHF, the Office of Blood Product Safety (OBPS) could collect and review reports received by the FDA regarding the safety and availability of blood and blood products. The OBPS would assess the appropriateness of public dissemination of these reports; if they were deemed relevant to the health and welfare of our citizens, then OBPS personnel would interpret and translate them into lay language. This material would be posted on a CBER website specifically designed for communicating important issues to the public. Paper copies of the material would be made available for persons without computer access, and the information would also be sent to nonprofit groups such as the NHF and the American Thrombosis and Hemostasis Network. These organizations have registries of people with bleeding disorders; therefore, they could be instrumental in ensuring that the information is distributed to these individuals. This method of disseminating information about product safety would replace the current piecemeal notification systems used by the NHF and other consumer organizations.\n",

As noted, these concentrates are vital for the well-being of persons with bleeding disorders, which is why they maintain a supply of these products in their home or office. However, there are times when hemophiliacs have hemorrhages while traveling for business or pleasure. A visit to the nearest emergency department often brings the unwelcome news that the facility does not stock clotting factor concentrates. Surprisingly, even trauma centers designated level I (most capabilities) might not have coagulation products. Such facilities must either call a distribution center and request immediate delivery of the concentrate or transfer the bleeding patient to a treatment center that has the appropriate material. The lack of immediate accessibility to clotting factor creates delays in the provision of care, and the bleeding that continues unabated exacerbates the damage in whatever organ has been the site of the hemorrhage, be it the brain, joint, or other tissue. The OBPS might mandate that adequate supplies of clotting factor concentrate must be physically present in all level I trauma centers and other facilities that serve communities where persons with hemophilia and other bleeding disorders reside.",

There is no marketplace or competition to determine the cost of many such drugs; their price is set by the manufacturers and health insurers. For the manufacturers, the considerations used to determine prices are return on investment and willingness of third parties (insurance, government) to accept the costs of the drugs (in other words, what the market will bear). Health insurers can assign some drugs, such as those used to treat HIV infection, to the highest payment tier for midlevel plans, requiring patients to contribute 40% of the cost of the drug [16]. Sick individuals are compelled to assume a heavy monetary burden at a time when their income is often substantially decreased by illness. There are few remedies for patients when insurance companies charge hefty premiums for vital medications. In addition, our government does not negotiate price with pharmaceutical companies; if fact, such negotiations were barred by Congress when Part D Medicare was enacted. As noted by Elizabeth Rosenthal, \u201cwe approve drugs and devices without considering cost-effectiveness, or even having a clue about price. We don\u2019t ask for estimates and then are surprised when the nation is stuck with a $2.7 trillion annual health care bill\u201d [17].",

It would adopt methods for assessing cost-effectiveness that are somewhat similar to those used by the NICE Institute, and it would negotiate prices with the manufacturers based on the safety and effectiveness of their products. It could recommend that Medicare refuse payment if prices were not commensurate with the estimated value of the therapy. In that circumstance, COPP would recommend the next best alternatives. With regard to blood and blood components, it seems likely that the price of these essential substances will substantially increase in the future as methods are introduced to sterilize the final product. For example, two firms are developing a set of chemical compounds that will inactivate microbes contaminating blood [18]. Although these innovations should greatly enhance the safety of transfusion, the final blood product will undoubtedly be more expensive. We need an agency that will provide an independent assessment of the value of such a product and set limits on its price.",

Currently, there is little incentive for manufacturers to produce inexpensive drugs such as heparin and morphine, and even more mundane items like sterile saline and magnesium sulfate, resulting in periodic shortages of these indispensable materials [19]. Furthermore, pharmaceutical companies have little incentive for developing new classes of antibiotics, mainly because the monetary returns from such drugs are small in comparison to medicines used for chronic diseases such as cancer and diabetes. However, we desperately need new antimicrobials because of the emergence of bacteria resistant to the current drugs [20]. Vaccine production is another area frequently neglected by pharmaceutical companies because of a perceived lack of profitability. Margaret Chan, Director General of the WHO, criticized the drug industry for not developing an Ebola vaccine in advance of the current crisis. She said \u201cA profit-driven industry does not invest in products for markets that cannot pay\u201d [21]. Although the government has been encouraging antibiotic research by making funds available for drug development, and although Congress is considering legislation that would increase the levels of Medicare reimbursement for newer antibiotics [16], COPP could provide more immediate financial incentives for manufacturers to discover and produce novel antibiotics and vaccines. By controlling prices and ensuring the availability of essential health products, COPP would make a valuable contribution to global health care.",

This might have led blood bankers to underestimate the prevalence of HIV in donors because they failed to give attention to data derived from the homosexual population showing that infected persons might not have symptoms of AIDS for months to years. Likewise, medical experts advising the NHF were unaware that HIV infection had been fatal in almost half of those exposed to the virus and would be much worse than an untreated hemorrhage. Had these groups been better informed about what was happening in the homosexual community, they could have taken measures to limit the entrance of the virus into the blood supply and restricted the use of clotting factor concentrate, the product that infected the hemophilia community.",

This occurred because AIDS was identified by many as a \u201cgay\u201d disease, and discrimination against homosexuals was rampant in the small town in Indiana where he grew up. White and his family rejected the idea that he was an innocent victim, because that implied that gays with AIDS were guilty. In fact, gay men gave blood altruistically and were unaware that they were infected by HIV when they donated. White understood that AIDS was a disease, not a way of life, and he and his family were grateful for the assistance and advice they received from the gay community [23]. White was a strong proponent of education and research, noting that he faced discrimination, fear, and panic but became accepted when students and parents understood the facts of his illness.",

But isolated outbreaks of the disease still occur in nonhemophiliacs. A recent epidemic in rural Indiana illustrates how the sharing of contaminated needles disseminates HIV among people who abuse drugs [24]. In this poor community, marked by abandoned homes and widespread unemployment, many individuals became addicted to an opioid painkiller called Opana (Endo Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Malvern, PA). Although this drug is meant to be taken orally, addicts crushed the pills in water and injected the slurry intravenously. They reused needles hundreds of times and shared needles with other drug abusers. HIV infection was first recognized in January 2014; there were 71 cases by December and 135 by April 2015 [25]. The transmission rate was estimated at 80%, meaning that infection occurred in 8 of every 10 individuals sharing needles with an infected person [26]. Other factors that might have contributed to the size of the epidemic are the misperception that only homosexuals could become infected by HIV and the general reluctance to undergo testing and treatment because of the stigma attached to the disease [27]. To overcome these barriers, Indiana officials instituted a program of needle exchange, offered free HIV testing, and provided clinic facilities for treatment. It is still unclear whether these measures will be effective in limiting this outbreak.",

When we observe persons afflicted with disease, we need to support them and take active measures to relieve their suffering. This concern for the rights of those with AIDS was probably best expressed by Nelson Mandela, who vigorously fought against stigmatization and discrimination of infected persons [28]. We do not know who will be vulnerable to the next invasion by an infectious agent, but we must not let prejudice and irrational thinking prevent us from doing everything possible to identify and eradicate the contagion, no matter who is infected. Study of the AIDS epidemic in hemophiliacs is relevant because it shows that failure to adequately address diseases in minority populations inflicts a high cost on society as a whole; for example, it provides a convincing rationale for investing resources to control Ebola in West Africa before it is disseminated globally.",

Three hemoglobin products were extensively studied for this indication, but all had serious adverse effects and none received regulatory approval, although a related product has been approved for veterinary use. The current status of the various methods to limit or avoid transfusion of banked blood has recently been reviewed [31].",

These products have the advantage of providing protection against bleeding with fewer intravenous infusions. Although clotting factor replacement with recombinant factors has been the mainstay of hemophilia treatment, an ongoing problem is the development of resistance to the infused proteins. A current investigation is identifying sites on the clotting proteins that elicit the immune responses that destroy the infused therapeutic material [33]. By synthesizing clotting factors that lack these provocative areas, it might be possible to circumvent this treatment resistance. However, this approach will require a great deal of more basic research and probably several clinical trials to confirm the safety and effectiveness of these modified clotting proteins.",

A major research focus has been the development of a safe and effective vaccine, but this has been difficult because of the extensive variability in the envelope proteins of the virus and the fact that key sites on these proteins are masked from potential antibodies elicited by a vaccine [35]. However, recent research has produced several novel antibodies that are able to neutralize diverse strains of HIV [36]. In addition to assisting in the design of a vaccine, some of these antibodies also target the cells harboring the virus. These cells are the factories for viral synthesis and their elimination might have a long-term beneficial effect on the treatment of the infection. Other investigators are trying to determine why some patients have a natural resistance to HIV infection, and they have discovered that genetic mutations in certain cell membrane proteins thwart the virus from entering those cells. These studies might eventually result in the development of drugs that simulate these mutant proteins and prevent the spread of the infection.",

In particular, people with hemophilia experience a lack of social support and are under-employed, resulting in a high prevalence of depression [37]. Studies have shown that their quality of life is reduced, but data are lacking on many of the psychosocial aspects of hemophilia [38]. Research is also needed to define the factors that engender hostility and avoidance of those who fall outside of the usual societal norms. The development and early implementation of educational programs focused on instilling tolerance might promote greater acceptance of homosexuals and hemophiliacs. This type of research has been underfunded in the past, but it needs to be addressed if we wish to better the lives of all members of our society.",
