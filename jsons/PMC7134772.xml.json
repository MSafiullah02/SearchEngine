Influenza pandemics have occurred several times in each century since the Middle Ages, and three occurred during the 20th century: in 1918, 1957, and 1968. In the 21st century alone, aside from natural and man-made disasters, major emerging and reemerging infectious disease outbreaks, epidemics, and pandemics have included severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), chikungunya, Zika virus, cholera, H1N1, measles, Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus, and Ebola (1). In 2017, the World Health Organization determined that additional diseases posed a substantial risk of causing widespread public health disasters. These included arenaviral hemorrhagic fevers (e.g., Lassa fever), Crimean Congo hemorrhagic fever, filoviral diseases (e.g., Ebola and Marburg), Nipah and related henipaviral diseases, Rift Valley fever, and severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome (2). In their 2018 report, they added \u201cDisease X,\u201d which represents a serious international epidemic caused by a pathogen currently unknown to cause human disease (3). Increased international travel and instability have increased the risk for infectious spread and exposure to nuclear, biological, and chemical weapons.",

Yet planners cannot automatically assume that all health care workers will respond. Research suggests that although 80% or more of physicians and nurses might respond to mass casualty incidents, only about half would remain to work during an epidemic or radiological disaster or after a terrorist incident involving a chemical, biological, radiological, or nuclear agent 8, 9, 10. Workforce shortages in health care systems already stressed by increased patient care demands could lead to system failure (8). Response rates are further altered by an individual's race, sex, marital status, prior military service, specified role in the disaster plan, full-time or part-time status, and site of employment 11, 12. Health care professionals with clinical, ED, or other acute care experience were more willing to report to and stay at work than those from other areas (12). Today, as deadly diseases devastate regions around the globe, each of us must ask what we must do and what we should do if an intractable epidemic threatens our community. Public officials, when planning for disasters, must factor in whether health care personnel will choose to stay and \u201cfight\u201d or to flee, and then must modify their own plans and behavior to ensure the maximum health care workforce.",

Yet, until the SARS virus struck Asia and then Canada in 2003 and the Ebola virus appeared in the United States in 2014, few practicing emergency physicians had to ask themselves what they would do if they were personally at risk.

The AMA maintained that policy for nearly two centuries, stating as recently as 2001, \u201cWe, the members of the world community of physicians, solemnly commit ourselves to \u2026 apply our knowledge and skills when needed, though doing so may put us at risk\u201d (14). More recently, they have retreated from that position, opining that \u201cbecause of their commitment to care for the sick and injured, individual physicians have an obligation to provide urgent medical care during disasters. This ethical obligation holds even in the face of greater than usual risks to their own safety, health, or life. The physician workforce, however, is not an unlimited resource; therefore, when participating in disaster responses, physicians should balance immediate benefits to individual patients with ability to care for patients in the future\u201d (15).",

During the 2009 H1N1 outbreak, for example, many doctors and nurses at a large New York hospital system\u2014especially from the EDs and intensive care units, which saw the highest number of ill patients\u2014were absent due to proven illness; their social workers and counselors, however, had the highest absence rate, which they claimed was due to illness, although they were shown to have the lowest infection rate of any group (8). To ameliorate such situations, disaster planners and managers should do everything possible to communicate the risks clearly to all members of the health care system and to provide them with as much support and security as possible. Research also demonstrates that to obtain the maximal response during risk-prone and other disasters, planners must do everything they can to mitigate perceived risks and to address other concerns that may prevent staff from responding.",

Responders are generally most concerned about the safety of their family and loved ones rather than about themselves. Highly effective strategies for planners involve assessing the most common concerns of their workforce and addressing those concerns within the limits of their budget and situation. For example, multiple studies show that females are less likely to respond to disasters, and more than 90% of nurses are women. Therefore, prioritizing their concerns, such as providing childcare in the wake of widespread school closings, may be extremely important 10, 28. Potential responders to significant international risk-prone disasters, such as Ebola, may be dissuaded from responding by a negative and conflicting public response to returning responders, minimal organizational support, and confusing public health policies regarding quarantine (18).",

In contrast, in 1793, Dr. Benjamin Rush, one of America's most notable physicians and a signer of the Declaration of Independence, stayed to care for yellow fever victims in Philadelphia, the new country's capital and largest city.
