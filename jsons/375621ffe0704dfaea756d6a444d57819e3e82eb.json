The aim of this minireview is to present epidemiological data related to metabolic comorbidities in association with the SARS-CoV-2. Methods: This is a narrative mini-review with Pubmed search until 23 rd April 2020 using the keywords COVID-19, SARS-CoV-2, treatment of coronavirus and following terms: diabetes mellitus, obesity, arterial hypertension, ACE-inhibitors, cytokine storm, immune response and vitamin D. Results: Studies indicate that obese individuals are more likely to develop infections, and that adipose tissue serves as a pathogen reservoir. In diabetic individuals higher rate of inflammatory processes is seen due to constant glucose recognition by C type lectin receptors. Hypertensive individuals, usually grouped with other conditions, are treated with drugs to reduce blood pressure mostly through ACEi and ARB, that leads to increased ACE2 expression, used by SARS-CoV-2 for human's cell entry. Until now, the studies have shown that individuals with those conditions and affected by COVID-19 present an uncontrolled release of pro-inflammatory cytokines and an unbalanced immune response, leading to the cytokine storm phenomenon. Vitamin D is highlighted as a potential therapeutic target, because in addition to acting on the immune system, it plays an important role in the control of cardiometabolic diseases. Conclusion: Currently, since there is no proven and effective antiviral therapy for SARS-CoV-2, the efforts should focus on controlling inflammatory response and reduce the risks of associated complications.",

Increased circulating levels of many cytokines and proteins released by adipocytes are associated with inflammation in obese individuals 3 . Inflammation from adipose tissue generates chronic and systemic metabolic alterations leading to dyslipidemia, hypertension, CVD and diabetes, thus increasing the risk of infection by Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome-Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) 2 . It is thought that SARS-CoV-2, as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, suppress anti-viral type IFN-\u03b3 responses in the early stage of infection leading to an uncontrolled viral replication. This mechanism later leads to an influx of neutrophils and monocytes/macrophages, resulting in hyperproduction of pro-inflammatory cytokines that can damage lung tissue (i.e. pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome). Specific Th1/Th17 cells may be activated and contribute to increased inflammation. These facts and the higher mortality by COVID-19 observed in those with underlying diseases indicates that immune response is a determining factor to COVID-19 outcome 4 .",

According to genome sequencing, SARS-CoV-2 is about 89% identical to bat SARS-like-CoVZXC21, 82% identical to human SARS-CoV and about 50% to MERS-CoV 5, 9 . Several phylogenetic analyses suggests the bat as most probable animal reservoir for SARS-CoV-2, and as both SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV were transmitted from bats to palm civets or dromedary camels, and then to humans, it is possible though that another animal plays the role of intermediate host between bat and human in SARS-CoV-2 infection 10 .",

According to Hoffman 12 protein S is primed by human serine protease (TMPRSS2) and recognized by the cell receptor. A recent study described by Liu 11 shows that SARS-CoV entering in the respiratory tract depends on a receptor-binding domain (RBD) to bind to the host, and protein S has two trimers that bind to the heterodimer of angiotensin-converting enzyme II (ACE2). A synthetic SARS-CoV-2 RBD analysis indicated that the virus enters into the host cell through ACE2 binding. However, MERS-CoV binds specifically to another receptor, dipeptidil peptidase 4 (DPP4) 11, 13 . Therefore, since SARS-CoV-2 is analogous to SARS-CoV, it is suggested that both use ACE2 as the main mechanism for cell entry.",

The ACEi and ARB drugs targets the Renin Angiotensin System (RAS) and are also used in diabetes treatment, leading to an increased ACE2 expression that has been suggested by Fang 32 as risk increaser for severity of COVID-19, since SARS-CoV-2 uses ACE2 to enter the cells. In contrast, the study by Meng 33 , in a hypertensive Chinese population with COVID-19 under treatment with ACEi/ARB drugs, displayed an attenuated inflammatory response. By inhibiting IL-6 cytokine levels they achieved a better clinical result: higher CD3+ and CD8++ T cell counts in peripheral blood and lower viral load peak in comparison to other antihypertensive drugs. In addition, during hospitalization, 12 patients from the non-ACEi/ARB group (48%) were considered severe and one patient died versus ACEi/ARB group with 4 severe patients (23.5%) and no deaths. Therefore, there is no evidence that increased ACE2 expression by these drugs is indeed harmful, and further studies are needed to clarify their effects on COVID-19 infection. Also, the IL-6 controlled levels leading to better clinical results showed that an equilibrated inflammatory response is determining a better outcome for COVID-19 disease.",

VD 3 has a genomic binding site (VDR-GP), in which a transcriptional complex is formed modulating the expression of genes such as ACE and the VDR itself 42 .

Besides on acting on the immune system, this hormone plays an important role in metabolic disorders such as the pathophysiology of diabetes, modulating the expression of insulin and reducing systemic inflammation; regulating blood pressure by renin-angiotensinaldosterone system (RAAS); and in obesity, regulating adipogenesis and the production and release of adipokines and cytokines.

For all people with diabetes (over 2 years old) pneumococci and annual vaccination against influenza are recommended. In addition, patients with diabetes have a serious disease when infected with respiratory infections.

CS can be triggered by infectious diseases, rheumatic diseases, and tumor immunotherapy, and it generally presents as systemic inflammation, and multiple organ failure 34 . Among the consequences of CS on lung viral infections are epithelial and endothelial cell apoptosis, resulting in vascular leakage and alveolar edema ultimately leading to hypoxia; impaired T cell response, accumulation of alternatively activated macrophages, changed tissue homeostasis, and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), the last being a primary cause of death in SARS-CoV/MERS-CoV patients 35 . The levels of inflammatory factors were measured in a study reported by Huang 36 , including 41 COVID-19 patients (13 ICU and 28 non-ICU patients). IL-1B, IL-1RA, IL-7, IL-8, IL-9, IL-10, fibroblast growth factor (FGF), granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF), interferon-\u03b3 (IFN\u03b3), interferon-\u03b3-inducible protein (IP10), monocyte chemoattractant protein (MCP1), macrophage inflammatory protein 1 alpha (MIP1A), tumor necrosis factor (TNF\u03b1), vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and others inflammatory factors were increased in both ICU and non-ICU patients compared to healthy adults. ICU patients showed higher concentrations of GCSF, IP10, MCP1, MIP1A, and TNF\u03b1 than non-ICU patients, suggesting that the cytokine storm was associated with higher disease severity. A retrospective cohort study conducted by Zhou 37 reported elevated IL-6 blood levels in non-survivors compared with survivors throughout the clinical course of COVID-19 illness.
