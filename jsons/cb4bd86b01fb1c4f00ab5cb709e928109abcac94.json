Exopathogens are exogenous pathogenic factors of six climatic conditions in excess and epidemic pathogenic factors but not all pathogenic factors in general. Diseases that are highly contagious have been called plague or typhoid. There are detailed record in methods to prevent and treat typhoid in Treaties of Febrile Diseases. Because Treaties of Febrile Diseases covers the theory, therapeutic principles, and prescriptions for the treatment of exogenous diseases, it is of great importance in medicine. So most clinicians of TCM seek treatment for epidemic disease in Treaties of Febrile Diseases. The State Administration of Traditional Chinese Medicine recently recommended combining Chinese and Western treatments of 2019-nCoV pneumonia in clinical practice. They devised an herbal medication to combat viral infections, called the Qingfei Paidu Decoction.",
