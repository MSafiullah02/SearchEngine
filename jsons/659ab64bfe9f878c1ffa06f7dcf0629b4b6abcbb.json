Human coronavirus was first identified in 1960s and it has undergone several generations. Using the evolved viral sequences for the past decades and newly sequenced COVID-19 samples with ongoing mutations, researchers can use prediction systems to come up with potential sequences in the next generation. Given the sequence, systems such as AlphaFold can provide information about abnormally folded proteins as a result of viral mutation. By training a ML-based system with known viral mutations in certain sequence regions and their effects on viral behaviour, it can foresee a pathogenic aspect of the predicted mutation as well.",
