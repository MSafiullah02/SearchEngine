The absence of a streamlined process for screening and documenting travel history can lead to missed identification of patients who are potentially infected.5 To address this challenge, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in the United States developed an algorithm, termed \u201cIdentify, Isolate, Inform,\u201d to provide guidance for emergency departments and other health care points of entry on the evaluation and management of persons suspected of having EVD.6 The algorithm is adaptable, having been modified for MERS, mumps, measles, and Zika; a similar algorithm was developed specifically for emergency medical services (EMS).10, 11, 7, 8, 9\n",

Although it is possible to bypass the screening questions, the nursing and registration staff are educated and encouraged to complete the EMR tool.

Moreover, the emergency department and Infection Control Department, in conjunction with the Nebraska Biocontainment Unit, worked together to fine-tune the identification, isolation, and treatment processes and protocols for patients under investigation for highly hazardous communicable diseases through annual competencies and no-notice drills. A review of these After Action Reports and collaboration with multiple partners ensured that the screening process was being adhered to consistently. Quantitative data to describe the proportion of patients presenting to the emergency department or outpatient clinics who were screened using the algorithm and flagged for being suspect patients for a highly hazardous communicable disease, as well as the number of exposure investigations before and after implementation of the EMR algorithm, are based on administrative data estimates from the hospital and ED leadership.",

The implementation of the EMR screening algorithm generated several ethical considerations. For patients who were identified through the screening process as potential high-risk cases for EVD or MERS, there was a risk that care would be delayed for a more common diagnosis while testing for the highly hazardous communicable disease was conducted. As a result, a process was developed to continue diagnostic testing and treatment of the more common illnesses while awaiting test results for MERS or EVD. In addition, there were ethical aspects related to maintaining the isolation of a person under investigation who elected to leave before the test results were available. To address these cases, a process was developed for local public health officials, hospital infection control, and ED providers to conduct risk-benefit analyses jointly on the basis of risks to the public, the option to place a medical hold until the test results were available for cases with public health concerns, and the likelihood of the individual maintaining self-quarantine if the risk was determined to be low.",

Moreover, improvements were made to the evaluation process of other common respiratory causes while maintaining isolation for suspected MERS cases.

In South Korea, a single traveler returning from the Middle East with undiagnosed MERS resulted in an outbreak of 186 additional cases after he presented to an emergency department.13 Although not all regional Ebola and other special pathogen treatment centers in the United States require that a patient with suspected or confirmed MERS be cared for in a high-level isolation unit, this case highlights the impact super-spreaders can have in a health care setting without the most advanced engineering and administrative controls and emphasizes the critical need to identify patients with a highly hazardous communicable disease at the earliest possible time point.",

In addition, from a public health perspective, consideration should be given to plans for patients who attempt to leave against medical advice. It is important to note that the index patient in the previously mentioned MERS outbreak in South Korea initially denied travel to the Middle East; therefore, inaccurate travel and medical histories are real-world possibilities that should be considered when patients present for care. Early involvement of specialists in infectious diseases is recommended so that they may assist with the epidemiologic evaluation. The availability of diagnostic testing for patients with suspected EVD and MERS is an important aspect of the evaluation of a person under investigation, and emphasis should be placed on timely and appropriate specimen collection, as well as ensuring the availability of laboratory personnel with experience in performing the necessary diagnostic tests. At our institution, a link to a video detailing the process of appropriate respiratory specimen collection is included in our MERS person-under-investigation evaluation protocol. Public health laboratory staff are on-call 24/7, and early laboratory notification is necessary to ensure timely processing of specimens. The Department of Infection Control is involved in the process and should be notified as soon as a person under investigation is identified so that they can ensure adherence to strict infection control practices during the patient evaluation.",

Owing to the challenges in extracting aggregated data through our hospital EMR, the percentage of patients presenting to the emergency department or outpatient clinics who were screened and flagged, as well as the number of exposure investigations conducted before the implementation of the EMR algorithm, are all estimates from the hospital and ED leadership. As such, the collection method for this data relies on experts\u2019 reporting and is not comprehensive or robust. Systematic data collection is recommended for hospitals looking to implement and quantify the impact of implementing such an algorithm. In addition, although we believe that the described algorithm is straightforward and concise, screening outcomes rely on human factors for compliance and implementation.14 In this case, the process rests on greeter nurses and registration staff posing the screening questions to every patient entering the emergency department or other health care entry point, regardless of visible symptoms. Education on the importance of the algorithm and the critical advantage of identifying and masking symptoms early is needed to ensure that those interacting with patients implement the process. In addition, diseases are ever evolving, and outbreaks undoubtedly will emerge in different regions of the world. As such, there is a need for health care teams to monitor current disease threats around the world continually and to update the system to match those events. Last, the travel-screening algorithm has undergone a number of revisions over the last 5 years and will continue to be updated on the basis of the lessons learned. Health care systems adopting a strategy similar to the one we have described must be open to modifying it to fit local, national, and international circumstances and needs.",

It is essential that nurses are prepared to recognize the risk and isolate patients potentially infected with communicable diseases such as influenza, measles, MERS, EVD, and other emerging infectious diseases, including COVID-19. When a patient presents to the emergency department with the potential for a highly hazardous communicable disease, it is imperative that the first nurse or health care team member to encounter that patient recognizes the risk and isolates the patient to prevent transmission to other patients, visitors, and health care staff. The current intake process in many emergency departments leaves nurses unprepared to provide prompt recognition, and the lack of consistent tools places them in situations in which they have little information to recognize the risks. The implementation of a standardized screening process, such as the one we have described, that includes symptomology and travel history built into the EMR can arm emergency nurses with the tools they need to identify patients quickly and recommend isolation precautions; a workflow algorithm readily available on the intranet and used consistently provides a standardized and effective way to identify, isolate, and inform and can improve communication, efficiency, safety, and patient experience. Moreover, in our experience, implementation of this symptom- and travel-screening strategy has reduced staff exposures to more common communicable diseases such as influenza and measles, thereby reducing the need for postexposure prophylaxis and treatment.",

Emergency departments often represent the first line of response to a domestic case of a highly hazardous communicable disease, and the implementation of efficient and effective screening tools that improve identification and reduce exposures in the emergency department can truly determine whether we will be dealing with a single case, a cluster, or an outbreak.",
