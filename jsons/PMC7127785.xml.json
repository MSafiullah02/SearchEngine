Within a number of years, Keshan disease (as the condition came to be known) affected thousands of people and it became the top disease priority of the Chinese Ministry of Public Health. Several hypotheses were proposed to explain the cause of the disease, but it was not until 1979 that a connection was established between nutritional Se deficiency and Keshan disease. The amount of evidence that supported this hypothesis was impressive. Epidemiological surveys showed that Se levels in the soils, foods and people residing in highly endemic areas were very low compared with levels in control regions free of the disease [7]. Moreover, Chinese scientists carried out a large intervention trial that demonstrated quite conclusively that supplementation of individuals with nutritional amounts of sodium selenite effectively prevented the disease [8]. Widespread use of Se supplements in the endemic Keshan disease areas led to a drastic decline in the number of cardiomyopathies observed in these areas.",

For example, Keshan disease exhibits wide swings in prevalence from one year to another and even from one season to another. Such behavior is more consistent with an infectious disease than with a nutritional deficiency. The Chinese scientists realized this and were able to demonstrate that certain enteroviruses, particularly a coxsackievirus B4 isolated from a Keshan disease victim from Chuxong County in Yunnan Province, were able to induce heart lesions with greater severity in mice fed a diet low in Se than in mice fed the same diet supplemented with Se [9].",

Coxsackievirus B3 (CVB3) infection of mice can cause myocarditis, similar to that found in human populations. However, infection of mice with an avirulent strain of CVB3 (designated CVB3/0) does not lead to myocarditis, although replicating virus can be isolated from the hearts of infected mice. For our model, we divided mice into two groups and fed one group a normal diet and the other group a diet deficient in Se. After four weeks, all mice were infected with the benign strain CVB3/0. As expected, the infected mice fed the Se-sufficient diet did not develop any cardiac inflammation. However, the Se-deficient mice developed moderate to severe myocarditis [11]. To determine if the increase in virulence was due to host factors alone, or a result of alterations in the virus, we isolated virus from the hearts of Se-deficient mice and passed it back into Se-adequate mice. If host factors alone were the cause of the increase in virulence, then the Se-adequate mice infected with virus isolated from Se-deficient mice should not develop disease. However, the infected mice did develop myocarditis, suggesting that the virus itself had been altered [11].",

No nucleotide changes were found in viral genomes isolated from Se-adequate control mice. The mutations persisted after the now virulent virus was passed into naive Se-adequate mice, producing pathology (Figure 1\n). Therefore, replication in a Se-deficient host led to specific viral mutations, which changed an avirulent virus into a virulent one.

GPX incorporates Se as selenocysteine (a novel 21st amino acid in addition to the 20 commonly recognized ones). When Se is limiting in the diet the activity of GPX declines. Se is also incorporated into more than 20 other proteins, some of which have functions other than antioxidant protection. To determine if a decrease in GPX activity was a crucial step in Se-associated change in virulence, we infected GPX-1 knockout mice with CVB3/0. These mice, similar to Se-deficient mice, developed myocarditis, whereas infected wild-type mice did not. Sequencing of the viral genome demonstrated mutation to the cardiovirulent genotype at seven nucleotide positions, of which six were identical to the mutations found in the virus isolated from Se-deficient mice [13] (Table 1).",

In this way, excess dietary iron can damage a variety of cellular components, including lipids, nucleic acids and proteins [15]. Therefore, it was of interest to determine the effect of dietary iron overload on the ability of CVB3/0 to cause cardiopathology in our mouse model. Mice were fed either a diet containing a normal level of iron (35 parts per million or ppm) or an iron overload diet containing 1050 ppm of iron. At each level of dietary iron, half the mice received the same diet lacking vitamin E. After consuming their assigned diets for four weeks, the mice were infected with CVB3/0 (the amyocarditic strain of CVB3). In those mice that received the vitamin E-supplemented diets, consumption of the high iron diet resulted in elevated viral titers and increased heart damage versus the normal iron controls [16]. Consumption of the high iron diet that lacked vitamin E resulted in further increases in viral titers and heart damage. Therefore, here we have another example of how nutritional manipulation of host oxidative stress status can have an impact on viral pathogenesis, such that an amyocarditic form of the virus was converted into a myocarditic one.",

Needless to say, any damaging effect of iron in HIV infection would have important public health implications because of the general use of iron supplements to prevent or cure anemia.

Consequently, mutations in the M region of the genome might lead to increased viral replication of the mutant virus. Increased viral titers in turn might lead to increased lung pathology, and hence increased pathogenicity of the virus. In support of this hypothesis, viral titers of the mutant virus were higher in infected mice compared with wild-type virus [23].",

But in contrast to coxsackievirus, poliovirus cannot be studied using the usual mouse models, because rodents do not normally carry the human poliovirus receptor. However, it is possible to generate transgenic mice that express poliovirus receptors, thereby making them suitable for investigating numerous properties of poliovirus, including neurovirulence, attenuation and tissue tropism. Another experimental approach, of course, would be to study poliovirus in human subjects rather than in animal models. Broome et al.\n[4] supplemented three groups of healthy people (22 members, including 11 males and 11 females in each group) with 0, 50 or 100 \u03bcg of Se (as sodium selenite) per day for 15 weeks (for a discussion of what constitutes a nutritionally relevant dose of Se, see Ref. [26]). All subjects were judged to be of relatively low initial Se status as indicated by plasma Se concentrations <1.2 \u03bcmol/L. After six weeks of supplementation, all subjects were given an oral live attenuated poliomyelitis vaccine. Supplementation continued uninterrupted after vaccination for a further nine weeks.",

Akaike et al.\n[5] reported increased rates of mutation of an RNA (Sendai) virus that had been exposed to reactive nitrogen species (RNS), such as nitric oxide (NO) and peroxynitrite (ONOO\u2212). Both NO and O2\n\u2212 have been shown to increase the pathogenesis of an influenza virus infection in laboratory experiments 27, 30, 31. Notably, an inducible form of NOS (nitric oxide synthetase or iNOS) is strongly activated by a variety of pathogens, including neurotropic, cardiotropic and pneumotropic viruses (e.g. coxsackievirus or influenza virus), causing an overproduction of NO in infected tissues [28]. Importantly, inhibition or elimination (knockout) of iNOS activity significantly reduces pathological consequences of various viral infections [28], including pneumonitis caused by influenza virus in mice [27]. The work of these groups with RNS and of our group with Se and vitamin E deficiency strongly suggests that oxidative and/or nitrosative stress in the host tissues significantly contributes to the modification of viral RNA during virus replication. Therefore, a nutritional deficiency of an antioxidant that leads to increased production of ROS and/or RNS is probably responsible for viral mutations.",

This variation occurs because of the error-prone replication of RNA viruses, lack of viral proofreading enzymes and short generation times. During viral replication, the quasispecies will reach equilibrium and a consensus, or dominant sequence, will emerge.

Thus, determination of the \u2018genomic sequence,\u2019 even for a carefully cloned population, is really an assessment of the dominant (or consensus) sequence. The dominant genotype might shift gradually, or it could change suddenly if environmental pressures are imposed [32]. Most variant sequences, however, are present as tiny minorities within the overall population; nevertheless, it has been shown that a given sequence that once had a selective advantage might persist through many replicative cycles, unobserved by phenotype or consensus sequencing, and might re-emerge rapidly when it is again favored by selective pressure. This phenomenon has been termed the \u2018memory\u2019 of viral quasispecies [33].",

Replication of the viral quasispecies within a nutritionally adequate animal (not oxidatively stressed) results in the dominant consensus genotype remaining dominant and therefore no disease is induced. However, replication of the viral quasispecies within a nutritionally deficient host (oxidatively stressed) leads to a much different outcome. The previous minority genotype is now able to outcompete and replace the previously dominant genotype. This might be due to impaired immune function as a result of the nutritional deficiencies, enabling the minority genotype to escape immune clearance. In addition, oxidative damage to intracellular structures might favor the replication of the minority genotype, again enabling the expression of a new viral variant, which now replaces the previous consensus sequence.

All techniques tested to increase oxidative stress in host animals led to the common outcome of increased viral virulence with reproducible genome mutations found in two RNA viruses: coxsackievirus and influenza. The demonstration that this phenomenon occurs within two different viral RNA families suggests that host nutritional deficiencies can have an effect on several different viral infections. These results represent a new paradigm for the interaction between host nutritional status and the emergence of new viral diseases in the human population. Widespread nutritional deficiencies occur in many developing countries, which are frequently the site of emergence of new viral diseases as well as old viral diseases with new pathogenic properties. We suggest that host nutritional status be considered when studying the causes for viral emergence, and that adequate nutrition of the population is an important form of protection against the emergence of new viral pathogens.",

A viral quasispecies is used to infect two different populations of mice: nutritionally adequate or nutritionally deficient. Note that the consensus sequence of the viral quasispecies is avirulent (blue circles) although a virulent genotype (orange circles) is present in the mix in a very small amount and is not detectable by sequencing. Nutritionally adequate mice infected with the viral quasispecies do not develop pathology and sequencing of the virus genome confirms that the virus remains the avirulent genotype. Nutritionally deficient mice infected with viral quasispecies develop severe pathology. Isolation and sequencing of virus recovered from the nutritionally deficient host demonstrates selection of a new consensus sequence with a virulent genotype (orange circles). Once the virulent genotype becomes dominant in the viral quasispecies, even nutritionally adequate mice will develop severe pathology.",
