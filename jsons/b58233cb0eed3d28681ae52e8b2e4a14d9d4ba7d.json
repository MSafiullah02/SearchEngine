Isolated involvement of distal segments of coronary arteries is uncommon but has been described [56] . 4. It has been suggested that an aneurysm may be better defined as a dilatation that is 1.5 times or more than an adjacent segment. This circumvents the problems associated with Z scores. 5. Detailed and better evaluation of coronary arteries requires multiple transducer positions, imaging in multiple planes and high frequency transducers. Coronary artery diameters refer to the maximal internal luminal diameter. Measurements should not be taken at branching points. 6. Limitations of 2DE include difficulty in visualization of distal coronaries, frequent non-visualization of left circumflex coronary artery, difficulty in commenting on stenosis or thrombosis and limited field of vision in older children because of thick chest walls. Another problem is due to artifacts especially while scanning the right coronary artery or left circumflex coronary artery. 7. Several nomograms on Z scores are available and there may be variations in the measurements. Body surface area calculations have to be carried out meticulously and there is no consensus on the ideal method. It cannot be overemphasized that a trivial difference in measurement of weight and height (especially in infants and young children) can significantly impact the calculations of Z scores. 8.
