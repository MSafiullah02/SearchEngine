In addition, baculoviruses can be efficiently taken up by mammalian cells without viral replication (Carbonell et al., 1985, Tjia et al., 1983, Volkman and Goldsmith, 1983). Modified AcMNPVs can express exogenous genes in mammalian cells (Boyce and Bucher, 1996, Delaney and Isom, 1998, Duisit et al., 1999, Hofmann et al., 1995, Shoji et al., 1997) when they contain promoters that are active in mammalian cells, such as Rous sarcoma virus (RSV) promoter and cytomegalovirus immediate-early (CMV-IE) promoter. For instance, AcMNPV-containing CMV-IE promoter can infect human hepatocytes and result in high-level expression of luciferase (Hofmann et al., 1995). Since it is safe, efficient, and gene delivery-specific, the use of baculoviruses may represent a novel vaccine strategy.",

To prevent another SARS epidemic, continuous efforts have been made towards the development of a prophylactic vaccine. So far, vaccine studies have mainly focused on the two structural proteins, spike (S) and nucleocapsid (N), of SARS-CoV (Anton et al., 1996, Jackwood and Hilt, 1995). There is little knowledge regarding the immunogenicity of the N and S proteins of SARS-like coronavirus (SL-CoV) that is isolated from horseshoe bats, which are thought to be the possible animal reservoirs of SARS-CoV (Lau et al., 2005, Li et al., 2005, Ren et al., 2006). Since effective SARS vaccines should not only prevent the reemergence of SARS-CoV, but should also provide cross-protection against SL-CoV, we report the immunogenicity of N and S proteins of SL-CoV in mice using a modified baculovirus expression system.",

As shown in Fig. 2\n, mice immunized with either vAc-N or vAc-S showed detectable antibody responses to SARS-CoV on day 14, and the titers significantly increased following two additional injections. By day 42, both vAc-N and vAc-S immunized groups had an antibody response to SARS-CoV that was \u223c9-fold greater than the background (PBS control group). There was no significant difference in antibody titer detected from the vAc-N and vAc-S immunized groups. It should be noted that sera from the Ac-GFP-immunized group showed a detectable response to SARS-CoV antigens, although the response was significantly lower than from the vAc-N or vAc-S immunized groups. This cross-activity was very likely due to \u201cnon-specific\u201d antibodies induced by baculoviral antigens, which can also interact with SARS-CoV proteins, because pre-incubation with Ac-GFP completely abrogated such cross-activity (data not shown).",

The majority of these vaccines target SARS-CoV structural proteins, particularly the S and N proteins. The S protein is essential for viral infection, while the N protein is important for the transcription of viral RNA. Full-length S or S1 subunit was shown to induce effective immune response against SARS-CoV and to elicit neutralizing antibodies that protect against virus challenge (Bukreyev et al., 2004, Gao et al., 2003, Yang et al., 2004). Anti-N antibodies were present at high levels in SARS patients and persisted for a long time. In agreement, vectors that expressed full-length or truncated N proteins were highly immunogenic (Chen et al., 2004, Guan et al., 2004, Huang et al., 2004, Leung et al., 2004, Tan et al., 2004, Woo et al., 2004). Hence, the S and N proteins may be the most promising vaccine candidates against SARS-CoV. SL-CoV isolated from bats is \u223c92% homologous to human SARS-CoV (Li et al., 2005, Ren et al., 2006), suggesting that bats may serve as a natural reservoir of SARS-CoV. Therefore, bat SL-CoV should be taken into consideration for developing a cross-protective vaccine.",

            "text": "We chose baculoviruses for gene transfer and expression systems for several reasons. Baculoviruses are not toxic, even at high multiplicity of infection, and are considered to be safe, since they do not replicate in mammalian cells (Volkman and Goldsmith, 1983). In addition, baculoviruses are capable of carrying large DNA insertions and their recombinant forms are straightforward to construct (Cheshenko et al., 2001). Moreover, engineered baculoviruses that contain mammalian-cell activate promoter elements have been demonstrated to efficiently transfer genes and stably express proteins in mammalian cells (Cheng et al., 2004, Condreay et al., 1999, Hofmann et al., 1995, Kost and Condreay, 2002). In order to express the N and S proteins of SL-CoV in mammalian cells, we replaced the primary promoters, Polh and p10, in the pFastBac DUAL vector with other promoters, CMV and EF-1\u03b1, respectively. The GFP gene was constructed as a reporter under the control of EF-1\u03b1. According to Cheng et al. (2004), incubation of target mammalian cells with the culture supernatant of infected Sf9 cells (1 \u00d7 107\n pfu/ml) for 12 h (MOI = 50) resulted in the highest gene transfer efficiency, the highest protein expression, and the least impairment to cell viability (Cheng et al., 2004). In our study, the titers of the two recombinant baculoviruses, vAc-S and vAc-N, did not reach 1 \u00d7 107\n pfu/ml. We, therefore, prolonged the incubation time to 24 h by transducing BHK cells with 100 MOI of recombinant virus, vAc-N or vAc-S. Under these conditions, fluorescence was observed at 24 h post-transduction and lasted until 72 h post-transduction, indicating that the modified baculoviruses successfully expressed exogenous genes in mammalian cells.",

Our data indicated that mice immunized with either vAc-N or vAc-S produced sera that strongly interacted with SARS-CoV. Since an in vitro cell culture model of bat SL-CoV has not yet been established, we were unable to determine the serum neutralizing activity that was specific to SL-CoV. Given that the S protein is the key protein of viral entry and contains neutralizing epitopes, as demonstrated in other coronavirus studies, antibodies raised against the S protein of SL-CoV will also likely have the capability of neutralizing this virus.",

            "text": "In addition to the antibody response, mice that were immunized with either vAc-N or vAc-S also demonstrated cellular immune responses. Th1 (IFN-\u03b3) and Th2 (IL-4) cytokines were examined by ELISPOT and a strong bias towards Th1 production was detected. Our results are consistent with those observed in other SARS DNA vaccine studies (Huang et al., 2006, Kong et al., 2005, Woo et al., 2005, Yang et al., 2004, Zakhartchouk et al., 2005). The balance between Th1 and Th2 responses to an infectious agent can influence both pathogen growth and immunopathology. Th1 cells are responsible for cell-mediated immunity, while Th2 cells are responsible for humoral immunity (Bottomly, 1988, Mosmann and Cofman, 1989). The principal function of Th1 cells is to elicit phagocyte-mediated defense against infections, and Th1-dominant immune responses are often associated with inflammation and tissue injury. Humoral immune responses could be induced against virus; however, this type of response alone may not be sufficient for protection and clearing of the virus. T cell responses, especially Th1-mediated cellular immunity, may be a crucial factor for long-term protection. The Th1 cytokine, IFN-\u03b3, can activate macrophages and stimulate the production of IgG antibodies (Wu et al., 2002), whereas IL-2 is required for the growth of T cells and may even be required for naive T cells to produce IL-4 (Powers et al., 1988). In the present study, although cellular immune responses were observed in both CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, there was a greater number of IFN-\u03b3 and IL-2-secreting CD4 T cells detected. Given that CD4 T cells can increase the number of immune memory cells that respond rapidly when re-exposed to pathogens, and thus play a vital role in protection against virus challenge (Bourgeois et al., 2002a, Bourgeois et al., 2002b), the marked increase of CD4 T cell in mice immunized with the recombinant baculoviruses, vAc-N or vAc-S, may prove to be significant in the protection against SARS-CoV and SL-CoV infection.",

Mice injected with these two recombinant baculoviruses elicited an antibody response that interacted with SARS-CoV and demonstrated a Th1-dominant immune response. Our results indicate that recombinant baculovirus can be transduced into mammalian cells by direct injection, and such transductions can elicit immune responses. This strategy is considered to be safe, since baculoviruses do not replicate in mammalian cells and do not induce a cytopathic effect (CPE). To our knowledge, this is the first report characterizing the N and S proteins of bat SL-CoV in a mouse model. Because it is adjuvant-free and there is no need to purify proteins, the use of recombinant baculoviruses may represent a convenient strategy for studying the immunogenicity of genes in animal models.",
