Modern-day environmental stewardship in the United States is derived from two distinct historical threads. The first, which we refer to as \u201cgreen\u201d environmentalism, focuses on preserving and maintaining natural ecosystems, habitats, and specific sites for the purpose of maintaining biodiversity. The second arena of environmental stewardship, which we call \u201cbrown\u201d environmentalism, focuses on limiting and mitigating pollution that is generated by human activities\u2014principally industry and agriculture\u2014that affect human health.",

            "text": "\u201cGreen\u201d conservation in the US was inspired by the nineteenth-century transcendental writings of Thoreau, Emerson, and the preservationist John Muir, who ascribed an intrinsic value to nature. According to this philosophy, Nature should be protected, not because it has current or future quantifiable value for society, but rather, because of what we don\u2019t know about it. At the core of these ideals is a belief that natural, pristine places have a spiritual and magical grandeur, and that we should respect them out of childlike wonder (Emerson 1836). This philosophy laid the groundwork for early environmental policy at the end of the nineteenth century and for the protection of large tracks of land for conservation. John Muir was instrumental in lobbying Congress to enact the National Parks bill in 1890 and protect Yosemite Valley from development. He formed the Sierra Club in 1892 based on these preservationist ideals. Muir and colleagues believed in the physical and psychological healing properties of Nature and justified the conservation of wilderness, in part, by its link with human health and well-being. \u201cEverybody needs beauty as well as bread, places to play in and pray in, where nature may heal and give strength to body and soul alike\u201d (Muir 1912).",

Pinchot implemented a policy of \u201cmultiple\u201d or \u201cwise use\u201d for Federal lands\u2014a policy still in effect today. Pinchot summed up the mission of the Forest Service, which has stewardship of 193 million acres\u2014an area the size of Texas\u2014as \u201cproviding the greatest amount of good for the greatest amount of people in the long run\u201d (www.fs.fed.us).

In the process, they developed the early makings of \u201cbrown\u201d environmentalism. John Simpson, the first medical health officer in London and less well-known contemporary of John Snow, the \u201cfather of modern epidemiology,\u201d emphasized the need for improvements to water quality to combat disease. In 1856 he described the Thames in London as \u201c\u2026contaminated with the outscourings of the metropolis, swarming with infusorial life, and containing unmistakeable molecules of excrement\u201d (Simpson 1856). His reports led to the first real attempt to improve sanitation and river quality in the UK\u2014an early example of the \u201cbrown\u201d approach to environmental stewardship in which restoring freshwater ecosystems was a means to protect human health (Ashby 1977).",

Hazardous environmental and health impacts in the United States from toxic pollution were first brought to the public\u2019s attention by Rachel Carson, a marine biologist and now famous environmental whistle-blower. In her book Silent Spring (1962), Carson highlighted the cascading ecological and health effects of DDT, arguing that pollution was the primary scourge against humanity:Only yesterday mankind lived in fear of the scourges of smallpox, cholera, and plague that once swept nations before them. Now our major concern is no longer with the disease organisms that once were omnipresent; sanitation, better living conditions, and new drugs have given us a high degree of control over infectious disease. Today we are concerned with a different kind of hazard that lurks in our environment\u2014a hazard we ourselves have introduced into our world as our modern way of life has evolved. (Carson 1962)\n",

In 1965, few people considered pollution important; five years later, it ranked second only to crime among the public\u2019s concerns (Graham 1999). Carson\u2019s health-centric political lobbying, combined with major pollution events resulting from some highly visible industrial accidents, such as the Santa Barbara oil spill in 1969, led to the establishment of the US Environmental Protection Agency in 1970 and to the subsequent adoption of two of the most important and pioneering environmental health laws in US history: the Clean Air Act (1970) and the Clean Water Act (reorganized in 1972). These are fundamentally \u201cbrown\u201d Acts that seek to protect the environment as a way to safeguard human health, rather than to care for the environment for its own sake.",

We emphasize a few key points: First, in retrospect, Carson was only partially correct. While pollutants remain an insidious threat to health and the environment, there is now a growing acceptance that emerging infectious diseases (EID\u2019s) are on the rise and are having dramatic impacts on both global health and conservation (Daszak et al. 2000; Karesh et al. 2012). The public health optimism of the late 1960s that led Carson to dismiss the threats from \u201cdisease organisms\u201d and William Stewart, then the U.S. Surgeon General, famously to \u201cclose the book\u201d on infectious diseases (Lederberg et al. 1992), is over. Today the impact and threat of pandemic zoonoses is real and looms large over humanity (Morse et al. 2012). Over 60% of human infectious pathogens are zoonotic, the majority from wildlife. The list of deadly or debilitating agents includes SARS, HIV, Nipah virus, Lyme disease, Rocky Mountain spotted fever, West Nile virus, and salmonella. Further, EIDs have increased in frequency since the 1970s (Jones et al. 2008).",

            "text": "Second, infectious diseases are now recognized as a significant threat to wildlife conservation and to the broader environment (Daszak et al. 2000). For example, the introduced pathogen, Geomyces destructans (cause of White Nose Syndrome), has spread rapidly in just over five years, killing six million bats from 11 species in North America (whitenosesyndrome.org). Several bat species are now threatened with extinction, an event that could have substantial downstream ecological and economic effects (Frick et al. 2010; Boyles et al. 2011; Langwig et al. 2012). Anthropogenically introduced pathogens have already caused species extinctions\u2014from gastric-brooding frogs in Australia (chytrid fungus), through to around a third of Hawaiian honeycreepers (introduced malaria and pox virus). The distribution of EIDs in nature is pan-global, with antibodies to chicken viruses found in Antarctic penguins, and the spread of West Nile virus and whirling disease reaching from Europe across the US continental divide. We now have a new phrase to bring to the conservation lexicon\u2014\u2018Pathogen Pollution\u2019 (Daszak et al. 2000). In this play on Carson\u2019s text, we consider the pathogens that people unwittingly spread around the planet as we alter landscapes, expand agriculture, and travel to new regions. This form of pollution can be as insidious as DDT and may have already had a higher impact on our environment.",

These anthropogenic \u201cdrivers\u201d include deforestation, agricultural expansion, natural resource exploitation, bushmeat hunting, and global travel and trade (Morse 1993). These drivers, which are primarily associated with land-use change, facilitate the emergence of zoonotic diseases by disrupting \u2018natural\u2019 host-pathogen dynamics and/or by exposing humans to a novel pool of pathogens from wildlife reservoirs (Jones et al. 2013; Murray and Daszak 2013). The emergence of Nipah virus in Malaysia is a good example of how environmental drivers, including the industrialization and expansion of pig farms into bat habitat, led to pathogen spillover and a subsequent human outbreak (Daszak et al. 2006; Pulliam et al. 2012).",
