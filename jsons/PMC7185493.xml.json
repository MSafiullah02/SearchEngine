            "text": "Molecular analyses are now an essential part of virological diagnosis. Their high sensitivity, short turnaround time and ability to simultaneously detect and quantify multiple RNA and DNA viruses in small clinical samples have made them the gold standard for diagnosing and monitoring viral infections [1], [2], [3], [4]. Nevertheless, performance also depends partly on the amount and quality of extracted nucleic acids (NA). Poor extraction or incomplete removal of inhibitory molecules can significantly undermine the reliability of molecular diagnosis. Initially done by centrifugation or chemical separation, extraction is now mainly based on NA adsorption to silica in the presence of chaotropic salts such as sodium iodide, guanidine thiocyanate or guanidine hydrochloride, followed by elution with low-salt buffer or water [5], [6], [7], [8]. This silica-based technology, notably improved by Boom and colleagues, allowed the NA isolation procedure to be automated, ensuring better standardization and reproducibility [9].",

NucliSENS\u00ae easyMAG\u00ae limited manual extraction steps (particularly washing) and could simultaneously extract up to 24 clinical specimens in one hour. Its performance on clinical whole blood, sputum, serum and throat swab specimens, and on quality controls for molecular diagnostics, was considered similar to or better than that of other manual and automated NA extraction platforms [10], [11], [12], [13], [14], [15], [16], [17], [18], [19], [20]. However, the extraction procedure was not fully automated: sample loading, homogenization of the lysed sample with silica, and recovery of eluted NA at the end of the process, all required human intervention. The third generation of the NucliSENS\u00ae miniMAG\u00ae and easyMAG\u00ae family, to be available in the last quarter of 2016, has been designed to fill these gaps. Based on the same extraction technology and using the same reagents and disposables as NucliSENS\u00ae easyMAG\u00ae, eMAG\u2122 offers a significant gain in terms of automation, allowing simultaneous extraction of 48 samples directly from primary tubes, and distribution of NA extracts in PCR strips or tubes. It was first necessary to show that this gain in practicability did not undermine viral NA extraction performance by comparison with NucliSENS\u00ae easyMAG\u00ae.",

They consisted of respiratory samples (n = 199), whole blood (n = 50), EDTA plasma (n = 25) and urine (n = 25) specimens described in the next paragraph. All the samples had prospectively tested positive for at least one virus at the time of diagnosis, as part of standard-of-care orders by clinicians, and had then been stored at \u221280\u00b0C. Their minimal volume was 400 \u03bcL, allowing simultaneous extraction of identical volumes (200 \u03bcL) on the NucliSENS\u00ae easyMAG\u00ae and eMAG\u2122 instruments, prior to real-time PCR and RT-PCR. The nucleic acids extracted from a given sample on the two platforms were amplified in the same run. The same thermocycler was used throughout the study. The samples were only tested for the initially diagnosed virus. Testing of respiratory samples also included cell control detection.

Overall agreement was 95.9% (423/441), with specific agreement of 93% (225/242) and 99.5% (198/199) for respiratory virus and cell control detection, respectively (Table 1). Eight samples positive at initial diagnosis were retrospectively found to be negative following both eMAG\u2122 and easyMAG\u00ae extraction. The extraction of a sample volume of only 200 \u03bcL in this study, instead of the 400 \u03bcL prospectively tested on receipt of the respiratory specimens for virological diagnosis, is likely to explain this discrepancy. However, nucleic acid degradation during specimen storage cannot be ruled out either. Discrepant results between the two extraction platforms were well-balanced between eMAG\u2122 (n = 10) and easyMAG\u00ae (n = 8). They corresponded to 9 respiratory viruses and 1 cell control not detected following eMAG\u2122 extraction, and 8 respiratory viruses not detected after easyMAG\u00ae extraction. No significant association was found between these discrepancies and the nature of the viral nucleic acid (RNA or DNA), a specific virus species, single or multiple viral infections, or the type of respiratory sample (not shown). Ct values for discordant respiratory samples exceeded 33 (mean 35.6 \u00b1 3) in all but one case (Ct 28.9 after easyMAG\u00ae extraction; not detected after eMAG\u2122 extraction). Ct values obtained with eMAG\u2122 and easyMAG\u00ae correlated well with an R2 of 0.923 for respiratory virus detection and 0.834 for the cell control (Fig. 1\n). The mean differences for individual respiratory virus detection between eMAG\u2122 and easyMAG\u00ae (Fig. 1A, right side) ranged from \u22120.6 for influenza B virus to 0.8 Ct for bocavirus. It was 0.1 Ct for the cell control (Fig. 1B).",

Its performance was compared, using various clinical specimens, to that of its predecessor, easyMAG\u00ae, which has been thoroughly evaluated [10], [11], [12], [13], [14], [15], [16], [17], [18], [19], [20]. Our study included about three hundred clinical samples consisting mainly of respiratory specimens but also of whole blood, plasma and urine. The results were assessed for qualitative targets consisting of respiratory viruses, in both single-virus and mixed viral samples (plus cell control detection), as well as quantitative targets, represented by CMV, EBV, HHV6 and BKV viral load. We found good agreement on qualitative results, ranging from 84.6% for whole blood to 95.9% for respiratory samples. Fourteen false-negative results were assessed following eMAG\u2122 extraction of 9 respiratory samples and 5 whole blood specimens (1 CMV, 1 EBV and 3 HHV6). However, based on the equal number of false-negatives between the two platforms as well as on the Ct values of the discrepant results, most of the time higher than 35 cycles, it is very likely that there is no difference in extraction efficiency between easyMAG\u00ae and eMAG\u2122 and that the discrepant results reflected target-load of the samples around the limit of detection leading to a stochastical chance on detection. Regarding the clinical relevance of the missed positive samples, they involved respiratory viruses other than influenza and thus would not have led to a delay or lack of treatment by neuraminidase inhibitor. For herpesviruses, the viral loads were low, with Ct values >37 Ct, and would likely have had no effect on therapeutic management in closely monitored patients. In quantitative terms, a good correlation of viral loads was also found, with R2 ranging from 0.802 to 0.995. Average overall differences between eMAG\u2122 and easyMAG\u00ae were less than 0.10 log10 copies/mL. These results allowed us to conclude that, in our hands, the two platforms have comparable performance, whether on respiratory, whole blood, plasma or urine specimens.",

This suggests more efficient DNA extraction from whole blood with eMAG\u2122 than with easyMAG\u00ae; indeed, by comparison with other specimens, whole blood sample extraction is reported to require a larger volume of silica and lysis buffer on the easyMAG\u00ae platform [14].

The eMAG\u2122 manages NA extraction directly from primary sample tubes (from 1.5 to 14 mL), thereby avoiding the need for manual distribution in sample vessels, which is time-consuming and a source of error. It is then to take into account a dead volume of 50\u2013245 \u03bcL, depending on the size and shape of the input tube, and this may be an issue with precious clinical samples such as cerebrospinal fluid and aqueous humor. Note that manual sample loading is still possible, even in tandem with automated loading in the same run. The eMAG\u2122 also automatically distributes the internal control (IC2), which is necessary to check the extraction process and the absence of amplification inhibitors in the sample, and silica limiting again here hands-on time. Higher degree of automation of sample and reagent distribution would suppose a lower level of inter-run variation that was, however, not evaluated in the present work since the cell control does not allow this analysis and there are too few data with IC2. Finally, NA eluate transfer is possible in output tubes consisting of individual PCR tubes or strips from 0.2 to 2 mL. This new platform is thus likely to significantly reduce the sample processing time for PCR analysis, to improve the standardization and traceability of sample extraction, and to limit the risk of error through automatic distribution of clinical samples and reagents. However, it is noteworthy that extraction of one whole blood sample was invalidated on the eMAG\u2122 platform during our study, because a precipitate formed when silica was added to the lysis buffer containing the specimen, preventing further sample handling by the instrument and leading to a system error. With the easyMAG\u00ae platform, the manual homogenization step allowed us to resuspend the precipitate, thereby enabling sample extraction. A similar issue might arise during automatic collection from a primary tube containing a non-homogeneous clinical sample such as viscous respiratory secretions or a blood sample containing a clot. It might be advisable to systematically transfer certain samples, such as bone marrow or distal respiratory specimens, to a secondary tube in order to ensure fluidity before positioning on the eMAG\u2122 instrument.",
