This novel virus caused severe morbidity and mortality in pregnant women [2\u20134] and younger adults with 87 % of deaths occurring in persons younger than 65 years of age [5]. In addition to the human toll, annual influenza epidemics and pandemics carry substantial economic consequences in health-care utilization costs, intervention costs, and reduced productivity.

Information on influenza-like illness (ILI), influenza hospitalizations, influenza and pneumonia associated mortality, influenza-associated pediatric mortality, and laboratory testing of a subset of specimens from patients with ILI to characterize the circulating viruses are reported. These surveillance systems are resource-intensive [13, 14] and require sustained funding for epidemiologic and virologic information gathering at the national and local levels [15]. Enhanced and timely syndromic surveillance methods that use electronic health records (EHR) could improve the assessment of influenza medical and economic disease burden and associated risk factors leading to identification of at risk population groups, targeted and appropriate public health interventions, and estimates of economic burden associated with the disease [14, 16\u201318]. EHRs capturing information using the International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM) codes lend themselves to efficient quantitative analyses and have been used in numerous epidemiologic studies and influenza surveillance [14, 17, 19\u201321].",

Traditional influenza surveillance data are based on laboratory testing of a limited number of samples, case reporting by participating health care providers, hospital-based primary data, and deaths reported by statistics offices [24]. Data extracted from electronic medical records can enrich reporting of risk factors for disease severity or clinical diagnoses, even in the absence of laboratory testing, and augment the traditional surveillance. In addition, monitoring patients EHRs may enable detection of disease outbreaks for which no laboratory diagnostics were requested including emerging pathogens and biothreat events [25].",

The data on circulating influenza viruses and the disease activity including incidence, morbidity, and mortality is collected year round, compiled, and published weekly with a 1\u20132-week reporting delay [25]. Influenza virologic surveillance throughout the USA is conducted by approximately 140 laboratories comprising the WHO and National Respiratory and Enteric Virus Surveillance System (NREVSS) laboratory networks. They collect information on the proportion of influenza A and B positive respiratory specimens and determine influenza A subtypes. A subset of the influenza positive samples, especially if the subtypes cannot be determined by standard diagnostic tests, are sent to CDC for further characterization by gene sequencing to monitor emergence of novel viruses and antiviral resistance [23]. The second component of the surveillance system is the Illness Surveillance Network (ILINet) comprised of approximately 3,000 health-care providers voluntarily reporting all outpatient visits and the number of visits due to influenza-like illness (ILI) stratified by age group. The percentage of weekly ILI visits weighted to reflect the population size of reporting states are compared to the national baseline of ILI visits outside of influenza season to monitor ILI activity levels in each state [23]. Vital statistics offices in 122 participating US cities report the total number of deaths and the number of deaths caused by pneumonia or influenza (P&I) stratified by age groups. Statistical methods are used to calculate the weekly level of P&I mortality above the seasonal baseline or epidemic threshold. In 2004, pediatric influenza-associated mortality for children 0\u201318 years of age became a nationally notifiable condition. Influenza Hospitalization Network comprised of hospitals in over 80 counties in 14 states collects information from hospital records and reports on laboratory-confirmed influenza hospitalizations for children and adults. The information on geographic spread of influenza activity is augmented by State and Territorial health department epidemiologists\u2019 reports [23].",

            "text": "In addition to the active surveillance efforts, alternative methods such as syndromic surveillance, electronic patient records from emergency room or ambulatory doctor visits, and hospital discharge records have been used for surveillance of influenza and other infectious diseases with growing frequency [19, 20, 27, 33]. Syndromic surveillance provides clues on disease patterns collected from multiple information sources such as emergency department visits, ambulatory health-care visits, calls to health information hotlines, Internet health information seeking, and over-the-counter medication purchases. Indication of potential disease outbreak from syndromic surveillance is usually available before laboratory test results are reported [14]. ESSENCE, the Electronic Surveillance System for the Early Notification of Community-based Epidemics is an example of syndromic surveillance system implemented by the Department of Defense (DoD) to automatically download data from the electronic health records of military personnel and their families. The system captures information coded in accordance with the International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM) standards from over 300,000 weekly outpatient visits to US military treatment facilities [17]. It monitors disease outbreaks based on health care utilization patterns and uses ICD-9-CM codes to group diagnosis into one of the eight disease syndromes. Another national electronic surveillance system, BioSense, launched in 2003 and operated by the CDC collects and analyzes ICD-9-CM coded data from outpatient visits to health-care facilities and emergency departments, hospitalized patients, laboratory tests, and information on over-the-counter medications sold in pharmacies [34]. Although different studies reported variable utility of syndromic disease surveillance systems for local disease outbreaks, the majority of them indicated that it was useful for monitoring respiratory disease activity and the annual influenza seasons [19, 35, 36]. Sensitivity of ICD-9-CM based detectors of acute respiratory disease and influenza epidemics varied from 44 to 79 % for acute respiratory disease to 100 % for influenza outbreak [37] and specificity ranged between 96 and 97 % [20, 27]. Sensitivity was found to be moderate and likely not sufficient to detect a small disease outbreak, e.g., in the event of a local bioterrorism incidence. However, ICD-9-CM coded data can be useful for influenza surveillance when accuracy, completeness, and timeliness are carefully considered [29] before using such data for decision making.",

This data enables characterization of severe ILI, identification of at risk population groups, tracking of genetic changes in the circulating viruses, and serve as a monitoring tool for emerging pandemics [38]. Hospital based case series studies yield valuable information on risk factors for sever influenza during an ongoing or past influenza seasons. Although these studies can inform vaccination and therapy decisions, majority of them have a limited sample size, are recourse intensive, and the results are not generalizable on the national level. The lack of this data became especially apparent during the 2009 H1N1 pandemic when the disease incidence rate was very high resulting in declaration of phase 6 pandemic while the disease severity on a national level was not ascertained [28]. Hospital-based electronic surveillance is a cost-effective approach to identify influenza season-specific populations at high risk for ILI complications and fatal outcomes. Detailed clinical information on each individual case is coded in patients\u2019 records and can be used to augment active surveillance in public health response planning and implementation [16].",

The accuracy of the ILI estimates was 85\u201396 % as compared to the actual disease incidence reported by CDC influenza surveillance [25]. A Health Map Web based data collection system was employed during the 2009 H1N1 pandemic to monitor the Internet, compile, and report influenza activity in geographically diverse locations through an interactive map. Data was collected from news media, blogs, and other nontraditional sources as well as from the WHO, CDC, and the public health agency of Canada. The median lag between reported and confirmed cases ranged from 9 to 18 days with considerable variations between the countries influenced by public health infrastructure, political system restricting information, and media coverage. The nontraditional information sources may enable earlier detection of outbreaks and epidemics, expand population coverage, improve sensitivity of emerging diseases detection, and place the epidemic or pandemic in the context of the affected population [40].",

Analyses of electronic medical records were employed to augment the traditional approaches [17, 18] during respiratory seasons in the USA. Standard surveillance was not sufficient during the recent influenza 2009 H1N1 pandemic when several states, including New York [41], Wisconsin [42], and California [43] implemented additional information gathering methods based on electronic medical records to gain a more complete understanding of the ongoing pandemic severity. EHR-based surveillance systems such as Electronic Medical Record Support for Public Health (ESP) implemented in Ohio and Massachusetts and BioSense were successfully used for analyzing ICD-9 diagnosis codes, reporting notifiable disease cases, surveillance of ILI, identification of influenza or upper respiratory infection risk factors among hospitalized patients, and for monitoring diabetes prevalence, risk factors, and disease severity [13, 19]. The results of influenza risk factor analyses based on ICD-9 coded data overall agreed with earlier observations based on primary data collected through the Emerging Infections Program during 2005\u20132008 influenza seasons [44] and in Manitoba, Canada during 2009 H1N1 pandemic [45] as well as with laboratory confirmed influenza hospitalizations reported to the CDC during the 2009 pandemic [17, 46, 47] demonstrated that optimally selected ICD-9 code groups can be used in an automated surveillance system drawing information from electronic medical records for accurate monitoring of influenza activity. In this study of the US Air Force personnel and their dependents outpatient visits the syndromic surveillance results correlated with the results of sentinel ILI surveillance conducted by the CDC. Placzek and Madoff (2011) used administrative hospital discharge records to estimate the hospitalization rates and characterize patients hospitalized with ILI during the seasonal flu epidemics and the 2009 H1N1 pandemic in Massachusetts. They evaluated two sets (\u201cmaximum\u201d and \u201cminimum\u201d) of ICD-9 diagnosis codes for their relevance and accuracy in identifying influenza-associated hospitalizations and disease severity and concluded the proposed minimum ICD-9 criteria more accurately reflected the actual influenza cases. ICD-9 coded diagnosis alone or in conjunction with other electronic health data were used in monitoring of ILI severity and risk factors [18, 48, 49], and for modeling early detection of local respiratory disease outbreak [24]. This approach was adopted for other disease surveillance, such as SARS [50], diabetes incidence and management [13], and pertussis [51]. The study results suggest that timely ILI surveillance is feasible using ICD-9-CM coded electronic medical records and emphasized the importance of the appropriate ICD-9-CM code selection for case definition for accurate assessment of disease activity and severity [18, 20].",

To date, no study has been conducted using a large sample of electronic health records (EHR) to examine the risk factors for influenza in hospitalized patients across the USA. Larger data sets of EHRs will enable the creation of statistically significant age-specific models of influenza severity and predict more representative influenza risk factors and vulnerable groups. A recent study utilized the Nationwide Inpatient Sample (NIS) which is a repository of eight million electronic hospital discharge records from 1,000 participating hospitals in over 43 states representing approximately 20 % of all US hospitalizations [7]. This data source is maintained by the Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project (HCUP) sponsored by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ). Results from the retrospective unmatched case\u2013control study of NIS patients hospitalized with influenza during the 2009 H1N1 pandemic and severe A/H3N2 2007\u20132008 epidemic seasons confirmed the utility of using an existing electronic resource to identify comorbidities and demographic risk factors for severity of clinical outcomes associated with pandemic and epidemic influenza viruses [21]. The use of primary diagnosis ICD-9-CM codes 487.xx\u2013488.xx to correctly identify influenza hospitalizations from NIS was verified by comparing the temporal trends of monthly hospitalization counts identified in NIS records (Table 29.1) with influenza cases reported by the National Respiratory and Enteric Virus Surveillance System WHO/NREVSS and Hospitalization Surveillance Network (FluSurv-NET) during the 2007\u20132008 and 2009 influenza seasons (Fig. 29.1).\n\n",

Integration of ICD-9 diagnosis codes into more complex disease detection algorithms can further improve the sensitivity and specificity of surveillance systems based on electronic medical records [52]. However, this approach is limited if electronic records are fragmented between different providers using different disease algorithms whereas the ICD-9 codes even though potentially less specific are standardized among all users and may be more applicable to nationwide surveillance [13]. Further standardization of data coding and selection criteria, and interoperability among private and government surveillance efforts has the potential to enhance the electronic data quality and timeliness [14, 18]. This methodology can be especially advantageous for public health applications as it uses routinely collected data and requires modest investments for maintenance and operation [50].",

Antigenic drift due to mutations in HA and NA genes allows the virus to evade preexisting antibodies in the human immune system conferring the pathogenicity and virulence. Antigenic shift occurs when influenza viruses containing diverse HA and NA subtypes coinfect the same host, triggering a reassortment event and producing progeny with genomic segments from both parental viral subtypes [53]. Wild birds are the natural reservoir for influenza viruses. Sixteen hemagglutinin and nine neuraminidase influenza A subtypes were isolated from aquatic birds and only the most recent HA17 was isolated from fruit bats [60]. According to the mixing vessel theory, pigs are considered the main mammalian host where the adaptation of an avian influenza viruses to human host and reassortment events occur [61]. Pigs\u2019 cell-receptors match both human and avian influenza, rendering them susceptible to infection with viruses from both hosts [53]. Influenza A viruses have been also isolated from other animals, including a horse, dog, cat, tiger, and leopard [59]. Influenza Type B and C is rarely found in hosts other than humans, although influenza B has been found in seals and influenza C has been reported in swine and dogs [53].",

During seasonal epidemics and pandemics, each case transmits the virus at 2\u20133 day interval to 1.1\u20131.8 and 1.5\u20135.5 individuals respectively [65]. The human-to-human transmission occurs in one of the three ways: direct contact with infected persons, touching object contaminated with the virus and then transferring it from hands to mucus surfaces of the nose or eyes, and inhaling virus-containing droplets produced by infected person when coughing or sneezing [66, 67]. The efficiency of influenza transmission aerosolized in droplets depends on the size of the droplet, viral concentration, and humidity. Yang and Marr (2011) demonstrated that the concentration of infectious influenza virus in cough droplets is inversely related to the relative humidity (RH) in indoor settings, while the droplet size is directly related to relative humidity. In a dryer environment, the smaller droplets tend to stay in the air longer, infecting larger number of sensitive hosts. In a humid environment, the virus in large droplets settles on objects (fomites) and can survive for several days. Viable influenza viruses in mucus were detected on paper money bills after 48 h and in some cases up to 17 days [68].",

            "text": "In temperate climates, influenza epidemics occur in a seasonal pattern during the colder months of the year, while in the tropical climates, influenza circulates all year round with patterns associated with rainy seasons. Multiple reasons for this periodicity such as sunlight, temperature, humidity, human mobility, and contact rates, and functions of the immune system have been explored without arriving at a definitive conclusion [69, 70]. Yang and Marr (2011) suggested that the winter seasonality can be partially explained by higher concentration of droplet-suspended influenza viruses in heated buildings due to lower humidity. Other environmental factors, such as colder temperature and reduced ultraviolet radiation, are also independently associated with virus survival and seasonality. Temperature and humidity also effect the human immune system, diminishing the blood flow and leukocyte supply in low temperatures while increasing viral shedding [69]. Lowen and Palese (2011) confirmed that cold and dry conditions facilitated viral transmission through aerosolized droplets, while warm or humid environment (30 \u00b0C, 80 % RH) prevented the viral spread. They proposed that seasonal pattern of influenza epidemics in temperate climate occurs due to viral transmission by aerosolized droplets, while year-round infections occur through fomites or direct contacts in tropical climate. The exception to this pattern was the 2009 spring outbreak of the swine-origin influenza A H1N1, which possibly could be explained by the increased frequency of transmission via direct contact due to the absence of human immunity to the novel antigenic strain. Variations in temperature and humidity did not affect viral spread by direct contact [66].",

Human infections with the novel triple reassortment swine origin virus pdm2009H1N1 were first detected in Mexico and then in California in April of 2009, followed by the declaration of public health emergency in the USA [79].

In a review of studies characterizing the disease severity in the beginning of the 2009 H1N1 pandemic, Falagas et al. (2010) found a wide range of hospitalization rates (0\u201393.8 %), ICU admission rates (0\u201336.4 %), and fatality rates (0\u201338.5 %) among influenza cases. The fatality rate was significantly higher (25\u201341.4 %) among patients admitted to the ICU. A prospective study in Canadian population measured the outcomes of severe 2009 influenza A (H1N1) cases as mortality, length of stay (LOS) in an ICU, and duration of mechanical ventilation. In this study of 215 critically ill patients, 81 % required mechanical ventilation, the median ICU stay was 12 days, and 17.3 % died within 90 days [94].",

Regardless of asthma severity, its prevalence tends to grow with escalating influenza disease severity [99]. Influenza virus infection is known to exacerbate asthma and asthma is a known risk factor for influenza infection. It was the most frequently reported underlying medical condition in pediatric deaths associated with influenza A/2009 H1N [83]. The impact of asthma may also depend on the circulating influenza viruses. In a Canadian studies of pediatric population hospitalized with influenza, children with pandemic H1N1 influenza in 2009 were significantly more likely to have asthma (22 %) than those with seasonal influenza during the 2004\u20132009 seasons (6 %) although there were no difference in severity or clinical presentation of asthma between the pandemic and seasonal pediatric influenza cases [108]. Asthma was also more prevalent among the children admitted to ICU with pH1N1 and developing pH1N1-associated pneumonia compared with seasonal influenza in 2006\u20132009 [109]. Patients with chronic lung and airways diseases such as COPD are at a greater risk for severe morbidity and mortality associated with influenza infection. Evidence suggests that bacterial coinfections in COPD cases may further impact the disease severity. In a study of patients hospitalized with severe COPD in Italy, viral infection was detected in 23.4 % and viral-bacterial coinfection in 25 % of patients hospitalized with COPD exacerbation. Influenza was one of the most frequently identified infections adversely effecting lung function and extending hospital stay [110]. Although many national guidelines recommend influenza vaccination, there is only limited evidence that vaccine is effective in COPD patients. However, some observational studies suggest that vaccine reduces both hospitalizations and mortality [111].",

Influenza surveillance data in Wisconsin and New Mexico during the 2009 H1N1 pandemic indicated that diabetes was the second most frequent comorbidity following asthma and was present in 16\u201320 % of hospitalized influenza cases [42, 105]. Van Kerkhove et al. (2011) reported that diabetes was an underlying chronic condition in 9 % of influenza-associated hospitalizations and 13.6 % of cases admitted to the ICU in a sample representing 19 countries with diverse populations and health-care systems. Diabetes was present in 8 % of influenza A/H1N1 associated fatalities in England [113], 14.4 % fatalities in a large international sample [99], and 29 % of fatalities in New Mexico [105]. The higher proportion of diabetes in New Mexico potentially could be due to a higher than 50 % obesity among hospitalized patients older than 18 years. Diabetes prevalence is on the rise in the USA, especially among the aging population, reaching almost 27 % prevalence among persons 65 years of age or older [114].

NNMD were the most prevalent chronic diseases associated with respiratory failure in hospitalized children with laboratory-confirmed influenza diagnosis followed by chronic lung and chronic heart conditions [9]. A study of pediatric deaths reported to CDC during the 2009 H1N1 pandemic showed that 43 % of case fatalities had neurologic disorders. Majority of the children also had additional comorbidities such as heart disease [117]. Adult patients who developed pneumonia as a consequence of influenza 2009 H1N1 infection were more than twice as likely to have a neurological disease compared to patients who had no complications [102]. Neurological disorders found among patients hospitalized due to influenza included Down syndrome, cerebral palsy, developmental delay, history of stroke [102], seizures, spinal cord injuries [90], neuromuscular disorders, hydrocephalus, and epilepsy [117]. Pediatric deaths due to pandemic influenza five times exceeded the annual average number of deaths caused by seasonal influenza viruses during the five proceeding seasons. Neurologic disorders were the most frequent comorbidities found in influenza-associated pediatric deaths [117] underscoring the importance of continues surveillance of disease severity and the need for timely characterization of risk factors during an ongoing influenza season.",

Obese persons consume high percentage of oxygen to maintain normal respiratory function; they have increased airway resistance and may suffer from hypoventilation and chronic inflammation of the respiratory tract altering the immune function and the ability to respond to challenges to respiratory system [119, 120]. The role of obesity as an independent risk factor may be difficult to ascertain, especially in studies with a limited sample size, as it is often directly correlated with other underlying health conditions (e.g., diabetes and heart disease) known to increase risk for influenza infections and severe outcomes [118]. However, because more than 35 % of adults in the USA [121] and 500 million worldwide [122] are obese it may be a major contributor to excess morbidity and mortality associated with influenza and warrants further investigation.",

Pregnancy was reported to be a risk factor for infection with influenza and severe disease outcome during the influenza A/2009 H1N1 pandemic as well. In a review of publications on 2009 H1N1 pandemic epidemiology in the Northern Hemisphere, Falagas et al. (2010) reported that 4.5\u201317.4 % of hospitalized cases were pregnant women and they comprised 11.5\u201318.2 % of ICU admissions. Compared to nonpregnant women diagnosed with influenza, they were seven times more likely to be hospitalized and twice more likely to have fatal outcomes [99]. In a UK study of a population with an estimated 6 % prevalence of pregnancy, 21 % of patients hospitalized with laboratory confirmed influenza 2009 H1N1 were pregnant and the majority of them were in the second or third trimester. The case fatality rate ranged between 1 and 6 % [2]. The rate of respiratory hospitalizations among pregnant women in Nova Scotia during non-pandemic influenza seasons between 1990 and 2002 was almost 8 times higher for pregnant women than the year before they became pregnant [124]. Pregnant women with comorbidities such as asthma, anemia, and heart or renal disease were at the greatest risk for influenza-associated hospitalization.",

In several countries as the level of disease severity increased the proportion of pregnant women diminished and the odds ratio for death among hospitalized pregnant women was <1 [99]. Interestingly, in a study of ILI hospitalized patients during the 2007\u20132010 influenza seasons, pregnancy was protective against pneumonia (OR 0.4), possibly due higher likelihood of hospitalizing pregnant women with severe respiratory infection [125]. This observation was supported by a UK study reporting that maternal outcomes were no more severe that for nonpregnant women of similar age hospitalized for influenza [2]. An increased susceptibility to influenza infection and severe disease among pregnant women could be partially explained by changes in immune response due to lower plasma levels of adiponectin regulating macrophage activity [119]. An additional explanation could be psychosocial changes that may occur during pregnancy such as perceived increased stress, anxiety, and negative mood which also were shown to alter the immune functions and increase the risk for respiratory tract infections [126].",

The odds ratio was 6.52 for the First Nation individuals being admitted to the ICU compared to other ethnic groups even when controlling for socioeconomic status, age, residency settings, comorbidities, and time to treatment [45]. Similar results for influenza severity were observed in the USA where the risk for pH1N1 influenza hospitalization in New Mexico was 2.6 times higher among American Indians, 1.7 times higher for Blacks, and 1.8 times higher for Hispanics compared to non-Hispanic Whites [105]. Surveillance data from 12 states showed that the rate of mortality attributed to pH1N1 was four times higher among the American Indians and Alaska Natives (AI/AN ) and they had the highest rate (81.0 %) of underlying health conditions than all other ethnic groups [128].

Persons younger than 65 years of age accounted for a greater proportion of deaths during all three pandemics in the twentieth century as well as during the 2009 H1N1 pandemic when young adults were at an increased risk for morbidity and mortality. Age was an independent risk factor for severe disease outcomes and death. In a study of hospitalized influenza cases in Washington State the odds of ICU admission or death were 4.4 and 5.9 times greater among adults 18\u201349 years and 50\u201364 years of age respectively compared with children younger than 18 years when controlling for other risk factors [11]. The lower influenza incidence rate and mortality among adults over 64 years observed during pandemics could be explained by antigen recycling mechanism, a partial protection due to earlier exposure to a similar virus [65]. However, if infected, this age group had the highest mortality rate among the hospitalized patients [99] potentially due to the presence of comorbidities, effect of medications, and bacterial coinfections. Explanations for severe disease among young adults included antibody-dependent enhanced infection and strong inflammatory response in the lungs leading to lung injury and ARDS [11]. Once infected with a novel influenza virus younger persons may retain long-lasting immunity better than older persons [130].",

The proportion of influenza-attributable deaths during the 1994\u20132000 influenza seasons in Canada increased with age from 2 % in 65\u201369 age group to 5 % in persons 90 years and older. The case fatality rate for influenza hospitalized patients increased from 4 to 30 % for population 50\u201364 years to 90 years or older respectively and over 90 % of deaths occurred in persons older than 65 years of age [12]. During the 2003\u20132004 season when Influenza A Fujian strain was predominantly circulating virus increased morbidity and mortality was observed among children younger than 5 years of age [90, 98] while children hospitalized due to severe influenza during the 2009 H1N1 pandemic were significantly older with a larger proportion older than 5 years of age as compared to pediatric admissions during the pre-pandemic influenza seasons [108]. Developing immune system and absence of immunity to circulating viruses in young children and weakened immune response to vaccination among the older adults renders both groups especially susceptible to seasonal influenza infection [11, 12, 99].",

During the 2009 influenza pandemic, only one third of the 70,000 hospitalized cases representing 19 countries had an identified chronic clinical comorbidity while approximately two thirds of hospitalized cases and 40 % of fatal cases did not have any identified preexisting disease. For the 2009 influenza pandemic, the overall difference in demographic and clinical factors between the disease severity groups and moderate disease controls suggests that age, sex, race, and all clinical conditions of interest showed overall statistically significant association with influenza severity. However, pregnancy was not associated with influenza severity for women of childbearing age [21]. The differences of risk factors and clinical outcomes in different countries further highlighted the need for country-specific and global surveillance as well as data sharing internationally [99].",

Susceptibility to influenza and severity of the disease is affected by multiple factors including characteristics of the circulating virus strain, genetics of the host, prior infection history, comorbidities, age, and environmental factors. The unpredictability of the virus\u2013host interactions and consequences to population\u2019s health underscores the need for continuous timely and informative influenza surveillance. Clinical surveillance is critical for identification of at risk population groups which also may change depending on the circulating virus as well as for monitoring the disease spread in the population and severity. Syndromic surveillance based on nonclinical indicators may contribute to a signal of epidemic spread and increase of cases. To better predict viral strains for effective vaccines and monitor novel emerging viral strains that could cause epidemics it is critical to continue and expand viral surveillance on an International level. While electronic surveillance based on nonclinical data such as over-the-counter medication sales, school absenteeism, and health information seeking may provide preliminary signs of potential infection spread, prompt release of electronic health records (EHR) containing diagnosis and clinical outcomes can lead to a more informative and timely disease surveillance. Increasing utilization of patient electronic records could play an important role in attaining public health objectives and complimenting other information sources.",
