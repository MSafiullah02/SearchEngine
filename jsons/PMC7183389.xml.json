At the end of month 9, we posit that those two factors plus two others are useful to consider in deciding whether to add PPC: (c) whether PF was offered at the end of month 3 and (d) number or percent of high-dose opioid patients at the end of month 9. Put another way, these factors are candidate moderators of the effect of the implementation strategies. We had also identified the existence of a health system\u2019s opioid prescribing policy as a candidate variable, but since both systems in the trial have such policies, the study offers no variation. Qualitative methods will be used to address two other important questions: (1) how the implementation strategies that make up systems consultation can be further specified, including adaptations made during the trial, and (2) whether a quantitative assessment can be developed to help decision-makers tailor systems consultation to different contexts. A tailoring assessment will be developed, based on a literature review and the findings of the pilot study [18, 21], to assess whether other system-, clinic-, and prescriber-level contextual factors also ought to be considered as tailoring variables in the decisions concerning whether to offer PF and PPC. We will then test the usefulness of these additional variables in the analysis of the trial.",

PPC will be available to all prescribers at clinics randomized to receive this strategy; hence, it is conceptualized in this trial as a clinic-level strategy in terms of its delivery. Peer consultants will be physicians or pharmacists with relevant experience in opioid prescribing and addiction medicine nominated by health system leaders to help their peers manage patients on long-term opioid therapy (e.g., how to manage the tapering of opioid doses for long-term opioid patients with clinically indicated dose reductions). Participating prescribers in clinics randomized to PPC (including nurse practitioners and physician assistants) will receive up to four quarterly consulting sessions over 12 months. Consultations will be delivered via videoconference or teleconference. Prescribers may choose to include other staff at their clinic (e.g., RNs, MAs) in these consultations as well. Prescriber peer consulting is highly resource intensive, but our preliminary research suggests that physician-to-prescriber interaction may be the most effective way to change prescribing behavior.",

This is a comparison between two of the four groups embedded in the trial (see Table 2). The sample size calculator for this comparison is a straightforward adjustment to the sample size calculator for a standard two-sample hypothesis test. The adjustment accounts for the clustering of prescribers within clinics through a variance inflation factor (VIF) of 1 + (m \u2212 1) \u03c1, where m is the (average) number of prescribers per clinic and \u03c1 is inter-clinic correlation coefficient (ICC) for MME at month 21 (t = 18). Based on intervention clinics in the R34 pilot data, the ICC was estimated to be \u03c1 = 0.14. Assuming an average of m = 6 prescribers per clinic (based on information from the new health systems that have agreed to participate), a Type-1 error rate of \u03b1 = 5% and \u03c1 = 0.14, a minimum of 64 prescribers in each group (11 clinics per group) will provide at least 80% power to detect a moderate effect size of d = 2/3 between the two implementation sequences on change in MME. Because we have four groups in this trial, the minimum total study sample size is 256 clinician prescribers, corresponding to roughly N = 40\u201345 clinics (depending on prescriber count).",

Traditional health economic approaches incorporate concepts from welfare economics and take a societal perspective towards decision analysis [36, 37]. Engineering economic analysis tends to have a narrower scope. Whereas health economic evaluation provides information primarily for policymakers, engineering economic analysis produces information primarily for the organizational leaders who ultimately make decisions about the adoption of evidence-based practices in their organizations. We adopt the perspective of the healthcare system (rather than society at large) in considering the incremental costs and effects associated with ratcheting up the implementation strategy. This perspective deemphasizes some societal costs (e.g., patient travel time) and effects (e.g., crime related to addiction) that are often considered in traditional cost-effectiveness analysis [38]. However, the health system perspective aligns with updated guidelines for cost-effectiveness that were re-issued in 2016 [39] that acknowledge the importance of the health care perspective for pragmatic purposes. The health systems we will work with, like many health systems, are Accountable Care Organizations, which means that they are responsible for their patients\u2019 total cost of care. The pragmatic optimization approach featured in this aim was designed in close partnership with our research collaborators to model the considerations healthcare decision-makers told us they actually use when making decisions about adopting and sustaining evidence-based practices.",

Specifically, we will test four different sequences and combinations of strategies (EM/AF, EM/AF + PF, EM/AF + PPC, and EM/AF + PF + PPC) to assess the effectiveness and cost of augmenting a systems-level, broadly based implementation strategy (EM/AF) with progressively more intensive strategies.",
