After all, the only infection that one can catch while using TM is a computer virus. To encourage the TM approach, nearly all health plans and large employers offer some form of coverage for TM services. Although the use of TM has increased over the last 2 to 3 years, rates of TM adoption among allergists are still low.3 In response to the current COVID-19 situation, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services and commercial health plans largely have waived co-pays for TM visits as a means to encourage utilization in this time of need, and allergists need to pay attention to this.4\n,\n5\n",

In addition, in an effort to get COVID-19 tests to the public more quickly, the US Food and Drug Administration has waived the normal regulations to expedite allowing test makers to market scientifically valid products in the United States.8\n",

For established patients where a physical examination is not required, any HIPAA-compliant video platform would work.10 In such situations, if a procedure is needed, patients could even be seen from their home if they have the appropriate video equipment. Because new patients require a physical examination, they may not be appropriate for this type of encounter unless digital examination equipment is available in the allergy office. If non\u2013high-risk providers are present in the office, low-risk procedures such as skin testing can be performed.",

Recent studies have demonstrated similar health outcomes for patients whether delivered in person or synchronously by a remote provider for various conditions including asthma.12 A 2015 Cochrane systematic review examined the impact of telehealth involving remote monitoring or videoconferencing compared with in-person or telephone visits for chronic conditions including diabetes and congestive heart failure.
