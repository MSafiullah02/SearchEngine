In relation to dengue infection, lymphopenia is frequently reported in infected patients7,8 and impaired cellular activation, migration9 and apoptosis10 have been considered a likely explanation of it. Previously, it has been proposed by our group and others that apoptosis is triggered by DENV replication11. In this context, we have shown that in vitro infection of human monocytes by DENV-2 triggers apoptotic cell death phenotype12. In addition, T lymphocyte apoptotic markers up-regulation was associated with cell activation in naturally infected DENV patients13. Importantly, coinfected patients with DENV and HIV presented increased CCR5 and CD107a expressions on T \u2013cell subsets indicating T cell activation/cytotoxicity and migration14.

            "text": "Considering that apoptosis may be involved in the DENV and HIV immunopathology, we assessed the frequency of apoptotic cell markers in circulating mononuclear leukocytes comparing groups of DENV, HIV monoinfected and DENV/HIV coinfected patients. Our data demonstrate that most treated HIV patients diagnosed with acute dengue disease had lower CD4 absolute counts and inverted CD4/CD8 T- cell ratio. With regard to apoptotic cell markers, CD4 T and CD8 T-cell subsets from DENV and DENV/HIV groups expressed low levels of anti-apoptotic molecule Bcl-2. Importantly, death receptor Fas/CD95 was up-regulated mainly on T- cells expressing low levels of Bcl-2. Monocyte subsets analysis showed decreased CD14++ CD16\u2212 classical monocytes frequency during DENV infection and increased CD14++ CD16+ intermediate ones in monoinfection and coinfection as well. The density of Bcl-2 on classical monocytes from DENV infected patients was lower as compared to coinfected ones. As demonstrated by apoptosis-related protein expression screening analysis, peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from DENV patients had increased expression of pro- and anti-apoptotic molecules. Additionally, DENV and DENV/HIV groups had increased expression of Bad and Bax pro-apoptotic proteins whereas catalase antioxidant protein was upregulated mainly in DENV/HIV. Our data suggest that immune scenario generated as a result of coinfection with HIV may be interfering in cell activation and death susceptibility during acute dengue infection. Further studies evaluating immune response of ART treated coinfected patients are of great importance for prevention and treatment of both infections.",

The lysate volume was adjusted for 250 \u03bcL/array, according to the manufacturer protocol. Two kits, both containing 4 nitrocellulose membranes each with 35 different anti-apoptosis antibodies printed in duplicate, were performed. After washes and immunodetection antibodies procedures, each membrane was treated with chemiluminescent reagents, covered with plastic wrap and exposed to X-ray film for 5\u201310 minutes. The positive signals on developed film were identified by placing the transparency overlay on the array image and aligning it with the three pairs of positive control spots in the corners of each array. Apoptosis array data on developed X-ray film were quantified by scanning the film on a transmission-mode scanner and the array image file was evaluated using image analysis software quantity One (Bio-Rad Version 4.6.3). A template analyze pixel density in each spot of the array was created and subtraction of averaged background signal from each one performed. Data were export to Microsoft Excel and the average signal (pixel density) of the duplicate spots pairs, representing each apoptosis-related protein, calculated. Corresponding signals of each duplicate spot were determined and compared to analyses changes in apoptosis-related protein levels between controls and patient samples. Finally, normalization of the signal intensity based on positive and negative controls values were performed.",

Kruskal wallis and Dunn\u2019s multiple comparison tests were used for all pairs of groups using GraphPad P sofware (version 6). P values < 0.05 were considered statistically significant. A two-dimensional heat map with hierarchical clustering was built, with the expression of the apoptotic markers in the Y dimension and the HIV, DENV and DENV/HIV groups in the X dimension. The cluster for protein markers was constructed using the Euclidean distance between the medians of the scaled values, and Ward as a linkage algorithm. We ran 1000 bootstrap replications to verify the clustering support. We constructed a Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to verify the distribution pattern of the studied analytes among the individuals. This technique reduces the dimensionality space to reveal the analytes that contribute more to a group profile differentiation. Each Principal Component (PC1 and PC2) represents the total variation (%) explained the distribution of the individuals along with the multidimensional space. In the PCA plot, the individuals are represented as colored points, and the variables are drawn as arrows. The length of each arrow is proportional to the contribution of each variable to the overall variance. In this plot, the angles formed by two arrows (variables) represent the correlation between them and the closer the angle, the higher the correlation between them from orthogonal, independent variables, to more collinear, highly correlated pairs. Cluster and bootstrap analyses were performed using packages gplots16 and pvclust18 respectively, and PCA analysis was performed using vegan19, all of them in the statistical environment17.",

During the extrinsic apoptotic pathway, the interaction between death receptor Fas/CD95 agonist and its natural ligand FasL promotes the recruitment of adapter proteins that in turn interact with caspase 8 to trigger the initial step of apoptosis36. We previously described phosphatidylserine exposure and DNA fragmentation on T lymphocytes besides increased Fas/CD95 death receptors expression and decreased Bcl-2 expression in naturally DENV infected patients13. Moreover, DENV-specific CD8 T cells were susceptible to apoptosis as demonstrated by Bcl-2 downregulation, Fas/CD95 upregulation and DNA fragmentation37. CD4 T cell depletion is more pronounced in coinfected patients suggesting that an apoptotic extrinsic pathway may be contributing to the T lymphocyte depletion. Persistent coinfection between GB virus C (GBV-C) and HIV lead to a slower disease progression and mortality in HIV infected patients38. Fas/CD95 expression was lower in GBV-C and non-treated HIV coinfected patients suggesting that reduced Fas/CD95-mediated apoptosis of T cells might be responsible for beneficial effect of GBV-C coinfection. Moenkemeyer and colleagues suggested that GBV-C inhibit host cell apoptosis and consequently maintain chronic GBV-C infection. In agreement with our study, Fas/CD95 expression on T cells were not significantly different in patients receiving ART and degree of Fas/CD95-expressing lymphocytes was comparable between GBV-C co-infected and GBV-C infected39. A recent study demonstrated that apoptosis of platelets were similar between DENV infected and coinfected with HIV as evidenced by phosphatidylserine exposure, mitochondrial membrane potential and caspase -9 activation26.",

CD14++CD16\u2212 classical monocytes presented high phagocytic activity and they are critical for initial inflammatory responses while CD14++CD16+ intermediate monocytes are associated with inflammatory response, and CD14+CD16++ non-classical are considered as patrolling monocytes21. Monocyte activation has been reported during DENV and HIV infections and they are associated with disease pathogenesis22,40. Our results demonstrated significant changes of monocyte subsets during DENV and DENV/HIV coinfection. As demonstrated previously41,42, we found that in the acute DENV infection, CD14++CD16\u2212 classical monocytes were significantly decreased while intermediate were increased. Similarly, an expansion of intermediate monocytes and a reduction of classical monocytes during coinfection were found. Monocytes play important roles in the innate and adaptive response and are key players in mediating anti-DENV immune responses. They are the main target cells of DENV infection and after activation produce pro-inflammatory mediators involved in dengue severity11. Perturbations of monocyte subsets were also found in treated HIV patients43,44. In agreement we observed that some HIV treated individuals presented increased percentages of intermediate and non-classical monocytes suggesting chronic immune monocyte activation despite virus suppression after ART. More importantly, we report, for the first time (to our knowledge) that DENV/HIV coinfected patients showed increased frequencies of CD14++CD16+ intermediate monocytes. Interestingly we found that, in the context of DENV infection, the MFI of Bcl-2 on CD14++CD16\u2212 classical monocytes were significantly lower as compared to DENV/HIV coinfection. Activation of apoptosis pathway by DENV infected target cells have been described previously11. Our group and others have previously shown that DENV is capable of apoptosis induction in infected monocytes by extrinsic and intrinsic pathways12,45. Is unknown whether apoptosis could occur as directed mechanism of viral dissemination and evasion or simply represents an appropriate host response to limit virus replication. More recently, it was demonstrated that a pro- survival protein, Bcl-xl, is involved in the survival of DENV, Zika virus (ZIKV) and Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) HuH7 infected cells. Suzuki and colleagues proposed that Flavivirus infection induces delayed cell apoptosis and consequently virus spread to neighboring cells leading to higher viral loads and disease severity. Bcl-xL inhibition accelerates apoptosis leading to enhanced viral clearance through macrophage phagocytosis46.",

Additionally, pro-apoptotic proteins involved in extrinsic apoptosis (Fas/CD95, TRAIL1, TRAIL2 and FADD) were down regulated in DENV/HIV and HIV, whereas these molecules were not downregulated in DENV infected. Our study confirmed extrinsic apoptotic death receptor Fas/CD95 and Bcl-2 family involvement in apoptosis regulation during DENV infection. However, other regulatory molecules might be involved in apoptosis of activated cells during infection. TRAIL appears to be capable of apoptosis inducement on T lymphocytes in DENV infected patients35. Matsuda et al. (2005) show that hepatocytes express TRAIL-RII and produce soluble TRAIL during DENV infection, undergoing apoptosis47. Endothelial cells infected by DENV-2 showed decreased TRAIL expression suggesting  evasion of TRAIL induced apoptosis48. Taken together, these results indicate that differential expression of apoptotic proteins observed in dengue monoinfection may be involved in apoptosis susceptibility during infection as reported previously11.",

It has been reported that HIV encoded proteins induce pro- and anti-apoptotic activities49,50. On the other hand, ART reduce direct cytopathic effect of viral proteins, immune responses to viral antigens and decreases spontaneous T cell apoptosis in successfully treated individuals51. PI as well as NRTI regimens induce intrinsic anti-apoptotic activity and consequently reduce lymphocyte apoptosis52,53. Indeed, most HIV patients of our study received PI and NRTI therapies. Although a reduction in immune activation and apoptosis can be observed after initiation of ART therapy54, viral latent reservoirs could support immune cell activation and CD4 T cell apoptosis55.

However, we demonstrated here several evidences supporting the concomitant up regulation of apoptosis in DENV/HIV coinfected patients corroborating previous data observed during DENV infection13. Importantly, pathogenesis of ART treated HIV patients with acutedengue disease remains largely unknown. In the present study, we report, for the first time that DENV/HIV coinfected patients show increased frequencies of apoptotic molecules on PBMCs. Further in vivo and in vitro studies are needed to evaluate the outcomes of coinfection in risk areas of Brazil, especially due co-circulation of other arboviruses of medical importance such as ZIKV and chikungunya virus (CHIKV). Further understanding about regulation of extrinsic and intrinsic apoptotic pathways during HIV coinfection is necessary to develop new therapies for both infections.",

Data were shown in a grid where each line represents a protein and each column represents a group of HD, DENV, HIV or DENVHIV samples. The color and intensity of each box were applied to represent changes of protein expression: Red represents up-regulated protein levels and green represents down-regulated ones.
