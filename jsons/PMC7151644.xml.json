Only eight pangolin species are present worldwide, four in Asia including China, and four in Africa. There is a growing interest in pangolin welfare, including the threats posed by poaching and the deforestation of their natural habitats (Hua et al. 2015). Most importantly, pangolins have become unfortunate icons for the international and domestic illegal trade in wildlife, and are the most trafficked mammal (Gaubert et al. 2018). Of the eight species, four are listed as vulnerable, two are endangered, and the remaining two are critically endangered on the International Union for Conservation of Nature Red List of Threatened Species (du Toit et al. 2017).",

Some pestiviruses (e.g. bovine viral diarrhea virus, border disease virus, classical swine fever virus) are well-known animal pathogens that cause severe disease including contagious hemorrhagic disease in pigs and respiratory and reproductive disease in cattle and sheep (Vilcek and Nettleton 2006; Valdazo-Gonzalez et al. 2007; Moennig and Becher 2015). Wildlife disease (e.g. wild boar and deer) due to pestiviruses has also been reported (Ridpath et al. 2008; Blome et al. 2017). Following the application of molecular and genomics methods of virus discovery, a number of novel pestiviruses have been identified in recent years, including those from bats, rodents, and harbor porpoises (Wu et al. 2012; Firth et al. 2014; Smith et al. 2017; Jo et al. 2019). Finally, pestivirus-like viruses have also identified in arthropods (Shi et al. 2016a) and arthropods collected from mammals (Harvey et al. 2018). Together, these data highlight the circulation of a diverse range of pestiviruses in a broad range of animal hosts.",

Currently, only two viruses have been defined in the genus: Colorado tick fever virus (CTFV) found in North America, and Eyach virus (EYAV) from Europe. Their RNA genome comprises twelve segments. Both viruses can cause severe disease in humans (Attoui et al. 2005; Moutailler et al. 2016), and are transmitted by ticks (Attoui et al. 2002). Recently, several novel coltiviruses have been characterized, including Tarumizu tick virus from Haemaphysalis flava ticks in Japan (Fujita et al. 2017), Kundal virus from Hyalomma anatolicum ticks in India (Yadav et al. 2019), Shelly headland virus (SHLV) from Ixodes holocyclus ticks in Australia (Harvey et al. 2018), and Tai Forest reovirus (TFRV) from free-tailed bats (Chaereophon aloysiisabaudiae) in C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire (Weiss et al. 2017). Hence, there is evidently a high diversity of coltiviruses in nature and many more are likely to be identified. To date, however, it is unknown whether coltiviruses are associated with wildlife disease.",

Likely contaminating viral sequences were excluded from the meta-transcriptomic data (Supplementary Table S2) using methods described previously (Asplund et al. 2019). In addition, the high frequency of retrovirus sequences was also excluded, as the majority of them probably were host genes, and some of them might be contaminating viral sequences, such as alpharetroviral and gammaretroviral sequences probably linked to laboratory components (Asplund et al. 2019). Finally, the putative viruses present in the blood, liver, spleen, lung, and kidney samples were confirmed by PCR. The quantity of the transcripts mapped to each viral contig was determined using the RSEM program (Li et al. 2010) implemented in Trinity.",

Genetic analysis revealed that all the sequences obtained from Sunda pangolins in this study fell into the M. javanica group, while the Chinese pangolins clustered with those of M. pentadactyla. Notably, three Sunda pangolins sampled here were very closely related to those from Indonesia, Malaysia, and Thailand and Singapore, with 99.9, 99.7, and 99.9 per cent nt sequence identity, respectively, indicating that they were most likely (illegally) imported into China from abroad. In contrast, the pangolin 3-Ruian (M. pentadactyla) clustered together with those from Taiwan/China, with 99.1 per cent nt sequence identity, suggesting that this animal was not imported. As no sequences related to the A. javanense mitochondrial 16S rDNA were available, we could not determine the origin of the A. javanense ticks collected from sick Sunda pangolins. Hence, a systemic effort should be considered to establish comprehensive databases for the speciation of arthropod vectors and as a tool for determining the geographic origin of the collected arthropods.",

Eight species of pangolins are present in Africa and Asia, with habitat loss and changes in their living environment seriously affecting their population status. Most importantly, pangolins have been greatly impacted by the illegal international and domestic wildlife trade for traditional medicine or meat (Zhang et al. 2015). Hence, pangolins are listed as vulnerable, endangered or critically endangered on the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species (du Toit et al. 2017). Notably, pangolins may also be threatened by epizootic pathogens, either present in their original habitats or in their new environments following translocation. Indeed, the translocation or trafficking of domestic and wild animals plays an important role in the spread of many epizootic pathogens (Lin et al. 2012; Kosmider et al. 2013; Peeler et al. 2015).",

Unfortunately, three animals died, whereas one recovered. To date, reports on pangolin disease have been rare and mainly limited to those caused by bacteria and parasites (Mohapatra et al. 2016; Jabin et al. 2019).

Herein, a novel pestivirus, designated DYPV, was identified in multiple organs in one of the sick pangolins [1-Dongyang (M. javanica)] that had clear pathological changes.

Recently, however, a novel pestivirus, named Fairfax Lookout virus, was identified in ticks (Ixodes trichosuri). However, given its phylogenetic position next to mammalian pestiviruses, as well as its the extremely low abundance, it was proposed that the virus was associated with the vertebrate host rather than from the tick itself (Harvey et al. 2018). In this study, DYPV was not only identified in the pangolins, but also in nymph ticks collected from the pangolins. However, DYPV was not found in the adult ticks also sampled from pangolin 1-Dongyang. Interestingly, although DYPV from ticks was closely related to that sampled from pangolins, there were \u223c2 per cent nt differences across the viral genome suggesting that they are separated by multiple transmission events. Phylogenetic analysis indicated that Sunda pangolins, including the pangolin 1-Dongyang, were most likely imported into China from Indonesia, Malaysia, and the Philippines (Fig. 6). In addition, A. javanense ticks have not found in Zhejiang province (Chen et al. 2010), DYPV was not identified in locally collected ticks, and we did not observe this virus in previous large scale tick sampling studies (Li et al. 2015; Shi et al. 2016a,b, 2018). Together, these observations suggest that the virus was probably imported from abroad with the illegal trafficked pangolin.\n",

In this study, a novel coltivirus, named LSPV, was identified in one of the sick pangolins [2-Lishui (M. javanica)]. Given the high abundance of LSPV in the meta-transcriptomic data, combined with the clinical features and pathologic changes appeared in the pangolin (2-Lishui), as well as the detection of LSPV in several organs, our data suggest that LSPV may have caused systemic infection and the death of the pangolin in question, although this will need to be confirmed with additional data.",

Interestingly, the virus genome lacks segments 6, 7, and 12, and it was proposed that these missing segments were not identified probably due to low similarities between TFRV and known coltiviruses (Weiss et al. 2017). Strikingly, as with TFRV, we were unable to identify viral segments 6, 7, and 12 in LSPV, despite the use of methods that previously obtained the complete genome of the highly divergent Jingmen tick virus (Qin et al. 2014). It is therefore clear that additional studies are needed to infer whether these segments are indeed absent from LSPV and TFRV. Finally, as pangolin 2-Lishui may have been imported from Indonesia (Fig. 6) it is possible that LSPV, like DYPV, was also imported into China.",
