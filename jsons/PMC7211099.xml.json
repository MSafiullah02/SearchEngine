Among them, 88 (41%) were severe cases and 126 (59%) were mild. Severe cases were older and often had comorbid conditions such as hypertension (36%). Neurological symptoms were reported in 78 (36%) cases, which involved central nervous system (CNS), peripheral nervous system (PNS) and skeletal muscles. The common neurological complaints include headache, dizziness, confusion, mild cognitive impairment, loss of smelling, altered taste, blurred vision, muscle pain, nerve pain and ataxia. The most common reported symptoms in CNS manifestations were dizziness (17%) and headache (13%). And the most common PNS symptoms were taste impairment (6%) and smell impairment (5%). In severe patients, 5 (6%) had strokes, 13 (15%) had cognitive impairment and 17 (19%) had musculoskeletal damage.4 Recently, loss of smell was confirmed in a study in the USA. A survey 1480 patients with influenza-like symptoms and concerns regarding potential COVID-19 found 102 patients tested positive for the virus and 1378 tested negative. They concluded that the loss of smell or taste was 10 times more likely from COVID-19 infection than other causes of infection.7 While the study will print next week in the NEJM, Washington post reported a story of \u201cHealthy people in their 30s and 40s, barely sick with COVID-19, are dying from strokes\u201d. The paper mentioned that about a dozen of young strokes form three major hospitals in New York and Boston will report this series next week.8 A French report showed that patients with COVID-19 had encephalopathy, agitation, confusion and brain abnormality on MRI.9\n",

In these patients, their nucleic acid examination can be negative. Nucleic acid test can have a false-negative result and with limited sensitivity. Hence, a CT of lungs and/or antibody test must be done. However, at this stage, these patients are still highly contagious.

The initial incubation phase is about 3\u20135 days, during which the virus is attempting to seed at the most peripheral and inferior parts of the lungs. Since it is a RNA virus, it may take several days to replicate to a significant amount and cause organ damages.11 One laboratory sign of early infection without fever and cough during this phase is the development of lymphopenia. Once clinical symptoms are onset, the patients may begin with neurological symptoms first. When neurological symptoms occur, complete blood count and lymphocyte count should be checked routinely. Mucosa is rich in angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE 2) receptors, and the virus enters the host via eyes, nose and mouth.12 Some healthcare providers were infected because they did not wear eye shield or goggles, medical gloves and only had surgical masks at the early stages of epidemic.13\n",

During this phase, lung CT shows the typical glassy appearance or acute respiratory distress syndrome\u2013like changes.2 The patient is now in trouble. Ventilator support may be needed. Due to cytokine-mediated autoimmune storm, multi-organ failure may follow. Opportunistic infection, such as staphylococcus and pneumococcus pneumonia, may begin followed by bacteremia.
