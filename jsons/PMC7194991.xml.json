Prior to understanding the cause of illness, clinicians in Wuhan, China, isolated suspected patients with respiratory precautions and fit-tested N-95 masks (Huang et al., 2020). These N-95 masks are known to prevent up to 95% of small particles, including viruses, from entering the respiratory tract (Kirby, 2020). All health care personnel working with infected patients should have their serum tested before and after exposure to ensure there is no asymptomatic infection that can increase transmission to others. Protocols are being implemented to establish (when possible) serum pretesting and posttesting in personnel working with known infected patients.",

Hand sanitizer is an effective alternative if soap and water is not readily available, such as in public places. Next is avoidance of touching the mouth, nose, or eyes to prevent the spread of viral particles to at-risk areas of the body (Fig. 1\n). Given that the average person touches their face up to 2000 times per day, guidelines recommend judicious handwashing to prevent self-inoculation (Kwok et al., 2015). Commonly used household areas should be cleaned and disinfected with 70% alcohol or chloride-containing wipes. This is true for doorknobs, taps, and children\u2019s toys that can easily be placed in children\u2019s mouths. Avoiding crowded locations, such as amusement parks and hospitals, can help reduce the risk of transmission (Fig. 2\n). This is especially true for areas with a high level of tourism, such as airports and cruise ships.",

Exactly how effective surgical masks are is unknown, but at minimum they provide a direct barrier and should be worn by individuals who test positive for COVID-19 to reduce spread to others. Current guidelines do not recommend the use of surgical masks for healthy persons >6 feet from an infected individual; social distancing is the best defense against infection (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2020a, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2020b, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2020c, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2020d). Following these guidelines saves personal protective equipment for health care workers and caregivers. For caregivers, a surgical mask is required if within 3 to 6 feet of an infected individual (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2020a, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2020b, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2020c, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2020d). An N-95 respirator should be used if there is a need to be within 3 feet of an infected person or in a room during a procedure such as intubation that can cause aerosolization of the virus (World Health Organization, 2020).",

Appropriate hospital infrastructure includes negative pressure rooms, planned routes to evaluation areas, and properly staffed facilities with infectious disease and critical care support (American Medical Association, 2020). Individuals suspected of illness are to make contact with the hospital prior to entry into the facility. The designated health care official will then guide the patient to a contained triage area to have a noninduced sputum or nasopharyngeal swab collected for COVID-19 diagnostic testing. This reduces the chance of infecting those already critically ill in the hospital. Similar precautions are performed for suspected measles cases (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2019).",
