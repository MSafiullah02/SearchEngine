He was a young man from Codogno, a small town in the southern Lombardy on February the 21st. The day after National Government\u2019s restrictions fixed some areas of Lombardy as red zones and closed schools for COVID-19. At this point, Galeazzi Institute started to reduce the operating rooms and the number of elective operations since February 24th (Week 1). The following week, some more surgeries were allowed; in the meantime, the patients with less severe pain conditions started to decline spontaneously their attendance both for surgical procedures and for consultations (Week 2). On March 8th, the number of operating rooms (ORs) was reduced to 60% (Week 3) in parallel to regional and national lockdown, approved on the same day, and following the regional resolution delivered that established roles and duties of regional hospitals in order to face the spreading of the pandemic. Moreover, during this week, a dedicated COVID-19 OR was quickly set up. On March 14th, the orthopaedic network was rebuilt by an addendum to the regional resolution. Galeazzi Institute was identified as a hub for nondeferrable orthopaedic procedures (Table 1) and for minor orthopaedic trauma, while most of general hospitals and ICUs in the region were increasingly overloaded with COVID-19 patients. Since March 16th (Week 4), nearly all the surgery but acute trauma, acute infections, and malignant tumours resections were stopped in our institution. Also, cases to be, theoretically, performed according to regional rules (i.e. severe loosening or recurrent dislocations or rapid developing arthritis with bone necrosis) have been stopped as the widespread dissemination of COVID19 infections increased the risk of nosocomial infection. Since Week 4, only two or three ORs were running depending on the number of emergencies. Hence, during Weeks 5, 6, and 7, only trauma, acute orthopedic infections, and malignant tumours resections were performed both on COVID-19 positive and negative patients.",

During Week 4, in order to face the huge increase in the number of infected patients all around the region, even non-orthopedic COVID-19 patients were admitted to the hospital and were allocated in a separate department. Starting from Week 5, even the relatives of SARS-CoV2-negative patients were no longer allowed to access the hospital in order to further reduce the risk of infection. Since Week 5, all the hospitalized patients have been screened for COVID-19 infection with nasopharyngeal swab and allocated at time of admission in an observational area until the result of the test (usually taking 1 day) and then transferred to the COVID-19 department or to the non-COVID ones who were located on separate floors. Due to these restrictions and to the reduced nurse staff (in the meantime, the number of personnel in quarantine raised), the number of beds was reduced to less than a third (median 100; 364 beds including rehabilitation are usually occupied).",

The decrease continued up to 88% during Week 7 with only 47 admissions (4 oncologic cases, 41 trauma patients, and 3 others included 1 tendon rupture and 2 infections) (Table 3). The mean value of admissions in the first three weeks and the last four weeks in 2020 were both significantly decreased compared with 2019 (p = 0.0013, p < 0.0001). Moreover, considering the mean number of admissions in the first three weeks and the last four weeks (Fig. 1c), the two values were comparable (p = 0.96) in 2019, while they significantly differed in 2020 (p = 0.0001). In addition, the rehabilitation admissions declined from 414 to 69 (83.33%) (Table 2). The rehabilitation department was closed at the end of Week 4 due to the decreased number of patients and also to limit at the maximum the risk of nosocomial infection spreading while the hospital was reorganized to host non-orthopedic COVID-19 patients, on a separate floor. The planned surgical admissions declined from 2172 in 2019 to 664 in 2020 (69.42%), whereas emergencies increased from 158 (6.8% of admissions) to 268 (28.8% of admissions) in 2020 (69.62%), including network admissions and transfers from other hospitals (Table 4).

Then, in the time of the maximum spreading of COVID-19 infection, all the operations were postponed except for trauma, acute infection, and malignant tumours resections. This type of approach taken out by both health authorities and orthopaedic surgeons has several undoubtable reasons: to preserve resources for COVID-19 patients (staff, hospital beds, ICU, economy), to reduce the risks of contamination (of the staff, of the patients, of the whole community) in an \u201copen environment\u201d such as the hospital that is difficult to be controlled, and to guarantee a safe and effective rehabilitation time for the patients operated upon. The possible contamination rate in all the admissions was 3%, extremely low; nevertheless, old fragile patients are at major risk. For this reason, it looks reasonable to stop all the surgery \u201cthat can be postponed.\u201d A case by case discussion with the patients and the relatives about pros and cons of delaying surgery has been done in the most critical cases, sharing the decisions with the patients. An overall increase of mortality in trauma and orthopaedics patients was observed compared with the same period in 2019 that was clearly related to COVID-19.",

Nevertheless, the focus of the paper was to describe the huge changes in the orthopaedic practice during the pandemic. Another limitation is that, according to continuously changing protocols, the patients were screened for COVID-19 only after Week 4, so it may be possible that the number of SARS-CoV2 has been underestimated. Finally, we did not have results of any test at time of discharge for the negative patients and neither information after the hospitalization about changes in their clinical conditions. However, all the patients were in good clinical conditions at the time of discharge, including respiratory function.",

When the present emergency will be hopefully over, new challenges are waiting the orthopaedic community with longer waiting lists, the risk of recurrence of the COVID-19 infection, and probably limited healthcare resources. We hope that the efforts experienced by the orthopaedic staff of our institute could be of help for other colleagues facing a similar challenging pandemic in their countries.",
