To mitigate the effect of testing practices during the earliest stages of the epidemic, we have have (a) excluded week 9 from the early period; (b) conducted sensitivity analyses with the early period assumed to be week 11 only (rather than weeks 10-11). The results of those sensitivity analyses are presented here. Table S1 shows the estimates for the relative risk ( ) for different age groups for the later period (weeks 13-14, 2020) vs. early period (week 11, 2020). The estimates for the age groups 15-24y",

Similarly to the results of the analysis in the main body of the text, the highest estimate for the relative risk belongs to individuals aged 20-24y, followed by individuals aged 15-19y, 30-34y and 25-29y, with estimates of the relative risk for individuals aged over 35y and those aged 10-14y being lower. Table S2 fail to reach statistical significance compared to the corresponding estimates in Table 3 , presumably due to lower counts for the early period. On the other hand, the odds ratios for age groups 25-34y vs. 35-39y are significantly above 1 in the new analysis (compare to Table 3 ). For the age group 20-24y, the odds ratio relative to any other age group except for persons aged 15-19y for a case to be during the later vs. early period was significantly above 1.
