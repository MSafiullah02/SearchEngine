            "text": "Canine distemper virus (CDV) is a multi-host pathogen that can cause significant mortality in domestic, wild terrestrial and marine mammals. It is a major conservation threat in some endangered species. Infection can result in severe respiratory disease and fatal encephalitis. Diagnosis and disease monitoring in wildlife, and differentiation of CDV from rabies (a lifethreatening zoonotic disease that can produce similar neurologic signs), would benefit from the availability of a portable, point-of-care (POC) diagnostic test. We therefore developed a quantitative RT-PCR assay for CDV using shelf-stable, lyophilized reagents and target-specific primers and probes for use with the handheld Biomeme two3\u2122 qPCR thermocycler. Biomeme's extraction methodology, lyophilized reagents, and thermocycler were compared to our standard laboratory-based methods to assess sensitivity, efficiency and overall test performance. Results using a positive control plasmid for CDV showed comparable sensitivity (detection of 50 copies) and PCR efficiency between the two platforms, and CDV detection was similar between platforms when tested using a modified live CDV vaccine. Significantly higher Ct values (average Ct = 5.1 cycles) were observed using the Biomeme platform on known CDV positive animal samples. CDV detection using the Biomeme platform was similar in 25 of 26 samples from suspect CDV cases when compared to standard virology laboratory testing. One false positive was observed that was negative upon retest. The Biomeme methodology can be adapted for detection of specific targets, and this portable technology saves time by eliminating the need for local or international sample transport for laboratory-based diagnostics. However, results of our testing suggest that decreased diagnostic sensitivity (higher Ct values) relative to laboratory-based methods was observed using animal samples, so careful validation and optimization are essential. Portable qPCR platforms can empower biologists and wildlife health professionals in remote and low-resource settings, which will greatly improve our understanding of CDV disease ecology and associated conservation threats in wildlife.",

            "text": "Canine distemper virus (CDV), a Morbillivirus in the Paramyxoviridae family, is a multi-host pathogen that is found globally and has a wide host-range. All members of the order Carnivora are thought to be susceptible, and CDV exposure has also been described in several species of rodents, primates, suids, cervids, and elephants [1] . Significant mortality events have been described in terrestrial and marine mammals [2] , and disease and outbreaks in endangered African wild dogs (Lycaon pictus) [3] , Ethiopian wolves (Canis simensis) [4] , Amur tigers (Panthera tigris altaica) [5] [6] [7] , Amur leopards (Panthera pardus orientalis) [8] , Iberian lynx (Lynx pardinus) [9] , and black-footed ferrets (Mustela nigripes) [10] are considered potentially significant conservation threats to these species. Domestic dogs and mesocarnivores are known reservoir hosts [2, 6, 7] . The virus is epitheliotropic, lymphotropic and neurotropic, and clinical signs are often seen in the respiratory, lymphoid, gastrointestinal and nervous systems [11] . Common outcomes of infection include lymphoid depletion, hyperkeratosis, interstitial pneumonia (often complicated by opportunistic bacterial infections), and fatal encephalopathy.",

            "text": "POC diagnostics can help address many challenges in understanding CDV presence, transmission patterns, identification of disease outbreaks, and conservation threats in wildlife. Some of these challenges include access to animals and opportunistic testing across small and large geographic ranges, low density or elusive behavior of some target species, and absence of or limited monitoring efforts. Others challenges researchers face include limited expertise necessary for appropriate animal sample collection, handling, and storage (including maintaining a cold chain), absence of available laboratory testing and differentiating from disease such as rabies which can present with similar clinical manifestations, and/or logistical challenges related to permit processes needed for regional or international sample shipping for laboratory testing. These challenges are compounded in remote and/or low resource settings. POC diagnostics are increasingly providing opportunities for rapid testing by researchers while they are already collecting data in the field, or when handling sick or dead wildlife, and with the development and validation of more user-friendly kits, researchers have opportunities to overcome many of these obstacles and logistical challenges that would normally impede testing.",

The standard curve generated from the CDV positive control plasmid was also used to calculate the total CDV copy number in the RNA extracts from the vaccine control and clinical samples using the following equation solving for x (copy number): x = e ((ABS(y-b)/(m)) . Since we used 2 \u03bcL of template in each PCR reaction, we then divided the calculated copy number (x value) by 2 (copy number represented in 1 \u03bcL), and that number was then multiplied by the total RNA extract volume (amount of the final elution volume of each RNA extraction kit). Data was normalized in this manner to account for different elution volumes for each RNA extraction kit. This allowed normalization and comparison of total CDV viral copy recovery in the total RNA extract across platforms. The calculated copy numbers/sample from replicates were then averaged and graphed with standard deviations. PCR efficiency was calculated using the equation: e = (10 (-1/slope) -1) \ufffd 100).

Testing was performed on brain, lung, kidney, liver, and heart from 10 animals: pine martin (n = 1), beech martin (n = 1), European badger (n = 3), Eurasian otter (n = 1), and red fox (n = 4) (S1 Table) . We found 100% concordance in detection between the Biomeme platform and the virology lab in CDV detection in kidney (6 of 9 positive), liver (2 of 3 positive), heart (1 of 1 positive), and lung (5 of 7 positive) samples (Table 1) . We found that in brain samples, 6 of 6 were positive with the Biomeme platform while 5 of 6 were positive with the virology laboratory testing methods. Upon reviewing the Biomeme data from the positive Lutra lutra brain sample 2054, we observed an attenuated amplification curve in the positive result, amplifying and plateauing within 5 cycles. This sample was retested and confirmed to be negative by the Virology lab, and also negative using the Biomeme platform. Therefore we conclude that the initial test result was a false positive. Overall, 96.1% (25 of 26 samples) concordance was observed between platforms initially, and 100% concordance was observed after retest from suspect CDV cases.",

In addition, sensitivity (to 50 copies per PCR reaction) and efficiency (90-110%) were consistent between platforms with positive control synthetic plasmid, and the latter was well within acceptable limits for traditional laboratory methods [21, 24] . When compared across different tissue types from different species, and under different storage conditions (RNAlater\u2122, frozen), the Biomeme platform consistently detected CDV positive samples; however, the Ct values were generally higher than with traditional Qiagen RNA extracted samples. Several of the experiments with higher Ct values were conducted while examining only one variable, which allowed us to identify the Biomeme RNA extraction step as the likely cause for this difference in our tests. Further work is needed to determine if the reduction in viral detection is due to either reduced binding of all available RNA to the column or less efficient release of RNA off the column, and if any optimization can be done to improve recovery. We found that RNA extraction from swabs of tissue and whole tissue samples had a lower RNA recovery (0.5-2 logs lower) with the Biomeme methodology than with Qiagen extraction when normalized for total CDV viral RNA in the extract, ",

So, while overall CDV detection with both platforms was consistent, (26 of 26 after retest), the lower observed recovery of viral RNA with the Biomeme extraction methods, especially in samples with low viral load, has the potential to result in false negative results. Further testing with a variety of different viral titers will be beneficial in ascertaining how this kit performs in a variety of clinical CDV samples that contain low versus high viral loads. Nevertheless, given the portability of the platform, ease of use in the field, and consistent detection of CDV from known and suspect positive samples across tissue and sample types in our study, this platform is a useful point-of care testing tool for detecting CDV. RNAlater\u2122 is commonly used in the field as a method of preserving nucleic acids in tissue or swab samples from wildlife. We therefore tested the performance of the Biomeme platform with RNAlater\u2122 preserved tissues from known CDV positive cases. No observable differences in CDV viral recovery were seen in a comparison using swabs of fresh frozen or RNAlater\u2122 preserved tissues across platforms. Provided the samples are stored optimally according to the manufacturer's specifications for RNA preservation, RNAlater\u2122 is a suitable preservation method for samples and compatible using the Biomeme POC platform. However, given our small sample size, future comparisons between samples collected from animals with known high or low viral loads, or short and long term, ambient vs frozen RNAlater\u2122 archiving to test RNA preservation and degradation would be especially valuable to establish minimum detection thresholds for CDV using the Biomeme platform.",

IHC staining of CDV in the epidermal and follicular epithelial cells was consistent with the PCR results. Hair sample collection is easy, can be performed appropriately with minimal training, and can be opportunistically performed in live or dead animals making it a useful sample to collect from wildlife in the field or in a clinical setting. Non-invasive sampling reduces risk associated with handling sick or dead carnivores, especially those that could also be infected with rabies. Rabies is a zoonotic disease that can present with similar clinical neurological symptoms to CDV, and co-infection with both can occur [25] . There are currently no POC tests for rabies. However, a CDV negative POC test result from a non-invasively collected sample would serve to raise a higher suspicion of rabies or other neurologic disease processes for field personnel. In our testing, we found 100% concurrence in our results comparing the Biomeme and standard laboratory platforms. However, as mentioned above, higher Ct values were seen with the Biomeme platform (3.61 cycles, with a standard deviation of 2.01 cycles, n = 52 samples). When compared to other tissues types, the Ct differences across the hair samples were comparable, suggesting hair as a good, non-invasive sample for CDV POC testing. All raccoons tested in our study were found dead or euthanized after exhibiting clinical symptoms, so additional testing of hair samples comparing early, mid and late stage CDV infection will be especially valuable for determining if hair bulb is more or less valuable at certain stages of the disease.",

New developments for rapid, quantitative, reverse transcription, recombinase polymerase amplification (RT-RPA) and isothermal polymerase gene amplification (RT-iiPCR) techniques for CDV detection have been recently described [26, 27] . Field-capable equipment using these techniques is heavy (1.75 kg for a Genie III used in RT-RPA detection, and 2.1 kg for a POCKIT\u2122 iiPCR analyzer) and requires standard Qiagen commercial kits for RNA extraction. The latter require additional equipment and more reagents and time than the Biomeme M1 Sample Prep Kit\u2122, which can be used off-grid with solar power and without equipment such as centrifuges and heat blocks [14, 15] . The entire Biomeme POC platform is lightweight and very portable, and all of the equipment and supplies are able to fit in a standard sized backpack. The two3\u2122 thermocycler plus case is 28 cm x 25.4 cm x 12.7 cm, and at 0.5 kg, making it is considerably lighter than the Genie III or POCKIT\u2122 iiPCR analyzer. In our experience, the Biomeme equipment is also easier to use than other platforms, and, like their extraction kit, the Biomeme thermocycler can be used in remote field settings that lack electricity. When lyophilized, the reagents (lyophilized Go-strips\u2122) are also shelf stable and do not require cold storage. Biomeme also offers an option to include inhibition control lyophilized Go-strips\u2122 in cases where PCR inhibition may be problematic. In our field-tests using the Biomeme two3\u2122 qPCR thermocycler, when fully charged, we have successfully performed up to five consecutive thermocycle runs on a single charge, and the unit is compatible with and able to be charged by a solar-charged battery such as the Goal 0\u2122 (Goal Zero, Bluffdale, UT) (Seimon and Brown, unpublished results).",

It is considered among the most widespread multi-host pathogens [31] . CDV is a recognized conservation threat to a number of endangered carnivores. Our understanding of CDV ecology, disease transmission and infection outcomes is far from complete and advancing our knowledge is critical for mitigating its effects in wildlife. For example, CDV has become a major conservation threat to endangered populations of Amur tigers (Panthera tigris altaica) and Far Eastern leopards (Panthera pardus orientalis) in the Russia Far East [5, 7, 8] . This is in addition to the threats faced from poaching, habitat loss and tiger human conflict [32, 33] . Serological, genetic and demographic studies in domestic dogs and mesocarnivores are needed to determine the role that wildlife and domestic dogs play for both maintaining CDV in the environment and as a source of infection for tigers [6, 7] . Having a mechanism for rapid, effective, and field-friendly CDV diagnosis will improve conservation efforts to track disease spread and identify reservoir species, which will in turn lead to better methods for monitoring vulnerable populations and development of solutions to support the conservation of endangered carnivores in the wild. Additionally, adaptation of this platform to test for other pathogens will expand the utility of POC for health monitoring and disease surveillance in conservation, especially in remote, under-resourced regions, and can be a valuable tool in rescue and rehabilitation centers, shelters, and boarding facilities for wildlife and domestic animals as well.",
