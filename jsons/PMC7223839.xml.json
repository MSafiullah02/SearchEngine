            "text": "A growing body of research is concerned with the occupational stress and secondary trauma experiences of the intimate partner violence (IPV) and sexual assault (SA) workforce (Babin et al. 2012; Baird and Jenkins 2003; Bemiller and Williams 2011; Dworkin et al. 2016; Kulkarni et al. 2013; Slattery and Goodman 2009; The Texas Council on Family Violence, 2016). Yet gaps in knowledge remain about what fosters and sustains the well-being and tenure of the IPV/SA workforce over time. Research efforts have highlighted stressful work environments, resource constraints, and high employee turnover in this social service sector (Merchant and Whiting 2015; Mor Barak et al. 2001). The IPV/SA workforce is also among the most at-risk professionals for burnout and secondary traumatic stress (STS) (Baird and Jenkins 2003; Busch-Armendariz et al. 2010; Slattery and Goodman 2009; Ullman and Townsend 2007; Wies 2008). Occupational conditions such low pay, lack of organizational support, and a hostile work environment can reduce job satisfaction and increase turnover intention, leading to retention concerns (Wood et al. 2019). Nevertheless, recent studies highlight strong levels of commitment, mission attachment, and capacity to navigate crises, which may serve to keep IPV/SA workers in occupational roles despite challenging conditions (Wood et al. 2017; Bemiller and Williams 2011; Frey et al. 2017). In an effort to contribute to the scant evidence-base concerned with the positive outcomes of this critical work, this study examined factors associated with compassion satisfaction and the mediating role of coping behaviors among IPV/SA workers.",

            "text": "The IPV/SA workforce is at particular risk for negative workplace experiences due to the trauma- and crisis-oriented nature of the work (Wood et al. 2017; Babin et al. 2012; Baird and Jenkins 2003; Dworkin et al. 2016; Kulkarni et al. 2012; Slattery & Goodman, Ullman and Townsend 2007). Occupational stress can include compassion fatigue, which comprises employee burnout and STS (Stamm 2005). Burnout involves feelings of depersonalization, exhaustion, and difficulties doing one\u2019s job effectively, and is often associated with a very high workload or a non-supportive work environment (Stamm 2005). STS describes the occupational exposure to the trauma of clients and may involve difficulties sleeping, intrusive thoughts, or avoiding reminders of client experiences (Stamm 2005). Major factors linked to STS and burnout include lack of self-care, uncontrolled work stressors, unresolved trauma, and lack of job satisfaction (Radey and Figley 2007). Organizational factors including resource constraints, racism, bias, lack of control, high caseloads, and low quality of supervision are associated with higher levels of STS and burnout; individual factors such as age, time in the field, and insufficient leisure activities are also related (Wood et al. 2019; Dworkin et al. 2016; Kulkarni et al. 2013; Slattery and Goodman 2009; Ullman and Townsend 2007). Many workers in the IPV/SA field of work have themselves experienced violence or trauma (Wood 2016; Kulkarni et al. 2012; Slattery and Goodman 2009). As such, many workers bring experiences of survivorship to the work, which can be protective and predictive of occupational stress (Dworkin et al. 2016; Slattery and Goodman 2009; Frey et al. 2017).",

            "text": "Although occupational stress is a challenge for the IPV/SA workforce, there are also many positive aspects of being engaged in meaningful work. A less researched aspect of professional life is the pleasure workers derive from being able to do their jobs well, conceptualized as compassion satisfaction (Stamm 2010). Compassion satisfaction informs the occupational stress paradigm by emphasizing the benefits that can come from particularly taxing work. Compassion satisfaction has conceptual roots in positive psychology, acknowledges the potential benefit of working with traumatized populations (Kulkarni et al. 2013) and involves personal affect, resources, and self-care (Radey and Figley 2007). The construct of compassion satisfaction shares conceptual overlap with other positive outcomes research among the IPV/SA workforce, such as vicarious posttraumatic growth and resilience (Frey et al. 2017). As an occupational outcome, compassion satisfaction is associated with resilience (Frey et al. 2017), increased job satisfaction (Wood et al. 2017), and mitigating STS-related anxiety (Samios et al. 2013). Compassion satisfaction is also associated with lower burnout and STS among victim advocates (Cummings et al. 2018) and mental health workers (Ray et al. 2013). Compassion satisfaction can co-occur with burnout and secondary traumatic stress (Conrad and Kellar-Guenther 2006). Compassion satisfaction is associated with increased time in the field, higher levels of empathy, positive emotions, greater feelings of control at work, and value alignment (Killian 2008; Kulkarni et al. 2013; Samios et al. 2013; Wagaman et al. 2015).

Resilience is a key factor in positive outcomes associated with social service work. Resilience encapsulates a dynamic process of positive adaptation and healthy functioning following significant adversity, stress, and/or traumatic life events (Luthar et al. 2000; Masten 2011). Individual, interpersonal, and community factors, such as self-regulation, secure attachment, and collective efficacy, are associated with healthy functioning and adaptive outcomes (Luthar et al. 2000; Masten 2007 in Grych et al. 2015). Rather than being a fixed personality trait, dynamic circumstances, stressors, risks, and protective factors interact to shape resilience (Collins 2007; Masten 2011). In the workplace, resilience helps workers to respond effectively to the challenge of occupational stress, and is therefore especially pertinent to social service providers (Grant and Kinman 2012; Collins 2008; Howe 2008). Resilience relates to personal and professional growth, and involves self-care, inner strength, values, motivation, self-advocacy, and energy (Fink-Samnick 2009).",

            "text": "Positive coping behaviors relate to positive occupational outcomes. Closely related to resilience, coping refers to people\u2019s ongoing efforts to meet external and internal stressors perceived as challenging or exceeding their resources (Lazarus 2013). In their theory of stress and coping, Lazarus and Folkman (1984) posited that the relationship between person and environment determines an individual\u2019s ability to cope, and efforts to cope may also involve signaling to potential support providers a need for support. Positive coping may involve cognitive restructuring to manage the symptoms of distress in contrast to directly addressing the stressor (Collins 2008). Although many coping models exist (Grych et al. 2015), the research on occupational coping is still nascent. Research suggests positive coping behaviors promote personal wellness, mitigate occupational stress, and increase compassion satisfaction (Cummings et al. 2018; Ray et al. 2013; Stamm 2005). Not all coping strategies are inherently positive (e.g., drinking to excess, avoidance, and under- or over-eating). An earlier study by Um and Harrison (1998) showed an association between coping strategies employed by clinical social workers and job satisfaction. Bober and Regehr (2006) surveyed 259 helping professionals on their use of coping behaviors, and although most participants in their study believed leisure activities and self-care were useful, they were not associated with decreased traumatic stress scores. Qualitative research adds nuance to understanding coping in IPV/SA professional settings. In a study with rape victim advocates, participants felt informal support in the workplace nurtured their well-being and work; however, fear of burdening their peers and a lack of preparedness inhibited access to sufficient support (Houston-Kolnik et al. 2017).",

The model builds on research involving resilience, positive psychology, posttraumatic growth, and coping, and highlights what people do in the face of stress that promotes well-being rather than describing qualities that they possess. The model posits that well-being post-violence exposure is the result of \u201cthe characteristics of the adversity, the assets and responses available to them, and their behavior or responses\u201d (Grych et al. 2015, p. 3). The model suggests direct associations between (a) exposure to violence, (b) resources/assets, (c) appraisals and coping behavior, and (d) psychological health, as well as a number of moderating and mediating pathways. Resources refer to external sources of support (i.e. supportive relationships and environmental factors) and assets relate to the person\u2019s characteristics that promote healthy functioning (i.e. regulatory, interpersonal and meaning-making strengths) (Grych et al. 2015, p. 4). Together, resources and assets comprise an individual\u2019s \u201cportfolio\u201d of strengths and protection factors (p. 4). Appraisals and coping behavior refer to the meanings people make of violence and adverse events, as well as their responses. The RPM model proposes a main effects relationship between resources/ assets and healthy functioning, as well as a buffering effect between resources/assets and well-being in times of stress. Psychological health relates to a broad definition of well-being and positive affect.",

We set out to examine associations between RPM constructs of resources/assets, appraisals and coping behavior, and psychological health, which for the purposes of our analysis we conceptualized as workplace resources and workforce assets, occupational coping behaviors, and workforce well-being. As a secondary analysis, we drew variables from a broader dataset as proxy measures for relevant constructs, highlighted in Table 1 and detailed below in the subsequent section. In brief, for workplace resources, we utilized measures of perceived job security and goodness of fit between individuals and their professional environments, and for workforce assets, we employed a resilience measure. For coping behaviors, we used a coping measure modified for the IPV/SA workforce. As our main outcome of interest, we utilized a measure of compassion satisfaction to reflect the construct of workforce well-being. As previously indicated, exposure to violence is a key factor in the RPM, which we conceptualized as secondary traumatic stress in relation to our sample but did not include in the current analysis.",

Recruitment involved sharing promotional and recruitment materials through IPV/SA agency, social media (Twitter and Facebook), and 15 professional listservs to reach eligible participants also working on college campuses, in medical facilities, and other social service agencies. All promotional and recruitment materials and activities reiterated the voluntary nature of participating in the project and included a link to the survey.",

For organizations, ensuring staff have the time, space, and resources to make full use of coping behaviors is good practice on all levels, as it will pay off in better client services, enhanced worker well-being, and ultimately a more stable workforce, which may help offset many of the costs of taking such steps in the first place.",

Examples of interventions tested across an array of high-stress helping professionals and countries include professional skills training, clinical supervision, cognitive behavioral training, and relaxation (Awa et al. 2010). Others have recommended examining the effectiveness of a loving kindness mediation intervention (Fredrickson et al. 2008) and supervision strategies designed to enhance positive emotions, positive reframing, and compassion satisfaction (Samios et al. 2013). Interventions that seek to foster and provide regular opportunities for peer support among workers may also be worthwhile (Caringi et al. 2017). The evidence also indicates that refresher courses of interventions aimed at supporting worker self-care can help to sustain positive effects over time (Awa et al. 2010).",

Questions that emerged from this analysis include whether specific domains of coping behaviors are more or less effective in promoting compassion satisfaction among IPV/SA workers, and the extent to which demographics, type of work, and organizational setting play a role. As such, the analysis points to the need to examine in more depth the range of positive coping behaviors used by the IPV/SA workforce for the purposes of advancing this area of research and organizational policy. Related, although the purpose of this analysis was to focus on positive factors associated with stressful work, an important area of inquiry moving forward would be to understand what negative coping behaviors the IPV/SA workforce may utilize as well. Additionally, use of the RPM in our examination of the well-being of those whose work is trauma-focused points to tremendous potential for ongoing research and theory development moving forward.",

            "text": "A number of study limitations are important to note in considering the interpretation and application of the findings. First, the purposive recruitment strategy limits the generalizability of the sample to the study participants. In addition, it is important to take into consideration that the study took place in one U.S. state. The demographics and experiences of participants therefore reflect, to a degree, the workforce of a particular geographic context. Other structural considerations \u2013 such as levels of funding, inter-agency coordination, and state policy \u2013 are also specific to the state in which the study took place. Second, the cross-sectional dataset restricts our ability to draw conclusions as to the direction of associations tested in this analysis, and sparks additional questions about the role compassion satisfaction may play in influencing workers\u2019 perspectives and experiences of the workplace. Third, STS is an important factor to consider in relation to the IPV/SA workforce and the theoretical framework employed in this analysis. Although STS was not included in the current analysis, it is in other manuscripts associated with this project (Wood et al. 2019; Voth Schrag et al. in progress). Finally, it is important to acknowledge the challenges of secondary analyses and drawing measures from a broader study that was not originally conceived for the purposes of applying the theoretical model at hand.",
