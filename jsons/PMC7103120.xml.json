Presence of numerous superficial cells, as well as red blood cells, may indicate the presence of cystic follicles. It is unlikely that vaginitis alone results in pregnancy loss, but when it is associated with other abnormalities, it may help clarify reproductive issues associated with maintenance of pregnancy. Uterine infections cannot be definitively diagnosed by vaginal cultures, as mixed cultures generally only reflect normal vaginal flora [1]. However, overgrowth of high numbers of a single organism may be suggestive of an etiologic agent. Diagnosis of uterine infection can be definitely diagnosed either by an exploratory laparotomy (or laparoscopy) or, much more easily, using the transcervical endocscopic catheterization technique (TECT), which allows for acquisition of uterine swabs and cultures. Biopsies can also be obtained using this technique [2], [3]. However, specialized equipment and expertise is required for this method. This procedure is reserved for referral and specialty centers.",

However, in the clinical setting, it is generally safer to anticipate potential pregnancy loss when plasma progesterone concentrations are decreasing, by initiating progesterone supplementation. This action is usually taken without actually demonstrating that in absence of supplementation, the pregnancy would have terminated [61]. Clinicians and breeders are unwilling to take the risk of waiting until progesterone decreases to 2\u20133 ng/mL to start supplementation, as the pregnancy may be unsalvageable at that point. Even though primary hypoluteoidism is difficult to document clinically, it cannot be excluded and has been suggested as the cause for pregnancy loss in dogs [61], [62], [63]. In cases where pregnancy loss is clearly associated with low plasma progesterone concentration at the time of the event, it is unclear whether the failure was due to the low plasma progesterone concentration itself, or if the failure was due to another cause, secondarily leading to CL failure.",

            "text": "When described, hypoluteoidism generally occurred at approximately Days 25\u201335, when progesterone secretion directly or indirectly increased in pregnant animals following a still unclear mechanism linked to placentation [63]. For unexplained reasons, either the required increased production of progesterone of ovarian origin was not detected, or progesterone metabolism was increased, leading to insufficient plasma progesterone concentrations to maintain pregnancy. There is only anecdotal evidence that habitual abortion occurs in the bitch due to hypoluteoidism. There is a paucity of data to clearly demonstrate that a persistent and declining plasma progesterone concentration is the cause of repeated pregnancy loss. In some reports, shortened interestrus intervals were noted. The increased incidence of shortened luteal phases and hypoluteoidism in some breeds suggests a possible genetic inheritance of the disease [64]. Some authors have suggested removing animals suspected of hypoluteoidism from the breeding pool, to avoid perpetuating this abnormality [64].",

            "text": "When progesterone concentrations are low and risk of pregnancy loss is imminent, progestin supplementation can be recommended, even if doses are still empirical. Progestin use should be restricted to those cases in which true luteal insufficiency has been diagnosed or is highly suspect. Improper use may lead to masculinized females and cryptorchid male puppies. Various progestins have been proposed and used, including megestrol acetate. The authors do not recommend the use of synthetic progestins, for at least two reasons: (1) their pharmacology and pharmacodynamics are poorly understood in dogs and they are associated with longer durations of action; and (2) there are no means to evaluate the appropriateness of the dose administered. In that regard, no assays are commercially available to measure plasma concentration of these medications, preventing accurate monitoring. Therefore, when the need for supplementation arises, the authors recommend the use of micronized progesterone (Prometrium, Solvay Pharmaceuticals Marietta, GA, USA), which is a compounded product that is administered orally with good gastrointestinal absorption, as demonstrated in humans. Since this is a natural form of progesterone, plasma concentrations can be easily monitored using standard progesterone assays. The goal is to adjust the dose so that progesterone concentrations remain within the physiological ranges typically observed during the same stage of pregnancy. The standard dose used by the authors at the start of the treatment is 10 mg/kg p.o. q.d. Plasma concentrations are re-evaluated every second or third day for the duration of the treatment. The treatment is generally discontinued approximately 60\u201362 d after the LH surge. It is interesting to note that after administration of the same dose, plasma progesterone concentrations vary dramatically among animals, and need to be carefully monitored to maintain concentrations within the normal ranges observed during this part of pregnancy (Verstegen J. Unpublushed data).",

Cystic endometrial hyperplasia (CEH)/pyometra complex is more common in older females and has been associated with infertility (inability of the embryos to implant) if the condition is present prior to breeding and has been associated with partial or total pregnancy loss when the condition develops during pregnancy (for review see [65]). Predisposing factors are age and treatment with progestogens (for the postponement of estrus) or estrogens (for the early termination of pregnancy). The pathogenesis of this syndrome includes bacteria of vaginal origin ascending into the uterus during estrus when the cervix is open, resulting in uterine contamination and subsequent failure of clearance of these ascending organisms during diestrus. The diagnosis of CEH with macroscopic cysts can be made using ultrasonography. The return of fertility after treatment suggests that recovery of uterine integrity is possible.",

            "text": "The role of endometritis (apart from pyometra) as a cause of infertility is quite unclear. This reflects the difficulty in making a diagnosis of endometritis in cases other than those involving clinical signs that include a purulent vulvar discharge. In many species, acute endometritis is normal after breeding and represents a physiological process that cleanses the uterus of all debris, contaminants, and dead sperm cells introduced during mating [66], [67], [68], [69] and also prepares the uterus for entry of the maturing embryo(s) from the oviducts. The presence of this process after mating in dogs has not yet been demonstrated. However, Ribeiro et al. [70] described leukocyte infiltration 10\u201312 h after AI with semen and seminal fluid or semen with extender. They did not detect any differences in leukocyte numbers between dogs inseminated with semen including seminal fluid or extenders and those that were not inseminated, indicating that seminal fluid provided immune modulating effects similar to that seen in other species. In dogs, the presence of post-coital endometritis appears less probable than in other species, due to the peculiar estrous cycle of the dog, which is characterized by prolonged estrus and multiple matings in a single cycle. If post-coital endometritis did occur, like it does in other species with shorter estrus and mating periods, it would likely be long enough to impair sperm migration, fertilization and early embryo development. Analyzing the presence of this \u201cphysiological\u201d endometritis after mating has been a challenge due to the difficulty of gaining access to the uterus to obtain samples for microbiology and cytology. However, the development of the TECT will make these studies possible ([2], [3], [71], Verstegen et al., unpublished).",

The majority of cats with FECV remain healthy, but in a smaller number of cases (less than 10%), FECV is the first in a chain of mutations leading to FIP. This mutation arises within the individual cat, and horizontal transmission is considered rare. Vertical transmission, however, is frequent and has been clearly demonstrated to be responsible for neonatal deaths between 1 wk and 6\u201310 mo of age in experimental studies [119], [120]. In reality, its role in the pregnant queen appears to be less important than its consequences on the post-partum kittens.

            "text": "Three factors play a major role in the conversion of the virus from benign normal enteric virus to the aggressive form seen in FIP: genetic susceptibility, the presence of chronic FECV shedders, and a cat-dense environment that favors the spread and concentration of FECV [121], [122], [123]. Foley et al. reported the heritability of susceptibility to FIPV in purebred catteries to be very high (approximately 50%). It is likely a polygenetic trait and selecting for overall disease resistance is recommended, which requires removal of all suspected cats from the breeding programs. The same authors [121], [122], [123] demonstrated that persistent shedders of FECV, did not develop immunity, remained chronically infected, and were the source of infection for other cats. Careful identification of chronically infected, immunodeficient animals by PCR and removal from the colony would significantly reduce the risk of FIP. Currently, ELISA and PCR tests are commercially available [124]. Reduction in animal density in the cattery is recommended to reduce the spread of the virus and minimize horizontal contamination. Ideally, individual animals should be housed separately [124]. A licensed vaccine for FIP is commercially available (Primucell FIPTM, SmithKline Beecham Animal Health, USA). Although its use is still highly controversial, some publications seem to demonstrate that the risk associated with the use of this modified-live temperature-sensitive viral mutant vaccine is minimal [125], [126]. Its use in pregnant queens is contraindicated, as it is a modified-live preparation.",

It appears to cause abortion due to the debilitating effect of upper respiratory infection in queens, and it also infects kittens during the neonatal period. In utero transmission of the disease has not been shown except under certain experimental conditions. In one study, pregnant queens infected intranasally aborted following severe upper respiratory disease. However, no virus was isolated from the uterus, fetuses or placentas, nor were any histologic lesions seen [128]. A large epizootic infection of FHV1 in a large SPF cat colony of more than 690 queens was recently associated with only mild clinical signs of upper respiratory tract infection and only one partial abortion out of 51 queens. The queen aborted one dead kitten 3 wk prior giving birth to two healthy kittens. That queen was acutely ill, febrile, anorectic, and dehydrated at the time of abortion. However, 62% of kittens born from acutely affected mothers died within 1 wk after queening. [129]. As in dogs, many of the cats that recover from acute FHVl infection become persistent latent viral carriers, with possible reactivation occurring spontaneously or being induced by different types of stressors (illness, surgery, pregnancy, lactation, corticosteroid treatment) [130], [131], [132].",

Clinical signs are few and in general no significant hematologic or biochemical changes are observed, except for a neutrophilia. Renal lesions are less common than in dogs. The etiology is less clear in cats and even if the relation with progesterone is generally proposed, this hypothesis is less easily demonstrable in cats. Since queens are induced ovulators [134], [135], [136], high and prolonged plasma progesterone concentrations occur only after ovulation, rather than during every cycle as in bitches. The recent description of a high incidence of pseudopregnancy in cats might be an explanation corroborating the possible role of the repeated and prolonged progesterone influence [137]. However, the observation in dogs that uterine reactivity to local stimuli (mechanical or biological) might be the first and real inductor of cystic endometrial hyperplasia is also certainly to be taken into account in the feline species. Further investigation is certainly warranted before the exact etiopathogenesis of the CEH-pyometra complex can be clearly understood. Hyperplasic development of the uterine tissues, whatever the origin, certainly leads or facilitates bacterial growth and pyometra. Cystic endometrial hyperplasia and endometritis are diagnosed by detecting uterine changes by ultrasonography. Definitive diagnosis may require uterine biopsy and culture of the uterine lumen. Endometritis can complicate CEH following bacterial contamination, persistence of mummified or incompletely resorbed fetuses, retained fetal membranes, or from post-partum metritis [138], [139], [140], [141]. Feline pyometra can be treated like canine pyometra with good results and recovery of fertility [142], [143].",

Queens fed a taurine deficient diet can appear clinically normal, yet suffer from reproductive failure [143], [144], [145], [146], [147]. Of 18 queens fed a taurine deficient diet, only six carried pregnancies to full term. Clinical findings included abortions, early embryonic death and malformations in the neonates. Queens were clinically normal, except for retinal degeneration detected by fundoscopic examination. Interestingly, affected neonates suffered from cerebellar dysfunction, due to a persistence of mitotic activity in the external granule cell layer of the cerebellum.

Genetic defects tend to occur when close inbreeding takes place. Although cats may have many genetic abnormalities, the Manx syndrome associated with the tailless condition is of particular interest. An autosomal dominant factor is responsible for the tailless condition and is associated with spina bifida, urinary and fecal incontinence, and locomotor disturbances of the pelvic limbs. These are all related to a disturbance affecting the development of the central nervous system in early embryonic life [161]. Analysis of aborted fetuses or stillborn kittens for genetic defects such as spina bifida or sacral dysgenesis should be considered when one or both parents are of Manx breeding.",

Serologic testing is the traditional method of diagnosing CHV1. Specific ELISA tests are currently being developed, making the test easier to perform and more readily available [29], [162], [164]. The diagnosis, based on detection of specific antibodies against CHV1, is only valuable within a period of 2\u20133 mo following either an infection or reactivation. Thereafter, following the intial rise in titers, a dramatic reduction in titers will rapidly occur and antibodies will no longer be detectable, even if the animal remains a latent carrier. This is due to the herpesvirus being poorly immunogenic. However, in some cases, antibody titers may remain elevated for up to 2 y. When this occurs, it is typically seen in large infected kennels, where the infection pressure is elevated and reactivation or new infections occur frequently.",

To identify the status of a kennel, it is recommended some animals be followed longitudinally for two cycles. If the titers stay low, the kennel is probably free from infection. If the titer changes in one of the animals, the kennel is probably positive with latency. The other possibility, particularly in large colonies, is to test many dogs simultaneously.

Only 1 of 5 samples obtained from shedding animals is likely to be positive [29]. If virus recovery is the objective, considering the sensitivity of the virus to the environment, the samples should be refrigerated for storage and transport and freezing should be avoided.

The recommended vaccination scheme includes a first vaccination at approximately the time of breeding, and a booster 6\u20137 wk later to achieve maximum antibody titer around whelping. However, an alternative immunization scheme has been tested and proposed by the author to not only protect the neonates, but also try to protect the dam around the period of viral reactivation observed in estrus. This protocol entails a first vaccination within 1 mo before expected estrus, followed by a booster at approximately the time of mating. The antibody titer is then followed by serum neutralization or ELISA at mid-pregnancy and if the titer is not high enough (>1:128) a third injection is given.
