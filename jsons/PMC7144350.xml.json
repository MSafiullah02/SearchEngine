            "text": "Mathematical epidemiology is an important branch of science as it is essential to determine the patterns, causes, and effects of health and disease conditions in defined populations. Populations are prone to various bacterial and viral diseases in every ecosystem. These diseases have a significant influence on the dynamical evolution of the concerned population. This has prompted the need to study the impact of epidemiological parameters from mathematical as well as ecological point of view. There were significant developments in the theory and applications of epidemiological models of predator\u2013prey systems [1], [2], [3], [4], [5], [6], [7] in the last two decades. Mathematical models have a long history in infectious disease ecology starting from Bernoulli\u2019s [8] modelling of smallpox and including Ross\u2019s [9] analysis of malaria. Pioneer works on mathematical modelling of infectious disease was done by Kermack and McKendrick [5], [6], [7]. These papers had a major influence on the development of mathematical models forinfectious disease and are still relevant in many epidemic situations. There are many famous mathematical models which are related with important human infectious diseases e.g., HIV [10], malaria [11], [12], SARS-coronavirus [13] and influenza [14]. Mathematical models are also being used to explore wildlife disease dynamics [15], [16] and possible routes of zoonotic disease emergence. A predator\u2013prey system with infected prey in polluted environment was investigated by Sinha et al. [17]. Anderson and May [18] were probably the first who considered the disease factor in a predator\u2013prey dynamics and observed that pathogen tends to destabilize the predator\u2013prey interaction. Hadeler and Freedman [19] determined a threshold of infection rate above which an infected equilibrium or an infected periodic solution appear in Rosenzweig prey-predator model. Many eco-epidemiological models are investigated by several researchers considering various types of interactions between the populations [20], [21]. Chattopadhyay and Arino [22] formulated three species eco-epidemiological model and they studied local stability of equilibrium points, extinction criteria of species and determined the conditions for Hopf bifurcation in an equivalent two-dimensional model. Haque and Chattopadhyay [23] investigated the role of transmissible diseases in a predator\u2013prey system with infected prey. Bhattacharyya et al. [24] proposed and investigated an epidemiological model considering nonlinearity in infection incidence. Liu et al. [25] had done the bifurcation analysis of a predator\u2013prey model with disease in prey and they reported various bifurcation scenarios of the system. Yongzhen et al. [26] investigated effect of delay on a predator prey model with parasitic infection. Recently, various disease control strategies are introduced to control infectious disease in food chain model [27], [28]. Seasonal variation of infection rate is an important factor in disease modelling. Modelling and analysis of the transmission dynamics of tuberculosis without and with seasonality was investigated by Bowong et al. [29].",

            "text": "Disease control has relied heavily on the application of chemical fungicides, bactericides and soil fumigants over the last 50 years. Now there are many problems associated with their continued deployment forces us to reduce use of chemicals in the environment in general. Consequently, applications of alternative non-chemical methods of disease control continues to gain importance. It is well known that most predators not only feed a single prey rather move for alternative foods also. Polis and Strong [30] reported that the alternative resources and pathways plays central role in food web dynamics. Unexpected consequences of predator removal was observed experimentally by Sih et al. [31] and Cote & Sutherland [32]. They found that predator removal reduced prey populations in many cases. Several experimental studies [33], [34] had shown that predators can easily capture diseased prey. If predators eliminate the most infectious individuals from the prey population then that will have an outcome equivalent to quarantine, whereby infectious individuals are removed from the ecosystem and thereby prevented from disease spreading. Therefore, predator control has significant effect on food chain model with infected prey. Allochthonous inputs to predators help to increase predator population in a food chain. Some investigations [35], [36], [37], [38], [39], [40], [41] were done either providing alternative food or considering allochthonous inputs to predator in a predator\u2013prey system. Recently, Sahoo and Poria [40], [41] reported the consequences of alternative food for predator in a diseased predator\u2013prey system. They showed that an diseased system may becomes disease free in presence of additional food up to some threshold infection rate. But disease controlling aspects of allochthonous inputs to intermediate predator in a three species food chain model is unexplored. Starting from a well studied tritrophic food chain model [37], we investigate the disease controllability aspects of allochthonous inputs in this paper. The bifurcation phenomena of the model are analysed with respect to important biological parameters for finding periodic and other behaviours [42] of the model.",

The main aim of this paper is to analyse the role of allochthonous inputs to intermediate predator for controlling disease in prey population. The section-wise split of this paper are as follows. In next Section, the model formulation is done. In Section 3 the conditions for positivity and boundedness of solutions are derived. Stability conditions of all equilibrium points are derived and extinction criterion of infected prey population are calculated in the Section 3. Persistence condition of the system is derived in Section 4. In Section 5 the numerical simulation results of the model are presented and the effects of seasonal variation of contact rate on the model is also investigated. Numerically, one and two parameter bifurcation results using MATCONT 2.5.1. software [43], [44], [45] are presented in Section 6. Finally, conclusion is written in Section 7.",

The analysis is performed over a range of feeding preference from 0 (feeding only on autochthonous/classical food web sources) to 1 (feeding only on the allochthonous sources). The supply of allochthonous inputs remain constant. The parameters can be deemed biologically plausible as they represent realistic predator\u2013prey ratios in body size found in surveys [46], [47].",

The intermediate predator whose population density is denoted by p1 and the density of top-predator is denoted by p2.(b)A part of the susceptible prey population becomes infected at a rate \u03b4, following the law of mass action and d be the natural death rate of infected population.(c)Infected population is not in a state of reproduction and also does not compete for the resources.(d)Behaviour of the entire community is assumed to arise from the coupling of these interacting species, where p1 preys on both susceptible prey and infected prey in the form of Holling type-II and Holling type-I respectively. This different combinations of functional forms are taken because it is easier to capture infected prey than the susceptible prey [20]. Top-predator captures intermediate predator in the form of Holling type-II interaction. Infection does not transfer to intermediate predator from prey population.\n",

If E0\u2208\u03a9(X) then by the Butler-McGehee lemma [52] there exist a point P in \u03a9(X)\u22c2Ws(E0) where Ws(E0) denotes the stable manifold of E0. Since O(P) lies in \u03a9(X) and Ws(E0) is the i-p1-p2 space, we conclude that O(P) is unbounded, which is contrary to the boundedness of the system.Next E1\u2209\u03a9(X), for otherwise, since E1 is a saddle point which follows from the conditions (i) and (ii), by the Butler-McGehee lemma [52] there exist a point P in \u03a9(X)\u22c2Ws(E1). Now Ws(E1) is the s-axis implies that an unbounded orbit lies in \u03a9(X), a contradiction.The condition a1a2[(1-c1)s\u00af+c1A]b1+c1A+(1-c1)s\u00af+m(1-c1)i\u00afb1+c1A-a1>0 implies that E2 is unstable and therefore E2\u2209\u03a9(X).Lastly, we show that no periodic orbits in s-p1-p2 space or E3\u2208\u03a9(X).

[60] showed that for monthly data, the contact rate appears to be smooth and periodic with a period of about one year. London and Yorke [59] demonstrated that seasonality is necessary for perpetuating a recurrent epidemic, so we will concentrate on examining the effects of variation \u03b4 in the model (3). In order to investigate the qualitative effects of seasonality, we assume the infection-rate is set by the parameter \u03b4(t)\n[61], [62], [63] and incorporates time-dependent external factors affecting the contact rate between members of the population and the infectivity of the disease in the model (3).

This is happening because infected prey is weaker than susceptible prey and is easily captured by intermediate predator. This will reduce the number of infected prey and ultimately the system may becomes disease free at certain stage for low infection rate without allochthonous inputs. But for higher infection rate (\u03b4\u2a7e0.62), the disease free system can not be obtained in absence of allochthonous inputs. However, the bifurcation analysis with respect to infection rate proves that the system becomes disease free in presence of suitable allochthonous inputs for higher infection rate (Fig. 6, Fig. 7). If intermediate predator eliminate the most infected individuals from the prey population then it has an outcome equivalent to quarantine and prevent disease spreading among prey species. Allochthonous inputs to intermediate predator helps to increase its population size which helps to eat infected prey at higher rate. In this way allochthonous inputs to intermediate predator is very useful for controlling disease of prey population in a food chain model. We also consider seasonally varying contact rate and show that the system becomes disease free there in presence of suitable allochthonous inputs. Therefore, we may conclude that allochthonous inputs can control infectious disease of prey in a food chain model. We draw infected and uninfected region in the parameter plane as a function of infection rate and allochthonous inputs.",

            "text": "The key observation is that allochthonous inputs to intermediate predator can control infectious disease of prey in a food chain model if the death rate due to predation is lower than disease induced mortality of prey. If predators eliminate the most infectious individuals from the prey population then that will have an outcome equivalent to quarantine, which can prevent disease spreading among prey. Actually, the supply of allochthonous input increase the population of intermediate predator and then it can captures infected prey at higher rate and as a result, after certain time the system becomes disease free. Considering a parasite infected food chain model Packer et al. [67] showed that predation will increase prey population size when the force of predation is lower than prey mortality. On the other hand if the death rate due to predation is higher than prey mortality then negative effects of allochthonous inputs will be expected. Notice that allochthonous inputs never increase the disease of prey but may not control the infection of the prey at high infection rate (for example see Fig. 8). Results presented in this paper are important to understand the role of allochthonous inputs as a natural disease controller of infected prey in a food chain model. The possible interesting aspects for future developments are to investigate the role of allochthonous inputs as a disease controller in food chain models with other type of functional responses between intermediate predator and infected prey and also with different types of infection spreading rule. The role of allochthonous inputs to control infectious disease of prey in a network of infected food chain models are also an important area for future developments. This novel natural non-toxic method of disease control may be very useful for biological conservation of prey species and also for developing new strategies for controlling infectious disease of prey in a real world biological systems.",
