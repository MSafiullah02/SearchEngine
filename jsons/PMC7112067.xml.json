PE is categorized as acute pulmonary embolism (APE) and chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension (CTEPH). PE is a major health problem, with a high incidence, mortality, misdiagnosis and miss diagnosis rate [1]. VTE risk factors can be classified as either acquired or inherited, and most of them are acquired. The American College of Chest Physicians (ACCP) has published guidelines for the prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of VTE in surgical patients since 1995 [2]. Nine issues have been published so far [3]. However, the incidence of symptomatic VTE was increasing instead of reducing [4], probably because the pathogenesis of VTE is still unclear.",

We chose twenty patients admitted in our department of cardiology at the same time as control in the study. The patients were divided into two groups: 1) PE patient group: 20 patients (11 males and 9 females), with a mean age of 70 \u00b1 14 (44 ~ 89) yr, include 3 cases of CTEPH; 2) Control group: 20 patients (11 males and 9 females) without PE, DVT, arterial thrombosis, and congenital coagulation abnormality, mean age with a mean age of 72 \u00b1 14(44 ~ 91) yr, which were matched in sex and age with the PE group.

The up-regulation of C1q\u03b1, C1q\u03b2 and C4b mRNAs in PE patients suggests that there exists pathogen invasion, leading to the activation of the classical pathway. When mannose-bind lectin (MBL) or Ficolin bind to carbohydrate on the surface of pathogens, the MBL-associated serine proteases (MASPs) are activated, then the lectin pathway is activated [12]. Previous studies have shown that people with MBL deficiency are susceptible to a variety of infections, especially when their adaptive immunity is immature [13], [14], [15]. Therefore, the down-regulation of MBL and MASP1 mRNAs in PE patients indicates deficiency or decline of the lectin pathway function in PE patients.",

Our results showed that the mRNA expression of CD59 and CD55 which is also known as decay acceleration factor (DAF) was significantly increased, however, mRNA expression of Factor I was significantly decreased. CD55, C4BP and Factor H can regulate the complement activation through inhibiting the activity of C3 convertase [10]. CD59 can bind to C8 (\u03b1 chain) and C9 during MAC complex formation and protects host cells from MAC-mediated lysis [17]. Thus, the up-regulation of CD59 and CD55 mRNAs suggests inhibition of MAC-mediated lysis in PE patients. However, in our present study, it is unclear whether the cause of the up-regulation of CD55 and CD59 mRNAs is inherited or acquired. It has been reported that Factor I deficiency was associated with recurrent bacterial infections [18]. In our present study, Factor I mRNA expression was down-regulated in PE patients compared with controls, suggesting that PE patients are susceptible to bacterial infections.",

            "text": "Our results showed that mRNA expression of various components, receptors and regulators of the complement pathways were unbalanced in PE patients, indicating that the function of some segments were enhanced and some were reduced or deficiency in the complement activation. To defend against pathogens, the innate immune system mainly comprises the complement proteins, phagocytes, and NK cells, whereas the adaptive immune system consists of T cells and B cells which produce antibodies when stimulated. Previously, we have reported that mRNA expression of genes associated with NK and T cells was down-regulated in PE patients [7]. We also reported that transmission electron microscopy showed rod-like bacteria in a patient with recurrent PE/DVT, indicating phagocyte deficiency in PE patients [19]. In addition, our previous studies showed decreased number of CD3\n+T cells and CD8\n+T cells, and an imbalance in the CD4\n+/CD8\n+ ratio in patients with acute PE and CTEPH respectively [8], [9]. In our present study, several complement early components of the classical pathway and the alternative pathway and complement receptors mRNAs were significantly up-regulated, suggesting complement activation in PE patients. However, mRNA expression of several components of MBL pathway and the formation of MAC were significantly down-regulated, suggesting defective or reduced complement function in PE patients. In conclusion, we speculate that when there exist deficiencies in both the innate and adaptive immunity, the pathogens can not be prevented or eliminated once they invade and circulate in the blood. The pathogens then activate the coagulation system directly or with the inflammation indirectly, leading to the occurrence of symptomatic VTE finally. The occurrence of symptomatic VTE may be associated with infections under the condition of immune deficiency.",
