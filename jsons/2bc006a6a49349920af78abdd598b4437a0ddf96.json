            "text": "Toxoplasma gondii can infect virtually all warm-blooded animals, including humans. It can differentiate between rapidly replicating tachyzoites that cause acute infection and slowly growing bradyzoites in tissue cysts. Treatment options for toxoplasmosis are challenging because current therapies cannot eradicate the latent T. gondii infection that is mainly caused by the bradyzoite forms. Accordingly, recurrence of infection is a problem for immunocompromised patients and congenitally infected patients. Protein kinases have been widely studied in eukaryotic cells, and while little is known about signaling in Toxoplasma infection, it is likely that protein kinases play a key role in parasite proliferation, differentiation, and probably invasion. To identify optimized new kinase inhibitors for drug development against T. gondii, we screened a library of kinase inhibitor compounds for anti-Toxoplasma activity and host cell cytotoxicity. Pyrimethamine served as a positive control and 0.5% DMSO was used as a negative control. Among the 80 compounds screened, 6 compounds demonstrated \u2265 80% parasite growth inhibition at concentrations at which 5 compounds did not suppress host cell viability, while 3 kinase inhibitors (Bay 11-7082, Tyrphostin AG 1295 and PD-98059) had suppressive effects individually on parasite growth and host cell invasion, but did not strongly induce bradyzoite formation.",

In humans, infection occurs upon consump-tion of insufficiently cooked meat derived from infected animals or foods contaminated with soil containing Toxoplasma gondii oocysts shed from infected cats (Black and Boothroyd 2000) . Primary infection of pregnant women causes miscarriage, fetal encephalopathy, convulsions, hydrocephalus, intracranial calcification, and other symptoms (Demar et al. 2012; Campos et al. 2014; Fallahi et al. 2018) . Toxoplasma employs various survival strategies, such as intracellular parasitism and immune disturbance, to escape from the host's immune response, so vaccine development is extremely difficult. The current anti-protozoan drugs however do not efficiently target the bradyzoite stage, but rather may induce latent infection.",

When the compounds were added after the 2-h invasion window, the same 6 compounds ( Supplementary Fig. 1) inhibited parasite growth in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 1b) . The parasite growth rate and the host cell viability are presented in Table 1 . Meanwhile, the 50% effective concentration (EC 50 ) of the 6 compounds ranged from 1.5-11 \u03bcM (Table 2 ). Next, we calculated the 50% inhibitory concentration (IC 50 ) value against Vero cells, and thereby estimated selectivity index for each compound as a measure of therapeutic efficacy (Table 2) . Together, the data suggest that five (5) of the compounds exhibited low host cell toxicity, thus indicating anti-Toxoplasma specificity. Only Tyrphostin AG1295 shows host cellular toxicity. Additionally, the low cytotoxic action in host cells by these compounds suggests exclusion of general cellular toxicity.",

            "text": "Although we have not yet assessed the mechanism by which these anti-Toxoplasma compounds block parasite growth, the mechanism may reveal a new target for the control of T. gondii. While therapy exists for the treatment of toxoplasmosis, it is suboptimal and there is a need for new therapeutic agents with fewer side effects and for agents that are active against latent infection. The use of a bradyzoite reporter parasite facilitates the evaluation of compounds for their effects against both tachyzoites and bradyzoites. We identified four compounds (daidzein, Bay 11-7082, Tyrphostin AG 1295, and PD-98059) that showed promising anti-Toxoplasma activity but did not induce bradyzoite formation. This is desirable, given that current treatment options, like pyrimethamine, do not prevent bradyzoite formation, and more importantly, there is currently no treatment option to combat bradyzoites formed in tissue cysts. The screening method described in this study represents a strategy to identify anti-Toxoplasma compounds that have both Toxoplasma growth inhibition and bradyzoite induction capability. Several drugs that target these latent parasites have recently been identified and include a bumped kinase inhibitor (Doggett et al. 2014 ) and protein kinase inhibitor (Wei and Liu 2013 ) that targets T. gondii CDPK1 (Sugi et al. 2010) , and endochin-like quinolones (Doggett et al. 2012) , which inhibit the cytochrome bc1 complex. The activity of these compounds toward bradyzoites suggests that therapeutic agents can be found to treat latent infection caused by this parasite. Additional screens using the approach presented here should help identify more lead compounds, and it is likely that one of these leads will result in a clinically effective new therapy for the treatment of the chronic infection. Furthermore, to meet the need for new antimicrobial therapies, we are driving the screening of wider ranges of chemical compounds to identify those with anti-parasitic activity (Adeyemi et al. 2017 (Adeyemi et al. , 2018 .",

Most of the hit compounds identified in this study have not been previously reported to have anti-T. gondii activity, except for daidzein which were reported previously by us (Adeyemi et al. 2018 ).
