Similarly, multivalent or polyvalent interactions can be defined as specific simultaneous associations of multiple ligands (or epitopes) present on a molecular construct or biological surface that binds in a cooperative way to multiple receptors expressed on a complementary entity.",

In fact, multivalency in Nature is very often expressed by fractal or \u201cdendritic\u201d architectures that represent perhaps the most pervasive topologies observed in vegetal and animal kingdoms.2 Typical examples of these patterns may be found at different scales of dimensional length (meters to microns), and typical examples can be observed in abiotic systems (such as snow crystals, fractal erosions, manganese dendrites in rock) or in the biological world. The reasons for such extensive mimicry of these dendritic topologies at virtually all scales of dimensional length are not entirely clear. However, one might speculate that these evolutionary architectures have been optimized over the past several billion years to provide structures manifesting maximum interfaces for optimum energy extraction/distribution, nutrient extraction/distribution, information storage/retrieval, and adhesive processes. For example, trees use fractal dendritic patterns above and beneath the ground in order to enhance the exposure of their leaves to sunlight to harvest light and maximize the photosynthesis process, and of their roots to collect water from the soil.",

Presumably, the many chain ends that decorate these macromolecules facilitate enzymatic access to glucose for high-demand bioenergy events. Another nanoscale example of dendritic architecture in biological systems is found in proteoglycans. These macromolecules appear to provide energy-absorbing, cushioning properties and determine the viscoelastic properties of connective tissues. In addition, the tremendously complex dendritic respiratory network is composed of bronchioles and alveoli to give the maximum surface for efficient transfer of oxygen into the bloodstream. The arterial and central nervous system networks, together with the kidneys and lung structures also consist of a great number of cells growing into dendritic structures in order to gain the largest exchange of material or information with the surrounding tissues.3 Recently, the implication of dendritic patterns observed under the feet of the gecko has also been clarified to explain the exceptional ability of these animals to climb rapidly up smooth vertical surfaces.4 Microscopic examinations have shown that a gecko's foot has nearly five hundred thousand keratinous hairs or setae, each composed of an impressive dendritic network of tiny foot hairs \u201cspatulae.\u201d Measurements have revealed that one seta is 10 times more effective at adhesion than predicted from maximal estimates on whole animals. Values of the adhesive force support the hypothesis that individual setae operate by weak attractive quantum chemical forces from molecules in each foot-hair interacting through Van der Waals forces with molecules of the surface.",

For HIV-1, several hypothesis have been formulated concerning their role in infection process, and it has been speculated that the N-linked hyperbranched high mannose oligosaccharide (Man9GlcNAc2), exposed at the exterior envelope glycoprotein gp120, helps the \u201chidden\u201d virus to escape neutralizing antibodies.5 Indeed, these glycans are produced by the host cell, and are largely unrecognized by the immune system machinery.",

Indeed, carbohydrates are expressed on the majority of mammalian cell surfaces, and are bound to proteins, glycoproteins, and glycolipids, or conjugated to such cellular constituents as proteoglycans that are entangled in the cell membrane and clustered in multiantennary configurations. In other terms, these oligosaccharides constitute signal transductors between extra- and intracellular media.6, 7, 8 Hence, these glycosylated structures are responsible for the presentation of target structures for microorganisms, toxins and antibodies, control the half-life of proteins, modulation of protein function, or provision of ligands for specific binding events. In addition, they have recently emerged as antigenic determinants in cell\u2013cell recognition, signaling events, and as ligands for bacterial and viral infections.9, 10 As such, they constitute the first line of contact for the adhesion and tissue colonization by several pathogens expressing carbohydrate-binding proteins (lectins). Conversely, several infectious microorganisms use or escape the immune defense mechanisms by masking important receptors or antigenic determinants by exposing self-carbohydrate structures. As mentioned earlier, the consequences of these \u201cmasking\u201d events are that the bacterial or viral pathogens are transported to target tissues by self cellular systems.",

Consequently, these interactions are transformed into very potent attractive forces, dramatically and naturally reinforced, when multiple ligand copies are presented to similarly clustered receptors. This phenomenon, resulting from a synergic and cooperative effect, is known as the \u201cglycocluster or dendritic effect,\u201d13 and has been initially observed with asialoglycoprotein receptors found on hepatocytes.14 In its widespread version, it is usually assumed that this effect has its source in the enhanced affinity of a given multivalent glycoside toward a CRD (carbohydrate-recognition domain) by fully occupying one active site at a time.The phenomenon is now widely accepted of having its basis in stabilization by macroscopic \u201ccrosslinking glycocluster effects.\u201d It has thus come well established that multivalency may offer numerous benefits in terms of affinity and receptor selectivity versus monovalent interaction, and can induce particular clustering organization on the cell surface, notably to provide a strategy for controlling signal transduction pathways within cells.15\n",

The variations of anomeric configurations and linkage positioning between saccharides are thus responsible for unraveling several distinctive \u201cglycocodes.\u201d16 As a consequence, the different architectures and topological expressions that result are at the origin of the required high affinity and selectivity for a particular tailored recognition event. Interestingly, even such complex multiantennary glycans as Man9GlcNAc2 are only partly involved in these binding processes and often, but not unexpectedly, only the peripheral groups are bound in the receptors' active sites. Hence, multivalent interactions are now understood to be a ubiquitous strategy that has evolved in Nature for a wide range of functions, and which provide numerous benefits and unique roles not achievable with monovalent interactions. Consequently, from a simplistic point of view, most multiantennary glycans may be regarded as polyvalent neoglycoconjugates of well-defined architectures and multivalency, designed to mimic the complexity of the multiantennary oligosaccharide structures while emphasizing the recognition of the sole surface.",

However, their thorough understanding suffers from the natural complexity of the carbohydrates resulting from incomplete biosynthesis or subtle attachment of other functionalities at specific positions along the oligosaccharide sequences. Numerous key functions of carbohydrates depend on the observed microheterogeneity, added to well-defined cluster organization. In order to study, characterize, understand, and manipulate these critical interactions, striking advances have been made in isolation, purification, structural analyses, and partial or selective degradation processes. Alternatively, chemical or chemoenzymatic synthesis of multivalent carbohydrate ligands is, however, likely to remain the method of choice to afford tailored multivalent architectures developed as effectors or inhibitors of biological mechanisms. Accordingly, it is highly desirable to tackle the inherent problem of high specificity and increased affinity by simultaneously optimizing factors involved in both multivalency and intrinsic fine tuning of a ligand toward individually targeted carbohydrate-binding protein interactions.",

After assessing the bacterial/viral genomes, proteomic analysis, and search for carbohydrate-binding protein homology through bioinformatics, the presence of a carbohydrate-binding protein is then confirmed. For bacterial or viral lectins, the isolated proteins can be labeled with fluorogenic probes. The ligand-binding specificity of the fluorescent lectins is then determined by glycan microarrays such as the one freely accessible from the Consortium for Functional Glycomics (or the like) to identify the best oligosaccharide \u201clead.\u201d17 The most recent microarrays are usually constituted of approximately 400 natural and synthetic glycans (version 3.10).18, 19, 20, 21, 22 Once essential carbohydrate residues (epitopes) responsible for the biological activity of interest are identified, the lead candidates are then validated by using a range of binding assays such as ELISA (enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay), ELLA (enzyme-linked lectin assay), ITC (isothermal titration calorimetry), SPR (surface plasmon resonance), FRET (fluorescence resonance energy transfer), X-ray crystallography, and analogous techniques.

Synthetic neoglycoconjugates in which carbohydrate residues are attached to carriers thus present numerous advantages in terms of characterization, structural uniformity, and availability. Hence, presentation of the sugar epitopes as multiple copies on an appropriate scaffold (molecular, dendritic, polymeric) creates a multivalent display that can efficiently mimic the natural mode of affinity enhancement that arises from multiple interactions between the binding proteins and the carbohydrate ligands. In general, the carbohydrate ligands are usually found at the periphery of these macromolecules. Efficient conjugation reactions are required for complete substitution and the structural integrities of the multivalent glycoconjugates are evaluated by such conventional techniques as NMR spectroscopy and mass spectrometry. Progress encountered in terms of their synthetic accessibility and efficiency has allowed optimization of their modulation and activity. These factors remain necessary for investigating how these multivalent structures can best influence the targeted binding activity. These investigations are critical for highlighting the potential of multivalent carbohydrate inhibitors as high-affinity ligands or as effectors capable of clustering cell-surface receptors, and may permit generation of structures having tailored biological activities.",

The uniformity of these multivalent neoglycoconjugates is ensured by the controlled arrangement of the constitutional building blocks. To this end, a large panel of linkage functions have been used, but the ones most frequently used are amides, thioureas, and recently 1,2,3-triazoles obtained via dipolar cycloadditions of alkyne and azide precursors through a process now termed \u201cclick chemistry.\u201d50, 51, 52, 53 The required functionalities are installed with equal success on either the sugars or on the scaffolds. This particular application has become widely used, since the sugar attachment can be effected with both protected or free sugars. The protecting groups most repeatedly employed on the sugars have been esters because it is usually more difficult to remove large number of ether or acetal-protected sugars (for example, benzyl ethers). Moreover, the lectin-binding efficiency and specificity of multivalent glycoconjugates have been found to be dependent not only on the epitope density but also on the nature of the core and the geometrical characteristics of the multivalent assembly.",

Historically, one of the first branched glycoside clusters was based on a readily available AB3 building block, tris(hydroxymethyl)aminomethane (1, TRIS), used by Lee in the late 1970s.59 Owing to the synthetic advantages in terms of symmetry that ensure orthogonal and rapid functionalization, this building block constitutes an ideal candidate for clustering of saccharides. Hence, 1 and its derivatives have been extensively used by several groups for direct glycoside attachment on hydroxyl groups to generate trivalent clusters.60 However, although the chemistry of glycocluster synthesis was established, the first such glycoconjugates were generally subject to unfavorable steric factors upon binding to proteins. In this context, K\u00f6tter et al. used extended TRIS derivatives, such as 4-(3-hydroxypropyl)-4-nitroheptane-1,7-diol (2) to prepare highly branched glycomimetics (Fig. 3\n).61\n",

Unfortunately, the corresponding nonavalent dendrons 5 and 6 presented only very poor or no inhibitory potencies. To explain these a priori unexpected results, it has been postulated that the cluster did not present enough hydroxyl groups for efficient interactions with the lectin surface, or did not present hydroxyl or other functional groups in the appropriate orientation for lectin binding.

Notably, tris(2-aminoethyl)amine (8) and pentaerythrityl tetraamine (13), [prepared from tetrabromide (11) via azide substitution to 12 followed by reduction to 13 with hydrogen on 10% Pd/C], gave the corresponding tri- and tetra-mannoside clusters 10 and 14, respectively, using the free reducing sugar D-mannose (9).",

Biological studies indicated, through the series of multivalent conjugates, a clear connection between inhibitory efficacy, the number of galabiose units present on the potential inhibitor, and the flexibility of the structures. Interestingly, the tetravalent galabioside was several hundred times more efficient than the monomeric galabioside in inhibiting the agglutination of human erythrocytes by the S. suis bacterium, resulting in complete inhibition at a concentration as low as 2 nM.",

The tetravalent cluster 27 has been efficiently synthesized according to two different synthetic pathways. In the first route, a C3 hydroxy linker was introduced within the aglycone moiety of 24, and a Williamson ether synthesis with pentaerythritol tetrabromide (11) led to a mixture of mono-, di-, tri-, and tetra-dentate (26) conjugates, even when an eightfold excess of the corresponding alcohol and forcing reaction conditions were used. In the best case, the protected tetravalent cluster 26 was isolated in 62% yield. To circumvent these difficulties, an alternative strategy was investigated, involving the use of a modified pentaerythritol derivative to serve as a longer spacer-equipped tetraol (23) for the subsequent glycosylation step, using imidate 25. To this end, pentaerythritol was initially perallylated and the extended tetraol 23 was obtained by an hydroboration\u2013oxidation sequence on the double bond in the presence of 9-BBN, NaOH, and H2O2. Then, the perbenzoylated mannosyl trichloroacetimidate 25 was used as the glycosyl donor for the Lewis acid-assisted mannosylation reaction. Deprotection of the resulting tetramer 27 under Zempl\u00e9n conditions afforded the desired cluster 28 in excellent yield.",

The first target tetramer (51) was synthesized from p-iodophenyl \u03b1-D-mannopyranoside 49, previously prepared from peracetylated \u03b1,\u03b2-D-mannopyranose by glycosidation with triflic acid as a promoter. Then, Sonogashira coupling between tetrakis(2-propynyloxymethyl)methane (32) and 49, followed by subsequent O-acetyl deprotection of 50 provided the key tetravalent cluster 51 in good yield (Scheme 8\n). Noteworthy is the fact that those transition metal-catalyzed cross-couplings have been optimized during this study, recommending the use of 5 mol% Pd(PPh3)2Cl2 in the presence of 10 mol% Cu(I) catalyst, piperidine as a base in tetrahydrofuran (THF) or N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF), with slow addition of the tetrakis alkyne to prevent homocoupling and degradation. Alternatively, tetramer 55, possessing the reversed linkage functionality, that is, the propargyl group installed on the mannoside residue and the aryl iodide on the pentaerythritol scaffold, was also similarly prepared to investigate the effect of the aryl pharmacophore positioning on binding. In this context, the central tetrakis[(4-iodophenyloxy)methyl]methane 53 was efficiently elaborated by nucleophilic substitution of pentaerythritol tetrabromide 11 using p-iodophenol 52 under basic conditions in 78% yield. Treatment of 53 with prop-2-ynyl \u03b1-D-mannopyranoside 29 under the optimized Sonogashira coupling conditions just described provided tetramer 54, which upon further O-deacetylation gave unprotected tetramer 55 in 73% yield over two steps. According to the same strategy, but using Et3N in DMF at 60 \u00b0C instead of the foregoing Sonogashira cross-coupling conditions, the corresponding hexavalent cluster 58 was efficiently obtained, using dipentaerythritol derivative 56 and mannoside 29 after conventional Zempl\u00e9n deprotection of 57.",

Initially, the cross-linking abilities of these molecules were investigated by using a kinetic turbidimetric assay (nephelometry), with the tetrameric phytohemagglutinin Con A from Canavalia ensiformis as a model. Significant activity of the glycoclusters was observed when they were used as ligands in interactions with protein receptors, with the rapid formation of cross-linked lattices toward Con A, especially for tetramer 51. In fact, this last example was the best candidate, and it induced an almost quantitative precipitation of the lectin within 2 min. Obviously, clusters having the alternative triazole heterocycles or the extended series from the Sonogashira coupling were less efficient. These results were rationalized by the authors on the basis of the relative stability of the resulting insoluble complexes, with molecular modeling of tetramer 51 showing that each mannopyranoside residue was at the apex of a tetrahedron in which they were 18.6 and 16.0 \u00c5 apart. This distance could easily accommodate the clustering of four different tetrameric Con A lectins.",

The affinity of the lectin domain of isolated FimH of E. coli K12 toward clusters was obtained by competitive experiments between an immobilized anti-FimH antibody (1C10) and free mannosylated clusters. According to this study, tetramer 51 was designated as the best ligand known, with a K\nD of 0.45 nM (1.8 nM/Man) in the subnanomolar range, corresponding to 1222-fold and 3-fold enhancement over the reference monomer methyl \u03b1-D-mannopyranoside and the strongest monosaccharide ligand known (Hept\u03b1Man), respectively. Once again, the position of the phenyl ring appeared to be rather important with regard to modulating the activity of tetravalent conjugate 55 (K\nD = 273 nM), which differed from 51 only by the inverted alkyne\u2013phenyl ring sequence. These results thus further demonstrated that clusters possessing an aryl moiety in the vicinity of the anomeric oxygen atom showed the best overall qualifications. Conjugates obtained by the click chemistry already described have also been studied. Spatial rearrangement of the hexamer having the triazole rings appeared to be a determinant for affinity, as 42 was nearly five times better than the analogous tetramer 31 (K\nD of 3 and 14 nM, respectively), thus illustrating the influence of multivalency on this scaffold. The distance between the anomeric oxygen atom and the triazole ring was also a critical factor for affinity. On the other hand, the introduction of four or six mannopyranoside moieties using extended precursors and Sonogashira coupling had only a minor effect on the relative affinity.",

Given that the mannose-specific lectin Con A induces MT1-MMP expression and mimics biological lectin\u2013carbohydrate interactions, these clusters were tested to evaluate their potential to block Con A activities on MSC. The results indicated that specific tetra- and hexavalent mannoside clusters, especially 51, 55, and 58, reversed Con A-mediated changes in MSC morphology, and antagonized Con A-induced caspase-3 activity and proMMP-2 activation. They also inhibited Con A, but not the cytoskeleton-disrupting agent Cytochalasin-D-induced MT1-MMP cell-surface proteolytic processing mechanisms, and effects on cell-cycle phase progression. The antiproliferative and proapoptotic impact of Con A on the MT1-MMP\u2013glucose-6-phosphate transporter signaling axis was also reversed by these mannosides. In conclusion, this family of mannosylated clusters very effectively inhibited a spectrum of MT1-MMP-mediated cell responses that could be potentially transposed to target tumor-promoting processes.

Once the cell is infected, the new virions use their neuraminidases (or sialidases) to escape from the infected cells. Thus, these neuraminidases have been targeted to stop viral infection by blocking the virus inside the infected cells. To this end, a small library of mono- and divalent 1,2,3-triazole-linked sialic acids has been constructed via click chemistry, together with corresponding tetravalent cluster, generated from tetrapropargylated core and \u03b1-sialic acid azide.

By contrast, the access to corresponding hexavalent analogue via cyclotrimerization of disubstituted symmetrical alkynes was not successful, perhaps because of steric hindrance.",

The limit of this type of conjugation was tested by the use of such crowded systems as those represented by vicinal polyiodobenzenes and short-arm sugar acetylenes. The study elegantly and efficiently afforded di- and tri-valent conjugates from p-diiodobenzene and sym-triiodobenzene, respectively, involving the use of diversely protected ethynyl glycosides (acetylated or benzylated). In addition, the deprotection via hydrogenolysis of the clusters generated from the conjugation of benzylated saccharides afforded the corresponding ethylene-bridged systems, since the triple bonds were also reduced through this operation. As the use of benzyl-protected ethynyl C-glycosyl derivatives turned out to be inefficient as reaction partner in the SHC with the tetraiodobenzene, the desired tetravalent neoglycoconjugate was obtained in only moderate yield (49%). Further cross-coupling attempts under optimized conditions and involving hexaiodobenzene failed, affording only the tetraadduct in 35% yield. Interestingly, O-deacetylation and O-debenzylation, together with the reduction of triple bonds, yielded highly water-soluble structures.",

Of note is the fact that binding of the two homodimeric proto-type galectins-1 and -7 was not effectively influenced by the presence of multivalent compounds. In fact, only a few of them manifested inhibitory capacity in the range of free lactose, demonstrating cases of negative correlation between carrier-dependent presentation of lactose and inhibitory efficiency. However, the trivalent cluster 87 induced the strongest cluster effect with the chimeric-type galectin-3, with an IC50 of 30.8 \u03bcM (700 \u03bcM for free lactose) in contrast to the corresponding divalent lactoside 86. Its efficiency was independently confirmed by hemagglutination and by in vitro cytofluorometric tumor-cell binding analysis. The trivalent compound was a potent inhibitor of galectin-3, blocking its binding to native cell surfaces.

Dynamic light scattering (DLS) experiments further confirmed the strong aggregating effect of Con A by the mannoside cluster at concentrations slightly above the nanomolar range, according to a mannose-dependent and partially reversible process.

In 2005, elegant work disclosed from combined efforts of the Ungaro and Bernardi groups has described the synthesis of a divalent cholera toxin (CT) glycocalix[4]arene ligand (109) having higher affinity than the natural GM1 oligosaccharide 107 (Fig. 9\n).125 The bacterial CT is produced by toxicogenic strains of the gram-negative bacillus Vibrio cholerae, the causative agent of cholera, the life-threatening acute diarrhea, that mainly affects third-world populations. This heterohexameric AB5 complex is composed of structurally independent, catalytically active heterodimeric A (CT-A, enzymatic) and homopentameric B (CT-B, targeting) subunits. This last moiety effects recognition and anchoring to the cell membrane. With 80% sequence homology in common with the heat-labile enterotoxin secreted by some strains of the E. coli bacterium (LT), their mode of action remain similar: both toxins exploit the intrinsic complicated trafficking mechanisms of the host cells to gain access to the cytosol, where they exert their detrimental activity. As a prelude to the infection, once in the lumen of the gastrointestinal tract of the human host, the toxins recognize the receptor ganglioside GM1 [\u03b2Gal1\u21923\u03b2GalNAc1\u21924(\u03b1Neu5Ac2\u21923)\u03b2Gal(1\u21924)\u03b2Glc1\u21921Cer] (107 with an IC50 of 14 nM for CT)) on the surface of epithelial cells through the B subunits arranged in a pentameric pattern which trigger endocytosis.126 Acute structural studies and biochemical data concerning the fundamental interaction of GM1 with CT demonstrate the critical role of the two sugars at the nonreducing end of GM1, namely galactose and sialic acid. Taking these specific structural properties into consideration, the rational design of artificial receptors for the toxin as monovalent or multivalent ligands has been envisaged.127 While preparation of the ganglioside GM1 represents a tedious synthetic challenge, one of the strategies of impeding CT-B/GM1 interactions concerns the design and synthesis of functional and structural mimics of the natural CT membrane receptor GM1. In this regard, Bernardi et al. described the synthesis of pseudosugar GM1 mimics, designed using molecular modeling techniques and presented as high-affinity binders of CT, including the second-generation conjugate 108, having a K\nD of 190 \u03bcM.128\n",

Interestingly, high-affinity carbohydrate ligands for both major activating receptors, NKR-P1 and CD69, have been found. More particularly, GlcNAc was recognized as a high-affinity receptor in this study. Furthermore, multivalency through multiantennary, branched GlcNAc-containing structures was found to be crucial for a highly specific recognition and binding event to NKR-P1 and CD69 receptors in vitro. Hence, this study was initiated to determine differences in the binding capability of calix[4]arene-based glycoconjugates to recombinant receptors, as well as their effects on proliferation and cytotoxic cell-effector function. Results indicated that, in the case of NKR-P1, the binding affinity of \u03b2-D-GlcNAc-substituted calixarenes carrying two or four sugar units was comparable to that observed with known linear chitooligomers. The influence of GlcNAc substitution of the calixarene skeleton on binding affinity for CD69 receptor was more profound, and the corresponding tetravalent cluster containing thiourea functionalities displayed very potent inhibitory activity, with \u2013logIC50 as high as 9.3, making it one of the best ligands for this receptor. The use of glycoconjugates with lower valency led to a dramatic decrease of the binding activity. In addition, the immunostimulating activity of the tetravalent glycoconjugate indicated a proliferation and stimulation of natural cytotoxicity of human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) at concentrations of 10\u2212 4 and 10\u2212 8 M, as observed for lipopolysaccharide. Moreover, at these concentrations, it induced an increase in the spontaneous death of tumor targets. Generally, calyx sugar derivatives were superior to the corresponding dendritic PAMAM-GlcNAc8 analogues (see next).",

In the solid-phase model system involving VAA lectin and using the absorbed glycoprotein asialofetuin (ASF), the inhibitory potency of the hexa- and octavalent galactoside clusters were 5 and 8 \u03bcM, respectively, corresponding roughly to a 100-fold enhancement as compared to free galactose. As demonstrated with solid-phase and cell-binding assays, clustering on macrocycles was also particularly effective toward galectin-4. In fact, among the human lectins, different response patterns were registered, the tandem-repeat-type galectin-4 reacted very sensitively to the presence of these test compounds. The IC50 value for the lactoside cluster was lowered by a factor of 300-fold relative to the free sugar, when calculating the sugar concentration in the assay. These bioassays underlined clear intergalectin differences and dependence of inhibition on the conformational properties of the calix[n]arenes scaffold, as well as on the shape and valency of the glycoclusters.",

Its concept is based on the concentration of PS in target cells and upon subsequent irradiation with visible light in the presence of oxygen, leading to specific destruction of the target cells or tissues. There is general agreement that the principal mechanism whereby cell destruction occurs involves the disruption of the cellular, mitochondrial, or nuclear membranes by singlet oxygen (1O2) generated by the action of the PS.150 Photofrin\u00ae, the first PDT formulation introduced, has been approved in several countries including USA, Canada, Netherlands, France, Germany, and Japan for treatment of bladder, esophageal, gastric, cervical, and lung cancers, and several other diseases. Although Photofrin\u00ae is effective against a number of malignancies, it is not an ideal PS because of the lack of a well-defined structure, its weak absorbance in the red region of the visible spectrum and the long-lasting skin photosensitivity induced. Mainly because of these drawbacks, several other derivatives have been synthesized with the required peripheral substituents, such as carbohydrate residues to control water solubility, biodistribution, pharmacokinetics, and affinity\u2013selectivity for cancer cells.143, 147 Hence, glycoconjugation can advantageously modify the amphiphilic\u2013lipophilic balance of macrocycles and can favor specific interactions of the resulting conjugates with the lectin receptors usually overexpressed in certain malignant cells. Glycoconjugation may thus be a potentially effective strategy for targeting PS toward tumor cells and allow a more efficient and selective PDT treatment. To illustrate this concept, some recent studies leading to efficient glycosylated PS are presented later.",

The results indicated efficient internalization of the glycoconjugates, preferentially in the membranes of all cytoplasmic organelles, with the extent of uptake dependent upon the nature of the sugar component, its anomeric configuration, and the linker used. An increase in the spacer length linking the tetrapyrrolic ring and the sugar moiety resulted in higher cellular uptake in the case of 132a (O-\u03b2-Gal), 132d (S-\u03b2-Gal), and 132c (O-\u03b1-Man), while a considerable decrease in drug internalization was observed for 132b (O-\u03b1-Gal). Hence, these results highlighted the importance of the amphiphilic/lipophilic character of these clusters, indicating that high lipophilicity led to low cellular uptake. The binding affinity toward the sugar-specific receptors on Y79 cells has also been investigated by examining a possible competition effect between the glycoporphyrins and the corresponding glycosylated albumin, indicating inhibition of uptake values of 40\u201345%, possibly due to cell\u2013sugar\u2013receptor saturation.

Interestingly, incorporation of the elongated conjugate 145 in DMPC induced the formation of larger vesicles than the phospholipid ones (diameter of 218 vs. 185 nm) while compound 144 mixed poorly, leading to smaller and less stable vesicles probably because of repulsive interaction between sugar moieties in the vicinity of the phospholipid headgroups. Moreover, 1 h of contact between the mixed liposome containing 145 and Con A, led to a dramatic increase of the vesicle diameter (up to 2510 nm) and polydispersity was observed. These striking results were postulated to originate from the long spacer, which would increase the mobility of the mannoside moieties and thus facilitate their interactions with the lectin. In addition, the existence of Con A dimers and tetramers at the pH studied, allowed lectin interaction with more than one porphyrin molecules possibly borne by different liposomes. Such multiple interactions would lead to the formation of a network of vesicles bridged by Con A molecules, resulting in a dramatic increase in their apparent size. Such liposomes bearing glycodendronized phenylporphyrin could constitute an efficient carrier for drug targeting in PDT.",

The versatile reactivity of the terminal alkene has been exploited in different ways to produce glycoclusters exhibiting a variety of linking functional groups, such as thioether, ether, and thiourea. With this strategy, the higher-valent D-glucose-centered glycocluster 155 containing 15 peripheral epitopes has also been obtained. The IC50 values of the pentavalent clusters 152\u03b1 and 152\u03b2 (27 and 31 \u03bcM, respectively) were indicative of strong Con A affinity relative to the reference methyl \u03b1-D-mannopyranoside, corresponding to a 6.4 and 5.5-fold enhancement on a per mannoside basis. A tetravalent analogue (153) containing an aglyconic oxygen atom presented identical avidity, indicating that multivalent presentation through four branches is sufficient to elicit a cluster effect. In sharp contrast, replacement of the 1-thiomannose wedges with \u03b1-D-mannopyranosylthioureido units virtually abolished any multivalent or statistic effects, along with a dramatic decrease of binding affinity. Alternatively, the 15-valent ligand 155, possessing classical O-glycosidic linkages, was a very efficient inhibitor of the Con A\u2013yeast mannan association (IC50 of 18.5 \u03bcM). However, the valency-corrected relative potency was about one-half that of the pentavalent derivatives. Those results illustrated the potential of carbohydrates as multivalent scaffolds for glycocluster synthesis and underlined the importance of careful design of the overall architecture in optimizing glycocluster recognition by specific lectins. As mentioned in the introduction, the TRIS scaffold is NOT optimized for simultaneous binding without the utilization of elongated spacers that allow several lectins to bind the maximum accessible sugar ligands.",

            "text": "A remarkable example of a biologically relevant D-glucose-centered glycocluster has been achieved by Kitov et al., who designed an oligovalent, water-soluble carbohydrate ligand named STARFISH having subnanomolar inhibitory activity toward Shiga-like toxin I (SLT-I).23 Shiga toxin (Stx) and Shiga-like toxins (SLTs or VTs (Verotoxins) are ribosome-inactivating proteins that act as N-glycosylases, cleaving several nucleobases from the RNA, and thereby halting eukaryotic protein biosynthesis. Infection by bacteria that produce SLTs results in serious gastrointestinal and urinary tract disorders, and is known to cause a potentially lethal disease, the hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS), that may result in kidney failure. Stx is produced by Shigella dysenteria, whereas SLTs are produced by the Shiga toxigenic group of E. coli (STEC), including serotype O157:H7 and enterohemorrhagic E. coli (EHEC). The E. coli toxins can be further divided into SLT-I and SLT-II having conserved structures in the binding sites, and the SLT-II edema variant (SLT-Iie). Like CT, SLTs belong to a family of bacterial enterotoxins harboring a hexameric AB5 structure, where A denotes a cytotoxic enzyme located above the center of one face of the B5-subunit, which represents a symmetrical homopentameric lectin-like carbohydrate-recognizing complex having a doughnut shape that facilitates delivery and entry of the A component into the cell of the host.165 The SLT-I is virtually identical both in structure and mechanism of action to the toxin expressed by S. dysenteria, having similar B-subunits and differing only in one residue (Ser45 vs. Thr45) in their A-subunits. The in vivo receptor of Stx and SLTs is the trisaccharide portion (P\nk) of the neutral glycolipid, globotriosylceramide (GbOse3 or Gb3, \u03b1Gal-(1-4)\u03b2Gal(1-4)\u03b2Glc(1-1)ceramide), present in greater amounts on the surfaces of kidney glomerular endothelial cells, to which the renal toxicity of Stx may be attributed (Fig. 17\n).",

            "text": "When the crystallographic structures of the protein or carbohydrate-ligated proteins are known, it is possible to model multivalent oligosaccharide inhibitors. As mentioned, the SLTs possess five noncovalent B-subunits per molecule and each subunit presents three carbohydrate-binding domains. Therefore, oligovalency \u201ctailored\u201d to the structure of the B-subunit pentamer offers the best opportunity for designing higher affinity inhibitors, as 15 binding sites are symmetrically arranged across the toxin surface that engages the cell membrane. Thus, highly selective, potent binding of SLTs to Gb\n3 is mainly attributed to the multiple interaction of the B-subunit pentamer with the trisaccharide moiety on Gb\n3. On the basis of these facts, several SLTs antagonists in which this trisaccharide moiety was combined using various dendritic core structures have been reported. Among these, the foregoing study in particular afforded spectacular results and effectiveness in neutralizing SLTs infection. Hence, the use of the crystal structure of the B5 subunit of E. coli 0157:H7 SLT-IB in conjunction with an analogue of its carbohydrate receptor allowed the design of tailored multivalent glycocluster 160 bearing 10 peripheral functionalized P\nk residues. Structurally, this decavalent cluster, named STARFISH, comprised a radially symmetrical star-shaped carbohydrate backbone (D-glucose) with pairs of Gb\n3 trisaccharides at the tip of each arm, ideally spaced and oriented to be simultaneously engaged by each the B-subunits and thus to permit pentavalent interaction with SLTs. To achieve this display of tethered ligands, a glucose molecule was chosen as the central core for adequate pentavalent presentation, via its derivatization as pentaallyl ethers, free-radical reaction with thioglycolic acid, and subsequent chain elongation of the radial arms. Each of them was designed to span ~ 30 \u00c5 from the central core of the toxin and the tether was adapted to bridge binding sites 1 and 2 on each B-subunit. ELISA and solid-phase inhibition assays indicated the highest molar activity of any inhibitor reported, with subnanomolar inhibitory activity against STL-I and II (IC50 of 0.4 and 6 nM, respectively), thus being 1\u201310-million-fold higher than that of monovalent ligand. Furthermore, the ability of the inhibitors to protect host cells against a lethal dose of SLT-I in culture could be determined by using Vero cells. Cytotoxicity assays indicated that STARFISH inhibitor 160 provided effective protection of Vero cells cultured in the presence of SLT-I (IC50 of 1.19 \u03bcM) and SLT-II (IC50 of 1.58 \u03bcM), even over a 2-day coincubation period. Interestingly, the crystal structure showed that one STARFISH molecule bound to not just one but to two B-subunit pentamers. Instead of binding sites 1 and 2, the tethered P\nk-trisaccharides of STARFISH bound to two B-subunit monomers from separate toxin molecules. As, in the experiment, the concentration of STARFISH was sufficient to form a 1:1 complex, it was suggested that the formation of a 2:1 sandwich must be thermodynamically favored, as for the CT. Extended investigations have been made by the same group in order to circumvent the differentiation of SLT-I and SLT-II during biological studies. In fact, STARFISH 160 protected mice when it was injected subcutaneously in admixture with a lethal dose of SLT-I but not SLT-II, and it also reduced the distribution of 125I-STL-I but not 125I-STL-II to the murine kidney and brain. Modification of the nature and length on the linkage between the oligosaccharide component and the backbone (thereby increasing the flexibility of the tether) was then necessary to protect against the more-toxic SLT-II.166\n",

The numerous successes encountered in the SPS of various peptide-based conjugates, coupled to the ease of preparation and purification of complex derivatives, have motivated chemists to apply this methodology to synthesis of peptide glycoclusters. Hence, linear peptides containing a glycocluster head group (172, 173),184 multivalent cyclic neoglycopeptides including, for instance, three N-acetylglucosamine residues (174),185 and multitopic biotinylated glycoclusters build on a topological cyclodecapeptide template (175\u2013179)186 represent remarkable illustrations of this powerful and straightforward methodology (Fig. 21\n).",

The synthetic peptide-core (180) bearing five galactosylamine residues were assayed for their ability to block CT B pentamer binding to ganglioside-coated plates. Interestingly, ligands having longer or shorter linkers than optimal exhibited a loss in inhibitory power, demonstrating that when a ligand's effective dimension is not matching that of its target, there is a decrease in the ligand's affinity. Submicromolar IC50 values were obtained for the best derived ligand (180), depending on the core size, which ranged from 2.5 to 6 \u00c5. The resulting glycoclusters presented a more than 105-fold increase over monovalent galactose, which had an IC50 of ~ 100 mM in the same receptor-binding inhibitory assay.",

SPR competition-binding assay with Con A indicated the absence of nonspecific interactions induced by the template, and highlighted the fact that 187 promoted rather than inhibited binding of Con A to the mannose-substituted lipid surface. The data suggested that the glycocluster was able to bind two or three Con A tetramers simultaneously and to form soluble clusters with high avidity for immobilized ligands. Assay by FRET showed the reversibility of the phenomenon, and corroborated the fact that clustering of Con A by 187 did not depend on subsequent precipitation or cluster binding to a surface.

A few years later, the same group optimized the structure, incorporating five copies of the more potent m-nitrophenyl \u03b1-D-galactoside (MNPG) derivatives rather than five copies of \u03b2-D-galactose.199 The ~ 100-fold higher single-site affinity enhancement of MNPG for the binding site of the toxin relative to galactose was found to yield a proportionate increase in the affinity and IC50 measured for the respective pentavalent constructs. Indeed, ELISA experiments involving CTB pentamer revealed an IC50 of 0.9 \u03bcM for 201 (R = R2), corresponding to about an 18-fold affinity enhancement over 200 (R = R1). These results demonstrated that improved affinity for a single-site ligand confers a parallel improvement in the affinity of a pentavalent construct presenting five copies of the same ligand. Furthermore, from DLS studies and crystallographic data, it resulted that a 1:1 CTB/201 complex was the major mode of association in solution between the ligand and the toxin. The lead structure 201 was then affined with the incorporation of guanidine-bridged poly(ethylene glycol)s of various lengths, in order to enhance its water solubility. Thus, compound 202 (R = R3) having an optimized effective dimension for strong affinity, displayed an IC50 of 6 nM, being lower than that of the natural receptor GM1, and which represented the first multivalent ligand based on a simple galactoside having nanomolar affinity against CTB.200 During parallel investigations, spectacular improvement has been observed with the construction of a family of complex ligands having five flexible arms, each ending with a bivalent ligand 203 (R = R4).201 ELISA tests revealed that the improved decavalent derivatives were significantly more potent, showing affinities for CTB an order of magnitude better than the corresponding nonbranched ligands. More precisely, a more than 106-fold enhancement in inhibitory power over the monovalent ligand was achieved with the best decavalent candidate 203 (with n = 4) with an IC50 of 40 nM, a value that lies in the same range as the IC50 of the natural receptor (50 nM). Dynamic light-scattering studies demonstrated the formation of concentration-dependent unique 1:1 and 1:2 ligand\u2013toxin discrete complexes in solution, with no sign of formation of large aggregates. Crystallographic studies confirmed that the decavalent inhibitor resulted in a \u201csandwich arrangement\u201d of two B pentamers facing each other and bridged by the ligand. The improvement in IC50 displayed by the decavalent ligands might be attributed to a substantial difference in affinity between the galactose fragment within the pentavalent ligand and the rather short, nonspanning bivalent galactose moiety present in the decavalent ligand.",

The first example described a strategy for synthesis of [60]fullerenols carrying mono- and bis-\u03b1-D-mannopyranosides (Scheme 21\n).221 The methodology was based on initial thermal coupling of 2-azidoethyl mannopyranoside (33) and an equimolar amount of C\n60 in chlorobenzene, giving a mixture of two isomeric monoadducts (\u03b1-D-mannosyl [5,6]-azafulleroid, 233a, and \u03b1-D-mannosyl [6,6]-aziridinofullerene, 233b)222 and a bismannosylated adduct 234. Subsequent simultaneous deacetylation and polyhydroxylation were then conducted in the presence of tetra-n-butylammonium hydroxide (TBAH) in aqueous NaOH, to afford deprotected mono- (236) and bisfullerenols (237) with an average of heterogeneously distributed 29 OH groups per C60. Biological evaluations, notably involving lectin-induced HAI assay with an \u03b1-D-mannoside-specific lectin (Con A), revealed that mono- and bis-mannosyl fullerenols exhibited diminished activity for both binding to Con A and aggregating erythrocytes as compared to the activity of mannosylated neoglycopolymers. A few years later, a similar grafting methodology was used to generate a series of mono- and bis-sugar-pendant [60]fullerene derivatives prepared from a variety of carbohydrate-linked azides.223 The phototoxicity of the corresponding deprotected glycoconjugates was evaluated for potential applications in PDT. Substantial production of singlet oxygen (1O2) under laser irradiation (355 nm) was observed for both adducts, notably for the monosugar derivatives, which shown a better photosensitizing ability. In addition, in vitro studies involving HeLa cells confirmed their photocytotoxicity and indicated a carbohydrate-dependent efficiency. In line with previous work, another application has been proposed which described the formation of stable self-assembling structures in aqueous solvents from the deprotected bis(\u03b1-D-mannopyranosyl)-[60]fullerene conjugate 235.224 The diameters of the resulting large aggregates (100\u2013300 nm), resembling bilayer vesicles or unadulterated liposomes, were determined by DLS and AFM. These supramolecular structures were able to encapsulate Ba2+ ions and such organic molecules as Acridine Red, constituting for instance, promising candidates for slow drug delivery. The ability of these mannofullerenes to bind to a mannoside-recognizing lectin (Con A) was also investigated. Colloidal suspensions of the stable self-assembling structure 235 presented higher blocking activity than the two monoadducts, with an interesting submicromolar MIC (minimum inhibitory concentration) value in a lectin-induced hemagglutination assay. This strong protein-binding activity has been rationalized by the authors by the fact that the fullerene scaffold allowed a spatial arrangement of the bis(mannopyranoside) moiety that could mimic 3,6-branched \u03b1-D-trimannoside, a natural ligand of Con A. Unfortunately, this methodology often generates mixture of diversely substituted adducts, difficult to separate, in rather low yields and presenting only very limited solubility in water.",

            "text": "An alternative synthetic approach, first developed by Bingel225 allowed the efficient nucleophilic cyclopropanation of fullerenes via their reaction with bromomalonate derivatives in the presence of base. This approach, the most reliable method for the synthesis of functionalized methanofullerenes, combined the advantages of mild reaction conditions, good yields, and exclusive formation of [6,6]-bridged adducts. Furthermore, the degree of functionalization could be controlled by the stoichiometry of the malonate derivatives for access to higher adducts in one step (bis up to hexakis). This methodology suffers, however, from the complexity of preparing the bromomalonates, often generating mixtures of mono- and di-bromo derivatives with similar chromatographic properties. An optimized methodology has then been proposed by Camp and Hirsch that avoids the use of bromomalonates by direct treatment of the fullerene with malonates in the presence of CBr4 (or I2) and DBU (1,8-diazabicyclo-[5.4.0]undec-7-ene).226 It has been exploited in collaborative work describing the synthesis of amphiphilic glycofullerodendrimers and their incorporation into Langmuir and Langmuir\u2013Blodgett films (Scheme 22\n).227 The synthesis of the first C60-dendrimer conjugate containing one glycodendron headgroup started from the treatment of C60 with diethyl malonate (238) in the presence of CBr4 and DBU to furnish the monoadduct 239a in 57% yield (Scheme 22). A clean formation of 239b from its diester 239a was accomplished in toluene with a 20-fold molar excess of NaH at 60 \u00b0C.228 DCC (N,N'-dicyclohexylcarbodiimide)-mediated double amide bond formation between 239b and the O-acetylated trisglucoside wedge 240,229 accompanied by monodecarboxylation of the starting material allowed the formation of glyco-fullerodendron 241 in 32% yield. The bisadduct 247 was synthesized via the same synthetic pathway through preliminary coupling with DCC\u2013DMAP-mediated esterification of m-benzenedimethanol (242) with malonic acid monoester 243 in 83% yield. The resulting bismalonate derivative 244 was then engaged in double-Bingel macrocyclization with C60 to afford the C\ns-symmetrical cis-2 bisadduct 245 in 22% yield. Subsequent selective cleavage of the tert-butyl ester under acidic conditions provided the desired diacid core 246,230 which was finally treated with the glycodendron 240 under the foregoing conditions to yield glycofullerodendrimer 247 exhibiting six peripherally protected glucopyranoside residues. With this work, the authors highlighted the preponderant role of the bulky glycodendron headgroups on C60 that formed a compact insulating layer around the carbon sphere, avoiding the general propensity of amphipilic fullerene derivatives to aggregate irreversibly. Hence, both amphiphilic fullerenes 241 and 247 were able to form stable, ordered monomolecular Langmuir layers at the air\u2013water interface and showed reversible behavior in successive compression\u2013expansion cycles. In addition, the monolayers were transferred successfully as X-type Langmuir\u2013Blodgett films onto quartz slides for anticipated applications as biosensors.",

Toward this goal, they developed fullerene glycoconjugate 258, where two dendritic branches terminated by six deprotected \u03b1-D-mannopyranosyl building blocks were connected through two adjacent imino bridges to the all-carbon framework (Scheme 24\n). Moreover, in this type of C60 adduct, which constitutes a 1,9-dihydro-1a-aza-1(2)a-homo(C60-I\nh)[5,6]fullerene derivative, the entire 60-\u03c0-electron system of the fullerene core was retained. For its preparation, AB3 glycosylated dendritic building blocks were first synthesized by preliminary protection of Newkome's dendron 251\n232 with benzyl chloroformate (CbzCl), then treatment with formic acid for orthogonal and quantitative cleavage of the tert-butyl ester to give triacid 252 upon which, peptide coupling with 2-aminoethyl 2,3,4,6-tetra-O-acetyl-\u03b1-D-mannopyranoside 253 provided trimannoside 254 in 83% yield. Selective removal of the Cbz protecting group by hydrogenolysis gave the corresponding amine in quantitative yield, which was engaged without further purification with a suitable linker bearing a terminal azide group, namely 2-[2-(2-azidoethoxy) ethoxy]acetyl fluoride (255), in the presence of DMAP in CH2Cl2 to provide the azido oligo(ethylene glycol)-terminated glycodendron 256 in 94% yield.

Separation and purification by column chromatography gave regioselectively the twofold cluster-opened diazabishomofullerene adduct 257, but in only 8% yield. Finally, quantitative deprotection under standard Zempl\u00e9n conditions provided 258. This C60 glycoconjugates having six peripheral mannoside residues is the most water-soluble fullereno sugar (> 40 mg/mL) known. Its amphiphilic nature, with a cone-shaped structure, triggered the formation of small supramolecular aggregates in aqueous solutions (observed in DOSY NMR and corroborated by TEM investigations), as uniform spherical micelles with an extremely narrow size distribution.

The first successful example was realized through noncovalent functionalization by wrapping synthetic and biocompatible water-soluble polymers around the SWNTs. The formation of supramolecular complexes in solution between SWNTs and the preformed helical structure of starch (a polymer composed of the linear amylose and branched amylopectin) has been investigated.246 The enhanced water solubility of the supramolecular complexes was significant, and further investigations suggested that the presence of the preformed helical structures of amylose may not be required.247 Other studies examplifying complexation of the SWNTs with CDs have also yielded some interesting results.248\n",

Incubation of 276 with a solution of HPA conjugated with fluorescein isothiocyanate (HPA-FITC), and appropriate subsequent treatment led to significant fluorescence that was attributed to a dependent receptor\u2013ligand interaction. Moreover, studies under similar conditions but involving glycoconjugates bearing the \u03b2 anomer of GalNAc manifested no significant fluorescence labeling. Hence, the lectin did not interact with the coated nanotubes in the absence of its favored ligand.

Two parallel experiments were conducted, on one hand involving the preformed complex of HPA-FITC with C18-\u03b1-MM-coated CNTs incubated with chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells, and on the other the preincubation of CHO cells with unmodified HPA and subsequent treatment with modified C18-\u03b1-MM-coated CNTs containing the fluorescent dye Texas Red. In both instances, analysis by fluorescence microscopy and flow cytometry suggested the formation of the tricomponent \u03b1-GalNAc-HPA\u2013CNT\u2013cell surfaces complex, and with a dose- and precomplexation-dependent labeling for the second study. Control CNTs modified with C18-\u03b2-MM-CNTs indicated no significant fluorescent labeling at low concentration. In conclusion, demonstration that lipid-terminated poly(MVK)-based glycopolymers could coat CNT surfaces and promote their binding to cells through receptor\u2013ligand interactions has been demonstrated. Modified CNTs were nontoxic to cultured cells (CHO and Jurkat cells), but irregular surface and nonuniform thickness of the CNTs coating might be explained by the high polydispersities (> 1.7) of the polymers employed. The surface heterogeneity generated could constitute a drawback to the systematic use in a reproducible way of glycopolymer-coated CNTs as sensors of protein binding.",

Toward this goal, \u03b2-D-galactopyranoside dendrons Gal2-NH2 (292a), Gal4-NH2 (295a), and their analogous \u03b1-D-mannopyranoside dendrons Man2-NH2 (292b), and Man4-NH2 (295b) were efficiently prepared by a systematic synthetic sequence based on the use of trisubstituted benzene cores (Scheme 31\n).

After 32 h at room temperature, the authors recorded enrichment in the \u039b-mer isomer, which in the end comprised 85% of the total isomers (vs. 15% in the native mixture). These experimental observations suggested that the dynamic equilibrium seen at room temperature allowed the spatial arrangement of the three GalNAc residues to self-adjust in order to provide a better complementarity to the multivalent carbohydrate-binding sites of the lectin.269 This tendency was confirmed with studies involving other GalNAc-specific lectins, such as Glycine max, specific for a terminal \u03b1-D-GalNAc residue attached to the 3\u2032-OH group of galactose. Selective enrichment of other diastereoisomers has been observed, indicating the adaptability of the process for lectins presenting different shape and functionnalities in their carbohydrate-binding pockets.

As expected, all compounds exhibited different extents of quenching, depending on the degree of peripheral carbohydrate density that efficiently insulated the core properties. The rate of energy transfer induced by photoexcitation of the complexes was also evaluated by quantification of molecular oxygen in the singlet state trapped by a quencher (TEMPO). The rate of appearance of the generated stable species (TEMPO) decreased from 398 to 400, thus supporting the notion that dense carbohydrate insulation of the Ru(II) template presents a shield that stopped effective energy transfer to dissolved oxygen. In addition, the selectivity and sensitivity of these processes have been studied by use of complexes as lectin biosensors. ConA and Galanthus nivilis agglutinin (GNA), both tetramers that contain one and three mannose-binding sites per subunit, respectively, were selected for these investigations. The concept was based on the reconstitution of the fluorescent signal when preliminary complexes between the BBV quencher and mannosylated-complexes were disrupted in favor of the tight interactions that take place between glycodendrimers and lectins. A spontaneous gain in fluoresecence was observed with the addition of 75 nM of ConA to the initial mixture of hexavalent complex and BBV. In contrast, more modest gains in fluorescence were obtained for dendrimers containing 18 mannosides under the same conditions, but a steady and linear increment continued at higher concentrations of ConA. Similar experiments with the higher valency lectin GNA induced the same tendency. Based on these results, detection limits for each Ru-complex were evaluated and compared, indicating that hexavalent glycoconjugate 398 was the most sensitive; whereas a higher detection limit was determined for 399 and 400 which exhibited a broader limited range of linear response. In conclusion, although complex 398 represented the best compromise between encapsulation and efficient quenching properties for sensitive lectin sensing, glycodendrimers 399 and 400 were also suitable sensitive biomarkers to study lectin\u2013carbohydrate interactions, owing to their high quantum yield and excellent lectin-affinity through their high carbohydrate density.",

Dendritic scaffolds were prepared by a convergent \u201coutside-in\u201d approach.281 This iterative methodology was based on a single building block (403) obtained by the coupling of methyl 3,5-diaminobenzoate and 4-(tert-Boc-aminomethyl)benzoic acid. Selective cleavage of the methyl ester group to give 404, and subsequent removal of the N-Boc group liberated 405, comprising the G(1) dendrimer generation with two amine end groups. Its coupling with 404, followed by orthogonal methyl ester cleavage furnished 408, a G(2) dendrimer generation containing four terminal anchorage functions. The third-generation dendrimer, with eight end groups, was obtained by treatment of 408 with 404. The same procedure was repetitively applied to yield dendrimers with up to 64 end groups, corresponding to the sixth generation. The peripheral amines of the glycodendrons of each generation were isolated as TFA salts and further transformed by introduction of chloroacetamide groups, using a large excess of chloroacetic anhydride in DMF, leading to complete conversion. Subsequent introduction of thiolated oligosaccharides such as 401 (Galili antigen) and 402 (Lac-SH) onto the dendritic cores was realized in the final step of the synthetic sequence in the presence of DBU, to afford water-soluble glycodendrimers 406, 409, 410a, and 410b (not shown; sixth generation) presenting a controlled number of peripheral oligosaccharidic residues based on the generation (Scheme 43\n).",

Measurements indicated the formation of small aggregates of 50 kDa for the first generation (406) whereas the tetravalent analogue 409 formed large particles of 7000 kDa, corresponding to the aggregation of more than 1500 individual molecules per particle. Surprisingly, the particle weight obtained with higher generation dendrimers decreased with increasing mass of the individual molecule. Furthermore, the third-generation glycodendrimers 410, containing eight (RS- or R1S-) residues, exhibited similar size and weight, indicating that particle structure depended primarily on the dendritic core architecture, and less on the size and the nature of the carbohydrate group. The synthesis of several dendritic cores containing more branched aliphatic components in their structures, such as cyclohexyl rings, linear alkyl chains, or methylated amides demonstrated that only highly aromatic architectures induced aggregation as a result of \u03c0-stacking, hydrophobic interactions, and rigidity.281 The authors assumed that intramolecular \u03c0-stacking led to preorganization, allowing efficient core\u2013core contacts. An optimal core\u2013core interaction was recorded for the second generation, whereas the lowest generation dendrimer was too small and the largest ones were too shielded by the dense carbohydrates. In addition, both the shape and the size of these homogenous nanoparticles (within a factor of 2) was investigated by AFM, indicating a disk-like morphology, having average diameters decreasing with increasing mass of the individual molecule, thus resembling their tendency in solution.",

In agreement with previous results, monomeric \u03b1Gal was inactive at 100 \u03bcM in both assays. Whereas no activity was observed for the divalent conjugate, the second- and third-generation dendrimers 409 and 410 were highly potent in both assays (0.025, 0.035 \u03bcM and 0.010, 0.010 \u03bcM, respectively). The fourth-generation analogue, containing 16 peripheral \u03b1Gal residues, also showed high potency in the binding assay (0.019 \u03bcM) but was significantly less potent in the hemolysis assay (0.18 \u03bcM). Generally, potency decreased drastically for the larger dendrimers which did not induce aggregation. The avidity thus correlated with the size of the aggregates, but not with the size of the individual particles. Preliminary in vitro results highlighted the involvment of polyvalent aggregates in antibody binding, without nonspecific interactions of the dendrimer backbone. The most potent compound (410) bearing eight trisaccharidic epitopes, was selected for in vivo profiling in cynomolgus monkeys. Within 5 min after injection, the anti-\u03b1Gal IgMs detected by ELISA were diminished to 20% of the initial value determined prior to the administration, and remained at low levels for more than 4 h. Most importantly, anti-\u03b1Gal antibody-mediated hemolytic activity was completely eliminated.",

Although differences exist in terms of rigidity and compaction, dendrimers are often compared to \u201cartificial proteins\u201d with their semiglobular or globular structures, mostly with a high density of peripheral functionalities and a small molecular \u201cvolume.\u201d284, 285 It is now accepted that dendritic polymers are the fourth major class of polymeric architecture, consisting of three subsets that are based on the degree of structural control, namely: (a) random hyperbranched polymers, (b) dendrigraft polymers, and (c) dendrimers. The concept of repetitive and controlled synthetic growth with branching was first reported by V\u00f6gtle, who achieved the construction of a low molecular weight \u201ccascade\u201d polyamine.286 However, it was not until 1985 that the groups of Newkome287 and Tomalia288 independently described a divergent macromolecular synthesis, giving birth to the first well-characterized true dendrimers, named \u201carborols\u201d and \u201cPAMAM\u201d [poly(amidoamine)] dendrimers, respectively. Their strategy thus efficiently avoided problems of low yields, purity, or purification encountered by V\u00f6gtle in his cascade synthesis. In their chapter, Tomalia et al. paved the way to dendritic structures: their definition and construction, and introducing for the first time the term \u201cdendrimer,\u201d which arises from the Greek dendron meaning \u201ctree\u201d or \u201cbranch,\u201d and meros meaning \u201cpart.\u201d Their original and efficient methodology still constitutes the preferred commercial route to the trademarked Starburst\u00ae dendrimer family, with molecular weights ranging from several hundred to over 1 million Daltons (namely, generations 1\u201313). Until the mid-1990s, the synthetic challenge of such aesthetic structures stimulated numerous research groups to investigate intensively a range of synthetic strategies. These efforts gave rise to original dendritic structures emerging from two main synthetic strategies used to construct perfectly branched dendrimers: the divergent and the convergent approach. Over time, an accelerated version of the convergent strategy has been developed in order to increase its throughput and efficiency by using clever adaptations of cores or dendrons.",

Dendrimers are built iteratively out from a central core, layer by layer, requiring activation/addition steps to afford the desired dendritic structures: the focal and multifunctional molecules are systematically expanded outward using various chemical linkages. The first-generation dendrimer is simply formed by attaching branching units to the core molecules. To form the second-generation dendrimer, the peripheral functional groups then react with a complementary chemical function presented on the branched building blocks. To avoid hyperbranched polymerization, this step has to be carefully controlled by using protected (or inert) groups on the building blocks. Activation (deprotection or chemical transformation) of the newly attached surface groups leads to the second-generation dendrimer. The generation growth quickly allows exponential multiplication of active terminal functions, and the process is repeated until the required degree of branching is obtained. For glycodendrimers, the sugars are then appended at the periphery of the molecules. Although this approach is conceptually straightforward, synthetic problems are sometimes encountered, involving the use of very large excess of reagent (or monomer) in each synthetic step to ensure complete functionalization and the necessity of efficient coupling in regard to the exponentially increasing number of functions. To accentuate the difficulty, and although monomers are generally easy to remove, separation of the required dendrimer from the structurally flawed by-products usually remains challenging, because of their mass, size, and general properties that are very close to the perfect dendrimer. For the sake of simplicity and diminished cost, the inner scaffold portion of the glycodendrimer can be either synthesized by a one-pot procedure using hyperbranched polymer methodologies, or purchased directly. Indeed, several dendrimers having various surface functionalities and building blocks are commercially available: polyamidoamine dendrimers (PAMAM, Starburst\u00ae, Dendritic Nanotechnologies), polypropyleneimine (PPI, Astramol\u00ae, DSM Fine Chemicals), polyglycerol dendrimers, and hyperbranched dendritic polymers (Boltorn\u00ae), are most commonly used as multibranched dendritic core or glycodendron precursors, and most of them are known to be nontoxic and nonimmunogenic.",

It involves the preliminary synthesis of peripheral branched dendritic arms, named \u201cdendrons\u201d or \u201cglycodendrons,\u201d from the \u201coutside-in.\u201d This concept can be described by envisaging the attachment of X terminal units containing one reactive group to one polyfunctional monomer possessing orthogonally protected functionalities, resulting in the first-generation dendron. Transformation of the unique focal site, followed by treatment with 1/X equivalent of the protected monomer or a polyfunctional central core affords the next higher generation dendron or a dendrimer. The advantages of the convergent strategy lie with the diminished number of reactions carried out in each step. Moreover, purification of the desired dendrimer becomes less problematic than in the divergent case, fewer by-products are generated and they are structurally very different from the perfect target dendrimer. However, the fact that the focal functionalities of the wedge may be sterically inaccessible from within the infrastructure (depending on the generation) causes difficulties toward subsequent linkage to the core, thus resulting in slower and less efficient reactions as the generation grows. Nevertheless, it is now well established that a large number of surface glycan moieties impede accessibility of the carbohydrate by carbohydrate-binding receptors. Considering these synthetic advantages, this methodology has been used successfully for access to dissymmetric dendritic structures.300\n",

More recently, another clever strategy based on \u201corthogonal monomer systems\u201d has been designed.305, 306 The judicious use of functionalized building blocks that are coupled together without need of protection/deprotection steps has allowed rapid and easy access to homogeneous and heterogeneous dendrimers.",

One of their first applications was to prevent tissue infection by the pentameric bacterial toxin from V. cholerae. The approach for preventing binding of CT-GM1 consisted in considering the terminal galactose residue (Fig. 9) as the anchoring fragment, to which various pharmacophores could be attached to provide optimized small-molecule antagonists against CT. This strategy was based on the fact that this galactose residue bound very specifically at a buried pocket of the receptor-binding site. However, the rest of the binding site is very shallow and lacks well-defined hydrophobic pockets that can be exploited using traditional structure-based drug design to arrive at potent inhibitors. Initial studies were made by screening commercially available galactose derivatives. Using ELISA, it resulted that m-nitrophenyl \u03b1-D-galactopyranoside (MNPG) was the best inhibitor identified, with an IC50 of 720 \u03bcM, corresponding to a 100-fold better affinity for CT than that of the \u201clead\u201d galactoside.307 In addition, a small library of antagonists showing up to 14-fold improvement as compared to the best MNPG candidate was designed. The library consisted of 3,5-disubstituted phenyl galactosides (as \u03b1/\u03b2 anomeric mixtures), in which a hydrophobic ring-system was linked via a short, flexible aliphatic linker through an amide linkage at the remaining meta position of the MNPG core.308\n",

This value corresponded to an eightfold enhancement as compared to corresponding monovalent lactoside derivative under the same conditions.

Interestingly, the valency of the inhibitor had a dramatic effect on the mechanism of aggregation, influencing both the kinetics of aggregation and the stability of intermediate protein complexes. In addition, structural studies employing AFM have revealed that a divalent inhibitor induced head-to-head dimerization of the protein toxin, which either prevented the LTBh pentamer from sitting flat on the surface, or gave rise to a protein bilayer. Considering that tetravalent structures were shown to be more potent inhibitors than pentavalent analogues of similar size, the development of a strategy based on the use of mismatched valencies may provide more relevant multivalent therapeutics against pentameric bacterial toxins, thus adding to the arsenal of multivalent strategies.",

Interestingly, O117 LPS resembles Gb3, but there are significant structural differences since Gb3 has a terminal \u03b1-(1\u21924)-digalactoside moiety, whereas the neutralizing polysaccharide has a modified terminal digalactose moiety possessing a bulky N-acetyl group at each 2-position. In contrast to Gb3, which binds to both Stx1 and Stx2, O117 LPS was not able to bind Stx1 or to neutralize its effect on Vero cells, suggesting that the N-acetyl group sufficiently modifies the binding specificity toward Stx1. Tailored biantennary glycoconjugates (435\u2013437) consisting of three structural components including peripheral carbohydrate-recognition components, flexible aliphatic spacers, and a biotinylated dimer have been synthesized with varied N-acetylation patterns. Biotin was used because it afforded ready access to multivalency as one streptavidin tetramer binds to four biotin molecules, and it can be conjugated to commercial streptavidin matrices for toxin capture. Molecules were designed such that the biotin and, hence, streptavidin were attached to the opposite end of the rigid scaffold to minimize interference by biotin in the binding event.",

In contrast and surprisingly, 436, constructed with the Gb3 analogue, bound exclusively to Stx1, probably due to the biantennary architecture with a short spacer that constrained binding to Stx2.

In initial experiments, strain ORN178 mediated the aggregation of beads coated with mannose-bearing divalent compound 438 within minutes of addition to the beads, whereas strain ORN208 did not. Bacterial aggregation has been shown to be dependent on multivalency, and these results suggested that a single bacterium could bind to multiple beads. Moreover, at higher concentrations of E. coli, the tetravalent conjugate 439 was responsible for an increase in capture effectiveness. The authors further compared their competence relative to standard antibody-coated beads for the capture of bacteria. The results indicated that the glycoconjugate-coated magnetic beads outperformed traditional antibody-coated magnetic beads in sensivity and selectivity when compared under identical experimental conditions. In addition, these systems could capture E. coli from environmental samples of stagnant water, with the possibility for targeting specific pathogenic bacteria modulating the nature of the carbohydrate recognition component.

The key AB2-type glucoside building block 440 was used for the preparation of multigeneration glycopeptide dendrons from its orthogonal deprotection, to yield complementary building blocks 441 and 442. Hence, mildly alkaline hydrolysis of the methyl ester groups led to dicarboxylic acid 441, whereas removal of the N-Boc protecting group with a TFA\u2013dimethyl sulfide mixture afforded amino-functionalized glucoside 442. HATU-mediated peptide coupling, together with DIPEA gave protected first-generation glycodendron 443 in 79% yield. Using the N-Boc-deprotection and peptide-coupling reaction sequence, the synthesis of higher generations of glycopeptide dendrons was carried out convergently. Hence, 443 was converted into its amine derivative 444, whose coupling with 441 led to protected G(2) glycopeptide dendron 445 in 60% yield. The same convergent strategy was applied for the construction of the third-generation glycodendron 447 containing eight peripheral glucoside units, via peptide coupling between 446 dendron and 441.

Binding data to E. coli indicated that all these glycodendrons performed better than the monovalent Me\u03b1Man, exceeding its inhibitory potency by one or two orders of magnitude. The small conjugate 454, consisting of three \u03b1-D-mannosyl moieties, presented the weakest inhibition (IC50 of 5.9 mmol). Its extended analogue 457, in which two \u03b1-D-mannoside units were tethered on thiahexyl spacers, performed unexpectedly well. For instance, it showed average inhibitory potency (89 \u03bcM) exceeding that of the larger glycodendron 455 (IC50 of 0.14 mmol) in which the carbohydrate moieties were spacered by propyl units. Thus, with regard to the influence of the spacer characteristics, it was concluded that conformationally flexible glycodendrons containing four peripheral mannosyl units and the longer thiahexyl spacers (such as 456 and 458, IC50 of 31 and 55 \u03bcmol, respectively) showed increased inhibitory potencies relative to their counterparts bearing propyl spacers (such as 455, the shorter analogue of 456). Furthermore, oxidation of the sulfide groups of 458, providing sulfone 459, had a pronounced negative effect on its inhibitory potency, indicating that the lipophilic properties of the spacers might also promote the affinity of a given glycoconjugate, as previously concluded.",

These interesting architectures were, however, not as potent as sialopolymers since they could not properly cover the entire surfaces of the spherical virions, a property well exploited by random-coiled polymers.333, 334 It was later argued that dendronized polymers had improved potencies in this respect (see following PAMAM section).335 When the same poly-L-lysine scaffold was utilized with mannoside residues bearing an optimized arylated aglycon, the resulting 8- and 16-mer glycodendrons showed 100,000-fold increased inhibitory potency against fimbriated E. coli K12 on a per mannoside basis.336 The structure of the 8-mer mannosylated dendrimer (501) is illustrated in Fig. 53\n. The octameric aminophenyl \u03b1-D-mannopyranoside had an IC50 of 2.8 nM (22.4 nM/Man). It was found that a competitive binding assay measuring the binding of 125I-labeled, highly mannosylated neoglycoprotein (BSA) to type-1 fimbriated E. coli (K12) strain in suspension gave much lower IC50 values than the equivalent values obtained by hemagglutination or in assays that involved microplate immobilization. Two key features strongly influencing the affinity to E. coli adhesin were: (1) the presence of an \u03b1-oriented aglycone bearing a hydrophobic group, and (2) the presence of multiple mannoside residues that can span a distance of 20 nm or longer. The two best inhibitors were a highly mannosylated neoglycoprotein with the longest linking arm between a mannose and protein amino group, and the 16-mer mannosylated dendrimer (fourth generation), with an IC50 of 0.9 nM (14.4 nM/Man).",

An excellent series of reviews by the group of Je\u017eek on the synthesis and biological applications of lysine-based glycodendrimers has been published.339, 340, 341, 342 Such glycosylated lysine dendrimers have been prepared both on solid supports343, 344, 345 and in solution.346, 347, 348 Reaction of the peripheral amino groups with a variety of electrophiles carrying pendant sugar residues (such as isothiocyanates, carboxylic acid, and reducing sugars) have lead to glycodendrimer thioureas, amides, and amines, respectively. Sugars bearing activated ester groups have also been coupled to dendritic lysines to provide galactoside- and N-acetylglucosamine-capped glycoclusters,316, 349 including the important Thomsen Friedenreich (TF) disaccharide antigen [\u03b2-D-Gal(1\u21923)-\u03b1-D-GalNAc] known as a breast cancer marker and against which monoclonal antibodies were raised (see, for instance, Fig. 45).350, 351 The corresponding TF-bearing glycodendrimers bound to the antibodies, and were shown to be adsorbed strongly onto the surface of microtiter plates. The analogous \u03b2-D-GlcNAc glycodendrimer was also further elaborated as the LewisX tetrasaccharide antigens 502, using multiple chemoenzymatic processes (Fig. 54\n).352\n",

MBP acting as receptors can mediate uptake and internalization of both soluble and particulate glycoconjugates, and as such they take part in innate immunity.353, 354 The broad pattern-recognition displayed by mannose receptors, together with their implication in adaptive immunity, has stimulated considerable efforts toward the selective delivery of enzymes,355, 356 drugs,357, 358, 359 oligonucleotides or genes,360, 361, 362, 363 and antigens364, 365, 366 to cells expressing them, for therapeutic and vaccine strategies. Another important mannose receptor is a membrane-associated protein restricted on sinusoidal liver cells, peripheral and bone marrow macrophages, and dendritic cells. It also recognizes and internalizes mannosylated glycoconjugates from pathological microorganisms, tumor and yeast cells, such glycoproteins as type-I procollagen, tissue-type plasminogen activator, or various lysosomal enzymes. As such, this mannose receptor contributes to the nonimmune host-defense system. In addition, the macrophage receptor is implicated in major histocompatability complex-mediated antigen (MHC) presentation by dendritic cells (DC-SIGN) (Dendritic Cell-Specific ICAM-3 grabbing nonintegrin) (ICAM-3 = intercellular adhesion molecule). DC-SIGN also belongs to the family of C-type lectins able to bind high-mannose glycoproteins of HIV-gp120, Ebola-gp 1, or Dengue-gp E. DC-SIGN is also known to oligomerize, and it is therefore particularly important to understand the intrinsic binding and multivalent binding requirements of this lectin.",

Fluorescein-labeled pseudoglycodendrimers with valencies of two to eight were tested by competitive-inhibition assays with mannan, which was evaluated by confocal microscopy using mannose receptors expressed in transfected COS-1-cells.

The synthetic clusters were shown to be effective ligands against the dendritic cells, with an optimum affinity toward clusters having a valency of four (504).

The heterobifunctional, high-affinity multivalent ligand was assembled on nontoxic, nonimmunogenic poly-l-lysine dendrimers to which the required number of mannosyl residues can be attached simultaneously via a 4-hydroxybutanoic acid linker, a substance occurring naturally in mammals. The synthesis of the model poly-l-lysine dendrons was initially performed on a commercial Tentagel resin preloaded with Fmoc-Sieber amide linker. The low loading level of the commercial resin (0.16 mmol/g) ensured that sufficient space was allowed for the large fourth and fifth-generation dendrons to be assembled without problems of steric hindrance. At the same time, the mild cleavage conditions required for this type of resin did not cause significant acid-promoted glycoside hydrolysis. The 4-(mannopyranosyloxy)butanoic acid was then introduced by classical peptide-coupling reagents.",

Thus, the Rink amide Tentagel resin was loaded with Fmoc-Lys(Mtt)-OH and the N-terminal Fmoc group was removed by classical treatment with 20% piperidine in DMF. After the reiterative insertion of bis-Fmoc lysine was terminated, the Mtt group was removed at low TFA concentrations with minimal losses of the dendron, and the newly freed amine was directly labeled onto the resin. Accordingly, treatment of the polymer-supported G(4) dendron with 3% TFA in CH2Cl2 led to complete removal of the Mtt group within a short time. Lower concentrations of TFA were inefficient. The free amine group of the glycodendrons was then treated with the appropriate fluorescent probes to provide desired mannosylated glycodendrons such as 505 (Fig. 56).",

Preliminary data from the resulting vaccine candidate 511, containing the LLSGIV motif, demonstrated that it could elicit a polyclonal antibody response in rabbit much stronger than the KLH constructs. It was concluded that the mannosylated dendron was stabilizing the peptide from proteolysis. N-Terminally mannosylated peptides carrying one to six mannose residues were also shown by Koning and coworkers to elicit an immune response, with efficiency up to 104-fold greater than peptide antigens alone.378\n",

If APCs are represented by B cells, multivalency becomes an issue, because both the recognition and the binding events are triggered by cell-surface immunoglobulins. A classical example of successful applications in this regard is presented by the high immunogenicity of bacterial capsular polysaccharides (CPS) which, on their own, can elicit protective antibodies.379, 380 However, the resulting antibodies are usually limited to low-affinity IgMs, and the immune responses lack memory effects because of the absence of T cell-dependent antigens normally associated to peptides. CPS are thus said to be T independent antigens. Alternatively, if the B cell antigens are not multivalent, such as those found in small peptides or oligosaccharides, they will greatly benefit from being mounted on dendritic scaffolds. Moreover, the key T cell epitopes, needed in the context of MHC complexes, can be typically short 15-mer peptides and yet, be too small for efficient uptake by APCs. Consequently, the design of dendritic glycoconjugates bearing multiples copies of both oligosaccharides (B cell epitopes) and short peptides (T cell epitopes) has been proposed as entirely synthetic vaccine candidates (514) (Fig. 60\n).",

Conventional SPS of the peptidic structure was performed by Fmoc-methodology on Wang resin. The dendritic immunogen 516, containing clusters of three consecutive TN-epitopes linked to the poliovirus T cell epitope KLFAVWKITYKDT, was tested in mice as both a prophylactic and as a therapeutic cancer vaccine. As the analogous MAG 515, harboring only four monomeric TN-antigens that have been shown to increase the survival of tumor-bearing mice, added results indicated that 516 showed high immunogenicity and good protection against the development of TN-expressing tumor cells.382\n",

As mentioned earlier in the glycoclusters section, the chemistry and geometry of phosphodiesters and triesters are obviously appealing factors for their use as glycodendrimer scaffolds. The following strategy was based on the synthesis of key phosphoramidite building blocks bearing either N-chloroacetyl or alcohol end groups for further branching.385 DEG spacers were initially transformed into the mono tert-butyldiphenylsilyl derivative 518 which upon treatment with N,N-diisopropylphosphoramidous dichloride (Cl2P-N-(iPr)2, DIPEA, CH2Cl2), provided the essential building block N,N-diisopropyldiphosphoramidite (519) in 84% yield (Fig. 64\n). Alternatively, the mono n-chloroacetylated DEG derivative 520, prepared from commercially available 2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethanol (ClCH2CO2H, EEDQ, 45 \u00b0C, 4 h, 82%) was similarly treated to provide phosphoramidite 521 (68%). Further couplings of 519 or 521 with alcohols 518 or 520 in the presence of 1H-tetrazole gave the corresponding phosphotriesters 522 or 523 after oxidation with t-butyl peroxide (70\u201371%). Coupling tris(N-chloroacetyl) derivative 524 (MeOH, Et3N) with the thiolated N-acetylgalactosaminide 525 afforded a first-generation phosphoglycodendrimer (63%) having three \u03b1-D-GalNAc moieties (not shown). Thiol 525 was prepared from allyl N-acetyl-\u03b1-D-galactosaminide by reaction with thioacetic acid (HSAc, MeOH, AIBN, reflux, 10 h, 77%) followed by Zempl\u00e9n S-deacetylation.",

Nucleophilic displacement of the hexavalent N-chloroacetylated precursor by 525 as before, provided hexavalent dendrimer 526 (52%). Further processing of the synthetic sequence, coupled with tethering strategies with various spacers, gave access to a family of dendrimers having many different valencies.

The results indicated a 3\u201310-fold (hexamer) enhanced affinity over the monovalent ligand, thus supporting once again the glycoside cluster effect.

The resulting glycodendrimers were evaluated as ligands for the phytohemagglutinins from Con A and Pisum sativum (pea lectin), using ELLA and turbidimetric analyses. The relative binding data indicated that incorporation of terminal \u03b1-substituted mannoside residues furnished glycodendrimers showing an up to 400-fold increase in binding capacities. Moreover, their ability to bind and form insoluble carbohydrate\u2013lectin complexes was also demonstrated by radial double immunodiffusion and turbidimetric assays, and their capacity to precipitate selectively their homologous protein receptors from crude lectin mixtures made them convenient tools for the rapid and simple isolation of proteins.390 The same procedure was successfully adapted by the same group a few years later, allowing the introduction of p-isothiocyanatophenyl \u03b2-D-lactoside onto PAMAM scaffolds to study their relative binding behavior toward the family of galectins, the influence of the generation, and the binding-site orientation of receptors.391\n",

Furthermore, their relative efficiency to inhibit the binding of HRPO-labeled LFA to human AGP (orosomucoid) was determined by a competitive ELLA. Interestingly, an increase in multivalency resulted in a steady increase of inhibitory potential, with IC50 values in the nanomolar range (2.89 and 1.13 for G(2) and G(3), respectively) corresponding to an ~ 210-fold jump in inhibitory potential over the monomeric analogue. Subsequently, Baker and coworkers evaluated similar sialic acid-conjugated G(4) PAMAM structures as a mean of preventing adhesion of three influenza A virus subtypes, and furnished one of the first documentations of the function of dendrimer conjugates as antiinfective agents in vivo.396 HAI in vitro showed the glycodendrimers to inhibit some specific influenza subtype strains at concentrations 32\u2013170 times lower than those of sialic acid monomers. The in vivo studies also demonstrated the ability of the glycodendrimers to protect against experimental infection by influenza A X-31 H3N2 virus in mice.",

This was suggestive of a glycoside cluster-effect (enhanced local concentration). As with G(1) and G(2) glycodendrimers, G(3) was too small for multivalent binding to occur (chelate effect). Dendrimers G(4) to G(6) showed a two orders of magnitude increase in activity against the tetrameric Con A, indicating that multivalent binding was occurring. It is also possible that the change in shape from circular [G(1)- to G(3)-PAMAM] to spherical [G(4) to G(6)] caused the observed binding enhancement.398 Further studies led the same group to the efficient incorporation of more complex saccharide units such as \u03b1Man-(1\u21922)Man disaccharide 535, manifesting the fact that dimannose functionalized G(3) and G(4)-PAMAM dendrimers 536, having an average of 26 and 48 peripheral groups were very competent for the recruitment of cyanovirin-N (CV-N), an HIV-inactivating protein that blocks virus-to-cell fusion through high mannose-mediated interactions (Scheme 52\n).399\n",

Thiourea ligation between glycosyl isothiocyanate derivatives and the aminated dendritic core, following standard protocols afforded glycodendrimers containing appropriate amounts of lactose, which were further capped with poly(ethylene)glycol chains or other carbohydrates. The results corroborated the concept that lactosyl dendrimers were engaged in a CCI with GM3 in a Langmuir monolayer. This CCI was dependent on both the carbohydrate density and the density of glycolipid within the monolayer. Moreover, a specific CCI was observed only in the presence of calcium ions and when at least one-fifth of the monolayer was composed of GM3.",

In 1996, Zanini and Roy described the design and synthesis of a novel family of symmetrical dendrimers presenting even valencies between 2 and 16 residues, based on a 3,3\u2032-iminobis(propylamine).411 The synthetic approach was based on convergent assembly of suitable multibranched dendrimers containing N-chloroacetylated end groups to provide electrophilic species that could readily react with thiolated carbohydrate derivatives. Many synthetic benefits emanated from this strategy. First, the method was general, high-yielding, and readily amenable to such existing commercially available amine-terminated dendrimers as PAMAM that could be similarly treated with chloroacetic anhydride. Second, the synthesis of this dendritic family presented a viable alternative to PAMAM dendrimers, avoiding the need for large excesses of the reagents commonly used to ensure complete conversion. More importantly, these structures are not susceptible to base-catalyzed retro-Michael degradations, in contrast to classical PAMAMs, since the substituents are not \u03b2-carbonyl positioned. The authors thus accomplished the efficient preparation of dendritic \u03b1-thiosialosides 551\u2013553, starting from the AB2-type core 3,3\u2032-iminobis(propylamine) (548), which was subsequently transformed to afford various symmetrical N-chloroacetylated dendrons, such as tetramer 549 (Scheme 57\n). A slight excess of thiosialoside 550 allowed the synthesis of glycodendrimers under mild conditions. They were deprotected to afford the dendritic architectures containing between four (551, Scheme 56) and up to 16 sialoside residues (552,\nFig. 67), respectively.",

In fact, less-functionalized ligands may often present optimal potencies. A plausible explanation for this phenomenon has been suggested and highlights the fact that at high loading, the peripheral saccharide portions might become less accessible to proteins because of an increase in steric hindrance. Another hypothesis is based on the drawbacks of using large dendrimers bearing aromatic aglycones, which can intramolecularly undergo \u03c0-stacking, thus further tightening the saccharide units at the dendrimer surface.

MS data allowed determination of the average number of mannose surface residues for each dendrimer generation. Hemagglutination assays were performed by adding rabbit erythrocytes to preincubated solutions of Con A and varying the concentrations of deprotected dendrimers. Comparison of the fourth through sixth PAMAM generations with different loading of surface mannose residues suggested that the binding efficiency was the highest for all generations at 30% to 50% loading. The most interesting observation was that the highest activity did not correlate with the maximum sugar loading, but rather occurred at slightly closer packing of the sugars as the generation increased, suggesting that unfavorable steric interactions precluded optimal binding at high carbohydrate density.",

These nanocontainers ensured efficient entrapment of the bioactive drugs (~ 45%), which allowed their prolonged release profile for up to 144 h (vs. 24 h with PPI). The toxicity of these systems was generally found negligble. In cellular-uptake experiments, MPPI interacted with the lectin receptors present on the surface of MT2 cells or monocytes/macrophages, leading to cellular uptake of drugs 12 times higher than that of the free drugs. Furthermore, this phenomenon may be responsible for the significant, but preliminary anti-HIV activity displayed by MPPI. Despite these promising results, further studies are needed to consider those encapsulated systems as potent carriers for efficient control and targeting the delivery of anti-HIV drugs.",

A general and facile strategy for functional-group introduction at defined positions on dendrimers is best achieved when dendrimers are synthesized stepwise. From this perspective, Sharpless, Hawker, and their group have provided an example of sophisticated, multifunctional materials that can be constructed in a stepwise, yet facile manner, using the efficient \u201cclick\u201d methodology, and with a fashion-controlled strategy toward unsymmetrical glycodendrimers in which two distinct moieties (targeting and detection probe) were placed at the chain ends.254 Dendritic block copolymers up to the fourth generation were coupled via the key step of Cu(I)-catalyzed azide\u2013alkyne cycloaddition to prepare rapidly these dual-purpose and multifunctional materials without use of protecting groups. The orthogonal synthetic approach was based on 2,2-bis(hydroxymethyl)propanoic acid (bis-MPA), which constitute the main building block in synthesis of the commercial Boltorn\u00ae dendrimers. The corresponding bis-MPA anhydride (573) provided access to alkyne ester 583 and azide ester 584 by condensation with the appropriate alcohol (Scheme 63\n). Removal of the protecting groups and subsequent condensation by \u201cclick chemistry\u201d allowed the generation growth of the core and afforded the asymmetrical structure 585 having a diol as the focal point. Two molecules of the functionalized coumarin-type fluorescent dye 586 were then introduced by esterification of the two free hydroxyl groups of 585 with pent-4-ynoic anhydride 283, followed by the [3+2] cycloaddition. Acetal hydrolysis and subsequent introduction of the 16 alkynes via esterification, followed by [3+2] cycloaddition with an unprotected 2-azidoethyl \u03b1-D-mannopyranoside (285a) in THF\u2013H2O furnished the asymmetrical heterobifunctional dendrimer 587.",

This indicated that \u201cSUPER TWIGs\u201d604 and 606 bound directly with high affinity to the STL-I B-subunit. In addition, six trisaccharides situated at an appropriate distance (span of ~ 30 \u00c5 from the central silicon core) in one molecule allowed full embrace of the predicted Gb3-binding sites (CBPs 1 and 2 notably) and were sufficient for high-affinity binding. Furthermore, in vivo inhibitory effects of the \u201cSUPER TWIGs\u201d on the lethality of intravenously administred SLT-II in mice, indicated that 604 was a better candidate than 606 for this specific application. SLT-II was used in this study because it is more toxic than SLT-I both in vitro and in vivo, and clinically more significant. The assays indicated that 606 completely supressed the lethal effect of STL-II when administrated along with the toxin: 604-treated mice survived more than 2 months without any pathological symptoms, whereas 100% of nontreated mice died within 5 days. The biological results suggested that 604 suppressed the lethality of SLT-II by diminishing the deposition of SLT-II in the brain and consequent fatal damage. Also, 604 protected mice from a challenge with a fatal dose of E. coli O157:H7, even when administrated after establishment of the infection. In the light of these results, a unique dual mechanism of action was proposed to explain this spectacular efficiency: (i) 604 bound to SLTs with high affinity and inhibited its Gb3-dependent incorporation into target cells; (ii) it induced active uptake and subsequent degradation of SLTs by macrophages present in the reticuloendothelium.",

Examination of additional structural features allowed the identification of crucial structural parameters. A dumbbell-shaped structure in which two clusters of trisaccharides, symmetrically located through their hydrophobic core and having an optimal length of at least 11 \u00c5 was first required. This indicated that grouping of the trisaccharides was more important than the number of trisaccharides. In the dumbbell shape, at least six trisaccharides needed to be involved for in vivo activity, and terminal trisaccharides with spacers had to be branched from the same terminal silicon atom to be clustered in high density. These structural requirements were essential for the appropriate induction of macrophage-dependent incorporation and degradation of SLT-II, further supporting the pivotal role for this mechanism in the in vivo SLTs-neutralizing activity of \u201cSUPER TWIGs\u201d having optimal structure. Interestingly, the data demonstrated the crucial implication of the CBP 3 present on the SLT-II B-subunit, and showed that it was an essential and sufficient site for high-affinity binding of 605. In addition, the core length was a major structural parameter for perfectly embracing the three sites in a multiple way and, consequently, to provide an adequate hydrophobic volume for recognition by macrophages.",

The synthetic strategies leading to these nanostructures have also witnessed considerable progress, that including organometallic chemistry, chemoenzymatic build-up, silicon chemistry, and self-assembly. Most of the initial challenges in complete substitution by the carbohydrate, and structure determination, have been resolved. Undoubtedly, a fundamental contribution toward this goal has been the utilization of classical [1,3]-dipolar cycloaddition, using the soft and efficient copper-catalyzed, coupling reaction of azide to alkyne. This method, extensively used in this field, has proven extremely versatile. An additional enhancement has been \u201caccelerated convergent strategies,\u201d offering clear synthetic advantages and ease of purification. An important addition to the arsenal of sophisticated glycodendrimer methodologies is the recognition that most complex carbohydrate epitopes can be advantageously replaced by simpler saccharides, and most importantly by glycomimetics. In this way, by combining the multivalent scaffolding of carbohydrate ligands, together with their replacement by simpler but higher affinity mimetics, the research community has delivered very potent antiadhesin candidates against viral and bacterial infections, including HIV and Ebola viruses. Key to these discoveries and applications, glycodendrimers have permitted a better understanding and appreciation of the very complex nature of multivalent carbohydrate\u2013protein interactions. The upcoming challenges must address the issues of fine-tuned specificity faced by numerous families of carbohydrate-binding proteins having common and conserved CRDs, such as those identified for instance in galectins and MBPs. Another challenge will be to determine the toxicities of glycodendrimers to allow development of safe therapeutic agents.",
