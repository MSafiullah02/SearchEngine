We start with a zero-dimensional (ODE-level) compartmental epidemiological model consisting of Susceptible, Exposed, (symptomatically) Infected, Hospitalized, Asymptomatic, Recovered, and Deceased populations (SEIHARD). We emphasize the importance of the viral latency period (reflected in the exposed population) and the key role of an asymptomatic population. We optimize model parameters for both regions by comparing predictions to the cumulative number of infected and total number of deaths, the reported data we found to be most reliable. We model both the pre-quarantine and post-quarantine evolution of the epidemic by a time-dependent change of the viral transmission rates that arises in response to the containment measures. Subsequently, a spatially distributed version of the 0D model in the form of convection-reaction-diffusion equations is developed. We consider that, after an initial localized seeding of the infection, its spread is governed by the diffusivities of the asymptomatic and symptomatically infected populations. We show that these models bear significant potential towards capturing both the well-mixed, zerodimentional description and the spatial expansion of the pandemic in the two regions. Veins of future work are also explored. arXiv:2005.04527v2 [q-bio.PE] 24 May 2020 2",

            "text": "At the level of an ODE formulation, a relevant extension of the standard SIR model can incorporate some of the key features of this virus, such as, e.g., that a fraction of the exposed population remains asymptomatic [23] . We thus start with a population of susceptibles (S), which may become exposed (E) upon the emergence of the virus within the population. This represents the well-documented [24] feature that the virus is latent within the host for a period of time, before he/she becomes infectious (able to transmit the virus to susceptible hosts). After this latency period, exposed individuals, in turn, may become asymptomatically infectious (A) at rate \u03c3 A , or (symptomatically) infected (I) at rate \u03c3 I . We assume here that both A and I can interact with the susceptibles S with respective rates \u03b2 SA and \u03b2 SI to draw new members of the population into the group E of individuals exposed to the virus. We note that the transmission rates \u03b2 incorporate the total population size (ODE model) or the total population density (PDE Model). A fraction of hosts in the I class may need hospitalization, thus giving rise to a population of hospitalized (H) at rate \u03b3M . Among these, a fraction responds to the treatments, thus leading ultimately to a population of recovered (R) at a rate (1 \u2212 \u03c9)\u03c7. At the same time, the seriously ill who are hospitalized yield also a number of deceased (D) at a rate \u03c9\u03c8. Asymptomatically infected hosts recover at a rate M AR (i.e., asymptomatic recovered) and move into class AR and the seriously ill recover at a rate (1 \u2212 \u03b3)M ; in what follows, we have set these two rates to be equal. While AR could, in principle, be merged with R, in our view, it is meaningful to maintain these two populations separate since R is a measurable quantity within available COVID-19 data (and, hence, comparable to model predictions), while AR is not. Notice that the above constants reflect both the population fraction partition (e.g., \u03c9 vs 1 \u2212 \u03c9) and the (inverse) time scales (e.g., \u03c7 vs. \u03c8) for transition between subgroups.",

Here, we briefly note two points. The pool of susceptible individuals is not significantly affected (over the time scale of our study) from this term which can be safely neglected for our purposes. Secondly, one can include such a term in the rest of the populations involved in our study. However, the (underlying) health conditions often involved in such mortality often lead to complications in the concurrent presence of COVID-19 and when this leads to mortality, the latter is attributed to COVID-19. Hence, we do not include such a separate term in the rest of the equations.",

Initially, we note that we do not anticipate that infected (which should be self-quarantined), hospitalized (or at stages thereafter) will have a diffusivity, i.e., D I = D H = 0 in the initial installment of the model. As regards the R and AR, in principle they can have a diffusivity (although there is a period of recovery), yet since it is fair to assume that these populations have immunity in the immediate interval after their infection, we can assign D R = D AR = 0. However, an interesting possibility within the model is the inclusion of population, as well as time dependent diffusion, and possibly also directed (along the direction of the velocity v) As regards the remaining populations, it may be tempting to examine nonlinear variants where the diffusivity is larger e.g. where the population is larger, reflecting the existence of a well-established transportation/mobility network. Nevertheless, in the present work, we will initiate relevant considerations by assuming constant diffusivity of the susceptibles, the exposed, and the asymptomatics. The latter are the key, given their mobility and spatial spreading for the corresponding spreading of the pandemic in the context of Eqs. (1)- (8) .",

In principle, this can be used to capture \"daily practices\" (e.g., going to work, spending time there, commuting back and resting practices), but also longer temporal or spatial scales (e.g., trips from city to city, or country to country). Motivated partially by the colloquial understanding of some of the case examples considered such as the spreading of the pandemic in Greece [25] , at the present level, we opt not to incorporate these effects but simply allow diffusion to perform the relevant spreading. The idea within a given region (such as the mainland of Greece or Andalusia) then is that arriving infected individuals, e.g., from international travel, form local hotspots within the E population and we examine the diffusional spreading effect of the virus in the presence of the above local viral dynamics. We will see that this approach is not an unreasonable one given the results that we obtain for the spreading of the PDE results with both the ODE ones and the data available online for the cumulative infections and the deaths within the regions of interest. Naturally, it is hoped that this will be a seed study towards a further refinement of such considerations on the basis of more accurate spatial data for the spreading of the disease.",

While these examples may seem somewhat disparate, they bear some significant advantages as regards their nature and their comparison. First off, they are regions of similar populations of about 8-10 million inhabitants. Greece has been praised in international media [26] regarding its handling of the COVID-19 crisis and the effectiveness and promptness of the associated social-distancing measures. Additional relevant features of this region include (a) day 0 of the infection and (b) the origin of the localized events thereof could be successfully identified, as well as (c) strict lockdown effects went into place early on. Another example at the opposite end with very significant numbers of infections and deaths is Spain. However, here there is a significant set of complications. Not only is Spain far larger in spatial and population size, but importantly for the number of reported cases and especially the number of deaths, there is no universally accepted way of reaching the relevant conclusive numbers across the 17 different autonomous communities. For all of the above reasons, and also for reasons of clearer comparison of comparable sizes (and also for ones of intrinsic interest to the authors, admittedly), we selected the autonomous community of Andalusia.",

The parameters were optimized to reproduce the time series of the reported total number of infected cases (C(t) = I(t) + H(t) + R(t) + D(t)) and total number of deceased (D(t)). As expected for this large parameter space, initial parameter choices and parameter constraints affect the parameters resulting from the optimization algorithms.

The transmission rates \u03b2 are more complicated. Keeping in mind that at the PDE level the quantities, S, E, etc. are no longer populations, but rather population densities [32] which integrate over the region's spatial surface (through the respective surface integrals) to the true population of each category, we can immediately infer that the units of such densities are proportional to l \u22122 where l is a characteristic length-scale of the analysis. In that vein, the \u03b2's need to be multiplied by l 2 to dimensionally adapt between the ODE and the corresponding PDE model. Indeed, we have found these to be the most complicated parameters to select at the level of the PDE model, as we will explain in the discussion of the results below.

The relevant results for the two regions are given in Figs. 2 and 3, respectively. In Greece, the data we consider [25] start on March 12, when losses of life started to occur and the cumulative number of infected (total number of cases) was already a bit over 100 individuals. For some technical reasons (namely the lack of data around April 19 and a significant jump in the data nearly immediately thereafter), we only compare to the data up to that date. Speaking of the relevant data, it is worthwhile to mention some nontrivial lapses in the apparent curation of the data. Particularly noteworthy is the case of the recovered individuals in [25] . The data must evidently be significantly inaccurate, as the number of recovered individuals appears to stay fixed at 53 between March 29 and April 5, only then to jump entirely abruptly to 269 recovered, only to stay there between April 6 and April 29, then to jump on to 1374. Admittedly, the unprecedented circumstances are straining the data collection process, yet it is particularly important to provide accurate data to modelers to calibrate adequately the models towards the future spreading of the pandemic. In that connection, we found the most adequate data sources to be, for Greece, the number of cumulative infected (C(t) = I(t) + H(t) + R(t) + D(t)), i.e., the total number of \"cases\", and the number of deaths due to COVID-19 (D(t)).

For instance, assuming that the latency time scale of the virus is similar for asymptomatics and infected (as is reasonable to assume), then the rate of turning to asymptomatic versus turning to infected is about 1.704. The value of M AR suggests a time scale of nearly 7 days (7.161) for the recovery of asymptomatics. On the other hand, M suggests a time scale of about 3.5 days for those with symptoms to potentially need hospitalization. The value of \u03b3 roughly suggests a half-half split between those recovering directly versus those needing some form of hospitalization. The value of \u03c9 for the data of Greece suggests that among those needing hospitalization nearly 80% recover, while only 20% die. In this case, nearly 6 days are needed for the recovery, while the time scale for \u03c8 is associated with a time interval of 10 days for the death. One of the most significant unknowns is the initial population of exposed E 0 and asymptomatics A 0 , as there is no way to evaluate them. We opted to introduce their fraction to the initial population of infected I 0 as two additional parameters, E = E 0 /I 0 and A = A 0 /I 0 in the optimization. Our optimization yields initially around twice as many exposed than infected, and about 1.25 as being the ratio of asymptomatic to infected. The above guideline suggests how to interpret the data in the format of Table I .",

The parameter \u03b2 effectively captures the rate of contact of susceptible individuals with infected or asymptomatic that leads to exposure to the virus. In fact, the transmission rates \u03b2 may be expressed as the product of the average daily contacts (contact rate) a susceptible has with any individual times the probability of infection given a contact: the probability of infection is proportional to the viral load (viral concentration in the respiratory-tract fluid) of expelled respiratory droplets [5] . Recent work suggests comparable viral loads in asymptomatic and symptomatic patients [23] . Furthermore, the contact rate should be significantly smaller for the (expected to be) self-isolating infected individuals, than for the asymptomatics who continue their life, not knowing that they are carrying SARS-CoV-2 (and most importantly that they are infectious). Similar viral load coupled to higher contact rates of asymptomatics than infected with susceptibles suggest that the transmission rates \u03b2 SA would be higher than \u03b2 SI . Such an expected trend in the transmission rates is reflected in our optimized parameters shown in Table I . The transmission rate inequality reflects the importance of asymptomatics in the transmission of SARS-CoV-2, a particularly important feature that differentiates it from the transmission of other respiratory virus like influenza and SARS-CoV-1. After lock down measures are imposed, the two contact rates become more \"comparable\", as the number of contacts of both A's and I's decreases significantly. The left panel of Fig. 2 illustrates that with these parameters we capture the data of Greece fairly well, imposing the quarantine practically at the time when it was officially announced. This is especially true as concerns the number of deceased individuals in the middle (left) row. Nevertheless, there is a characteristic feature in the top (left) row which we fail to adequately capture: in particular, there is an \"angle\" in the semi-logarithmic plot associated with the curbing of the cumulative number of infections C(t) due to containment measures. This angle is present both in the optimized model results and in the original data. Yet, it occurs at slightly different instances (by about 10 days between the optimized model results and the country data). As this takes place, the optimization code attempts to minimize the distance from the observed data, slightly over-predicting around the time of the (model) angle, and arguably slightly under-predicting at later times. Nevertheless the overall differences are relatively small. Moreover, the model prediction flattening out (over 5 months) around 200 deceased and slightly over 3K infected individuals Top panels show the official data (red dots) and simulations (blue line) for the confirmed cases C(t) = I(t) + R(t) + H(t) + D(t); middle panels show the official data and simulations for the deaths D(t); bottom panels display the remaining populations, namely exposed (E(t)), asymptomatic (A(t)), hospitalized (H(t)), recovered (R(t)) and asymptomatic recovered (AR(t)). seem reasonable, were the lock down measures potentially extendable to such a long time interval. Obviously this is highly improbable for economic reasons, not to mention that as of this writing such measures are in the process of being gradually lifted. Nevertheless, if we were to shift arbitrarily the time of the application of the quarantine data by about 10 days later, then we note in the right panel of the figure a nontrivial difference. Most notably, without significantly missing on D(t) (although the fit is slightly less accurate there), we capture accurately the angle in the C(t) data. The relevant parameters are presented in the second column of Table I . There are no particularly noteworthy differences here, although some do exist (e.g., the fraction of exposed that turn to infected now is closer to 46%, with 54% asymptomatics). A potential interpretation of this admittedly somewhat arbitrary shift of the quarantine parameter imposition may be that at the model level such measures have an immediate, essentially instantaneous effect, while in the realistic country data, there is a time lag before this switch in the number of contacts (due to lock down) has a perceptible effect.",

The effect of the shift of t q is far more severe in the case of Andalusia (Fig. 3) . Here, it is apparent that the attempt to capture the data, due to the relevant mismatch in the associated angle leads to some far more significant deviations. While the model prediction seems to minimize the distance to the data by over-predicting C(t), under-predicting it later, it clearly starts over-predicting the trend of the quantity towards the end of the available data time-series, in turn resulting in cumulative infections of the order of several (more than 5) tens of thousands. A similar over-prediction seems to be developing in D(t) leading to nearly 10 thousand deaths, while the data seem to clearly tend to values below that. A suitable (ad hoc, but possibly rationalized as above) shift of the quarantine time clearly does a far better job in capturing the actual trends of both C(t) and D(t) with the C(t) lying between 10 4 and 2 \u00d7 10 4 and, correspondingly, D(t) staying below 2 \u00d7 10 3 . Table I clearly illustrates at a parametric level the source of the discrepancy, as the attempt to fit the data without the correct angle location leads some of the parameters (such as \u03c7 or A ) to unrealistic values and this, e.g., the large fraction of asymptomatics, leads eventually to a considerably enhanced result of the pandemic.",

These numbers are close to the epidemiologically determined range of 2\u22124 [24], a range that encompasses the variation of the basic reproduction number in space and time. Although our focus is not on the calculation of R 0 , which is of principal interest to a wide range of studies regarding SARS-CoV-2, it is worth noting that an effective reproduction number may be calculated with the more quantitatively accurate (as regards the data) parameters of the 2nd and 4th columns in Table I . Accordingly, we find that for Greece the pre-quarantine effective reproduction number R eff = 1.44 moves to a post-quarantine R eff = 0.46 and, respectively, for Andalusia from 2.2 to 0.69, reflecting in both cases the decline of the epidemic spreading under the lockdown measures.",

We assume that most of the populations relevant to the infection which have not developed any symptoms, namely the asymptomatics and the exposed, diffuse with a diffusivity of D c = 100 km 2 /day (i.e., associated with a characteristic spatial scale of about 10 km). Our motivation for this choice is that in this small population (for the regions and data considered) associated with the infection, it is relevant to include a wider spatial spread of their motion to enable (through their contacts) the infection to spatially spread. On the other hand, for the far larger population of susceptibles, we assign a far smaller diffusivity (0.1D c ) since a large diffusivity would tend to distribute more evenly the susceptible population, a feature that does not appear to be very realistic (especially so over the course of a pandemic). The rest of the populations (most notably, I, H, and D, since the immunity of R and AR renders their diffusion inconsequential) are assumed to be highly localized/self-isolating and hence bear, for our purposes, a vanishing diffusivity.

Further modification of the quarantine time can also help capture once again the \"angle\" in the relevant data (right column). Clearly the spatial model does a very adequate job at capturing both the cumulative infections and the number of deaths (with the caveats to be given in the discussion below). Notice that in the bottom row of the figure, we illustrate the surface integrals of each of the density of E, A, H, R and AR as a function of time, representing the evolution of the pandemic at the \"integrated\" level of the entire country in an illustration similar to the one that we typically obtain from the ODE models.

In Figs. 5-7 for Greece (Figs. 9-11 for Andalusia), we can see the spatio-temporal evolution of the infections (i.e., the spatial distribution at a few snapshots over time), the deaths and the cumulative infections C(x, y, t), respectively. We also produced movies of the corresponding evolution that can be found in [35] and [36] . It is important to re-iterate here that we have not included the islands of Greece in this effort (i.e., we are looking at the mainland of Greece). Obviously if one were to model the disease spread in each of these islands it would be relevant to seed the infection in each island individually and study the spreading there rather than together with the spatially disconnected from the islands mainland of Greece. In the case of Greece, we can clearly see how the infection spreads throughout the country, affecting most significantly the regions of higher population density. Indeed, it is FIG. 7. Evolution of the mainland Greek confirmed case density C(x, y, t) at t = 1, t = 6, t = 11, and t = 21 days. evident that over time the infection is extinguished in most regions and it finally persists chiefly in Attica, the region of highest population density (and where the main metropolitan center of the country, Athens, lies); see, in particular, the bottom panels of Fig. 5 . Nevertheless, it is evident from Fig. 6 that a number of deaths develops in each of the 5 regions where the infection was initially seeded, in line with the corresponding expectation in the country's data. Indeed, also, each region features a discernible fraction of cumulative infections in Fig. 7 , although clearly once again the lion's share of infections pertains to Attica. The second biggest fraction of infections pertains to Thessaloniki (the second biggest metropolitan center) and so on. It is clear from these figures that the model yields a spatial evolution of the disease spread in line with the cumulative totals of deaths and infections throughout the country. Nevertheless, a comparison with the spatial distribution of the pandemic throughout the country [25] suggests also some limitations that we will discuss in the next section. For the case of Andalusia, we can observe how the biggest fractions of the infections remain in the most populated cities of Sevilla and M\u00e1laga, and that the provinces of Huelva and Almer\u00eda are those with the smallest number of infections, in accordance with the current status of the pandemic [34]; however, the number of deaths seems to be very much higher in the province of M\u00e1laga where the pandemic data show that this number is almost the same as in Sevilla and Granada. One can also observe that since the initial spots for Andalusia were spatially close, the infection spreads more easily in this region than in the mainland of Greece.",

The regions of interest were Greece and Andalusia for which there has been a small number of studies. As regards Greece, there are some probabilistic [11, 37] and some network-based approaches for time-series analysis [38] . Studies that focus on Spain also examine Andalusia as a case example using either probabilistic [10] or POD-FIG. 8. Same as Fig. 4 but for Andalusia. Only the case tq = 16 is considered. All transmission rates \u03b2 were multiplied by 0.01299, and the diffusion coefficient decreased to 30% of the original (pre-quarantine) value during quarantine. based decomposition techniques [39] . Our effort has been to explore a model of the SEIR variety that incorporates some of the particular biological features of the SARS-CoV-2 virus [24], such as its latency period, and the potential to generate a significant fraction of asymptomatic hosts, which, in turn, play a crucial role in spreading the infection. The resulting SEIHARD model involves a number of populations: Susceptible, Exposed, symptomatically Infected, Hospizalized, Asymptomatics, Recovered, and Deceased. We found that for the regions of interest the model reproduces the epidemiological data that we determined to be most reliable, namely the data on the cumulative infections and especially the number of deaths. Naturally, more accurate data including also spatially resolved ones would be helpful towards the improved calibration of the results offered herein. We modelled both the early, pre-quarantine, stage of the epidemic, as well as its development at a later stage when containment measures had been enforced. The effect of quarantine on the spreading of the disease was imposed via a time-dependent (on the time scale of a day) change of the transmission rates. While initiating a quarantine roughly when it was imposed yields acceptable results in Greece, in Andalusia this is less so. For Andalusia, the \"angle\" indicating the curbing of the infection due to the measures can be captured more accurately if a time-lag is provided for the application of the (instantaneous in the ODE model) quarantine set of parameters. We note that the change of the model parameters followed the imposition of lockdown measures over a short time scale, whereas the effect of social intervention measures (self-quarantine, social distancing, etc) appears to arise later in the epidemiological data.",

The importance of asymptomatics in the transmission of the SARS-CoV-2 virus, a particularity of this coronavirus, was manifested in the relative importance of the viral transmission rates between susceptibles and asymptomatics (\u03b2 SA ) or infected (\u03b2 SI ). We attributed the increased \u03b2 SA to the considerably larger mobility of asymptomatics, thence higher contact rates, coupled to the asymptomatics viral load being comparable to that of (symptomatically) infected [23] . In [42] it was reported that asymptomatic infectious hosts may account for up to 86% of cases, thus further supporting our prediction of their importance in the spread of the disease. Likewise, in a study of only patients with confirmed disease [43] , there was no difference in viral load due to disease severity and transmission potential was found to be high before the onset of symptoms.",

We also explained the challenge of adapting contact parameters (such as the transmission rates) to the level of the country: this process involves issues of homogeneity at the ODE level vs. substantial heterogeneity at the PDE level.

This type of term would generate infections in a probabilistic way (possibly with a probability weighed upon the region's population density) by allowing individuals to effectively \"perform trips\" through the country, i.e., disappearing from one location and reappearing (within a short time scale of less than a day for the regions of interest) in another.",

It is also proportional to \u03c3 A /(\u03c3 A + \u03c3 I ), namely the fractional rate at which exposed hosts become infectious, yet asymptomatic, A. Finally, it is inversely proportional to the loss rate M AR of the infectious asymptomatic class A. We have a second similar contribution to R 0 because we have two modes of transmission, namely through contact with A and through contact with I. The dominant contribution to the next-generation R 0 in our results given in the main text comes from the first term in Eq. (A1), the term that arises from the interaction of susceptibles with asymptomatics. The second transmission mode, contact of susceptibles with infected, gives a significantly smaller contribution to the basic reproduction number.",
