The implementation of and adherence to such measures will be key components of any successful lockdown exit strategy. Ranging from expanded testing and widespread use of technology to building the public's trust in the post COVID-19 world, there is a role for pharmacists to play. In this commentary, these measures and the potential contribution of pharmacists to their successful implementation are outlined and discussed.",

            "text": "On 11 March 2020, the World Health Organisation (WHO) declared the outbreak of an influenza-like illness caused by the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) a pandemic. 1, 2, 3 This has mobilised governments across the globe and initiated a worldwide state of emergency to prepare healthcare systems for the upcoming tide of cases. 4, 5 With the focus shifting from containment to delay, the aim of these governments has also shifted to \"flattening the pandemic curve\" to enable their healthcare systems to cope with the expected unprecedented pressure that has never been encountered in peacetime. 6, 7 Learning from previous pandemics, various non-pharmaceutical measures were put in place across the globe including travel bans, household quarantine, border closure, adult and child social distancing, and school closures. 8, 9 These drastic measures are usually reserved for pandemics that have high infectivity, as measured by the viral basic reproduction number (R0), and high case fatality rate (CFR); particularly in absence of a vaccine and an effective curative treatment. 10, 11 However, given their negative economic and health consequences, these measures cannot be kept in place for the long time required for the development of a vaccine and/or an effective treatment. 12, 13 As the number of cases increases and the number of susceptible individuals decreases, the number of immune individuals starts to grow; making it possible to consider lifting some or all of these costly measures. Nevertheless, careful planning of exit strategies is required to ensure that a second wave of infections is avoided. 14 These exit strategies should be tailored to each country's situation and place on the trajectory of the pandemic spread. 15 A number of measures have been proposed as key components of successful lockdown exit strategies. 14, 15 Effective implementation of these measures will require buy-in from the public and active involvement from a range of frontline workers including pharmacists, who have been playing a key role throughout this public health crisis and are ideally placed to continue supporting the public through these difficult times. Below, these measures are discussed and the potential contributions of pharmacists to their implementation is outlined.",

[16] [17] [18] Peto et al. proposed universal weekly antigen testing with strict household quarantine after a positive test. 17 The authors, however, proposed evaluating the feasibility of such strategy before widespread adoption. Aggressive antigen testing has been key to the success of containment in a number of countries including Germany and South Korea. 19 However, this has proven to be resource intensive. Thus, the capacity constraints of implementing large scale antigen testing will need to be carefully considered. 20 For example, the availability of PCR machines, reagents and the trained personnel to carry out these tests and interpret their results will require careful planning. 17 Alternative testing methods are currently being developed with point-of-care testing, and home-testing kits offering a lot of promise, in terms of turnaround time and accuracy. 21, 22 These can facilitate prompt contact tracing, isolation and quarantine.",

Some governments have proposed the use of an \"immunity passport\" or \"risk-free certificate\" that would enable individuals to travel or to return to work. 25, 26 However, the WHO has reported that there is currently no evidence that people who have recovered from COVID-19 and have antibodies are protected from a second infection, which calls into question the extent to which antibody testing could be used to inform return to work. 27 The availability of such tests is another limitation, with only one test currently approved. The U.S. the serology test has a specificity greater than 99.8% and sensitivity of 100% (14 Days post-PCR confirmation). 28 If it is confirmed that re-infection is unlikely, then antibody testing will indeed become a key consideration when deciding on individuals' return to work and other aspects of normal life. 26 Similar to antigen testing, capacity building for conducting these tests will be important. 29 There is a key role for pharmacies to play in becoming hubs for conducting these tests. Antibody testing carries less risks, as it should be conducted following recovery from the infection, 26 and it would be more acceptable and feasible for pharmacies to take a leading role in its provision.",

However, there is growing concern that increasing public demand for face masks will create shortages and reduce their availability for frontline workers who are already facing problems in finding these masks. 42 Ensuring the availability of face masks will, thus, be important for the implementation of face covering in public as a component of exit strategies.",
