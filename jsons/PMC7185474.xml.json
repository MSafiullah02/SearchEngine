In these epidemiological studies, the population is divided in three groups, as in the classical SIR model proposed by Kermack and McKendrick in 1927 (e.g. Anderson and May, 1992, Murray, 2003): the group S represents the individuals that are susceptible and thus subjected to the infection; the group I is formed by the individuals that are infected and can transmit the disease for susceptible ones; and the group R is composed by the individuals that are recovered. Equivalences with models based on ordinary differential equations (ODEs) are explored in some works (e.g. Ahmed et al., 1998, Fuentes and Kuperman, 1999, Monteiro et al., 2006a, Monteiro et al., 2007), since ODE are a mean-field approximation for PCA if the three groups (S, I and R) are homogeneously distributed in space.",

In fact, disease-causing contacts form a connection network among individuals and the assumption of a topology in which the couplings are local and regular is just a first approximation. When long-range interactions are also taken into account, random coupling topologies are frequently employed (e.g. Boccaletti et al., 2006, Kleczkowski and Grenfell, 1999, Newmann, 2002) and relations among topological properties and features of the epidemiological dynamics (for instance, the number of infective individuals in the permanent regime) are investigated (e.g. Hartvigsen et al., 2007, Pautasso and Jeger, 2008, Xu et al., 2006). Besides differences in the coupling topology, variations usually found in epidemiological studies based on PCA include: the use of non-isotropic lattices (e.g. Kansal et al., 2000); the consideration of more than one individual living in each lattice cell (e.g. Doran and Laffan, 2005); the absence of the recovered group for modelling diseases where the cure does not confer immunity (e.g. Fuentes and Kuperman, 1999); the inclusion of a latent group composed by infected individuals, but not yet infective ones (e.g. Ward et al., 2007), etc.",

            "text": "In this work, the random contact network is formed by C connections starting from each cell (individual) in the PCA lattice to other cells pertaining to the square matrix of size 2r+1 centered in such a cell; i.e., C connections start from the cell occupying the central position of its neighborhood matrix (two or more connections between the same two cells are allowed) and r is the maximum radius where a connection can be made. Of course, such a cell can receive connections starting from other cells, hence its actual number of neighbors is commonly greater than C. The case r=1 including all eight surrounding cells is called the Moore neighborhood of unitary radius (e.g. Wolfram, 1994). We assume that the probability qi of settling a connection between the central cell and any cell pertaining to the layer i is given by(1)qi=r+1\u2212ir2+r\u2212\u2211j=1rjwhere i=1,2,\u2026,r and the layer i is formed by the cells with Moore radius equal to i. For instance, for r=3, then q1=1/2, q2=1/3, q3=1/6. Thus, the probability of connecting the central cell to any of the 8 cells forming the layer i=1 is 1/2, to any of the 16 cells forming the layer i=2 is 1/3, and to any of the 24 cells forming the layer i=3 is 1/6. In this random network, the cells are mainly locally connected. Such a topology (already used as coupling model of neural networks by Monteiro et al., 2006b) can present \u201chigh\u201d clustering coefficient cc (here \u201chigh\u201d means cc\u226bC/N, where N is the number of cells constituting the lattice) and \u201csmall\u201d average shortest path length l (here \u201csmall\u201d means l\u223cln\u2061(N)/ln\u2061(C)) as the graphs called small-worlds (Watts and Strogatz, 1998). The main difference is that, in a small-world network, any cell has the same probability of receiving a rewired connection; in our network, this probability is given by qi, which depends on the maximum radius r and on the distance i between the cells that may be connected.",

This parameter characterizes the transmission intensity of a particular disease in a particular population and it is interpreted as a threshold criterium: if R0>1, the number of infected individuals increases and there occurs outbreak and/or persistence of the disease; if R0<1, the number of infected individuals declines and the disease eventually disappears. Hence, determining the value of such a parameter is important to predict the temporal evolution of a disease in a population. Here we study the relations among R0, the parameters r and C and the topological properties of the contact network generated by Eq. (1) and discuss how these results can affect the specification of strategies for controlling disease spreadings.",

In this section, the figures present average results obtained in ten contact networks formed by Eq. (1) for n=200 (the results are not qualitatively different for other values of n). Random networks are usually characterized by the degree distribution and two topological parameters (e.g. Barabasi, 2003, Boccaletti et al., 2006, Bollob\u00e0s, 2001): the clustering coefficient and the average shortest path length.",

When this parameter is above a critical value (1, by definition), then the model used for deriving the analytical expression for R0 predicts that the disease will spread in the population. There are reports about severe epidemics occurred in slave ships during the 19th century (e.g. Watts, 1999). This is a historic example illustrating the influence of C on disease spreadings. Slaves had a very limited value of r, but the increase of C caused by gathering them in a ship increased the value of R0 of such a population, which made easier the propagation of diseases. Cases illustrating the influence of r in disease propagations can also be easily found. For instance, sailing ships developed mainly from the 13th century amplified the human mobility on the world; consequently, the value of r and the incidence of epidemics. A classical example is the devastation of the Aztec population by smallpox in the 16th century after the Spanish invasion (e.g. Watts, 1999).",

Shulgin et al. (1998) used a SIR model based in ODE to determine, in terms of R0, the minimum percentage p of susceptible individuals that must be vaccinated to eradicate a contagious disease; they found p=(R0\u22121)/R0. This expression was also derived by Huang (2008) from a SEIR model (where E represents the exposed (latent) group), who applied it for calculating the critical vaccination level associated to 21 well-known infectious diseases.

This result can affect the evaluation of the effectiveness concerning different strategies employed for controlling a disease spreading. For instance, Lipsitch et al. (2003) and Zhang (2007) studied the transmission dynamics of the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) by using mathematical models that do not explicitly consider the geographical localizations of the individuals, and they concluded that R0\u22483 in the absence of control measures. Because distinct values of topological properties can produce the same value of R0 in a model considerating the spatial structure of the contact network, it is difficult to evaluate the effective contribution of each control measure, like isolations of SARS cases, quarantine of their asymptomatic contacts and restrictions on long-range population movement. Of course, all these interventions decrease (r and C, and consequently) R0 and help to reduce the transmission. However, the weight of each intervention in the global result is far from being understood, possibly because the correspondences among R0 and the topological properties of the contact network are not one-to-one. Another example: Chen et al. (2006) quantified the impact of distinct control measures (such as filtration, isolation, vaccination) in containing the propagation of indoor airborne infections (like chickenpox, influenza, measles, SARS); however, they did not take into account the contact network. These authors proposed to explicitly consider this network in their model, in order to get more accurate predictions. Based in our results, we do agree with them.",

Future works should try to answer the following questions: (1)Can this disease be eradicated by isolating a fraction F of I-individuals? Or, is there a critical value Fc<1 so that if the fraction F=Fc of the I-individuals is isolated, then the disease is eradicated? In other words, is this unique procedure enough to reduce the effective value of R0 (that is, the value of R0 for a disease propagating in a population employing control measures) below 1? Observe that isolation means strong reduction in the values of r and C for I-individuals and, consequently, alteration in the topological properties of the contact network.(2)Preventive attitudes (as the use of masks against airborne infections or condoms against sexually transmitted diseases) alter the coupling topology of the S-individuals. Can this disease be eradicated if a fraction F of S-individuals have preventive attitudes? Is there a critical value Fc<1 so that if the fraction F=Fc of the S-individuals takes precaution measures, then the disease is eradicated? In other words, the effective value of R0 can be decreased below 1 only with these attitudes?(3)Our simulations showed that random contact networks with distinct topological parameter values can result in the same value of R0 for the same disease. One can wonder if the two control strategies mentioned in the items (1) and (2) when separately applied against a particular disease would lead to networks with distinct topological features but with similar values of R0.(4)Which of these two strategies can reduce R0 below 1 requiring the lowest value of Fc?(5)Vaccination is frequently modelled either as a conversion of S-individuals to R-individuals or as a decreasing in the birth rate of S-individuals (e.g. Bauch and Earn, 2004, Shulgin et al., 1998). Thus, this control strategy seems not be directly related to changes in the topological properties of the contact network. However, if there exists a vaccine against the disease under analysis, what is the optimum combination among these strategies (isolation, prevention, vaccination) in order to eradicate such a disease? Here \u201coptimum\u201d can be interpreted as lowest cost and/or highest quality of life.\n",
