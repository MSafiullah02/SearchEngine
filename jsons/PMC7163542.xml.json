These methods use age\u2010stratified seroprevalence data (presence or absence of antibody in the host) and assume lifelong immunity such that the cumulative hazard of infection increases with age (Muench 1934, 1959; Farrington 1990; Hens et al. 2010) (Fig. 1a). Age\u2010seroprevalence methods are inappropriate in wildlife\u2010host systems where the host is short\u2010lived (not practical to distinguish ages), where age data are coarse and imprecise (not enough information to fit the age\u2010seroprevalence curve), or where antibodies decay quickly (no signature of increased seroprevalence with age). Also, age\u2010seroprevalence methods assume a constant FOI over time (Fig. 1a) and long temporal datasets with large sample sizes are typically required to make inference about time\u2010varying FOI (Grenfell & Anderson 1985; but see Heisey et al. 2010 for an alternative). A flexible method that relaxes these potentially problematic assumptions (i.e. necessity for age data, reasonably long\u2010lived hosts, slow antibody decay, serial surveillance sampling, or constant FOI over time) remains to be developed and may improve inference of disease dynamics in wildlife systems that often violate one or more assumptions of conventional methods.",

By considering the underlying quantitative antibody information, the dependence on age data and long\u2010term antibody circulation for inference of FOI can be relaxed. In effect, the historical perspective provided by age data can be replaced with antibody response curves because the decay from peak antibody levels becomes a source of information rather than a nuisance. The main concept is that pathogen\u2010specific antibody kinetics exhibit robust, reproducible patterns, as long as individual\u2010level heterogeneities in antibody response are accounted for appropriately (Simonsen et al. 2009; Teunis et al. 2012, 2013), and thus can be used to infer the time since infection (TSI) for individuals and population incidence (Teunis et al. 2002, 2012; de Melker et al. 2006; Simonsen et al. 2009; Kretzschmar et al. 2010; Borremans et al. 2016) or FOI (Fig. 1b). Quantitative approaches to inferring incidence lend themselves naturally to estimating time\u2010varying FOI because historical epidemiological status of sampled individuals can be determined. Quantitative antibody approaches also necessarily consider within\u2010host immunity dynamics to infer population\u2010level FOI, which could lead to novel insights into wildlife disease ecology.",

Also, these approaches estimate average incidence in the population rather than allowing change in incidence over time (de Melker et al. 2006; Simonsen et al. 2009; Kretzschmar et al. 2010; Teunis et al. 2012; Teunis 2015). A recent advance showed that quantitative longitudinal antibody data (repeat samples from the same individual over time) could be used to estimate time\u2010varying incidence accurately under complex endemic dynamics (Borremans et al. 2016). However, because it is rare for wildlife surveillance to collect repeat samples from individuals, an approach that works with cross\u2010sectional serosurveillance data is valuable as well.",

These methods inherently account for individual\u2010level processes contributing to FOI and reveal time\u2010varying FOI. Using a hierarchical Bayesian model, variability from multiple epidemiological processes can be accounted for explicitly and described by data, which in turn can improve our mechanistic understanding of heterogeneities driving disease dynamics and improve inference. Also, because age data are not required, quantitative antibody methods have broader application in wildlife populations relative to conventional methods. Similarly, quantitative antibody methods make use of information from waning antibody levels, which can lead to misclassification by conventional methods.",

In what follows, we present a general quantitative antibody framework based on a mechanistic model of antibody kinetics and explicit representation of individual\u2010level variation, and demonstrate its ability to infer FOI accurately in many circumstances. We show how quantitative antibody data (i.e. concentration of antibody within individuals) from longitudinal studies within hosts (experimental data) can enable estimation of time since infection (TSI) for hosts sampled cross\u2010sectionally in a population (serosurveillance data). From the individual\u2010level TSI, we derive the history of epidemiological status (newly infected, susceptible or seropositive) for all hosts sampled in a population, and consequently FOI. The approach we outline addresses many of the challenges faced by current methods: epidemic dynamics, coarse age data, rapidly waning immunity, cross\u2010sectional serosurveillance data, complex antibody kinetics, and individual\u2010level variation in antibody responses. We demonstrate how our proposed cross\u2010scale framework can be used in a variety of host\u2010pathogen systems to infer epidemic dynamics and understand the role of different ecological processes.",

We modelled observed antibody data using a mechanistic function (g) of antibody kinetics that was adapted from (Simonsen et al. 2009; example shape in Fig. 2). The deterministic function g depends on both a vector of parameters that describes antibody kinetics (\u03b8, unknown) and TSI (\u03b4, known for the laboratory experiment data but unknown for the serosurveillance data). The antibody kinetics parameter vector \u03b8 includes six parameters (eqn (1)): baseline antibody level prior to exposure (X\n1), initial lag between exposure and antibody production (A), antibody production rate (r), period of antibody production in response to infection (B), antibody decay rate (d) and baseline antibody levels following antibody decay (X\n2). We assume that both the kinetic and serosurveillance data are measured with error and subject to the same amount of individual\u2010level variation (\u03c32). To represent antibody quantities we used signal to noise (S:N) ratios \u2013 the output of ELISAs, a commonly used antibody detection assay. We transformed the data by taking the inverse followed by the base 10 logarithm [log10(1/S:N ratio)], prior to analysis. The transformation yielded the characteristic rise and fall of antibody levels (raw S/N ratios fall and then rise) and negative values, which could be modelled with a normal distribution.

As expected, uncertainty in inferred quantities (seroprevalence, incidence, FOI) increased as antibody longevity increased (i.e. with decreased antibody decay rate; Fig. 3b\u2013d). With antibody longevities < 600 days, the model captured the magnitude and timing of peak FOI well with low uncertainty (Fig. 3d). With an antibody longevity of 600 days (almost 2 years), the model tended to overestimate FOI but still captured timing of the peak well with a level of uncertainty that gave a clear epidemic signal (Fig. 3d). Under conditions of rapid antibody decay (100 days), the model tended to produce larger misclassification errors (rising vs. decaying phases), generating a second peak that was not present in the true (simulated) dynamics (Fig. 3d, left). Misclassification was less of a problem for slower decay rates, because individuals spend proportionately more time in the decay vs. rising phase.",

We used antibody kinetic parameters that were estimated by fitting eqn (1) to the experimental mallard data (mean antibody longevity = 100 days, low level of individual variation, only 30 individuals; Fig. 4a). When samples were collected immediately following the main epidemic peak, the model inferred magnitude and timing of the main FOI curve well (Fig. 4d, middle). However, as the time since the epidemic peak increased relative to the time of sampling, the model estimated a later peak FOI relative to the truth and showed increased misclassification of individuals in the rising vs. decaying phase of antibody response (Fig. 4d, right). Similar patterns were observed for incidence (Fig. 4c). In terms of FOI, the mismatch in timing occurred because the model estimated a later onset of susceptible depletion and increased seroprevalence (Fig. 4b).

The main changes to the model included: 1) using a sliding window defining separate sampling periods over which FOI was calculated, and 2) including a temporal smoothing process on mean TSI to account for temporal autocorrelation due to the epidemic curve (Supporting Information 4). The autoregressive process on mean TSI allows the TSI parameter to learn from other samples collected at approximately the same time, which improves our ability to correctly classify antibody quantities into the rising or decaying phase of the antibody response curve, hence improving estimation of TSI. Using the same parameters as Fig. 4, but sampling more consistently across time (20 individuals of 2000 per week for 1 year), resulted in very good inference of true FOI and no secondary peak artefacts (Fig. 5). Thus, increasing the length of the sampling period and number of sampling occasions can provide more reliable inference of the timing of an epidemic curve.",

To inform the individual\u2010level antibody kinetics (y\n1), we used experimental antibody kinetic data from six snow geese and 30 mallards (Fig. 6 top right, Supporting Information 5), which had a known time of infection. We compared using mallard and geese data together, or the geese data separately with simulated curves to increase the sample size from 6 to 36 (Fig. 6, top right; Supporting Information 5). We also compared results using two separate distributions of TSI: Poisson as in Box 1, and negative binomial to allow more flexibility in TSI. The two approaches predicted the same timing of peak FOI, but the geese experimental data predicted FOI with lower precision and the mallard/geese experimental data predicted a slower rise to peak FOI under the negative binomial distribution of mean TSI (Fig. 6, bottom). We estimated peak seroprevalence in the snow goose population to be c. 0.65 (Fig. 6). Peak daily incidence was estimated to be c. 0.05\u20130.18 and peak daily FOI c. 0.09\u20130.25 (depending on assumptions about the distribution of TSI \u2013 Poisson vs. negative binomial, Fig. 6), which is consistent with seroconversion rates estimated with the same dataset (Samuel et al. 2015). The fact that the shape of the epidemic curve differed substantially depending on assumptions about the error structure of the TSI distribution (Poisson vs. negative binomial), suggests future theoretical work may be helpful for refining the general framework we present here. Nonetheless, regardless of the assumption about the error structure underlying the TSI distribution, a similar time of peak FOI was estimated.",

Furthermore, snow geese are highly gregarious colony nesting birds, which may promote the transmission and maintenance of density\u2010dependent pathogens (Samuel et al. 2015) such as influenza A viruses and Pasteurella bacteria (Samuel et al. 1999). Rather than providing a single snapshot of seroprevalence, the quantitative antibody approach infers transmission dynamics throughout the nesting, hatching, and early raising of young phases of the breeding season, demonstrating how quantitative antibody approaches can be applied to advance our understanding of breeding\u2010season transmission dynamics. Furthermore, if additional data explaining potential sources of individual\u2010level variation are available, this type of quantitative antibody framework can be used to quantify the relative role of various abiotic and biotic conditions on determining dynamics of FOI.",

The existence of a multitude of factors affecting individual\u2010level variation presents potential challenges in extracting FOI from quantitative serosurveillance data (Gilbert et al. 2013). To investigate this potential challenge, we generated antibody kinetic and serosurveillance data under different levels of variation in decay rates (Supporting Information 2, and 6). We compared cases where antibody kinetic data had either low, medium or high individual response variation while holding individual variation in serosurveillance data constant at low, medium or high levels and vice versa to produce all combinations of variation for both data types (Supporting Information 6). In our analysis, plots along the diagonal match the model assumption that individual\u2010level variation is similar in both data streams while plots outside the diagonal do not match this assumption. In general, the model performed better under equal levels of variation for both data streams (Fig. 7), but this was not consistent (e.g. low variation in antibody kinetic data and medium variation in serosurveillance data performed equally well as matching levels of variation; Fig. 7, top middle). Violation of the equal variation assumption biased results when one of the data streams had high individual\u2010level variation (Fig. 7, bottom row and right column). In addition, even when the assumption of equal variation was satisfied, high individual\u2010level variation underestimated the timing of peak FOI, although the magnitude was still captured well (Fig. 7, bottom right). When individual\u2010level variation in the antibody kinetic data was higher than that in serosurveillance data, the model overestimated the timing and magnitude of peak FOI substantially (Fig. 7 bottom, left and middle). Alternatively, when variation in serosurveillance data was substantially higher than that of antibody kinetic data, the timing of peak FOI was underestimated substantially (Fig. 7, right top and right middle).",

Of course, our study provides a simplified version of how drivers of individual\u2010level variation could be modelled explicitly.

Note that although the framework we propose can be improved by age data, the age data can be coarse (2\u20133 age classes), unlike in conventional age\u2010seroprevalence methods which require fine\u2010scaled age data.",

Re\u2010infection could occur only after immunity had waned to twice the baseline level, and it generated an anamnestic response which generally arose faster and decayed faster than primary infections (Supporting Information 5 and 7). Hosts with secondary, etc. infections did not become infectious in our example. We fit a similar mixture model as with the Yersinaia pestis example, where there were two separate functions describing antibody responses for primary infections vs. anamnestic responses. We assumed that classification of serosurveillance data into primary infections or anamnestic responses was perfect, and that covariate data such as age, sex or time of year could be used to inform classification of infection history. This type of model could be further developed to estimate the classification group with informed prior distributions. When we used our original model that did not account for multiple distributions of antibody responses, the timing of peak FOI was biased early (Fig. 8, bottom, left). Using the mixture model, we captured the timing of peak FOI accurately (Fig. 8, bottom right), indicating that appropriate data for distinguishing primary infections from anamnestic responses (secondary or more) may allow for accurate inference of FOI. In addition to age, sex and time of the year, data such as IgG:IgM ratios could be collected and used in the inference framework to predict antibody response distributions for individuals based on their covariate data (i.e. moving beyond a two\u2010component mixture model to multiple distributions of antibody response curves). Modelling anamnestic responses directly will not only improve inference of FOI but will also lead to a better understanding of the contribution of secondary infections in FOI dynamics.",

Imperfect serological assays can be a major source of measurement error, especially in wildlife disease systems (Gilbert et al. 2013) or when there is substantial pathogen diversity and/or cross\u2010reactivity in a diagnostic system (Mansfield et al. 2011). In these cases, selection of the antigen employed in serological tests is not trivial and impacts quantitative results (Troyer et al. 2005), suggesting it may be useful to consider suites of antigenic markers for estimating TSI to reduce uncertainty. For animal systems, experimental infections conducted in the target host species are extremely valuable for quantifying assay sensitivity and specificity (Bean et al. 2013) and developing epidemiological models that inform disease ecology and surveillance design (e.g. reviewed in Plowright et al. 2016). Previous work has shown that experimental information on assay sensitivity and specificity can be incorporated into models of serosurveillance data, decreasing bias in estimates of prevalence (McClintock et al. 2010). Likewise, the modelling framework we present is amenable for incorporation of this source of error by modelling it explicitly as a factor affecting the threshold of detection (y*) and/or parameters of the antibody kinetic function, depending on the type of error produced by the assay (Table 1).",

Likewise, mechanistic descriptions of sampling error have been deemed important for inference of wildlife disease parameters such as prevalence (McClintock et al. 2010; Bailey et al. 2014) or FOI (Conn et al. 2012), which were motivated by ecological work accounting for sampling error to provide better inference for unobserved ecological quantities (Williams et al. 2002; Hooten et al. 2007; Royle & Dorazio 2008; Hobbs & Hooten 2015). Recent work also emphasises that, in addition to sample size and independence between sampled individuals, sampling design should consider underlying seasonality in demographic and disease dynamics to obtain the most accurate estimates of disease transmission parameters (Vinh & Boni 2015). In systems with seasonality in disease transmission, it is useful to collect the surveillance data over a time scale that captures cycling and make inference over system\u2010specific time intervals (i.e. interval no larger than longevity of antibody response) to decipher temporal heterogeneity in the FOI (Simonsen et al. 2009; Vinh & Boni 2015). Provided that surveillance is conducted at intervals that capture epidemic cycling and at least some individuals with antibody titres are found, issues from small sample sizes can be attenuated by aggregating data from several sampling events (Blackwood et al. 2013). In addition, because each sample generates an individual's epidemiological status (susceptible, newly infected, seropositive for each day of interest in the past), more data can be used for calculating FOI at previous time steps as the sampling period increases, which could increase accuracy of the estimates (e.g. temporal quantitative antibody model we present in Supporting Information 4).",

Combined with a brief period of sampling, this led to the assumption that expected TSI has the same mean for all individuals, which is inappropriate when there are multiple epidemic peaks or more complicated dynamics occurring within the time frame of the analysis. In the systematic sampling model (Fig. 5, Supporting Information 4), we relax the equal\u2010mean assumption by allowing mean TSI to vary over time depending on recent antibody levels, which improves inference for samples collected over longer time periods and is important for adapting this framework for systems with endemic dynamics. One important application of our method could be to better understand transmission dynamics in wildlife species, where disease may be inapparent but where knowledge of FOI could inform spillover hazard to other hosts (e.g. Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus in dromedary camels). Using our framework, inference of time\u2010varying FOI can be made using relatively short\u2010term cross\u2010sectional sampling allowing for a more rapid understanding (relative to conventional methods that require long\u2010term sampling to infer time\u2010varying FOI) of the link between recent changes in FOI and spillover hazard. In ongoing work, we are investigating the ability of the model to infer FOI beyond a single epidemic curve to further evaluate the breadth of epidemiological behaviour for which this approach is appropriate. Preliminary findings suggest that allowing more flexibility in the distribution of TSI and/or incorporating longitudinal serosurveillance data may be important for modelling endemic dynamics (Table 1; Borremans et al. 2016).",

The dynamics of these systems are necessarily driven by induced cross\u2010immunity responses that can elicit significant antibody responses (Smith et al. 2004; Horton et al. 2010; Mansfield et al. 2011). The importance of multiple strains and cross\u2010reaction has been recognised in the study of human influenza A for many years as original antigenic sin (Francis 1960), the observation that after a vaccination or natural infection during later life, an individual's antibody boost against their first infection may be as strong or stronger than the boost to the current strain. This concept has been revised as antigenic seniority to indicate that second and subsequent early infections may also be important (Lessler et al. 2012), and incorporated into a life course model of antibody responses to multiple infections in which the number and timing of infections can be inferred (Kucharski et al. 2015). To account for cross\u2010immunity issues in quantitative antibody methods, it will be important to experimentally measure antibody kinetics for multiple target strains in particular host\u2010pathogen systems, which is a substantial investment of time and money. However, if such data were available, separate antibody kinetic functions for primary and cross\u2010reactive antibody kinetics could be incorporated in our framework for improved inference (Table 1), which would also improve understanding of the impacts of particular strains on driving FOI.",

While this may be an appropriate approximation in the case of gregarious goose populations congregating at breeding sites, most populations involve some degree of heterogeneity in host contact structure. In general, heterogeneity decreases population\u2010level FOI because not all susceptible individuals are in contact with all infectious individuals (as with homogenous mixing). Thus, when applying our framework to populations with heterogeneous contact structure, estimates of FOI could be biased depending on how the population is sampled relative to its contact structure. For example, if only high\u2010degree nodes are sampled, our model may have low bias because this situation is similar to homogenous mixing. Alternatively, if only low degree nodes are sampled our model would underestimate FOI because we would overestimate the number of susceptible individuals that are available for contact with newly infected hosts. Note that bias from contact structure would not affect estimates of incidence in our model because incidence does not rely on estimates of the number of susceptible individuals. Thus, it is safest to infer incidence rather than FOI in highly structured populations where contact structure is unknown. However, if data on contact structure exist, our calculation of FOI could be adapted to incorporate an appropriate relationship between susceptible and newly infected individuals (currently assumed to be directly proportional: Newly infecteds/susceptibles; Table 1).",

We found that 30 experimental mallards infected with influenza A captured individual\u2010level heterogeneity adequately. Depending on the host response, experimental animals need to be monitored regularly for a potentially long duration (3 months or more) to capture the long\u2010term antibody response profile, which can be expensive and difficult for pathogens that require high level biosecurity. However, a single well\u2010designed experimental study can be used for inference with many serosurveillance datasets and thus is a worthwhile investment. Such studies are specific to the particular host\u2010pathogen system being modelled, thus, for quantitative antibody methods to be broadly applicable, experimental datasets need to be available for a range of host\u2010pathogen systems. An informal survey of the literature revealed that these datasets have been collected in some systems, but the data are rarely presented in a manner that could be used by our model, highlighting a gap for future research. In addition, measuring covariate data alongside antibody responses (Table 1), as well as antibody responses in hosts with different infection histories (i.e. previous infections with the same or different strains/pathogens), will be important for broadening application of quantitative antibody methods.",
