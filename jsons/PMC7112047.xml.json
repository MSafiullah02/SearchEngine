MERS-CoV is endemic in the Middle East, where the virus is transmitted from dromedary camels, the natural reservoir, to humans (Perera et al., 2013; Reusken et al., 2013). Human-to-human transmission is inefficient but resulted in several hospital outbreaks of MERS (Assiri et al., 2013; Harriman et al., 2013; Memish et al., 2013), and there is concern that the virus may adapt to humans and cause a pandemic.",

Moreover, viruses isolated from animals in Morocco, Nigeria and Burkina Faso form a distinct phylogenetic subclade, C1, and exhibit reduced ability to replicate in human respiratory cells (Chu et al., 2018). In addition, MERS-CoV transmission from camels to humans has not been observed in North- and West-Africa (Munyua et al., 2017; So et al., 2018), although two livestock handlers in Kenya were shown to harbor antibodies against MERS-CoV (Liljander et al., 2016), Moreover, no MERS cases were documented in Africa. At present, the barrier(s) impeding efficient spread of African MERS-CoV in human cells and camel-human transmission of these viruses remain to be identified.",

For this, the S protein binds to the cellular receptor dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4, CD26) (Raj et al., 2013) via its surface unit, S1, and fuses the viral membrane with a target cell membrane via its transmembrane unit, S2 (Li, 2016). Binding of MERS-S to DPP4 is essential for MERS-CoV infection of cells and DPP4 expression and the S protein/DPP4 interface are major determinants of MERS-CoV cell and species tropism (Raj et al., 2013; van Doremalen et al., 2014). The S proteins of North- and West-African MERS-CoV of the C1 clade harbor 6\u20139 amino acid substitutions relative to MERS-CoV (Fig. 1\nA, Table 1\n) and these substitutions might reduce S protein-driven entry into target cells. However, this possibility has not been examined so far.",

Pseudotyping systems are known to adequately model key aspects of the coronavirus entry process. In order to study host cell entry driven by S proteins from the C1 subclade, we employed PCR-based mutagenesis to generate expression constructs for the S proteins of MERS-CoV from Morocco (camel/Morocco/CIRAD-HKU213/2015, MO), Nigeria (camel/Nigeria/NV1657/2016, NI) and Burkina Faso (camel/Burkina Faso/CIRAD-HKU785/2015, BF), using a published expression construct for MERS-CoV EMC S protein as template (Kleine-Weber et al., 2018, 2019). Moreover, expression constructs for all S proteins were generated that encoded a C-terminal V5 antigenic tag. Western blot analysis of cells transfected to express the S proteins under study revealed that MERS-S EMC, MO, NI and BF were expressed and proteolytically processed to comparable levels (Fig. 1B). Moreover, these S proteins were incorporated into VSV particles with similar efficiency (Fig. 1C). These results suggest that mutations present in North- and West-African MERS-S of the C1 subclade do not reduce S protein expression and proteolytic processing in human cells.",

For this, 293T cells transfected to express the S proteins under study were incubated with soluble DPP4 fused to the Fc portion of human immunoglobulin and binding was quantified by flow cytometry, as described previously (Kleine-Weber et al., 2019). The results showed that MERS-S EMC, MO, NI, and BF bound to DPP4 robustly and with comparable efficiency while DPP4 binding to cells expressing no S protein was within the background range (Fig. 2\n). Finally, we tested whether the robust binding to DPP4 translated into efficient S protein-driven entry. For this, cell lines were selected that were shown to express low levels (293T), intermediate levels (Vero 76) or high levels of DPP4 (Caco-2, 293T + DPP4) (Kleine-Weber et al., 2019). MERS-S MO, NI and BF mediated entry into all cell lines with at least the same efficiency as MERS-S EMC (Fig. 3\n). Moreover, under conditions of low or medium DPP4 expression, entry mediated by MERS-S MO and BF was even more efficient than entry mediated by MERS-S EMC (Fig. 3), although these differences were not statistically significant.",

            "text": "Our results show that amino acid substitutions present in North- and West-African MERS-S proteins relative to MERS-S EMC do not compromise S protein expression in human cells, at least when transfected cells are examined. Similarly, proteolytic processing of the S proteins in the constitutive secretory pathway, which is known to be carried out by furin (Gierer et al., 2015; Millet and Whittaker, 2014), was not appreciably altered. Moreover, binding of North- and West-African S proteins to DPP4 was not diminished as compared to MERS-S EMC, despite the presence of at least one substitution in the receptor binding domain (RBD) in each S protein tested. This finding might not be unexpected since the substituted amino acid residues do not make direct contact with residues in DPP4 (Lu et al., 2013). In keeping with these observations, all African S proteins mediated robust viral entry into non-human primate (Vero 76) and human cell lines (293T, Caco-2) expressing different levels of DPP4 (Kleine-Weber et al., 2019). In fact, MERS-S MO- and BF-driven entry into cell lines expressing low or intermediate levels of DPP4 was augmented as compared to MERS-S EMC, in keeping with these S proteins showing slightly enhanced DPP4 binding as compared to MERS-S EMC. Finally, it is noteworthy that MERS-S activation in Caco-2 cells mainly depends on the cellular serine protease TMPRSS2 while activation in 293T and Vero 76 cells is mediated by the cellular cysteine protease cathepsin L (Kleine-Weber et al., 2018, 2019). Thus, North- and West-African MERS-S proteins seem to be able to use both pathways available for S protein activation in human cells.",

Moreover, we note that a recent study examining two MERS-S sequences (C2 subclade) from camels in Ethiopia demonstrated that these sequences, when inserted into MERS-CoV EMC, reduced viral entry and replication and increased sensitivity to antibody-mediated neutralization (Shirato et al., 2019). The reduction in entry was observed for Vero and to a lesser degree for Vero-TMPRSS2 cells and was generally modest. Nevertheless, these results suggest that S proteins from viruses circulating in Ethiopia might harbor mutations that diminish entry into human cells and that are not present in the MERS-S proteins studied here. Amino acid residues I139, L515, E851 and S1302 in the spike protein are unique to Ethiopian MERS-CoV and warrant further analysis.",

(A) Domain organization of the MERS-S proteins studied here. Black arrowheads indicate amino acid variations found in S proteins of African viruses as compared to the S protein of the prototypic Arabian MERS-CoV strain, human betacoronavirus 2c EMC/2012 (GenBank: JX869059.2). Abbreviations: SP = signal peptide, RBD = receptor binding domain, FP = fusion peptide, HR1/HR2 = heptad repeat 1/2, TD = transmembrane domain. (B) The indicated S proteins were transiently expressed in 293T cells, whole cell lysates (WCL) were prepared at 48 h posttransfection and S protein expression was analyzed via Western blot, using an antibody targeting the C-terminal V5-tag. Cells expressing no S protein were used as negative control and detection of \u03b2-actin (ACTB) served as loading control. Similar results were obtained in two separate experiments. (C) Rhabdoviral transduction vectors (VSVpp) harboring the indicated S proteins were concentrated by centrifugation and, following lysis, analyzed by Western blot for S protein incorporation, using an antibody targeting the C-terminal V5-tag. Transduction vectors harboring no S protein were used as negative controls and detection of vesicular stomatitis virus matrix protein (VSV-M) served as loading control. Similar results were obtained in a separate experiment. Numbers on the left side of each blot indicate the molecular weight in kilodalton (kDa). Further, bands representing the precursor S protein (S0, black circle) and the S2 subunit of proteolytically processed S protein (grey circle) are indicated.",
