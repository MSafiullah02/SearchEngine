It is one of the emerging infectious diseases of Nepal [2]. Clinical manifestation of scrub typhus includes a painless papule called eschar representing localized cutaneous necrosis at the site of infecting chigger bite, followed by fever, generalized headache, diffuse myalgia, anorexia, generalized lymphadenopathy, and non-pruritic body rash. However, it can present with atypical signs and symptoms such as those of acute kidney injury, gastroenteritis, rarely pneumonitis, and acute respiratory distress syndrome. Meningitis, encephalitis, and hepatic dysfunction have been reported too, particularly in severe cases, with multisystem involvement [3]. Case fatality rate of scrub typhus is 6% for untreated and 1.4% for treated cases [1]., [4] Therefore, a high degree of clinical suspicion is required for the diagnosis of scrub typhus which can be confirmed by a rapid diagnostic test or polymerase chain reaction (PCR); Indirect immunofluorescence assay (IFA) being the gold standard test\u2014a four-fold rise in IgM antibody titer is usually diagnostic of infection [5]. Unfortunately, in low-resource settings, it may take several weeks just to get the test results. Scrub typhus is commonly treated with doxycycline, a highly effective antibiotic given for 1 week.",

UTI is usually caused by Escherichia coli and rarely by other uropathogens such as other Enterobacteriaceae (Klebsiella spp. and Proteus spp.), Pseudomonas, enterococci, and staphylococci [6]. Generally, the patients with UTI present with fever and occasionally with chills or rigors, fatigue or malaise, flank pain, costovertebral angle tenderness, and pelvic or perineal pain. Pyelonephritis can develop if pathogens ascend to the kidneys either via ureters or through the lymphatics [7].",
