As a response, we have attempted to develop a conceptual framework (CF) that could guide the development, implementation, and evaluation of MH interventions during the ongoing pandemic. This CF was developed by early career psychiatrists, from 16 countries that cover all the WHO regions. Their opinions were elicited via semi-structured questionnaire. They were asked to provide their views about the current MH situation of their countries, existing myths and misinformation, and the possible resources available. They were also asked to propose solutions and approaches to provide accessible and affordable care. The CF's were prepared based on the extant literature and the views expressed; they illustrate the epidemiology of MH issues, preparedness plans, stage-specific plans/innovative solutions, opportunities to integrate those plans and probable outcomes at policy level.",

Health Preparedness and Action Framework (MHPAF):The WHO -Global Influenza Preparedness Plan (WHO-GIPP) neither mentions nor recommends the inclusion of a mental health component in the management of pandemics despite evidence that the mental health of the general population and health care workers is at risk(WHO,2005).The recently published report on pandemic preparedness in WHO Member States has not taken account the need for a mental health response(WHO,2020). Therefore, we considered the opinions of respective country representatives to develop stage-specific measures(Figure 2)pertaining to the emotional epidemic curve mentioned above. The framework was prepared in line with the WHO-GIPP(WHO,2005).Brief summary of the WHO -GIPP:It includes the description of the stages of pandemic, the role of the WHO and recommendations for before and during a pandemic(WHO,2005; WHO,2009). It classifies the pandemic in six phases and includes a post-peak and post-pandemic period. The phase 1-3 measures are directed towards increasing the health care capacity through training, development of infrastructure and a surveillance system, while phase 4 to 6 includes the coordination, support, response and community mitigation efforts. Community mitigation efforts are vital public response measures aimed to halt transmission of influenza virus. It includes social distancing (e.g. travel restriction, working from home, closing of school, city or country lockdown), masks, respiratory and hand washing hygiene(WHO, 2005).InsertFigure 2",

However, most HCW are inadequately trained in the intervention. In addition, WHO-PFA does not address the primary mental health needs of the people under quarantine, those facing COVID-19 related social stigma, and those affected by national mitigation measures (social distancing, lockdowns, etc.). Furthermore, WHO-PFA provides little attention to managing myths and fake news, the impact of the virtual world on pandemic-related distress and the effects of the epidemic curve on mental health. Thus, it does not address the first peak of the EEC nor the second. It may also have poor face-and contentvalidity, all of which limits its use in practice. As such, we suggest the following modifications in the WHO-PFA (Ref.Box 1) to address core mental health issues. Further tailoring of the PFA to the socio-cultural aspects of various nations may be required.",
