            "text": "The self-protective behavior appears to be different among diverse contexts where people play different social roles in various daily activities. Of the diverse social contexts, one of the most popularly discussed contexts is where one plays the role of a worker in the workplace. As results, academic efforts have been largely made in the field of industrial safety to influence or encourage an individual worker's interest in and attitude to adopting greater extent of self-protective behavior against workplace hazards. Different from the passive attitude and reluctant propensity for adopting self-protective behavior (e.g., following standardized operational procedures) in a workplace, people are usually alert to the personal risks or dangers that exist in a marketplace where they are playing the role of a consumer and have no hesitation in adopting self-protective behavior (i.e., to suspend or cease the consumption of particular products) spontaneously. In other words, while operations management attempts to modify workers\u2019 self-protective behavior by developing and using innovative incentives or tailor-made occupational safety programs, similarly but more aggressively, marketing managers may have to eliminate or retard consumers\u2019 overreacting self-protective behavior by proposing rapid and effective marketing programs. However, in contrast to a number of conceptual models regarding workers\u2019 self-protective behavior (see the review in DeJoy, 1996) which have been proposed to help agglomerate research findings and guide the development of practical occupational safety programs and compare with myriads of studies emphasize other facets of the consumer behavior in restaurants (e.g., Gu\u00e9guen et al., 2009, Gu\u00e9guen et al., 2012, Heung and Gu, 2012, Milliman, 1986, Tse et al., 2002, Wei and Miao, 2013, Yang et al., 2009), it is surprising that little research has discussed or explored consumers\u2019 self-protective behavior in tourism and hospitality literature.",

            "text": "One of the most well-known cases of consumers\u2019 self-protective behavior in decades can be observed during the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) outbreak in Asia. Lakshmanan (2003, as cited by McKercher and Chon, 2004) aptly describes the feature of the outbreak by observing that \u2018a panic spread faster than the disease itself.\u2019 Some scholars (e.g., Chen et al., 2007, Chuo, 2007, McKercher and Chon, 2004) explain the phenomenon clearly that people were overreacting to the outbreak. As consequences of the consumers\u2019 self-protective behavior in response to the epidemic crisis, the costs of canceled travel and decreased investment in Asia might rival the Asian financial crisis of the mid-1990s (De Lisle, 2004) and the tourism and hospitality industries in Asia had almost completely collapsed (McKercher and Chon, 2004). In fact, the industries are still threatened by the possibility of a new epidemic or pandemic crisis (Page et al., 2012). Ten years after the SARS outbreak, human cases of infection with a novel avian influenza A(H7N9) were reported in eastern China on 31 March 2013. Since then, the number of notified cases reported to World Health Organization (WHO) has increased, reaching 137 cases (including 45 deaths) as of October 25 (http://www.who.int/influenza/human_animal_interface/influenza_h7n9/Data_Reports/en/index.html). Since the evolution of the H7N9 epidemic in China has been observed, analyzed and reported as a signal indicating a possible risk of a larger outbreak in the very near future (Kelland, 2013, Morens and Fauci, 2013, Schenk et al., 2013, Yoshikura, 2013), the successive crises from the SARS to the H7N9 epidemic in Asia provide an appropriate (if not the best) natural context for studies investigating consumers\u2019 self-protective behavior in the field of hospitality management.",

Accordingly, the remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Research on perceived physical risk and self-protective behavior is first summarized. Candidate models elicited from the above summary are briefly introduced and the applicability of the models for restaurant diners\u2019 self-protective behavior in response to an epidemic outbreak is deductively reviewed subsequently. A prospective model is proposed based on the most applicable model elicited from the above review and followed by the hypotheses formulated for this study. Afterward the procedural, measuring, and analytical design of the empirical examination on both theoretical and managerial applicability of the proposed model are described respectively. Finally, the analyzed results are presented and followed by a further discussion of the results and their implications.",

            "text": "As a corresponding function of an individual's perceived physical risk, individual's self-protective behavior has been explored and discussed in terms of industrial, food, and daily activity safety. One of the most popularly discussed social contexts is where one plays the role of a worker in the workplace. In terms of industrial safety, researchers (Cohen et al., 1979, Peters, 1991) examine and suggest effective strategies or techniques which can influence or encourage individual workers\u2019 interest in and attitude toward adopting greater extent of self-protective behavior against workplace hazards. More specifically, Vaughan (1993) examines immigrant workers\u2019 self-protective behavior in response to the environmental hazards of pesticide exposure. The other popularly discussed social context is where one plays the role of a consumer in the marketplace. Extant research regarding consumers\u2019 behavior resulted from their perceived physical risks has been mostly discussed in terms of \u2018food safety behavior.\u2019 In response to unsafe food such as milk containing the recombinant bovine growth hormone (rbGH) (e.g., Grobe and Douthitt, 1995) or beef contaminated by the bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) (e.g., Pennings et al., 2002), the safety behaviors refer to actions being taken to assure the safety of food, including behaviors of seeking information, food preparation, and food purchase (Schafer et al., 1993). Since the conceptual constructs and performing patterns of a person's self-protective behavior appear to be different among diverse contexts where he/she plays different social roles in various daily activities, Weinstein (1989) extends the application and understanding of the individual's self-protective behavior to various daily situations. He discusses the effect of prior personal experiences of accidents and an individual's post self-protective behavior in response to the risk of the occurrence of future identical accidents occurrence in daily life, such as the attention to the use of seat belts in the event of automobile accidents, individual crime prevention efforts due to previous criminal victimization (except rape), natural hazard preparedness and compliance with evacuation warnings after prior experience of natural hazards, and changes in smoking behavior after the occurrence of myocardial infarction. On the other hand, in contrast to the comparisons between multiple contexts, Tewksbury (2003) specifically explores the effect of college students\u2019 lifestyle characteristics on their self-protective behavior of guardianship adoption in response to the risk of criminal victimization.",

(1993) examine the application of the Health Belief Model to food safety and confirm the actions that people usually take to assure the safety of food. They reveal that people's perceived personal susceptibility, self-efficacy (perceived sense of control), motivation to maintain good health, and demographics such as age, gender and household size can be used to predict consumers\u2019 self-protective behavior. Grobe et al. (1999) propose an rbGH risk-perception classification scheme based on Weinstein's (1988) five-stage precaution adoption process model and examine differences among research subjects classified by the scheme. In the study, they define \u2018consumer's self-protective behavior\u2019 as the actions such as seeking assurance that purchased milk came from non-treated herds and to reduce or stop milk consumption in response to the health threat caused by rbGH contained in milk. The findings of the above studies show that consumers\u2019 risk-attitude, product involvement, gender, age, education attainment, income, and household size are important factors associated with the undertaking of their self-protective behavior. Besides, the above consumer studies also provide a standard analytical design to examine a model's applicability to people's self-protective behavior in particular contexts.",

To take this research further, DeJoy (1996) reviews and analyzes the applicability of health behavior models to workers\u2019 responses to possible job-related hazards then proposes a four-stage integrative theoretical framework to conceptualize the self-protective behavior. Although no empirical examination is conducted in DeJoy's studies, they indeed set a standard for research design for examining an individual's self-protective behavior and provide a paradigm of model proposition for the coming self-protective behavior research.",

In other words, value-expectancy models try to explain health behavior by focusing on the rational pursuit of a particular action's utility maximization. However, the rational decision-making process can be conducted only in the context that individuals are able to precisely assess both the likelihood and the severity of physical losses caused by a particular hazard.",

Accordingly, the model assumes that one must advance through a series of distinct stages before taking an action to protect oneself. The first stage occurs when an individual learns of the existence of the hazard. In stage two, the individual believes that there is a significant probability that others will experience the hazard. Subsequently, the individual in the third stage believes he/she is personally susceptible to the hazard. In the fourth stage, the individual expresses the intention to engage in self-protective behavior. The individual may persist in the fourth stage by means of using barriers such as financial cost, time cost, or social cost (e.g., embarrassing nature of the protective behavior).

Although researchers recognize substantial biases arose from quantitative risk estimations, Van der Pligt (1996) indicates that most research on health behavior seems to disregard the substantial biases and assume that people are able to accurately estimate the magnitude of risks they take. Consistent with findings of the studies regarding biases in individual's risk perception, Chuo (2007) even suggests that the magnitude of people's aversion to the plague (risk attitude) rather than the perceived possibility of being infected by the plague (risk perception) tended to be the dominant determinant in the formulation of the SARS-generated panic.",

However, the second horn is that a number of consumers ceased their consumption completely during and even shortly after the outbreak period. In addition, to take possible evolution of individual's self-protective behavior over time into consideration, a case study seemed to be an appropriate, if not the best, approach to reach consumers of a wide range of self-protective behaviors during the SARS outbreak and to investigate their subsequent self-protective behaviors to the following avian influenza A(H7N9) epidemic.",

Many studies have been widely conducted to investigate the self-regulated priming effect on a variety of consumers\u2019 behavior by manipulating their self-view through such as referencing tasks (e.g., Aaker and Williams, 1998), situational contexts (e.g., Briley et al., 2000), and primes (e.g., Gardner et al., 1999). Among these studies, Mandel (2003) reveals a self-construal priming effect on consumers\u2019 risk-taking (the antithesis of self-protective) behavior and confirms that individuals demonstrate varying degrees of risk tolerance across experimental manipulations in which either their \u2018independent self\u2019 or \u2018dependent self\u2019 is primed. Aaker and Lee (2001) assure that consumers of an independent self tend to be gain-attainment focused and those of an interdependent self tend to be loss-prevention focused. Besides, Lee et al. (2000) confirm that consumers with a gain-attainment focus will regulate their behavior toward positive outcomes such as hedonic advancement and pleasure achievement, while those with a loss-prevention focus will regulate their behavior toward negative outcomes such as safety assurance and warranty request. As an application of the above research findings, restaurant diners may tend to be either gain-attainment or loss-prevention focused and demonstrate varying degrees of risk aversion when their independent or dependent self-view is activated. In specific, when restaurant diners\u2019 independent self is activated in response to an epidemic crisis, they may tend to limit the progression of their self-protective behavior in order to attain gains (e.g., convenience, enjoyments of the senses and hedonic experiences) from their dining service patronage. Contrary, those whose dependent self is activated may tend to adopt advanced types of self-protective behavior to avoid potential losses (e.g., personal infection or risking their lives) caused by the patronage in such a crisis. Therefore, results of this study \u2018significant more married restaurant diners were found in relatively advanced types (i.e., Type 4 and Type 5) of self-protective behavior adopters and more unmarried restaurant diners were found in less-advanced types of self-protective behavior adopters\u2019 can be interpreted with the above reasoning that married restaurant diners\u2019 dependent self and unmarried restaurant diners\u2019 independent self seem to be activated respectively in response to an epidemic crisis and the progression of their self-protective behavior adoption is correspondingly moderated by the self-regulated priming effect.",

Since perceived sense of control, perceived personal avertibility, and magnitude of aversion are assured to be distinctive psychographic characteristics between types of restaurant diners in this study, it can be expected that their self-protective behavior will be minified in effect if (1) the trend of outbreak is perceived controllable; (2) official and medical supports are perceived not only sufficient but also effective; and (3) their aversion to the epidemic can be relieved.

Since the unrealistic pessimism tends to amplify people's estimation of the risk perception (i.e., estimated probability of infection) in an epidemic crisis, \u2018comparative risk appraisal (Van der Pligt, 1998, Radcliffe and Klein, 2002, Weinstein, 1984)\u2019\u2014the level of risk a person estimates he/she is taking compared to others\u2014may preclude the effect of subjective biases on risk estimation through a comparative approach. By using the substitute, further research could be carried out to examine the effect of unrealistic pessimism on restaurant diners\u2019 self-protective behavior in response to various types of crises. However, when consumer's overreacting self-protective behavior is assumed to be amplified by their significant unrealistic pessimism, it should be noticed that Weinstein's PAPM seems not so appropriate to be the conceptual framework underlying the self-protective behavior since the sequential nature of the model presumes implicitly that people have to perceive other's risk before their personal risk when facing a particular crisis.",
