To this end, we used 10,000 simula=ons from each model to test the performance of ABC for each of our models. In par=cular, we performed the following tests: i) we checked if we were able to fit the observed data with the simula=ons from the models we used; ii) we checked for bias and power in the model choice procedure we used; iii) we checked for bias and accuracy for parameter es=ma=on under the favored SDN model.",

In Tables X2 and X3, we contrast the summary sta=s=cs of the ten most closely fiNng simula=ons for CEU and CHB respec=vely, along with the sta=s=cs calculated from the observed data. In Figures X3 and X4 , we show the fit of all pairwise transformed sta=s=cs, which were used for inference. Overall, we find that our simula=ons match the observed data reasonably well. Some of the theta es=mators seem hard to match, in par=cularly \u03b8H and thus Fay and Wu's H are oVen different even for simula=ons that match the data well. For the transformed sta=s=cs (Figures X3 and X4) , we similarly find that all simulated data set lie within the range of the models.",

Bias and accuracy of model choice To infer bias in the model choice, we applied the model choice procedure to 10,000 data sets simulated with parameters drawn randomly from the prior distribu=on for each of the SDN, SSV and NTR models. We recorded which model the simula=ons were assigned to in Figure X5 . We find that we overall have high power to recover the correct model, with 76% of the SSV and 95% of the SDN simula=ons being assigned correctly under the Asian demographic model, and 70% of the SSV and 97% of the SDN simula=ons being assigned correctly under the European demographic model. The fact that we have a higher chance of recovering the SDN model compared to the SSV model indicates that the model choice has a slight bias in favor of the SDN model, which we should keep in mind when interpre=ng our results. In par=cular, for the European popula=ons (CEU, FIN, GBR and TSI), our results suggest that the SDN model is favored by a posterior probability of roughly 80%, corresponding to a Bayes factor of around 4 ( Table 3) . According to Jeffrey's interpreta=on [1] , this s=ll provides substan=al evidence in favor for the SDN model versus the SSV model. Given the bias, however, we interpret the evidence in Europe more conserva=vely as non--conclusive. For the Asian popula=ons (CHB, CHS and JPT), the evidence for the SDN model is much stronger, with the posterior probability for the SDN model being between 91.3% and 97.5%, corresponding to a Bayes Factor of at least 10. Thus, even with the bias in mind, these results should be interpreted as substan=al evidence for the SDN model. Figure X5 . Model choice accuracy. We performed the model choice for 10,000 simulated data sets for both the SDN and SSV model using the European (eur) and Asian (asi) demographic model. The violin plots show the distribu=on of assigned posterior probabili=es for each model. The propor=on of correctly assigned models is given above the plot.",
