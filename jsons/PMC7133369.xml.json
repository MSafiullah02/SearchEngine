Within 2 months since its first appearance in Asia in mid-February of 2003, the World Health Organization (WHO) has already received reports of the outbreak of SARS in 26 countries on all five continents [1]. The clinical symptoms of SARS are nonspecific, including high fever, dry cough, breathing difficulties, muscle pain, and generalized weakness. The incubation period can last from 2 to 10 days, thus enables symptomless individuals to transmit the disease through either close person-to-person contact or travel from one city to another city in the world. The mortality rate of SARS is about 3\u201310%. Only recently has the causative agent of this disease been found. The latest multicountry laboratory findings have confirmed that a new pathogen, a member of the coronavirus family never been seen in humans, is the cause of SARS [2]. However, the exact transmission route of the disease is still unknown, and quick diagnostic tests as well as specific treatments are also not yet available. Under these unknown circumstances, prevention is of particular importance in containing the global spread of this new infectious disease. This study aimed to examine factors affecting Hong Kong people's practice of preventive behaviors against SARS. Findings from this study would provide pertinent information in designing and implementing SARS prevention programs not only for Hong Kong, but for other countries as well.",

At the beginning of the local outbreak of this disease in early March of 2003, mainly health care workers who treated the index patients were infected with the disease [3]. Very soon, new cases were reported among close contacts of known patients, and the disease then quickly spread to the community. Local health authorities have since stepped up various prevention and intervention activities against further spread of the disease [4]. At the community level, health authorities have launched large-scale public health education programs about the disease, issued preventive health guidelines to health care workers and the general public, suspension of classes for schools and universities, prompt isolation of infected individuals, and ordering of probable infected individuals to quarantine themselves at home for 10 days. At the individual level, health advice is given on ways to prevent contracting and spreading of SARS. The suggested SARS preventive behaviors include (1) maintaining good personal hygiene (covering nose and mouth with a tissue when sneezing or coughing and washing hands immediately afterward with liquid soap), (2) developing a healthy lifestyle with proper diet, regular exercises, adequate rest, and no smoking, (3) ensuring good ventilation at home and in the office, and (4) wearing facemasks, especially for those with respiratory tract infections or those caring for them. Despite all these efforts, an average of 40\u201350 new infected cases and about five deaths of SARS were reported daily. The disease continued to affect both health care workers, as well as individuals from the community until June 2003.",

With environmental and policies support, these individual preventive behaviors can pass on to effective population-level prevention efforts [8], [9]. For example, public education and media campaigns that disseminate health messages and information, environmental manipulation that provide necessary facilities, and national policies that make available economic incentive or reimbursement can motivate many individuals in the community to practice the desired health behaviors. Thus, various psychosocial approaches, such as the Health Belief Model [10], the Theory of Reasoned Action [11], the Social Cognitive Model [12], the Protection Motivation Theory [13], and the Stages of Change Model [14], have been put forward to predict the practice of preventive behaviors at the individual level.",

This model postulates that the practice of preventive behaviors is a function of the degree to which individuals perceive a personal health threat and the perception that particular preventive behaviors will be effective in reducing the threat [10]. In applying this model to understand the practice of SARS preventive behaviors, perceived health threat refers to individuals' perception of their vulnerability to contracting SARS (perceived susceptibility) and that this disease has serious consequences (perceived severity). Individuals' belief that the practice of the suggested SARS preventive behaviors will prevent SARS depends on (1) whether they think these preventive behaviors will be effective (perceived benefits), (2) whether the cost of undertaking these behaviors (perceived barriers) exceeds the benefits, and (3) whether there are any cues (cues to action) to trigger these behaviors. Cues to action can be internal, such as the perception of a body state, or external, such as the influence of mass media and social pressure.",

This model helps to predict the practice of preventive dental care [15], dieting for obesity [16], AIDS risk-reduction behaviors [17], breast self-examination [18], [19], [20], sunscreen use [21], and participation in a broad array of health screening programs such as obtaining a mammogram to screen for breast cancer [22], [23], [24] and undergoing genetic testing for cancer susceptibility [25], [26]. Prevention programs that draw on this model to effect behavioral change have also yielded positive results in increasing various health behaviors to prevent dental problems [15], osteoporosis [27], and diabetes [28]. Overall, perceived benefits, perceived barriers, and perceived susceptibility are the three most powerful components of the Health Belief Model in influencing whether individuals practice different preventive behaviors [21], [29], [30]. It is also found that the actual risk of developing a disease is a much less important predictor of individual preventive behaviors than is perceived susceptibility [31].",

The first objective was to determine the rates of the target SARS preventive behavior in adult Chinese with different demographic background. Among various SARS preventive behaviors suggested by local and international health authorities, this study focused on the wearing of facemasks. This target preventive behavior was chosen for this study because it was specific to this disease and involved deliberate effort of individuals. Based on past related literature, it was expected that men, the younger age group, and individuals with low educational attainment would be less likely to wear facemasks. The second objective of this study was to test the efficacy of the Health Belief Model in predicting the practice of the target preventive behavior. Based on past related literature, it was expected that perceived susceptibility, perceived severity, perceived benefits, perceived barriers, and cues to action were significant predictors of facemask wearing.",

In particular, findings showed that three of the five components of the model, namely, perceived susceptibility, cues to action, and perceived benefits, were significant predictors. Review studies of the Health Belief Model have also found that among the five components, perceived susceptibility and perceived benefits are the more powerful components in predicting preventive behaviors [29], [30]. The present results showed that compared to those with a low level of perceived susceptibility, individuals feeling personally very vulnerable to contracting SARS were 2.5 times more likely to wear facemasks. It was also found that individuals who had strong beliefs in the effectiveness of wearing facemasks to prevent SARS were 1.4 times more likely to wear facemasks than those who did not have these beliefs. Furthermore, this study showed that cues to action were as an important predictor as perceived susceptibility. Those who were more aware of environmental cues were 2.4 times more likely to wear facemasks than those who perceived few cues to action. Previous studies have also indicated that cues to action in the form of advice from family members and health care professionals are also very important factors in increasing various preventive behaviors [23].",

In spite of previous literature indicating the powerfulness of perceived barriers in influencing the practice of preventive behaviors [21], [23], [29], [30], this component did not significantly predict the wearing of facemasks in the present sample of adult Chinese. It might be that this target preventive behavior is relatively easy to perform, despite some discomfort and inconvenience. Individuals can have complete control of the behavior and can take off the facemasks anytime they want or feel uncomfortable. Facemasks are cheap and easy to obtain, except during the early outbreak of SARS. Thus, there are relatively less perceived barriers in wearing facemasks as compared to participating in screening or immunization programs. This study also found that perceived severity of SARS did not significantly predict facemask wearing. Earlier studies on cancer noted that perceived severity was not related to preventive behaviors, as cancer is uniformly thought of as a serious disease [30]. On the other hand, it would also be argued that the failure of perceived severity to predict the target SARS preventive behavior might be related to individuals' underestimation of the potential of this disease to become a global epidemic. During the early stage of the local outbreak, this disease affected mainly health care workers, a few index patients, and their close contacts [3]. The serious consequences of this disease with increasing prevalence and mortality rates might have been overlooked. Thus, the public was not motivated or did not anticipate the need to practice the suggested SARS preventive behavior.",

Results showed that men, single people, and the 19\u201329 age group were significantly less likely to wear facemasks to prevent SARS than women, married people, and individuals aged between 30 and 59 years. Although statistically nonsignificant, odds ratios also showed that individuals with less than university education and very low personal income were also less likely to wear facemasks. Researchers have argued that the low rates of preventive behaviors among young, single, and low education men may be related to their inadequate knowledge about the disease, peer influences, risk-taking tendency, and perceived immortality and immunity to various disease [5], [38].",

            "text": "This study found that about 61.2% of the respondents consistently wore facemasks to prevent SARS. In other words, despite the rapid spread, increasing death toll, and vigorous preventive activities, close to 40% of the respondents did not practice the target SARS preventive behavior. For some subgroups, the noncompliance rates were even higher. As there are evidences that SARS may emerge again both locally and across countries [1], there is a need for Hong Kong, as well as other countries, to further enhance the effectiveness of related prevention and intervention measures to contain the disease. Results of this study had significant implications for SARS prevention programs. It is suggested that individuals' perception of their own vulnerability to the disease should be emphasized by highlighting the global outbreak and debilitating health consequences of SARS, which not only affect health care workers, older people, those with chronic illness, or individuals of a particular ethnicity. Public education and media campaigns should be conducted regularly in schools, workplaces, and community settings to disseminate the latest findings of SARS. The public should be made aware that there is no specific treatment and vaccination for this disease; therefore, individuals must take own precautions to prevent contracting the disease. It should also be emphasized that at the individual level, facemask wearing remains one of the most effective ways to prevent contracting and spreading SARS [39]. Indeed, studies have shown that communications that highlight perceived susceptibility and simultaneously increase the perception that a particular health behavior will reduce the health threat are successful in promoting various preventive behaviors [15], [27], [28]. The present study also showed that environmental cues to wear facemasks are very important. Other researchers have argued that environmental manipulation and policies support are crucial to translate individual to collective preventive efforts [8], [9]. Environmental cues can be in the form of signs and posters to remind people to wear facemasks and should be placed in prominent areas in schools, at worksites, and in public places. Advice, recommendation, or encouragement from health care professionals are also useful to increase individuals' likelihood to wear facemasks. Policies that require the wearing of facemasks in certain locations (e.g., inside hospitals) or for those who have respiratory symptoms will also ensure individuals to practice the desired preventive behaviors. Finally, it is also particularly important to target SARS prevention activities at those who are less likely to practice these behaviors, namely, men, single individuals, and the younger age group.",

Comparison with the census data showed that the present sample comprised more women as well as more affluent and better educated individuals, who were also more likely to practice the suggested SARS behaviors. In view of this, the present sample might have higher rates of facemask wearing than the general population. Second, only retrospective self-reports of respondents were collected without external verification, and results might be subject to recall and social desirability bias. Third, this study focused on the five key components of the Health Belief Model to predict rates of facemask wearing. It did not investigate individuals' knowledge of and emotional responses to SARS, which have also been found to significantly influence the practice of preventive behaviors [23], [40]. Lastly, the measurement of the target SARS preventive behavior was crude and without any contextual information.
