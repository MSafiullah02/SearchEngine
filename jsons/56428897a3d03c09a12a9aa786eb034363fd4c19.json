The term pneumonia covers several distinct clinical entities, and correct classifi cation is vital as the aetiology, infective organism, antibiotic management and outcome are determined by how and where pneumonia was contracted. Early recognition and appropriate treatment improve outcome. Critical care physicians must be familiar with all aspects of pneumonia, as they will be expected to advise on and manage severe community-acquired pneumonia (CAP), hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) and opportunistic pneumonias in immunocompromised patients in the wards, high dependency units (HDUs) and intensive care units (ICUs).

However, aggressive or resistant pathogens (e.g. P. aeruginosa, S. Aureus) may require treatment for 14-21 days, which improves subsequent survival. Overuse of antibiotics is avoided by tailoring antibiotic therapy to the results of lower respiratory tract cultures, withdrawing unnecessary antibiotics and shortening duration of therapy to the minimum effective period.
