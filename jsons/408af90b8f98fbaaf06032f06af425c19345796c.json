To the best of our knowledge, there is no previous report about an association of Toxocara infection with suicide attempts. Therefore, we sought to determine whether Toxocara exposure is associated with suicide attempts in psychiatric patients. We studied 282 psychiatric outpatients (156 with suicide attempts and 126 without suicide attempts). Sera of patients were analyzed for the presence of anti-Toxocara IgG antibodies by using a commercially available enzyme immunoassay. One of the 156 (0.6%) suicide attempters and 1 (0.8%) of the 126 controls were positive for anti-Toxocara IgG antibodies (OR = 0.80; 95% CI: 0.04-13.02; = 1.00). Toxocara seropositivity was significantly higher ( = 0.01) in male patients with consumption of raw dried goat meat than male patients without this consumption. Results suggest that Toxocara exposure is not associated with suicide attempts in psychiatric outpatients in Durango City, Mexico. However, further studies with larger samples sizes to confirm our results should be conducted. Too few patients were seropositive to assess further associations of Toxocara exposure with sociodemographic, clinical, and behavioral characteristics of the psychiatric patients.",

Infection with Toxocara is one of the most widespread zoonotic parasitic infections [4] and causes a disease known as toxocariasis [4] . The burden of toxocariasis in North America is significant [6] ; however, toxocariasis is recognized as a neglected zoonotic disease [6, 7] . The seroprevalence of Toxocara infection varies substantially among population groups, that is, 2%-5% in adults in urban areas, 14.2%-37% in rural areas, and 63.2%-92.8% in some tropical countries [8] . Toxocara does not mature in the human intestines but instead migrates through tissues and organs of the body [1] .",

Visceral toxocariasis is commonly associated with liver and pulmonary damage [6] . Less commonly, toxocariasis may manifest with pericardial effusion or myocarditis [6] . Toxocara may invade the brains of humans [11] ; however, neurotoxocariasis or cerebral toxocariasis remains a poorly understood phenomenon [1] . Toxocara infection may lead to eosinophilic meningitis [6] , meningoencephalitis, myelitis, cerebral vasculitis, optic neuritis [12] , epilepsy [13] , and multiple cerebral infarction [14] . In addition, toxocariasis has been associated with dementia [11, 15, 16] and mental confusion [17] . A high seroprevalence of Toxocara infection has been found in psychiatric patients [18] [19] [20] . In a study in Italy, researchers found a 13% seroprevalence of Toxocara infection in psychiatric patients [18] . In a recent study in Mexico, 4.7% of 128 psychiatric inpatients were seropositive for Toxocara infection [19] , whereas, in a study in China, a 16.4% seroprevalence of Toxocara infection in psychiatric patients was found [20] .",

Migration of Toxocara to brain does not frequently induce a recognizable neurological syndrome [16] . Toxocara infection was associated with depression in a 65-year-old woman confirmed with psychometric tests [15] . Brain involvement during Toxocara infection may lead to disease and possibly to changes in behavior. Therefore, the present study aimed to determine whether Toxocara exposure was associated with suicide attempts in psychiatric patients. We found a low prevalence of Toxocara exposure among psychiatric outpatients, and Toxocara seropositivity was not associated with suicide attempts. In a previous study in psychiatric patients, a 4.7% seroprevalence of Toxocara exposure was found [19] . The lower prevalence found in the present study than that previously reported in psychiatric patients can be explained by differences in the characteristics of the patients; that is, we studied outpatients, whereas in the previous study only inpatients were examined [19] . Results of the present study suggest that Toxocara exposure did not represent a risk for suicide attempts in the psychiatric patients studied. However, this is the first study of its kind and results should be confirmed. Other population groups including inpatients and people living in high seroprevalence places (rural areas, tropical countries) with larger sample sizes should be studied.",

We found that consumption of raw dried goat meat was associated with Toxocara exposure. This behavioral characteristic was the only variable associated with Toxocara exposure. However, the very low seroprevalence of Toxocara infection found among psychiatric patients did not allow us to obtain further statistically significant associations. Remarkably, consumption of goat meat was previously associated with Toxocara exposure in psychiatric inpatients in Durango City [19] . The fact that consumption of goat meat was associated with Toxocara exposure in two independent studies points towards the importance of this factor for the transmission of Toxocara infection to humans. In the present study, we examined new cases and a larger sample size ( = 282) of psychiatric patients than those ( = 128) included in the previous study [19] . In the present study, an association of Toxocara exposure with the consumption of raw dried meat from goat was found. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of an association of consumption of raw \"dried\" goat meat with Toxocara exposure. In a recent study, a clinical case of a 51-year-old man with lower motor neuron disease was linked to consumption of raw goat meat [28] . Toxocara infections in goats have been poorly studied. We found only one seroprevalence report in goats. A 10.1% seroprevalence of anti-Toxocara antibodies was found in goats in Thessaly, Greece [29] . Further studies about Toxocara infection in goats are needed.",
