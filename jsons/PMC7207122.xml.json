On the other hand, smart applications are being used extensively for controlling appliances and interconnected devices such as surveillance cameras, lights, access control, heating systems, and so on (Albino, Berardi, & Dangelico, 2015; Hilty et al., 2015; Min-Allah, Qureshi, Alrashed, & Rana, 2019). IoT based solutions are considered the backbone of any smart infrastructure (Ahmed, Ahmad, Piccialli, Sangaiah, & Jeon, 2018). Such smart solutions efficiently mobilize and use the needed resources for improving the quality of life of residents, decreasing pressure on the environment, encouraging innovation, and fostering a well-developed local community. The integration of Internet of Things (IoT) and smart phones have revolutionized the industry where more and more solutions are being developed aiming user convenience. Amazon's Alexa, Apple's Siri, and Google's Assistant are a few examples that facilitate the smart living with great comfort and ease. Today, IoT, big data, and artificial intelligence provides the foundation for smart livings and cities.",

KSA emphasized on the need of quality life and smart infrastructure in the Vision 2030 for the country (Kingdom of Saudi Arabia-Vision 2020) and has prepared the plans for the construction of a smart city project called NEOM (Saudi Arabia\u2019s Neom: Oasis or Sand Castle, 2017) which is backed by US$ 500 billion from Saudi Arabia\u2019s public investment fund and a range of international investors (Saudi Arabia\u2019s new city, 2017). In cities like Singapore (Singapore best performing smart city globally: Study, 2019), Dubai (Smart Dubai, 2020), Milton Keynes (Southampton City Council, 2019), Southampton (Southampton City Council, 2019), Amsterdam (Amsterdam Smart City, 2019), Barcelona (Ajuntament de Barcelona, 2019), Madrid (Ayuntamiento de Madrid, 2016), Stockholm (City of Stockholm, 2019), and in many cities of China (ZTE, 2019), the concept of smart cities have been implemented since long while more and more features are being added with passage of time (Wikipedia, 2019). The essence of a smart city also highlights challenges such as interoperability, security, and existence of non-standard data formats (The planning manual for building tomorrow\u2019s cities today, 2019b). Various solutions have been proposed in literature to overcome these issues and even cities are now cooperating with each other to address such problems. For instance, seven US cities namely New York City, Los Angeles, Chicago, Boston, Philadelphia, San Francisco, and Seattle undertook the initiative for creating database for standardized open data applications (The planning manual for building tomorrow\u2019s cities today, 2019b).",

Furthermore, the smart city concept can be applied to a smart community lab where citizens (and companies) are engaged and collaborate with the city to identify and solve problems, accelerate the innovation, and generate services created for and by the citizens (Bosch et al., 2019). The role of IoT is of great interest to smart cities. Gartner Inc (Egham, 2019) forecasts a 21% increase in IoT market for 2020 as compared to 2019 as there would be 5.8 billion IoT devices by end of 2020. On the other hand, smart cameras integrated with artificial intelligence techniques play a huge role in the surveillance systems. A BBC report estimates that for every 30 people on average, there exists one surveillance camera (Harford, 2019). The United Nations partnerships platform for sustainable development (United Smart Cities (USC) (2019)) has developed a partnership with stakeholders for promoting exchange of best practices and knowledge transfer on sustainable urban development and the concept of smart city is no exception.",

Many issues are yet to be addresses for making a true smart campus. For instance, comprehensive interoperability standards are lacking at present to integrate various devices (The planning manual for building tomorrow\u2019s cities today, 2019a). Similarly, with campuses, thousands of IoT devise will be installed and hence manual operations are not recommended (Alwaer & Clements-Croome, 2010). Therefore, automated configuration of IoT devices would be preferred. Understandably, the benefits associated with smart infrastructure come with risks and challenges and varies from region to region.

Based on current research, smart projects in actions, brainstorming session, and industry support, we highlight the essential features of a smart campus in this work. The main components of our model include physical infrastructure, integration of smart technology with smart grid, analysis on the data collected, and offering services based on the data. It is worth mentioning to differentiate between smart and intelligent systems which is being used interchangeable in literature. A smart system is not necessary an intelligent system. We highlight a list of essential initiatives that we understand can assist the management of any academic institutions in making their campus smart. Since the smart campus concept is mainly focused on infrastructure development, we divide the task into highest, medium, and low priority. We extend our resource allocation approach (Min-Allah et al., 2019) to smart campuses domain and highlight corresponding solutions from the industry that can fully or partial assist in completing such projects. We understand this work bridges the gap between theoretical models and practical systems and has the potential to be implemented for creating a smart campus. The number of potential initiatives pertaining smart campus are countless, however it is entirely fine to begin with a few initiatives as per an institution\u2019s needs. For instance, for campuses located in dry regions with very little rain and high temperature, harvesting solar energy is more appealing than creating infrastructure for collecting and storing rainwater. For larger universities, it might be a priority to start with generic projects such as smart grid which could be a distinguished feature of any smart campus.",

Initially, cell phones were known as smart-phones and consequently any device that was controlled through smart phone was called as smart device. For instance, smart lights, smart toasters, smart washing machines and coffee maker, smart locks, smart shoes, heating, music, and so on. The concept of smart city can be implemented on various levels ranging from a single building to town to even a region (SCOPE, 2007). In educational context, smart classrooms, smart stadiums, e-wallet, and smart parking are a few examples. In universities, today students bring several devices to campus, connecting to the network and generate huge data that can be used for offering improved services by the university management. A detailed discussion and definitions of smart grid technologies is prepared by The United States Department of Energy (DOE) (United States Department of Energy, 2019). A microgrid is considered a small-scale electrical system powered with renewable energy resources that can operate either in a connected or a disconnected mode to/from the main grid (Talei et al., 2017).",

Authors in (Hern\u00e1ndez-Rojas et al., 2018) noticed that the data is often siloed and isolated, and analysis and decision-making is normally based on a single dataset. An extensive research was made in (Muhamad et al., 2017) from the perspective of smart campuses where authors concluded that no standard understanding of a smart campus exists. Three patterns were identified in (Chuling et al., 2009a) based on the definition of smart campus i.e., (i) technology driven, (ii) based on smart city concepts, and (iii) business process driven initiatives. Many companies are offering solutions under smart cities umbrella such as GE, Intel, AT&T, Microsoft, Amazon, Honeywell, IBM, Google, Cisco, Dell, Ericsson, Qualcomm, Huawei, Verizon, CommScope Inc, and Schneider Electric etc (Smart Cities Market: Technologies, 2019).

Literature shows the concept of smart city has become a recent trend where the core areas of smart city include government, academia, and industry (The smart city model, 2019; The planning manual for building tomorrow\u2019s cities today, 2019b). Many applications have been developed ranging from health-care services to goods delivery to surveillances (Khan et al., 2017; Qureshi, Din, Jeon, & Piccialli, 2020; Rathore, Son, Ahmad, Paul, & Jeon, 2018; Shi, Wu, Anisetti, Damiani, & Jeon, 2020; Smart City Governments, 2019; Symanovich, 2019). For instance, half of all-American adults have their images stored in one or more facial-recognition databases, while FBI has had access to 412 million facial images for searches purposes and Facebook can recognize faces with 98 percent accuracy (Symanovich, 2019). Facial recognition systems are being used extensively in airports, security gates, mobile phones, classroom, and so forth. However, the facial recognition systems are not 100% accurate and largely depends factors such as camera angle, lighting, outfits, hairstyles, wearing or not wearing glasses etc.",

Ubiquitous computing, VPN, and IoT devices further enhanced the concept of smart campus. The technologies identified for smart campus include RFID, IoT, cloud computing, 3D visualization technology (augmented reality), sensor technology(motion, temperature, light, humidity), mobile technology (include NFC, QR code, GPS), and web service (Chuling, Xie, & Peng, 2009). Various technologies exit for connecting IoT devices such as Bluetooth, LoRa, SigFox, Wi-Fi, Zigbee, 4GLTe, and so forth with different power consumption requirements and data rates. Some of the technologies provide higher data rates than others but consume more power while others may offer longer connectivity range. For instance, both WiFi and SigFox's power consumption is almost the same, hoverer SigFox offers better coverage i.e., connects devices within 3\u20135 K m range through a single base-station (Sigfox, 2019). Recently, authors in (Fern\u00e1ndez-Caram\u00e9s & Fraga-Lamas, 2019a) provided a comprehensive study on communication technologies for the smart campus from communication perspectives and discussed the need for long-distance communication. For the data exchanges among various entities, the merits and demerits of blockchain were highlighted in Li-Shing, Jui-Yuan, and Tsang-Long (2019). In the context of smart campus, IoT devices are expected to be installed at building, stadiums, parks, streets, and so forth. In such applications the power consumption and range play critical role. These devices normally produce data in kilo bytes but the cumulative volume of data could be massive. The generic concept of data analytics is also applicable in the context of smart campus (The planning manual for building tomorrow\u2019s cities today, 2019b) and we integrate this work in our proposed model of smart campus.",

For instance, Adamk\u00b4o & Koll\u00b4ar (2014) introduced central intelligence layer for providing service at application level based. In Bosch et al. (2019), services such as socializing, moving around, sharing events, signaling problems, were developed. These services were categorized into three domains: Practical life, Academic life and Social life in (Kwok, 2015). University of Twente (The Univ of twente.nl, 2020) developed a system to point out existing problems, submit maintenance requests and monitor the repair progresses. Microsoft has a similar solution that points out the location for the maintenance place after receiving the request. The system knows the locations of sensors/devices and user is not bothered to provide such details. Similarly, Saint Louis University has installed 2300 Echo Dots with their application \"SLU\" to provide information about the campus news and activities. Birmingham City University in (Saint Louis University, 2020) shared the experience of interwoven intelligence into campuses for improving business-processes, reducing energy consumptions, enhancing the occupant experience and reducing carbon emissions. The works (Adamk\u00b4o & Koll\u00b4ar, 2014; Saint Louis University, 2020) have discussed smart campus in parts as the focus was on improving one or more aspects of smart campus but the need for establishing a generic model for smart campus still exists. A smart campus should be aligned with the concepts of smart city as a university campus in many ways is like a small-scale city.",

Some universities have already created digital campuses with many applications in place (Peoplesoft (Oracle, 2019), Blackboard (Behind the Blackboard, 2018) etc.) that need to be integrated with IoT and other devices to realize the benefits of smart campus. Intelligent campuses are deigned based on technologies such as RFID, IoT, etc. to support teaching and research process of a university such as LMS, attendance, payments, and personalized learning. The study made in Musa (2016) pointed out that existing smart campus application can be divided various level ranging from personalized learning to waste management. In addition, smart campus also assists university management in offering improved services to the community through data analytics while improving supporting business processes that include smart building, environment, social interaction, and so forth. On software level, to support such services data science and deep learning are applicable for analysis and training purposes in cluster/fog/cloud computing environment. On campus leve both high- and low-end devices generate data. For smooth operation of these devices, operating system is also of interest. For low-end devices, popular operating systems are Contiki, Tiny, RIOT, Lite, FreeRT, Apache MYnewt, and ARM Mbed Oss. While for high-end devices the known operating systems are uClinux, Raspbian, and Android Things.",

The bi-directional communication with IoT based solutions reflects the reporting of live data on the dashboard and hence assist the managers in running operations of the campus smoothly. In addition, the grid provides an insight to the energy usage pattern of the campus. The role of smart grid is so critical that some authors believe that smart grid is a smart campus (Talei et al., 2017). It can be seen in Fig. 2 that the smart microgrid integrates power generation and delivery services. The campus is normally low voltage distribution system and offer more opportunities for energy savings. Majority of the devices in a campus are emended and capable of running at various speed as per the load. This situation allows the system to adopt to the load and lower the processors speed at run time when the workload is low and switched off/sleep the unused/unnecessary parts of the system. A closed loop control system facilitates such provisions through microgrid. In Fig. 2, the solid lines show the communication channels where the connection is strong while the dashed lines reflects that the sub-domain are overlapped and can contribute in many aspects. For instance, solar energy assist in making the system which is adaptive to climate changes. It is worth noting that IoT-enabled services constantly communicate with smart grid and exchange data such as power generated in a smart parking and its usage to power lights and other devices installed in the parking lot. Many of the smart infrastructure such as smart parking can harvest solar energy in daytime for equipment\u2019s installed in premises and can storage the additional energy to be used at night. Through smart metering systems, smart infrastructure remains in continuous communication with smart grid dashboard that collects such statistics and distribute energy accordingly. With smart campus, all these sub-domains also update the main grid about energy usage and by using artificial intelligence, we can forecast the future demands. With availability of enormous data, we can analyze the available data through deep learning for making more accurate predictions. Various products exist for minoring the carbon emissions. For instance, Everimpact (2020) is used for smart monitoring and monetizing carbon emissions in cities. It can also be seen in Fig. 2 that monitoring \u201cnoise level\u201d does not explicitly benefits from the microgrid but implicitly provides statistics to the dashboard to measure the campus resilience to climate changes. The noise level on campus is being monitored and alerts should be issued when the noise level exceeds a threshold level i.e., noise in one classroom can impact the lecture in another adjacent lecture room. In addition, it can be linked to campus in case of any potential mishap etc. For instance, the system should be able to issue immediate alert to inhabitants when smoke is detected, or any other abnormal situation is encountered. It is worth mentioning that smart microgrid directly facilitate the realization of smart campus from resource utilization, movement, energy savings, informed decision, improved services, and risk mitigations perspectives and a number of projects can be initiated under the umbrella of a smart campus. Majority of the sub-themes show in Fig. 2 such as efficient recycling, better waste management, and increase in renewable energy facilitates in chalking out environmental sustainability policies of university campus. For big campuses, we encourage creating a smart microgrid that make efficient use of available energy resources and forecasting energy demands based on historical data by employing artificial intelligence and deep learning techniques.",

Fig. 3 highlights the major services that can be enhanced through realization of smart campus. Enormous projects such as enabling safe e-transaction/e-payment/cashless/e-wallet system through smart cards on campus has becomes a distinguished feature of campuses these days. With rapid innovations, even smart card is becoming obsolete and some campuses have started using services based on face recognition systems. The support for live audio translation in conference rooms/theaters is another example of smart services. Similarly, live data can be fed to the dashboard for making informed decisions. Counting people in-out not only helps in determining classrooms/theatres usages but can also help in emergency situations i.e., know the number of people inside a particular room in case of fire/earthquake etc. Social interactions and networking applications can be fed through appropriate data generated on campus. The main objective of a university campus is providing quality education and facilitating the teaching and learning, so it should be a priority for any campus to have smart and reliable solutions for enhancing teaching and learning in first place. The teaching and learning tools can by combined with physical infrastructure for offering improved services. For instance, attendance system can read data from the classroom smart cameras and mark a student present when recognized by the camera installed in the classroom. Similarity, reports can be generated for the teacher regarding student\u2019s engagement in the class and so forth. All these steps help in saving teacher\u2019s time that can be used for teaching and achieving course learning outcomes.",

For protecting privacy of the campus community, blackchin based approaches can be exploited as such techniques are getting popularity in the context of smart cities and campuses. All the sub-themes identified in Fig. 3 are essential components of a well-rounded education system and statistics obtained through smart campus initiative can assist the management in strategic planning as well. The transport related services issue alerts to students/employees about shuttle services timings and updates, in addition to providing statics about bus usages and peak times. Similarity, any change in the daily schedule of the student's activities can be delivered to student's cell phones and the screens placed cross the campus in timely fashion. Smart mobility is one of the main features of smart campus and hence data generated from car sharing, campus vehicles or other transportation systems can be used for resource allocation and smooth traffic flow etc. Various services can be constructed from Fig. 3 such as paying utilities bills and delivery of food or medicine. Social interactions among stakeholders is also covered under this theme in physical and cyber space.

A clear view of resource usages can assist the campus management in scheduling resource allocation for improved utilization. In Fig. 4, many of the sub-themes might be of the interest to local government and stakeholders i.e., transparency. Similarly, reports will be sent to the parents about students\u2019 attendance and performance in class etc. The framework also connects the campus system with city government and public offices. IoT devices can be used to monitor stress level of campus inhabitants as well. The air quality can be monitored on campus and even predictive systems can be built to issue alert when abnormal situations are detected.

The intention of smart campus model is to propose a model that can easily integrated with city government with no/or minimum changes. Adequate security protocols and encryption mechanisms must be in place in a smart campus. Replication and scalability of the model should be done easily with no or minimum deployment costs. Since many of smart campus initiatives can be directly mimicked at city level, the ease of deployment at such level is a must for these projects under smart campus model. While replicating the campus model at other places such as town, city, or another campus, the privacy of users must be respected. Also, the cost of deployment of the smart initiatives should be simple to understand and calculate. Off course, the cost associated with hardware and software licensing will increase when replicated at a wider scale but an insight of potential cost involved would be needed for arranging finances to construct smart projects at city level.

Table 2 is generated through brainstorming sessions, studying ranking systems, availability of relevant technologies to support the initiatives, smart cities literature, and expectations of the community from a university campus. The number and types of initiative are countless under smart campus umbrella. For a smart classroom, face recognition technology can be used for marking student\u2019s attendance and monitoring student\u2019s behavior. Similarly, noise level can be monitored in a classroom to avoid distracting lectures in progress in nearby classrooms. Even there exists an opportunity to enhance the washroom management system using latest technologies that can issue alert relevant when no activity is monitored when a person is inside for 30 min or so. The list for justifications of these initiatives can be a lengthy one but due to space limitations, we only highlight the major goals where these initiatives can contribute significantly. We align these initiatives with the main themes of smart campus. Justification for the corresponding initiatives are also provided. Each initiative can become an independent project with specific milestones, key performance indicators, and subprojects but for convenience we highlight the initiatives at higher level. In Table 2, initiatives have been justified based on associated benefits against 5 domains (resource utilization, energy savings, informed decision, improved services, and risk mitigation), however, the mapping is flexible and may vary from institution to institution as the boundaries among them hardly exist. For example, the initiative \u201cpeople counting (in-out in classroom/building)\u201d directly contributes to the informed decision but at the same time, this initiative available energy resources and forecasting can help in reducing energy consumption by counting the number of people in the room/building.

It is suggested that initiatives list can be prioritized based on the university needs and strategic objectives. It is more appropriate to start with initiatives where the infrastructure already exists instead of initiatives that needs to develop everything from scratch. In the former case, the additional cost would be due to the integration of smart technologies in the available infrastructure. There also exist situations where upgrading an existing infrastructure might need significant budge, time and resources. Considering such points, we understand prioritizing the initiatives for a smart campus is a subjective term and it totally depends on the institution\u2019s strategy and long terms goals. A generic priority order is shown in Table 3, where initiatives are divided into high, medium, and low priority. It is worth mentioning that we provide only generic model, where the priority order and cost are relative terms and depends on the location and resources of a campus. Similarly, in Table 3, \u2717 is used for lacking, 0 shows availability, while P stands for particle support of hardware/software by the industry at present. Partial intelligence means there exists some intelligence which is due to a set of hard coded rules and no learning is involved. With advancement of technology and with availability of data, devices will become more intelligent and will learn as time progresses. At present, majority of the devices only obey hard coded commands based on various conditions. These devices just follow a predefined set of instructions where intelligence is lacking in majority of smart devices and hence it is recommended to incorporate artificial intelligence-based solutions where possible that can exploit the creation of big data for making such devices more intelligent. There is also a dire need for using artificial intelligence and deep learning techniques for harvesting the data generated on university campus for improved services. In addition, the nature of the projects identified for the smart campus varies and to the best of our knowledge, no single hardware vendor at present can assist a smart campus in implementing all these projects. Considering these issue, compatibility of hardware should be evaluated before arranging hardware from a specific vendor for a project under smart campus umbrella to avoid any potentials issues that may arise during integrations of such initiatives at campus level. Not all current solutions are intelligent and hence we can divide the projects into non-smart, smart, and intelligent categories.

Mapping between a smart city and smart campus was made and a list of potential initiatives were identified. It was observed that at present no single vendor can develop all projects under smart campus umbrella and hence devices and protocol might not be compatible. Associated challenges suggested the need for a global organization to set the standards and unify the efforts made in connection to smart campus such as IEEE smart cities community. It was concluded that to attract investments for the projects and encourage potential investors, small scale projects with clear business returns should be given high priority. It was noted that there exists a promising potential for energy savings, conveniences, and cost reduction through exploitation of data generation on campus using artificial intelligence techniques. As a future work, it will be interesting to develop a list of key performance indicators to evaluate the smartness of campus infrastructure and/or conduct a case study.",
