First, the immediate threat exists from increasingly severe weather events and second, the long-term threat to global ecosystems occurs as the planet warms. The international community has recognized this threat and through the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) has tried to develop solutions. Progress, however, has been agonizingly slow. Initially the main thrust of the work of the Convention was to deal with the long-term threat by focusing on reducing greenhouse gas emissions. However, the vehicle devised to reduce emission rates, the Kyoto Protocol, has failed due, in part, to its architecture and effective campaigning and lobbying by climate skeptics funded through the energy sector. It is hoped that a new agreement to reduce greenhouse gas emissions will be ready for implementation in 2020. Whether the negotiators can really address the scale of change needed in the global energy system is an open question (O'Keefe et al., 2010). In the meantime, we are emitting our way into an unknown future. No indication exists as to what greenhouse gas concentration and what timetable will be agreed upon. Little chance seems to exist of us keeping the average global temperature rise below 2 \u00b0C. We are producing a dangerous and unknown future.",

Adjusting to consequences, or adaptation, was thought only to be an issue for the Less Economically Developed Countries, such as Small Island Developing States. However, the litany of extreme weather events across the globe has rapidly raised adaptation up the agenda. A recent report by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC, 2014) paints a very bleak picture of what the world we are creating could look like: increased floods and droughts and more severe weather events that will threaten food security. Adaptation is now an issue for all nations. The problem is that if we do exceed the 2 \u00b0C temperature rise, then we enter an era that is termed dangerous climate change. Stay below that temperature rise and we should be able to adapt. Go above that temperature, and we could be exposed to irreversible changes and the collapse of ecosystems to which we would be unable to adapt (O'Brien and O'Keefe, 2014).",

In the interim, we need to use our ingenuity to adapt to the consequences. The UNFCCC has been in place for some 30 years. To date, little real progress has been made and this does not augur well for the negotiations up to 2020. Reducing greenhouse gas emission appears, on the face of it, relatively straightforward. Much of the technology needed to both use energy efficiently and produce it cleanly is available. The problem lies in the lack of political will to opt for solutions rather than being market based. In many cases, we are \u201clocked into\u201d a number of technologies, for example, the United States seems to have opted strongly for fracking. Though gas is cleaner than coal, the investment decisions made today are likely to be in place for 40\u201350 years. We are getting to grips with renewable technologies and their use, in the main, of low-density, variable primary energy sources, such as wind and solar. But a gargantuan effort on production and deployment will be needed in order to produce significant energy from renewable resources (O'Keefe et al., 2010). Ultimately, it is up to our political leaders to agree to a stabilization target and timetable. Energy planners can then get to work on planning the replacement of high carbon-emitting technologies with low ones. This may mean scrapping some systems before their due date. We must be brave enough to do that!",

But, as Stern (2007) pointed out, it is more cost-effective to address the problems now rather than deal with the consequences in the future. Progress on adaptation is being made and despite the huge uncertainties it is possible that we can develop sustainable approaches to this multifaceted challenge (O'Brien and O'Keefe, 2014). Recognition has been occurring between the climate and disaster management communities of the overlap of disaster risk reduction and climate change adaptation techniques. This does raise the question of whether or not we have the right institutional arrangements. Adaptation is about people and their livelihoods and protecting them from climate risks. This is the role of the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP). Reducing risk is the role of the United Nations International Strategy for Disaster Reduction. Promoting ecological well-being is the role of the United Nations Environment Programme. We could frame all of this with a Convention on Climate Adaptation that could still be linked with the IPCC. We could then streamline the institutional structures and have lines directly to the national, subnational, and local levels. This new body would have sovereign institutional responsibility for developing adaptation within a framework of human and ecological well-being (O'Brien et al., 2012).",

            "text": "The final issue to address is funding. Changing the energy system and developing adaptation measures will not come cheap. The UNFCCC has agreed a Green Climate Fund that will have funding of US$ 100 billion per year from 2020 for both mitigation and adaptation. But as O'Brien and O'Keefe (2014) have pointed out, the International Energy Agency estimate that moving to low-carbon energy could require some US$ 10.5 trillion by 2030 and that adaptation costs by various organizations such as the World Bank, UNFCCC, Oxfam, and UNDP range between US$50 billion and US$171 billion per year. The Green Climate Fund is unlikely to meet all needs. Many of the wealthier nations will need to dig deeper. Perhaps we could put some of the US$1.7 trillion per year we spend on the military to better use. All funding mechanisms involve privatizing the commons and commodifying the global atmospheric system through trading emission levels. Is that really the way to go?",
