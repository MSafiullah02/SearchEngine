To date, all Ads display a characteristic, icosahedral symmetry in which 240 subunits of the trimeric hexon protein form the facets and 12 copies of the penton, comprising the pentameric penton base protein and the externally projecting trimeric fiber, form the vertices [1]. While the stoichiometry of the penton base and hexon is apparently conserved, the fiber can exist as a single or double copy at each vertex [2]. At least in vitro and for most cell types, the fiber mediates the initial attachment to primary receptors, such as the D1 domain of the coxsackievirus and adenovirus receptor (CAR), sialic acids, CD46, and others (for review see Zhang & Bergelson [3]). Interaction with auxiliary receptor(s), in particular some of the dimeric integrins via the Arg-Gly-Asp sequence (an integrin-interacting motif) on the penton base, may induce internalization of some serotypes. However, other auxiliary receptors or mechanism of internalization may exist for human serotypes 40 and 41 (HAd40/41), and canine serotype 2 (CAV-2), which have no identifiable integrin-interacting motif in the penton base [4],[5].",

Approximately 50 of these are currently classed as human pathogens that, in most cases, generate subclinical ocular, respiratory and gastrointestinal tract infections. In the immunocompromised host however, lethal HAd infections can spread, via unknown mechanisms, to the kidney, liver and brain [6],[7]. The human Ads (HAds) are divided into subgroups (or species or subgenera) A - F. The triage of the human serotypes into subgroups is based in part on serotype-specific ex vivo erythrocyte cross-linking (or hemagglutination) [8]. The clinical hemagglutination assays use lysates from virus-infected cells to crosslink erythrocytes from a handful of species. This highly heterogeneous lysate contains whole virus particles, empty capsids, penton monomers, penton dodecahedrons, fiber monomers, hexon etc. By using fractionated infected cell lysate, a handful of laboratories found that the multivalent complexes containing fiber were responsible for hemagglutination [9]\u2013[12].",

With its high sialic acid content, glycophorin A is the main contributor to the net negative cell-surface charge and is critical for minimizing cell\u2013cell interactions and preventing erythrocyte aggregation [13]. Sialic acid is a collective term for a family of 9-carbon monosaccharides, which are often found as terminal sugar residues on glycans of glycoproteins and glycolipids (usually \u03b12-3, -6 or -8 linked). In addition to some HAds, a number of viruses, including orthomyxoviruses, paramyxoviruses, picornaviruses, papovaviruses, coronaviruses, reoviruses and parvoviruses bind to sialic acids [14]\u2013[18]. Possibly because erythrocytes from different species vary in their sialic acid content, the hemagglutination properties of sialic acid-binding viruses may also diverge [19].",

Among the HAds, serotype 37 is unusual: its fiber head can bind CAR, CD46 and sialic acid, but the virus appears to use only the latter two as functional receptors [24]\u2013[26]. Burmeister et al. found that the sialic acid moiety bound to a basic patch close to the center of the trimeric fiber heads of HAd37 and HAd19p [27]. Interestingly, the putative hemagglutination domain in subgroup D heads partially aligns with the sialyl-lactose binding site, which on the basis of sequence alignments is likely to be conserved in other members of this subgroup. These observations raise the question as to whether Ad-erythrocyte interaction is a consequence of fiber head-sialic acid interaction.",

Although both HAd37 and CAV-2 agglutinate human erythrocytes at low particle-to-cell ratios, they use different receptors (sialic acid and CD46 vs. CAR) [5],[25],[26], have different clinical tropisms (ocular vs. respiratory tract) and infect different species. We found that HAd37-erythrocyte interaction is primarily due to sialic acid binding. We show by structural analysis that the CAV-2 fiber head also contains a sialic acid binding site, but in contrast to HAd37 this site is modestly involved in hemagglutination. Unexpectedly, our biochemical and competition analyses suggested that CAV-2-erythrocyte interactions also depend on binding to CAR on human and rat erythrocytes. Using a transgenic mouse that expresses CAR on erythrocytes [28] we demonstrate that CAR-binding Ads can be sequestered by CAR-expressing erythrocytes, and prevent liver infection. Our study provides a molecular and structural rationale for the 50-year-old enigma of ex vivo Ad-erythrocyte interactions. In addition to the relevance for Ad pathogenesis and vector biology, the expression of CAR by human erythrocytes may shed light on the role of cell adhesion molecules during erythropoiesis.",

When compared to HAd37, CAV-2 hemagglutinates at \u223c20-fold lower ratio (i.e. more efficiently, Figure 1B). In our hands, and consistent with others [29], HAd5 also agglutinated human erythrocytes, but at a higher ratio (>800 pp/erythrocyte) (Figure 1C). To assay the roles of HAd37 and CAV-2 capsid proteins, we incubated erythrocytes with chimeric HAd5 vectors harboring the fiber from HAd37 [30] or the fiber head from CAV-2 [31]. We found that the HAd5-HAd37F and HAd5-CAV-2H hybrid capsids induced agglutination at lower ratios than HAd5 but not quite to those of HAd37 and CAV-2 (Figure 1D and E). Pre-incubating erythrocytes with neuraminidase, which removes sialic acid from their membranes, eliminated agglutination by HAd37 and a HAd5-HAd37F hybrid capsid (Figure 1, right hand column). In contrast, removing sialic acid from erythrocyte membranes only modestly reduced CAV-2 and the hybrid HAd5-CAV-2H agglutination (data summarized in Table 1).",

The dodecahedra containing a HAd37 fiber with a Lys to Glu mutation at amino acid 345 in the sialic acid binding site (HAd37HSA\u22121), had at least a 105-fold reduced hemagglutination activity compared to the dodecahedra containing HAd37Hwt.

For example, each of the 12 homotrimeric fiber heads on the end of the flexible CAV-2 shaft [32] could bind three sialic acid moieties (theoretically up to 36/capsid). Because the predicted subgroup D fiber head hemagglutination domains (in the CD and GH loops) appear to be well conserved, we tried to identify the corresponding domain in the CAV-2 fiber head using a mutagenesis strategy based on sequence homology (Figure S3).

The electron density maps showed clear density for six N-acetyl neuraminic acid (Neu5AC) moieties in the asymmetric unit, three per fiber head trimer. Sialyl-lactose is composed of three sugar rings, the sialic acid moiety being linked to lactose (galactose-glucose). The density for the lactose moieties was weak, implying that these are flexible within the crystal. Only one of the six galactose rings in the asymmetric unit could be modeled. This molecule is located in between the two fiber head trimers in the asymmetric unit and forms a distant hydrogen bond (distance 3.25 \u00c5) to Lys503 via the galactose oxygen 6. It is unlikely that this interaction is enough to immobilize the galactose ring because the other five galactose moieties in the asymmetric unit are not equally well visible in the electron density. More likely, the stabilization is due to the spatial restrictions imposed by the proximity of the other fiber head trimer.",

The residues involved in binding (Asn435, Ser419, Ser416, Gln417 and Arg515) do not align with those involved in sialic acid-binding by HAd37 fiber head (Figure S2). The HAd37 sialic acid binding site consists of three residues forming hydrogen bonds (Tyr213, Pro317 and Lys345) and two residues contacting sialic acid in hydrophobic interactions (Tyr308 and Val322) (Figure 3E). All seven interactions between CAV-2 fiber head and sialic acid are hydrogen bonds or salt bridges (Figure 3F), suggesting a relatively strong interaction compared to HAd37. Unlike HAd37 fiber head [33], no hydrophobic contacts contribute to sialic acid binding. Finally, sialic acid binds within a basic patch in each head (Figure 3C and D).",

To determine if sialic acid and CAR binding were mutually exclusive, we soaked CAV-2 or HAd37 fiber head crystals in complex with CAR in solutions containing sialyl-D-lactose.

Using mock-treated erythrocytes (Figure 4), we found that at physiological salt concentrations \u223c80% of CAVGFP was removed from the supernatant, while at higher salt concentration (300 mM NaCl) \u223c60% of CAVGFP was removed. When using neuraminidase-treated erythrocytes, we again found that CAVGFP was efficiently removed from the supernatant. All the test samples were significantly (P<0.01) different from the control, as well as from the mock-treated 150 mM NaCl (P<0.05).

Erythrocytes from some species express cell adhesion molecules during the early stages of differentiation that are thought to be involved in interaction with macrophages. We therefore incubated erythrocytes with anti-CAR antibodies that recognize the extracellular domain of CAR and assayed expression using flow cytometry. We found low, but reproducible, CAR expression on the cell surface of human erythrocytes (Figure 6A). To assay CAR expression using another approach, we used western blot analysis to screen erythrocytes from several species. Using an anti-CAR Ab that recognizes the cytoplasmic domain of CAR we found CAR expression on human and rat, but not on mouse, dog, rabbit and nonhuman primate erythrocytes (Figure 6B and data not shown). Again, our results showed a relatively low level of CAR on human erythrocytes, which is consistent with the low level of CAV-2Hwt binding to erythrocytes (Figure 2B).",

In a number of conditions and approaches we showed that hemagglutination by HAd37 depends primarily on sialic acid binding. First, removing sialic acids from erythrocytes with neuraminidase eliminated erythrocyte cross-linking by HAd37 and a chimeric capsid harboring the HAd37 fiber head. Likewise, pre-incubation with neuraminidase significantly reduced hemagglutination caused by protein complexes containing multiple copies HAd37 fiber heads. Second, mutating single residues in the sialic acid binding sites reduced the hemagglutination activity of these protein complexes. Third, wild type HAd37 fiber heads bound more efficiently to erythrocytes or glycophorin than those carrying a point mutation in the sialic acid binding site. Our binding assays using wild type and mutated HAd37 heads also suggested that the sialic acid affinity is partially charge-driven. In addition, although HAd37 head also binds CAR [24], in the context of the virus it does not appear to use CAR as a receptor, possibly due to its relatively short fiber. Therefore, CAR on erythrocytes is likely to be less important for HAd37 biodistribution.",

It was possible that the affinity of CAV-2 fiber head to erythrocytes or glycophorin was lower than that of HAd37 fiber head, and that the efficient erythrocyte binding of CAV-2 depended on the avidity of multiple fibers. As the CAV-2 fiber head is less positive than HAd37 fiber head (pI's of 8.4 and 9.2 respectively), this could have explained the lower affinity. The affinity between virus proteins and sialic acid is usually in the millimolar range; therefore it was conceivable that the affinity of single CAV-2 fiber heads to erythrocytes or glycophorin was low. Consistent with this assumption, we previously found that CAV-2 is more neutrally charged than other Ads [32]. Paradoxically though, CAV-2 agglutinates at a lower particle-to-cell ratio than HAd37 and our crystallography data suggested that sialic acid binding should be at least as strong as HAd37.

Our study suggests that this may be due to i) an interaction with different chemical variants, linkages and ratios of sialic acid, ii) the presence and affinity to CAR, and/or iii) the pI's of the head [33]. For example, some non-CAR-tropic Ads that agglutinate human erythrocytes may preferentially bind Neu5AC, the most abundant sialic acid on human erythrocytes. With respect to charge, both HAd37 and HAd19p bind sialic acid with equal affinity and the only two residues that differ between their heads are not close to the sialic acid-binding site [33]. With the limited amount of data available, subgroup D HAds tend to have heads with higher pI's and interact with sialic acid [33]. Interestingly, the residues that make up the CAV-2 sialic acid binding site are conserved in the CAV-1 fiber head (data not shown), suggesting a conserved sialic acid binding function. With respect to CAR affinity, the CAV-2 fiber head binds human CAR with the highest affinity of any fiber head known [24], which may favor its efficient hemagglutination. In contrast to other Ads, higher temperatures poorly inhibit CAV-2 hemagglutination [12], again suggesting a role for the high-affinity attachment to CAR. This is also consistent with a rather large difference between HAd5 and CAV-2 hemagglutination: to the best of our knowledge the HAd5 head does not harbor a sialic acid binding site and its pI (6.25) is less basic than HAd37 or CAV-2. Finally, we cannot exclude a role of the inter- and intra-species differences in the quantity of CAR expressed by erythrocytes.",

It is possible, but unlikely, that our lack of detection of CAR on erythrocytes on some species was due to the limit of sensitivity of our bank of anti-CAR antibodies, which nonetheless detected CAR expression on other cell types from these species (not shown). In the context of the significant amount of HAd5-mediated gene transfer data, our data highlights an important parallel. While a 30-gram mouse can be injected intravenously with up to 1012 pp of an HAd5 vector with minimal side effects, injection of the same dose in a 250-gram rat is normally lethal [41].

It is paradoxical that HAd37 binds CD46, sialic acid and CAR - yet does not use CAR [25] - while CAV-2 binds both sialic acid and CAR and to the best of our knowledge uses only CAR as a receptor [5]. We cannot exclude the possibility that in some cell types sialic acid binding provides a first low-affinity attachment to the cell surface, while CAR-binding is followed in a second step, providing a high-affinity binding. Similar two-step mechanisms have been proposed for other viruses [46]. It is tempting to speculate that sialic acid binding may play a role in the preferential transduction of neurons by CAV-2 vectors [47]\u2013[50]. Our crystal structure of CAV-2 fiber head in complex with CAR and sialyl-D-lactose demonstrates that the ternary complex of the three molecules is stable.

For example, HAd5-induced liver disease in immunocompromised humans is relatively common. In contrast, immunocompromised nonhuman primates are rarely diagnosed with simian Ad (SAV)-induced liver disease [54]. Does CAR expression on erythrocytes lead to an advantage for host or virus? Has CAR expression on erythrocytes put a selective pressure on Ads (and coxsackie B viruses that also bind CAR) to avoid an erythrocyte virus trap [28]?

Interest in Ad biology is continually growing due to the increasing incidence of HAd-induced morbidity and mortality during immunosuppression [55],[56], and because Ad-derived vectors are the most commonly used vectors in gene therapy clinical trials. The identification of fiber head mutants that do not bind human erythrocytes may be of interest.

Briefly, CAVGFP and AdGFP are E1-deleted vectors expressing GFP. The capsids contain no modifications. The hybrid HAd5-CAV-2H vector contains the fiber head of CAV-2 on the HAd5 capsid. HAd5-HAd37F vector contains the HAd37 fiber (shaft and head) on the HAd5 capsid. All vectors were purified by double banding on CsCl gradients, CsCl was removed using PD-10 columns (Pharmacia). The vectors were stored in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) containing 10% glycerol at \u221280\u00b0C. Stock titers were >1\u00d71012 physical particles/ml with >1 infectious particle/5 physical particles. Anti-CAR antibodies tested in this study included E1.1 a monoclonal mouse (S.

First, DNA fragments were produced using as template HAd3 genomic DNA (for fragment 1) or pPROEX HTb vectors coding for wild type or mutant HAd37 fiber head (for fragments 2 and 3). Fragment 1 coded for HAd3 tail and shaft motives 1+2 (primers were AAT AAT CCA TGG CCA AGC GAG CTC GG and GTT CCA TGC TAC CAA GGA TCC ATC AGT AG). Fragments 2 and 3 coded for wild type and mutant (K345E) HAd37 fiber head (primers used were CTA CTG ATG GAT CCT TGG TAG CAT GGA AC and AAT AAT GAA TTC TCA TTC TTG GGC AAT ATA GG). In a second PCR reaction, fragment 1 was annealed to fragment 2 or 3 using primers AAT AAT GAA TTC TCA TTC TTG GGC AAT ATA GG and AAT AAT CCA TGG CCA AGC GAG CTC GG. The resulting longer fragments coded for complete mini-fiber containing HAd3 tail+shaft and either wild type or mutant (K345E) HAd37 fiber head. These were cloned into pPROEX HTb, and expressed at 25\u00b0C in E. coli strain BL21 Star (DE3) (Life Technologies) together with an N-terminal cleavable 6\u00d7His-tag. Cells were re-suspended in lysis buffer and sonicated. The cell lysate was centrifuged for 30 min at 25000g and the supernatant loaded on a Ni-NTA column (Qiagen). Protein bound to the resin was washed with 20 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 300 mM NaCl, 50 mM imidazole and eluted in 20 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 500 mM imidazole. To remove the His-tag, mini-fibers were incubated overnight with 1/100 His-tagged TEV protease at 10\u00b0C. Imidazole was removed by dialysis against lysis buffer. Uncleaved protein and TEV protease were removed by binding to a Ni-NTA resin. HAd3 penton forms multimers (dodecahedra) consisting of twelve penton bases each [9],[71]. P. Fender (Institut de Biologie Structurale, Grenoble) generously supplied purified HAd3 dodecahedra. Mini-fibers and dodecahedra were mixed at an approximate molecular ratio of 1:10 and incubated at 4\u00b0C overnight. The mixture was loaded onto a Superdex200 column (Amersham) to remove excess fiber. The buffer contained 20 mM Tris pH7.5 and 300 mM NaCl. Dodecahedra in complex with mini-fiber were eluted with the void volume and were visualized with an electron microscope. All mini-fiber constructs carrying HAd3 tail+shaft and a CAV-2 fiber head were unstable, possibly because they were misfolded, or they did not bind to HAd3 dodecahedra.",
