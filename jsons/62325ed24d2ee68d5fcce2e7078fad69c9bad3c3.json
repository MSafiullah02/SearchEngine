Recent reports that more than one third of the sales of online bookseller amazon.com [1] is made up of \"unsellable books\" that conventional bookstores have refused to carry, have created a stir [2] . This is one example that counters the basic assumption that \"companies increase profits by featuring popular, marketable books in the store.\" In addition, there are countless cases of services, such as YouTube [29] and ebay auctions [7] , that aggregate information and materials provided by the general public. These services are also managed under completely different frameworks than the distribution/mass media industries that used to handle such business. These new structures foster and cultivate diverse content while avoiding standardization due to cost or any other ready-made ideas. These tides and trends are expressed by the terms \"Web 2.0\" or \"long tail,\" which reflect the participation of the public in the transmission of information and the increasing value of the aggregate of small-scale, diverse content. These words have become symbols of the times [2] [27] .",

In conventional statistical analysis, (1) a select group of privileged analysts would (2) measure the average/overall behavior of (3) massive amounts of data. This system is typified by the opinion polls conducted by the mass media, which utilize independent information networks or financial muscle (for instance, random telephone calls to 1,000 people) to evaluate the thoughts of average citizens. Estimates of \"average customer spend\" used in business administration also fall into this category, using customer counts and corresponding total sales figures to measure the behavior of average customers.

This article proposes an analytical method for calculating the distribution of the sample sum and sample mean when the population distribution is known. Conventionally, when the population distribution was unknown, the central limit theorem, which guarantees that the distribution of the sample sum and sample mean will have an asymptotically normal distribution, has been a powerful, useful tool. On the other hand, with a known population distribution, the sample distribution can be obtained more directly and precisely by calculating the convolution of the population distribution, regardless of the sample size. Although convolution involves a considerable amount of calculation, it can be made practical by using the tremendous capacities of recent computer technology. This is how we develop the tailstat statistical analysis software package, which conducts various analyses using the known population distribution as data to input.",

As the present research examines data sets available on the internet and the statistical behavior of samples obtained from known populations, in particular the behavior of sample sums, it falls into the category of descriptive statistics. In descriptive statistics, the population distribution that individual samples follow is a given, and because each statistic is a sample variable transformation, probability distribution can, in principle, be calculated using elementary probability theory. Large sample sizes, however, due to the sheer amount of computation, make this calculation practically impossible. In such cases, one would usually obtain a corresponding asymptotic distribution for an infinite size of samples, and use it for approximation. One prominent example is the normal approximation of a sample sum or sample mean based on the central limit theorem. This kind of approximation was extremely effective in the investigation of targets characterized by (1), (2) and (3) described in the previous section because the focus was a macro analysis based on statistics obtained from a large sample size; therefore, much of the statistical work done in the 20th century onward has concentrated on asymptotic distribution. Mathematical interest probably also encouraged this trend.",

Exact sampling distributions for known populations are specific to each population, which researchers in the field have calculated on an ad hoc basis. This is obvious because, as stated in the previous section, only recently have descriptive statistics for small sample sizes, such as the \"long tail,\" been recognized as valuable for having crosscutting universality. Thus there are few precedent studies that, like the present research, advocate the rethinking of small sample size-specific descriptive statistics methods or the development of universal tools. It is important to point out that even statistical tools such as Microsoft Excel and SPSS are not built with the function for calculating the distribution of a sample sum for a given population distribution.",

For instance, in the tagging system described above, it is normally assumed that the content provider or viewer applies a tag consciously. However, since tagging usually requires a certain amount of effort, some services take special measures to accumulate more tags. Google Image Labeler[12], for one, added a game-like element to its image tagging process -to the user, the experience is nothing more than a simple game, but in the background, the user's input contributes to the improvement of Google's image search. Another example is PodCastle, a service that allows users to perform text-based searches of podcasts. To do this, the service collects podcasts and uses speech recognition tools to convert the audio files to text. Then, in order to further improve the accuracy of the system, PodCastle allows users to correct errors in speech recognition. These revisions are made in the form of a \"mistake-hunting game.\" Similar to the Google Image Labeler process, this added entertainment element is believed to stimulate contribution. The psychological premise that users will not be able to ignore incorrect recognition of their favorite entertainers' speech is also thought to be a driving factor behind contribution.",

There have been many modeled studies of social networks analyzing community growth and tagging behavior such as [10] [14] [3][9] [23] . For those studies we are able to provide a new descriptive statistical analysis tool. In addition, in the analyzed examples that follow, we define indices that evaluate contents from an unorthodox perspective, one used previously by Irie [13] and Oishi [21] and their teams. Irie and his team suggested \"degree of edits\" as a way of ranking videos on video sharing sites, while Oishi with his team evaluated social bookmark tags on the basis of \"novelty,\" using the results to calculate the importance of the site. Our proposal is independent of video content, tag text, and other information specific to individual sites. Instead, it is structured to be universal, able to produce results based only on the data structures shared by various services. Thus, rather than competing with other approaches, our proposal is expected to have a synergistic effect.",

In our analysis, we consider bookmark registrants to be \"visitors\" and the number of registered tags to be \"compensation.\" Essentially, the analysis is aimed at identifying sites that have a number of registered tags that is disproportionate (high or low) relative to the number of bookmark registrants. The discussion would be more complete if the analysis could be used to determine the percentage of site visitors that registers a bookmark (which would also be viewed as a type of compensation), but visitor figures are not included in the data set. Figure 1 is a frequency distribution that illustrates the number of tags per bookmark. Let us denote this distribution by g. Supposing that bookmark registration is an independent activity, the frequency distribution is basically equivalent to \"the probability distribution of the compensation paid per visitor.\" The 1.818 expected value eventually (via the law of large numbers) becomes the average customer spend. The result is asymmetric, and there is decay after a peak at tag number 1. There is also an increase at tag number 10, which is probably because livedoor Clips allows a maximum of 10 tags and a \"10 tag\" culture has developed among users 2 .",

Essentially, this is the probability distribution for tag number T when a bookmark has been registered n times. Figures 3  and 4 are histograms of g * 20 and g * 200 , respectively. The distribution tail is still long to the right in the g * 20 histogram, but the g * 200 distribution is almost normal. Now let us choose an arbitrary bookmark with n registrants and denotes its number of tags by T . When T = t is observed, we can calculate the upper probability pt = P (T \u2265 t) using g * n . For comparison, we also use the normal distribution N (n\u00b5, n\u03c3 2 ), \u00b5 = 1.818, \u03c3 = 2.008 in Figure 1 to obtain probability pz = P (T \u2265 t). In this case, the central limit theorem is assumed to be satisfied. With that, we will then obtain pt and pz for all of the sites in the data set. The smaller the pt and pz values, the easier it is to indicate that tags are rare; or, in other terms, that the \"value is rare,\" or that tags are an \"abnormality.\" It is also possible to use L = 10 j=1 p k j j (where pj denotes the probability that one person assigns j tags and kj denotes the number of persons who assigned j tags) as an index of rarity. Many non-parametric tests based on multinomial distributions use L as test statistics.Another candidate that can be readily calculated might be the modification L \u2032 = 10 j=1 (pj + \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 + p10) k j . However, instead of trying to assign a particular threshold for L or L \u2032 to determine the rarity of the total number of tags 10 j=1 jkj , the tailstat approach of a probability based estimate seems more appropriate. Another problematic point where tailstat has the advantage is that an index such as L does not allow one to compare the level of rarity of a situation in which, for example, 3 users assign 27 tags among them, with a different situation where 4 users assign 37 tags.",

The correlation can be read as basically negative, but when pt is close to zero or 1, average spend shows a large variation. What this indicates is that when a user searches for a site with a high (or low) average customer spend, the user may overlook a site with rarer value. Figure 6 is the corresponding quantitative representation, extracting only the Figure 5 pt values less than 0.1 and defining them as \"all of the sites with rare value.\" Figure 6 illustrates how a \"rare-valued\" site can be detected by using average customer spend > a as a query when positive parameter a is increased from 0 in small increments, with a on the x-axis and recall and precision on the y-axis. When a is 3, both recall and precision are slightly under 80%, meaning that rare value sites account for roughly 80% of the total, but sites without any rare value still accounts for over 20%. This indicates that the average customer spend criterion cannot fully determine a site's rare value.",

Average customer spend is often sorted in a ranking-format, using the \"upper n-th percentile\" or the \"lower n number of cases.\" This is probably because it is difficult to determine a specific, meaningful threshold along the lines of a pass/fail line, where students who score above a certain percentage pass, and those below it fail. On the other hand, pt has a specific meaning -\"the probability that a similar event will occur,\" so it can be sorted on an ordinal scale and also from specific viewpoints, such as \"rare sites that obtain tags at a probability of less than 1%.\" The above results demonstrate that the pt obtained via tailstat can be used to evaluate site value in a way that average customer spend does not allow.",

Figure 7 is a scatter plot with the common logarithm of the ratio log10(pt/pz) on the x-axis and the number of bookmark registrants n (sample number) on the y-axis. This figure demonstrates that when the number of bookmark registrants increases (for example, over 200), the central limit theorem becomes dominant and the difference between pt and pz grows smaller (converging to 0), but such data accounts for only 0.6% of the total. In fact, in the majority of the plot, where the number of bookmark registrants is small, there is a substantial difference between pt and pz, sometimes exceeding the single digits (values on the y-axis greater than 1). These results show that careless use of the central limit theorem should be avoided, and analysis using tailstat is very effective. ",

In fact, the more tags a site has, the higher the probability it will appear in searches, so other users are more likely to visit the site. This is common knowledge in the retail world -popular products are placed in easily-visible locations, and consequently sell even more. Conventional strategies arranged products (content) using indices such as sales rankings, visitor rankings, and aver-age customer spend rankings, but it is technically simple to chronologically follow the effects that product placement based on the \"rare value\" index (calculated by tailstat in this article) has on subsequent sales and how it changes the rare value index, which is indeed an interesting concept.

The article also described rethinking of sample sum/sample mean statistical methods based on the convolution of known populations, as well as the development of tailstat, a statistical analysis package that makes such restructuring possible. Then, after illustrating the effectiveness of tailstat in the analysis of livedoor Clip, the article discussed important points for consideration when applying tailstat to other cases expressed by the \"visitor/compensation\" model. In the future, we plan to explore analysis methods for items besides sample sum/sample mean, expand tailstat, improve calculation speed, and add functions for continuous distribution analysis.
