            "text": "In this paper I examine the sensitivity of total UK Covid-19 deaths and the demand for intensive care and ward beds, to the timing and duration of suppression periods during a 500 day period. This is achieved via a SEIR model. Using an expected latent period of 4.5 days and infectious period of 3.8 days, ! was first estimated as 3.18 using observed death rates under unmitigated spread and then under the effects of the total lock down ( ! =0.60) of 23 March. The case fatality rate given infection is taken as 1%. Parameter values for mean length of stay and conditional probability of death for ICU and non-ICU hospital admissions are guided by Ferguson et al.(2020) . Under unmitigated spread the model predicts around 600,000 deaths in the UK. Starting with one exposed person at time zero and a suppression consistent with an ! of 0.60 on day 72, the model predicts around 39,000 deaths for a first wave, but this reduces to around 11,000 if the intervention takes place one week earlier. If the initial suppression were in place until day 200 and then relaxed to an ! of 1.5 between days 200 and 300, to be followed by a return to an ! of 0.60, the model predicts around 43,000 deaths. This would increase to around 48,000 if the release from the first suppression takes place one week earlier. The results indicate the extreme sensitivity to timing and the consequences of even small delays to suppression and premature relaxation of such measures.",

            "text": "In order to model the spread of total Covid-19 deaths in the UK over the next 500 days say, one can build a detailed stochastic micro simulation model that includes spatial and age heterogeneity as in Davies et al. (2020) and Ferguson et al. (2020) . In order to gain some understanding of the sensitivity with respect to the timing of suppression measures and their relaxation, a simple deterministic SEIR model, see for example Hethcote (2000) and Blackwood and Childs (2008) , can be useful. That is the approach used in this paper. SEIR is a compartment based model with transitions as shown in Diagram 1. S stands for the number of susceptibles, those who have not yet been infected. Initially, almost the entire population is in that category. E is the number who are currently exposed, that is they are infected but not yet infectious. After a latent period, an exposed person becomes infectious and is able to infect susceptible persons. I is the number who are currently infectious. Initially, both I and E are small numbers in comparison to N, the population size. Each infectious person remains so for an infectious period. An infective person is one who is either exposed or infectious. Finally, R stands for those who are removed in the sense they have either recovered or died. In the simple form of the model considered here it is assumed that + + + = . The SEIR model is more appropriate than a SIR model for Covid-19 as SIR does not separate the exposed and infectious states.",

Ideally, that would need to be matched by similar increases in medical, nursing, and ancillary staff; equipment such as ventilators; personal protective equipment; and testing for presence of the virus, all of which have become major issues.

(2020) thought the incubation period to be around 5-6 days with a serial interval of similar duration. Davies et al. (2020) assumed a gamma distributed latent period with mean and standard deviation of 4 and 2 days respectively, a mean incubation period of 5.5 days, and a serial interval of 6.5 days. In this paper we take the mean latent and infectious period to be 4.5 and 3.8 days respectively, leading to a crude estimate of the serial interval to be 4.5+0.5x3.8 = 6.4 days. Using these in (18) gives ! = 3.18. The death data was that pertaining to English hospital deaths by date of death 3 . This data set was chosen as many other accessible sets are by date of recording the death which can be several days after actual death. We assumed that the growth/decline rate is similar in all four countries of the UK. The model assumes all deaths occur in hospital and applies to the entire UK of population 67 million.

There is much uncertainty about the parameter values for the examples shown. In reality, they will be influenced by the degree of stress a health system is exposed to. Rather than precise prediction, the intention has been to show the modelling principles and to demonstrate the extreme sensitivity of the total number of deaths to the timing of suppression measures and their release/relaxation. Literally, each day's delay in starting suppression can result in thousands of extra deaths. After the peak has been passed it is equally important to time the relaxation so that the further death toll is not excessive. These conclusions are the incontrovertible consequence of the exponential growth and decline of a managed epidemic. A more sophisticated model will enable more precise predictions on cumulative deaths under a range of control strategies, such as shielding and segmentation of the population. These can then be put alongside the economic and other effects of prolonged suppression. The political decisions can then be well informed.",

Further, no account has been taken in the model of a gradual transition from the unmitigated ! of 3.18 to the estimated value of 0.60 following lockdown. Going forward, ! will be monitored to update predictions. A disadvantage of using death data is that one is essentially estimating ! some 20 days previously. But the alternative of using positive test numbers might lead to biased estimates due to the volatility of the proportion of infectious persons who are represented in such figures.
