In traditional SPM, a sequence database is a set of sequences, each sequence is a list of elements, and each element is a set of items. For example, <a(abc)(ac)c(cd)> is a sequence in traditional SPM, since (abc) is an element in the sequence. In gap constraint SPM, a sequence database can be a sequence, and each sequence is a list of items. For example, <aabcacccd> is a sequence in gap constraint SPM. More importantly, traditional SPM does not calculate the number of occurrences of a pattern in a sequence, while gap constraint SPM does. For example, apparently, pattern \u201cac\u201d occurs in sequence <a(abc)(ac)c(cd)> more than once. But traditional SPM neglects the repetition, which leads to the loss of support information. For example, in long-length sequences such as DNA, virus, and consumption records, the repetitive occurrences indicate the frequency of patterns, which reflect information discrimination between patterns, and are of high research value.",

            "text": "Gap constraint SPM (or gap constraint sequence pattern mining) can avoid finding many useless patterns by setting gap constraints, while repetitive SPM cannot [20], [21] since it does not set gap constraint. Gap constraint SPM is also different from frequent substring mining [22] and n-gram text mining [23], since the latter mine the pattern without gaps. One key issue of gap constraint SPM is to calculate the support (the number of occurrences) of a pattern in a sequence, which is pattern matching problem [24], [25], [26]. Thus, gap constraint is also called a wildcard gap or flexible wildcards [27], [28] in pattern matching fields. If a pattern has many gaps that are the same, the pattern is called a pattern with periodic gaps [29], described as P=p1[a,b]p2\u22efpm\u22121[a,b]pm, where a and b (0\u2264\na\n\u2264\nb) are the minimum and maximum gap constraints, respectively, and m indicates the pattern length [30]. The size of gap constraints can be flexibly set by users, which leads to various applications, such as correlation analysis between DNA and diseases based on gap constraints [29]. Li et al. [31] proposed an effective method to mine the patterns with gap constraints that can be used for feature extraction for sequence classifications [32]. However, introducing gap constraints not only makes the mining method more flexible but also makes the results more complex because the number of patterns increases exponentially as the pattern length increases. To solve this problem, the nonoverlapping condition [33] was proposed, which allows the same sequence letter to match and rematch pattern letters at different positions. Introducing the nonoverlapping condition not only reduces the number of occurrences but also makes the unique patterns richer. Our previous studies have proved that the nonoverlapping SPM is a complete mining method which satisfies the Apriori property [34], [35]. Example 1 is used to explain the periodic gap pattern, gap constraint mining, and nonoverlapping support.",

To make it easier to describe, an occurrence will be described in the form of a sequence landmark. For example, the first occurrence of P in S1 is s1s3s4s5, which can be written as <1,3,4,5>. In this way, the other 2 occurrences of P in S1 are <2,3,4,5> and <5,6,7,8>. The results are shown in Fig. 1.\nSimilarly, there are four occurrences of P in both S2 and S3. If we ignore the repetition, the support of P1 in SDB is 3. If we take the repetition into consideration, the support is 3+4+4=11. The latter method considers occurrences in detail. However, this method also encounters some problems. For example, there are three occurrences for pattern Q= A[0, 2]T in sequence S4= AAATCCC, but there are nine occurrences for its super-pattern Q\u2032= A[0, 2]T[0, 2]C. This example shows that the number of patterns increases exponentially with increasing pattern length, which does not satisfy the Apriori property [19]. To solve the above problem, the nonoverlapping condition was proposed [33]. With the nonoverlapping condition, any two occurrences cannot use the same sequence letter in the same position. For example, <1,3,4,5> and <5,6,7,8> are two nonoverlapping occurrences for pattern P in sequence S1, since sequence letter s5 is matched twice with p4 and p1, respectively. However, <1,3,4,5> and <2,3,4,5> are two overlapping occurrences, since sequence letters s3, s4, and s5 are reused by p2, p3, and p4, respectively.\n",

            "text": "Agrawal et al. [36] proposed SPM. Based on this research, many achievements have been made, such as high utility mining [37], contrast SPM [38], [39], and closed SPM [40], [41]. Closed SPM can effectively compress the frequent patterns [42], [43]. For example, assuming that the supports of patterns \u201cA\u201d, \u201cAT\u201d, and \u201cATC\u201d are equal, then patterns \u201cA\u201d and \u201cAT\u201d are called redundant patterns. Hence, patterns \u201cA\u201d, \u201cAT\u201d, \u201cATC\u201d can be compressed into \u201cATC\u201d without losing support information. Besides closed pattern mining, there are other methods to achieve pattern compression, such as generator mining [44] and maximal pattern mining [45]. Generator mining aims to find the set of patterns with minimal length, while closed pattern mining focuses on finding the set of patterns with maximal length. Maximal pattern mining finds the set of patterns whose super-patterns are infrequent. Closed SPM has become a research hotspot because of its impressive compression performance [46], [47] and has been widely used in many essential fields, such as recommendation systems [48], clustering analysis [49], [50], [51], genetic engineering [52], disease diagnosis [53], and software engineering [54], [55]. However, these studies ignored the repetitions that may contain more relevant information in long sequences. Noticing this disadvantage, Ding et al. [33] proposed the CloGSgrow algorithm, which studied the repetitive occurrences of patterns. CloGSgrow calculates the occurrences of the super-patterns based on those of the sub-patterns and the results show that the repetitive occurrence pattern is compressible, which is of high research value for long sequences. Li et al. [31] added periodic gap constraints and the experiments show that introducing gap constraints improves the mining results.",

            "text": "Another important branch of SPM is gap constraint SPM. This method aims to discover subsequences from sequences that satisfy the gap constraints and support threshold. Existing studies are based on three types of conditions, no-condition [29], [56], one-off condition [8], [57], and nonoverlapping condition [33], [34], [58]. The no-condition allows sequence letters to be reused by patterns for an unlimited time. Zhang et al. [29] first proposed SPM under no-condition in DNA sequences. However, pattern mining under no-condition does not satisfy the Apriori property, which means it is necessary to expand the search space to mine all frequent patterns [19]. The one-off condition allows the sequence letters to be matched no more than once [59]. In Example 1, there is only one occurrence <1,3,4,5> of P in S1 with the one-off condition. Pattern mining under the one-off condition was applied to biological sequence mining [8], which is an NP-Hard problem, since its computational complexity is the same as that of an iterative shuffle problem [60]. Therefore, heuristic strategies are applied to calculate the pattern support. Hence, pattern mining under the one-off condition belongs to approximate mining. The nonoverlapping condition allows the sequence letters to be rematched by the different pattern letters and to be matched no more than once by the same pattern letter. Although the nonoverlapping condition is more complex than the other two, our previous studies have demonstrated that the pattern mining under the nonoverlapping condition is not only a complete mining method with the Apriori property but can also discover more valuable patterns than the other two conditions [34], [35]. Consequently, pattern mining under the nonoverlapping condition outperforms those of the no-condition and one-off condition. A comparison of the related research work is shown in Table 1.",

To obtain the maximum pattern support, NETGAP prunes the invalid nodes after obtaining a nonoverlapping occurrence [34]. Hence, the time complexity of NETGAP is O(m\n\u00d7\nm\n\u00d7\nn\n\u00d7\nW), where m, n, and W are the length of pattern and sequence, and the maximum gap, respectively. However, in this paper, we propose the BackTr algorithm which employs a backtracking strategy to calculate the pattern support without pruning the invalid nodes, which will reduce the time complexity to O(m\n\u00d7\nn\n\u00d7\nW). In addition, Reference [34] focused on mining the frequent patterns, while this paper mines the closed patterns and adopts three pruning strategies, inheriting, predicting, and determining to predict the frequency and closeness of the patterns.",

Since the nodes with the same label can appear on a Nettree for multiple times, nji is used to represent node i in the j-th level. A path from a root to a leaf in the Nettree corresponds to an occurrence of the pattern in the sequence. The problem of calculating the support of pattern P in sequence S with the nonoverlapping condition means that all Nettree nodes cannot be reused in the same level [34]. The above properties make Nettree the most suitable for representing the nonoverlapping occurrences of a pattern. In our previous work [34], NETGAP was proposed employing Nettree, which is a complete method to calculate the nonoverlapping occurrence. However, the weakness of NETGAP is the lower efficiency since NETGAP must prune the invalid nodes after obtaining a nonoverlapping occurrence. Based on the above reasons, we propose the BackTr algorithm, which is of superior efficiency. Example 6, Example 7 will illustrate the principles of NETGAP and BackTr, respectively.",

In Fig. 2, it is easy to obtain the first root\u2013leaf path <n11, n22, n34, n47>, marked in yellow. The corresponding occurrence is <1,2,4,7>. Then, NETGAP deletes nodes n11, n22, n34, and n47. After that, NETGAP finds the invalid nodes in the new Nettree. It is clear that there are no invalid nodes at that time. Then NETGAP obtains the second root\u2013leaf path <n13, n26, n310, n412>, marked in red and its corresponding occurrence is <3,6,10,12>. After pruning nodes n13, n26, n310, and n412, NETGAP finds an invalid node n28 and prunes it. Finally, NETGAP obtains the third occurrence <7,9,13,14>, which is marked in blue.

The reason is that NetNCSP employs the BackTr strategy, and reduces the running time by pruning invalid nodes, thus reducing the time complexity from O(m\n\u00d7\nm\n\u00d7\nn\n\u00d7\nW) to O(m\n\u00d7\nn\n\u00d7\nW). Hence, NetNCSP outperforms NetNCSP-netgap.3.The pattern growth strategy is significantly effective. From Fig. 3, we can see that NetNCSP is faster than NetNCSP-bf and NetNCSP-df. For example, NetNCSP runs 679.0 s in Ebola_virus, while NetNCSP-bf and NetNCSP-df run 1290.7 and 1293.4 s, respectively. The reason is that NetNCSP calculates 940 candidate patterns, while NetNCSP-bf and NetNCSP-df calculate 1364 candidate patterns. The reason lies in that NetNCSP employs pattern growth strategy to generate the candidate patterns, while NetNCSP-bf and NetNCSP-df employ the breadth-first and depth-first strategies, respectively. The pattern growth strategy is more effective than the other two, which is consistent with the analysis in Example 8. Hence, NetNCSP outperforms NetNCSP-bf and NetNCSP-df.\n",

            "text": "\n1.NetNCSP outperforms NOSEP since NetNCSP not only compresses the patterns effectively but also achieves higher efficiency. For example, in Fig. 6, when the pattern length is 7, NOSEP gets 1864 patterns, while NetNCSP gets 1188. The running time of NOSEP and NetNCSP are 431.1 and 351.8 s, respectively. Similar phenomena can be discovered in different databases. For example, in Fig. 10, the running time of NOSEP and NetNCSP are 263.8 and 189.6 s in AX829174, respectively. The reasons are as follows. Firstly, NetNCSP adopts a more efficient backtracking strategy in calculating pattern support, and reduces the time complexity from O(m\n\u00d7\nm\n\u00d7\nn\n\u00d7\nW) to O(m\n\u00d7\nn\n\u00d7\nW). More importantly, NetNCSP adopts three effective pruning strategies. The predicting and inheriting strategies prune the redundant unclosed patterns before calculating support of candidate patterns, and the determining strategy determines the closeness of frequent patterns avoiding the generation of candidate pattern of longer length. Hence, NetNCSP outperforms NOSEP.2.NetNCSP outperforms CloGSgrow since NetNCSP mines more closed patterns and is more efficient in terms of ATC (Average mining Time per Closed pattern). For example, in Fig. 6, when the pattern length is 5, NetNCSP mines 282 closed patterns and CloGSgrow only gets 15. Although Fig. 7 shows that when the pattern length is 5, the running time of NetNCSP and CloGSgrow are 64.1 and 5.6 s respectively, the ATCs of NetNCSP and CloGSgrow are 64.1/282=0.2 and 5.6/15=0.4 s, respectively. Similar phenomena can be discovered in different databases. For example, in Fig. 9, Fig. 10, CloGSgrow takes 83.3 s to get 33 closed patterns in Ebola_virus, while NetNCSP takes 453.8 s to get 912. The ATCs of CloGSgrow and NetNCSP are 2.5 and 0.5 s, respectively. The reasons are as follows. First, NetNCSP, as a complete algorithm, mines the complete closed patterns. Thus, more closed patterns can be discovered. Second, NetNCSP adopts three pruning strategies to reduce the running time effectively. As a result, NetNCSP outperforms CloGSgrow.3.NetNCSP can compress the patterns effectively. For example, in Fig. 6, NOSEP and NetNCSP find 399 frequent patterns and 282 closed patterns with length 5, respectively. Thus, the compression rate is (399-282)/399= 29.3%. In Fig. 9, NOSEP and NetNCSP mine 1364 frequent patterns and 912 closed patterns in Ebola_virus, respectively. Thus, the compression rate is 33.1%. The reason is that NOSEP mines the complete set of the frequent patterns which contains redundant patterns, while NetNCSP mines a subset of the closed patterns according to three closeness determination pruning strategies.4.NetNCSP reduces the support calculation times effectively. For example, Fig. 8 shows that when mining patterns with length 7, NetNCSP calculates the support for 1443 times, while NOSEP needs 2134 times. Similar phenomena can be found in different databases. For example, Fig. 11 shows that NetNCSP calculates support for 932 times in Ebola_virus, while NOSEP needs 1364 times. The reason is that NetNCSP adopts the predicting and inheriting strategies to prune the redundant patterns, thus, reducing the support calculation times. As a result, NetNCSP reduces support calculation times.\n",

In the process of support calculation, NetNCSP adopts the BackTr algorithm with backtracking strategy to calculate the nonoverlapping support of patterns in Nettree. In the process of closeness determination, NetNCSP adopts three pruning strategies, inheriting, predicting, and determining. The inheriting strategy can avoid invalid calculations on the redundant patterns. The predicting strategy can reduce the number of candidate patterns effectively. The determining strategy determines the closeness of the frequent patterns and prunes the redundant patterns. NetNCSP is of lower time complexity than the state-of-the-art algorithms. Experiments are carried out on long-length sequence databases, such as DNA and virus. The experimental results show that NetNCSP has better performance than competitive algorithms and compresses the frequent patterns effectively. In the experiment of biological application, we employ NetNCSP in mining biological sequences in SARS-CoV-2 and SARS viruses, the results show that the two viruses are of similar pattern composition with different combinations.",
