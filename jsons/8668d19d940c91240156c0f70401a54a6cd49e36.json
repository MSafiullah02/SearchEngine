To date, only remdesivir (Gilead Sciences) has shown to possibly lower the time to recovery [3, 4] . In the past, developing antiviral agents has taken 5.9 years on average [5] . In the current crisis, it appears feasible that this timeline will be significantly reduced if there were early signs of efficacy.",
