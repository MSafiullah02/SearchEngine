The data analyzed in this fashion represents the first estimate of how reported immunological data corresponds to disease-related morbidity and mortality, and confirms significant discrepancies in the overall research foci versus disease burden, thus identifying important gaps to be pursued by future research. These findings may also provide a justification for redirecting a portion of research funds into some of the underfunded, critical disease areas.

To capture the highest possible fraction of references describing immune epitope data, these queries are intentionally broad. To date more than 21,000 references of potential interest (.1% of PubMed) have been identified for inclusion into the IEDB. Their potential relevance is determined first by an automated text classifier based on the information contained within their abstract, title and journal title [1] , and then manually by subject matter experts. The criteria for passing this initial selection process require that i) the reference contains experimental data describing adaptive immune responses, ii) the data is original (for example, review papers and use of epitopes as a mere marker or tag are excluded), and iii) the epitope molecular structure is described in sufficient detail [2] . Following these preliminary determinations, a systematic review of the paper is performed, and if the study is still deemed to contain curatable information, the data are extracted, entered into the database and the curated record then becomes available to the public.",

As first priority, Infectious Diseases and Microbes have been targeted, followed by Allergy, Autoimmunity and Transplantation. Accordingly, the curation of all references from Allergy and Infectious Diseases is nearly complete (.80% and 90%, respectively). In order to enhance the curation prioritization process, we recently further categorized all potential references into six main immunological domains, or classes. These classes include the four original domains: Infectious Disease and Microbes (excluding HIV), Allergy, Autoimmunity and Transplantation, plus HIV (including SIV and related viruses) and Cancer. References containing immune epitope data, but not pertinent to any of the main classes were categorized as ''Other''. This detailed classification allows not only for enhanced prioritization, but also enables a more accurate/thorough description and accounting of the IEDB reference data.",

This increase in epitope-related literature is likely related to the discovery and utilization of monoclonal antibodies. A further remarkable jump in publications occurs in the mid to late 1980s', probably related to the demonstration that small peptides are the ligands recognized by MHC molecules and T cells.

It may therefore be taken as representative of the degree to which the molecular targets associated with these diseases have been scrutinized and defined. An immune epitope is defined by the IEDB as the molecular structure interacting with receptors of the immune system (T cell and B cell/antibody). Accordingly this definition excludes, for example, structures involved in lectin-carbohydrate interactions, or structures recognized by receptors involved in innate immunity, such as NK cells. Immune epitopes are defined in the literature with varying level of resolution. In some cases the minimal/optimal residues of a T or B cell determinant are exactly defined, while in other cases only certain key components are mapped. Finally, in certain instances broad regions are pinpointed as containing the epitope, but the exact boundaries and components are not defined. No structures .50aa are considered for inclusion in the IEDB. Because it is difficult to adequately compare the societal impact (i.e. disease burden in morbidity and mortality) of vastly different diseases categories such as Allergies, Cancer, Autoimmunity or Infectious Diseases, we have elected to investigate the overall impact of disease burden within only the infectious and autoimmune disease classes. For this purpose, we examined global morbidity (prevalence) and mortality data for a representative list of pathogen/diseases, and then compared these data to the number of references in each category.",

Indeed, B. pertussis stands out prominently, with some 60 million people infected per year and an estimated 400,000 deaths, and a mere 16 references. Figure 4 shows the coverage for autoimmune diseases described by the immune epitope data. Interestingly, it seems that type I diabetes and RA, despite being associated with higher morbidity and/or mortality as compared to MS and lupus, are actually associated with relatively lower numbers of references.

While the epitope coverage was greater for high profile pathogens like TB and Malaria, the actual percentage itself was rather low (ex. 7% for TB and 0.9% for Malaria). Furthermore, high overall coverage does not necessarily translate in well-balanced coverage. In many cases, the majority of the identified epitopes come from very few antigens. This phenomenon was observed and previously discussed in detail for high profile pathogens such as P. falciparum, TB and influenza [4] [5] [6] .

Interestingly, within the Infectious Disease class, we found that references representing viral pathogens outnumber bacterial and parasitic pathogens by about 3 to 1. This is likely due to biological factors relating to genome size and/or antigenic complexity.

Here, we investigated the relationship between epitope coverage and overall disease burden by comparing the top ten pathogens/diseases in terms of the total number of references with the total number of cases and deaths per year worldwide. This analysis showed that while most of the high impact infectious diseases (in terms of prevalence and deaths) were well-represented in the top ten, several very significant diseases were represented by far fewer references, thus highlighting a significant imbalance in the coverage. Examples of these high relevance/low coverage infectious diseases are dengue, Schistosoma, HSV-2, B. pertussis and Chlamydia trachoma. Similar observations were made for diseases within the autoimmune domain, where the relatively lower impact diseases MS and lupus have much greater epitope coverage than type 1 diabetes and RA. These gaps are even more significant in light of our recent findings following in-depth meta-analyses of some of the most well studied diseases, such as influenza, TB and malaria [4] [5] [6] [7] , which revealed significant gaps and imbalances within the immunological knowledge associated with each of these pathogens.",

However, while the epitope coverage was greater for high profile pathogens like TB and Malaria, the actual percentage itself was rather low. This overall lack of coverage for these pathogens is likely due to a combination of factors, including genome size and organism complexity. Indeed, the genome of M. tuberculosis is ,4,000 ORFs, and the etiological agent of malaria, P. falciparum, has an even larger genome and a complex 3-stage life cycle. In addition, we found that good coverage did not necessarily translate in well-balanced coverage, as in many instances, the bulk of epitope identification focuses on just a few of the total antigens. This observation has been made previously by our group, the best example of which is malaria.

For example, in our experience about 30% of the references deemed potentially acceptable on the basis of the abstract, are eventually disqualified from curation because they fail to meet all inclusion criteria. Thus approximately 70% of targeted references become incorporated into the database. We would also like to underscore that the work presented herein is tightly linked to other efforts currently ongoing with the IEDB. Specifically, the present work benefits from the development of formal ontologies and classification of immune epitope data [13] , and at the same time informs further development of ontologies and controlled vocabularies, as new reference categories are curated. Most importantly, the current work has crucially relied on the development of automated text classifiers [1] , and in turn the present data can be utilized to further develop new methods of automated text classification and characterization.",

These were selected based on the most prevalent disease categories for which sound epidemiological data existed. For example, within the broader categories such as single stranded, positive sense RNA viruses, we selected prominent pathogens such as measles virus, RSV, Mumps, rabies virus, Ebola virus and all influenza viruses as representative of the group. Preliminary prevalence and mortality figures were then assigned to each pathogen using the WHO web page (WHO fact sheets). In order to verify that our data corresponds with what is currently accepted within the scientific community a list of subject matter experts (SME) was generated using the ISI web of knowledge site [apps.isiknowledge.com]. Under the Web of Science tab, the terms ''morbidity or prevalence or mortality and disease x'' were applied in order to flag the top 5 experts within each disease-specific field based on their total number of publications. Subject matter experts were then formally contacted by email to seek independent validation of the preliminary figures. Prevalence and mortality numbers were then adjusted, if warranted, to those provided by the SMEs. On average, three authors were emailed for each disease in order to obtain validation. Diseases, for which reliable figures could not be found and/or were not available through the SMEs, were excluded from this part of the analysis. ",

Within positive-strand RNA viruses, the hepatitis C virus (HCV) subcategory accounts for about 34.1% of the references, followed by Picornaviruses (poliovirus, coxsackievirus, foot and mouth disease virus; 26.3%). The Flaviviridae (West Nile, yellow fever virus and dengue virus) and Nidovirales (SARS and other coronaviruses) families are less well represented, representing 8.5 and 13.2%, respectively. In the retro-transcribing virus category, excluding Lentiviruses (HIV, SIV) which are separately classified by another group in the HIV Los Alamos database [www.hiv.lanl. gov], the delta retrovirus (HTLV) and hepatitis B virus (HBV) represent the bulk of the category, with 22.1% and 53.5%, respectively. In the category of dsDNA viruses, Herpesviridae are by far the most represented. Specifically, there are 185, 208 and 233 references each for alpha, beta and gamma herpesviruses, respectively, accounting for 57% of the category. Another 315 references are related to human papilloma virus (HPV). Finally, relatively few (45) references are related to poxviruses. Within the Actinobacteria/Proteobacteria category, references related to Mycobacteria are by far the most numerous (39.6%), followed by Enterobacteria (E.coli, Salmonella, Yersinia, Shigella and Proteus). Fewer references are related to other classes containing important human pathogens, such as bacteria in the genera Vibrio, Haemophilus, Pseudomonas, Anaplasmas, Neisseria and Bordetella. Likewise, in the category of Firmicutes/Other Bacteria, well-represented categories include Listeria, Streptococci and Clostridiales. References describing epitopes from Staphylococcus, Chlamydia, Spirochaetes and other bacteria are less well represented. Finally, in terms of parasitic eukaryotic organisms, the most references by far are represented as relating to Plasmodium [malaria] (48.1%); followed by Eukaryotic invertebrates such as Nematodes, Platyhelminthes, and Schistosomas",
