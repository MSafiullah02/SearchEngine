Unrestricted mobility between the two risk communities increases the number of secondary cases in the low-risk community but reduces the overall epidemic size. By contrast, the imposition of a cordon sanitaire around the high-risk community reduces the number of secondary infections in the low-risk community but increases the overall epidemic size. The degree to which mobility restrictions increase or decrease the overall epidemic size depends on the level of risk in each community and the characteristics of the disease.",

The cordon sanitaire was applied to the area containing, at the time, more than 70% of the epidemic in an effort to contain the spread of the disease [20] . Travel restrictions produced a humanitarian crisis within the quarantined region. Disruption of the food transportation system led to food shortages, while lack of appropriate health care increased the risk of infection [21, 9] . Lack of mobility and growing levels of infection resulted in an increasing (effective) reproduction number over time, and therefore also in the number of EVD cases. Indeed, the data suggest that mobility restrictions may have accelerated the contagion process, and therefore led to a higher than expected number of cases within the mobility-regulated region [16, 22, 23] .",

The impact of travel restrictions on disease risk has been previously analyzed both theoretically (largely from an Eulerian perspective on mobility [24, 25] ), and empirically (using, for example, data on the impact of international air travel restrictions on disease spread during the 2009 Swine flu pandemic [26, 27] and the 2014 Ebola outbreak [28, 29] ). Most such studies have focused on the role of restrictions on the rate of spread rather than the final epidemic size, and have shown that travel restrictions can slow the rate at which a disease spreads from the source of infection. While the speed of transmission is relevant, our primary concern is to understand the implications of mobility for the location of secondary infections relative to the availability and quality of health care. That is, to quantify the role of local mobility patterns on the local and total number of secondary cases, the final epidemic size.",

The model keeps track of individuals' place of residency through the incorporation, via a residency time matrix, of the proportion of time spent by the resident in his/her own community (a Lagrangian approach). The balance of the time available is assumed to be spent as a visitor to the second community. The communities are differentiated by socio-economic conditions such as income, wealth, public health infrastructure, and risk. Those in one community face a high-risk of infection, those in the other face a low-risk of infection. We then use the model to assess the effectiveness of disease control via mobility restrictions.

Taking the final epidemic size corresponding to the cordon sanitaire scenario as a baseline (t 1 = 0, dashed gray line), and assuming that R 02 = 0.9, we see that low mobility levels (t 1 < 0.45) increase the total final epidemic size relative to the baseline, but that moderate mobility levels (t 1 > 0.45) reduce the total final epidemic size below the cordon sanitaire scenario.

We see that mobility above t 1 = 0.8, supports a global R 0 less than one, leading to a final epidemic size near zero. It is worth observing that the curves in Figure   1 (right panel) do not converge to R 02 at the extreme value t 1 = 1, this is because our two communities model is asymmetric (due, for example, to the local management of EVD-infected corpses). Figure 2 (left panel) shows that both empirical thresholds described by t \u2212 1 and t + 1 are highly sensitive to the risk of infection in Community 2, Figure 2 (right panel) shows that low mobility from a highly safe Community 2 reduces t + 1 . One might therefore conclude that improvements in Community 2 sanitary conditions plays a dual role: reducing the overall number of EVD secondary infections, and relaxing the mobility conditions required to manage an epidemic on the overall system (if such a policy can be put in place). It also suggests the possibility of using economic incentives to promote appropriate mobility patterns during health emergencies.

Figure 6 (left panel) shows the curves of the total attack rate at the cordon sanitaire level in the (t 1 , R 02 ) plane for the community population density ratios given by, N 1 N 2 = k = 10, 1, 1 10 . The impact of this ratio is explored when R 01 = 2.45, and R 02 > 0.35 corresponding to the regions where the cordon sanitaire conditionally works, which turn out to be sensitive to the ratio of population density in the LRC relative to the HRC. The risk-mobility conditions R 02 < 0.35 correspond to regions where the cordon sanitaire is not effective, independent of population density. The simulations reported in Figure 6 (left panel) show that as the population density ratio N 1 N 2 increases, the minimum mobility level required to drop the total attack rate below the cordon sanitaire level also increases. For instance, under the scenario t 2 = 0, N 1 = 1 10 N 2 and R 02 = 0.5, the cordon sanitaire is recommended provided the mobility t 1 \u2248 0.25 is not attainable. On the other hand, any t 1 > 0.25 leads to a total attack rate below the cordon sanitaire level meaning that a cordon sanitaire is not recommended at such mobility levels. In short, a relatively safe population neighboring a smaller unsafe population may benefit from a cordon sanitaire, (for parameters R 02 < 0.35). 10N 2 ) the lower the level of mobility needed to bring the global basic reproductive number below one. This is less sensitive to Community 2 infection risk, with EVD outbreak control possible as long as the local threshold R 02 < 1 holds. Further, as the total population in the safer community increases (for example), N 1 = 1 10 N 2 , the mobility required to control an EVD epidemic turns out to be sensitive to changes in Community 2 risk of infection and increases in R 02 . Figure 6 (right panel) shows the dynamics of the t \u2212 1 threshold under extreme density ratios. Not surprisingly, the more dense the LRC compared to the HRC, the higher level of mobility required to take the final epidemic size below the no-mobility scenario. Moreover, this is sensitive to the Community 2 infection risk (R 02 ). In fact, when the total population in the LRC is larger (N 1 = 1 1,000 N 2 ), we see that the Community 2 sanitary conditions (R 02 ) required to take the total final epidemic size below the cordon sanitaire via mobility, converge to the sharp threshold R 02 = 1. On the other hand if R 02 > 1 then there is no t \u2212 1 such that the total epidemic size is lower than the size supported by cordon sanitaire scenario level. In the case when the total population is mainly aggregated in the HRC (N 1 = 1, 000N 2 ) , the cordon sanitaire turns out to be less effective at reducing the final epidemic size at most mobility levels. Figure 8 (left panel) shows the effects of population density disparities on the threshold condition R 0 (t 1 , t 2 ) = 1. Simulations suggest that large population size in the safe community makes the twoway mobility strategy more effective at reducing the global basic reproductive number below one. Under the scenario N 1 = 1 2 N 2 and R 02 = 0.5, Community 2 mobility of around the 10% level reduces t + 1 below 60%. On the other hand, Community 2 null mobility requires a t + 1 level above 60% in order to attain a global R 0 less than one. ",

Since this is the natural response of people facing infectious disease risk, it is worth considering why mobility restrictions up to and including area quarantine are so common. One explanation may be that low-risk communities place a greater weight on containing risk to themselves than on reducing risk overall. That is, the criterion by which they judge the effectiveness of a disease control policy is not the overall final epidemic size, but the community-specific epidemic size.

During the 2009 influenza pandemic, for example, the limited supplies of vaccine where delivered primarily to Canada and the U.S., and not to Mexico. In other cases the international response has been aimed less at reducing the final epidemic size than at containing the disease in high-risk areas -resource scarce regions, frequently lacking the capacity to manage the isolation of secondary cases. Improving the capacity of such areas to manage disease outbreaks may be the only viable long-term strategy for reducing risk, but is extremely difficult to implement during the course of an epidemic.",

In the simplest scenario of two equally dense communities, the cordon sanitaire's effectiveness is determined by the Community 2 risk of infection. It follows that implementation of a cordon sanitaire should depend on the specific attributes of the communities of interest. The state of the health care system in the safer community is critical to the effectiveness of a mobility ban. Ebola outbreak (R 01 = 2.45), we see that high mobility by itself can lead to a global basic reproductive number below the critical threshold, even when R 02 is slightly greater than one.

The benefit obtained by allowing individuals from the LRC to spend time in the HRC can be explained in terms of the link between secondary infections among individuals in the HRC versus secondary infections among individuals in the LRC. The epidemic, in this polarized scenario, is primarily driven by infections among Community 1 individuals, however LRC mobility reduces the HRC attack rate, without increasing the LRC attack rate significantly.",
