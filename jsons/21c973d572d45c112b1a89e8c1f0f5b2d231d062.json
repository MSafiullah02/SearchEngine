            "text": "The helper component-proteinase (HC-Pro) encoded by potyviruses functions to cleave the viral polyprotein by an autoproteolytic mechanism at the HC-Pro C-terminus. This protein belongs to a group of viral cysteine-type proteinases and has been shown previously to catalyze proteolysis between a Gly-Gly dipeptide. The amino acid sequence requirements surrounding the HC-Pro C-terminal cleavage site of the tobacco etch virus polyprotein have been investigated using site-directed mutagenesis and in vitro expression systems. A total of 51 polyprotein derivatives, each differing by the substitution of a single amino acid between the P5 and P2' positions, were tested for autoproteolytic activity. Substitutions of Tyr (P4), Val (Pa), Gly (PI), and Gly (PI') were found to eliminate or nearly eliminate proteolysis. Substitutions of Thr (P5), Asn (P3), and Met (Pp3, on the other hand, were permissive for proteolysis, although the apparent processing rates of some polyproteins containing these alterations were reduced. These results suggest that auto-recognition by HC-Pro involves the interaction of the enzymatic binding site with four amino acids surrounding the cleavage site. Comparison of the homologous sequences of five potyviral polyproteins revealed that the residues essential for processing are strictly conserved, whereas the nonessential residues are divergent. The relationship between HC-Pro and other viral and cellular cysteine-type proteinases is discussed. o tg92 Academic PWSS, inc.",

Cleavage at six positions, each found within the C-terminal two-thirds of the polyprotein, is catalyzed by the Nla proteinase (Carrington and Dougherty, 1987b; Carrington eta/., 1988; Garcia eta/., 1989; Hellmann et a/., 1988) . This enzyme functions by auto-or cis-proteolysis at some sites and by a trans-proteolytic mechanism at others (Carrington and Dougherty, 1987a) . The importance for substrate function of a heptapeptide sequence surrounding each of the Nla-mediated cleavage sites in the tobacco etch potyviral (TEV) polyprotein has been well-characterized . Processing reactions near the N-terminus of the polyprotein are catalyzed by two additional proteinases, the helper ' To whom reprint requests should be addressed. component-proteinase (HC-Pro) and the \"35-kDa protein\" (Carrington et al., 1989a; Verchot et al., 1991) . Like Nla, the proteolytically active domains of these proteins are found within the C-terminal halves of the respective molecules. The 35kDa protein and HC-Pro each catalyze a single proteolytic reaction that occurs at their own C-terminal cleavage site. In addition, both processing reactions appear to involve an autoproteolytic mechanism (Carrington et a/., 198913; J. Verchot and J.C.C., unpublished observations) .",

Four residues (occupying the P4, P2, Pl, and Pl' positions) were found to be crucial for proteolytic function. On the other hand, amino acid residues at the P5, P3, and P2' positions were found to play relatively minor roles. All substitutions at these sites, including those that involved exchange of chemically nonconservative residues, permitted proteolysis although generally at slightly reduced rates. As revealed by insertion of chloramphenicol acetyltransferase, protein sequence to the C-terminal side of the P2' position also appeared to have little effect on processing. Significantly, the four amino acid residues defined as critical in this study are strictly conserved among the homologous cleavage sites from polyproteins encoded by five potyviruses, while each of the noncritical residues occupies a variable position (Fig. 7) . We propose that the sequence Tyr-Xaa-Val-Gly-Gly between positions P4 and Pl' constitutes an essential, highly conserved motif required for HC-Pro-mediated cleavage site function in potyviral polyproteins.",

However, conversion of Tyr (P4) to Phe, a structurally conservative substitution, was tolerated. This suggests that the presence of Tyr in the wild-type sequence reflects the necessity of an R group with an aromatic ring in the P4 position. Similarly, polyproteins containing Leu rather than Val in the P2 position retained a significant level of proteolytic activity, indicating the possible requirement for a residue containing a hydrophobic, branched side chain. The intolerance of any substitutions at the Pl and Pl' positions suggests a stringent requirement for a Gly-Gly dipeptide framing the scissile bond.",

Our data support the notion of an extended substrate recognition pocket within HC-Pro, but they also suggest that residues in addition to that in the P2 position participate in cleavage site/active site interactions. The most straightforward interpretation of our results is that residues at the P4, P2, Pl, and Pl' positions interact with residues at subsites [termed S4, S2, Sl, and Sl' according to Schechter and Berger (1967) ] within a binding pocket near the active center of the molecule.

Analyses of cleavage sites processed by these proteinases now provides further confirmation of their relatedness. The cleavage sites recognized by HC-Pro, p29, and p48 are characterized by dipeptides containing small, noncharged R groups (Gly and Ala) in the Pl and Pl' positions (Carrington et a/., 1989a; Choi et al., 1991 b; Shapira and Nuss, 1991) . With the exception of the site between the nsP3 and nsP4 proteins, which contains Tyr in the Pl' position, the nsP2mediated cleavage sites in the alphavirus polyprotein are composed of Gly, Ala, and Cys residues . For cleavage sites recognized by HC-Pro, ~48, and nsP2, the residues occupying the P2 positions have been shown to be necessary for substrate function Shirako and Strauss, 1990; this study) . Like the cellular cysteinetype proteinases, the interaction of residues at the substrate P2 and binding pocket S2 sites appears to play a dominant role in promoting the processing reaction.
