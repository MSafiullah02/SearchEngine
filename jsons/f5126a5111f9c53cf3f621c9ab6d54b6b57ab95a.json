By use of Western blot analysis, indirect immunofluorescence assay (IFA), and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), antigenic cross-reactivity between severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and 2 HCoVs (229E and OC43) was demonstrated in immunized animals and human serum.

However, 100% of the samples from 34 patients with SARS had antibody responses to HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, and SARS-CoV. In healthy donors, the results of the IFA showed the presence of antibodies in response to the nucleocapsid proteins of HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43 in association with the presence of IgG antibodies to both HCoVs, but antibodies to SARS-CoV were absent in all samples except 1, which had a low antibody titer of 1:10, compared with the usual antibody titer of at least 1:100 in most patients with SARS.

In our previous studies, neither specific monoclonal nor polyclonal antibodies to the nucleocapsid protein of SARS-CoV crossreacted with HCoV-229E or HCoV-OC43 [8, 10] . However, a previous study has described cross-reactivity between the nucleocapsid proteins of SARS-CoV and those of group I CoVs [4] . This cross-reactivity may depend on the type of serum used. Another investigator has demonstrated that HCoV-229E-immune animal serum cross-reacted with SARS-CoV [1] . In the present study, when we used immunofluorescent staining of CoV-infected cells, HCoV-229E-and HCoV-OC43-immune rabbit serum did not cross-react with SARS-CoV-infected cells, whereas SARS-CoV-immune rabbit serum had moderate crossreactivity with HCoV-229E-infected cells and weak cross-reactivity with HCoV-OC43-infected cells. Although SARS-CoVimmune rabbit serum that had high antibody titers for SARS-CoV was slightly contaminated with antibodies to host cell components, it is apparent that the serum had cross-reactivity with HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43. In addition, the IFA showed that HCoV-OC43-immune rabbit serum had strong cross-reactivity with HCoV-229E. This cross-reactivity has been observed by some investigators [11, 12] but not by others [13, 14] .

Therefore, it is expected that the antibodies to HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43 found in the serum samples from patients with SARS either preexisted or were cross-reacting antibodies to HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43. Further studies of this issue are warranted. The IFA showed that paired serum samples exhibited a \u04434-fold increase in antibody titers against HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43 in 5 of 11 and 10 of 11 patients with SARS, respectively. Such a high antibody titer response to the known HCoVs in patients with SARS may represent an anamnestic reaction to previous infections with the 2 known HCoVs or other CoVs or a crossreaction between SARS-CoV and HCoV-229E or HCoV-OC43. However, the nucleocapsid protein-based ELISA detected increases in antibody titers in only 2 of 11 paired serum samples from patients with SARS when the nucleocapsid protein of HCoV-229E was used as an antigen, and they had a consistently increased signal reaction to the nucleocapsid protein from HCoV-229E-infected cell culture filtrate by Western blot analysis ( figure 1C ). Paired serum samples from patients with SARS showed no consistent increase in antibody titers in the HCoV-OC43 nucleocapsid protein-based ELISA and no increase in signal reaction to the nucleocapsid protein from HCoV-OC43infected cell culture filtrate by Western blot analysis. These results confirm the suggestion that the major antigenic crossreactivity with HCoV-OC43 in the convalescent-phase serum samples of patients with SARS is due not to nucleocapsid proteins but to other viral components. Although the paired serum samples from patients with SARS showed a partial cross-reaction to HCoV-229E, there was no significant close correlation between the IFA titer ratios, which were determined in response to whole virus-infected cells, and the ELISA titer ratios, which were determined in response to nucleocapsid proteins. Furthermore, antibodies to SARS-CoV could be detected in only 1 serum sample from a healthy donor by either IFA or nucleocapsid protein-based Western blot analysis, even though patients with SARS had antibodies to HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43.

Western blot results showed clear and specific bands at molecular weight (MW) positions 47, 44, and 50 kDa, corresponding to the recombinant nucleocapsid proteins of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-associated coronavirus (CoV) (lane 1), human CoV (HCoV)-229E (lane 2), and HCoV-OC43 (lane 3). B, Western blot analysis of the antigenicities of recombinant nucleocapsid proteins. Left, Nucleocapsid protein of SARS-CoV with SARS-CoV-immune rabbit serum (lane 1), monoclonal antibody to the nucleocapsid protein of SARS-CoV (lane 2), HCoV-229E-immune rabbit serum (lane 3), HCoV-OC43-immune rabbit serum (lane 4), and nonimmune rabbit serum (lane 5). Center, Nucleocapsid protein of HCoV-229E with HCoV-229E-immune rabbit serum (lane 1), monoclonal antibody to the nucleocapsid protein of HCoV-229E (lane 2), SARS-CoVimmune rabbit serum (lane 3), HCoV-OC43-immune rabbit serum (lane 4), and nonimmune rabbit serum (lane 5). Right, Nucleocapsid protein of HCoV-OC43 with HCoV-OC43-immune rabbit serum (lane 1), monoclonal antibody to the nucleocapsid protein of HCoV-OC43 (lane 2), SARS-CoV-immune rabbit serum (lane 3), HCoV-229E-immune rabbit serum (lane 4), and nonimmune rabbit serum (lane 5). All bands appear at the proper MW position. C, Western blot analysis of the HCoV-229E culture filtrates with paired serum samples from patients with SARS (lanes 1-5), HCoV-229E-immune rabbit serum (lane 6), HCoV-OC43-immune rabbit serum (lane 7), and monoclonal antibody to the nucleocapsid protein of HCoV-229E (lane 8). Lanes 4b (patient 4) and 5b (patient 7), which show results of convalescent-phase serum samples from 2 patients with SARS who had high titers in the HCoV-229E nucleocapsid protein-based ELISA, exhibit prominent immunoreactive bands at \u223c44 kDa. Reactions with specific monoclonal antibody to the nucleocapsid protein of HCoV-229E are visible at the same MW. Three pairs of acute-and convalescent-phase serum samples had the same reactive band at \u223c44 kDa (lane 1, patient 10; lane 2, patient 8; lane 3, patient 3).
