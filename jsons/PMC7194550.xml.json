            "text": "In late December 2019, a previously unidentified coronavirus, currently named as the 2019 novel coronavirus emerged from Wuhan, China, and resulted in a formidable outbreak in many cities in China1 which then spread globally. A large number of healthcare workers caring for Covid-19 patients were infected and some have died. The current advice is to take pragmatic decision making, suggests non-operative management of many injuries and reduced face to face follow up.2 The spread of SARS-CoV-2 is predominantly via droplets (aerosol), but also via direct contact with contaminated surfaces (fomites). Any personal prophylaxis needs to consider both these modes. Furthermore, one needs to consider the viral load to which the health worker is exposed which in turn influences the severity of disease, if acquired.3 In orthopedic surgical procedures, surgical power tools, such as electrocautery, bone saws, reamers and drills, are commonly used that has shown to produce aerosol4\n. It has been postulated that virus transmission can happen through blood aerosol infecting the health care professionals.5 We describe the current practice that we have adopted to reduce the aerosol production while treating patients surgically.",

Avoid using broach but if it has to be used, use with caution and consider placing a wet swab over visible cancellous bone to catch blood droplets. Femoral canal should be sucked and dried properly with moist gauze before implantation to prevent splash of particles or blood.-For irrigation use saline in a syringe. Avoid using pulse lavage.-Open surgery must be avoided If there is an option of doing the procedure percutaneously, like cannulated screw fixation of hip.\n",
