In this state of crisis, clinicians and other medical professionals are the frontline workers managing the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic. To prevent viral exposure and its further spread, clinicians are required to use standard personal protective equipment (PPE). However, several healthcare workers are experiencing a lack of PPE. Certain procedures such as intubation and extubation operations are particularly susceptible to generate potentially infectious aerosols that could infect medical personnel [1] . Therefore, to prevent aerosol-mediated viral infection during intubation/extubation procedures, Robert Canelli et al recently invented an \"aerosol box\" [2] . It is a barrier that can be easily fabricated and could help to protect clinicians from aerosol infection during intubation/extubation procedure. It consists of a transparent plastic cube that covers a patient's head and two circular ports through which a clinician could pass their hands to perform airway procedures.",
