An indigenous government\u2019s attempts to deny the presence of a biological threat stemmed from concerns about inciting public panic, from the threat\u2019s perceived effects on the economy and tourism, and from a lack of official understanding of the threat.\u2022 Prosecution of individuals, organizations, and companies occurred for a variety of reasons, including failure of a government official to handle an event properly, unauthorized dissemination of information, profiteering, and disregard of orders to quarantine.

This kind of knowledge cannot be obtained by relying solely on regional, national, and international media reports. We observed remarkable similarity in social disruption parameters across biological events that involved different pathogens affecting humans. This similarity was also seen across multiple countries and time periods. Conversely, our initial observations suggest that there is some variation in the social disruption caused by biological events not only across diseases, but also across countries. We hypothesize that this variation is likely due to differences in social tolerance for disruption, the sophistication of public health and medical infrastructures, and the direct effects of the disease in question. We have observed that biological events taking place in countries with limited infrastructure may progress to higher stages more quickly than those occurring in countries with more robust infrastructure. One disease in particular\u2014influenza-like illness\u2014consistently defied countermeasures across multiple countries with a wide range of medical sophistication.

Conversely, if the cause of an indication and warning, such as rioting, is not verified, an analyst may be falsely alarmed by it and thus may assign a higher stage level than is necessary. We propose that our categories of recurrence, elevation, and diversification, along with proper contextualization of indications and warnings, will allow for more precise categorization of a biological event.
