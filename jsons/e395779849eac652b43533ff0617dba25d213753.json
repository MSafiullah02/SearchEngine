In both of these cases spontaneous eye disease can complicate experimental or toxicologic work. In addition, ocular lesions in rodents and specifically the rat may often be associated with systemic diseases of importance, both for the individual animal and for the experimental colony. Thus, ocular disease in this species has importance both from a scientific, a laboratory management and an animal welfare perspective. In addition, the rat can make a friendly and intelligent pet, and as such more and more people are keeping rats as pets. They may, in this context, be presented to the veterinarian and, of course, to the veterinary ophthalmologist, should an ocular condition be diagnosed. It is thus important that veterinary ophthalmologists are aware of the range of ocular lesions seen in this species and of possible therapeutic options in such cases.",

Understanding the unusual phenomenon of red tear production in this less familiar species demands comprehension of basic anatomy and physiology of tear production in the rat, as well as pathologic changes in disease. Seeing disease in the context of normal physiologic processes is a key point in the investigation of any ocular disease in any species, but perhaps this is particularly so regarding disease involving an unusual process in a less familiar species. For chromodacryorrhoea, investigation requires the consideration of a number of factors, both infectious and noninfectious, which contribute to excess porphyrin production in the rat Harderian gland, the underlying problem in chromodacryorhoea.",

            "text": "The rat eye has three tear-producing glands: the intraorbital, the extraorbital and the Harderian, the latter associated with the third eyelid. Studies in basic biology show that the rat, in common with a number of rodent species, normally produces porphyrin-pigmented and lipid-laden tears predominantly from the Harderian gland. 1,2 This production is controlled by parasympathetic innervation and can be prevented by the parasympatholytic action of atropine. 3 Thus, factors which increase parasympathetic drive increase the level of Harderian porphyrin production and can cause chromodacryorrhoea, the overflow of red tears. These stain both the periorbital fur and the fur of the front paws, since rats regularly wipe their eyes with their front paws. Diseases such as mycoplasmosis and silalodacryoadenitis, considered further below, are important causes of chromodacryorrhoea. Thus, red periocular staining in a group of laboratory animals, or less commonly in pet rats, should be a warning sign of potentially severe systemic disease. Other predisposing factors include nutritional deficiencies or other physiologic stresses. It might appear somewhat anomalous that stressors, which must surely increase sympathetic innervation, aggravate a parasympathetically mediated condition. A further influencing factor is prolonged light exposure. As will be discussed further below, prolonged exposure to artificial light has several deleterious effects on the rat eye. One of these is Harderian gland pathology with swelling and necrosis. 4, 5 Porphyrin content is reported to be decreased in these circumstances, but photodynamic effects of Harderian gland porphyrins have damaging effects and photic injury is considered to be a key pathogenic route in ocular surface damage in prolonged light exposure. 6 Another feature of the rat orbit, important particularly from a laboratory animal perspective, is that of the retrobulbar venous sinus, used for blood collection. A 23-g hypodermic needle or capillary tube can be inserted under the upper eyelid at the lateral canthus and directed medially while compressing the jugular vein (Fig. 2) . This procedure can be performed many times in experienced hands without apparent detriment. 7 Other reports, however, have suggested that postbleeding exophthalmos is seen, 8 that hemorrhages and subsequent inflammatory foci are found in the puncture track 9 and that dark focal areas in the nasal fundus subsequent to orbital bleeding may be sequelae of orbital hemorrhage. 6 This may be related to intraspecies differences: the anatomy of the orbital venous drainage is different in the rat from several other rodents. 9 While the large sinus in the hamster, gerbil and mouse is easily sampled, the smaller plexus of the rat renders sampling less satisfactory and many consider that the lateral tail vein should be used in preference. In addition to the relatively minor clinical signs after bleeding noted above, more substantial inflammatory disease with subsequent necrosis of the Harderian gland has been reported as associated with orbital bleeding in rats. 10 This inflammatory disease can be distinguished from that associated with the sialodacryoadenitis (SDA) virus by its localization: foci of inflammation are seen in acini adjacent to the extraocular muscles rather than the generalized nature of inflammation in SDA as discussed further below.",

Here conjunctivitis and periorbital swelling are the first signs, followed by sneezing and cervical swelling, this last sign associated with both lymphoadenopathy and salivary gland swelling. This condition is highly contagious and yet is generally selflimiting. These two characteristics mean that the subacute or chronic form is commonly seen throughout colonies rather than an acute form of the disease. The classic epizootic disease, first described in 1961, 15 has high morbidity and low or absent mortality. Nevertheless, it is clearly a major problem in an otherwise pathogen-free colony. Ocular signs may be primary but are often secondary to reduced tear production associated with reactive lacrimal gland hyperplasia. Considerable ductal squamous metaplasia together with periacinar fibrosis occurs during gland repair after inflammation. It is these changes which result in subsequent lacrimal inadequacy. 16 Resulting keratitis and conjunctivitis lead to chromodacryorrhoea and self-mutilation with attendant further periorbital swelling. The lesions seen in this disease are a manifestation of the reaction between host and infectious agent in the context of the conditions in which the animal is housed. Thus, the disease varies between different strains 17 and in different environments. 18 Experimentally immunosuppressed animals had delayed onset of signs with less glandular damage, but also a longer time to resolution of lesions. 19 While this may seem of purely academic interest, these findings have important clinical implications. The introduction of a naive group of rats to a subclinically affected animal house, with the attendant mild immunosuppression linked with moving and rehousing, may provoke a clinical onset of acute disease in these animals. This can result in prolonged shedding of virus, further compromising the situation in an infected colony. Diagnosis of the disease is normally readily achieved through observation of classic pathognomonic signs, but detection of coronavirus antigen or serologic testing of animals are also possible if confirmation is required. 20 Widespread serologic testing has shown the agent to be present in 45% of colonies within the UK, although incidence of overt disease is lower, as might be expected of a chronic subclinical infection. 21",

This mineralization, seen between 7 and 26 weeks of age, was reported in some rats to be manifest as fine basophilic granules at the interface between epithelium and stroma, while in others a coarser deposit was noted in either the subepithelial stroma or in the epithelium itself. [26] [27] [28] Another paper compared similar dystrophic corneal mineralization in different strains of mice, finding 26% of DBA, 16% of C3H and 10% of Balb/c mice to have mineralized opacity. 29 The authors suggested in this report that these lesions were caused by excess ammonia in cage bedding. Another report comparing corneal degeneration in different rat strains in the same environment demonstrated calcium deposition in the subepithelial stroma of the interpalpebral cornea in Wistar and Sprague-Dawley but not Lewis and Long-Evans strains. 30 While the interpalpebral location of the lesion suggests that environmental factors are important, the interstrain variation suggests that genetic factors in addition to environmental influences are responsible for this corneal lesion. None of these animals showed any clinical abnormalities and thus it might be suggested that this is not of particular importance. From a research perspective, however, they are significant; findings of superior stromal calcium deposition in otherwise normal rodent eyes need to be taken into consideration when evaluating pathologic change in research models.",

The lack of reports thus suggests that the incidence is probably truly low compared, for instance, with the guinea pig where a substantial number of cases of dermoid have been reported. [33] [34] [35] [36] Uveal disease Anterior uveal disease in the rat involves either congenital anomalies or inflammatory disease. The former include keratolenticular adhesions, as discussed above with regard to microphthalmos or persistence of the pupillary vasculature. Intraocular inflammatory disease may originate in the uvea or arise secondary to corneal perforation. Keratoconjunctivitis may cause such intraocular penetration with associated panuveitis if very severe. Staphylococcal or Streptococcal infections have been implicated in such intraocular spread of disease. 37, 38 Some studies report a high incidence of inflammatory lesions in the anterior segment of rats and suggest it is the most common ophthalmic condition in these animals (Fig. 5) .",

These tumors have been seen in asbestos chrysolite-treated and ethyl acrylate-treated toxicology study rats, but also significantly in control animals. Such a study shows the importance of viewing toxicologic findings in the context of spontaneous disease. It may be that these lesions are a spontaneous finding and not a toxic change. Spontaneous intraocular melanomas have been reported in both eyes of one Sprague-Dawley rat, 39 although in this report no confirmatory histopathologic evidence was presented. Schwannomas involving the iris, ciliary body and choroid have been reported in two Sprague-Dawley rats. 40 In humans the choroid and ciliary body are the prime sites for involvement with this neoplasm and in one of the animals reported here the iris and ciliary body were affected while in the other the choroid was also involved. Here immunohistochemical detection of neurofilament and S-100 protein antigens showed the neoplasm to be neural in origin. 40 Glaucoma While noninvasive measurement of intraocular pressure is impossible in the mouse, the rat has an eye which is at, but not beyond, the limits of modern tonometry. 41 Applanation tonometry using the Tonopen applanation tonometer gave the mean intraocular pressure in Lewis rats as 13.9 \u00b1 4.2 mmHg. This figure may not be accurate for other strains of rat, since a recent study has shown significant differences in intraocular pressure between different strains of mice. 41 Accurate measurements have yet to be reported for different strains of rat, but until they are some caution should be exercised in extrapolating from one rat strain to another. 42 Glaucoma has been reported in rats (Fig. 6) . [43] [44] [45] However, the failure of aqueous drainage was not primary in most cases, but rather caused by persistent pupillary membranes causing a pupilblock glaucoma, or peripheral anterior synechiae causing an angle-closure glaucoma.",

At 5 to 6 weeks of age persistence of the hyaloid vasculature is regularly seen; a single vessel may be present but three to four branches of the hyaloid artery are more commonly seen traversing the vitreous posteriorly from the posterior lens capsule. These vessels regress over the proceeding months but during this period considerable vitreal hemorrhage may occur. Unless very marked, these hemorrhages resolve leaving few remnants. Yellow to brown pigment may, however, remain as hemorrhage is removed by vitreal macrophages. Other posterior segment vascular anomalies include preretinal loops, with 12% of rats in one study having such an anomaly. 52 Saccular aneurysms of the retinal vessels have been reported as being a common finding in older laboratory rodents (Fig. 10) , and while these might be considered to be congenital, the time point at which they occur is not clear. 52 Tortuosity of retinal vessels together with preretinal arteriolar loops have also been noted as common retinal abnormalities in CD and Sprague-Dawley rats, 53 sometimes with associated preretinal hemorrhages. The other congenital posterior segment defect seen relatively commonly is the coloboma (Fig. 11) . Typical (i.e. 6 o'clock) colobomas of the optic disc with or without peripapillary choroidal involvement were found in 0.5% of Sprague-Dawley rats in one study 54 while other workers have reported a lower incidence. 55 Optic disc colobomata may be associated with a cystic microphthalmos, 56 while a small number are associated with iridal colobomas but no other ocular defects. 57, 58 While some retinal lesions seen in young laboratory rodents might be considered congenital, careful examination shows their incidence to rise with increasing age in rat pups. One such lesion is a sharply demarcated pale linear retinal defect seen in young rat pups. Incidence increases from 0.3% in weanling rats to 3% at 14 weeks of age. Thus, these should probably be considered as early acquired lesions. Hubert and colleagues describe them histopathologically as focal outer retinal thinning rather than the generalized photoreceptor loss found in the dystrophic animals noted below. 59 Other workers have, however, described these lesions as retinal dystrophy 60 or degeneration. 61 One study has suggested that the focal atrophy represents retinal detachment and reattachment. 62 Retinal degenerations may be seen in rats either as an inherited lesion or an environmentally induced defect. This dichotomy shows the importance of understanding the background of environmentally induced ocular disease when investigating an inherited defect as a model of human retinal degeneration.",

            "text": "First described by Noell in rats under constant illumination, light-induced retinal degeneration has now been studied extensively in rats and more recently also in mice of different strains. 63, 64 This condition can occur in albino rats exposed to as little as 2 to 3 weeks constant illumination with fluorescent or incandescent lights. Environmental and body temperature is important in defining the rate of degeneration, as is age at onset of photic damage. Even in standard lighting, over one tenth of 2-year-old rats were found to have lesions, although the relationship between light-induced and agerelated retinal degeneration is not particularly well substantiated. Retinal changes such as alterations in vessel caliber, fundic reflectivity and optic disc pallor can be observed ophthalmoscopically after 7 days of continuous light but electroretinography demonstrates changes after only 1 day of this light regime. 65 Measurement of pupil diameter also shows alterations at an earlier stage than does fundoscopy and is useful, given that it is more readily achieved than electroretinography. The diagnosis of this phototoxic change can be substantiated by noting simple correlates of the disease such as increased degeneration in animals in top cages in a stack, or in clear plastic-roofed as opposed to metaltopped cages. Now that the problem is well understood and widely known, the most common cause of photic retinal damage is a malfunction in light timing switches caused by mechanical faults or simply through human error. Even given the understanding of the etiolopathogenesis of this condition it can all too easily complicate and confuse retinal research: the changes seen in the WAG/Rij rat were first thought to be an inherited degeneration 66 but later discounted as a light-induced retinal change. 67 Interestingly, even in strains with a defined inherited trait, light has a significant effect. In the RCS rat, discussed further below, environmental light levels have a profound effect on the rate of degenerative change, dark-reared animals having significantly less severe and more protracted degenerative processes than those kept in the light. 68 Inherited retinal degenerations in rodents have played a considerable role in developing our understanding of retinal function and lesions of retinitis pigmentosa in humans. While the rd and rds mice have perhaps led the field, the rat has had an important part to play also. One of the first conditions fully investigated was retinal degeneration in the Royal College of Surgeons (RCS) rat. 69 This model is characterized by degeneration of rod outer segments from around 2 weeks postnatally when outer segment debris accumulates between photoreceptors and the RPE. Chimeric RCS/wild type rats showed that the cause of retinal disease lies in the pigment epithelium and not the neurosensory retina: photoreceptors adjacent to normal RPE developed normally while those for which mutant RCS RPE provided phagocytotyic function were seen to degenerate. 70 Subsequent in vitro studies have confirmed this finding. 71 Other neuroretinal degenerations in the rat include the photoreceptor degeneration in the Osbourne-Mendel rat, 72 but these have not been investigated to the same extent as analogous conditions in the rd and rds mouse. They are also not as widespread in the rat population as the mouse mutations, which can often be the cause of blindness in experimental mouse populations. 73, 74 With regard to optic nerve lesions, as with retinal appearance there is a wide normal variation, with changes such as pigment anomalies being within the normal variation in some strains (Fig. 12) . Colobomas have already been discussed above but complete optic nerve hypoplasia or aplasia is also seen as a congenital defect, 75 this possibly occurring secondary to local circulatory abnormalities. 76 Optic nerve degenerations have also been reported to have a nutritional etiologic component in F344 rats, 77 but again the differentiation between a degenerate lesion and a congenital one can be difficult to make. Papilledema has been reported to occur in spontaneously hypertensive rats 78 and other fundus lesions associated with hypertension have included a red choroidal glow, presumably associated with generalized vessel engorgement (M. Davidson, personal communication).",
