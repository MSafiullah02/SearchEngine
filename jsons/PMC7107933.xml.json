FDA premarket and postmarket activities are administratively organized around centers, with the Center for Drug Evaluation and Research (CDER), Center for Biologics, Evaluation, and Research (CBER), and Center for Devices and Radiological Health (CDRH) bearing most of the responsibility for patient diagnosis and treatment. CDRH, through the Division of Microbiology Devices, in the Office of In Vitro Diagnostic Device Evaluation and Safety has regulatory responsibility for in vitro diagnostic devices (IVDs) intended for use in the diagnosis of almost all infectious diseases, including respiratory tract infections. The specific regulations that guide FDA are defined under Title 21 of the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR); in this overview, we highlight both the elements of the CFR relevant to in vitro microbiology diagnostic devices as well as how FDA approaches the review of microbiology device applications for respiratory infections.

In contrast, the analytical and clinical reference methods for influenza A are identical since the presence of influenza A is always considered abnormal.

Because a clinical reference method cannot include the new device in its ascertainment, methods such as polymerase chain reaction (PCR) followed by bidirectional DNA sequencing may be necessary to confirm test performance. Similar concerns exist for assays that differentiate subtypes of novel influenza, a disease where diagnostics are essential but where relatively few clinical specimens are available for confirming performance. There are recent FDA guidances that are useful in aiding companies in developing valid comparators. One is a draft guidance on establishing the performance of an influenza IVD [4], whereas the other two guidances are special controls guidances: one for multiplex devices for respiratory viral pathogens [2] and the other for multiplex devices for influenza A subtyping [3].",

For example, in a study of novel H1N1 influenza, it is the percent of patients that both test positive by the new device and are positive via the reference assay divided by the number of patients positive by the reference assay. Low test sensitivity reflects less security with the results of a negative test; that is, patients with the disease may be falsely labeled as negative by the new assay. (This fundamental consideration, i.e., \u2014equating \u201canalyte not detected\u201d with the absence of disease [or the analyte]\u2014is a common misinterpretation that bedevils the clinical use of devices with imperfect sensitivity.). Specificity is the converse; that is, the probability that the new device will have a negative test result given that the clinical reference method is negative. Specificity is estimated in the pivotal study by the fraction of subjects that are negative by the new test among those that are negative by the clinical reference method. Higher specificity yields greater confidence in a positive result. It is important to recognize that although patients included in specificity calculations do not have the disease of interest, in most cases they are still symptomatic (depending on the specific IU for the test); asymptomatic subjects would not be considered part of the IU population for such a device and therefore would not be appropriate for use in a specificity calculation.",

(For example, a benchmark reference standard for aspergillosis infection may include galactomannan as part of the definition of aspergillosis infection in certain populations, even in the absence of invasive procedures to document infection.). Identical statistical calculations can be used in this setting but are interpreted as being positive and negative percent agreement rather than sensitivity and specificity; these considerations are also described in FDA guidance [1]. Percent agreement estimates may be misleading as similar devices can both be in error; for example, 100% agreement between two similar devices would be unlikely to indicate the new device has perfect clinical sensitivity/specificity were the clinical truth available.",

In a clinical study with only 5 specimens positive for a specific pathogen (via the reference method) and an observed sensitivity of 5/5 (100%) results in a lower confidence bound of only 55.6%, meaning diagnostic performance is very uncertain. Even for a test with perfect sensitivity, at least 35 patients with the condition of interest would be needed to yield a 95% lower bound greater than 90%. In a pivotal study for devices to detect more common conditions, it is not uncommon to see a sample size of 50 or more patients that are positive via the reference method.
