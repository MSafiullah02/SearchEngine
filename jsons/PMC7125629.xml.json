This molecule is present in the root and consists of an aglycon (a pentacyclic triterpenic structure) bound to two glucuronic acid molecules (Andersen, 2007). GL has anti-inflammatory, antiallergenic, antihepatotoxic, antiulcer and antiviral properties (Aly et al., 2005, Jo et al., 2005, Ploeger et al., 2000). Furthermore, GL is one of the leading natural compounds for clinical trials in recent studies on chronic viral hepatitis and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infections (Arase et al., 1997, De Simone et al., 2001, Fiore et al., 2008). Chronic consumption of GL prevents the development of hepatic carcinoma from C hepatitis and the antiviral activity of GL against SARS associated corona virus has been demonstrated in vitro (Nassiri-Asl & Hosseinzadeh, 2008). Finally, GL finds application in inhibiting unwanted effects of contraceptive formulations, such as alterations in blood coagulation and thrombosis (St\u00e4hli et al., 2007).",

This technique utilises template molecules to assemble their own recognition sites by interacting with complementary functional groups of appropriate monomers. In this process, the selected template molecules are first allowed to establish binding interactions with functional monomers in a porogenic solvent. The resulting complexes are then copolymerised with an excess of cross-linkersin the presence of a free radical initiator. Subsequent removal of the template molecules creates specific binding sites with the precise spatial arrangement of the functional groups in the polymer network together with the shape. Thus, reversible re-binding and high selective recognition of the target molecules are realised (Nicholls et al., 2009, Puoci et al., 2009).",

GA, indeed, is the non sugar component of GL and it is not found in the freed form in the liquorice extracts, in which the main component is GL. In this study, GL imprinted polymers were synthesized by employing methacrylic acid (MAA), 2-hydroxyethylmetacrylate (HEMA) or 2-(dimethylamino)ethyl methacrylate (DMAEM) as functional monomers and Ethylene glycol dimethacrylate (EGDMA) as crosslinker. After the evaluation of the imprinting efficiency, a SPE protocol was optimised and applied for the selective extraction of GL form liquorice root without any preliminary treatment of the sample. A very straight-forward protocol was developed, involving the direct HPLC injection of eluate fractions without any treatment. The pre-treatment of the sample consists only of a crushing step and a soxhlet extraction. In all the steps, no toxic and biocompatible organic solvents were used.",

The resultant bulk rigid polymers were crushed, grounded into powder and sieved through a 63 nm stainless steel sieve. The sieved MIP materials were collected and the very fine powder, suspended in the supernatant solution (acetone), was discarded. The resultant MIP materials were soxhlet extracted with 200 ml of an ethanol/acetic acid (8/2 v/v) mixture for at least 48 h, followed by 200 ml of ethanol for others 48 h. The extracted MIP materials were dried in an oven at 60 \u00b0C overnight. The washed MIP materials were checked to be free of GL and any other compound by HPLC analysis.",

Three millilitres of the prepared loading solution was employed to load the cartridges which almost completely absorb GL (Fig. 3\na). Thus, in order to obtain a satisfactory clean-up of the template, the washing solvent was applied on the cartridges and the GL amount in the washing fractions determined. In the washing chromatogram of MIP cartridges (Fig. 3b), not so relevant peaks were observed at the retention time of GL, confirming the selective interaction between polymers and template. The GL amount in this fractions represents about the 20% of the loaded one. Furthermore, an important clean-up of the extracted mixture was obtained, as showed by the presence of several peaks referable to the others compounds of the sample.",
