Depending on the country, lockdown measures may include mandatory geographic quarantines, shelter-in-place requirements (except to buy food and access vital health services), closing certain types of businesses, or banning events and gatherings [9] . These social controls can hinder or delay PLWH's access to HIV care and support at hospital or clinic sites. For instance, a study conducted in China found that 32.6% of PLWHs were at risk of discontinuing ART and about 48.6% did not know where to get needed medications due to COVID-19 lockdown measures [4] . In SSA, the effect of travel restrictions on PLWHs could be even more detrimental given the long distances they must often travel to access treatment and care due to the limited availability of specialized HIV services, preferences for higher-tiered facilities, and efforts to mitigate social stigma surrounding treatment [10, 11] .",

For instance, in Liberia during the Ebola crisis, rice prices increased by more than 30% and cassava prices rose to 150%; in China, food prices have increased by 20% during the COVID-19 pandemic [21] . In Tanzania, PLWHs who rely on periodic farming and cultivation jobs are breaking social distancing requirements to earn money for food, putting this immunocompromised population at even greater risk of COVID-19 infection [19] . To reduce food insecurity, some SSA countries (e.g., Rwanda, Uganda and Nigeria) have combined restrictive measures with food distribution services for vulnerable communities. However, some of these distribution services may not adhere to social distancing guidelines. In fact, in many SSA countries, vulnerable communities congregate at food distribution centers, increasing their risk of acquiring and spreading COVID-19. COVID-19 prevention and containment strategies, while necessary, are exacerbating difficulties related to the treatment and support of PLWHs in SSA: a vulnerable population in a largely under-resourced environment. We thus identify and discuss three cost-effective strategies for supporting psychosocial health and ART adherence among this population while complying with the current social controls implemented to slow the spread of COVID-19.",

A recent systematic review found that treatment supporter interventions in SSA significantly improved ART adherence and virologic suppression among adult PLWHs compared to the standard of care [16] .

Unlike food distribution services, which often occur at centralized locations requiring people to congregate, cash transfers provide individuals with the means to purchase food while adhering to social distancing requirements. Mobile money platforms, which allow recipients to transfer money electronically without leaving their quarantine space, offers another useful application of digital technology (e.g. mobile phones) under quarantine conditions. Encouragingly, prior HIV treatment literature in SSA suggests that cash transfers are associated with PLWH's ART adherence even when no social distancing regulations exist [26, 27] .",

We believe these services would be most effective when deployed in concert. For instance, patient-nominated treatment supporters can assist with medication pickup, delivery, and reminders, while health worker-nominated treatment supporters send text messages about health check-ups and tips for self-care via mobile phones. Non-profit and government organizations supporting PLWHs can leverage mobile money platforms to transfer cash that patient-nominated treatment supporters can use to buy nutritious food for PLWHs. Collectively, these strategies offer a cost-effective and COVID-19-compliant program for promoting the health and ART adherence of PLWHs in SSA even after the present coronavirus pandemic has passed.",
