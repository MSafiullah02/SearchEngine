In Europe, the first guideline on CAP was released in 1998 by the European Respiratory Society (ERS); in 2001, an ERS task force released an expert review on VAP, followed by clinical practice guidelines (CPGs) on HAP/VAP in 2009 [3\u20135]. These early CPGs were based primarily on experts\u2019 opinion, derived from clinical experience. Since the first editions, several versions of the guidelines were released, and throughout the years the infectious diseases societies joined the respiratory, thoracic, and intensive care medicine associations, to release shared documents.",

Recommendations are based on literature analysis and experts\u2019 opinion and, depending on the quality of the reviewed literature, recommendations with different strength are made. With the GRADE method, the quality of literature can be downgraded, based on the presence of important limitations, inconsistencies or publications bias, or upgraded if a large magnitude effect is recognized [6, 7].",

Our hypothesis was that the majority of recommendations, in spite of efforts to review evidence, are based on moderate/low-quality evidence.

In the infectious diseases field, with rare diseases and heterogeneous clinical presentations, conducting RCTs might be difficult, lowering the overall quality of evidence. A study conducted on IDSA guidelines from 1994 to 2010 found that only 14% of the recommendations were linked to high-quality evidence (level of evidence A in the original article, based on RCTs), while the majority of the recommendations relied on expert opinion and case studies [17]. In HAP and VAP, despite being common hospital-acquired infections and a major concern for morbidity and mortality in intensive care unit [18, 19, 22], the involvement of critically ill patients might represent a limitation for conducting interventional studies and to generalize conclusions from observational cohorts in non-critically ill patients. Individual recommendations issued in guidelines may not always be supported by high-quality evidence, and evidence-based medicine practice should be based on profound knowledge of CPGs and literature, to properly evaluate bedside patient management.",

The majority of recommendations were issued on HAP/VAP treatment. In HAP and VAP, often caused by multidrug-resistant pathogens, the delay in appropriate antimicrobial treatment represents a poor prognostic factor and is mainly driven by the pathogen extended resistance pattern itself [23\u201327]. Appropriate antibiotic treatment is hence pivotal and challenging. The majority of treatment recommendations regarded antibiotic choice and duration (data not shown), addressing key bedside clinical decisions. Nonetheless, for HAP/VAP treatment, none of the recommendations issued was based on high-quality evidence. The majority of evidence was rated low and very low, and only a third of strong recommendations was supported by moderate quality of evidence. The lack of a gold standard for HAP/VAP diagnosis and the geographical and in-hospital variability of etiology and antimicrobial susceptibility are partly responsible for the lack of high-quality evidence supporting these practices (Table 4). Interventional studies on general hygiene measures, effectiveness of epidemiological surveillance, and collateral care, such as bed positioning, might be performed with less difficulties, explaining the greater quantity of high-quality evidence recorded in HAP/VAP prevention. These data point out the need of collaboration to realize large RCTs, increasing the quality of evidence.",

Our study results reinforce the importance of literature knowledge to accurately translate CPGs and their recommendations in clinical practice and represent a call of wide collaboration to realize well-designed research in treatment, diagnosis, and prevention of HAP and VAP. Importantly, some clinical questions cannot be answered with high-quality evidence, because the clinical questions themselves are too complex and the antibiotic resistance profiles are profoundly different between sites and keep evolving. Furthermore, among the earliest HAP/VAP guidelines in the pre-GRADE era, with the possible exception of single antibiotic coverage for patients with Pseudomonas aeruginosa and shock absence, few recommendations based on lower grade of evidence were revised by subsequent studies. This implies the pivotal importance of high-quality studies in areas where there is a high degree of uncertainty, with potential adverse implications.",

Since then, new evidence might have been published on the addressed topic. Most CPGs are updated in periods longer than 5 years, with difficult incorporation of emerging evidence until next iteration. Published literature should be periodically reassessed, to update CPGs references and recommendations, creating a dynamic document. The creation of an adaptation framework for integration of new evidence in CPGs [30] would avoid outdated recommendations and will improve implementation in clinical practice. Second, literature supporting each recommendation was not revised and quality of evidence was not reassessed. Evidence and recommendation rating analyses were based on the classification reported in original papers, with no changes in the rating assigned to the literature by CPGs writing committees. Lastly, CPGs on HAP/VAP issued by other scientific societies without explicitly reported recommendations or quality of evidence assessment were excluded from the analysis. Despite these limitations, there are important strengths. The study provides a detailed analysis of quality of evidence used to write HAP/VAP international guidelines, an important evaluation in evidence-based medicine. The results point out the difficulty of performing RCTs and providing high-quality evidence in critically ill patients. Areas in which higher quality evidence are scarce reveal research opportunities, to assess unmet clinical needs in HAP/VAP management.",
