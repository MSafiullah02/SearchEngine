When\ninformation flows freely and the reality of risk is thereby revealed, there follows\nwhat Ulrich Beck has called \u201ccosmopolitan force\u201d: a sense of the necessity of\ninternational coordination in the face of shared risk engenders a convergent\ninternational politics where divergent national interests are unified by shared\nworries about universal risks (Beck, 2009). Because responding to risk first entails knowing risk, on\nthis account, global political realignments are necessarily an expression of\ntransformed knowledge of risk.",

One of its animating questions is whether a\nconstitutional repertoire is adequate or appropriate to the task of ordering global\nlaw and policy (Krisch,\n2010; Walker,\n2008).2\nMy project is different. I seek to illuminate through two case studies, the subtle\nbut consequential position that scientific authority occupies in an emerging,\ninformal (and thus not explicitly formalized) repertoire of global\nconstitutionalism. Whereas a focus on formal law takes formal jurisdictional\nauthority as a central concern, asking where authority over domains of law gets\nlocated, I am interested in how knowledge and the authority to know informs\npractices of jurisdiction (Pahuja, 2013) \u2014practices that may or may not be formalized in law, but\nnevertheless exercise law-like authority.3",

The idea of science as placeless and\nstatelessness, occupying its own sovereign territory and governed by its own,\ninternally regulative norms, is a foundational (and powerful) postenlightenment\nidealization (Shapin,\n2008). It is what Michael Polanyi famously called \u201cthe republic of\nscience.\u201d In his words \u201cthe soil of academic science must be extraterritorial in\norder to secure its rule by scientific opinion\u201d (Polanyi, 1962). This vision of science\ntreats the sovereignty of its soil as presumptive\u2014as prerequisite for science to be\nauthentically scientific. Yet, as I argue below, this demand of autonomy is also a\ndemand for deference to scientific authority\u2014a form of institutional authority that\noccupies a powerful role in governance. Yet, the legitimacy of scientific authority,\nand the warrant for deference to it, is understood to be grounded\nnot in any political authority, but in epistemic authority\u2014in\nknowledge. The consequence is that the political achievement of scientific\nsovereignty is occluded because it is understood as a natural and necessary\nexpression of epistemic authority. But the too-easy conceptual bifurcation of\nepistemic and political authority occludes the power that flows from the presumption\nthat science is\u2014and must be\u2014sovereign. The project of this paper is to examine some\nperceived conditions of legitimacy that inform the role of scientific authority in\ninternational political order.",

In the case of Indonesia's refusal to share virus\nwith a global scientific community, nonparticipation was construed as a grave and\ndisturbing violation of a tacit but foundational global constitutional order. In\ngiving priority to nationally limited political subjectivity over a global polity at\nrisk, Indonesia engendered a conflict between political sovereignty and an imaginary\nof global governance that privileges sovereign science over sovereign state. Whereas\nthe latter is the explicit, codified, and presumptive foundation of international\nlaw, the former is tacit and foreign to the legal imagination\u2014so much so, that\nscientific authority is essentially overlooked as a normative, political formation\nin the proto-constitutional repertoire of 21st-century global governance. Yet\nsovereign science won the day, not because law was on its side or because it\nmarshaled special political power in the realpolitik of international relations, but\nbecause it was an expression of an imaginary of the right way to know\u2014and to\ngovern\u2014the future security of an imagined global community. It was an expression of\nan imaginary not only of right knowledge, but of the ties that bind together, and,\nthus, constitute that community itself. This imagination of the norms, political\nrelationships, and forms of authority that are legitimate and appropriate to\ngovernment is a constitutional imagination, one that demands that states\u2014and the\nmechanisms of political judgment to which their authority is tethered\u2014affirm the\nsovereignty of the republic of science and subordinate their own political\ncommitments to scientifically authorized accounts of right governance of global\nrisk.",

The authority to know is, in important respects,\nalso the authority to speak the law (Dorsett and McVeigh, 2012): to declare what\nforms of governance are right, appropriate, and good; what forms contribute to,\nrather than mitigate, insecurity; and what commitments to the legitimacy and\njurisdictional authority of the institutions that make such declarations are\nnecessary for achieving order and progress. I have shown how the jurisdictional\nauthority of scientific expertise has extended not only through the recognition of\nnew forms of global risk\u2014a recognition that depends in turn upon deference to expert\nconstructions of knowledge about risk\u2014but also through claims about the nature of\nscience itself, and the constitutional position it must occupy in global governance.\nDeference to scientific authority included not only deference to epistemic\nassertions, but to accounts of what the republic of science requires to maintain its\nintegrity and thereby make such claims: in effect, of what forms of sovereignty it\nmust enjoy in order to know, and thus what forms of sovereignty must be recognized\nand deferred to by other authoritative agents, including in particular those whose\nauthority rests on the \u201cfact\u201d of political sovereignty. In short, the fact of\nrisk\u2014and the authority to speak the facticity of risk\u2014underwrote first a\nconstruction of scientific expertise as essential to global security, and second an\nimaginary of the institution of science as a republic unto itself with unlimited\njurisdiction and sovereign authority over its own extraterritorial soil.",

For science does not claim to be like a state, nor indeed to see like\na state sees (Scott,\n1998), but rather to see beyond states, to see as states cannot see, and to\ndeclare when expressions of political authority run afoul of scientific knowledge\nand its power to secure human life.",
