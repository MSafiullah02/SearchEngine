Study design: Nasopharyngeal aspirates were collected from a cohort of 39,836 children randomized to receive 9-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV9) or placebo when hospitalized for LRTIs, and were screened by PCR for WUPyV, KIPyV and other respiratory viruses. Results: In placebo-recipients the prevalence of WUPyV was 6.3% (18/285) in HIV-infected and 13.9% (66/476) in HIV-uninfected children (p = 0.002). In WUPyV-positive LRTIs HIV-infected children had lower oxygen saturation at admission and a higher case fatality rate (11.1% vs. 0%; p = 0.04).

Nevertheless, worldwide studies attribute a large proportion of LRTIs to viral infections [3, 4] . Largescale molecular screening based technologies have contributed to the discovery of new infectious pathogens, including in 2007 two polyomaviruses (PyV), WU-and KI-polyomavirus [5, 6] . These PyV belong to the Polyomaviridae family and have been associated with respiratory disease in humans, although direct evidence of causality is lacking [7] .

Another study from South Africa reported that 57% of 21 children with LRTIs with WUPyV and 33% of 3 with KIPyV were HIV-infected, however, the HIV-status was unknown in 50% of the cases [12] . In that same study, both polyomaviruses were Table 3 Differences in incidence of WUPyV and KIPyV-associated lower respiratory tract infections between fully-immunized children who received 9-valent pneumococcal conjugated vaccine and placebo recipients; per-protocol analysis. absent among 50 healthy immunocompetent controls [12] . The role of WU/KIPyV as more serious pathogens in immunocompromised individuals is uncertain. Higher viral loads of PyV were documented in lymphoid tissues and in the brains of HIV-infected adults compared to those from immunocompetent individuals [23, 24] . Similarly higher KIPyV viral loads were found in respiratory-tract specimens from haematology/oncology paediatric patients with respiratory infections, however, whether the viral loads correlated with disease severity was not established [13] . These observations suggest that there may be more viral replication and/or that polyomaviruses might reactivate in immunosuppressed individuals, implying that T-cell impairment might be a factor in facilitating polyomavirus replication. Norja et al. found that WU/KIPyV detection on respiratory samples occurred predominantly in two groups of subjects: immunocompetent <2 years of age with LRTIs (7%) in whom there was a high frequency of co-infection (75%), and among older, generally immunocompromised individuals without respiratory illness (11%) or with mild upper respiratory-tract infections (7%) [7] . Although our study was not designed to establish whether polyomavirus infections caused more severe disease in HIV-infected children, among hospitalized children in whom polyomaviruses were detected HIV-infected were more likely to present with pneumonia rather than bronchiolitis, had a longer duration of hospitalization and higher CFR compared to HIV-uninfected children. Similar observations have been detected between HIV-infected and HIV-uninfected children for other viruses [18] , and consequently may not necessarily infer causality for polyomaviruses precipitate more severe illness in HIV-infected children. The increased morbidity and mortality in HIV-infected children could have been related to other co-morbidities such as bacterial or other non-viral co-infections. In the absence of sensitive tools for diagnosing bacterial pneumonia, as well as lack of investigating for other non-viral causes of pneumonia, our study is unable to conclude the actual role of polyomaviruses to more severe disease in HIV-infected children. Nonetheless, the higher CFR, as well as that four fatal cases with polyomavirus as the sole respiratory-virus detected were all HIV-infected children suggest a possible association of polyomavirus causing severe disease in HIV-infected. Furthermore, five HIV-infected children had recurrent KIPyV-positive LRTIs compared to only one HIV-uninfected child. This could have been due to extended viral shedding, viral reactivation or reinfection. A study from Germany detected KIPyV DNA in the respiratory-tract of an immunocompromised child for 7 months and hypothesized that a KIPyV infection during childhood could result in latency of the virus in normal individuals, however, an immune impairment could result in viral reactivation [25] . In 2001 the detection rate of KIPyV in HIV-infected children was higher than in 2000 this may be because of the older cohort in 2001, hence possibly different risk of infection, or differences in year-to-year epidemics.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 250, "end": 254, "text": "[12,", "ref_id": "BIBREF11"}, {"start": 255, "end": 258, "text": "13,", "ref_id": "BIBREF12"}, {"start": 259, "end": 263, "text": "[20]", "ref_id": "BIBREF19"}, {"start": 264, "end": 268, "text": "[21]", "ref_id": "BIBREF20"}, {"start": 269, "end": 273, "text": "[22]", "ref_id": "BIBREF21"}, {"start": 462, "end": 466, "text": "[12]", "ref_id": "BIBREF11"}, {"start": 795, "end": 799, "text": "[12]", "ref_id": "BIBREF11"}, {"start": 1050, "end": 1054, "text": "[23,", "ref_id": "BIBREF22"}, {"start": 1055, "end": 1058, "text": "24]", "ref_id": "BIBREF23"}, {"start": 1299, "end": 1303, "text": "[13]", "ref_id": "BIBREF12"}, {"start": 1909, "end": 1912, "text": "[7]", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}, {"start": 2397, "end": 2401, "text": "[18]", "ref_id": "BIBREF17"}, {"start": 3689, "end": 3693, "text": "[25]", "ref_id": "BIBREF24"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 514, "end": 521, "text": "Table 3", "ref_id": null}], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "The concept of a vaccine-probe analysis was initially used in attributing the contribution of Haemophilus influenza-type b in the aetiology of radiological-confirmed pneumonia, as well as subsequently in PCV trials [14, 16, 19] .

Using this type of analysis, our study suggests that co-infections with PCV9serotypes contribute to hospitalizations for clinical pneumonia in which WU/KIPyV were identified. The imputed rate of coinfection of pneumococci in children with polyomaviruses-positive pneumonia from our study provides a conservative estimate of this possible interaction as only 9 serotypes were included in the vaccine and VE even against vaccine-serotypes pneumococcal pneumonia was not 100%. The high VE estimate for KIPyV-positive disease needs to be contextualized within the wide uncertainty bounds of this estimate.
