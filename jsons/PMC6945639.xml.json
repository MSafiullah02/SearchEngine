The brainstem mediates sensory and motor pathways between the spinal cord and the brain and contains nuclei of the cranial nerves, the ascending reticular activating system (ARAS), and the autonomic nuclei. It controls the brainstem reflexes and the sleep-wake cycle and is responsible for the autonomic control of the cardiocirculatory, respiratory, digestive, and immune systems. Brainstem dysfunction may result from various acute or chronic insults, including stroke, infectious, tumors, inflammatory, and neurodegenerative diseases. In the context of critical illness, the brainstem can be susceptible to various insults that can be categorized as structural and non-structural origin. Brainstem dysfunction can then contribute to impairment of consciousness, cardiocirculatory and respiratory failure, and thus increased mortality [2\u20135].",

While the former controls voluntary movement, the latter is involved in reflexes, motion, complex movements, and postural control (Tables 1 and 2). Upper motor neuron damage can lead to symptoms, ranging from hemiparesis to the locked-in syndrome, which is typically characterized by intact awareness, quadriplegia, anarthria, and absence of eye movements except for preserved vertical gaze. It usually results from bilateral pontine white matter lesions [7]. Characteristic clinical features of brainstem lesions include ipsilateral cranial nerve palsies or cerebellar signs combined with contralateral motor deficits. Brainstem lesions may present with abnormal movements, such as hemichorea, hemiballism, dystonia, tremor, asterixis, pseudo-athetosis, and non-epileptic myoclonus [8] (Table 2). Bilateral motor corticobulbar tract lesion may present with swallowing impairment, dysphagia, dysphonia, velo-pharyngo-laryngeal impairments, uncontrollable crying/laughing episodes, and emotional lability (i.e., pseudobulbar affect; Table 2). A brainstem lesion of the posterior column-medial lemniscus pathway and the spinothalamic tract results in a contralateral proprioceptive/touch and temperature/pain deficit, respectively.\n",

Abnormal spontaneous eye position and movements may be encountered in patients with brainstem lesions and can be seen in comatose patients. Assessment of pupillary size allows the diagnosis of third nerve lesion (i.e., mydriasis) or Horner\u2019s syndrome (i.e., myosis, ptosis, enophtalmia, and anhidrosis). Pupillary light, corneal, oculocephalic, and gag reflexes are routinely assessed in the critical care setting. The oculovestibular responses and oculocardiac are less frequently tested, except to determine brain death. The absence of brainstem reflexes and spontaneous breathing is a prerequisite for the diagnosis of brain death [9]. Automated pupillometry could improve the assessment of the pupil light reflex and thereby its prognostic value [10]. Corneo-mandibular reflexes can be detected in acute brain injury, but its prognostic relevance remains controversial. Finally, assessments of primitive reflexes are less relevant in the ICU context but can be seen in patients with neurodegenerative disease (Table 3).\n",

Acute impairments of consciousness include coma which is defined as a \u201cstate of unresponsiveness in which the patient lies with eyes closed and cannot be aroused to respond appropriately to stimuli even with vigorous stimulation\u201d [14]. The association of a prolonged non-responsive coma with a complete cessation of brainstem reflexes and functions suggests the diagnosis of brain death which is defined as an irreversible loss of all functions of the entire brain. Delirium is defined as an acute and fluctuating disturbance of consciousness, including attention and impairment of cognition, associated with motor hyperactivity or hypoactivity [15, 16]. Delirium has been associated with long-term cognitive impairment, functional disability in ICU survivors, and hospital mortality [15]. Brainstem dysfunction could account for some features of delirium, such as fluctuations in arousal and attentional impairment that could be related to ARAS and to ponto-mesencephalic tegmentum dysfunction, respectively. Other states of acute impairment of consciousness include clouding of consciousness and stupor, but they are less frequently used [14].",

The minimally conscious state (MCS) is defined as state of severely impaired consciousness with minimal behavioral evidence of self or environmental awareness, characterized by the presence of non-reflexive behavior (visual pursuit, appropriate motor response to painful stimulus) or even intermittent command following indicating a cortical integration [18, 19]. The VS and MCS are related to a preservation of brainstem arousal functions but with persistent impairment of supratentorial networks implicated in consciousness [20]. Stimulation of the ARAS may improve consciousness in vegetative or MCS patients [21]. In addition to deep brain stimulation, vagal nerve stimulation, which probably modulates the activity of the nucleus of the tractus solitarius and the dorsal raphe, has shown promising results [22].",

Brainstem lesions can induce cognitive deficits including impaired attention, naming ability, executive functioning, and memory impairment [24], ascribed to a disruption of interconnection between the frontal-subcortical system and the brainstem [1]. Finally, deep sedation is a pharmacologically induced coma, and its mechanisms of action involve the brainstem GABA and N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptors [25].",

Focusing on the brainstem in particular, the FOUR (Full Outline of UnResponsiveness) score is to be preferred as it includes the corneal, pupil light, and cough reflexes and respiratory patterns [26]. In comatose patients, pupil sizes and reactivity can be suggestive of particular etiologies, such as drug overdose (myosis for opioids or mydriasis for tricyclic anti-depressants). In comatose brain-injured patients, brainstem reflex assessment is crucial to detect a uncal or downward cerebellar (tonsillar) herniation [10]. While the absence of corneal and pupillary light reflexes is strongly associated with poor outcome in post-anoxia, their prognostic value is less validated in other causes [27].",

Sympathetic effects originate from the spinal cord (D1 to L3), while parasympathetic neuronal cell bodies are present in the nuclei of cranial nerves III (Edinger Westphal nuclei), VII, IX, and X and the sacral spinal cord (S2 to S4). Activation of the parasympathetic nervous system results in a decrease in heart rate (HR) and blood pressure (BP), and an increase in gastrointestinal tonus, vesical detrusor contraction, and myosis. Activation of the sympathetic system results in opposite effects. Cortical input can modulate responses in the ANS [46] as well as various receptors throughout the body, including the baroreceptors [47].",

Cardiac arrhythmias frequently occur after brainstem stroke and are associated with increased mortality [48]. An intracranial hypertension-induced midbrain insult can impair parasympathetic control and thereby induce adrenergic storm. In brain death, there is a disappearance of the vasomotor tone and an impairment of myocardial contractility [49]. As exhaustive discussions of tests that allow testing of the ANS are beyond the scope of this review, we will focus on cardiovascular tests applicable to ICU patients. Standard monitoring allows for the detection of variations in HR and BP that can be suggestive of dysautonomia. However, the lack of apparent changes in cardiovascular signals does not rule out dysautonomia, which can be then assessed with the HR and BP spectral analysis. High frequency (HF) band (i.e., 0.15 to 0.4 Hz) variability of the HR is thought to predominantly reflect parasympathetic tone, while low frequency (LF) variability (i.e., 0.04 to 0.15 Hz) is primarily mediated by sympathetic activity. The LF/HF ratio reflects the sympathovagal balance. Therefore, spectral analysis allows studying the sympathetic, parasympathetic, and baroreflex activities both at rest and during stimulation [50]. If the Valsalva maneuver, the cold pressure test, and the pharmacological tests (with yohimbine or clonidine) allow testing the ANS, their use in ICU is very limited. Conversely, pupillometry is much more applicable for assessing dysautonomia in ICU. Thus, patients with dysautonomia present a pupil dilatation at resting state and a slow redilatation time [51].",

They are controlled by bulbospinal (automatic command) and corticospinal (voluntary command) pathways. The respiratory drive originates from neurons of the latero-rostro-ventral medulla oblongata, which includes the pre-Botzinger complex and the parafacial respiratory group that control inspiration and expiration, respectively [52] (Table 2). This center receives various inputs to automatically adjust the respiratory drive to metabolic and mechanic changes [53]. Metabolic inputs are mediated by both peripheral (aortic and carotid) and central (medulla oblongata and LC) chemoreceptors [54]. The mechanical inputs are mediated by mechanoreceptors localized in the pulmonary parenchyma, bronchial wall, and muscle. At the level of the pons, the pedunculopontine tegmentum, the LC, the lateral parabrachial and K\u00f6lliker-Fuse nuclei are involved in the automatic respiratory control [55] (Table 2).",

The more caudal the lesion is, the more it is associated with an impairment of the respiratory drive. Midbrain injuries do not usually affect the respiratory rate (RR). Injuries to the upper pons increase the tidal volume and decrease the RR, while injuries of the lower pons are associated with respiratory asynchrony (e.g., ponto-peduncular injury). Ataxic breathing (irregular pauses and apnea periods) and central apnea are observed in rostro-ventral medulla oblongata injuries and associated with poor outcomes. Central neurogenic hyperventilation results from activation of the medullary respiratory center. Finally, yawning or refractory hiccups may be seen with lesions of the posterolateral medulla oblongata [58].

Diagnosis relies on standard assessments of respiratory function (e.g., ventilator curves, tidal volumes (Vt), and RR in mechanically ventilated patients) but also on assessing the ventilatory response to hypercapnia (e.g., during a t-piece trial). An electromyogram of the respiratory muscles, notably the diaphragm, provides relevant information on the central drive. This technique may be helpful in patients that are impossible to wean from mechanical ventilation. As a caveat, it may be at times difficult to differentiate central respiratory dysfunction from critical illness neuropathy/myopathy. EMG and nerve conduction studies may help with the distinction, but limited assessments of every respiratory muscle group and available at highly specialized units limit this approach [62]. In mechanically ventilated patients, spirography can be performed (with the Vt/inspiration duration (Ti) ratio reflects the ventilatory command intensity) as well as the occlusion pressure measurement (i.e., P0.1). The latter reflects the \u201cunconscious\u201d/central respiratory command, but variability of its measurements limits routine application.",

These patients have usually a severe critical illness and therefore a higher risk to develop severe secondary brain insult [3, 29]. Furthermore, protracted deep sedation is still required in more than 30% of critically ill patients [63] and has been reported to be associated with increased mortality [63]. We found that assessment of brainstem reflexes was reproducible in this population [3, 29]. We also found that routinely used sedative and analgesic agents such as midazolam and fentanyl do not impair pupillary light, corneal, and cough reflexes in 90% of cases but depress oculocephalic response and grimacing to painful stimulation (absent in 50 and 70%, respectively) [3, 29, 63]. The cessation of brainstem reflexes results from the combining effects of critical illness (i.e., secondary brain insult), sedative, and analgesic agents. It is interesting to note that Guedel observed more than 70 years ago that sedative drugs abolish brainstem reflexes according to a sequential pattern (the loss of consciousness, followed by the cessation of brainstem reflexes in a rostro-caudal way until apnea) [64].",

The latter profile is associated with the severity of critical illness and the depth of sedation. Interestingly, this pattern cannot be ascribed to a unique focal brainstem lesion which most likely relies on a functional rather than a structural origin. This suggests that some neuroanatomical centers are more sensitive to deep sedation, critical illness, or both. Opioids might also contribute to brainstem dysfunction, as they depress the ARAS, respiratory centers, and brainstem reflexes (notably pupillary light and cough reflexes). However, morphine infusion rates did not differ in our study between the two cessation patterns of brainstem reflexes [29].",

Besides improving the prediction of mortality in deeply sedated patients, the assessment of brainstem reflexes, with help of either the BRASS or the FOUR score, might prompt the ICU physician to perform a brainstem imaging. It is however likely that the processes involved in critical illness-related brainstem dysfunction are radiologically assessable.",

Thus, neuroleptics are antagonists of the dopamine D2 and serotoninergic 5HT2A receptors that are prevalent in the brainstem [75]. Dexmedetomidine is a selective agonist of alpha-2 receptor, notably at the level of the LC [76]. The role of the brainstem in patients with delirium is supported by these pharmacological data and further supported by neuropathological findings that demonstrate hypoxic and ischemic insults of the pons in delirious patients [77]. Absent oculocephalic responses and delayed middle-latency BAEP have been associated with delayed awakening or delirium after sedation discontinuation [34]. In neuroanatomical point of view, it is likely that cessation of the oculocephalic response reflects a dysfunction of the ARAS while cessation of the cough reflex reflects a dysfunction of the cardiovascular and respiratory autonomic nuclei. Finally, if conceivable, we do not know to what extent brainstem dysfunction contributes to long-term post-ICU mortality and functional disability.",

            "text": "Another contributing factor of the brainstem dysfunction in critical illness course might be the impaired sympatho-vagal control of the inflammatory response. The vagus nerve first senses and modulates peripheral inflammation, constituting the so-called cholinergic reflex [78]; second, it senses the microbiota metabolites, being a major component of the gut-brain axis [79] (Table 2). The adrenergic system controls the immune system, with alpha and beta-1 receptors being pro-inflammatory and beta-2 receptors anti-inflammatory [80]. It is therefore conceivable that a brainstem-related neuro-immune impairment can contribute to infection, organ failure, or death by facilitating a maladapted immune response. The modulation of the cholinergic reflex by \u03b17nAChR agonists and by vagal nerve stimulation has been proposed in sepsis and critical illness to improve peripheral immune response and reduce organ dysfunction [81]. In addition to its peripheral immune effects, cholinergic modulation and vagal stimulation can promote anti-inflammatory microglial polarization [82]. However, we shall remind that rivastigmine, a cholinesterase inhibitor, is deleterious in critically ill patients. Vagal nerve stimulation is also proposed in refractory status epilepticus [83] and consciousness disorders [22], suggesting its potential but not yet demonstrated effect in critical illness-related encephalopathy. Beta-blockers reduce the mortality in cardiac diseases by attenuating the deleterious effects of sympathetic hyperactivation and increasing the vagal tone [84]. In sepsis, beta-blockers improve HR control, reduce systemic inflammation, and decrease mortality, acknowledging that their routine use is not yet warranted [85, 86].",

Clinical examination is essential for detecting a brainstem dysfunction that may be supported by neuroimaging, electrophysiological, autonomic, and respiratory assessments. Brainstem dysfunction mainly results from secondary insult and might contribute to critical illness-related mortality, organ dysfunction, immune dysregulation, delayed awakening, and delirium. The assessment of the brainstem should then be included in the routine neuromonitoring of critically ill patients.",
