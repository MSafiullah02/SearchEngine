It was first noticed in China in December 2019 by an ophthalmologist, Dr. Li Wenliang, who died of the same disease unfortunately. Although the main route of virus transmission is through respiratory droplets, several studies have raised concerns about infection occurring through unprotected exposure to the eyes. Up until now, whether ocular secretions could be contagious is still controversial.1,2 This review study is aimed to provide more insights regarding this issue by summarizing currently available information on severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), and previous knowledge of other coronaviruses either in human or in animals.",
