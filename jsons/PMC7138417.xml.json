Public health institutes monitor, implement, and oversee programmes to prevent disease. Life-saving and cost-saving programmes include immunisations, control of communicable diseases including diarrhoeal disease, reduction of motor-vehicle crashes, and tobacco control. Over the past decade, many countries have considered, strengthened, or created national public health institutes (NPHIs), often following a major event such as the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome.1, 2\n",

NPHIs can include disease-specific control programmes, support to state, provincial, or local public health entities, surveillance and control for non-communicable diseases and injuries, occupational and environmental health, and vital registration (table\n).3 These functions can be done by more than one institution in a country, and some countries have collaborated to establish regional institutions. Effective public health responses often require a multidisciplinary team, including skills needed for communicable and non-communicable disease control programmes. For example, the response to biosecurity threats involves expertise in infectious diseases, chemical hazards, engineering, environmental remediation, and risk communication.",

Over decades, it expanded to include surveillance, prevention, and control of non-communicable diseases, injuries, and birth defects as well as occupational and environmental health. The CDC has been increasingly involved in global health activities since the 1950s. Emergency preparedness and response, always a core function, received increased attention after the 9/11 World Trade Center and anthrax attacks. CDC's role in the US health-care system continues to evolve with the passage of health-reform legislation and increased focus on prevention through clinical care.",

Increasing the number, scope, and effectiveness of NPHIs in developing countries will enable better prevention and control of infectious diseases and reduce the burden of non-communicable diseases and injuries. Success will depend on accurate collection, analysis, and dissemination of data to implement and monitor evidence-based programmes. NPHIs require more staff and resources, although on a much smaller scale than the need for additional clinical personnel. Stronger NPHIs enable countries to implement and monitor health programmes that save money and lives by basing decisions on country-specific data on health burden, efficacy of interventions, and implementation status of health programmes. To improve both health and health systems, developing countries need to greatly increase resources and authority of NPHIs.",
