Emergent cases were defined as surgery that should be performed within the hour including trauma, lesions requiring decompression and thrombectomy for acute stroke, while urgent cases were defined as cases that should be performed within hours to days such as pituitary apoplexy. Category 3 cases were defined as those where potential harm would be incurred if the surgery was to be delayed 6 to 12 wk and included most patients with malignancies. Category 2 cases were defined as those where the case may be delayed by 6 to 12 wk with low risk of harm and included radiculopathy without weakness, claudication, resection of benign brain tumors (eg, asymptomatic meningioma), and treatment of unruptured aneurysms and arteriovenous malformations Category 1 cases are purely cosmetic cases, such as cranioplasty. All cases falling into category 1 or 2 were postponed to a future date; however separating categories 2 and 3 cases can be challenging and was done with input from the individual attending surgeon with review by a committee designated by the chair at each hospital. Additional guidance was subsequently published by the American College of Surgeons and provided support for this stratification schema.4",

Contingency plans were created in the event that individuals became unavailable as a result of contracting the illness, required quarantine due to exposure to the virus or had to tend to family members who became ill. In addition, the possibility that multiple individuals would simultaneously become unavailable needed to be factored. Intra- and interdepartmental coverage plans were necessary due to the nature of our field; while some medical specialties lend themselves well to cross-coverage this was not considered a viable strategy for neurosurgery due to its highly specialized nature. Continuous coverage across the various call pools was deemed essential to the operational integrity of the health system across 2 departments.

A similar approach was used for inpatient APP staffing; rather than having the full complement of APPs on site, the in person representation was dropped to a reduced complement with the others being available remotely.

            "text": "The number of in-person visits to the neurosurgery department was actively reduced by shifting the majority of visits to an Epic-integrated telemedicine platform or by conducting phone calls. The previous requirement of virtual visits requiring registration of the physician and the patient with a training module was relaxed to allow simple phone calls when possible. These visits could be logged into Epic as an encounter and documented with time-based coding consistent with the updated Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) telehealth guidelines.5 Selected patients, including postoperative patients requiring wound checks and suture removal, continue to be seen in-person. For those patients, care is ensured that physical distancing is observed in the waiting area, waiting times are minimized, and the number of healthcare providers reduced to essential personnel. All in person activities have been consolidated to 1 outpatient area. As such, a rotating schedule of an on-site PSC exists, with all other PSCs working from home remotely. The on-site PSC provides check in service for all providers\u2014for telemedicine or in-person visits. After the provider finishes the visits they communicate with their off-site PSC to arrange follow-up visit, imaging, or surgery scheduling. Urgent surgical procedures are screened by the department for referral to the OR scheduling group. This approach has minimized the overall foot traffic in the clinic area to essential staff and patients. The volume reductions and the transition to a shared model (vs individual practice support) results in a 'skeleton crews' onsite and offsite. Staff outside of these crews can then be made available to the enterprise by contributing to shared labor pools that match hospital needs with staff expertise and skills. Approximately 50% of our office staff was listed as 'redeployable' to other clinical areas.",

Based on this, as well as growing evidence of the existence of asymptomatic carriers,7,8 that asymptomatic patient can have viral loads similar to symptomatic patients and higher viral loads being reported in the nasal cavity compared to the pharynx9 additional guidelines were developed for operations considered to be at additional high risk. These guidelines include transsphenoidal surgery (open/endoscopic) for anterior/anterolateral skull base, open anterior skull base surgery involving the frontal sinus, ethmoids or sphenoid sinus including sinonasal malignancies, skull base dehiscence, erosive skull, and lateral skull base surgery involving partial or complete mastoidectomy. For surgeries meeting those criteria, COVID-19 testing is performed 24 to 48 h preoperatively regardless of the presence of symptoms. If the patient tests positive, the surgery is deferred by at least 2 wk if it is safe to do so, at which point patient can be retested to assess for clearance with 2 negative nasopharyngeal screening tests for COVID-19 obtained at least 24 h apart. However, if the surgery cannot be rescheduled due to risk to patient, the surgery proceeds after the infection control team is alerted of the planned procedure, and strict precautions are employed as well as limiting the OR personnel to essential staff. Alternative surgical approaches may also be considered if appropriate.",

For example, the aforementioned measures resulted in a 44% reduction in charges when compared to average baseline for 1 of the 2 physician organizations during the first week of implementation. This is expected to be reduced even more in the coming weeks of the pandemic. The loss of elective surgeries will disproportionally affect specialties whose compensation derives by work relative value units or profits/loss statements more so than straight salaries, at least initially. Already, at several AMCs in the Boston area there have been reports of halting pension contributions, bonus pay, and or planned increases in compensation.10 The elimination of elective surgeries, one of the most profitable sources of technical revenue, for AMCs and downstream revenue from radiological and pathological analyses will also result in a severe financial stress. The current emergency package approved by the US Congress in March 2020 that will provide between $100 and 150 billion dollars for hospitals and healthcare, while helpful, is unlikely to be sufficient to restore financial health to many institutions. Like the financial crisis of 2008 led to the financial failure of many businesses with a weak balance sheet, the current crisis is likely to lead to the financial failure of many hospitals and AMCs, requiring more mergers or acquisitions with entities that can withstand the current financial stress, more bail-outs from state governments or closures.",
