Clinicians contemplated the frightening possibility of reaching a crisis state where resource scarcity would prevent us from offering advanced life support to chronically ill, elderly patients with the poorest prognoses. The impact of these emotionally-charged discussions was significant. Even when staffing, ventilators, and other resources remained at objectively adequate levels, providers often continued to subconsciously anchor on a \u201cCrisis Standards of Care\u201d mindset, proposing limits on aggressive treatment modalities due to concerns about future resource scarcity rather than actual scarcity or patient values.",

Patients and families with limited English proficiency, disproportionately affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, face an additional barrier of needing an interpreter to communicate with the healthcare team. Due to these communication challenges, clinicians in the COVID-19 pandemic are less likely to learn about their patient\u2019s values and may subconsciously fill in knowledge gaps with inaccurate assumptions based on their own personal values.",

Outcome data for critically ill patients with COVID-19 were reviewed independently by two authors, one trained in critical care, with a focus on clinical predictors of mortality. Based on published outcome data, we identified two broad categories of patients with contrasting prognostic trajectories useful to clinicians: 1) patients with COVID-19 receiving mechanical ventilation with isolated lung involvement (generally <60-70 years old), and 2) patients with COVID-19 receiving mechanical ventilation with multi-organ involvement and/or patients who were >70 years old. For each group, we created a visual summary of the approximate likelihood of successful extubation, death in the hospital, or prolonged intubation >2 weeks with uncertain final outcome (Figure 2). Reviewers reached consensus about the two categories of patients and their respective prognoses through discussion of the literature. The tool is updated weekly to reflect newly published results.",

The best-case scenario for patients who require a prolonged course of intubation describes a typical recovery period after severe acute respiratory distress syndrome, emphasizing that recovery is often prolonged, on the order of months, with a new baseline that will likely include new functional deficits.18 This descriptive clinical scenario is provided in conjunction with estimated survival rates to provide a tangible reminder to clinicians of how a potential recovery might look. While recognizing that the likelihood of recovery may be small in some cases, we explicitly point out the possibility of recovery as a counterbalance to availability bias for clinicians who have recently cared for a dying patient and may be susceptible to inappropriate therapeutic nihilism.",

First, the framework directs providers to imagine best-case, worst-case and most likely scenarios for the individual patient. Second, clinicians are asked to consider whether each treatment option is likely to \u201cwork\u201d for the patient on a physiologic level. These two steps attempt to enhance provider awareness of inappropriate therapeutic nihilism by prompting providers to go through the cognitive step of considering the likelihood of benefit from each treatment option.

First, the visual summary of patient outcomes is based on limited data from early studies and is likely to change as the pandemic evolves. Moreover, patient outcome data vary widely across studies due to length of study follow-up and regional differences in resource availability, treatment protocols, and approaches to withdrawal of life-sustaining treatment. Our team strives to update our visual summary of patient outcomes at least weekly with a concerted effort to capture pervasive, big-picture trends in survival. However, our interpretation of the data inevitably involves some degree of subjectivity. Second, this prognostication tool can only be useful when it is thoughtfully applied to the patient population and clinical circumstances for which it is intended: critically ill patients with COVID-19. Third, up-to-date and accurate prognostic information is only one step in effective prognostic communication with patients and family members. Supportive and effective communication of prognostic information is an important skill with multiple components, many of which are not addressed by this tool.1\n,\n19\n,\n20 Fourth, our prognostication tool focuses on three cognitive biases that we observed at our institution but may not be universally applicable to all centers; reflection prompts may need to be adapted depending on the cognitive biases that are prevalent within each institutional culture. Finally, our evaluation of this tool is subjective and preliminary. Our goal was to share the tool quickly for others to adapt, implement, and evaluate in the context of this novel pandemic. Additional evaluation will be important to understand and improve the effectiveness of the tool.",
