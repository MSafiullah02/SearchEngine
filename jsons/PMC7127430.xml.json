However, in the context of the subcellular architectures being remodeled into viral replicative organelles, it is unclear how form and function are related. Following several excellent ultrastructural studies, the role played by replicative organelles in the replication cycle remains unclear [1]. For example, studies showing that viral RNA accumulates in and around the coronavirus organelles 2, 3 and studies demonstrating that organelles are not formed when RNA synthesis is halted 4, 5 show that the appearance of these organelles is tied to RNA synthesis. However, other studies demonstrated that only some organelles are sites of active RNA synthesis [6], and that RNA synthesis occurs before membrane rearrangements are detectable [7]. More recently, a study that used a panel of coronaviruses with mutations affecting the size and number of organelles showed that producing fewer or smaller organelles did not necessarily decrease RNA synthesis or lead to a detectable competitive fitness disadvantage [8], although it is not yet clear whether this is the case in vivo or in immunologically active cells such as primary macrophages. These studies are difficult to reconcile with an interpretation of the organelle as the obligate site of viral RNA synthesis.",

For example, membrane-bound factories do not appear to be formed by Leviviridae, which are known to infect members of the Proteobacteria [17]. This is not surprising, because Proteobacteria typically lack the types of internal membranes that other +RNA viruses co-opt to form organelles, but it does suggest that it is theoretically possible for a +RNA polymerase to work in the absence of replicative organelles. Another example is the poorly characterized Narnaviridae, which infect fungi. The Narnaviridae appear to lack both capsid and nucleoprotein genes, but encode an RdRp that is closely related to those of the Leviviridae. Further work is also needed to investigate the function and detailed structure of other fungal viruses such as the Barnaviridae and fungus-infecting members of the Tymovirales. A final group that could shed light on the evolutionary origin of viral membrane-bound organelles is the uncharacterized hyperthermophilic +RNA virus group that was detected genetically in near-boiling, archaea-dominated acidic hot springs of Yellowstone National Park [18].",

Another point that can be taken from the table is that the architecture of the organelle can vary considerably within a family or order, as evidenced for the Nidovirales (Figure 1\n). Most of the viral proteins implicated in organelle formation are either non-enzymatic, or are large multi-domain proteins that also include the RdRp. This suggests that organelle formation is a derived characteristic that arose in +RNA viruses of eukaryotes after, and as an accessory to, RdRp function. The apparent lack of homology between viruses of different families (which will be discussed below), suggests that if organelle-making proteins did arise as replicative accessories, they were probably acquired independently in each virus lineage.",

They observed that nsp3 accumulated in perinuclear clusters consisting of large multilamellar vesicles and disordered membrane bundles. This membrane proliferation phenotype was also induced by expression of the C-terminal part of nsp3 starting from the first transmembrane and running to the end of the Y domain. Nsp4 also showed a reticular localization, but did not induce any detectable membrane rearrangements in the absence of nsp3. Coexpression of nsp3 and nsp4 induced extensive membrane pairing, in the form of tubular \u2018maze-like bodies\u2019.
