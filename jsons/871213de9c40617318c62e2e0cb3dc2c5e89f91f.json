            "text": "The Spanish government declared the lockdown on March 14th, 2020 to tackle the fast-28 spreading of COVID-19. As a consequence the Balearic Islands remained almost fully 29 isolated due to the closing of airports and ports, These isolation measures and the home-based 30 confinement have led to a low prevalence of COVID-19 in this region. We propose a 31 compartmental model for the spread of COVID-19 including five compartments (Susceptible, 32 Latent, Infected, Diseased, and Recovered), and the mobility between municipalities. The 33 model parameters are calibrated with the temporal series of confirmed cases provided by the 34 Spanish Ministry of Health. After calibration, the proposed model captures the trend of the 35 official confirmed cases before and after the lockdown. We show that the estimated number 36 of cases depends strongly on the initial dates of the local outbreak onset and the number of 37 imported cases before the lockdown. Our estimations indicate that the population has not 38 reached the level of herd immunization necessary to prevent future outbreaks. While the low 39 prevalence, in comparison to mainland Spain, has prevented the saturation of the health 40 system, this low prevalence translates into low immunization rates, therefore facilitating the 41 propagation of new outbreaks that could lead to secondary waves of COVID-19 in the region. 42 These findings warn about scenarios regarding after-lockdown-policies and the risk of second 43 outbreaks, emphasize the need for widespread testing, and could potentially be extrapolated 44 to other insular and continental regions.",

To explore 397 whether the number of accumulated infections reach the herd immunity threshold and 398 therefore avoidance of potential second waves is to be expected, we run the model for the 399 same parameters leading to the best fit (29). After the system has relaxed to zero infection, we 400 select a random susceptible from the populations and infected her. As we are interested in 401 whether the epidemics will spread again, we use the transmission rate obtained at the 402 beginning of the epidemics in the Balearic Islands, that is, before any restriction on mobility 403 had been applied. We can expect that once the mobility restrictions have been removed, the 404 transmission will be reduced in comparison to the initial values, especially due to an 405 improvement in the hygiene of the population. This will affect how fast the COVID-19 will 406 spread and the intensity of the wave. If the estimated number of infected is lower than the 407 threshold for herd immunization, we assume that the COVID-19 will spread. In the 408 Supplementary Material, we show how the data can be collapsed using a proper combination 409 of the initial number of infected cases and the time of the first infection.",

The use of modeling tools is a complement to field studies that can be used to 193 anticipate the progress of a pandemic and thus help health authorities to make decisions. In 194 the case of the Balearic Islands, there are two foremost advantages in terms of model 195 precision. First, since the incidence during the first peak was relatively low and hospital 196 capacity including ICU beds was not overpassed, the forecasted scenario of a second wave 197 presenting with more intensity is more feasible than in other areas. Second, the relatively 198 small size of the Balearic Islands and the organization of health and epidemiological 199 surveillance systems make the official accounts of reported cases more reliable than in other 200 All rights reserved.

Knowing the 208 approximate date of infection of the first reported case in an outbreak proved critical to 209 estimate the current and foreseen number of cases. Whether a second wave occurs and the 210 intensity of the peak strongly depended on the date of the first infection, as the number of 211 infected cases grows exponentially, but also on the number of imported cases, which 212 contribute additively to the number of cases, and also on the real herd immunization. Our 213 estimates rely on calculations assuming conditions far from the behavior of the population, 214 and on the habits, for example, regarding hygiene, the use of masks, and social distancing, of 215 the population after the lockdown is relaxed. 216 217 Our model is an individual-based model for which, due to the population size, we identify 218 each inhabitant with an individual in the simulation model.

We use here a stochastic approach 233 similar to other works (19,21) which lets us compute confidence intervals even for single 234 combinations of the parameters instead of deterministic ordinary differential equations 235 (8,22,23) or discrete-time dynamic equations (3). We also use a fixed time for the transit 236 through the E, I, and D compartments, Tlat, Tinf, and TD respectively. We believe this approach 237 is more realistic than an approach based on rates, where individuals transit the compartments 238 at a given rate, giving rise to exponentially distributed times of transit through the 239 compartments. In this case, infected will have the opportunity to be infectious immediately, 240 or to transit the I compartment also immediately, bringing the start of secondary infections 241 closer to the time they were infected for many individuals. A similar effect happens with the 242 length of the disease (time in the D compartment), having then individuals that immediately 243 recover. 244 245The model also has several limitations. First, as it is constructed for fitting the global 246 numbers of infected patients, it is missing finer structure, needed for the evaluation of risks of 247 subpopulations that are differently exposed to the virus or have different outcomes, such as 248 the population of elderly people or health workers.

The present model takes into account the first two modes of transmission,252    but not the environmental one explicitly, although probably the fitting has assigned part of 253 this transmission to the processes included in our model. Therefore, there is not a direct way254 of measuring the effect of interventions to reduce environmental transmission. Third, the 255 model also considers asymptomatic and symptomatic individuals to be infectious in the same 256 way, although the viral shedding in asymptomatic individuals is indeed lower (5). This can 257 have a mild impact on the number of infected individuals that the model predicts. Fourth, the 258 model assumes that the mobility restrictions are applied in the same way to all of the agents 259 in the system and thus is lacking the fact that symptomatic infected individuals will modify 260 their mobility drastically, either if they are quarantined at home or admitted to a hospital. We 261 are therefore overestimating mobility, but this is probably passed to the infectivity in the 262 fitting procedure. Fifth, the model also takes fixed times to transit through the E, I, and D 263 compartments (Tlat, Tinf and TD, respectively), which is artificial. More refined models would 264 take this transit times from specified distributions matching the parameters of the disease 265(21,23). While this will render the model a more realistic approach, we believe that fixing the 266 times is a good compromise between using rates for transiting the compartments and 267 implementing distributions for those times, as it already captures the delays induced by these 268 particular timings of the infection.
