Early signs of the value of convalescent blood therapy against Ebola were revealed by the recovery of a British laboratory worker in 1977, with occupational exposure to EVD, after treatment with convalescent serum and human interferon1 and by 1979 convalescent plasma was considered a \u2018specific treatment\u2019 for Ebola.2 Further evidence of the value of convalescent blood therapy (CBT) was provided by Mupapa and colleagues in 19953 after treating eight subjects with CWB, and only one of them died. The treated patients may have already developed antibodies for EVD and the recovery of the patients was not wholly attributable to the CWB, but it could not also be ruled out as the primary cause of the recovery.",

However, statistical significance does not always correlate with clinical significance. Also, an experiment was conducted to test the effectiveness of convalescent whole blood on na\u00efve monkeys that had been infected with EVD, but it did not lead to recovery,5 creating further doubt on the efficacy of CWB. Again, the volume of CWB used (6 ml/kg) may not have been sufficient enough to cause a recovery in the monkeys and the blood used was obtained after 30 days of reinfection of convalescent monkeys with 1000 pfu of the EVD virus.",

Additionally, severe pandemic influenza A (H1N1) 2009 virus infection12 and even Ebola[13], [14] have benefitted from CWB during their onsets, but no recent report on CWB for Ebola has been reported.",

CWB is easier to use and adaptable for application in resource-poor settings with limited kits and burden of hard-to-treat diseases such as EVD. The blood may only require screening for transfusion transmissible infections (TTIs) such as viral hepatitis and HIV and to ensure that the blood is safe and matching the ABO blood groups of recipients. In the case of convalescent plasma, its use may require plasmapheresis, which is the separation of blood cells from the liquid plasma, before use. Also, the IgG in plasma could be enriched by fractionation.15\n",
