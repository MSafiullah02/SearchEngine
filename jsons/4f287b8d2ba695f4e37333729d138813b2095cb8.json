She was admitted to our hospital on February 2, 2020. Before the onset of symptoms, she had been taken to Lu'an, Hubei Province by her parents for a family party between January 16 and January 24, 2020. At that party, the infant's uncle and aunt, Wuhan residents, presented with cough and fever. Then, the child's parents were diagnosed with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) on January 31, 2020 based on their symptoms, chest imaging, and viral ribonucleic acid (RNA) in pharyngeal swabs. The nasopharyngeal swab obtained from the infant also tested positive for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) on real-time, reverse-transcription polymerase-chain-reaction (RT-PCR) assay.",

Lymphocyte count, platelet count, CD8 + T lymphocyte count, and serum immunoglobulin (Ig)M level were all mildly elevated. Other laboratory examinations including hemoglobin, D-dimer, activated partial thromboplastin time, prothrombin time, C-reactive protein, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, and renal function in this patient showed no abnormalities. Both rotavirus in stool and cytomegalovirus deoxyribonucleic acid in blood were negative. Based on the definite contact history and the above test results, the infant was diagnosed as COVID-19 (ordinary type). She was isolated and treated empirically with the inhaled interferon \u03b1-1b (15 \u03bcg, bid), amoxicillin potassium clavulanate (30 mg/kg, q8h, intravenous glucose tolerance test [IVGTT]), reduced glutathione, ursodeoxycholic acid, and traditional Chinese medicine lotus qingwen.",

She received sputum suctioning. Meanwhile, oxygen was supplied through a nasal cannula immediately, and ambroxol was administrated to eliminate phlegm. Because there was a trend of aggravation in the disease grade, a second chest CT scan was performed in the evening of hospital day 4 (illness day 9), which showed evidence of progressive pneumonia ( Figure 1B ). These radiographic findings coincided with a progress in respiratory status. Abnormal myocardial zymogram on admission and increased troponin I (0.025 \u03bcg per liter) on hospital day 4 indicated myocardia injury, so intravenous sodium creatine phosphate was added to protect her heart. During this period, the baby still had a good appetite, without diarrhea, oliguria, or shock.

On hospital day 11 (illness day 16), a third chest CT scan showed patchy shadows and ground-glass opacity were obviously absorbed ( Figure 1C ). In view of the patient's clinical manifestations and other laboratory findings, the Citrobacter freundii in 2 sputum cultures was considered as a colonized bacteria of the respiratory tract and was not being treated. Three pharyngeal swabs obtained from hospital day 10 to hospital day 13 were found to be negative for SARS-CoV-2 on RT-PCR assays. Amoxicillin potassium clavulanate was discontinued on hospital day 11, and interferon \u03b1-1b was discontinued on the following day. According to the latest interim guidance of the COVID-19 diagnosis and treatment in China, the patient met the discharge criteria. However, we found that her anal swabs collected on hospital day 11 and 13 were still positive for SARS-CoV-2 RNA. Thus, the patient remained hospitalized. From February 16, 2020, she was transferred to another hospital for continued isolation and observation. In the process of manuscript revision, we have learned that she was still asymptomatic during this period, and the anal swab collected on February 28, 2020 was negative for this viral RNA.",

            "text": "The SARS-CoV-2 infection can lead to acute resolved or fatal pneumonia. Currently, the main source of infection is COVID-19 patients. The route of human-to-human transmission of SARS-CoV-2 is mainly through respiratory droplets and contacts. The fecal-oral route and maternal-infant transmission have not been confirmed or ruled out. Although the number of cases has increased rapidly, information on the clinical characteristics of affected pediatric patients is rare. We have learned that Middle East respiratory syndrome-coronavirus (MERS-CoV) in children is less frequent and seems to be associated with less mortality unless the patient has underlying comorbidities [1, 2] . This impression in children with MERS-CoV was also reported during the SARS-CoV infections in pediatric patients, in which symptoms were milder, there were few hospitalizations, and resulted in no death [3, 4] . Possible explanations include low exposure, presence of asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic patients, the immature immune system, and the presence of unidentified factors. The SARS-CoV-2 strains are less genetically similar to SARS-CoV (with 79% identity) and Wei et al [6] reported 9 infants diagnosed with COVID-19, including 1 baby at the age of 1 month, 26 days. However, there was no detailed information about the patients' examination and treatment in this letter. Our report illustrated the full clinical course of the infected infant. The patient had traveled to Hubei, China and had the sick contacts during her stay in Hubei. Although signs and symptoms caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection at the prodromal phase was atypical and nonspecific, the chest CT scan showed bilateral patchy shadows, in line with the atypical pneumonia. Acute liver injury and cardiac damage were also observed in this patient. Due to the difficulty of specimen collecting and the risk of cross-infection when going out for examination, other etiological tests of cardiac and hepatic abnormalities, except for rotavirus and cytomegalovirus detection, were not performed. Given the patient's definite contact history of COVID-19, positive SARS-CoV-2 RNA, and good response to treatment, the 2 injuries were thought to be related to COVID-19. Elevated CD8 + cell count in peripheral blood and increased serum IgM level on admission might indicate that both cellular immune and humoral immune in acute infection have been activated to produce cytotoxic T lymphocyte and antibodies to kill and neutralize the virus. Huang et al [7] found that SARS-CoV-2 infection appears to be initially associated with an increased T helper 2 cell response, which might reflect a physiological reaction to suppress overt inflammatory responses. Our case patient initially presented with mild dry cough and no fevers. However, from day 7 of her illness, her symptoms were gradually getting worse, especially on day 9 of her illness, coinciding with results of the second chest CT scan. The timing of our patient's progression is consistent with that reported in adults [8, 9] . Due to the lack of effective verbal communication with infants, more frequent and careful clinical monitorings should be performed to find disease progression. When the patient's status was worsening, symptomatic support was strengthened. Corticosteroids were not used in this patient, because her clinical condition was not completely out of control, and there is still no conclusive evidence of net benefit in the treatment of respiratory infection due to several viruses including SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV [10, 11] . Therefore, the timely and appropriate symptomatic support treatment and the patients' own immune system may be the best means to combat the SARS-CoV-2 in pediatric patients.",

Whether the virus could not enter the milk due to some barrier and whether a confirmed case could continue to provide her breastmilk for baby deserve further study. In addition, the SARS-CoV-2 RNAs have been detected in the stool specimens or anal swabs of both the patient and her mother, indicating a potential alternative route of fecal-oral transmission, even in patients without gastrointestinal symptoms. However, the clinical significance of this detection of viral RNA outside the respiratory tract is unknown at this stage. Fecal RNA appeared later than that of pharyngeal swab in the mother, which might indicate that the virus is swallowed into the digestive tract during the process of its elimination from the respiratory tract. Moreover, we also observed that it takes longer for a fecal SARS-CoV-2 RNA to turn negative than that of a pharyngeal specimen in the infant. This phenomenon might indicate that the digestive tracts clear the virus more slowly than the respiratory tracts. Whether the patient isolation should not be terminated until SARS-CoV-2 RNA in the stool turns negative is worth exploring. Just like the other 2 studies [9, 12] , we found no evidence of viral shedding in urine of the patient's monther. However, improved systematic serial collection and testing of an increased number of urine samples is warranted to exclude this route of transmission. Finally, our understanding of COVID-19 is changing on a daily basis, and with continuous efforts from all sides, we hope and believe that this abominable disease can be controlled soon.",
