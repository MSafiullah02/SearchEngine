Thirty-three percent of all 108 serum samples tested yielded viral RNA. Only 14.6% of stool and 2.4% of urine samples yielded viral RNA. All seroconversions occurred during the first 2 weeks after diagnosis, which corresponds to the second and third week after symptom onset. Immunoglobulin M detection provided no advantage in sensitivity over immunoglobulin G (IgG) detection. All surviving patients, but only slightly more than half of all fatal cases, produced IgG and neutralizing antibodies. The levels of IgG and neutralizing antibodies were weakly and inversely correlated with LRT viral loads. Presence of antibodies did not lead to the elimination of virus from LRT.",

The time of diagnosis chosen as a chronological reference point represents the time when an infection is suspected in hospitalized patients, or when outpatients report to hospitals due to worsening symptoms.

In our patients and elsewhere, the LRT was found to be the main source of MERS-CoV excretion [17] . Unfortunately, there are few data on LRT virus excretion for SARS-CoV, because endotracheal sampling was widely discouraged during SARS outbreaks to avoid nosocomial risks. We have shown, in one of the few available studies, that SARS-CoV was excreted from the LRT at mean concentrations of 1.2-2.8 \u00d7 10 6 copies/mL, reaching a maximum of 10 10 copies/mL [18] . That study was conducted in a similar clinical context (a treatment center in Singapore) with similar timing of samples and clinical courses. Determination of viral load was performed by the same laboratory, using equivalent calibrators and conversion factors. From this comparison, we can conclude that average and peak LRT viral loads in MERS are equal to those in SARS [18] . More data are available for upper respiratory tract (URT) viral loads in SARS patients. Peak URT RNA concentrations can reach up to 5 \u00d7 10 5 copies/sample between days 7 and 10 after onset [18, 19] . The corresponding number for MERS ( peaking at 4.1 \u00d7 10 6 copies/sample), is equivalent or higher. Also, the 47.6% proportion positive for MERS in URT exceeded the 38% proportion positive in 98 URT samples for SARS patients in Hong Kong [19] .",

            "text": "The timing of excretion is more difficult to compare, as many patients in studies on SARS were outpatients who entered hospital because of their SARS infection, whereas our MERS patients were mostly inpatients [20] . In SARS cases that occurred before Hong Kong authorities started active community contact tracing, the average time from symptom onset to admission was 4-7 days [20] . Because case definitions and diagnostics were well-established during SARS in Hong Kong, diagnostic samples would have been taken immediately upon admission. This can be aligned with the timing in our study based on a subcohort of patients for whom an onset of symptoms could be reliably determined. In these patients, the time from onset of symptoms to the initiation of laboratory diagnostics (8 days) was similar to that of early Hong Kong SARS cases. The shedding peak in SARS patients occurred after approximately 10-12 days from symptom onset, which is very similar to the shedding maximum observed in our study, under the assumption that the day of first diagnosis in our MERS cases plausibly falls around the eighth day of symptoms (ie, directly after admission) [21, 22] . In summary, neither the virus concentration nor the timing of respiratory shedding provides an explanation for differences in transmissibility between MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV. Experimental data suggest a higher sensitivity of MERS-CoV to respiratory epithelium-associated type I interferon, which might provide a plausible explanation for its lower transmissibility in comparison with SARS-CoV [23] . Many other explanations are possible, however.",

            "text": "The detection of MERS-CoV in serum is another similarity with SARS. Up to 79% of serum samples were found to contain SARS-CoV RNA during the first week of illness, and around 50% during the second week [24] [25] [26] . These numbers match our observations for MERS. Free viremia seems unlikely as a cause of nosocomial transmission of MERS, as no infectious virus was isolated from serum. There is evidence of SARS-CoV replicating in peripheral blood mononuclear cells, macrophages, and dendritic cells, albeit at low levels [27] [28] [29] [30] . In the present study, the absence of correlation of serum viral load with LRT viral load points to potential extrapulmonary replication. Viremia despite the presence of neutralizing antibodies indicates a body region that is not accessible to neutralizing antibodies but which releases virus into the blood. SARS-CoV has been shown to replicate in several extrapulmonary organs without evidence of tissue damage [27] . One organ implicated in MERS is the kidney. Kidney failure has been reported in many cases, and MERS-CoV was originally isolated in kidney cells that express DPP4, the MERS-CoV entry receptor [11] . However, earlier healthcare-associated outbreaks have been centered near dialysis centers and nephrology departments, and have affected metabolically compromised patients who are predisposed to kidney failure when suffering from systemic disease affecting blood pressure and circulation. Although patients with SARS-CoV showed viral RNA detection rates up to 50% in urine [7, 22] , we rarely found urine-associated MERS-CoV RNA in this study. As in SARS, kidney failure in MERS patients might well be explained by severe inflammatory reaction combined with the administration of potentially nephrotoxic drugs during intensive care [31] . Nevertheless, it will be highly important to conduct postmortem examinations, particularly of the kidney, of patients who die during acute MERS-CoV infection.",

The development of antibodies in serum was not followed by a rapid elimination of viral RNA from the lung. Neutralizing antibodies normally include immunoglobulin A (IgA) secreted in respiratory fluids and saliva. We have recently shown that anti-MERS-CoV IgA is indeed secreted in respiratory fluids [10] , suggesting that the development of IgA comes too late to confer timely reduction of viral replication in infected mucosa.
