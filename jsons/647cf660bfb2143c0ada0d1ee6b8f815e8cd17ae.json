The demand for glucose by the foetus increases as pregnancy advances (Kronfeld 1958) . and although a pregnant sheep on a fixed feed inrake increases its glucose entry rate as it approaches term, in the same sheep starved for four days there were no differences in glucose entry rates at any period of pregnancy (Steel and Leng 1968). The differences observed in the animals in this study are therefore unaffected by the time from lambing especially since at a maximum the mean difference was only about 8 days. Thercfore it seems reasonable to suggest that rhe biotin increased glucose synthesis rates in both breeds of animals when starved for 48 h.",

This may indicate a rapid loss of biotin in the tissues of pregnant sheep, particularly after the onset of starvation. Further studies are planned on the effects of biotin on glucose metabolism and the incidence of pregnancy toxaemia.",

            "text": "We sheep on a property in Gippsland, Victoria, was investigated during November 1977. Approximately 10% of a flock of 1500 were affected. Although the faeces were fluid in nature and unlikely. The sheep had been drenched with an anthelmintic thiophanate* 14 days before the outbreak and the faecal samples examined by light microscopy did not contain nematode eggs. A total of 8 samples (including 3 samples collected from sheep per rectum and 5 freshly deposited samples obtained from the paddock) were examined and no recognised pathogenic bacteria were isolated. However, when faecal homogenates were pelleted by ultracentrifugation and examined by electromicroscopy, coronavirus-like particles were observed in one of the samples The isolation of coronaviruses from sheep has not previously been reported although there are a number of overseas reports that this group of viruses can cause serious diseases in young animals of other species. These diseases include transmissible gastroenteritis in pigs (Bruner and Gillespie 1973) and neonatal diarrhoea in calves (Stair et a1 1972) . Morphologically similar viruses are also suspected to cause diarrhoea in foals (Bass and Sharpee 1975) , dogs (Takeuchi et a1 1976) and possibly man (Caul et a1 1975; Schnagl et a1 1977) . This isolate from sheep is believed to be the first reported enteric coronavirus isolated from animals in Australia.",
