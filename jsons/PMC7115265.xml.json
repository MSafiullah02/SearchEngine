All 13 municipalities in Heilongjiang were involved in the study. In each municipality, there are 5-10 counties; we selected 2-4 sampled counties at random in the same proportion (40%). Finally, 40 CDC institutions were sampled. The researchers traveled to 40 CDC institutions to conduct the face-to-face survey, and all the CDC staff were invited to participate, except nonprofessional staff. The study protocol was reviewed and approved by the Research Ethics Committee of Harbin Medical University. Each participant was interviewed by an interviewer following a structured questionnaire. All participants indicated his or her willingness to take part both verbally and in consent forms signed before the commencement of interviews.

Our study found that low preparatory education and inadequate numbers of qualified personnel existed in Heilongjiang. The United States attaches great importance to the continuing education of CDC staff through a variety of training approaches. For example, CDC staff can participate in short-term training or promote corresponding knowledge by network and distance education.32 We suggest that there is a need to improve the preparedness of existing staff in China through formal advanced education, and to review the entry-level requirements for new staff. Consideration may be given to offer senior staff, such as experienced health managers in related areas, an opportunity to undergo additional training and be offered redeployment to improve emergency response capacity. In addition, developing a multidisciplinary public health specialist workforce is also very necessary in China. The UK public health policy has emphasized the importance of a multidisciplinary background among the public health specialist workforce since 1997.33 In 1999, the Public Health Department of the UK National Health System received other related professional background personnel.34 Reinforcing skills by developing existing staff training and a multidisciplinary public health specialist workforce should become the priority in the process of health emergency preparedness in the Chinese CDC.",

Other studies show that the lack of experienced and senior staff, laboratory support, and insufficient ongoing funding influenced personnel's capacity to master field epidemiologic investigation skills.36, 37 The other, weaker skill in public health emergency response shown in this study was personal protection. PPE use is essential to prevent skin and mucous membranes from becoming contaminated.38 PPE serves as the last physical barrier between a health care provider and infectious agents. In previous outbreaks, health care personnel infections were substantially reduced with the institution of barrier precautions39; however, our survey found that not all the responders were confident in the proficient use of PPE. This was especially problematic in the use of respiratory protective devices and apparatus. The safety of emergency response personnel is dependent upon the prior investment of training in the correct use of PPE.40 Our survey showed that in some public health emergencies, such as biological or nuclear and radiation accidents, the capacity of personal protection was low. Although this may be related to the sudden and unexpected onset of accidents with resultant environmental contamination in many complex and diverse ways,41 it seems that proper planning and preparation should prevent poor performance.",

Second, because we surveyed the participants in 1 province due to time and resource restrictions, these findings may not be generalizable to other regions in China. To get a more accurate estimation of the emergency response capacity, further studies are recommended to develop a more comprehensive evaluation tool and enhance the skills and techniques of responders during public health emergencies.",

Policy intervention should be targeted to equip emergency responders with needed skills and techniques and address the weakest links in their skill mix. More attention should be given to emergency response skills training and education programs and providing grassroots-level CDC staff with more opportunities to master the skills of epidemiologic investigation, personal protection, emergency preparedness planning, emergency drills, and crisis communication. Major obstacles hindering the efficient promotion of key skills and techniques among front-line emergency responders should be addressed urgently. Continuous efforts should be made to remove the financial, technical, and resource obstacles to improve the public health emergency response capacity.",
