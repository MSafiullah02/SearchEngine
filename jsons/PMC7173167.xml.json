            "text": "Respiratory tract infections occur 50% more often in children attending CDCCs compared with those in home care and cause more hospitalization.11, 18, 19 Presumably, this increase is caused by the frequent and close contact between the young children and the consequent increased exposure to infectious agents. The size of the group in the day care is the most significant risk factor for infection.20 Transmission of respiratory infections to and between infants is largely dependent on the infection control practices of the care givers.21 In contrast to infants, toddlers themselves are effective transmitters of infectious agents because of their personal hygiene, ambulatory status, exploratory behaviors, and natural intimacy with each other. These characteristics of a toddler make the of control of respiratory infections in CDCCs inherently difficult. Although most respiratory tract infections are self-limited and not associated with long-term complications, their impact is significant in terms of discomfort to the children, disruption to the family and child care arrangements, and direct and indirect economic costs.",

Viruses for which real-time polymerase chain reaction and reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction assays are available, including RSV, human metapneumovirus, parainfluenza virus types 1 to 4, human rhinovirus (HRV), human bocavirus (HboV), adenovirus, human coronaviruses, and influenza viruses A and B. Several studies of child care attendees have shown that coinfections with multiple viruses are common, ranging from 27% to 44%.19, 23, 24 Children with viral coinfections had a significantly longer duration of illness, although the severity of illness was not worse. This contrasts with a finding of more severe disease in viral coinfections among hospitalized children on an inpatient ward and in a pediatric intensive care unit.25, 26, 27 Coinfections with RSV tend to have higher disease severity.25 Rhinovirus is the most commonly detected virus in outpatient studies of viral respiratory tract infections in CDCCs.19, 23 Human rhinovirus is increasingly identified as a cause of more severe infection in healthy children and is considered a possible trigger for asthma and cause of hospitalization in children younger than 5 years, similar to RSV.28, 29\n",

Infections occurring during infancy may provide important signals to the newborn's maturing immune system.64 Prescott et al75 suggest that, as a response to infection, an infant's immune response shifts from type 2 helper T cells (similar to that in adults with atopy) toward one based more on cytokines derived from type 1 helper T cells (as in adults without atopy). They propose that infections that stimulate type 1 helper T-cell response inhibit the normal newborn type 2 response. Therefore, children not exposed to the increased infections maintain the type 2 helper cell atopic phenotype.75, 77\n",

The PCV23 is recommended for children 2 through 18 years of age who are at increased risk for IPD, such children with functional or anatomic asplenia or other immunocompromising conditions.90 Children younger than 2 years fail to mount an adequate response to the 23-valent adult vaccine.90\n",

In addition, Vesikari et al99 reported greater than 90% efficacy against all episodes of acute OM associated with culture positive influenza after immunization of children 6 to 36 months with a live attenuated vaccine administered intranasally. A study from Italy and Switzerland showed an impressive 43.7% reduction in the number of acute OM episodes after vaccination with the live attenuated intranasal influenza vaccine.97 As was demonstrated with the pneumococcal vaccine,94 the greatest reduction was seen in children with recurrent acute OM. However, Hoberman et al100 reported that the use of the inactivated vaccine in day care attendees aged 6 to 24 months during 2 respiratory seasons did not reduce the burden of acute OM or the estimated time with middle ear effusion. They suggest that the proportion of viral respiratory infections due to influenza virus may be lower in children younger than 24 months so that the complications of noninfluenza viral infections may have obscured any effect of influenza vaccination. Decreases in noninfluenza respiratory illnesses and in the amount of antibiotic consumption have also been noted after live intranasal vaccine administration.97, 101\n",

Kotch et al102 showed that seamless, impermeable counters and touch-less faucets and cabinet doors are associated with significantly fewer episodes of diarrhea among children and fewer sick days among CDCC staff.

This diagnosis is particularly prone to cause parental anxiety\u2014they may feel they are being told that it is their fault that their child is sick \u201call the time.\u201d It is crucial to establish trust with the family when you explain the diagnosis and what can be done to decrease the frequency of the common infections. Families frequently want unwarranted diagnostic testing such as blood work or radiographs, so it is necessary to fully explain the condition in ways that they can understand and why it is not considered a serious condition. A disconnect between parental and physician perceived severity of illness is a significant risk factor for parental dissatisfaction. It is important to demonstrate interest in the child and an understanding the disruptive nature of daycaritis. Compassion and empathy will help the family accept the diagnosis and listen to advice. Parents should be educated on the etiologies of daycaritis, the importance of immunization, hand washing techniques, and the reasoning behind general day care illness exclusion policies. They should be instructed to start hand washing lessons at home and make sure that their children's blankets and toys are vigorously cleaned at least weekly.",
