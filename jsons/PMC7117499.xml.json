            "text": "Despite the vaccination procedures applied in most European countries, canine distemper (CD) is still one of the most serious threats to the susceptible carnivore population in Central and Eastern Europe. CD is a highly contagious viral infection of different carnivores that belong to numerous animal families, such as Canidae, Mustelidae, Procyonidae, Felidae and many others (Kov\u00e1cs et al., 1983, Appel, 1987, Blixenkrone-M\u00f8ller et al., 1993, Gemma et al., 1996, Barrett, 1999, Kim et al., 2001, Shin et al., 2004, Kabakci et al., 2004, Lan et al., 2006). CD is caused by the canine distemper virus (CDV) which belongs to the Morbillivirus genus of the Paramyxoviridae virus family. The clinical symptoms of the disease include severe respiratory, digestive and neurological signs with frequently fatal outcome (Appel and Summers, 1995; Stettler et al., 1997; Frisk et al., 1999; Ozkul et al., 2004). The clinical evolution of the infection is characterized by a specific biphasic fever curve, and other clinical signs that do not respond to symptomatic antimicrobial therapy. Domestic canine populations seem to act as reservoirs for other receptive carnivores (Carpenter et al., 1998, Lednicky et al., 2004).",

Since the hemagglutinin (H) gene shows the greatest extent of genetic variation that allows distinction of various lineages (Haas et al., 1997, Harder and Osterhaus, 1997, Mochizuki et al., 1999, Iwatsuki et al., 2000; Uema et al., 2005; Martella et al., 2006), the authors designed a primer pair that allowed the complete amplification of the H gene. Due to the fact that several lineages can be present during the same time within one geographic region (Haas et al., 1999, Lan et al., 2005), and the fact that the possibility of point mutations at the attachment site of the primers is relatively high for the H gene, a more conserved region of the viral genome, the large polymerase (L) gene was targeted for diagnostic purposes.",

            "text": "The main objective of the work described in the present study was to design a reliable test that can be used on a routine basis for the fast and proper diagnosis of CDV infections. Another objective of the investigation was to clarify the phylogenetic relationships among the Hungarian-, and other CDV strains from surrounding countries and around the world. Due to the fact that cases of infection with CDV of vaccinated animals have been reported recently, when the infection was demonstrated by PCR using the viral RNA isolated from cell cultures infected with tissue homogenates (Lan et al., 2006), the authors also designed a restriction fragment length polymorphism assay that allows the fast and reliable differentiation of the wild-type viruses from the vaccine strains. The availability of a reliable test for the fast discrimination of wild-type viruses and vaccine strains is very important, since in some situations the vaccination itself could be blamed by the owner of the animal for certain clinical signs or manifestations in cases where recently vaccinated animals get infected before developing proper immunity. Without a specific test that can differentiate between the virus strains used in the vaccine and the one that actually infected the animal, the owner could interpret the incident as a failure of the vaccination, or even worse, he or she might think that the vaccine itself was the cause of the infection and eventual death of the animal. The differentiation is also useful in cases of abortion of pregnant females that were vaccinated against CD during gestation. Vaccine manufacturers rule out the possibility of this event, but in most situations the owners and the clinicians demand an irrefutable proof whether the abortion was linked or not to the virus strain present in the vaccine. Due to these and several other reasons, there is definite need for the reliable differentiation of the wild-type viruses and the virus strains used in vaccines.",

The interval of time between the collection of the first and the last samples lasted more than a month in both cases. In the phylogenetical study, a number of six positive samples from the first, and three from the second period were used. These samples consisted of blood, urine and nasal swabs. During the investigation of blood samples, both serum and separated leukocytes were used. The authors decided to collect blood samples, because a positive result obtained in case of a blood sample was considered to be the most reliable proof for the viremic status of the animal. For this purpose, blood was collected in two separate tubes from each animal: one contained an anticoagulant (EDTA), while the other did not. The serum was obtained from the clotted blood following centrifugation (20 min at 1500 \u00d7 g). In case of the anticoagulant-treated samples, the leukocytes were separated from the rest of the blood components using the hypoosmotic shock technique.",

In order to determine the frequency of this infection, we analyzed a total number of 150 samples taken from dogs that presented clinical symptoms suggesting CD, and from carcasses of dogs that succumbed following CD clinical signs, or that presented pathological changes that could have been attributed to CDV infection. For fast and reliable diagnosis we designed a pair of \u201cdiagnostic\u201d primers that targeted the L conserved domain of the viral genome. Due to the conservative aspect of the amplified segment, this primer pair could probably be used to detect all CDV strains currently present in Hungary. Out of the 150 analyzed samples, 46 (30.66%) proved to be positive for CDV, indicating that CDV still represents a high risk to the canine population in Hungary. Despite widespread vaccination, CDV infects a high number of animals, causing severe illness, frequently resulting in fatal outcome. The high number of CDV negative samples obtained from animals showing respiratory signs can be explained by the fact that, in many cases, animals are misdiagnosed with CD when showing respiratory and other related clinical signs. In many situations, the cause of the clinical signs is not the CDV infection, but infections caused by other viral (canine parainfluenza virus, canine adenovirus 2, canine respiratory coronavirus, etc.) and/or bacterial (Bordetella sp., Pasteurella sp., etc.) agents. Because the initial clinical signs following infection can be indicative not only of CD, the signs can be misleading and the regular use of the specific diagnostic tests, such as those based on PCR, are indicated for the proper diagnosis of CDV. Based on the nucleotide sequences deposited in the GenBank, and the conserved character of the L gene, primer pair \u201cA\u201d theoretically attaches to the genome of all currently circulating wild-type viruses. Since the sensitivity test demonstrated that it can detect CDV RNA concentrations of up to 102, primer pair \u201cA\u201d can be used as a specific diagnostic test for CDV infections.",

Since the introduction of vaccinations for the prevention of CD, several virus strains (such as the Onderstepoort, Rockborn, Snyder Hill, Lederle or the Convac strains) have been used (Chappuis, 1995). Due to the fact that primer pair \u201cA\u201d also attaches to the genome of vaccine strains, and that recent immunization of animals with an attenuated live vaccine might cause difficulties in the evaluation of the PCR test, we developed an RFLP test to accurately differentiate the vaccine strains from the wild-type strains. This test is based on the presence of a constant enzyme cleavage site on the region amplified by primer pair \u201cB\u201d. Since the nucleotide sequence of the Lederle strain is not present in the GenBank, to make sure that the result of our RFLP test is reliable, prior to designing the test, we sequenced the amplicons obtained using primer pair \u201cC\u201d on one of the vaccines (Canigen DH(A2)PPi/L, Ceva Sante Animale, France) that according to the manufacturer contains the above mentioned strain. Based on the obtained nucleotide sequence (accession number: DQ903854), and on the sequences of other vaccine strains already available in the GenBank, the newly designed RFLP test works on all vaccine strains currently applied to prevent CD in Hungary. According to these sequences, the cleavage site on which the newly designed RFLP test is based is present on all investigated vaccine strains, and it is absent from all the analyzed wild-type strains retrieved from the GenBank. More precisely, it is based on the change of the nucleotide at the position 8139 of the viral genome from thymine (T) in the vaccine strains to cytosine (C) in the wild-type strains. This point mutation can be found in the nucleotide sequences of all wild-type CDVs deposited in the GenBank. The presence of the mutation does not cause any change in the amino acid sequence of the wild-type strains at the given position. The nucleotide sequence that suffered the described mutation is also the recognition sequence for the PsiI endonuclease. Due to this fact, the PsiI enzyme will cut only the amplicons of the vaccine strains and will leave the amplicons of all wild-type strains undigested, therefore it can be used for the fast and reliable differentiation of the wild-type CDV strains from the currently used vaccine strains. The positive result of the enzymatic digestion was clearly visible in case of the virus strains from vaccines as a double band (294 and 816 bp) by transillumination of the gels in UV light. Meanwhile, the amplicons of the field samples remained uncut and formed a single characteristic band (1110 bp).",

The analysis has shown that the diversity of the Hungarian strains is very high, and that they are placed on different branches of the phylogenetic tree. Molecular analyses performed in other countries demonstrate similar findings: in a given geographical region more than one genotype of CDV can be present at the same time (Haas et al., 1999, Lednicky et al., 2004, Martella et al., 2006). The studies indicate that genotypes from far away countries appear sooner or later in the dog population due to the intense, uncontrolled trade and travel of dogs. This observation is also validated by the fact that Hungarian strains are closely related to other CDVs currently present in other parts of the world, including Europe and other distant regions, such as China and North America.

            "text": "The investigation revealed that in the case of large, open population, such as in dog shelters, nasal swab samples are not always reliable in the diagnosis of CD. Out of the 99 clinically ill dogs that were examined in the shelter during a 1-year period, there were 16 cases when both blood samples and nasal swab samples were analyzed. For six dogs, both the blood (serum and separated leukocytes) and nasal swab samples proved to be positive, and hence the results were regarded as proof of viremia caused by the CDV infection. Animals that had the PCR test using their serum positive, also tested positive on the separated leukocytes test. We could not identify animals with only one of their blood tests (serum or leukocytes) positive. On the other hand, for 10 dogs, only the nasal swab samples turned out to be positive, while the repeated examination of both blood samples gave only negative results. This means that the virus remained at the entrance site, on the nasal mucosa and did not actually cause viremia, or it could mean that viremia had been overcome. Therefore, in 10 out of 16 of these situations (62.5%), the positive results obtained using only the nasal swab samples gave misleading, diagnostically false positive results. These results, as well as the decreasing number of clinical cases at the shelter also demonstrate the efficiency of the CD preventive program started during the fall of 2005 (Demeter et al., 2006).",
