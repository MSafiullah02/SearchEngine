First anti-infectious plasma potein concentrates were the \"standard IgG\" preparations. They were produced by the cold-ethanol fractionation methods and did not make an exception to the above: noninfectious severe AEs occurred while infectious AEs were rarely reported. Indeed, prior to the introduction of mass screening for infection markers of plasma donations, inadvertent transmission of HIV to recipients of factor VIII and factor IX concentrates did occur, while IgG concentrates obtained from the same plasma pool did rarely transmit HIV (Morgenthaler 2001) . Rare transmissions were restricted to products not exposed to low pH. The very few incidences of HIV and some incidences of HCV transmission by IgG concentrates in the early 1990s, together with many cases of coagulation factor concentrates transmitted viral disease, clearly demonstrated the need to establish standardized measures to render plasma products pathogen safe. In the second half of the 1990s, authorities shifted regulatory emphasis from a scientific review of the processes to a focus on compliance to current good manufacturing practice (cGMP). The focus on cGMP compliance was applied to all aspects of plasma fractionation and the clinical use of plasma products. Court injunctions and warning letters were the consequences of this paradigm shift by authorities.

Ensuring quality of an IgG concentrate starts with collection of plasma, its correct handling, and cautious pooling. Donor selection (level A, Fig. 12 .1): Plasma fractionated to current best practice IgG concentrates all are from donors donating blood or plasma from free will. There are two types of donations: whole blood from which plasma is collected after centrifugation (recovered plasma) or plasma obtained by apheresis device (apheresis or source plasma) (Table 12 .1). There is epic, for several decades' ongoing debate which of the two ways of plasma collection is of higher ethical and better biological quality. There is no reason to step into this discussion in this book chapter. However, it has to be acknowledged that apheresis plasma collection of volumes at the upper end of what is allowed might have an influence on protein composition of the donated plasma (Laub et al. 2010) . As GMP covers minimal requirements for quality, and because having been accused remunerated donations being of lesser quality and safety, the apheresis plasma collecting and fractionating industry has introduced additional voluntary regulations. These are the International Quality Plasma Program (IQPP) introducing qualified donor standard, implementation of a donor deferral registry, and a drug abuse screening and the Quality Standards of Excellence, Assurance, and Leadership (QSEAL). QSEAL covers control on incoming plasma, inventory hold, NAT testing, intermediates purchased form external suppliers, recovered plasma specification, qualified donor, and viral markers (http://www.pptaglobal.org/safety-quality/ standards/qseal; accessed June 2017). With the implementation of these voluntary standards, no relevant differences are found in pathogen marker frequencies of either type of plasma donation (EMEA 2002) . In summary, the main goal of donor selection is to ensure that donors with high risk are excluded form donating, or their donation is withheld from further processing (Table 12 .2). The donor is informed if HIV positive.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 933, "end": 951, "text": "(Laub et al. 2010)", "ref_id": "BIBREF23"}, {"start": 1864, "end": 1875, "text": "(EMEA 2002)", "ref_id": "BIBREF14"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 197, "end": 204, "text": "Fig. 12", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 518, "end": 527, "text": "(Table 12", "ref_id": "TABREF1"}, {"start": 2045, "end": 2054, "text": "(Table 12", "ref_id": "TABREF1"}], "section": "Plasma Collection: The Starting Point for Quality and Safety of a Plasma-Derived Product"}, {"text": "Finally yet importantly, plasma donations require careful handling to prevent formation and accumulation of vasoactive (e.g., prekallikrein activator (PKA)) or coagulation promoting (e.g., coagulation factor FXIa) substances. Due to their physicochemical properties, their removal during the manufacturing process may remain imperfect, and they may induce severe adverse events. Donation is allowed when total plasma protein content is >60 g/L (the USA, Germany) and when level is IgG > 6 g/L (Germany) c EU: to be assessed after every fifth donation; USA, serum protein electrophoresis every 4 months; the protein quality of donations from donors donating very high volumes per year having low plasma protein content has been addressed recently (Laub et al. 2010) Mass screening of donations (level A, Fig. 12 .1): Mass screening is the measure to exclude donations potentially contaminated by pathogens such as virus(es). Stable blood products inherit a particular risk for transmission of viruses because the staring material being a pool of thousands of individual donations (Table 12. 3). Parameters of mass screening for virus markers are outlined in Table 12 .4 and include serological and nucleic acid amplification technology (NAT) testing. NAT testing in addition to serological screening was introduced in order to shorten the time period of \"window donations.\" During a window period, a donor already harbors the infective agent and is infective while seroconversion has not occurred yet, i.e., antibody formation has not set in, or antibodies are at a titer not detectable by validated serological methods. By introducing NAT testing, the estimated risk of an undetected infectious donation entering the blood supply dropped as given in Detailed health history questionnaire relative to current known safety risks, designed to obtain information, e.g., about acute infections, (silently progressing), chronic illness, or elevated risk, for having acquired blood-borne pathogens (e.g., social behavior, sexually transmitted diseases, or having had tattoos, acupuncture, or ear/body piercing in the past 12 months) or having received xenotransplants (cornea) of animal origin or having been treated by pituitary (growth) hormones of human origin \u2022 Donor deferral, e.g., donors having traveled or lived in endemic regions; donor deferral is a moving target (Yang et al. 2017 ) \u2022 Inventory hold, e.g., allow for the retrieval of plasma prior to use if new post-donation information becomes available regarding the donor's health status The apheresis plasma collecting industry has in addition established the IQPP a and QSEAL b standards that in addition to the above add 1. Qualified donor standard; donor successfully passing two donor medical history screenings and required viral testing 2. Community-based donors; only donors accepted with proof of a permanent address 3. The use of PPTA Source's National Donor Deferral Registry (NDDR) helps ensure that deferred donors cannot donate their plasma again, e.g., at another center 4.

Viral marker standard As 2/3 of plasma for fractionation is obtained from remunerated plasmapheresis donations, additional voluntary standards have been introduced by the corresponding plasmapheresis collecting industry to minimize the risk of infections remunerated donations might harbor Donor deferral can be established, e.g., a donor has lived for a certain time in a given region of the world and has received a xenotransplant, a drug (D'Aignaux et al. 1999) or medical devices with parts of animal origin. Donor deferral is a moving object (Yang et al. 2017) a IQPP International Quality Plasma Program b QSAEL Quality Standards of Excellence, Assurance, and Leadership; a certification program to which donation centers have to comply After implementation of virus reduction steps in the fractionation process of plasma-derived medicinal products and thorough the enforcement by authorities of the rigorous implementation of good manufacturing practice (GMP) rules, no further proven transmission of (enveloped) viruses was reported. Criteria invariably present in true virus transmission by stable plasma products are (1) several patients infected with the same virus, (2) cluster of transmission (e.g., a restricted number of hospitals), (3) it is possible to identify one/a few lots that were used in all of the affected hospitals, and (4) the same virus is identified in the relevant product lot(s) and in patients treated with these lots. If these criteria are not fulfilled, transmission by plasma products of pathogen remains uncertain b HEV infection by genotypes 1 and 2 cause large epidemics in in tropical and subtropical regions. The transmission is via the fecal-oral route. Infections by genotypes 3 and 4 are an emerging threat in countries of the northern hemisphere and are a food-borne disease. Pigs are the animal reservoir for this zoonotic virus. These genotypes have been identified in blood donors in Europe. Transfusion associated with HEV infection was reported (Tamura et al. 2007 ). Significant acute hepatitis can be the result of chronic HEV infection in immune compromised patients (Motte et al. 2012) , while in immunocompetent patients, HEV infection has been associated to neurological complications (continued) Fig. 12. 2. In addition to the minimal requirements given by GMP, most manufacturers request human parvovirus B19 and HAV NAT testing of plasma donations. NAT testing is performed in mini-pools and largely can be automated. Aliquots from bar code labeled pilot tubes are transferred to, e.g., a micro titer plate. In such an X/Y layout, each aliquot is unequivocally associated to an individual donation. Starting NAT testing, aliquots from the aliquots are pooled, undergo validated amplification of part(s) of pathogen's genome, and the resulting genome equivalents are quantified. The size of the mini-pool depends on amplification efficiency and minimal infectious dose of the given pathogen. In case a mini-pool is reactive, pooling is repeated, this time by rows and columns. From the row and the column pool Nogueira et al. 2017; Venturi et al. 2016 ). Prenatal infection is associated with microcephaly, while infection in adults can be fatal or be associated with Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome or severe thrombocytopenia f The transmission by non-leukocyte depleted erythrocyte concentrates might represent a risk for transmission. Four possible transmission events by non-leukocyte-depleted erythrocyte concentrates have been reported. In one case of probable transmission, the most likely route of infection was by contaminated plasma-derived factor VIII concentrate g In May 2017 a report on two patients receiving blood-clotting factor concentrates dying form sCJD was posted electronically (Urwin et al. 2017) . A causal link between the treatment with plasma products and the development of sCJD has not been established Mass screening for the agent of variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease has become feasible; however, it is not practiced (Jackson et al. 2014) being reactive, the X/Y layout allows the identification of the reactive donation. The contaminated donation is withheld from pooling and is destroyed safely. Plasma fractionation starts with pooling of individual donations to an appropriate volume. Before starting the fractionation process, an in-process control is performed to ascertain absence of potential contaminating viruses (Table 12 .4). This reduces the risk of pathogen transmission and reduces the financial risk of losing an entire lot of IgG concentrate.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 746, "end": 764, "text": "(Laub et al. 2010)", "ref_id": "BIBREF23"}, {"start": 2367, "end": 2384, "text": "(Yang et al. 2017", "ref_id": "BIBREF55"}, {"start": 3748, "end": 3771, "text": "(D'Aignaux et al. 1999)", "ref_id": "BIBREF11"}, {"start": 3854, "end": 3872, "text": "(Yang et al. 2017)", "ref_id": "BIBREF55"}, {"start": 5302, "end": 5321, "text": "(Tamura et al. 2007", "ref_id": "BIBREF49"}, {"start": 5427, "end": 5446, "text": "(Motte et al. 2012)", "ref_id": "BIBREF30"}, {"start": 6375, "end": 6396, "text": "Nogueira et al. 2017;", "ref_id": "BIBREF33"}, {"start": 6397, "end": 6416, "text": "Venturi et al. 2016", "ref_id": "BIBREF53"}, {"start": 7058, "end": 7077, "text": "(Urwin et al. 2017)", "ref_id": "BIBREF51"}, {"start": 7306, "end": 7327, "text": "(Jackson et al. 2014)", "ref_id": "BIBREF19"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 803, "end": 810, "text": "Fig. 12", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1079, "end": 1089, "text": "(Table 12.", "ref_id": "TABREF1"}, {"start": 1157, "end": 1165, "text": "Table 12", "ref_id": "TABREF1"}, {"start": 5560, "end": 5568, "text": "Fig. 12.", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 7712, "end": 7721, "text": "(Table 12", "ref_id": "TABREF1"}], "section": "Plasma Collection: The Starting Point for Quality and Safety of a Plasma-Derived Product"}, {"text": "Over many decades, the development of IgG fractionation was driven to achieve intravenous tolerability and increase recovery and purity of the concentrates.

Furthermore, the results verify that the use of model viruses is appropriate to predict the inactivation characteristics of newly emerging viruses when their physicochemical properties are well characterized results in fatal neurodegenerative diseases of mammals. Although a protein-only agent, PrP Sc is \"infectious\" in a sense that the misfolded protein might induce conformation changes of the normal PrP C resulting in sticky rod-like and fibrillary particles accumulating in the brain. Serum, plasma, and leukocytes from vCJD patients might harbor infectious PrP Sc . Indeed, transmission of PrP Sc has been reported in three symptomatic and one non-symptomatic cases of non-leukocyte-depleted red blood cell concentrates (Hewitt et al. 2006; Peden et al. 2004 ). Measures to eliminate possibly contaminating PrP Sc during plasma fractionation became mandatory. It is accepted that inactivation of PrP Sc is not possible without destruction of the biological activity of a plasma product. Hence, elimination by partitioning or exclusion by size remains the two possibilities (Cai et al. 2002) . Validation studies were performed at different manufacturers' site with different spikes and different detection systems. The manufacturing steps studied for removal capacity of PrP Sc included precipitation, adsorption, chromatography, and filtration, as well as combined steps. They proved to be highly potent in removal of the TSE agents possibly contaminating plasma (Cai et al. 2013) . Reduction by individual steps in sequence was additive ( pathogenic prion protein almost exclusively located in the CNS pathogenic prion protein found in CNS but also in abundance in some lymphatic tissue Furthermore, the declining incidence of vCJD, the stringent donor selection due to geographic donor deferral policy, and the additive nature of removal steps render the agent of vCJD unlikely to be transmitted by plasma products. Indeed, no proven transmission of vCJD by IgG concentrates was ever reported (Ritchie et al. 2016) , even not when the administration of a possibly PrP Sc contaminated IgG concentrate occurred (El-Shanawany et al. 2009 ). Ascertained transmission by other plasma products has not been described neither.

However, the Emerging Infectious Disease Journal in May 2017 posted in electronic form a report on two patients receiving coagulation factor concentrates and dying from sCJD. Authors conclude (citation): \"A causal link between the treatment with plasma products and the development of sCJD has not been established, and the occurrence of these cases may simply reflect a chance event in the context of systematic surveillance for CJD in large populations.\" It will be of outmost importance whether and how many new cases will be reported in future.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 1077, "end": 1097, "text": "(Hewitt et al. 2006;", "ref_id": "BIBREF16"}, {"start": 1098, "end": 1115, "text": "Peden et al. 2004", "ref_id": "BIBREF36"}, {"start": 1430, "end": 1447, "text": "(Cai et al. 2002)", "ref_id": "BIBREF8"}, {"start": 1821, "end": 1838, "text": "(Cai et al. 2013)", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}, {"start": 2353, "end": 2374, "text": "(Ritchie et al. 2016)", "ref_id": "BIBREF40"}, {"start": 2469, "end": 2494, "text": "(El-Shanawany et al. 2009", "ref_id": "BIBREF13"}, {"start": 2921, "end": 2942, "text": "(Crowder et al. 2017;", "ref_id": "BIBREF10"}, {"start": 2943, "end": 2967, "text": "Martin and Trouvin 2013;", "ref_id": "BIBREF28"}, {"start": 2968, "end": 2985, "text": "Urwin et al. 2016", "ref_id": "BIBREF52"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 2639, "end": 2652, "text": "(Table 12.11)", "ref_id": "TABREF1"}], "section": "Transmissible Spongiform Encephalopathies (TSEs)"}, {"text": "Final formulation: To ensure stability/tolerability of a product over its shelf life, the right selection of stabilizers is of particular importance.
