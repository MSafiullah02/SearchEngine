            "text": "The method of preservation of samples for TEM can influence image interpretation so it is important to stabilize the sample with as little change from the in vivo state as possible. There are two main methods of stabilizing (fixing) samples for TEM: chemical fixation and cryo-fixation. There are advantages and disadvantages to both. Chemical fixation is the most common method and, although time consuming, is an easy, repeatable method that requires very little specialized equipment. Alternatively, cryo-fixation methods seek to preserve samples in as near the in vivo state as possible by stabilizing instantaneously and reducing or eliminating the use of chemicals. Cryo-fixation methods are preferable to chemical fixation methods; however, they have significant technical and financial disadvantages.",

These protocols are relatively quick and easy to do. The main disadvantage of using chemical fixation is that the introduction of toxic chemicals to the sample can have an unknown effect on ultrastructure. Fixative penetrates even soft biological material slowly which allows changes to occur within the sample before it is fully stabilized, for example redistribution and extraction of ions and soluble proteins [2], extraction and rearrangement of phospholipids [3], mismatch in osmotic conditions leading to organelle blooming and non-isotropic shrinkage [4]. There is no such thing as a \u201cuniversal fixative\u201d and fixatives do not preserve all structures within cells equally. Another important disadvantage of chemical fixation is that at every stage during the process antigens in the sample are destroyed. Therefore, it is not possible to carry out immunogold labelling experiments using chemically fixed and epoxy resin embedded samples.",

            "text": "The only viable alternative to the deleterious effects of chemical fixation and dehydration is to preserve samples by freezing the water present rapidly enough to prevent ice crystals forming. If samples are frozen quickly enough the water inside the sample is vitrified and both soluble and non-soluble structures are held in a glass-like matrix (amorphous ice), stabilizing the sample instantaneously. Amorphous ice is non-destructive, but to achieve full vitrification of cellular water very high cooling rates are required [5]. If these cooling rates are not reached, crystalline ice forms and solutes within the cell are trapped between the crystals forming a network of segregated compartments. When viewed in the microscope, this is known as ice segregation artifact and is particularly obvious in badly frozen nuclei where it appears as a \u201ccracking\u201d pattern (Fig. 1). Once frozen, the sample may be stored in liquid nitrogen (\u2212196 \u00b0C) before further processing. The temperature cannot be allowed to climb above the re-vitrification point of water (around \u2212140 \u00b0C) or ice crystals will form. The advantage of using freezing techniques to preserve samples is that they are stabilized instantaneously without the need for chemicals. However, the disadvantages are that at atmospheric pressure good freezing only occurs within a few microns of the surface at best, and the techniques involved are difficult and time-consuming requiring dedicated equipment.\n",

One of the greatest variations is the time that samples are kept in substitution medium prior to embedding. It is widely accepted that leaving samples in fixative and/or solvents during room temperature chemical fixation can rearrange cell components, especially lipids [3], and extract soluble cytoplasmic contents [2]. At low temperatures this process slows but does not stop. Therefore, there has to be a balance between sufficient time in substitution media for full replacement of water, and prolonged substitution leading to extraction of cell components. Dedicated freeze substitution units are available which finely control the temperature changes required during substitution, and in some cases can be programmed to control the addition of solvents. These units are expensive to purchase; however, recently a protocol has been developed which negates the need for dedicated freeze substitution units [13].",

Sandwiches will probably separate in the liquid; take care to note how the sapphire discs separate, so you know which side the cells cover.Using cooled fine forceps ensure the discs lay in the FS medium, cells facing uppermost (see\nNote\n8). Remove aluminum cup containing any unused FS medium and place in fume hood to get to room temperature before disposal.Leave samples in FS medium until program has reached \u221250 \u00b0C (12:00).Before 12:00, place a clean aluminum cup in the FS unit chamber containing 1 ml Lowicryl HM20 (see\nNote\n3) and 3 ml acetone. Mix well and leave for a few minutes to cool. Adjust volumes according to the number of samples you have, but keep the ratio the same. The volumes described here assume 4 aluminum cups are present.At 12:00, using a cooled plastic pipette remove the FS medium from each sample aluminum cup and place in a waste aluminum cup also in the chamber.Taking care to note any sapphire movement, gently add 1 ml of cold 1:3 resin\u2013acetone mix to each aluminum cup containing a sample, using a clean cooled pipette. Leave for 30 min.Remove the aluminum cup containing any leftover 1:3 resin mix and place in fume hood.Place a clean aluminum cup into the chamber containing 2 ml Lowicryl HM20 and 2 ml acetone. Mix well and allow to cool.After 30 min, using a cooled plastic pipette remove the 1:3 resin mix from each sample aluminum cup and place in the waste aluminum cup also in the chamber.Taking care to note any sapphire movement, gently add 1 ml of cold 1:1 resin\u2013acetone mix using a clean cooled pipette. Leave for 30 min.Remove the aluminum cup containing any leftover 1:1 resin mix and place in fume hood.Place a clean aluminum cup into the chamber and mix 3 ml Lowicryl HM20 and 1 ml acetone. Allow to cool.After a further 30 min, using a cooled plastic pipette remove the 1:1 resin mix from each sample aluminum cup and place in the waste aluminum cup also in the chamber.Again, taking care to note any sapphire movement, gently add 1 ml of cold 3:1 resin\u2013acetone mix using a clean cooled pipette. Leave for 30 min.Remove the aluminum cup containing any leftover 3:1 resin mix and place in fume hood.Place a clean aluminum cup into the chamber containing 14 ml Lowicryl HM20 resin. Allow to cool.After 30 min, using a cooled plastic pipette remove the 3:1 resin mix from each sample aluminum cup and place in the waste aluminum cup also in the chamber.Taking care to note any sapphire movement, gently add 1 ml of cold resin using a clean cooled pipette. Leave for 30 min.After 30 min, remove the resin and place in the waste aluminum cup in the chamber.Repeat steps 27 and 28 twice.Cool a flat embedding mold (supplied with FS unit) in the chamber during the last infiltration step.Using cooled tools carefully place each sapphire, cells facing uppermost, into a compartment within the embedding mold, ensuring the disc sits on the metal base, and gently cover with cold Lowicryl resin (see\nNote\n9\u2014handling Lowicryl resin).Cool a UV transparent plastic cup (supplied with FS unit) and place over the embedding mold. Seal with a small amount of Lowicryl resin so that oxygen is excluded during polymerization.Place the UV light (supplied with FS unit) over the chamber, program in the polymerization protocol, and start the program:48 h at \u221250 \u00b0C, with UVTemperature rise from \u221250 \u00b0C to room temperature (20 \u00b0C) at 20\u00b0 per hour (3.5 h), with UV48 h at room temperature, with UV\nDispose of waste chemicals according to local regulations.After polymerization remove the embedding mold and push out the hardened blocks. Place in to labelled boxes. Blocks can be stored indefinitely (see\nNote\n10). When ready to cut sections first prepare some polymerized epoxy resin blocks from BEEM capsules to provide support for the Lowicryl blocks, as follows:Remove the pointed end of the polymerized epoxy resin blocks with a mini hacksaw to provide a flat surface.Carefully trim the Lowicryl resin block to the region containing the sapphire disc using a fresh razor blade.Using epoxy glue, stick the Lowicryl resin block containing the sapphire onto the flat surface of the epoxy resin block, with the sapphire uppermost. Allow to dry.With a razor blade, trim the thin layer of Lowicryl resin from around the edges of the sapphire disc.Immerse the block briefly in liquid nitrogen to dislodge the sapphire disc. Discard the disc, the cells will remain embedded in the Lowicryl resin.\nWith an ultramicrotome, section the Lowicryl block en face to produce sections containing longitudinal views of cells in the monolayer, all in the same orientation and plane (see\nNote\n11).Collect sections on Formvar-coated grids (see\nNote\n12). When using the 2 % uranyl acetate freeze substitution medium it is not necessary to add any further contrast.Collect images using a transmission electron microscope (see\nNote\n13). See [1, 14] for examples of cells prepared using this method.For immunogold labelling studies the procedure above is very similar; however, use a FS medium containing a lower concentration of uranyl acetate, for example 0.2 % [14].\n",

This will need to be kept on a stirrer in a fume hood for over an hour in order for all the UA crystals to dissolve. Then, prepare 2 % (v/v) uranyl acetate by adding 0.5 ml 20 % UA in methanol to 4.5 ml 99.9 % analytical grade acetone. Mix well. Store in dark glass bottle at 4 \u00b0C.It is not necessary to store 99.9 % analytical grade acetone under a molecular sieve to keep water-free (as recommended in some older protocols). During storage under a molecular sieve the acetone discolors over time, so it is possible the sieve adds some form of contaminant. We have never recorded any deleterious effects of using analytical grade acetone which has not been stored under a molecular sieve.Place each resin component into a screw top glass jar and mix the resin by bubbling dry nitrogen gas through the mixture, while holding the lid close to the neck of the jar. This eliminates oxygen from the jar which is important as Lowicryl HM20 does not polymerize effectively in the presence of oxygen.Preliminary experiments using \u201cnaked\u201d sapphire discs indicated that cell adhesion was a potential weakness as cells were lost during processing. Collagen IV, fetal calf serum (FCS), Matrigel Basement Membrane Matrix (BD Biosciences), and carbon were tested as substrate pretreatments to aid cell adhesion. Discs were incubated at 37 \u00b0C for 60 min in neat FCS, Matrigel or collagen IV solution (made to manufacturers specification), or discs were coated with 10 nm carbon using a high vacuum carbon coater (Agar Scientific). Most retention of cells was seen using FCS as the substrate pretreatment.To remove intercellular air pockets within samples protocols in the past have included inert, non-penetrating \u201cfillers,\u201d for example 1-hexadecene. To reduce the possibility of artifact, cryoprotectant/fillers were not used during this protocol. We did not see any detrimental effect of omitting this step, indeed it could be considered advantageous as the fillers act as a heat sink and reduce the cooling rate of the sample and prevent penetration of FS medium.Many protocols protect the sapphire discs during freezing using aluminum planchettes (supplied with the high-pressure freezer). These planchettes act as a barrier between liquid nitrogen and sapphire discs and act as a heat sink, reducing the cooling rate of the sample. In our protocol liquid nitrogen jets directly onto the sapphires producing excellent freezing across the whole sapphire disc.Protocols with long FS times and/or long warm up times were investigated but the short FS and short warm up protocol described here was found to produce consistently good freezing across large areas of the sapphire, provide good ultrastructural detail, allow minimal visible extraction of cytoplasmic contents and have the practical benefit of a shortened procedure.It is possible to see the cells on the sapphire discs down the FS unit binocular eyepieces by picking the disc up, above the liquid surface and slightly angling it towards the light. Cells will appear rough on the glass; if cells are not present the disc will have a smooth, reflective surface.Lowicryl HM20 resin can be difficult to work with at first. It has low surface tension and will creep along surfaces if drops escape from pipettes. It has a very strong odor so keep in the fume hood when possible. When filling the embedding mold, allow resin to settle and then top up to make sure the volume has been filled correctly. Wipe away any drips from the FS unit chamber with paper towel or else the embedding mold will become stuck to the chamber during polymerization.The resin should have a pink hue which demonstrates total polymerization. However, if the resin is colorless but hard, this indicates sufficient polymerization for cutting.Collect all the sections (even if incomplete) as the material will be close to the surface of the block face. Cells in culture can be very thin so it is easy to cut through the whole cell sheet while waiting to collect a complete section.If collecting thick sections for electron tomography, use Formvar (or equivalent) coated single slot grids. Also collect some thin sections (on Formvar, or equivalent, coated 200 mesh grids) for orientation.Lowicryl HM20 is not as beam stable in the TEM as epoxy resins. The Formvar support will help with this, but avoid long beam exposures at high intensities.\n",
