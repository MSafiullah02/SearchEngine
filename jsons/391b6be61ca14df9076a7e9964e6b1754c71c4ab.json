Nucleic tests of placenta and cord blood were negative for SARS-CoV-2, thus indicating the unlikely possibility of vertical transmission. Similarly, Dong et al., 9 reported a case of \"possible vertical transmission of SARS-CoV-2\" based on elevated SARS-CoV-2 specific antibodies (IgG and IgM) in neonatal serum samples taken 2 hours after delivery. Since IgM cannot cross the placenta, the possibility of intra-uterine transmission cannot be completely ruled out. Five RT-PCR tests on neonatal nasopharyngeal swabs taken from 2 hours to 16 days of age were however negative. Importantly, an optimal COVID-19 testing method for neonates has yet to be established. In conclusion, there is currently no definitive evidence of intra-uterine vertical transmission of COVID-19 in pregnant women diagnosed in the third trimester. All patients included in the current analysis developed symptoms and were diagnosed with COVID-19 late in pregnancy (3 rd trimester). The potential of intra-uterine vertical COVID-19 transmission in the first and second trimester is still unknown.
