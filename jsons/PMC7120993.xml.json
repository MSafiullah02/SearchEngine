Its high mortality rate for piglets, at 90\u201395% (Stevenson et al. 2013) is a key distinguishing factor between PEDv and the similar transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV). In suckling piglets, the PEDv incubation period is around two days, varying from 1 to 8 days. Diarrhea and vomiting can develop within 24 h, and as a result dehydration, anorexia and severe weight loss occur. In older pigs and sows, morbidity varies, and the period between onset and end of clinical symptoms is 3\u20134 weeks (Lee 2015; Stevenson et al. 2013).\n",

            "text": "The first known PEDv outbreaks occurred in Europe in the 1970s and 1990s, including in Belgium (Pensaert and de Bouck 1978) and Hungary (Nagy et al. 1996). While PEDv has since posed less of a threat to Europe, it has re-emerged in Italy (Martelli et al. 2008), Germany (Hanke et al. 2015), and France (Grasland et al. 2015) affecting pigs of all ages. PEDv spread to Asia in the early 1980s, where it was first detected in Japan in 1982, and then in South Korea, China, and Thailand (Chen et al. 2014). Since October 2010 China has seen a severe outbreak of PEDv, resulting in high porcine mortality rates and economic losses (Sun et al. 2012). PEDv was first detected in the United States (U.S.) in May 2013 (Stevenson et al. 2013) and then in Canada in January 2014 (Ojkic et al. 2015). These two countries have experienced severe economic losses due to the death of millions of suckling piglets and to diarrhea-derived weight loss in fattening pigs (Chen et al. 2014). The North American serotypes are most closely related to a recently emerged Chinese serotype (Huang et al. 2013) and since the North American epidemic, they have spread to South Korea, Taiwan, and Japan (Lee 2015).",

PEDv also causes a reduction in the number of goblet cells, the cells which secrete mucins to defend against microbial infection (Jung and Saif 2015). Cytolysis additionally leads to shortening and severe atrophy of intestinal villi, and causes the tips of villi to erode or become covered with attenuated epithelial cells (Jung et al. 2014; Stevenson et al. 2013). The atrophy of intestinal villi results in microscopic lesions, which are typical of an enteritic infection, (Sueyoshi et al. 1995). PEDv also results in swollen cells, and the detachment of cells from adjacent cells and from the membranes of the basal surfaces (Stevenson et al. 2013). These factors inhibit the pig\u2019s ability to absorb water and nutrients, and result in the malabsorption and diarrhea discussed above.",

            "text": "To produce an effective vaccine against PEDv, it is important to understand the structure of the virus. The Coronavirinae subfamily consists of three genera: alphacoronavirus, betacoronavirus, and gammacoronavirus. PEDv is an enveloped alphacoronavirus encoded by a 28 kilobase single-stranded, positive-sense RNA genome (Song and Park 2012). Coronaviruses have the largest known RNA genomes of all viruses (King 2011). The PEDv genome has seven open reading frames (ORFs), which code for three non-structural polyproteins, and four structural proteins [spike (S), envelope (E), membrane (M) and nucleocapsid (N)]. These open reading frames are flanked by a 5\u2032 cap and a 3\u2032 polyadenylated tail (Figs. 1 and 2) (Song and Park 2012). The ORFs encoding the non-structural proteins consist of two overlapping open reading frames, ORF1a and ORF1b, encoding two polyproteins. These polyproteins are processed by three virus-encoded proteases, a 3C-like proteinase (3CLpro) and two papain-like proteinases (PLP) which results in 16 non-structural proteins required for genome replication and mRNA transcription (John et al. 2016; Prentice et al. 2004). The accessory protein ORF3 is a potassium ion channel, but its role is not well defined (Wang et al. 2012). Reports on transmissible gastroenteritis coronavirus (TGEV), another alphacoronavirus, indicate that S and E are only present in the virion in small quantities, with E estimated to occur 20 times in a virion (Godet et al. 1992). N and M occur in higher numbers, at a ratio of 1N:3M (King 2011). A recent study examining mouse hepatitis virus (MHV, a betacoronavirus), severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus (SARS-CoV, a betacoronavirus), and feline coronavirus (FCoV, an alphacoronavirus), has determined that coronaviruses have approximately 1100 M dimers, 90 S trimers, and N proteins in a ratio from 3M:1N to 1M:1N (Neuman et al. 2011). Thus, M is the most abundant structural protein displayed at the viral surface.\n\n",

Called the CO-26K equivalent (COE), this epitope induced a neutralizing immune response and was identified through sequence homology with TGEV, which induces similar clinical symptoms in pigs (Chang et al. 2002).

However, most recombinant PEDv S production has occurred in plants, with all of these plants producing S-COE. The protein yield has varied widely, as has the plant host utilized. Historically, tobacco has been the most established and developed platform for high-yield plant-based recombinant protein production (Conley et al. 2011). As such, it follows suit that five of the fourteen reports of S-COE production were carried out using tobacco (Table 1). Four of the reports expressed S-COE in a stable transgenic line, with yields between 0.1% of TSP (Kang et al. 2005b) and 2.1% of TSP, depending on codon optimization (Kang et al. 2005a), while one reported transient production at 5% of TSP (Kang et al. 2004).\n",

While this is encouraging, in order for a vaccine to be effective, the antibodies produced must be virus-neutralizing. Bae et al (2003) took this next step, showing that feeding ground lyophilized transgenic tobacco containing S-COE was able to induce an immune response in mice that could inhibit PEDv plaque formation by 49.7% in comparison to controls.

            "text": "Much of the PEDv vaccine research has occurred in Asia, where outbreaks have been most severe, but none of the produced vaccines are completely effective against Asian PEDv strains (Song and Park 2012). Available Asian vaccines are based on strains that are genetically different from those sequenced in the U.S. that are currently causing epidemics globally (Huang et al. 2013). This has been on display in China, where vaccinated herds experienced PEDv breakouts that were found to be due to newer strains of the virus (Li et al. 2012). Two PEDv vaccines were given conditional licenses in the U.S. by the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA). The first was a vaccine originally produced by Harrisvaccines, Inc., and is based on their SirraVaxSM RNA platform. Using this platform, part of the RNA genome of a Venezuelan equine encephalitis alphavirus is replaced with a gene for PEDv S protein. After injection with genetic material, the pig\u2019s dendritic cells produce the S protein and an immune response is launched against the produced protein (Harrisvaccines, 2015). Merck Animal Health acquired Harrisvaccines in 2015 (Merck Animal Health 2015) but the product is still sold under a conditional license in the U.S., where safety and field trials are ongoing. The second conditionally licensed PEDv vaccine in the U.S. is an inactivated virus particle vaccine produced by Zoetis, Inc. (Zoetis 2016). Efficacy and potency studies are still in progress for the Zoetis vaccine, and duration of immunity has not been evaluated. It must be refrigerated, and used all at once when opened (Zoetis 2016). A third vaccine candidate is being developed by VIDO-Intervac (Vaccine and Infection Disease Organization\u2014International Vaccine Centre) in Canada and is currently undergoing field testing. This vaccine candidate is a subunit S1 protein expressed in mammalian HEK-293 T cells, and although it induced production of neutralizing antibodies, it was not fully protective to suckling piglets (Makadiya et al. 2016).",

The ability to vaccinate orally through feeding plant tissue is important as (Song et al. 2007) demonstrated that oral vaccination was more effective than injection for their PEDv vaccine. When comparing oral to intramuscular administration of their attenuated virus vaccine, Song et al. found that more IgA\u2019s were produced by orally vaccinated pigs, and that the mortality rate for this group was 13% in comparison to 60% for the intramuscular group. Current vaccines on the market are also either based on S, which is prone to mutations, or are killed or live attenuated vaccines. Live attenuated vaccines present risks, as they can potentially mutate and become pathogenic again, and allow for genome segment re-assortment on farms\u2014one Chinese PEDv strain is thought to have evolved from a live attenuated vaccine (Chen et al. 2010). Inactivated vaccines, in comparison, are safer, but have a high cost of production, and present concerns over the reliability of inactivation methods (Calvo-Pinilla et al. 2014). Both live attenuated and inactivated vaccines rule out the possibility of using \u201cdistinguish infected from vaccinated animals\u201d (DIVA) assays, as they contain the entire virus. As such, the market has a need of an effective subunit vaccine based on the current infectious strains. Further research on current plant-made candidates could prove to fill this need.",

There have been two instances where the direct immunogenicity of plant-produced S-COE has been tested. The first was incomplete, as it did not test whether the mounted immune response was virus-neutralizing (Huy et al. 2012). The other candidate that successfully took steps to test immunogenicity was the vaccine candidate produced by (Bae et al. 2003). However, while the immune response in mice inhibited PEDv plaque formation by 49.7% in comparison to controls, complete immunity was not achieved (Bae et al. 2003). Likely due to this, and due to the need for higher expression levels, no further efforts were made with this vaccine candidate.",
