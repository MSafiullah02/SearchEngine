However, the objective of the study 78 was not investigating the prevalence of COVID-19 infection in our patients, but reporting 79 the occurrence of the severe outcomes related to the COVID-19 infection such as 80 hospitalization and death. The strength of the study is that we have access to the full 81 medical records of the patients, so that if there had been a case of hospitalization or death 82 from COVID-19, it would have been detected. Although psoriasis and transplant patients 83 are older, burdened by metabolic and cardiovascular comorbidities and above all 84 immunosuppressed, there is no early signal of an increased hospitalization or death from 85 COVID-19.
