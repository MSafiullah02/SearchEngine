The Accreditation Counsel for Graduate Medical Education's clinical and educational expectations are such that ''significant changes in resident/fellow education of more than 4 weeks in duration must be reported to the Executive Director of the applicable Review Committee.'' 4 Training disruptions caused by the implementation of telemedicine and altered clinic workflow may affect resident board eligibility and compromise dermatology resident education. Preservation of resident education during this pandemic is essential.",
