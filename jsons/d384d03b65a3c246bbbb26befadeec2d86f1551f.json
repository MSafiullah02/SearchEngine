Several patients displayed no obvious clinical symptoms at diagnosis, and they were found by screening because of close contacts with confirmed patients; and further chest imaging suggested pneumonia. Several gradually presented with fever, fatigue, dry cough, accompanied by other upper respiratory symptoms including nasal congestion, runny nose, and seldom gastrointestinal symptoms such as nausea, vomiting and diarrhea. Laboratory examination in pediatric patients showed that blood routine was often normal, and C-reactive protein was normal or transiently elevated. Lung imaging examination revealed mild increase of lung markings or ground-glass opacity or pneumonia.",

During severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) epidemics, ARDS and death also occur in pediatric cases [2] [3] [4] . The current clinical features are defined only based on the 28 pediatric patients. Clinical features in pediatric patients will be further defined with increased number of confirmed patients.",

IFN is the first-line innate immune defense of the body against viral infection. Based on different gene and protein structures, IFN is divided into IFN-\u03b1, IFN-\u03b2, and so on. Interferon mainly plays antiviral effects through two ways: (1) inducing production of antiviral effector proteins, thereby inhibiting viral replication in the cells to protect normal cells from viral invasion; (2) activating cellular immunity by promoting proliferation and activation of cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL), activating natural killer (NK) cells and macrophages to clear the virus. The body's endogenous IFN deficiency or insufficiency may lead to reduced antiviral activity. Children are susceptible to viral infections because of their immature immune function and relatively low levels of specific humoral and cellular immunity and IFN secretion.",
