PKR is encoded from a single gene located on human chromosome 2p21\u201022, and contains a C\u2010terminal kinase domain (KD) shared by three other mammalian kinases: the PKR\u2010like endoplasmic reticulum\u2010resident protein kinase (PERK or PEK), the heme\u2010regulated inhibitor kinase (HRI) and the homologue of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae general control non\u2010derepressible\u20102 (GCN2) kinase, all of which phosphorylate the \u03b1\u2010subunit of the eukaryotic initiation factor 2 (eIF2) in response to stress signals (Schneider and Mohr, 2003; Baltzis et al., 2004; Holcik and Sonenberg, 2005; Taylor et al., 2005). The multiprotein complex eIF2 is responsible for recruiting the initiator Met\u2010tRNAMet to the 40S ribosomal subunit in a guanosine triphosphate (GTP)\u2010dependent manner (Clemens, 2004; Gebauer and Hentze, 2004; Holcik and Sonenberg, 2005). Phosphorylation of the eIF2 \u03b1\u2010subunit (eIF2\u03b1) at residue Ser51 functions as a dominant inhibitor of guanine exchange factor eIF2B and prevents the recycling of GTP on eIF2 that is required for ongoing translation, thus leading to general inhibition of protein synthesis (Clemens, 2004; Taylor et al., 2005).",

In uninfected non\u2010stressed cells, PKR is found in a monomeric latent state due to the auto\u2010inhibitory effect of its dsRBDs, which normally occlude the KD (Garc\u00eda et al., 2006). Upon binding to dsRNA produced as a virus replication intermediate, PKR undergoes homo\u2010dimerization and autophosphorylation on Thr446 and Thr451, leading to substrate docking, eIF2\u03b1 phosphorylation and block of protein synthesis in virally infected cells (Taylor et al., 2005; Dabo and Meurs, 2012). dsRNA\u2010induced PKR\u2010mediated eIF2\u03b1 phosphorylation represents a primary antiviral response in mammalian cells (Schneider and Mohr, 2003; Garc\u00eda et al., 2006); in fact production of dsRNA is an obligate part of the genomic replication cycle for RNA viruses as RNA serves as a template for both viral transcription and replication, and dsRNA is often produced by opposing transcription units also during DNA virus replication (Schneider and Mohr, 2003).",

Following viral penetration and uncoating, VSV primary mRNAs are synthesized in the host cell cytoplasm by the virus\u2010associated RNA\u2010dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp). When viral proteins begin to accumulate, progeny viral genomes are replicated and used for secondary transcription. mRNA from both primary and secondary transcription are similar in structure to host messengers, containing a cap at the 5\u2032\u2010end and a 3\u2032\u2010poly(A) tail similar in length to host mRNAs (Connor and Lyles, 2002; Lyles et al., 2013). During VSV replication host translation is rapidly inhibited, an event that is mainly attributed to virus\u2010induced modifications of host eukaryotic initiation factor\u20104F (eIF4F) that enhance translational efficiency of viral mRNA while dampening synthesis of host proteins, including antiviral defence enzymes (Connor and Lyles, 2002; 2005). Previous studies had suggested that the non\u2010steroidal anti\u2010inflammatory drug indomethacin (INDO) inhibits VSV replication, possibly affecting transcription of viral messages (Mukherjee and Simpson, 1987).",

In addition to the anti\u2010inflammatory/analgesic action, indomethacin has been known for several decades to also possess antiviral properties. Since the initial discovery in the 1960s (Inglot, 1969), in vitro and in vivo studies have confirmed the antiviral activity of indomethacin against several human viral pathogens, including herpes virus (Zhu et al., 2002), rotavirus (Rossen et al., 2004), hepatitis B (Bahrami et al., 2005), human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) (Ramirez et al., 1986; Bourinbaiar and Lee\u2010Huang, 1995) and the SARS\u2010CoV coronavirus, agent of the severe acute respiratory syndrome (Amici et al., 2006). The experimental and clinical evidence accumulated suggests a novel therapeutic use of this classical anti\u2010inflammatory drug during viral infection; however, the lack of understanding of the mechanism of antiviral action is a major drawback for INDO treatment of viral diseases. Indomethacin ability to inhibit the replication of several unrelated DNA and RNA viruses points out to a host\u2010mediated antiviral mechanism, rather than an effect on virus\u2010specific enzymes; however, this mechanism remains largely unknown.",

Herein we investigated the molecular mechanism responsible for the antiviral activity of INDO during VSV infection. We demonstrate that INDO acts at the translational level by rapidly inducing the phosphorylation of the \u03b1\u2010subunit of eIF2. Phosphorylation of eIF2\u03b1 occurs at concentrations of INDO in the Cmax range detected in patients treated with medium\u2013high doses of the drug (Benet, 1996). Confirming our previous observation in cancer cells (Brunelli et al., 2012), eIF2\u03b1 phosphorylation was found to be mediated by selective activation of PKR. Interestingly, siPKR silencing dampened the ability of INDO to inhibit VSV protein synthesis, identifying PKR as a key element in the antiviral activity of this drug.",

In addition, pretreatment of MA104 cells with INDO (400 \u03bcM) for a 6 h period only modestly affected VSV replication, if the drug was removed before viral infection (http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/cmi.12446/suppinfo). The effect of indomethacin on VSV protein synthesis and localization was then analysed. In a first set of experiments, mock\u2010infected or VSV\u2010infected (10 PFU per cell) MA104 cells were treated with INDO after the 1 h adsorption period and, at 6 h p.i., viral proteins were visualized by immunofluorescence microscopy using anti\u2010VSV antibodies. As shown in Fig. 2, the expression of high levels of cytoplasmic viral proteins at 6 h p.i. was accompanied by a nearly complete disassembly of tubulin filaments in the cytoplasm of infected cells; viral proteins were instead barely detectable in INDO\u2010treated cells, which were indistinguishable from uninfected controls for size and cytoskeletal arrangement. To investigate the effect of INDO on cellular and viral protein synthesis, mock\u2010infected and VSV\u2010infected cells were treated with INDO after virus adsorption and labelled with [35S]\u2010methionine at 4 h p.i. for the next 4 h. Samples containing equal amounts of proteins or equal amounts of radioactivity were processed for sodium dodecyl sulfate\u2010polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS\u2010PAGE) and autoradiography. As shown in Fig. 3A, INDO treatment strongly inhibited VSV protein expression and prevented the virus\u2010induced shut\u2010off of cellular protein synthesis. Next, the effect of INDO on the kinetics of VSV protein synthesis was analysed. Mock\u2010infected and VSV\u2010infected cells were treated with 400 \u03bcM INDO after virus adsorption and labelled with [35S]\u2010methionine (1 h pulse) at different times p.i. Indomethacin was found to cause a transient (1\u20136 h) inhibition of [35S]\u2010methionine incorporation into proteins in both mock\u2010infected and VSV\u2010infected cells (Fig. 3B). Samples containing the same amount of radioactivity were processed for SDS\u2010PAGE, autoradiography and densitometric analysis. As shown in Fig. 3C, accumulation of VSV proteins was evident starting at 3 h p.i., whereas shut\u2010off of host cell protein synthesis was observed at later times (4\u20135 h) p.i. In infected cells, INDO treatment was confirmed to strongly inhibit VSV protein expression and to prevent the virus\u2010induced shut\u2010off of cellular protein synthesis up to 6\u20138 h p.i. (Fig. 3C). It should be pointed out that the synthesis of VSV proteins, in particular the N protein, could be detected starting at 6 h p.i. in INDO\u2010treated cells.",

As shown in Fig. 5B, INDO caused a rapid and substantial decrease of heavier polysomes, characteristic of a reduced rate of translation initiation, in both mock\u2010infected and VSV\u2010infected cells at 30 min p.i. As indicated earlier, translational inhibition was transient as demonstrated by protein synthesis recovery at later times after treatment (Fig. 3B).",

We have recently shown that INDO treatment selectively activates PKR in a cyclooxygenase\u2010independent manner in human colon cancer cells (Brunelli et al., 2012). To confirm that PKR is the kinase responsible for INDO\u2010induced eIF2\u03b1 phosphorylation also in MA104 cells, GCN2, PERK, HRI and PKR kinase activities were analysed in MA104 whole\u2010cell lysates by in vitro kinase assay using recombinant eIF2\u03b1 as a substrate after immunoprecipitation with specific antibodies. HRI was not detectable in MA104 cells. INDO did not affect PERK and GCN2 activity, whereas it strongly induced PKR activity (Fig. 7A). Indomethacin\u2010induced PKR activation was also evidenced in MA104 cells by increased PKR auto\u2010phosphorylation (Fig. 7B), starting rapidly after drug administration and attenuating between 4 and 6 h after treatment, concomitantly with attenuation of eIF2\u03b1\u2010phosphorylation (Fig. 6B). As shown in Fig. 7C, treatment with the PKR inhibitor 2\u2010aminopurine resulted in preventing eIF2\u03b1 phosphorylation in INDO\u2010treated cells, confirming that PKR is responsible for INDO\u2010induced eIF2\u03b1 phosphorylation in MA104 cells.

As previously reported in cancer cells (Brunelli et al., 2012), indomethacin\u2010induced eIF2\u03b1 phosphorylation is mediated by PKR as it is prevented by the PKR inhibitor 2\u2010aminopurine; in addition, INDO selectively activates PKR, whereas it does not affect the activity of the eIF2\u03b1 kinases PERK and GCN2 in these cells. In uninfected MA104 cells, PKR\u2010mediated eIF2\u03b1\u2010phosphorylation resulted in a transient inhibition of protein synthesis; on the other hand, in VSV\u2010infected cells, eIF2\u03b1 phosphorylation at early times during infection resulted in shutting off viral protein translation, causing a dramatic inhibition of viral replication and infectious viral particle production. Treatment with 2\u2010aminopurine and PKR silencing both resulted in the attenuation of INDO antiviral activity in VSV\u2010infected cells. These results are consistent with previous reports showing that PKR plays an essential role against VSV infection in vitro and in vivo (Stojdl et al., 2000; Durbin et al., 2002), and that inactivation of the eIF2 complex early after infection blocks VSV protein synthesis (Connor and Lyles, 2005). On the other hand, Krishnamoorthy et al. (2008) reported that no significant difference in VSV replication was detected in MEFs containing the serine 51 to alanine mutation of eIF2\u03b1 as compared with wild\u2010type cells, indicating that eIF2\u03b1 phosphorylation does not affect VSV replication under normal, non\u2010stimulated conditions. Nevertheless, the KD of eIF2\u03b1 kinases was shown to be both necessary and sufficient to inhibit VSV protein expression and virus replication in human fibrosarcoma HT1080 cells (Krishnamoorthy et al., 2008). It should be pointed out that, as previously reported (Connor and Lyles, 2005), the kinetics of eIF2\u03b1 phosphorylation may be important for the control of VSV replication, suggesting that inhibition of VSV protein synthesis is achieved if the eIF2 complex is inactivated early after infection. In fact, in our model, pretreatment of host cells with 400 \u03bcM INDO for a 6 h period before viral infection, a time at which eIF2\u03b1 phosphorylation is restored to the basal level, only modestly affected VSV replication as compared to treatment with the drug started after the 1 h adsorption period.",

In particular, INDO treatment prevented the virus\u2010induced massive disassembly of the host microtubular network. This effect was not associated with the previously described ability of INDO to promote a cytoprotective heat shock response by enhancing HSF1 activity and HSP expression under stress conditions (Amici et al., 1995; Cotto et al., 1996).

Despite an extensive amount of studies, the mechanism for this wide spectrum activity has remained elusive for several decades. It should be pointed out that indomethacin antiviral activity was previously attributed to cyclooxygenase inhibition and prostaglandin\u2010E production during herpes virus (Zhu et al., 2002; Schr\u00f6er and Shenk, 2008) and rotavirus (Rossen et al., 2004) infection. In addition, the antiviral activity of non\u2010selective as well as selective COX\u20101 and COX\u20102 inhibitors has been reported also in vivo against several viruses, including VSV (Chen et al., 2000; 2002; Symensma et al., 2003). In our experimental model, however, INDO activity was not mimicked by the NSAID aspirin and sodium salicylate, nor by the selective COX\u20101 inhibitor SC\u2010560 and COX\u20102 inhibitor NS\u2010398 up to concentrations near the cytotoxic range, suggesting a cyclooxygenase\u2010independent mechanism. The results described herein demonstrate that indomethacin, instead, triggers a cellular antiviral defence mechanism by rapidly and effectively activating PKR in an interferon\u2010 and dsRNA\u2010independent manner. INDO\u2010triggered PKR signalling effectively blocks viral replication by preventing viral protein translation. The fact that high levels of phosphorylated eIF2\u03b1 were associated with INDO antiviral activity also during infection with the parainfluenza Sendai virus and the SA\u201011 rotavirus (Santoro et al., unpublished results) suggests that activation of the PKR/eIF2\u03b1 signalling cascade may be implicated in the antiviral effect of INDO against other types of RNA viruses.",

However, the fact that PKR silencing only partially restored virus replication in INDO\u2010treated cells indicates that other mechanisms may contribute to the antiviral activity of the drug. Moreover, because in addition to its role in translation, PKR participates in several signalling pathways controlling transcription (Santoro et al., 2003; Donz\u00e9 et al., 2004; Garc\u00eda et al., 2006; Dabo and Meurs, 2012), it cannot be excluded that other PKR\u2010mediated mechanisms may be involved in the control of VSV replication after INDO treatment.",

We have previously shown that INDO\u2010mediated PKR induction is COX independent, and that, intriguingly, indomethacin is able to stimulate PKR activity in the absence of the natural dsRNA inducer, and does not require the presence of interferon (Brunelli et al., 2012). This has now been confirmed in a different model. In addition, it was previously shown that indomethacin was able to induce PKR activity in vitro at levels comparable with the PKR inducer poly(I):poly(C), suggesting a direct effect of the drug in the kinase activation (Brunelli et al., 2012).",

Plotted values indicate fold increase of the p\u2010eIF2\u03b1/eIF2\u03b1 ratio in INDO\u2010treated cells versus control (lower panels). Values represent the mean \u00b1 SD from two experiments. *P < 0.05 versus untreated control. B. Kinetics of PKR phosphorylation was analysed by Western blot using antiphospho\u2010PKR (p\u2010PKR) or anti\u2010PKR (PKR) antibodies in lysates from MA104 cells treated with 400 \u03bcM INDO; \u03b2\u2010actin levels are shown as loading control. C. Immunoblot using antiphosphoSer\u201051\u2010eIF2\u03b1 (p\u2010eIF2\u03b1) or eIF2\u03b1 panspecific antibodies performed on lysates from MA104 cells treated for 30 min with INDO and/or different concentrations of 2\u2010aminopurine (2AP) (upper panel). Graph shows the p\u2010eIF2\u03b1/eIF2\u03b1 ratio for each sample (lower panel). Values represent the mean \u00b1 SD from three independent experiments. *P < 0.05 versus untreated control. **P < 0.05 versus INDO\u2010treated control. D. VSV\u2010infected MA104 cells were treated with 400 \u03bcM INDO after the 1 h adsorption period in the presence or absence of 2 mM 2AP. Virus yield (TCID\n50% ml\u22121) was determined at 8 h p.i. Data represent the mean \u00b1 SD of duplicate samples from a representative experiment of two with similar results. *P < 0.01. E. HeLa cells transiently transfected with PKR\u2010siRNA (siPRK) or non\u2010specific siRNA (NSR) were infected with VSV and treated with 25 \u03bcM INDO or diluent control after the 1 h adsorption period. VSV\u2010G protein levels at 8 h p.i. were detected by Western blot using polyclonal anti\u2010VSV\u2010G antibodies (1:2000 dilution); endogenous PKR and p38 MAPK levels were detected on the same filter by immunoblot (top panels); \u03b1\u2010tubulin levels are shown as loading control. Plotted values indicate the levels of G protein expressed as percent of levels in untreated mock\u2010transfected control (bottom panel). Values represent the mean \u00b1 SD from two independent experiments. *P < 0.05 versus INDO\u2010treated mock\u2010transfected cells. F. HeLa cells transfected with PKR\u2010siRNA (dashed bars) or non\u2010specific siRNA (empty bars) were infected with VSV and treated with different concentrations of INDO after the 1 h adsorption period. Virus yields were determined by TCID\n50 infectivity assay at 8 h p.i. Data represent the mean \u00b1 SD of duplicate samples from a representative experiment of two with similar results. *P < 0.05.",
