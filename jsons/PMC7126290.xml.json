Indeed, for every US$ 1 spent on vaccination against diseases associated with 10 antigens in low-income and middle-income countries (LMICs), the estimated return on investment for society is US$16 due to direct savings on healthcare and increased productivity, and nearly three times higher (US$44) when broader economic and social benefits are considered [1\u2022\u2022]. From 2001 to 2020, the broader benefits could amount to a staggering US$ 820 billion in the 73 countries supported by the Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunization (GAVI) [2], a public\u2013private partnership (PPP) involving amongst others the UN, the vaccine industry and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation (BMGF). Due to the higher disease burden and more limited medical infrastructure, the HE gain from introducing a vaccine in LMICs will be greater than in higher-income countries (HICs), where the gain will largely be determined by competition between the different health options on offer [3].",

The latter is illustrated by GAVI's aim to reach an additional 300 million children for routine childhood vaccination by 2020. Also, the pressure is mounting to deliver improved or new vaccines against challenging infectious diseases (e.g. tuberculosis, HIV/AIDS), new zoonotic pathogens, and therapeutic vaccines against non-communicable chronic diseases such as cancer and neurodegenerative diseases. They are also needed to address the scourge of antibiotic-resistant bacteria [4] and the varying vaccine needs across a person's life-span (vaccine \u2018life-cycle management to support life-course immunization\u2019 [5]).",

Traditionally, the multiphase vaccine development process, which typically progresses over a 10\u201315-year period from vaccine discovery to advanced clinical development in Phase 3 efficacy trials, can require investments of US$ 0.5\u20131 billion [6, 7, 8]. This, combined with the slim (<10%) probability of candidates to enter the market, has negatively impacted the number of investing vaccine manufacturers and has contributed to the current productivity gap in vaccine development. The selection criteria supporting prioritization of a vaccine project must therefore be increasingly stringent. Here we discuss the key considerations in this decision-making process from a vaccine manufacturer's perspective.",

Yet, given their low technical feasibility and the lack of knowledge surrounding what constitutes a protective response, their development has been deprioritized by major manufacturers, but is prioritized by several biotech companies, which can afford to take higher risks. The groundwork laid by international PPPs such as the Human Vaccines Project, or the European Innovative Medicines Initiative (IMI) consortium \u2018BIOVACSAFE\u2019, which aim to provide insight in the human immunity required for a successful vaccine, may break the technical impasse at least in some areas.",

For the majority of these diseases, incomplete knowledge of the immunopathogenesis and mechanisms of natural or acquired immunity amount to a weak business case for vaccine development [8], and all important vaccines targeting these diseases have been developed in collaborative frameworks. Prequalification by supranational organizations, such as for the four-dose vial presentation of a pneumococcal vaccine recently awarded by the WHO, makes the vaccines eligible for procurement by UN agencies, and provides an early return on investments. Tiered pricing can also support the development of new vaccines using the profits made from the higher prices in HIC markets, an approach followed for many childhood vaccines [15, 16].",

Supported by vaccine donations from industry and MVI, the vaccine will enter a pilot implementation in Sub-Saharan Africa in 2018, which will be coordinated by the WHO and funded by multiple supranational organizations. In theory, post-marketing access to this vaccine is enhanced by setting prices affordable for LMICs, which are expected to cover manufacturing costs as well as a small return, to be reinvested in R&D for next-generation malaria vaccines or vaccines against other tropical diseases. In practice however, realization of a sustainable post-marketing phase and procurement of RTS,S/AS01 is still challenging due to the absence of a sustainable market for this vaccine. Furthermore, an AERAS-funded collaboration, with academic support for in-depth cellular immunity assessments [17, 18], yielded the tuberculosis candidate vaccine M72/AS01, for which the first results of the Phase 2b efficacy trial are expected in 2018 [NCT01755598]. Collaborative development also brought about the only licensed dengue vaccine (though recent safety concerns have posed a major setback in its roll-outs [19]), as well as several Shigella candidate vaccines, particularly important to combat the high shigellosis burden in infants in LMIC settings. Though no established correlates of protection exist, Shigella vaccine development is facilitated by generally accepted immunological associations with protection. Two promising approaches already evaluated in Phase 2 studies include the bioconjugate S. flexneri 2a vaccine (Flexyn2a) supported by The Wellcome Trust, and a monovalent S. sonnei vaccine (1790GAHB) based on genetically-derived outer membrane vesicles of Shigella, generated using the Generalized Modules for Membrane Antigens (GMMA) technology ([20, 21] and NCT02646371). The latter vaccine is being developed with funding from the European Commission's FP7 program. In addition, several multivalent Shigella vaccines are in early development.",

Such vaccines generally lack market incentives. For the purpose of pandemic preparedness, these pathogens necessitate not only continuous surveillance in humans and animals, but also intensified development of prepandemic vaccines in the inter-outbreak periods. Beyond recent outbreaks of pandemic influenza, Ebola and Zika viruses, the WHO lists 70 diseases with outbreak potential. Yet with the possible exception of pandemic influenza vaccines [8], industry alone cannot deliver the resources needed for the world's vaccine supplies. Therefore, new globally-funded PPPs have been tasked with prepandemic vaccine development, such as CEPI (founded by industry, the Wellcome Trust, BMGF and several national governments), which will initially target three viruses from the WHO priority list (i.e., Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus and Lassa and Nipah viruses). An additional initiative, the proposed BioPreparedness Organization, will focus on development and utilization of vaccine platform technologies, but the sustainable supply, pricing and procurement of these vaccines have not been addressed yet. Platform technologies are critical in overcoming the bottlenecks in manufacturing, as further discussed below.",

Facilitated by innovations in structure-based design, decade-long efforts have resulted in influenza vaccine candidates targeting the extracellular domain of the M2 protein, conserved regions in the HA1 domain, or the conserved HA2 stalk domain, of which particularly the latter approach appears promising for both seasonal and pandemic purposes [31]. Given that upon exposure to new strains, immune responses will be preferably directed to conserved epitopes on the stalk [32, 33], several avenues are being explored. One of them, which takes advantage of the current manufacturing processes, entails repeated vaccination with constructs expressing chimeric HA subunits with the same conserved stalk domain, but different exotic HA heads that are never encountered by humans under natural conditions ([34\u2022, 35] and NCT03275389). When combined with the Adjuvant System 03 (AS03), such regimens were shown in pre-clinical models to induce anti-stalk IgG antibodies, as well as anti-NA antibodies which may also contribute to protection. Another approach includes vaccines based on \u2018headless\u2019 HA immunogens constructed through removal or glycan-masking of the HA head domain, which are still in preclinical phases [32, 33].",

They are used to enhance immunity to the antigen, which is particularly important for populations with reduced immune responses, including for instance those with hyporesponsiveness to vaccines, and/or for populations that are na\u00efve to the pathogen [36, 37]. This ability can also serve to increase the viability of potentially promising vaccine approaches such as recombinant protein vaccines, and to allow antigen dose-sparing, which can streamline production by overcoming limitations in manufacturing capability. For instance, while the use of a higher antigen dose improved the efficacy of seasonal influenza vaccines in the elderly [38], seasonal vaccines containing oil-in-water adjuvants such as MF59 and AS03 have shown to be efficacious in this age-group at the standard dose, at least for certain strains [39, 40].

Cell-culture manufacturing, as used for a licensed MF59-adjuvanted pandemic influenza vaccine, is a generally faster and more controlled process, though some obstacles such as the cell-line scale-up still need to be addressed. Furthermore, the need for new, high-performance vaccine platforms has prompted the development of nucleic acid-based technologies (viral vectors, plasmid DNA, conventional RNA, or self-amplifying RNA [SAM]), which are able to elicit broadly protective and robust cell-mediated and humoral immune responses, since expression of the vaccine antigens occurs in situ. Generally, RNA and SAM vaccines have proven more potent than plasmid DNA vaccines, and their production and purification is cost-effective, relatively versatile and readily transferable between different viral targets [48, 49]. Besides influenza vaccines, RNA and SAM vaccines targeting several other pathogens such as HIV and RSV have been evaluated, and were shown to confer protection in animal models [50, 51]. Some of these vaccines, including those against influenza and rabies, have also been tested in clinical trials, with promising but not yet satisfactory results [52, 53]. The underlying mechanism of action of SAM-induced immunity, particularly with respect to early innate immunity, is not fully known [54, 55] but may be further elucidated in the first clinical evaluation of a SAM vaccine, which could occur in 2019.",

The latter can be relevant in the context of the accelerated development of vaccines for LMICs, amongst others. Since \u2018omics\u2019 technologies are used to monitor the occurrence of common signatures, they allow for smaller-scale clinical trials. Such data could also help in introducing a more adaptive clinical trial design, in which multiple vaccine formulations and regimens and several hypotheses are screened, and of which the most promising arm is then expanded in a Phase 3 efficacy study [66, 67]. Moreover, the application of such technologies to human challenge studies presents a potential powerful method to identify or elucidate correlates and/or immunological pathways associated with protection. This approach has been followed in the context of vaccines against malaria, influenza and RSV [45\u2022\u2022, 46, 68], and is currently being developed for pertussis by the IMI consortium \u2018PERISCOPE\u2019.",

Funnel: Guiding criteria for vaccine project prioritization are, first, the unmet medical need, as supported by health-economical (\u2018HE\u2019) and epidemiological (\u2018Epi\u2019) evaluations; second, technical feasibility, often benefitting from partnerships with academia (\u2018Acad\u2019), and third, the sustainability of its development, which depends on the availability of funding partners for collaborative development, as well as on the competitive landscape (\u2018comp\u2019) and the economic development status of the market for which the vaccine is intended (\u2018Market\u2019). While the development of vaccines with a market that includes high-income countries is often predominantly industry-funded, trials evaluating vaccines for predominantly low-to-middle-income markets, or prepandemic vaccines, are typically co-funded by public\u2013private partnerships including industry, governments and international non-governmental organizations. Bars: Red and blue bars indicate the development stages typically benefitting from involvement/support by academia and international funding organizations, respectively. Academic partners mostly contribute by providing immunological insights in late preclinical and Phase 1/2 clinical phases. Funding partners can provide support throughout the whole process, including the licensing (\u2018Lic\u2019) phase, and the post-licensing phases comprising vaccine manufacturing (\u2018Manu\u2019) and implementation (\u2018Implement\u2019), for example the supply chain management support provided by the public\u2013private partnership (mVacciNation). Post-marketing Phase 4 studies monitoring vaccine usage, adverse effects (pharmacovigilance), and long-term immunity are typically industry-funded. Red arrowed bars indicate the technologies used to guide antigen discovery and/or vaccine design (reverse vaccinology, delivery, adjuvants and platform technologies), while systems biology data, often generated in industry-academic partnerships, can guide during the discovery phase, as well as in later clinical phases, by supporting adaptive trial designs to expedite progression to Phase 3 clinical evaluations. Finally, strategies to manage the sustainable procurement of new vaccines, such as tiered pricing policies, will also majorly drive the vaccine development process.",
