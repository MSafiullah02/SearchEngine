In literature it can be defined as by-product, yet it shall be treated as a waste in the process of wastewater treatment. Sewage sludge may be used as a source of energy (anaerobic digestion, thermal treatment), treated and used on land as a fertilizer and soil conditioner, or may even be used as a source to extract valuable compounds (phosphorous recovery). A significant number of wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) compost dewatered sewage sludge under aerobic conditions with green wastes or other bulking agents or dry it in heat drying facilities up to 95% dry mass for use as fertilizer or fuel.",

United States Environmental Protection Agency (US EPA) defines biosolids as treated sewage sludge that meets the suitable levels of pollutants or pathogen and is used as fertilizer for landscape application (USEPA, 2009). Wastewater sludge as a complex heterogeneous mixture of micro-organisms, undigested organics as cellulose, plant residues, oils, or fecal material, inorganic material, sand is a resource of organic matter, nitrogen, phosphorous, micronutrients and even heavy metals, bio-fuel, hydrogen, syngas, bio-oil, bio-diesel, bio-plastics, bio-pesticides, proteins, enzymes, bio-fertilizers or voilatile-acids (Tyagi and Lo, 2013). Currently the main trends in development of sustainable human communities include the investigation of the best strategies of the recycling of those precious substances (LeBlanc et al., 2009). However, taking into consideration standards set for waste which are reintroduced in natural systems, precautionary aspects shall be considered, especially on the limit values (quality criteria) for potential contaminants and pollutants dangerous to human health and the environment.",

Generally the Directive had the positive effect of improving source control measures in order to ensure a good quality of sludge, though currently it is considered as out-of-date and has been earmarked by the Commission as a candidate for revision for around 10 years (Environment, 2014). According to the report of European Commission published in 2010, only 39% of sewage sludge is recycled into agriculture in the EU due to increasing leaching of contaminants to water and soil, odors and greenhouse gas emissions (CH4 and CO2). Large variations are noted for sludge used on land in the Member States, ranging from none (Nederland, Switzerland) to over 50% (Norway, Great Britain, France). Coalition agreement of the federal government of Germany in November 2013 concluded: \u201cWe will face out the direct use of sewage sludge as a fertilizer on land and promote the recycling of phosphorus and other nutrients\u201d (Bergs, 2015). At the other high-income countries, like USA, Canada, Australia, New Zealand treated biosolids are widely used on soils, however incineration has been suggested as a promising alternative of final sewage sludge disposal. Nevertheless, in less developed countries land application of treated sewage sludge is growing alternative for landfilling.",

Main source of heavy metals in sewage sludge are industrial wastewater and surface runoff. The total content varies within wide limits (from 0.5 to 2% of dry sludge).

Such an assessment can be made by determining the amount of metal ions bound by the individual components (fractions) using sequence analysis. Lasheen and Ammar (2009) showed that Mn, Ni and Zn were most present in the exchangeable, carbonate and Fe/Mn-oxide forms as the most mobile fractions, while Cd, Cu, Cr and Fe were major in the organic and sulfide (exhibiting some degree of mobility), and the residual form (inert phase) which, corresponds to less mobilization. Different methods of stabilization alter both total concentration and the bioavailability of metal ions. The same authors confirmed that the use of cement kiln dust significantly reduced the availability of metals by chemical modification of their chemical speciation into less available forms. D\u0105browska and Rosi\u0144ska (2012) did not observe accumulation of mobile fractions (exchangeable and carbonate) as an effect of thermophilic digestion of sewage sludge except for nickel. The highest increase of Zn, Cu, Cd and Cr concentration was observed in the form of organic-sulfide fraction, whereas in the case of Pb, the residual fraction noted the highest increase. For Ni both organic-sulfide and exchangeable\u2013carbonate fractions were enriched. Smith (2009) in his critical review demonstrated the reduced bioavailability and crop uptake of metals from composted biosolids comparing to other types of sewage sludge. Furthermore, the use the earthworms affected metal speciation in vermicomposted sludge (Y. Zhang et al., 2008). In turn, Xiao et al. (2015) noted that after combustion process of pelletized municipal sewage sludge (MSS), the bioavailable heavy metal fractions (acid soluble/exchangeable, reducible and oxidizable fractions) were mostly transformed into the very stable heavy metal fractions (residual fractions). Healy et al. (2016) analysed metal concentrations in sewage sludge (SS) treated by thermal drying, lime stabilization, or anaerobic digestion found that Se and Sn, potentially harmful to human health, are present in SS in large concentration - much higher than their baseline amounts in soils. These metals are omitted in the regulations, just like several others, even those considered astoxic. Interesting results are shown for silver. A study financed by the US EPA (USEPA, 2009) in sludge from 74 wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) across the USA indicates the presence of significant concentration of silver (up to 856 mg Ag/kg DM) or even titanium (to 4510 mgTi/kg DM). The Swedish Environmental Protection Agency (SEPA) has recommended a silver value of 8 mg/kg in sewage sludge destined for agricultural applications. Shamuyarira and Gumbo (2014) analysed the sewage sludge of five towns in Limpopo province of South Africa and found the silver concentration in the range of 0.22\u201321.93 mg/kg DM.",

In the last years, findings from studies in Germany showed that there had been a decline of PCDD/F PCB and AOX concentration (Table 5\n), while only 3% decrease was noted for AOX. The main sources of these substances are solvents, solvent mixtures, oil and grease, resins, rubber, hydraulic oils, lubricants, plasticizers, disinfectants, wood protectives and some pesticides. According to investigations of Olofsson et al.

The microbial toxicity of silver is known for centuries. The researchers from Germany found that the predicted no-effect concentration (PNEC) (the highest concentration below which no harmful effects are expected to occur) of silver nanoparticles in soil was 0.05 mg/kg DM soil (Schlich et al., 2013). This concentrations would be equivalent for actual applications of sewage sludge in Germany, where maximum amount equal of 30 mg/kg DM of sludge for each application, based on the average application of 5 tons per hectare every three years (Schlich et al., 2013). Simultaneously, the predicted environmental concentration (PEC) of silver nanoparticles in soil treated with sewage sludge was calculated at the level 0.0015 mg/kg DM soil (Europe). With an estimated annual increase of 0.001 mg/kg DM soil, the researchers suggest the PNEC of silver nanoparticles could be exceeded in 50 years. The investigations of Kim et al. (2012) shown that TiO2 nanoparticles from biosolids can interact with toxic trace metals (as Ag) and enter of soil environment. Johnson et al.

It is known that this material could substitute up to 60% lack of mineral phosphorus obtained from sewage sludge ash afters incineration (Guedes et al., 2014) or dried processes (Kahiluoto et al., 2015). However, development of technology and analytic techniques contribute to \u201cdiscovery\u201d of new sludge contaminants, which negatively affect environmental balance. Threats arising from excessive amounts of heavy metals are slowly replaced by specific form of selected trace elements \u2013 nanoparticles. The industry as a well known main source of contaminants is increasingly replaced by households, as in the case of pharmaceuticals (PhCs) and personal care products (PCPs). The concentrations of so called emerging contaminants (ECs) in sewage sludge are noted between few \u03bcg kg\u22121 (estrogens, some pharmaceuticals, PFCs) to g kg\u22121 (LAS). The excessive content of antibiotics are closely connected with appearance of antibiotic resistance such as multi-resistant E. coli strains or strong pathogenic strain, such as EHEC pathogen O104:H4. All of these threats should lead to stronger limits considering the direct use of sewage sludge as a fertilizer on land. Sewage sludge processes (anaerobic digestion, composting, even thermal carbonization) are not guarantee to obtain the product of high quality without contaminants. Hence, these insights should to be investigated in future studies.",
