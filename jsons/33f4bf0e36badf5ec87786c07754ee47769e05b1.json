To this end, we propose a control scheme that aims to develop herd immunity while satisfying the following two basic requirements for a viable policy option. The first requirement is social acceptability: the overall deaths should be minimized for social acceptance. The second is feasibility: the healthcare system should not be overwhelmed to avoid diverse adverse effects. Exploiting the fact that the severity of the disease increases considerably with age, the proposed control scheme protects high-risk individuals that mainly consist of the elderly. The protection of high-risk individuals reduces the average severity of the disease in the unprotected population, thereby substantially reducing mortality and avoiding the collapse of the healthcare system. Social acceptability (in terms of the resulting mortality) and feasibility (in terms of the healthcare system capacity) of the proposed herd immunity strategy are summarized into two respective, easily computable conditions by building on a simple susceptible-infected-recovered (SIR) model. For its parsimony, the proposed framework can provide a rule of thumb that applies to various populations for studying the viability of herd immunity strategies against COVID-19. For Japan, herd immunity may be developed by the considered control scheme if R 0 \u2264 2.0 and the severity rates of the disease are 1/10 times smaller than the previously reported value, although as high mortality as seasonal influenza is expected.",

            "text": "The pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID -19) has been a huge global health threat, with over 4.5 million cases and 300,000 deaths confirmed worldwide as of the 17th May 2020 [1] . It has been observed from experience from China, Italy, and the United States that COVID-19 can overwhelm the healthcare capacities. Due to the absence of an effective antiviral drug or a vaccine, many countries have adopted non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs), such as closing schools and workplaces and imposing rigorous social distancing measures to reduce transmission of the virus. Initial efforts by governments worldwide have been concentrated on the short-run suppression of the first wave of the pandemic to avoid the collapse of the healthcare system. Suppression of an outbreak can, however, leave a large portion of the population uninfected and susceptible; therefore, the possibility exists for a resurgence of outbreaks as severe as the initial one [2, 3, 4] . Moreover, radical NPIs aimed at suppression are not sustainable, as they have already had devastating impacts on the global economy and personal lives of many. Long-run strategies that go beyond simple relaxation of the initial suppression-oriented responses are crucial, as we probably are at least one or two years away from the substantial supply of a vaccine. The continued circulation of the virus in the global population for a prolonged period seems to be inevitable. Then, a possible option might be developing herd immunity by ensuring a sufficiently high proportion of immune individuals in the population, which may be achieved through a carefully managed slow spread of infection that avoid the collapse of the healthcare system [5] .",

            "text": "Social acceptance is a significant issue for any form of herd immunity policies because they are associated with considerable numbers of infections and hence mortality. For an infectious disease with a basic reproduction number R 0 > 1, herd immunity requires that a proportion 1 \u2212 R \u22121 0 of the whole population must be infected at least. For COVID-19, the basic reproduction number had been reported to be around 2.5 [6, 7, 8] , whereas the infection fatality ratio (IFR) around 0.6 to 0.7% [9, 10, 11] . A crude estimate by these numbers is that the resulting mortality along the way toward herd immunity can reach 400 per 100, 000, or about 500, 000 deaths for Japan and 1.3 million deaths for the United States. These numbers would not be socially acceptable. The basic premise of our research is that the true IFR for COVID-19 is lower than the reported value since no herd immunity approaches can obtain social acceptance otherwise. than those with < 20 according to previous estimates [9, 11] . By exploiting this fact, the proposed control scheme consists of two components. The first component is a protection measure for high-risk individuals (i.e., the elderly and those with underlying health conditions) to reduce mortality. The second component is a dynamic control measure (time-dependent reductions of social activities) for the unprotected to avoid the collapse of the healthcare system. The protection of high-risk individuals reduces the average severity ratio of the disease for the unprotected population and has twofold implications. First, it contributes to social acceptance because it can substantially reduce mortality. Second, it contributes to feasibility because severe cases remain below the healthcare system's capacity even when infections spread in the unprotected, low-risk population. With these effects, the number of infected individuals can increase without causing a collapse of the healthcare system. Our analyses reveal that, if several conditions are met with the basic reproduction number of the epidemic, R 0 , and several other characteristic parameters of the system, the whole population can acquire herd immunity without the collapse of the healthcare system, while substantially reducing mortality.",

At the cost of the simplification, we can study the feasibility and social acceptability of herd immunity strategies semi-analytically with a limited number of input variables. The only required inputs are the age composition of the population, the healthcare system's service capacity, and the age-specific severity rates for COVID-19 while we acknowledge that uncertainties remain for the last one. For its simplicity, the proposed framework is universally applicable to different populations without resorting to data-intensive and model-specific structural simulations and calibrations. For Japan, as an example, herd immunity can be developed if R 0 \u2264 2.0 and the severity rates of the disease (including the IFR) is 1/10 times smaller than the previously reported value [9] . Such numerical results obtained by the proposed framework can be easily updated by incorporating the latest estimates for the input parameters.

By the protection measure, the proposed control scheme aims at (i) minimizing the resulting mortality along the way toward herd immunity and (ii) preventing the collapse of the healthcare system by reducing the proportion of severe cases during the outbreak. The thought experiment with Japanese parameters suggests that the proposed strategy can be an acceptable and feasible option if the \"true\" severity of the disease (i.e., the IHR \u03b8 and the IFR \u03c6) is lower than the reported value by [9] . In concrete terms, if the severity of the disease is 1/10 times lower than the reported estimate, the proposed control scheme can become a viable policy option when R 0 < 2.0.",

For instance, even if the final number of infected individuals is the same, the resulting mortality is reduced considerably by imposing a protection measure (Table 2) . Likewise, without increasing the baseline service capacity (hospital beds), the effective capacity of the healthcare system I max increases significantly by a protection measure (Table 3) . These results stem from the fact that the severity of COVID-19 increases disproportionately with age. For this reason, it is expected that relatively young populations may be able to acquire herd immunity without causing too many deaths per capita, as argued in [20] . Also, it is observed that, whether we aim at herd immunity or not, some protection measures for high-risk individuals can substantially relax healthcare capacity constraints.",

Results become similar when we consider an effective capacity based on the ICU service capacity instead of hospitalization. The proportion of individuals who need critical care, which we denote by \u03b8 , is reported to be around 10\u223c20% among those hospitalized [6, 11] . As a conservative assumption, we let \u03b8 = 0.2 \u00d7 \u03b8 where \u03b8 is the IHR. The total ICU and high care unit (HCU) beds count for Japan is around 1.7 \u00d7 10 4 , or \u00b5 \u2261 1.3 \u00d7 10 \u22124 per capita [27] . These numbers imply I max \u2261 \u00b5 /\u03b8 = 1.3 \u00d7 10 \u22124 /(0.2 \u00d7 n\u03b8) = 6.5 \u00d7 10 \u22124 /(n\u03b8), which is more than twice greater than I max = 2.5 \u00d7 10 \u22124 /(n\u03b8) in (4.1). However, the actual effective capacity for critical care would be somewhere close to (4.1) as we acknowledge that (i) the above I max is an overestimation because the free ICU beds per capita must be much smaller than \u00b5 and that, on the other hand, (ii) assuming the free ICU beds in the normal setting would be an underestimation because some special reinforcement measures for COVID-19 must be in place. Because the actual situations regarding the free ICU capacity for COVID-19 are unknown, the main text uses the hospitalization capacity in the numerical illustration in Section 4.",
