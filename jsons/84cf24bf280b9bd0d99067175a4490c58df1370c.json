Our analysis identified potential linear B cell epitopes in all proteins except for the E protein 308 ( Table 2 ). The greatest number of epitopes were predicted in the surface-exposed S protein (n=26), but a 309 significant number of epitopes were also predicted for the N protein (n=14). This is not surprising, as 310 previous reports identified the N protein as a significant target of the humoral response to SARS-CoV 311 (63, 64). As the S protein is the predominant surface protein and has been the primary target of 312 neutralizing antibody responses against other coronaviruses (56, 57), we elected to focus our subsequent 313 analyses solely on antigenic regions in the S protein. We identified 14 potential structural epitopes in the 314 S protein structure and referenced against our linear epitope predictions to identify six regions that were 315 independently identified by both analyses (Table 2, Figure 4) To further evaluate the potential of these six antigenic regions as targets for antibody binding, we 319 modeled their surface accessibility on the crystal structure of the SARS-Cov-2 spike protein (52).

The S1 domain contains the 322 residues (N331-V524) important for virus binding to angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) on the cell surface (65), and studies have shown that antibodies with potent neutralizing activity against SARS-CoV 324 target this domain (66-68). Indeed, three of the four S1 epitopes identified in our analyses are located in 325 the ACE2-binding region, supporting their potential utility in vaccine development against SARS-CoV-2. 326",
