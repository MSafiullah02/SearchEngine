            "text": "The predictability of preclinical models is a crucial aspect in cancer drug development, a feature that is important not only for chemical compounds and other small molecules but also for biologics, such as virotherapeutics. Due to an inappropriate early selection of potential drug candidates (both molecular and biological), many clinical trials have led to disappointing results and thereby unnecessary costs, despite promising preclinical data. 1 More reliable in vitro tumor models are required to discover more successful drug candidates, and importantly to reject ineffective drugs long before the onset of first human trials. Currently, traditional in vitro testing with two-dimensional cell cultures has limited predictability; therefore, animal trials remain the gold standard. When looking critically at all available preclinical tumor models, there still is a poor correlation with drug effectiveness found finally in clinical human trials, even when animal models are employed extensively. 2 Moreover, animal models, in particular rodent models, are sometimes completely incompatible with oncolytic virotherapy research.",

As a matter of fact, oncolytic viruses (OVs), with their complex mechanisms of action, need realistic preclinical models that assure representation of such important features as tumor microenvironment profiles. One possible solution to this challenge is based on the employment of threedimensional cell cultures, which constitute a more valid in vitro tumor model than traditional two-dimensional monolayer cell cultures. Here, we review the most common threedimensional tumor cell-culture techniques currently used in virotherapy research. Published work in the field of oncolytic virotherapy employing tumor cell spheroids, hydrogel cultures, cultures derived from tissue specimens, organotypic raft cultures, and organoids is included and discussed in this review. In addition, we present application examples for three-dimensional cell cultures in oncolytic virotherapy. The tumor-organoid-culture model can be employed for individual patient virograms. Further, we focus on the development of novel OVs in three-dimensional cultures and the utility of three-dimensional tumor cell cultures to study viral agents targeting the extracellular matrix (ECM).",

Spheroids can mimic, especially, the physical tumor microenvironment more realistically than any other three-dimensional tumor model. With high oxygen and nutrition supply at the rim, the outer cells tend to proliferate. Because of low oxygen levels and accumulation of metabolic end products, the tumor cells in the core of the spheroid are quiescent or even necrotic in larger spheroids (up to 1 mm in diameter). Drug concentration and pH are lowered in the inner areas of the spheroid. With these zones containing cells in different metabolic states, avascular tumors can be realistically imitated ( Figure 1A ). Drug or viral penetration into the spheroid can be evaluated as well. For instance, Grill et al showed that nonreplicative adenoviruses infected only the outer two or three tumor cell layers, whereas replication-competent agents were able to spread through almost the whole spheroid. 4 Spheroid models indicate that viral spread through all tumor areas is difficult to reach by administration on the rim of the spheroid. Therefore, among other things, OVs are often delivered by intratumoral injection in clinical virotherapy. To mimic these conditions, intraspheroidal injections could constitute a preclinical model. In this situation, OVs are challenged to replicate and spread in tumor cells exhibiting low metabolism and low proliferation.",

To enhance viral distribution and tumor cell killing, irradiation has been successfully combined with an oncolytic adenovirus in glioblastoma spheroids. 14 Correa et al found lower myxomavirus-mediated cell killing in spheroids than in adherent cells, because of downregulated Akt kinase in nonadherent cells. 15 When tumor cell spheroids are reattached to the surface, Akt is upregulated again and myxoma virus effectively kills spheroid tumor cells. Later, the same group showed a similar mechanism of tumor cell resistance in spheroids for Maraba virus and its entry molecule: the LDL (low-density lipoprotein) receptor. Reattachment of the tumor cell spheroids relieved this resistance, which can serve as a model for metastasis in this context (Table 1) . 16 Therefore, altered activation of cellular pathways in three-dimensional tumor cell cultures can influence viral tumor cell entry and tumor cell killing. Different entry mechanisms between two-and three-dimensional tumor cell cultures have also been studied in glioblastoma cells for reovirus. 17",

            "text": "Matrigel-derived three-dimensional tumor cell cultures were first investigated in drug testing, and constitute a relatively new approach in oncolytic virotherapy. Because of the large scale of viral agents compared to molecular drugs, Matrigel has a great influence on viral distribution and spread. Viral binding to different ECM proteins also contributes to inhibition of viral spread. 49 Valyi-Nagy et al studied Matrigel cell cultures extensively using uveal melanoma cell lines. 50 Later, the same group extended the experiments with breast, prostate, and embryonic cancer cells. 51 In this work, they found differences in growth patterns among the varying cells in three-dimensional cell cultures and obvious differences in common two-dimensional cell cultures. With herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV1), their results indicated massive inhibition of viral penetration through Matrigel. Furthermore, they infected cells in a monolayer tumor cell culture and embedded them in the Matrigel matrix after infection. Comparing this model with a two-dimensional cell culture, they demonstrated ECM-mediated inhibition of viral replication after viral entry. This \"quiescent\" infection was relieved by the outgrowth of single cells from cell aggregates in a three-dimensional culture. Then, single \"outgrown\" tumor cells started again to express virus-encoded GFP as a marker for viral replication. In summary, at least two mechanisms of resistance in Matrigel cell cultures were found: on one hand, the physical Matrigel barrier working quite efficiently against viral distribution and spread, and on the other, the ECM-mediated suppression of viral replication (Table 3) . 50, 51 Collagen gels in oncolytic virotherapy A collagen gel model has been used to study stroma-selective targeting via human or murine urokinase receptors in a coculture of murine fibroblasts with human breast cancer cells, which led to a significant increase in tumor cell growth. Selective infection of the murine fibroblasts with an oncolytic measles vaccine virus decreased tumor cell proliferation in this coculture model. Supported by a mouse model, the authors concluded that stroma-selective targeting per se constituted an efficient treatment option, even though 9 Interestingly, the reduction in cell viability in this model was larger than in a monolayer coculture of the same cells. Perhaps susceptibility to the adenovirus was increased in the three-dimensional model because there was no hydrogel matrix between the cells, as they were grown in PEG diacrylate hydrogel microwells.",

Despite these benefits, this approach has become less popular within the last few years. One problem is modest reproducibility, as every tumor-tissue slice has individual composition, cell count, and viability. This can also be influenced by the surgical resection procedure or pretreatment of the tumor. Therefore, comparisons and quantifications are quite difficult in this model. Besides this, organotypic slices cannot be shared or passaged and can only be cultured for a short period, resulting in a low number of samples being available ( Table 2 ).

In this context, the organotypic slice model has been used several times to assess the safety profile and specificity of viral agents (Table 4 ).

This can be achieved by two basic techniques: stem cells are maintained in serum-free media supplemented with several tissue-specific growth and niche factors, and stem cells are embedded in a three-dimensional matrix, in general Matrigel ( Figure 2B ). When choosing the right medium supplements, organoid formation will be successful. As many tissue types contain adult stem cells, organoid cultures can be established from primary tissue specimens that are enzymatically digested and mechanically crushed into single cells. This new method was introduced by Sato et al in 2009. 79 They cultured murine intestinal crypts from isolated intestinal stem cells or crypts in an organoid culture with Matrigel. Since then, organoids have been built from many healthy murine and human tissue types. Today, there is widespread success, especially with murine organoids, as they grow more quickly and are easier to maintain. Since protocols and recipes for growth media in human-organoid cultures are relatively new, they might require further optimization.",

Moreover, current approaches use organoid cocultures with fibroblasts to mimic stromal components of the tumor microenvironment. 87 Immune cells can also be integrated in the organoid-culture model by maintaining them in surrounding Matrigel medium. Matrigel infiltration of T lymphocytes has been observed recently. 88 Disadvantages are high costs of culture materials and the lack of tumor endothelium. Moreover, the growth-and niche-factor-supplemented medium might influence tumor behavior. As in hydrogel cultures, large viral agents might be influenced in their spreading capabilities by Matrigel in its solid constitution. To overcome this limitation, organoids can be cultured in Matrigel suspensions or even without a hydrogel matrix ( Table 2 ).",

Unlike other Flaviviridae, Zika virus replicates selectively in cancer stemlike cells and does not infect differentiated glioblastoma cells. Therefore, the authors measured organoid areas and made immunofluorescent stains of proliferation, stem cell, and apoptosis markers. They also used organotypic slices to assess the safety of Zika virus as an oncolytic agent. In summary, the authors concluded that Zika virus held effective oncolytic potential against glioblastoma, but further studies and genetic engineering have to be done to achieve safe and efficient antitumoral treatment in the future.",

In accordance with this, Kuhn et al established a \"directed evolution\" method in a three-dimensional Matrigel culture of ovarian cancer cells. 53 In a first step, several serotypes of adenoviruses were mixed and mutagenesis induced chemically. Afterward, this viral pool was used to infect ovarian cancer cells with high multiplicities of infection to allow recombination among the different viral serotypes. Then, tumor cell cultures were infected with low multiplicities of infection and the viral pool obtained from this supernatant used for a next/subsequent infection cycle. Several passages of the viral pool led to the selection of the most potent and effective viral isolates. Kuhn et al employed two-and three-dimensional cultures of ovarian cancer cells for this approach and compared the resultant viral isolates. In vitro, the viral isolate from the two-dimensional cell culture was as efficient as the virus derived from the three-dimensional culture. However, in a mouse model of intraperitoneal carcinomatosis of ovarian cancer, the virus developed in three-dimensional cell culture was found to be more effective than an OV derived from two-dimensional cell culture. Moreover, this virus showed greater tumor selectivity, due to its attenuation in normal human cells. The authors concluded that Matrigel cultures might be superior for bioselection of OVs, as they are much closer to in vivo tumor biology than any other cultures.",

Their more realistic depiction of the in vivo tumor environment helps us to understand and improve therapy options for cancer patients, such as oncolytic virotherapy. This is particularly important for OVs, because their oncolytic efficiency depends on cell metabolism, activity of signaling pathways, expression of entry receptors, and their spreading capabilities being strongly influenced by the ECM, tumor stroma, and the immune system. To investigate this complex mechanism of action, more complex in vitro tumor models are required. In this regard, each model has favorable aspects. Tumor cell spheroids are able to mimic tumor cells in different metabolic states and provide realistic chemical gradients. To study the interaction of OVs with the ECM, hydrogel culture systems seem to be the best solution. Organotypic tissue cultures derived from primary tumor tissue maintain the histological cell architecture of the tumor, and can be employed as safety assays for OVs as well. For epithelial cancers, organotypic raft cultures can constitute a suitable in vitro model. Tumor-organoid cultures are easiest to handle, and can mimic stem-cell properties and virus-ECM interactions. Of course, further investigations have to be done to establish three-dimensional cell cultures as a common alternative to more traditional assays. However, such research efforts are expected to be fruitful and most probably will open up new opportunities in the field of oncolytic virotherapy.",

(B) Organoid culture, stem cells provided with stem cell, and niche factors form organoids in a three-dimensional matrix (in general hydrogel). A section through a spherical organoid (up to 500 \u00b5m in diameter) is enlarged so that single cells become visible. Stem-like cells are shown in red and differentiated cells in yellow.
