In the UK, vaccination is routinely carried out for feline panleucopenia, feline viral rhinotracheitis (FVR), and feline calicivirus infection, and in quarantine, cats are also vaccinated against rabies. In the USA and some other countries, vaccination is also carried out against feline leukaemia virus infection, feline Chlamydia psittaci infection and routinely against rabies. Attempts are also being made to develop vaccines for feline infectious peritonitis (FIP), although there are a number of problems associated with the development of a successful FIP vaccine which will be referred to later. Factors important in prevention and control of the three diseases feline panleucopenia, FVR, and feline calicivirus infection for which vaccination in the UK is commonly practised will be discussed. For each disease, some background information on the virus and the epizootiology of the disease is given, which it is hoped will lead to greater understanding of the principles involved in prevention and control. A few points will then be made about vaccination in some of those diseases where vaccines are being developed or where it is carried out in other countries.",

It was not until 1964, however, that the virus was isolated and grown in cell culture (Johnson 1964) . and this paved the way for the development of safe and highly effective vaccines. The virus is now known to be a parvovirus, an interesting group of viruses which have an affinity and requirement for growth in actively dividing cells. Thus, the virus has a predilection for the fetus and newborn where infection may lead to cerebellar ataxia; in older cats, the virus replicates mainly in lymphoid tissue and bone marrow, leading to panleucopenia, and in crypt epithelium of the intestinal mucosa, leading to enteritis (Csiza and others 1971a ,b, Gillespie and Scott 1973 , Kahn 1978 .",

On the other hand, if MDA is thought to be inadequate (either because the queen was never vaccinated or exposed to field virus, or because the kittens were deprived of colostrum) and kittens are thought to be at risk, then vaccination may be carried out from the age of six weeks onwards, or exceptionally, four weeks.

Recently, we have found that approximately 20 per cent of Liverpool University Hospital cases and general practice cases, referred for reasons other than that of respiratory signs were shedding calicivirus (Knowles and others 1989) . In the same study we also found that approximately 85 per cent of cats with chronic stomatitis were feline calicivirus carriers, and approximately 80 per cent had antibody to feline immunodeficiency virus. The significance of this in the pathogenesis of the disease is not known and awaits further study.",

Nevertheless, some strains occur which are not protected for by current vaccines (Pedersen and others 1983, Knowles 1988), and widespread use of particular vaccines may encourage selection for these. Traditionally both viruses have been isolated in approximately equal frequency from cases of feline respiratory disease, but recently, at the University of Liverpool, we have noted a slightly higher isolation rate than expected of feline calicivirus compared to FVR virus (Knowles and others 1989) . This may be explained in part by the antigenic diversity among FVC isolates and the consequent relative efficacy of the two vaccines.",

However, they should be administered carefully as there are occasional reports that if they are inadvertently given via the respiratory route (eg, if a cat licks the injection site or an aerosol is made with the syringe) then respiratory signs can develop (Povey 1977) . Thus in completely virus-free colonies an inactivated vaccine might be preferable. Where rapid onset of protection is required (for example, during an outbreak of disease, or in a stray cat home) then the intranasal route is probably indicated. Complete protection against challenge has been shown four days after intranasal vaccination, and partial protection after two days. The disadvantage is that intranasal vaccine may induce mild sneezing and occasionally other signs but this usually resolves in a few days without treatment. The optimum age for vaccination of young kittens can be difficult to determine. In general, kittens should be vaccinated initially with systemic vaccines at nine weeks of age, when in most cases MDA has declined to non-interfering levels, with the second dose three to four weeks later. However, the duration of maternallyderived antibody in individual kittens can be quite variable; for FVR, two to 10 weeks (Edwards and others 1977, Gaskell and Povey 1982) , and for feline calicivirus, antibody may last up to 10 to 14 weeks (Johnson and Povey 1983 ). In addition, little work has been done in relating maternallyderived antibody levels to either protection or interference with vaccination. As this is an age at which apparent vaccine reactions are common, this is an area which should be looked at further.",

As intranasal vaccine itself can sometimes induce mild clinical signs, vaccination of very young kittens should only be attempted where there is a high and unavoidable risk of exposure.

The incubation period of the feline respiratory viruses is generally two to 10 days, but just occasionally, it may be longer, up to two to three weeks. The second point is that the cat might already be a field virus carrier. Both FVR and feline calicivirus carriers are widespread in the population, and both may show persistent or recurrent signs related to damage from the original infection. In addition, FVR carriers may shed and show signs as a result of stress, and it has been suggested that vaccination and the attendant disruption of routine may sometimes initiate this. It is most unlikely that vaccination will 'cure' carriers, though it is just possible that in FVR it may reduce the severity of the shedding episodes.",

Intranasally vaccinated cats may become carriers of the, albeit attenuated, calicivirus vaccine component, but there is some evidence that intranasal vaccination may protect against the development of the FVR carrier state, at least in the short term (Orr and others 1980) .",

The vaccine seems to stimulate antibody against the viral proteins gp70 (the major envelope protein), p27 (the core protein), and p15E. The reason why the p15E in the vaccine is not immunosuppressive is not clear, possibly it is in a precursor form.

The main reason is that it appears to be immunemediated in that pre-existing antibody actually appears to enhance the disease following challenge (Pedersen and Boyle 1980, Weiss and Scott 1981) . Initial attempts to develop a vaccine confirmed that, except with low doses, vaccination rendered cats more susceptible to disease (Pedersen and Black 1983) . Recent work has explored the possibility of using recombinant viruses carrying specific FIP genes which it is hoped may be important in eliciting a protective rather than an aberrant immune response, but no real success has so far been reported (Spaan and others 1989) .",

Specific causes included falls frum high-rise flats and iatrogenic induction after cleaning the external ear. Twenty-seven animals were affected on the left side and 22 on the right. A specific cause was found in all 16 cats but in only 15 out of 33 dogs. Complete reversal of signs occurred in 36 animals, nine were lost to follow-up and one cat with mediastinal lymphosarcoma was euthanased. Signs persisted in three dogs. Mean recovery for both species was 7.7 weeks. Results of pharmacological testing and various treatments did not affect the outcome. MORGAN ",
