            "text": "1. Contemporary species distributions are determined by a mixture of ecological and historical filters acting on several spatial and temporal scales. Mediterranean climate areas are one of the world's biodiversity hotspots with a high level of endemicity, which is linked to complex ecological and historical factors. 2. This paper explores the ecological and historical factors constraining the distribution of caddisfly species on a large regional scale. A total of 69 taxa were collected from 140 sampling sites in 10 Iberian Mediterranean river basins. Approximately 74% of taxa can be considered rare, with the southern basins (the Baetic-Riffian region) having greater endemicity. The greatest richness, involving a mixture of northern and southern species, was found in the transitional area between the Baetic-Riffian region and the Hesperic Massif. 3. The historical processes occurring during the Tertiary (i.e. the junction of the Eurasian and African plates) explained 3.1% of species distribution, whereas ecological factors accounted for 20.7%. Only 0.3% was explained by the interaction of history and ecology. A set of multi-scale ecological variables (i.e. basin, reach and bedform characteristics) defined five river types with specific caddisfly assemblages. The commonest caddisfly species accounted for the regional distribution pattern, while rare taxa contributed to the explanation of subtle patterns not shown by common species. 4. Despite the importance of historical factors for biogeography and the large scale used in our study, ecological variables better explained caddisfly distribution. This may be explained by the length of time since the historical process we are considering, the high dispersion and colonisation capacity of many caddisfly species, and the strong environmental gradient in the area. Because of the historical and environmental complexity of Mediterranean areas, rare taxa should be included in ecological studies so that the singularity of these ecosystems is not missed.",

The relative effects of historical and multi-scale ecological factors may vary according to the spatial scale of the study. In a large-scale study, history may be more important than in local studies, in which patterns can be explained by environmental variables alone (Townsend et al., 2003) . Several studies have sought to identify the distribution of macroinvertebrate patterns in both large geographical areas (Wright et al., 1984; Corkum, 1989; Quinn & Hickey, 1990; Marchant, Barmuta & Chessman, 1995; Kay et al., 1999 Kay et al., , 2001 and small ones (Ormerod & Edwards, 1987; Gra\u00e7a, Fonseca & Castro, 1989) , revealing the strong relationship between aquatic biota and environmental variables.

Therefore, both historical and environmental characteristics should be used to explain contemporary aquatic organism distribution. In the Iberian Peninsula, two historical factors are significant in defining present aquatic biota: (1) the lack of strong glaciations during the Quaternary, which played an important role in increasing biodiversity; and (2) the incorporation of part of the Baetic-Riffian Massif (south and southeast of Spain) with the Hesperic Massif at the end of the Miocene (Baetic ranges) (Rosenbaum, Lister & Duboz, 2002) . This joining of the Eurasian and African plates enabled North-African species to enter the southeast of the Iberian Peninsula and neo-endemisms to develop there (Ribera et al., 1996; Ribera, 2000) .",

If historical events and ecological factors are important driving forces determining caddisfly distribution in Iberian Mediterranean basins, then we would expect to find significant contributions by both in explaining community variability. If species distributions are the result of the interaction of several multi-scale filters, we would expect caddisfly distribution to respond to a mixture of basin, reach, and bedform factors, and that different assemblages would be found in different combinations of environmental conditions.",

Samples were first examined in the field, and successive samples were taken until no more different families were found. Samples were preserved in 70% alcohol and sorted in the laboratory. Caddisfly taxa were identified to the maximum level possible (see Bonada et al. 2004a) for more information about the collected species), and rank of abundances for each taxon were recorded: 1 from one to three individuals, 2 from four to 10, 3 from 11-100 and 4 for more than 100 individuals. Because of the large number of undescribed larvae in the Iberian Peninsula (Vieira-Lanero, 2000) and the small size of many individuals (first larval instars), we were not able to identify the species of all larvae with certainty. When possible, pupae and adults were collected in the field to ensure correct identification. In some cases, mature larvae were reared in the laboratory. Consequently, different taxonomical levels were mixed between sites and even within a single site, which may hinder the achievement of some objectives at the community level (Cuffney et al., 2002) . To minimise this problem, the caddisfly data matrix with all individuals identified at the maximum possible level (called 'caddis-max') was compared with the same matrix in modified form (called 'caddis-mod'). This modified matrix was constructed as follows: the unidentified taxa were deleted from the analyses when they represented a small proportion of the sample, and most individuals were identified to species. In contrast, when most of the individuals remained unidentified because they were too small or too young or for taxonomical reasons, all individuals were clumped to genus or family level. Both matrices, caddis-max and caddismod, were compared using Mantel's standardised correlation coefficient (r M ) tested by random permutations (999 runs) (Mantel, 1967) . ",

The sum of canonical eigenvalues of each analysis compared with the sum of all eigenvalues (i.e. inertia) was retained to calculate the relative influence of both factors. Because the ecological data matrix included samples collected during different seasons, the effect of seasonality (measured as four dummy variables: spring, summer, autumn, and winter) was tested with a CCA. The relationship of this matrix with environmental variables was extracted with a pCCA. Finally, nonexplained variability was also calculated. To decide whether to use a linear or a unimodal ordination method, the gradient length was measured using a detrended correspondence analysis (DCA), detrending-by-segments and non-linear re-scaling of axes. Results of this analysis indicated that the first DCA axis has a gradient length of 5.70 standard deviation units, justifying the use of unimodal response models (Lep\u0161 & \u0160milauer, 2003) . Therefore, an indirect analysis of correspondence analysis (CA) using biological data was performed. To detect how environmental variables determine organisms' patterns, direct ordination was used. A pCCA was performed instead of a simple CCA to extract the influence of temporal patterns, because significant differences between seasons in caddisfly communities were found after an Multi-Response Permutation Procedures (MRPP) test (A \u00bc 0.003; P \u00bc 0.022). Most significant environmental variables were selected by forward selection method and rare species were down-weighted to avoid bias in the final results in CA and pCCA analysis. Canonical axes obtained with pCCA ordination were tested for significance using a Monte Carlo permutation test (199 runs). Eigenvalues of CA were kept and compared with the ones obtained in pCCA to show whether the measured environmental variables used in the pCCA reflect the gradient shown by CA. Finally, Pearson correlations were calculated between the projections of samples in CA and pCCA axes, to decide the number of axes to be interpreted. The CANOCO program was used to compute all ordinations (ter Braak & \u0160milauer, 1998) .",

Thus, the caddis-mod matrix was used to simplify the analysis Trichoptera in Iberian Mediterranean rivers 785 and the interpretation of results. Although this may result in a loss of historical and ecological signal, the caddis-mod matrix is more reliable because it rules out problems relating to taxonomy and a variety of organism sizes in one sample. A total of 69 taxa were obtained, although species richness was somewhat higher, because we grouped some species at the generic level (e.g. Sericostoma, Wormaldia). The Segura basin had the highest taxon richness (42), whereas in the Aguas and Mijares Basins fewer than 20 taxa were found. The rest of the basins had intermediate values of taxon richness (between 20 and 32 taxa). Table 2 gives the maximum abundance of each caddisfly taxon in each basin and their frequency of appearance. The number of rare taxa found was high, with 73.9% in fewer than 5% of samples and only 10 taxa found in more than 10% of samples. Hydropsyche gr. pellucidula and Hydroptila sp. were found in all sampled basins. Many caddisflies were absent from only one basin (e.g. Agapetus sp., Chimarra marginata Stephens, Mesophylax aspersus (Rambur), Hydropsyche exocellata Duf\u00f6 ur, Polycentropus sp. and Tinodes sp.). 26% of taxa were absent from northern basins, whereas 22% were absent from southern ones.

The results of our study add to previous knowledge that caddisfly species composition in Mediterranean basins shifts from a dominance of Palearctic species in northern basins to an increasing presence of North African and endemic species in southern basins, with the Segura Basin's mix of species making it the richest of all. Vascular plant records from the Segura region also indicate that it is one of the most diverse regions in the Iberian Peninsula (Alcaraz et al., 2000a,b) . Similarly, studying aquatic Coleoptera and Heteroptera in the Segura Basin area, Moreno et al. (1997) noticed high richness of taxa with different biogeographical origins. Therefore, considerable evidence indicates the importance of historical factors that occurred at the coming together of Southern Europe and North Africa in explaining terrestrial and aquatic species distributions. In a study comparing the richness of freshwater fishes in Western Europe and North America, Oberdorff, Hugueny & Gu\u00e9gan (1997) found that the distance from each river to the larger refuge area (a variable that is related to Pleistocene glaciation events) was significant, but explained only 1% of variance. Our study shows that history itself accounts for up to 3.1% of all variability in caddisfly distributions in the Iberian Mediterranean area. However, despite the relative importance of historical factors and the large scale used in our study, ecological variables better explained caddisfly distribution. There are three possible explanations: (1) contemporary species patterns may have faded with time, because the historical event we are considering occurred long ago and macroinvertebrates, especially many caddisflies, show high dispersion and colonisation capacities (Sheldon, 1984) ; (2) the effect of history could be masked by the strong environmental gradient in the area (see Robles et al., 2002) ; and (3) some historical events may influence ecological variables, for example geology. However, although basin geology is related to paleogeographic origin, the result is usually a mixture of calcareous, siliceous and sedimentary materials. Thus, with the environmental variables used to measure basins' geological composition, we mostly distinguished between materials and not between regions. In addition, most of these environmental factors interact weakly with the historical event in explaining caddisfly distribution, as the fact that only 0.3% of variance is explained by the environment-history interaction shows.",

Combinations of all these significant variables resulted in five groups of sites with their corresponding caddisfly assemblages, which could be explained mainly by geology and longitudinal zonation. All basin variables but only half of the reach and bedform variables were significant in the discriminant analysis. In a study analysing the influence of basin, reach and bedform variables on macroinvertebrates, Townsend et al. (2003) found that large-scale variables were more important than local variables in explaining macroinvertebrate composition in a New Zealand river. In fact, the relative influence of large-scale variables compared with local ones depends on the range of human-modified and natural environmental conditions, the area of study and the predictor used to measure macroinvertebrate communities (e.g. assemblage attributes, relative abundance or presence/ absence) (Weigel et al., 2003) .",

For example, the significant presence of shredders and woody-cased caddisflies in group 1 [Halesus sp., Chaetopteryx sp., Glyphotaelius pellucidus (Retzius) and Potamophylax spp.] might characterise this group with a higher riparian structure than others in which these species were not significant. Similarly, in midstream reaches of group 4, the best indicator species jointly with those with significant but low indicator values [Cheumatopsyche lepida (Pictet) or R. dorsalis] distinguished different conditions of water quality because the species have differing degrees of tolerance to pollution (Bonada et al., 2004b) . In this study, other local factors such as ephemerality [one important characteristic of Mediterranean climate rivers - Gasith & Resh (1999) -not significant in our study] were associated with several species in the pCCA, such as G. pellucidus in group 1 or S. argentipunctellus and M. aspersus in group 3, but at the same time these species were mixed with other species associated with perennial streams, such as Hydropsyche dinarica Marinkovic-Gospodnetic (Bonada et al., 2004a) or H. infernalis (Ruiz et al., 2001) . These trends shown by rare species within the main classification suggest that they may respond to local and subtle factors particular to each group. Cao, Larsen & Thorne (2001) based this suggestion on a literature review, but its application to bioassessment was questioned by Marchant (2002) .",

            "text": "Although not all organisms were classified at the species level, a great number of rare taxa were found in this study. Rare taxa are reported in a high proportion in most stream macroinvertebrate studies (Lenat & Resh, 2001) . However, although our study included samples collected over four seasons, on calculating the percentage of rare species for each season, the levels we found were much higher (a mean of about 12% higher) than those found in literature dealing with a large set of sites (Wiberg-Larsen et al., 2000; Boyero, 2003) . However, a large number of rare taxa may be possible in Mediterranean fauna because of the high diversity and endemicity recorded there, making the area distinctive in biogeographical terms and one of the biodiversity hotspots of the world (Balletto & Casale, 1991; Cowling et al., 1996; Blondel & Aronson, 1999; Myers et al., 2000) . In fact, the Iberian Peninsula hosts more caddisfly species than any other part of Europe (390 species in the Iberian Peninsula -Gonz\u00e1lez, 2003 -in comparison with, for example, the 198 recorded in the British Isles -Wallace, Wallace & Philipson, 1990; Edington & Hildrew, 1995) , but has similar numbers to other countries around the Mediterranean Sea Basin (e.g. Italy, with 381 species -Cianficconi, 2002) . However, although Austin & Greig-Smith (1968) found that the percentage of variability explained in principal components analysis dropped on increasing the number of rare taxa included, the numerous rare taxa found in our study did not imply a lower percentage of explained variability by measured environmental factors than in other studies (e.g. 34% of explained variability in Aguiar, Ferreira & Pinto, 2002) . Furthermore, explained variability was higher than the values reported by M\u00f8ller & Jennions (2002) (but see Peek et al., 2003) in a meta-analysis study using published data from many different sources, in which it was found that the mean amount of variance explained by the factors used was 2.51-5.42%. This would imply that, in spite of the high number of taxa found, they respond to measured variables. Thus, studies involving many rare taxa should include as many environmental variables as possible to ensure good explanation of species variability, since the relationship between rare species and environmental factors is difficult to characterise (Marchant, 2002) . In addition, factors such as interactions between organisms, dispersal abilities, or chance, are examples of factors not considered in our study that could reduce the amount of unexplained variability.",

The historical factor occurring in the south of the Iberian Peninsula may be viewed as a significant filter for some species, but ecological Trichoptera in Iberian Mediterranean rivers 793 factors go further in explaining the current regional caddisfly distribution, as may be expected from ecosystems with high spatial and temporal variability like Mediterranean rivers. This variability is expressed by the presence of many rare species, which should be taken into account when attempting to preserve these highly diverse ecosystems.",
