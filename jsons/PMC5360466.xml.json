Increased concentrations of the peptide (0.5 mM, 1 mM, 2 mM) resulted in blocking of the virus, as a percent of control (media without peptides), to be significantly decreased compared with treatment with media alone (76.33%, 64.17%, and 51.60%, respectively; P < 0.05).

We synthesized peptides with each of those single aa changes (MRTRVSRLY, TRTRVSGLY) to evaluate the region of the peptide critical in binding and replication. Altering aa 440 (T\u2192M) had no impact on inhibition of binding and replication, with both TRTRVSRLY and MRTRVSRLY significantly inhibiting RRV function. However, alteration at peptide 446 (R\u2192G) inhibited the peptide's ability to block binding and replication (Fig. 4A,B). This result suggests that the critical portion of the 9 aa sequence lay within the last five residues. We then investigated the latter half of the TRTRVSRLY sequence to determine which aa govern the peptide's function. Peptides measuring 5 aa were synthesized with single aa changes at each position of the VP4 VSRLY sequence. Assaying rotavirus binding and replication revealed that peptides in which the SRL aa sequence was preserved (VSRLY, ISRLY, and VSRLA) maintained the ability to inhibit virus binding and replication. Those peptides in which the S, R, or L peptide was modified (VVRLY, VSGLY, VSRAY) were unable to exhibit such inhibition (Fig. 4C,D). These results suggest that the presence of the SRL aa sequence is integral to RRV\u2013cholangiocyte binding and viral replication.",

When blocked with antibodies, the ability of rotavirus to infect the cell is diminished.30 The Hsc70 protein has been shown to be involved in secondary rotavirus binding through a post\u2010attachment step17, 30, 45 by way of the peptide sequences KID (642\u2010658) and FSG (531\u2010554).31, 32 The rotavirus capsid protein, composed of VP4 (later cleaved into VP5 and VP8) and VP7, is responsible for initial cell interaction. VP4 has been shown to play an essential role in cellular binding and attachment.45 Previous investigations of aa sequences within the VP4 protein by Zarate et al.32 provided knowledge that specific Hsc70 binding occurs through the KID (aa 642\u2010658) domain on VP5. Blocking this domain impedes viral replication, though not binding, suggesting that this is a secondary binding site. Similarly, Gualtero et al.31 showed the FSG peptide (aa 531\u2010554) within VP4 is implicated in Hsc70 binding and also plays a role in rotavirus replication, though not primary binding. Through our investigation of the TRTRVSRLY peptide, we determined that this unique peptide, unlike previously described peptides, interacts with Hsc70 during the primary binding phase of the VP4 domain of RRV, whereas the previously established peptides are involved in a post\u2010attachment step. Thus, blocking Hsc70 through siRNA had a significant effect in blocking RRV binding. Replication of RRV, however, was similar to that of previous reports and was inhibited not only by TRTRSVRLY but also the KID and FSG peptides.30, 32 Studies are underway to elucidate these differences.",

Several of these (cytomegalovirus, Epstein\u2010Barr virus, human papillomavirus, and reovirus) have been found in explanted livers of infants with BA.3, 4, 5, 6, 7 This aa sequence was found on viral attachment proteins in cytomegalovirus and reovirus. In Epstein\u2010Barr virus and human papillomavirus, it is also located on the viral capsid. Thus, this sequence may be involved in cholangiocyte binding in a similar fashion to the RRV VSRLY peptide. The role of Hsc70 binding and human BA induction as a function of these proteins has not yet been established.",
