There is a high homology (69% identical at the protein level) between the 2 isoenzymes. ALT2 has a wider organ distribution, including skeletal muscles and adipose tissue. To date, however, the clinical significance of ALT2 in the diagnosis of liver disease remains to be defined.8\n",

            "text": "Recently, there has been renewed attention about what constitutes the normal range for serum activities of aminotransferase, particularly ALT. Traditionally a level around 40 has been considered the upper limit of normal based on the mean and standard deviation calculated in apparently healthy reference subjects.9 There is an increasing consensus that the conventional normal range may have been set too high, because the reference subjects presumed to be healthy may have included individuals with asymptomatic liver disease, such as nonalcoholic fatty liver disease and chronic hepatitis C. When more stringent criteria are applied to exclude subjects with a high probability of liver disease, the upper limit of the normal range becomes considerably lower. Prati and colleagues10 analyzed samples of blood donors carefully selected to exclude those at risk of liver disease by using criteria such as normal body mass index (BMI), normal cholesterol, triglyceride, and glucose levels, and no potentially hepatotoxic medications. The upper limit of normal ALT in that study was determined to be 30 U/L for men and 19 U/L for women. Although these updated normal values are frequently cited, one may note that they way the upper limit of normal was set in that particular study was different from the usual convention. Whereas most laboratory normal ranges are taken from the middle 95%, ie, 2.5th to 97.5th percentiles of the population, Prati and colleagues10 chose to take the lower 95th percentile as normal. The authors believe that the normal ranges proposed in that study are set too low.",

In other words, normal ALT is not necessarily healthy ALT. In a large population-based study from South Korea, serum ALT activity measured at baseline was correlated with subsequent mortality. In particular, compared with men with ALT less than 20 IU/L, those with ALT of 20 to 29 IU/L had a 2.9-fold increase in liver mortality and those with ALT of 30 to 39 IU/L had a 9.5-fold increase in mortality.2 The authors also have evaluated ALT and AST activities as a predictor of future mortality. Using population-based data in Olmsted County, AST and ALT results in a given year were correlated with subsequent all-cause mortality. Similar to the data by Kim and colleagues,3 there was a positive correlation between the standardized mortality ratio and the aminotransferase results. Further, the increase in mortality could be discerned with aminotransferase values less than the upper limit of normal set by the laboratory at that time.",

Several factors such as age, sex, and BMI influence its activities in subjects without known liver disease.11 In addition, an early study by Friedman showed that ALT elevation was intermittent in 36% and persistent in 28% during up to 7 months of observation.12 One limitation of the study is that it included a large proportion (63%) of patients who were consuming alcohol regularly, making it possible that not all of the fluctuation of ALT was simply a result of its variability. A subsequent study by Lazo and colleagues13 investigated variability of liver enzymes using the samples of the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey. Out of nearly 20,000 survey respondents, 1864 had 2 biochemical assessments separated by a mean of 18 days. In the initial testing, 6.2% and 5.9% had abnormal AST and ALT, respectively, using normal ranges defined by the laboratory. Of those with initially elevated results, more than 30% (35.6% for AST and 31.2% for ALT) were reclassified as normal in the follow-up tests. As expected, mildly elevated of AST and ALT were more likely to normalize on repeat testing; most people who transitioned from abnormal to normal had initial elevation within 1.1 to 2.0 times the normal range. Another element of intraindividual variability in aminotransferases is diurnal variation. According to Cordoba and colleagues,14 ALT level is lowest at night and highest in the afternoon.",

In early NAFLD, ALT is usually higher than AST (AST/ALT < 1).17 As NAFLD advances and causes liver fibrosis, the AST/ALT ratio reverses to the degree that ALT in patients with cirrhosis from NAFLD may be normal.18 This trend is reflected in the NAFLD fibrosis score (\u22121.675 + 0.037 \u00d7 age [years] + 0.094 \u00d7 BMI [kg/m2] + 1.13 \u00d7 impaired fasting glucose/diabetes [yes = 1, no = 0] + 0.99 \u00d7 AST/ALT ratio \u2212 0.013 \u00d7 platelet [\u00d7109/L] \u2212 0.66 \u00d7 albumin [g/dL]), which may be used to estimate liver fibrosis.19\n",

Based on various causes of acute and chronic hepatitis, subsequent testing is outlined in the algorithm. Often, a liver biopsy is considered the ultimate diagnostic test for abnormal liver enzymes. However, given the risk of bleeding and other complications, discomfort/pain, and expenses associated with a liver biopsy, a clear risk-benefit calculation is needed before one is performed.

For example, increased intra-abdominal pressure from carbon dioxide inflation during a laparoscopic procedure can cause the compression of the inferior vena cava, leading to a decreased cardiac output and systemic hypotension.57 Transient decrease of cardiac output from any cardiopulmonary procedure can cause liver enzyme elevation from ischemia. Spinal anesthesia is not necessarily safer than general anesthesia. In most cases, ischemic liver injury is transient and does not require specific therapy.
