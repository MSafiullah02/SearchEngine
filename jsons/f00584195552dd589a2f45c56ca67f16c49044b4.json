In order to study potential impact of infection, complete epidemiological information should be reported on regular basis however, data from Pakistan has not yet been published. This retrospective study is the first report of epidemiological trends of COVID-19 in Faisalabad, Pakistan. On April 4 th , 2020, 128 nasopharyngeal swabs collected from city Faisalabad were transported to Postgraduate Research Institute, Lahore for further processing. RNA was extracted using QIAsymphony DSP Virus/Pathogen Midi Kit and real-time PCR was performed to quantify COVID-19. Our finding showed that overall prevalence of COVID-19 in Faisalabad on April 4 th was 17.18% (22 of 128).",
