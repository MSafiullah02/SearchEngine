This is for example the case for multilingual collections where documents are not available in all languages. Some studies tackled this problem by assuming the existence of view generation functions to approximately complete the missing views; for example Machine Translation to translate documents into the missing languages. These functions generally require an external resource to be set and their quality has a direct impact on the performance of the learned multiview classifier over the completed training set. Our proposed approach addresses this problem by jointly learning the missing views and the multiview classifier using a tripartite game with two generators and a discriminator. Each of the generators is associated to one of the views and tries to fool the discriminator by generating the other missing view conditionally on the corresponding observed view. The discriminator then tries to identify if for an observation, one of its views is completed by one of the generators or if both views are completed along with its class. Our results on a subset of Reuters RCV1/RCV2 collections show that the discriminator achieves significant classification performance; and that the generators learn the missing views with high quality without the need of any consequent external resource.",

This is a typical situation in many applications where different sources generate different views of samples unevenly; like text information present in all Wikipedia pages while images are more scarce. Another example is multilingual text classification where documents are available in two languages and share the same set of classes while some are just written in one language. Previous works supposed the existence of view generating functions to complete the missing views before deploying a learning strategy [2] . However, the performance of the global multiview approach is biased by the quality of the generating functions which generally require external resources to be set. The challenge is hence to learn an efficient model from the multiple views of training data without relying on an extrinsic approach to generate altered views for samples that have missing ones.",

These models have been mostly applied to image analysis and major advances have been made on generating realistic images with low variability [7, 15, 16] . GANs take their origin from the game theory and are formulated as a two players game formed by a generator G and a discriminator D. The generator takes a noise z and produces a sample G(z) in the input space, on the other hand the discriminator determines whenever a sample comes from the true distribution of the data or if it is generated by G. Other works included an inverse mapping from the input to the latent representation, mostly referred to as BiGANs, and showed the usefulness of the learned feature representation for auxiliary discriminant problems [8, 9] . This idea paved the way for the design of efficient approaches for generating coherent synthetic views of an input image [6, 14, 21] .",

The model learns the representation of missing versions of bilingual documents jointly with the association to their respective classes, and is composed of a discriminator D and two generators G 1 and G 2 formulated as a tripartite game. For a given document with a missing version in one language, the corresponding generator induces the latter conditionally on the observed one. The training of the generators is carried out by minimizing a regularized version of the cross-entropy measure proposed for multi-class classification with GANs [19] in a way to force the models to generate views such that the completed bilingual documents will have high class assignments. At the same time, the discriminator learns the association between documents and their classes and distinguishes between observations that have their both views and those that got a completed view by one of the generators. This is achieved by minimizing an aggregated cross-entropy measure in a way to force the discriminator to be certain of the class of observations with their complete views and uncertain of the class of documents for which one of the versions was completed. The regularization term in the objectives of generators is derived from an adapted feature matching technique [17] which is an effective way for preventing from situations where the models become unstable; and which leads to fast convergence.",

The three main families of techniques for (semi-)supervised learning are (kernel) Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA), Multiple kernel learning (MKL) and co-regularization. CCA finds pairs of highly correlated subspaces between the views that is used for mapping the data before training, or integrated in the learning objective [3, 10] . MKL considers one kernel per view and different approaches have been proposed for their learning. In one of the earliest work, [4] proposed an efficient algorithm based on sequential minimization techniques for learning a corresponding support vector machine defined over a convex nonsmooth optimization problem. Co-regularization techniques tend to minimize the disagreement between the single-view classifiers over their outputs on unlabeled examples by adding a regularization term to the objective function [18] . Some approaches have also tackled the tedious question of combining the predictions of the view specific classifiers [20] . However all these techniques assume that views of a sample are complete and available during training and testing.",

The former approaches rely mostly on an encoder-encoder network to first map images into a latent space and then generate their views using an inverse mapping. This is a very exciting problem, however, our learning objective differs from these approaches as we are mostly interested in the classification of muti-view samples with missing views. The most similar work to ours that uses GANs for multiview classification is probably [6] . This approach generates missing views of images in the same latent space than the input image, while Cond 2 GANs learns the representations of the missing views in their respective input spaces conditionally on the observed ones which in general are from other feature spaces. Furthermore, Cond 2 GANs benefits from low complexity and stable convergence which has been shown to be lacking in the previous approach.",

The bottleneck is that MT systems depend on external resources, and they require a huge amount of parallel collections containing documents and their translations in all languages of interest for their tuning.

The proposed model consists of three neural networks that are trained using an objective implementing a three players game between a discriminator, D, and two generators, G 1 and G 2 . The game that these models play is depicted in Fig. 1 and it can be summarized as follows. At each step, if an observation is chosen with a missing view, the corresponding generator -G 1 (respectively G 2 ) if the first (respectively second) view is missingproduces the view from random noise conditionally on the observed view in a way to fool the discriminator. On the other hand, the discriminator takes as input an observation with both of its views complete or completed and, classifies it if the views are initially observed or tells if a view was produced by one of the generators. Formally, both generators G 1 and G 2 take as input; samples from the training subsets S 2 and S 1 respectively; as well as random noise drawn from a uniform distribution defined over the input space of the missing view and produce the corresponding pseudo-view, which is missing; i.e. G 1 (z 1 , x 2 ) =x 1 and G 2 (x 1 , z 2 ) =x 2 . These models are learned in a way to replicate the conditional distributions p(x 1 |x 2 , z 1 ) and p(x 2 |x 1 , z 2 ); and inherently define two probability distributions, denoted respectively by p G1 and p G2 , as the distribution of samples if both views where observed i.e. (x 1 ,",

The task of D is then to recognize observations from S 1 and S 2 that have completed views by G 1 and G 2 and to classify examples from S to their true classes. To achieve this goal we add a fake class, K + 1, to the set of classes, Y, corresponding to samples that have one of their views generated by G 1 or G 2 . The dimension of the discriminator's output is hence set to K + 1 which by applying softmax is supposed to estimate the posterior probability of classes for each multiview observation (with complete or completed views) given in input. For an observation x \u2208 X , we use D K+1 (x) = p D (y = K + 1|x) to estimate the probability that one of its views is generated by G 1 or G 2 . As the task of the generators is to produce good quality views such that the observation with the completed view will be assigned to its true class with high probability, we follow [17] by supplying the discriminator to not get fooled easily as stated in the following assumption:",

This corresponds to the case where the effort of gathering documents in different languages is much less than translating them from one language to another. To this end, we randomly select m F = 300 samples having their both views, m 1 = m 2 = 6000 samples with one of their views missing and the remaining samples without their translations for test. In order to evaluate the quality of generated views by Cond 2 GANs we considered two scenarios. In the first one (denoted by TEN\u1e7d), we test on English documents by considering the generation of these documents with respect to the other view (v \u2208 {FR, GR, IT, SP}) using the corresponding generator. In the second scenario (denoted by T\u1ebc Nv ), we test on documents that are written in another language than English by considering their generation on English provided by the other generator. For evaluation, we test the following four classification approaches along with Cond 2 GANs; one singleview approach and four multiview approaches. In the singleview approach (denoted by c v ) classifiers are the same as the discriminator and they are trained on the part of the training set with examples having their corresponding view observed. The multiview approaches are MKL [4] , coclassification (co-classif) [1] , unanimous vote ( mv b ) [2] . Results are evaluated over the test set using the accuracy and the F 1 measure which is the harmonic average of precision and recall. The reported performance are averaged over 20 random (train/test) sets, and the parameters of Adam optimization algorithm are set to \u03b1 = 10 \u22124 , \u03b2 = 0.5.",

We start our evaluation by comparing the F 1 scores over the test set, obtained with Cond 2 GANs and a neural network having the same architecture than the discriminator D of Cond 2 GANs trained over the concatenated views of documents in the training set where the missing views are generated by Machine Translation. Figure 2 shows these results. Each point represents a class, where its abscissa (resp. ordinate) represents the test F 1 score of the Neural Network trained using MT (resp. one of the generators of Cond 2 GANs) to complete the missing views. All of the classes, in the different language pair scenarios, are above the line of equality, suggesting that the generated views by Cond 2 GANs provide higher value information than translations provided by MT for learning the Neural Network. This is an impressive finding, as the resources necessary for the training of MT is large (8.10 6 pairs of sentences and their translations); while Cond 2 GANs does both view completion and discrimination using only the available training data. This is mainly because both generators induce missing views with the same distribution than real pairs of views as stated in Corollary 1.",

Table 2 summarizes these results obtained by Cond 2 GANs, MKL, co-classif, and mv b for both test scenarios. In all cases Cond 2 GANs, provides significantly better results than other approaches. This provides empirical evidence of the effectiveness of the joint view generation and class prediction of Cond 2 GANs. Furthermore, MKL, co-classif and Cond 2 GANs are binary classification models and tackle the multiclass classification case with one vs all strategy making them to suffer from class imbalance problem. Results obtained using the F 1 measure are in line with those of Table 2 and they are not reported for the sake of space. ",

The model consists of three neuralnetworks implementing a three players game between a discriminator and two generators. For an observation with a missing view, the corresponding generator produces the view conditionally on the other observed one. The discriminator is trained to recognize observations with a generated view from others having their views complete and to classify the latter into one of the existing classes. We evaluate the effectiveness of our approach on another challenging application than image analysis which is the domain of choice for the design of new GAN models. Our experiments on a subset of Reuters RCV1/RCV2 show the effectiveness of Cond 2 GANs to generate high quality views allowing to achieve significantly better results, compared to the case where the missing views are generated by Machine Translation which requires a large collection of sentences and their translations to be tuned. As future study, we will be working on the generalization of the proposed model to more than 2 views. One possible direction is the use of an aggregation function of available views as a condition to the generators.",

In Fig. 3, we compare F 1 measures between Cond 2 GANs and one of the single-view classifiers with an increasing number of training samples, having the view corresponding to the singleview classifier observed; while the number of training examples with the other observed view is fixed. With an increasing number of training samples, the corresponding singleview classifier gains in performance. On the other hand, Cond 2 GANs can leverage the lack of information from training examples having their other view observed, making that the difference of performance between these models for small number of training samples is higher.",
