Levels of significance between normally distributed data were determined using parametric independent samples t-test. Unmatched data that were not normally distributed were tested for significant differences using the Mann\u2013Whitney nonparametric test. Both the Fisher's Exact Test and an Exact Cochran-Armitage Trend Test were also conducted on categorical variables. Although these analyses test against the null hypothesis (assume that the proportions are the same across all three years of sampling), the Fisher's Exact Test is based on the assumption that at least one year differs from the other two years. The Exact Cochran-Armitage Trend Test assumes there is a continuous increasing or decreasing trend across all three years. We report only P-values from the Fisher's Exact Test due to similar results from both tests and its familiarity.",
