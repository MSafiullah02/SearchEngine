One of the reasons for this is that preclinical testing currently relies on head-to-head comparisons of vaccine candidates across a number of animal models. Progression through the preclinical pipeline is largely based on immunogenicity readouts which have been criticised for being oversimplified8\u201310, and challenge studies which are time consuming and costly, and require a large number of animals for sufficient statistical power. Challenge studies have historically relied on use of MTB laboratory strains to evaluate vaccine protection. However, differences in virulence, fitness and T-cell subset responses in animal models challenged with diverse clinical strains of MTB have been reported11\u201313, and there is therefore growing interest in preclinical testing of vaccines against MTB isolates representative of the global diversity of the MTB complex (MTBC).",

The mycobacterial growth inhibition assay (MGIA) has been used as an \u2018ex vivo challenge model\u2019 to analyse the summative capacity of a mixed population of ex vivo derived host cells to control mycobacterial growth after vaccination14. MTB challenge is not required as host cells are harvested from animals at the peak of the immune response following vaccination. The functional efficacy of the vaccine is then predicted by ex vivo co-culture of host cells with mycobacteria. Quantification of mycobacterial growth is predominantly performed using the BACTEC mycobacterial growth indicator tube (MGIT) system, but conventional colony forming unit (CFU) enumeration from culture on solid media has also been used15. The cost and study duration of the MGIA are lower than a comparative MTB challenge study, and animal welfare is also improved. Since each animal provides sufficient cells for multiple assay inputs, the MGIA offers the potential to analyse multiple lineages of the MTBC in parallel, using considerably fewer animals than a challenge study of the same design16. These concepts are in line with the \u2018Refinement\u2019 and \u2018Reduction\u2019 criteria defined by the UK National Centre for the 3Rs17.",

To the best of our knowledge, an MGIA using lung cells from animal models of TB has not been reported. In this report, we present an optimised MGIA protocol for use with murine lung cells, to assess the ability of host lung cells to inhibit mycobacterial growth following vaccination. Following optimisation of host cell and bacterial input number, the lung MGIA was able to detect differences in both BCG (as a surrogate of MTB) and MTB Erdman growth inhibition between vaccine groups. Where residual BCG from immunisation was present in input cells, we found that use of the BCG inhibitor, 2-thiophenecarboxylic acid hydrazide (TCH), revealed additional MTB Erdman growth inhibition. In combination with current methods of preclinical TB vaccine assessment, the ex vivo lung MGIA could be used as a tool for analysis of vaccine efficacy and the underlying immune mechanisms associated with vaccination.",

In our hands, BCG Pasteur Aeras grows faster than MTB Erdman when plated on 7H11 agar plates (data not shown). The BACTEC MGIT system is unable to differentiate between mycobacterial species and CFU input is estimated in the MGIA using a mycobacteria-specific standard curve.

The assay was performed in the presence or absence of TCH. Significant growth inhibition of MTB Erdman was noted in all vaccinated groups compared with the unvaccinated group and intra-assay variability (CV) was reduced using 200 CFU MTB Erdman compared to 100 CFU (Supplementary Table S1). When TCH was added to MGITs, a further reduction in MTB Erdman CFU was observed in the BCG i.n group. Differences in MTB Erdman growth inhibition following vaccination were consistent with in vivo protection reported in the literature24,30, as well as with growth inhibition observed in the BCG MGIA performed in this study. Using a low-dose MTB aerosol challenge model, Copland et al. report enhanced control of MTB in murine lung boosted with spore-FP1 following BCG prime compared with BCG alone (0.70 vs 1.44 log10 CFU reduction vs PBS control)24. A number of mouse studies have demonstrated superior protection in the lung in challenge studies following BCG i.n. compared with BCG s.c. at comparable time points following vaccination30,37,38. While the MGIA aims to model vaccine protection observed in in vivo challenge studies, we do not expect log10 CFU values from the BACTEC MGIT system to match those obtained from challenge studies. The number of host cells and CFU associated with in vivo studies are different to the MGIA and we predict that the assay is not able to model the full complexity of an in vivo system. It is however encouraging to observe that results are consistent at the group level with existing literature. We suggest that future studies using the lung MGIA perform challenge studies in parallel to confirm that growth inhibition following vaccination translates to protection in the murine model.",

The BACTEC MGIT system is generally favoured over colony counting since CFU determination is slower and more labour intensive than the BACTEC method, and the absence of standardised reagents and element of subjectivity in manual counting may result in increased inter-assay variation15. Furthermore, the BACTEC MGIT system is unaffected by clumping and provides an accurate computer-generated readout based on validated technology21. However, reagents and equipment for the BACTEC MGIT system are costly. Therefore, to make the lung MGIA more accessible, particularly in resource-limited settings, MTB Erdman enumeration was also performed by culture on solid media. Under the optimised conditions described, comparable results were observed in all groups (Supplementary Fig. S2). However, consistent with previous reports, a reduction in the sensitivity of the MGIA when plating on solid media has been found between independent assay runs of the optimised lung MGIA presented here (Supplementary Fig. S4). Where differences in growth inhibition in the lung between vaccinated and non-vaccinated animals are small, for example when administering BCG s.c., a consistent reduction in MTB Erdman growth of <0.50 log10 CFU is noted using the BACTEC MGIT system; however, this difference is inconsistently found on plates in experiments performed in tandem with the BACTEC system. This observation suggests that the BACTEC MGIT system should be used when differences in growth inhibition are expected to be more conservative in the lung, for example when using systemic vaccine regimens, to ensure that smaller differences in growth are detected by the assay.",

Further optimisation of the assay is required for use with multiple MTBC lineages and in vivo challenge studies will need to be performed in parallel with the assay to confirm that growth inhibition following vaccination translates to protection. At present, it is encouraging to see that growth inhibition observed using various vaccination strategies is consistent with existing literature at the group level, indicating that the MGIA may represent a complementary tool to MTB challenge studies and immunogenicity measures for preclinical evaluation of TB vaccine strategies.

For i.n. immunisations, mice were anaesthetised by intraperitoneal injection of ketamine (50 mg/kg; Ketalar, Pfizer Itd, Walton Oaks, UK) and xylazine (10 mg/kg; Rompun, Bayer plc, Newbury, UK) in physiological saline solution for irrigation, followed by delivery of 50 \u03bcL (0.5 \u00d7 106 CFU) BCG Pasteur Aeras equally administered between the two nostrils. Animals in the BCG s.c. + spore-FP1 boost arm were administered BCG Pasteur Aeras s.c. (as described) at week 0, followed by i.n. boosting at week 3 with spore-FP1. FP1 is a fusion protein constructed of MTB proteins, ACR, Ag85B and HBHA. Cloning and production of FP1 were previously described by Copland et al. For formulation of spore-FP1, FP1 (Lionex GmbH, Braunschweig, Germany) was incubated with Bacillus subtilis spores (Sporegen, Egham, UK) for one hour at room temperature and administered shortly following formulation. Animals were anaesthetised in the manner described for i.n. BCG, followed by delivery of 1 \u00d7 109\nB. subtilis spores coated with 10 \u00b5g FP1 (delivery volume: 40 \u00b5L/animal) equally between the two nostrils. Control animals received no treatment. BCG CFU input was confirmed by plating the diluted inoculum on Middlebrook 7H11 agar (Yorlab) plates containing 10% OADC supplement and 0.5% glycerol. All animals were rested for six weeks following vaccination and then sacrificed by exposure to carbon dioxide gas in a rising concentration.",
