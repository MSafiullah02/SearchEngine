Research has shown that the managerial costs in Chinese firms are chiefly caused by defects inherent in the governance of these firms.35 Without fundamental improvements in the corporate governance system, the costs are likely to continue to inflate.

The supervisory model of food safety mapped out in the new laws can be summarized as: relying mainly on the segment-based approach, supplemented by a category-based approach.42 In other words, the administration of food quality is undertaken by multiple inspection and administrative agencies, exercising their authorities in different stages of food production and services and targeting different types of foods.43 Such an arrangement poses a potential risk in regards to conflict of powers, though the new laws allude to the benefits of efficient coordination among these agencies by identifying their authorities and duties in different stages of production and services.44 Given the gaps in the existing laws, it is very likely that China will encounter further challenges in food supervision caused by its inefficient administrative system. Speaking from a broader perspective, China is not the only country that has applied a multi-agency approach to food supervision and administration. The United States and Japan have also adopted a scheme of assigning duties of food administration to multiple governmental agencies and departments.45 However, their comprehensive and detailed stipulations on division of responsibilities, quality standards, transparency and public scrutiny have ensured effectiveness of the system and smooth coordination among the agencies. Moreover, it is noteworthy that even in countries such as the United States, there are increasing calls for combining their multiple agencies into a single agency to further the operational efficiency.46 It is therefore necessary for China to improve its food safety administration system to further enhance its regulatory regime on the one hand, and to rationalize the administrative chains and procedures in food supervision on the other.",

The laws have introduced monetary remedies for consumers consisting of damages and a fine of ten times that of the commodity\u2019s value. However, the accused are liable for the fine only where evidence shows that they have produced defective products and are at fault.47 What is more outrageous is that the onus of proof is on the consumers in such cases.48 The amount of ten times the value of the goods has already been criticized as being too insignificant to be a deterrent.49 The requirement that consumers need to prove the culpability of producers in making defective foods renders it nearly impossible for the consumers to benefit from the fine, not to mention the conceivable negligible impact that the provision has on food producers.",

Among government staff of relevant departments, only those directly responsible for administrative negligence or abuse of powers that result in serious social impact may face disciplinary action.50 Criminal penalties imposed on food producers for breaches of the law are also weak. Moreover, no single criminal penalty is available to penalize delinquent public servants. The Criminal Law of China only punishes the conduct of producing and selling foods causing serious food poisoning and diseases, and the conduct of producing and selling foods mixed with toxic or harmful non-food substances.51 It can thus be observed that the scope of application of the criminal law provisions is limited to offences occurring in food production and sale. This leaves the conduct of processing, packaging, storing and transporting defective or harmful foods unpunished.52 Furthermore, the amounts of the penal fines provided in the Criminal Law are even less than those stipulated in the Food Safety Law, and are subject to a higher threshold in application.53\n",

According to a survey carried out by the National Survey Research Center at Renmin University of China in 2011, 68% of people interviewed attributed the cause of food scandals to administrative inefficiency and supervisory failure.54 In the meantime, judicial failure to rigorously implement food laws has cast a further shadow over effective law enforcement in the future. It is reported that courts are reluctant to support consumers\u2019 claims for damages up to 2 or 10 times the amount of the commodity price provided for in the Law of the People\u2019s Republic of China on the Protection of Consumer Rights and Interests 1993 and the Food Safety Law of the People\u2019s Republic of China 2009.55 Many manufacturers also promise that an amount of compensation of up to 10 times the amount of the commodity price will be paid to consumers upon violation of food safety. However, such claims are likely to be rejected by courts. Some judges insist that such an amount appears to be punitive and thus does not have legal basis in contractual relations. The stance of courts in such cases renewed the public\u2019s suspicion of judicial corruption. The worst scenario concerns events involving arrest and conviction of consumer advocates. The Zhao Lianhai case is a typical example. Zhao Lianhai was a man who became an activist after his son experienced kidney problems linked to contaminated baby formula. He was convicted of inciting public disorder by setting up a web site to help other parents with sick children share information, seek compensation, and organize protests.56\n",

This can be partly attributed to the understaffing of supervisory authorities, partly to the misfeasance, malfeasance, nonfeasance and unprofessionalism of administrative officers. It is noteworthy that administrative personnel\u2019s unsupportive attitude and behavior towards businesses has been the cause of changes in inspective practice, resulting in a switch of models from official inspection to enterprise self-inspection.73 Under the enterprise self-inspection regime, the working manner of administration is even more unprofessional. For instance, in the recycled buns case, when doing their sample inspection, the governmental inspectors, once arriving at a food factory or workshop, would only come into the administrative office and wait for the factory managerial staff to provide the samples to be examined. It is no surprise that they did not get any clues over the years.74 In one of the clenbuterol contaminated pork incidents, the problematic pigs were sold from Henan pig farms to Jiangsu Province and had to go through several checkpoints conducted by the trade bureau, health inspection station, veterinary station, etc. However, some inspectors acted as middlemen between pig sellers and slaughterhouses for a commission of RMB10 Yuan per pig, which caused wide dissemination of the contaminated pork and pork products.75\n",

It is inexcusable for administrative agencies to claim that ill-training, poor quality equipment and understaffing are the main causes for such an appalling incidence of food scandals in the country, since journalists are by no means in a position to be better trained and better equipped than food inspection agencies or police.

It is thus important to make sure that inspectors have detailed guidance and rules to follow when discharging their responsibilities. Their powers and the procedures to be followed should be well defined. Inspectors should receive up-to-date training in the new technologies used in processing and manufacturing, including what is required for the control of these technologies in order for them to function at maximum effectiveness and to assure proper performance.

Fraud in project approvals and failure to apply emission control measures are responsible for rising pollution in the country. Some professions including teachers, doctors, lawyers and those safeguarding consumptive goods are not only important to people\u2019s lifestyle and well-being and society\u2019s progress, but also play a social role in which trustworthiness is an expectation in every tradition.140 In China, these professions, because of the rampage of the unethical performance conducted by a majority of the people in the trades, have definitely failed to honor their part of social compact with society, which in turn exacerbates human rights related problems. It is a high time for China to review the ethical conduct of these key professions. The Chinese government has an obligation to protect citizens\u2019 human rights to health, access to healthy food, safe drinking water, clean air, and a healthy environment. In discharging this obligation, effective mechanisms combating corruption in various forms need to be established in order to sustain the country's social stability and economic prosperity.",
