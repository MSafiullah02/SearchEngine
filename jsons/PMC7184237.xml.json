As data regarding health problems in civilian travelers are globally comparable to those reported in deployed soldiers, this chapter will focus on the specifics of the deployed military population and its main incapacitating medical threats. The deployed military represent a special category of travelers characterized as a young, disciplined, trained, predominantly male population that is strictly selected, controlled, and regularly monitored, and that typically travels in a group accompanied by some level of medical care. Medical readiness (basically equivalent to the civilian pretravel consultation) is an overriding concern of all commanders. It is a policy-driven force health protection approach based on physical, dental, and psychological examinations with mandatory lab and/or radiologic investigations according to the service personnel's country. It includes obligatory health education sessions regarding the specific deployment-related risks and up-to-date immunizations based on the country and service's health policies (Table 36.1\nprovides information for US personnel). Any contraindication for vaccination results in ineligibility for deployment.",

As an example, the French conquest of Madagascar in 1895 resulted in approximately 6000 malaria-related deaths for <30 killed in action.6 A recent prospective study (Fig. 36.1\n) showed similar findings with NCRI, gastrointestinal, dermatologic, and respiratory disorders representing the leading causes of health issues during deployment. The same authors reported a significant burden for infectious diseases (41% of all etiologies), with ubiquitous infections in the majority of cases.7 As with civilian travelers, the use of alcohol and drugs has been associated with an increased incidence of accidents, emotional disorders, and sexually transmitted infections.8, 9, 10 Alcohol-related regulations vary according to the country of origin and country of deployment, but the authors recommend restrictions against the use of alcohol on deployment to minimize these risks. Continuing information and education, and prohibiting alcohol and drug use/abuse during rotations, should help to decrease the rates of NCRI and other alcohol and/or drug-associated medical issues.",

Tactical combat casualty care, improved protection gear and armored vehicles, deployed forward surgical teams applying damage control surgery and resuscitation, advances in transfusion (fresh frozen plasma and platelets, lyophilized plasma, whole blood transfusion), and early medical evacuation have been associated with remarkably improved outcomes for the severely injured.12, 13, 14, 15 However, the increased survival of patients sustaining severe pelvic, spinal, and extremity wounds with amputations has highlighted the essential role of rehabilitation medicine (improved prosthetics), psychiatrists, psychologists, and social workers in supporting the wounded and their families.16\n",

From its earliest use among allied forces in the Pacific campaign of World War II, adherence to malaria chemoprophylaxis has been a challenge, leading to the dictum that ensuring adherence to chemoprophylaxis is a command responsibility and not just a medical responsibility.6, 22, 23 One notable exception to this experience was the very high rate of reported adherence among US military forces deployed to Liberia as part of the Ebola response in Operation United Assistance in 2014\u20132015, with no cases occurring while deployed.24 Faced with high threat of infectious disease during the operation, the military health community provided robust, expert-level consultation on force health protection measures to all deploying forces and leveraged command support to consistently reinforce prevention policies and procedures.25\n",

Specific medication recommendations for a deployed force balance intensity of transmission, drug resistance, impact of nonadherence on efficacy, and medication cost. For example, current US military policy establishes either atovaquone-proguanil or doxycycline as first line chemoprophylaxis regimens and restricts the use of mefloquine to those both intolerant of first line agents and properly screened for contraindications.26 This entails the use, in US troops, of atovaquone-proguanil in high-threat settings, to include most of sub-Saharan Africa, and the use of doxycycline in lower threat regions such as Southwest Asia. Another example would be the French health corps policy that uses doxycycline as the only first line chemoprophylactic drug to optimize adherence.6 Use of primaquine for presumptive antirelapse therapy (PART) is typically recommended following deployments to risk areas for Plasmodium vivax and P. ovale. FHPP is constrained by Food and Drug Administration labeling to restrict the use of investigational products, which has historically been applied to dosing considerations of primaquine. Hence the US military lagged civilian practice, using 15 mg of primaquine base daily versus the current recommendation of 30 mg of base daily. Department of Defense (DOD) policies do in fact allow for a \u201cstandard of care\u201d dosage to be recommended under FHPP.27 Force-wide testing of US recruits for G6PD deficiency is standard practice.",

In addition, they are harder to treat under such circumstances.29 These environmental and lifestyle factors also facilitate superficial fungal infections that may develop in >50% of soldiers, presenting as tinea pedis, tinea cruris, tinea corporis, tinea axillae, tinea capitis, onychomycosis, and/or pityriasis versicolor.29 Due to the maceration in combat boots, feet not only pay a heavy price in terms of fungal and gram-positive cocci infections but also of other conditions such as pitted keratolysis (Corynebacterium sp.) (Fig. 36.2\n). These lower limb lesions in turn increase the risk of erysipelas and cellulitis with the potential for significant negative impact on force availability.36 Additional skin disorders include other corynebacterial infections (erythrasma and trichomycosis) and heat rash (miliaria crystallina, miliaria rubra, miliaria pustulosa, and miliaria profunda).

Enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC), Campylobacter, and Shigella have been identified as causing 38%\u201345% of diarrhea.40 Viral causes are less common but are frequent causes of outbreaks.38 Prevention is based on rapidly establishing and maintaining effective sanitation and provision of clean food and water. To reduce the operational impact of diarrhea and to avoid associated deployment complications of dehydration and heat injury, rapid, effective treatment with a single-dose antibiotic (azithromycin or a fluoroquinolone) and loperamide is typically recommended.38, 41\n",

Influenza virus is the classic respiratory scourge of the military, but other respiratory viruses such rhinoviruses, human coronaviruses, respiratory syncytial virus, parainfluenza virus, and adenoviruses are common causes of cold and flu symptoms. Pneumonia is most often caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae and influenza virus. Pneumonia epidemics due to adenovirus type 14 (Ad14) reemerged among US military recruits when a vaccine was not available. Strategies to reduce the incidence and impact of respiratory infections include an emphasis on hygiene measures (hand-washing, reduced crowding, cohorting of ill, etc.), vaccination for common pathogens (influenza, Ad14), antibiotic prophylaxis (penicillin in US training camps to reduce group A strep pharyngitis), and early diagnosis and directed treatment of infection.",
