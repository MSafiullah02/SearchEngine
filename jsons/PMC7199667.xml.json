            "text": "The gastrointestinal (GI) microbiota is a complex collection of microorganisms\n(i.e., bacteria, archaea, fungi, protozoa, and viruses). Recent molecular phylogenetic\nstudies, typically based on comparative 16S rRNA gene analysis, have revealed that the GI\ntract of mammals harbors several hundred to thousand bacterial phylotypes (Frank et al., 2007; Suchodolski et al., 2009; Handl et al.,\n2011). It is estimated that the intestine of mammals contains approximately\n1010 to 1014 microorganisms, about 10 times more than the number of\ncells composing the host body. This mutually interacting system composed of the host cells\nand the resident microbes is called the intestinal microbiome. Gut microbes play a crucial\nrole in host health. They act as a defending barrier against invading pathogens, aid in\ndigestion and energy harvest from the diet, provide nutritional support for enterocytes, and\nstimulate the development of the immune system. Molecular approaches have improved our\nunderstanding about the composition, the dynamics, and the functionality of the intestinal\necosystem in dogs and cats (Ritchie et al., 2008;\nDesai et al., 2009; Swanson et al., 2010). The composition of the intestinal microbiota can be\ninfluenced to some extent by exogenous factors, such as diet (Simpson et al., 2002; Barry et al.,\n2010; Middelbos et al., 2010). However, the\nmicrobiota is resilient to most environmental influences, returning rapidly to its\npretreatment state. Antibiotic administration leads to more profound alterations in the\nintestinal microbiome, with some bacterial groups remaining depressed for several weeks to\nmonths (Dethlefsen et al., 2008; Suchodolski et al., 2009; Gr\u00f8nvold et al., 2010). During the last few years, convincing evidence has emerged\nimplicating alterations in the composition of the intestinal microbiota to chronic\nenteropathies not only in humans, but also in dogs and cats (German et al., 2003; Inness et al., 2007;\nJaneczko et al., 2008; Craven et al., 2010a; Suchodolski et al.,\n2010). In addition, extraintestinal disorders (e.g., atopy in infants) have been,\ndue to the interactions of intestinal microbiota with the host immune system, associated\nwith GI dysbiosis (Penders et al., 2007). These\nfindings emphasize the importance of maintaining a balanced intestinal ecosystem. This\narticle will summarize recent work characterizing the intestinal microbiome of healthy cats\nand dogs, and alterations in the composition of the intestinal microbiota and innate immune\nsystem that have been identified in dogs and cats with chronic enteropathies.",

Bacterial culture is useful for\nthe detection of specific intestinal pathogens (e.g., Salmonella spp.),\nallowing for antibiotic susceptibility testing and genotyping of cultured isolates. However,\nit is now well established that culture-dependent methods are not well suited for in-depth\ncharacterization of complex environments, such as the mammalian GI tract. Limitations of\ncultivation methods include our inability to culture and correctly classify the vast\nmajority of intestinal microbes (Greetham et al.,\n2002). Molecular tools have now become the standard approach in microbial ecology\n(Figure 1) and are now increasingly used for\ncharacterization of the intestinal microbiome of dogs and cats (Suchodolski et al., 2005; Desai et al.,\n2009; Lubbs et al., 2009; Vester et al., 2009).

Differences in bacterial composition between dogs and\ncats have been suggested (Johnston et al., 1993;\nJohnston, 1999).

Cats appear to\nhave greater counts of anaerobic bacteria in their small intestine compared with dogs (Johnston et al., 1993). The distal small intestine (i.e.,\nileum) contains a more diverse microbiota and greater bacterial numbers (107\ncfu/mL).

            "text": "Molecular tools have greatly expanded our knowledge about the phylogenetic diversity within\nthe canine and feline gut. Recent studies have revealed several hundred bacterial phylotypes\nin the canine intestinal tract (Suchodolski et al.,\n2009; Swanson et al., 2010). The phyla\nFirmicutes, Bacteroidetes, Proteobacteria, Fusobacteria, and Actinobacteria constitute more\nthan 99% of all gut microbiota in dogs and cats. The remaining bacterial groups are\nrepresented by the phyla Spirochaetes, Tenericutes, Verrucomicrobia, Cyanobacteria,\nChloroflexi, and a few unclassified bacterial lineages. Generally, aerobic bacteria or\nfacultative anaerobic bacteria occur in greater abundance in the small intestine, whereas\nanaerobes predominate in the large intestine. In the stomach, mucosa-adherent\nHelicobacter spp. predominate, followed by Lactobacillus\nand Streptococcus spp., and Clostridia spp. Whereas the\nvast majority of cats and dogs harbor various Helicobacter spp. in their\nstomach, Helicobacter pylori, the clinically most important\nHelicobacter species in humans, has not been isolated from pet dogs or\ncats (Rossi et al., 2008). The proximal small\nintestine harbors approximately 10 different bacterial phyla, with Clostridia,\nLactobacillales, and Proteobacteria being most abundant (Suchodolski et al., 2009). Proteobacteria and Spirochaetes are more abundant in\nthe proximal GI tract and typically represent <1% of obtained sequences in the large\nintestine of healthy animals. Firmicutes, Bacteroides, and Fusobacteria\nappear to be the predominant bacterial groups in the large intestine. However, the reported\nabundance of these bacterial groups differs between studies. For example, percentages of\nFirmicutes range between 25 and 95% of obtained sequencing tags (Middelbos et al., 2010; Ritchie et al.,\n2010; Swanson et al., 2010; Handl et al., 2011). It is likely that these\ndiscrepancies may be due to differences in DNA extraction methods and PCR protocols between\nstudies. Actinobacteria were identified as highly abundant in fecal samples using\ncomparative chaperonin 60 gene sequence analysis and fluorescence in situ hybridization\n(Inness et al., 2007; Desai et al., 2009; Jia et al.,\n2010). This is not surprising, because it has been shown that 16S rRNA gene\napproaches with universal bacterial primers typically underestimate Actinobacteria (Ritchie et al., 2010). Bifidobacteria, members of the\nActinobacteria appear to be less abundant in cats and dogs compared with humans (Inness et al., 2007; Jia\net al., 2010).",

Although animals can be raised under germ-free conditions, several morphological and\nimmunological differences between germ-free and conventionally raised animals indicate that\ncommensal microbes contribute significantly to the development and maintenance of gut\nstructure. For example, germ-free rodents have an altered epithelial architecture (e.g.,\nthinner lamina propria, reduced number of Peyer's patches, and lymphoid follicles) and have\na reduced turnover time of epithelial cells (Hooper et al.,\n2001). Dogs raised germ-free show similar growth rates as conventionally raised\ndogs, but they demonstrate an underdeveloped lymphoid system and have decreased\nimmunoglobulin concentrations (Cohn and Heneghan,\n1991). However, germ-free dogs are capable of mounting an adequate immune response\nto antigenic stimulation. Wound healing and blood-clotting mechanisms in germ-free-raised\ndogs are similar as in conventionally raised animals (Cohn\nand Heneghan, 1991). The intestine of germ-free dogs is characterized by thinner\nvilli and a reduction in both the lamina propria and mucosal surface area (Thompson and Trexler, 1971). Interestingly, surgically\ninduced strangulation obstruction of the small intestine and surgically induced bile\nperitonitis did not lead to death in germ-free-raised dogs, whereas conventionally raised\ndogs showed 100% mortality, emphasizing the role of intestinal bacteria for the severity of\nthe disease (Cohn and Heneghan, 1991).",

The proposed\nmechanisms include the competition for oxygen, nutrients, mucosal adhesion sites, and the\ncreation of a physiologically restrictive environment for nonresident bacterial species\n(e.g., secretion of antimicrobials, alterations in gut pH, production of hydrogen sulfide;\nKanauchi et al., 2005). Therefore, young dogs and\ncats with colonization resistance not yet fully established are typically more susceptible\nto invading pathogens (e.g., Campylobacterjejuni). The\nsterile GI tract of newborn puppies and kittens is colonized within hours after birth by\nbacteria present in the birth canal and surrounding environment. After 24 h, aerobic and\nanaerobic counts exceed 108 cfu/g of intestinal content (Buddington, 2003). Aerobic and anaerobic bacteria are at similar numbers\nin the first weeks after birth, but the proportions of anaerobes are greater during\nadulthood (Buddington, 2003). The presence of\nintestinal bacteria in early life is necessary to establish oral tolerance to commensal\nbacteria and food antigens, to prevent onset of an inappropriate immune response, which may\nlead to chronic GI inflammation (Bauer et al., 2006).\nMicrobes interact and stimulate the immune host system, as has been shown by administration\nof specific bacterial strains as probiotics in dogs and cats.

Gastrointestinal disease may develop due to\ncolonization with transient pathogens, due to an overgrowth by opportunistic resident\nbacterial groups, or due to an altered cross-talk between the intestinal innate immune\nsystem and the commensal microbiota. Invasion with specific pathogens may profoundly disturb\nthe intestinal epithelium by altering the structure of the GI mucosa. Enteric pathogens can\npenetrate into the submucosa and Peyer's patches, or produce exo- or enterotoxins that alter\nenterocyte function. Enterotoxins produced by pathogenic bacteria (e.g., enterotoxigenic\nClostridium perfringens, and toxigenic Clostridium\ndifficile) can stimulate mucosal fluid secretions, whereas villus effacement and\nloss of surface area will diminish mucosal absorptive capacity, resulting in diarrhea (Marks and Kather, 2003). A dysfunction of the mucosal\nbarrier can lead to an increase in intestinal permeability and clinically significant\nbacterial translocation. Intestinal pathogens that have been associated with acute or\nchronic diarrhea in dogs and cats include enterotoxigenic C. perfringens,\ntoxigenic C. difficile, Salmonella, Escherichia\ncoli (i.e., enteropathogenic, enterotoxigenic, enterohemorrhagic, and\nenteroinvasive), and specific Campylobacter spp. (i.e.,\nCampylobacter jejuni; Olson and\nSandstedt, 1987; Marks et al., 2002; Sancak et al., 2004).",

Small intestinal dysbiosis is a common disorder that is suspected to\nbe caused by an intestinal dysbiosis. This disorder commonly has been referred to as small\nintestinal bacterial overgrowth or antibiotic-responsive diarrhea, as it has been previously\nsuggested that affected dogs harbor increased bacterial counts (i.e., >105\ncfu/ml) in their duodenum (Batt et al., 1983).\nPatients respond favorably to antibiotics (e.g., tylosin), but diarrhea usually returns\nshortly after cessation of therapy (Westermarck et al.,\n2005). Recent studies found no correlation between increased duodenal bacterial\ncounts and disease status of dogs (German et al.,\n2003). Failure of host control mechanisms that regulate bacterial counts in the\nsmall intestine may lead to more general changes in bacterial populations, causing a\ndysbiosis in the small intestine. These regulatory mechanisms include intestinal motility\nand antimicrobial substances in pancreatic and biliary secretions. Therefore, spontaneous\nchanges in GI motility or procedures that alter the architecture of the intestine (e.g.,\nsurgical creation of intestinal loops and resection of the ileocolic valve) can predispose\nanimals to intestinal dysbiosis (Thompson et al.,\n1998). In exocrine pancreatic insufficiency, the defective pancreas is not capable\nof secreting antimicrobial peptides, and exocrine pancreatic insufficiency is often\nassociated with an increase or compositional changes in small intestinal microbiota (Williams et al., 1987; Simpson et al., 1990). These changes may lead to various mechanisms that\nnegatively affect the function of the GI tract. Examples are the dehydroxylation of fatty\nacids leading to impaired fat absorption, alterations in the intestinal barrier with\nincreased intestinal permeability, the destruction of brush border enzymes and epithelial\ncarrier proteins, and competition for substrates leading to nutrient and vitamin\nmalabsorption (e.g., vitamin B12; Rutgers et al.,\n1993, 1996; Melgarejo et al., 2000).",

The currently proposed pathogenic mechanism behind IBD\ninvolves an abnormal interaction between commensal intestinal microbiota and the intestinal\nimmune system in genetically predisposed individuals (Packey\nand Sartor, 2009). For example, genome-wide association studies in humans with\nCrohn's disease have revealed at least 33 susceptibility genes, and many of these genes are\nassociated with a defective bacterial killing of the innate immune system (e.g.,\nnucleotide-binding oligomerization domain containing protein 2, also known as caspase\nactivation and recruitment domain 15; Packey and Sartor,\n2009). The microbiota is implicated in human IBD because inflammation is present in\ngut compartments with the greatest bacterial counts. Studies in engineered animal models\nwith susceptibility for inflammation indicate that IBD develops only if bacteria are present\n(Packey and Sartor, 2009). The cause-effect\nrelationship between microbial alterations and inflammation is not well determined. It is\nsuspected that intestinal inflammation causes a dysbiosis toward gram-negative bacteria\n(i.e., Proteobacteria), and a depletion of commensal bacterial groups may lead to a reduced\ncapability of the intestinal microbiome to downregulate an aberrant intestinal immune\nresponse, leading to a perturbation of intestinal inflammation (Sokol et al., 2008). New hypotheses indicate that Campylobacter\njejuni and Salmonella gastroenteritis trigger changes in mucosal\narchitecture and in the innate immune system, which diminish the colonization resistance of\nresident microbes (Stecher and Hardt, 2008). In human\nIBD, decreases in the phyla Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes, and increases in Proteobacteria\nare commonly observed. Furthermore, reductions in the diversity of\nClostridium clusters XIVa and IV (i.e., Ruminococcaceae,\nFaecalibacterium prausnitzii, and C. coccoides\nsubgroups) in IBD patients indicate that these bacterial groups, important producers of\nSCFA, play an important role in maintenance of GI health (Sokol et al., 2008; Packey and Sartor,\n2009).",

Furthermore, recent studies have revealed\ndifferential immune responses in dogs and cats with chronic enteropathies and have also\nidentified underlying genetic defects in the host innate immunity. Together, these findings\nclearly implicate an interaction of the innate immune system and commensal intestinal\nmicrobiota in the pathogenesis of canine and feline enteropathies.",
