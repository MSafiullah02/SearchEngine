The sharp pang of this pandemic (2019-nCoV) is exponentially sweeping across the world and is triggering chaos, fear, anxiety, and stress among the people (Montemurro, 2020) . It may cause pernicious impacts on cognitive functions, and also inflict extensive neurological disruption (Wu et al. 2020) . By April 7, 2020, more than one million (1,383,436) persons have been globally infected due to the convergence of this uncontrollable infectious disease. Most of the global population has been depressed and threatened due to the exponential growth of infection and the increasing number of fatalities (COVID-19 coronavirus pandemic, 2020) . To avoid the mass spreading of this pandemic virus, the decision regarding nationwide lockdown has been taken. No doubt, this will save the masses of life. However, this lockdown is also creating chaos and huge difficulties for the people (Sharma et al., 2020) .",

Furthermore, due to the dilemma of lockdown and to maintain the social distancing, the authorities have instructed the teaching fraternity to take their classes online (Choudhury et al., 2020) . During this pandemic, it is very tough to prepare and deliver the quality lectures to the students and the situation gets worse when the teaching is online as most of the teachers have not been trained for the effective use of web resources for teaching. Additionally, the teachers who are specialized in conventional teaching found it more difficult to cope with online methods. Moreover, the level of frustration during this pandemic would be on the higher side for the old-aged and psychologically-disordered teachers as they are more vulnerable to contamination. The liability of online classes will further intensify the stress as they are not comfortable in using electronic gadgets and online resources. Above all, some of the students are not serious in online teaching as the teachers have negligible control over students in online teaching. Additionally, the teachers residing in the remote areas are more frustrated and depressed because due to unavailability or poor internet connection, they are not able to complete their tasks (Zhang, 2020) .",

The teachers employed in small-scale institutes don't get the proper salary and to manage the daily needs of their family they normally indulge in extra works like tuition or part-time job (evening shifts). This pandemic has shut down all the sources of their income. Additionally, the level of stress and frustration is on the peak for the guest lecturers as they were paid on the basis of the lectures taken per day. The interruption in research activities during this outbreak is also being a reason of stress for the teaching community. Due to the lockdown of colleges, universities the teachers and students (particularly Science faculty) are not able to use the facilities of their laboratories. Moreover, most of the teachers are not able to access online journals as they have institutional web access only.",

The massive transmission of the fake news over social sites (Whatsapp, Twitter, Facebook) and media has created chaos and stressful atmosphere for the students. The scary atmosphere is affecting the concentration level and the learning ability of the students. The training students (MCA/MBA/B.Tech) who have joined their internship in different companies are not able to get the hand-on experience of the live projects. Some of the research scholars (Life and Applied Sciences) who have been carrying out their experiments in their institutional labs for the last couple of weeks and were about to finish their studies feel more frustrated as they have to re-conduct their experiments due to this lockdown. Furthermore, different kinds of examinations have been postponed due to this zoonotic virus and there is complete uncertainty about the examination policies i.e. how and when it will be conducted. In addition to the regular examination, most of the competitive examination has also been aborted or postponed for which students were preparing for the last couple of months or even a year. The postponement of the examinations is also causing frustration and stress among the students. These different kinds of tensions disrupt the sleep time of the students which eventually decreases the body's immunity and hence makes them more susceptible to infection.",

Additionally, all educational institutes need to periodically organize the workshops related to the use of online learning and teaching.
