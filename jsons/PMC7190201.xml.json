Another impact of synonymous mutations is the change in tRNA adaptation index (tAI) [6], a terminology which described the tRNA availability of a codon.",

Codons with higher tRNA concentrations tend to have higher translation rates. These codons are regarded as optimized codons or optimal codons [7, 8]. It is intuitive to consider that the change in tAI caused by synonymous mutations should undergo selection force. This selection is certainly independent of amino acid sequences because they do not alter the amino acids. Although this notion is verified in a limited number of animal species, the genome-wide situation (selection patterns on synonymous mutations) in plant kingdom remains largely unknown. What we currently know is the following messages and knowledges of the codon bias phenomenon in plant species.",

A study in the ancient gymnosperm species Gingko biloba found higher frequency for A/T ending codons than G/C ending codons, but meanwhile it found that the highly expressed genes and those genes involved in environmental adaptation tend to use C/G ending codons, suggesting that the Gingko genome is dominated by natural selection [9]. Similarly, in angiosperms, it was found that the G/C ending codons were optimal (e.g. in Arabidopsis thaliana) and that there was enrichment of these G/C ending codons in monocots compared to dicots [10]. Another study in four non-grass monocot species also proposed that the G/C ending codons are optimal and that this preference is not likely caused by mutation biases [11]. Nevertheless, a recent study on four cotton species found the pattern that the pyrimidine-enriched codons (especially those ending with T) have higher frequency in the CDSs [12]. Meanwhile, it was also declared that the GC3 (GC content at the 3rd codon position) method was not always suitable for evolutionary comparisons at different scales [13] although CAI is positively correlated with GC3 [11]. From another aspect, the strength of codon bias could be largely different in different species. Previous studies comparing rice and Arabidopsis discovered that codon bias is stronger in housekeeping genes [14], and that the preference for increasing CDS GC content is stronger in rice [15].",

We show our data that the median distance between the nearby tAI-up and tAI-down mutations is less than 90 bp (Additional file 1: Figure S7). However, for recombination hotspots, the \u201cunit\u201d for recombination should be \u201cKb\u201d or longer. If recombination bias does play a role, it should equally affect the tAI-up and tAI-down mutations, which means that the tAI-up mutations near the hotspots should have higher allele frequencies than the tAI-up mutations far from recombination hotspots. In other words, under recombination bias, the high frequency mutations should be clustered and the low frequency mutations should be clustered, respectively. Take a \u201ctAI-up\u201d mutation for instance, if its nearest mutation is also a \u201ctAI-up\u201d mutation, we name it \u201cup near up\u201d.

The observed GC3 is the relic of natural selection and it does not directly tell the functional relevance. We associated the pure genomic features with the potential function. Since 23 out of 32 high tAI codons are G/C-ending and 21 out of 29 codons are A/T-ending, our study has found a putative reason (higher translation rate) for the positive selection for optimal codons. Meanwhile, GC-biased gene conversion would mimic the pattern under natural selection for transnational efficiency, which means that gene conversion could lead to an overestimation of the optimality of C/G-to-A/T mutations [28]. Since the optimal codons in maize is biased toward C/G-ending ones, one cannot rule out the higher frequency of preferred codons is due to GC-biased gene conversion. For example, two derived mutation sites, T-to-C at site1 and G-to-A at site2, mean that in the population there are T and C alleles at site1, and G and A alleles at site2. If DAFsite1 > DAFsite2, then we would claim that T-to-C should be more favorable than G-to-A mutation according to our theory. However, this might also be caused by the biased gene conversion towards C allele at site1 and towards G allele at site2. We find a way to exclude this bias if we test our pattern among the A/T-ending codons alone or among the C/G-ending codons alone. We retrieved all A-to-T or T-to-A mutations, the tAI-up mutations have a median DAF of 0.388 and those tAI-down mutations have a median DAF of 0.301 (p-value = 2.9e-4, Wilcoxon rank sum test). Among all C-to-G or G-to-C mutations, the tAI-up mutations have a median DAF of 0.407 and those tAI-down mutations have a median DAF of 0.303 (p-value = 6.3e-8, Wilcoxon rank sum test). The A-T switches and C-G switches ensure that the comparison between the bi-allelic site is fair and not affect by the biased gene conversion. So that our conclusion is robust.",

In fact, CAI is a parameter used at the gene level (geometric mean of wij values described below). At codon level the parameters are RSCU (relative synonymous codon usage) or wij, which is defined as the number of a codon divided by the maximum number among its synonymous codon(s). However, a mutation that increases the wij value of a codon would definitely increase the CAI of its host gene. Thus, define \u201ca synonymous mutation that increases/decreases CAI\u201d as the synonymous mutation that increases/decreases the frequency of the codon and we still use the term CAI to describe the codon level wij value.",
