Like other coronaviruses, five major ORFs are typically arranged in the order of replicase (rep), spike (S), envelope (E), membrane (M) glycoproteins and nucleocapsid (N) protein (Rota et al., 2003). During virion assembly, N protein binds to a specific packaging signal on the viral RNA, leading to the formation of a helical nucleocapsid. Subsequently, the helical nucleocapsid interacts with the M and E proteins to form a nucleocapsid complex, resulting in budding through the membrane (Siddell, 1995).",

Among all structural proteins of SARS-CoV, the N protein has the highest hydrophilicity and pI. It is the only SARS-CoV protein which contains no cysteine residue. Thus, it contains no disulphide bonds. These features suggest that the N protein may be less stable than other structural proteins of SARS-CoV (Wang et al., 2004). Based on the available information from other coronaviruses, the N protein has been implicated in a variety of functions, including genomic RNA replication (Compton et al., 1987), subgenomic RNA transcription (Stohlman et al., 1988) and translation (Ulmanen et al., 1976).",

The P. pastoris expression system is one of the promising methods for the production of expressed proteins, although at present limited viral proteins have been expressed using this system (Cereghino and Cregg, 2000). We have cloned the SARS-CoV N gene into the P. pastoris expression vector pPIC9 and achieved efficient expression of the N protein to a level of 3000 mg/l, which is higher than the formerly reported eukaryotic-expressed N protein (526 mg/l; Liu et al., 2004). In addition, different methods including MS, CD, FL were used to characterize this eukaryotic-expressed N protein. The E. coli-expressed N protein was obtained previously in our laboratory and a polyclonal antibody against this N protein was obtained from rabbit (data not shown). Using the polyclonal antibody raised against bacterially expressed N protein, the yeast-expressed N protein was detected (Fig. 1B). The N protein expression level reached its peak at 84 h post-methanol induction (Fig. 1A). This is consistent with the report by Liu et al. (2004). The MW of the expressed N protein was estimated to be 46.8 kDa. The slight difference in the MW could be due to post-translational modifications or computational errors. The MS results showed complete matching of amino acid sequence from 46% of the trypsin-digested peptides. These digested peptides, ranged in size from 0.8 to 2.4 kDa, were sequenced (Fig. 2B) and the largest peptide sequenced has 36 amino acids (Fig. 2A). This is in accordance with the published amino acid sequence of the N protein (Ruan et al., 2003).",

The CD results suggest the P. pastoris-expressed N protein forms a \u03b2-sheet structure and is folded under optimum pH in solution. The FL data showed that the N protein was denatured in the presence of 5 M GdmCl or 10 M urea, or at pH 2.0. These results coincide with an independent report on the characterization of the SARS-CoV N protein expressed from bacteria (Wang et al., 2004). Through the use of structural biology platforms, such as NMR or X-ray crystallography, structural differences of the N protein expressed from yeast and bacteria can be compared that can, in turn, provide insights on the conformation of the N protein.",
