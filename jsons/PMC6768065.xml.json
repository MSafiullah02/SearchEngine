In healthcare environments, N95 FFRs and surgical\nmasks (SMs) are the most commonly used devices to prevent transmission of infectious\ndiseases.(1,2) N95 FFRs are certified by NIOSH in accordance with Title\n42 of the U.S. Code of Federal Regulations.(3) The letter \u201cN\u201d stands for\nnon-oil-resistance, and the number \u201c95\u201d denotes the filter efficiency of at least 95% when\nthe filter is challenged with NaCl aerosols having a mass median aerodynamic particle\ndiameter of 300 nm (the most penetrating particle size, MPPS, for mechanical filters) at a\nconstant flow of 85 L/min.(4) Presently, the vast majority of FFRs are manufactured\nutilizing electrostatic fibers, which feature much smaller MPPS: 30 to 100\nnm.(5\u201312) The latter range includes\nmany viral species. SMs are not subject to NIOSH filter certification approval; instead they\nare regulated by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Previous studies have shown\nthat the filter efficiency for SMs is much lower than that for N95 FFRs.(5,13\u201315)",

The FLTF ratios obtained for the N95 FFR\nwere generally higher than those for the SM for all tested breathing frequencies and MIFs,\nprimarily because of the higher efficiency of the N95 filter.
