In 29 (11.5%) patients, baseline QRS was more than 120 ms. The baseline JTc and the maximal \u2206JTc were similar between patients with and without QRS>120 ( Table 2) .

The predictors of extreme JTc prolongation > 410 ms included baseline JTc and Creatinine (Supplementary Table 1 ).

QTc was calculated from the QT and RR intervals using the Bazetts' formula. The QRS interval was measured from the onset of the Q wave, or R wave if no Q wave was visible, to the J point. JTc interval was calculated by subtracting the QRS duration from the QTc interval (QTc -QRS). For quality assurance, QT measurements were validated by a senior Student's t-test if samples had normal distributions, Mann-Whitney U test if samples did not have normal distributions, or paired samples t-test for paired samples. Two sample hypothesis testing for categorical variables was performed using Fisher's",

In our study, we observed QTc prolongation in parallel with increasing HY/AZ exposure, which partially shortened after medication cessation. For example, the proportion of patients with QTc > 500 ms was 20% at day 4 after completion of HY/AZ therapy and declined to 10% one day later. Baseline QTc/JTc, Creatinine level and co-administration of Amiodarone were significant predictors of extreme QTc/JTc prolongation and \u2206QTc > 60 ms. We show that the effect on the QTc was driven entirely by prolonging the repolarization and regardless of QRS, as evident by the corresponding JTc prolongation. In this regard, it is worth mentioning that there is limited data regarding high arrhythmic risk markers in patients with QRS >120 ms and QTC prolongation. We utilized QTc change by > 60 ms as a marker, a cutoff that was initially proposed in an algorithm designed to automatically detect QTc prolongation taking into account the normal variation in QTc17 . In addition we utilized a cutoff of JTc>410 ms as the correlate of QTc>500 ms for patients with wide QRS, based on the deduction of the mean QRS value we found in our patients with normal QRS, which was 90 ms. Previous information on the potential proarrhythmic effect of the combination Chloroquine/Hydroxychloroquine and Azithromycin is the risk for drug induced TdP is substantially higher in hospitalized patients. This, is due to greater prevalence of other risk factors for TdP, including older age, presence HY/AZ played an important pro-arrhythmic role. However, in view of its relatively short coupling interval, it is not clear if this is true TdP or a polymorphic VT triggered by Azithromycin via increased sodium current. The alarming proportion of COVID-19 patients developing extreme QT prolongation with HY/AZ therapy in our study can be explained by the specific characteristics of this population, which includes older age, greater prevalence of underlying and acute renal failure and co-administration of additional QT prolonging medications, particularly Amiodarone.Recently published guidance statements addressing QTc surveillance and arrhythmic risk in COVID-19 patients are based on LQTS risk stratification principals and include and JTc < 350 ms. Additionally, it is important to consider that even careful monitoring of the QT interval may only partially mitigate the risk for TdP. This is because arrhythmia often occurs in the setting of sudden, intermittent changes in the R-R interval, such as when PVCs, APCs or pauses occur. In these cases, TdP can present even if the QTc in only mildly prolonged at baseline30 . We therefore suggest that individual risk/benefit assessment should be applied before treating with HY/AZ.Hydroxychloroquine, which is approximately 20 days. This finding requires special attention when considering discharging patients receiving HY/AZ or if outpatient treatment with HY/AZ is planned.",
