The effect size was 1.20 and the power was 80%, with a 1-tailed significance level of .05.20 Before randomization, we asked the physical therapists, physicians, and special educators of 7 medical centers, teaching hospitals, and schools in northern Taipei to help recruit the children with spastic diplegia who met the inclusion criteria; 26 children (16 boys, 10 girls) were referred to us. The inclusion criteria of this study were as follows: (1) age between 5 and 12 years old; (2) spastic diplegia; (3) the GMFCS10 level I or II; (4) able to stand up from a chair independently and maintain standing for more than 5 seconds without falling; (5) able to follow verbal instructions; (6) without obvious limitation in the passive range of motion of lower extremities; (7) able to attend physical therapy (PT) treatment at least once a week before and during this study while keeping up with regular treatment programs; (8) had not received any strength-training program in the past 3 months before the study; and (9) parental commitment to allow participation without altering current therapy or activity. Exclusion criteria were: (1) have orthopedic intervention, selective dorsal rhizotomy, or botulinum toxin injection to the lower extremities within 6 months; and (2) orthopedic problems or medical conditions that prevented children from participating in the exercises. Of 26 children eligible for this study, 24 participated (fig 1). All parents of the participants signed consent forms that were approved by the Human Subjects Review Committee at National Taiwan University Hospital, Taiwan. The children were stratified by their GMFCS level (I or II) and age (\u22658y or <8y) and then randomly allocated to either the experimental or the control group.",

The testing procedures of the loaded STS test are described as follows. At the beginning, participants did general warm-up exercises for 5 minutes. Then the tester demonstrated STS movements. Chair height has been identified as 1 factor to influence STS performance in children with CP.25 Therefore, the starting position of each child was standardized with hip flexion at 90\u00b0, knee flexion at 105\u00b0 (full extension was defined as 0\u00b0), feet parallel, ankle dorsiflexion at 15\u00b0, trunk erect, and hands on waist or crossing the chest. During testing, the child was asked to stand up 2 times at a comfortable speed and with symmetrical hip strategy to the defined standing position, which required the child\u2019s trunk and lower extremities being fully extended. The hip strategy of the STS is that the child flexes his/her hip and moves the trunk forward until the shoulder is above the knee joint, and then the child stands up. The child was asked to sit down after standing for 2 seconds. The instruction was \u201cStand up without moving your feet and waving your arms at your comfortable speed, hold this standing position for 2 seconds, and then sit down slowly. No falling. If you try but cannot stand up, just let us know. It is OK.\u201d Subsequent to tester\u2019s demonstration, the child practiced STS 3 to 4 times from light load to moderate load at a comfortable speed. During the loaded STS test, the weights were added into the body vest initially at a load equaling 30% of the body weight of the subject being tested. Based on the ease of performing STS movements, the following trial\u2019s load (increase or decrease by 0.5 to 4kg each trial) was determined. All children took a break of at least 2 minutes between test trials. The weight that the child could carry in the body vest and stand up only once was defined as the 1-RM STS of that child. The data were discarded if subjects were: (1) losing balance; (2) standing up with an obviously asymmetrical posture during test; (3) unable to maintain a standing position for 2 seconds after standing; (4) swaying their trunk back and forth several times to initiate the task of standing up; or (5) sitting down abruptly without good control. The interrater reliability of the loaded STS test for the tester was established before the beginning of the research (ICC=.94).7\n",

The loaded STS exercise program started with 5 to 10 minute warm-up activities for each session. In addition to active movements of lower extremities, the warm-up included stretching of hip adductors, ankle plantarflexors, hamstring muscles, and lumbar extensors. After warming up, the child then performed STS 10 times with a body vest at 20% of 1-RM STS load. After a 1 to 2 minute rest, the child performed STS with the load at 50% of 1-RM STS repeatedly without stopping until fatigue. The height of the chair that the child sat in and performed the loaded STS exercise at home was similar to that used for the loaded STS test. Caregivers were asked to encourage the child to perform as many repetitions as possible. After the child rested for another 2 to 3 minutes, the child performed STS activities again for 10 times with 20% of 1-RM STS weight. Cooling down exercises, similar to warm-up exercises, were performed at the end of the loaded STS exercise.

The trainer also educated caregivers to motivate child\u2019s compliance for the exercise program. On average, each child took 20 to 30 minutes to complete 1 session at home.",

            "text": "The present study showed that the loaded STS exercise could not significantly improve the gait speed and knee extensor strength when compared with the control group. The effects of the muscle strengthening program on the walking speed were controversial in the previous studies.5, 6, 31 Buchner et al42 proposed a theory that there was a curvilinear relationship between gait speed and muscle strength. The benefit of a muscle strengthening program on gait speed depends on the target group. Only those whose muscle strength was less than the demand of the walking task can have benefits from the strengthening program. The children in the present study had mild CP, and their muscle weakness problem may not have been severe enough to impair the gait speed. Therefore, the gait speed did not improve significantly after the loaded STS exercise. The loaded STS exercise is an isotonic contraction, but the maximum knee extensor strength was tested by isometric contraction in this study. Specificity of the strengthening program may be able to explain the ineffectiveness of the loaded STS exercise on the knee extensor strength. The isotonic muscle strengthening of knee extensors increased mainly the isotonic muscle strength.43\n",

Most children (80%) reported pressure on the shoulders from the body vest during the loaded STS exercise; however, no pain or injury was reported due to the training. In the present study, the withdrawn children were older than the participant children. The heavier homework load at the senior class of the elementary school may be one of the reasons to cause the interruption of a follow-up or intervention program. However, the age of the children did not significantly correlate with the home-exercise frequency and scores of the outcome measures and the motor severities of the withdrawn children were similar to the participant children. Therefore, the results of this study might be generalized to the children with mild spastic CP.",

However, in general, children of the control group received PT services more frequently than the experiment group. The treatment number and the effects of PT services would more likely have represented an advantage in favor of the children in the control group. Therefore, the favorable results in the experimental group could not be explained by this attribute. Second, the duration of the follow-up was not sufficient. The immediate effect was positive. It would be interesting to see if the positive effects observed in this study are maintained longitudinally. Third, this is a single-blind study, and children and their parents were not kept blind to the treatment condition. Therefore, children of the experiment group may be psychologically encouraged to perform better in the post-training test. Finally, only children with limited severity and diagnosis participated in this study. Therefore, future studies are needed to investigate the long-term effects of the loaded STS exercise for children with various severities of CP or with other disabilities.",
