            "text": "Over the past four decades, information from different lines of scientific inquiry has improved our understanding of antibody-mediated mechanisms that modulate severity of infections by diverse microorganisms. Independent studies of pathogenesis of cellular and host responses to acute and chronic human and animal infectious diseases have generated evidence that cross-linking of immune complexes with Fc\u03b3 receptors increases cellular infection, contributing to disease severity by a mechanism we call intrinsic antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) of infection. Intrinsic ADE is distinct from extrinsic ADE, whereby complexes of infectious agents with non-neutralising antibodies lead to an increased number of infected cells. Hawkes1 made early observations in studies of the neutralisation of Murray Valley encephalitis virus by use of the serum-dilution, virus-constant method. Chick embryo fibroblast monolayers exposed to virus mixed with high dilutions of chicken antisera had more plaques than did those exposed to virus alone.1 In follow-up studies,2 this finding seemed to result from antibody stabilisation of infectivity by the Murray Valley encephalitis virus. A different explanation emerged when sequential infections with dengue viruses resulted in dengue haemorrhagic fever.3 When monocytes and macrophages were identified as the main hosts of dengue infection, ADE was implicated.4, 5 Infection with the Murray Valley encephalitis virus was increased by ADE in the 2% of functional chicken macrophages identified in chick embryo fibroblasts. Because of the conformational requirement that Fc receptors and Fc\u03b3 termini must be of the same phylogenetic class, ADE in chick embryo fibroblasts was reported only when Murray Valley encephalitis virus antibodies were raised in chickens, not in mammals.6, 7\n",

Interleukin 10 also has a potent ability to suppress the antigen-presentation capacity of antigen-presenting cells. However, interleukin 10 is not always immunosuppressive.

            "text": "Interleukin 10 has important roles in the regulation of immune responses and can also increase host susceptibility to intracellular infections. In a mouse model of cutaneous leishmaniasis, susceptibility to L major is associated with Th2 responses. CD4 T cells from susceptible BALB/c mice produce interleukins 4 and 10 when infected with L major, whereas CD4 T cells from resistant C57BL/6 mice express interferon \u03b3 and interleukin 2.19 The transient depletion of CD4 cells or the in-vivo neutralisation of interleukin 4 in BALB/c mice promotes death of intracellular parasites and recovery from leishmanial lesions. Interleukin 4 is not the only determinant of susceptibility, however, because susceptible BALB/c mice that do not express interleukin 10 are fully resistant to infection.20 Furthermore, in people in whom the Th1 to Th2 dichotomy is not as pronounced, interleukin 10 seems to be a major inducer of susceptibility. In people with visceral leishmaniasis, interleukin 10 titres in plasma directly correlate with disease severity.21 Interleukin 10 is found in lymph nodes taken from patients with visceral leishmaniasis.11 Furthermore, PBMCs from patients with acute visceral leishmaniasis respond to stimulation with leishmania lysate by producing interleukin 10 mRNA. When added to PBMCs, interleukin 10 suppresses production of interferon \u03b3 and interleukin 2, whereas, after treatment with anti-interleukin 10, PBMCs from patients with acute visceral leishmaniasis have a substantial increase in proliferative response to leishmania lysate. Results of in-vitro studies of peritoneal and bone marrow macrophages infected with Leishmania species show that the intracellular killing of this organism by macrophages activated by the classic pathway can be inhibited by treatment with exogenous interleukin 1022, 23 or by endogenous macrophage production of interleukin 10.22\n",

Ligation of macrophage Fc\u03b3 receptors produces a rapid and enhanced activation of two mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs): extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) and p38.43 The activation of ERK leads to the phosphorylation of serine 10 on histone H3 on the gene encoding interleukin 10, increasing the accessibility of the promoter to transcription factors generated in response to p38 activation (figure 1\n). Activation of both MAPKs is needed for interleukin-10 synthesis. In addition to ERK activation, an inflammatory stimulus, such as low-molecular-weight hyaluronic acid from the extracellular matrix, is needed. The combination of these two signals results in the superinduction of interleukin 10.44 Macrophages that do not have Fc\u03b3 receptors, or macrophages treated with an inhibitor of spleen tyrosine kinase (which is activated after Fc\u03b3-receptor ligation) do not activate ERK and fail to produce interleukin 10 after infection with Leishmania species amastigotes.44\n",

Although studies on resistance to tuberculosis have focused on T-cell immunity, C57BL/6 mice deficient in inhibitory Fc\u03b3 receptor IIB have improved bacterial control and diminished pathological changes at 30 days but not 20 days after aerosol challenge with M tuberculosis.46 Mice deficient in Fc\u03b3 receptor IIB have increased production of the p40 subunit of interleukin 12. Interleukins 12 and 23 have the p40 subunit in common and both promote polarisation of naive CD4 T cells into Th1 effectors.47 Treatment of human macrophages with exogenous interleukin 12 combined with blockade of interleukin 27 reduced the burden of mycobacterial infection.48 These infections were characterised by large protective interferon-\u03b3 responses that coincided with increased activation of macrophages. In human beings, high concentrations of interleukin 10 are related to the suppression of host defence mechanisms and exacerbation of infection.49 In a model of reactivation tuberculosis, the presence of macrophage-derived interleukin 10 in the lungs of infected transgenic mice enables Th1 cells to efficiently express effector functions and secrete sufficient interferon \u03b3 to induce activation of macrophages by the classic pathway, characterised by the expression of inducible nitric oxide synthase (NOS2) and interferon-\u03b3 inducible protein member 1 (IRGM1; formerly LRG-47).50 However, mycobacteria survived and successfully proliferated within mouse macrophages with interleukin-10 production under control of a human CD68 promoter. Macrophage-derived interleukin 10 seems to override interferon-\u03b3-dependent activation of macrophages by the classic pathway and other effector mechanisms against M tuberculosis by inducing an alternatively activated phenotype. So far, the specific contribution of M tuberculosis\u2013IgG antibody complexes towards modulation of infections in model systems is unknown.",

This pathway of infection also suppressed an innate dengue virus mediator, nitric oxide radicals, by disrupting the transcription of the NOS2 gene transcription factor, IRF-1.

Mature dendritic cells secreted interferon \u03b2 coincident with peak ADE. Immature dendritic cells are readily infected by dengue virus alone, a process efficiently mediated by the attachment molecule dendritic cell-specific intercellular adhesion molecule-3-grabbing nonintegrin (DC-SIGN).106 Monocytes secreted interleukin 10 during ADE infection at the same serum dilution that produced peak virus (Marovich MA, unpublished).

Three single nucleotide polymorphisms at the 5\u2032 flanking region of interleukin 10 (position \u22121082 A/G, \u2212819 C/T, and \u2212592 C/A) were studied.

ADE might be an important contributing factor in the pathogenesis of this disease.

Passive transfer of virus-specific antibody at the peak of viral replication results in foci of necrosis around virus-infected cells, a reaction thought to be due to complement-mediated cytolysis.60 Infectious immune complexes result in increased infection of mink peritoneal macrophages.61 In one study, inoculation of an experimental killed Aleutian disease virus vaccine did not produce detectable neutralising antibodies, although eight of ten of vaccinated mink, but no control animals, developed the disease on challenge with live virus.60\n",

There are two prototype strains of PRRS virus (European and North American) that cause similar clinical symptoms but are distinct viral genotypes whose genomes diverge by about 40%.56, 117, 118 The genetic variation among the viruses varies geographically, increasing the difficulty of vaccine development.119 For reasons not understood, disease presentation varies between one herd and another. For every three herds exposed to PRRS, for the first exposure, one herd will show no recognisable disease, the second might show mild disease, and the third will show moderate to severe disease: the better the health status of the herd, the less severe the disease.117 Evidence exists that PRRS virus mutates as it multiplies, leading to some strains that are highly virulent and some that are not.117, 118 PRRS virus has a particular affinity for macrophages, particularly those in the lungs.56, 120, 121 The virus multiplies in macrophages and kills these cells. PRRS virus infections are often chronic and, once a herd is infected, the virus tends to remain present and active indefinitely.56\n",

Hence, the enhancing effect of virus\u2013antibody complexes might start once the Fc portion is engaged with the Fc receptor, which in turn switches on the negative regulatory innate immune response.
