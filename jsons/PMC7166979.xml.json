            "text": "It has been demonstrated that a marked immuno\u2010pathogenesis and lymphopenia has been associated with acute viral infections caused by viruses including the HIV\u20101 [Moses et al., 1998], measles virus [Okada et al., 2000], CSFV [Susa et al., 1992], and FMDV [Bautista et al., 2003; Diaz\u2010San Segundo et al., 2006]. In the case of FMDV, the induction of transient lymphopenia during acute phase infection affects all subpopulations of lymphocytes, such as CD4+ and CD8+, during 2\u20133 days after infection [Bautista et al., 2003]. One reason for the lymphopenia during the acute infection is of a viral induced apoptosis. A depletion of lymphocytes due to apoptosis has also been described in mice infected with a highly virulent influenza A virus (AIV, H5N1) isolated from humans [Tumpey et al., 2000]. Peng et al. [2004] has demonstrated recently that the recombinant VP1 of FMDV could induce the apoptosis of human cancer cells by modulating the Akt signaling pathway. However, no association of lymphocytes apoptosis is investigated. Ostrowski et al. [2005], recently demonstrated that FMDV can infect murine DCs in vitro and subsequently suppress thymus\u2010dependent immune responses in vivo. This interaction of FMDV and DC may induce the DC to undergo an apoptosis. Here, we described for the first time that the FMDV induces a rapid apoptosis in murine bone morrow derived DC (BMDC) before its infection. Since DCs play a crucial role in connection innate and adaptive immune responses, FMDV destroys the DC or affects DC functions, including downregulation of co\u2010stimulatory molecules, inhibition of cytokine secretion, and maturation and its presentation ability (data not shown), which could lead the host immune system impairment. Although, we have not investigated that the induction of apoptosis in DCs occur after FMDV infection in animals during its acute phase, our results clearly demonstrated that the inactivated FMDV induced immature BMDCs undergone apoptosis rapidly, which may reveal one of the important strategies to knockdown the immune surveillance before the FMDV invades into host cells.",
