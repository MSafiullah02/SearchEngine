Acute asthma exacerbations remain a significant cause of morbidity in children and can lead to an accelerated decline in lung function,1, 2, 3 which emphasises the importance of finding an appropriate preventive treatment. Epidemiologic studies have detected viral infections in more than 80% of school children with asthma exacerbations.4 Of the respiratory viruses known to cause asthma exacerbations, between 60% and 70% are types of human rhinoviruses (HRV).5, 6 Moreover, one recent study showed that HRV was associated with a significantly increased risk of day\u2010to\u2010day asthma symptoms in children.7 Understanding the role of HRV in acute asthma exacerbations may lead to interventions that will improve asthma management.",

There are more than 100 classical HRV serotypes, which are divided into groups A (HRV\u2010A) and B (HRV\u2010B). Because of developments in molecular methods, recent studies have discovered over 50 new HRV strains referred to as HRV\u2010C.8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14 Molecular epidemiological studies suggest that the dominant types are HRV\u2010A and HRV\u2010C, while HRV\u2010B is relatively rarely detected.12, 13, 14 HRV\u2010C accounts for the majority of asthma attacks in children and causes more severe attacks than other HRV types and other viruses.6, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19 In our previous study, we found that HRV infection was associated with asthma in our region.20 Some authors have demonstrated a close correlation between the HRV viral load and the disease severity in children with lower respiratory tract infections.21, 22, 23 However, there have been no reports on the correlation of the viral load of different HRV species with the severity of asthma exacerbations.",

The detection rate of HRV was 50.3% among inpatients, while some authors reported the rate to be between 60% and 70%. The reason for the difference was that their studies were performed among school\u2010aged children, and the region was different.5, 6 Among the inpatients, 34.7% (25/72) were diagnosed with HRV co\u2010infection, 52% (13/25) of cases were diagnosed as co\u2010infection with RSV, 24% (6/25) of cases were diagnosed as co\u2010infection with HBoV1, 16% (4/25) of cases were diagnosed as PIV, 8% (2/25) of cases were diagnosed as ADV, 8% (2/25) of cases were diagnosed as IFVA and 4% (1/25) of cases were diagnosed as HEV. The median age was 43 months, and 64% (16/25) were in the moderate to severe category groups. The incidence of HRV in outpatients was lower than that in hospitalized children, but the methods of virus detection are consistent, which may be because the severity of outpatients was relatively mild or onset of other causes, such as medication, is irregular. The detection rate of RSV was 25.2% (36/143) among inpatients, and 13 cases were diagnosed as co\u2010infection with HRV, 7 cases were diagnosed as co\u2010infection with other viruses (PIV/ADV/HEV/IFVA) and others were diagnosed as single infections.

CDHR3 mutations result in susceptibility to childhood asthma with severe exacerbations.46, 47 These findings suggest that CDHR3 is a functional receptor for HRV\u2010C and explain asthma exacerbations are commonly induced by HRV\u2010C. Additionally, different HRV types may have different replications and induce diversified cytokines and chemokines, which contribute to varying illness severity.48 Further study is needed to investigate the mechanism of HRV\u2010A and HRV\u2010C resulting in different illness severities.",
