            "text": "Some of the catastrophic and most deadly infectious disease outbreaks were associated by the following diseases:\n\u2014transmitted by bites from an infected flea; the disease spreads from human to human through contact with infected tissue and/or exposure to cough of an infected individual. This bacterial disease caused by killed millions of people in the Roman Empire and spread throughout Asia Minor and Greece as people moved away from infected areas running away from the disease. Another well-known outbreak of plague was \u201c Black Death\u201d, which devastated Europe and Asia, killing almost a third of the population.\n\u2014these are highly infectious diseases caused by viruses. Two of the commonly known and deadly haemorrhagic fevers include Ebola and Marburg virus disease, caused by Ebola virus and Marburg virus respectively. The worst Ebola epidemic so far since 1976, when the disease first occurred in Zaire, is the 2014 West African Ebola outbreak (WHO|World malaria report 2013 shows major progress in fight against malaria, calls for sustained financing, n.d.).\nThe outbreak heavily affected three West African countries Liberia, Sierra Leone, and Guinea had killed over eleven thousand people as of August 2015 (Boscarino and Adams 2015; Dhama et al. 2015; Na et al. 2015; Tartari et al. 2015; Van Kerkhove et al. 2015; WHO|One year into the Ebola epidemic: a deadly, tenacious and unforgiving virus, n.d.). Ebola is a viral disease transmitted through contact with body fluids, including the dead body of those who have died from the disease. There is currently no known cure for the disease although there are drugs that have been tested on some patients, some of whom have survived the infections. There are also individuals who have been able to build up immunity and survive the disease. Antibodies from these survivors hold information that could assist in further discoveries on the mechanism of disease. A vaccine has also been tried on some individuals who were in contact with Ebola patients, and these individuals were protected from the disease (Henao-Restrepo et al. 2015).\n\u2014This is one of the leading causes of death in young children. Caused by the measles virus, this infectious disease has also caused outbreaks in both adults and children despite the availability of a vaccine (Goodson et al. 2011; Nsubuga et al. 2006; Sniadack et al. 1999; WHO|Measles, n.d.). Although active immunization occurs in developing countries, in some developed and developing countries the population is not immunized against the disease. This could be due to interruption of vaccination campaigns due to conflicts and breakdown in security and/or out of choice, as is the case of some developed countries where the vaccine is available but parents choose not to vaccinate their children against the disease. Spreading through droplets, from coughs and sneezes of infected individuals, the disease is highly infectious and mortality due to disease has been recorded worldwide. Approximately 1,45,700 deaths in 2013 were reported by WHO (Sniadack et al. 1999).\n\u2014Malaria is one of the highest causes of mortality in endemic areas with around 3.2 billion people (Approximately half of the world population) at risk of the disease. Since the year 2000, malaria mortality rates have reduced by 45 % globally and 49 % in Africa ( WHO|World malaria report 2013 shows major progress in fight against malaria, calls for sustained financing, n.d.). Transmitted by Anopheles mosquitoes, the parasite from the genus Plasmodium is responsible for the disease. causes the most severe form of malaria (Beare et al. 2011; Boeuf et al. 2008; Milner et al. 2012; Montgomery et al. 2007; Roca-Feltrer et al. 2012). P. falciparum is common in sub-Saharan Africa while P. vivax is common in Asia. Despite the availability of drugs that treat malaria, complications have risen due to development of resistance to the drugs by the parasite. This has led to change in the first-line drugs for treatment of malaria over the years. Since the 1950s drugs such as Chloroquine, Sulphoxine pyrimethamine (Fansidar), Lumefantrine artemether (LAR) and Artemisnin combination drugs are some of those that have been used as first-line drugs. Sadly the parasite has developed resistance to most of these drugs. The current malaria treatment uses Artemisnin combination therapy, which is recommended by WHO for treating uncomplicated malaria. It has been observed in the past decade that the parasite is developing resistance to Artemisnin in South-East Asia (Cambodia, Laos, Myanmar, Thailand and Viet Nam). Several methods for malaria prevention have been used including indoor residual spraying to kill the mosquito vector, sleeping under insecticide treated bed nets to prevent mosquito bites and destruction of mosquito habitats. Children under the age of 5 and pregnant women are at high risk (WHO|World malaria report 2013 shows major progress in fight against malaria, calls for sustained financing, n.d.).\n\u2013Is one of the success stories in infectious diseases as it was declared eradicated by WHO in 1980. Smallpox was one of the most devastating diseases ever known. The last case diagnosed with smallpox was in 1977. The smallpox eradication programme, which ran from 1966 to 1980 was successful in identifying and following up on infected cases and finally in eradication of the disease. The viral disease caused by the virus was highly contagious and was transmitted through droplets during close contact with an infected person. Eradication of smallpox is a success story in the infectious disease history. The efforts put together to contain the disease in the areas where it was endemic, active surveillance, vaccination and informative campaigns including following trails of the disease by \u201c smallpox detectives\u201d led to the eradication of the disease. The smallpox vaccine prevented infection and lessened the severity of the disease (WHO|Smallpox, n.d., WHO|The Smallpox Eradication Programme\u2014SEP (1966\u20131980), n.d.).\nYellow fever\u2014is spread by several species of the mosquito. Over 900 million people are at risk of yellow fever in endemic countries in Africa and Latin America. The disease has 50 % mortality in those with severe infections if untreated. The yellow fever vaccine is available and provides lifelong immunity. Despite the availability of the vaccine there has been an increase in cases of yellow fever in the past two decades. Human factors such as deforestation, urbanization, migration of people and lack of, and/or decline of immunity and climate change have contributed to the increase in cases ( WHO|Yellow fever, n.d.).\nInfluenza\u2014A viral disease spread through droplets in coughs and sneezes, influenza has caused several outbreaks including four major ones. These include the 1918 Spanish Influenza, which was followed 40 years later by the Asian Influenza pandemic of 1958, and 11 years later the 1969 Hong Kong Influenza outbreak and finally 40 years later in 2009 the Avian H1N1 influenza pandemic. Although a vaccine is available, it is only available on a yearly basis as the combinations of the strains to be included in the vaccine are determined by surveillance information collected each year. Influenza affects all ages worldwide ( WHO|Influenza (Seasonal), n.d.).\nCholera\u2014A dangerous infectious disease transmitted through water contaminated with faecal matter. Cholera is a bacterial disease caused by . Outbreaks are common in developing countries, especially in sub-Saharan Africa due to poor sanitation. Cholera can also be contracted from food that has come into contact with contaminated water, for example fruit and vegetables that have been washed with contaminated water. Characterized by the \u201c rice water\u201d diarrhoea, cholera can easily spread in communities resulting in local outbreaks especially during the rainy season in endemic regions.\nSleeping sickness (Trypanosomiasis)\u2014Common in sub-Saharan Africa, trypanosomiasis is a parasitic disease transmitted by two vectors, tsetse flies for the African trypanosomiasis and triatomes (kissing bugs) for the American trypanosomiasis (Chagas disease). The parasite is responsible for the African sleeping sickness. Two species of the parasite are responsible for African sleeping sickness, T. which causes acute infection and T. which causes chronic disease.\nHIV\u2014The current HIV pandemic has resulted in approximately 1.5 million deaths in 2013 with approximately 35 million people infected globally. Sub-Saharan Africa carries the huge burden of the disease. Spread through body fluids, including sexual transmission, HIV has spread worldwide. About 3.2 million children were living with HIV in 2013. Mother to child transmission has resulted in children being infected with the virus at birth or during breast feeding. With no vaccine and/or cure at present abstinence and/or practicing safe sex through the use of condoms are the ways of preventing infection, being faithful to one partner is another way of preventing the spread of the disease if both partners are HIV negative. To suppress the HIV virus and/or stop the progression of the disease, anti-retro viral treatment is available for pregnant women, children born from HIV positive mothers and for people living with the virus ( WHO|Use of antiretrovirals for treatment and prevention of HIV infection, n.d.).\nSevere Acute Respiratory Syndrome ( SARS)\u2014An emerging viral disease that was first reported in Asia in 2003, SARS is caused by . Spread through droplets the disease can rapidly spread within a country and across borders. People of all ages are at risk of the disease. There has been no other diagnosis of the disease since 2004. The disease is believed to have been of zoonotic origin. SARS is a good example of how infectious diseases can spread rapidly (Board 2013; WHO|Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), n.d.).\nhaemorrhagic fever\u2014A viral disease that is transmitted by mosquitoes of the genus . The disease is endemic in the tropics and both children and adults are at high risk of contracting the disease. There is no treatment for the disease currently and the only way to prevent the spread of the disease is by controlling the mosquito vector. A vaccine against all four dengue serotypes has currently passed phase 3 trials (Villar et al. 2015). Dengue is one of the neglected tropical diseases in the world causing over 390 million dengue infections every year with 128 countries at risk of the disease. Dengue fever is present in the Americas, South-East Asia and the Pacific with recent outbreaks occurring in Europe (France and Croatia in 2010, Portugal in 2012) and the United States (Florida in 2013). The threat of the disease is increasing and it is a global threat. With the climate change that is being experienced globally vectors are now able to reach and survive in areas that they have never been reported before (Aubry et al. 2012; Brady et al. 2012; WHO|Dengue, n.d.).\n",

These include mosquitoes, flies, ticks, lice, fleas, mites and sandflies. Most of these vectors feed on blood and transmit the pathogen through their saliva and mouthparts as they feed. The disease pathogen is therefore introduced directly into the bloodstream. Other vectors such as triatomes introduce pathogens through their excreta. The triatomes defecate during feeding and if their excreta gets into an open wound or cut that may result from the host scratching in response to a bite from the triatome bug; the pathogen is then introduced into the host. Human lice have been known to transmit deadly diseases including typhus (Fournier et al. 2002; Mokrani et al. 2004). The lice introduce the pathogens during feeding on human blood. Ticks have also been known to transmit pathogens responsible for Rickettsia infections in sub-Saharan Africa (Raoult et al. 2001).",

The impact of infectious diseases on the human population has been felt for centuries and has led to discoveries that have preserved and allowed for survival of the human population. Due to exposure to these diseases, humans have developed immunity to infectious diseases. The impact of infectious diseases also led to biomedical research, which has resulted in development of vaccines and understanding mechanisms of disease. Despite these discoveries there are still millions of people affected by infectious diseases worldwide, most of them living in poor rural regions of developing countries. Rural populations suffer the huge impact of infectious diseases. These rural communities are vulnerable to infectious diseases and their livelihoods are greatly affected by the impact of these diseases.",
