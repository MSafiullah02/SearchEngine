On presentation to the emergency department, she was febrile (38.1\u00b0C) with mild subcostal recession and reduced air entry in the left lung base (respiratory rate 28/min, oxygen saturation 92% in room air). Chest radiograph revealed early left lower lobe consolidation (Fig. 1). She was admitted to the ward for benzylpenicillin (45 mg/kg/q6h intravenous injection (IVI)) and low\u2010flow oxygen (1 L/min). Over an 8\u2010h period, she had worsening respiratory distress, dramatic progression of chest radiograph appearances (Fig. 1) and required escalation to high\u2010flow oxygen (2 L/kg) via nasal prongs. She was mechanically ventilated prior to transfer to a tertiary paediatric centre for the management of respiratory failure. Full blood count revealed haemoglobin 122 g/L, white cell count 16.4 \u00d7 109/L, platelet count 230 \u00d7 109/L, neutrophil count 14.7 \u00d7 109/L, lymphocyte count 0.6 \u00d7 109/L, C\u2010reactive protein 46 mg/L, procalcitonin 1.6 ng/mL. Renal, liver functions and coagulation profile were all within normal ranges. Antimicrobial therapy was broadened to clindamycin (10 mg/kg/q8h IVI), cefotaxime (50 mg/kg/q8h IVI) and azithromycin (10 mg/kg/q24h IVI). Upon arrival to our tertiary paediatric centre, she was haemodynamically stable, but in severe respiratory failure with an oxygenation index of 45. A diagnosis of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) was made. Respiratory support was escalated to high\u2010frequency oscillatory ventilation and inhaled nitric oxide. A chest ultrasound demonstrated dense left\u2010sided consolidation and a small pleural effusion. Oseltamivir (45 mg/q12h orally) was added, and trimethoprim\u2010sulphamethoxazole (5/25 mg/kg/q6h IVI) for possible Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia in light of lymphopaenia and respiratory failure.",

Unlike most respiratory viruses occurring in childhood, there is no clear seasonality of HBoV infections.2 It however remains controversial whether HBoV1, as a single pathogen, causes disease as it is found in asymptomatic individuals,3 has prolonged shedding from the respiratory tract of up to 1 year following primary infection,4 and is found as a co\u2010pathogen in up to 75% of children with lower RTIs.2 Co\u2010detection with other viruses raises the question whether HBoV1 has an active or synergistic role in respiratory infections. Studies evaluating potential viral\u2010viral interactions are lacking. Therefore, attributing disease to HBoV1 alone is difficult and requires fulfilling of several microbiological criteria. Evidence is now emerging that HBoV1 alone can be a rare cause of acute severe RTIs necessitating critical care management.5, 6\n",

Children hospitalised with HBoV1 induced RTIs are often diagnosed with bronchiolitis, pneumonia or acute exacerbations of asthma.9, 10 Children admitted to ICU with HBoV1 are older than those admitted with RSV (median 24 vs. 2 months).11 Although rare, it is notable that there are increasing reports of HBoV1 causing severe, life\u2010threatening respiratory infections which require critical care support.5, 6 This included a previously reported case fatality in an 18 month\u2010old child with chronic lung disease of prematurity.12 To our knowledge, our case is only the second case describing the use of ECMO support for life\u2010threatening RTI caused by HBoV and the first describing critical ARDS caused by HBoV.",

Current expert guidance recommends that HBoV1 infection should not be diagnosed on the basis of HBoV1 DNA detection from respiratory samples alone. Additional diagnostic approaches include quantitative HBoV1 DNA analysis (>106 copies/mL) of nasopharyngeal secretions, serology (IgM, low IgG avidity or a more than or equal to fourfold IgG titre rise) and/or HBoV1 antigen detection in nasopharyngeal secretions.14 With advancements in diagnostic approaches, clinicians have been able to diagnose acute HBoV1 infection with greater confidence, which might explain the increasing reports of acute paediatric infections caused by HBoV1.",

In the absence of HBoV1 serological and antigen testing, DNA in blood could be used to diagnose HBoV1 RTI. The presence of HBoV1 viraemia is usually specific for acute HBoV1 infection.2 Viraemia is rarely detected in controls, has a short duration and rarely lasts beyond the first week of acute illness.14 We were able to demonstrate HBoV viraemia during the acute illness (day 2) which became undetectable during recovery (day 8). Significantly higher viral loads have been demonstrated in respiratory samples of children admitted to ICU with HBoV\u2010induced RTI.2 Our laboratory currently provides semi\u2010quantitative HBoV 1\u20134 viral loads only. Low Cts clearly below the cut off (Ct value cutoff \u2013 36) in all respiratory samples (Ct value 17.6 \u2013 NPA, Ct value 13.3 \u2013 BAL) and blood (Ct value \u2013 29.6) would indicate significantly high viral loads. The lack of evidence for other viruses or bacteria on multiple respiratory samples (BAL, NPA) provided support for HBoV as the aetiology. Only one set of BAL washings were taken from the lingula lobe as the child was too unstable to extend the procedure longer than necessary and take samples from other lobes. In the absence of other positive results, mono\u2010detection of HBoV1\u20104 from multiple respiratory samples separated in time and location, combined with PCR positivity in blood, we believe this to be strong evidence of true mono\u2010infection with HBoV. It is notable, however, that existing reports of severe disease attributed to HBoV has been in children with underlying conditions or immunocompromised status and that the typical age of infection for HBoV primary infection is under 2 years of age. It is therefore highly unusual that a previously well 6\u2010year girl develops HBoV infection of this magnitude. One hypothesis is the potential role of unique host\u2013virus interactions in causing disease however this remains to be elucidated.",

As in the index case we demonstrated HBoV 1\u20134 monodetection on NPA, however, viral loads were lower (Ct value 22.28 \u2013 NPA, Ct value 31.83 \u2013blood). There is currently no specific antiviral treatment available for HBoV1 infections. A post\u2010hoc analysis of a randomised controlled trial demonstrated that prednisolone was ineffective at reducing hospital admission stay in wheezing children with HBoV1 infection.17 Supportive management for HBoV1 bronchiolitis or pneumonia have been the mainstay of treatment.
