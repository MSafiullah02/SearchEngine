They are non-enveloped, single-stranded, positive-sense RNA viruses with genomes consisting of 3 ORFs that are usually partly overlapping and encode non-structural proteins (ORF1), a capsid protein (ORF2) and an ORF3 protein (Liu et al., 1999, Oliver et al., 2007a, Scipioni et al., 2008a). Bovine noroviruses are classified into two main genotypes within genogroup III, namely as genotype III/1 (Jena-like) or genotype III/2 (Newbury2-like). Other members of the Caliciviridae family that have been detected in bovine faecal samples are the currently unclassified BECs (bovine enteric caliciviruses) Newbury agent 1- and Nebraska (NB)-like viruses (Oliver et al., 2006a) as well as one reported detection of genogroup II/4 human norovirus (Mattison et al., 2007).",

Several studies have utilized primers designed from a small number of input sequences in the GenBank that were principally from strains circulating within a limited geographical area (Wise et al., 2004, Smiley et al., 2003), and most studies have been based on traditional one-step RT-PCRs combined with gel based detection of amplicons. Limited data on sequence variation, especially in RNA viruses, can hamper the design of good primers and probes for the detection of these agents (Chevaliez et al., 2007, Swanson et al., 2005), but this limitation may partially be overcome by utilizing parallel assays targeting different genomic parts of one organism (Anthony et al., 2007) or by using all available sequence information from related organisms to design a pan-assay (Escutenaire et al., 2007). A comparison of all available GenBank BoNoV sequences to date and previously published primers revealed one or more mismatches near the 3\u2032-end of one or both primers. This is not unexpected due to the increasing amount of BoNoV sequence data representing strains from different geographic regions that has accumulated recently (Benson et al., 2007).",

Recently a human GII/4-like sequence was detected in bovine feces in the USA, opening for the possibility that cattle may act as a potential reservoir for recombination events and for zoonotic noroviruses (Mattison et al., 2007). In the present study sequencing of the RdRp grouped the Norwegian viruses in both genotype III/1 and III/2, while sequencing of the capsid grouped the BoNoVs in genotype III/2 only. Interestingly capsid sequences associated with Jena-like RdRp sequences were most similar to the proposed chimeric virus Bo/Thirsk/00/UK sequences. Both genotype III/1 and III/2 RdRp variants were detected in most parts of Norway, but genotype III/1 RdRp sequences were only detected sporadically in the southeastern parts of Norway. The presence of Bo/Thirsk/00/UK-like strains may be a remnant from the systematic import of Scottish Ayrshire cattle in an attempt to increase productivity, that started in 1850 (Felius, 2007, Hirsch, 1911), but some more sequence information on both RdRp and capsid genes of BoNoV circulating in Europe is needed to evaluate the geographical spread of the chimeric virus. The presence of chimeric strains may influence serological assays which can make serological data difficult to interpret.",

The obtained sensitivity of 10 copies per reaction under optimal conditions represents approximately 2500 copies of target per g of feces, although this estimation has important limitations (Love et al., 2006). The obtained Ct-values for the 208 BoNoV positive samples ranged from 6.9 to 39.7 (Fig. 3), which is a substantially broader detection range than reported for a comparable real-time RT-PCR assay where Ct-values ranged from 21.5 to 33.3 (Wolf et al., 2007). This difference may be due to a larger number of samples used in the present study. Additionally any influence of specific herd immunity to the strain(s) present may have influenced the amount of virus shed in feces (Han et al., 2006). The present study included 419 samples from 190 herds, while 28 samples from two herds were used in the previously reported study (Wolf et al., 2007). The difference may also reflect assay variables like primer (and probe) compatibility or cycling kinetics or the presence of inhibitors and amplicons size, especially in low copy number samples. Even if the use of an internal control in a SYBR Green RT-PCR norovirus assay has recently been published for detecting inhibition in faecal samples (Scipioni et al., 2008b), we did not include an internal control in our assay, in order not to impair amplification of target, or complicate the assessment of amplification plots, The NucliSens easyMAG nucleic extraction system has been shown to perform more efficiently than manual extraction in removal of PCR inhibitors (Loens et al., 2007) and inhibitors were not detected in our spiking experiment on a selection of BoNoV negative samples.",

Peak shedding of BoNoV occurred on 4 and 8 dpi. Diarrhoea occurred only on 3 and 4 dpi and not after re-challenge on 23 dpi. Both calves continued shedding BoNoV until the termination of the experiment. The drop in Ct-values (\u223c10) after re-challenge may indicate some degree of virus replication without development of clinical symptoms. The rapid decrease in shedding after re-challenge probably indicates acquired immunity after the first challenge. In a natural herd environment it is likely that individual calves are frequently re-infected by the circulating enteric pathogens that are present during early life. Older calves may thus constitute a primary reservoir for a diverse range of pathogens that neonatal calves get exposed to. Shedding of BoNoV for a prolonged time may be a natural consequence of insufficient immunocompetence in these young animals (Henke-Gendo et al., 2009). The second wave of viral excretion (7\u20138 dpi) is probably related to the continuous upward migration and differentiation of immature enteric crypt cells and thus replenishment of susceptible villus epithelial cells (Boshuizen et al., 2003).",
