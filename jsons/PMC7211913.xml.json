In contrast, when passing through the airport in London, we saw no evidence of checks or measures to identify potential carriers. Coming from China at that time, we were shocked by the striking contrast. Now the question came into our minds: \u2018what if there was a way to test all passengers waiting to pass through immigration?\u2019. We all remembered the temperature measurement at airports in China after SARS in 2003. A similar rapid test at the airport can help to decide whether the passenger goes to isolation or quarantine (if they test positive) or pass without concerns (if negative). However, there are no biological laboratories or sophisticated instruments and the test would need to be done on-site and in a reasonably short period of time.",

RT-PCR test takes 90\u2013120 min per sample set, while LAMP can be completed with 30 min.

The RT-PCR method is the \u2018gold standard\u2019 test and widely used worldwide. It involves RNA extraction from the patient swab solution followed by reverse transcription of the RNA and then PCR expansion of the cDNA. The whole process can be automated and high-throughput testing can be performed, which makes it ideal for central test laboratories. However, it is not suitable for field use as it depends on a PCR machine, a laboratory environment for RNA extraction and skilled operators. Additionally, the surge for PCR reagents has created a global shortage of reagents supplies and has limited the test capacities of many test centres. RT-LAMP can detect both RNA and RNA fragments and can deliver the result much faster with easy operation of isothermal amplification of DNA at 65 \u00b0C [4]. Thus, LAMP is an obvious choice for its shorter running time as well as the fact that it usually has a lower detection limit. We could take advantage of this and remove the RNA extraction step. If possible, this would greatly simplify the test.",
