Although international tourism has received a lot of attention, domestic tourism remains the mainstay for many destinations. To inform the basis on which destinations compete, an understanding of the determinants of destination choices is required. In this paper, the discrete choice modelling method is applied to investigate the determining factors underlying the short-break holiday destination choices of prospective tourists from Melbourne, Australia. The results from an estimated nested logit model indicate the relative importance of a number of destination and trip attributes and respondent characteristics. The model results are used to simulate the effects on destinations' market shares resulting from various changes in attributes and tourist characteristics.",

However, the emphasis on international tourism tends to obscure the continuing dominance of domestic tourism flows in many countries. For instance, in Australia -a country in the top 15 of international tourism earners (World Tourism Organization, 2002) -domestic tourism expenditure has generally been around four to five times that of international tourists. Further, increased geopolitical instability and events such as the recent SARS virus outbreak may well result in substitution effects between international and domestic tourism flows. This suggests enhanced domestic tourism opportunities for holiday destinations.",

The agencies responsible for destination development and promotion need to be aware of the determinants of tourists' destination choices. That knowledge helps the agencies to identify their destination's position within the market and the potential need to reposition themselves strategically. In this paper, the use of discrete choice modelling to analyse domestic tourists' destination choices is reported. It concerns the choices of short-break destinations by residents from Melbourne -capital city of the state of Victoria, Australia. Short breaks are defined here as trips of two to three nights' duration, e.g. long weekends or mid-week arrangements. Consistent with Lancaster's (1966 Lancaster's ( , 1971 characteristics-based theory of consumer choice, the choice modelling method is based on the key premise that consumers base their purchase decisions on the comparative attributes of a relevant choice set of rival products. Applied to tourism, this refers to choices by tourists between various destinations that differ in their attributes such as their attractions, facilities and the distance from tourists' home. The application of the characteristics approach in a discrete destination choice framework is discussed in Papatheodorou (2001) .",

In stated choice studies, information about decision-makers' preferences is elicited using decision experiments. It is in this respect that stated choice models differ from models based on choices revealed in actual choice situations. To approximate actual choice situations in a stated choice model, the analyst selects an appropriate set of product attributes and a set of relevant choice options. This requires careful exploratory research and testing but does not ensure the external validity of results derived from the stated choice experiment. However, various studies have shown the external validity of stated preference models (see, for instance, Pearmain et al., 1991; Swait et al., 1994; Adamowicz et al., 1998) .",

These include Haider and Ewing (1990) in which Canadian tourists' choices of Caribbean islands are analysed.

Also, Huybers and Bennett (2000) use choice modelling to analyse international holiday destination choices of prospective UK tourists. Morley (1994) and Huybers and Bennett (2000) are based on the stated choices of prospective tourists to avoid the potential for selection bias often associated with surveys of tourists at their destinations. The same approach is followed in this paper.",

The utility of a good, which cannot be observed, is assumed to consist of two components. The first is the deterministic component, V, which is an indirect utility function of the options' attributes, a, as well as of the decision-maker's characteristics, c. The second component represents the random error term, e, which plays a crucial role in model specifications as will be discussed shortly.

It shows that the upper level choice is made between the branches 'No Holiday' and 'Holiday'. The elemental choice alternatives are shown as the lower level choices within the subsets.

The parameter m b is the IV parameter of branch b. It is an indicator of the similarity of the options within the branch in terms of their error structure. As shown in equation (5), the inverse of m b is used as a scale parameter to normalise the utilities of each choice alternative within a particular branch (see Koppelman and Wen, 1998; Hensher and Greene, 2002) . To be globally consistent with random utility maximisation, the IV parameter must lie between 0 and 1, although Boersch-Supan (1990) demonstrates that IV parameters >1 are valid under local utility maximisation conditions. The IV parameter equals 1 if the correlation between the indirect utility functions of the options within the branch is zero. If all IV parameters are equal to 1, the model specification reduces to the MNL model (Ben-Akiva and Lerman, 1985) .

This regional classification differs from the one adopted by the Australian Bureau of Statistics and used for the purpose of the National Visitor Survey. Focus group participants clearly indicated that they were more familiar with, and hence preferred, the regions identified by Tourism Victoria. Table 1 shows the number of overnight trips for each of the six destinations and the shares of each destination as a percentage of total overnight trips by Melbourne residents (National Visitor Survey, 2000) . As shown in the table, the six regions in the survey cover 49% of all overnight visitors from Melbourne. Focus group discussions revealed that six was the maximum number of destinations to be included with a view to the complexity of the survey task. In addition, participants indicated that a mix of two interstate and four Victorian destinations was appropriate. In that light, coverage of 49% of current overnight visitors appears acceptable.",

This involves testing for the equivalence between the parameters of the full model and a model in which one of the options is deleted.

However, there is reason to believe that the destinations in the non-degenerate branches display some correlation associated with common unobserved destination attributes. This is due to the derivation of the tree structure from a choice frequency experiment that was included in the questionnaire. In that experiment, respondents were asked to indicate their destination choices on the basis of the names of the six destinations and the option to stay at home. Offering only the names of the destinations ensured that the choices would be determined by respondents' perceptions of the various destinations and their attributes. The experiment consisted of eight choice sets of different sizes and compositions, allowing an assessment of choices in different choice contexts (cross-effects). The choice sets were constructed using an ortho- gonal 2 n present-absent design. Half the respondents received the main design, whereas the other half were presented with its foldover version. A choice model with choice frequencies as dependent variables and ASCs as independent variables was estimated and the results are shown in Table 4 . The relative magnitudes of the estimated ASCs suggest the subsets of destinations as depicted in Figure 3 (a nested structure with Canberra and 'None' was tried but showed inferior estimation results). The 'Inland' branch comprising Canberra and Goldfields of Victoria appears plausible because they are the only two non-coastal destinations and, hence, may share unobserved attributes that cause correlations among the error components within the subset. The common denominator for the branch containing Mornington Peninsula, Phillip Island/Gippsland and Sydney is not obvious. Hence, the first tier in the structure is labelled 'M-P-S'. The results in Table 4 suggest that Great Ocean Road is perceived as sufficiently different from the other three coastal destinations and appears separately in the tree structure as does the 'None' option.",

The loglikelihood of the nested logit model is significantly higher than that of the equivalent MNL specification (-5280.436 ) at a significance level of 0.01 using the likelihood ratio test. Twice the difference between these log-likelihood values is greater than the critical Chi-squared value with four degrees of freedom (13.277).
