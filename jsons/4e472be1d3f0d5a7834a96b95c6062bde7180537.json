Diseases may also be spread by animal products such as meat, meat products, milk, milk products, semen, ova and embryos, which have been either derived from infected animals or contaminated by the infectious agent. Controls are therefore aimed at cutting off these mechanisms of transmission. However, some diseases present particular control problems; for example, FMD may be transmitted through the wind over distances more than 200 kilometres and AI may spread via migratory birds. Other diseases may be transmitted by insect vectors, for example, bluetongue.

The review covered what had been achieved in the past, how well it had been achieved and how policy should develop in the future. There were a number of drivers for a review. Much of the existing policy had been developed in a piecemeal fashion between 1988 and 1995 when there were only 12 member states. Legislation had been made in haste, usually in response to a disease crisis. New and emerging diseases such as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), and Hendra and Nipah viruses had arisen which were zoonotic and which had originated from wildlife reservoirs. There was concern over the global spread of a strain of avian influenza (H5N1) which was zoonotic and killed over 50% of those human beings unfortunate enough to become infected. With globalisation of trade, the volume of trade in animal products within the EU and with third-country trading partners had increased substantially. During the preceding decade, the EU had suffered large and very costly epidemics of disease: classical swine fever (CSF), foot and mouth disease (FMD) and highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI). In the face of these large outbreaks, there was growing public concern as to whether killing of large numbers of animals in order to control disease was the right approach. This concern was greatest in a sector of the EU which had grown with increasing affluence and which kept livestock not for commercial reasons but as a hobby. Hobby keepers often place an emotional value on their livestock beyond any commercial value, which was the basis of compensation in any disease eradication programme. Also, the institutional framework of the EU had changed, and there had been significant advances in the science and technology needed to inform animal health policy. Once the review had been completed, there was an extensive stakeholder consultation following which the Commission published a Communication: 'A new Animal Health Strategy for the European Union (2007) (2008) (2009) (2010) (2011) (2012) (2013) where Prevention is better than cure' (European Commission 2007), otherwise known as the EU Animal Health Strategy 2007-2013.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 2077, "end": 2083, "text": "(2007)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2084, "end": 2090, "text": "(2008)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2091, "end": 2097, "text": "(2009)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2098, "end": 2104, "text": "(2010)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2105, "end": 2111, "text": "(2011)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2112, "end": 2118, "text": "(2012)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2119, "end": 2125, "text": "(2013)", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "eu anImal health legIslatIon"}, {"text": "A European Court of Auditors (2004) special report on the eradication, control and monitoring programmes to contain animal diseases, concluded that the animal disease programmes adequately contained animal diseases, and that the Commission's approach is supported by good technical advice, risk analysis and a mechanism for prioritising resources (ECA 2016). A noted drawback is that it is difficult to evaluate the cost-effectiveness (CE) of programmes due to the lack of available models and standardised for such an analysis.

Effectiveness can be estimated by measuring the results of an intervention, as well as by measuring the impact of an intervention. Measurement of the full impact might be often difficult (e.g. how to measure the impact of an improved health status on the gains this created with respect to a country's trade position, such as being less vulnerable to an export ban). The estimation of effect may require the use of an epidemiological model tailored to the policy intervention or project environment that is analysed (e.g. Bergevoet et al. 2009 ).

Costs and effects of interventions need to be carefully related to each other, and then proper aggregation of costs and effects need to be accounted for, including discounting (Brent 2003, chapter 6) .

Sensitivity analyses in such evaluations should also indicate when an alternative strategy should be preferred. In the ex post monitoring, the main focus could then be to monitor whether key indicators are reaching tipping points so alternative strategies need to be considered. A complicating factor in ex post CE analysis is that the control or context variables are no longer constant (in contrast with ex ante CE analysis using modelling tools in which these variables are controlled), but are changing at the same time as the intervention efforts are made (and maybe in different directions for different member states). As such, this likely affects the linkage between the intervention and the final impact, and for a sound CE analysis the impact of the change in context variables on the programme performance need to be corrected for. The reason why in the literature ex post evaluations are relatively scarce is probably because of the many complexities involved and because CE analysis is especially interesting when comparing different alternatives.

Second, DG SANTE uses an extensive so-called fee-grid approach, which defines eligible unit cost levels or imposes maximum limits to unit costs for different (disease-specific) eligible cost categories.
