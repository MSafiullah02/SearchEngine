Every expert commentary and every analysis in recent years tells us that the costs of inaction are immense. And yet, as the havoc caused by the last outbreak turns into a fading memory, we become complacent and relegate the case for investing in preparedness on a back burner, only to bring it to the forefront when the next outbreak occurs.

Yet only a handful of countries have carried out pandemic preparedness exercises (World Bank, 2017). Furthermore, funding for pandemic preparedness (e.g., the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations and the Bloomberg Foundation), has been led by nongovernmental donors more than by governments. Global preparedness is critical and must include strengthening global surveillance in public and other health care delivery systems. Communities must be engaged as active partners in primary and secondary infectious disease prevention efforts. As the largest cadre of the health workforce in every country, as well as a profession that is dedicated to prevention and alleviation of suffering, nurses must be integrally involved with interprofessional teams, communities, and across sectors for global pandemic preparedness.",

To mitigate the delay, it is essential that the health care professional who is the initial point of contact with the infected person, likely the community health worker in many global settings, communicate with the appropriate provider or agency to initiate the next steps including identification of the pathogen, initiation of appropriate treatment, and prevention of further dissemination. In addition, recognition of a pattern, alerting others as to the emerging disease, and preventive services will aid in preventing further diffusion of pathogens from isolated cases. A delay in such identification may lead to the development of epidemics/pandemics and be an impediment to the prompt initiation of treatment for the infected individual, appropriate interventions and protective devices, and efforts to curtail the spread of the epidemic.",

A policy that requires the development of a network incorporating the community health workers into an early warning system will facilitate the prompt identification of potentially communicable diseases. The early identification of suspicious illnesses requires that these individuals are educated regarding symptoms, modes of transmission, information about ways to interrupt the chain of infection, and who and how to make contacts for rapid follow-up. Providing a cell phone or other communication device to community health workers or others likely to be an initial point of contact may be an efficient, cost-effective approach to facilitating the early identification of communicable diseases.
