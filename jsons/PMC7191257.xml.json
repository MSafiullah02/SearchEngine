One critical difference in their initial approaches was the overall sense of complacency by government officials, resulting in a reactive instead of proactive response. Italy, Spain, and the United States chose to falsely reassure the populace and to downplay the threat of COVID-19. Dissemination of coherent information about the pandemic only began after more than 1 month (in Italy)6 and 1.5 months (in Spain),7 upon observing a surge in new COVID-19 cases (Fig. 1). By that time, the pandemic had grown out of control in those countries and had overwhelmed healthcare facilities. The number of new cases in Italy has stabilized recently, suggesting that aggressive actions are working, but the crisis could have been averted had the country chosen to handle COVID-19 diligently from the start and ensured that sufficient COVID-19 testing was conducted sooner. As a result, Italy, Spain, and the United States are among the many countries experiencing severe social and economic turmoil today.",

The answer lies in 2 concluding observations that bear on the capacity of the modern healthcare system in developed countries. First, the number of hospital beds has fallen as the length of stay is reduced in response to pressures from lower insurance costs. Furthermore, increasing numbers of patients are receiving medical and surgical care in outpatient facilities to increase hospital efficiencies.8 Second, understaffing and reduced ICU occupancies over the years,9 in a bid to reduce hospital-acquired infections,10 have undermined the ability to provide critical care during mass-casualty incidents. Although these changes reflect the progress of healthcare and society, they have seemingly \u201cbackfired\u201d during the COVID-19 pandemic. However, this is not the case because advanced health care (quality-wise) in the United States would have easily handled COVID-19 if officials had instead chosen to face COVID-19 with tenacity at its inception like its Asian counterparts, which it actually had much time to do (Fig. 1).",
