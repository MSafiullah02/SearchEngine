Methods: We conducted an uncontrolled non-comparative observational study in a cohort of 80 relatively mildly infected inpatients treated with a combination of hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin over a period of at least three days, with three main measurements: clinical outcome, contagiousness as assessed by PCR and culture, and length of stay in infectious disease unit (IDU). Results: All patients improved clinically except one 86 year-old patient who died, and one 74 year-old patient still in intensive care. A rapid fall of nasopharyngeal viral load was noted, with 83% negative at Day7, and 93% at Day8. Virus cultures from patient respiratory samples were negative in 97.5% of patients at Day5. Consequently patients were able to be rapidly discharged from IDU with a mean length of stay of five days. Conclusion: We believe there is urgency to evaluate the effectiveness of this potentially-life saving therapeutic strategy at a larger scale, both to treat and cure patients at an early stage before irreversible severe respiratory complications take hold and to decrease duration of carriage and avoid the spread of the disease. Furthermore, the cost of treatment is negligible.",

However, it is highly likely that there are a large number of asymptomatic carriers in the population, and thus it is probable that the mortality rate has been overestimated. To take the example of the outbreak onboard the Diamond Princess cruise-ship, the fatality rate was 1.4% [5] . France is now facing the onslaught of COVID-19 with more than 25,000 cases, as March 26th, 2020 [5] . Thus, there is a critical and urgent need for an effective treatment in order to cure symptomatic patients but also to decrease the duration of virus carriage and thus limit transmission in the community. Among the candidate drugs to treat COVID-19, repositioning old drugs for use as an antiviral treatment is a compelling strategy, because knowledge about these drugs' safety profile, side effects, pharmacokinetics and drug interactions are already well known [6, 7] .",

            "text": "COVID-19 poses two major challenges to physicians. The first is the therapeutic management of patients. In this context, it is necessary to avoid a worsening evolution, which usually occurs around the tenth day and may result in acute respiratory distress syndrome, the prognosis of which, in particular in the elderly, is poor, whatever the cause. Therefore, the primary therapeutic objective is to treat people who have moderate or severe infections at an early enough stage to avoid progression to a serious and irreversible condition. By administering hydroxychloroquine combined with azithromycin, we were able to observe an improvement in all cases, except in one patient who arrived with an advanced form, who was over the age of 86, and in whom the evolution was irreversible. For all other patients in this cohort of 80 people, the combination of hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin resulted in a clinical improvement that appeared superior when compared to outcomes of other hospitalised patients, as described in the literature. In a cohort of 191 Chinese inpatients, of whom 95% received antibiotics and 21% received a combination of lopinavir and ritonavir, the median duration of fever was 12 days and that of cough 19 days in survivors, with a 28% case-fatality rate [19] . The favourable evolution of our patients under hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin paralleled a relatively rapid decrease in viral RNA load as assessed by PCR, which was even more rapid when assessed by culture. These data are important to compare with that of the literature which shows that the viral RNA load can remain high for about three weeks in most patients in the absence of specific treatment [19, 23] with extreme cases lasting for more than a month. A study conducted in 76 Chinese COVID-19 inpatients showed that high viral RNA load is associated with the severity of the disease [24] . Furthermore, in a study conducted on a small group of 16 Chinese COVID-19 inpatients, viral RNA was positively detected in 50% of them, after resolution of symptoms for a median duration of 2.5 days and a maximum of eight days [25] . Therefore, the rapid decrease in viral RNA load is one element suggesting the effectiveness of this treatment. Furthermore, to our knowledge, the measurement of viral culture during treatment was also evaluated for the first time. The fall in culture positivity from the second day is remarkable, although, in a relatively small number of cases, some people maintain a positive culture. The second challenge is the rapid spread of the disease in the population through contagious individuals. The elimination of viral carriage in the human reservoir of the virus has recently been recognised as a priority [26] . To this end, the rapid decease in positivity in cultures from patients' respiratory samples under treatment with hydroxychloroquine plus azithromycin supports an effectiveness of this combination. Thus, in addition to its direct therapeutic role, this combination can play a role in controlling the disease epidemic by limiting the duration of virus shedding, which can last for several weeks in the absence of specific treatment. In our Institute, which contains 75 individual rooms for treating highly contagious patients, we currently have a turnover rate of 1/3 per day which allows us to receive a large number of these contagious patients with early discharge.",

Because of anecdotical reports of heart complications with such drugs in patients with underlying conditions, it would be useful to perform an ECG before or at the very beginning of the treatment [27] . This problem is solved by hospitalising patients at risk in continuing care units with ECG monitoring allowing for the early detection and treatment of possible cardiac side-effects. Azithromycin is the drug that has been the most widely prescribed against respiratory infections and a recent (2010) study showed that one in eight American patients, has been prescribed azithromycin [28] . Indeed, there have probably been more than a billion azithromycin prescriptions around the world since it was first discovered. The toxicity of each of these two drugs does not, therefore, pose a major problem. Their possible toxicity in combination has been suggested in a few anecdotal reports but, to our knowledge, has never been demonstrated.",
