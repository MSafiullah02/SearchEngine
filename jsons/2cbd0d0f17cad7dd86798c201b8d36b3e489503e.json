Nevertheless, their safety, related to their propensity to prolong the QT interval of the electrocardiogram, remains challenging [12] . The French Pharmacovigilance system has been among the first to issue an international warning on this topic and to suggest safety measures in order to mitigate the risk [13, 14] , soon to be relayed by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) [15] and the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) [16] . A pharmacovigilance national survey has been ordered by French health authorities with a special focus on cardiac safety. Indeed, these drugs are associated with a risk of QT prolongation and \"serious\" cardiac arrhythmias possibly leading to cardiac arrest and sudden death [17] . In France, each Regional Center of Pharmacovigilance (RCPV), nested within a department of Medical Pharmacology, gathers notifications from a distinct area of France. All RCPV constitute the French Pharmacovigilance network which is unique in Europe to determine how expected -and unexpected-risks associated with drug treatments translate in everyday practice. In return, they provide unique information to health professionals about optimal drug use.",

Potential automedication and/or overdosage were noted as well. Missing data were requested by pharmacovigilants to the reporting initial health professional. All ECGs were examined by two residents in clinical pharmacology specializing in pharmacovigilance under the tutelage of a trained cardiologist in the field. All digitized ECGs parameters were measured with help of a digital caliper (Iconico \u00ae , CardioCalipers \u00ae , www.iconico.com), by classical standard methods [21] . QT intervals were calculated on 3 consecutive complexes, in D2 lead if possible (most of the times) and corrected according to Bazett and Fridericia formulae. ECGs and measurements were triple checked by the Department of Cardiology of the University Hospital of Nice in reports of discrepancy, especially of the corrected QT interval (QTc) value, i.e. in case of the presence of a pacemaker, a complete bundle branch block, or an atrio-ventricular (AV) block. QTc interval durations beyond 450 ms for men and 460 ms for women were deemed abnormal [22] . A QTc \u2265500 ms or prolongation thereof (delta QTc) from \"baseline\" \u226560 ms, after treatment introduction, were deemed \"serious\". Reports were classified in sudden or unexplained deaths, cardiac arrests, ventricular arrhythmias (including torsades de pointes, syncope and symptoms reflecting such rhythm problems), conduction disorders (associated or not with prolonged QTc), and abnormal/prolonged QTc. ADRs not matching the abovementioned were classified as \"other cardiac ADRs\". Categories may occur more than once for patient with conduction disorders.",

The resulting surge of its prescriptions yields over a month a raw incidence of \"serious\" cardiac ADRs in the range of 0.8 to 2.5%, notwithstanding the strong pharmacovigilance underreporting [24] . Even if the controlled environment of hospital use as well as repeated warnings addressed to physicians since March favors ADR reporting, such notifications are perceived by doctors as cumbersome in COVID-19 intensive care units because health professionals are overwhelmed by their task and most paper files, including ECGs, are also confined in the patients' rooms. Furthermore because of a \"regulatory oddity\", ADRs occurring in clinical trials are not streamlined by RCPVs, whereas HCQ, AZI, and LOPI are largely used within clinical trials. The incidence of cardiac ADRs with HCQ, from ~ 1 to 2% is in line with what has been recently published [12] , taking note of strong underreporting. Therefore, these 120 hospital reports likely represent \"the tip of the iceberg\" of cardiac ADRs, hence those linked to prescriptions by city doctors and other heterodox situations (internet, misuse\u2026).",

This may result from to the wide media diffusion of a possible efficacy of these drugs, even though no conclusive relevant data exists yet [25] . Though, cardiotoxicity of HCQ and CQ is known as they can be considered pharmacologically as \"multi-channel blockers\". Both drugs inhibit sodium and calcium currents, and HCQ, at least, also blocks the pace-maker current If [26] . All four drugs block cardiac voltage-dependent potassium channels, hence their association with QT prolongation which figures in the respective summary of product characteristics of HCQ, CQ, LOPI and AZI. Cardiac action potential is the result of finely tuned voltage-dependent ionic channels, allowing cations to circulate sequentially inward and outward cardiomyocytes. The delayed rectifier current (IK) and particularly its rapid component IKr plays a crucial role in outward K + conductance leading to repolarization (Fig.   2 ) [27, 28] . By blocking potassium currents, these drugs prolong the cardiac repolarization, thus the duration of the QT interval (Fig. 3A) . The latter, as measured on the ECG, reflects the ventricular repolarization by summing all ventricular action potentials. Blockade of potassium channels disrupts the electrical homogeneity required to a proper contraction of the heart and yields therefore an arrhythmogenic substrate. This phenomenon facilitates ventricular arrhythmias which may comprise ventricular extrasystoles (Fig. 3B) , ventricular tachycardia and the pathognomonic torsades de pointes (TdP) phenomenon (Fig. 3C ). TdP is a life-threatening polymorphic ventricular tachycardia typically triggered by the occurrence of early after-depolarizations (EAD) in a setting of an inhomogeneous repolarization [29] .",

Indeed, we observed a significant discordance not only between computer-estimated (machine read) and clinician-estimated QTcs, but also between the clinicians' and our measurements. This led to significant clinical consequences and is illustrated in our study as HCQ was given to a patient with a probable congenital long QT syndrome (LQTS) whose baseline QTc was >500 ms. He suffered from ventricular arrhythmia soon after the second intake of 200 mg oral HCQ and recovered fortunately after cardioversion.",

Considering that ~150,000 extra tablets were used to treat COVID-19 infections in hospitals, we estimated this to correspond to 5,000 to 10,000 patients. Since 77 reports were associated with HCQ alone, initiated in March 2020, the estimated hospital incidence is of 0.77 % [0.61-0.96] in case of 10,000 patients to 1.54 % [1.22-1.92]",

They all reduce outward potassium currents during phase 3 of the action potential. Such reduction of net outward current augments the APD which translates in an increased QT interval on the ECG. It also facilitates the development of early afterdepolarizations (EADs) associated with calcium influx, because of the delay in repolarisation and a membrane still relatively electropositive. These EADs can lead to extrasystoles which may trigger complex ventricular reentries such as Torsades de Pointes. The prolonged QT reflects the underlying arrhythmogenic substrate resulting from an increased dispersion of the repolarization. The development of early afterdepolarizations and TdP usually occurs with drugs that block IKr, the rapid component of the potassium current IK A factor of particular importance for the genesis of TdP is a particular predisposition of individual patients aggravated by the presence of risk factors (hypokalemia,hypomagnesemia, feminine gender, bradycardia, multiple drugs prolonging the QT\u2026) which reduce the repolarization reserve.[27]",
