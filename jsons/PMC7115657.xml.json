(Polygalaceae), which have been used as traditional medicine in China for treating insomnia, headache and epilepsy [1,2]. TMCA has been reported to show anticonvulsant and sedative activity in former studies, and mechanism research reveal that it act as a GABAA/BZ receptor agonist for anti-seizure and insomnia therapy [3,4]. The appealing structural scaffold and pharmacological importance of TMCA has encouraged researches to synthesize its drivatives as novel drug candidates. Up to now, TMCA derivatives have attracted great attention and interest from researchers in the field of medicinal chemistry [5].",

We summarized advances in natural products of TMCA analogues (N1-9) and synthetic derivatives (S1-74). As for the synthetic derivatives, both the investigations that TMCA as core nucleus or as active substituent are reviewed. When using TMCA as substituent, the analogues are compared to the most potent compound according to SAR. For these points of view, this review is dedicated to accomplish an urgent need of compilation and summarization of natural products, biological activities and SAR that could be helpful for researchers to design some new potentially active of TMCA analogues.",

Side effects and multidrug-resistant exist in clinical utilizations of modern drugs have forced researchers to set their sights to natural products to seek precursors with more safety and efficiency. TCM (Traditional Chinese Medicine), a cluster of time-honored herb medicine, has attracted much attention in developing new drugs. Our research group has made unremitting effort to seek promising lead compounds from TCM, not only TMCA from P. tenuifolia, but also \u03b1-asarone from Acorus gramineus, salvianic acid A from Salvia miltiorrhiza and vanillyl alcohol from Gastrodia elata have been absorbed into the investigation [12,13]. Combination of Traditional Chinese Medicine Chemistry, CTCMC, is our main drug design strategy (Fig. 2\n), which means to integrate active constituents based on TCM theory. Accordint to the strategy CTCMC, we have developed potential lead compounds including DBZ (tanshinol borneol ester) [14,15], 2-hydroxypyrrolobenzodiazepine-5,11-dione analogues [16] and TMCA-\u03b1-asaronol ester [17,18]. We believe that this strategy is benefit to the innovation of new drugs from natural products. Moreover, we consider that this strategy can be helpful to decrease the costs during screening the test compounds and the blindness existing in the structural modification of natural products.",

Furthermore, N6 abolished isoprenaline and BayK8644-induced EADs (early afterdepolarizations), suppressed DADs (delayedafterdepolarizations) and Tas (triggered activities). The phenomenon revealed that N6 protected heart from arrhythmias via its inhibitory effect on calcium channel. Ester N6 was also described to probe the active site of esterase named FAE-III, with the Km (substrate concentration at which the reaction rate is half of Vmax) value of 1.63, and Kcat (limiting rate of any enzyme-catalyzed reaction at saturation) value of 1063 [30].",

The present survey indicates that TMCA ester and amide derivatives have been targeted for their antitumor, antiviral, CNS agnets, antimicrobial, anti-inflammatory and hematologic agents. There is much scope in this potent TMCA ester and amide moiety for other therapeutic targets, future investigations of the scaffolds could give some more encouraging results in the field of medicinal chemistry. It is not to be neglected that esters generally perform poor pharmacokinetics and limited druggability [84], so there are still gaps waiting for overcoming when TMCA derivatives are developed to the marketed drugs.",
