The global outbreak of this disease is significantly bigger than the prior pandemic of SARS and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS). Within 3 months, SARS-CoV-2 spread rapidly from Wuhan city to the entire country of China, and then into more than 120 countries worldwide. Up to March 14, 2020, a total of 81,021 cases of COVID-19 with 3194 deaths in China and 63,016 cases with 2212 deaths outside of China have been confirmed. Unfortunately, the global numbers of both infected patients and fatalities will continue to grow in the future months because no specific effective antiviral therapies nor vaccine have been identified.4",

However, nausea or vomiting (5.0%) and diarrhea (3.8%) were present but uncommon. The median incubation period was 4 days, and 23.7% cases had at least one coexisting comorbid condition. Some patients rapidly developed severe pneumonia, pulmonary edema, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), acute respiratory failure, or multiple organ failure.

But it\u2019s unclear whether the liver injury can be caused directly by the coronavirus itself. It is well known that SARS-CoV-2 is closely related to SARS-CoV, and they share the same receptor, angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), and lung is the main target organ of the corona virus infection. Previous RNA-seq data in the human protein atlas database demonstrates expression of ACE2 in the liver.28 However, only a low frequency of ACE2 expression is observed in cholangiocytes, but not in hepatocytes, Kupffer cells, and endothelial cells.29 Recently, the single-cell RNA-seq data from two independent cohorts suggest cholangiocyte-specific expression of ACE2 in human liver samples. Similarly, single cell sequencing and immunohistochemistry study showed that ACE2 was only expressed in bile duct epithelial cells of normal liver tissues, and very minimally in hepatocytes.",

A clinical trial of lopinavir/ritonavir or abidol for treatment of COVID-19 from Shanghai showed that two cases of each group occurred liver injury among two-hundred and sixty-two patients.42 Thus, if abnormality of liver enzymes occurs after using a hepatotoxic drug, drug-induced liver injury should first be confirmed or ruled out. In addition, given the high burden of chronic liver disease in China, nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, chronic hepatitis B, and liver cirrhosis might be the major alternative causes of liver injury in Chinese patients with COVID-19.43 SARS-CoV-2 infection and related immune changes might be regarded as a \u201csecond hit\u201d to simple fatty liver, and can induce incident liver injury and steatohepatitis. Stress and sepsis are particularly problematic in cirrhotic patients, as either can trigger acute-on-chronic liver failure. However, the information of pre-existing liver diseases has not been outlined in most studies of COVID-19 and the interaction between existing liver disease and SARS-CoV-2 infection has not yet been studied.36",

The COVID-19 disease itself can result in severe and even fatal respiratory diseases, and in mainland China 2.3% of CFR is attributed to ARDS and multiple organ failure. Increasing evidence has demonstrated frequent incident liver injury in COVID-19, especially in patients with multiple organ injury. The liver injury itself has often manifested as transient elevation of serum aminotransferases. However, acute liver failure and obvious intrahepatic cholestasis have been reported in the available studies, but seldomly prevalence of abnormal aminotransferases is significantly higher in severe cases than in mild cases, according to many studies of COVID-19. The underlying mechanisms of liver injury in cases of COVID-19 might include psychological stress, systemic inflammation response, drug toxicity, and progression of pre-existing liver diseases, i.e. from simple fatty liver to steatohepatitis. Currently, there is insufficient evidence for SARS-CoV-2 infected hepatocytes or virus-related liver injury in COVID-19 patients, and it is difficult to summarize the role of the immune system in causing liver damage by the virus at present. Therefore, the pathophysiology and implication of liver injury have not yet been fully determined in COVID-19, as reports about liver injury as well as underlying mechanisms are limited.",
