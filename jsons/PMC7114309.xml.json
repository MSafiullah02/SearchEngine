ProMED-mail provides up-to-date information on human diseases, zoonotic diseases and diseases that affect sources of human nutrition (both plants and livestock animals) [26]. Each day, ProMED-mail's editor, assisted by five associates and about 25 scientific experts, cull through the dozens of e-mailed reports of mysterious outbreaks sent in from experts and amateur disease watchers throughout the world. The ProMED-mail team gathers and posts, from newspapers, health department alerts, government reports and other sources, the information for threats to public health that official syndromic surveillance systems may not yet be circulating [31]. In 2003, ProMED-mail was the first to report the disease that turned out to be SARS. In 2006, ProMED-mail's prompt reporting on a cattle die-off in northeastern Kenya that turned out to be the first outbreak of Rift Valley fever in nearly a decade enabled officials to contain the virus [31].",

The Argus analytic team consists of multilingual analysts that utilize state of the art online media processing software designed in collaboration with the MITRE Corporation [44]. Argus currently covers 34 languages, and manages between 2200 to 3300 active case files with update report threading for approximately 175 countries and over 130 disease entities [44]. The Argus team has developed a social disruption model to enable rapid detection and assessment of biological threats that may require swift intervention by the international public health community [46]. Social disruption is a deviation from a routine daily activity that can be tracked and used in lieu of direct reporting of diseases [45]. With over 200 social disruption parameters, the model was created by conducting more than 60 in-depth retrospective case studies for socially disruptive biological events affecting animals and humans, and has been operationally validated against over 20,000 prospective biological events detected and tracked to-date [45].",

MiTAP aims at providing timely, multilingual, global information access to analysts, medical experts and individuals involved in humanitarian assistance and relief work [12]. The system collects, annotates and categorizes documents from multiple open news sources, including foreign sources both in English and native languages that MiTAP translates into English before processing [12]. MiTAP architecture has three phrases: (1) information capture, (2) information processing, and (3) user interface [12]. The information capture process supports Web sources, electronic mailing lists, newsgroups, news feeds, and audio/video data. The information processing is carried out by the Alembic natural language analyzer [2], [3] using machine-learned rules and WebSumm [27] to generate a summary for each document. MiTAP consists of a number of different user interfaces to the processed data. The core MiTAP system provides two methods of access: via newsgroups and a web-based search facility. The user-based design approach and the integration of human language components have made the MiTAP system a success [12].",

Data are acquired automatically every hour and characterized via text mining to determine the disease category and location of the outbreak [6]. Currently alerts are geocoded to the country scale with province-, state-, or city-level resolution for select countries. Once processed, the outbreak data is visualized on an interactive world map for user-friendly access to the original reports. Users can choose among various information sources. In addition, users can look at all diseases, or the ones they are most interested in. The alerts then appear as flags on the map. By clicking on each of them, users can get the headline and a link to the full story.",

To alleviate the problem, Web crawler programs are often used.

This process repeats with the new pages offering more hyperlinks to follow, until a sufficient number of pages are fetched or a certain higher level objective is reached [34]. To search for important information in a specific domain, vertical search engines are often used by keeping indexes only in that domain [10]. The Web crawler programs used in vertical search engines are selective about the pages fetched and ensure as best as possible that these are relevant to the initiating topics. In Web crawler programs, adding intelligence (heuristics) into crawling strategies can help improve the performance of collecting relevant and important Web pages [34]. Table 3\nshows various studies on different intelligence (heuristics) including: best first search, genetic algorithm, reinforcement learning, evolutionary algorithm, Neural Networks, Na\u00efve Bayesian, SVM, PageRank algorithm, etc.",

A simple way to transform a text document into a feature vector is by using a Bag of Words representation, where each feature is a single token [23]. In the Bag of Words representation, the semantically empty stop-words need to be removed and the remaining terms are used as the textual representation. Such subset of terms building upon Bag of Words can get the main concepts of an article [32]. The Bag of Words representation has been widely used because of its simple nature and ability to produce a suitable representation of the text [38]. However, sometimes the word-based representation of content is imprecise. It suffers from noise issues associated with seldom-used terms as well as problems of scalability where immense computational power is required for large datasets [37]. An improved representational system which addresses a majority of these shortcomings is Noun Phrases. This representation retains only the nouns and noun phrases within a document and has been found to adequately represent the important article concepts [42], [43]. As a consequence, this technique uses fewer terms and can handle article scaling better than Bag of Words [37]. A third representational technique is Named Entities, an extension of Noun Phrases. It functions by selecting the proper nouns of an article that fall within well-defined categories. This process uses a semantic lexical hierarchy [41] as well as a syntactic/semantic tagging process [28] to assign candidate terms to categories. Selected categorical definitions are prescribed by the Message Understanding Conference (MUC-7) Information Retrieval task, and they encompass the entities of date, location, money, organization, percentage, person, and time. This method allows for better generalization of previously unseen terms [37].",

However, not all the features are necessary to learning the concept of interest. Many of them may be noisy or redundant and feeding all these features into a model often results in over fitting and poor predictions [29]. Therefore feature selection that aims at identifying a minimal-sized subset of features relevant to the target concept can be applied [13]. The objective of feature selection is threefold: improving the prediction accuracy, providing faster and more cost-effective prediction, and providing a better understanding of the underlying process that generated the data [22], [43]. A feature selection method generates different candidates from the feature space and assesses them based on some evaluation criterion to find the best feature subset [22]. Each feature selection method contains two parts: the evaluation criterion and the generation procedure of candidates. The evaluation criterion is used to assess the goodness of features or feature subsets, and the generation procedure determines how to explore different candidates to find the optimal ones. Graph-based search algorithms are often used to find the optimal features [22].",

The advantages of the machine learning approach include effectiveness, considerable savings of expert labor, and straightforward portability to different domains [40]. A number of studies have documented the relative merits of text classification algorithms. Well known algorithms with good performance reported in the literature include: K-nearest neighbour (KNN), learn Bayesian net (LBN), Na\u00efve Bayesian (NB), support vector machine (SVM), etc. Using feature selection in text classification can help to select a condensed subset of more relevant features from the initial set to classify future documents [24].

CFS uses a subset evaluation heuristic which assigns high scores to subsets containing attributes that are highly correlated with the class and have low inter-correlation with each other. Hall and Holmes [17] compared the performance of six feature evaluation methods including Correlation-based Feature Selection (CFS), Information Gain Attribute Ranking (IG), Relief (RLF), Principal Components (PC), Consistency-Based Subset Evaluation (CNS), and Wrapper Subset Evaluation (WRP) in the classification on 15 standard machine learning data sets from the University of California, Irvine (UCI) collection. The study showed that CFS performed consistently well on different data sets and suggested that CFS is a good overall performer. In addition, CFS chose fewer features and therefore performed faster. Since we did not intend to compare different feature evaluation methods, we chose CFS for our feature evaluation.",

Specifically, in most cases, FeatureBFS\u2013Comb had higher evaluation values than FeatureBFS\u2013BW, and FeatureSFS\u2013Comb had higher evaluation values than FeatureSFS-BW.

The results showed that the combined feature subsets including Bag of Words, Noun Phrases, and Named Entities features outperformed the Bag of Words feature subsets.

            "text": "This study has made several contributions. First, we propose a general framework for building an automatic, infectious disease specific news monitoring and classification system for syndromic surveillance, which is becoming increasingly critical for protecting the public's health but has received little investigative attention. The well known existing news-based syndromic surveillance systems are based on general infectious diseases instead of a specific disease. Our approach focusing on automatic monitoring and classifying online news for a specific disease provides an informative point of departure for continued research. With such a framework, we can automatically gather a particular infectious disease related news from the Web and organize the information into different categories, thus providing accurate and timely information to health providers. Therefore, we believe such a unique framework is important and beneficial to researchers interested in syndromic surveillance, especially on infectious diseases. Second, the techniques used to develop the framework are based on the algorithms which have consistently reported the best performances. In order to identify what kind of document representation approach works best for classifying online news articles, which machine learning algorithm yields better classification results, and how feature selection improves the classification performance for syndromic surveillance, we examine different high-performance algorithms. None of the techniques have been previously used in the context of syndromic surveillance on infectious diseases. In addition, we demonstrate the viability of using our proposed framework to automatically monitor and classify FMD related online news. The automatic approach is much more advantageous than the labor-intensive and time-consuming way of monitoring and classifying FMD related online news manually done in the FMD Lab at UC-Davis; therefore, alleviates the burden caused by the manual work of the FMD Lab. Besides FMD, this general framework can be applied to automatically monitor and classify online news related to other particular diseases. Thus, the current study provides important guidance and implications for future infectious disease specific classification component development for syndromic surveillance systems.",

For the news monitoring component, we first used Web crawler programs to collect all the news Web pages from the online sources and then used keyword filtering to identify the FMD related news from the large collection. However, adding intelligence (heuristics) into crawling strategies could be more effective and efficient than keyword filtering in collecting relevant and important FMD news Web pages. To evaluate our news classification component, we used a set of FMD related online news provided by the FMD Lab as our testbed instead of using the news gathered by our monitoring component, because this set of FMD news has the category information assigned by domain experts; thus, can be used to calculate the evaluation metrics. However, these news items may be cleaner with fewer noises than the news gathered by the automatic monitoring component. Thus, this may lead to better classification results in our experiment. In the future, we will use the news gathered by the automatic news monitoring component to test our classification component. In addition, we only focus on English news sources in this study. However, due to the globalization and mobility nature of infectious diseases, some important and timely news, especially the outbreak news may be reported in other languages. Future research could extend to incorporate multilingual processing component to deal with important news sources in other languages. However, even in its current state, the empirical evidence clearly indicates that our proposed framework for building an automatic, infectious disease specific news monitoring and classification system for syndromic surveillance represents a solid foundation upon which to build more advanced automatic, infectious disease specific syndromic surveillance systems.",
