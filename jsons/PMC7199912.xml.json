It is crucial to minimise contacts and to reduce the complexity of radiation treatments where possible to optimise the workforce, keeping intact the effectiveness of the interventions.4 Radiation and systemic therapy modifications should be implemented depending on local circumstances.5 A general guiding principle should include approaches where clinical equivalence supported by trials testing de-escalation strategies is present even without level 1\u20132 evidence (box 1, bullet points 1).3 Patients with cancer have an intrinsic degree of frailty and therefore are prone to covid-19 complications. Age and comorbidities have been reported as independent risk factors for poor outcome during covid-19 infection and, of note, more than half of cancer patients are elderly and have significant comorbidities (box 1, bullet points 2).6 Hence, an appropriate evaluation of the risk-benefit of radiation therapy treatments is cogent. Urgent cases and non-deferrable treatments (ie, active tumours, spinal cord compression, life threatening bleeding) should be initiated or continued, provided there is full compliance with the safety regulations of local authorities for both patients and staff members. In non-urgent cases, irradiation can be postponed to an extent, depending on the clinical setting and the possibility to offer patients bridging systemic therapies. Whenever radiation therapy is indicated, dose prescription, fractionation and delivery techniques should be adapted, reduced in duration, and optimised (box 1, bullet points 3 and 4).",

Regarding patients with low-grade gliomas and meningiomas, radiation therapy should be postponed or even omitted in the postoperative setting. Patients with high-grade gliomas with significant neurological deficit need to be reviewed on a case-by-case basis in order to assess the appropriateness of surgery. Irradiation might be omitted in methylated glioblastoma patients aged >60 years.10 In any case, moderate and/or ultra-hypofractionated regimens should be considered whenever possible.2 8\u201310",

Suspect infections or onset of symptoms attributable to covid-19 must be promptly notified, reporting and informing all the personnel and/or patients that had direct contacts. Isolation of suspected cases is mandatory, and the execution of repeated nasopharyngeal diagnostic swabbing is needed (box 1, bullet points 7). Hospital meetings, tumour boards and case discussions should be performed remotely. In this sense, the massive use of technology and artificial intelligence (AI) approaches is providing innovative tools, especially for new diagnostic and monitoring solutions for clinicians facing the epidemic in daily activity. Promising results have been obtained from AI applications for CT imaging-based diagnosis, and several e-health applications (eg, multidimensional data collection apps, video consultation platforms, virtual meeting tools) are spreading to ensure cancer care continuity, avoiding unnecessary physical contacts between patients and healthcare professionals and other hospital personnel (box 1, bullet points 8).14",
