            "text": "Background. Nipah belongs to the genus Henipavirus and the Paramyxoviridae family. It is an endemic most commonly found at South Asia and has first emerged in Malaysia in 1998. Bats are found to be the main reservoir for this virus, causing disease in both humans and animals. The last outbreak has occurred in May 2018 in Kerala. It is characterized by high pathogenicity and fatality rates which varies from 40% to 70% depending on the severity of the disease and on the availability of adequate healthcare facilities. Currently, there are no antiviral drugs available for NiV disease and the treatment is just supportive. Clinical presentations for this virus range from asymptomatic infection to fatal encephalitis. Objective. This study is aimed at predicting an effective epitope-based vaccine against glycoprotein G of Nipah henipavirus, using immunoinformatics approaches. Methods and Materials. Glycoprotein G of the Nipah virus sequence was retrieved from NCBI. Different prediction tools were used to analyze the epitopes, namely, BepiPred-2.0: Sequential B Cell Epitope Predictor for B cell and T cell MHC classes II and I. Then, the proposed peptides were docked using Autodock 4.0 software program. Results and Conclusions. The two peptides TVYHCSAVY and FLIDRINWI have showed a very strong binding affinity to MHC class I and MHC class II alleles. Furthermore, considering the conservancy, the affinity, and the population coverage, the peptide FLIDRINWIT is highly suitable to be utilized to formulate a new vaccine against glycoprotein G of Nipah henipavirus. An in vivo study for the proposed peptides is also highly recommended.",

            "text": "Nipah virus (NiV) is an RNA virus that belongs to the genus Henipavirus within the family Paramyxoviridae and has first emerged in Malaysia in 1998, gaining its name from a village called Sungai Nipah where it was isolated from the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of one of the patients [1] [2] [3] [4] . NiV is transmitted zoonotically (from bats to humans, or from bats to pigs, and then to humans) as well as human-to-human routes. Its clinical presentation varies from asymptomatic (subclinical) infection to acute respiratory illnesses and fatal encephalitis in most of the patients who has been in direct contact with infected pigs. It has also been found that the virus causes central nervous system illnesses in pigs and respiratory illnesses in horses resulting in a significant economic loss for farmers [1, [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] . Large fruit bats of the genus Pteropus seem to act as a natural reservoir of NiV based on the isolation of Hendra virus which has showed the presence of neutralizing antibodies to the Hendra virus on the bats [10, 11] . Although, there are no more cases of NiV in Malaysia, several outbreaks have been frequently occurring in India, Bangladesh, Thailand, and Cambodia [12] . The case fatality rate ranges from 50% to 100%, making it one of the deadliest viruses known to infect humans [3, 13, 14] .",

IgG and IgM antibody detection can be done after recovery to confirm Nipah virus infection. Immunohistochemistry on tissues collected during an autopsy can also confirm the disease [15, 16] . Currently, there are no effective treatments for the Nipah virus infection. Therefore, a few precautions should be followed such as practicing standard infection control, barrier nursing to avoid the spread of the infection from person to person, and the isolation of those suspected to have the infection [7, 8, 17] . Recent computational approaches have provided further information about viruses, including the study conducted by Badawi M et al. on Zika virus, where the envelope glycoprotein was obtained using protein databases. The most immunogenic epitope for the T and B cells involved in cell-mediated immunity was previously analyzed [18] . The main focus of the analysis was the MHC class I potential peptides using in silico analysis techniques [19, 20] . In this study, the same techniques were applied to keep MHC classes I and II along with the world population coverage as our main focus. Furthermore, in this study, we aimed to design an epitope-based peptide vaccine against Nipah virus using peptides of its glycoprotein G as an immunogenic part to stimulate a protective immune response [3] .",

            "text": "Nipah virus invades host cells by the fusion of the host cell membranes at an optimal physiological pH for cleavage without requiring viral endocytosis. Cell-cell fusion is a pathological lineament of Nipah virus infections, resulting in a cell-to-cell spread, inflammation, and destruction of endothelial cells and neurons [21] . Both Nipah virus entry and cell-cell fusion require concerted efforts of the attachment of glycoprotein G and fusion (F) glycoprotein. Upon receptor binding, Nipah virus glycoprotein G triggers a conformational cascade in Nipah virus glycoprotein F that executes a viral and/or a cell membrane fusion [22] . Due to the potency of glycoprotein G over F, we have considered this incident to be the target of this study. There are a lot of challenges regarding the development of peptide-based vaccines, and therefore, we have decided to study and propose a new vaccine against the Nipah virus, since they make a helpful alternative strategy that relies on the usage of short peptide fragments to induce immune responses [23] [24] [25] [26] . Antigenic epitopes from single proteins may not be really necessary, whereas some of these epitopes may even be detrimental to the induction of protective immunity. This logic has created an interest in peptide vaccines and especially those containing only epitopes that are capable of inducing desirable T cell-and B cell-mediated immune responses. Less than 20 amino acid sequences make up the peptides used in such vaccines, which are then synthesized to form an immunogenic peptide molecule. These molecules represent a specific epitope of an antigen. These vaccines are also capable of inducing immunity against different strains of a specific pathogen by forming noncontiguous and immunodominant epitopes that are usually conserved in the strains of the pathogen [27] .",

            "text": "The production of peptide vaccines is extremely safe and cost-effective, especially when they are compared to conventional vaccines. Traditional vaccines that prevent emerging infectious diseases (EIDs) are very difficult to produce because they require the need to culture pathogenic viruses in vitro. However, epitope-based peptide vaccines do not require any means of in vitro culturing which makes them biologically safe, allowing a large scale of bioprocessing to be carried out rapidly and economically. Finally, their selectivity allows a precise activation of the immunological responses by means of selecting immunodominant and conserved epitopes [25, 28] . The complexity of an epitope-based peptide vaccines' design depends largely on the properties of its carrier molecules' reactogenicity as well as its allergenicity [29, 30] . When it comes to the selection of epitopes, it is based on the analysis of the B cells, cytotoxic T cells, and the induction of the helper T cells. Then, it is important to identify the epitopes capable of activating T cells vital for stimulating a protective immunity. One of the issues concerning peptide vaccines representing T cells in a human population and that are highly MHC-heterogeneous is to identify the highly conserved immunodominant epitopes that are considered to be among a broad spectrum of vaccines due to their ability to work against multiple serovars of pathogens [30] . In this study, we have used a variety of bioinformatics tools for the prediction of epitopes along with the population coverage and epitope selection algorithms, including the translocation of peptides into MHC class I and MHC class II. [32] were then used to analyze the candidate epitopes.",

It is well known that a better immune response depends on whether or not the recognition of epitopes by HLA molecules with significant affinity is successful.
