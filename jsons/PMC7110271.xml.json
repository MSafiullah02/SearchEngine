U-HR-CT has both a detector element and X-ray tube focus size smaller than those in conventional CT [8]. At the same time, a deep learning reconstruction (DLR) algorithm can reduce noise. Based on these new techniques, a larger matrix size of 1024 \u00d7 1024 and thinner slice thickness of 0.25 mm can be achieved within a standard radiation dose. In U-HR-CT, the terminal bronchioles in the normal lungs can be identified, especially in the subpleural region; therefore, the Reid\u2019s secondary lobules, which are approximately equal in size\u2014about 1 cm\u2014can be recognized throughout the whole lung. Based on this assumption, we believe that U-HR-CT can easily detect local alveolar collapse.",

Throat swabs of all patients tested positive for COVID-19 using real-time fluorescence polymerase chain reaction (PCR). CT was performed 5\u20137 days after onset of symptoms. Two patients had no symptom. Oxygen saturation (SaO2) was more than 95% during the CT examinations in all patients.

Two expert radiologists analyzed the U-HR-CT images using a workstation with a 1 K display monitor (ZIO station 2, Ziosoft, Inc, Tokyo, Japan) that provided multi-planar reconstruction images promptly. The radiologists consensually evaluated the distribution and hallmarks (ground-glass opacity [GGO], consolidation, linear opacity, crazy paving) of the lung opacities, and the presence of local lung volume loss. The \u201ccrazy paving pattern\u201d is characterized was defined by as the reticular interlobular septa thickening within the patchy GGO.
