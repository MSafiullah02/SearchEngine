This concept of unity, of which Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire was the defender in the middle of the nineteenth century, is evidenced, for example, by the construction of proteins from a list determined once and for all of 20 amino acids, by the similarities of metabolic pathways and biophysical processes, and of course by the universal genetic code. The ability of a transposon to insert foreign DNA, the ability for bacteria to invade animal tissues, the ability of Toxoplasma (protozoan) to manipulate the behavior of a rodent, and the possibility of limitless pairwise interactions are all further evidence that life probably arose only once, or at least only the descendants of a particular life form survived (cf. Sect. 10.1007/978-94-017-9118-2_2#Sec1). For example, any pathogen and its host share a common ancestor. The result is that signals can be exchanged between organisms whose common ancestor existed billions of years ago, and this might explain why a pathogen can use and manipulate to his advantage the biochemical processes of its host. What has changed throughout evolution is the complexity of organisms, but not the basis for their functioning or the nature of the molecular signaling pathways: this could only facilitate the establishment of multiple interactions (Table 11.1).\n",

Food chains and webs in ecosystems are essentially based on these two types of organisms, typically referred to as primary producers (comprising also chemoautotrophic bacteria such as nitrifiers) and consumers, respectively, as well as on microbial decomposers. These food webs involve several types of conflictual interactions.",

Competition* is an interaction in which partners use the same resource, whether nutrients, water, or even space. Intraspecific competition can be particularly intense, when the partners involved have needs that are very close and use comparable if not identical means for the resource acquisition. Competition can also occur between individuals belonging to different trophic levels, and even different kingdoms, such as the competition for nitrate between plant roots and microorganisms in soil.",

It corresponds to interference competition*, which relies on chemical warfare mechanisms, to be distinguished from competition by exploitation. The distinction between the two types of competition is sometimes difficult to establish. Another difficulty lies in the distinction between interference competition and another conflictual interaction, amensalism*. Amensalism (synonym of antagonism) is an interaction that has a negative effect on one partner but no effect on the other. Amensalism assumes that the two species do not compete significantly with each other. Amensalism is based on a physical or chemical modification of the environment and, in the latter case, often involves the release of toxic compounds. Thus, the production of antibiotics (i.e., antibiosis) may correspond to interference competition or antagonism, depending on the nature of the partner affected and on the energy invested in the synthesis of these secondary metabolites. Allelopathy, i.e., the synthesis by a higher organism of compounds bioactive on another higher organism, is conceptually close to antibiosis and deserves to be mentioned in this chapter because microorganisms can metabolize some of these compounds and thus interfere with the interaction.",

            "text": "Finally, there are two types of conflictual interactions for which the interaction is negative for one partner but beneficial for the other, i.e., predation and parasitism. Predation* is of short duration (a cat that eats a mouse or a protozoan that feeds on a bacterium) and usually leads to destruction of the genetic information of the prey (in this case the mouse or the bacterium). Parasitism* is sustained in time (the parasite in its host) and the genetic informations of the partners remain in intimate contact over time; here we recognize the traditional distinction between predator\u2013prey and parasite\u2013host relationships. The predator is free, while the parasite is physically associated with its host, at least for part of its life cycle. It should be noted that the importance of signals is very different in the two types of interactions. When a cat chases a mouse, signals are visual, auditory, or olfactory, and they last only the duration of the hunt. When a virus or bacterium settles in a host, the exchange of molecular signals can persist for months or years, for example, involving the immune system of the host and processes by which pathogens circumvent these defenses. One of the most amazing aspects of these sustainable interactions is manipulation: Toxoplasma are parasitic protozoa whose complex life cycle requires them, when they are in a rodent, to pass into a cat to perform their sexual reproduction; Toxoplasma settles in the nerve cells of the rodent and induces in them a suicidal attraction to cats, as well as altered social behavior. Although we do not know the precise mechanisms involved, it is clear that this manipulation of rodent behavior must rely on biochemical compounds produced by Toxoplasma. The more research is done on it, the more manipulation appears to be widespread \u2013 the result of natural selection \u2013 in pathogen\u2013host interactions.",

This term has quickly gained popularity and has been applied in 1885 to mycorrhizae and in 1889 to nodules induced by Rhizobium on peas by the German botanist Albert Bernhard Frank (1885, 1889) who would prove to be an effective proselytizer of the word. Root nodules form following sophisticated molecular dialogues and are inhabited by nitrogen-fixing Actinobacteria (Frankia; Box Fig. 11.1) or Proteobacteria (Rhizobium and many other taxa), depending on the type of plant partner.\n",

Arms races represent one of the fundamental drivers of evolution, because selective pressures that organisms exert on each other remain the sine qua non of evolutionary change. In a 1973 paper, the American evolutionist Leigh Van Valen gave for this driver of evolution an explanation known as the Red Queen hypothesis, which has become a classic (Fig. 11.2). He suggested that changes constantly generate new adaptations to meet adaptations in the competing species; if species share, even partially, the same spatial or energy resources, and if one of them increases its fitness, the other species have then to compensate for this adaptive advantage or else will disappear. Species that adapt will in turn modify the fitness of the others; and so forth, says Van Valen, life is in a self-sustaining perpetual movement.\n",

One of them, particularly formidable, is their very short generation time, inherited from the early ages of life, which can lead to high production of individuals with mutated genes. In contrast, hosts of microbial parasites must compose with one major constraint that evolution has imposed onto multicellular organisms, i.e., their long generation time. Indeed, the advent of multicellularity was accompanied by increased body size, which resulted also, inevitably, in longer generation time. While the time between two divisions, thus opportunities for mutations and selection, is sometimes counted in minutes in bacteria, many multicellular organisms only acquire the ability to reproduce, and thus to mutate, after several years (somatic mutations that arise during development and postembryonic life are not transmitted and are thus useless for evolution). This issue is discussed by Ochman and Wilson (1987). They argue that replication is not the only time when mutations occur; instead these may occur at any time over the lifespan of organisms. They conclude that mutations generally take place at constant rates, independently of generation time, which of course is not always true, as, for instance, stressful situations lead to the emergence of hypermutator clones (Foster 2007).",

This interaction is often described as predation, but corresponds rather to parasitism because it is a lasting interaction, with several cell doublings of Bdellovibrio while inside the periplasm of the target cell. In fact, this bacterium should more accurately be called parasitoid since it leads to the death of the host. The small deltaproteobacterium B. bacteriovorus consumes motile cells belonging to many Gram-negative taxa. It starts by entering the periplasm and sealing the pore entrance and then replicates in the periplasm, yielding daughter cells without flagella that will invade all the cell space. Thereafter, Bdellovibrio hydrolyzes cell constituents, forms filamentous cells that become septate, lyses the host cell, and releases flagellated offsprings. This way of life and the lack of attack on mammalian cells have even led some to consider the use of Bdellovibrio for the treatment of infections in humans (Stolp and Starr 1963). The genus was divided to yield Bacteriovorax to accommodate marine strains physiologically distinct and thereafter Peredibacter starrii, but all these genera are phylogenetically very close to each other.\n",

The presence of an antibiotic is not necessarily detrimental for a given taxon, either because it has acquired genes permitting its degradation, and thus to feed on it, or a mutation has occurred in the genes whose product is the antibiotic target (Birge and Kurland 1969).

For a single organism, cometabolism is the transformation of a compound that cannot serve as sole carbon and energy source (i.e., a non-growth substrate), which is made possible by parallel degradation of a growth substrate. We also speak of cometabolism when several microorganisms must cooperate as a consortium to synthesize all the enzymes necessary for a catabolic pathway. This is the case of soil isolates individually unable to metabolize polycyclic aromatic compounds, but which are able to do so when they are grown in a consortium (Bouchez et al. 1999). It is likely that this consortium includes strains able to compensate for the inhibition caused by a metabolic intermediate by degrading it or when the product of a strain is used as a substrate by a different strain.",

Anaerobic degradation of saturated fatty acids and aromatic acids in the absence of a terminal electron acceptor necessitates the presence of an organism capable of maintaining a hydrogen partial pressure low enough so that these reactions are thermodynamically possible. We therefore find it associated with hydrogenotrophic microorganisms such as Desulfovibrio or the archeon Methanospirillum hungatei (cf.

These two organisms are closely nested into one another and cannot be cultured separately. Another interesting case concerns Symbiobacterium thermophilum (Firmicute) (Watsuji et al. 2006), which cannot be cultivated in the absence of a Bacillus sp. Both thermophilic bacteria are found in composts. Bacillus sp. provides S. thermophilum with CO2 from its respiration, which allows S. thermophilum to compensate for the absence of a carbonic anhydrase, an enzyme that allows different processes such as photosynthesis, respiration, pH homeostasis, and ion transport. It also catabolizes indolic compounds, which are self-inhibitors to S. thermophilum. The advantage for the Bacillus sp. is not clear; it may simply be a situation of commensalism or catabolism of recalcitrant compounds found in the compost.",

The best-known case is that of antibiotic treatment in a medium comprising more than one microbial taxon, where initially most bacteria are sensitive to a compound to which they have never been in contact. Mutants resistant to this antibiotic will proliferate. Finally, the DNA fragment conferring resistance to the antibiotic may be transferred to sensitive cells of the same taxon or belonging to a remote taxon. One of the first described cases of transfer of resistance genes took place in Birmingham, England, in 1960. A care unit for burn victims found waves of nosocomial infections starting initially with Klebsiella aerogenes resistant to carbenicillin and carrying a resistance plasmid (RK2), followed by a second wave of Pseudomonas aeruginosa also carrying a closely related resistance plasmid. It has been shown that this phenomenon involved conjugative plasmid transfer (Ingram et al. 1973). Such cases of transfer of antibiotic resistance genes are common nowadays; they threaten our ability to curb infections and are one of the public health problems of greatest concern (Fig. 11.6).\n",

Depending on their location on/in plants, these microorganisms will be exposed to contrasting environmental conditions. A difference can be made between the root system and aerial parts. Microorganisms at the surface of aerial parts are confronted to fluctuating microclimatic situations, and they may be exposed to stressful conditions in particular with regard to desiccation and ultraviolet radiations (Kinkel et al. 2000). In addition, organic exudates are released in smaller quantities by leaves than by roots (Lucas and Sarniguet 1998; Leveau and Lindow 2001). Microorganisms colonizing aboveground plant surfaces are called epiphytes. Microbial numbers on leaves depend on the plant species, with densities in the order of 105\u20137 bacteria per cm2 (i.e., 105\u20138 per g fresh weight) and 104 fungal propagules per cm2 (Kinkel et al. 2000; Lindow and Brandl 2003). The stems can also be colonized by microorganisms, but at lower levels. It is especially documented for nitrogen-fixing bacteria, such as photosynthetic Bradyrhizobium that induce stem nodules on Aeschynomene (Wong et al. 1994) and Frankia on Casuarina equisetifolia (Prin et al. 1991).",

They can reach high numbers, in the order of 108\u20139 bacteria per g and 100\u2013150 cm fungal hyphae per cm2 root surface (Cavagnaro et al. 2005). These numbers are modulated by the amount of available organic substrates, which are mainly released by growing roots during the vegetative growth of the plant (Nguyen 2003) and by deleterious interactions (including competition between microorganisms and predation by protozoa). Microbial populations well adapted to the rhizosphere produce compounds (such as phytohormones, nitric oxide, or 2,4-diacetylphloroglucinol) that stimulate root growth and/or exudation, thereby amplifying the rhizosphere effect (Bonkowski 2004) (Fig. 11.8).\n",

The quantitative importance of root systems varies depending on pedoclimatic and plant community properties, with root densities up to 100\u2013200 cm roots per cm3 of soil and roots occupying typically 1\u20135 % of the soil volume. However, most exchanges between the plant and the soil, both in terms of nutrients/water acquisition and rhizodeposition, occur at root tips (Cardon and Whitbeck 2007). Rhizosphere microbial populations are thus higher in the root elongation and root hair zones compared with the root cap (Cardon and Whitbeck 2007). Cell differentiation is accompanied by a decrease in the permeability of plant cell walls, and therefore older root parts are rather involved in sap transport. In the case of aerial parts, microbial numbers depend on leaf position and age, and they are often higher on the lower side of leaves (Kinkel et al. 2000). Whether on roots or leaves, microbial growth is stimulated following lysis of plant cells resulting from attacks by phytoparasites.",

Biofilms occur particularly at the junction of epidermal cells, at wounds, and (for aerial parts) at stomata, hydathodes, and along veins (Beattie and Lindow 1999). Biofilm distribution becomes more erratic on older leaves (Leben 1988) and root tissues (L\u00fcbeck et al. 2000). Biofilms, which include the mucigel matrix in the case of roots, can be several tens of micrometers thick (Fig. 11.7c). Their buildup reflects the availability of nutrients (Leveau and Lindow 2001), and by comparison with other types of environments, their development level is intermediate (phyllosphere) to high (rhizosphere) (Wimpenny and Colasanti 1997).",

Microorganisms present in the plant are found in the cortex, more rarely in the stele (vascular cylinder). They often have intercellular localization, but some (often parasites or symbionts) may be within plant cells (Fig. 11.7). In the case of fungi, the mycelium is either entirely in the plant or only partly within the plant, as in the case of ectomycorrhizal fungi (Brundrett 2009). It should be noted that certain mycorrhizal fungi harbor bacteria, forming multitrophic associations (Bertaux et al. 2003). Microorganisms present in the plant but that do not lead to physiological dysfunctions (as pathogens do) or host differentiation (as bacterial symbionts nodulating roots do) are termed endophytes. The plant tissues provide particular environmental conditions, inasmuch as microorganisms have direct access to available substrates in the plant, while being directly exposed to defense mechanisms of the host. The microbial numbers in the plant are generally low (102\u20135 bacteria per g), except for some endophytic bacteria (up to 108 per g) and especially symbionts and parasites, when they are engaged in a successful interaction with the host (McInroy and Kloepper 1995; Gamboa et al. 2003).",

They can find themselves in contact with plants if they are present in an area of the soil that is penetrated by a root. However, many terrestrial microorganisms have the ability to actively come into contact with seeds or roots, through a process of chemotaxis (for bacteria) or chemotropism (for fungi) triggered by the perception of plant exudates (Bais et al. 2006). Terrestrial microorganisms in contact with plants will mostly be associated to the root system, but some may colonize plant shoots or fruits. This situation is mainly documented for pathogens, including fungi such as Fusarium spp. (Deuteromycetes) that produce mycotoxins (Leplat et al. 2013).",

Precipitations also lead to runoff events along the aerial parts of the plants and the soil surface. This runoff will lead to a redistribution of some phyllospheric microorganisms. The presence of microorganisms in the atmosphere can be explained by the formation of aerosols, i.e., microdroplets, which originate from liquid phases that are turbulent or that face convection, e.g., by wind. This presence can also be explained by the transportation, caused by wind or air currents, of microorganisms or microparticles colonized by microorganisms, including for resting stages such as many fungal spores (Savage et al. 2012).",

The level of hydrophobicity of the root surface (and thus its contact properties) may vary depending on the plant considered. Root growth results in the creation of a root-based soil macroporosity, which leads to compaction of the rhizospheric soil. It is also in the rhizosphere that diffusion of soluble rhizodeposits occurs, resulting in stimulation of microbial populations. Insoluble rhizodeposits render the mucigel gelatinous, which facilitates adhesion between root and soil particles. The mucigel also affects water movement in the rhizosphere, thereby modulating the availability of water to roots.",

Plant nutrition requires selective uptake of mineral nutrients by roots, which leads to accumulation and sometimes also precipitation (e.g., calcium carbonate or iron oxide) of excess constituents and especially depletion for metabolized nutrients (to a larger extent for soluble anions such as nitrate than for poorly soluble anions such as phosphate or for cations) in the rhizosphere. Cations and anions uptake involves parallel excretion of proton or hydroxide anion, respectively, which can lead to local pH change in the rhizosphere (Hinsinger et al. 2003). Finally, root (and microbial) respiration may lead to a decrease in oxygen concentration, with a parallel increase in carbon dioxide content, in particular, when soil is very wet. However, these processes can be offset by the ease of gas exchange in the root macroporosity. This is particularly the case in soils containing swelling clays, which retract during drying. It can be noted that certain plants that thrive in submerged conditions (e.g., rice) can release oxygen through their roots (Liesack et al. 2000). Depending on these factors, the availability of oxygen in the root zone will be lower (most often) or higher than in non-rhizosphere soil.",

The best adapted microorganisms will be thus favored over the others. This selection process is amplified by the molecular dialogues with the plant, including microbial chemotaxis/chemotropism phenomena (cf. Sect. 10.1007/978-94-017-9118-2_9#Sec2) and the ability of certain plants to interfere with bacterial quorum sensing (Bauer and Robinson 2002). Finally, all terrestrial microorganisms are not affected the same way by the antimicrobial compounds produced by the other microorganisms associated with plant (Gilbert et al. 1993; Raaijmakers et al. 2009) and by predation by protozoa (Bonkowski 2004) and nematodes (Jousset et al. 2009). In total, the trophic stimulation of microbial growth by the plant is therefore selective. This usually results in a lower microbial diversity when comparing bulk soil with rhizosphere soil or the surface with the inside of the plant. However, the species diversity of plant-associated microorganisms is important, and many bacterial and fungal taxa have been identified on leaves or roots (Lindow and Brandl 2003; Morris and Monier 2003; Garbeva et al. 2004).",

At the lowest taxonomic levels, especially the intraspecies level, horizontal gene transfer can influence microbial selection. Indeed, plants favor horizontal gene transfer events, including the exchange of conjugative plasmids between bacteria (Bjorklof et al. 2000). Many abiotic and biotic factors modulate microbial selection by the plant, mainly through an effect on plant photosynthetic activity (and hence on exudation). This can be reflected by the occurrence of microbial successions in the rhizosphere, which can be related to host phenology (Garbeva et al. 2004; Mougel et al. 2006). Plant selection processes are also scale dependent. Since both the soil habitat and plant organization/physiology display spatiotemporal heterogeneity, different parts of a same individual plant may display different microbial communities, e.g., from one root microsite to another (Garbeva et al. 2004).",

First, it is believed that certain constituents released by the plant, particularly the seed, may have mutagenic effects (Mich\u00e9 et al. 2003). Second, certain bacteria display phenotypic variation (also termed phase variation), a process often reversible that generates at high frequency several different cell types (e.g., with different mobility patterns) from a single strain (Vial et al. 2006). Phenotypic variation facilitates root colonization of symbiotic and pathogenic bacteria that have this property (Achouak et al. 2004).",

            "text": "Generally, microbial transformations involving heterotrophic/saprophytic microorganisms are strongly stimulated by plants (Cardon and Whitbeck 2007). This is the case for many biodegradation functions for which the substrate comes exclusively/predominantly from plant exudates (Griffiths et al. 2004), as in the case of calystegines (Guntli et al. 1999) and opines, or both from exudates and soil organic matter (organic nitrogen compounds, cellulose, etc.). Substrates not of plant origin such as exogenous aromatic compounds degraded by cometabolism are transformed faster in the rhizosphere (Cardon and Whitbeck 2007). Plants also favor nitrogen fixation (whose energy cost is high) by nonsymbiotic aerobic bacteria (Patra et al. 2007). Conversely, transformations carried out by autotrophic microorganisms (e.g., nitrification) are little affected by the presence of the plant (Patra et al. 2006). Finally, there are transformations that are either stimulated or inhibited by the plant depending on the availability of oxygen and overall redox conditions in the rhizosphere. This is mainly the case of fermentations and anaerobic respirations, e.g., denitrification (Patra et al. 2006), which are favored by the presence of organic rhizodeposits but also require specific redox conditions partly determined by soil structure and soil moisture (Liesack et al. 2000). Redox conditions also modulate aerobic transformations including nitrification (Bohrerova et al. 2004).",

Conversely, necroses and root and crown rots are mainly due to fungi (Thielaviopsis basicola, R. solani), although oomycetes such as A. euteiches are a real obstacle to grow legumes in temperate countries (Persson et al. 1999). White mold of many vegetable crops is caused by Sclerotinia sclerotiorium and leads to general wilting symptoms associated with water-soaked lesions on stems, while sclerotia are formed inside stems. Other fungi such as Fusarium oxysporum and Verticillium dahlia also cause partial or general wilting, but they are tracheomycoses because the fungi are able to penetrate the roots to rapidly reach and colonize the vascular tissues (Olivain et al. 2006).",

Part of P. syringae epiphytes produce IceC membrane protein, which has an ice nucleation activity and promotes frost damage on strawberry (Lindow and Brandl 2003). Some are soil-borne phytopathogenic bacteria and are responsible for vascular disease (Ralstonia solanacearum), soft rot (Pectobacterium carotovorum), or gall (Agrobacterium tumefaciens, Streptomyces scabies). Certain Agrobacterium tumefaciens carry the Ti plasmid that confers them the ability to transfer genes to the plant (Krimi et al. 2002; Tzfira and Citovsky 2006). Phytopathogenic bacteria are often facultative parasites, and an inoculum threshold is generally required for infection (104 cells of P. syringae per g of bean leaf). Some protozoa including Phytomonas are phytopathogens. These trypanosomes are responsible for heart-rot disease of coconut palms, and they can be transmitted back and forth from host plants to insects. Finally, some viruses such as poxvirus cause significant damages, but most of the time, they need vectors to infect their host plants. For instance, parasitic nematodes (e.g., Xiphinema spp.) serve as vectors of viruses such as the grapevine fanleaf virus (GFLV). Moreover, the wound caused by stylet penetration of the parasitic nematodes may also facilitate the plant infection by fungal (Verticillium), oomycete (Phytophthora), or bacterial (Clavibacter michiganense) pathogens. Besides nematodes, the main virus vectors are Hemiptera insects, but some viruses can also be transmitted to the plant by fungi (Olpidium spp.) or protists (Polymyxa betae) or between plants through parasitic plants such as dodder (Agrios 1997).",

The contact of the plant with spores (constituting the primary inoculum) of fungal pathogens involves, as presented above, several environmental factors including wind, water, insects, and microfauna that vectorize the pathogens, but also the biochemical and mechanical infectious potential of these pathogens. Production of fungal mucilage consisting of polysaccharides and/or glycoproteins ensures the adhesion of spores and germ tubes to the plant tissues. Enzymatic hydrolysis of the cuticle surface (U. necator on grapevine) or production of small proteins such as hydrophobins Mgp1 (Magnaporthe grisea on rice) enhances the adhesion of the propagules to the plant (Ebbole 2007). In most cases, there is no specific site of infection on the surface of the plant. Fungi penetrate the aerial part of the plant by piercing the cuticle, growing through the anthesis, exploiting wounds (opportunistic fungi), or growing between the stomata guard cells. The fungal germ tube generally forms an appressorium that is simply a swelling of the tip of the hypha (B. cinerea) or results from cell differentiation (case of rusts) to puncture through plant cell wall using high physical pressure, cell wall degrading enzymes, or both. In the case of pathogenic bacteria too, penetration occurs most often through natural openings, such as nectaries of flowers (E. amylovora), stomata or hydathodes (X. campestris), or wounds (P. syringae). Their lytic enzymes play an important role in virulence (Kazemi-Pour et al. 2004). Quorum sensing is sometimes involved in the infectious process (Smadja et al. 2004). Different types of trophic relationships can then be established. Some fungi such as Venturia inaequalis, responsible for apple scab, establish under the leaf cuticle and use epidermal walls as trophic base thanks to pectinases they produce. Others, such as powdery mildews, exploit the cytoplasm of epidermal cells thanks to a sucker they develop from the surface of the leaf. In rust or mildew agents, colonization of a first cell is followed by the development of secondary hyphae that gradually colonize other cells. Similar strategies are observed among soil-borne fungi and oomycetes when penetrating the plant root and crown. For instance, no specific site of infection was found for F. oxysporum attacking tomato roots (Olivain et al. 2006), and a set of extracellular enzymes is produced by the pathogens to degrade cellulose, hemicelluloses, and pectins of the plant epidermis and parenchyma leading to necroses, generalized rot, or tracheomycoses.",

It is important for plants to recognize and discriminate between them and to be able to respond accordingly. Conversely, it is important for beneficial and pathogenic microbes to modulate the host immune system to establish an intimate relationship or to prevent defense reactions. The plant, for instance, can respond to the presence of pathogens by the production of volatile compounds that will either promote or block microbial development, as for B. cinerea on strawberry (Abanda-Nkpwatt et al. 2006). It now appears that plants rely on the innate immunity of each cell and on systemic signals emanating from the infection site. This immune system allows them to recognize and respond specifically to invading pathogens (Jones and Dangl 2006).",

These microbial elicitors called microbe-associated molecular patterns (MAMPs), also referred to as pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs), are recognized at the surface of the host cell by receptor proteins called pattern recognition receptors (PRRs). MAMPs are basic components of all classes of pathogens. They may be constituents of the wall of the pathogen (exogenous elicitors) that are recognized by receptors. They may also correspond to the constituents of the plant cell wall that are released after degradation by microbial enzymes and recognized by receptors. A number of these common MAMPs and their role in the elicitation process have been recently described (Pel and Pieterse 2013). Recognition by the plant of these non-self compounds is a first step toward an effective immune response. PRRs generally consist of an extracellular leucine-rich repeat (LRR) domain and an intracellular kinase domain. Stimulation of PRRs leads to PAMP-triggered immunity (PTI), which provides a first line of defense against most nonspecific pathogens (Jones and Dangl 2006).",

            "text": "The second line of defense involves recognition by intracellular receptors of pathogen virulence molecules called effectors. The pathogens deliver effectors into the host cell by type III secretion (for bacteria) or using haustoria or other intracellular structures by an unknown mechanism (for fungi and oomycetes) (Dodds and Rathjen 2010). These intracellular effectors often act to suppress PTI. However, many effectors are recognized by intracellular nucleotide-binding (NB)-LRR receptors; these sentry proteins are present at various levels in the plant (wall, cytoplasm, nucleus, cell membrane), and they allow a rapid response upon pathogen intrusion by inducing effector-triggered immunity (ETI). The gene-for-gene interaction takes place in that context (Table 11.2). The pathogen avirulence genes encode the elicitor. Host plant resistance genes corresponding to avirulence gene in the pathogen encode plant receptors recognizing this elicitor. This recognition leads to cascades of defense reactions involving essential metabolic pathways such as the salicylic acid and jasmonic acid pathways, as well as a massive influx of calcium ions into the cell together with potassium and chlorine efflux. Then, alarm signals are transmitted to the interior of the cell inducing the production of oxidizing radicals capable of inhibiting pathogen development. They lead to the activation of defense genes, synthesis of phytoalexins (plant antibiotics), and defense proteins called PR proteins (pathogenesis-related proteins), whose spectrum of activity is broad or narrow (van Loon et al. 2006). Some correspond to chitinases (PR3) and glucanases (PR2), whereas others are poorly known (PR17). To reduce the spread of the pathogen, the plant cell wall thickens (Fig. 11.7e) or, in the case of the hypersensitive response (HR), the infected cell transmits alarm signals to the neighboring cells that then destroy them (apoptosis*). It has to be noted that NB-LRR-mediated disease resistance is effective against pathogens that grow only (obligate biotrophs) or during part of the life cycle (hemibiotrophs) on living host tissue, but not against pathogens that kill host tissues during colonization (necrotrophs) (Jones and Dangl 2006).\n",

In a third step, a given effector is \u201cspecifically recognized\u201d by one of the NB-LRR proteins, which leads to ETI. ETI is an accelerated and amplified PTI response, resulting in disease resistance and, usually, a hypersensitive cell death response at the infection site. At last, on one side, natural selection drives pathogens to avoid ETI by diversifying the recognized effector gene or by acquiring additional effectors that suppress ETI. On the other side, natural selection favors new plant NB-LRR alleles that can recognize one of the newly acquired effectors, resulting again in ETI. Therefore, the interplay between microbial pathogens and plants presents several similarities with the case of animal diseases (cf. Sect. 11.4).",

Fungicides, which represent about 20 % of the pesticides used in agriculture, are ineffective against soil-borne bio-aggressors, and for human health and environmental quality, their use must be reduced. Prophylaxis should be preferred. This involves the regular cleaning of farm machinery and irrigation systems, but also the removal of dead plant matter from fields as well as the management (burial) of crop residues to minimize potential reservoirs for the plant pathogens. Similarly, many pathogens can live on and in seeds. Therefore, seed companies must ensure the quality of plant seeds. Innovative farming practices should be promoted. This includes new rotation schemes (longer and more diverse than the present ones), the use of intermediate crops having sanitizing impact, and appropriate tillage systems to preserve both soil structure and biological activity (multitrophic interactions), so that pathogen populations decline between host plantings. These practices should be combined with the use of resistant cultivars when possible as well as biological control agents if any in given conditions. Based on what was shown previously, these control methods (when used) can only limit the extent of damage (Box 11.2).",

            "text": "Certain bacteria and fungi form a mutualistic symbiosis with plants (Cardon and Whitbeck 2007). Those between bacteria and plants consist mainly of nitrogen-fixing symbioses involving the floating fern Azolla (with the cyanobacterium Anabaena), phylogenetically diverse plants called actinorhizal (with the actinobacterium Frankia), and Fabaceae (with selected alphaproteobacteria, such as Rhizobium, and selected betaproteobacteria) (Mathesius 2003; Huguet et al. 2005). The Rhizobium\u2013Fabaceae dialogue involves molecular signals produced by the plant (including flavonoids) and leads to bacterial synthesis of a lipo-chito-oligosaccharide termed Nod factor, which is a signal inducing root nodulation (Mathesius 2003) (Fig. 11.10a). Host specificity depends largely on the chemical specificity of these two types of signals. In the case of Frankia and of photosynthetic Bradyrhizobium, the bacterial signal involved is different, and indeed their genomes are devoid of canonical nod genes (Giraud et al. 2007; Normand et al. 2007). The Fabaceae nodule is formed by proliferation of cells from the cortex and the pericycle. The bacteria usually enter the plant through root hairs, which are deformed during the interaction, and find themselves in an infection thread of plant origin. This thread enables proliferation and delivery of bacteria to plant cells in the nodule. Once endocytosed by nodule plant cells, the bacteria differentiate into bacteroids but remain separated from the cytoplasm of the plant cell by the peribacteroid membrane. In Medicago truncatula, this transformation into bacteroids is triggered by nodule-specific cysteine-rich peptides resembling antimicrobials from the plant innate immune response (Van de Velde et al. 2010). The peribacteroid membrane and the bacteroid(s) it contains constitute the symbiosome. The nitrogen fixed by the bacteroids will serve as nitrogen source for the plant, which in return provides a source of carbon and energy (25\u201335 ATP necessary for each N2 reduced) in the form of dicarboxylic acids (mainly malate). The nitrogenase is sensitive to oxygen but is protected by low oxygen diffusion within the nodule. The oxygen supply to the bacteroid is provided by leghemoglobin, a carrier of both bacterial (heme) and plant origin (globin). The leghemoglobin allows a high flux of oxygen without the latter reaching a concentration deleterious for the nitrogenase. The nitrogen fixed by the bacteroid is transferred to the plant in the form of ammonia and more rarely alanine. It will be transported in the phloem sap as amides (for temperate Fabaceae, with indeterminate nodules) or ureides (for tropical Fabaceae, with determinate nodules). In the bacterial partner, key genes (over fifty) involved in symbiosis are generally clustered as islands of genes, often plasmid-borne. They may be transferred horizontally, which probably explains their presence in both alphaproteobacteria and betaproteobacteria (Moulin et al. 2001).\n",

The establishment of mycorrhizal symbiosis shows common features with that of bacterial nitrogen-fixing symbioses (Mathesius 2003). Before contact, the mycorrhizal fungus stimulates the production of fine roots to increase the contact sites, secreting hormones including the auxin indole-3-acetic acid (IAA).

In the case of bacteria, this ability is mainly found in plant growth-promoting rhizobacteria* (PGPR) (Fig. 11.11a). PGPR are documented mainly in Proteobacteria and Firmicutes and to a lesser extent in Actinobacteria. Growth stimulation usually results from a combination of direct and indirect phytobeneficial effects (Dobbelaere et al. 2001). Direct phytobeneficial effects may entail improved mineral nutrition of the plant, e.g., via free-living nitrogen fixation or phosphate solubilization (Dobbelaere et al. 2003) and/or improved water uptake through rhizosphere soil structuration by bacterial exopolysaccharides (Amellal et al. 1998) or aquaporin stimulation (Groppa et al. 2012). Interference with plant hormonal metabolism may also be involved, via bacterial production of phytohormones (auxins and cytokinins) and/or bacterial deamination of 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylate (ACC), the ethylene precursor in the plant (Dobbelaere et al. 2003). The auxin indole-3-acetic produced by PGPR helps getting around plant defense mechanisms, thereby facilitating PGPR colonization of the plant (Remans et al. 2006). Finally, phytobeneficial effects also include triggering of systemic resistance in the plant, in particular, induced systemic resistance (ISR) pathways relying on jasmonate and ethylene (van Loon et al. 2006).\n",

Competition can take place for macronutrients (such as organic carbon), micronutrients (such as soluble ferric iron via high-affinity siderophores), and/or infection sites. Antagonism (syn. amensalism) may involve extracellular lytic enzymes (e.g., cellulases, chitinases, proteases), which act on the cell wall of pathogenic microorganisms, their virulence factors (such as fusaric acid from Fusarium oxysporum, degraded by some Burkholderia), or their intercellular signals (such as N-acyl homoserine lactone in Pectobacterium carotovorum) (Raaijmakers et al. 2009). Antagonism may also involve type III secretion system effectors (cf. Sect. 11.4.3) with the ability to reduce the virulence of certain pathogens (Rezzonico et al. 2005). Finally, antagonism can rely on production of antimicrobial secondary metabolites (antibiosis), such as 2,4-diacetylphloroglucinol, and a single antagonistic strain often produces several of these antimicrobial metabolites (Raaijmakers et al. 2009). Some pathogens can defend themselves by suppressing the production of these metabolites (case of 2,4-diacetylphloroglucinol, via fusaric acid from Fusarium) or the expression of genes involved in root colonization by the antagonistic bacterium (Fedi et al. 1997; Raaijmakers et al. 2009).",

Phenylacetic acid, synthesized by Azospirillum brasilense Sp245 and others, is both an auxinic phytohormone and an antimicrobial compound.

Their direct phytobeneficial effects include solubilization of mineral nutrients (Trichoderma and Gliocladium) and the induction of systemic resistance in plants (Trichoderma, Gliocladium, and nonpathogenic F. oxysporum) (Harman et al. 2004). However, indirect phytobeneficial mechanisms are more important. Hyperparasitism toward different phytoparasitic oomycetes and fungi is one of the modes of action of Trichoderma. The fungus coils around its target, e.g., R. solani, and secretes lytic enzymes (chitinases and cellulases) that alter phytoparasite cell wall. The degradation products will allow chemotropism toward the phytoparasite. Physical contact between fungi will trigger external colonization and then penetration of the phytoparasite by Trichoderma. Trichoderma and Gliocladium may also antagonize phytoparasites through the production of antimicrobial secondary compounds (Harman et al. 2004). Finally, competition for trophic resources can be a major mode of action, as in nonpathogenic F. oxysporum (Alabouvette et al. 2006). Overall, as for PGPR, phytobeneficial fungi often display a combination of different modes of action.",

At the scale of a given plant, negative effects of parasitic microorganisms are usually easy to identify, based on observation of disease symptoms. Many other plant-associated microorganisms have positive effects on plant growth or development, but these effects are often more difficult to visualize. Phytobeneficial microorganisms promote plant development primarily by altering plant hormonal balance, while their impact on plant growth may also involve trophic microbial effects. For example, the potential for symbiotic nitrogen fixation is typically in the order of 60\u2013200 kg N/ha/year, for which the plant will invest 3\u201325 % of net photosynthates, versus only 5\u201325 kg N/ha/year for free nitrogen fixation. Nevertheless, the symbiotic nitrogen fixation potential is often poorly exploited in modern agriculture, which relies on massive use of chemical nitrogen fertilizers. Mycorrhization improves plant nutrition in phosphorus and nitrogen, and to a lesser extent in potassium and iron, especially in low-fertility soils (Brundrett 2009). Phosphorus can be recovered by mycorrhizal hyphae at more than 7 cm from the root. Mycorrhizal fungi also improve plant resistance to biotic stress (disease, herbivory; Bennett and Bever 2007) and abiotic stress (drought, metal pollution; Auge 2004).",

In soils that are suppressive to disease, their interactions are sufficient to limit disease severity despite the presence of the pathogen, plant susceptibility to disease, and environmental conditions favorable for infection (Alabouvette et al. 1996; Garbeva et al. 2004). These disease-suppressive soils are documented for root diseases caused by fungi and to a lesser extent by bacteria or nematodes. In some pathosystems, suppressiveness gradually develops during crop monoculture in soils that were initially conducive to the disease. This is the case of wheat take-all caused by Gaeumannomyces tritici; take-all severity increases over the early years of wheat monoculture, reaches a peak (usually in years 4\u20138), and decreases thereafter to minor levels in the following years (Lucas and Sarniguet 1998; Raaijmakers and Weller 1998). In other pathosystems, disease suppressiveness is a natural property of the soil and does not require monoculture, as for soils suppressive to Fusarium wilt (caused by F. oxysporum) (Alabouvette et al. 1996) or to Thielaviopsis black root rot (caused by Thielaviopsis basicola) (Kyselkov\u00e1 et al. 2009). Soil suppressiveness is often attributed to Pseudomonas PGPR subpopulations producing 2,4-diacetylphloroglucinol, although other phytobeneficial microorganisms might also play an important role (Kyselkov\u00e1 et al. 2009).",

Nitrogen-fixing and mycorrhizal symbioses may be important to promote the establishment of pioneer plant groups. This is the case for plant recolonization of ground surfaces following deglaciation (at the end of ice ages or with current global warming), volcanic eruptions, or forest fires (van der Maarel 2005). Pioneer plant species will modify soil microbial community composition/functioning which, in turn, may then influence plant succession and the composition of intermediate groups, both by favoring certain plant species and counterselecting others. Finally, when the climax stage is reached, pathogens adapted to the main plant species may decrease their dominance or eliminate enough individuals to allow re-installation of pioneer species (within forest clearings) and reinitiate plant succession (van der Maarel 2005). In the particular case of invasive plant species, the soil microbial community may facilitate their establishment at the expense of native plants. Plant\u2013microbe interactions are also important for the functioning of plant communities, particularly in terms of recycling of plant litter by microbial decomposers and nitrogen fixation (van der Maarel 2005). Organic matter transformations contribute to pedogenesis and to soil functioning, and as such they impact both on plant growing conditions and plant community successions.",

The goal is to improve crop yield (productivity) and/or reduce chemical inputs (environmental quality). Biofertilizers aim at improving plant mineral nutrition, e.g., symbiotic nitrogen-fixing bacteria (Rhizobium and other genera) and to a lesser extent mycorrhizal fungi. For PGPR having mainly hormonal effects on the plant, the term phytostimulation is used instead of biofertilization. The main phytostimulators used belong to the genus Azospirillum, especially for cereals (0.5\u20131 million ha of corn inoculated each year). Azospirillum inoculation resulted in increased cereal yield (by 10\u201330 %) in two-thirds of the cases (Dobbelaere et al. 2001). Biological control is most often implemented in commercial greenhouse, using bacteria or fungal inoculants. The objective is to protect crops against phytopathogens (often fungi or oomycetes, sometimes bacteria), parasitic nematodes or plants, or weeds. The microorganisms used correspond to Firmicutes (Bacillus), Proteobacteria (Pseudomonas), and Actinobacteria (Streptomyces) for bacteria as well as Deuteromycetes (Trichoderma, Gliocladium, Coniothyrium minitans) for fungi (Gilbert et al. 1993; Harman et al. 2004; Rezzonico et al. 2005). Inoculum formulation is a key issue determining inoculant performance, and spore-forming microorganisms have better storage capacities. The inoculum is often applied to the seed before sowing or in the furrow, more rarely on the soil surface or on the plant during growth. Current regulations on the use of inoculants in agriculture vary greatly from one country to the next (regarding the need for toxicological assessment, proof of effectiveness, guarantee for inoculum level in the product), which can make it expensive in certain countries to develop new microbial products, especially for biological control purposes.",

            "text": "In a broader sense, the biotechnological use of plant\u2013microbe interactions in agriculture also includes the use of plants benefiting from symbiotic nitrogen fixation (Moulin et al. 2001). This is particularly the case of Fabaceae, as forage or cash crops, traditionally used to improve soil fertility, particularly in crop rotations. Some of the Fabaceae are used as green manure, i.e., once grown they are incorporated into soil rather than being harvested. In agroforestry, Fabaceae shrub species and actinorhizal plants (e.g., Casuarina) can be used for alley cropping with herbaceous companion crops. Two other types of nitrogen-fixing symbioses, which do not lead to the formation of nodules, are also important from a biotechnological point of view. One involves aquatic ferns and cyanobacteria, such as the Azolla\u2013Anabaena symbiosis, which can provide in the order of 30\u201360 kg N/ha/year for submerged rice fertilization (Roger et al. 1993). The other is formed by sugarcane and endophytic Proteobacteria such as Gluconacetobacter diazotrophicus. These nitrogen-fixing symbioses may provide up to 100\u2013150 kg N/ha/year, making sugarcane particularly attractive for biofuel production. This crop contributes to atmospheric flux of the greenhouse gas N2O, but much less than other crops (Crutzen et al. 2007). Finally, crop plants are often involved in cooperative interactions with PGPR and/or endophytic fungi. This capacity is of agronomic interest, but it varies depending on plant genotype (Picard and Bosco 2006), and so far it has been largely ignored in crop breeding schemes.",

In the latter case, revegetation (cf.

For some organic pollutants, rhizodeposit availability can promote their biodegradation by the rhizosphere microbial community, whose action may be supplemented by enzymes released by the root. Organic pollutants that can be treated through such rhizoremediation include pesticides, simple hydrocarbons, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) (Rentz et al. 2005). Microbial biodegradation by rhizospheric microorganisms also helps protect the plant from phytotoxic effects of organic pollutants, at the same time promoting site revegetation.",

The T-DNA is transferred in single-stranded form, combined with VirD2 and VirE2 proteins, and is randomly integrated into the nuclear genome of dicotyledonous plants.

Plant\u2013microbe interactions are very diverse, ranging from facultative relationships with minor consequences to obligatory partnership with major evolutionary consequences. The microbial community contributes significantly to the functioning and ecology of the plant partner and to soil quality. Indeed, microorganisms modulate the growth, nutrition, and health of plants. Conversely, plants grow in biotopes where thousands of microbial taxa lead an existence whose focal point is the plant as a source of exudates or litter or as a partner to attack or collaborate with. It is therefore inevitable that plants have evolved and will continue to do so according to the microorganisms interacting with them. Mankind must improve plant growth to meet the global challenge of feeding billions of people in a changing environment and to do so must better integrate the constraints and benefits of plant\u2013microbe interactions. In the field of agronomy, this concerns in particular the principles of crop breeding schemes, cultivation techniques, and the development of ecological engineering approaches in cropping systems.",

            "text": "Man and animals, whether vertebrate or invertebrate, live in environments (air, water, soil) constantly populated by microorganisms consisting mainly of bacteria, fungi, protozoa, and viruses. Such cohabitation usually leads to more or less intimate associations between microorganisms and animals. Spatial proximity, contact time, and the degree of dependence between the interacting partners influence the type and evolution of these associations. Microorganisms use animals as habitats in which they live and from which they retrieved nutrients necessary for their multiplication. They colonize the outlying areas, such as the surface of the skin or mucous membranes, and can penetrate the tissues and organs of host animals. Some microorganisms can colonize the cytoplasm of germ cells, oocytes, and sperm and are thus subject to possible vertical transmission (from parents to offsprings), which can allow a greater ability to spread among host population. The presence and activities of microorganisms will affect development, reproduction, and survival of host animals. The nature of the effects caused by microorganisms and the animal responses to these infections are very diverse and are part of a continuum from parasitism to mutualism (Buchner 1965). Whatever the outcome of the interaction (neutral, beneficial, or deleterious), animals respond to infection by implementing defense systems, either by inducing immune responses or setting up physical barriers to prevent or limit the spread of microorganisms considered as potentially infectious agents. In parallel, microorganisms develop strategies to circumvent the defenses of animals by manipulation host traits or molecular mimicry. It is the trade-off between cost and benefits, that is to say, the balance of the association in terms of adaptive value, which defines the type of interaction (Moran 2007). Knowledge and understanding of the interactions between microorganisms and animals represent major challenges in various areas of biology. In the fundamental domain, microorganisms and their animal hosts entail a great diversity of species potentially giving rise to a variety of interactions. These interactions are of great interest in cell biology, molecular biology, evolutionary biology, and ecology. In human and animal health, the interactions between microorganisms and their vertebrate or invertebrate hosts are important because they are the cause of many diseases involving emerging human and animal pathogens.",

Extraction of DNA from human tissues and large-scale sequencing of the gene encoding 16S ribosomal RNA have revealed bacterial phyla of the skin, mouth, intestines, and genitals (Fig. 11.12). Among more than 50 bacterial phyla described, only four phyla are commonly found in humans: Actinobacteria, Bacteroidetes, Firmicutes, and Proteobacteria (Dethlefsen et al. 2007). These four phyla coexist with nine other secondary phyla (Chlamydiaceae, Cyanobacteria, Deferribacteria, Deinococcus-Thermus, Fusobacteria, Spirochaeta, Verrucomicrobiota, and two new phyla TM7 and SR1) in humans as well as in other vertebrate hosts (Ley et al. 2006).

Commensal bacteria, symbiotic bacteria (Bacteroides, Lactococcus), or pathogens such as enteropathogenic Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Streptococcus, or Chlamydia are those most often found (B\u00e4ckhed et al. 2005).

Invertebrates harbor diverse microbial communities, some of which contribute to their development and sometimes play an important role in their ability to adapt to extreme environments (Buchner 1965; Nardon and Charles 2001). Most wood-feeding termites depend on microbial partners (bacteria, fungi, protozoan flagellates) to degrade cellulose and lignified compounds in their intestinal tract (Brune 2003). More than 700 species of bacteria belonging to different phyla (Spirochetes, Bacteroidetes, Proteobacteria, Actinobacteria, Mycoplasma) have been described in the gut of termites Reticulitermes speratus and Macrotermes gilvus. This diversity can vary from one termite type to another (Hongoh et al. 2006; Fall et al. 2007). Drosophila, the fruit fly very familiar to geneticists, hosts Proteobacteria (E. coli, Pseudomonas, Sphingomonas), Bacteroidetes, and Mycoplasma (Mateos et al. 2006). Besides the parasites (Plasmodium) or viruses (dengue or Chikungunya) they transmit, mosquitoes belonging to genera Anopheles and Aedes harbor many acetic acid bacteria including Asaia, Acetobacter, Gluconobacter, and Sphingomonas (Favia et al. 2007) or even genera Aeromonas, Acidovorax, Bacillus, Paenibacillus, Pseudomonas, and Stenotrophomonas (Lindh et al. 2005).",

The whitefly Bemisia tabaci, the vector of viral pathogens of many plants, can host in a single cell many different bacterial genera, including Arsenophonus, Cardinium, Hamiltonella, Portiera, Rickettsia, and Wolbachia (Gottlieb et al. 2006). The bacteriocytes of the beetle Sitophilus oryzae (Fig. 11.13), a pest of stored grain, contain an average of 103 bacteria per cell or 106 bacteria per insect (Heddi et al. 1999). Apart from these few fragmentary data on insect models, investigations on the associated microbiota remain very limited despite their important role in the adaptation and development of invertebrates.

Since its discovery in 1981, AIDS has reached pandemic levels because it has killed more than 25 million people, and 40 million people live with HIV in almost all regions of the world (UNAIDS, January 2006 http://www.unaids.org). In the absence of a vaccine, the disease progression can be delayed for several years by the administration of an antiretroviral triple therapy and improved hygiene of people with HIV. Uncontrolled, the disease leads to a weakening of the immune system and opens the door to opportunistic infections responsible for diseases such as pneumonia and Kaposi\u2019s sarcoma that kill infected patients. Many fungi are among the opportunistic pathogens and include the genera Candida which causes candidiasis; Cryptococcus responsible for cryptococcosis; Histoplasma, the causative agent of histoplasmosis; or Aspergillus causing aspergillosis. New fungal pathogens are increasingly identified. For some species, the pathogenesis mechanisms are still unknown and cause problems. There are also a large number of bacteria involved in these opportunistic infections (cf. Chap. 10.1007/978-94-017-9118-2_15).",

Xenorhabdus and Photorhabdus bacteria live symbiotically in intestinal vesicles of the nematodes. When the larvae of nematodes, living freely in the soil, encounter and infect an insect host, they metamorphose into the adult stage, which weakens the immune system of the insect. Bacteria are then released into the blood of the immunocompromised insect and act as opportunistic agents. They multiply and release through their secretion systems toxins that cause septicemia and toxemia, causing the death of the insect. Necrotic tissues in turn are eaten by the entomophagous nematode. Inoculation of the asymbiotic nematode or the bacterium alone does not lead to death of the insect whose immune system can then effectively eliminate the intruders.",

These secretion systems constitute the second group of virulence factors, which play a role as important as adhesins in the establishment of interactions between microorganisms and hosts. Seven secretion systems, designated type I to type VII (Fig. 11.15) (Abdallah et al. 2007; Filloux et al. 2008), have been described and characterized mainly in pathogenic bacteria and to a lesser extent in the mutualists (Thanassi and Hultgren 2000). The type I secretion system (or ABC transporters) is involved in the transport of a wide variety of substrates (proteins, sugars, lipids) and many processes of bacterial life per se. This is by far the most represented secretion system found in many bacteria. Type II (or typical sec-dependent secretion) and type V (or autotransporters) systems are mainly used for the secretion of enzymes and/or other proteins (Sandkvist 2001). The type III (T3SS) and type IV (T4SS) secretion systems have evolved for interaction with other organisms (Cascales and Christie 2003). The T3SS develops a path allowing the bacterium to inject cytotoxic or cyto-destabilizing factors directly into the cytoplasm of the target cell. The T4SS, meanwhile, allows the translocation of nucleoprotein complexes to hosts, either directly inside the target cell or via the extracellular medium (Llosa and O\u2019Callaghan 2004). Mammal cells such as human cells but also plant cells are potential targets, providing an agronomic and medical interest to the study of these systems. Pili formed by the T3SS and T4SS are also involved in the attachment process of bacteria to target cells. The relationships between bacteria and host cells (animal or plant) via the T3SS and T4SS often have a pathogenic outcome and sometimes a mutualistic character (Dale et al. 2002).\n",

            "text": "Like the bacterial symbiotic islands, genetic determinants of virulence factors of pathogenic bacteria can be located in a region of the genome designated pathogenicity island (or PAI) (Hacker and Kaper 2000). Discovered for the first time in pathogenic E. coli, genome analysis showed the presence of PAIs in many other bacterial pathogens of animals. With a size varying from 10 to 200 kilobases (Fig. 11.16), the PAIs carry genes that encode virulence proteins (adhesins, protein secretion machinery, toxins, invasins, etc.). There is typically a transfer RNA (tRNA) that serves as the site of insertion of PAIs in a genome, sequence repeats generated during the events of horizontal transfer, or different genetic elements (integrases, transposases, insertion sequences) known to provide mobility features of gene modules (Hacker and Carniel 2001). PAIs can move from one region of the bacterial genome to another or be transferred from one strain to another by horizontal transfer. Some PAIs and other virulence factors are in fact carried by mobile elements such as plasmids of bacteria Shigella and Yersinia (Parsot and Sansonetti 1999) or bacteriophages of enteric bacteria and Vibrio cholerae (Karolis et al. 1999). Environmental factors (temperature, pH, osmolarity, oxygen partial pressure, etc.) affect positively (activation) or negatively (inhibition) the expression of virulence genes and thus the pathogenicity of invasive bacteria (Altier 2005).\n",

It is possible to identify genes lost in Buchnera by comparative analysis with the genome of its closest relative, the bacterial saprophyte E. coli (Moran and Mira 2001). From an evolutionary point of view, the mutual dependence between aphids and Buchnera dates back nearly 200 million years and the congruence of phylogenies of the partners reflects a coevolutionary process supported by vertical transmission of Buchnera across generations of aphids (van Ham et al. 2003). In addition to Buchnera, aphids are hosts of many bacteria termed secondary symbionts. The role of these clandestine passengers is now better understood. Some of these secondary symbionts are involved in tolerance to heat stress, and resistance to parasitoids, which are insects that develop as aliens at the expense of other insects they parasitize, which content they consume and kill (Oliver et al. 2003; Dunbar et al. 2007; Moran et al. 2008).",

Unlike humans and herbivorous animals that depend on endosymbiotic microbial partners to digest cellulolysic compounds of the plants they eat, ants have adopted an ectosymbiotic strategy that is surprising but effective. They grow in their nest cellulolytic fungi of the genera Leucoagaricus and Lepiota that they feed with plant material brought from the outside, often also causing considerable damage in the tropics. Fungi decompose the plant material, use it as nutrient, and develop numerous hyphae that can grow to represent large biomass. In return, ants, exclusively mycophagous, feed the fungal hyphae. Even more remarkable, these ants establish a symbiotic association with bacteria of the genus Burkholderia that produce an antibiotic involved in the fight against other fungi that contaminate nests (Santos et al. 2004).",

This squid that lives mainly on the seabed is exposed to predation when swimming back to the surface at night. To escape predators, E. scolopes emits a ventral light that serves as camouflage concealing its silhouette against the light of the stars. The emission of light by the squid results from the phenomenon of bioluminescence produced by V. fischeri (formerly Photobacterium fischeri) located in a specialized light organ (photophore) of the host (Fig. 11.18). Although the initiation of morphogenesis of the photophore occurs without the intervention of the bacterium, the latter is involved in postembryonic maturation among others acting on actin filaments of the cytoskeleton (Montgomery and McFall-Ngai 1994; Kimbell and McFall-Ngai 2004). In the photophore, V. fischeri can reach high densities in the order of 1010 cells per ml, and the light is emitted at a certain bacterial density (or quorum perceived by homoserine lactone-like molecules; cf. Chap. 10.1007/978-94-017-9118-2_9). At dusk, E. scolopes expels almost all bacteria and quorum (optimal number) required for light emission is reached again at night.\n",

Indeed, mammalian cells are also unable to digest most polysaccharides of plant origin except starch, which therefore depends on the human microbiota. Active anaerobic intestinal bacteria in the gut, anoxic, are similar between humans and animals. Recent work confirms the existence of mutualistic bacteria in the human gut. Indeed, the genomes of the obligate anaerobic bacteria Bacteroides, the dominant human gut bacterial genus, confirm the presence of genetic determinants and proteins involved in the degradation of polysaccharide compounds (Xu et al. 2003). In addition, inoculation to laboratory mice devoid of microbiota and maintained under axenic conditions, of strain Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron VPI-5482 isolated from the human intestine, leads to a pleiotropic effect: activation of carbon metabolism and storage of lipid compounds (B\u00e4ckhed et al. 2004), stimulation of cells producing antimicrobial compounds, and microvilli of the intestinal wall (Stappenbeck et al. 2002; Hooper et al. 2003). Another effect called probiotic* was supported by some data. The concept of probiotics has been proposed by the Russian Nobel Prize winner Elie Metchnikoff. It is defined as any living microorganism which, when ingested at a certain amount, exerts beneficial effects beyond basic nutritional functions. The probiotic microorganisms most frequently cited are lactobacilli and bifidobacteria, and the reported effects range from changing the intestinal ecology to the stimulation of the immune system or the decrease of the risk of cancer (Ouwehand et al. 2002). The probiotic issue has generated many controversies.",

Some of these bacterial taxa are also, as noted above, the pathogenic or mutualistic flora. Commensal microbiota that colonizes the surface of a given organ can prevent through a physical barrier effect the colonization of other bacteria, including pathogens. In contrast, the commensal microflora may represent a hazard to animal health as some groups carry genes for antibiotic resistance that may be acquired by pathogens by transformation, conjugation, or transduction. Transfer of antibiotic resistance genes between bacteria of animal and human origin has been identified in the gastrointestinal tract of animals (Moubareck et al. 2003). It has been seen that many commensal microbes colonize the skin or integument of animals. Some of them are involved in the production of volatile and odorous molecules that may have a direct or indirect impact on health. This is particularly the case of compounds of microbial origin that act as attractants toward mosquitoes (Brady et al. 1997) whose bites cause viral or parasitic infections.",

Wolbachia is mutualistic of filarial nematodes that include human pathogens such as Onchocerca volvulus involved in human onchocerciais or river blindness or Wuchereria bancrofti or Brugia malayi both responsible for elephantiasis. Bacteria are located in the hypodermal cells of the lateral chords of larvae but also in the ovaries in adult females and are thus transmitted transovarially to offsprings (Taylor et al. 1999; Fisher et al. 2011). Polysaccharides of Wolbachia represent an aggravating factor in inflammatory processes associated with filariasis (Saint Andr\u00e9 et al. 2002). The elimination of Wolbachia by antibiotics (rifampin, tetracycline) from infected nematodes leads to inhibition of embryogenesis and larval development (Bandi et al. 2001). Therapeutic trials combining antifilarial drugs (albendazole and ivermectin) and antibiotics (tetracyclines) have been conducted with some success against infection with Wuchereria bancrofti (Turner et al. 2006; Johnston and Taylor 2007).",

            "text": "In arthropods, Wolbachia induces multiple effects to the hosts. A pathogenic effect has been shown in drosophila; Wolbachia strain wMelPop is able to grow at high densities in nervous tissue and causes fatal bacteremia (McGraw et al. 2002). However, in most cases, Wolbachia manipulates the reproduction of their arthropod hosts. Four effects of reproductive manipulation are known: feminization of genetic males, male-killing by larval development arrest, parthenogenesis in haplodiploid Hymenoptera, and cytoplasmic incompatibility, which is a non-fertile cross between infected males with Wolbachia and uninfected female or carrying a different strain of Wolbachia (Werren et al. 1999). Wolbachia is thus qualified as a parasite of the reproduction of its host. These reproductive manipulations have resulted in biased sex ratios disadvantaging males, thus generating more females that transmit Wolbachia transovarially to their descendants. This explains the high prevalence of Wolbachia in natural populations of arthropods, estimated at up to 76 % in insects (Jeyaprakash and Hoy 2000; Hilgenboecker et al. 2008). A phenotype of mutual dependence was found in some arthropods where Wolbachia is required for normal reproduction or development. In the hymenopteran Asobara tabida, Wolbachia has become necessary for oogenesis in females (Dedeine et al. 2001). The elimination of Wolbachia by antibiotics generates asymbiotic individuals completely devoid of oocytes, and ovarian tissues showed early manifestations of apoptosis (Pannebakker et al. 2007). The bedbug, Cimex lectularius, hosts Wolbachia in a bacteriome and the two partners seem to establish a nutritional mutualistic symbiosis through the provisioning of vitamins (Hosokawa et al. 2010). Remarkably, Wolbachia is also able to protect drosophila against viral pathogens (Hedges et al. 2008), and in some cases this bacterium inhibits the transmission of pathogens by the mosquitoes (Moreira et al. 2009; Mousson et al. 2012).",

Apoptosis involves the caspase enzymes that are activated by many stimuli. Two apoptotic pathways are known: the extrinsic pathway is triggered by TNFR family receptors (Tumor Necrosis Factor Receptor) and the intrinsic pathway that is activated by intracellular signals such as oxidative stress and involves the disruption of mitochondria (Fig. 11.19).

            "text": "In addition to its role in development, apoptosis is involved in the defense against microbes and participates in the elimination of infected cells. Its induction is initiated after contact and perception by host cell receptors of microbial components or structures designated MAMPs (microbe-associated molecular patterns) or PAMPs (pathogen-associated molecular patterns). These components that are specific to microorganisms are composed of lipopolysaccharide (LPS), peptidoglycan (PGN), and lipoteichoic acids of the cell walls. Host cell receptors that are on the front line for detecting MAMPs and PAMPS are designated PRRs (pattern recognition receptors), the most reknown being the Toll-like receptors or TLRs. Discovered first in the innate antibacterial response in drosophila (Hoffmann 2003), TLR homologues were subsequently identified in other animals including mammals (Medzhitov et al. 1997). TLRs are also involved in the induction of apoptosis in response to microbial infection (Salaun et al. 2007). For example, the perception of bacterial LPS by TLR4 on endothelial cells leads to the induction of apoptosis (Bannerman and Goldblum 1997; Aliprantis et al. 1999). In mammalian cells such as mice, apoptosis mediated by TLR4 confers resistance to infection due to the perception of the pneumococcal virulence factor, pneumolysin (Srivastava et al. 2005). To eliminate or stop the progression of the infection with Shigella or Mycobacterium, infected macrophages can undergo apoptosis resulting in concomitant death of these bacterial pathogens (Zychlinsky and Sansonetti 1997).",

Facultative intracellular bacterium Mycobacterium tuberculosis, the causative agent of chronic tuberculosis, can prevent apoptosis in macrophages where it multiplies and persists. To this end, Mycobacterium increases the production of TNF receptors which in turn activate the antiapoptotic pathway NF-kappaB (Balcewicz-Sablinska et al. 1998). Another facultative intracellular bacterium, Bartonella henselae, involved in bacillary peliosis, prevents endothelial cell apoptosis by inhibiting caspase activation and DNA fragmentation (Kirby and Nekorchuk 2002). Obligate intracellular bacteria of the genus Chlamydia, involved in various human infectious diseases, can protect infected cells against apoptosis during the early phase of infection by blocking the proapoptotic caspases or by preventing the release of cytochrome c from mitochondria (Fan et al. 1998). Similarly, strict intracellular pathogens belonging to the order Rickettsiales are able to inhibit apoptosis. This is the case of Rickettsia rickettsii, the causative agent of Rocky Mountain spotted fever, which inhibits apoptosis of infected cells by activation of NF-kappaB (Clifton et al. 1998), while Anaplasma phagocytophilum, responsible of human anaplasmosis, prevents apoptosis of infected neutrophils through the transcriptional control of the antiapoptotic BFL1 and inhibition of the activation of apoptosis mediated by mitochondrial caspase 3 (Ge et al. 2005).

Exemplary cases of apoptosis induced by microbes involved pathogenic Shigella and intracellular Salmonella. To escape from macrophages, these bacteria excrete effectors via a secretion system directly into the cytoplasm of the host cell (Mills et al. 1997).

This seemingly paradoxical behavior is found in many viruses and some bacteria such as Chlamydia and mycobacteria (Miyairi and Byrne 2006). It is suggested that the antiapoptotic activity allows replication and generation of enough infectious entities in primo-infected host cells. Then, apoptosis is activated in the latter stages of infection to facilitate the spread of microbes to other surrounding host cells. Cell tropism has been observed in Chlamydia that has a functional duality: inhibition of apoptosis occurs primarily in phagocytic cells in which infectious agents multiply, while apoptosis is activated in immune response cells such as T cells (Miyairi and Byrne 2006). The complex interactions that occur during the modulation of apoptosis often involve the expression of many genes. However, in some cases the product of a single gene of microbial origin may be at the origin of apoptosis modulation. First shown in baculovirus (Clarke and Clem 2003), the involvement of a single gene in the control of apoptosis has been found in many other pathogens. For example, in Photorhabdus, the mcf gene alone is sufficient to induce apoptosis in insect cells (Daborn et al. 2002). In a similar way, the nuoG virulence gene in Mycobacterium tuberculosis is sufficient to inhibit apoptosis of host cells (Velmurugan et al. 2007).",

In this context, the exploitation of microbial communities as biopesticides for vector control, in addition to genetic and chemical agents, is a strategy globally promoted worldwide.

Up to 10 % of red blood cells can thus be infected. The clinical symptoms of malaria, including fever and chills, anemia, and cerebral malaria are associated with infected red blood cells, and most current drugs target this stage of the life cycle. The merozoites of a subpopulation of infected red blood cells develop into gametocytes. Following a sting on an infected individual, the mosquito sucks gametocytes (gametocytes) contained in the blood, which differentiate into male and female gametes. In the gut of the mosquito, the gametes fuse to form a zygote. The zygote develops into ookinetes that pass through the intestinal wall and forms an oocyst filled with sporozoites.

At daybreak, almost all (~90 %) bacteria are expelled into the environment; E. scolopes buries itself in the sand. During the day, the remaining bacterial population (~10 %) in the light organ is multiplied in order to reach again the maximum density required to produce luminescence at night (Adapted from Nyholm and McFall-Ngai 2004)",

In D. melanogaster, dArk adapter (protein homologous to Apaf-1 in mammals) activates the initiator caspase Dronc. Proteins having pro- and antiapoptotic domains Debcl and Buffy, belonging to the Bcl-2 family, may regulate the activation through dArk, but this step has not been demonstrated. The apoptosis inhibitor protein, DIAP-1, negatively regulates activity of Dronc and of the caspase effector Drice. The RGH family proteins (such as Rpr, Hid and Grim) activate apoptosis by inhibiting the action of DIAP-1 on caspases. In mammals, the intrinsic pathway is characterized by the activation of caspase 9 (functional homologue of Dronc) by Apaf-1. But the activity of Apaf-1 depends on the Bcl-2 family proteins: Bax and Bak have a proapoptotic activity, while Bcl-2 inhibits this activity to prevent apoptosis. Intracellular death signals activate BH3 domain proteins, thereby promoting activity of Bax and Bak. The latter form pores in the mitochondrial membrane resulting in the release of proteins that either promote the activation of the Smac/Diablo complex, preventing the action of the inhibitor of apoptosis proteins (IAPs), or activate Apaf-1 (role of cytochrome C). In the extrinsic pathway, the cell death receptor is activated by its specific ligand which causes the recruitment of the FADD adapter. FADD can then activate caspase 8, an initiator caspase. Finally, the two routes meet in the activation of effector caspases (such as caspases 3 and 7, Drice homologues) that lead to cell death (Adapted from Hay and Guo 2006)",

Neisseria sp. secretes the PorB protein which inhibits the release of cytochrome C. Salmonella enterica SopB secretes the protein that activates the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase pathway-Akt (PI3K/Akt) inhibiting the release of cytochrome C. Anaplasma phagocytophilum activates the PI3K-Akt and NF-kappaB activation allows inhibitor of apoptosis proteins (IAPs). Bartonella sp., Ehrlichia chaffeensis, and Rickettsia rickettsii activate NF-kappaB. Shigella flexneri inhibits caspase activation.
