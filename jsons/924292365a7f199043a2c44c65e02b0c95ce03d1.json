This assay was developed in response to the unprecedented 2014 nationwide EV-D68 outbreak in the United States associated with severe respiratory illness. As part of our evaluation of the outbreak, we sequenced and published the genome sequence of the EV-D68 virus circulating in St. Louis, MO. This sequence, along with other GenBank sequences from past EV-D68 occurrences, was used to computationally select a region of EV-D68 appropriate for targeting in a strain-specific RT-PCR assay. The RT-PCR assay amplifies a segment of the VP1 gene, with an analytic limit of detection of 4 copies per reaction, and it was more sensitive than commercially available assays that detect enteroviruses and rhinoviruses without distinguishing between the two, including three multiplex respiratory panels approved for clinical use by the FDA. The assay did not detect any other enteroviruses or rhinoviruses tested and did detect divergent strains of EV-D68, including the first EV-D68 strain (Fermon) identified in California in 1962. This assay should be useful for identifying and studying current and future outbreaks of EV-D68 viruses.",

The type strain isolated from one of these children was designated the Fermon strain. Subsequently, only small numbers of EV-D68 cases were reported until the early 2000s (2) . However, from 2008 to 2012, outbreaks in Japan, the Philippines, the Netherlands, and the United States (Georgia, Pennsylvania, and Arizona) have revealed EV-D68 as an emerging pathogen capable of causing severe respiratory illness (2) (3) (4) (5) (6) (7) . During the 2014 enterovirus/rhinovirus season in the United States, EV-D68 circulated at an unprecedented level (5) . From August 2014 to January 2015, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and state public health laboratories confirmed a total of 1,153 cases of respiratory illness caused by EV-D68, with \u054614 deaths. The spectrum of disease was diverse. Cases of flaccid paralysis have been reported in association with EV-D68 infection, but as of the time of this report, a causal relationship has not been proven (8) . The infected individuals were primarily children and resided in 49 states and the District of Columbia (5) . The CDC also reported that there were likely millions of EV-D68 infections in which the etiology was not determined (5) .",

We also observed this pattern at St. Louis Children's Hospital in St. Louis, MO. Because efforts to define the outbreak were hampered by the lack of a test for EV-D68 that did not require nucleotide sequencing, we undertook the development of a rapid and specific reverse transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR) assay. We began by sequencing the genome of a representative EV-D68 isolate from St. Louis to obtain the sequence information required to define an assay with optimal sensitivity and specificity (9) . EV-D68 causes respiratory illness, and the virus can be found in respiratory secretions, such as saliva, nasal mucus, or sputum (7) , of an infected person. Therefore, an appropriate assay would primarily focus on evaluating respiratory disease due to EV-D68 by targeting nasopharyngeal and other respiratory specimens.",

Because no molecular test was available for EV-D68-specific identification, laboratories were forced to rely on amplification and partial sequencing of the structural protein genes, VP4 to VP2 or VP1 (17, 18), a much more cumbersome procedure than a specific realtime RT-PCR assay. The lack of a rapid molecular assay resulted in vast underrecognition and underreporting of cases of EV-D68 infection, because the majority of clinical laboratories did not have the ability to test specifically for EV-D68. Specific identification of EV-D68 was primarily from the CDC and state labs. Several FDAapproved multiplex assays for the detection of respiratory viruses detect enteroviruses, but these systems are broadly reactive and do not distinguish between enteroviruses and rhinoviruses; the results are typically reported as human rhinovirus/enterovirus. In response to the 2014 nationwide enterovirus D68 outbreak and the associated increase in severe respiratory illness presentations, we developed and evaluated a real-time reverse transcriptase PCR assay for the detection of EV-D68 in clinical specimens. The development of this assay was informed by sequencing the complete genome of the EV-D68 virus circulating in St. Louis, MO, during the outbreak. Our RT-PCR primer and probe sequences were derived computationally by k-mer-mediated filtering of potentially cross-reactive non-EV-D68 viral sequences. Broad detection of EV-D68 was achieved through multiple-sequence alignment review using all published EV-D68 VP1 regions available through GenBank. Reduced sensitivity for the older and more distant Fermon EV-D68 type strain, which has only 87.9% identity to the genome sequence of the St. Louis virus, led us to modify the assay, which then proved capable of efficiently amplifying more divergent EV-D68 viruses as well.",

Rn is the fluorescence of the reporter dye divided by the fluorescence of a passive reference dye. \u232cRn is Rn minus the baseline and is plotted against PCR cycle number. The light green and light purple lines show detection of the 2014 EV-D68 outbreak strain using the WashU design 1 and design 2 assays, respectively. The brown and dark purple lines show detection of the more distant 1962 Fermon EV-D68 type strain using the WashU design 2 and design 1 assays, respectively. The incorporation of degenerate bases and mixed primers in WashU design 2 shows a significant increase in sensitivity (6.7 cycles earlier detection) for the Fermon type strain (brown line), with minimal decrease in sensitivity to the 2014 outbreak strain (light purple) (\u03fd0.5 cycles difference).",

            "text": "While there are no specific treatments for EV-D68 and currently no antiviral targets available, rapid and accurate diagnosis of current and future EV-D68 infections is of great concern to clinicians and public health authorities. The EV-D68-specific RT-PCR assay we have developed can be used for epidemiological studies of the EV-D68 outbreak and for virus monitoring in subsequent seasons. It is unclear at this time whether typing EV-D68 will be useful for patient management. However, some FDA-approved multiplex respiratory panels may not detect EV-D68 optimally or at all. In laboratories using those assays, an additional assay that detects EV-D68 will be useful for laboratory documentation of EV-D68 infection, which may help with prognosis, antibiotic use, and appropriate isolation. The ongoing importance of improved diagnostic capability for EV-D68 is underscored by the recent decision by the Department of Health and Human Services to encourage the development of EV-D68 testing capability by authorizing the emergency use of new in vitro diagnostics for EV-D68 detection (http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-2015-02-2 7/html/2015-04121.htm).",
