As humans found faster ways to travel (for example by horse, then ship) and engaged in wars and migrations, the opportunities for diseases to take hold, and result in pandemics, increased as pathogens were introduced into completely susceptible populations (Karlen, 1995). The greatest risk of transporting infections to na\u00efve populations now comes from air travel (Karlen 1995). Understanding the way in which people move globally is therefore important for understanding the spread of diseases with pandemic potential, such as influenza, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), and Ebola virus disease (World Health Organisation, n.d.).",

For instance, models could predict: the chance that a disease will invade particular countries, the expected number of cases within a particular timeframe, or the expected effect of interventions. For this information to be of value, the model must be a sufficiently accurate representation of reality in order to provide useful outputs. All models have a trade-off between complexity and accuracy so it is important to assess which approach is most appropriate for each individual situation (Keeling and Rohani, 2008). Often multiple models may be developed to describe the same real-world event; this is a natural consequence of no model being completely accurate. Early in a disease outbreak response, real-world information is sparse. Confidence in model accuracy may be increased if multiple different, independent models, developed by independent research groups, converge on a qualitatively similar output (or they may provide clear insight to the reasons for different qualitative behaviour). For example, Mateus and Otete (2014) found that multiple models offer the same qualitative prediction that travel restrictions will not prevent the spread of influenza into susceptible populations.",

Deciding which mathematical methods to use is an important decision for modellers (Fowkes and Mahony, 1994) as evaluation of a model comes down to a subjective measure of usefulness (Keeling and Rohani, 2008). In some circumstances, for instance when modelling is conducted within the UK government, such decisions are made in discussion with the commissioner of the modelling rather than by the modeller alone. Directed by this view, we seek to identify what modelling techniques have been employed to predict the global spread of a pandemic potential disease and what data are available to parametrise these models. Confidence in model outputs is important as, in the case of disease spread models, health protection planning decisions may be directly influenced by these outputs. Confidence in model outputs can be increased through a process known as validation.",

            "text": "Validation is checking that a model, combined with its assumptions, provide a sufficiently accurate real-world representation to a sufficient level of accuracy (Carson, 2002; Sargent, 2011). What constitutes a sufficient level of accuracy must be a judgement made by the modeller (or, where relevant, the commissioner or stakeholders) as model validation always requires some subjective analysis (Barlas, 1996). Primarily, the validity of a particular model choice is not independent of the model purpose (Barlas, 1996). Validation can be considered as a multi-component process involving: conceptual validation, logical validation, experimental validation, operational validation and validation of the data used in the model (Landry, Malouin et al., 1983). The first two aspects are concerned with the conceptual model and its implementation, considering assumptions made about the real-world situation and verifying that a model implementation meets the criteria of the concept model. Operational validation is most relevant to the end-user of the model and focuses on cost-benefit analyses of proposed actions. In this review we are interested in what has been called experimental validation, pertaining to model efficiency and robustness. We consider validation to be done by comparing model predictions to a known outcome or, more weakly, by calibrating a model to a known outcome. Data validation of disease spread models has been discussed in Mesl\u00e9 et al. (2018).",

We focus on identifying the model type, the input data that were used to parametrise the model, and the validation data used to assess model accuracy and judge quality. It is useful at this point to reflect that modelling infectious diseases, particularly emerging pandemics, is different to modelling environmental or physical phenomena (such as climate change or fluid dynamics). This is because the underpinning knowledge or empirical data are often rare or highly uncertain and the timescales for intervention relatively fast. We adopt a scoping study approach, as described by Arksey and O\u2019Malley (2005) and Levac and O\u2019Brien (2010), as this allows us to employ an iterative search approach and rapidly assess the literature. Scoping studies do not seek to provide a quality assessment of the literature but seek to provide an overview of the extent, range and nature of existing literature and highlight any research gaps (Arksey and O\u2019Malley, 2005). Consequently, we do not seek to critically appraise each model as models have multiple trade-offs so a comparative framework for model design cannot be separate from a framework for assessing the quality of datasets.",

We then attempted to split the records into statistical or mechanistic, but again had difficulty as, although some models are purely statistical, many of the mechanistic modelling papers also used statistical methods for some aspect of the model (for example record [36]). We have identified models that we consider to be purely statistical in nature so these form one model type. As our primary interest is finding models for the spread of disease through a large population, we have then split the remaining records on whether the models are agent-based or population-wide models. We consider population-wide models to be those where each individual is not tracked throughout the model (Table 3\n).",

Alternatively, in the case of [78], each cell represents one of a number of discrete spatial regions each with corresponding population.

For predictive models, we consider the ideal situation to be where the model may be parameterised by existing datasets, followed by being validated against an independent source of data. In some instances records are not clear about where data are from, for instance by not clearly giving references. This makes it difficult for anyone to reproduce or check the work or to subsequently use such data resources in their own work.

It also has a well understood epidemiology and clear evidence of historical global spread. There have been 4 major outbreaks in recent history (1918, 1957, 1968 and 2009) (Monto and Sellwood, 2013), hence it is a disease where it is possible to get separate datasets for parameterisation and validation.

As access to such data is restricted, it can be difficult for researchers to critically appraise models which use data under commercial licenses, discussed further in Mesl\u00e9 et al. (2017). As travel patterns change over time, updated dataset access will be required to ensure models are parametrised to represent an up to date real-world situation. In the event of a disease outbreak this may delay the process of obtaining predictions. However, a benefit of using commercial data is that there are often different data format options available which customers can choose from. This may make the process of model development easier.

However, researchers should attempt more robust validation, or justify explicitly why it was not possible. The articles reviewed indicate that appropriate models have been developed which can account for epidemiological complexity and population structures. However, the complexity of the models often leads to challenges in independent reproducibility of results by other modelling groups or thorough quality assessment prior to use to advise government. Simply sharing code/software or traditional peer review may not always be sufficient. For example, the UK civil service has adopted guidance on producing quality analysis to support quality assurance and governance of modelling advice: The Aqua Book (UK Government). This is a burden of effort on modelling groups, and we do not suggest this approach completely. That said, documenting assumptions on data and methods explicitly in tandem with the code and the input data will aid model transparency and aid future research. If data or models are not publicly available (or are proprietary) then results are not easily reproducible by other groups and so may not be taken seriously and achieve the impact the work deserves.",
