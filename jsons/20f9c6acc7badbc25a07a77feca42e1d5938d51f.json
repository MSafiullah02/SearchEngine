Presently, there are no FDA-approved LASV-specific vaccines or antiviral agents, although the antiviral drug ribavirin has shown some efficacy. A recently identified small-molecule inhibitor of arenavirus entry, ST-193, exhibits submicromolar antiviral activity in vitro. To determine the antiviral utility of ST-193 in vivo, we tested the efficacy of this compound in the LASV guinea pig model. Four groups of strain 13 guinea pigs were administered 25 or 80 mg/kg 25 mg/kg of ribavirin, or the vehicle by the intraperitoneal (i.p.) route before infection with a lethal dose of LASV, strain Josiah, and continuing once daily for 14 days. Control animals exhibited severe disease, becoming moribund between days 10 and 15 postinfection. ST-193-treated animals exhibited fewer signs of disease and enhanced survival when compared to the ribavirin or vehicle groups. Body temperatures in all groups were elevated by day 9, but returned to normal by day 19 postinfection in the majority of ST-193-treated animals. ST-193 treatment mediated a 2-3-log reduction in viremia relative to vehicle-treated controls. The overall survival rate for the ST-193-treated guinea pigs was 62.5% (10/16) compared with 0% in the ribavirin (0/8) and vehicle (0/7) groups.

It may not necessarily be an optimal dosing regimen. However, this dose clearly demonstrated antiviral activity in this study as shown by reduced viremia and prolonged survival. Although extending ribavirin treatment beyond the 14 days used in this study might have improved survival, it is noteworthy that viremia was higher in ribavirin-treated animals than in ST-193 animals even during the dosing period. Cursory reports in the literature with respect to ribavirin efficacy against LASV in guinea pigs are mixed.

Serum from surviving animals collected at all time points postinfection had the ability to neutralize LASV in an in vitro PRNT test. Though the ribavirin-treated animals experienced prolonged survival compared to the vehicle control group, none of these animals developed a neutralizing antibody titer at any time point, despite the fact that this group had the most robust anti-LASV IgG2 response, as measured by ELISA (Fig. 4) . Interestingly, one animal in the 80 mg/kg ST-193 treatment group succumbed on day 21 postinfection, yet had only a minimum viral titer (1.2 \u00d7 10 2 pfu/ml) in the terminal serum and immunohistochemistry failed to identify virus in the tissue samples examined. Histological analysis revealed interstitial pneumonia, lymph node hyperplasia and splenic depletion to a degree similar to that observed in surviving animals. However, this animal did exhibit significant viremia (>10 4 pfu/ml) in the day 14 postinfection sample. The terminal serum from this animal had a neutralizing titer similar to that of the surviving animals. Representative examples from liver (row 1), lung (row 2), and heart (row 3) are shown. Necrosis in the liver (arrows) was most severe in the vehicle control and ribavirin groups. In the ST-193 25 mg/kg, 80 mg/kg, and survivor groups, hepatic necrosis was present but to a much lesser degree. In the lung, interstitial pneumonia with thickened alveolar walls, congestion, and alveolar edema and inflammation was present in all groups, with ribavirin, and ST-193 groups being the most severe. Within the heart, inflammation (endocarditis) was present (arrows) in the ribavirin and ST-193 80 mg/kg groups. The neutralizing ability of serum samples from surviving animals was an unexpected result. Previous reports have shown that neutralizing antibodies only appear later (>32 days postinfection) in surviving LASV-infected guinea pigs (Jahrling et al., 1982) and do not appear to play a significant recovery role in human cases . Although the formal possibility exists that residual compound present in the serum mediated neutralization of LASV, this explanation seems unlikely as the day 21 and day 29 samples were drawn 8 and 16 days after the last compound dose was delivered. Thus these results suggest that a specific immune response against LASV was produced in the survivors. One possibility is that ST-193 treatment may mitigate LASV-associated lymphopenia (Jahrling et al., 1982) and thus allow for a more timely humoral immune response. The lack of strong production of LASVspecific IgG1 or IgG2 in treated animals as measured by ELISA may be due to several factors. Because these animals all became viremic to varying degrees during the study, it is possible that LASV-specific antibodies present in the serum were bound to free antigen, thus preventing binding to the immobilized antigen in the ELISA. Additionally, it is unknown what effect irradiation has on the antigenic epitopes of LASV, thus the low specific antibody titer observed may also be due to weakened LASV antigens.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 2197, "end": 2220, "text": "(Jahrling et al., 1982)", "ref_id": "BIBREF35"}, {"start": 2727, "end": 2750, "text": "(Jahrling et al., 1982)", "ref_id": "BIBREF35"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 728, "end": 736, "text": "(Fig. 4)", "ref_id": "FIGREF3"}], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "Both doses of 25 and 80 mg/kg/day, were sufficient to provide a level of protection from a lethal LASV infection. Differences between these two treatment groups were not remarkable, although neither was fully protective. Possibly the lower dose is sufficient to yield the maximum antiviral effect, or perhaps the group sizes are too small to detect differences in survival rates between the two doses. Another consideration is that within the context of this experiment, while the lower dose provided less to the animals, the higher dose exposed animals to higher volumes of the vehicle. Weight loss associated with the vehicle volume may exacerbate the disease and offset the additional quantity of antiviral compound. Such an effect might contribute to the poor survival rate of the ribavirin-treated group as well, as that group received the same vehicle volume as the 80 mg/kg Unexpectedly, some surviving animals in the ST-193 treatment groups experienced elevated liver enzymes (AST and ALT) at the study endpoint. Levels of AST and ALT were elevated in surviving animals, but had returned in the normal range by day 21 postin-fection, only to become elevated again at the study endpoint. One out of five surviving animals in the ST-193 25 mg/kg treatment group and three out of five in the ST-193 80 mg/kg treatment group experienced this late increase in ALT levels. All of the surviving animals experienced a late increase in AST levels to varying degrees. This late increase in liver enzymes occurred despite survivors having no clinical signs of illness and little or no detectable viremia at the study endpoint. Repeat analyses were not possible due to limited sample volumes. Histologically, the surviving animals with elevated liver enzymes also had evidence of mild hepatocellular degeneration and/or necrosis at necropsy. Other laboratories have reported multifocal hepatic necrosis in the Hartley guinea pig that is unrelated to age or overall health (Maeda et al., 2000) . Maeda et al. observed that in 202 guinea pigs between 4 and 23-weeks old, 111 of these animals displayed multiple necrotic lesions, most commonly coagulative necrosis, in the absence of any known disease (Maeda et al., 2000) . Indeed, we have observed this phenomenon in our laboratory as well in uninfected strain 13 guinea pigs and at early stages of LASV infection before observable liver pathology with corresponding elevated enzyme levels. Another potential explanation for the elevated liver enzymes could be hemolysis of the samples, a well known cause of overestimated AST and ALT (Sonntag, 1986) . In fact, another symptom of hemolysis, depressed alkaline phosphatase (Lippi et al., 2006; Sonntag, 1986) is seen in parallel with those samples with elevated AST and ALT. Alkaline phosphatase levels have been reported to actually increase in LASVinfected guinea pigs (Lukashevich et al., 2005) , suggesting that the depressed levels seen here may be more consistent with hemolysis than with liver damage. Finally, a subsequent LASV infection study in strain 13 guinea pigs did not exhibit this phenomenon (R. Carrion, personal communication with. S.A.); in this follow-up study, ST-193-treated survivors displayed normal liver enzyme values. Ultimately, this finding may be incidental and unrelated to either LASV infection or treatment with .
