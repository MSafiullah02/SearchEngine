Instead, we must strive to contain the next Covid-19 outbreak by ensuring that its effective reproduction number is smaller than 1 from the get-go, to ensure that the epidemic dies out soon. This can be achieved by a highly disciplined population on the one hand, and rigorous mass testing of large parts of the population on the other hand, either through random sampling [14] , group testing [15] , or simply producing results faster. This paper aims at answering the question, how often people should be tested, even if they show no symptoms [12] , in order to contain the epidemic without shutting down our economy? And once we have rough estimates, decide whether this is feasible at all, or not. The paper does not take into account sensitivity or specificity of COVID-19 tests [10] , nor does it consider alternative lock-down ideas [11, 17] .",

In the mentioned study, several cases where simulated and fit to measured data, conclusions were that the time of being infectious starts at least 2 days before symptom onset, and peaking between 2 and 1 days before. For this study we choose the inferred infectiousness profile as detailed in [6] Figure 1 , starting 2 days before symptom onset and ending 10 days after [7] . We model this curve with a gamma distribution with scale 1.23 and rate 0.4, producing a density function as given in [6] Figure 1 (shifted by 2 days).
