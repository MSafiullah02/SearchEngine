The viral pathogen, canine distemper virus (CDV), belongs to genus Morbillivirus in the family Paramyxoviridae. Live attenuated vaccines were developed with classical strains (Onderstepoort, Snyder Hill and Rockborn) in the 1950s, which have been used widely to control the disease. Nevertheless, CDV continues to cause severe outbreaks worldwide, mainly in regions with poor vaccine coverage (Martella et al., 2008). Dogs with CD develop systemic clinical signs few days after infection. These clinical findings are variable, depending on the virulence of the virus strain, environmental conditions, age and immune status of the host. Acutely infected dogs shed the virus in several body secretions, thereby transmitting the virus to other animals (Greene and Appel, 2006).",

A history of an unvaccinated puppy with depression and anorexia supports a suggestive diagnosis (Greene and Appel, 2006). However, many dogs lack the classical clinical presentation and/or are infected with other agents that are responsible for similar signs at the time of the first clinical visit to the veterinary, rendering CD diagnostic difficult (Amude et al., 2007). Some routine laboratorial tests may provide some useful clinical information because CD findings include partial and absolute lymphopenia and body inclusions in the buffy coat cells of conjunctival imprints. However, these tests are not conclusive and do not confirm infection, especially in atypical cases (Greene and Appel, 2006).",

Virus isolation is fastidious and difficult to perform for routine diagnosis. Immunofluorescence has been the preferred technique up to a few years ago. In 2008, however, an immunochromatography rapid test was developed, which has been used as a routine test because it is fast and user friendly (An et al., 2008). In addition, different RT-PCR protocols have been developed to sensitive and specific CDV RNA detection in dogs (Frisk et al., 1999, Gebara et al., 2004, Shin et al., 2004, Castilho et al., 2007). These assays were targeted to the nucleoprotein (NC) gene, which encodes the most abundant structural viral protein and has a highly conserved nucleotide sequence (Yoshida et al., 1998). Furthermore, three different amplification schemes were described as practical diagnostic tools, as follows: RT-PCR with electrophoresis (Frisk et al., 1999, Calderon et al., 2007, Demeter et al., 2007), nested RT-PCR with electrophoresis (Shin et al., 2004, J\u00f3zwik and Frymus, 2005, Kapil et al., 2008) and real time RT-PCR (Elia et al., 2006, Scagliarini et al., 2007).",

All sequences were edited with EditSeq and aligned with MegAlign (DNAstar Lasergene package, Madison, WI, USA). Primers described in previous reports (Frisk et al., 1999, Shin et al., 2004, Elia et al., 2006, Castilho et al., 2007) were also compared to the complete alignment. Four primers and one probe were chosen after the comparative analysis between primers and the aligned sequences published previously. The primer sequences were almost identical to the original references, with few modifications and degenerations to recognise specific nucleotide sequences present in Brazilian field strains reported previously (Castilho et al., 2007). Probe sequence was the same as in the original article (Elia et al., 2006) (Table 1\n).",

For many years, antigen detection has been performed via direct immunofluorescence assay (IFA), although false negative results were common in some clinical conditions (J\u00f3zwik and Frymus, 2005). Recently, a rapid immunochromatography (IC) test with good performance was developed (An et al., 2008), which has been used mostly in veterinary laboratories and clinics worldwide because of its simple and fast analytical characteristics.",

The whole procedure used primers and probes described previously and involved testing via inclusion assays with field and vaccine strains from different CDV lineages (Frisk et al., 1999, Elia et al., 2006, Castilho et al., 2007). RT-nqPCR detected all vaccine strains and Brazilian CDV field samples, displaying greater sensitivity than did the \u201cone-step\u201d RT-PCR (without a nested amplification). It was also faster than other RT-nested-PCR protocols because of the addition of the probe in the second amplification and \u201creal time\u201d analysis. Although the method is based on two amplification rounds, the strategy of using a first round of RT-PCR amplification, with ten cycles, followed by a second round of real-time PCR, with 40 cycles, presented very good linear and reproducible results, similar to another real-time technique described previously (Elia et al., 2006). A comparison with this developed real time RT-PCR was attempted, although it was not successful because the majority of the positive Brazilian field samples presented with negative results with this procedure (data not shown). In the analysis of the aligned sequences, the comparison between the primers and probe of the previous developed technique and Brazilian NC gene field strains demonstrated four single nucleotide modifications in the sequence of the primers; two in CD-F, at nucleotide positions 918 and 929; and two in CD-R, at nucleotide positions 978 and 983 (Fig. 1). This situation could prevent the primers from annealing when using the protocol described by Elia et al. (2006).",

These body fluids also displayed a higher number of PCR positive results than did other samples (saliva, nasal and conjunctival swabs) in previous studies (Shin et al., 2004, An et al., 2008). A new finding was that the great majority of the positive blood and urine samples were also positive in the rectal swab samples. The rectal (or even faecal) swab is easier to collect than the other samples and has already been used to detect other gastroenteritis viral agents, such as canine parvovirus 2, rotavirus and coronavirus (Decaro et al., 2005, Calderon et al., 2011, Pinto et al., 2012).",

Conjunctival swab was previously recommended for CDV detection, mainly for the early diagnosis of CD (Kim et al., 2006). Another study demonstrated a concordance of 100% between RT-nested-PCR and IC assays using conjunctival swabs. The authors emphasised that this sample was the most suitable specimen for early antemortem diagnosis of CD, most likely because of the persistent shedding of CDV in the eye, unlike in other compartments (An et al., 2008). Based on these results, a conjunctival swab is the main specimen recommended for testing with the commercial IC assay. In the present study, the comparison between RT-nqPCR and IC assays (when both methods used conjunctival swabs as samples) displayed a high percentage of discordant results (22%) and false-negative results (13.6%). One possible reason is that the sampled infected dogs were in different stages of the disease. The majority of the positive dogs (64.1%) developed neurologic signs (according to the clinical exam records), which usually start 20 days after infection, when the virus reaches the epithelial tissues and the central nervous system (CNS) (Martella et al., 2008). Another possibility is that insufficient samples were collected to perform these tests, although the two conjunctival swabs (the first for the IC assay and the second for the RT-nqPCR) were collected carefully from different eyes at the time of clinical examination.",

In contrast, only twelve of these dogs were positive in the IC assay (data not shown), which means that 40% were false negative results based on the IC assay. The superior performance of nested-RT-PCR over the IC assay has been reported previously (An et al., 2008). These authors suggested that the IC assay requires large amounts of viral antigens to produce a clear positive result, which could limit the sensitivity of the assay. Because sensitive and rapid detection of the virus can reduce the mortality of the disease and to start appropriate treatment before full signs become evident, the use of a more sensitive test should be chosen when available.",

Interestingly, the nucleotide mutations did not result in any amino acid substitution in all 25 field samples, vaccine strains or other Brazilian strains. However, the few mutations were used to compare all sequences. The great majority of the field CDV nucleotide sequences (23 out of 25) were similar to other Brazilian strains sequenced previously. All were identified in central-nervous-system (CNS) samples collected between 2000 and 2006 from dogs with CD (Castilho et al., 2007, Headley et al., 2009). Interestingly, two dog samples showed nucleotide sequences similar to the classical strain Lederle used as a vaccine. These dogs were positive according to RT-nqPCR only in the blood samples and did not progress to CD, suggesting they could be circulating live vaccines. Furthermore, the nucleotide sequence differences could be used in RFLP analysis to differentiate vaccine strains from field samples. A similar procedure, using RFLP analysis of the NC gene, was proposed previously to differentiate between vaccine and field strains in China (Wang et al., 2011). Other studies have proposed RFLP analysis for CDV differentiation, although all of them involved the more variable haemagglutinin (H) gene as the target (Mochizuki et al., 1999, Calderon et al., 2007, Di Francesco et al., 2012).",

The combination of two primer pairs in a nested format using a universal probe was able to detect both vaccine and field strains of CDV. The RT-nqPCR demonstrated sensitivity and specificity similar to other DNA amplification methods and was more sensitive than a commercial IC assay. The samples that allowed the detection of a greater number of positive samples were blood, followed by urine, rectal and conjunctival swabs. Furthermore, the nucleotide sequence of the NC gene from Brazilian field strains allowed the development of an additional RFLP analysis to differentiate them from vaccine strains. The method described herein should be an important diagnostic tool for the diagnosis of canine distemper.",
