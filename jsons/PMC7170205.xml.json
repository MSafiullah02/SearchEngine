            "text": "Obtaining meaningful data on rates of nosocomial infection that can form the basis for comparisons within a hospital and, especially, among hospitals and that can also be used to monitor secular trends and document the efficacy or lack of efficacy of control measures must begin with clear, unambiguous definitions. Although there are no standardized definitions for infection at specific sites that are universally accepted by clinicians or investigators, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has published definitions for the purpose of surveillance of nosocomial infection within hospitals, which most U.S. centers and an increasing number of hospitals around the world have adopted (Box 51-1\n).16 For research purposes, more stringent definitions for specific infections will usually be necessary,17 especially for pneumonia.18\nBox 51-1Definitions for Nosocomial Infection of the Centers for Disease Control and PreventionPrimary Bloodstream Infection*\n1.Recognized pathogen isolated from blood culture AND pathogen is not related to infection from another site (other than site

            "text": "Many of the published recommendations for ICU architectural design166 are empiric, and evidence that they reduce rates of nosocomial infection is, by and large, lacking. Although more research is necessary before specific features of ICU design achieve a level of evidence sufficient for an evidence-based guideline, certain facets of the ICU layout deserve attention:\u25aaICUs should be located in areas that limit traffic flow to essential ICU personnel.\u25aaICU facilities should be designed with ICU professionals in mind, ensuring appropriate space, resources, and environment for day-to-day operations.166 Recognizing the growing variety and complexity of life support equipment required for the care of many patients, each cubicle or room should provide a minimum of 11 m2 per bed.167 The area should be large enough to accommodate the bed and all equipment yet allow immediate access to the patient at all times from both sides of the bed. Adequate space must also be provided for storage of nursing supplies. Facilities for disposal of biohazardous waste (e.g., bedpan flushers); for cleaning, reprocessing, and storage of ICU equipment; and for storage of housekeeping supplies should be separate from patient care areas. Single-patient rooms may increase the likelihood of handwashing being done and improve compliance with isolation practices, reducing the risk of cross-infection. For example, Mulin and colleagues168 found that converting from an open unit to single rooms in their ICU greatly reduced rates of patient colonization with A. baumanii, and Shirani and colleagues169 found that renovation of their burn unit to include separate bed enclosures reduced rates of nosocomial infection by 48%.169\n\u25aaMaterials used for fixtures, furniture, and other surfaces should be smooth and easy to clean; surfaces made of porous materials foster bacterial colonization.170\n\u25aaAn adequate number of sinks must be available for convenient handwashing by ICU personnel. Ideally, a sink should be located at the entrance of each cubicle or patient room to encourage handwashing by all entering personnel who will have contact with the patient or the immediate environment.171, 172 Separate sinks should be used for cleaning and reprocessing contaminated equipment. Sinks and sink drains are normally contaminated by pseudomonads,173 although their role in the epidemiology of nosocomial infection is as yet unclear. However, sinks should be designed to minimize aerosol formation and splashback.\u25aaAll ICUs should be equipped with one or more class A isolation rooms,200 which include an anteroom for gowning and handwashing and the necessary modifications (negative pressure, roofline exhaust) to permit it to be used for patients with tuberculosis or other airborne infections such as chickenpox, measles, disseminated HSV infection or a highly contagious emerging pathogen such as the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) human coronavirus. If an ICU treats bone marrow transplant patients or other patients with prolonged severe granulocytopenia, positive-pressure isolation rooms using high-efficiency particle-arrest (HEPA) filters should be available. Isolation rooms for patients with infections transmitted by the respiratory route or to protect profoundly granulocytopenic patients must be kept closed to maintain control over the direction of airflow.\u25aaA centralized, filtered air-handling system that provides at least six room-exchanges per hour is essential.167, 174 Ideally, each patient's room should have the capacity of being set at positive or negative pressure with respect to the rest of the unit; if it cannot be, the room should be maintained permanently at positive pressure.\n",

Surveillance of the hospital water system found that 75% of all samples contained low levels of L. pneumophila, which were shown to be clonally related to the 10 cases of nosocomial legionellosis. Installation of a continuous copper-silver ionization system led to complete eradication of Legionella from water samples, and no further cases of nosocomial legionellosis have been identified at our institution since 1995, among 255,000 patients hospitalized.",

Critical objects, which are introduced directly into the bloodstream or into other normally sterile areas of the body, such as surgical instruments, cardiac catheters, and implanted devices, must be reliably sterile and sterilized with steam, gas, hydrogen peroxide gas, or chemical sterilization. Semicritical items, which come into contact with intact mucous membranes, such as fiberoptic endoscopes, endotracheal tubes, or ventilator circuit tubing, can be decontaminated between patients by pasteurization or the use of high-level chemical disinfection with glutaraldehyde, peracetic acid, hydrogen peroxide, ethyl alcohol, or hypochlorite. Noncritical items, which normally come into contact only with intact skin, such as blood pressure cuffs or electrocardiograph electrodes, require hygienic cleansing or low-level disinfection with an iodophor, hypochlorite, quaternary ammonium or phenolic disinfectants, or alcohol.193, 194 The lone exception to this classification scheme is devices that pose a risk of transmitting prion-related diseases. Transmissible spongiform encephalopathies such as Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) and variant CJD (vCJD) have gained considerable attention over the past decade and have only recently been addressed in published disinfection and sterilization guidelines.195 Prions are not readily inactivated by conventional disinfection and sterilization procedures.193 As a result, devices that pose a risk for transmission of prion-related diseases should undergo special sterilization procedures after cleaning that involve sodium hydroxide followed by low-temperature autoclaving (121\u00b0 C) or high-temperature autoclaving (132\u00b0 C for 1 hour or 134\u00b0 C for 18 minutes).194 Despite concerns that procedures involving semicritical items such as endoscopes and bronchoscopes may pose a risk for transmission of prion-related infections, there has not been a single report of CJD or vCJD associated with these devices. As a result, current guidelines recommend that only critical items and semicritical items that have come in contact with neurologic tissue (e.g., brain, spinal cord, eye tissue) should undergo special prion inactivation sterilization procedures.194, 196\n",

Standard precautions synthesize the major features of universal blood and body fluid precautions and are designed to reduce the risk of transmission of microorganisms from patient to patient and from patient to HCW, from both recognized and unrecognized sources of infection in the hospital. Transmission-based precautions are divided into three subgroups on the basis of the mode of transmission: contact precautions, droplet precautions, and airborne precautions. Contact precautions are recommended with multidrug-resistant bacteria that can be acquired by contact with the colonized patient or environmental surfaces or objects. Droplet precautions provide additional measures for transmission by large-particle droplets, such as during suctioning or bronchoscopy. Airborne precautions are added to standard precautions for care of patients with tuberculosis and other microorganisms transmitted by the airborne route. In general, transmission-based precautions usually specify a private room\u2014always for airborne precautions.",

Although previous studies have not been able to demonstrate that the inanimate hospital environment, particularly surfaces, walls, or floors, contribute materially to the occurrence of nosocomial infection,154, 155 accumulating evidence suggests that this may not necessarily be true for ICUs, where uniform exposure to invasive devices makes patients unduly susceptible. A number of careful studies of the epidemiology of ICU-acquired infection with resistant organisms such as MRSA,155, 156\nC. difficile,\n80, 157 and VRE152, 158, 229 have shown heavy contamination of the inanimate environment immediately contiguous to the patient by strains implicated in nosocomial infections occurring in patients. Even if gloves are being worn as part of protective isolation or universal precautions, the possibility of transmission of microorganisms from the environment to patients on the gloved hands of HCWs is real. Prolonged wearing of gloves in the ICU, which is common, may increase the risk of nosocomial cross-infection, expanding the epidemiologic role of the inanimate environment with certain pathogens such as MRSA or VRE.229\n",

Universal precautions were based on the concept that all blood and body fluids that might be contaminated with blood should be treated as infectious because patients with bloodborne infections can be asymptomatic or unaware they are infected. The relevance of universal precautions to other aspects of disease transmission was recognized, and in 1996 the CDC expanded the concept and changed the term to Standard Precautions.\n238 Standard precautions integrate and expand the elements of universal precautions into a standard of care designed to protect health care personnel and patients from pathogens that can be spread by blood or any other body fluid, excretion, or secretion. Standard precautions apply to contact with (1) blood; (2) all body fluids, secretions, and excretions (except sweat), regardless of whether they contain blood; (3) nonintact skin; and (4) mucous membranes.",

However, this has not been demonstrated and there is concern that standard precautions might paradoxically increase the risk of nosocomial cross-infection.242 In most U.S. hospitals it is still common to observe ICU personnel, many of whom routinely wear gloves for all patient contacts to protect themselves, put on gloves, touch heavily contaminated areas (e.g., an open wound or tracheostomy), and then, without removing the gloves, proceed to write in the patient's chart, answer the telephone, or care for another patient. This occurs because the health care providers have forgotten that although the gloves may protect themselves, the gloves must be immediately discarded after use to prevent cross-contamination of hazardous pathogens to other vulnerable sites on the same patient or transmission to other patients or the ICU environment. Before the era of AIDS and universal precautions, health care professionals were oriented toward protecting the patient and likely to wash their hands when exposed to potential contamination. Now the focus is centripetal, and many HCWs unfortunately view all precautions as measures to protect themselves. Thus prolonged wearing of gloves can result in heavy contamination of the gloves243 and increase the risk of nosocomial cross-infection among patients.229, 244 It also puts the HCW worker at increased risk of dermatitis and allergic reactions to glove material.245\nStandard precautions do not obviate the need for designated isolation precautions for patients with communicable infections. The greatly expanded use of gloves as part of standard precautions in hospitals must now be accompanied by educational programs on how to use gloves effectively and in a manner that will not jeopardize patients. Staff must be strongly encouraged to wash their hands after removing gloves, especially after performing a bloody procedure, because blood often penetrates defects in gloves and can be found on the hands of the wearer.246 Moreover, if the gloved HCW has had hands-on contact with a patient colonized by MRSA or VRE, the process of removing the gloves will result in contamination of the hands of the HCW by these organisms up to one third of the time.",

However, several principles can reduce unnecessary antimicrobial therapy and improve the use of the drugs that are given:1.Fever without other indications of infection should not mandate automatically beginning antimicrobial therapy in an ICU patient.2.Unless antimicrobial therapy is being given for surgical prophylaxis, it is most likely being given for treatment of suspected or proved infection. Gram-stained smears, cultures, and other appropriate diagnostic tests, as indicated, should be done without fail before beginning antimicrobial therapy for treatment of presumed infection in an ICU patient.3.Whenever antimicrobial therapy is begun, the reason should be documented in the patient's record (e.g., \u201cfor treatment of pneumonia,\u201d \u201cfor surgical prophylaxis\u201d).4.When possible, a single drug and the most narrow-spectrum drug or drugs should be used, especially if the infecting organism or organisms are known at the outset.5.The need for continued antimicrobial therapy should be reassessed daily. If cultures identify the infecting microorganism or microorganisms, therapy should be modified, aiming for the most narrow-spectrum drug or drugs likely to be effective. If diagnostic studies are negative after 48 to 72 hours and the patient is not exhibiting signs of sepsis, antibiotic therapy should be discontinued, unless the patient is profoundly granulocytopenic.6.Beyond monitoring for efficacy and adverse drug effects such as hypersensitivity or organ toxicity, it is essential that monitoring include surveillance for superinfection by resistant bacteria or Candida and for C. difficile diarrhea.7.Surgical antimicrobial prophylaxis should not extend beyond 24 hours postoperatively258, 259 and in most operations can be limited to a single dose.258\n\n",

In 289 patients, Merrer and colleagues311 found that insertion of an IVD in the femoral versus the subclavian vein was associated with a greatly increased risk of infection (20 versus 3.7 BSIs per 1000 IVD-days, P<.001) and thrombotic complications (21.5% versus 1.9%, P <.001).311 Moreover, Robert and colleagues312 found that patients with primary BSI were more likely to have received care during times when there was a lower nursing-to-patient ratio and a higher proportion of temporary (\u201cfloat\u201d) nurses rather than the fulltime nursing staff.312\n",

However, the astute clinician can mitigate much of the risk associated with vascular access by choosing the best device for the task at hand and inserting the IVD in a location associated with the least risk of infection. Studies suggest that multilumen IVDs are associated with a higher risk of infection than single-lumen catheters.314 That said, if a patient has need for multiple infusions, inserting several single lumen catheters will pose greater risks than a single multilumen catheter.To date, there have been no randomized studies designed to evaluate the optimal location for placement of short-term CVCs. However, the data accumulated from numerous observational studies suggest that the lowest risk of IVD-related BSI is seen with subclavian vein insertion and the highest risk with femoral vein insertion, with an intermediate level of risk associated with jugular vein insertions.303, 311\nThe femoral vein is often used for central venous access, especially on nonsurgical services, because of the ease of cannulation and the lower risk of mechanical complications from insertion (i.e., bleeding or pneumothorax). Unfortunately, prospective studies evaluating the risk of femoral vein device placement have shown that CVCs placed in the femoral vein are more likely to be colonized at the time of removal than catheters placed in the internal jugular vein (RR = 4.7, CI = 2 to 8.8, P = .0001)315 and are associated with an increased risk of IVD-related BSI when compared with CVCs placed in the subclavian vein (4.4% versus 1.5%, P = .07).311 Furthermore, recent prospective studies have found higher rates of catheter-related deep vein thrombosis with femoral catheters, in the range of 7% to 25%.310, 311 In general, we believe femoral access should be used only if emergent access is required, the inexperience of the operator limits placement in the upper body, or there is a contraindication to placement in the upper body (no available sites, an extensive burn, or severe coagulopathy). If a short-term CVC must be placed in the femoral vein or artery, we believe it is important that the catheter insertion site be located at least 2 inches (5 cm) below the inguinal crease or an intertriginous area, which is heavily colonized with bowel organisms and yeasts; this also allows a more secure protective dressing to be affixed.In contrast to short-term CVCs, observational studies of hemodialysis catheters have not been able to confirm a lower rate of infection with catheters inserted in the subclavian vein as compared with those inserted in the internal jugular vein,316 although there is still excess risk associated with femoral vein placement.317 More importantly, prospective studies of catheters used for hemodialysis have demonstrated a significant risk of great vein thrombosis and stenosis in catheters inserted into the subclavian vein that approaches 40% to 50% as compared with rates of 0% to 10% with catheters inserted into the internal jugular vein.318, 319 On the basis of these data, internal jugular vein insertion is preferable to subclavian vein insertion for central access for hemodialysis.2.\nBarrier precautions: Hand hygiene with an antiseptic-containing preparation, either conventional handwashing with chlorhexidine (2% to 4%) or with a waterless alcohol rub or gel,171 must always precede the insertion of an IVD and should also precede subsequent handling of the device or its administration set.129 A new pair of disposable, nonsterile gloves, using a \u201cno-touch\u201d technique, is adequate for the placement of peripheral IV catheters in most patients; however, sterile gloves should be used during insertion in high-risk patients such as those with granulocytopenia. Sterile gloves are strongly recommended for placement of all other types of IVDs that are associated with a 1% or higher risk of associated bacteremia, specifically arterial catheters and all types of centrally placed devices including PICCs.129\nStudies have shown that the use of maximal barriers including a long-sleeved, sterile surgical gown, mask, cap and large sterile drape, and sterile gloves significantly reduces the risk of CVC-related BSI (0.08 BSIs with maximal barriers versus 0.5 BSIs per 1000 IVD-days without maximal barriers, P = .02).320 The use of maximal barriers has further been shown to be highly cost effective.320 Considering that of all IVDs, CVCs are most likely to produce nosocomial BSI, a strong case can be made for mandating maximal barrier precautions during the insertion of all central IVDs.129 They are not necessary, however, for arterial catheters used for hemodynamic monitoring, during which sterile gloves and a sterile fenestrated drape will suffice.321\n3.\nIV teams: Good technique is also essential. Studies have shown that the use of special IV therapy teams, consisting of trained nurses or technicians who can assure a consistent and high level of aseptic technique during catheter insertion and in follow-up care of the catheter, have been associated with substantially lower rates of catheter-related BSI and are cost effective.322, 323 But even if an institution does not have an IV team, it can greatly reduce its rate of IVD-related BSI by formal education of nurses and physicians and stringent adherence to IVD care protocols.324, 325\n4.\nCutaneous antisepsis: Given the evidence for the importance of cutaneous microorganisms in the pathogenesis of short-term IVD-related infections, measures to reduce colonization of the insertion site would seem of the highest priority, particularly the choice of chemical antiseptics for disinfection of the site. Nine randomized, prospective trials comparing a chlorhexidine-containing antiseptic to either povidone-iodine or alcohol for preparation of the skin prior to insertion of a short-term IVD have been reported.201, 202, 203, 326 In the largest study to date, a randomized trial in 1050 CVCs and arterial catheters placed in a university hospital ICU, cutaneous antisepsis with 1% tincture of chlorhexidine showed a highly significant reduction in IVD-related BSIs compared with an iodophor (RR = 0.35, P < .01).326 More recently, a meta-analysis that examined results from eight of the nine aforementioned studies found that use of chlorhexidine was associated with a nearly 50% reduction in the risk of IVD-related compared with povidone-iodine (RR = 0.49, 95% CI = 0.28 to 0.88).201\n\n",

            "text": "\n1.\nIVD dressings: IVDs can be dressed with sterile gauze and tape or with a sterile transparent, semipermeable, polyurethane film dressing. The available data suggest that the two types of dressings are equivalent in terms of their impact on IVD-related BSI with peripheral IVs and short-term CVCs.327, 328, 329 In contrast, results from studies of arterial catheters have found that polyurethane dressings greatly increase the risk of IVD-related BSI.327, 330 As a result, polyurethane dressings should probably not be used on arterial catheters until future studies confirm their safety.2.\nTopical antimicrobial ointments: In theory, application of a topical antimicrobial agent to the catheter insertion site should confer some protection against microbial invasion. Clinical trials of a topical combination antibacterial ointment containing polymyxin, neomycin, and bacitracin with peripheral IVs have shown marginal benefit,331 but the use of polyantibiotic ointments has been associated with a fivefold increased frequency of Candida infection, limiting their utility.331, 332\nThe topical antibacterial mupirocin, which is active primarily against gram-positive organisms, was shown in one study to significantly reduce colonization of internal jugular catheters without increasing colonization by Candida spp.,333 and a more recent study by Sesso and colleagues334 showed significant reductions in hemodialysis catheter colonization (3.17 versus 14.27 per 1000 IVD-days, P = <.001) and S. aureus IVD-related BSIs (0.71 versus 8.92 BSIs per 1000 IVD-days, P = <.001).334 Unfortunately, resistance of S. aureus\n335 and coagulase-negative staphylococci336 rapidly emerges during wide-scale mupirocin use,337 which contravenes its use as a topical agent for the prevention of IVD-related BSI at this time.129\nThree prospective studies of topical povidone-iodine ointment applied to central venous catheter sites have failed to show a statistical benefit to its use,331, 338, 339 but a single comparative trial in subclavian hemodialysis catheters showed that the use of topical povidone-iodine ointment was associated with a fourfold reduction in the incidence of IVD-related S. aureus BSI.340 Therefore if a topical agent is to be used with hemodialysis catheters, an iodophor may be most desirable.3.\nReplacement of the device: Studies have shown that peripheral IVs may be safely left in place for up to 96 hours if the patient and the insertion site is monitored closely.341 Studies have suggested that the duration of peripheral catheterization may be prolonged even further,342 but, viewing reports of increasing nosocomial S. aureus bacteremias linked to prolonged peripheral venous catheterization,343 more studies are required before this can become considered acceptable routinely.Scheduled replacement of short-term, noncuffed, nontunneled CVCs has long been practiced in many centers; however, some studies have called this practice into question.344 Moreover, a meta-analysis found no benefit to routine replacement of short-term CVCs.345 On the basis of these data, there appears to be no indication for scheduled replacement of short-term CVCs that are functioning well and show no clinical signs of infection.4.\nGuidewire exchanges of CVCs: The management of CVCs that must be replaced, either because of mechanical malfunction or suspected infection, deserves special attention. Replacement of CVCs by guidewire exchange is associated with a reduced risk of mechanical complications344, 345; however, it is also associated with an increased risk of the newly placed CVC becoming infected and causing CVC-related BSI.344 As a result, if circumstances necessitate guidewire exchange for placement of a new catheter (e.g., the patient has limited sites for access, is morbidly obese, or is at high risk of mechanical complications because of underlying coagulopathy), the same strict aseptic technique, which includes full barrier precautions, must be used. However, the tip and/or intracutaneous segment(s) of the removed CVC should routinely be sent for culture to determine whether the insertion tract is colonized. If it is, the newly inserted CVC should be promptly removed and a new CVC placed percutaneously in a new site. If the tract is not colonized, the newly exchanged CVC can remain in the old insertion site.Although small studies have found some utility of guidewire exchange in the management of CVCs suspected of being infected,346, 347 we believe that, in the absence of randomized studies demonstrating its safety, guidewire exchange generally should not be performed if there is suspicion of IVD-related BSI, especially if there are signs of local infection such as purulence or erythema at the insertion site or signs of systemic sepsis without a source. In these cases the old catheter should be removed and cultured, and a new catheter should be inserted in a new site.5.\nReplacing the delivery system: Whereas most infusion-related BSIs are caused by infection of the device used for vascular access, infusate can occasionally become contaminated and cause endemic BSIs.303, 348 If an infusion runs continuously for an extended period, the cumulative risk of contamination increases, and there is further risk that contaminants can grow to concentrations that could produce BSI in the recipient of the fluid. For more than 25 years, most U.S. hospitals have routinely replaced the entire delivery system of patients' IV infusions at 24- or 48-hour intervals349 to reduce the risk of BSI from extrinsically contaminated fluid. Prospective studies indicate that IV delivery systems need not be replaced more frequently than every 72 to 96 hours, including infusions used for total parenteral nutrition or any infusions in ICU patients341, 350; extending the duration of use can permit cost savings to hospitals.350\nFour clinical settings might be regarded as exceptions to using 72 hours as an interval for routine set change350: (1) administration of blood products, (2) administration of lipid emulsion, (3) arterial pressure monitoring, and (4) suspicion of an epidemic of infusion-related BSI. In these circumstances, it may be most prudent for administration sets to be changed routinely at 24- or 48-hour intervals.Arterial infusions used for hemodynamic monitoring appear to be more vulnerable to becoming contaminated during use and producing endemic348 or epidemic septicemia,96 caused by gramnegative bacilli. If the infusion for hemodynamic monitoring is set up so that the fluid flows continuously through the system, thus eliminating a blind stagnant column of fluid, extrinsic contamination appears to be greatly reduced and may even eliminate the need to replace the administration set, transducer assembly, and other components of the system at frequent intervals.351, 352 If disposable transducers are used, there appears to be no need to replace the transducer assembly and other components of the delivery system more frequently than every 4 days,351 and it may be safe to replace them even less frequently.352\n6.\nAnticoagulation: Thrombus formation on an intravascular device is associated with an increased risk of infection.353, 354 Two prospective studies have been performed to examine the efficacy of warfarin anticoagulation for reducing rates of IVD-associated thrombosis with long-term IVDs.355, 356 Both studies found that use of warfarin in a dose of 1 mg/day was associated with significantly reduced rates of thrombosis with long-term IVDs, although no data were provided on rates of IVD-related BSI.The use of prophylactic heparin for reducing rates of IVD-related thrombosis and infection has been evaluated in a meta-analysis.357 Examining a variety of different administration techniques in 14 randomized controlled studies, Randolph and colleagues357 concluded that systemic heparinization significantly reduced the risk of IVD-associated thrombosis (RR = 0.43, CI = 0.23-0.78) and device colonization (RR = 0.18, CI = 0.06 to 0.6) but failed to show a reduction in IVD-related BSIs. Heparin-bonded pulmonary artery catheters may be less prone to IVD-related BSI than nonheparinized catheters.303, 358, 359\nOn the basis of these studies, low-level anticoagulation with warfarin is warranted for long-term IVDs as long as there is no contraindication (bleeding diathesis, brain tumor, or predilection to falls) and the INR is maintained below 1.6.355 For short-term IVDs, the use of low-dose subcutaneous heparin is more appropriate; it is commonly given to patients with CVCs or arterial lines as part of ICU thromboembolism prophylaxis.\n",

            "text": "Despite compliance with recommended guidelines, many centers continue to have high rates of IVD-related BSI. Novel technology holds much promise (Table 51-13\n). Innovative technologies designed to reduce the risk of IVD-related BSI have proved to be not only effective but also to reduce health care costs, both with short-term and long-term IVDs.301, 360\n1.\nNovel securement devices: Recently, a novel sutureless device for securing noncuffed vascular catheters has become available (StatLock, Venetec International). In a randomized trial of the device, premature loss of pediatric PICCs caused by accidental extrusion and PICC-associated thrombosis was significantly reduced,361 and in two additional trials the incidence of catheter-related BSI was significantly reduced with the use of the novel securement device, both in adults and children with PICCs.361, 362\nThe promise of this device for reducing infection may derive from elimination of a festering skin suture wound contiguous to the newly inserted catheter and minimizing to-and-fro movement of the catheter, which may promote invasion of the tract by cutaneous microorganisms through capillary action.363\n2.\nNovel dressings: Studies of polyurethane dressings, which contain antiseptics such as povidone-iodine or ionized silver, have been disappointing. However, on the basis of demonstrated superiority of chlorhexidine for cutaneous disinfection of access sites, a novel chlorhexidine-impregnated sponge dressing has been developed (Biopatch, Johnson and Johnson Medical, Inc.). It maintains a high concentration of the antiseptic on the insertion site under the dressing. The largest study to date found that use of the chlorhexidine-impregnated sponge dressing was associated with a 60% reduction in catheter-related BSI (RR = 0.37, P = .01).364 Although there were no adverse side effects associated with the use of this dressing in this trial in adults, a pediatric trial found that 15% of low-birth-weight neonates developed local dermatotoxicity.365\n3.\nAnti-infective impregnated catheters: Intravascular devices directly coated or impregnated with antimicrobials or antiseptics have been intensively studied over the past decade. Eighteen randomized trials evaluating the efficacy of chlorhexidine-silver-sulfadiazine\u2013 or minocycline-rifampin\u2013impregnated CVCs have been published in full article or abstract form since 1994.268, 269, 291, 366, 367\nOf the 16 published studies that examined the effect of antimicrobial-impregnated CVCs on rates of CVC-related BSI, 12 found either a statistically significant reduction or a strong trend toward a reduction in rates of CVC-related BSI.366, 367 Aggregate analysis of the 15 studies that compared antimicrobial-impregnated CVCs with nonimpregnated CVCs,366, 367 encompassing a total of 4250 CVCs, shows that antimicrobial-impregnated CVCs are associated with a 40% reduction in CVC-related BSI (61 BSIs/2129 devices versus 101 BSIs/2118 devices, OR 0.60, 95% CI = 0.44 to 0.82, P = .001), a result remarkably similar to the findings of three published meta-analyses.301, 368, 369\nFinally, two rigorous and sophisticated economic analyses have found that antimicrobial-impregnated CVCs are cost effective.370, 371 Veenstra and colleagues showed that antimicrobial-impregnated CVCs remained cost effective even if the cost of a CVC-related BSI was as low as $687 per case; cost savings were $196 per antimicrobial-impregnated CVC when a more realistic cost of a CVC-related BSI of $9738 was used in the analysis.370 Shorr and colleagues371 showed that use of antimicrobial-impregnated CVCs was associated with a cost savings of $9600 per CVC-related BSI prevented and that $165 to $280 would be saved for every patient who received an antimicrobial-impregnated CVC.On the basis of this large body of data, two national advisory panels have recommended the use of antimicrobial-impregnated CVCs in clinical settings where, despite rigorous application of other preventive interventions, rates of IVD-related BSI remain unacceptably high (i.e., \u2265 3.3 BSIs per 1000 IVD-days).129, 372\n4.\nAntimicrobial lock solutions: Given the importance of hub contamination and intraluminal colonization in the genesis of IVD-related BSI with long-term IVDs, intraluminal instillation of an antibiotic or antiseptic solution has the potential to reduce the risk of BSI associated with these devices. Six randomized, prospective trials have examined a vancomycin-containing antibiotic lock solution for the prevention of IVD-related BSI, the largest of which found that use of a vancomycin or vancomycin/ciprofloxacin lock solution reduced the risk of IVD-related BSI nearly 80% (P = .005), with no evidence that the use of the lock solution promoted colonization or infection by vancomycin-resistant bacteria or fungi.373, 374 Yet concern about the emergence of resistance with prophylactic antibiotic-containing lock solutions has limited their wider acceptance to date. However, the use of prophylactic antibiotic lock solution is considered acceptable in the 2001 HICPAC Guideline if a patient with an essential long-term IVD has continued to experience recurrent IVD-related BSIs despite consistent application of infection control practices.129\nVarious other prophylactic lock solutions have been studied as a means of preventing IVD-related BSI including trisodium citrate/gentamicin,375 minocycline/ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA),376 ethanol,377 and taurolidine-containing solutions.378 Concerns about increased IVD complication rates378 and drug-related toxicity375 associated with the use of certain types of lock solutions, combined with the limited number of patients who have been studied while receiving these agents, precludes their routine use at this time.5.\nCatheter hubs: A novel catheter hub that contains a chamber filled with iodinated alcohol has been shown to be effective in preventing colonization of IVDs in an animal model.379 Use of this same hub model in some clinical studies has demonstrated significantly lower rates of IVD colonization compared with IVDs with control hubs.380, 381 One clinical trial has also demonstrated reduced rates of IVD-related BSIs with use of this hub (4% versus 16%, P <.01). A subsequent study also showed a reduction in hub-related IVD-related BSIs (1.7% versus 7%, P < .049), but overall rates of IVD-related BSIs in both groups were similar.381 Another study was unable to find any benefit with regards to IVD colonization or IVD-related BSI with use of the novel hub.382 This device is not yet available in the United States and until further studies more conclusively demonstrate its benefit, its use cannot be recommended at this time.\n",

A recent randomized study that sought to maintain head elevation above 45 degrees for 85% of the study period found that head elevation in the intervention arm only averaged 28.1 degrees.444 Perhaps as a result of failure to successfully achieve adequate elevation, no reductions in the rate of VAP were seen.",

However, it has facilitated the idea that topical decolonization of the oropharynx with nonantimicrobial agents might be able to materially reduce the risk of VAP without the potential for emergence of antimicrobial resistance. A recent meta-analysis of seven randomized trials that enrolled 914 mechanically ventilated patients found that topical chlorhexidine applied to the oropharynx reduced the risk of VAP by nearly 30% (RR = 0.74, 95% CI 0.56 to 0.96, P = .02), although there was no significant impact on mortality.407 The beneficial effects of chlorhexidine appear to be most pronounced in post\u2013cardiac surgery patients,466, 467 prompting HICPAC to recommend its use in this subpopulation.131\n",

Extraluminal contamination may occur early, by direct inoculation when the catheter is inserted, or later, by organisms ascending from the perineum by capillary action in the thin mucous film between the external catheter surface and the urethral wall. Intraluminal contamination occurs by reflux of microorganisms gaining access to the catheter lumen from failure of closed drainage or contamination of urine in the collection bag.

The role of the biofilm in the pathogenesis of CAUTI has not been established. However, anti-infective\u2013impregnated and silver-hydrogel catheters, which inhibit adherence of microorganisms to the catheter surface, significantly reduce the risk of CAUTI,477 particularly infections caused by gram-positive organisms or yeasts, which are most likely to be acquired extraluminally from the periurethral flora. These data suggest that microbial adherence to the catheter surface is important in the pathogenesis of many, but not all, CAUTIs.

Medicated catheters, which reduce adherence of microorganisms to the catheter surface, may confer the greatest benefit for preventing CAUTI.

By the 1990s, the availability of antibiotics from a variety of distinct classes\u2014aminoglycosides, broad-spectrum penicillins (e.g., piperacillin), monobactams (e.g., aztreonam), carbapenems (e.g., imipenem), \u03b2-lactam\u2013beta-lactamase inhibitors (e.g., piperacillin-tazobactam), trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, and fluoroquinolones\u2014promised a respite from concerns about resistance in aerobic gram\u2013negative bacilli. During this period, however, gram-positive cocci gained prominence, and MRSA \u03b2-lactam\u2013resistant coagulase-negative staphylococci and VRE became the major problem nosocomial pathogens. Antibiotic pressure, deriving first from the widespread use of third-generation cephalosporin antibiotics in hospitals, is often cited as a major factor in the emergence of MRSA. Co-emerging as nosocomial pathogens with MRSA have been methicillin-resistant coagulase-negative staphylococci, which have become the leading cause of IVD-related BSI and prosthesis-related surgical site infections.",

For example, use of trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole has been associated statistically with emergence of ceftazidime-resistant E. coli and K. pneumoniae as a result of linkage on a single plasmid of genes that encode production of ESBLs and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole resistance.

Numerous studies have documented major shifts in the microbial ecology of the ICU with the use of SDD.514, 515, 516 In a study by Lingnau and colleagues,514 4.5 years of SDD with ciprofloxacin led to a marked increase in MRSA infection from 17% to 81% and of ciprofloxacin-resistant S. aureus from 33% to 80%.

In order to better address this issue, well-designed, cluster-randomized trials that employ multilevel modeling and specifically address the effects of SDD on antimicrobial resistance across the entire spectrum of microbial pathogens at the institutional level are necessary. Until such data are available, we believe that continued North American concerns about the effects of SDD on antimicrobial resistance are justified, particularly in institutions where MRSA and VRE are endemic, which encompasses virtually all larger hospitals. Given that other effective measures for prevention of nosocomial infection exist, we believe that SDD should be restricted to select patients, such as certain trauma patients, or as a potential adjunctive control measure for a nosocomial outbreak caused by multiply resistant organisms.517\n",

Nosocomial colonization occurred later among isolated patients (median 12 versus 7 days) and was associated with subsequent infection in 2 patients, as compared with 12 patients given standard care. Among children who were isolated, the interval before the first infection was significantly longer (median, 20 versus 8 days), the daily infection rate was twofold lower (86 versus 44 infections per 1000 ICU days), and there were 50% fewer days with fever. The benefit of isolation was most notable after 7 days of ICU care. Isolation was well tolerated by patients and their families. Unannounced monitoring showed that children in each group were touched and handled indiscernibly by hospital personnel and families.",

Further studies are necessary to determine the cost effectiveness of prophylactic barrier precautions in the ICU and especially the efficacy of protective isolation in adult surgical ICUs, where the incidence of nosocomial infection is as high as 35%.

This must be conveyed in initial orientation programs for all new personnel including physicians and by periodic updates on each patient care unit and presentations at staff conferences. The topic can also be periodically reviewed in the hospital's newsletter for personnel. Prominently placed posters warning of the hazards of sharps injuries and listing simple precautions to avert such injuries, especially in areas where sharps are heavily used, may also be of value.2.Sharps disposal units should be made widely and conveniently available throughout the hospital, especially in locations that facilitate their immediate use: in individual patient rooms, nursing stations, pharmacy units, and utility rooms; in all clinical laboratories; on anesthesia carts; and in each operating room. Receptacles should be made of impervious material such as plastic or metal and should be emptied according to an established routine by personnel who have been properly instructed. Disposal units should consist of impervious receptacles into which a used needle and syringe or other sharp can be immediately dropped without handling it further. If it is necessary to remove a used needle from a syringe or Vacutainer, an instrument should always be used.3.Recapping or resheathing of used needles must be strongly discouraged except when rare circumstances do not permit immediate disposal, in which case capping must be done using a \u201cone-handed technique\u201d or special sheath.4.Medical or nursing personnel must be apprised of the importance of obtaining adequate assistance when administering injections or infusion therapy to patients who may not be able to cooperate.5.Personnel must be apprised of the need to use extreme care in cleaning up after procedures that involve needles or other sharps such as lumbar punctures, thoracentesis, or central venous catheter placement.6.A strong institutional commitment to the continuous evaluation and selective adoption of technology-based approaches to prevention of sharps injuries will have the greatest impact.7.With accidental sharps injuries, unless the injury occurred with a clean sharp not used on a patient, the injury should be immediately reported to the employee health service, where work-related injuries in general can be evaluated and managed most consistently and inexpensively and surveillance of all work-related injuries can be assisted. A mechanism to ensure prompt management of biohazardous injuries 24 hours a day (including during nights and weekends by emergency department personnel who have been trained in the institutional biohazardous injury protocol) must be available.All hospital personnel who render care or services to patients including all staff physicians, house officers, and health care students should be covered by this institutional service to ensure consistent reporting and treatment of injuries.Employee health service personnel should meet with each employee sustaining a biohazardous injury, ascertain the exact reason for the accident, and review how to prevent a similar injury in the future. Particular attention should be given to those HCWs who have sustained repeated injuries to identify accident-prone activities or individuals or high-risk work situations that should be modified.8.Institutions should carry out continuous surveillance and reporting of all biohazardous injuries, which can form the basis for preventive programs and determine their effectiveness. Risk management personnel should include sharps injury reduction as a major institutional priority.9.Management of sharps injuries: It is beyond the scope of this review to provide a comprehensive protocol for management of sharps injuries; however, it is imperative that all hospitals have a protocol that provides unambiguous guidelines for management, specifically the following:a.Clear definitions of biohazardous injuriesb.Procedures for immediate care of the injury at the time of occurrence (e.g., squeezing the puncture wound to induce bleeding, disinfection with a virucidal agent, such as an iodophor)c.Procedures to determine expeditiously the magnitude of risk (i.e., screening the source patient for evidence of active infection by hepatitis B virus; hepatitis C virus; and HIV). With regard to HIV screening, the protocol must be in compliance with state statutes governing HIV testing.d.The responsibilities of the injured HCW; the worker's supervisor; the employee health service; and, after working hours, the emergency departmente.Guidelines for postexposure immunoprophylaxis and drug therapy, especially with exposures to the following:Hepatitis A, B, and CHIVJakob-Creutzfeldt diseaseSyphilisMalariaBacteremia\nf.Follow-up of the exposed HCW, especially following exposures to HIV; hepatitis B virus; and hepatitis C virusg.Administrative follow-up of all injuries, to minimize recurrences, and institutional surveillance of biohazardous injuriesh.Periodic review of the protocol, with revision as indicated\n\n\u00a9 2008 2008Since January 2020 Elsevier has created a COVID-19 resource centre with free information in English and Mandarin on the novel coronavirus COVID-19.

In the absence of a positive history, all HCWs should undergo serologic testing to confirm seropositivity or be immunized with the live, attenuated vaccine.559 Susceptible HCWs should not care for patients with suspected or confirmed varicella or zoster infections, particularly if pregnant. In the event of an accidental exposure, susceptible HCWs should undergo varicella immunization within 72 hours of exposure on the basis of studies demonstrating a reduced risk of developing clinical infection and attenuated clinical disease.560 The routine use of varicella-zoster immune globulin (VZIG) for PEP of susceptible HCWs exposed to VZV is not recommended.559 Rather, the decision to administer VZIG should be guided by the presence of risk factors that increase the risk of severe disease (e.g., pregnancy or other immunodeficient conditions such as advanced AIDS).",

Should the frequency of handwashing, as well as the agents used, be critically reexamined? Beyond a certain frequency, more may not necessarily be better. Should handwashing machines, which substantially augment degerming,594, 595 be adopted widely?

            "text": "\nKEY POINTS\n\u25aaPatients in modern-day ICUs experience rates of nosocomial infection three to five times higher than non-ICU hospitalized patients. Rates of primary bacteremia and nosocomial pneumonia are up to 10 times higher.\u25aaPatients who are severely immunocompromised or who are critically ill and have high severity of illness scores have a substantially increased risk of nosocomial infection. However, most nosocomial infections in the ICU appear causally to be most directly related to life-saving technology, particularly invasive devices such as endotracheal tubes and mechanical ventilatory support, urethral and intravascular catheters, and intraventricular catheters, which facilitate colonization by nosocomial organisms and greatly increase vulnerability to infection.\u25aaThe major reservoir of bacterial nosocomial pathogens, and possibly Candida as well, in the ICU is the colonized or infected patient. Most infections begin with nosocomial colonization by organisms acquired from the hands of noncolonized HCWs. Increasing evidence suggests that antibiotic-resistant organisms, particularly MRSA, resistant enterococci, and C. difficile, may also be acquired from the inanimate environment immediately surrounding the patient. Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Legionella, Aspergillus, influenza A virus, varicella-zoster virus, measles, mumps, and the new highly virulent SARS human coronavirus are transmitted by the airborne route.\u25aaICUs are uniquely conducive to the epidemic spread of nosocomial organisms of all types, especially antibiotic-resistant bacteria and even Candida; more than half of all hospital epidemics occur in ICUs.\u25aaAn active, visible institutional infection control program can prevent up to one third of nosocomial infections. Surveillance of infection, whether total or focused, and education of all personnel are the most essential components of the program.\u25aaUse of a chlorhexidine-containing agent for handwashing between patients will reduce endemic nosocomial infections in the ICU by at least 30%. The regular use of waterless alcohol-containing hand rubs or gels may provide comparable benefit in prevention of cross-infection.\u25aaStringent attention to isolation precautions, especially disposable gloves and a gown for contacts with patients known to be infected or colonized by resistant organisms, is mandatory to minimize cross-infection and prevent outbreaks. Misuse of gloves as part of universal precautions may, paradoxically, increase the risk of nosocomial infection.\u25aaModern-day ICUs must have adequate numbers of special negative-pressure isolation rooms for the care of patients with suspected or proven pulmonary tuberculosis and other airborne infections, such as varicella-zoster virus.\u25aaPatients who have undergone recent bone marrow transplants or who have received intensive chemotherapy and are experiencing prolonged severe granulocytopenia should receive ICU care in special HEPA-filtered positive-pressure isolation rooms to protect them from devastating deep Aspergillus and other filamentous fungal infection.\u25aaMeticulous attention to aseptic technique and the use of maximal barrier precautions\u2014long-sleeved sterile surgical gown, mask and head cover, as well as sterile gloves\u2014during the insertion of central venous catheters; the use of 2% chlorhexidine solutions for cutaneous antisepsis; avoiding insertion into the femoral veins; and prompt removal of catheters as soon as they are no longer necessary can reduce the incidence of catheter-related bloodstream infection at least threefold.\u25aaStudies suggest that the prophylactic use of simple barrier precautions, vis-\u00e0-vis protective isolation, may provide protection against all types of ICU-acquired infection. Protective isolation is more appealing ecologically than the use of SDD.\u25aaMeasures to avert needle sticks and other sharps injuries are the most important aspect of universal precautions; these measures are necessary to protect the HCWs from HIV and other bloodborne viruses.\u25aaA crisis of antibiotic resistance exists in ICUs. The progressive increase in antibiotic resistance of nosocomial staphylococci (methicillin), gramnegative bacilli (aminoglycosides and expanded-spectrum beta-lactams), and enterococci (vancomycin or ampicillin), and the sixfold increase in Candida infections during the past 2 decades indicates that it is of highest priority to reduce antimicrobial pressure within ICUs.\u25aaNovel technology holds the greatest promise for prevention of nosocomial infection in general, particularly the development of medical devices that are intrinsically resistant to infection.\u25aaIdentifying more effective ways to communicate knowledge of infection control to hospital personnel, especially with regard to handwashing, aseptic use of devices, and antibiotic therapy, and to apply it consistently in all hospitals would have vast immediate benefits.\n\n",
