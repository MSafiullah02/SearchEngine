On the one hand, there are the unspecific, nonadaptive immune reactions, which recognize and eliminate invading foreign pathogens. This so-called natural or innate immune system becomes primarily active after a virus has overcome the external physical protection barriers of the body (skin, mucous membranes). It consists of dendritic cells, granulocytes, monocytes, macrophages and natural killer cells (NK cells) . They have proteins that serve as receptors, e.g. Toll-like receptors (TLRs) and complement receptors, for specific structures of pathogens and for the soluble products of the innate immune system (acute-phase proteins, factors of the complement system, cytokines, chemokines and interferons). The effects and functions of cytokines, chemokines and interferons will be discussed separately in \u25b6 Chap. 8. The specific, adaptive immune response is the second line of defence, and is developed only during or after the establishment of an infection. It includes antibody-producing B cells -the humoral immune system -as well as T-helper (T H ) cells and cytotoxic T lymphocytes, which collectively constitute the cellular defence system. The adaptive immune reactions can selectively recognize certain pathogen types or subtypes, and in the case of a reinfection, they are able to recognize the pathogens again and eliminate them. They are long-lasting and a subset of stimulated lymphocytes transform into memory cells during their development, which confers on the organism an efficient protective immunity against infections with the same pathogen. The systems of the specific and non-specific immune responses are in close contact with each other, particularly via cytokines, chemokines and interferons. An immune response is generally triggered by antigens. These may be the infectious pathogens, individual protein components or sugar structures. The immune system recognizes these as foreign, and thus can distinguish between endogenous and exogenous components. However, the antigens must be of a certain size to trigger different immune responses. Molecules with a molecular mass of less than 3-4 kDa are usually incapable of doing that.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 513, "end": 523, "text": "(NK cells)", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [], "section": ""}, {"text": "What Are the Cellular and Molecular Components of the Immune System that Constitute the \"First Front\" Against Invading Pathogens?", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "7.1"}, {"text": "Dendritic cells are white blood cells which are characterized by highly ramified outgrowths or projections of the cell membrane (Latin dendriticus meaning \"ramified\" or \"branched\"). Plasmacytoid (lymphoid) dendritic cells and myeloid dendritic cells originate from haematopoietic progenitor cells in the bone marrow; myeloid dendritic cells probably differentiate alternatively into macrophages direct from monocytes. As immature dendritic cells, they migrate from the blood into almost all tissues of the body, where they establish a dense network of sentinel cells, which ingest extracellular components by phagocytosis and endocytosis, similarly to neutrophils and macrophages. The Langerhans cells of the skin and mucous membranes, the Kupffer cells of the liver, the interdigitating cells of the spleen and lymph nodes, interstitial dendritic cells and the M cells of mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue are tissue dendritic cells. They constantly check their environment for invasion and the presence of pathogens (viruses, bacteria, fungi), which they recognize by interacting with receptors of the pattern recognition receptor family. These include TLRs that recognize pathogen-specific structures and bind to them (Sect. 7.1.5). In dendritic cells these contacts induce the synthesis and secretion of large amounts of interferon-a (IFN-a) and interferon-b (INF-b) as well as proinflammatory cytokines; this gives rise to the activation of granulocytes and macrophages, which move to the infection site. In the course of this process, dendritic cells mature and phagocytose the pathogens. Like macrophages, they can present peptides which result from the degradation of pathogen proteins in complex with MHC class II proteins on their cell surface, thus inducing the defence responses of the specific immune system. Unlike macrophages, dendritic cells are able to leave the tissues to which they had migrated, and reach in activated form, via streaming lymph fluid, the spleen and lymph nodes, the local organizing centres of the immune defence. There, they interact as antigen-presenting cells with B and T lymphocytes, and thus are decisively involved in the induction of the specific immune response: they activate T H lymphocytes and macrophages, regulate the cytokine pattern of the emerging T H lymphocytes into interferon-g (IFN-g)producing T H 1 cells or IL-4 producing T H 2 cells, initiate the formation of cytotoxic T lymphocytes and induce, using the assistance of T cells, the differentiation of plasma cells into antibody-producing B lymphocytes. Therefore, dendritic cells are highly specialized to stimulate specific immune responses and are an important link between the unspecific and the specific immune defence systems. Although follicular dendritic cells morphologically resemble the plasmacytoid and myeloid dendritic cells, they have completely different functions. They are resident and non-motile cells in the germinal centres of lymph nodes and other secondary lymphoid organs (e.g. spleen, tonsils, Peyer patches). They probably do not originate from bone marrow precursor cells and cannot phagocytose and degrade pathogens or protein components of pathogens. By contrast, on their surface they have Fc immunoglobulin receptors and C3 complement receptors through which they bind to antigen-antibody complexes. They present these complexes to B lymphocytes and induce their proliferation and maturation. In the course of this, for instance, the immunoglobulin class switch occurs (Sect. 7.2.2).", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Dendritic Cells"}, {"text": "Approximately 60-70 % of all circulating white blood cells are granulocytes, which have a polymorphic nucleus divided into three to four segments and possess a large number of lysosomes in the cytoplasm. The latter are referred to as granules owing to their appearance in microscopic images. These cells are produced in the bone marrow, from which they migrate into the blood. They have a relatively short halflife of 2-3 days. Because of the different dyeability of their granules, which primarily contain proteases and other degrading enzymes, they can be divided into neutrophil, eosinophil and basophil subgroups.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Granulocytes"}, {"text": "In particular, neutrophils, which represent the largest subpopulation (about 90 %), are involved in the first defence mechanisms against viral infections; humans produce about 10 11 neutrophils per day. During the first few hours after their formation they still do not have a segmented nucleus; thus they are called unsegmented. To reach the infected tissue, neutrophils leave the bloodstream and the vascular system in a multistage process that is mediated by adhesion molecules and chemokines (chemotactic, soluble, attracting proteins which are released by activated dendritic cells). They attach to endothelial cells by adhesion molecules on their cell surfaces, such as L-selectin, vascular cell adhesion molecule 1 and intercellular adhesion molecule 1, which in turn -also chemokine-mediatedproduce the corresponding ligands (E-selectin and P selectin, integrins).", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Granulocytes"}, {"text": "This enables granulocytes to pass through the intercellular spaces of the endothelium which line the blood capillaries. In the course of this, they migrate to the inflammation or infection sites along a concentration gradient of chemokines, to which they bind by the corresponding chemokine receptors on their surface, and are the first immune cells to arrive there. Upon contact with the pathogens, neutrophils release the content of their granules into the surrounding region, or they phagocytose the pathogens. These are then surrounded by membrane vesicles, the phagosomes, which fuse with intracellular granules to form phagolysosomes. In this way, the agents are confronted with a plethora of degrading enzymes (including proteases, lysozymes, myeloperoxidases, hydrolases and muraminidases) and are killed. Granulocytes are stimulated by interaction with pathogens. As a result, granulocytes produce a variety of inflammatory factors such as IL-8, IL-1, IL-6 and TNF-a as well as leukotrienes and prostaglandins. In particular, IL-8 has a chemotactic effect and lures more granulocytes and T lymphocytes to the infection site. The substances released act not only in an immunoregulatory manner. Some of them, e.g. IL-1, are also involved in the development of fever and the increase of algesthesia. Phagocytosis is more effective when the surfaces of the pathogens are complexed with antibodies, which are generated at a later stage of infection. It is part of the antibody-dependent, cellmediated cytotoxicity (ADCC). If neutrophils are not activated during the first 6 h after their emergence, i.e. if they not were confronted with infectious and/or inflammatory reactions, apoptosis will naturally be induced in them; dead granulocytes are then degraded in the liver by the macrophages that reside in this organ.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Granulocytes"}, {"text": "Eosinophils and basophils represent only about 2-5 and 0.2 % of white blood cells, respectively. Mast cells are tissue cells of mucous membranes and connective tissues. Their function is very similar to that of basophils. The main function of eosinophils is defence against large extracellular parasites, which cannot be phagocytosed owing to their size, such as worms (helminths). Eosinophils are attracted by chemotactic substances, attach to the parasites and pour out the content of their granules to the surrounding region, i.e. enzymes, oxygen radicals and cytotoxic proteins such as major basic protein (MBP); MBP is a group of small, arginine-rich proteins that are toxic to helminths, but also to mammalian cells, especially the cells of the bronchial epithelium. Eosinophils are also capable of phagocytosing small pathogens or IgE-containing immune complexes. Basophils and mast cells are involved in the development of allergic immune reactions, as they have IgE receptors on their surface and release histamine, heparin, proteases and leukotrienes upon attachment of IgE-containing antigen-antibody complexes. Histamines are also released upon contact of mast cells with MBP of eosinophils, which respond in turn with the release of histaminase and arylsulphatase, thus counteracting the histamine release. Disturbances in these processes can lead to allergic reactions.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Granulocytes"}, {"text": "Monocytes and macrophages belong, along with granulocytes and dendritic cells, to the mononuclear phagocytes, which are the most important cells of the innate immune system. Approximately 2-8 % of blood cells are monocytes. They are large, contain many lysosomes in their cytoplasm and have a well-pronounced Golgi apparatus. Both MHC class I and MHC class II proteins are anchored in their cell membrane. Monocytes originate from myeloid stem cells in the bone marrow, which initially develop to monoblasts under the influence of growth factors such as granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor and monocyte colonystimulating factor. Monoblasts further differentiate into monocytes, which leave the bone marrow and circulate for 20-30 h in the blood before they migrate as macrophages into different tissue and organ systems. Similar to neutrophils, macrophages also follow the paths that are mediated by adhesion molecules and chemokines, leave the bloodstream and arrive early at the infection site. They can ingest and digest foreign material by phagocytosis, i.e. pathogens or protein components derived from them. During this process, peptides are formed from digested proteins. These peptides interact with MHC class II proteins, and are finally presented on the cell surface of monocytes and macrophages. In this way, they become antigen-presenting cells that activate the specific immune system, namely the T H lymphocytes (Sect. 7.2.1). Furthermore, activated macrophages produce specific surface proteins such as CD14, CD16 and CD86 (CD stands for cluster of differentiation), and TLR2 and TLR4. Like TLR2 and TLR4, CD14 interacts with lipopolysaccharide (endotoxin)-negative bacteria. If these receptors come in contact with lipopolysaccharides, they stimulate macrophages to phagocytose foreign material and to release inflammatory mediators such as TNF-a, IL-1b and IL-6.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Monocytes and Macrophages"}, {"text": "Natural killer cells (NK cells) originate from precursor cells in the bone marrow. Unlike T lymphocytes, NK cells remain in the peripheral lymphoid tissues, where they develop into large, granular lymphocytes, which possess characteristic surface markers. One of their principal functions is the clearance of virus-infected cells and tumour cells. NK cells induce apoptosis preferentially in cells that exhibit very low levels of MHC molecules on their surface. This mode of recognition and elimination of virus-infected and transformed cells is of crucial importance, as they often reduce the number of MHC proteins on their surfaces in order to escape the MHCdependent specific immune responses. Fundamentally, NK cells are programmed to destroy all nucleated cells. However, MHC class I molecules on the cell surface inhibit this activity; hence, NK cells selectively induce apoptosis in those cells that do not exhibit MHC class I expression. Therefore, NK cells have killer cell immunoglobulin-like receptors (KIR) on their surface, which recognize and bind to MHC molecules. The KIR-MHC interaction leads to an inhibitory signal that suppresses the killer activity of NK cells. If this interaction is absent, then killing activatory receptors, which are also anchored in the cell membrane of NK cells, release toxic messengers which induce apoptosis in cells with poor expression of MHC molecules. Unlike granulocytes and macrophages, NK cells are always functionally active; thus, they do not need to be converted into an activated state by binding of specific cytokines. However, their activity can be enhanced by IL-12 or IFN-a and IFN-b, which are secreted, for example, by activated dendritic cells, monocytes and macrophages. NK cells produce large amounts of IFN-g and other cytokines (IL-1, TNF-a), which leads to further immunological activation steps (\u25b6 Chap. 8). Therefore, NK cells have, in addition to their cytotoxic effect, also an immunoregulatory importance.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Natural Killer Cells"}, {"text": "Toll-like receptors (TLRs) are members of a family of proteins that belong to the non-specific, innate immune system. TLRs are found in all vertebrates, including fish and reptiles. Their name is derived from the Toll gene, which was discovered in Drosophila melanogaster. It displays homology to the gene that encodes the IL-1 receptor. This suggests that the TLRs are members of an evolutionarily very old system. More than ten different TLRs have been discovered in most animal species, including humans, some of which exist only in certain species, such as in mice, but not in humans. TLRs are produced especially in dendritic cells, monocytes and macrophages, and belong to the group of pattern-recognition receptors. They are anchored in the cytoplasmic membrane (TLR1, TLR2, TLR4, TLR5, TLR6, TLR11) or in the endosomal membrane (TLR3, TLR7, TLR8, TLR9) and serve to detect pathogen-associated molecular patterns. These are structures that exist only on or in pathogens (viruses, bacteria, fungi). Therefore, TLRs endow the innate immune system with the ability to distinguish between \"self\" and \"nonself\". TLR1 interacts specifically with peptidoglycan components of Gram-positive bacteria, whereas TLR4 binds to lipopolysaccharides of gram-negative bacteria and TLR5 recognizes flagellin, a protein of bacterial flagella (Table 7 .1). The specific recognition of viral pathogen structures is performed mainly by TLR3, TLR7, TLR8 and TLR9, which are anchored in the endosomal membrane: TLR3 binds double-stranded RNA, TLR7 and TLR8 interact with single-stranded RNA and TLR9 binds to unmethylated CpG motifs in single-stranded and double-stranded DNA. Double-stranded RNAs are characteristic molecules that occur as genome components or intermediates of genome replication of RNA viruses; they do not exist in uninfected cells. The same applies to single-stranded DNA or unmethylated CpG motifs. These virus-specific components make contact with TLRs after they have been phagocytosed by dendritic cells, and are present in endosomes ( Fig. 7.1 ). Intracellular signalling cascades are induced after interaction of various TLRs with different pathogen-specific ligand structures by means of their leucine-rich domains, which are located extracellularly or in the endosomal lumen. Some TLRs can also form heterodimeric complexes, the ligand-binding properties of which are then modified or can overlap. As a result of ligand binding, Toll/IL-1 receptor (TIR) domain proteins, such as myeloid differentiation primary response gene 88 (MyD88) and similar proteins that act as adapters, can attach to the conserved TIR domains of different TLRs, which are oriented to the cytoplasm. This multistage process that involves IL-1 receptor associated kinases leads to the activation of members of the Ikb kinase (IKK) family, which phosphorylate Ikb, the inhibitor of nuclear factor kB (NFkB). As a consequence, the transcriptional factor NFkB can enter the nucleus and induce the expression of various proinflammatory cytokines and adhesion proteins. Some members of the IKK family phosphorylate interferon regulatory factors 3 and 7, which thus exert their activity as transactive proteins inducing the expression of IFN-a and IFN-b. Alternatively, the signal translation can also be MyD88-independent by addition of (TIR-domain-containing adapter-inducing IFN-\u00df (TRIF) to the TIR domains of TLRs involving the participation of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase.

Inflammation is a consequence of infection, and is causally connected with the processes that are induced by the non-specific immune response. Complement is activated by two different pathways: the so-called classical pathway and the alternative activation pathway. However, both lead to the same mechanism, the lysis of virus-infected cells, bacteria, parasites or tumour cells. The classical pathway is induced by antigen-antibody complexes. By contrast, the alternative pathway is activated independently of the presence of immunoglobulins. The complement system connects the specific and the non-specific part of the immune system, but it is also a link between the cellular and the humoral branch \u00e4 Fig. 7 .1 (continued) (MyD88) and TIR-domain-containing adapter-inducing interferon-\u00df (TRIF), characterized by death domains (DD).

Both complement activation pathways are based on several factors, which activate each other in a cascade-like process. The central reaction in which the two pathways converge is the proteolytic cleavage of complement component C3 into C3a and C3b by C3 convertase. In the alternative pathway, this transformation is induced spontaneously by certain sugar structures on the surface of bacteria, viruses, fungi and protozoa as well as tumour and virusinfected cells. In the classical pathway, it is indirectly triggered by antibodies bound to the surfaces of the respective pathogens or cells. The three subcomponents C1q, C1r and C1s attach to the Fc region of immunoglobulins to form the active unit ( Fig. 7.2) . This acts as a protease and processes component C4 and then component C2, whereupon the cleavage products C4b and C2a bind to the membrane surface of the target structure, i.e. the infected or transformed cell, the virus or bacterium, the fungus or protozoan. They form as a complex the above-mentioned C3 convertase of the classical pathway. During cleavage of C3, the conformation of the C3b subunit is modified in such a way that a reactive thioester bond is exposed. It reacts with functional side groups of amino acids, which are accessible on the surface of pathogens, cells or antigen-antibody complexes. As a result, the C3b subunit is covalently bound. The C3b subunit marks the structures as foreign, thus giving rise to a signal that induces phagocytosis by granulocytes, macrophages and monocytes.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [{"start": 781, "end": 787, "text": "Fig. 7", "ref_id": "FIGREF1"}, {"start": 2301, "end": 2310, "text": "Fig. 7.2)", "ref_id": "FIGREF1"}], "section": "The Complement System"}, {"text": "Binding of the C3b component to target structures on membranes concomitantly activates the lytic pathway of the complement system.

The specific recognition of altered cells occurs via T-cell receptor, a protein complex that is anchored in the plasma membrane of T lymphocytes. It is a heterodimer composed of an a and a b chain in about 95 % of T lymphocytes. Cells with gd T-cell receptors are rarely found; these consist of heterodimers of a g chain and a d chain on the cell surface. A large proportion of them carry neither CD4 nor CD8 receptors. The function of gd T cells has not been definitively resolved; they probably have regulatory functions and are involved in the suppression of the cellular immune response after an infection.

The variable domains are responsible for the specificity of the different T lymphocytes. Using them, they recognize foreign structures on the surface of their target cells.

This is usually mediated by the interaction of B7 proteins (B7.1 and B7.2) or CD40 proteins on antigen-presenting cells with their ligands, CD28 (cytotoxic T lymphocyte antigen 4) or CD40 on T cells. This co-stimulatory interaction is a prerequisite for IL-2-mediated proliferation of T lymphocytes. If these co-stimulatory signals fail to occur or are repressed by certain virus-specific factors, T cells can become anergic, i.e. functionally inoperative or unresponsive, or eventually die by induction of apoptosis. CD4 + T cells with high CD25 expression have been identified as important regulatory T cells, which decisively determine the immune response to self-antigens, and thus to self-tolerance and autoimmunity. 7.2.1.1 Cytotoxic T Cells CD8 + cytotoxic T lymphocytes recognize virus-infected cells, lyse them and thus contribute decisively to restricting the infection in the body. By the T-cell receptor complex and the CD8 receptor, these cells bind to MHC class I proteins, which present peptide fragments of viral proteins as foreign components. MHC class I proteins or antigens are present on all cells of an organism, with the exception of brain cells (\u25b6 Sect. 4.1.2). These proteins are heterodimers composed of a membrane-anchored a chain and a b 2 -microglobulin subunit (Fig. 7.3a) . The surface-exposed moiety of the a chain is divided into three domains, the a 1 and a 2 domains are folded in such a way that an antiparallel b-sheet floor is formed, on which two a-helices are supported. The structure resembles a groove or cavity in which the \u00df-sheet forms the floor, and the a-helices shape the brims that line the trench (Fig. 7.4) . Peptides with a length of approximately nine amino acids can be accommodated in this cavity. They are bound by a combination of hydrophobic and ionic interactions. These peptides are fragments of viral proteins that are recognized as foreign by the T-cell receptor of cytotoxic T cells, which then binds to them. If the cell is not infected, the hole is occupied by peptides originating from the cell itself. These are not recognized as foreign because cytotoxic T cells with such specificities are retained in the thymus and eliminated during T-cell maturation. Loading of MHC class I proteins with peptides occurs in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). This requires an active synthesis of viral proteins, a situation that exists only in infected cells, in which the viral genes are expressed and translated into proteins during viral replication (Fig. 7.5a) . After synthesis, a small proportion of them are delivered to the proteasome complex in the cytosol and are degraded. The resulting peptides are transported into the ER lumen by a peptide transporter cytotoxic T lymphocytes. The complex of MHC class I antigen and b 2 -microglobulin contains a peptide (red) in its antigen-binding cavity; this is derived from (transport-associated protein) that is integrated in the ER membrane. There, the peptides are accommodated into the cavity of MHC class I molecules, which are synthesized in the ER as membrane-anchored proteins. During this process, the moiety that protrudes into the lumen is later exposed at the cell surface; before the formation of stable complexes with b 2 -microglobulin and the peptide, the MHC a chain is bound to calnexin, an ER-membrane-associated protein that acts as a chaperone preventing the MHC amino acid chain from prematurely adopting its final folded state. The finally formed complex of peptide, a chain and b 2 -microglobulin is transported through the Golgi vesicles and the trans-Golgi network to the cell surface. It is anchored in the membrane, where it can be recognized by the T-cell receptors of CD8 + T lymphocytes. Then, T lymphocytes release cytotoxic factors (granzymes), radicals and perforins. The latter oligomerize under the influence of Ca 2+ ions, and are embedded in the membrane of the cell that was recognized as foreign, they intersperse it with pores, leading to cell lysis. A prerequisite for this process is that the corresponding T lymphocytes have been stimulated by cytokines such as IL-2 and IFN-g, which are secreted by T H cells. Additionally, cytokines such as IL-1, TNF and IFN-a, which are released from the cells of the innate immune system, e.g. by activated macrophages, increase the activity of cytotoxic T lymphocytes.

B cells originate from bone marrow pluripotent stem cells, which are the progenitors of all haematopoietic cells, and develop into precursor B cells by the influence of cytokines (IL-3). IL-4, IL-5 und IL-6 are necessary for further differentiation into pre-B cells. During this process, somatic recombinations occur at the DNA level, and lead to rearrangements of the variable regions of immunoglobulin genes. Initially, the D and J segments of heavy chains are mutually combined. Subsequently, one of more than 100 V segments is randomly added in front, so that a defined arrangement of VDJ regions is present in the pre-B cell. These are joined to the constant regions of the m chain by splicing. Subsequently, the V and J segments of the light a and k chains are rearranged and linked with the C regions by splicing during transcription. The corresponding protein chains are synthesized, and are transported to the cell surface. In this phase, pre-B cells have membrane-bound IgM molecules on their surfaces and secrete small amounts of IgM molecules with the corresponding specificities. The many millions of possible combinations of the VDJ regions of heavy chains, or the VJ segments of light chains, give rise to the huge antibody diversity, which ensures that virtually for every potential antigen, there is a specific IgM molecule. They are continuously present in low concentrations in the relevant cells as well as in the peripheral blood, and can neutralize pathogens.

These processes occur after birth, except for transplacentally transmitted viruses. If the embryo is infected during gestation, it is able to develop its own IgM and IgG antibodies only from the 22nd week of pregnancy. In humans, newborns receive a first specific protection by maternal antibodies (maternal immunity), which reach the bloodstream of the child during pregnancy as well as via breastfeeding, and assume explicit protective functions (maternal passive immunity) for about 6 months; thereafter, they are gradually degraded.

In the other case, a tolerance is established. Normally, during embryogenesis and later also in the thymus, T cells with receptors are selected and retained, and these recognize the body's own structures. They do not reach the peripheral blood, but they perish through apoptosis, i.e. by induction of programmed cell death. This clonal selection ensures that no T H cells and cytotoxic T lymphocytes with self-specificities are present in the organism. Inasmuch as the antibody production is dependent on the help of T cells, immunoglobulins with corresponding self-recognition should not be present. Viral infections occasionally trigger autoimmune reactions. Some viruses encode proteins that resemble cellular polypeptides, but are not identical with them. This is the case, among others, in measles virus, which codes for a protein with similarity to the basic myelin of the brain, in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), which possesses several protein segments with homology to various cell components, and in Epstein-Barr virus (\u25b6 Sects. 15.3, \u25b6 18.1, and \u25b6 19.5) .

Many B and T lymphocytes are stimulated regardless of the antigen specificity. In many patients with an acute Epstein-Barr virus infection, immune responses against various endogenous structures are found; the increased activation rate is manifested as lymph node swelling and lymphadenopathy. The organism reacts to viral infections with the production of IFN-a, IFN-b and IFN-g. These interferons induce, among other things, an increased expression of MHC class I and MHC class II proteins on the surface of uninfected cells. This MHC overexpression can lead to immunological side effects, and the corresponding cells can be attacked by T lymphocytes. In the case of Epstein-Barr virus infections, this leads to mononucleosis. In this case, the non-specific proliferation can lead to monoclonal or polyclonal malignant cells and Burkitt's lymphoma by additional, long-lasting stimulatory factors (such as malaria, chromosomal translocations). Even the effect of superantigens leads to immunological attack on the body's own cells.

In this way, both cell types are brought into contact with each other in an antigen-independent manner.

However, particularly herpesviruses use the synthesis of chemokine analogues to block the corresponding receptors, which represents a frequently used viral strategy to suppress the immune response.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "7.4"}], "bib_entries": {"BIBREF0": {"ref_id": "b0", "title": "Structure of the human class I histocompatibility antigen, HLA-A2", "authors": [{"first": "P", "middle": ["J"], "last": "Bjorkman", "suffix": ""}], "year": 1987, "venue": "Nature", "volume": "329", "issn": "", "pages": "506--512", "other_ids": {}}, "BIBREF1": {"ref_id": "b1", "title": "Viral mechanisms of immune evasion", "authors": [{"first": "A", "middle": ["K"], "last": "Further Reading Abbas", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "A", "middle": ["H"], "last": "Lichtman", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "J", "middle": ["S"], "last": "Pober", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "", "middle": [], "last": "Immunologie", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "Bern", "middle": [], "last": "Huber", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "A", "middle": [], "last": "Alcami", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "U", "middle": ["H"], "last": "Koszinowski", "suffix": ""}], "year": 1996, "venue": "Immunol Today", "volume": "21", "issn": "", "pages": "447--455", "other_ids": {}}, "BIBREF2": {"ref_id": "b2", "title": "The role of viral nucleic acid recognition in dendritic cells for innate and adaptive antiviral immunity", "authors": [{"first": "J", "middle": [], "last": "Brostoff", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "G", "middle": ["K"], "last": "Scadding", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "D", "middle": [], "last": "Male", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "Roitt", "middle": [], "last": "Im ; Klinische Immunologie", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "Weinheim", "middle": [], "last": "Vch", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "K", "middle": [], "last": "Eisen\u20ac Acher", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "C", "middle": [], "last": "Steinberg", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "W", "middle": [], "last": "Reindl", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "A", "middle": [], "last": "Krug", "suffix": ""}], "year": 1993, "venue": "Immunobiol", "volume": "212", "issn": "", "pages": "701--714", "other_ids": {}}, "BIBREF3": {"ref_id": "b3", "title": "Understanding the immune system", "authors": [{"first": "Kd ;", "middle": [], "last": "Elgert", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "P", "middle": [], "last": "Travers", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "M", "middle": [], "last": "Walport", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "M", "middle": [], "last": "Shlomchik", "suffix": ""}], "year": 1996, "venue": "Immunology of infectious diseases", "volume": "", "issn": "", "pages": "", "other_ids": {}}, "BIBREF4": {"ref_id": "b4", "title": "Complement: clinical aspects and relevance to disease", "authors": [{"first": "K", "middle": ["O"], "last": "Morgan", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "P", "middle": ["B"], "last": "Morgan", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "P ;", "middle": [], "last": "Morgan", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "", "middle": [], "last": "Academic", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "T", "middle": [], "last": "London M\u20ac Uller", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "S", "middle": [], "last": "Hamm", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "S", "middle": [], "last": "Bauer", "suffix": ""}], "year": 1990, "venue": "Handb Exp Pharmacol", "volume": "183", "issn": "", "pages": "51--70", "other_ids": {}}, "BIBREF5": {"ref_id": "b5", "title": "Regulatory T cells in virus infections", "authors": [{"first": "We ; Philadelphia", "middle": [], "last": "Paul", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "I", "middle": ["M"], "last": "Roitt", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "J", "middle": [], "last": "Brostoff", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "D", "middle": ["K"], "last": "Male", "suffix": ""}], "year": 1995, "venue": "Immunol Rev", "volume": "212", "issn": "", "pages": "272--286", "other_ids": {}}, "BIBREF6": {"ref_id": "b6", "title": "Immunologic self-tolerance maintained by activated T cells expressing IL-2 receptor alpha-chains (CD25)", "authors": [{"first": "S", "middle": [], "last": "Sakaguchi", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "N", "middle": [], "last": "Sakaguchi", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "M", "middle": [], "last": "Asano", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "M", "middle": [], "last": "Itoh", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "M", "middle": [], "last": "Toda", "suffix": ""}], "year": 1995, "venue": "J Immunol", "volume": "155", "issn": "", "pages": "1151--1164", "other_ids": {}}, "BIBREF7": {"ref_id": "b7", "title": "Recognition of viruses by innate immunity", "authors": [{"first": "O", "middle": [], "last": "Takeuchi", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "S", "middle": [], "last": "Akira", "suffix": ""}], "year": 2007, "venue": "Immunol Rev", "volume": "220", "issn": "", "pages": "214--224", "other_ids": {}}, "BIBREF8": {"ref_id": "b8", "title": "Veterinary immunology: an introduction, 8th edn.

Antibodies can specifically bind to these proteins. Two adjacent IgG antibodies or one bound IgM antibody can induce attachment of the complement components C1q, C1r and C1s to C1. C1 is a protease that cleaves component C4 into C4a and C4b as well as component C2 into C2a and C2b. C4b and C2a form a complex which attaches to the cytoplasmic membrane and, in turn, cleaves component C3. C3b is covalently bound to the structures of the cell surface. The complex of C4b, C2a and C3b processes component C5 into C5a and C5b. The latter, in turn, interact with the cell surface, causing the attachment of the membrane attack complex composed of C6, C7, C8 and C9, which induces the destruction of infected cells by pore formation.
