In the COVID-19 context, as neurologists dedicated to pwMS, we found the management of immunocompromised patients particularly challenging. As a possible solution, we explored the use of a remote triage system to identify patients at risk for COVID-19. Based on the experience by colleagues at the Mount Sinai Hospital in New York, which leverages its existing digital tools to survey immunosuppressed patients with inflammatory bowel disease (Atreja A., personal communication), we developed a triage tool that can be sent to pwMS (see Table 1). The digital triage can be easily setup using Google Forms (https://docs.google.com/forms/u/0/) which enables collection of responses almost in real time. The Google Forms platform may be used before checking for each specific country the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) compliance.",
