It begins with a procedure for obtaining whole mononuclear cells based on cell density (Ficoll\u2010Hypaque gradient separation; unit\nim0701) and continues with procedures to separate major cell populations (T cells, B cells, macrophages, and null cells) from mononuclear cells (units\nim0702\n&\nim0705\u2010im0707). In addition, techniques for isolating subpopulations of T cells and B cells by a variety of techniques are also presented, including complement\u2010mediated lysis to \u201ckill\u201d unwanted (contaminating) cells, panning procedures in which cells are selectively bound via antibody to a plastic surface, and a newly developed immunomagnetic procedure in which cells are bound to antibody\u2010coated magnetic beads that can be selectively removed on the basis of their behavior in a magnetic field (units\nim0703\n&\nim0704a). These general methods for isolating cells are complemented by methods for isolating human lymphoid cell populations from tonsillar tissues, which can also be applied to other solid lymphoid tissues such as the spleen and lymph nodes, presented in unit\nim0708. unit\nim0704b describes two widely used methods to isolate (FACS) or to enrich (magnetic beads) human CD4+CD25+ regulatory T cells from blood. The unit also includes an in vitro coculture assay to measure the anergic and suppressive features of human CD4+CD25+ regulatory T cells. In addition, methods for accessing and purifying in situ lymphocyte populations are presented in the fourth section of the chapter (unit\nim0730), which includes protocols for obtaining large numbers of purified, viable mononuclear cells from intestinal tissues.",

            "text": "In general, separation techniques to obtain lymphocyte subpopulations depend on antibodies to surface antigens that distinguish one subpopulation from another. Several points need to be considered in utilizing these techniques. First, subpopulations defined by a specific antibody may not encompass cells with a single function, and a single function may be a property of several different cell types. For example, the CD4 surface antigen does not identify a population of cells that exclusively expresses \u201chelper\u201d function, and the CD8 surface antigen does not mark a population of cells that exclusively expresses suppressor/cytokine function; on the contrary, these cell populations can act as either helper or suppressor/cytokine cells under certain circumstances. Another example concerns the difficulty of defining cells with natural killer (NK) and lymphokine\u2010activated killer (LAK) cell functions with a single surface marker; if one isolates NK/LAK cells by removal of T cells (unit\nim0707), one also removes a small, but definite, subpopulation of cells with NK/LAK activity that bear T cell markers (i.e., CD3, CD8). The basis of these discrepancies is that, in reality, cell function is the result of a complex set of cell characteristics affected not only by the cell's capacity to produce lymphokines and other substances, but also by the nature of the cell\u2010to\u2010cell interactions permitted by the cell's array of antigen\u2010specific and antigen\u2010nonspecific cell\u2010surface receptors. Despite these difficulties, this chapter presents methods for defining discrete subpopulations of cells whenever possible. Thus in unit\nim0734, protocols are described that allow for the separation of NK cells from peripheral blood based upon cell\u2010surface expression of CD56 (CD56bright and CD56dim) and upon the amount of NK function.",

            "text": "Second, when positive selection of cells is used, one may cause inadvertent activation or differentiation of cells simply because cross\u2010linking of the surface antigens used for selection affects cell function. In this regard, even surface antigens generally considered to be incapable of transducing intracellular signals may do so under certain circumstances. For example, CD2, the sheep erythrocyte receptor, is in fact a protein through which the T cells can be activated under some conditions. The possibility that cell isolation may perturb cell function leads to the maxim that, whenever possible, cell isolation should be performed by negative selection. Third and finally, the expression of surface antigen being used to separate a cell population may be related to the activation state of the cell. In this regard, certain antigens may be expressed only when the cell is in a resting state and others only when the cell is in an activated state. Thus, cell separations based on surface antigens must be made with due regard for the activation state of the cells in the starting population.",

            "text": "One cell\u2010separation procedure not formally described here, but covered in Chapter 5, is positive and negative cell sorting with a flow cytometer. Although this method generally yields a cell population of higher purity than other techniques, the number of cells obtained is limited by the time necessary to perform cell sorting. Although cell separation methods (e.g., the use of immunomagnetic beads) are leading to cell purities that rival those achieved with sorting techniques while providing larger yields, these techniques may therefore be preferred, except when especially pure cell populations are necessary. The question of whether or not to use sorting to isolate a cell population frequently arises in relation to the isolation of purified human B cell populations. This is because B cells are present in peripheral blood in relatively low numbers and are difficult to separate from macrophages and null cells. Good purification can be achieved with positive cell sorting, using a cell population that is partially purified (lacking in T cells), and fluorescent antibodies to B cell\u2013surface markers that do not (usually) affect cell function. Alternatively, a multistep negative selection procedure is described in unit\nim0705.",

Polyclonal stimulants have been used more frequently in studies of human than animal immune function because humans cannot usually be immunized with powerful antigens (and adjuvants), and thus the antigen\u2010specific cell populations available from human tissues (i.e., peripheral blood) may be too small for adequate analysis. Methods of polyclonal stimulation of T cells presented here include techniques for the study of T cell proliferation with various mitogens (unit\nim0710), anti\u2010CD3 antibody (which activates the T cell via the T cell receptor complex), and biochemical stimulation with phorbol ester and a calcium ionophore (which activates the T cell via direct triggering of intracellular activation pathways; units\nim0710\n&\nim0711). These methods can be extended to measure T cell secretion of cytokine into the culture supernatant by one of the methods presented in Chapter 6. The current chapter, however, includes a unit that allows for ex vivo stimulation of whole blood to measure cytokine responses to such things as bacterial endotoxin (LPS), antigens, and allergens (unit\nim0718b).",

It should be noted that B cells can also be activated in a polyclonal fashion by first activating T cells with anti\u2010CD3, then mixing the activated T cells with B cells in the absence of a B cell stimulant. B cell activation/differentiation under these circumstances is due to polyclonal cellular interactions between T cells and B cells that in part involve stimulation of B cell via CD40 and OX40L. Under physiologic conditions, B cell development and differentiation are orchestrated by a variety of cell activation events. These occur both in the bone marrow (in the case of B cell precursors) and the periphery (e.g., in the case of germinal centers in lymphoid tissue). B cell development proceeds largely along a linear pathway. During this process, the developing cells take on characteristic immunophenotypic profiles that identify corresponding B cell subsets. unit\nim0735 provides a guide to the phenotypic evaluation of such developing B cells obtained from bone marrow, peripheral blood, and lymphoid tissue.",

            "text": "It is important to keep in mind that polyclonal stimulation of T cells and B cells is not necessarily equivalent to antigenic stimulation. Polyclonal stimulants, for instance, may activate intracellular pathways that lead to cellular requirements for cytokines/lymphokines distinct from requirements induced by antigenic stimulants. This is even true when anti\u2010CD3 or anti\u2010Ig are used as stimulants, since activation of T and B cells by antigen involves far more than simple cross\u2010linking of the antigen receptor. Thus, studies that rely only on the use of polyclonal stimulants must be interpreted with caution, and, in some instances, it is useful to verify results obtained with them using a bona fide antigen. For this purpose, the chapter contains procedures for assessing both T and B cell proliferation and function in antigen\u2010specific systems (units\nim0710, im0715, &\nim0717). In these procedures, the starting material is cells from individuals who have been recently immunized with the antigen to be used so that a sufficient number of antigen\u2010reactive cells are available. Finally, procedures for assessing responses to antigens by measurement of antibody synthesis in the serum following in vivo antigen challenge are also presented (unit\nim0716).",

These are both mediated by overlapping (if not identical) cell subpopulations and are both direct cytotoxicities that do not involve target\u2010cell recognition via the T cell receptor (and MHC restriction). However, they differ in that NK activity is found in fresh cell populations without addition of a stimulus, whereas LAK activity requires several days to develop in the presence of a lymphokine (IL\u20102, IL\u20104, and IL\u20107). In addition, NK and LAK cells differ in their capacity to lyse target cells; some targets are NK\u2010resistant and LAK\u2010sensitive. As alluded to earlier, the cells mediating NK and LAK cytotoxicity are phenotypically different, so total NK/LAK cytotoxic function is best assessed using whole or macrophage\u2010depleted mononuclear cell populations (unit\nim0707). To study NK/LAK activity using a more defined cell population, one can utilize positively selected cell populations obtained by immunomagnetic bead selection employing a combination of antibodies recognizing the spectrum of NK/LAK cells, such as anti\u2010CD16 plus anti\u2010CD56 (see appendix\nima04). unit\nim0739 describes methods to measure NK cell cytotoxicity, degranulation, and cytokine production (intracellular FACS analysis of IFN\u03b3) in whole blood samples.

Attention in recent years has focused on possible infection with the AIDS (HIV\u20101) virus. It should be noted, however, that human materials may harbor other dangerous pathogens, including hepatitis B virus (HBV), cytomegalovirus, EBV, SARS virus, and a host of bacterial pathogens.",

            "text": "The basic framework for safety in immunologic research is encompassed in the concept of the biosafety level. This defines a set of procedures mandated by the type of microorganism being handled, or likely to be handled, as well as the number of such organisms involved and the nature of the manipulations to be carried out. Biosafety level 1 (BL\u20101), the lowest level, applies to ubiquitous microorganisms found in the general environment and requires that standard microbiological practices be followed\u2014including the use of mechanical pipetting devices, daily decontamination of work surfaces, prohibition of eating, smoking, and application of cosmetics in the laboratory area, use of laboratory coats, and appropriate hand washing. Biosafety level 2 (BL\u20102) applies to organisms capable of producing disease of moderate severity in normal healthy individuals. It assumes all the features of BL\u20101 and, in addition, applies more stringent conditions for laboratory cleaning, use of containment equipment (e.g., biosafety cabinets)\u2014particularly if aerosols will be generated\u2014and autoclaving of laboratory wastes. Biosafety level 3 (BL\u20103) applies to possible exposure to microorganisms capable of causing serious illness. This level differs from the BL\u20102 level in that it mandates for a double\u2010door entry system into a sealed \u201cinner\u201d laboratory having a unidirectional airflow. At this biosafety level, tissue is manipulated only within biosafety cabinets, centrifugation of specimens is accomplished with sealed safety cups, and special clothing and gloves are routinely worn. Finally, BL\u20104 applies to laboratory work with pathogens that pose a life\u2010threatening risk to laboratory workers when even \u201ccasual\u201d contact with tissue occurs. The safety practices employed at this level are an intensification of those at the BL\u20103 level and include extensive clothing changes before entering the work area, decontamination of waste, strict training of all laboratory personnel, and the use of class II biosafety cabinets (which provide for physical isolation of specimens) or of lower\u2010class cabinets in association with one\u2010piece positive\u2010pressure personnel suits ventilated by a life\u2010support system.",

            "text": "Most laboratory work with materials containing blood\u2010borne pathogens can be safely accomplished with BL\u20102 level procedures, except when unusually large numbers of organisms must be handled or when aerosols will be generated. BL\u20103, on the other hand, is reserved for the more dangerous infectious agents and is the preferred level for research involving HIV\u20101. Both the BL\u20102 and BL\u20103 levels require the presence of a laboratory leader that is fully versed in safety practices, and, in addition, requires provision of safety training programs for workers and the establishment of laboratory\u2010specific safety manuals. Particular attention must be given to the possibility of laboratory accidents that will result in infection of a laboratory worker (or waste handler) and the institution of strict procedures that prevent such accidents. Obvious examples here are the proscription of mouth pipetting and the use of instruments that cause skin breaks without adequate glove protection. It is essential that all persons working in a laboratory in which human tissues are being processed be fully aware of the potential for exposure to various pathogens present in the tissue. When a break in safety procedure and undue exposure does occur, it is the responsibility of everyone concerned to investigate the incident and to bring the exposed individuals to immediate medical attention.",
