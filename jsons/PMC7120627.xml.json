It is also known as highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) due to its serious symptoms and high mortality. The 1 case of human infected H5N1 avian influenza, a 3-year-old child, was reported in Hong Kong on May 5, 1997. The child was hospitalized due to cold and fever but incurable by therapies, and death occurred due to Reye syndrome and multiple organs failure 10 days after the onset. On May 9, 1997, a strain of H5N1 AIV, nominated as A/Hongkong/157/97, was isolated from his tracheal secretion in National Central Laboratory of Influenza in Rotterdam, Holland and Center for Disease Control, the United States. Therefore, the child was etiologically diagnosed with human infected H5N1 avian influenza. And the child was the first case of human infected highly pathogenic avian influenza (H5N1). Within the following 6 months, 17 other cases were reported, and the patients aged 1\u201360 years, with the same H5N1 virus strain isolated from their respiratory secretions. In December, 1997, AIV H5N1 was isolated in samples collected from a market selling alive poultry. By killing sick poultry in a large-scale, human infection was then rapidly controlled. In the year of 1997, a total of 18 cases human infected H5N1 avian influenza were reported, with 5 cases of death.",

At the peak of their progression, most of lung fields in both lungs are involved, with large flakes of cloudy dense mass like opacity or even white-lung sign.Rapid changes of the lesionRadiologically, the lesions are demonstrated with rapid changes. A lesion that is initially found in one lung field may rapidly develop to involve the upper, middle and lower lung fields within 24\u201348 h, radiologically demonstrated as involvement of the whole lung lobe.Concurrently involved pulmonary parenchyma and interstitiumDue to necrosis and shedding of pulmonary alveoli, the pulmonary alveoli contain less gas but are filled with exudates such as various serous fluids, fibrin, erythrocytes, and neutrophilic granulocytes. In addition, hyaline membrane obviously forms in the alveolar space. Therefore, the lesions of human infected H5N1 avian influenza are radiologically demonstrated as alveolar exudates and lung consolidation, with the involved exudative lesions overlapping with pulmonary interstitium. After the exudative lesions are absorbed, grid like, flakes, strips and patches of opacity is shown, which resemble to the radiological signs of viral pneumonia.Slow absorption of the lesionThe lesions are slowly absorbed. After the invasive assisting mechanical ventilation is retrieved with subsequent normal body temperature, breathing rate and WBC count, the both lungs are still radiologically demonstrated with strips, flakes, grid like, and patches of consolidation opacity, indicating inconsistency between chest radiology and clinical symptoms due to long-term progression of the lesions. That is to say, the absorption of lesions in lung lags behind clinical manifestations. In adult patients, the pleura is involved in different degrees, with a small quantity of pleural effusion isolateral to the primary lesion as well as bilateral pleural thickening and adhesion. During the absorption stage, multiple lesions of lobular paraseptal emphysema are revealed, with no obvious signs of hilar and mediastinal lymphadenectasis.\n",

On d 8 after onset, the first chest CT scan demonstrated large consolidation opacity with high density in the apico-posterior and anterior segments of the left lung and in the left lower lung lobe, with air bronchogram inside. The anterior segment of the right upper lung was shown with ground glass opacity. All the findings indicated that ground glass opacity and large consolidation opacity are early signs of human infected avian influenza by chest radiology.The invasion of human lung tissues by avian influenza virus H5N1 is extensive, demonstrated as diffuse and exudates lesions in both lungs with multiple segments and lobes involved. At the peak of its progression, most of the lung fields in both lungs is involved, demonstrated as large cloudy dense mass like opacity and even white-lung sign.Radiologically, the lesions change rapidly.

In this cases, the patient showed the sign of ARDS on d 9 after onset. After invasive mechanical positive pressure ventilation and anti-anoxia therapy were administered, his condition was improved. And multiple organs dysfunction syndrome (MODS) was controlled.Pulmonary secondary infectionCommon pulmonary secondary infections include pseudomonas aeruginosa infection, mycotic infection and other bacterial infections. Since d 10 after onset, the patient was detected for several times with growth of pseudomonas aeruginosa in his phlegm specimens. Particularly on d 20 after onset, his WBC count obviously increased and chest X-ray demonstrated patches uneven opacity in the left lower lung. After polymyxin B and other medications were administered, his pulmonary secondary infection was controlled.Pulmonary fibrosisAlthough his condition was stable with normal vital signs, on discharge his both lungs were shown with irregular grid like, fibrous strips and patches of opacity and accompanying local pleural thickening by thin layer CT scan. These findings indicated existence of pulmonary fibrosis, whose underlying mechanism may be hyperplasia of fibrous tissues and capillaries caused by fibrosis and organization of exudates as well as formation of microthrombosis in pulmonary capillaries based on formation of alveolar hyaline membrane and fibrin exudation. However, the hypothesis needs to be proved by sufficient evidence and the dynamic changes of pulmonary fibrosis still need to be further studied.Pleural effusionIn this case, the patient showed left pleural effusion in a small quantity on d 8 after onset by the first chest CT scan.

On d 7 after onset, Feb. 18, 2006, she was transferred to another hospital due to persistent fever, aggravated cough with more phlegm, chest distress and difficulty breathing. By inquiries of her epidemiological history, she reported a definitive history of contact to sick/dead chicken in her home 7 days prior to the onset, Feb. 4, 2006. By routine blood test, WBC count 3.30 \u00d7 109/L, N 0.83, L 0.15 and PLT 56 \u00d7 109/L. Blood biochemistry showed AST 90U/L, CK 74U/L, and LDH 537U/L. By blood gas analysis, pH 7.426, PaO2 25.1 mmHg, PaCO2 51 mmHg, HCO3 19.4 mmol/, and SO2% 92 %. Respiratory secretions examination on d 9 after onset (specimens collected 1 day ago), Feb. 20, 2006, the virus nucleic acid positive for H5N1 avian influenza virus. By reexamination by national parallel laboratory, the finding was still positive, with H5N1 avian influenza virus isolation positive.",
