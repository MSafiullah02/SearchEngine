            "text": "The cystatin (Csn) superfamily of proteins are natural cysteine proteinase (CysP) inhibitors; however, their rate of inhibition of known CysP varies greatly among the different members. These variations may allow for a more vast defense mechanism against diseases of bacterial and/or viral origin. Several Csns have been shown to possess viral inhibitory properties. These include chicken egg white (CEW) Csn and oryzacystatin (rice Csn) and the ability to inhibit poliovirus replication. 1, 2 Oryzacystatin has also been shown to inhibit herpes simplex virus Type 1 (HSV\u20101) in vitro and in vivo. 3 Human cystatin C (CsnC) has the ability to inhibit HSV\u20101 and coronavirus replication. 4, 5 Human whole saliva and salivary fractions containing CsnSN have been shown to inhibit HSV\u20101 replication. 6, 7 Thus we are interested in determining the mechanism of inhibition of HSV\u20101 by CsnC and CsnSN. We have shown that rCsnSN, and confirmed that rCsnC, reduce the viral yield of HSV\u20101 when these proteins are added exogenously to CV\u20101 cells at the start of HSV\u20101 infection. 8 It is thought that the Csns may enter the cells after the cell membranes become permeable as a result of the viral infection 4 and are thus able to inhibit viral and/or host cell CysP necessary for the viral replication. Poliovirus replication is inhibited by CEW Csn through a CysP necessary for polyprotein processing and essential for viral replication and propagation. 1 Also, a serine proteinase encoded by HSV\u20101 has been identified and found to be necessary for the packaging of the mature virions. 9 Therefore, it is plausible that CsnC and/or CsnSN inhibit HSV\u20101 replication through a CysP.",

Our hypothesis is supported by a recent study that showed that the introduction of the corn Csn gene into rice plants resulted in high levels of expression of the corn Csn mRNA and protein. The corn Csn produced in rice served as an effective inhibitor of insect pest gut CysP. 10 To evaluate our hypothesis, we are using transfection technology for establishing CV\u20101 cell lines that will continuously produce CsnSN and CsnC mRNA and protein, with a goal of using these cell lines for HSV\u20101 inhibition studies. These studies will allow us to better understand the mechanism of interaction and thereby inhibition of HSV\u20101 by Csns.",

The recombinant plasmids were transfected into COS\u20101 cells. Stable clones were selected with G418 and isolated onto 24\u2010well plates. Simultaneous to individual clone selection, we analyzed a heterogeneous population of cells for mRNA and protein production. The Northern blot analysis showed a very large increase in mRNA of both CsnC and CsnSN (refer to Fig. 1A), whereas the Western blot analysis was inconclusive (data not shown). Upon evaluation of individual clones (>20 for each of CsnC and SN), we found no increase in the Csn mRNA or protein production in any of the clones. These results indicate that even though the individual clones were antibiotic resistant, they were false positive.",

We examined both lipofectamine and calcium phosphate transfection methods, as well as CV\u20101 and NIH\u2010293 cells. We found that both CV\u20101 and NIH\u2010293 transfected best with lipofectamine and that the NIH\u2010293 cells have little or no endogenous CsnC (refer to Fig. 1B). As compared to CV\u20101 cells, NIH\u2010293 cells were less infectable by HSV\u20101; therefore, in subsequent transfections and HSV\u20101 infections we used CV\u20101 cells. We have successfully transiently transfected CV\u20101 cells with untargeted CsnC cDNA, as documented by an increase in CsnC protein production by Western blot analysis of total cell protein (as shown in Fig. 2A). However, transiently transfected CV\u20101 cells with untargeted CsnSN cDNA have shown no increase in CsnSN protein production (data not shown); the reason for this remains unclear. Further, we have successfully transiently transfected CV\u20101 cells with CsnC and CsnSN cDNA containing a nuclear retention signal (147 aa residues of GAL4\u2010encoding sequence 11 added to the 5\u2032 end of the Csns), as reflected by a production of GAL4/CsnSN and GAL4/CsnC proteins, shown in Figure 2B and C, respectively.

This is probably because in transient transfections, only a small fraction of the cells become transfected, and the level of transfection is not consistent between each transfection.

This may be due to a large incidence of false positives, or perhaps because it is not possible to produce stable cell lines expressing high levels of Csns (CysP inhibitors). In fact, it has been shown that it is very difficult to obtain transfected cells with expression levels of calpain (CysP) and/or its natural inhibitor, calpastatin, significantly different from that of control cells. Large deviations from the normal level seem to be lethal. 12 It is also documented that rice plants transfected with the rice Csn gene did not express high levels of rice Csn mRNA or protein (insufficient for the effective protection against insect pests). 13 On the other hand, the study by Irie et al.\n10 has shown that transfection of the rice plants with the corn Csn gene yielded transgenic rice plants with levels of corn Csn protein more than 20 times higher than that of the intrinsic oryzacystatin. More importantly the corn Csn protein effectively inhibited insect pest gut CysP. Therefore, we remain optimistic that we will be successful in establishing cell lines that will produce high levels of CsnSN and CsnC that can be used to determine the mechanism of HSV\u20101 inhibition by cystatins.",
