Because of lack of knowledge about the disease at the time, patients were kept in hospital until 3 weeks after the onset of illness. Other discharge criteria included being afebrile for at least 4 days, chest consolidation reduced by 25%, and no need for supplementary oxygen. Discharged patients were advised to stay home for 1 week and to wear a mask at home. Because coronavirus may be shed in feces, toilet hygiene was also emphasized.",

Of these patients, 277 had been discharged home for at least 1 week. We interviewed them by telephone to determine if any of their household members had been infected after their discharge. The majority of the discharged patients (88% [n = 244]) lived with family members. Among the 520 household members of these 244 patients, only 1 was admitted to hospital with SARS. This patient's mother had been discharged on March 28 and the patient had started to have a fever on March 29. This patient had mental retardation and required assistance for daily activities. His mother admitted that she did not always wear a mask at home while looking after the patient after her discharge.",

Nevertheless, these data suggest that with proper treatment and use of protective masks, the risk of transmission from recovered patients to close contacts is very low. The World Health Organization has recently adopted a less stringent discharge policy that does not require patients to be isolated for 21 days from illness onset (2). The safety of this policy requires further evaluation.",
