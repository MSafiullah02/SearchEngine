The uses can be quite varied but they all require some capability for symbolic manipulation. Otherwise, why bother with controlled representation when one could just store raw signals? At the simplest level, symbolic manipulation at least requires a set of symbols (often referred to as identifiers) that distinguish the various elements of data and knowledge. Human-understandable labels (often referred to as terms) for these elements are not always required,\n1 but they are usually deemed convenient, if for no other reason than the need to map human-collected data into symbols and to map symbols into human-usable results. Sets of these symbols and labels (or terms and identifiers) are usually referred to as controlled terminologies.",

The construction of a controlled terminology does not always guarantee that successful representation will occur; some approaches will predictably work better than others. Biomedical informatics researchers have been studying and describing these approaches for decades. One attempt to synthesize and summarize that body of work, written in the late 1990s, identified 12 desiderata that reflected the ideas of many researchers of the time [1].",

The term \u201cmeaning\u201d has several definitions (or meanings!), including \u201cthe thing one intends to convey especially by language\u201d [2]. How one conveys these \u201cthings\u201d may be accomplished by various methods, depending on what that thing is. For example, if the thing is a particular object in reality (say, a particular person or automobile), its meaning might be conveyed by a proper noun or some unique identifier (e.g., the person\u2019s name or the automobile\u2019s registration number). If the thing is a generalization of some particular set of things in reality (that is, a universal that has some extension, or set of instances in reality), its meaning might be conveyed by a general term for the things or by some set of characteristics that all these things have in common (e.g., \u201cperson\u201d or \u201cpassenger vehicle, self-propelled, four wheels \u2026\u201d\u2014of course, this raises the need to define these additional terms). Finally, if the thing is an idea, we might refer to it with some description of the idea or by describing the particular instances on which the idea is based.",

In fact, many patient records today do, to a limited extent, implicitly represent patient information as extensions in reality, as discussed below, through their data models. While a clinical record may appear to capture that, as Smith charges, a physician fits together a patient and a concept (e.g., a disease), the clinical record is usually capturing (with some unique identifier composed of time, patient, physician, and concept) that at some point in time, the physician is observing attributes of the patient that leads the physician to believe that the signs the patient is manifesting are evidence that the patient has some disease. Thus, while the concept may appear to be separate from the patient, there is a deeper connection that is implied by the design of the patient record [9].",

The terms in such terminologies arguably correspond to universals, since they have extensions in reality, in the form of actual instances of specimens collected from actual patients. When an actual specimen is collected from an actual patient, it is assigned a unique identifier (at New York Presbyterian Hospital, these are called \u201caccession numbers\u201d). Using such identifiers, it is possible to perform multiple measurements on the same specimen (to check for consistency), to perform different measurements on the same specimen (to correlate findings), and to report multiple results on the same specimen (such as preliminary and final results).

As a particular problem (or the understanding of the problem) evolves over time, new interpretations can be assigned without losing the reference to the original problem.

Thus, if we assume that recording what is on the side of the patient will involve instances of laboratory specimens collected from the patient, and that the laboratory information system would benefit from having some controlled set of well-defined terms for universals to process the actual specimens, we cannot escape the practical need to include terms for things that do not yet actually exist\u2014that is, terms that are, at least temporarily, purely conceptual.

To really know the patient\u2019s body temperature, we would need to know the kinetic energy of every one of the patient\u2019s molecules. Any measurement process that attempted to detect this would (according to Heisenberg) render the result moot by destroying the patient. Instead, we use a device that detects, imperfectly, the average kinetic energy of a small subset of the patient\u2019s molecules. From this, we make a guess at the patient\u2019s actual temperature, taking into account that the reliability of our estimate is further influenced by the orifice containing the aforementioned molecules. I submit, then, that when we record a patient\u2019s temperature, we can only do so through reference to concepts; we do not have the luxury of \u201creal\u201d universals. We might allow that since this is the best approximation we can make, that patient body temperature is, for all intents and purposes, a universal, or we can acknowledge that we use the instances of measurements to help us create a conceptual representation from which we can reason. The result\u2014what we think we are dealing with and what we do about it\u2014is the same. The advantages of an imperfect universal over an imperfect concept are not self-evident.",

Can we at least do away with these concepts and reason from first principles about our patients? This approach is appealing, until we consider that we don\u2019t have much of a clue about the first principles that relate disease processes to particular values of body temperature. Is a patient with a temperature of 39 \u00b0C twice as sick as a patient with a temperature of 38 \u00b0C, or only 2.6% sicker? Of course, neither is the case, but we have no algorithm nor body of experience with which to characterize patient states based on temperature. Instead, we mentally convert temperature measurements into conceptual representations of the patient\u2019s true body temperature (as above) and then further use concepts like \u201clow-grade fever\u201d to help us match patients tacitly to conceptual patterns that correspond to various disease states (such as mild upper respiratory tract infection\u2014a cold).",

While such characteristics were certainly true for each individual patient, we must also consider how clinicians dealt with this condition. Did they hold in their minds the unique identifiers of the individual cases or did they use some abstract representation, based on their understanding of the disease at the time?

            "text": "We therefore consider some desirable characteristics of controlled biomedical terminologies that address not the structural and content issues of the original Desiderata, but their purpose:(1) Terminologies should support capturing what is known about the patient. This is at the level of what is actually observed, not just how we interpret our observations or what we infer. For example, when recording the medication given to a patient, we should record the specific product\u2014\u201cAspergum,\u201d for example, when it is known. However, when such details are not know, we will need the terminology to provide us with a more general term\u2014\u201caspirin preparation,\u201d for example.(2) Terminologies should support retrieval. This has implications for the how the terminology is used at the time of data recording and at the time of querying. In both settings, we should strive to make the meanings of the terms universally understood; linguistic representation should support, rather than obfuscate, this understanding. For example, although \u201caspirin\u201d is often a shorthand form of the term \u201caspirin preparation,\u201d the terminology should make the distinction between the two terms clear to the person recording a patient\u2019s medications, such that someone later encountering the information in the patient\u2019s record will be able to determine the meaning intended by the recorder.(3) Terminologies should allow storage, retrieval, and transfer of information with as little information loss as possible. This has implications for how terminologies evolve over time, while the data they are used to record remain as frozen artifacts. Changes in terminologies should not hamper our understanding of what was stored on the side of the patient. For example, many medical products that contained phenylpropanolamine\u2014a drug that has been prohibited by the US Food and Drug Administration\u2014have continued to be manufactured with a substitute ingredient (pseudoephedrine). While the names of these medications have not changed, the identifiers used to refer to them must change, so that we can know, from a patient\u2019s medical record, which form of the medication the patient received.(4) Terminologies should support aggregation of data. While we want our terminologies to support those who record data, we must recognize the legitimate needs for abstraction of data, perhaps from multiple perspectives. For example, if we want to know which patients are taking aspirin preparations, we will want to be able to identify those patients whose records contain \u201cAspergum\u201d (or any of a large number of other specific products), as well as those whose records merely show that they are taking an \u201caspirin preparation.\u201d(5) Terminologies should support reuse of data. Users of data may wish to consider transformations other than simple aggregation, using what is known about the terms by which the data are recorded. For example, if we wish to know whether a patient is taking an antiplatelet agent, an antipyretic, an analgesic, or a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agent, we would want to be able to identify our Aspergum-taking patient as such.(6) Terminologies should support inferencing. The knowledge underlying the terms used to record data should be compatible with knowledge used for conceptual representations for reasoning (by humans and computers), such that the transformation from the former to the latter can be accomplished. We need to be able to reach across from what is on the side of the patient to use it on the side of the clinician; terminologies can help. For example, we would like to be able to use the knowledge that the (conceptual) condition \u201caspirin allergy\u201d is related to the chemical \u201caspirin\u201d and, from that, infer that we should be concerned about aspirin-allergic patients (instances of a universal) who are given aspirin-containing products (instances of another universal).\n",

While it referred to the terminologic entities as \u201cconcepts,\u201d it was describing desired characteristics of universals as well. As long as we consider that the purpose of terminologies is to support the recording and use of actual data, rather than primarily as a pure knowledge base of what is known in biomedicine, I believe that concepts and universals can coexist and commingle in controlled terminologies, to the advantage of those who seek to improve patient care through symbolic representation of patient information.",

            "text": "Fig. 1: Sample contents of the Columbia University/New York Presbyterian Hospital Medical Entities Dictionary (MED). Rectangles correspond to terms that represent conceptual entities, while ovals correspond to terms that represent universals. The extensions of the universals are actual tests, procedures and medications that are related to patients in the electronic health record. Dashed lines delineate different areas in the MED, such as (from left to right) measurable entities (including chemicals), specimens, sampleable entities (including body substances), diagnostic procedures (including laboratory tests), and the data dictionary, (including display information, which is used by the clinical information system for organizing patient data) The solid arrows represent is-a links in the MED, while the dotted lines represent nonhierarchical semantic relations, such as \u201cmeasures substance\u201d (between tests and chemicals), \u201chas specimen\u201d (between tests and specimens), \u201csamples\u201d (between specimens and anatomic substances), \u201chas pharmaceutic component\u201d (between drugs and chemicals), \u201chas display parameter\u201d (between laboratory results displays and laboratory tests) and \u201chas test part\u201d (between laboratory diagnostic batteries and laboratory tests). Laboratory results displays, such as \u201cTherapeutic Drug Level Display\u201d refer to concepts used by the clinical information system for summary result reporting. The Therapeutic Lab Display shows results for digoxin tests, as well as other tests not shown here, such as theophylline tests, verapamil tests, etc.. A \u201cRogosin Profile 2\u201d is an orderable battery of blood tests that includes the \u201cNYH Lab Procedure: Digoxin,\u201d as well as other tests not shown here such as \u201cNYH Lab Procedure: Iron\u201d and \u201cNYH Lab Procedure: Magnesium.\u201d For clarity, some high-level intermediate hierarchical terms between \u201cMedical Entity\u201d and \u201cLaboratory Diagnostic Procedure\u201d and between \u201cMedical Entity\u201d and \u201cPharmacy Concept\u201d have been omitted, as has the is-a link between Chemical\u201d and \u201cSubstance.\u201d \u201cNYH\u201d stands for \u201cNew York Hospital\u201d, a part of New York Presbyterian Hospital.
