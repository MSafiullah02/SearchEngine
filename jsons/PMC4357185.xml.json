            "text": "Liver malignancies are common cancers worldwide and are responsible for approximately one million deaths each year with most HCC patients having poor prognosis as a result of rapid disease progression. The relative 5-year survival rate is about 15% and can be attributed to an advanced stage of disease at the time of diagnosis, the occurrence of cirrhosis and of other co-morbidites [1]. Detection of early stages of disease is essential for an improved prognosis and overall survival. However, apart from alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) only a few serological markers are available in clinical practice (such as Glypican-3, miR-21, fucosylated GP73, \u03b1-fucosidase) with AFP diagnostics remaining unsatisfactory because of its low sensitivity and the non-specific correlation between the clinical behavior of HCC and AFP blood levels. For this reason, new biomarkers are in strong demand [2,3] and more selective markers, such as soluble interleukin-2 receptor levels, are evaluated [4].",

            "text": "Importantly, research into the molecular pathogenesis of HCC identified several signalling pathways as deregulated. This inspired the development of molecularly targeted therapies such as the multikinase inhibitor sorafenib that inhibits signalling of C-RAF-1, MEK, ERK, VEGFR, PDGFR and other kinases, effectively [5]. Given that epidermal growth factor is an important mitogen for hepatocytes we were particularly interested in an understanding of the consequences of its targeted over-expression in liver. In our initial study we reported the oncogenomics and pathology of EGF induced hepatocarcinogenesis and an identification of molecular circuitries linked to exaggerated EGFR signalling [6]. Furthermore, we investigated the serum proteome of EGF-tumour-bearing mice to obtain information on disease-regulated proteins and to search for novel biomarkers at different stages of disease [7]. Note, a regulatory loop was proposed whereby EGF induces transcriptional activation of HDAC2 by CK2\u0391/AKT activation in liver cancer cells [8]. Additionally, inhibition of EGFR in different animal models by Erlotinib was shown to attenuate liver fibrosis and the development of hepatocellular carcinoma [9] thus suggesting new therapeutic intervention strategies in the prevention of HCC. Indeed, the EGF receptor tyrosin kinase plays a much wider role in the immortalization of different cell types as originally anticipated [10], and is highly expressed in a number of solid tumours and EGFR over-expression correlates well with tumour progression, resistance to chemotherapy and poor prognosis.",

This resulted in an identification of 96 statistically significant regulated proteins of which 54 are uniquely expressed in liver cancer. Importantly, 11 out of 54 mouse tumour specific proteins were likewise uniquely expressed in human HCC and 49 disease regulated proteins identified in EGF induced liver cancer were similarly regulated in human HCC, as determined by immunhistochemistry using different antibodies and the information given in the publically available Human Protein Atlas depository. Clinical significance of the identified proteins could be demonstrated and a total of 37 so far unkown proteins could now be related to EGF induced liver cancer, several of which are likely candidates for the development of molecularly targeted therapies. This includes the nucleoside diphosphate kinase A, bifunctional ATP-dependent dihydroxyacetone kinase, phosphatidylethanolamine binding protein1, i.e. an inhibitor of the RAF-1 kinase as well as aldo-keto reductase family 1 proteins, members C14 and C6, interleukin 25 and the v-crk sarcoma virus CT10 oncogene homolog.",

Ion exchange membranes were equilibrated overnight in the appropriate electrolyte (anion exchange membranes in NaOH 0.1 M and cation exchange membranes in H3PO4 0.1 M). After four runs ion exchange membranes were always discarded and new membranes were replaced for the other samples. For each run, the electrode chambers were filled with appropriate fresh electrolytes (30 mL). Initially, the cell was filled with pure water and run for 5 min at 5 watts constant power to remove residual ionic contaminants from the membrane core and ion exchange membranes. Approximately 32 mL of LB2 were used to fill the cell. A total of 60 mg of total proteins in approximately 2 mL of LB2 were added to the cell to reach the maximum loadable volume (40 mL). Focusing started at 12 watts constant power. After approximately 4 hours the voltage increased to 3000 V and the wattage decreased to 3 W. The focused proteins were harvested in 20 ~ 1.5 mL fractions, and pH values were checked. Fractions having pH values between 3 and 7.0 were collected and denoted \u201cA-a\u201d (acid). Fractions having pH values > 7.0 were collected and denoted \u201cA-b\u201d (basic). Again, the protein concentration was determined for both fractions (A-a and A-b) by the Bradford method. Approximately 30 mg of protein were recovered at the end of the liquid-phase IEF pre-fractionation from an initial 60-mg load. The losses are accounted for by the multi-step pre-fractionation procedure, but are not the result of a precipitate that could not be dissolved in our lysis buffer.

In the case of MS/MS-CID the LIFT device was used for selection and fragmentation of the ions; the acceleration voltage in the ion source 8 kV, the Timed Ion Selector was set to 0.4% (relative to parent mass), and argon was used as collision gas (~4-6 \u00d7 10\u20136 mbar). Resulting fragments were further accelerated in a second source by 19 kV and analysed by a two-stage gridless reflectron. Typically, 400 shots were accumulated for the parent ion signal and 1000 shots for the fragments.

Five of them were selected for their novelty (see Table 1) while amphiregulin and epiregulin were chosen for their importance in the EGF-signalling pathway. Furthermore, HNF4\u03b1 was studied for its pivotal role in liver cancer [62]. Depicted in Figure 3 are immunohistochemistry stainings performed with EGF transgenic livers to confirm regulation and predominant cytoplasmic expression of arginase II. Note, ARG2 is only expressed in HCC and recent evidence suggest modulation of arginine levels in the extracellular milieu to be part of an immune escape mechanism whereby lack of local arginine weakens tumour-infiltrating lymphocytes as T cells require adequate argine levels [63]. Likewise, the tumour specific and cytoplasmic expression of the F-actin capping protein \u03b11 subunit (CAPZA1) and the predominant nuclear expression of tubulin \u03b2 that was particularly visible beneath the liver capsule may possible promote microtubule stability and interactions of microtubules with endogenous proteins. Furthermore, the induced and predominat cytoplasmic expression of the GDP dissociation inhibitor 2 (GDI2) protein is part of the control of vesicular trafficking. This protein is known to regulate GDP-GTP exchange amongst members of the Rab family of proteins. The tumour specific and cytoplasmic expression of amphiregulin supports the notion of a switch in autocrine signalling and it has been reported that amphiregulin is a prognostic marker for poor outcome of a variety of malignancies including colorectal liver metastasis [64]. Finally, the repressed nuclear expression of HNF4A was not unexpected and confirms earlier findings [62].",

For example, the proteins ALDOA, ALDOC, FBP1 and PKM function in glycolysis and gluconeogenesis whereas AKR1C6, ALDOA, ALDOC and FBP1 are part of the fructose and mannose metabolic pathway. Likewise, ATP5H and NDUFV1 are part of the oxidative phosphorylation pathway and MDH1 and PKM contribute to pyruvate metabolism. Similarly, the proteins AKR1C14, AKR1C18, AKR1C6, ALB, APOA1, APOA4, APOE, FDPS, GPX1, HACL1 and PLG take part in the metabolism of lipids, arachidonic acid and lipoproteins whereas the proteins AGMAT, ARG1, ARG2, BCKDHA, CKB, CPS1, HAAO and PHGDH are specified for arginine and proline metabolism. In the same manner the proteins GPX1, ITPA and NME1 contribute to the metabolism of nucleotides and related to this are the proteins ITPA, PKM and PSMC5 which are part of the purine metabolic pathway. Apart from these pathways a highly significant regulation of the blood coagulation cascade, platelet activation and fibrinolysis was observed as defined by the proteins CRK, FGA, FGB, FGG, PLG and SOD1 all of which were highly significantly regulated. Furthermore, tRNA aminoacylation (AARS, GARS and SARS), advanced glycosylation endproduct receptor signalling (ALB, CAPZA1 and LGALS3), peroxisome (ECH1, HACL1 and SOD1), protein processing in endoplasmic reticulum (GANAB, HYOU1 and PDIA4), proteasome (PSMC5 and PSMD11) and activation of chaperone genes by XBP1(S) and \u2018unfolded protein response\u2019 (HYOU1 and LMNA) are pathways significantly perturbed in liver cancer induced by EGF (see Additional file 9: Table S9 and Additional file 10: Table S10).",

            "text": "An important finding of the present study is the statistically significant regulation of 20 mitochondria associated proteins of which 13 were repressed while 7 were up-regulated. Similar results were reported by Chignard and Wei Sun with mitochondrial proteins being the second largest proportion of regulated proteins in human viral HCC [15,69]. Among the repressed proteins were NADH dehydrogenase (ubiquinone) 1 alpha subcomplex 8 and prohibitin, a mitochondrial chaperone. This protein, when deleted (prohibitin KO mice) induced fibrosis, bile duct metaplasia, liver dysplasia and eventually multifocal HCC. However, its overexpression in tumour cell lines inhibited cell proliferation to demonstrate tumour suppressor function [70]. Likewise, glutathione peroxidase 1 (response to oxidative stress) and argininosuccinate synthetase 1 (ASS, urea cycle) were repressed. Note, ASS is the first of two enzymes to convert citrulline to arginine and this pathway allows cells to synthesize arginine from citrulline to function in NO production, ammonia detoxification and synthesis of polyamines. Several reports suggest ASS deficiency to be common in tumour cell lines [25-30], and the present study confirms ASS expression to be confined to healthy non-transgenic control liver, but ASS was absent in tumour tissue extracts (see Table 1). Ablation of ASS in diverse tumours suggests a tumour suppressor function and the fact that forced expression of ASS in osteosarcoma cell lines suppresses growth adds weight to this notion [71].",

Note, knowledge on the role of aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases in cancer is just emerging [76] and through the use of a lentiviral mediated shRNA vector, a link between aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases [AARS]-interacting multifunctional protein 2 (AIMP2) and repressed EGFR signalling was established that resulted in repressed glucose uptake [77]. We also observed induced expression of heterogeneous ribonucleoprotein (hnRNP) that takes on diverse functions in the processing of mRNA. Its expression was reported to be increased in serum of HCC patients. In contrast, proteins involved in the synthesis and degradation of cholesterol, lipids, steroids and fatty acid were in part oppositely regulated and included induced expression of the aldo-keto reductase family 1. Regulation of this protein has been reported for lung and pancreatic cancers [78], and gene silencing of aldo-keto reductase family 1 B10 resulted in growth inhibition of colorectal cancer cells that might be of therapeutic utility [79]. The repressed expression of certain proteins may also be considered as an adaptive response and includes the enzyme enoyl coenzyme A hydratase 1. Its activity was shown to contribute to lymphatic spread of liver tumours as was evidenced in gene silencing studies [80]. Likewise, we observed repressed expression of dihydrodiol dehydrogenase in tumours. This enzyme plays an important role in the metabolism of steroids that leads to inactivation of circulating androgens, progestins and glucocorticoids and was repeatedly reported to be overexpressed in non-small cell lung cancer. Amongst patients with high DHD expression the incidence of early tumour recurrence and distant metastasis is significantly higher and patients are highly resistant to chemo and radiotherapy [81].",

This peroxisomal thiamine pyrophosphate-dependent enzyme is rate limiting in the breakdown of 2-hydroxy fatty acids. The biological role of 2-hydroxy fatty acids has only recently become apparent [84] and cumulative evidence suggests intermediates of energy metabolism to specifically activate G-protein coupled receptors which are now classified as hydroxy carboxylic acid receptors (HCA1-3). The HCA2 receptor is involved in a complex negative feed-back loop whereby ketone bodies derived from fatty acid oxidation are sensed by HCA2 via the activity of 3-hydroxybutyrate that leads to inhibition of lipolysis and to restriction of further fatty acid supply. In this way triglyceride use is diverted and energy demands for tumour growth are met more efficiently. Specifically, during rapid tumour growth and the herewith associated ischemia the yield of high energy bonds (ATP) from glucose oxidation is about twice that of fatty acid oxidation. Our observation that proteins involved in the \u00df-oxidation of fatty acids were either repressed or unchanged agrees well with this principle (see also discussion below).",

Sorcin is associated with multidrug-resistance in human leukemia cells [92] and nucleobindin 1 is evaluated as a biomarker of colon cancer [93]. In EGF induced liver tumours transthyretin was also up-regulated. This protein is involved in the transport of thyroid hormones and was reported to be aberrantly regulated in thyroid cancer [94]. Among the newly identified proteins is v-crk sarcoma virus CT10. This oncoprotein interacts with several tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins and is part of the intracellular signalling cascades notably the phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/AKT pathway [95]. Likewise, regulation of the 170 kDa glucose-regulated protein GRP170 is of great importance. This lumenal endoplasmic reticulum plays a role in immunoglobulin folding as was confirmed by co-immunoprecipitation in four different B cell hybridoma cell lines [11]. In our previous study several immunoglobulins were found to be either repressed or absent in serum of EGF tumour bearing mice and this was particularly obvious for the Ig K and L classes [7]. It remains to be determined whether repression of immunoglobulins can be attributed to aberrant GRP170 activity.",

It is synthesized by hepatocytes and an essential blood coagulation factor with all polypeptide chains being highly regulated in tumours of EGF transgenic mice. Note, an association between coagulation factors and malignancies was established whereby fibrinogen functions as an extracellular matrix protein to interact with integrin receptors in the control of cell proliferation and cell migration [96]. Accordingly, induced gene expression of the integrin receptors Itgb1, Itga3 and Itgav was observed in EGF induced liver tumours. In cancer progression a regulatory loop between fibrinogen, platelets and tumour cells has been determined that is activated by platelet cytosolic Ca2+. This second messenger induces integrin receptor complex formation through an association of platelet glycoprotein chains IIb and IIIa (CD41/CD61) thereby creating an active binding site for fibrinogen. An association of tumour regulated proteins with the regulatory loop was confirmed in STRING analysis (Figure 8) and fibrinogen was reported to be an important determinant for metastasis of circulating tumour cells [97]. It is therefore of no surprise that elevated blood fibrinogen is a poor prognostic factor. Haemostatic complications are commonly observed in cancer patients and future therapeutic strategies may focus on the hemostatic system by targeting tumour stroma. In this regard the tumour specific induction of plasminogen is of great importance. This zymogen [98] is converted to plasmin by urokinase (UPA), a serine protease which itself was unchanged; however, gene expression of its receptor was significantly up-regulated in transgenic non-tumour livers. One report suggests the urokinase receptor to prime cells for proliferation in response to EGF by promoting Tyr845 phosphorylation and Stat5b activation; nonetheless, this depended on intracellular c-Src levels [99].",

Based on transcriptomic data a highly significant induction of PAI-I (up to 12-fold) in large tumours of EGF transgenic mice was observed [6]; consequently, the regulation of components of the plasminogen activating system may be considered as part of a strategy to degrade extracellular matrix thereby facilitating invasion and metastasis [102,103].",

Indeed, the redox state and therefore glutathione participates in the hypoxic induction of HIF-1 [107], and two proteins of the glycolytic pathway, i.e. ALDOA1 and ENO1, which respond to HIF-1 signalling, were regulated. Moreover, glutathione peroxidase 1 was shifted in the gel as shown in Figure 1 panel G III as a result of post translational modifications that most likely involved c-Abl and Arg kinase activity at Tyr 96 of GPX1 [108].

This receptor for advanced glycation end-products is a member of the immunoglobulin family of cell surface molecules and was reported to significantly influence hepatic tumour growth in murine models of colorectal carcinoma [109]. There is strong evidence for RAGE to promote cancer growth upon ligand dependent activation and several proteins of the S100 family bind to the extracellular domain of RAGE [110,111]. It is of considerable importance that gene expression of S100a4 and S100a11 was up to 34-fold induced in tumours of EGF transgenic mice, however expression of S100a1 was repressed. Likewise the tumour specific expression of the RAGE binding proteins lectin, galactoside-binding, soluble, 3 and CAPZA1 in tumours of EGF transgenic mice is highly suggestive for a sustained crosstalk between RAGE and EGFR [112]. Although the precise mechanism by which S100 proteins stimulate EGFR signalling remains to be elucidated binding of S100A4 to EGF and to other EGFR ligands was reported to possibly facilitate interaction with the receptor [113]. Similarly, the binding of S100A8/A9 to RAGE was shown to promote migration and invasion of human breast cancer cells through actin polymerization and epithelial\u2013mesenchymal transition [114]. Conversely, advanced glycation endproduct (AGE) receptor 1 suppressed oxidant stress-dependent signalling via the EGFR and Shc/Grb2/Ras pathway [115].",

This enzyme hydrolyzes agmatine (= decarboxylated arginine) to form putrescine and urea and repression of the enzyme will significantly increase agmatine tissue concentration to influence diverse cellular control mechanisms. Importantly, in the study of Battaglia and coworkers [122] 1 mM agmatine induced large amounts of superoxide production in rat liver mitochondria; however, it did not affect mitochondrial respiration or redox levels of thiols and glutathione. Furthermore, ATP synthesis remained normal and prevented Ca(2+)-induced mitochondrial permeability transition in the presence of phosphate to suggest an intriguing regulatory loop whereby H2O2 induces hypoxia signalling that is linked to abberant metabolism, nonetheless by selecting interconnected physiological pathways tumour cells are equipped to avoid programmed cell death [122,123]. Thus, arginine deprivation is evaluated for its utility in cancer therapy [124].",
