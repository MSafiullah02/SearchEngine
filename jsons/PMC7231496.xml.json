In that study, we found that in the early phase of COVID-19 there was low prevalence among ordinary Japanese citizens in the implementation of social distancing measures and avoiding touching the eyes, nose and mouth, 2 of the 5 personal protective measures recommended by the World Health Organization (WHO) (WHO, 2020a). As only 34.7% of survey respondents were implementing all 5 personal protective measures, this clearly revealed that there was still room for improvement regarding personal protective measures implemented by ordinary citizens. Since the time the survey was conducted, the number of laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases within Japan have steadily increased, and on March 19, the Japanese Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare called on the Japanese people to change their behavior regarding personal protective measures, to suppress transmission (JMHLW, 2020b). However, thereafter, the number of reported COVID-19 cases in Japan rapidly increased mainly in major metropolitan areas, such as Tokyo and Osaka regions, and the pandemic shifted into the community transmission phase. On April 7, the number of reported COVID-19 cases in Japan totaled 3,906, which led to the Japanese government to declare a state of emergency (Prime Minister of Japan, 2020). Although unclear, the status of personal protective measures among ordinary citizens may have changed depending on the pandemic phase shift. It is important, therefore, to clarify the current status of such at the community transmission phase when considering what is needed in future awareness activities.",

The study\u2019s participants were recruited from registrants of MyVoice Communication, Inc., a Japanese internet research service company with approximately 1.12 million registered participants as of January 2020. The study aimed to collect data from 2,400 men and women aged 20 to 79 years (sampling by sex and 10-year age groups; 12 groups, n = 200 per group) who were living in seven prefectures in the Tokyo metropolitan area (i.e., Tokyo, Kanagawa, Saitama, Chiba, Ibaraki, Tochigi, and Gunma). The Tokyo metropolitan area is home to approximately 35% of the Japanese population (total area: 32,433.4 km2; total population: 43,512,238 people, as of January 2019). The company invited registrants to participate in the survey by email on February 25 (n = 8,156). The questionnaires were placed in a secured section of a website, and potential respondents received a specific URL in their invitation email. Once 200 participants in each group had responded to the questionnaire voluntarily, no more responses were accepted from that group, and the survey was concluded on February 27 when 200 responses had been collected from all groups.",

In regard to self-isolation and implementing all personal protective measures, those who selected 5 (\u201cNot working\u201d) in the baseline survey or follow-up survey, were excluded from the analysis (n = 776). The McNemar test was performed to compare the prevalence of each personal protective measure between the baseline survey and follow-up survey. To clarify the association between each sociodemographic factor and behavior changes related to each personal protective measure, a multivariate logistic regression analysis was performed to focus on those who did not implement the personal protective measure in the baseline survey. The dependent variable was set as a dichotomous variable coded as \u201c1\u201d if the personal protective measure was adopted in the follow-up survey and \u201czero\u201d otherwise. The dependent variable was prepared for each of the 5 personal protective measures recommended by the WHO and implementing all personal protective measures.

Regarding self-isolation, those who selected 5 (\u201cNot working\u201d), in either the baseline survey or follow-up survey, were excluded from the analysis, therefore working status was removed from the aforementioned independent variables.

There were significant improvements in social distancing measures during the community transmission phase compared to the early phase of the COVID-19 outbreak. However, the prevalence of avoiding touching the eyes, nose and mouth was approximately 60%, indicating no significant improvement. Moreover, men and persons with low household income levels made fewer behavior changes for some personal protective measures when compared with women and persons with high household income levels. This study suggests that the implementation status of personal protective measures in ordinary citizens changes with each pandemic phase. This study also reveals that while the implementation of personal protective measures had improved in the pandemic phase of COVID-19, there is potential for improvement, especially when it comes to avoiding touching eyes, nose and mouth, and among men and persons with low household income levels.",

            "text": "During the early phase of the COVID-19 outbreak, the prevalence of social distancing measures and avoiding touching the eyes, nose and mouth was approximately 60%, and these measures had much lower prevalence than other personal protective measures. However, in the community transmission phase, while there was a significant increase in the prevalence of social distancing measures, the prevalence of the latter measures remained almost unchanged. These differences may be due to differences in awareness activities introduced by the Japanese government. From the early phase of the COVID-19 outbreak, the adoption of measures by the Japanese government to cope with COVID-19 infection focused on identifying clusters of COVID-19 patients by tracing the route of transmission of patients with COVID-19. Among these measures, the Japanese Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare reported that clusters tended to occur in locations that satisfied 3 conditions: (i) closed spaces with poor ventilation, (ii) crowded spaces with many people, and (iii) conversations and vocalization in close proximity (within one arm's length of one another). Such locations included for instance, athletic gyms and buffet style meals (JMHLW, 2020b). Based on this report, the Japanese Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare issued large-scale warnings to ordinary citizens to resist going to locations that satisfied these 3 conditions, in conjunction with educational activity about hand hygiene and respiratory etiquette (JMHLW, 2020c). Additionally, on March 26, the governors of Tokyo and 4 neighboring prefectures issued a joint message urging people to avoid crowded places (Tokyo Metropolitan Government, 2020). The implementation of social distancing measures is thought to have vastly improved through these awareness activities. On the other hand, there were no large-scale awareness activities related to avoiding touching the eyes, nose and mouth, which is assumed to be the reason for the lack of improvement in that behavior. Moreover, face touching behavior is a common habit (Kwok et al., 2015), therefore unless one is extremely careful, it may be difficult to stop. This study suggests that the implementation status of personal protective measures in ordinary citizens can change with each pandemic phase and awareness activities that are introduced. It may be important to monitor these changes for developing effective educational activities.",

It may be effective to focus on populations with such sociodemographic characteristics when providing education on personal protective measures during an infectious disease pandemic, which can lead to constraints on both time and resources. Previous studies on self-isolation have reported that people who are unable to work from home or lose income when absent from work have a lower rate of self-isolation (Blake et al., 2010, Eastwood et al., 2009). It may be essential to implement recommendations for working from home as well as salary compensation to enhance the prevalence of self-isolation, rather than simply executing awareness activities.",

The most important point is the fact that participants in this study were recruited from people enrolled at a single internet research company, and the results may have been affected by a selection bias. Relatively little is known about the characteristics of people in online communities (Wright, 2017). Furthermore, the age and sex demographics of the participants in this study were different from that of the general Japanese population (Statistics Bureau of Japan, 2019). Second, the results may only be directly applied to the Japanese population. In the case of other populations with different cultural, ethnic, and geographical backgrounds, the prevalence of personal protective measures and implementation status of behavior change may be differ considerably when compared with those reported in the present survey. Despite these limitations, to the best of our knowledge, this study is the first study to clarify the behavior changes in personal protective measures among ordinary Japanese citizens from the early phase of COVID-19 in Japan to the community transmission phase, and to identify an association between the behavior changes and each sociodemographic factor.",
