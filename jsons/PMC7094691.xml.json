The natural products that they have yielded have not only helped eradicate disease and alleviate suffering, but also greatly increased the average life expectancy. The first major contribution of microbes began back in 1928, when Alexander Fleming discovered in a Petri dish seeded with Staphylococcus aureus that a compound produced by a mold killed the bacterium. The mold, Penicillium notatum, produced an active agent that was named penicillin. Fleming\u2019s discovery began the microbial drug era. By using the same method, other naturally occurring substances, like chloramphenicol and streptomycin, were later isolated from bacterial fermentations. Naturally occurring antibiotics are produced by fermentation, an old technique that can be traced back almost 8000 years, initially for beer and wine production, and recorded in the written history of ancient Egypt and Mesopotamia. During the past 4000 years, Penicillium roqueforti has been utilized for cheese production, and for the past 3000 years, soy sauce in Asia and bread in Egypt represented examples of traditional fermentations.1",

The industrial microbiologist, however, desires a strain that will overproduce the molecule of interest. Development of higher-producing strains involves mutagenesis and, more recently, recombinant DNA technologies.9 Although some metabolites of interest can be made by plants or animals, or by chemical synthesis, the recombinant microbe is usually the \u2018creature of choice\u2019. Thousand-fold increases in production of small molecules have been obtained by mutagenesis and/or genetic engineering. The use of genome mining to discover new fungal natural products has been reviewed by Wiemann and Keller.10 Other important parts of industrial production include creating a proper nutritional environment for the organism to grow and produce its product, and the avoidance of negative effects such as inhibition and/or repression by carbon, nitrogen and phosphorus sources, metals and the final product itself. Avoidance of enzyme decay is also desired.4, 11",

Cyclosporin A was originally discovered in the 1970s as a narrow-spectrum antifungal peptide produced by the mold, Tolypocladium nivenum (previously Tolypocladium inflatum) in an aerobic fermentation.15 Cyclosporins are a family of neutral, highly lipophilic, cyclic undecapeptides containing some unusual amino acids, synthesized by a nonribosomal peptide synthetase, cyclosporin synthetase. Discovery of the immunosuppressive activity of this secondary metabolite led to its use in heart, liver and kidney transplants and to the overwhelming success of the organ transplant field.16 Cyclosporin was approved for use in 1983. It is thought to bind to the cytosolic protein cyclophilin (immunophilin) of immunocompetent lymphocytes, especially T lymphocytes. This complex of cyclosporin and cyclophilin inhibits calcineurin that under normal circumstances is responsible for activating the transcription of interleukin-2. It also inhibits lymphokine production and interleukin release and therefore leads to a reduced function of effector T cells. Annual world sales of cyclosporin A are \u223c$2 billion. Cyclosporin A also has activity against coronaviruses.17",

These agents act by interacting with an intracellular protein (an immunophilin), thus forming a novel complex that selectively disrupts the signal transduction events of lymphocyte activation. Their targets are inhibitors of signal transduction cascades in microbes and humans. In humans, the signal transduction pathway is required for activation of T cells. Fingolimod (FTY720), another immunosuppressant, was approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 2010, specifically for relapsing forms of multiple sclerosis. The drug, initially discovered by Professors Fujita, Yoshitomi and Taito in collaboration, is a derivative of myriocin isolated from the fungus Isaria sinclairii.

Bartolomeo Gosio (1863\u20131944), an Italian physician, discovered the compound in 1893.18 Gosio isolated a fungus from spoiled corn that he named Penicillium glaucum, and that was later reclassified as Penicillium brevicompactum. He isolated crystals of the compound from culture filtrates in 1896 and found it to inhibit growth of Bacillus anthracis. This was the first time an antibiotic had been crystallized and the first time that a pure compound had ever been shown to have antibiotic activity. The work was forgotten but fortunately the compound was rediscovered by Alsberg and Black19 and given the name mycophenolic acid. They used a strain originally isolated from spoiled corn in Italy called Penicillium stoloniferum, a synonym of P. brevicompactum. The chemical structure was elucidated many years later (1952) by Birkinshaw et al.20 in England. Mycophenolic acid has antibacterial, antifungal, antiviral, antitumor, antipsoriasis and immunosuppressive activities. Its antiviral activity is exerted against yellow fever, dengue virus and Japanese encephalitis virus.21 It was never commercialized as an antibiotic because of its toxicity, but its 2-morpholinoethylester was approved as a new immunosuppressant for kidney transplantation in 1995 and for heart transplants in 1998.22 The ester is called mycophenolate mofetil (CellCept) and is a prodrug that is hydrolyzed to mycophenolic acid in the body. It is sometimes used along with cyclosporin in kidney, liver and heart transplants. Furthermore, the mycophenolic acid delayed-release tablet was approved in 2004 by the FDA as an antimetabolite immunosuppressant indicated for prophylaxis of organ rejection in kidney transplant. This delayed-release tablet is called Myfortic and is produced by Novartis, with annual sales of $637 million in 2013, $543 million in 2014 and $441 million in 2015. In addition, mycophenolic acid appears to have anti-angiogenic activity.23",

Many people cannot control their level of cholesterol at a healthy level by diet alone and require hypocholesterolemic agents. High blood cholesterol leads to atherosclerosis, a chronic, progressive disease characterized by continuous accumulation of atheromatous plaque within the arterial wall, causing stenosis and ischemia. Atherosclerosis is a leading cause of human death. The past two decades have witnessed the introduction of a variety of anti-atherosclerotic therapies. The statins form a class of hypolipidemic drugs, formed as secondary metabolites by fungi, and are used to lower cholesterol by inhibiting the rate-limiting enzyme of the mevalonate pathway of cholesterol biosynthesis; that is, 3-hydroxymethyl glutaryl-CoA reductase. Inhibition of this enzyme in the liver stimulates low-density lipoprotein receptors, resulting in an increased clearance of low-density lipoprotein from the bloodstream and a decrease in blood cholesterol levels. They can reduce total plasma cholesterol by 20\u201340%. Through their cholesterol-lowering effect, they reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease, prevent stroke and reduce the development of peripheral vascular disease.26",

The history of the statins has been described by Akira Endo, the discoverer of the first statin, compactin (mevastatin; ML-236B).27 This first member of the group was isolated as an antibiotic product of P. brevicompactum.28 At about the same time, it was found by Endo et al.29 as a cholesterolemic product of Penicillium citrinum. Although compactin was not of commercial importance, its derivatives achieved strong medical and commercial success. Lovastatin (monacolin K; mevinolin; Mevacor) was isolated in broths of Monascus rubra and Aspergillus terreus.30, 31 Lovastatin, developed by Merck and approved by the FDA in 1987, was the first commercially marketed statin. In its chemical structure, lovastatin has a hexahydronaphthalene skeleton substituted with a p-hydroxy-lactone moiety (Figure 1).",

This oxygenated carotenoid pigment is used in the feed, food and cosmetic industries. It is responsible for the orange to pink color of salmonid flesh and the reddish color of boiled crustacean shells. Feeding of pen-reared salmonids with a diet containing this yeast induces pigmentation of the white muscle.91 It is a very good antioxidant, 10 times more active than \u03b2-carotene and 100 times more than \u03b1-tocopherol. It is the second most important carotenoid. Astaxanthin enhances the immune system and protects skin from radiation injury and cancer. It can be produced synthetically as hydroxyl-astaxanthin from petrochemicals with a selling price of $2500 kg\u22121. However, the natural product is favored because the synthetic product is a mixture of stereoisomers. Natural astaxanthin is more stable than the synthetic version and more bioavailable; that is, it has a higher degree of absorption into a living system. The natural product is present in algae and fish as mono- and di-esters of fatty acids. However, it is difficult to hydrolyze the esters from algae, limiting its usage to trout and salmon. The yeast product is better as it is the 97% free, nonesterified (3R, 3\u2019R) stereoisomer. The astaxanthin market was $219 million in 2007, with 97% being synthetic. Most of the production processes with the yeast yield levels of astaxanthin <100 mg l\u22121. However, white light improved production to 420 mg l\u22121,92 and mutant strain UBv-AX2 can make 580 mg l\u22121.93",

Resistance to artemisinin and its derivatives is increasing but is still mild. The level of artemisinin in A. annua is very low (0.01\u20131% of the weight of the dried leaves). Thus, genetic engineering has been pursued. A genetically engineered S. cerevisiae strain producing 100 mg l\u22121 of artemisinic acid has been developed by the Keasling group in Berkeley, California. Artemisinic acid can be chemically converted to artemisinin. Keasling\u2019s company, Amyris Biotechnologies, has increased the amount of artemisinic acid produced by one million fold. The artemisinin precursor amorpha-4,11-diene is made by the engineered S. cerevisae at 40 g l\u22121.108",

Acetic and lactic acids are used as food preservatives. Lactic acid is also used to produce the biodegradable polymer polylactide. Citric and malic acids are food additives. Gluconic acid is used to chelate divalent and trivalent metal ions. Acrylic and adipic acids are employed to make polymers. Glycolic acid is used in the textile industry as a tanning and dyeing agent. The main acids showing promise for microbial production are succinic, lactic and itaconic acids. S. cerevisiae could become a leading organism for carboxylic acid production, mainly because it can grow at low pH. It was the first eukaryote to have its entire genome sequenced. Considerable genetic engineering has been done with this yeast. Also important is its naturally occurring, episomally replicating plasmid, named the 2-\u03bc plasmid. The organism can make lactic acid at 62 g l\u22121 and malic acid at 50 g l\u22121.",

Methyl erythritol phosphate pathway has been used to produce taxadiene, the isoprenoid precursor of the anticancer agent taxol. Because plants and naturally occurring microbes produce only small quantities of isoprenoids, fermentation with engineered microbes has become the way to produce carotenoids, sterols and artemisinin. Artemisinin is a potent antimalarial and also a part of antimalarial combination therapies.",

One of the producing microbes is S. cerevisiae.128 The S. cerevisiae mevalonate pathway has been engineered in E. coli yielding the terpene farnesyl diphosphate, the precursor to amorphadiene. The amorphadiene titer was 281 mg l\u22121. This was increased to 480 mg l\u22121 by fermentation modifications. Further genetic and fermentation modifications increased the amorphadiene titer to 27.4 g l\u22121 and then to 41 g l\u22121. This led to production of 25g l\u22121 of artemisinic acid. By an inexpensive chemical process, the artemisinic acid was converted into the semisynthetic artemisinin. Artemisinin has been approved as an antimalarial agent by the World Health Association and is being produced commercially by Sanofi (see Antimalarial agent section).",

A review of xylitol production from lignocellulosic waste has been written by Lima de Albuquerque et al.146 Xylitol is a low-calorie sweetener used by diabetics with 40% fewer calories than sucrose. It is noncariogenic and has insulin-independent metabolism properties. Xylitol has high solubility, low glycemic rate, lack of carcinogenicity and has cariostatic properties. It is used in food production. It is made by catalytic hydrogenation of xylose but this is very expensive. Its global market is over 125 000 tons per year and it sells for $4.50\u20135.50 per kg to pharmaceutical and food companies. It has a 12% share of the total polyol market for chewing gum and foods. It is used as a sucrose replacement for cakes, cookies, chocolate and chewing gum, and in pharmaceuticals to reduce tooth decay. It acts against oral biofilms especially against Streptococcus mutans. It is also active against other bacteria harmful to oral health, such as Streptococcus pneumoniae, Hemophilus influenzae, S. aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. It has also been cited as a contributor to tooth calcification, and is active against diabetes, anemia, acute otitis media and osteoporosis. Of great interest is its production from xylose in lignocellulosic materials as 100% of the xylose can be converted to xylitol microbially. This is favored over chemical synthesis that uses more intense reaction conditions and yields undesirable coproducts that have to be removed. Fermentation of xylose to xylitol occurs under milder conditions of temperature and pressure, yielding lower levels of unwanted by-products. Cell-free systems have been used, but immobilized systems hold great promise because of higher levels of xylitol produced, as well as the possibility of reuse of successive cultures as a fed-batch process or prolonged fermentations during continuous processes. Systems used include stirred tank reactors, packed-bed reactors, fluidized bed reactors, bubble columns and air-lift reactors. Processes include batch culture, fed-batch or semi-continuous culture and continuous culture. Bioconversion of 300 g l\u22121 xylose to xylitol by Debaryomyces hansenii amounted to 110 g l\u22121.147 The yield was 0.48 g g\u22121. Repeated fed-batch fermentation (lasting 750 h) with high-cell density cultures of Candida magnolia TISTR 5663 in a 2-l stirred tank fermenter under oxygen limitation with feeding of xylose and nitrogen and a starting xylose concentration of 60 g l\u22121 led to production of 284 g l\u22121 of xylitol,148 the highest titer ever achieved. Xylitol productivity was 1.49 g l\u22121 h\u22121. Candida tropicalis has also been used by other groups. The overall conclusion is that immobilization of yeast cells is an excellent way to produce xylitol from xylose. Immobilization was best when entrapment in calcium alginate, followed by solid adsorption, was used.",

Production of ethanol and advanced biofuels at high temperature (ca 40 \u00b0C) reduces cooling costs, lowers the effects of contamination and enables more efficient hydrolysis of feedstocks. This improves productivity in the simultaneous saccharification and fermentation process. However, temperatures of 34 \u00b0C and above interfere with yeast viability and growth. Caspeta et al.158 isolated S. cerevisiae strains with improved growth and ethanol production at 40 \u00b0C. They used adaptive laboratory evolution to obtain these mutant strains. They noted a change in sterol composition from ergosterol to fenosterol because of a mutation in the C5 sterol desaturase gene, and increased expression of sterol biosynthesis genes. The new strains grew 1.9 times faster and excreted ethanol and glycerol 1.6 times faster than the parent culture. Sterols contribute to membrane fluidity. These thermotolerant strains were improved in glucose consumption rate that was increased by 60% at 40 \u00b0C and by 300% at 42 \u00b0C.",

However, some genetically engineered S. cerevisiae strains can utilize xylose. To improve the production of ethanol by a xylose-utilizing strain of S. cerevisiae, the HAP4 gene was knocked out.159 This gene encodes a transcription activator that controls expression of genes involved in mitochondrial respiration and reductive pathways. By knocking out the HAP4 gene, the following were increased: maximal ethanol concentration, ethanol production rate and ethanol yield. A new strain, S. cerevisiae B42-DHAP4, could produce ethanol from xylose as sole carbon source under aerobic conditions. The rate of ethanol production and its yield from a detoxified hydrolysate of wood chips were markedly improved.",

Today, crude oil is consumed at 11.6 million tons per day that cannot last for a long time. Biodiesel use requires no engine modification. It is blended with diesel in Germany, Italy and Malaysia. It is better than diesel as it is biodegradable, nontoxic and releases less toxicant when burned as a fuel. Chemical catalysis is presently used to make biodiesel but enzymatic catalysis is looked upon as better from the aspects of mild reaction conditions and easy product separation. Current biodiesel production suffers from the lack of a stable, sufficient feedstock supply system, inconsistent performance and challenging economics. Microbial production could overcome these problems because of short producing period, little labor requirement, easy scale-up and independence from problems of venue, season, climate change, etc. So-called \u2018grease microorganisms\u2019 (oleaginous microbes that supply fatty acids and alcohols and convert them to biodiesel) could supply the fatty acids needed. Their composition of the fatty acids is similar to vegetable oils that are used to make biodiesel. They have >50% lipid content, can be used industrially, grow rapidly, are not polluting and oil can be easily extracted. Microalgae have been considered as an oil feedstock but their use is restricted by their low growth rate, strict breeding conditions and large up-front investment requirement. Alcohol is needed in the transesterification process to generate the fatty acid ester. Methanol or ethanol can be used to generate the fatty acid ester. Methanol makes fatty acid methyl esters, whereas ethanol yields fatty acid ethyl esters. Fatty acid methyl esters are cheaper, more reactive and volatile. However, ethanol is less toxic, and more renewable than methanol. S. cerevisiae has been genetically engineered for de novo biosynthesis of biodiesel. Of potential importance is Y. lipolytica for microbial biodiesel production.",

It is a semisynthetic derivative of pneumocandin B0, a lipophilic cyclic peptide isolated from the fungus, Glarea lozoyensis.171 The sales of this antifungal, which was sold under the name Cancidas by Merck, was $681 million in 2014 and $573 million in 2015. The second antifungal from the echinocandin class that was licensed was micafungin, sold under the trade name Fungard/Mycamine by Astellas Pharma. It achieved annual sales of 38.8 billion yen or about $352 million in 2014, and in 2015 the sales reached 41.6 billion yen or $346 million. Patients who have received either of these antifungal agents have reported mild adverse events that include local phlebitis, fever, abnormal liver function tests and hemolysis.170 Echinocandins are usually given once daily, via the parenteral route, because of poor absorption after oral administration. Caspofungin has shown promising results in studies of candidemia and invasive candidiasis, with nearly the same efficacy as amphotericin B, but markedly less toxicity. Because of the absence of antagonism and very minimal drug interactions with other antifungal agents, the echinocandin class represents a promising therapeutic area that may potentially be used in combination for the treatment of invasive aspergillosis.",

            "text": "For the past 85 years, microbes have provided significant contributions to the fields of medicine and agriculture, especially in the area of antibiotic production. The compounds they have produced have helped save millions of lives, alleviated pain and suffering and increased human life expectancy. In addition, they have also played a vital role in the animal industry and agricultural operations. However, for a variety of reasons, pathogenic microbes have become resistant to many antibiotics, creating a dangerous situation. Therefore, the need for new and effective antibiotics is imperative. Unfortunately, most of the large pharmaceutical companies have abandoned the search for new antimicrobial compounds. Because of economics, they have concluded that drugs directed against chronic diseases offer a better revenue stream than do antimicrobial agents, for which the length of treatment is short and government restriction is likely. Some small pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies are still developing antibiotics, but most depend on venture capital rather than sales income and, with the present regulations, face huge barriers to enter into the market. These barriers were raised with the best intentions of ensuring public safety but they are having the opposite effect; that is, termination of antibiotic development while resistance continues to increase.172 However, there are some new bright possibilities. One of the more promising is the utilization of uncultivated microorganisms. Considering that 99% of bacteria and 95% of fungi have not yet been cultivated in the laboratory, efforts to find means to grow such uncultured microorganisms is proceeding and succeeding.5 Furthermore, researchers are now extracting bacterial DNA from soil samples, cloning large fragments into, for example, bacterial artificial chromosomes, expressing them in a host bacterium and screening the library for new antibiotics. This metagenomic effort could open up the exciting possibility of a large untapped pool from which new natural products could be discovered.173 Another exciting possibility is that of genome mining.174 In addition to these relatively new techniques, chemical and biological modification of old antibiotics could still supply new and powerful drugs. These comments also apply to nonantibiotics such as antitumor agents and other microbial products. In addition, natural products must continue to be tested for desirable therapeutic activities. We believe that significant progress in identifying new antibiotics, oncology therapeutics and other useful medicines will be made, probably not by the big pharmaceutical companies, but by biotechnology companies and small research groups from institutes and universities.",
