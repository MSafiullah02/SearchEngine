Taking a one-size-fits-all approach to projects would be an exercise in futility, while there aren\u2019t enough pages in this book to describe all the variations in project types that can and do occur. But projects do tend to have some commonalities that allow most of them to be divided up into several bins, if the bins are made large enough. Projects can be divvied up between these bins based on both the initial strategy (screening) and the kind of drug they\u2019re expected to result in (market strategy). Needless to say, these particular alphas and omegas will influence many of the letters in between.",

It represents an ongoing, labor-intensive process that can be rate-limiting, but is necessary to avoid disastrous losses in time, money, and manpower that occur when a clinical drug fails to work because its target is not at all crucial to disease progression or symptoms. Target identification (TID), in this case the process whereby a new target is first proposed based on some minimal evidence, is less cumbersome but still requires devoted resources.

Trying to find enough room to squeeze in and enjoy may not be easy. After the first-in-class drug, a plethora of competing drugs will probably follow. And, as a recent study has shown, that profitable period of market exclusivity, when a single first-in-class approved drug exists for a given target, is becoming shorter and shorter, down to an average of 1.8 years in the late 1990s1 and probably to only a matter of months today.",

Many useful, profitable drugs have come out of this approach. And this approach per se doesn\u2019t imply that chemists will be bored to tears generating compounds nearly identical to a known drug but falling into an IP loophole: patent poaching (another two-word epitaph). At least in theory, an established target can be approached with molecules resembling established drugs or it can be targeted with compounds looking nothing like any of them.

This can take the form of greater efficacy (clinical studies prove that it just works better), better dosing regimen (say once daily as opposed to several times a day), or reduced toxicity (causing fewer or less severe side effects). What do these things mean to the medicinal chemist? They mean that while synthesizing and selecting the clinical candidate the emphasis will be on superiority to the existing drug in terms of some important and hopefully measurable property such as in vivo half-life in PK studies, where superiority could mean once (q.d.) versus thrice (t.i.d.) daily dosing, or selectivity against known antitargets implicated in observed toxicity for the existing drug. If no such advantage is found and the best that can be obtained is something equivalent to what\u2019s already out there or soon will be, the company may decide not to spend many millions of dollars required to try and bring it to the market. But the catch is that often advantages or disadvantages may not become evident until Phase II or Phase III clinical trials or even later, so who can really say short of that?

No physician is going to ask a patient, \u201cWouldn\u2019t you rather take an oxazole than a pyrimidine?\u201d Once a drug has reached clinical testing, structure is largely irrelevant. Only two things really matter: safety and efficacy. That\u2019s where your compound needs to demonstrate its uniqueness. If the oxazole is less likely than the pyrimidine to be biotransformed into a toxic metabolite, allowing the question to become, \u201cWouldn\u2019t you rather take a safer compound than a more dangerous one?\u201d then the clinical and marketing advantages are obvious. Structural dissimilarity probably will provide a basis for new chemistry, new papers, and patents, all of which really are benefits.

So in this case, although a theoretical basis for mechanistic toxicity might be postulated (buildup of lactic acid due to hepatic gluconeogenesis inhibition, one of the effects of both drugs), it appears that the toxicity was largely compound dependent. Phenformin was withdrawn from the US market while metformin still does brisk sales. Two other diabetes drugs, the PPAR\u03b3 agonists Rezulin (troglitazone), which was withdrawn from the market due to liver toxicity, and Avandia (rosiglitazone) still an important drug today, although one recently highlighting another toxicity concern,7 share a similar story with a different type of toxicity involved.",

As we saw in Chapter 3, it takes 18 months from the date of filing for a patent application to be published. So whatever holes you find in their published ones may be in the process of being patched before you ever find them. Even leads which may have come out of screening and appeared to be proprietary may not be.

Renin, an aspartyl protease, is involved early on in the angiotensin pathway, which the well known angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) is involved in later, and which largely regulates blood pressure. Renin inhibitors have been around for decades. But these inhibitors tended to be rather large, peptide-like compounds and problems with oral bioavailability kept them from becoming drugs. Before the appearance of aliskiren, renin inhibitor projects were most notable for having eventually provided leads for another aspartyl protease that came along much later, HIV protease.

This process goes by the name of forward genetics. Mutagenesis here is usually accomplished through the random mutations induced by a nasty chemical mutagen like ENU, ethylnitrosourea.

First of all, the high-tech nature of many of the sophisticated assay techniques involved means that licenses need to be taken out and often expensive license fees paid before assays can even be done. Examples include the use of green fluorescent protein (GFP), a frequently employed reporter gene, and the previously mentioned HCV replicon assay. HCV is a particularly expensive area to do research in since fees will also need to be paid to Chiron (now Novartis) which, owing to the groundbreaking work done by its scientists, owns the viral genome patent. Other expenses associated with such a project will include specialized equipment as well as costs associated with the frequently lengthy assay development process itself.

But the reality is that a drug going into the clinic without a known target is at a serious disadvantage, and many companies will be reluctant to pursue it for that reason.

Knowing what the target is can also give scientists an idea of what the antitargets, related proteins possibly responsible for toxicity, might be. So in the real world identification of hits using phenotype screening will inevitably be followed by attempts to determine what target or targets are giving the effect. Target identification, in this case based on real cellular effects instead of correlative evidence and theory, has not been avoided but only postponed. When it comes, it will be because an exciting new lead has been found from phenotype screening. Timelines will therefore be short and resources will need to be poured into it. It will be a far from trivial effort and may even call for more biologists than a small company has available. Additionally, chemists will probably be needed early on. This could be for several reasons. The initial hit can often be too weak (say 50 \u03bcM) to be useful in determining the target so that a certain amount of blind optimization needs to be done up front. Structural modifications involving linkers and/or labels may need to be carried out to fish out the target protein, as discussed below. So much excitement can be generated that chemists become eager to just start making analogs. All of these cases require the commitment of at least a few chemists to a still highly speculative preproject. These FTEs will need to be planned for in advance to avoid premature (and predictable) project termination for lack of resources later on.",

That being said, this technique has had some successes. In one such instance, a comparison of 2D gels for an antiproliferative natural product, LAF389, showed a small shift in a protein which was traced to the incorporation of a single N-terminal methionine residue into the treated cells, suggesting that the compound was acting as an inhibitor of methionine aminopeptidases (MetAPs).102\n",
