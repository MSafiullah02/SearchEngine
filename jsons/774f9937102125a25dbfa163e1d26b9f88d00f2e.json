The refl exes are induced by stimulation of the airway and lung receptors, again depending on the lung volume and local pressure at the moment. At the early phase of inspiration, the lung volume is very low, just starting to increase gradually from its functional residual capacity (FRC). There is a strong general tendency to inspire at this point [ 5 ] .",

            "text": "Inspiratory efforts can be provoked by various methods for stimulating airway rapidly adapting receptors (RARs). In cats, rapid inspiratory efforts can be evoked by nasopharyngeal stimulation, manifesting as the sniff-and gasp-like aspiration refl ex (AspR) [ 1 , 6 -8 ] and by rapid lung infl ation [ 5 ] , which decreases the frequency and intensity of the subsequent expiratory efforts of cough and postpones them [ 9 ] . During gastroesophageal refl ux or inhalation of irritant substances to the larynx, there is a strong \"urge to cough\" that can be voluntarily suppressed. To prevent aspiration of irritant substances into the lower airways, the necessary effort of coughing may be postponed by a previous, very slow voluntary inspiration followed by breathholding and swallowing of the bolus to the esophagus. Only then can the effort to cough be initiated for expulsion of irritants from the airways [ 10 -12 ] . Similar voluntary cough suppression commonly decreases the disturbing effect of coughing during a concert. It can similarly strongly inhibit dissemination of airborne infections due to coughing. Such ventilatory maneuvers might be usefully applied to the fi ght against fl u pandemics and other widespread respiratory infection outbreaks.",

Also, because of the Hering Breuer inspiration inhibiting refl ex (HBIIR), after inspiratory \"switch-off\" the V T induces the expiratory phase. The tendency to expire is strong at the end of tidal inspiration [ 5 ] . Therefore, stimulation of laryngeal RARs interrupts the inspiration and evokes laryngoconstriction and the expiration refl ex (ExpR) [ 1 , 7 , 8 ] . Additionally, an inspired or infl ated volume above the normal V T or blockade of lung defl ation at the beginning of expiration by positive pressure can adequately speed up and increase the intensity of the subsequent expiratory effort. It is caused by stimulation of airway receptors and manifests as the Hering Breuer expiration facilitating refl ex (HBEFR) [ 5 ] .",

Such rapid expiratory efforts might promote expulsion of infected mucus, preventing its protrusion from the larynx to the lungs and preclude, or at least postpone, the development of dangerous aspiration pneumonia [ 13 ] . A proposed voluntary breathing maneuver consists of several rapid sniffs with a closed mouth of 0.5 s duration, each followed by forced expiration lasting about 3 s. Such a maneuver might save many lives and improve the quality of life of millions of people worldwide during imminent fl u pandemics or other widespread respiratory infections. The early inspiratory sniffs and other spasmodic inspirations, including provocation of the AspR, result in down-regulation of coughing and may substantially retard a fl u or other respiratory infection pandemic.",

Such up-regulation may prevent, or at least postpone, the development of mostly fatal aspiration pneumonia. The sniff-and gasp-like AspR provoked by nasopharyngeal stimulation in anesthetized cats decreased the number and intensity of cough efforts provoked in the tracheobronchial region [ 9 ] . Similarly, the urge to cough may be suppressed, and even the motor act of coughing might be inhibited or at least postponed by voluntary action, helping to decrease the dissemination of airborne infections [ 11 , 12 ] . Rapid, deep breaths through the nose, but not through the mouth, have bronchoprotective and bronchospasmolytic effects in probands and patients with mild bronchial asthma. This bronchoprotective effect in humans requires rapid inspiratory airfl ow [ 14 , 15 ] . The sniff-like voluntary inspiration decreases the bronchoconstriction detected by one-second forced expiratory volume (FEV 1 ), induced by metacholine inhalation in adult asthmatics [ 16 ] and decreased the number of coughs provoked by capsaicin inhalation in young asthmatics [ 17 ] . These results indicate a refl ex origin of the bronchodilator effect of nasopharyngeal stimulation, which decreases in parallel with bronchodilation and bronchoconstrictor-triggered coughing [ 18 ] . Taking advantage of voluntary airway refl exes and ventilatory maneuvers have many important practical applications [ 19 ] . They include detection of preparatory movement activity in the premotor area in persons in a vegetative state [ 20 , 21 ] . The control of wheelchairs by trained paraplegics [ 22 ] can be reproduced by voluntary performance of aspiration and expiration refl exes, representing binary signals [ 19 ] . Gasping respiration developing in animals can provide autoresuscitation for few minutes even during cardiac arrest [ 23 ] . Therefore, provocation of the gasp-like AspR persisting even in agonal state or voluntary sniffs, might provide autoresuscitation in emergency situations [ 7 , 19 ] .",
