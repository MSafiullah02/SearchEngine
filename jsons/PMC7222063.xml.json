The physiological cell death of normal cells is mostly apoptosis, whereas pathologic tumor cell death is mainly necrosis [19]. Apoptotic cell-derived DNA fragments are generally < 200 bp in length, whereas necrotic cell-derived DNA fragments are more random in size and contain longer sizes of DNA (~ 200\u2013400 bp) [20]. The circulating cell-free DNA (cfDNA) integrity, calculated as the ratio of the longer DNA fragment concentration to the shorter DNA fragment concentration, has been investigated in the efforts to find biomarkers for the diagnosis of various cancers [21, 22]. The Alu element, which is the most abundant repetitive element in the human genome, is frequently used in these efforts, and it is the most reliable target of DNA integrity [21, 22]. We conducted the present study to investigate the possibility of using the circulating cfDNA integrity as a biomarker of vaccine therapy for patients with ovarian cancer.",

It is thus conceivable that the decrease in cfDNA integrity that we observed after the first vaccination was due to an increase of Alu-115. However, the decrease in cfDNA integrity reflected mainly the decrease of Alu-247. One possible reason for this is that a partial conversion of the tumor cells' death from necrosis to apoptosis induced a reduction of Alu-247. The effect of this conversion was less on the Alu-115 levels since Alu-115 reflects the total plasma cell-free DNA (including both apoptosis- and necrosis-derived DNA).",
