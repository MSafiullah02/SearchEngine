On March 31, a patient with COVID-19 and intestinal ischemia presented to the San Salvatore Academy Hospital, L'Aquila, Italy. After surgery, he was transferred to the COVID Intensive Care Unit located in a pavilion outside the hospital. The problem arose from the lack of a portable ventilator. During the transfer, we provided manual ventilation using the DAR reservoir bag (Medtronic, Minneapolis, MN). We added a high-efficiency particulate air filter but felt it was more effective to place the filter on the expiratory exit of the DAR reservoir bag and not between the latter and the endotracheal tube as was described by Liew et al. 3 We used a filter called \"DAR Adult Electrostatic Filter\" that provided antibacterial and antiviral filtering \u226599,999%. 4 In this way, we were able to position a surgical mask on the filter, which deterred a possible spread of droplets and was psychologically more comfortable to the health care worker by minimizing his contact with the flow of air leaving the reservoir bag (Figure) . We feel that the presence of the surgical mask over the filter Use of a Modified System for Manual Ventilation of the Patient for In-Hospital and Extra-Hospital Transport to Avoid Aerosolizing Spread of Droplets During COVID-19 Outbreak Figure.
