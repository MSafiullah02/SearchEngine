            "text": "The natural antibiotic aspergillic acid contains a cyclic hydroxamic acid functional group in a pyrazine nucleus. Attempts to develop synthetic methods for introducing heterocyclic rings into the hydroxamic acid group present in aspergillic acid led in 1950 to the preparation for N-hydroxy-2-pyridinethione (HPT). The synthesis was achieved by conversion of a 2-pyridyl ether to its N-oxide, followed by dealkylation.13 Reaction of 2-bromopyridine-N-oxide with thiourea forms 2-pyridyl-N-oxide-isothiourea hydrobromide and, followed by treatment with aqueous sodium carbonate, produces N-hydroxy-2-pyridinethione (HPT).14 This compound was shown to have potent antimicrobial properties. In vitro, 1 \u03bcg HPT would inhibit Staphylococcus aureus.15 Thus, this synthetic analog was 30 times more potent as an antimicrobial than the native aspergillic acid. Later, HPT was shown to have extremely potent activity against gram-positive and gram-negative bacterial species as well as strong activity against yeasts and fungi: eg, Aspergillus, Trichophyton species, Candida albicans, and Cryptococcus species.16 Cox, in the mid-1950s, reviewed the uses of pyridine-N-oxides and noted that the mercapto derivatives formed quaternary ammonium compounds or heavy metal salts, which were described as effective fungicides and antibacterial agents and suggested their uses in pharmaceutic preparations.17 As a zinc chelate of HPT, ZPT exists in the monomeric form as 2 pyridine rings bound to a central zinc atom by bonds between the zinc atom and the sulphur and oxygen molecules of the pyridine ring structures.18, 19 ZPT is practically insoluble in water, organic solvents, or surfactants\u2014a property that can be problematical when formulating with the compound.20 The structure of ZPT is presented in\nFig 1.",

When ZPT was applied to intact skin of monkeys with surfactants, the absorption was only 0.20% of the amount applied.28 Concentrations of ZPT in the blood stream following topical application are below the threshold of detection. The absorbed dose would likely be further reduced in humans by the fact that hand skin has a lower permeability than scalp skin.29, 30 ZPT does not induce primary skin irritation or sensitization in human skin.30 Finally, when a 2.0% suspension of ZPT was instilled into the conjunctival sacs of the eyes of 6 albino rabbits, ZPT produced only slight irritation of the conjunctival vessels, which lasted 3 days, but no corneal opacities were observed.31 Ocular toxicity is well known to be associated with other preservative systems such as CHG, and skin irritation and sensitization with iodine and CHG-based products has been documented.10, 32, 33, 34\n",

This significant development was used to demonstrate the in vivo efficacy of ZPT in topical antisepsis applications. The assay determines the ability of the test agent to establish a reservoir in the stratum corneum. Substantive agents that diffuse into the stratum corneum or bind chemically to it will not be readily removed either by loss from the surface or by absorption. The antibacterial effect will therefore last several days. For this assay, 0.5 mL of the test agent is applied with a pipette twice daily for 4 consecutive days to the entire volar forearm. Twenty-four hours after the last application, occlusive dressings are applied. If an antimicrobial effect is demonstrable, the test is repeated, and the posttreatment interval is extended to 72 hours. The geometric means for bacterial counts per square centimeter are determined. For this study, 1.0% ZPT was compared with an equal concentration of CHG. The results of this 8-subject study demonstrated antimicrobial parity at 24 hours; however, at the 72-hour time point, ZPT provided a greater persistent effect than the comparator (ZPT = 120 vs CHG = 87,000 colonies/cm2 recovered). The suppression of the bacterial counts on the forearm 72 hours postapplication for ZPT is significantly greater than for chlorhexidine gluconate.

This test measures the ability of an agent to suppress a dense and flourishing population of organisms. For this study, the forearm is wrapped with several layers of impermeable plastic film and then sealed at the wrist and below the elbow for 24 hours to expand the resident flora. After expansion of the resident flora, 2, 2.5 cm2 areas on each arm are treated with 0.1 mL of the test agent administered by a plastic tuberculin syringe. All sites are immediately covered with a 5.0-cm2 section of impermeable plastic film. Encircling the limb with plastic tape as the final step occlusively seals the site. A strip of 1.25-cm (0.5 in.)-wide, white-backed adhesive tape is placed between each test site to prevent the possibility of translocation of test agents and organisms from 1 site to another. Sites are cultured at 6, 24, and 48 hours, depending on the stability of the test agent. The geometric mean of surviving organisms is determined by standard culture techniques. For the Lynden study reviewed here (\nTable 2), 70% ethanol and 1.0% ZPT were compared in a 10-subject panel. As expected, ethanol induced a prompt, significant reduction in bacterial flora that was still measurable at the 6-hour sample when compared with the untreated control sample. The lack of an equally dramatic antibacterial effect 6 hours postapplication for ZPT suggests that a quick-acting antiseptic, such as alcohol, should be combined with it. In this fashion, the alcohol (which lacks persistence) will produce an immediate bactericidal action, and the ZPT (which lacks a dramatic quick kill) will produce a prolonged suppression of the skin bacterial flora. This concept is supported by the ZPT data obtained at the 24- and 48-hour sample points.",

No transepidermal penetration occurs. The articles provided do not suggest whether the \u201cdissolution\u201d is of the intact ZPT or whether the zinc is first chelated by a separate mechanism, thus leaving the more soluble pyrithione available to penetrate via the follicle. Others46 used ZPT with radioactive sulfur to monitor tissue location so that the pyrithione moiety would be observed. Deposited particles of ZPT appear to adhere firmly to the hair and stratum corneum and to withstand copious rinsing.46 These adherent particles probably act as a reservoir and are responsible for the prolonged antimicrobial effect (persistence). Diminution of the amount of antibacterial effect with time is probably due to a great extent to normal turnover of the stratum corneum. Also, solubilized ZPT would eventually purge and/or break down further. It is pertinent to note that sebum and topical lipids can inactivate many antimicrobials47; examples include hexachlorophene and benzethonium chloride. ZPT is not only soluble in sebum but retains its antimicrobial activity.",

The study compared the efficacy of 70% alcohol preserved with ZPT to a second scrub containing only 4.0% CHG and a third scrub containing only 7.5% iodine. Their data were obtained following 11 scrubs over a 5-day period.1, 4 The requirements for successful performance include log10 reductions from baseline of not less than 1.0 for day 1, 2.0 for day 2, and 3.0 for day 5. The immediacy of kill provided by the alcohol-based product on day 1 was readily demonstrated by the nearly 3.0-log10 reduction from baseline counts. The antimicrobial effect becomes enhanced on days 2 and 5 as a result of the contributions provided in part by the preservative system. At the end of the 5-day test period, the superiority of alcohol preserved with ZPT was readily apparent (4.78-log10 reduction from baseline) when compared with CHG or iodine-based products (3.43- and 1.27-log10 reduction from baseline, respectively) for the same day 5 time point. In a second in vivo study, a different formulation of an alcohol-based, ZPT-preserved, waterless surgical scrub was compared with another waterless, alcohol-based scrub containing 1.0% CHG as a preservative (Avagard, 3M Health Care, St Paul, Minn). As may be observed in\nFig 2, the products performed similarly on days 1 and 2 (alcohol/ZPT log10 reductions from baseline = 2.32 and 3.07, respectively; alcohol/CHG log10 reductions from baseline = 2.08 and 2.87, respectively). However, by day 5, the antimicrobial efficacy of the alcohol/ZPT product was notably better (log10 reduction from baseline = 3.68) than that of the alcohol/CHG product (log10 reduction from baseline = 3.09) because the ZPT-preserved formulation more readily exceeded the 3.0-log10 reduction required for the surgical scrub indication.4 In a separate in vivo study, the cosmetic and skin-conditioning properties of the 2 waterless formulations were judged to be equal (personal communication, Dr. Ronald Rizer; manuscript submitted for publication to AORN Journal).",

These agents represent both RNA and DNA viruses, some with envelopes and others without. The HAV and the human rotavirus represent 2 nonenveloped RNA agents (one linear single-stranded, the other segmented double stranded) that are relatively resistant to known antimicrobials. Using standard virologic techniques, the viral agents were cultured in cell lines appropriate for propagation (see\nTable 3) to levels at or above the required titer of 106.00 infectious units/mL. The viruses were then harvested and exposed for 3 minutes (30 seconds for the human coronavirus) to the test formulation diluted by virus inoculum to a 90% concentration. Following exposure to the test product, the residual infectious viral population was determined for each virus, employing techniques appropriate for that virus. All testing was performed per American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) method E 1052-96, a Standard Test Method for Efficacy of Antimicrobial Agents Against Viruses in Suspension.50 The results of this effort are summarized in Table 3. The test criterion for classification as a virucide is not less than a 3.0-log10 reduction in the postexposure virus population, beyond any observed cytotoxicity. Exposure to the product produced a 3- to 4-log10 reduction in all virus populations tested, thereby meeting or exceeding the standard for classification as a virucide.",

The combination of an alcohol-based, ZPT-preserved, preoperative shower solution and a similarly formulated patient preoperative skin preparation was compared with an iodine-based system (7.5% scrub and 10.0% PVPI paint) using identical application schedules in a well-controlled, human in vivo study. For this study, the subjects refrained from the use of any antimicrobial products for 2 weeks to allow for stabilization of the normal skin flora. Pretreatment cultures were obtained of the selected sites (groin) to obtain \u201cbaseline\u201d of skin flora, to which posttreatment data could be compared and log10 reduction values calculated. The subjects then washed with the preoperative shower products at T = \u221212 and T = \u22126 hours. The preoperative surgical site preparations were applied at T = 0, and samples were collected at 10 minutes and from 6 hours out to 72 hours postapplication of the surgical site preparation. The alcohol-based products demonstrated superior efficacy at nearly every time point. At 72 hours (3 days) following the last product application, the alcohol-based, ZPT-preserved system continued to provide significant antimicrobial action as documented by a 2.0-log10 or a 99.0% reduction in the colony-forming units present at baseline. This compares with a <0.50-log10 reduction for the same time point with the iodine-based products. The extended period of antimicrobial persistence that is associated with the ZPT-preserved, alcohol-based system would allow for skin closure in a prolonged state of antisepsis and could result in a lower incidence of surgical site infections.",

In conclusion, ZPT is a safe and effective antimicrobial suitable for use as a preservative system with alcohol formulations. The data confirm that ZPT contributes positively toward the overall antimicrobial efficacy of alcohol-based products in which it is used. Additional studies would prove useful in verifying the clinical relevance of this observation. Finally, it is likely that additional uses for this antimicrobial will be found as we continue the struggle with ever increasing resistance to current antibiotics and antimicrobials.",
