In addition, Tan Tock Seng Hospital (TTSH) was officially designated as the hospital to manage SARS on 22 March 2003, and strict infection control measures were imposed on all hospitals. Schools and other public places were closed where necessary to halt the transmission of the virus (Singapore Ministry of Health, 2003). During the initial stages of the epidemic, public communication was effected mainly through press conferences, media coverage and a website set up by the Ministry of Health. Prominent press and radio advertisements were also placed in the early phase of the epidemic from mid April 2003. As more became known about the infection, and with control measures being put in place, an intensive public education campaign utilizing multiple channels was mounted between 30 April and 13 May 2003. This public education campaign aimed to educate Singapore residents about SARS, to encourage them to adopt appropriate personal hygiene and socially responsible habits to prevent the spread of SARS, to encourage those with suspected SARS infection to seek medical attention at TTSH, and to encourage cooperation with contact tracing and home quarantine orders (HQO) when necessary.",

A total of 863 adults aged 19\u201369 years were interviewed. There was an over sampling of Indians and Malays to ensure that there were enough subjects from the three major ethnic groups (of which Chinese form the majority) in Singapore (distribution in the general population for Chinese, Malays and Indians is about 76.8, 13.9 and 7.9%, respectively). The results were weighted to reflect the actual distribution in the population during analysis.

Information would be pursued and processed until perceived knowledge reaches the sufficiency threshold, which would represent the point at which the individual is confident that he or she can cope behaviourally with the risk (e.g. take effective preventive action). However, people might avoid risk content if, for example, it produces worries with which they cannot cope. Some may not pay attention or simply avoid such information all together. This might explain why while basic knowledge about SARS (e.g. awareness that fever is a symptom of SARS) was high, the overall knowledge score remained low in the study as most Singaporeans may feel that basic knowledge about SARS allows them to cope adequately with the crisis at a personal behavioural level.",

The fear of SARS was widespread, causing stress and anxiety wherever it struck (Clark, 2003; Cong et al., 2003; Falsey and Walsh, 2003; Lee et al., 2003; Wenzel and Edmond, 2003).

Researchers have identified social trust as a key mediating factor in circumstances requiring collective action (Slovic, 1992; Earle and Cvetkovich, 1994). Social trust serves as a cognitive heuristic tool that decreases the complexities of social life to workable levels. When people face threatening events or conditions, they often make risk judgements based on social trust, an expectation that assigns to others the responsibility for working on some necessary task (Slovic, 1992; Earle and Cvetkovich, 1994). It was clear that social trust was rampant during the SARS crisis in Singapore. Singapore has sometimes been described as having a communitarian ideology (Chua, 1995). State interventions in social life are often viewed as pre-emptive measures for ensuring the collective well-being or as measures of good government. During the SARS crisis, the government actively promoted public confidence in the ability of TTSH to cope with SARS. Several leaders of the country shared their personal views about SARS and expressed confidence in the ability of the hospital to handle the crisis. The \u2018social norm\u2019 (Fishbern and Ajzen, 1975; Ajzen and Fishbein, 1980) of accepting TTSH as being capable of dealing with SARS was further enforced when individuals who did not admit themselves into the hospital when suspected of SARS were publicly criticised.",

Given the situation that little was known about SARS and that there was constant appeal for people to live life as normally as possible, people tried to manage their lives by reducing complexities through increased social trust, which also implied an expectation on the government to take over the responsibility for fighting SARS. Consequently, they developed high confidence in the measures undertaken by the government, despite having a low level of knowledge about SARS.",

This is no doubt mediated by the high perceived hazard associated with SARS and the high social trust ascribed to the government. Taken together, these concepts help to explain the apparent disparity between the low knowledge about SARS and the control measures on the one hand, and high confidence in key institutions dealing with SARS, high endorsement about SARS control measures being appropriate and high satisfaction with the government's response to SARS on the other hand.",

While public compliance may be high, it may not necessarily translate to private conviction and conversion about the importance of adopting appropriate preventive measures. However, even though private conversion may be the best societal control in the long-term, high-risk situations require quick short-term measures (Asch, 1955; Moscovici, 1985), and those taken for SARS were effective and appropriate for Singapore. Taking into consideration the cultural and societal background, instilling public compliance seemed to be an efficient tool of helping to cope with the immediate SARS crisis. Moving forward, it is important that future educational efforts promote private conversion and personal responsibility, utilising veracious and creative messages and taking into consideration different situations within the social and cultural context.",
