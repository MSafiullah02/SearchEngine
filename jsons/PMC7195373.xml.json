Our department includes 187 faculty, 72 residents and 21 fellows covering 6 hospital sites with over 3,000 inpatient beds. All of our sites have seen an influx of COVID patients, including Bellevue hospital which is the flagship hospital for the New York City public hospital system. Our institution has been proactive regarding implementation of COVID protocols and our administration has had open lines of communication with staff which has helped to minimize some of the confusion reported at other hospital systems. Personalized protective equipment (PPE) has been readily available with conservation strategies that involve some restrictions on duration of usage, but are in accordance with CDC guidelines. Administrators have sent frequent video updates from inside hospital facilities which serve to let the staff know that they are in the fight with them, and that their efforts are greatly appreciated. Our leadership has been transparent with data by openly sharing the number of emergency department (ED) visits, admissions, inpatient census, intubated patients, discharges and deaths related to COVID. This transparency at all levels has helped remove some of the fear of the unknown for our staff.",

The exact definition was not specified, but the guidance put out by NYU defined elective surgery as \u201ca surgical procedure that the physician and patient believe can safely be postponed for at least three months.\u201d Each department, was then asked to create a list of procedures that would be permitted under these guidelines. Within our department each division formulated a detailed list of essential surgical procedures. The cases that were initially deemed as non-elective within the Division of Adult Reconstructive Surgery are summarized below:\u2022Periprosthetic joint infections\u2022Periprosthetic fractures\u2022Acute post-operative dislocation due to implant malposition\u2022Recurrent instability causing disability\u2022Implant fracture/failure\u2022Total hip replacement for intractable hip pain secondary to femoral head collapse or fracture\u2022Disabling hip or knee pain that impairs mobility to a degree that places the patient at risk for additional problems such as recurrent falls, or the ability to be in self quarantine.\n",

To date, we have been able to perform all required urgent and emergent surgeries without any substantial delays. The patients that we have been able to treat during this time have been extremely grateful for our ability to provide care.

For example, our department maintained two free standing ambulatory surgery centers. Not only were the staff at these centers repurposed, but so was the equipment. The ASC\u2019s represented a total of 11 operating rooms. The anesthesia machines were removed from the ORs and sent to the main campus to be used as ventilators. Additionally, all of the hospital floors of LOH were reconfigured to accept up to 110 lower acuity COVID patients from our other front-line institutions (Tisch Hospital/Kimmel Pavilion, NYU Brooklyn and NYU Winthrop). We formed medical teams consisting of hospitalists, orthopedic surgeons and advanced practice professionals (APPs -nurse practitioners and physician assistants) to provide 24/7 coverage of these patients using 12-hour shifts. This included advanced practice professionals from our operating room, surgery centers and private practices. Our operating room and PACU nurses, and surgical technologists were also redeployed to the converted medical COVID floors treating patients. Each medical team consisted of one hospitalist, two orthopedic surgeons and two APPs, caring for 20-30 COVID patients per shift. A multi-disciplinary leadership group worked to develop the structure and work flow of the medical teams to help clarify roles and ensure maximum safety for both patients and staff and efficiency for the teams. Selected APPs were trained in PICC line placement, to assist due to decreased availability of the radiology PICC Line teams. Proning teams to help care for ventilated patients were also created and deployed. All personnel received updated training, including PPE training, through our online training system.",

Of our orthopedic residents and fellows (all of our adult reconstruction fellows are involved in some fashion in COVID care teams), we currently have 33 trainees participating in COVID care teams across our health system on a 4-week rotating basis. All of our orthopedic surgery trainees were given the choice of working on a medicine team, ICU team, or in the emergency department. The majority electing to work on the medicine floors with some deployed to ICU and ED coverage.

Some have promoted the idea that an antibody test may be the best way to screen hospital staff and patients for immunity to COVID-19. Antibody testing will likely play an important role in understanding the epidemiology of this disease, however, there are a number of concerns with antibody testing that may prevent its use as a litmus test for people to resume their individual lives. Questions that must be addressed regarding antibody testing include the true sensitivity and specificity, cross reactivity with other human coronavirus antibodies, and whether these antibodies confer long term humoral immunity against COVID-19. Our best chance at minimizing the long-term impact of COVID-19 lies with the development of a vaccine, but widespread vaccination programs are likely a minimum of 12 months away.",

Once elective surgery does resume, it is anticipated that all patients will be tested for COVID with a rapid result test preoperatively just as we expect all staff to be tested before returning to our \u201cnormal\u201d schedules. Staff must be diligent with mask use as well as hand hygiene. As the stress on our healthcare system diminishes, we must be able to provide an environment where patients feel safe walking in the door to the hospital and that they are not at any higher risk of exposure to COVID.
