            "text": "The genus Sambucus L. (elderberry) belongs to the Adoxaceae family, which consists of 7 different genera that have berry fruit (NRCS Natural Resources Conservation Service, 2016a). Sambucus L. consist of 5\u201330 species and 6\u201311 subspecies, depending on the taxonomy system (NPGS, 2016, NRCS, 2016b). The most commonly occurring species is Sambucus nigra L. Its common names include elder, elderberry, black elder, European elder, European elderberry and European black elderberry (ITIS, 2016). Sambucus nigra L. has three subspecies: S. nigra L. ssp. nigra, S. nigra L. ssp. canadensis, S. nigra L. ssp. cerulea. The two latter ones, which were in the past considered separate species, are native to North America. European black elderberry naturally occurs in most of Europe (except for certain parts of Scandinavia and Russia) and in North Africa (the Atlas Mountains of Algeria, Morocco and Tunisia). In the east of Europe, the plant\u2019s distribution ends on approximately 55\u00b0E. The altitude limit depends on the latitude (e.g. 900 m a.s.l. in the Tatra Mountains and 2200 a.s.l. in the Atlas Mountains). Sambucus nigra L. ssp. nigra has been introduced into various parts of the world including E. Asia, N. America, New Zealand and the southern part of Australia (Hult\u00e9n & Fries, 1986).",

Below 7.2 \u00b0C seeds are unable to mature (Lennon & Turner, 1995), and the maximum mean temperature in which seed maturation is possible is 15 \u00b0C, as is the case in South Europe (Atkinson & Atkinson, 2002). Sambucus nigra L. usually grows in open fields or at woodland edges. It sometimes occurs under deep shade in woodland but such bushes are often survivors of former more open conditions. In Central Europe elder is commonly found in woodlands of various mixtures of willow, poplar, elm and oak (Ellenberg, 1988). Black elderberry favours disturbed, base-rich and nitrogen-rich soils, and phosphate-rich soils. High levels of available phosphate and potassium and of mineralizable nitrogen were observed in a series of soils from S. nigra sites (Atkinson & Atkinson, 2002). Nevertheless, despite its preferred natural environment, elderberry can be grown on a wide variety of soils (Charlebois, Byers, Finn, & Thomas, 2010).",

In many countries, large quantities of raw material are collected from wild plants. However, since the beginning of 1980s, black elderberry has been planted and grown on experimental and commercial plots in some European countries and in the USA, Canada, New Zealand and Chile (Finn, Thomas, Byers, & Kemal, 2008). In Central Europe, the most popular cultivars are 'Alleso', 'Korsor' \u2018Samyl\u2019, \u2019Sampo\u2019, all of them bred in Denmark. Total fruit production as compared to other berry crops is rather small and, therefore, the relevant statistical data are scarce or incomplete. The biggest producers are Germany (H\u00f6hne, 2014), Denmark (Kaack, Frett\u00e9, Christensen, Landbo, & Meyer, 2008), Poland (Wa\u017abi\u0144ska & Puczel, 2002), Italy (Mohebalian, Cernusca, & Aguilar, 2012), Austria and the Czech Republic (V\u00edtov\u00e1, Divi\u0161ov\u00e1, S\u016fkalov\u00e1, & Mat\u011bj\u00ed\u010dek, 2013).

However, in the USA, the most commonly grown are hybrids between S. nigra ssp. nigra and ssp. canadensis. Breeders at the Experiment Station in Geneva (Cornell University) discovered that such hybrids are resistant to viruses spread in elderberry plantations by nematodes (Way, 1981). Elderberries are planted in single rows. The distance between bushes in the row is between 1.5 and 2.5 m (Kaack, 1984). Well developed bushes require a spacing of 2\u20132.5 meters increased by the width of machines (Roper & McManus, 1998). The recommended maximum density of elderberry bushes is approximately 1200 bushes/ha (Charlebois et al., 2010).",

The yield depends on the growing site, growing condition, planting distance and cultivar, and can vary from 1.3 kg/bush for wild-harvested genotypes to 23.0 kg/bush for some cultivars (Kaack, 1984, Kollanyi et al., 2005, Wa\u017abi\u0144ska et al., 2004). Elderberry flowering cymes harvested for fresh use or drying are clipped when all flowers are open. Individual flowers are easily removed from the cyme by rubbing over screens. The flowers may then be dried or frozen for future use (Byers, Thomas, & Gold, 2014).",

Carbohydrates found in Sambucus nigra fruit also include dietary fibre, in particular, pectin, pectic acid, protopectin, Ca-pectate and cellulose. Elderberry is a source of whole protein \u2013 its content is 2.7\u20132.9% in berries, 2.5% in flowers and 3.3% in leaves.

Glutamic acid, aspargic acid and alanine were reported as the dominant amino acids. Fats are accumulated mostly in elderberry seeds (fat content: 22.4%) and seed flour (fat content: 15.9%). The major fatty acids are polyunsaturated fatty acids, which constitute 75.15% and 21.54% of total fatty acids in seeds and seed flour, respectively, whereas monounsaturated fatty acids (14.21% and 4.21%) and saturated fatty acids (10.64% and 4.81%) make up a significantly smaller share. Polyunsaturated fatty acids that are present in highest concentrations in seeds are \u03b1-linolenic, linoleic and oleic acid. Organic acids constitute 1.0\u20131.3% of the berry content. Veberic et al. detected four organic acids in elderberry fruit. The most abundant of them was citric acid (3.08\u20134.81 g/kg FW), whose contents was quite high in comparison to other fruits. The next one was malic acid (0.97\u20131.31 g/kg FW) and the remaining two acids were shikimic acid (0.14\u20130.93 g/kg FW) and fumaric acid (0.10\u20130.29 g/kg FW). Minerals are located both in berries and flowers. The mineral matter content represents 0.90\u20131.55% of the fruit mass, and includes K (2953\u20135494 mg/kg FW), P (735\u20131337), Ca (574\u20131528), Na (13\u2013146), Mg (396\u2013739), Fe (12.4\u201384.7), Zn (1.9\u201311.3), Mn (3.6\u20139.5), Cu (1.7\u20132.9). Additionally, berries contain also heavy metals such as lead (0.016\u20130.098 mg/kg FW) and cadmium (0.039\u20130.053), as well as nitrates (V) (2.63\u20133.21 mg/kg FW) and nitrates (III) (0.69\u20130.86) (Akbulut et al., 2009, Borowska et al., 2000, Divi\u0161 et al., 2015, Dulf et al., 2013, Fazio et al., 2013, Kislichenko and Vel\u2019ma, 2006, Ko\u0142odziej et al., 2012, Mratini\u0107 and Fotiri\u0107, 2007, Ognik et al., 2006, Veberic et al., 2009, Vuli\u0107 et al., 2008). Elderberry fruit and flowers also include essential oils (around 0.01% in fruit), consisting of approx. 53 compounds in berries and 58 compounds in flowers (Kaack, 2008, Kaack and Christensen, 2008).",

The highest content of this vitamin was found in \u2018Mammut\u2019 and the lowest\u2013in \u2018Sambu\u2019 and \u2018Haschberg\u2019 (Kaack & Austed, 1998).

Furthermore, elderberry contains m-hydroxysubstituted glycosides, such as zierin and holocalin (DellaGreca et al., 2000, Jensen and Nielsen, 1973). These compounds are potentially toxic and life-threatening, because they can be hydrolysed resulting in the release of cyanide (Bromley, Hughes, Leong, & Buckley, 2005). However, they occur primarily in unripe berries and are degraded during heat treatment (Williamson, Driver, & Baxter, 2009). The highest amounts of sambunigrin are present in elder leaves (27.68\u2013209.61 \u00b5g/g FW), lower amounts were found in flowers (1.23\u201318.88 \u00b5g/g FW), whereas berries contain the lowest amounts of this compound (0.08\u20130.77 \u00b5g/g FW). It was also found that the content of sambunigrin in elderberry changes depending on the growing altitude. The highest content of sambunigrin was recorded on a hilltop (1048 and 1077 m a.s.l.), which had lower temperatures and higher solar radiation as compared to other altitudes studied (209\u2013858 m a.s.l.) (Senica, Stampar, Veberic, & Mikulic-Petkovsek, 2016). Other toxic compounds present in elderberry are lectins sharing a high amino acids sequence homology and some of them having the N-glycosidase activity, which is typical for type II ribosome-inactivating proteins (RIPs). Type II RIPs occur in elderberry bark (e.g. nigrin b-SNA V, SNA I), fruit (nigrin f) and seeds (nigrin s) (Stripe, 2004, Tejero et al., 2015). Moreover, elderberry contains the allergen Sam n1, which causes type 1 allergy and some tryptic peptides of Sam n1 demonstrate a high amino acid sequence with lectins and type 2 RIPs located in Sambucus (F\u00f6rster-Waldl et al., 2003, Jim\u00e9nez et al., 2013, Jimenez et al., 2013). However, it was discovered that incubation in a boiling water bath for 5\u201310 min, made lectins completely sensitive to hydrolytic enzymes in vitro and thus reduced the risk of allergenicity (Jim\u00e9nez et al., 2017).",

The fruit of Sambucus nigra is an important source of phenolic compounds \u2013 their content in the elderberries is relatively high in comparison to other fruits (Leja, Mareczek, & Nanaszko, 2007). The main polyphenols in elderberry fruit are chlorogenic acid, neochlorogenic acid, cryptochlorogenic acid, quercetin, quercetin-3-rutinoside (rutin), quercetin-3-glucoside (isoquercitrin), kaempferol-3-rutinoside, kaempferol-3-glucoside (astragaline), isorhamnetin-3-rutinoside and isorhamnetin-3-glucoside. The primary flavonol in this plant is rutin, while the other flavonols, isoquercitrin and astragaline occur in elderberries in smaller amounts (Dawidowicz et al., 2006, Kaack and Austed, 1998, Kaack et al., 2008, Lee and Finn, 2007, Pietta and Bruno, 1992, Veberic et al., 2009). The concentration of quercetin measured in the fruit of thirteen elderberry cultivars ranged from 29 (\u2018Gentofte\u2019) to 60 mg/100 g (\u2018Haschberg\u2019) of fruit (Kaack & Austed, 1998). Furthermore, Sambucus nigra berries contain small amounts of tannins with a low condensation degree. These are procyanidins, such as epicatechin (88.4% of total tannins) and catechin (11.6% of total tannins) and their thiol derivatives (Oszmia\u0144ski & Moutounet, 1995).",

            "text": "Elderberry is a very rich source of anthocyanins in comparison to other fruits. The fruit of Sambucus nigra contains anthocyanins, especially cyanidin-3-glucoside and cyanidin-3-sambubioside. Two other (minor) anthocyanins are cyanidin-3,5-diglucoside, and cyanidin-3-sambubioside-5-glucoside. In addition, trace quantities of cyanidin-3-rutinoside, pelargonidin-3-glucoside and delphinidin-3-rutinoside were identified in the fruit of certain elderberry cultivars. Their content depends on cultivar/variety, ripening stage, growing season or kind and method of extraction (Borowska et al., 2000, Duymu\u015f et al., 2014, Fiorini, 1995, Kaack, 1997, Kaack and Austed, 1998, Kaack et al., 2008, Lee and Finn, 2007, Leja et al., 2007, Pliszka et al., 2005, Seabra et al., 2010, Veberic et al., 2009, Youdim et al., 2000). The cultivars most abundant in anthocyanins are \u2018Mammut\u2019, \u2018Samdal\u2019, \u2018Sampo\u2019 and \u2018Samyl\u2019, while \u2018Finn Sam\u2019, \u2018Haschberg\u2019, \u2018Allesoe\u2019, but also wild elderberry have the lowest quantities of these bioactive compounds. Total anthocyanin content varies almost threefold depending on the cultivar, e.g. \u2018Haschberg\u2019 was found to contain 664 mg of total anthocyanins/100 g, while the concentration of these compounds in \u2018Sampo\u2019 was 1816 mg/100 g. (Kaack, 1997, Kaack and Austed, 1998, Pliszka et al., 2005). The polyphenol content changes at different stages of fruit ripening, and each compound shows its own individual change pattern during this process. The content of anthocyanins, especially cyanidin-3-sambubioside-5-glucoside, cyanidin-3-sambubioside and cyanidin-3-glucoside, usually increases as berries ripen (Kaack et al., 2008). The content of polyphenols and anthocyanins is also dependent on the growing season. Lee and Finn (2007) found that the total anthocyanin content in the fruit of \u2018Kors\u00f8r\u2019 in 2005 was almost twice higher (343 mg of cyanidin-3-glucoside/100 g) than in 2004 (176 mg of cyanidin-3-glucoside/100 g). Total phenolic content was also much higher in 2005 (510 and 582 mg of gallic acid/100 g) than in 2004 (364 and 387 mg of gallic acid/100 g), respectively, for \u2018Haschberg\u2019 and \u2018Kors\u00f8r\u2019. The same applied to individual anthocyanins and almost all investigated polyphenols in the berries of both cultivars. The predominant anthocyanin found in elderberry juice concentrate or must is cyanidin-3-sambubioside, while cyanidin-3-glucoside was found to be the most abundant anthocyanin in elderberry wine (Berm\u00fadez-Soto and Thom\u00e1s-Barber\u00e1n, 2004, Schmitzer et al., 2010) and in the fruit of thirteen elderberry cultivars except \u2018Alles\u00f8e\u2019 (Kaack & Austed 1998).",

The main group of phenolic compounds found in elderflowers are hydroxycinnamic acids, the most important of which is chlorogenic acid. Other hydroxycinnamic acids present in elderflowers include, among others, neochlorogenic acid, cryptochlorogenic acid, 3- and 5-feruloylquinic acid, and dicaffeoylquinic acids, including notably 1,5-Di-caffeoylquinic acid. The second important group of polyphenols comprise flavonols, from which several glycosides of quercetin, kaempferol and isorhamnetin were detected in elderflower extracts. The major polyphenol from this group is quercetin-3-rutinoside (rutin). This flavonol together with kaempferol-3-rutinoside and isorhamnetin-3-rutinoside constitute more than 90% of total flavonoids in most analysed genotypes. Other groups of phenolic compounds occurring in elderflowers are flavanols, which include catechin, epicatechin and procyanidin trimer, and flavanones, e.g. naringenin. Elderflowers contain more of certain phenolic compounds (rutin, isoquercitrin and astragaline) than berries or leaves (Christensen et al., 2008, Dawidowicz et al., 2006, Mikulic-Petkovsek et al., 2015). The content of phenolic compounds in elderflowers, similarly to elderberries, depends on the genotype as well as on liquid composition and extraction conditions. For instance, the highest content of chlorogenic acid was found in the Virum genotype (20.7 mg/g DW), while the lowest in the Sambu genotype (10.1 mg/g DW). On the other hand, the Samocco genotype was shown to have the highest (42.3 mg/g DW) whereas the Jaegerspris genotype the lowest (11.6 mg/g DW) concentration of rutin (Christensen et al., 2008). Moreover, the highest content of flavonols in elderflowers was a result of higher temperature of extraction \u2013 214.25 and 139.32 g/100 g extr. for 100 \u00b0C and 20 \u00b0C, respectively (Dawidowicz et al. 2006).",

As for TEAC values (ABTS radical scavenging activity), these ranged from 0.89 (acidified methanol extract) to 1.96 mmol Trolox equiv./l (70% acetone extract) and the highest value was almost the same as for ascorbic acid (1.97 mM). Additionally, the TEAC value for cyanidin-3-glucoside standard was nearly the same as for water extract (1.87 and 1.85 mM, respectively). Elderberries are also able to inhibit the linoleic acid oxidation. The highest inhibition rate (58%) was observed for 70% ethanol extract; however, none of the analysed elderberry extracts was as active as BHT control (Duymu\u015f et al., 2014). A commercial concentrate of elderberry fruit demonstrated lower radical scavenger capacity towards DPPH compared to other studied sources of anthocyanins (extracts of fresh chokeberries, blackthorn fruit and strawberries) and natural and synthetic antioxidants (\u03b1-tocopherol, BHT and BHA) (Espin et al., 2000).",

In another study, elderflowers exhibited stronger DPPH radical inhibition activity (91.95\u201394.15%) in comparison to berries (50.25\u201367.69%) and leaves (16.76\u201348.52%). These values also depended on the temperature of alcoholic extraction\u2013in each case, extraction at a temperature of 100 \u00b0C resulted in a higher percentage rate of free radical inhibition than extraction at a lower temperature (20 \u00b0C) (Dawidowicz et al., 2006, Ko\u0142odziej and Dro\u017cd\u017cal, 2011). The results obtained by Stoilova et al. demonstrate that the extract of elderflowers possess greater radical scavenging properties in comparison to rutin, BHT and BHA used as standards. Elderflower extract showed the highest inhibition of DPPH (97.70%) at the lowest concentration (10 \u00b5g/ml) in comparison with the standards (77.47; 82.40; 89.98% and 40; 20; 20 \u00b5g/ml, respectively) and the IC50 concentration of S. nigra extract for the inhibition was the lowest (0.152 \u00b5g/ml) compared to IC50 of rutin, BHT and BHA (14.65; 4.407; 1.120 \u00b5g/ml, respectively). In addition, this extract eliminated the highly reactive hydroxyl radicals, thus preventing the deoxyribose degradation, more effectively as compared to rutin and quercetin (IC50 = 0.0122; 0.505; 4.61 \u00b5g/ml, for elderflower, rutin and quercetin extracts, respectively).

            "text": "In a study which investigated the metabolism of various anthocyanins after oral administration of elderberry juice, small amounts of Sambucus nigra anthocyanins were identified in human urine. Seven volunteers took 4 g of spray-dried elderberry juice, corresponding to 50 ml of fresh juice and containing 500 mg of anthocyanins (12.5%). Several peaks appeared in the chromatogram and two of them had the same retention time as the major cyanidin-3-glucoside and cyanidin-3-sambubioside from juice. Only 0.04% of the consumed cyanidin-3-sambubioside and 0.01% of cyanidin-3-glucoside were excreted into urine and the highest excretion of anthocyanins was noted 3\u20134 h after the intake of elderberry juice. Even lower amounts of unmetabolized cyanidin-3,5-diglucoside and cyanidin-3-sambubioside-5-gluside were identified in a few samples; however, other substances shown in the chromatogram that were possible metabolites of Sambucus nigra anthocyanins were not identified (Murkovic, M\u00fclleder, Adam, & Pfannhauser, 2001). According to another study concerning the absorption of anthocyanins, these antioxidants are ingested by humans in their original, unchanged glycosylated forms. The content of anthocyanins in blood plasma and urine was analysed in four women treated with 12 mg of elderberry extract, containing 720 mg anthocyanins consisting mainly of cyanidin-3-sambubioside and cyanidin-3-glucoside. The blood plasma samples, which were collected before and between 10 min and 24 h after the consumption of the extract exhibited at least five additional anthocyanin-like compounds, primarily cyanidin-3-sambubioside and cyanidin-3-glucoside. The levels of all detected compounds decreased after 1 h, disappearing after 24 h. Their maximum concentration in blood plasma was reached within 72 min after the intake, and its average value was 97.4 nmol/l of total anthocyanins. In the urine samples, collected before and between 0 and 24 h after the intake, at least six compounds were detected at 520 nm after extract consumption, and the major anthocyanins were also cyanidin-3-sambubioside and cyanidin-3-glucoside. Most anthocyanin-like compounds appeared in urinary excretion during the first 4 h. The total amount of the anthocyanins excreted during 24 h after the intake of the elderberry extract was 397.0 \u00b5g of cyanidin-3-glucoside equivalents, while the average excretion rate of these compounds during the first 4 h was 77.2 \u00b5g/h and during the second 4 h\u201313.4 \u00b5g/h (Milbury, Cao, Prior, & Blumberg, 2002). In a study by Bitsch et al., cyanidin glucosides and glucuronides were detected in urinary excretion. Seven healthy volunteers consumed 150 mL of elderberry juice concentrate which contained 3.57 g of total anthocyanins. Within 5 h after the ingestion of the juice dose, the urinary excretion of total cyanidin glucosides (cyanidin-3,5-diglucoside, cyanidin-3-sambubioside, cyanidin-3-glucoside) and their glucuronide conjugates was 1.876 mg of cyanidin-3,5-diglucoside, which constituted 0.053% of the administered dose. The percentage of the excreted glucuronides was only 0.003%, while the share of the glucuronides in relation to all excreted anthocyanins was 6.2%. The maximum excretion rate of anthocyanins was reached after one hour of intake, followed by a sharp drop (Bitsch et al., 2004). In another study, the urinary excretion, the plasma concentration of elderberry anthocyanins as well as other antioxidant parameters were determined. Eight participants received doses of elderberry juice (200, 300 and 400 ml) in separate treatments. The total anthocyanin content, including cyanidin-3-sambubioside and cyanidin-3-glucoside, in urinary excretion increased with the increase in the juice dose taken. The lowest elderberry juice dose (200 ml), which contained 361 mg of total anthocyanins, caused the excretion of, on average, 41.4 \u00b5g/h of anthocyanins, while after the highest dose (400 ml) containing 722 mg of total anthocyanins, the average urinary excretion of these compounds was 113.2 \u00b5g/h. Within 7 h, the values of the fraction of orally ingested total anthocyanins in urinary excretion were 0.033, 0.038 and 0.040% after the intake of 200, 300 and 400 ml of juice, respectively. The aim of the second treatment was to investigate the effect of the intake of 400 ml elderberry juice or water (control) on the content and antioxidant capacity of total phenolics and anthocyanins and of ascorbic and uric acid in blood plasma. Both the content and the antioxidant activity of total phenolics and anthocyanins increased after juice ingestion, reaching the highest level 1 h after the intake, whereas the values of these parameters did not change in the control group. At the same time, the concentrations of ascorbic and uric acid were unaffected by the elderberry juice or water intake (Netzel et al., 2005). Czank et al. found that the bioavailability of anthocyanins was higher and the diversity of their metabolites was greater than previously thought. Eight healthy male participants received 500 mg bolus dose of isotopically labelled cyanidin-3-glucoside (6,8,10,3\u2032,5\u2032-13C5-cyanidin-3-glucoside) and their samples of blood, urine, breath and faeces were examined within 48 h after the ingestion. The average recovery of 13C in breath, urine and faeces was 43.9% and the relative bioavailability from urine and breath was 12.38%. The 13C labelled metabolites consisted of 24 compounds and included phase II conjugates of C3G and cyanidin, degradants, phase II conjugates of protocatechuic acid, phenylacetic acids, phenylpropenoic acids and hippuric acid. The metabolites reached a 42-fold peak of serum concentration relative to 13C5-C3G, and were detected much later than the parent anthocyanin (Czank et al., 2013). The results of the above-mentioned studies on the bioavailability of elderberry antioxidants are summarized in Table 2\n.",

            "text": "Flowers and berries of Sambucus nigra are known as a traditional remedy for various kinds of ailments and diseases and both are commonly used in folk medicine (Kohlm\u00fcnzer, 1998). They are primarily used to treat common symptoms related to cold, feverish conditions, coughing, nasal congestion, mucous discharge and influenza, as well as a preventively to strengthen the immune system (Elliman, 1994, Grieve, 1971, Hoffmann, 1990, The ABC Clinical Guide to Elder Berry, 2003). Due to the presence of flavonoids, elderflowers demonstrate primarily diaphoretic, antipyretic and diuretic properties. They obturate the capillary walls, improve their flexibility and prevent infiltration of red blood cells and plasma outside the vessels thanks to the content of compounds (rutin) having the properties of vitamin P. Moreover, elderflowers show anti-inflammatory and antibacterial properties and therefore are used for gargling to treat sore throats or as compresses to treat conjunctivitis. They are most often used as infusions of dried flowers for internal or external application. The fruit of Sambucus nigra, similarly to flowers, exhibits diaphoretic, antipyretic and diuretic properties, but apart from that it act as a laxative and detoxifier, hence elderberries are often a component of herbal mixtures used as a remedy for constipation or to help slimming. In addition, elder fruit demonstrates a moderate analgesic effect and can be used as an adjuvant painkiller against migraine, sciatica and neuralgic pains (Beaux et al., 1999, Bown, 1995, Grieve, 1984, O\u017carowski and Jaroniewski, 1987, Schmersahl, 1964). Not only elder flowers and berries are beneficial to health, but also bark, root, stem and leaves of Sambucus nigra have been used especially by the rural population as medicine or food. For instance, elder bark has been known for its diuretic and slimming properties, while elder leaves may help strengthen resistance to infectious diseases (Baytop, 1984, W\u00f3jcik, 2002). Nowadays remedies against cold, flu and other infectious illnesses are being developed using Sambucus nigra fruit or flowers. They are used as components of dietary supplements in the form of syrups, drops, tablets, capsules, lozenges, aerosols, emulsions or suspensions. Frequently reported in the literature is the antiviral activity of Sambucus nigra fruit. A very popular supplement with such properties that is sold as a prophylactic agent in many countries is the Sambucol preparation, patented in Israel by Dr. Madeleine Mumcuoglu (Kinoshita et al., 2012, Martens, 2008, Wierzbicki, 2002, Zakay-Rones et al., 2004). The healing properties of elderberry are mostly associated with the presence of phenolic compounds, which are characterized by a strong antioxidant activity and therefore are able to eliminate free radicals and counteract the oxidative stress, a factor causing the degradation of the human body, thus contributing to the development of a number of diseases (Gollucke, Peres, Odair, & Ribeiro, 2013). Thole et al. used mass spectrometry and liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry to demonstrate the chemopreventive potential of elderberry. It was found that elderberry fruit extract, or rather an extract fraction that in addition to the phenolic compounds included e.g. iridoid monoterpene glycosides, phytosterols and sesquiterpenes, caused a strong induction of quinone reductase and inhibition of cyclooxygenase-2. This indicates antitumor activity of Sambucus nigra fruit, especially that preventing the initiation and promotion of cancerogenesis stages (Thole et al., 2006). The results of the studies on the health-promoting properties of elderberry are shown in Table 3\n(in vitro) and in Table 4\n(in vivo).",

Despite a 100-fold dilution, ethanol extracts of both elder flowers and berries exhibited inhibitory activity for most of the analysed bacteria, both Gram-positive, such as Staphylococcus sp. or Bacillus cereus, and Gram-negative, such as Salmonella poona or Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Elderflower extracts displayed a higher antimicrobial efficacy and larger zones of inhibition against a broad range of bacteria, particularly MRSA (17 mm) or Pseudomonas aeruginosa (9 mm), than other extracts. A ten-fold diluted aqueous extract of elder leaves showed moderate activity against the development of Bacillus cereus and Serratia marcescens (6 mm), but was not able to inhibit the growth of any crucial nosocomial pathogens (Hearst et al., 2010). Sambucus nigra fruit possesses antimicrobial activity against human pathogenic bacteria that cause infections of the upper respiratory tract. The addition of (Rubini\u00ae), a standardized liquid extract of elderberry, at a concentration of 10%, to bacterial liquid cultures decreased the growth of Gram-positive bacteria strains of Streptococcus pyogenes and Streptococcus Group C and G, as well as Gram-negative bacteria Branhamella catarrhalis, by more than 70% compared to the control samples. A concentration of 20% of the elderberry extract inhibited the bacterial development by 99% (Krawitz et al., 2011).",

            "text": "The antiviral activity of Rubini\u00ae was investigated against two different human pathogenic virus strains, such as influenza A (KAN-1, H5N1) and B (B/Mass), in the Madin-Darby canine kidney cell culture (Fig. 1\n). Treatment with elderberry extract distinctly reduced the spread of the foci size of influenza B virus, whereas the foci size of KAN-1 was enlarged, but its number was reduced in comparison to the untreated control (Krawitz et al., 2011). It was found that the elderberry extract at a concentration of 252 \u00b5g/ml caused a 50% inhibition (IC50) of human influenza A (H1N1) virus applied to infect the Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) NBL-2 cells, while a concentration of 1000 \u00b5g/ml allowed a 100% inhibition of this virus infection. In addition, it was shown that phenolic compounds from the elderberry fruit extract bind to H1N1 virions, thus blocking their ability to infect host cells. Two compounds which bind to H1N1 were identified: 5,7,3\u2032,4\u2032-tetra-O-methylquercetin and 5,7-dihydroxy-4-oxo-2-(3,4,5-trihydroxyphenyl)chroman-3-yl-3,4,5-trihydroxycyclohexanecarboxylate (Fig. 1). Both compounds were synthesized and it was demonstrated that compound 1 achieved an IC50 of 0.13 \u00b5g/ml for inhibition of H1N1 infection, and dihydromyricetin corresponding compound 2 gave an IC50 of 2.8 \u00b5g/ml. The mechanism of action was shown in Fig. 2\n. Taking into account these parameters, the effect of elderberry flavonoids related to inhibition of H1N1 is comparable to that of the known anti-influenza medicines, such as Oseltamivir (Tamiflu\u00ae) and Amantadine (Roschek, Fink, McMichael, Li, & Alberte, 2009). In another study in which MDCK was used as well, it was observed that concentrated elderberry juice could affect H1N1 in the early stages of viral replication: IC50 was achieved with an extract concentration of 720 \u00b5g/ml when the samples were given during infections, and with an extract concentration of 3600 \u00b5g/ml when the samples were applied immediately after infection. Additionally, in vivo experiments showed that elderberry effectively suppressed viral replication and could stimulate the immune response. Concentrated elderberry juice was separated in three fractions (low, medium and high molecular weight) that were administered to infected mice. The most effective fraction was the high-molecular-weight fraction (HM), which suppressed the viral yield in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluids (BALFs) and lungs. Fraction II, which was isolated from HM and contained mainly acidic polysaccharides, caused an increase in the level of IFV specific neutralizing antibody in the BALFs and serum and also the level of the secretory IgA in the BALFs and feces. The medium-molecular-weight fraction, which was rich in polyphenols, showed a lower activity (Fig. 1) (Kinoshita et al., 2012). Furthermore, elderberry extracts demonstrate an inhibitory effect on infectious bronchitis virus (IBV), a pathogenic chicken coronavirus, at an early stage of the virus infection. Elderberry extract reduced IBV titers by several orders of magnitude, in dependence of the dose applied. The increase in the elderberry extract concentration caused a decrease in virus titers and vice versa. In addition, electron microscopy of virions that were treated with elderberry extract demonstrated compromised envelopes and the presence of membrane vesicles. There are data that indicate that the pre-treatment with elderberry extract of IBV infection leads to damage to the virus extensive membrane and probably renders the virus non-infectious (Chen et al., 2014). Antiviral activity of elder bark was evaluated in relation to feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV), which frequently occurs in domestic cats and from the point of view of biological and pathogenic functions is very similar to the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). It was shown that elder bark extract had a high activity against FIV because it inhibited syncytia formation, with the inhibition level being dependent on extract concentration. Syncytia inhibition level of 100% was achieved when the extract concentration was 500 \u00b5g/ml (Uncini Manganelli, Zaccaro, & Tomei, 2005).",

The study was attended by humans suffering from at least two symptoms of flu including fever \u226538 \u00b0C and one or more respiratory influenza symptoms. The study used a standardized elderberry extract, the Sambucol\u00ae syrup. The participants, who were randomly divided into two groups, received either 15 ml of the elderberry syrup or placebo four times a day during five days. The effects of the treatment were monitored by a visual analogue scale. It turned out that in the group treated with the elderberry syrup, symptoms ebbed on average four days earlier than in the placebo group (Zakay-Rones et al., 2004). In 2009, during the spring flu season, a randomized, short-term, double-blind and placebo-controlled clinical trial was conducted with participants who showed three or more flu symptoms, such as fever, coughing, headache, muscle aches, nasal mucus discharge or nasal congestion, for less than 24 h (Fig. 1). The patients were divided at random into two groups. The first group received 4 slow-dissolve lozenges of a proprietary elderberry extract a day (each lozenge contained 175 mg of the proprietary elderberry extract) and the second group received placebo lozenges. After 48 h of treatment, patients from the group treated by elderberry extract demonstrated significant reduction in most of the flu-like symptoms \u2013 28% of patients were void of all symptoms and 60% of patients received relief of some symptoms and had one or two mild symptoms, whereas the placebo group demonstrated either no improvement or even aggravated symptoms (Kong, 2009). Selected antiviral properties of elderberry fruit (regarding to influenza A and B virus) are illustrated in Fig. 1.",

It was found that water-soluble compounds included in elder flowers were able to directly stimulate glucose metabolism and promote insulin secretion through clonal pancreatic \u03b2-cells. An extract of elder flowers (1 g/L) significantly increased glucose uptake, glucose oxidation and glycogenesis in vitro in mice abdominal muscles without added insulin (Gray, Abdel-Wahab, & Flatt, 2000). The fruit of Sambucus nigra positively influences the treatment of diabetic osteoporosis. A polyphenolic extract of elderberry improved the bone mineral density and reduced the body fat of diabetic rats. Also, the antioxidative capacity of serum improved in rats treated with the polyphenolic extract as the concentration of reduced glutathione (GSH) was restored to normal. The concentration of malondialdehyde, which is an index of the lipid peroxidation level, decreased in the serum, thus resulting in an improved osteoporosis status (Badescu, Badulescu, Badescu, & Ciocoiu, 2012). Salvador et al. investigated the effect of elderberry lipophilic and polar extract supplementation on diabetes management indices in rats. Type 2 diabetic rats (induced by streptozotocin) were fed a high-fat diet and received for 4 weeks 190 and 350 mg/kg body weight/day doses of lipophilic and polar elderberry extract, respectively. The polar extract lowered fasting blood glucose, whereas the lipophilic extract decreased secretion. Both extracts reduced insulin resistance and no significant alterations in the hematological indices, sera lipids and trace elements homeostasis from sera and tissues were observed (Salvador et al., 2017). Farrel et al. studied the effect of anthocyanin-rich elderberry extract on metabolism in a diet-induced obese mouse model. Four types of diet were used for 16 weeks: low-fat diet (LFD), high-fat lard-based diet (HFD), HFD with 0.25% of elderberry extract and HFD with 1.25% of elderberry extract. It was found that both groups of mice which received elderberry extract were characterized by a significantly lower liver weight and serum TAG concentration, and by significantly lower serum inflammatory markers, insulin resistance and hepatic fatty acid synthase mRNA, in comparison to HFD. In addition, HFD with 1.25% of elderberry extract reduced liver cholesterol and PPAR\u03b32 mRNA compared to HFD and HFD with 0.25% of elderberry extract (Farrel, Norris, Ryan et al., 2015). Furthermore, supplementation with 1.25% of elderberry extract of hyperlipidemic mice was conducted in order to determination the effect on atherosclerosis and HDL dysfunctions. It was not observed significantly differences in serum lipids between elderberry and control group, however, aspartate transaminase and fasting glucose were decreased in elderberry group of mice. Hepatic and intestinal mRNA changes with an improvement in HDL function and a decrease in hepatic cholesterol levels were also reported in elderberry-fed mice. Additionally, this group showed significantly higher activity of serum paraxonase-1 arylesterase. The results indicate the reduction of elderberry in aorta total cholesterol content and then less atherosclerosis progression (Farrel, Norris, Lee, Chun, & Blesso, 2015).",

Each capsule contained 10% anthocyanins and represented the equivalent of 5 ml of elderberry juice. Furthermore, an additional trial was carried out to study the short-term effect of elderberry anthocyanins on serum lipid concentration, where six volunteers received a single dose of 10 capsules, which was the equivalent of 50 ml of elderberry juice. In the placebo-controlled study, the elderberry group did not show statistically significant differences in changes in serum lipids as well as vitamin A, E and \u03b2-carotene, compared to the placebo group, and even, a decrease in the level of vitamin C was observed in both groups. In a single-dose experiment conducted as part of the same study, an increase in total anthocyanins in serum was found during the postprandial phase. The serum lipids concentration was lower in the elderberry group, but differences were not significant (Murkovic et al., 2004). In a study in which patients took, among others, dietary supplements from the fruit and flowers of Sambucus nigra, the BMI index dropped by approx. 3%, the weight fell by an average of 3.2 kg, systolic blood pressure decreased by an average of over 5% and diastolic blood pressure by 2.5%. Moreover, physical and mental well-being as well as the quality of life of the patients significantly improved (Chrubasik et al., 2008). A diluted concentrate from elder berries and flowers, used among others in hypocaloric diet in Switzerland, resulted in average weight loss of 2.6 kg in 11 volunteers during 7 days of diet (Walz & Chrubasik, 2008).",
