These versions of patient selection scores carry substantial ethical dilemmas, especially when related to senior adults and palliative patients who have been prevented, based on many of these algorithms, to have access to care. Surgeons have to balance utilitarian and deontological principles, keeping in mind that delaying probably decreases survival and may significantly impact quality of life. Non-operative strategies have been recommended in some cases, as treatment pathways have been urgently redesigned, but uncertainty remains about the mid- and long-term impact.",

The challenge in maintaining a \u201cclean\u201d site is significant. Techniques described include getting patients to self-isolate prior to admission, screening patients before admission with swabs and frequent screening and appropriate PPE for healthcare workers.
