Sharpless et al. studied the synthesis of tetrazoles by Cu-catalyzed \u2018click reaction\u2019 of nitriles with azides.6 For example, 1-substituted-5-tosyltetrazoles were prepared from tosyl cyanide (TsCN); the tosyl group was subsequently elaborated by nucleophilic substitution reactions. The 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition of diazomethane with TsCN has been reported to give 1,2,3-triazines.7\n",

Noteworthy, intermolecular reactions of this type are relatively rare and highly activated nitriles, such as arylsulfonylnitriles and cyanoformates, have to be employed.8 Breitmaier and R\u00fcffer reported8f an efficient synthesis of functionalized pyridines by cyclization of 1,3-butadienes, including 2-silyloxy-1,3-butadienes, with tosylcyanide9 (TsCN). Pyridines have been prepared also by cyclization of pyran-2-ones with TsCN with extrusion of carbon dioxide.10 Recently, the synthesis of 1-azabicyclo[2.2.2]oct-1-enes by cyclization of 2-silyloxycyclohexa-1,3-diene with TsCN has been reported.11 Recently, we reported,12 based on the work of Breitmaier, the hetero-Diels\u2013Alder reaction of 1,3-bis(trimethylsilyloxy)-1,3-butadienes13 with TsCN. Herein, we report full details of these studies and a considerable extension of the scope. The reactions reported herein allow a convenient synthesis of a variety of functionalized 4-hydroxy-2-(arylsulfonyl)pyridines which are not readily available by other methods.",

The reaction conditions were optimized. The reactions of dienes 1a,b,e,f, prepared from unsubstituted \u03b2-ketoesters, were carried out at 20 \u00b0C (the starting materials were added at \u201378 \u00b0C and the mixture was subsequently warmed to 20 \u00b0C during 30 min. The reaction time was in the range of 24\u201328 h. A considerable extension of the reaction time was necessary for the less reactive dienes 1c and 1d derived from pentane-2,4-dione and 1-methoxy-pentane-2,4-dione, respectively. In these cases, the starting materials were added at 0 rather than \u201378 \u00b0C. The reactions were carried out at 20 \u00b0C. An increase of the temperature resulted in partial decomposition. The reactions of dienes 1g\u2013i and 1m\u2013o were carried out at 45 \u00b0C (48 h). The arylthio-substituted dienes 1j\u2013l,p solidify at 20 \u00b0C.

This can be explained by the cisoid conformation of 1,3-bis(silyloxy)-1,3-butadienes 1g\u2013s, due to the presence of the substituent located at the central carbon atom. The reaction of 2a with 1,3-bis(silyloxy)-1,3-butadienes containing a substituent located at the terminal carbon atom proved to be unsuccessful, presumably due to steric reasons. The reaction of 1a with ethoxycarbonyl cyanide was also unsuccessful, due to the low reactivity of the latter compared to 2a. No conversion was observed when the reaction was carried out at 20 and 60 \u00b0C. Forcing conditions (neat, 120 \u00b0C) resulted in decomposition and 1,5 O \u2192 C TMS shift of the 1,3-bis(silyl enol ether) to give a 3-silyloxy-4-silylcrotonate.26\n",
