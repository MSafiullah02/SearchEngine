Many of the advances made in medicine, infectious diseases and immunology stem directly from the use of one animal species or another as a model system. Although historical precedent exists for their use, there is strong opposition to the use of laboratory animals. As a scientist in today's society, one must be attuned to the ethics of the care and use of animals in experimental studies, follow governmental mandates and strive to determine whether or not the questions being raised can be answered by other means. Thus, scientists must answer the simple, yet elusive, question of \u2018Why are animal models needed?\u2019.",

This review will address a variety of issues including the philosophy of studying animal models, how the results derived from them are used and evaluated, the various types of models performed using different pathogenic fungi and what those studies are used for. We will document, from the work of others, but relying heavily on our own experiences, examples of engagement with these issues.

Among the variables that can be controlled are the strains of organisms used, and increase or decrease of the inoculum size to control severity of infection. Furthermore, the choice of animal species is critical. The course of the disease in some species may mimic human disease better than others. Other animal model variables under the control of the investigator include the use of different immunosuppressive regimens to suppress particular host-cell types, choice of host and its genetics (e.g., inbred or outbred mice) and control over the route of infection to emulate different types of clinical disease. The control over the route of administration and duration of antifungal therapy when performing efficacy studies is also a benefit. Our capacity to use age and sex matched experimental animals also contributes to reproducibility. Animal models also are useful for the development of diagnostic assays. Thus, we are able to address issues in vivo that cannot be answered by in vitro tests.",

            "text": "One also needs to be aware of the inherent weaknesses of an animal model. No single model of infection can be used to answer all questions. There can be substantial variability from one experiment to the next, which must be minimized if possible. Many murine models have the drawback of being too acute in the progression of disease, and some fungal models include the involvement of organs that are not prominent target tissues in patients. In addition, mice are difficult to use when repeated samplings of blood, for example, are desired from the same animal, if larger volumes of blood are needed. However, one may compensate for this in mice by adding extra animals to experimental groups and sacrificing cohorts at desired intervals during the experiment to obtain blood 1. When performing therapeutic studies in animals there may be differences in drug penetration or metabolism from one species to the next and differences from that observed in humans. Lastly, as mentioned above, the model must be affordable to perform, and if the costs are too high whether in purchase price or personnel time and effort, the utility of the model is limited.",

The question in these studies becomes what parameters should be followed to obtain the best information. Two primary parameters of infection are followed, survival and fungal burden in the tissues. Survival studies result in clear data sets, but death as an end point is often not allowed by Animal Care and Use Committees, with ethical questions arising concerning the humane care and use of animals for survival studies. Many institutional committees now require euthanasia of the animals prior to death from disease. The criteria for euthanasia must be evaluated carefully on an individual basis, since subjective judgments can skew the data (i.e., euthanizing animals too soon makes the infection appear more severe that it truly is). Thus, criteria for euthanasia have to be as quantitative as possible, applied objectively and reproducibly to ensure accuracy, and the judgements on individual animals made without knowledge of their study group, wherever possible. Statistical evaluation of these data are appropriately done by survival analyses using a logrank test or Gehan's Wilcoxon tests; where there are no censored data points a Wilcoxon rank sums test also can be used.",

For infections due to yeast (e.g., Cryptococcus, Candida, etc.) the quantification of CFU from the target organs by homogenization of the organ followed by serial dilution and plating is a useful and straightforward methodology. Infectious burden can be a sensitive parameter for studies of drug efficacy, comparative virulence or disease progression. Benefits of performing assays of infectious burden include shortened experimental durations and avoidance of survival studies. However, for hyphal organisms, like Aspergillus, the best method of infectious burden determination is controversial. Some investigators use a qPCR methodology or chitin assay, while others use CFU determinations 2\u20136. Each method has benefits and drawbacks. The assay of chitin in the tissues 6 can be a tedious assay and does not indicate whether the organisms present were viable. A qPCR assay applied to the determination of Aspergillus burden 4 requires specialized equipment and reagents, and specialized sample preparation. These are drawbacks for some laboratories and commercial assay can be cost-prohibitive.",

However, in vitro activity does not necessarily accurately reflect subsequent in vivo activity nor have the majority of antifungal drugs' in vitro activity been correlated with clinical outcome.

However, the in vitro system is a simple environment and does not reproduce the extreme complexity of an in vivo environment. The development of more complex cell cultures, where more than one type of cell is present can more accurately mimic the events in vivo. Another more sophisticated cell culturing system is based in three-dimensional (3-D) cultures, consisting in a rotating-wall vessel that generates low turbulence, allowing cells to associate, and form 3-D structures.

Reviews on the use of these species in medical mycology studies have been published recently 8, 9. The use of simple organisms is a helpful tool in the study of the host-parasite interactions by analogy to common processes conserved in mammalian cells. D. melanogaster has been used as model to study cellular defense mediated by macrophages against C. albicans, as well as virulence 10\u201312. A. castellanii13\u201318 and D. discoideum9, 19\u201322 have served as models to understand the phagocytic process, due the similarity of the process used by mammalian macrophages, but also may be relevant to interactions of the organisms in their natural ecological environments 16.

Rabbit models allow us to evaluate physical and physiological data unavailable or difficult to obtain with small mammals; for example, multiple large volumes of blood can be obtained from individual animals; serial bleeding is easier than in mice. Rabbits are also useful for the study of CNS infections because of the relative ease in obtaining high quality (i.e., without blood contamination) volumes of CSF (0.5 ml to 1 ml per sample time) from the same animal multiple times; this CSF is useful for determination of biochemical (e.g., glucose or protein) and cellular parameters (e.g., WBC counts). In contrast, the volume of CSF obtained from mice usually does not exceed 5 to 7 \u00b5l and is often a terminal procedure. The size of organs and internal structures makes possible more accurate and specific observation in rabbits than the mouse. For example, in our model of coccidioidal meningitis, the development and histological appearance of arteritis and vasculitis closely mimics that of humans 49. Other models of CNS infection in rabbits include those using infection with C. neoformans50 and C. albicans51. In addition, the use of larger animals, such as rabbits, allows for thorough clinical observations of signs and symptoms.",

The various routes of infection include, pulmonary (intranasal or intratracheal), intraperitoneal, intravenous, intracranial, intrathecal or intracisternal, mucosal (vaginal or orogastric), dermal (skin or cornea) and subcutaneous. Each of these routes of infection has been used to study particular infections 34\u201336, 38, 41, 107, 108. It is important to point out that animal hosts may differ in their susceptibility to challenge with the same pathogen by different routes. Our laboratory reported differences in mouse susceptibility to Blastomycesdermatitidis between intranasal and intraperitoneal infection. The same strain of B. dermatitidis at the same dose (30 CFU per animal) caused death of 50% of C3H/HeJ mice after intranasal infection vs. 17% when infection was made intraperitoneally. However, DBA/1J mice were more susceptible to intraperitoneal (83% mortality) than to intranasal infection (25% mortality). Thus, these data demonstrate that both route and mouse strain play a decisive role in modeling experimental fungal infection 109.",

Thus, in many instances a pulmonary route of infection would be optimal to initiate the model because it mimics the natural entry into the human body. For example, pulmonary inoculation with C. neoformans showed generalized dissemination of the fungus, with the brain and lungs heavily infected 42 days after challenge 110, mimicking human cryptococcosis. However, the development of infection and the resulting affected organs potentially can differ between animals and humans due to differential organ tropism of the infecting microorganism, the organism's greater ability to grow in a particular organ environment or host factors. An example is substantial renal involvement in various models of aspergillosis, which is less common in human infection 35. In light of differences in pathogenesis and organ tropism, we have the option to mimic the infectious process, which is the goal of the animal modeling, by modifying the route of infection.",

Intracranial infection is performed by direct inoculation in the brain parenchyma through the midline of the cranium in mice 120. However, as mice mature the sutures between the frontal and parietal plates fuse, making the bregma more difficult to locate. Thus, injecting through the fontanelle is useful only for mice up to about 8-weeks of age. Although infection spreads to other organs, CNS fungal burdens remain higher than in other organs 121, 122. In the example of aspergillosis, hyphal growth and development of abscesses and necrotic areas mimic the common complications observed in clinical cases of cerebral aspergillosis 119, 123. Intracerebral models of infection also have been used to test therapeutic options for treatment of aspergillosis, coccidioidomycosis, scedosporiosis, histoplasmosis and cryptococcosis 121, 122, 124\u2013128. Another route of infection to establish CNS infection in mice is intrathecal inoculation, which has been used in a model of coccidioidomycosis to simulate the meningitis and vasculitis associated with CNS complications caused by hematogenous dissemination of the fungus in human disease 129. The technique requires a skin incision over the lumbar vertebrae and inoculation of an arthroconidial, spherule or endospore suspension into the subarachnoid space via lumbar puncture 129. Via this route of infection, the fungus can be recovered from brain and meninges as early as three days after infection, and by 8 days postinfection, the histopathologic abnormalities found in the brain or spinal cord include acute meningitis, vasculitis and polymorphonuclear cells infiltrates 129. Similar to the intracerebral route of infection, extrameningeal dissemination is observed; however, CNS involvement is greater than that reached in systemic or pulmonary infections 129. Intracisternal inoculation for the establishment of infection in the CNS has been used as route of infection in rabbit models of meningitis by C. neoformans and C. immitis49, 50.",

            "text": "Pulmonary diseases can be initiated using different techniques. The most common technique is by intranasal instillation of a fungal suspension. However, the number of fungal elements arriving in lung tissue can be uncertain, depending on the anesthesia used and experience of the person doing the procedure. In early studies, our laboratory found that, using a standardized procedure, 1 h after intranasal inoculation with B. dermatitidis yeasts, 33.5% of the inoculum CFUs could be routinely recovered from lungs, and results in a consistent model of pulmonary blastomycosis 130. This technique is easy to perform and several reproducible models of fungal infection have been established including pulmonary aspergillosis 3, 35, cryptococcosis 131, histoplasmosis 34, 39, 46, blastomycosis 34, 39, paracoccidioidomycosis 39 and zygomycosis 38, 75, 132 in different mammalian species. Some investigators prefer to use inhalation of dry fungal conidia as the method of pulmonary infection. A comparative study using titanium dioxide particles showed that inhalation results in a more homogenous distribution of the particles in lungs than does the instillation technique 133. In another study, delivery by inhalation was compared to intranasal instillation for the establishment of pulmonary aspergillosis in rats; higher fungal burdens with smaller standard deviation and more homogenous pneumonia was reported in animals infected by inhalation than by instillation 108. The use of aerosol chambers reproduces, with the exception of higher numbers of fungal conidia inhaled, the natural entry of the microorganism in the respiratory tract. Separate studies have demonstrated the reproducibility of delivering A. fumigatus conidia to the lungs using inhalation 108, 134, 135. The third method used for inoculation for pulmonary infection is the intratracheal route. Although better for the consistency of inoculum administration, it requires a minor surgical procedure. An incision needs to be made and organisms injected directly into the trachea. Various models using this method have been reported such as those using Penicillium marneffei116, and C. albicans70, 71, as well as others 35, 36, 38, 39.",

Observations showing that areas of the brain rich in catecholamines are frequently infected by C. neoformans support this suggestion. Recently, we have reported differences in organ involvement between C. gattii and C. neoformans var. grubii in a systemic model of cryptococcosis in BALB/c mice 161. Infection with C. grubii showed a temporal increase of CFU in brain and liver but no yeast were recovered from the brain of animals infected with C. gattii. Interestingly, and reported for first time, long-term infection with C. gattii resulted in unusual skin and intestinal mucosal lesions in hydrocortisone-suppressed and in immunocompetent BALB/c mice, whereas these types of lesions were not found in C. grubii infected mice 161.",

Differences among these may be large or relatively small depending on the organism. Thus, it is crucial to determine the relative virulence of the fungal strain under study prior to embarking on additional studies looking for virulence factors or pathogenic mechanisms. Studies on virulence and host-resistance most often are done using one strain of fungus and several strains of mice or several strains of fungus and one strain of mice. An example of how this approach can be troublesome comes from our experience with studies on the pathogenicity of Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Using a murine model studied in CD-1 mice we surveyed 28 clinical and nonclinical isolates of S. cerevisiae for their capacity to proliferate and persist in the brain 172. A continuum of virulence was found ranging from those able to proliferate by about 5-fold to those that were rapidly cleared from the tissues 172. In a subsequent set of studies we examined these same isolates in a different strain of mouse, DBA/2, and found that some of the isolates were lethal (increase in virulence), but that the rank-order of virulence was not the same in DBA/2 mice as it was in CD-1 mice 173. These differences indicate the potential for multiple strategies of virulence 173. Thus, one should not assume that because an organism appears virulent or nonvirulent in one model that it will appear the same way when used in a different model of infection.",

Genes involved with cell wall integrity, evasion of the immune response, toxins and extracellular enzymes related to direct attack of the host tissues have been recently and extensively reviewed 192. Aspergillus strains defective in particular genes involved may demonstrate a reduction of virulence, but can still retain pathogenic capability. For instance, double chitin synthase mutants (chsC-/chsG-) showed reduced chitin synthase activity (required for cell wall assembly), as well as anomalous growth in A. fumigatus. However, the double mutant, despite showing reduced pathogenicity in comparison to the wild-type strain, still caused pulmonary disease in a neutropenic mouse 193. Similar results were found in chsE mutants 194. Deletions of rhbAfos-1 and pksP genes also show reduction of virulence in models of murine aspergillosis 195\u2013197. Histidine kinases 198, 199, and calcineurin 200\u2013202 serve as additional examples of genes linked to virulence by studies done in animal models.",

More recent advances in the study of virulence factors have taken other approaches. One method to assess virulence is that of in vivo gene expression and there are two related methodologies for gene-profiling of fungi during infection that use reporter genes. These are in vivo expression technology (IVET) or constructing fusion proteins tagged with green fluorescent protein (reviewed in 203, 204). IVET has been successfully used for C. albicans205 and Histoplasma capsulatum206. In Candida albicans IVET demonstrated that SAP2 was expressed during systemic, but not mucosal murine infection. For A. fumigatus, Langfelder et al. 207 formed a green fluorescent protein (GFP) fusion with polyketide synthase (pksP-egfp) and followed the in vivo expression of this GFP-fusion protein during pulmonary infection in corticosteroid-suppressed mice. They showed expression of pksP in the hyphae of germinating conidia in the lungs of infected animals.",

In studies on S. cerevisiae, pools of isogenic strains were used to infect mice to determine genes important to survival in vivo by determining which of the isogenic strains was recovered from the animals 208. Signature Tagged Mutagenesis (SMT) has been applied successfully to the study of in vivo gene expression of Cryptococcus209 and A. fumigatus210 in murine models. This methodology uses a transposon mutagenesis system in which each transposon mutant is tagged with a unique DNA sequence that is to be followed using PCR and Southern blotting. To examine in vivo expression, a pool of individually tagged mutants is prepared and inoculated into mice and organisms recovered at various times postinfection. In the Aspergillus studies pools consisted of 84 or 96 unique mutants, which increases the number of mutants that can be screened in one experiment 210. The use of this methodology for A. fumigatus resulted in the identification of PABA synthase as an essential gene for virulence 210. Similarly, the Cryptococcus work resulted in the identification of 5 strains with reduced virulence and one strain with increased virulence 209.",

Interestingly, expression of pksP related to conidial pigmentation was only detected in pulmonary infection, but was not detected in vitro211. In vivo gene expression has also been examined by serial analysis of gene expression (SAGE) technology in elegant studies done on C.neoformans in a rabbit model of meningitis 212. Generation of sequence tags (ca. 14 bp) for each cryptococcal gene allowed for RNA expression of the organism to be followed. The results of the study indicated that C. neoformans in vivo showed over 300 highly expressed sequence tags (i.e., genes), involved in a variety of cellular functions 212 and will allow more focused efforts on particular pathways and gene sets.",

Therefore, the investigator may need to perform a manipulation of the animals to address a particular immunological question. These manipulations include, but are not limited to administration of an immunosuppressive regimen (e.g., cytotoxic chemotherapy or glucocorticoids) given alone or in combination with antibiotic regimens to prevent secondary bacterial infections, antibodies to interfere with or inactivate a cell population (e.g., anti-PMN) or particular cytokine (e.g., anti-IL-12), administration of a chemical or drug to induce a metabolic change (e.g., streptozocin to induce type II diabetes or estrogen to induce estrus), surgical alteration of animals (e.g., thymectomy, orchidectomy, or ovariectomy), gamma-irradiation, and changes in diet (e.g., amino acid deficiency). Each of these manipulations affects the host-response to infection and those effects should be defined. For example, in recent studies on orogastrointestinal candidiasis we found that administration of 5-fluorouracil resulted in dissemination of C. albicans from the gut tissues to visceral organs, nicely emulating a clinical situation of the cancer chemotherapy patient that develops systemic candidiasis 139. However, during our preliminary studies we noted that mice were succumbing to secondary bacterial infection rather than fungal disease and found it necessary to include a combination regimen of oral and parenteral antibacterials to allow for the development of the candidal infection 139.",

In addition, the continued accumulation of haplotype polymorphisms into databases for mouse strains allows investigators to further refine their searches for genes or gene families involved in susceptibility 220. Furthermore, the advent of molecular manipulation has allowed for the insertion of human genes into mice resulting in a transgenic humanized mouse. For example CD13 insertion has been studied in relationship to the pathogenicity of human coronavirus in mice 225. These types of studies further refine and extend the potential of murine models for the study of disease, since they permit study of human-specific molecules and/or cells in an in vivo environment. Future studies using transgenic mice humanized by the insertion of a single human gene (e.g., cytokine or chemokine receptor molecules, Toll-like receptors, etc) will likely be applied to fungal diseases and will undoubtedly provide extremely interesting results.",

The expression of particular cytokines signal whether the host-response will be protective or nonprotective as they drive it towards a Th1 or Th2 response. Studies on the genesis of host response can be greatly aided by examination of the cytokine response in vivo214, 219, 226\u2013229. Animal models provide the possibility of examining specific tissues or organs for cytokine expression and the availability of immunological reagents for mice and variety of strains of mice make them ideal for these studies. Methodologies include ELISA assays for cytokine proteins, cytokine protein macroarrays, RT-PCR assays for individual cytokines and mouse DNA microarray for use in examining the global host-response to infection. The use of other animals as models for studies of host-response is more limited due to the severely limited availability of immunological reagents and genetically defined animals.",

We accomplished this by developing our own primers for sequenced rabbit cytokines and used PCR methodology to demonstrate up-regulation of mRNA encoding for different proinflammatory interleukins, as well as MCP-1, iNOS and MMP-9 in the brain basilar artery 245.

Detection of specific antibodies, used for diagnostic and epidemiologic purposes 365\u2013368, supports this role. Mannans and glucuronoxylomannan that stimulate protective and nonprotective IgM production have been associated with protection against C. albicans and C. neoformans, respectively 369, 370, suggesting that individual epitopes differ in their ability to elicit protective antibody. Immunizations with liposomal encapsulated adhesin from C. albicans protected BALB/c mice against systemic candidiasis and polyclonal anti-serum from the immunized mice protected na\u00efve BALB/c and SCID mice 369. Because SCID mice are defective in B and T cells, these cells appear not to be involved in the protection. The authors suggest that protection could be transferred by antibody that agglutinates C. albicans cells 369. Similarly, mice immunized with capsular glucuronoxylomannan covalently bound to tetanus toxoid conferred protection against C. neoformans, and antibody titer during the early phase of infection correlated with clearance of the organisms 371. The true potential of antibodies may have been recently demonstrated by studies showing that a laminarin-diphtheria toxoid conjugate prolonged survival of mice infected with C. albicans or A. fumigatus and that transfer of whole immunogenic serum to na\u00efve animals resulted in immunoprotective properties ascribed to IgM and IgG1 372.

Several aspects of performing these types of studies need to be considered. Many of these already have been discussed in the initial sections of this review. Based on in vitro susceptibility studies it is critical to know which organisms within a genus appear to be susceptible and which are resistant to the antifungal being tested, as well as how the organisms behave during the experimental infection. Similarly, one must be aware of differences between the animal species being used for the models, as the efficacy of antifungal drug can be also species-dependent. Because of physiological differences between animal species, the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamics of the new drug must be considered before drug testing in vivo. The example of VCZ in guinea pigs versus mice has been discussed in a previous section of this review. However, administration of grapefruit juice in the drinking water of mice, which inhibits gut P450 enzymes, has been shown to increase the serum concentration of the drug to therapeutic levels 383, 384 and allows the use of murine models to test VCZ efficacy against different experimental infections 98, 101, 385. Variability in drug efficacy can also depend on the animal model used and for this reason data should be carefully interpreted, as treatment efficacy in one model may not occur in a different one. For example, we have previously reported differences in efficacy for several antifungal drugs between murine models of systemic and pulmonary aspergillosis 386, 387.",

When performing antifungal combination studies it is critical to know the efficacy of the monotherapies being considered for use in combination. Significant enhancement of efficacy by the combination cannot be demonstrated if one or both of the compounds is already curative at the dosage being tested. Thus, if one or both drugs alone show good efficacy, the combination of the two is assessed by using them at suboptimal dosages 36, 37. The combined efficacy over the monotherapy must be seen in animal models by comparing the combination and demonstrating a significant enhancement in efficacy over that of either drug tested alone at the same dosing concentration. Combination can be done by administering both drugs simultaneously or sequentially.",

As mentioned in regard to other pharmacologic studies, these are usually performed in uninfected animals, often the same species in which an efficacy trial and/or a pharmacologic study are conducted. Early studies of polyene toxicity to nephrons, and the localization of the effect, necessarily relied on animal models. As examples of more recent studies, we have utilized animal models to illuminate endocrinological effects of azoles 397, drug-drug interactions resulting in toxicity 398 and to study the neurotoxicity of amphotericin preparations 399, information that would not have been possible to obtain from humans. Toxicological studies in infected animals are also sorely needed, largely because of the possibility that disease toxicity and drug toxicity may summate, such as that reported in studies of murine blastomycosis 400.",

We have discussed various aspects of the benefits and weaknesses, types of data generated and evaluation of these data. From the numerous fungal animal models discussed it should be apparent that each is unique and requires careful performance and evaluation before reasonable conclusions concerning the results can be drawn. One cannot make overall generalizations that all fungal infections progress or behave in the same manner nor does the host respond in the same way to all fungi. Thus, before embarking on studies utilizing animals a series of questions must be addressed and answered by the investigator. What is the infection being modeled and is the model well defined and reproducible? What is the immune status of the host? Is the fungal infection being modeled an acute or chronic disease? When therapeutic studies are the goal, does the investigator know what the efficacies of monotherapy regimens are, what are the optimal doses, duration, frequency and routes of therapy? Regardless of the model and purpose of using the model, what parameters of infection should be followed? Are these parameters survival and CFU or is a surrogate marker of infection applicable? And finally, how are the data best evaluated, with which statistical analyses? Answering these questions first will lead to better experimental results, sound conclusions and allow us to better understand medically important fungi and their interactions with the host.",
