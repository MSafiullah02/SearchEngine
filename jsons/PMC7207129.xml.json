Key components of the evaluation are assessment of underlying vulnerabilities (including preexisting physical or psychological illness), identification of specific sources of stress (social isolation, infected friends or family members, financial obligations, caregiver burden), inventory of specific symptoms (depression, anxiety, insomnia), and sources of emotional and spiritual support.4 Online tools to enhance clinical decision making and facilitate assessment of symptom severity are available from the American Psychiatric Association at https://www.psychiatry.org/psychiatrists/practice/dsm/educational-resources/assessment-measures. For those at highest risk, a multidisciplinary approach may be most helpful, with coordinated engagement of social workers, psychiatry, nursing and palliative care providers tailored to individual patient needs with attention to ensuring consistent messaging across disciplines. Since direct access to these resources may be limited by infection control precautions, telemedicine consultations are a reasonable alternative, and may be enhanced through the use of multi-participant videoconferencing to permit collaborative input from the patient, interested family members, and relevant members of the multidisciplinary team. For those who do not require formal mental health evaluation, supportive interventions designed to promote wellness and enhance coping may be relevant, many of which are readily available to patients and providers online (Table 1\n).",

For patients with refractory symptoms or those who are not candidates for ventilatory support, utilization of palliative interventions, including anxiolytics and narcotics, may be necessary. Moreover, as patients progress to end-of-life, there may be increasing need for strategies to manage terminal delirium, heightened airway secretions, and pain. In the absence of dedicated palliative care supports, CV providers may need to rapidly become facile with self-directed management of these issues. A useful compendium of resources developed by our group that includes specific guidance regarding pharmacologic interventions for care of terminal illness is provided at https://covidprotocols.org/protocols/15-palliative-care.",

Accordingly, early conversations regarding goals of care and preferences for lifesaving interventions including mechanical ventilation and cardiopulmonary resuscitation are critical. Proactive engagement with patients when they are able to make their own decisions may ease the burden on family members and caregivers who may later be challenged to make end-of-life decisions from a distance. Since not all clinicians are comfortable with these discussions, we believe that an important early priority is to provide frontline providers with basic training and tools to initiate these conversations along the lines proposed by the Serious Illness Care Program.6 Non-physician team members including nursing, social work, and chaplaincy may be critical catalysts for these discussions, particularly when resources are constrained. Practical guidance for cardiology providers initiating these conversations is available online at https://www.vitaltalk.org/guides/covid-19-communication-skills.",

Stress on healthcare providers may be compounded when patient care demands outstrip traditional care frameworks and necessitate redeployment of providers to unfamiliar care settings or crisis conditions force battlefield-style triage of limited resources. Institutional leadership must emphasize self-care as a key component of the response to the pandemic. Crisis support, virtual group meetings, and access to individual therapy are critical, but should be complemented by efforts to buttress resilience among providers through restriction of prolonged work hours, provision of temporary housing to limit viral exposure to family members, and ensuring access to healthful diversions, including fitness and stress reduction programs.",
