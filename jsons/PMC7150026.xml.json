            "text": "Mass gathering (MG) medicine is a new field that includes risk assessment, surveillance, and early response to health threats associated with MGs.1 A MG is usually defined as more than a specified number of persons at a specific location, for a specific purpose, for a defined period of time, and which may greatly vary between different MGs.2 The number of participants that classifies an event as a MG is arbitrary. Some guidelines specify any gathering to be a MG when more than 1000 attendees are present. Others require the attendance of as many as 25,000 attendees to qualify. However, outbreaks occur irrespective of the size of a gathering. Outbreaks have been reported in settings such as weddings, private parties, and other events involving fewer than 1000 people, but also in large religious MGs attended by millions of pilgrims or sport, sociocultural, political, or commercial large events.3 According to the World Health Organization, a MG should be defined as \u201cany occasion that attracts sufficient numbers of people to strain the planning and response resources of the community, city or nation hosting the event.\u201d2 These MGs can be planned or not, and they may be sporadic or recurrent. A major public health concern in relation to MGs is the international circulation of infectious diseases, and the spread between participants and to the population of the nation hosting the event.2., 4. A number of infectious diseases have been caused or have the potential to cause illnesses and deaths at MGs. The risk and pattern of diseases at MGs are influenced by the features of the event, notably its duration and location, particular activities, and also the participants\u2019 characteristics, including their immunity to infectious agents. The first recognition of the consequences of the unique nature of infectious disease for MGs was for food-borne illness arising from person-to-person transmission, with historical reports of cholera outbreaks in the context of the Hajj Muslim pilgrimage and in the Kumb Mela Hindu pilgrimage.4 By contrast, the majority of outbreaks occurring at MG events reported over the last few decades resulted from respiratory transmission. Respiratory transmission generally requires close contact and is thus more common in MGs with overcrowded living conditions. Intercontinental outbreaks of Neisseria meningitidis have been described in the context of various MGs, notably at the Hajj between 1987 and 2001.4 Over the last 15 years, the rapid international spread of influenza and other respiratory pathogens in association with MGs have been reported on many occasions. It is now clear that one of the major health risks at modern international MGs is the acquisition of respiratory pathogens, with further spread to origin countries through returning attendees.",

Definition of syndromes differed according to authors. Sample size varied from 7 to 555 individuals. These surveys were conducted in ill pilgrims from various nationalities recruited at tertiary care hospitals and primary health care centers in Saudi Arabia or at Mina encampment or when returning in home country. The types of samples included were throat swabs, nasal swabs, nasopharyngeal swabs, sputum, bronchoalveolar, and nasopharyngeal aspirates, depending on the studies.7., 26., 27., 28., 29., 30., 31., 32., 33. The viruses most commonly isolated from symptomatic patients during the Hajj are rhinovirus (3 out of 10 ill pilgrims), followed by influenza virus (1 out of 10) and coronaviruses (1 out of 10); other viruses (1 out of 10, grouped) being less frequently isolated, including adenovirus, parainfluenza virus, respiratory syncitial virus, and enterovirus by decreasing frequency. The ongoing Middle East Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV) epidemic in Saudi Arabia has prompted several countries to establish an enhanced surveillance system to rapidly detect and investigate possible cases of MERS-CoV infection among travelers to from the Middle East, including Hajj and Umrah pilgrims. Results from England, France, Canada, and US revealed that influenza A and B were the viruses most frequently isolated from hospitalized patients followed by rhinovirus; non-MERS coronaviruses, parainfluenzae virus, adenovirus, respiratory syncytial virus, enterovirus, and metapneumovirus were less frequently isolated.34., 35., 36., 37. From 2012 through 2014, the surveillance data failed to evidence any case of MERS among Hajj pilgrims and only eight Umrah-associated MERS cases where identified over an estimated 20 million pilgrims who visited Mecca during this period.38\n",

Data gathered from 1983 pilgrims suffering pneumonia or lower tract respiratory infections between 1991 through 2013. Definition of syndromes differed according to authors. Sample size varied from 38 to 713 individuals. These surveys were conducted in ill pilgrims from various nationalities recruited at hospitals in Saudi Arabia; one was conducted among ill pilgrims arriving at an airport in Saudi Arabia. Types of samples included were serum, sputum and bronchoalveolar and nasopharyngeal aspirates, depending on the studies. Pathogens were identified by conventional culture methods, serology or PCR in one study. The bacteria most commonly isolated from symptomatic patients during the Hajj are Haemophilus influenzae (2 out of 10 ill pilgrims), followed by Streptococcus pneumoniae (1\u20132 out of 10), Mycobacterium tuberculosis (1 out of 10), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (1 out of 10), Klebsiella pneumoniae (1 out of 10), and Chlamydophila pneumoniae (1 out of 10).

In one UK study, a 38.3% seroconversion rate (mostly due to influenza H3N2) was observed in pilgrims returning from Hajj. However, in an Iranian study, the seroconversion rate was 3.6%. A difference in vaccination coverage may explain in part the difference in the reported seroconversion rates between the two studies.

In PCR-based studies, the mean prevalence of respiratory syncytial virus among pilgrims was 0.5% before and 1.2% after the Hajj. The prevalence of rhinovirus and adenovirus were investigated in six studies. For rhinovirus, the mean prevalence increased from 6.9% before to 19.7% after the Hajj.

The results from this study demonstrated the acquisition of S. pneumoniae nasal carriage in returning Hajj pilgrims, with a prevalence of 7.3% before departing for the KSA and 19.5% before leaving the KSA. None of the participants tested positive for B. pertussis or M. pneumoniae at any point during the study period.56 These results were confirmed the following year in another study conducted among a second French cohort of pilgrims departing from France for the 2013 Hajj season, which have reported a S. pneumoniae pharyngeal carriage of 50% before departing for the KSA and 62% before leaving the KSA.50 As part of this second study, nasal samples were also tested for S. aureus, thus demonstrating a high rate (22.8%) of nasal carriage of S. aureus among pilgrims on return from the Hajj, with a significant increase of the emerging clonal complex 398.57 In an earlier study, a low rate of methicillin resistant S. aureus (MRSA) carriage was noticed among pilgrims attending the 2004 Hajj pilgrimage. In fact, of pilgrims screened, 20.6% were positive for S. aureus of which only 1.5% were MRSA.58\n",

However, the adherence to face mask use by Hajj pilgrims remains a challenge.87 By contrast, and despite their poor knowledge of the usefulness of hand hygiene in preventing respiratory tract infections, hand washing compliance of pilgrims is quite good.87 Pending further rigorous studies on their effectiveness, we recommend effective hand hygiene practices, notably the use of alcohol-based hand gel, since it requires less time than classical hand washing, and act more rapidly. Social distancing measures are not realistic given the high density to which pilgrims are exposed at holy sites.87\nTransmission of respiratory pathogens at the Hajj Muslim pilgrimage in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia is highly frequent, resulting in high acquisition rates of virus and bacteria carriage. The Hajj may, therefore, contribute to the globalization of common respiratory pathogens resulting from the cross-contamination of participants harboring pathogens that easily spread among pilgrims. Numerous viral and bacterial clinical infections of the upper and lower respiratory tract do occur during the pilgrimage leading to a high number of in- and outpatients in Saudi medical structures. Over the past 10 years, the emergence of several viruses including influenza AH1N1, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-CoV, and MERS-CoV have been a great concern for the international medical community.5 However, no major outbreaks have occurred at the Hajj, up to now. We must remember that aside from the highly publicized exotic and emerging pathogens, we must be alert to the circulation of common pathogens, which silently cause much more casualties than the exotic newcomers which occupy the forefront of the stage and get all the headlines.88\n",

Almost all measles outbreaks at MGs have occurred among unvaccinated or incompletely vaccinated individuals.84 However, the effectiveness of vaccination in this context remains to be evaluated. It is also noticeable that many outbreaks occurring at MGs result in international spread of communicable diseases.",

This is likely because the crowd density is much lower and because collective housing is not common at these events. Large music festivals, by contrast, share some characteristics with the Hajj regarding crowd density and housing conditions in tent camps. The younger age of the participants at music festivals likely account for the distinct pattern of pathogens responsible for outbreaks in this context, compared to that of the Hajj.89 Other large religious MGs, like the Kumb Mela, have been poorly studied and the data concerning the health status of the pilgrims and potential health risks are scarce.90\n",

Large multinational cohort surveys are needed to better assess the risk of respiratory pathogens acquisition at MGs. The role of host factor including vaccination status, underlying chronic diseases age, and so on, and the role of environmental factors on the transmission of viruses and bacteria also warrant investigation. Interventional studies addressing the effectiveness of preventive measures are needed. The results of these studies will allow the implementation of evidence-based recommendations on prevention strategy including notably vaccination, hand hygiene, and face mask use. Investigations are also needed to evaluate the relationship link between communication and behavior in order to better adapt preventive message according to needs of specific communities.",
