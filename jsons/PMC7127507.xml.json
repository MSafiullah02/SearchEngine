HBV belongs to the Hepadnaviridae family and is a non-cytopathic DNA virus that can replicate via reverse-transcription of an RNA intermediate.1 The pregenomic RNA (pgRNA) intermediate is produced inside the cellular nucleus. Next, the pgRNA is exported to the cytoplasm, where a virally-encoded polymerase can then convert the pgRNA into minus-strand DNA; ultimately, a double-stranded, relaxed circular DNA molecule is generated.2, 3 This life cycle places HBV into the larger family of retroviruses, which are characterized by the reverse-transcription activity involving an RNA intermediate.",

In Compound 1, the polyoxoanion [SiW9Nb3O40]6\u2212 exhibits a well-known Keggin structure, which is quite similar to that found in other previously described POMs14, 15 (Fig. 1\n). The central Si atom is surrounded by a tetrahedron with oxygen vertices that are each linked to one of the M3O13 (M = W, Nb) groups. Each M3O13 consists of three MO6 octahedra linked in a triangular arrangement with shared edges, and the four M3O13 units are linked together by their corners. In the polyoxoanion, there exist three sites with occupancy disorder in the W4, W5, W6 centers; that is, Nb1 and W4, Nb2 and W5, and W6 and Nb3 atoms share the same site with 50% occupancy, respectively, forming the polyoxoanion [SiW9Nb3O40]6\u2212. The Si\u2013O bond distance is in the range of 1.57(9) to 1.60(6) \u00c5.
