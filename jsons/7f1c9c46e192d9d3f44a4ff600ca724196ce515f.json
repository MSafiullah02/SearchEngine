The divergence time of these two types has been estimated to be about 1980 from epidemiological data. This suggested that PRRSV have evolved at a higher evolutionary rate (order of 10 \u00ff2 /site/year) compared with other RNA viruses of 10 \u00ff3 to 10 \u00ff5 /site/year. Here, to test the evolutionary history of PRRSV speculated by the epidemiological background, we estimated the divergence time and evolutionary rate of PRRSV with molecular evolutionary analysis. Estimated divergence time (1972)(1973)(1974)(1975)(1976)(1977)(1978)(1979)(1980)(1981)(1982)(1983)(1984)(1985)(1986)(1987)(1988) corresponded well to that estimated by the epidemiological data, and the evolutionary rate (4.71-9.8) 3 10 \u00ff2 of PRRSV was indeed the highest among RNA viruses so far reported. Furthermore, we inferred important sites for the adaptation in order to examine how PRRSV have adapted to swine since they emerged. The adaptive sites were located not only in the epitopes related to immunity but also in the transmembrane regions including a signal peptide. In particular, the adaptive sites in the transmembrane regions were considered to affect compatibility to the host cell membrane.

The important genes for viral adaptation to the host are usually considered to be those encoding the proteins located in the outside of the virion, where they interacted with the environment, including the host immune system. In PRRSV, there are nine open reading frames (ORFs).

In the present study, in order to construct a phylogenetic tree of Nidovirales and to estimate the evolutionary position of PRRSV, we used the amino acid sequences of ORF1b because ORF1b was reported to be conserved among the order Nidovirales (Bredenbeek 1990; Snijder and Meulenberg 1998) . The ORF1b sequences for transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV), human corona virus (HcoV), murine hepatitis virus (MHV), bovine coronavirus (BCV), avian infectious bronchitis virus (AIBV), Berne virus (BEV), equine arteritis virus (EAV), lactate dehydrogenase-elevating virus (LDEV), simian hemorrhagic fever virus (SHFV), PRRSV-A, and PRRSV-E were collected from the International Nucleotide Sequence Database (INSD: DNA Data Bank of Japan/ European Molecular Biology Laboratory/GenBank).

To investigate support for these hypotheses, we compared the rate of replication error with the synonymous substitution rate among five RNA viruses, including PRRSV, as shown in table 2. In table 2, the replication error rate of PRRSV was estimated as follows. We first estimated the error rate per passage from the number of nucleotide substitutions occurring among passages (Yuan et al. 2001) . Then, the replication error rate was estimated by the passage error rate divided by the time required for viral budding (Dea et al. 1995) .

Therefore, the positive selection of the membrane regions in ORF5 is considered to be important for adaptation of PRRSV to the membrane of swine cells. In fact, PRRSV emerged so suddenly in swine only about 20 years ago and may have not yet adapted completely to swine cells.
