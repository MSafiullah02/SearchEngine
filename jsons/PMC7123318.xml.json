            "text": "It is now well recognized that more than 75 % of emerging diseases over the past 2\u20133 decades have been zoonoses. Many of these zoonotic viruses have arisen from wildlife sources and caused neurological disease, especially those emerging during this period in the Asian and Australasian regions (Mackenzie et al. 2001; Mackenzie 2005; Griffin 2010; Bale 2012; Wang and Crameri 2014). Most of the diseases emerging from wildlife have been from bats and rodents (Enria and Pinheiro 2000; Calisher et al. 2006; Goeijenbier et al. 2013; Luis et al. 2013). Bats are only second to rodents in terms of mammalian species richness (Wilson and Reeder 2005) and constitute about 20 % of all mammalian species. Thus, with their wide distribution and abundance, it is not surprising that there is growing awareness that bats are the reservoir hosts for a number of these emerging viruses (Calisher et al. 2006; van der Poel et al. 2006; Wong et al. 2007; Halpin et al. 2007; Wood et al. 2012; Smith and Wang 2013; Shi 2013) and suspected of being associated with many others on serological grounds. Not only have they been shown to be the reservoir hosts for rabies and related lyssaviruses but also for other human pathogens, or potential pathogens, such as SARS-coronavirus-like viruses (Lau et al. 2005; Li et al. 2005; Shi and Hu 2008), Ebola and Marburg viruses (Leroy et al. 2005; Gonzalez et al. 2007; Towner et al. 2007, 2009; Mar\u00ed Sa\u00e9z et al. 2014; Olival and Hayman 2014; Ogawa et al. 2015), Menangle virus (Philbey et al. 1998), and Hendra and Nipah viruses (Young et al. 1996; Halpin et al. 2000; Yob et al. 2001; Chua et al. 2002). This brief review looks at the biological features that make bats good reservoir hosts, and the more important neurological viruses associated with bats that are, or have the potential to be, transmitted to humans.",

Historically, the mammalian Order Chiroptera has been divided into two suborders, the Megachiroptera, or Old World fruit bats, including flying-foxes, and the Microchiroptera, or echolocating bats (Simmons and Conway 2003). Taxonomic methods based on morphological cladistics of cochlea structure among Eocene fossil bats, complemented by some molecular data, led Simmons and colleagues to the conclusion that echolocation, originating secondary to flight, evolved only once and that the echolocating microchiropteran bats are monophyletic (Simmons and Conway 2003). Based on this study the 188 species of megachiropteran bats were grouped within a single family, Pteropodidae, and the other 917 species of bats were divided into 18 families.",

These data suggest that the grouping of all echolocating bats into the suborder Microchiroptera is unwarranted and new suborders of bats have been adopted; the Pteropodiformes contains the Pteropodidae, Rhinolophidae, Hipposideridae, Rhinopomatidae, Craseonycteridae, and Megadermatidae, while the suborder Vespertilioniformes contains the other 12 families formerly of the Microchiroptera (Springer 2013). Within this review we will use the suborder terms Megachiroptera and Microchiroptera as these are the most familiar to many nonspecialists.",

The Chiroptera underwent rapid speciation with at least 24 genera of bats extant by the Eocene [52\u201350 million years ago (Simmons and Conway 2003; Teeling et al. 2005)]. The divergence of the Megachiroptera and Microchiroptera, irrespective of suborder status, occurred well prior to the oldest fossil record from the Eocene. Although the evolution of flight may have preceded echolocation, fossil remains from the Eocene indicate echolocation was well established (Simmons and Geisler 1998; Simmons et al. 2010). Following the early evolution of flight and echolocation, bats have changed little as a taxonomic group relative to other mammals (Jepsen 1970). Bats also have traits (e.g., flight, sheltered roosts and ability to hibernate and entire torpor) which may have allowed them to preferentially survive the Cretaceous-Tertiary (K\u2013T) extinction, occurring ~65 million years ago following the impact of the large bolide creating the 180\u2013300-km-wide Chicxulub crater in northern Yucatan, Mexico (for more details see Wang et al. 2011a).",

Unlike birds which may migrate long distances without feeding, bats forage as they migrate. Locally abundant, but widely distributed fruit resources, may serve to aggregate species of bats and other terrestrial fruit-eating mammals, such as great apes and ungulates, at feeding sites thus potentially enhancing the risk of intra- and interspecific transmission of viruses. Temporary seasonal clustering of bats and terrestrial mammals during dry seasons in Africa has been proposed as a means of promoting interspecific transmission of Ebola virus from a putative fruit bat reservoir host (Leroy et al. 2005) to other species (Pinzon et al. 2004).",

A variant of rabies virus maintained by the silver-backed bat, Lasionycterus noctivagans, and the eastern pipistrelle bat, , and known as the Ln/Ps variant (Franka et al. 2006), has been the most commonly recognized cause of indigenously acquired human rabies in North America over the last few decades (Noah et al. 1998; Messenger et al. 2003b; Rupprecht and Gibbons 2004). The summer and winter range of L. noctivagans in North America extends from central Canada to the southern United States (Rohde et al. 2004) overlapping the distribution of human rabies cases associated with the LN/PS variant. Phylogenetic studies of European bat lyssavirus subgroup 1a (EBLV-1a) suggest that virus trafficking between migratory bat species and the sedentary Eptesicus serotinus, a principal reservoir host, has contributed to the genetic homogeneity observed among EBLV-1a isolates (Davis et al. 2005b). Within a bat species, such as T. brasiliensis, both sedentary and migratory populations may exist and intermingle seasonally (Cockrum 1969; McCraken and Gassel 1998), providing a mechanism for viruses exchange and introduction.\n",

The presence of neutralizing antibody among apparently healthy bats and the delayed development of rabies among captured bats has been interpreted as suggesting recovery from or prolonged incubation following infection (Moore and Raymond 1970; Trimarchi and Debbie 1977). Decreased rabies virus pathogenicity has been inferred by subjecting experimentally infected bats (Myotis lucifugus, T. brasiliensis, and Anthrozous pallidus) to low temperatures (4\u201310 \u00b0C) and then observing the onset of rabies after transferring animals to temperatures of 22\u201329 \u00b0C (Sulkin and Allen 1974; Sulkin et al. 1959; Sadler and Enright 1959). In a mathematical model of rabies persistence in a colony of big brown bats (Eptesicus fuscus) during hibernation, a long incubation period played a significant role in maintaining dormant infection.

Specifically, there seems to be a trend of high basal level expression of genes involved in innate defense mechanisms (L-F Wang, unpublished results).",

The evolution of flight has been linked to immunologically important concentrations of positively selected genes in the DNA damage checkpoint and nuclear factor kB pathways (Zhang et al. 2013). Additionally, the high metabolic cost of flying requires an increased body temperature and it has been hypothesized that flight may play a role in increasing the tolerance of bats to adverse effects of viral infections in a way analogous to fever in other mammals and that flight in bats has selected for the acquisition of a diversity of viruses that may cause disease when transmitted to other mammals (O\u2019Shea et al. 2014).",

However, viruses within individual genera of this family can exhibit exquisite host specification as exemplified by the 14 viruses currently classified within or proposed as members of the genus Lyssavirus (Table 1). The antigenic and genetic profiles of lyssaviruses allow segregation into phylogroups (see Fig. 1). Antibodies raised experimentally in mice against inactivated virus from one phylogroup neutralize viruses within that phylogroup but not others. With the exception of Mokola virus and Ikoma lyssavirus, each of the representative genotypes of lyssaviruses has been isolated from bats which are also believed to serve as their reservoir hosts. There is a complex relationship between lyssaviruses and bats where the viruses may cause clinical disease in bats or may circulate in the bat population without any overt disease (Banyard et al. 2011). There is also increasing evidence that rabies-related viruses are found throughout much of Africa, Europe, Asia, and Australia, but not in the Americas, whereas rabies virus is found in bats only in the Americas (Table 1). Transmission of lyssaviruses from bats to species of other mammalian orders, a process termed \u201cspillover,\u201d can cause fatal neurological disease among humans and other animals. The term rabies was once strictly reserved for the acute fatal encephalomyelitis caused by classical rabies virus. However, the clinical disease of rabies is now widely used to include the clinically and pathologically indistinguishable diseases caused by any Lyssavirus (Meredith et al. 1971; Lumio et al. 1986; Samaratunga et al. 1998; Nathwani et al. 2003; Fooks et al. 2003a; Banyard et al. 2011).\n",

An additional possible member of the genus has also been described from a bat in Spain, and named Lleida virus (Ar\u00e9chiga Ceballos et al. 2013). The viruses in each of the phylogroups vary in their virulence (Markotter et al. 2009; Kgaladi et al. 2013a). Specific vaccines and immunoglobulins only exist for the pre- or postexposure treatment (PET) of phylogroup I rabies virus (Anon 1999a), however, these vaccines elicit high levels of neutralizing antibodies to other phylogroup I lyssaviruses (Brookes et al. 2005b). Immunization of laboratory animals with rabies vaccine with subsequent challenge with other lyssaviruses indicates that diminishing efficacy is a function of increasing phylogenetic distance from rabies virus (Hanlon et al. 2005).",

The first observation linking bats to rabies was made in 1911 when the common vampire bat (Desmodus rotundus) was identified as the source of an epidemic of rabies among cattle in Brazil (Carini 1911). Human deaths attributed to bites received from vampire bats were first recorded from the island of Trinidad (Hurst and Pawan 1959; Pawan 1959). Outbreaks of human rabies due to vampire bats continue to be reported from Brazil (Batista-da-Costa et al. 1993; Sato et al. 2006), Costa Rica (Badilla et al. 2003), Peru (Lopez et al. 1992), Venezuela (Caraballo 1996), and Mexico (Martinez-Burnes et al. 1997; Velasco-Villa et al. 2006).",

Since that time, the number of rabid bats reported to CDC has increased, reaching 1680 in 2012, second in number only to raccoons (Dyer et al. 2013). The majority of indigenously acquired human rabies cases in North America over the past three decades have been caused by bat-associated variants (Messenger et al. 2003a, b). More than 30 species of North American bats have been identified as naturally infected by rabies virus (Constantine 1979; Mondul et al. 2003) and the number of bat species found to be infected in Mexico and in South America is rapidly growing (Nadin-Davis and Loza-Rubio 2006; Velasco-Villa et al. 2006; Escobar et al. 2015). Distinct virus variants of rabies virus may be associated with one or more bat species and research into species specificity and the evolution of bat-associated rabies virus is rapidly changing our knowledge-base on this subject (Hughes et al. 2005; Davis et al. 2006). Rabies virus has not been isolated from bats outside North, Central, and South America (Banyard et al. 2011).",

            "text": "\nRabies virus variants circulating among bats are currently divided into four major groups and several additional subgroups (Nadin-Davis et al. 2001; Davis et al. 2006). Group I (four subgroups) contains virus variants primarily originating from highly colonial, migratory bats of the genera Myotis and Eptesicus, and are endemic to eastern Canada and the United States as far west as the State of Colorado (Davis et al. 2006). Group II (two subgroups) contains variants primarily originating from solitary or moderately colonial, migratory species of the genera Lasiurus and Pipistrellus and L. noctivagans, and are endemic to Canada and most of the United States; included here is a virus variant isolated from L. noctivagans and P. subflavus (Ln/Ps) which is the most common variant recovered from indigenously acquired human rabies in North America (Messenger et al. 2003b). Group III contains variants from Eptesicus fuscus, genetically distinct from group I, and is restricted to western Canada and the western United States (Nadin-Davis et al. 2001; Davis et al. 2006). Group IV (three subgroups) contains variants originating from colonial species of hematophagous bats and insectivorous bats from Central and South America. Various subgroups and paraphyletic clades within groups preclude making unequivocal statements concerning the endemic range and bat species infected by a particular group of viruses at this time (Davis et al. 2006). As additional samples become available and full genome sequencing is undertaken, finer resolution of phylogenetic relationships between virus variants and individual species can be achieved, as exemplified by recent studies of rabies virus from the genus Pipistrellus and L. noctivagans; the LN/PS variant may be two independently maintained rabies virus variants with distinct hosts (Franka et al. 2006).",

The first isolate of LBV was obtained from a fruit bat in Nigeria in 1956 (Boulger and Porterfield 1958) and since that time additional isolates have been obtained from various species of fruit bats from Central African Republic, Egypt, Senegal, South Africa, Ghana, and Zimbabwe (Sureau et al. 1977; Meredith and Standing 1981; Crick et al. 1982; Markotter et al. 2006b); from single cats in South Africa and Zimbabwe (Crick et al. 1982; King and Crick 1988); and a dog in Ethiopia (Mebatsion et al. 1992). Indeed LBV may be the most common rabies-like virus in Africa and serological evidence has shown that it occurs throughout the range of the straw-colored fruit bat, Eidolon helvum, even in more isolated island colonies (Peel et al. 2013). DUVV has only been isolated a few times, with most isolates obtained from human infections and single isolates from two insectivorous bats, Miniopterus schreibersi and Nycteris thebaica (Paweska et al. 2006; Nel and Rupprecht 2007). SHIBV was isolated from a dead Commerson\u2019s leaf-nosed bat (Hipposideros commersoni) in Kenya (Kuzmin et al. 2010).",

The recent case of fatal EBLV-2 infection in a Scottish bat conservationist was the first indigenously acquired case of rabies in the UK in 100 years (Nathwani et al. 2003). A photographer infected with EBLV-1 after a bite from a disoriented E. serotinus bat in Spain recovered due to previous immunization with rabies vaccine, as well as postexposure immunization (Van Gucht et al. 2013). EBLV-1 has been recovered from terrestrial mammals, five sheep in Denmark (Ronsholt 2002; Tjornehoj et al. 2006) and a stone marten (Martes foina) in Germany (Muller et al. 2004), and in captive zoo Egyptian fruit bats (R. aegyptiacus) in Denmark (Ronsholt et al. 1998), but spillover is either rare or goes undetected. It is possible that the virulence of ELBVs is lower than that of some other lyssaviruses; experimental inoculation of EBLV-1 into red foxes (Vulpes vulpes) and sheep has resulted in death in only one of 14 sheep (Soria Baltazar et al. 1988; Vos et al. 2004; Tjornehoj et al. 2006). Furthermore, ELBV-1 was detected in a range of tissues from apparently healthy bats (Schreiber\u2019s bent-winged bats, Miniopterus schreibersii, and greater horseshoe bats, Rhinolophus ferrumequinum) in Spain (Serra-Cobo et al. 2002) and in healthy zoo fruit bats (R. aegyptiacus) (Wellenberg et al. 2002), showing that bats may survive infection with possible long-term maintenance of the virus in infected healthy animals. There have been no reported spillover cases of EBLV-2 into either wild or domestic animals.",

While Rhabdoviruses of the genus Ephemerovirus were known to occur, Australia had historically been considered free of lyssaviruses. However, St George (1989), postulating the origins of Adelaide River virus, an ephemerovirus antigenically related to rabies, had previously suggested the possibility of an undiscovered rabies-like virus in Australian bats, reflecting that the typically low prevalences of lyssaviruses in bats meant that an Australian bat lyssavirus might not become evident unless active surveillance of bats was undertaken, or unless man or a domestic animal became infected. Notwithstanding marked antigenic and genetic similarities to rabies virus, Australian bat lyssavirus is phylogenetically distinct, and represents a new lyssavirus genotype (Hooper et al. 1997; Gould et al. 1998).",

However, the ecology of ABLV is yet to be fully understood. Field (2005) found serological evidence of infection in numerous other bat species across five families, indicating that the bat\u2013virus relationship is mature, and that additional variants may exist. Barrett (2004) reported a statistical association between species, age and health status and ABLV infection in bats, noting that most FAT-positive bats had a clinical history of generalized paresis, with a small number overtly aggressive, and others clinically indistinguishable from FAT-negative bats.",

            "text": "Transmission of bat-associated lyssaviruses occurs primarily by bite, when virus present in the saliva of an infected individual is directly inoculated into a susceptible individual. The potential for non-bite transmission of rabies virus among bats through saliva exchanged during mutual grooming has been suggested; transmission by such a mechanism may have precipitated an epidemic of rabies among kudu (Tragelaphus strepsiceros), an African ungulate (Barnard et al. 1982). Mexican free-tailed bats may transmit rabies virus in utero, as virus isolates have been obtained from cell lines established with fetal tissue (Steece and Calisher 1989). Airborne transmission of rabies virus was suggested as the possible event leading to two cases of rabies in humans visiting a cave harboring millions Mexican free-tailed bats (Irons et al. 1957; Humphrey et al. 1960). In subsequent experiments, a number of caged animals placed within caves developed rabies, and rabies virus has been isolated from air sampled from these same caves (Constantine 1967b, c; Winkler 1968). Experimental aerosol infection of mice with RABV and EBLV-2 found that mice were highly susceptible to infection by inhalation whereas ELBV-2 required direct intranasal inoculation (Johnson et al. 2006). Most recently, laboratory mice and wild-caught big brown bats (E. fuscus) and Mexican free-tailed bats were exposed to aerosolized rabies virus. All the bats and some of the mice survived exposure and produced rabies neutralizing antibody, but this antibody provided poor protection for the bats to a subsequent challenge with rabies virus 6 months later (Davis et al. 2007). Corneal transplants have been the source of human-to-human transmission of rabies virus on several occasions (Houff et al. 1979; Anon 1980, 1981; Gode and Bhide 1988), and tissues transplanted from an individual infected by a bat-associated rabies virus variant caused multiple deaths among recipients in the United States (Srinivasan et al. 2005). Most human rabies cases caused by bat-associated variants of rabies virus have involved \u201ccryptic\u201d exposures, as patients or family members often cannot provide a positive history of bat bite (Noah et al. 1998; Gibbons 2002; Messenger et al. 2003b; Franka et al. 2006).",

            "text": "Understanding of the epidemiology and mechanisms of persistence of lyssavirus infection in bat populations is limited, but progress is being made through a combination of collection of field data and epidemiological modeling. Given the wide variation in life histories of different bat species, there may be significant variation in mechanisms of viral persistence in different situations. A study by George et al. (2011) of RABV in big brown bats (E. fuscus) in Colorado suggested that the slowing effects of hibernation on viral activity until susceptible individuals from the annual birth pulse become infected allows infection to maintain in the population. The persistence of EBLV-1 was investigated in a system involving multiple bat species which do not hibernate and it was found interspecies transmission was important for maintenance of infection in some species (Pons-Salort et al. 2014). Another study of LBV in a single species, Eidolon helvum, where hibernation is also absent, found a lack of increased mortality in seropositive animals suggesting infection did not result in disease after extended incubation (Hayman et al. 2012). This may suggest acute transmission of bat lyssaviruses in adapted bat hosts occurs at a much higher rate than the occurrence of disease.",

            "text": "In September 1994, an outbreak of acute respiratory disease of unknown etiology occurred in thoroughbred horses in a training complex in Brisbane (Queensland, Australia) (Murray et al. 1995). The syndrome was characterized by severe respiratory signs and high mortality, with 13 horses dying from acute disease. The trainer and a stable-hand suffered a concurrent severe febrile illness, with a fatal outcome for the trainer. Quarantine procedures and movement restrictions were applied, including a complete shutdown of the racing industry, and epidemiological investigations commenced (Baldock et al. 1996). The causal agent was shown to be a previously undescribed virus of the family , and initially named equine morbillivirus (EMV), but it was later renamed Hendra virus (after the Brisbane suburb where the outbreak occurred) when further characterization identified features inconsistent with morbilliviruses (Wang et al. 2000). To the end of 2014, a total of 51 incidents involving 92 confirmed or suspected equine cases have been reported in the adjoining eastern Australian states of Queensland and New South Wales (Biosecurity Queensland 2014) (Table 2; Fig. 2). The majority of incidents consist of single cases, even though in-contact horses are typically present. Case fatality rate in horses is around 75 % (Field et al. 2011); to date, all non-fatally infected horses have been euthanased because of uncertainty of the risk of recrudesence. Seven human cases have been reported, four of which were fatal; all seven cases are attributed to close and direct contact with infected horses. Two canine cases have been reported, both of which were on equine case properties (Anon 2013).\n\n",

            "text": "A major outbreak of disease in pigs and humans occurred in peninsular Malaysia between September 1998 and April 1999, resulting in the death of 106 of 265 reported human cases and the culling of over one million pigs (Chua et al. 1999, 2000; Nor et al. 2000). The outbreak spread to Singapore where a cluster of 11 cases with one death occurred at an abattoir (Paton et al. 1999). Initially attributed to Japanese encephalitis virus, the etiological agent was eventually shown to be another previously undescribed virus of the family Paramyxoviridae closely related to Hendra virus (Anon 1999b). The Malaysia outbreak primarily impacted pig and human populations, although horses, dogs, and cats were also infected. No cases of Nipah virus have been recorded in Malaysia since 1999. The disease reappeared, however, with multiple human cases diagnosed in Bangladesh in 2001 (Anon 2003). Near-annual seasonal clusters of human Nipah virus infections have been recorded in Bangladesh since (Anon 2004a, b, 2005; Hsu et al. 2004; Luby et al. 2006; Kulkarni et al. 2013; M Rahman, personal communication 2015) and occasionally in West Bengal (Chadha et al. 2006; Arankalle et al. 2011) (Table 3). In contrast to Malaysia where the majority of cases were restricted to areas where pig farming was common, the Bangladesh cases do not usually involve a domestic animal cycle (Epstein et al. 2006), and occur over a wide geographic area (Fig. 3). Food-borne transmission via date palm sap contaminated with bat saliva or bat urine is believed to be the major route of transmission (Epstein et al. 2006; Luby et al. 2006, 2009a; Rahman et al. 2012; Luby and Gurley 2012), although human-to-human transmission may also occur relatively frequently (Epstein et al. 2006; Gurley et al. 2007; Luby et al. 2009a, b; Luby and Gurley 2012).\n\n",

            "text": "Initial nucleotide sequences of the matrix (M) and fusion (F) proteins genes established that Hendra virus had a greater homology with known morbilliviruses than with other genera of the family Paramyxoviridae (Gould 1996), but the sequence comparisons also revealed substantial divergence with other morbilliviruses. Subsequent sequencing of the entire genome confirmed Hendra virus as a member of the subfamily Paramyxovirinae, but identified differences that supported the creation of a new genus. Hendra virus had a larger genome size, the replacement of a highly conserved sequence in the L protein gene, different genome end sequences, and other sequence and molecular features (Wang et al. 2000). After the characterization of the Nipah virus genome, \u201cHenipavirus\u201d was proposed as the new genus, with Hendra virus the type species and Nipah virus the second member. The ICTV has formally recognized the genus Henipavirus, and the virus names, Hendra virus and Nipah virus. In recent years, at least three henipa-like viruses have been identified. These are the Cedar virus from an Australian flying fox (Marsh et al. 2012), the African bat paramyxovirus M74a from Ghana (Drexler et al. 2012), and the Mojiang virus from rats in China (Wu et al. 2014). Although their formal classification into the genus Henipavirus is yet to be confirmed, their close phylogenetic relationship with Hendra and Nipah viruses strongly support this putative classification (Fig. 4).\n",

Following the identification of a second Hendra virus outbreak in horses near the city of Mackay (1000 km north of Brisbane), the focus of the wildlife surveillance shifted to species that were common to both locations and capable of moving between locations. Mammal species were given a higher priority than avian species. Of 27 flying foxes from two species tested in an initial survey, 40 % had anti-Hendra virus neutralizing antibodies (Field 2005), and in September 1996, 2 years after the first reported outbreak, virus was isolated from a grey-headed flying fox (P. poliocephalus) (Halpin et al. 2000). A concurrent survey of over 1000 flying foxes from the four mainland species (P. poliocephalus, P. Alecto, P. conspicillatus, and P. scapulatus) identified an estimated crude seroprevalence of 47 %. In a retrospective serological survey, antibodies neutralizing Hendra virus were identified in the sera of flying foxes collected in 1982 (Field 2005).",

Subsequent studies in Australia further elaborated the ecology of Hendra virus in pteropid bats (Plowright et al. 2008; Breed et al. 2011; Field et al. 2011). There is also evidence that some species may be more significant natural reservoirs than others (Smith et al. 2014; Goldspink et al. 2015; Edson D, Field HE, Broos et al. Routes of Hendra virus excretion in naturally infected flying-foxes: implications for viral transmission and equine spillover risk, submitted for publication), and that viral excretion in bats may be seasonal (Field HE, Jordan D, Melville D et al. Spatio-temporal aspects of Hendra virus infection in pteropid bats in eastern Australia, submitted for publication), which may explain the spatiotemporal occurrence of Hendra virus spillover events and inform risk management strategies. Subsequent studies in Malaysia (Rahman et al. 2010, 2013; Sohaytati et al. 2011) and Bangladesh (Epstein et al. 2008; Khan et al. 2010; Hahn et al. 2014a, b) have elaborated the ecology of NiV in bats.

            "text": "There is little doubt that pteropid bats are major reservoir hosts of Hendra and Nipah viruses (Field et al. 2007), and it is not surprising that additional related viruses have now been detected throughout their range, which extends from the west Indian Ocean islands of Mauritius, Madagascar, and Pemba Island, along the sub-Himalayan region of Pakistan and India, through southeast Asia, The Philippines, Indonesia, to the southwest Pacific islands and Australia. There are about 60 species in total. Flying-foxes range in body weight from 300 g to over 1 kg, and in wingspan from 600 mm to 1.7 m. They are the largest bats in the world, do not echolocate, and navigate at night by eyesight and their keen sense of smell. All species eat fruits, flowers or pollen, and roost communally in trees. Flying foxes are nomadic species, capable of traveling distances of hundreds of kilometers. Where the distributions of different species overlap, roosts are shared (Hall and Richards 2000; Corbet and Hill 1992; Mickleburgh et al. 1992; Nowak 1994). Thus the potential exists for interaction between flying fox populations across much of their global distribution. Recent reports of henipa-like virus detections in non-pteropid and in other mega bat species suggest that the bat\u2013virus relationship may be even more ancient (Li et al. 2008; Croser and Marsh 2013).",

They contend that information about the natural history of most viruses in bats is limited, and specifically in relation to the family Pteropodidae, that only half of the 64 genera in this family (which includes flying foxes) have been adequately studied. Thus we know relatively little about the bats from which the henipaviruses have emerged. Calisher et al. (2006) pose a number of questions in relation to the role of bats and emerging zoonoses. Do bats possess special attributes that equip them to host highly pathogenic zoonoses? Are emergences such as Hendra and Nipah viruses infrequent and incidental events, or are we detecting only the tip of the iceberg? They conclude by calling for pre-emptive potential pathogen screening in wildlife, rather than the outbreak-response surveillance that typically occurs currently.",

Clinical signs included fever, facial swelling, severe respiratory distress, ataxia, and terminally, copious frothy (sometimes blood-tinged) nasal discharge.

A further three horses were subsequently found to have seroconverted in the absence of obvious clinical signs (Baldock et al. 1996). A small number of horses in the stable remained unaffected. A second Hendra virus outbreak in horses was retrospectively diagnosed in October 1995 after the Hendra virus-attributed death of a farmer who suffered a relapsing encephalitic disease. This second incident (1000 km north of Brisbane) chronologically preceded the Brisbane outbreak by several weeks, and resulted in the death of two horses, a 10 year old heavily pregnant thoroughbred mare and a 2 year old colt in an adjoining paddock, after a 24 h clinical course (Rogers et al. 1996; Hooper et al. 1996).

Herd-level infection was typically subclinical, with estimated morbidity and mortality rates of 30 % and 5 %, respectively (Nor et al. 2000). The incubation period was estimated to be 7\u201314 days. Observations of clinical cases suggested a varying presentation in different classes of animals. Affected weaners and porkers (2\u20136 months) typically showed acute febrile illness with respiratory signs ranging from rapid and labored breathing to harsh nonproductive cough. Attributed neurological signs included trembling, twitching, muscular spasms, rear leg weakness and variable lameness or spastic paresis. Adult sows and boars typically suffered a peracute or acute febrile illness with labored breathing (panting), increased salivation and serous, mucopurulent or blood-tinged nasal discharge. Neurological signs including agitation and head pressing, tetanus-like spasms and seizures, Nystagmus, champing of mouth, and apparent pharyngeal muscle paralysis were observed. The primary means of spread between farms and between regions was the movement of pigs. The primary mode of transmission on-farm was likely oro-nasal. Secondary modes of transmission between farms within local farming communities may have included roaming infected dogs and cats. Evidence of infection (virus isolation, immunohistochemistry, serology) and neurologic disease was found in dogs and horses in the outbreak area (Nor et al. 2000). Transmission studies in pigs in Australia at the CSIRO Australian Animal Health Laboratory established that pigs could be infected orally and by parenteral inoculation, and that infection could spread quickly to in-contact pigs. Neutralizing antibodies were detectable 10\u201314 days postinfection (Middleton et al. 2002). In a related study, experimental infection in cats caused neurological disease (Middleton et al. 2002).",

Mathematical modeling supports the hypothesis that at least one spillover event occurred before the 1998\u20131999 outbreak, and that a level of residual immunity in sows provided the right herd immunological conditions for infection to become endemic in the pig index case farm in 1998, thus providing a sustained reservoir of virus from which to infect other farms (Daszak et al. 2006; Pulliam et al. 2012).",

            "text": "At least 105 people died during the course of the Malaysian outbreak. The majority of human cases had a history of direct contact with live pigs. Most were adult male Chinese pig-farmers (Chua et al. 1999; Parashar et al. 2000). Identified risk factors for human infection in Malaysia were activities requiring direct contact with pigs, with handling sick pigs and assisting with birthing posing the highest risks. Clinical presentation of Nipah virus cases is given in more detail in section \u201cHenipaviruses,\u201d and only briefly described below. Most patients presented with acute encephalitis characterized by fever, headache, myalgia, disorientation, dizziness, vomiting and more than 50 % had a reduced level of consciousness (Chua et al. 1999; Goh et al. 2000). The major clinical signs included areflexia, segmental myoclonus, tachycardia, hypertension, pin-point pupils, and an abnormal doll\u2019s eye reflex. Most patients who survived acute encephalitis made a full recovery, but about 20 % had residual neurological deficits (Goh et al. 2000; Chong et al. 2002; Lim et al. 2003). Neurological sequelae included cognitive difficulties, tetraparesis, cerebellar signs, nerve palsies, and clinical depression. A number of patients developed relapse encephalitis or late onset encephalitis. About 7.5 % of patients who recovered from acute encephalitis and 3.4 % of those who experienced nonencephalitic or asymptomatic infection developed late neurological disease, presenting several months to 4 years after the initial infection (Goh et al. 2000; Tan et al. 2002). The mortality rate associated with relapse and late onset encephalitis was 18 % which was lower than the 40 % associated with acute encephalitis. However, 61 % of patients with relapse or late onset had further neurological sequelae compared with 22 % after acute encephalitis. The occurrence and frequency of clinically undetected Nipah virus infections was also notable: 6 % of persons from farms without reported encephalitis cases, and 11 % of persons from farms with reported encephalitis cases. In addition, 8 % of cases reported no contact with pigs (Parashar et al. 2000). Clinical presentation of human cases in Bangladesh and West Bengal, India, has typically been similar to that in Malaysia: fever, central nervous system signs, and a high case fatality rate (Luby et al. 2006, 2009a, b; Homaira et al. 2010a, b). Notably, a cluster of cases in the Faridpur district in 2004 exhibited an acute respiratory distress syndrome (Anon 2004b), and nosocomial and corpse to human transmission has been reported (Sazzad et al. 2013).",

Early studies found that high titers of virus could be detected in the brains of microchiropteran bats infected by intracerebral inoculation, and although the titers were as high as found in fatal murine infection, the bats appeared free from disease (Ito and Saito 1952). Early studies also demonstrated that bats infected subcutaneously were capable of maintaining a latent infection with JEV in simulated hibernation for as long as 107 days, and mosquito\u2013bat\u2013mosquito transmission was successful at room temperature, and at 10 \u00b0C in simulated cave situations (La Motte 1958), thus making bats potential maintenance hosts of JE virus and participants in wildlife transmission cycles. These very early findings led to some extensive and elegant investigations by Sulkin, Allen, and their colleagues (reviewed in Sulkin and Allen 1974). Their studies together with those of others showed that:Nearly 100 % of bats inoculated subcutaneously with small doses of virus developed viraemia within 24\u201372 h, and that some animals circulated virus for as long as 25\u201330 days at titers high enough to infect mosquitoesBats did not develop encephalitis despite significant virus titers in the brainFollowing subcutaneous inoculation, replication was demonstrated in the brown adipose tissue, and this tissue was able to sequester the virus in an inactive state during hibernation, and then seed virus to provide further viraemia once hibernation endedTransplacental transmission could readily be demonstrated, particularly in the latter stages of pregnancy, providing a mechanism for virus perpetuation in natureAnti-JEV antibody could not be reliably detected or measured by hemagglutination-inhibition, but only by neutralizationBats maintained at room temperature developed a viraemia in 2\u20133 days postinoculation in most animals which usually persisted for 10\u201315 days, and neutralizing antibodies developed in 3\u20137 weeksBats maintained at 37 \u00b0C developed a viraemia more rapidly than those at room temperature and reached higher titers, but the duration of viraemia was shorter and there was little evidence of replication in brown fat, brain or kidney, and neutralizing antibodies responses were fasterAbout 25 % of bats at both temperatures failed to develop neutralizing antibodies despite being shown to be viraemicStudies of field-caught bats collected in different seasons yielded 24 JE virus isolates (16 from 1139 M. schreibersii and 8 from 267 Rhinolophus cornutus), with a significant number of isolates coming from collected in the fallNeutralizing antibodies to JE were found in sera from 5 % of M. schreibersii and 9 % of R. cornutus\nIsolations of JE virus from bats was also extended to China (Taiwan) and one isolate was obtained from Hipposideros armiger, and two from M. schreibersii (it is interesting to note that 9 JE virus isolates were also obtained from Cx. annulus mosquitoes at the same time and cave as the latter M. schreibersii isolates)Neutralizing antibodies to JE virus were found in a number of other species of bats in Japan, including 21/79 R. ferrum-equinum, 9/72 Myotis macrodactylus, 4/25 Myotis mystacinus; 1/31 Pipistrellus abramus, 10/110 Vespertilio superans, and 1/22 Plecotus auritus\n\n",

Experimental infection has been studied in two species of fruit bat in India, Rousettus leschenaulti (Banerjee et al. 1979) and C. sphinx (Banerjee et al. 1984). The former study demonstrated a low level of viraemia after subcutaneous inoculation of JE virus lasting up to 9 days. In the latter study, bats were infected intramuscularly with JE virus and, during the subsequent viraemic phase, Cx. bitaeniorhynchus and Cx. tritaeniorhynchus mosquitoes were allowed to feed on them. Transmission was observed between bats, from bats to chickens, and from chickens to bats. Thus frugivorous bats are potential candidates for virus maintenance and may assist in virus movement.",

A number of isolates of SLEV were obtained from Mexican free-tailed bats during epizootic activity in Texas, and as isolations continued over winter months, these investigations indicated that SLEV could persist in this species (Allen et al. 1970). Experimental studies in Mexican free-tailed bats and big brown bats (Eptesicus fuscus) found that SLEV produced an intense and long-lasting viraemia in the Mexican free-tailed bats, and was maintained during hibernation in the big brown bats (Sulkin and Allen 1974; Herbold et al. 1983), providing further evidence of SLEV persistence in bats and suggesting a role for bats in virus spread and as potential wildlife reservoirs. Serological studies suggested that up to 9 % of big brown bats and little brown bats were seropositive for SLEV in a non-epizootic period, suggesting that these species are involved in the maintenance of SLEV in enzootic foci and could have a role in dissemination of SLEV to epizootic foci (Herbold et al. 1983). Serological evidence of SLEV in bats has been reported from Haiti (McLean et al. 1979) and Guatemala (Ubico and McLean 1995).",

Much of the evidence has come from serological data, but these are notoriously difficult to interpret because of cross-reacting antibodies to other members of the family from prior infections. Given these limitations, serological evidence of infection of bats with WNV has been reported from a number of countries (reviewed in Sulkin and Allen 1974), but there has only been a single report of virus isolation from a fruit bat, R. leschenaultia, in India (Paul et al. 1970). Interest in a possible role for bats in WNV transmission has increased since the emergence of WNV in North America, but although occasional bats have been found to have antibody to the virus including big brown bats, little brown bats, and Mexican free-tailed bats (Pilipski et al. 2004; Davis et al. 2005a; Bunde et al. 2006), there is no evidence to suggest they are involved in either transmission or persistence of the virus. Experimental infection has also suggested that big brown bats and Mexican free-tailed bats are unlikely to play a role as amplifying hosts of WNV (Davis et al. 2005a).",

The isolation of VEEV from wild-caught bats in Central and South America suggests that they may play a role in the ecology of VEEV. VEEV was isolated from single specimens of teapa fruit-eating bat (Artibeus turpis) and a gray short-tailed bat (Carollia subrufa) in Mexico, and experimental inoculation of Jamaican fruit bats (A. jamaicensus) resulted in viraemia as measured by infection of suckling mice (Scherer et al. 1971). VEEV has also been isolated from a vampire bat (Desmodus rotundus) in Mexico (Correa-Giron et al. 1972), a tent-making bat (Uroderma bilobatum) in Guatemala (Seymour et al. 1978), and a Seba\u2019s short-tailed bat (Carollia perspicillata) in Brazil (Calisher et al. 1982). More recently, seroepidemiological studies in Guatemala (Ubico and McLean 1995) and Trinidad (Thompson et al. 2015), using neutralization in the former study and epitope-blocking enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay in the latter study, found antibodies to VEEV in various species of bats: Artebeus sp., including Jamaican fruit bats; Carollia sp. including Seba\u2019s short-tailed bats, gray short-tailed bats, silky short-tailed bats (C. brevicauda); vampire bats; little yellow-shouldered bat (Sturnira lilium) and highland yellow-shouldered bat (S. ludovici); Pallas\u2019s long-tongued bat (Glossophaga soricine); and greater bulldog bat (Noctilio leporinus).

Subsequent investigations, however, showed that palm civets in farms and field were largely free from SARS-CoV infection (Tu et al. 2004; Kan et al. 2005), suggesting that palm civets played a role as intermediate host rather than as a natural reservoir. Surveillance studies have revealed the presence of a diverse group of coronaviruses in bats (Drexler et al. 2014) including some closely related to the SARS-CoV in genome organization and sequence, named SARS-like coronaviruses (SL-CoVs) or SARS-CoV-like viruses, in several horseshoe bat species in the genus Rhinolophus (Lau et al. 2005; Li et al. 2005). These discoveries raised the possibility that bats could be the natural reservoirs of SARS-CoV (Wang et al. 2006).",

This suggested that fecal-oral contact is probably the most likely route of transmission among bats and from bats to other wildlife animals. This also implied that direct contact between animals may not be a prerequisite for animal-to-animal transmission of this group of coronaviruses. Considering that bats and a diverse group of wildlife animals co-habitat in their natural environment (e.g., in caves) and that live bats are housed and traded with many different animals in live animal markets in Southern China and southeast Asian countries, there should be ample opportunities for fecal-oral transmission to occur.",

There was no evidence of any epidemiological link between these two cases, yet the viral strains obtained from the respiratory tract specimens of these two patients shared 99.5 % nucleotide identity. The virus was initially named HCoV-EMC/2012, later changed to MERS-CoV (Bermingham et al. 2012; de Groot et al. 2013; Zaki et al. 2012). By April 2015, at least 1106 laboratory-confirmed cases of MERS-CoV infection with at least 421 deaths have been reported to WHO. All primary human infections seem to have originated from Middle East, including United Arab Emirates, Qatar, Oman, Jordan, Kuwait, Yemen, Lebanon, and Iran. Travel-mediated secondary infections have been confirmed in a number of countries, including the United Kingdom, France, Tunisia, Italy, Malaysia, Philippines, Greece, Egypt, United States, Netherlands, and Algeria. Unlike the explosive nature of the SARS outbreaks in 2002\u20132003, which were believed to be resulted from a single or limited spillover event(s) from animal to human, followed by human-to-human transmission, the MERS outbreaks are characterized by multiple spillover events with non-sustained human-to-human transmission, most often in health care-associated settings with a few household clusters (Mailles et al. 2013; Chan et al. 2015).",

Phylogenetic analysis of different coronavirus genome sequences revealed that that MERS-CoV is most closely related to two Chinese bat coronavirus species in the genus Betacoronavirus. They are Tylonycteris bat coronavirus HKU4 (Ty-BtCoV-HKU4) and Pipistrellus bat coronavirus HKU5 (Pi-BtCoV-HKU5) first reported in 2007 (Woo et al. 2007). Furthermore, MERS-CoV related sequences were also detected in other species of bats in Europe, Africa, Central America, and Middle East (Chan et al. 2015). In one study, a short PCR fragment (182 nt) containing identical sequence to that of MERS-CoV was detected in Taphozous perforatus (Egyptian tomb bat) in Saudi Arabia (Memish et al. 2013), but due to the very short sequence obtained from a single bat specimen, this finding is generally considered inconclusive (Chan et al. 2015). To date, none of the bat CoVs detected is likely to be the direct ancestor of MERS-CoV (Lau et al. 2013). However, considering that the search for the close relative of SARS-CoV in bats took almost ten years to yield conclusive findings, it is too early to predict whether bats are the (original) source of MERS-CoV.",

Indeed a previously healthy Saudi man developed respiratory symptoms after caring for ill camels on a farm (Azhar et al. 2014; Memish et al. 2014), and virus isolated from a nasal swab from the patient was almost identical to an isolate from one of the sick camels in their genome sequences (Azhar et al. 2014). A retrospective search for MERS-CoV antibodies indicated\nthat the virus was circulating among the camel populations in Middle East and Africa as early as 1992 and 1983 (Alagaili et al. 2014; Alexandersen et al. 2014; Meyer et al. 2014; Perera et al. 2013). Recently, the detection of a MERS-CoV conspecific virus from an African bat led the authors to hypothesize that the MERS-CoV may have originated from an African bat, followed by bat to camel transmission in Africa, then the introduction of MERS-CoV to Middle East through camel exportation/importation (Corman et al. 2014; Chan et al. 2015).",
