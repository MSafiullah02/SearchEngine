Various pathological cell alterations triggered by eukaryotic viruses are referred to as the cytopathic effect (CPE). Notwithstanding their practical significance, CPE mechanisms are understood rather vaguely. Here, some fundamental aspects of the CPE will be overviewed, based primarily on studies on picornaviruses, a family of RNA-containing animal viruses, including, among others, poliovirus, hepatitis \u0410 virus (HAV), rhinoviruses, and foot-and-mouth disease virus.",

Viral antidefensive counter-measures also contribute to, and modulate, development and specific features of the pathological alterations. Changes in cellular metabolism directly associated with the needs of viral reproduction may play a relatively minor part in cellular injuries, at least in some virus\u2013host systems. This hypothesis is also supported by studies with some other viruses (e.g., herpesviruses, see below). If correct and general, it may have important implications for understanding of innate immunity mechanisms as well as pathogenesis and treatment of viral diseases.",

            "text": "Some major features of the structure and reproduction of picornaviruses are briefly summarized in Box 1\n. In many picornavirus\u2013cell combinations, infection terminates in death of the host cell. Two major types of picornavirus-induced fatal CPE are usually discerned, necrosis, and apoptosis (Box 2\n). It is not obvious, however, to what extent cellular injuries reflect direct needs of viral reproduction, on the one hand, or interaction between host defensive and viral antidefensive activities, on the other. Indeed, certain picornaviruses, for example, HAV, are able to grow without inflicting major damage to the cultured host cells. Moreover, even typically cytocidal viruses, such as poliovirus and some other, are able to establish, in certain cells or under certain conditions, persistent infection not accompanied with overt CPE [1], although it should be noted that viral reproduction in persistently infected cells is usually not as efficient as in productively infected ones.Box 1Picornaviruses, their genomes and life cyclePicornaviruses possess small (ca. 30 nm in diameter) icosahedral nonenveloped virions typically composed of four capsid proteins (VP1\u20134) and a \u223c7.5\u20138 kb-long single-stranded RNA molecule of positive polarity (Figure I\n) [55].The RNA genome usually has a single open reading frame (ORF) as well as 5\u2032- and 3\u2032-terminal untranslated regions (UTRs) harboring replicative (oriL and oriR) and translational (IRES) control elements. After its internalization, the viral RNA is translated in the cytoplasm generating a polyprotein, which is eventually processed by virus-encoded protease(s) into a dozen \u2018mature\u2019 proteins, including four capsid proteins (VP1\u20134), RNA-dependent RNA polymerase 3Dpol, protease 3Cpro (a major player in viral polyprotein processing but it may also cleave some host proteins, including components of the innate immunity system), 2CATPase (believed to function as an RNA helicase but perhaps involved in some other activities too), VPg (a primer for initiation of positive and negative viral RNA strands), and two hydrophobic proteins 2B and 3A that navigate key replicative proteins to their intracellular destinations and help create an optimal environment for viral reproduction. The leader protein (L) is encoded by only certain picornaviruses. L and 2A proteins of picornaviruses may or may not exhibit proteases activities (and in the former case they are referred to as Lpro and 2Apro, respectively). Regardless of this difference, both proteins perform largely antidefensive functions and are called security proteins [2]. RNA of certain picornaviruses contains additional out-of-frame ORFs, giving rise to proteins such as L* and 2B*. After accumulation of a certain level of viral proteins, translation of viral RNA is switched to its exponential replication. The newly synthesized RNA molecules are also translated, and when sufficient amounts of capsid proteins are accumulated, they are assembled with genomic RNA molecules into virions. The viral progeny usually leave the cells owing to their lysis.Box 2Major types of cellular deathSeveral types of the death of eukaryotic cells are now recognized [34], among which the most common are apoptosis and necrosis. Apoptosis results from implementation of a cell-encoded program aimed at elimination of cells unwanted for various reasons. Two major mechanisms of apoptosis, extrinsic (initiated by the engagement of \u2018death\u2019 receptors on the plasma membrane) and intrinsic (caused by intracellular disturbances), are distinguished. Both mechanisms converge in a cascade of serine proteases (caspases) attacking essential cellular targets. The hallmarks of apoptosis are so-called \u2018blebbing\u2019 of the plasma membrane not accompanied with enhanced permeability, strong condensation of chromatin within shrinking nuclei, degradation of chromosomal DNA into oligonucleosome-sized fragments with eventual fragmentation of the cells into apoptotic bodies, which are destined to elimination by phagocytosis. Until relatively recently, necrosis was considered to be passive fatal cellular damage due to exhaustion of cellular resources and destruction of intracellular infrastructure caused by various extrinsic and intrinsic factors. Typical features of necrotic cells include swelling, increased permeability of the plasma membrane with its ultimate rupture, nuclear pyknosis. More recently, the existence of host-encoded necrotic programs is well established, which may also be initiated from the plasma membrane receptors or in response to intracellular disturbances, and may have different underlying mechanisms. Both apoptotic and necrotic cell-encoded pathways may be controlled by the same upstream elements and may compete with each other 34, 37. Pathogen-induced necrotic death is usually accompanied with emitting various proinflammatory signals. In addition to apoptosis and necrosis, at least two other cell death mechanisms were reported to be implemented in viral infection. Cells dying of pyroptosis (a program involving activation of proinflammatory caspase-1) exhibit certain features of both apoptosis and necrosis, for example, permeabilization of the plasma membrane and DNA fragmentation. Autophagy, usually a prosurvival cell reaction, which is characterized by the formation of multiple double-membrane vesicles (autophagosomes) delivering their content to lysosomes for degradation, may be exploited by a virus for its reproduction, but in certain cases may result in death of infected cells.",

Partial virus disarmament may be achieved by inactivating their security proteins, a set of proteins specifically dedicated to antidefensive functions [2]. In picornaviruses, this set comprises the leader (L) and 2A proteins as well as L* protein of certain cardioviruses. Inactivation of security proteins does not kill viruses but usually decreases their reproductive potential. The latter effect is probably due to decreased viral resistance to the cellular defenses, because viruses with impaired security proteins exhibit milder deficiency in hosts with compromised innate immunity (reviewed in [2]).",

Infection with wild type (wt) virus terminated in necrosis, whereas MV mutants with inactivated L induced apoptosis [3]. However, in L\u2013 mutant-infected cells, a chemical inhibitor of apoptosis prevented not only apoptosis but also suppressed manifestations of major signs of necrotic CPE or delayed them until well after the completion of the viral reproduction [4]. The yield and time course of the reproduction of L\u2013 mutants were unaffected by this inhibitor. Thus, an adequate level of reproduction of a lytic virus can be maintained without immediate killing or even severely damaging its host cell, indicating that cells have enough resources to fulfill the needs of the virus and retain their own viability. Admittedly, the harvest of the L\u2013 mutants was somewhat lower compared with that of its wt counterpart. However, the prolonged survival of L\u2013-infected cells with pharmacologically switched-off apoptosis was not due to this lowered reproduction, because an MV with mutated RNA-dependent RNA polymerase generated the same amount of progeny but induced necrotic CPE with a wt-like time course.",

In most known cases apoptotic response is caused by replicating picornaviruses, although modulations of the apoptotic program through poliovirus interaction with its receptor was documented [13].",

Viral proteins may also cause other types of injuries. Thus, infection with both enteroviruses [24] and cardioviruses [25] leads to enhanced permeability of the nuclear envelope but although this effect is due to proteolysis of nucleoporins by the viral 2Apro of enteroviruses 26, 27, 28, cardioviruses elicit phosphorylation of nucleoporins triggered by the L protein 29, 30.

A strong argument for this hypothesis is provided by a striking multifunctionality of the small (67 amino acids) nonenzymatic cardiovirus L protein. If apoptosis of infected HeLa cells was pharmacologically suppressed, diverse signs of necrotic CPE such as permeabilization of the plasma membrane, rearrangements of microtubule and microfilament networks, changes in the cellular and nuclear shapes, condensation of chromatin, and loss of the general metabolic activity all depend on L functionality [4]. This protein also impairs cellular interferon system [32], formation of stress granules [33], and, as mentioned above, nucleocytoplasmic traffic [25]. In addition, it exhibits antiapoptotic activity [3]. Admittedly, one cannot rigorously exclude the possibility that L directly affects such a multitude of targets by itself but it is much more likely that it modulates the activity of a single (or few) cellular control element(s). We hypothesize that this putative element is a part of the innate immunity system involved in deciding the fate of the virus-infected cell.",

The difference in response to a virus is not necessarily related to the level of host permissiveness: poliovirus [48] and EMCV [49] may elicit apoptosis also in permissive cells. Another type of host-dependence is demonstrated in human rhabdomyosarcoma (RD) cells: inhibition of poliovirus reproduction in these permissive cells does not result in the necrosis-to-apoptosis switch as it does in HeLa cells [50]. Furthermore, the response to picornavirus of a given population is very rarely, if ever, homogeneous.
