            "text": "Lead generation is a critical first step in the drug discovery process. Over the past decade, high-throughput screening (HTS) of corporate compound decks has emerged as the primary paradigm for hit or lead discovery. Typically, targets are interrogated with 1\u20133 million discrete compounds in parallel. The HTS era has thus far delivered mixed results. Hit rates for targets tend to be extremely low or very high. Two key factors are likely to be responsible for this. First, most compound decks in the industry are skewed in compound distribution favoring specific, well-studied protein subfamilies. Second, and most importantly for novel targets, sampling of drug-like chemistry space by a few million compounds is inadequate to consistently deliver several diverse lead classes [1]. Challenges facing HTS technologies include high false-positive and false-negative rates, the need for reporter assays, and the limitation in throughput imposed by testing compounds individually [2]. To address these issues, affinity or bio-affinity screening approaches have emerged as orthogonal methods for early lead discovery. For affinity-based techniques, the readout is typically a qualitative or quantitative signal based on the physical interaction between macromolecule (RNA, DNA or protein) and the small-molecule partner. This approach has several advantages over biochemical assays for both drug-like and fragment-like methods (see Glossary). First, it has the capability to sample mixtures (including natural products) rather than discrete entities, thus enabling the exploration of larger chemical spaces without a concomitant increase in the number of samples. Second, it has the ability to investigate multiple forms of macromolecules, such as various ternary complexes, activated or inactivated forms and forms with or without cofactor. Third, it is possible to carry out the assays at small-molecule concentrations much higher or lower than that of the corresponding biochemical assays. Last, this approach eliminates many assay artifacts that arise from nonspecific aggregation, fluorescence absorption or quenching. On the downside, affinity-based technologies do not deliver a functional readout. Thus, affinity hits require biochemical, cellular or in vivo validation. Nevertheless, the advantages of affinity techniques have extended their use into follow-up or secondary screens, especially in the field of ATP-dependent enzymes.",

            "text": "Affinity selection techniques can be classified as homogeneous or heterogeneous. A heterogeneous screening environment is created by immobilization of either the macromolecule of interest or of the small molecule(s) on a reactive surface followed by a static or flow-based analysis of binding. By contrast, a homogeneous environment leaves both macromolecular and small-molecule species to interact in their native states. Following the binding event, a qualitative or quantitative assessment of the interaction can be made using one of many available detectors that have been used for affinity screening, such as nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), mass spectroscopy (MS), X-ray crystallography or surface plasmon resonance (SPR). A subset of these techniques employs a filtration step before detection. Specific details of some affinity screening techniques have been reviewed [3\u2022\u2022]. Below we consider some recently developed platforms for the affinity selection of drug-like compounds.Glossary\n\nDrug-like molecules: Typical molecules are in the molecular weight range 350\u2013550 Da and either pass or do not violate more than one component of the \u2018rule-of-five\u2019 (Lipinski rules for oral bioavailability) [48].\nLead-like molecules: Typical molecules are in the molecular weight range 300\u2013450 Da to enable lead growth during medicinal chemistry optimization towards clinical candidates that still pass the rule-of-five.\nFragment-like molecules: Typical molecules are in the molecular weight range 120\u2013300 Da and have higher solubility than drug-like molecules to enable screens at high micromolar or millimolar small-molecule concentrations.\nFragment-based drug or lead discovery: A lead generation technique that calls for primary screens of weak-binding (IC50 5 mM\u201350 \u03bcM) fragment-like molecules followed by optimization towards leads, rather than for primary screens of more potent (IC50 25 \u03bcM\u201350 nM) drug-like molecules via HTS. The advantage of the former is the better sampling of chemistry space, because the number of compounds relevant for drug discovery grows exponentially with molecular weight.\nFragment evolution: A fragment optimization technique that typically involves the systematic exploration of structure-activity relationships along various substitution vectors of the fragment hits.\nSite-directed fragment screening: A fragment optimization technique that typically involves screening fragment libraries in the presence of another fragment added at saturation concentrations. The binding mode of the latter fragment is typically known from previous studies. Any new hits from the second screen would target new binding sites and such hits could later be the subject of \u2018fragment linking\u2019 with the previously identified fragment.\n\n",

The key step to ALIS is the separation of the desired protein\u2013ligand complex from non-binding components and dissociation of the complex by reverse phase chromatography with mass detection. As part of a lead discovery effort against the anti-infective target Escherichia coli dihydrofolate reductase, a total of 3 750 000 compounds (in mixtures of 2000), were screened to identify compound 1 (Figure 1\n) [4]. The advantages of improved sampling of chemistry space were demonstrated by the discovery of a single compound (2) from a multimillion member library for \u03b2-secretase (BACE1), an enzyme that is crucial in Alzheimer's disease [5\u2022]. The compound was selective, possessed a unique binding mode and could be optimized to form a potent inhibitor (3) of the enzyme [6]. The generality of the ALIS platform has been demonstrated against a diverse set of targets [7].",

These advantages have been demonstrated with protein tyrosine phosphatase 1B (PTP1B), a validated but historically challenging target implicated in type II diabetes. A protein-based NMR fragment screen (which detects changes in the NMR spectra of a protein on ligand binding) has been used to identify several phosphate mimics: oxalylarylaminobenzoic acids (6; Figure 2\n) [20], which proved not to be cell permeable, and isoxazolecarboxylic acids (7) [21\u2022]. The latter was linked with a noncompetitive fragment identified by another NMR screen, which resulted in the development of a monocharged PTP1B inhibitor (8) with cellular activity. In a search for aminoglycoside mimetics against the E. coli A-site RNA, an NMR-based screen of a 10 000 member library was used to identify several different chemical series, two of which (2-aminoquinolines and aminopyridines) could rapidly be advanced to more potent derivatives in the low micromolar range [22]. Structure activity relationships determined by NMR (SAR by NMR) have been instrumental in the development of Abbott's matrix metalloproteinase program, identifying the key biphenyl group [23]. Fragment linking with hydroxamic acids followed by medicinal chemistry optimization ultimately resulted in the development candidate ABT-518 (9) for treating cancer. Site-directed fragment screening and fragment evolution (see Glossary) was also used to discover and optimize leads for the anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family, ultimately leading to ABT-737 (10). Compound 10 was well tolerated and was shown to cause tumor regression in multiple cancer cell lines either as a single agent or in combination with chemotherapeutics [24]. Protein-based NMR fragment screens have also recently been extended to insoluble proteins [25].",

On the downside, no structural information on the protein's binding site or on the relative binding mode of different fragments can be discerned. The SHAPES method has been applied pre-HTS, owing to minimal development time, or post-HTS for failed targets, as exemplified by Jnk3 MAP kinase and adipocyte lipid-binding protein [26].

Although drawbacks such as false-negatives [27], long development times for novel unknown proteins, and protein consumption still remain, structure-guided fragment evolution makes this technology an attractive option. Fragments can simply be screened in small mixtures (<10 members) or can be pre-filtered by biochemical assays to limit the set of scaffolds for crystallization. A proof-of-principle for the latter approach has recently been disclosed for phosphodiesterases. In that study, 1-phenyl-4-pyrazolecarboxylic esters (11) were developed using a 20 000 member scaffold library and structure-based optimization [28]. A more comprehensive study of five targets (p38, CDK2, thrombin, PTP1B and RNase A) demonstrated that weak fragments can indeed be identified using high-throughput crystallography [29\u2022\u2022]. Chemical series evolution from fragments (12) to leads (13) was illustrated by the p38 program [30]. Although these studies clearly show the potential of the underlying technology in lead generation, the strong reliance on structure-based design for optimization makes the discovery of truly novel molecular frameworks unlikely.",

The method is practically an extension of the established BIAcoreTM technology to fragments, and may hold promise for HTS of lead-like small molecules.

There has been a significant effort to express and develop assays for a growing number of kinases and their mutants for counter-screening studies, owing to a few early reports on finding off-target liabilities (potential adverse effects) in distant sections of the kinase dendogram. Immobilized inhibitors can be used to map ATP-binding site interactions with many targets. Conceivably, each inhibitor might have to be linked via multiple orientations to avoid false-negatives arising from linker interference. Nevertheless, several surprisingly tight off-target interactions were identified for the aryl-imidazole and pyrido[2,3-d]pyrimidine kinase inhibitor classes [43, 44, 45]. A semi-homogenous variation of this technique has also been developed, which requires the immobilization of only a small number of compounds to study all ATP-competitive small molecules with any enzymes [46\u2022\u2022]. In this approach, highly promiscuous (inhibitory constant (IC50) < 1 \u03bcM) \u2018bait\u2019 molecules are immobilized on the solid support via a biotinylated linker. The T7 phage tagged protein is introduced along with the \u2018study compound\u2019 free in solution. If the free compound does not bind to the protein, elution of the macromolecule is slower because it can extensively interact with the bait compounds on the solid support. The amount of protein bound to the support is quantified by either phage plaque assays or quantitative PCR for high sensitivity and can be plotted as a function of the test compound concentration. An entire enzyme panel can be run in a single experiment and, unlike biochemical assays, the result is not dependent on ATP concentration. Of course, when interesting novel interactions of known compounds with new targets are found, these profiling techniques can also serve as lead discovery tools to initiate chemistry efforts to derive new therapeutics.",
