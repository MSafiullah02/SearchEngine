This stepwise approach should be used for events of any scale and for both sudden (e.g., bomb detonation) or gradual events (e.g., pandemic influenza).Scope: using examples and general recommendations, provide templates for intensive care unit (ICU) and isolation area expansion including consideration of central system capacity expansion (such as oxygen). Recent recommendations have called for institutions to prepare for at least a 300% increase in ICU capacity beyond baseline during a pandemic or catastrophic disaster [3]. This level of expansion of space and services is not achievable without significant prior planning/preparedness activities. Institutions should define their own capacities and capabilities. Defining specific limitations (e.g., shortage of available ventilators), sources to mitigate these shortfalls (e.g., national stockpile, institutional cache) and a strategy for accepting/using outside resources to expand capacity is critical to response success. This document cannot account for operational planning details at individual institutions, but aims to provide a brief, general overview of key issues to be addressed during events requiring critical care surge capacity generation. Hospitals should create their own specific plans according to hospital size, role in the community and the hazards recognized in the community. Hospitals may refer to recent articles for surge capacity frameworks [4, 5] and crisis patient care decision frameworks [6, 7].Goals and objectives: describe the basis for institutional standard operating procedures (SOP) for ICU and isolation space expansion using templates. Provide recommendations for expansion of oxygen capacity and continuity of infrastructure operation.\n",

Usually implies temporary communications and resource shortfalls and a temporary lack of situational awareness. Note that a MCE is not equivalent to a disaster, and increased capacity and preparedness increase facility surge capacity for larger patient volumes before a MCE becomes a disaster.Crisis standard of care: a substantial change in usual health care operations and the level of care it is possible to deliver, made necessary by a pervasive (e.g., pandemic influenza) or catastrophic (e.g., earthquake, hurricane) disaster. This change in the level of care delivered is justified by specific circumstances and is formally declared by government entities. The formal declaration that crisis standards of care are in operation enables specific legal/regulatory powers and protections for health care providers in the necessary tasks of allocating and using scarce medical resources [7].Surge capacity: three functional components of surge capacity exist (Fig. 1) [5, 7].\nConventional: using usual patient care spaces, resources and practices.Contingency: using adapted areas of the facility for ICU services (procedure areas, post-anesthesia care, operative suites, stepdown units) including adaptations to standard staffing and resource practices to provide functionally equivalent medical care, with minimal increase in risk to the patient.Crisis: providing sufficient care under the circumstances with significant changes to standard staffing and resource practices (e.g., using an oxygen-saturation monitor with high/low rate alarms instead of usual cardiac and other monitors, tiered staffing so one nurse/physician with critical care expertise supervises several staff with lesser degrees of training that provide the bedside care) that may significantly impact patient morbidity and mortality.\n",

This assures that in addition to using appropriate incident command positions and terminology that the process of management by objectives and utilization of formal and practiced planning cycles to generate incident action plans (IAP) for the next operational period is followed. The Hospital Emergency Executive Control Group coordinates these activities (see Chap. 3: Coordination and collaboration of interface units).Coordination agreements and systems with neighboring/regional health care facilities are put in place [10] by the Local, Regional or National Emergency Executive Control Group (see Chap. 3: Coordination and collaboration of interface units). These may cross jurisdictional and even national boundaries. The importance of resource-balancing across multiple institutions cannot be overemphasized. During a single-site event, expedient patient transfer to those facilities with resources provides the best care possible, and during a pervasive event (such as a pandemic), inter-facility coordination assures a consistent standard of care across a given region. \u2018Regions\u2019 are usually defined functionally for hospitals rather than geographically (as is the case for emergency management), and planning should include usual referral partners regardless of geographic boundaries.The hospital has an ICU, operating rooms, post-anesthesia care, stepdown/intermediate care units and procedure areas (may include respiratory/gastrointestinal procedure rooms or outpatient surgery/procedure areas) [11\u201313]The hospital has prepared for MCEs including stockpiling equipment, medications and basic supplies [11, 12]. This should include planning for special populations regardless of the hospital\u2019s role in the community (for example, a hospital that does not usually provide burn or pediatric care may have to provide care for these patients during an incident that overwhelms or damages usual community resources).The hospital has one ventilator per critical care bed [12] but can obtain limited additional ventilators within 6\u201312 h.\n",

These updates should occur as soon as possible after event declaration and be updated every few hours until the influx of patients has stabilized (after a no-notice event) at which point twice-daily reporting is likely to be sufficient unless specific circumstances require an update.Transfer patients within the facility as needed to open critical care space.Work with unit managers from other hospital departments to implement pre-determined strategies for critical care surge capacity (Table 1).\nProvide information to the incident manager about patients that could be safely transferred to other institutions.

            "text": "\nOxygenRemodeling or building projects at a hospital should consider incorporating oxygen ports (or extra ports) into patient rooms, meeting rooms, etc., to facilitate conversion to patient care areas or the accommodation of additional beds in usual areas. However, safety considerations are paramount, as these systems may not be used often and yet still require regular inspection and testing. Multi-patient regulators are available that can serve multiple patients on variable oxygen flow rates from a single wall port, and these may be useful for providing cohort care, particularly in flat-space areas such as meeting rooms, etc. Though this does not provide critical care, it can open beds up that can be used for critical care and thus is a valuable part of planning.Hospitals should carefully consider limitations of the oxygen supply. Even if enough ventilators or oxygen flow meters are available such that every bed in the hospital would have one, the oxygen systems for most hospitals were not designed to provide such a supply and maintain pressure within the system. Continued supply and re-supply of liquid oxygen may be another limiting factor. Hospitals should examine their oxygen delivery and storage systems for vulnerabilities. Often, there are many potential points of failure within these systems with little redundancy or recovery. It may be to the institution\u2019s advantage to duplicate liquid oxygen systems, ideally separated geographically, or at least equipped to allow an interface with a trailer-based liquid oxygen system should the primary fixed delivery system fail.Suction/compressed air: suction and compressed air lines are a lower priority for incorporation into congregate care spaces (those providing low acuity non-ambulatory patient care); however, at least compressed air (and ideally suction) should be available for any spaces where mechanical ventilation is a consideration (i.e., patient rooms). Hand-held and battery-operated suction units are available and may have utility, though the availability of wall suction is far preferable because of superior performance.UtilitiesElectricity: emergency generators at most hospitals do not have the capacity to power outlets in all patient rooms sufficiently for the monitors, ventilators and pumps necessary for critical care. Further, heating, air conditioning and ventilation systems (including negative flow systems) may not be included or adequately powered with emergency power circuits. Critical care staff should identify which systems and outlets are included in emergency power, which are not and what the maximum load is (just because outlets are marked for emergency use does not mean that the generators can support the electrical draw if many of these outlets are used at once). The hospital should plan with jurisdictional emergency management the types and quantities of generators necessary to effectively run the facility should primary power fail and have the necessary adaptors available to wire temporary generators into the hospital system [18].Water: clean water is required for many health care activities, including large volumes for hemodialysis. Hospital planners may be unaware of the water needs for critical care activities and should work with critical care to forecast needs and identify suppliers and an operating procedure.Continuity of operational planning: the ability of the institution to provide critical care depends on the maintenance of the operating infrastructure. Water and utilities are separated from these because of the specific considerations above, but the availability of lighting, communications, information technology, fire suppression, heating/ventilation/air conditioning, nutrition services, laboratory, radiology and many other support and infrastructure services is not assured and critical care planners should be familiar with planning for maintaining general hospital operations during outages and other incidents [19, 20].\n",

Protocols (SOPs) within each institution should account for phased expansion of the use of these spaces (Table 3), facilitate screening and triage of persons on entrance to the facility, and use and monitoring of staff, patient and visitor PPE within these areas.\nFatality management: the health care facility should understand their interface with mass fatality plans existing in the community. Regardless of perceived jurisdictional capacity, the facility should have plans to temporarily and respectfully accommodate excess decedents in congruence with community values and applicable legal requirements.

This group assists with Emergency Medical Services and other patient transportation resources.Health care systems: provide mutual aid including resources and staff to disproportionately affected hospitals. Depending on regional constructs, these systems ideally have a coordinating entity that establishes priorities of response and resource assignments, coordinates patient transfers, and works with other stakeholder agencies to obtain necessary staff, resources and emergency declarations. Hospital personnel should understand how these systems work in their area and practice using them prior to an event [3, 10].\n",
