            "text": "Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the novel coronavirus first detected in Wuhan, China, that causes coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) and pneumonia. Covid-19 pneumonia is defined by a positive result for SARS-CoV-2 on a reverse-transcriptase\u2013polymerase-chain-reaction (RT-PCR) assay of a specimen collected from the upper or lower respiratory tract together with radiological features of pneumonia and clinical features of hypoxaemia and dyspnoea. Although more than 80% of patients with Covid-19 infection have mild disease and make a full recovery, a significant proportion of patients progress to pneumonia, and about half of these cases will develop severe acute respiratory syndrome (ARDS). Initial reports from China suggested that age >65 years and medical comorbidities are risk factors for poor outcomes.(1) The need for ICU admission and mechanical ventilation once ARDS develops is associated with a high mortality, ranging from 39% to 72%.(2,3) Current guidelines recommend that corticosteroids or immunosuppressive therapy should not be used in patients with Covid-19 pneumonia unless there are other indications, such as shock, asthma or exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.(4) However, the role of systemic corticosteroids is currently being re-evaluated in mechanically ventilated adults with ARDS, with some guidelines now suggesting their use.(5)",

He made an uneventful recovery and proceeded to travel to Austria on 29 February 2020. During his stay in Austria, he had contact with a Covid-19 positive individual and started developing upper respiratory symptoms on 7 March. On his return to South Africa on 8 March he had a fever, sore throat, dry cough, severe wheezing and worsening dyspnoea. At that stage a commercial test for Covid-19 PCR was not yet available to the private pathology laboratories and blood tests showed a normal full blood count and a C-reactive protein (CRP) of 16 mg/L. He was advised to self-isolate at home and was managed telephonically with bronchodilator nebulization, oral prednisone 30 mg daily for 5 days and paracetamol. By 11 March he was not feeling any better and had ongoing fever and cough. The Covid-19 PCR test had become available at that stage and his initial test with a private pathology laboratory was negative.",

This last phase is associated with worsening ARDS, multi-organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS), coagulation abnormalities, myocarditis and death. Patients progressing to this last severe phase of Covid-19 have clinical and laboratory evidence of an exaggerated inflammatory response, similar to the CRS, with persistent fever, worsening ARDS, elevated inflammatory markers and proinflammatory cytokines and MODS.",

            "text": "This case study also highlights some of the many controversies and complications in managing patients with severe Covid-19:\u2022The use of inhaled or oral corticosteroids as a risk factor for severe Covid-19 is not certain. Individuals taking long-term corticosteroids for chronic conditions such as asthma, allergies and arthritis may be unable to mount an appropriate immune response and are generally considered high risk for severe disease if infected with Covid-19.(17) Corticosteroids can also result in increased viral replication and prolonged viral shedding. Even a short course of oral corticosteroids in the preceding month for an asthma exacerbation, such as in this case study, is a risk factor for ARDS and mechanical ventilation.(18) Conversely, in vitro studies with ciclesonide showed antiviral activity against Covid-19, and there have been reports of clinical effectiveness of inhaled ciclesonide in the treatment of Covid-19.(19) Studies are currently underway to investigate whether inhaled ciclesonide alone, or in combination with hydroxychloroquine, could eradicate SARS-CoV-2 from respiratory tract earlier in patients with mild Covid-19.(20)\u2022Diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia is not always straightforward. Currently, the gold standard in clinical practice is the detection of Covid-19 RNA by RT-PCR in respiratory tract specimens. Nasopharyngeal and throat swabs are recommended over expectorated or induced sputum. Lower respiratory tract specimens, such as tracheal aspirates or bronchoalveolar lavage in intubated patients may have higher viral loads and be more likely to yield positive tests (up to 95% sensitive) but come with a higher risk of transmission of infection to health-care workers.(21) False-negative tests from upper respiratory specimens have been documented, as with this case study. If initial testing is negative in a patient with risk factors for infection and clinical or radiological features are highly suggestive of Covid-19 or determining the presence of infection is important for further management and infection control, repeat testing is recommended.\u2022Chloroquine, azithromycin and lopinavir/ritonavir can all cause QT prolongation and ventricular arrhythmia, in particular drug-induced torsades de pointes and sudden cardiac death.(22) Patients treated with any combination of these drugs should have 12\u201324 hourly ECG with QTc monitoring. If QTc >500 ms (as in the case study), or QTc increases >60 ms from baseline after initiating drug therapy, discontinue azithromycin and lopinavir/ritonavir, and consider reducing dose of chloroquine. Frequent monitoring of QTc is mandatory and chloroquine should also be discontinued if QTc remains >500 ms. The risk of serious ventricular arrhythmia may be reduced by performing a screening ECG prior to initiation of therapy, inquiring about a personal or family history of QT interval prolongation or sudden unexplained cardiac death, avoiding exposure to other medications known to affect QT interval, and aggressively treating hypocalcaemia, hypokalaemia and hypomagnesaemia. Hypokalaemia is especially common in patients with Covid-19 and is associated with a poorer prognosis.(23) The correction of hypokalaemia can be challenging due to continuous renal loss of potassium resulting from the degradation of angiotensin converting enzyme 2 by binding of SAR-CoV-2.\n",
