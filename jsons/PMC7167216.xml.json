Nevertheless, as the number of positive cases continue to grow \u2013 with the associated morbidity and mortality, it is critical to control further spread via implementation and strict compliance with isolation precautions, as healthcare workers and other patients are at significant risk for exposure [2]. SARS-CoV-2 is a respiratory pathogen that is spread predominately through large droplets and contact (i.e. fomites such as surfaces) transmission [3]. As such, respiratory and contact isolation precautions are paramount in limiting further exposure. Because of the highly contagious nature of SARS-CoV-2 and its case fatality rate, much of which is still under investigation, additional precautions are recommended beyond what is typically used for limiting the spread of routine respiratory pathogens [4]. Unfortunately, as the numbers of cases increase, some of the presumptively infected or confirmed SARS-CoV-2 patients will present with concomitant problems that might require surgical intervention.",

This is particularly important due to reports of the virus still being found on un-sanitized surfaces for up to 17 days [3].",
