Here we built on this to map 36 epitopes of neutralizing monoclonal antibodies and polyclonal sera against the HIV-1 virus. 37 The design of an effective vaccine against HIV-1 has met with limited success so far, because 38 of the inability of immunogens to elicit broadly neutralizing antibodies (bNAbs) targeted to the 39 trimeric envelope (Env) glycoprotein, the sole viral antigen on the surface of the virus. Most 40 bNAbs isolated from infected individuals are directed to one of the major sites of vulnerability 41 on Env: V1/V2 loop apex, V3 loop, CD4-binding site, centre of the gp120 silent face, gp120-42 gp41 subunit interface, gp41 fusion peptide and membrane proximal external region (MPER) 43 of gp41. 44 We developed a facile methodology for mapping neutralizing HIV-1 epitopes at single residue 45 resolution. To this end, a library of single-site Cys mutations were engineered at selected 46 solvent-exposed sites in the Env glycoprotein on the surface of the virus. Cys mutants were 47 covalently labeled using a Cys reactive reagent (Maleimide-PEG2-Biotin) that masks epitope 48 residues, followed by infection of the labeled mutant viruses in mammalian cells in the 49 presence of bNAbs. Subsequently, deep sequencing of the env gene from bNAb-resistant 50 viruses was used to delineate epitopes ( Figure 1 ). We focused our epitope mapping efforts to 51 the Env ectodomain of the clade B, CCR5-tropic primary HIV-1 isolate JRFL, which has been 52 extensively characterized both biochemically and structurally, and is used as a model primary 53 virus.",

This led to the 57 identification of a set of solvent-exposed residues which collectively exhibit uniform surface 58 coverage of the Env trimer ( Figure S2 ). These Env residues were mutated to Cys in the pLAI-59 JRFL molecular clone, pooled in equimolar quantities to create a plasmid DNA library, and 60 transfected in HEK293T cells to produce the Exposed Cys Library, a library of single-site Cys 61 mutant viruses. Wt Env lacks free Cys residues. In single-cycle and multi-cycle infectivity 62 assays, the Exposed Cys Library retained significant viral infectivity ( Figure S3 ) and was 63 therefore used for epitope mapping studies.

PCR was done for 30 cycles with an annealing 388 temperature of 60\u00b0C for 35 seconds. Amplified env cDNA was purified using a GeneJET PCR 389 purification kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific). This step was necessary to remove the Phusion 390 DNA polymerase which would otherwise degrade any overhangs subsequently generated.This was further amplified for deep sequencing. The length of the env gene is ~2.2 kb, whereas 392 the maximum length of DNA that can be sequenced on the Illumina HiSeq 2500 platform is 393 500 bases in a paired end sequencing run (2x250 bp). Because of the size restriction imposed 394 by Illumina sequencing, the env gene was sequenced in six fragments.395The env gene was sequenced from the Exposed Cys Library isolated under different conditions 396 (listed inTable S3). Primers were designed for each of the conditions, with a unique Multiplex397 IDentifier (MID) tag for each condition. For the first 5 fragments (Figure S16) both the forward 398 and reverse flanking primers begin with NNN, followed by 6 bases of the unique sequence tag 399 for each MID and the 21 bases complementary to the gene. The sixth fragment contained the 400 same flanking forward primer, but the reverse primer was devoid of the MID sequence.
