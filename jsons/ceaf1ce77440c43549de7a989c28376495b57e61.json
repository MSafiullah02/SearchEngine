This study aimed to identify the crucial domain of the S1 subunit of the S protein that interacts with NCAM. Methods: Three truncated segments (S 1-291 , S 277-794 and S 548-868 ) of the S gene of PHEV and the NCAM gene were cloned individually into the Escherichia coli expression vectors and yeast two-hybrid expression vectors. The interaction between S 1-291 , S 277-794 , S 548-868 and NCAM were detected by a GST pull-down experiment and yeast two-hybrid assay. Results: Three fusion proteins (S 1-291 , S 277-794 and S 548-868 ) were screened for their interactions with NCAM by protein-protein interaction assays. The results of these assays clarified that S 277-794 interacted with NCAM, while S 1-291 and S 548-868 did not. Conclusions: A small fragment (258-amino-acid fragment, residues 291-548) on the PHEV S protein was posited to be the minimum number of amino acids necessary to interact with NCAM. This fragment may be the receptorbinding domain that mediates PHEV binding to NCAM.",

Other related members are mouse hepatitis virus, bovine coronavirus, human coronavirus OC43, human coronavirus HKU1, etc. [1] . PHEV causes vomiting and wasting disease, as well as encephalomyelitis in piglets younger than 3 weeks, particularly in those lacking PHEV antibodies such as SPF pigs [2] . Recently, more research has focused on PHEV because infection rates have risen in some countries [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] . PHEV is a highly neurovirulent virus that spreads to the central nervous system via peripheral nerves, where nerve cells are a target for viral replication [7] , and this spread could result in high neuropathogenicity. However, the mechanism by which PHEV enters the nerve cells remains largely unknown.",

The receptor of the coronaviral S protein is responsible for viruses entering into cells via fusion of viral envelope and the cellular membrane [11] . For example, the entry of SARS-CoV into cells is initiated by the binding of the S protein to the cellular receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 [12] , and the S protein of MERS-CoV targets the cellular receptor dipeptidyl peptidase 4 [13] . The neural cell adhesion molecule (NCAM, also known as CD56) is a homophilic glycoprotein expressed on the surface of nerve cells. NCAM has been implicated as having a role in cell-cell adhesion, neurite outgrowth and synaptic plasticity [14] . In 2010, Gao et al. [15] confirmed that NCAM participates in the process by which PHEV infects neurons. Therefore, NCAM may be a receptor for PHEV in N2a cells.",

It is widely recognized that the main determinant of coronavirus tropism is the viral S protein which mediates binding to a cell surface receptor [22] . The S proteins of coronaviruses have an S1 and an S2 subunit. The S1 subunit initiates entry of viruses into cells by binding to cell surface receptors, and the S2 subunit helps viral fusion with cellular membranes [23] [24] [25] . The RBDs present in the S1 subunit is important for interaction with receptors. Wong et al. [16] reported that a 193-amino-acid fragment of the SARS-CoV S protein (residues 318-510) has been shown to interact with angiotensin-converting enzyme 2, and recently, Mou et al. [22] found that a 231-amino-acid fragment of the MERS-CoV S protein (residues 358-588) could interact with the cellular receptor dipeptidyl peptidase 4. Therefore, the S1 subunits of S proteins are crucial for the interactions of coronaviruses with specific receptors.",

            "text": "The PHEV S protein is composed of 1,349 amino acids. Based on bioinformatics analysis and the S proteins of other coronaviruses, there is a transmembrane helix between the 1,294 amino acid and 1,316 amino acid in the PHEV S protein. Residues 1-1,293 are located in the extracellular region, and residues 1,317-1,349 are intracellular. Residues 1-794 of the PHEV S protein compose the 136 S1 subunit, and residues 795-1,349 compose the S2 subunit. Although it has been reported that the PHEV S protein interacts with NCAM [15] , the crucial binding domain of the PHEV S protein is unknown. Therefore, in this study, we prepared three truncated fusion proteins spanning the entire S1 subunit of the PHEV S protein to identify the crucial domain of interaction with NCAM. In our work, we used the GST pull-down assay to elucidate the interaction between the PHEV S protein segments and NCAM. The NCAM that was generated using pET28a with a His-tag formed a stable complex with the GST-S 1-291 , GST-S 277-794 and GST-S 548-868 . The results showed that the fragment S 277-794 interacted with NCAM. Additionally, these results are supported by the yeast twohybrid system assay. The yeast two-hybrid study showed that the fragments S 1-291 , S 277-794 and S 548-868 are not autoactivating ( table 2 ). The diploid yeast Y1, Y2, Y3, N and P, which were coated on SD/-Leu/-Trp plates, respectively, could grow white colonies ( table 3 ), indicating that these plasmids were successfully transferred to the diploid yeast. The white colonies were inoculated separately on SD/-Leu/-Trp/Xa-Gal/AbA plates. However, only the diploid yeast Y2 and the positive control P grew colonies, which were blue ( table 3 ) . The diploid yeast Y2 could also grow colonies on an SD/-Ade/-His/-Leu/-Trp/Xa-Gal/ AbA plate, and these colonies were also blue ( table 3 ; fig. 6 ). These findings further demonstrate that the amino acid fragment S 277-794 may specifically interact with NCAM; however, there was no interaction between NCAM and the fragments S 1-291 , or S 548-868 .",

            "text": "Based on these results, we found an association between NCAM and S 277-794 ; however, S 1-291 and S 548-868 showed no such association. S 277-794 is located in the S1 subunit. In addition, because S 1-291 and S 548-868 could not interact with NCAM, and there are overlapping regions between S 277-794 and S 1-291 as well as S 277-794 and S 548-868 , we conclude that the S1 subunit may contain a cellular receptor-binding region up to 258 amino acids long. These findings suggested that the 258-amino-acid fragment, residues 291-548, may be the NCAM RBD of the S protein. This region may mediate PHEV binding to NCAM, but further studies are needed to confirm these results. Meanwhile, S 1-291 and S 548-868 did not interact with NCAM and might be less relevant to bind the cellular receptor.",
