CoVs are spherical enveloped viruses with a diameter of 100-160 nm. Each particle contains a positive-sense singlestranded RNA genome of 27-32 kb that interacts with the nucleoprotein. Viral envelope includes three different proteins: Membrane (M), Envelope (E) and Spike (S) proteins. M protein binds nucleocapsids and is involved in viral assembly and budding; E protein contributes to viral morphogenesis and release as well as to pathogenesis. Finally, S protein forms homotrimeric spikes that recognize the cellular receptor, thus allowing viral entry into target cells (Chen, Liu and Guo 2020) .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 712, "end": 736, "text": "(Chen, Liu and Guo 2020)", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "CORONAVIRUSES"}, {"text": "Coronaviruses affecting human health belong to the family of Coronaviridae, subfamily Coronovirinae.

This concept completely changed with the emergence of a highly pathogenic zoonotic disease, the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) caused by the SARS-CoV. SARS mainly presented as a severe pneumonia, involving at the end more than 8000 patients with a fatality rate of roughly 10% (Kuiken et al. 2003; de Wit et al. 2016) . SARS emerged in 2002 in Guangdong (southern China) and over 2003 its travel-related diffusion in 29 countries/regions represented a global health concern (WHO 2020a). However, due to a strong international response based on quarantine procedures, tracing of contacts and control of potential sources of infection, SARS epidemics was blocked before becoming a pandemic disease. At the beginning of the SARS outbreak, the first patients reported an exposure with animals before the onset of symptoms suggesting a zoonotic origin of this syndrome. Several efforts addressed the identification of the source of the infection, a key step for the control procedures to stop the chain of contagion. Seroepidemiology investigations identified masked palm civets (Paguma larvata), sold in a market of live animals, as the possible origin of human infections, as individuals in contact with the same animals were positive for antibodies against SARS-CoV (Cui, Li and Shi 2019) . However, studies in the field suggested that masked palm civets These findings support the hypothesis that bats represent the main viral reservoir for CoVs and that SARS-CoVs originated from bats. Interestingly, Cui and coworkers highlighted that the gene encoding for the S protein, that determines the viral tropism and host spectrum, shows a high level of variability on the receptor binding domain, an indication of viral adaptation in the different bats species and other animal hosts (Cui, Li and Shi 2019) . Of note, among CoVs identified in bats, only one presented a sequence for the S protein that allows the interaction with the angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), the human receptor adopted by the SARS-CoV to infect epithelial cells in the lower respiratory tract. This observation suggests that new spillover events, from animal reservoir to humans, require the modification of the S protein to acquire the ability to infect human cells, a key step to overcome the specie barrier. As expected, in addition to S, other viral genes (such as orf8) can mutate during the viral adaptation to the new host, as reported for the SARS-CoV (Cui, Li and Shi 2019) . Overall, molecular epidemiology and phylogenetic studies on CoVs highlight the plasticity of their genome. The RNA positive CoVs genome is bigger (\u224830 kb) than that of most RNA viruses (\u226410 kb). Data indicate that several recombination events have taken place between the genome of different CoVs. Therefore, the ability to originate new viral variants can promote jumps from bats to other sylvatic animals, the adaptation to the new host and then the transmission to domestic animals or humans (Cui, Li and Shi 2019) . A total of 10 years after the onset of SARS outbreak a new coronavirus jumped from animals to humans causing the lethal Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) (WHO 2020b). The new emerging disease was first identified in humans in 2012 and interested mainly the Kingdom of South Arabia with the majority of reported cases (Zaki et al. 2012) . In comparison to SARS, MERS is still active and sporadic outbreaks have been reported until now. This respiratory disease is particularly severe, accounting for 2465 cases confirmed by laboratory analyses, with a fatal rate of 35% (de Wit et al. 2016; WHO 2020b) . Epidemiological studies have suggested that MERS is due to a CoV transmitted by the contact with dromedary camels or camel products (Chan et al. 2015) . The origin of human infections through the camelids is demonstrated by virus neutralization experiments and by the viral genomic sequence analyses. Interestingly, MERS-CoV-like viruses have been identified in different bat species suggesting that bats functioned as the source of this new human CoV as well. Furthermore it was demonstrated that MERS-CoV can infect bat cells by exploiting the dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP4), the same receptor used to infect human cells (Raj et al. 2013) . Seroepidemiology tests on samples collected from camels suggested that the passage from bats to camel happened more than 30 years ago and that the virus spread to camelids in Middle East, Asia and Africa (M\u00fcller et al. 2014; Cui, Li and Shi 2019) . However, phylogenetic analyses showed a gap between bat CoVs and the MERS-CoV, suggesting the existence of others CoVs that have not been detected yet (Cui, Li and Shi 2019) . Indeed, the number of known CoVs harboured by bats identified in the field studies could increase in the next future.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 253, "end": 286, "text": "(Channappanavar and Perlman 2017)", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}, {"start": 576, "end": 596, "text": "(Kuiken et al. 2003;", "ref_id": "BIBREF13"}, {"start": 597, "end": 616, "text": "de Wit et al. 2016)", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}, {"start": 1563, "end": 1585, "text": "(Cui, Li and Shi 2019)", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 2078, "end": 2100, "text": "(Cui, Li and Shi 2019)", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 2736, "end": 2758, "text": "(Cui, Li and Shi 2019)", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 3256, "end": 3278, "text": "(Cui, Li and Shi 2019)", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 3604, "end": 3622, "text": "(Zaki et al. 2012)", "ref_id": "BIBREF29"}, {"start": 3856, "end": 3876, "text": "(de Wit et al. 2016;", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}, {"start": 3877, "end": 3887, "text": "WHO 2020b)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 4022, "end": 4040, "text": "(Chan et al. 2015)", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}, {"start": 4512, "end": 4529, "text": "(Raj et al. 2013)", "ref_id": "BIBREF21"}, {"start": 4736, "end": 4756, "text": "(M\u00fcller et al. 2014;", "ref_id": "BIBREF18"}, {"start": 4757, "end": 4778, "text": "Cui, Li and Shi 2019)", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 4932, "end": 4954, "text": "(Cui, Li and Shi 2019)", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "CORONAVIRUSES"}, {"text": "At the end of December 2019 the news of an outbreak of a respiratory disease of unknown aetiology in Wuhan city, Hubei province of China, started to circulate around the world (WHO Starting from the experience of SARS outbreak management, with the attempt to control the infection, the market was immediately closed and decontaminated the first of January, 2020. Furthermore, with the increasing of human cases, quarantine of infected or potentially infected individual was adopted, and safety guidelines were issued and publicized to the general population to reduce the chances of infection. The picture of an emerging, rapidly evolving situation quickly appeared, with information increasing day by day (Table 2) . Unfortunately, the number of cases increased at a high rate, and by the 7th of February 31 503 lab-confirmed cases were confirmed with 638 deaths (ECDC 2020a). The virus moved also outside China and human cases were detected in other Countries of Asia (221), and in different continents, such as Europe (31), America (19) and Oceania (15) (ECDC 2020b).

Lopinavir and Ritonavir are known antiretroviral drug targeting protease of the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV).

In agreement, the emergence of the 2019-nCoV highlights the importance of bats as a reservoir for new viruses capable of infecting humans, but also serves as an excellent model to design studies and strategies to prevent future emergence of new zoonotic agents.
