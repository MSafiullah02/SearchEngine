We have developed a simple personal respirator in Southampton (PeRSo), made from cheap, mass-produced components (7, 8). The motor unit fan pulls air through a high efficiency filter, powered by rechargeable batteries. The clear air is delivered into a hood with a clear plastic visor, and passes standard sniff and bacterial tests ( Figure 1 ). We have initiated manufacture locally and are aiming to roll out widely in the United Kingdom, and are investigating components suitable for local production in the developing world (PeRSo-DW). Evidently, implementation challenges exist, but the alternative of waiting for a vaccine indefinitely seem worse in terms of economic impact. As a control strategy, PeRSo use outside the house would be compulsory in areas with active transmission. Once the cycle of transmission is broken, respirator use would be optional. Strengthened public health screening would be required to identify breakdown areas, leading to travel restrictions and return to compulsory PeRSo use. Humans would all look highly unusual, but SARS-CoV-2 would be controlled and this would act as a bridge to a new vaccine or drug therapy. Whilst the costs may seem high, compared to the economic costs of a prolonged lock-down, this is trivial.",
