            "text": "\nAcute gouty arthritis is a crystal-induced inflammation of the joint that primarily affects middle-aged and elderly adults. It is the commonest cause of inflammatory joint disease in men older than 40 years.1 It has been estimated that the overall prevalence in the United Kingdom is 10 per 1,000, with men affected more commonly than women.2 The diagnosis of acute gout is typically made clinically by the presence of rapid onset of severe pain, swelling, and erythema of an affected joint and definitively by demonstrating the presence of negatively birefringent uric acid crystals in aspirated joint fluid. The diagnosis is often made in the absence of joint aspiration because this procedure is painful, poorly tolerated by some patients, and declined by others and is sometimes difficult or inconvenient to perform in a busy emergency department (ED). The treatment of such patients is inconsistent, and evidence-based guidelines to support clinical management are lacking. Gout is an increasingly prevalent condition worldwide and creates a heavy economic burden.1, 3\nEditor\u2019s Capsule Summary\nWhat is already known on this topic\nAcute gouty arthritis is typically treated with nonsteroidal antiinflammatory agents, though prednisone has also been recommended. Their relative efficacy is unknown.\nWhat question this study addressed\nThe efficacy and adverse effects of oral prednisolone and oral indomethacin in the treatment of acute goutlike arthritis in emergency department patients.\nWhat this study adds to our knowledge\nIn this 90-patient randomized controlled trial, the treatments exhibited similar efficacy. Adverse effects were more common in patients given indomethacin, including gastrointestinal bleeding in 11%.\nHow this might change clinical practice\nA short course of prednisolone is at least as effective as indomethacin and may be safer.",

Oral NSAIDs have not been compared to oral steroids in the management of acute gout.",
