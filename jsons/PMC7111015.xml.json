(Fig. 2A\n), while mouse hepatitis virus (MHV), a prototype of coronavirus, causes cell-fusion after infection, and MHV infection induces apoptotic cell death in murine 17Cl-1 cells [13]. To confirm whether SARS-CoV-infection induces apoptosis in Vero E6 cells, cellular DNA was extracted from SARS-CoV-infected cells. At 24 h.p.i., DNA fragmentation typical of apoptosis was observed (Fig. 2B). Avian coronavirus infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) also induces apoptosis in infected Vero cells. Caspase-3, which is one of the main effector caspases and is activated in response to both intracellular and extracellular death signals, was activated by IBV infection [14]. To confirm whether caspase-3 is activated by SARS-CoV-infection, Western blotting analysis was performed using anti-cleaved caspase-3 antibody. During apoptosis, caspase precursors are cleaved at Asp-X sites generating a large and a small subunit, which together constitute the active protease; the anti-caspase-3 antibody used in this study can specifically recognize the large fragment of cleaved caspase-3. As shown in Fig. 2C, the cleaved caspase-3 was detected in SARS-CoV-infected Vero E6 cells as a peak at 24 h.p.i. These results indicated that SARS-CoV induces apoptosis in the infected cells.",

Synthetic dsRNA poly(I)\u2013poly(C) activates p38 MAPK and JNK/SAPK pathways in fibroblasts [15]: hence, double-stranded RNA intermediates of SARS-CoV that accumulate in infected cells may also trigger the p38 MAPK activation pathway. It was reported that p38 MAPK was activated in MHV-infected cells, and MHV replication has been shown to be necessary for p38 MAPK activation [7]. Therefore, the kinetics of p38 MAPK activation in SARS-CoV-infected Vero E6 cells were analyzed. Vero E6 cells were infected with SARS-CoV at an m.o.i. of 5, and cell extracts were prepared at various times p.i. Western blotting analysis indicated an increase in the amount of phosphorylated p38 MAPK in the cells (Fig. 3\n). The p38 MAPK phosphorylation was not transient and reached the maximal level at 18 h.p.i. The role of p38 MAPK signaling pathway in cellular responses is diverse, depending on the cell type and stimulation. Thus, the p38 MAPK signaling pathway promotes both cell death and survival [16], [17], [18]. Therefore, investigation of the p38 MAPK-downstream targets is important to understand the mechanisms of cell death induced by SARS-CoV-infection.",

MSK-1 is thought to be a substrate of p38 MAPK and/or extracellular signal-related kinase (ERK)1/2. CREB was identified as an activator that responds to the cAMP-dependent signaling pathway and is also known to mediate an important survival signal under various conditions [22], [23], [24]. For example, the anti-apoptotic genes Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL are activated transcriptionally by phosphorylation of CREB in response to insulin-like growth factor (IGF)-I stimulation in PC-12 cells [25], [26]. Immunoblot analysis (Fig. 5\n) indicated that the level of phosphorylated CREB was increased by SARS-CoV-infection. The anti-phospho CREB antibody used in this study also recognizes activation transcription factor (ATF)-1, which is a transcription factor. ATF-1 is a member of the CREB/ATF family that is phosphorylated by the cAMP-dependent protein kinase A (PKA) [27]. ATF-1 and CREB act as survival factors [28]. This result suggested that phosphorylation of CREB and ATF-1 induces an anti-apoptotic environment in SARS-CoV-infected cells.",

Fifty percent confluency of Vero E6 cells were treated with 0, 10, 20, 30, 40, and 50 \u03bcM inhibitors in DMSO for 24, 48, and 72 h, and then cell viability was assayed using WST-1 system (Roche Diagnostics). Treating cells with up to 50 \u03bcM all inhibitors had little effect on cell viability (data not shown). Next, we examined the determination of specific inhibitory doses of p38 MAPK inhibitor in SARS-CoV-infected Vero E6 cells. SARS-CoV were infected to Vero E6 cells for 1 h, and then, three kinds of inhibitors were added to the cells. Proteins were harvested at 18 h.p.i. Western blot analysis was performed using anti-phospho CREB, HSP-27, and eIF4E antibodies (Fig. 7\n). The result shows that the eIF4E was effectively inhibited to be of phosphorylated type by p38 inhibitor between 10 and 50 \u03bcM. The effective dose for inhibition of CREB phosphorylation was more than 20 \u03bcM, and phosphorylated HSP-27 was not detected at 40 and 50 \u03bcM. Thus, this result indicated that CREB, HSP-27, and eIF4E were specifically phosphorylated by p38 MAPK, because both the ERK1/2 and JNK inhibitors did not inhibit those of phosphorylation between 10 and 50 \u03bcM. The 20 \u03bcM SB203580 was used in the study of MHV [7] and this concentration is known to efficiently block p38 MAPK activity in vivo [32]. Therefore, we used 20 and 30 \u03bcM SB 203580 in subsequent experiments.",

Activated p38 MAPK and the downstream target, eIF4E, increased translation of MHV-specific proteins. We also found that eIF4E was activated in SARS-CoV-infection at 18 h.p.i. (Fig. 7). At that time of p.i., there was no significant difference in the amount of N protein of SARS-CoV among three inhibitor-treated cells and untreated cells. Kinetic study of N protein synthesis (Fig. 1A) showed that N protein seems to be the maximum amount in viral infected cells between 12 and 18 h.p.i. To investigate whether enhancement of virus-specific protein synthesis through virus-induced eIF4E activation occurs in SARS-CoV-infected cells, we tested the effect of p38 MAPK inhibitor, SB203580, on SARS-CoV-specific protein synthesis at early time p.i. Ten m.o.i. of SARS-CoV was inoculated in Vero E6 cells for 1 h, and then, the cells were washed two times. These cells were treated with 20 and 30 \u03bcM SB203580 for 6, 9, and 12 h.p.i. Western blot analysis showed that kinetics of SARS-CoV-specific protein accumulation in infected Vero E6 cells in the presence and absence of SB 203580 were similar (Fig. 8A\n). The phosphorylated eIF4E was detected at least 6 h.p.i. (Fig. 7) in SARS-CoV-infected cells. Taken together, SARS-CoV does not utilize activated eIF4E for its viral protein synthesis in Vero E6 cells. In addition, the CPEs caused by SARS-CoV-infection were slightly inhibited by SB203580 at late time p.i. (Fig. 8B).",

Further studies are needed to determine which target molecules of p38 MAPK have inductive and preventative effects on apoptosis.
