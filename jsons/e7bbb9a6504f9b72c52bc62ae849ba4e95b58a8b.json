By constructing scenarios with different combinations of NPIs, our empirical findings suggest that countries may avoid the lockdown policy with imposing school closure, mask wearing and centralized quarantine to reach similar outcomes on controlling the COVID-19 infection. Our results also suggest that, as of April 4th, 2020, certain countries such as the U.S. and Singapore may require additional measures of NPIs in order to control disease transmissions more effectively, while other countries may cautiously consider to gradually lift some NPIs to mitigate the costs to the overall economy.",

            "text": "Since December 2019, a coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has been spreading in China and now emerging as a global pandemic. In response to the COVID-19 crisis, many countries have ordered unprecedented non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs), including travel restriction, mask wearing, lockdown, social distancing, school closure, and centralized quarantine (such as cabin hospitals), all aiming to reduce the population contact rates and thus mitigate the virus transmission. On the other hand, prolonged NPIs have a large downside impact on the overall economic and social well-being, which may cause major concerns including increased unemployment rates and bankruptcy of firms. Therefore, it is of the utmost importance to investigate which interventions and to what extend have substantial impact on controlling the epidemiological dynamics, and how to choose the appropriate measures to fit country-specific socioeconomic circumstance. Understanding the impact of various NPIs on a global scale can provide insights for each country to choose the most cost-effective NPIs in a timely manner to contain and mitigate the virus spread.",

[44] applied the Bass Susceptible-Infected-Recovered (Bass-SIR) model to study the lockdown and social distancing effects for province-specific epidemiological parameters in China.

[41] modified an individual-based simulation model to study the consequence of NPIs to reduce the COVID-19 mortality and healthcare demand in the UK and the U.S. [48] developed a Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious-Removed (SEIR) model to evaluated the impact of NPIs on the epidemic in Wuhan, China. [45] built a travel network-based SEIR model to study the impact of different NPIs in China.

First, while many countries imposed travel restrictions for passengers coming directly from China, they did not ban travels from other international destinations, which may not be an effective policy as people who were infected could still come across the border by connecting to a third country. Second, given that SD intervention came very close to SC and LD interventions, we may view SD as a weaker intervention than LD, while it is stronger than SC. Hence the inclusion of SC and LD would be a strong proxy for SD. In addition, the coefficients for MW, LD, SC, CQ are all positive, which implies that these interventions are effective in reducing COVID-19 transmission rate. Table 2 also indicates that CQ is the most effective NPI to mitigate the COVID-19 transmission, while LD, SC and MW also play an important role. In our subsequent scenario analyses, we primarily focus on the 4 NPIs with statistically significant positive coefficients (i.e., MW, LD, SC, CQ).",

For the U.S., although imposing two NPIs can still enable the country to reach the turning points in late April (April 25th for SC+CQ, April 25th for MW+SC, and April 22nd for MW+CQ), but after passing the turning point, the transmission rates drop very slowly, with the curve for active cases remain relative flat.
