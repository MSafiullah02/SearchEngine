Genome sequencing of the virus isolated from a patient's lower respiratory tract on 10 January 2020 confirmed that this is a new type of coronavirus. Two days later, the World Health Organization (WHO) termed this pathogen \u201c2019 novel coronavirus (2019\u2010nCoV).\u201d On 20 January 2020, the National Health Commission of the People's Republic of China (PRC) formally incorporated the disease caused by the virus, known as COVID\u201019, into the Class B infectious diseases stipulated in \u201cthe Law of the People's Republic of China on the Prevention and Control of Infectious Diseases,\u201d and adopted measures for the prevention and control of class A infectious diseases.\n2\n On 7 February 2020, the National Health Commission named the latest type of coronavirus\u2010infected pneumonia as \u201cnovel coronavirus pneumonia.\u201d On 11 February 2020, the Coronavirus Study Group of the International Commission on Virus Classification named the new coronavirus \u201cSevere Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS\u2010CoV\u20102).\u201d On the same day, the WHO named the disease caused by the new coronavirus as coronavirus disease\u20102019 (COVID\u201019). After evaluation, on 12 March 2020, the WHO announced that COVID\u201019 had reached pandemic status.\n3\n\n",

            "text": "Current investigations have determined that SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 belongs to a new type of coronavirus family, namely, genus \u03b2. Its genetic characteristics are distinctly different from those of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS\u2010CoV) and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS\u2010CoV). SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 is more than 85% homologous to bat SARS\u2010like CoV (bat\u2010SL\u2010CoVZC45). The Wuhan Institute of Virology (Wuhan, Hebei Province, China) also obtained evidence that SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 originated from bats and confirmed that SARS\u2010CoV\u20102, similar to SARS\u2010CoV, enters cells by binding to the angiotensin\u2010converting enzyme 2 (ACE\u20102) cell receptor.\n1\n Subsequently, the South China Agricultural University (Guangdong, China) targeted pangolins as a potential intermediate host for SARS\u2010CoV\u20102. A study by Wong et al\n4\n reported that SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 and Malay pangolin recombinant coronavirus share 98% amino acid homology and 89% nucleotide homology for the same receptor binding motif fragment. Zhou et al\n5\n used cryo\u2010electron microscopy to analyze the full\u2010length structure of the SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 receptor, namely, ACE\u20102, for the first time, which will be helpful in developing inhibitors to block entry of the virus into cells. On 21 February 2020, Thi et al proposed that active SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 can be produced and transformed based on viral genetic structure, which is important in understanding and predicting development trends of the virus and the disease.\n6\n On 3 March 2020, Tang et al\n7\n described the genome evolution of 103 new coronaviruses and found that SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 has evolved into two subtypes, L and S, and the virus strain has 149 mutation points more common in the early stages of the Wuhan outbreak; as such, it is speculated that it is more infectious and capable of spreading.",

            "text": "COVID\u201019 was predominantly more prevalent among adults more than or equal to 15 years of age in the early stages of the outbreak, and the proportion of confirmed cases among children was relatively small. Since then, however, more regions have launched pathogen detection campaigns and, because younger children cannot wear masks and have not taken other special preventive and control measures, the number of child infection cases has increased significantly, especially in younger age groups and, therefore, should be given high attention.\n8\n On 2 February 2020, the PRC issued a notice on \u201cdoing a good job in the prevention and control of pneumonia outbreaks in children and pregnant women with new coronavirus infection,\u201d which clearly states that children are susceptible to SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 due to the immaturity of their immune systems.\n1\n The latest guidelines also make it clear that all individuals, including children, are generally susceptible to SARS\u2010CoV\u20102.\n9\n Furthermore, children exhibit certain particularities and cannot clearly describe their own health status or contact history, which has contributed to the severe challenge of protecting, diagnosing, and treating this population.\n10\n Due to the increasing global spread of SARS\u2010CoV\u20102, China is now facing the risk of transmission of imported cases, which poses new challenges for the prevention and control of the COVID\u201019 epidemic among Chinese children. At the same time, children with other (ie, comorbid) diseases (such as congenital heart, lung and airway diseases, malnutrition, and tumors, etc) are vulnerable to infection with SARS\u2010CoV\u20102; more specifically, \u201cprone to severe illness.\u201d\n11\n The present article reviews the epidemiological characteristics of COVID\u201019 in children.",

            "text": "As of 24:00, 26 March 2020, China's 31 provinces (autonomous regions and municipalities) and the Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps had reported a total of 81 340 confirmed cases, 3292 deaths, 74 588 discharged patients, and 189 suspected cases of COVID\u201019. A total of 738 confirmed cases were also reported in Hong Kong (n = 453), Macao (n = 33), and Taiwan (n = 252). The cumulative number of confirmed cases in America ranks first outside of China, reaching 83 507.\n12\n After the nation's concerted efforts to fight the spread of the virus, the epidemic situation in China was gradually brought under control. On 26 March 2020, there were only 55 new confirmed cases across China, 54 of which were imported, and one of which was from Zhejiang, China. Current case data in China reveal that children less than 18 years of age accounted for only 2.4% of all reported cases.\n11\n As of 15 February 2020, incomplete statistics from China (excluding Hubei region) cumulatively reported 300 confirmed cases involving children\n13\n and, as of 26 February 2020, the total number of confirmed cases in Wuhan, China was 490.\n14\n Two children with COVID\u201019 were diagnosed in Germany on 4 February 2020\n1\n and a 5\u2010year\u2010old child in the Philippines was also diagnosed.\n15\n Canada reported the first confirmed case of COVID\u201019, who still carries the virus after rehabilitation and discharge, and is a possible communicator.\n16\n Zou et al\n17\n analyzed the relationship between viral load and symptoms of infection in 18 patients with COVID\u201019, and found that the pattern of viral nucleic acid excretion in those with SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 infection was similar to that of influenza and that the viral load determined in asymptomatic patients was similar to that of those with symptoms, which indirectly suggested potential transmission capacity in asymptomatic or mild cases with COVID\u201019. Current studies have shown that the incubation period of SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 is 1 to 14 days, and most commonly 3 to 7 days.\n9\n However, Guan et al\n18\n described a patient with an incubation period of up to 24 days. Subsequently, Bai et al\n19\n reported a patient with an incubation period of up to 19 days, who was also the first asymptomatic infection in China. Children, generally, have low immunity and some exhibit a long incubation period after SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 infection. Therefore, children should try to avoid contact with complex populations to avoid being infected by potential spreaders. COVID\u201019 is an acute, self\u2010limiting disease; nevertheless, patients can die, with a mortality rate of 2%,\n20\n and have also been reported in critically ill children.\n21\n Compared with the current COVID\u201019 epidemic, during the outbreak of SARS\u2010CoV, the number of confirmed in children cases (4 months to 17 years of age) worldwide was less than 0.02% of the total number of cases (no deaths were confirmed in children), and children with severe cases accounted for \u223c7.9%, and the vast majority of these had a history of family exposure or adult contacts, while a few had a history of travel in affected areas and a history of exposure in the hospital. Of the 1621 confirmed cases of MERS\u2010CoV reported globally, children less than 19 years of age accounted for \u223c2.2%. Of the 14 pediatric cases (8 months to 16 years of age), nine (64%) were children infected after home exposure, but all were asymptomatic: five (36%) were in the hospital and at home, with a history of internal exposure were symptomatic infections, of whom two (14.3%) exhibited mild respiratory symptoms, three (21.4%) had pneumonia; and two (14.3%) children with underlying diseases complicated by severe respiratory distress died from it.\n22\n Due to its rapid spread and the insufficient clinical analysis of children with SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 infection, we reference the epidemic characteristics of children in the SARS\u2010CoV and MERS\u2010CoV period to provide clues for effective prevention.",

Children are a very special group, largely due to close family contacts, and may be susceptible to cross\u2010infection. According to existing epidemiological data, 56% (34/61) of children with COVID\u201019 demonstrated clear evidence of transmission through family gatherings.\n23\n China's first newborn COVID\u201019 patient was diagnosed at 17 days of age, first confirmed in the family nursing staff, followed by the parents, who were also diagnosed with COVID\u201019.\n24\n A 5\u2010day\u2010old neonatal COVID\u201019 patient, whose mother was also confirmed to be infected with SARS\u2010CoV\u20102, and a newborn with suspected disease from cesarean delivery was confirmed to be infected with SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 36 hours after birth, followed by his mother who was diagnosed with COVID\u201019 shortly after giving birth.\n25\n On 26 January 2020, a 3\u2010month\u2010old baby and its parents in Hubei Province, China, were both confirmed to be infected with SARS\u2010CoV\u20102.\n26\n On 19 January 2020, a hospital in Shanghai, China, admitted a 7\u2010year\u2010old boy diagnosed with SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 infection, whose father was diagnosed with COVID\u201019 earlier than the child.\n27\n On 11 January 2020, a case of asymptomatic infection was found in a 10\u2010year\u2010old boy in Shenzhen, Guangdong, China, whose parents, grandparents, and grandparents all developed fever, diarrhea, cough, and other symptoms, and were diagnosed with COVID\u201019 earlier than the boy.\n28\n According to the epidemic situation described by Anhui Provincial Health Commission on 28 and 29 January 2020, a family of six in Huangshan city, Anhui, China, was confirmed to have COVID\u201019, including an 8\u2010month\u2010old baby and a 10\u2010year\u2010old child.\n1\n These cases were found in family clusters. Wei et al\n8\n performed a study on nine infant COVID\u201019 patients, revealing that they all had at least one family member who had been infected with SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 earlier, among which seven infants lived in Wuhan, China or had family members who had traveled to Wuhan. The parents of a 6\u2010month\u2010old baby in Singapore were infected with SARS\u2010CoV\u20102. After the parents were diagnosed, the baby was initially asymptomatic but was admitted to the hospital due to close contact. The baby was diagnosed with SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 the day after admission.\n29\n The average incubation period for COVID\u201019 in children is \u223c6.5 days, which is longer than the 5.4 days reported in adults. The average number of secondary infections transmitted within the family was 2.43. The duration of nasal and pharyngeal detoxification in children is 6 to 21 days (average 12 days).\n30\n An epidemiological analysis of 31 children with COVID\u201019 in six provinces (autonomous region) of northern China found that 21 (68%) had contact with an adult with confirmed disease. One (3%), who had contact with asymptomatic Wuhan return Township staff (without nucleic acid testing), became ill after 5 days, and 28 of these 31 children (90%) were clustered in families.\n31\n\n",

Spread is also possible through the conjunctiva, and the presence of SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 in relatively closed environments with prolonged exposure to high concentrations of aerosols may also facilitate transmission. More specifically, the air\u2010tightness of the environment and the density of viruses per unit volume can affect the spread of SARS\u2010CoV\u20102.\n9\n Because SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 binds to the ACE2 receptor, the virus must first come in contact with cells that express the receptor. Human mucosal cells express ACE2 receptors, and the lips, eyelids, and nasal cavities, which are exposed to the air, have a large number of mucosal cells. SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 binds to ACE2 receptors in close contact and conjunctival transmission without proper cleaning, disinfection and direct contact with eye, mouth, and nose. Teams headed by Lu and Xia both have shown that infectious droplets and body fluids can contaminate the human conjunctival epithelium. The respiratory virus can cause ocular complications in infected patients, which in turn lead to respiratory tract infection; thus, exposure to SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 may cause acute respiratory tract infection.\n44\n, \n45\n Similarly, ACE2 receptors are present in human lung AT2 cells\n46\n; as such, an infection can be caused by exposure to respiratory droplets as well as aerosol transmission. To reduce the probability of SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 infection in children and avoid potential hospital transmission through aerosol the route, digestive endoscopy centers, fever clinics, and others have issued relevant emergency plans and management measures during the epidemic period.\n47\n, \n48\n\n",

Therefore, intestinal symptoms of SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 may be associated with invasion of intestinal epithelial cells expressing ACE2.\n46\n In an earlier report from Wuhan, China, 2% to 10% of patients with COVID\u201019 experienced gastrointestinal symptoms such as diarrhea, abdominal pain, and vomiting. Patients with SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 infection who were transferred to the intensive care unit exhibited a higher frequency of abdominal pain than those with SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 infection who did not require intensive care, and 10% of patients with COVID\u201019 experienced diarrhea and nausea symptoms in the 1 to 2 days before the onset of fever and respiratory symptoms.\n49\n A study from the USA reported detected SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 RNA in the feces of a patient.\n50\n Given that both SARS\u2010CoV and MERS\u2010CoV can be excreted through feces and remain viable under conditions conducive to transmission, it is speculated that SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 may also be transmitted through this route. Guan et al\n18\n isolated SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 from the urine of a COVID\u201019 patient. This suggests that viral nucleic acids may persist in bodily fluids, secretions, and excreta of patients with COVID\u201019, and that the digestive tract is a potential route of transmission. Viral nucleic acids may also be detected in the cerebrospinal fluid, pleural effusions, and additional specimens from patients with COVID\u201019 in the future. A study by Cai et al\n30\n revealed that viral RNA from feces of children with COVID\u201019 was detected at a high rate, and the detoxification period can be as long as 2 to 4 weeks. Xu et al performed nucleic acid testing on anal swabs from 10 children with COVID\u201019 and found that the duration of positivity in anal swabs and intestinal detoxification was longer. The longest time for the nucleic acid test to change from positive to negative in anal swabs from 10 children was 51 days; the time for a throat swab nucleic acid test in these 10 children to change from positive to negative was generally 1 week. At the same time, this study demonstrated that anal swab testing in children may be more useful than nasopharyngeal swab testing in determining the effectiveness of treatment and determining the timing of quarantine termination.\n51\n However, there was no direct evidence of fecal\u2010oral transmission because the study did not capture live viruses.",

All patients in the study were in the late stages of pregnancy; as such, evidence of intrauterine vertical transmission was insufficient. Nevertheless, the possibility of early or mid\u2010gestational vertical transmission could not be determined. In addition, the study did not collect vaginal mucosal samples or birth canal shedding samples; therefore, it was not possible to analyze whether SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 infection could be transmitted during vaginal delivery.\n53\n It is also uncertain whether breastfeeding leads to vertical transmission from mother to child. There is no direct evidence of vertical mother\u2010to\u2010child transmission; however, newborns can be infected through close contact. Zhu et al\n54\n considered neonates to be at high risk for SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 infection if they met the following criteria: the mother experienced persistent fever before, during, or after childbirth, and routine laboratory investigations revealed a decrease in lymphocyte ratio; chest CT revealed lung infiltration, based on viral nucleic acid test results and epidemiological history suggesting that the mother is a confirmed/highly suspected case (remove other viral and bacterial infections, mycoplasma infections, puerperal fever, breast swelling, mastitis, and other obstetric conditions); newborn whose mother has clinical manifestations or epidemiological history of infection, but not sufficiently suspicious to definitively diagnose; newborns with a history of infection epidemiology, including those from community sources and obstetric mother\u2010infant same\u2010room sources, family members or caregivers, and visitors who are diagnosed/highly suspected with SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 infection; and, finally, newborns living in or visiting environments at high risk for SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 infection.\n54\n\n",

A few children do not exhibit fever, but only manifest cough or diarrhea, and even fewer can be asymptomatic carriers. Some children and newborns exhibit atypical symptoms, manifested as vomiting, diarrhea, and other gastrointestinal symptoms, or only asthma and shortness of breath.\n10\n, \n58\n The first severe case of childhood infection reported in Wuhan, China, started with gastrointestinal symptoms, exhibited no obvious early respiratory manifestations, but progressed rapidly to acute respiratory distress syndrome.\n21\n According to clinical characteristics of existing pediatric cases, children with COVID\u201019 can be divided into five clinical types: asymptomatic infection, mild, common, severe, and critically severe.\n11\n One published study reported that among 134 children diagnosed, 89 exhibited fever (high fever [n = 11], low and medium fever [n = 17], and unknown [n = 61]), and 28 exhibited no fever. Fever duration was mostly 1 to 2 days, and the longest was 8 days. Most routine blood examinations were normal, and C\u2010reactive protein levels were normal or transiently increased (three cases > 20 mg/L [23, 27, and 47 mg/L, respectively]).\n58\n Of 54 patients with pulmonary imaging data, 38 (70.4%) exhibited ground\u2010glass opacities or exudates, infiltrative lesions; 4 (7.4%) exhibited enhanced lung texture; and 12 (22.2%) had no abnormalities. Five patients, who were negative at the time of throat swab virus nucleic acid testing, were children: two at 9 days after illness; and three at 12 days after illness. Two critically ill patients had a history of underlying disease, and one was after congenital heart disease 7 months with moderate malnutrition; the one other had bilateral hydronephrosis and left kidney stones. Of the 134 confirmed cases of disease in children, if chest imaging was used as the basis for the diagnosis of pneumonia, 36 patients exhibited the common type (26.9%, including seven cases, were subclinical); two cases were critically ill (1.5%); nine cases were completely asymptomatic with normal lung imaging and asymptomatic infection (6.7%); and 87 cases were mild (64.9%).\n27\n The data show that the prevalence of disease in children less than or equal to 18 years of age is relatively low, accounting for \u223c2.4% of all reported cases,\n59\n and clinical characteristics of adult cases (severe symptoms and long detoxification time). In comparison, most children diagnosed with the disease experience mild symptoms, faster recovery, shorter detoxification time, and good prognosis. Xu et al conducted nucleic acid tests on 745 children and 3174 adults with a history of close contact with COVID\u201019 patients or whose family members have confirmed COVID\u201019. They found that only 10 children tested positive, accounting for 1.3% of the total number of children, and 111 adults tested positive, accounting for 3.5%. Among these 10 children with COVID\u201019, body temperature, routine blood tests, and chest computed tomography tests showed that, compared with adults, children with COVID\u201019 were less ill and exhibited less obvious symptoms, and were not typical.\n51\n Although the incidence of critical illness in children is low, the current incidence is sufficient to alert pediatricians.
