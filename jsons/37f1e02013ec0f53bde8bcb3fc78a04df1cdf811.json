Routine cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis can be extended through the calculation of the albumin quotient (Q alb ), a marker of the integrity of the blood-brain barrier (BBB), and IgG index, an estimate of intrathecal IgG synthesis. Objectives: The purpose of this study was to validate nephelometric methods for CSF protein analysis, and to use the Q alb and IgG index to discriminate blood-and brain-derived immunoglobulin fractions in cats with feline infectious peritonitis (FIP). Methods: Cats presented to our clinic between 2001 and 2005 were included in the study based on clinical and laboratory data and histopathologic findings at necropsy. Cats were grouped as having nonneurologic disease (controls; n = 37), brain tumors (n = 8), FIP involving the CNS (n = 12), and extraneural FIP (n = 12). CSF-total protein (TP) was measured and albumin and IgG concentrations were measured in paired CSF/serum samples; Q alb and IgG index were calculated. Intraassay and interassay precision of the nephelometric assays were determined using pooled samples. Results: Coefficients of variation for the nephelometric assays ranged from 2.7% to 7.2%. In control cats, CSF-TP concentration ranged from 0.06 to 0.36 g/L, Q alb ranged from 0.6 to 5.7 \u00c2 10 \u00c03 , and IgG index ranged from 0.3 to 0.6. Q alb and IgG index were significantly higher in cats with brain tumors and cats with CNS-FIP compared with other groups. Compared with control cats, pleocytosis was evident in 8 of 12 (67%) cats and CSF-TP was increased in 3 of 12 (25%) cats with CNS-FIP. Conclusion: Nephelometry is a reliable method for measurement of CSF protein, albumin, and IgG in cats. The Q alb and IgG index did not identify a CSF protein pattern specific for BBB dysfunction or intrathecal IgG synthesis in cats with CNS-FIP.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Abstract"}], "body_text": [{"text": "Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis is the method of choice to diagnose central nervous system (CNS) inflammation and thus provides the basis for appropriate treatment in human and veterinary medicine.

Historically, intrathecal immunoglobulin synthesis was proven by calculation of the IgG index. 3, 4 More recently, a hyperbolic function reflecting laws of diffusion combined with individual CSF flow rate was finally confirmed as the best description of CSF protein profiles in humans. 5 By using these ''Reiberdiagrams,'' the CSF/serum IgG quotient (Q IgG ) is compared with the Q alb and used as a benchmark of intrathecal IgG synthesis and BBB dysfunction. Furthermore the Q IgG and the CSF/serumspecific antibody quotient (Q spec ) have been used to calculate the antibody-specific index (ASI = Q spec /Q IgG ) in people. This index discriminates between blood-derived antibody and pathologic, brain-derived-specific antibody fractions in CSF and takes changes in BBB function into account. 6 In animals, the application of similar coefficients has been investigated but has not yet gained unequivocal acceptance. [7] [8] [9] [10] Nephelometry is a preferred method for measuring CSF protein concentrations and establishing CSF/ serum quotients in people 11 ; to the authors' knowledge this method has not yet been used for protein measurement in cats and only a few studies have been published in dogs and horses. [12] [13] [14] Nephelometry is based on an optical detection system that measures the intensity of scattered light emanating from an illuminated volume. The signal of the scattered light is transformed into an electrical signal that is proportional to the concentration of the dispersed particles and therefore also to the antigen concentration. Measurements are done using the ''fixed-time-method,'' whereby a difference is calculated between 2 values measured at different times. Nephelometric analysis is always performed in the presence of antibody excess according to the principles of Heidelberger and Kendall, 15 thus ensuring precise results, creating minimal need for repeated measurements, and covering a wide range of measurement with the antibody excess curve. 12 At present, there is no standardization of measurement of CSF total protein (CSF-TP) in animals, and a variety of methods and standards are utilized in veterinary laboratories. Historically, high-resolution protein electrophoresis has been used for CSF albumin and IgG determination. Nephelometry has been proven to be a precise method for measurement of CSF proteins in dogs and horses but requires expensive equipment. 12, 13 The purpose of this prospective study was first to validate nephelometry for CSF-TP, albumin, and immunoglobulin concentrations in cats. As feline infectious peritonitis (FIP) is characterized by marked vasculitis, which may influence BBB integrity and intrathecal IgG production, the second aim of the study was to evaluate the use of Q alb , IgG index, and ASI as parameters of BBB function, intrathecal IgG production, and specific intrathecal antibody synthesis in cats with FIP and clinical controls.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 118, "end": 119, "text": "2", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}, {"start": 372, "end": 374, "text": "3,", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 375, "end": 376, "text": "4", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 563, "end": 564, "text": "5", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 1072, "end": 1073, "text": "6", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}, {"start": 1195, "end": 1198, "text": "[7]", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}, {"start": 1199, "end": 1202, "text": "[8]", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}, {"start": 1203, "end": 1206, "text": "[9]", "ref_id": "BIBREF8"}, {"start": 1207, "end": 1211, "text": "[10]", "ref_id": "BIBREF9"}, {"start": 1336, "end": 1338, "text": "11", "ref_id": "BIBREF10"}, {"start": 1496, "end": 1500, "text": "[12]", "ref_id": "BIBREF11"}, {"start": 1501, "end": 1505, "text": "[13]", "ref_id": "BIBREF12"}, {"start": 1506, "end": 1510, "text": "[14]", "ref_id": "BIBREF13"}, {"start": 2269, "end": 2271, "text": "12", "ref_id": "BIBREF11"}, {"start": 2693, "end": 2696, "text": "12,", "ref_id": "BIBREF11"}, {"start": 2697, "end": 2699, "text": "13", "ref_id": "BIBREF12"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Introduction"}, {"text": "Client-owned cats referred to the Clinic for Small Animal Medicine, Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich, that were euthanized between August 2001 and June 2004 because of neurologic or nonneurologic diseases were randomly selected for use in the study.

On the other hand, 1 cat with B-cell lymphoma and 1 with fibrous meningioma had an increased IgG index despite a normal CSF-TP and Q alb . Therefore, passive passage of Igs appears unlikely.

The possibility that CSF examination and histopathology were done too early in the course of the disease with inadequate activation of immune defense systems was excluded. This was based on the knowledge that although clinical signs of FIP may appear acutely in some cats, the pathogenesis of FIP lesions is usually more chronic. Furthermore, IgG might have precipitated in the lesions in the form of immune complexes. This phenomenon also accounts for the fact that about 10% of cats with clinical signs of FIP are antibody-negative in the blood. 52 Besides increased permeability of the BBB, reduced CSF flow rate is thought to modulate the concentration of protein in the CSF. 29 In CNS-FIP, hydrocephalus can result from impaired resorption of CSF due to deposition of immune complexes around the meninges and the choroid plexus. 53 Interestingly, the second highest values for Q alb and IgG index were found in a cat with hydrocephalus and CNS-FIP.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 1228, "end": 1230, "text": "52", "ref_id": "BIBREF51"}, {"start": 1360, "end": 1362, "text": "29", "ref_id": "BIBREF28"}, {"start": 1514, "end": 1516, "text": "53", "ref_id": "BIBREF52"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "Measurement of CSF antibody titers has been advocated in cats for the diagnosis of FIP. 7,30 However, when serum antibody titers are increased, it may be difficult to determine whether the CSF antibodies are produced locally or blood-derived.
