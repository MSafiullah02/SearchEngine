Therapy by the referring veterinary surgeon with ampicillin (Amfipen tablets, Intervet, Milton Keynes, UK) 14 mg/kg BID PO was associated with mild improvement. The ophthalmic examination at the time of referral confirmed exophthalmos and mydriasis of the right eye. The direct PLR on the right was reduced, but the consensual PLR from right to left was present. Menace responses were present bilaterally. At this stage no visual deficits were noticed. The remainder of the ophthalmic examination and a neurological examination were unremarkable. The dog was bright alert and responsive. An ultrasound (Vingmed System 5, General Electric, Fairfield, CT) examination of the right eye was normal. Based on these findings damage to the right sided peripheral oculomotor nerve was suspected. Differential diagnoses included inflammatory/infectious, vascular and neoplastic diseases.",

A right\u2010sided exophthalmos was documented which was caused by diffuse swelling of orbital tissues, affecting mainly the extra\u2010ocular muscles, with obliteration of the orbital fat. The pre\u2010 and basisphenoid bones were thickened and showed loss of normal bone marrow intensity on T1W images (Fig. 1). There was an abnormal, diffuse contrast enhancement of the extra ocular muscles. Less dramatic changes were also seen affecting the left orbit. Marked enhancement of the sphenoid bones, ventral meninges and also of the ventral surface of the brain was detected, surrounding the optic chiasm (Fig. 2). A cerebellomedullary cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) sample revealed a marked increased nucleated cell count (2610 cells/\u00b5L; reference range (ref.) 0\u20135 cells/\u00b5L), and a moderate to marked increase in protein (0.87 g/L; ref. 0.0\u20130.35 g/L), with no red blood cells present.

At re\u2010examination 4 days later the exophthalmos was less severe, but the dog showed bilateral visual impairment when performing an obstacle course. Menace responses remained normal bilaterally. Another re\u2010examination 3 days later still revealed reduced vision but with some improvement when accomplishing another obstacle course. At this point, the treatment was changed to cephalexin (Ceporex\u00ae, Schering\u2010Plough Animal Health, Harefield, UK) 20 mg/kg BID PO, lincomycin (Lincocin\u00ae, Pfizer) 11 mg/kg BID PO and carprofen (Zenacarp\u00ae, Pfizer) 2 mg/kg BID PO and continued for 3 weeks in total. On re\u2010examination 1 week later the dog's vision was still impaired, but had further improved, which was evident when performing an obstacle course. The PLR was present in both eyes, but a moderate mydriasis was still evident in the right eye. A rotary nystagmus was noted in the left eye suggestive of vestibular dysfunction, but no further diagnostic investigation was performed at this time.

Ophthalmic examination revealed the absence of menace responses and reduction of direct and consensual PLRs bilaterally. Both optic nerve heads appeared swollen. In addition a neurological examination revealed a depressed mental status, disorientation and ataxia. The remainder of the ophthalmic and neurological examination was unremarkable. Electroretinography was unremarkable in both eyes. Therefore bilateral optic nerve or optic chiasm disease was considered with the differential diagnosis including inflammatory/infectious and neoplastic causes. Routine hematology and serum biochemistry were within normal limits. Polymerase chain reaction for canine distemper virus, Toxoplasma gondii and Neospora caninum were negative in blood and CSF. A MRI (1.5 T scanner, GE Signa, GE Medical Systems, Milwaukee, WI) of the head was performed. Imaging parameters included transverse T1W images and T1W images after administration of gadobenate dimeglumin, MultiHance\u00ae) in bolus of 0.05 mmol/kg IV in all three planes. Transverse T2W and gradient echo images were also obtained. Pathological changes identified included a uniform low\u2010signal intensity of the entire presphenoid bone (Fig. 3). There was a subtle decreased signal intensity of the adjacent optic chiasm. The ventral surface of the brain adjacent to the presphenoid bone was displaced dorsally with a thin hyperintense band of tissue between the brain and the bone. Post\u2010contrast images showed diffuse enhancement of the presphenoid bone surrounding the optic chiasm and the optic nerves and abnormal meningeal enhancement within the rostral aspect of the brain (Fig. 4). Cerebellomedullary CSF analysis revealed an elevated nucleated cell count (19 cells/\u00b5L; ref. 0\u20135 cells/\u00b5L) with a predominantly lymphocytic cell population.

After 10 months of complete remission the dog showed visual deficits again. Ophthalmic and neurological examination at this stage did not reveal any additional abnormalities. A repeat MRI study was performed including transverse T1W images, pre\u2010 and post\u2010paramagnetic contrast medium (gadobenate dimeglumin, MultiHance\u00ae) administration, T2W images in all three planes and transverse T2W FLAIR images. Despite mild clinical deterioration, marked improvement of the MRI appearance of the optic chiasm, presphenoid bone and meninges could be appreciated when compared to the previous study. The presphenoid bone exhibited a normal bone marrow signal, although swelling of the left optic nerve was visible (Fig. 6) when compared to previous images (Fig. 5). Post\u2010contrast images did not demonstrate sphenoid or meningeal enhancement but perineural enhancement of the left optic nerve suggestive of optic neuritis was detected. A cerebellomedullary CSF sample at this time was within normal limits. Clinical signs improved after another course of antibiotics as outlined above for 4 weeks.

Pathological changes included enlarged sphenoid bones with loss of normal bone marrow signal on T1W images (Fig. 7). Abnormal contrast enhancement was noticed in the tissues surrounding the optic chiasm and optic nerves as well as widespread meningeal enhancement extending to the brainstem (8, 9). A spindle shaped structure dorsally elevated and compressed the brainstem. It peripherally enhanced and was hyperintense compared with normal brain tissue on T2W images, suggestive of a fluid \u2018pocket\u2019 (e.g. abscess, cyst, hemorrhage) (Fig. 10). There was bilateral orbital inflammation and enhancement of muscles ventral to the skull base. Cerebellomedullary CSF analysis and culture were unremarkable and negative, respectively. Based on these findings, meningitis, cellulitis and sphenoid osteomyelitis were suspected. The cat was treated with clindamycin (Antirobe\u00ae, Pfizer) 12.5 mg/kg BID PO for 6 weeks and prednisolone (Prednidale\u00ae, Arnolds Veterinary Products, Shrewsbury, UK) 1 mg/kg BID PO for 2 weeks, reducing the dose over the following 1 week. Six days after treatment initiation the cat was much brighter and marked vision improvement was noted. The PLRs were normal bilaterally and the nystagmus had resolved. The retinal lesions also showed signs of resolution. The antibiotic treatment was continued for 6 weeks. Prognosis was considered guarded due to the possibility of toxoplasmosis. The cat was euthanized 4 years after presentation, due to hepatic failure diagnosed by the referring veterinary surgeon. No relapse of visual deficits was noted until that event.

Vision deficits and PLR loss in both eyes reflect a neurological lesion affecting the retinas, optic nerves, the optic chiasm and/or the rostral part of the optic tracts. In lesions of the optic nerves and chiasm the PLR will be preserved to some extent despite the loss of functional vision as fewer functioning optic nerve fibers are required.\n21\n An unilateral PLR deficit with a normal menace response was found in the ESS, reflecting a lesion of the ipsilateral CN III. The extension of the inflammatory process resulted subsequently in impaired function of visual pathway resulting in blindness. As in humans, classical signs of infections such as fever and an elevated WBC count were absent. A presumptive diagnosis was made predominantly based on MRI findings and CSF changes, if present. MRI abnormalities noted in our three cases include thickening and distortion of the sphenoid bone and diffuse sphenoid hypointensity relative to normal fatty bone marrow on T1W images. Varying surrounding tissue involvement was present such as meningitis and myositis of the extraocular muscles. The latter causing the exophthalmos seen in the ESS. Using paramagnetic contrast medium, a marked enhancement of the sphenoid bones, the ventral meninges and the ventral surface of the brain was present in all cases. This pathology was surrounding and involving the caudal part of the optic nerves and the optic chiasm. Cerebellomedullary CSF findings are not documented for skull base osteomyelitis diagnosis in humans, presumably as direct access to the lesion is possible for tissue sampling. In our cases, CSF results varied. Markedly increased cellularity, a moderate to marked increase of protein, marked neutrophilic inflammation and some intracellular structures highly suggestive of small bacterial rods where found in the ESS. In the GR, an elevated nucleated cell count and lymphocytic inflammation were present. These changes typically are associated with inflammatory central nervous system diseases although normal CSF results do not rule out an inflammatory process.\n22\n Elevated CSF protein may occur due to alteration of the blood\u2013brain barrier, local necrosis and/or an interruption of normal CSF flow and absorption.\n22\n CSF analysis and culture in the cat were normal and negative, respectively.",

In general, most bone infections in dogs and cats are of bacterial origin, which can be acquired secondary to exposed traumatic wounds, extension from adjacent soft\u2010tissue infections or hematogenous spread.\n1\n, \n23\n Furthermore, multifactorial developmental forms of osteomyelitis (e.g. panosteitis) have been reported in young dogs.\n24\n, \n25\n A T. gondii titer of 54 000 in the cat suggested exposure but actual infection could not be proven. Further diagnostic tests (paired serum samples, convalescent samples, IgM titers) that could provide additional diagnostic information were not performed. Toxoplasma gondii has not been reported to cause osteomyelitis and is unlikely to be the causative agent. However, the present retinal changes have been reported to occur in ocular toxoplasmosis, which improved on specific treatment.\n26\n, \n27\n\n",

The use of anti\u2010inflammatory medication may also have contributed to the clinical remission observed in these cases. The ESS was treated with carprofen, a non\u2010steroidal anti\u2010inflammatory drug. The GR received metronidazole, which is also thought to have immunomodulatory properties.\n30\n The cat responded well to a combination of clindamycin and prednisolone, which potentially could have a detrimental effect in cases of bacterial infection but was used for its anti\u2010inflammatory properties. Surgical management was not considered possible due to the anatomical location of the sphenoid bone.",
