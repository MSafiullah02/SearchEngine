In principle, an HA stem-targeting, broad specificity influenza vaccine would not require annual updates, and would induce near universal immunity against diverse influenza viruses. For example, it has been shown that vaccination with H1-based HA-stabilized stem (SS) nanoparticles, that have the variable HA head region removed, elicit broadly cross-reactive antibodies and provides protection in mice and ferrets against lethal heterosubtypic H5N1 influenza virus challenge despite the absence of detectable H5N1 neutralizing activity in vitro. Further, passive transfer of immunoglobulin from H1 HA SS nanoparticles\u2013immunized mice to naive mice resulted in full protection from lethal H5N1 challenge, indicating that HA stem\u2013specific antibodies protect against diverse group 1 influenza subtypes in animal models12. Similar vaccination strategies have been reported against group 2 influenza A subtypes as well13.",

Here, we present a new set of structurally-defined12 stabilized-stem probes (seasonal and pandemic H1, H2, H5, and H9) to determine the prevalence, frequency, breadth and specificity of broadly reactive antibodies in human sera. Analysis of 202 human sera samples revealed a wide prevalence of broadly-reactive antibodies to multiple group-1 HA subtypes.",

H1 HA NC99 and HIV gp120 proteins served as positive and negative controls, respectively. Ab binding was detected by peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-human IgG (Rockland Immunochemicals Inc., PA, USA). Dose-response curve was plotted using absorbance reading at Y-axis and antibody dilutions on X-axis. Endpoint dilutions were determined from non-linear fit dose-response curves using a detection limit of four-fold (4 X) above background absorbance (washing buffer alone)12. The HA NC 99 SS was further characterized by ELISA and pseudotype neutralization competition assays. Presence or absence of the stem epitope bound by CR6261 on each of the various engineered proteins was measured by the ability of a given protein to compete the antibody CR6261 away from either substrate protein, in an ELISA, or pseudotyped virus, in a neutralization assay. Briefly, ELISA binding competition was performed by incubating CR6261 with the competitor protein (H1 NC 99, H1 NC 99 \u0394stem, H1 NC 99 SS, H1 NC 99 SS \u0394stem or gp120) at a concentration of 10 \u03bcg/ml prior to addition to plates pre-coated with H1 NC 99 (200 ng/well) and blocked with 5% skim milk21,22.

H1N1 neutralization was independent of stem-directed antibody titers in the sera, as we saw no significant difference in ELISA endpoint titers between neutralizing and non-neutralizing samples (Fig. 4B). However, H5N1 neutralization correlated to antibody ELISA endpoint titer against the H5 INDO 05 HA SS probe (Fig. 4B).",

We also observed no difference in the profiles of cross-reactive sera from vaccinated and non-vaccinated samples collected after the H1N1 pandemic emergence (Table 1). However, there was a statistically significant boost in specific stem antibody titers to H1 CA 09 HA SS probe in subjects that received pandemic H1N1 influenza vaccine compared to those that did not receive the vaccine within the same time period (Fig. 5). We also noted a higher rate of cross-reactive antibodies in the older population, especially those born within or before the period of H2N2 pandemic33 (Table 1).

The HA SS probes allow definitive measurement of stem antibodies without the potential interference of anti-HA head antibodies, while \u0394stem probes measure and allow us to account for antibodies targeting the specific epitope encompassing the supersite for bNAbs. Furthermore, by utilizing HA SS probes for several HA subtypes (seasonal and pandemic H1, H2, H5, and H9) we were able to directly assess the breadth of sera reactivity to all four group 1 HA subtypes known to have infected humans.

As expected, reactivity to the H1 HA subtypes, both seasonal and pandemic, was commonly observed (~60%). However, 42%\u201345% of samples also reacted to the stem-epitope of the non-circulating subtypes (H2, H5, and H9). Furthermore, 30% (n = 60) of the samples harbored reactivity to at least 4 out of 5 probes. Our findings suggest a much higher prevalence of group 1 HA stem epitope directed antibodies in the general population (84%) than previously reported values of up to 30% in unvaccinated subjects14. BNAbs recognizing group 1 HA stem have been shown to arise predominantly (>60 %) from the IGHV1-69 v-gene28,29. Moreover, antibodies containing the VH1-69 v-gene have been observed to be expressed at high levels of up to 11%35. Finally, germline-reverted, VH1-69-containing, HA stem-reactive bNAbs have been shown to recognize group 1 HA stem antigens and require minimal levels of somatic hypermutation for maturation11. Therefore, the human immune system has evolved the capacity to generate stem-directed influenza antibodies in the large majority of individuals. The difference in the reported seroprevalence rate of stem-directed antibodies in this study compared to others could be referred to the difference in the used methodology and type of analysis. Firstly, we used multiple subtypes to screen for stem antibodies, which enables better detection coverage, and secondly, we specifically screened for epitope-specific response by utilizing WT and \u0394stem probes, while defining a cutoff value of end-point-binding-titer fold difference between the two probes.",

This could be due to a more extensive exposure to diverse influenza strains via infection or vaccination. This includes the exposure to H2N2 subtype that circulated between 1957 and 196833, as well as the swine H1N1 strain that emerged in the late 1970s36. Moreover, childhood imprinting by the first influenza strains encountered by a subject has been suggested to play a role in adult immune response to influenza37. The breadth of antibody binding in sera correlated with the frequency of cross-reactive memory B cells isolated from PBMCs.

Furthermore, although significant number of sera samples were broadly reactive in terms of stem binding as measured with ELISA, only a subset of these (30%) were able to neutralize a divergent non-circulating group 1 virus (H5N1). These observations suggest that subtle variations in the specificity of stem-directed antibodies or structures of HA stem surfaces between subtypes may result in varying degrees of breadth. Our resluts also indicate that these antibodies could be cross-reactive but not necessarily cross-neutralizing, partially depending on their titers in the sera. Whether such cross-reactivity translates into other effector mechanisms such as ADCC and CDC requires further investigations. Importantly, these observations suggest that HA stem-based vaccination strategy might require the use of multiple components to provide broader protection, especially when it comes to cross-group neutralization such as H3 and H7.",

On the other hand, H5N1 viruses are known to cause lower respiratory tract infections (LRTI) in humans. Interestingly, a meta-analysis of studies that evaluated the serological evidence of H5N1 infections in humans indicated a seropositivity up to 2% in high risk groups and concluded that H5N1 viruses can cause mild or subclinical infections in humans41. Our findings in animal models indicate that stem antibodies can protect against lethal H5N1 infection although they lack measurable neutralizing activity against the virus in vitro, which suggest the involvement of other mechanisms such as ADCC and CDC. This suggest that stem antibodies might provide better protection from LRTI rather than URTI. Evaluating anti-stem antibodies in passive transfer experiments in human challenge studies to define whether neutralization or Fc-mediated effector functions were required for protection would be highly informative.",

Our analyses indicates that stem-directed antibodies are prevalent in human sera across age groups, although the breadth and function of antibody\u2019s binding and neutralization can be dependent on age and presumably the exposure history. Therefore, it may be feasible to design candidate vaccines that can effectively boost pre-existing responses with cross-protective capacity. Our analysis also shows that not all stem-directed antibodies in human sera are equally broad. Therefore, universal influenza vaccine candidates will need to be designed to activate selected precursors and may require more than one component to generate the desired breadth of protection.",
