Due to limited data, mathematical models are often used to make projections. However, these models also rely on data, and are only as good as our understanding of the disease process. Careful synthesis of the available information, combined with development of planning scenarios provide a pathway to making useful forecasts in the face of significant public health threats. This manuscript reports on one such synthesis, an analysis performed in support of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia Ministry of Health in the lead up to the 2014 Hajj. Due to the different time lines of public health response and publication, this analysis is appearing after the 2014 Hajj, and we discuss what actually happened in the conclusion. The main analysis is presented as it was performed to give an unbiased assessment of how the analysis was approached.",

There are reasons to be concerned. Two to three million Saudis and foreign pilgrims will visit Makkah and Madinah, congregating in densities of up to seven per square meter during religious events.1 Most pilgrims are older males, many with underlying conditions,2 common features of severe MERS-CoV cases. There is evidence of increased transmission efficiency of respiratory infections among Hajj pilgrims.3 A significant proportion of pilgrims seek or require health care while in KSA (Figure 2), and health care associated transmission has helped to drive previous outbreaks.4 Finally, pilgrims infected while in KSA may return to their home countries while still incubating the infection, potentially seeding outbreaks.",

However, the sheer number and density of pilgrims and the potential for global dispersal of the virus to previously unaffected countries means the risks need to be rigorously reassessed and response plans formulated. Thus, the Saudi government conducted intensive surveillance for MERS-CoV at health care centers during the Hajj and has developed response plans for handling any detected cases.",

Original projections were performed independently by researchers at Imperial College and the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health and further validated by comparison with MERS-CoV incidence among foreign Umrah pilgrims visiting KSA during preceding Ramadan (which occurred July 2014 this year). The estimates presented here represent a synthesis of the work of these two groups.

The incubation period of MERS-CoV is assumed to follow a lognormal distribution with a mean of 5.6 days and dispersion of 1.63.9Based on planning scenarios provided by the KSA MoH, we assume an expected 3.2 million Hajj attendees (1.5 million Saudis and 1.7 million foreigners), that foreigners stay for an average of 14 days, and that Saudis stay for an average of 7 days. On average, 500,000 foreign visitors are assumed to attend Umrah each month, staying for an average of one week except in Ramadan where it may extend to two weeks. Background infection rates are considered to be constant throughout a pilgrim\u2019s entire stay in KSA. We account for the possibility of onward transmission during the Hajj by projecting additional generations of transmission among pilgrims.

Quantitative analysis is useful to assess the potential scale of risk associated with events such as the Hajj. At first glance, it may seem surprising that we project less than 100 individuals will develop MERS-CoV during the 2014 Hajj, even in our most pessimistic scenarios. This value is relatively low in part due to the short duration of visit of pilgrims to the Hajj (7-14 days), which limits the opportunities for secondary transmission (Figure 4). Thus we expect that most MERS-CoV cases occurring in pilgrims will arise due to exposure to cases or infected other source already prevalent in KSA. While the Spring of 2014 saw large hospital-centered outbreaks of the virus across KSA, improvements in diagnosis and compliance with infection control practice were associated with a decline in incidence to near zero by the end of July. If this trend continues, the infection risk to KSA residents and visitors over the next few months can be expected to be very low (perhaps even lower than the lowest scenario considered). Furthermore, the well-developed health care and surveillance systems put in place for Hajj and the regulations on visitor movements may result in exposure risks for pilgrims being rather lower than for the general KSA population - which may explain in part why no cases of MERS-CoV occurred during the Hajj during 2012 or 2013.",

Therefore, we made highly pessimistic assumptions to generate our highest incidence estimates of Hajj-associated MERS-CoV cases: (a) Hajj pilgrims will face the same daily risk of infection experienced by residents in the worst affected Makkah region of KSA during the highest incidence 4 week period of 2014; (b) despite the improvements in infection prevention and control implemented this year, secondary transmission will occur at the same levels seen in 2012 and 2013; (c) that age-specific attack rates in pilgrims will mirror those seen in the KSA population over the last 2 years. Thus while the resulting projections (of under 100 cases) are appropriate for planning purposes, they are not likely to be realized. Our best estimate is that around six pilgrims (95% PI, 1-17) will develop symptoms of MERS-CoV during the 2014 Hajj, based on the numbers of cases reported in foreign pilgrims visiting KSA for Umrah between June and August 2014. However, even this figure may be pessimistic, given recent reductions in MERS-CoV incidence in KSA and among visitors (including Umrah pilgrims).",

Given these uncertainties, we adopted a relatively simple, but empirically driven, approach to risk assessment in this work; relying on careful synthesis of the available data and important planning scenarios rather than sophisticated mathematical models. It is possible that some of the model assumptions in this simplified approach underestimate the risk of unexpectedly larger transmission events, as have been seen in some hospitals. To account for this possibility we performed a sensitivity analysis where we repeated the model using a highly over-dispersed distribution for onward transmission; the results of this analysis were not qualitatively different from the main analysis (see Appendix 2).",

Hence, cases must be identified rapidly and appropriate contact precautions put in place as quickly as possible. Furthermore, despite our projections of low incidence, the high density of pilgrims might offer the potential for super-spreading events. Though not seen thus far for MERS-CoV, such events can be highly challenging to contain. Careful surveillance and testing will minimize the number of MERS-CoV infected individuals attending mass gatherings, and quickly detect any surge in transmission. Virological surveillance is also critical and rapid sequencing of viral isolates will provide timely information on whether any apparent changes in the epidemiology of MERS-CoV, such as increased transmissibility, are associated with significant evolutionary changes in the virus.",

However, had an outbreak occurred and KSA not been prepared they would be subject to severe criticism and precipitated a global public health crisis, similar to what resulted from the early response to Ebola in West Africa. The type of scenario planning reported in this manuscript is essential to any public health response, and while we can always hope that our most optimistic forecasts are realized, we should never assume this is the case and work hard to develop data grounded scenarios that capture the worst reasonable outcome given what we know about the disease threats. There is no indication that the MERS-CoV threat will have subsided by the next Hajj, and there have been an increasing number of case reports through October, raising concerns as we approach the apparent high season for MERS-COV incidence in spring 2015.

The average generation time for MERS-CoV is estimated to be around 10 days, and it is highly unlikely that a case will cause any subsequent infections prior to 7 days after infection.11 Only Hajj pilgrims infected early in their stay in KSA will have the opportunity to infect additional pilgrims themselves, and those they infect are extremely unlikely to cause additional infections. Hence, it is unlikely to see more than two generations of transmission during the Hajj, an insufficient number of generations to cause a major outbreak. Most Hajj pilgrims do not mix with locals or visit locations other than the Hajj area (Makkah and Madinah), reducing their opportunities to be infected. The figure provides an example: pilgrim A is infected on the first day of his stay in KSA for the Hajj, but is unlikely to infect anyone else until 7 days later, 8 days after arriving in KSA. Pilgrim A eventually infects pilgrim B 10 days after being infected (the average generation time of MERS-CoV). Pilgrim B does not develop symptoms until returning home from the Hajj, and causes no onward transmission during his stay in KSA. Pilgrim C is only infected on day 7 of her visit, but does not cause secondary infections at the Hajj as she only develops symptoms just before leaving KSA. There is the possibility of onward transmission, and potentially large outbreaks, after pilgrims return to their home countries; however, such outbreaks lie outside the scope of this analysis. Factors that could lead to a major outbreak: While multiple generations of transmission are unlikely, some types of unexpected events could lead to significantly more cases than predicted here. Super spreading events where a single MERS-CoV infected animal or human causes a large number of cases are possible. Viral mutations that shorten the generation time or lead to more efficient transmission are unlikely, but could also cause a significant outbreak if they were to occur.",
