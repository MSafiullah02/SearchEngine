The use of chemical therapy (e.g., ribavirin) or vaccines has proved effective in protecting against viral infections, but some infections like human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) [Cohen et al., 2011], hepatitis B virus (HBV) [Dienstag, 2008], and influenza viruses [Lambert and Fauci, 2010] remain a great challenge. With progress in Genome Sequencing Project, the whole\u2010genome complete genomes of 2,837 viruses have been sequenced at the time of writing this review (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genomes/GenomesGroup.cgi?taxid=10239%26opt=Virus), leading to a new era of viral genomics and proteomics [Burley et al., 1999; Pandey and Mann, 2000; Dongre et al., 2001; Collins et al., 2003; Tyers and Mann, 2003]. Previous studies, mainly based on genomic and proteomic approaches, have made significant progress in establishing the foundation of network\u2010based investigations on viral\u2013host interactions [Chakravarti et al., 2000; Wilson and Richardson, 2005; Wu et al., 2005].",

Three types of infectomics approaches have been developed for antimicrobial drug discovery: ecological infectomics, immunoinfectomics, and chemical infectomics [Huang et al., 2007]. Among them, the accelerated development of chemical\u2010based infectomics approaches has greatly contributed to drug discovery efforts. High\u2010throughput approaches that include mass spectrometry (MS)\u2010based proteomics, activity\u2010based protein profiling (ABPP), microarray analysis, yeast two\u2010hybrid (YTH) assays, small interfering RNA (siRNA) screening, and micro RNA (miRNA) profiling, are used to study the infectomes related to viral infection, leading to detailed mechanisms of viral\u2013host interactions, including HIV [Brass et al., 2008; K\u00f6nig et al., 2008; Naji et al., 2012], hepatitis C virus (HCV) [Supekova et al., 2008; Peng et al., 2009], influenza virus [K\u00f6nig et al., 2009], and dengue virus (DENV) [Khadka et al., 2011].",

New antiviral compounds targeting host gene\u2010encoding proteins or enzymes are in preclinical research, e.g., PRO2000 [McCormack et al., 2010] and bisindolylmaleimide [Ludwig et al., 2003]. As nuclear receptors play a combinatorial role in inflammation and immunity [Glass and Ogawa, 2005], novel drugs targeting these represent a potential strategy for antiviral therapy. Targeting infectome cellular proteins or molecules may lead to reduced host drug resistance, as the human genes encoding targeted cellular proteins are less likely to mutate in response to therapy [Tan et al., 2007]. Infectomics approaches can be used to study complex viral\u2013host interactions to facilitate screening novel antiviral drug targets. In this review, we focus on high\u2010throughput infectomic approaches in the study of virus\u2013host interactions and their potential in antiviral drug discovery.",

The gene acquisition, deletion, and point mutation are three major events leading to the evolution of microbial pathogens or commensals. Point mutation is the most frequent leading to the promotion of viral replication and drug resistance. The survival ability of some viruses is enhanced due to viral point mutation, indicating that point mutations may play a critical role in virus spread. For example, in spite of the presence of antibodies against e antigen in the serum, patients infected with HBV still have a high titer of HBV DNA. Akahane et al. [1990] by sequencing the precore region of HBV, identified a point mutation at nucleotide 83 that was present in 98% clones of HBV propagated from the sera of seven patients, and another mutation at nucleotide 86 in 29 clones from two patients, which were responsible for dysfunctional secretion of e antigen. This point mutation is not limited to HBV, but is a general viral phenomenon that has been identified in a variety of viruses, including HIV [Emiliani et al., 1996], HCV [Heilek and Peterson, 1997], DENV [Hanley et al., 2003], influenza virus [Melikyan et al., 2000], and herpes simplex virus (HSV) [Hwang et al., 1992].",

Gel electrophoresis and liquid chromatography\u2010MS/MS technologies resulted in the discovery of many proteins that may represent potential drug targets and include viral enzymes like reverse transcriptase (RT), integrase, and protease, which are involved in virus binding, reverse transcription, integration, and budding. For instance, the use of HIV\u20101 protease inhibitors, like saquinavir, ritonavir, indinavir, and nelfinavir have improved the treatment of HIV\u2010infected patients [Deeks et al., 1997; Eron, 2000]. However, many patients treated with HIV\u20101 protease inhibitors developed tolerance [Condra et al., 1995; Yerly et al., 1999] requiring an enhanced knowledge of the landscape of viral infections. Furthermore, host factors that play essential roles in viral infections could also serve as novel antiviral drugs.",

Owing to the complexity of proteins and their low abundance, MS\u2010based proteomics [Rabilloud, 2002; Monteoliva and Albar, 2004; Righetti et al., 2004] is an indispensable tool in viral systems biology (Fig. 1A) [Aebersold and Mann, 2003]. Ion traps [Fenn et al., 1989; Pitteri et al., 2005; Makarov et al., 2006; Second et al., 2009; Shaner et al., 2009], time\u2010of\u2010flight (TOF) [Marklein et al., 2009; Seng et al., 2009; Prod'hom et al., 2010], quadruple [Abzalimov and Kaltashov, 2010; Ramanathan et al., 2011], and Fourier transform\u2010MS ion cyclotron analyzers [Leon et al., 2009; Allwood et al., 2012] are thee four basic types of mass analyzers used in proteomic investigation. There are multiple options available to collect data and analysis including isotope\u2010coded affinity tag [Haqqani et al., 2005], stable isotope labeling with amino acids in cell culture [Asara et al., 2008], and N15 [Osserman et al., 1957]. As more viral and host genomes are sequenced, MS\u2010based proteomics is employed in research on virus\u2013host interactions. Two\u2010dimensional electrophoresis (2DE)/MS\u2010based proteomics are powerful tools in infectomics research. Matrix\u2010assisted laser desorption/ionization\u2010TOF\u2010MS has been successfully used in combination with 2DE for infectomics analyses of the Chlamydia pneumonia elementary body in Hep\u20102 cells and C. trachomatis reticulate body in HeLa 229 cells [Huang et al., 2002]. Of the HCV nonstructural proteins, nonstructural protein 5A (NS5A) plays a critical role in RNA binding [Huang et al., 2005] and replication [Tarao et al., 2005; Targett\u2010Adams et al., 2008], but its exact role remains unknown, particularly in virus\u2013host interactions. Choi et al., 2004] identified heat shock protein 27 (HSP27) as a protein that specifically co\u2010immnoprecipitated with NS5A but not with NS5B using MS analysis and other approaches. Moreover, the N\u2010terminal regions of NS5A (aa 1\u2013181) was found to interact with the 1\u2013122 amino acid domain of HSP27. When heat shocked, HSP27 and NS5A co\u2010localize to the endoplasmic reticulum suggesting an important role during heat shock. Kou et al., 2006] examined the possibility of host factors, that inhibit translation in cultured cells, to interact with NS4A [Libbus et al., 2002; Stasko et al., 2002]. Glutathione S\u2010transferase\u2010NS4A interacting protein was found to be congruent with human translation eukaryotic elongation factor 1A (eEF1A). Furthermore, the central domain from residues 21\u201334 of NS4A interacted with eEF1A, causing inhibition of both cap\u2010dependent and HCV internal ribosomal entry site\u2010mediated translation activities.",

HIV\u20101 trans\u2010activating (Tat) protein is necessary for viral replication and may play a critical part in HIV\u20101\u2010associated diseases [Rasheed et al., 2009]. Interestingly, after HIV\u20101 infection, T cells were protected against apoptosis and survive longer bearing virions. Although the precise mechanism is unclear, it appears likely that HIV\u20101 Tat protein is responsible for such protection [Coiras et al., 2006]. Using MS\u2013based proteomics, a number of cytoskeletal proteins, e.g., \u03b2\u2010tubulin, actin, gelsolin, cofilin, annexin II, and Rac/Rho\u2010GDI (Rac and Rho\u2010guanine nucleotide dissociation inhibitor) complex, were found to be downregulated by Tat protein. Reduced expression of these proteins limited the cytoskeletal changes induced by apoptosis and thus maintained HIV\u20101 virions. MS\u2010based approaches have been used to screen potential inhibitors of Tat protein as novel therapeutic agents. Using nuclear magnetic resonance and MS/MS studies, [Jayasuriya et al., 2002 discovered durhamycin A as an inhibitor of Tat transactivation. MS\u2010based proteomics have explored other common viruses, including dengue [Pattanakitsakul et al., 2007; Higa et al., 2008], influenza [Williams et al., 2008; Schwahn et al., 2010], severe acute respiratory syndrome\u2010associated coronavirus [Zeng et al., 2004; Jiang et al., 2005], and human respiratory syncytial virus [Brasier et al., 2004; Munday et al., 2010].",

Activity\u2010directed chemical probes, which target many members of a given enzyme class or protein family, can be used to evaluate the activity of candidate compounds directly in complex proteomes. Identifying protein function and validating its biologic role is a prerequisite to lead discovery (Fig. 1B). The discovery of reversible enzyme inhibitors can be simplified with this chemical proteomic approach. In order to characterize the specific cellular functions of the cysteine proteases required for survival of the malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum, a chemical proteomic screen was used to characterize these predominant proteases. Falcipain 1 was identified as the only active protease during the invasive merozoite stage. Specific inhibitors for falcipain 1 were then identified by the screening and were able to block parasite invasion of host erythrocytes, suggesting that falcipain 1 played a specific role in host cell invasion with the inhibitor for this enzyme representing a potential new agent for antimalarial therapeutics [Greenbaum et al., 2002].",

Compared with traditional approaches, the principal advantage of microarrays is that a large number of targets can be analyzed in parallel measurements with low sample consumption (Fig. 1C). Similar to recombinant DNA [Jackson et al., 1972] and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) [Mullis and Faloona, 1987], microarray is a seminal technology with broad application [Stears et al., 2003], including genomics [DeRisi et al., 1997; Hughes et al., 2000; Sudarsanam et al., 2000] and proteomics [Geiss et al., 2000; MacBeath and Schreiber, 2000; Eickhoff et al., 2002]. The two commonly used microarrays are those for DNA and protein [Templin et al., 2002] where enzyme\u2010substrate [Bulyk et al., 1999; Arenkov et al., 2000; MacBeath and Schreiber, 2000; Zhu et al., 2000], DNA\u2010protein [Bulyk et al., 1999], protein\u2010ligand, and different types of protein\u2013protein interactions [Ge, 2000] are studied. DNA microarrays shifted direct antiviral screening programs to rational and genome\u2010wide target\u2010based strategies [Schmid, 2001; Chan et al., 2002; Fritz and Raczniak, 2002; McDevitt et al., 2002; Parkinson, 2002; Cheng et al., 2003]. Since the first report of microarray\u2010based investigations of HIV\u2010induced alterations in host gene expression [Geiss et al., 2000], microarrays have been used in HIV studies [Izmailova et al., 2003; Khodakov et al., 2008] to investigate macrophage responses of infection by African swine fever virus [Zhang et al., 2006]. Genomic comparison of tuberculosis vaccine strain variants (Bacillus Calmette\u2010Gu\u00e9rin), Mycobacterium tuberculosis H37Rv, Helicobacter pylori, and methicillin\u2010resistant Staphylococcus aureus has been conducted using DNA microarray analysis providing new information on the evolution of these human pathogens suggesting rational approaches to the design of improved diagnostics and antimicrobial agents. However, bridging the gap between genomes and therapeutics is a challenging and time\u2010consuming research process that is rate\u2010limiting [Falb and Jindal, 2002; Zanders et al., 2002]. Protein microarrays also provide a high\u2010throughput platform for target identification. A cluster of secreted proteins (\u03b1\u2010defensins 1, 2, and 3) were identified as cell anti\u2010HIV factors (CAFs) [Zhang et al., 2002] that were secreted by cluster of differentiation 8 T\u2010lymphocytes from certain immunologically stable HIV\u20101 patients to suppress HIV\u20101 replication. The specific antibody recognition and amino acid sequencing were used to confirm the identity of CAF. Protein microarrays using malaria parasite surface proteins have been developed for studies of parasitic diseases [Bacarese\u2010Hamilton et al., 2002]. The receptor\u2010binding characteristics of two isolates of the novel pandemic H1N1 virus, Cal/09, and A/Hamburg/5/2009 (Ham/09), which were compared directly by carbohydrate microarray analysis [Childs et al., 2009].",

In YTH, a protein of interest is fused to a DNA\u2010binding domain and transfected in a yeast host cell with the reporter gene controlled by this DNA\u2010binding domain. This fusion protein can be used as a \u201cbait\u201d or \u201ctarget\u201d to screen a library of cDNA clones fused to an activation domain. The functional transcription factor will reconstitute upon the physical interaction between bait and prey proteins, activating a reporter gene (Fig. 1D). YTH has been widely used in studying virus\u2013host protein\u2013protein interactions, including Escherichia coli bacteriophage 7 [Bartel et al., 1996], HIV [Rossi et al., 1996], and HCV [Matsumoto et al., 1997; Mamiya and Worman, 1999; Kittlesen et al., 2000]. Khadka et al. [2011] used a YTH assay to study network interactions between DENV and human proteins and validated a subset of these interactions through split\u2010luciferase, siRNA, and colocalization experiments, resulting in the first genome\u2010wide analysis of DENV\u2013human protein\u2013protein interactions. They identified 93 proteins required for DENV replication, 60 of which that were not been linked to any other viruses, and showed that some of proteins involved in DENV infection also linked to other viruses, particularly HCV [Khadka et al., 2011]. This study has provided new light on DENV\u2013host interactions as well as new potential drugs targeting host proteins. Mouse hepatitis virus (MHV)\u201068, a useful model for the study of human \u03b3\u2010herpes viruses, has been studied using YTH with 23 intraviral protein interactions and 243 virus\u2010cellular protein interactions being identified, most of which have never been reported before [Lee et al., 2011]. Such studies may reveal potential cellular proteins that are utilized by MHV\u201068 or DENV, which may serve as new targets for therapeutic intervention. Studies on stomatitis virus [Moerdyk\u2010Schauwecker et al., 2011], Sesbania mosaic virus [Chowdhury and Savithri, 2011], flavivirus [Le Breton et al., 2011], influenza virus [Sharma et al., 2011; Tafforeau et al., 2011], human cytomegalovirus [To et al., 2011], and human T\u2010lymphotropic virus (HTLV) types 1 and 2 retroviruses [Simonis et al., 2012] also provided novel insights into virus\u2013host interactions.",

Another study identified 295 cellular cofactors required for early\u2010stage influenza virus replication with 23 factors necessary for viral entry confirmed [K\u00f6nig et al., 2010]. Some 250 host cellular factors influencing HIV\u20101 infection have been identified 40 factors participating in the early stage of HIV infection [Brass et al., 2008; K\u00f6nig et al., 2008]. High\u2010throughput RNAi screening has identified host factors involved in virus progression, including those for HCV [Li et al., 2009; Tai et al., 2009], West Nile virus [Krishnan et al., 2008], DENV [Sessions et al., 2009], and drosophila C virus [Cherry et al., 2005].",

High\u2010throughput miRNA profiling technologies, including quantitative reverse transcription PCR\u2010based methods, hybridization\u2010based methods, RNA\u2010seq, and pri\u2010 and pre\u2010miRNA quantification [Pritchard et al., 2012] have greatly enhanced knowledge regarding the role of miRNA in viral\u2013host interactions (Fig. 1F). miRNA profiling technologies combined with messenger RNA (mRNA) profiling have provided new insight into HCV\u2013host interactions. Investigation of miRNAs and mRNAs involved in HCV infection identified 43 differentially expressed miRNAs and 6,850 differentially expressed mRNAs expression levels of which were changed during HCV infection [Liu et al., 2010; Steuerwald et al., 2010]. These altered expression levels of miRNAs and mRNAs were involved in metabolism, cell growth, apoptosis, and cytokine/chemokine pathways, and in the progression of HCV\u2010induced chronic hepatitis. Another study revealed 10 miRNAs that were downregulated in Hep\u2010394 cells with 23 miRNAs upregulated [Braconi et al., 2010]. The identified miRNAs and their putative targets may be used as the basis for anti\u2010HCV therapies, suggesting that combined miRNA and mRNA profiling may represent a novel approach to understand HCV infection and design new anti\u2010HCV strategies.",

However, antisense inhibitors targeting cellular miRNAs have been predicted to have side effects, as these inhibitors could also disrupt cellular functions of these miRNAs. Moreover, like treatment with other antiviral drugs, the virus may become resistant, e.g., through mutation of the viral miRNAs or viral binding sites for cellular miRNAs [Gottwein and Cullen, 2008]. In this case, miRNA\u2010based therapeutics would be needed to be used in combination with other antiviral drugs.",

            "text": "Using high\u2010throughput technologies (Table 1), new insights into virus\u2013host interactions have occurred that suggest that host cellular signaling pathways may be hijacked or promoted by virus infection, making viral\u2013host interactions more complex than previously thought. Receptors on the cell membrane, adaptor molecules in the cytoplasm, and nuclear transcription factors [Dai et al., 2011] represent three categories of host signaling molecules that play important roles in virus\u2013host interactions [DeLarco and Todaro, 1976; Albritton et al., 1989; Doria et al., 1995; Choe et al., 1996; Yoneyama et al., 1998; Waris et al., 2001; Hemmi et al., 2004; Perry et al., 2004] (Fig 2). The phosphoinositide 3\u2010kinases, a family of lipid kinases, are involved in intracellular signaling cascades that play essential roles in apoptosis, autophagy, and tumorigenesis [Wong et al., 2010; Bartholomeusz and Gonzalez\u2010Angulo, 2012]. Influenza virus can interrupt this pathway to create a suitable environment for replication. Over the past few decades, nearly all classical signaling pathways were reported to participate in viral infections. Transforming growth factor\u2010\u03b2 (TGF\u2010\u03b2) signaling initiates its cascades by binding to specific cell surface receptors that have intrinsic serine/threonine kinase activity [ten Dijke and Hill, 2004] and can modulate HCV infection [Lee et al., 2002; Rowan et al., 2008]. For virus\u2010induced tumorigenesis, hepatitis B virus X protein and liver cancer\u2010derived hepatitis C virus core proteins play essential roles in shifting TGF\u2010\u03b2 signaling from tumor suppression to tumorigenesis and epithelial\u2010mesenchymal transition [Battaglia et al., 2009; Murata et al., 2009]. The nuclear factor kappa B (NF\u2010\u03baB), a family of transcription factors, plays a key role orchestrating innate and acquired host immune responses to pathogen infection [Rahman and McFadden, 2011]. Bovine foamy virus can activate the NF\u2010\u03baB pathway via action of its transactivator and enhanced viral transcription [Wang et al., 2010]. Other viral proteins involved in NF\u2010\u03baB activation include Tax of HTLV\u20101. Viral proteins can inhibit the NF\u2010\u03baB pathway and include Epstein\u2010Barr nuclear antigen 1 and open reading frame 2 of Torque teno virus. Kaposi's sarcoma\u2010associated herpes virus (KSHV) encodes a miRNA that controls viral replication by activating the NF\u2010\u03baB pathway demonstrating an important role of KSHV miRNAs in regulating viral latency and lytic replication via manipulation of the host survival pathway [Lei et al., 2010]. This suggests that not only the viral proteins but also miRNAs could participate in the regulation of host signaling pathways.",

            "text": "Virus\u2013host interactions have indicated that cellular processes play important roles in viral infection. Autophagy, which can be divided into three categories: microautophagy, chaperone\u2010mediated autophagy, and macroautophagy [Cecconi and Levine, 2008], have been linked to both innate and adaptive immunity versus viral infection [Lee and Iwasaki, 2008; Orvedahl and Levine, 2009]. Autophagy can be both activated [Ait\u2010Goughoulte et al., 2008; Alavian et al., 2011] or inhibited [Zhou and Spector, 2008; Gannag\u00e9 et al., 2009] by viral infection. In turn, autophagy can also promote [Lee et al., 2008] or inhibit [Orvedahl et al., 2010] viral infection. Therefore, unraveling the role of autophagy during viral infection is important for targeting autophagy and may provide new strategies for antiviral therapies. Apoptosis and glucose metabolism are also involved in viral infection. Noch et al., 2012] demonstrate the role of JC virus (John Cunningham virus) T\u2010antigen in regulating glucose metabolism in brain tumor cells. T\u2010antigen was downregulated by 2\u2010deoxy\u2010D\u2010glucose, 6\u2010aminonicotinamide, and oxythiamine. T\u2010antigen can also modulate expression of the glycolytic enzyme, hexokinase 2, and the pentose phosphate enzyme, transaldolase 1 Epstein\u2010Barr virus can inhibit induction of a pro\u2010apoptotic B\u2010cell lymphoma 2 homology 3\u2010only containing protein (NOXA) by ionomycin inhibiting apoptosis in B cells [Yee et al., 2011]. In addition, HCV NS4B protein, a component of a membrane\u2010associated cytoplasmic HCV replication complex [Hugle et al., 2001], has been reported as an inducer of apoptosis via a mitochondrila pathway [Zhao et al., 2012]. These findings suggested that cellular processes of the host cells could be altered during viral infection, which could contribute to the development of new strategies to target these processes for combating viral infections (Fig. 2).",

Six infectomics technologies commonly used for drug discovery have been described in this review: MS\u2010based proteomics, ABPP, microarray analysis, YTH assays, siRNA screening, and miRNA profiling. Together, they have the potential to elucidate and integrate the dynamic interactions between microbial pathogens and their hosts during the development of infectious diseases. Chemical infectomics, which has the advantages of both high\u2010throughput chemistry and infectomics, is an emerging method for validating drug targets and will revolutionize approaches to infectious diseases. The infectomics view provides: (i) a global detection and integrative dissection of microbial and host infectomes, that is critical to understanding the process of microbial pathogenesis and developing better diagnostic or therapeutic approaches for infectious diseases; (ii) a powerful tool to investigate microbial and human genomes to address the present crisis in antibiotic resistance; (iii) a new method of utilizing pharmacomes (lipid\u2010based drug delivery systems) for optimal drug therapy; and (iv) the opportunity to exploit probiotics as ecological approaches to infectious diseases. With such tools, prevention and treatment of microbial infections will eventually enter an era when holistic solutions to health problems can be efficiently individualized.",
