            "text": "Plants synthesize a large range of natural products also known as secondary metabolites; some of them are incredibly important for the survival of mankind. Some secondary metabolites, such as essential oils and saponins, were produced by plants during long-term coevolution as a mechanism of defense response against pathogens (Du Fall and Solomon 2011; War et al. 2012). The productions of enormous varieties of secondary metabolites in plants have a direct impact on plant fitness. These secondary metabolites are being used for various purposes, such as food ingredients, medical drugs, and starting materials for chemical industry, etc. (Zhao et al. 2013). Consequently, pathogens and constituents of microbial cells, mainly the polysaccharide fractions or carbohydrates, can be used to stimulate the production of secondary metabolites in plant cell and tissue cultures (Zhao et al. 2005). Due to tremendous medicinal properties, the demand for medicinal plants is constantly increasing due to which some of them are under threatened category also (Muthukumar et al. 2004).",

A. rhizogenes (ATCC15834)-mediated transformation in Prunella vulgaris produced 15\u201330 times more rosmarinic acid (RA) in comparison to intact plants. Further enhancement in RA content was achieved through elicitation by ethephon and SA (Ru et al. 2016). Hairy root cultures of Valeriana officinalis were treated with two to six times higher concentration of magnesium and calcium than in normal Murashige and Skoog\u2019s (MS) medium from 3 to 7 days. The uppermost amount of valerenic acid in hairy root culture was 7.9 times higher than the control (Torkamani et al. 2014). Vazquez-Flota et al.

Many factors such as the concentration of medium, addition of biotic elicitors, and hydrolytic enzymes were used as strategies for enhancing the yield of alkaloids. Noteworthy results were obtained when sucrose concentration was enhanced from 3 to 4.5%. Treatment of Aspergillus and macerozyme increased the accumulation of ajmalicine although the addition of methyl jasmonate (MJ) was proved beneficial for increasing the yield of both ajmalicine and catharanthine (Vazquez-Flota et al. 1994).",

The leaves of the plants are elliptic to lanceolate or obovate in shape in whorls of three; roots are tuberous with pale brown cork (Deshmukh et al. 2012). This plant is commonly known as \u201cSarpagandha,\u201d \u201cChandrabhaga,\u201d snakeroot plant, Chotachand, Chandrika, Harkaya, etc. (Mallick et al. 2012). It is a tropical plant belonging to family Apocynaceae. The roots and leaves of R. serpentina are of medicinal importance and catch the attention in the field of medicine because of the presence of secondary metabolites (Poonam and Mishra 2013). In India, it has been used as a part of the Ayurvedic system for curing various ailments (Pant and Joshi 2008). The roots of R. serpentina are used as a medication for treating insomnia, hypertension, mental agitation, gastrointestinal disorders, epilepsy, excitement, traumas, anxiety, excitement, sedative insomnia, schizophrenia, and insanity (Meena et al. 2009; Poonam and Mishra 2013). According to Rajendran and Agarwal (2007), fruits and seeds of this plant are used by ethnic tribes of Virudhunagar district of Tamil Nadu, India, for its medicinal or ethnobotanical properties. R. serpentina plant has been considered under endangered category by the International Union for the Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources (IUCN) (Shetty et al. 2014). This plant contains abundant medicinal properties and strongly suffered from habitat distortion (Mehrotra et al. 2015).",

(1993) also reported hairy roots induction with the use of A. rhizogenes strain ATCC 15834 from the leaf explants of R. serpentina (Goel et al. 2010; Liu et al. 2012; Sudha et al. 2003). Different A. rhizogenes strains, i.e., SV4, LBA9402, and SV2, were evaluated for their transformation ability. Among them SV2 strain was found more competent for the induction of hairy roots in leaf explants of R. serpentina (Sarma et al. 1997). ATCC 15834 strain of Agrobacterium was also exploited for their transformation ability regarding induction of hairy roots in R. micrantha (Sudha et al. 2003). Madhusudanan et al. (2008) reported induction of hairy roots in leaf explants of R. serpentina using A4 strain. A novel compound, 3-epi-a-yohimbine, was reported from these hairy roots. Plantlet formation from high reserpine yielding hairy root lines of R. serpentina has also been reported (Mehrotra et al. 2013). The effect of biotic and abiotic elicitors on the production of important metabolites in hairy root cultures of R. serpentina was analyzed. Ajmalicine production could be stimulated up to 14.8-fold at 100 mM concentration of NaCl after 1 week of treatment. However, ajmaline concentration could only be increased up to 2.9-fold at 100 mg L\u22121 dose of mannan after 1 week of treatment (Srivastava et al. 2016).",

To conquer this difficulty, the combination of transgenic approach and elicitation techniques was used to increase the flavonoid production. cDNA encoding chalcone isomerase (chi) gene was overexpressed in hairy roots of G. uralensis Fisch. Subsequently, transgenic and wild cultures were elicited with PEG 8000 (2%) and yeast extract (YE) (0.1%), and the combination of these two elicitors is also used. Total flavonoids were extracted and measured. The obtained results demonstrated that the highest flavonoid was obtained in double-treated transgenic hairy roots (2.838 g 100 g\u22121 DW). The amount of flavonoid in wild-type hairy roots and the untreated transgenic hairy roots was 0.842 and 1.394 (g 100 g\u22121 DW), respectively. The enhanced accumulation of flavonoids was also correlated with the elevated level of chi transcripts and CHI activity; it confirmed the key role of chi in the flavonoid biosynthesis. This research verified that the combination of PEG8000-YE elicitation with metabolic engineering was an effective strategy to enhance the flavonoid production in hairy roots of G. uralensis Fisch (Zhang et al. 2009).",

The addition of Si markedly affected the G. uralensis growth in a combination of NaCl and PEG treatment. The addition of Si improved germination index, germination rate, seedling vitality index, and biomass under control and NaCl treatment. Si also increased radicle length under control, NaCl, and combination of NaCl and PEG treatment (NaCl-10% PEG), while under NaCl-20% PEG combination, it decreased some parameters such as radicle length, seedling vitality index, and germination parameters.

The chemotypes were revealed by LC/UV- or LC/MS/MS-based quantitative analysis of 151 bioactive secondary metabolites, including 17 flavonoid glycosides, 24 saponins, and 110 free phenolic compounds. For the 76 homozygous samples, the three Glycyrrhiza species showed significant biosynthetic preferences, especially in coumarins, chalcones, isoflavones, and flavonols. In total, 27 species-specific chemical markers were discovered. The 19 hybrid samples indicated that hybridization could remarkably alter the chemical composition and that the male parent contributed more to the offspring than the female parent did. This is hitherto the largest-scale targeted secondary metabolomics study of medicinal plants and the first report on uniparental inheritance in plant secondary metabolism. The results are valuable for biosynthesis, inheritance, and quality control studies of licorice and other medicinal plants (Song et al. 2017).",
