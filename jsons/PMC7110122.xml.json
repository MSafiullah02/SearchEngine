Samples were analyzed on arrival in the laboratory, by antigen-detection and real-time RT-PCR assays designed to identify influenza viruses, as well as by conventional virus culture to detect additional respiratory-viral pathogens. FLUAV (n=58) and FLUBV (n=10) accounted for the majority of the identified pathogens; in addition, HADV (n=2), HPIV-1 (n=1), and herpes simplex viruses (n=2) were isolated. In 1 of the samples, coinfection with FLUAV and FLUBV was present. In summary, the analyses identified 73 pathogens in 72 samples, providing a presumptive diagnosis in 48% of cases. However, no pathogen was identified in 79 samples. Because some samples were collected >10 days after the onset of symptoms, low microbial load at the time of collection could have accounted for some of the negative results. However, many of these pathogen-negative samples were clustered within the 8-week period between October and December 2004 and were compatible with the presence of an unidentified pathogen. We therefore retrospectively investigated all available stored specimens, using multiplex MassTag PCR",

When samples that were found to be positive when tested by this primer pair were tested by a specific diagnostic real-time RT-PCR assay for HEV, 17 of the 18 cases yielded a negative result. Reasoning that the products represented novel isolates of either HEV or HRV, we cloned all MassTag PCR\u2013amplification products. Sequence analysis identified 2 HEVs and 16 HRVs (table 1); the 16 HRV sequences were most closely related to a mixed population of HEV and HRV 5\u2032-UTRs that, in the GenBank database, are listed as \u201cAntwerp rhinovirus\u201d [12]. However, because short 5\u2032-UTR sequences are not suitable for assignment of phylogenetic relationships, we obtained additional sequences, using degenerate primer sets targeting the VP4 gene region [2]. Phylogenetic analysis of these VP4 sequences indicated that HRV group A was present in 2 cases and that HRV group B was present in 3 cases (table 1); in 3 instances, the sample was exhausted before an amplification product was obtained. For the 8 remaining HRV cases, the sequences clustered in a clade at the root of HRV group A, distinct from the described group A or group B serotypes [13] (figure 1). In 1 case (specimen 074), additional analysis, using a highly degenerate primer set [11], allowed amplification of a partial VP1 sequence; the analysis supported the phylogenetic position indicated by analysis of VP4 (data not shown)",

The advent of sensitive, affordable methods for differential diagnosis of the infectious pathogens that can cause ILI has the potential to reduce the economic burden afforded by these pathogens and to improve clinical outcomes by facilitating early selection of appropriate antimicrobials. The importance of developing strategies for triage of patients with acute respiratory infection to specific treatment regimens is underscored in the context of pandemic-influenza preparedness and the limited supply of influenza antiviral drugs",

In addition to the pathogens identified by these methods, MassTag PCR detected HRV, HEV, S. pneumoniae, M. pneumoniae, H. influenzae HMPV, human coronavirus OC43, human respiratory syncytial virus A, HPIV-1, and N. meningitidis infections.

Thus, although the sensitivity is similar to that obtained with real-time PCR (10\u201350 molecules) when primers and targets are precisely complementary, we accept primers that are optimized to perform at a detection threshold of 500\u20131000 RNA molecules in highly multiplexed assay panels. The advantage of such primer panels is underscored by the observation that they identified pathogens in previously negative samples and detected novel rhinovirus sequences that did not contribute to original primer design. Although the setup costs for MassTag PCR instrumentation are currently higher than those for real-time PCR (\u223c$80,000\u2013$120,000 vs. \u223c$30,000\u2013$100,000), MassTag PCR compares favorably with other systems. Virus culture for differential diagnosis of ILI takes up to 2 weeks and incurs materials and reagent costs of \u223c$50. Alternative, rapid antigen-detection tests can be performed within 15\u201330 min, with reagent costs of $25, but have only 50%\u201390% of the sensitivity of virus culture. Real-time PCR assays are generally more sensitive than virus culture, can be performed in 4\u20136 h, and entail reagent costs of $30 per target; in contrast, MassTag PCR requires 6\u20138 h, costs $12 per sample, and allows investigation of 20 candidate viral and bacterial pathogens in a single reaction",
