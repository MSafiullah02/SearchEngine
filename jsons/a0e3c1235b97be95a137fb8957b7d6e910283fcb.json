According to the research on SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, human coronavirus can replicate to a high titer at early stage. This high replication may lead to enhanced cytopathic effects and higher levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines produced by infected epithelial cells. These cytokines, in turn, induce large numbers of inflammatory cells penetrating into the lung [7] [8] [9] [10] . Disrupting the antiviral response by antagonizing IFN can achieve innate immune delay or immune evasion [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] . Excessive release of inflammatory cytokines and the formation of a series of self-amplifying cytokines activate a cascade of reactions, causing damage to diffuse alveolar, transparent membranes formation and fibrotic protein exudation. In severe cases, cytokine storm can induce hemodynamic instability, DIC, and multiple organ dysfunction. Increased levels of IL-6, IL-10, TNF-\u03b1 and other inflammatory cytokines in COVID-19 patients are related to poor prognosis [15] . This is consistent with the phenomenon that two cases suffered from multiple organ dysfunction, with serum cytokines significantly increased.",
