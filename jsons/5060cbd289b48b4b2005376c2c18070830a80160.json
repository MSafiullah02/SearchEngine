            "text": "The collagen vascular diseases, also referred to as connective tissue diseases, are a diverse group of systemic inflammatory disorders thought to be immunologically mediated. The concept of collagen vascular disease began to take shape in the 1930s, when it was recognized that rheumatic fever and rheumatoid arthritis can affect connective tissues throughout the body.l,2 During the following decade, as conditions such as systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and scleroderma came to be viewed as systemic diseases of connective tissue, the terms diffuse connective disease and diffuse collagen disease were proposed. 3 ,4 During the same period, the designation of diffuse vascular disease was proposed for diseases such as scleroderma, polymyositis, SLE, and polyarteritis nodosa, which featured widespread vascular involvement. 5 With the realization that many of these entities can exhibit both systemic connective tissue manifestations and vascular abnormalities, the unifying designation of collagen vascular disease was introduced. 6 Pleuropulmonary manifestations are a significant source of morbidity and mortality for patients with collagen vascular disease. An estimated 1600 deaths result from pulmonary manifestations of collagen vascular disease each year in the United States, which accounts for nearly one quarter of all deaths related to interstitial lung disease. 7 The incidence of collagen vascular diseaserelated interstitial lung disease appears to be increasing, likely the result of improved recognition and enhancements in diagnostic imaging. 8 This chapter discusses pulmonary manifestations of collagen vascular diseases, pulmonary involvement by inflammatory bowel disease, primary biliary cirrhosis, and disorders of connective tissue that are not categorized as collagen vascular diseases. 722 General Histopathologic Patterns and Approach to Diagnosis While a few pulmonary lesions, such as rheumatoid nodules, are essentially pathognomonic of collagen vascular disease, the collagen vascular diseases are best considered a group of disorders with protean pulmonary manifestations. Virtually any component of the lungs, from the large airways to the interstitium, can be affected by collagen vascular disease (Table 20 .1). Pulmonary involvement by collagen vascular disease can simulate a variety of primary diseases of the lung, in particular, the idiopathic interstitial pneumonias (see Chapter 19 for a complete description of the idiopathic interstitial pneumonias). The successful recognition of collagen vascular disease-related interstitial lung disease, therefore, requires the careful integration of clinical and radiographic data. Obtaining this information can often prove challenging. While a patient may have an established diagnosis of collagen vascular disease, such information is sometimes not communicated to the pathologist. In other cases, the patient may have rheumatologic symptoms or signs, but has not been fully evaluated for collagen vascular disease prior to lung biopsy. Pulmonary disease can precede other manifestations of collagen vascular disease by months or even years, adding to the diagnostic challenge. 9 -11 It has been known for some time that collagen vascular diseases can mimic the histologic pattern of interstitial lung disease that is seen in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF).12 For this reason, it is essential to exclude collagen vascular disease in patients who exhibit a pattern consistent with usual interstitial pneumonia (UIP) on lung biopsy with a thorough rheumatologic evaluation and serologic studies such as antinuclear antibody (ANA) and rheumatoid factor. It is particularly important for the pathologist to suggest the possibility of collagen vascular disease-related interstitial lung disease in cases with a UIP pattern in which the clinical features are not entirely typical of IPF. Such cases include patients younger than 50 years of age, never smokers, females, and those with atypical radiographic findings. Collagen vascular diseaserelated interstitial lung disease with a UIP-like pattern progresses more slowly and exhibits a more favorable prognosis than does idiopathic UIp' 13 -17 The reason for the differences in behavior between these entities is unclear, but it has been noted that the collagen vascular disease-related UIP-like pattern shows fewer fibroblastic foci than idiopathic UIp ' 16 Prior to the recognition of nonspecific interstitial pneumonia (NSIP) (see Chapter 19) , the UIP pattern was the most frequently observed pathologic pattern of collagen vascular disease-related interstitial pneumonia. [18] [19] [20] [21] However, since its introduction, NSIP has come to be recognized as the most common histologic pattern of interstitial lung disease in collagen vascular disease, accounting for 40% to 60% of cases of collagen vascular disease-related chronic interstitial lung disease in recent series. 22 -24 This is in contrast to the idiopathic interstitial pneumonias, in which the most common histologic pattern, UIP, comprises three quarters of all cases. 24 Although data are limited, the prognosis of NSIP in the setting of collagen vascular disease appears to be similar to that for idiopathic NSIp' 15 . 22 ,25-28 As with idiopathic fibrotic NSIP, the fibrotic pattern of NSIP in the setting of collagen vascular disease is associated with poorer survival than the cellular pattern of NSIp ' 22 . 28 It is not uncommon for several histologic patterns, each mimicking one of the categories of idiopathic interstitial pneumonia, to coexist. Alternatively, a mixture of overlapping patterns with histologic features that resemble several of the idiopathic interstitial pneumonias can occur.",

Productive cough, hemoptysis, and dyspnea are the most common respiratory symptoms. Radiographic abnormalities in RA-associated bronchiectasis include bibasilar, diffusely increased, interstitial markings and focal infiltrates. Recurrent pulmonary infections and respiratory failure are frequent and may be fatal (see Chapter 5) . 60 Bronchocentric granulomatosis has been reported in a few patients with RA. 61 ,62 The differential diagnosis in such cases includes mycobacterial and fungal infections as well as bronchocentric rheumatoid nodules. 64 Obliteration of the airway lumen and epithelium is an important histologic feature of bronchocentric granulomatosis. This feature is helpful in distinguishing bronchocentric granulomatosis from other conditions that present with peribronchial granulomas.",

Nine to 90% of patients, most commonly those with secondary SS, exhibit pulmonary manifestations. 42.304.305.107-31 7 Pulmonary manifestations in SS typically develop late in the course of disease and only rarely are the presenting feature. 30R Lesions affecting the small airways, such as follicular bronchiolitis, are among the most common histologic findings in patients with SS who have pulmonary involvement (Fig. 20.17) . 22,42.304 Large airway abnormalities include obstruction and desiccation of the tracheobronchial tree.30R JII.m The latter condition, which is referred to as xerotrachea, is characterized by lymphocytic inflammation and atrophy of the submucosal glands ( Fig. 20.18 In series published prior to the recognition of NSIP, lymphocytic interstitial pneumonia (LIP) was the most common interstitial lung disease in SS (Fig. 20.19 ). 304 However, in several more recent series, NSIP has been the predominant pattern (Fig. 20.20 ).23 Uncommonly encountered patterns of interstitial lung disease in SS include UIP and bronchiolitis obliterans-organizing pneumonia (BOOP). 1 2.42.299.304.3118.312.314.322-324 Radiographically, interstitial disease in SS typically gives rise to a reticulonodular pattern. 325 Follicular bronchiolitis and LIP are but part of a spectrum of lymphoid lesions that may develop in SS, which also includes nodular lymphoid hyperplasia, lymphocytic alveoli tis, lymphomatoid granulomatosis, and malignant lymphoma. 12 343 Through the use of modern clonality detection methods such as reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), many cases previously designated as pseudolymphomas have been reclassified as malignant lymphomas (see Chapter 32) . 344 On high-resolution computed tomography, pulmonary lymphoma in patients with SS may take the form of consolidation, solitary or multiple nodules, or be distributed along the pulmonary interstitium. 328 High-grade pulmonary lymphomas, such as diffuse large cell lymphoma, arising in the setting of SS are generally associated with a poor prognosis. In one series of patients with SS and lymphoma, four of 10 died within 4 years of receiving a malignant diagnosis.328 Angioinvasion is a relatively frequent finding in pulmonary lymphomas associated with SS. However, this finding does not itself appear to directly impact the prognosis. 328 An array of other pulmonary abnormalities has been reported in SS. Parenchymal nonnecrotizing granulomas may simulate hypersensitivity pneumonia, particularly in cases accompanied by peribronchiolar lymphocytic inflammation (Fig. 20.21 ).305 Rare cases of coexisting SS and sarcoidosis have been described, as have cases of coexisting SS and primary biliary cirrhosis, a condition that occasionally features pulmonary granulomas.334.345-347 Perinuclear antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (p-ANCA) positivity has been demonstrated in a few patients with SS, most often in the setting of glomerulonephritis. [348] [349] [350] Multiple bullae have been reported in some SS patients and are thought to be related to peribronchiolar lymphocytic inflammation and scarring. 35 1.352 Thin-walled cysts accompanied by ground-glass opacities may be evident radiographically in SS patients with LIP. 353 .354 Histologically, such cysts correspond to dilated bronchioles with marked peri bronchiolar lymphocytic inflammation. Pulmonary amyloidosis has also been reported in SS patients in association with LIP, MALT lymphoma, and bullous disease. 22 20.20 . Nonspecific interstitial pneumonia (NSIP) pattern in Sjogren's syndrome. In this example of fibrotic NSIP from a patient with Sjogren's syndrome, the interstitium is diffusely and homogeneously expanded by mature fibrosis. and as part of a systemic vasculitis, has also been reported. 315 .318 Pleural manifestations of SS include pleuritis and pleural effusions. 307.363 Management of SS is largely influenced by the presence of other coexisting collagen vascular diseases. Morbidity has been dramatically decreased by aggressive antimicrobial treatment of associated pulmonary infec-A K.J. Butnor and A. Khoor tions.312 Small-airway disease in SS is usually steroidresponsive, while in patients with LIP, corticosteroids and other immunosuppressive agents have been used with variable success. 314 . 364 Ankylosing Spondylitis Ankylosing spondylitis (AS), also known as Marie-Striimpell disease, is a seronegative spondyloarthropathy that predominantly involves the axial skeleton. In contrast to other collagen vascular disorders, AS has a distinct male predominance, with a male-to-female ratio as high as 10:1. 299 Ankylosing spondylitis is strongly associated with the HLA-B27 histocompatibility antigen. While only 2% to 20% of HLA-B27-positive individuals develop AS, over 90% of patients with AS are positive for HLA_B27.36s-369",

[398] [399] [400] [401] [402] [403] Prior to the introduction of the term relapsing polychondritis in 1960, cases with features similar to RP were described under the designations \"polychondropathia\" and \"chondromalacia.,,401,404-407 Affected sites include the external ear, nose, ribs, larynx, trachea, and major bronchi. 401 .406,408,409 Sites rich in glycosaminoglycans, such as the aorta, cornea, and sclera, may also be involved. 41 0--412 Some series have shown a slight female predominance, while in others males and females are equally affected. 344 ,403 Although RP can occur at any age, the peak reported incidence is in the fifth to seventh decades. 403 While the exact pathogenesis of RP is unknown, an autoimmune origin has been postulated. Antibodies to type II collagen are demonstrable in some patients. 413 Granular deposits of immunoglobulin and the C3 component of complement at the chondrofibrous junction have also been reported, as have antibodies to type II pneumocytes and Clara cells.414.41 5 Other coexisting collagen vascular diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis, SLE, or SS, are found in up to 25% of cases. 401 Involvement of the large airways causes tracheobronchomalacia, which can lead to expiratory obstruction (Fig. 20.23 ). 416 Airway narrowing can sometimes be so severe as to be life threatening. 417 The pathologic findings in RP vary depending on the phase and extent of disease. In the acute phase, RP is characterized histologically by cartilage erosion, which is accompanied by a dense pericartilaginous inflammatory infiltrate comprised of neutrophils, lymphocytes, plasma cells, and, in some cases, giant cells (Fig. 20.24 ). Over time, active inflammation gives way to dissolution of the proteoglycan matrix and destruction of cartilage, which is followed in most cases by the formation of granulation tissue. In the resolving phase, damaged cartilage often appears metachromatic. 419 Areas of complete destruction undergo fibrosis, which may be so exuberant as to result in stricture formation. 421 In addition to airway involvement, rare instances of parenchymal disease, manifesting radiographically as honeycombing, have been reported. 41S , 422 Although laryngotracheal involvement is present in only about half of cases, it is associated with a poor progno-siS. 4111 ,402 Management of such patients is aimed at maintaining patency of collapse-prone airways through ventilatory support or tracheostomy with stent placement. Corticosteroids and immunosuppressive agents are typically employed in the treatment of Rp ' 299 ,370,401,403,423-427 However, the spontaneous remitting and relapsing nature of RP makes it difficult to quantify the therapeutic effect of these agents. Pleuropulmonary manifestations have been reported in 1 % to 8% of patients. 436 ,437 The predominant thoracic manifestations of Beh<;et's syndrome are either directly related to or represent complications of necrotizing vasculitis (see Chapter 29) . Other pleuropulmonary disorders associated with Beh<;et's syndrome include aneurysms, pulmonary thromboemboli, large airway stenosis and ulceration, pleuritis, pleural effusions, chyloptysis, and organizing pneumonia. 42 .430,432,438-448 Acute interstitial pneumonia (AlP) has also been reported, typically in the setting of underlying pulmonary hemorrhage. 439 Hughes-Stovin syndrome, which is characterized by pulmonary artery aneurysms and hemoptysis, most likely represents a limited from of Beh<;et's. 443, 449 Lung involvement in Beh<;et's syndrome is often associated with a poor outcome. One third of Beh<;et's patients with lung involvement die as a result of pulmonary complications, most commonly from intractable pulmonary hemorrhage. 429",

Both familial and acquired forms have been recognized. 456 The skin of patients with cutis laxa is devoid of elastic recoil, which manifests histopathologically as a decrease in the overall number of elastic fibers, as well as degenerative elastic fiber changes. 457 Reported pulmonary complications of cutis laxa include emphysema and pulmonary artery stenosis. 45 8-461 Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome Ehlers-Danlos syndrome is a heterogeneous group of inherited disorders of collagen synthesis and structure characterized by skin hyperextensibility and joint hyper-FIGURE 20.25.

A variety of pulmonary manifestations have been described, including spontaneous or recurrent pneumothorax, bronchial dilation, parenchymal cysts, and arteriovenous anastomoses. 462 ,463 Fibrous parenchymal scars, presumably a sequela of spontaneous tears, have been reported, as have fibrous nodules and pseudotumors, which are believed to be an exuberant fibroproliferative response to injury (Fig. 20.25) . 464 The fragility of vessel walls in Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome predisposes patients to pulmonary hemorrhage, which in rare cases has resulted in fatal hemoptysis. 465 Both Ehlers-Danlos syndrome and cutis laxa have been associated with Mounier-Kuhn syndrome, a rare entity characterized by tracheobronchomegaly and trachiectasis (see Chapter 5) . 466.467 Pseudoxanthoma Elasticum Pseudoxanthoma elasticum, also known as Gronblad-Strandberg syndrome, is a heritable degenerative disease of elastic tissue. The etiology of pseudoxanthoma elasticum is not well understood, but mutations in the transmembrane protein ABCC6, which is thought to play a role in extracellular matrix deposition and turnover of connective tissue, have been identified. 468 In addition to cutaneous manifestations, which usually become apparent in the second decade of life, other organs, such as the eyes, cardiovascular system, and lungs, may be affected. 469 Histologically, the changes observed in the lungs in pseudoxanthoma elasticum are similar to those seen in other sites. 47o On routinely stained sections, elastic tissue within the lungs appears basophilic and disrupted (Fig. 20.26 ). The basophilia of elastic fibers in pseudoxanthoma elasticum is due to dystrophic calcification and can be highlighted by von Kossa or Alizarin red stains.471",

As they mature, these nodules undergo necrosis and cavitation (Fig. 20.29) . The histologic appearance of pulmonary necrobiotic nodules in UC is reminiscent of the cutaneous lesions seen in pyoderma gangrenosum. 513 As pulmonary necrobiotic nodules in UC may resemble infectious granulomas, infection should be excluded through histochemical stains and microbiologic cultures. Ulcerative colitis-associated necrobiotic nodules have some similarities with lesions in Wegener's granulomatosis. However, in contrast to Wegener's granulomatosis, giant cells and vasculitis are notably lacking in necrobiotic nodules associated with Uc. 513 In considering the differential diagnosis of pulmonary necrobiotic nodules, it is important to bear in mind that a subset of patients with lED, in particular those with UC, demonstrate antineutrophil cytoplasmic (ANCA) antibodies.542.543 However, the antibodies observed in patients with lED are perinuclear and directed against MPO antigen (p-ANCA) rather than the antiproteinase 3 cytoplasmic antibodies (c-ANCA) associated with Wegener's gran uloma to sis. 544 Along with infections, lED-associated granulomatous inflammation must be distinguished from hypersensitivity pneumonia, sarcoidosis, and drug-induced granulomas. Establishing a history of chronic active colitis is paramount. However, this may be difficult in cases where colitis has been inactive for a long period and essentially impossible in the rare instances in which pulmonary abnormalities precede other features of lED. Obtaining an exposure history is useful to search for an inciting antigen that might suggest hypersensitivity pneumonia. Differentiating lED-associated granulomatous inflammation from sarcoidosis on histology alone can also be difficult. The recognition of cases of coexisting sarcoidosis and lED makes this distinction even more diagnostically challenging. 520 , [545] [546] [547] [548] [549] Distinguishing pulmonary abnormalities related to lED from drug-induced changes can be quite difficult, given that many patients with lED are treated with immunosuppressive agents like sulfasalazine and 5-acetylsalicylic acid (ASA). Such drugs are known to induce a variety of pulmonary abnormalities, including eosinophilic pneumonia, NSIP, BOOP, and vasculitis. [550] [551] [552] [553] [554] [555] [556] [557] [558] Many other thoracic abnormalities have been described in lED, including pleuritis, pleural effusions, amyloidosis, pulmonary thromboemboli, and apical fibrosis resembling the findings seen in ankylosing spondylitis. [559] [560] [561] The prognosis of lED patients with pulmonary manifestations is good. Most patients improve without any specific therapy. Neither nonsteroidal agents typically used to control the intestinal manifestations of lED nor proctocolectomy appears to ameliorate lED-associated respiratory disease. 514 In fact, bowel surgery may exacer-.

While all components of the lung can be affected, some diseases, like rheumatoid arthritis, preferentially involve the interstitium. Others, such as SLE, predominantly affect the vasculature, while still others, such as RP, principally target the airways. Pleuropulmonary manifestations can be the first sign of collagen vascular disease in some cases. It is therefore important to consider collagen vascular disease in cases that show interstitial lung disease on biopsy, particularly when the pattern of involvement does not fit with one of the recognized idiopathic interstitial lung diseases or when other components of the lung are also affected. As pulmonary disease is a significant source of morbidity and mortality in patients with collagen vascular disease and is typically aggressively treated with immunosuppressant or cytotoxic agents, it is essential to correlate histopathologic findings with the clinical and radiographic impression to ensure an accurate diagnosis.
