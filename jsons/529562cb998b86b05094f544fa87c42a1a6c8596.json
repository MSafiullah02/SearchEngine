The high mortality rate associated with COVID-CSS has led to the off-label use of targeted anti-cytokine therapies aimed at blocking the inflammatory cascade and improving patient outcomes. Clinical trials are being conducted to assess the safety and efficacy of cytokine blockade in COVID- 19 . Currently there are no standard therapies for COVID-19 or COVID-CSS, and recent National Institutes of Health (NIH) guidelines have recommended against use of investigational agents outside of clinical trials [12] . On May 1, 2020 the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) have granted Emergency Use Authorization for the anti-viral drug remdesivir based on the as-yet unpublished results of a National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) sponsored randomized control trial that demonstrated reduced recovery time compared to placebo [13] . How this drug my influence cytokine storm and how the NIAID trial compares to a prior study that found no benefit of the drug are currently not known [14] .",

In 1993, (perhaps influenced by the military operation \"Desert Storm\") the term \"cytokine storm\" was coined to describe the hypercytokinemia seen in graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) [16, 17] . CSS has since been associated with viral infections (eg. Influenza, severe acute respiratory syndrome/SARS), autoimmune diseases (eg. systemic lupus erythematosus/SLE, systemic juvenile idiopathic arthritis/JIA), hematologic conditions (hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis/HLH) and medications [18] [19] [20] . Examples of the latter include the phase I clinical trial of TGN1412, an anti-CD28 monoclonal antibody that caused severe cytokine storm in healthy volunteers, and the cytokine release syndrome (CRS) following chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-T cell therapy [21, 22] . The wide heterogeneity of conditions that have been placed under this umbrella term underscore the need to better understand the pathophysiology and treatment of diseases characterized by hypercytokinemia. Recently, CSS has been defined as a condition of dysregulation and perpetuated activation of lymphocytes and macrophages resulting in secretion of large quantities of cytokines leading to overwhelming systemic inflammation and multi-organ failure with high mortality [20] .",

Some have proposed that COVID-19 is actually a hypo-inflammatory vasculopathy rather than a cytokine storm. This hypothesis is based on one study reporting relatively low interleukin-6 (IL-6) levels (mean 25 pg/mL, normal range < 7) measured on admission to hospital in one Chinese study [23] . However, cytokine storm is generally thought to develop later in the course of this disease, and emerging data from our center and others indicates that patients with COVID-CSS have a degree of hypercytokinemia (i.e. IL-6 levels 100 to 5000 pg/mL) comparable to conditions such as CAR-T cell CRS. The overlap in clinical and biochemical features between COVID-CSS and cytokine storm syndromes associated with other conditions may allow for insight into the underlying pathologic immune dysregulation in COVID-CSS and inform strategies for therapeutic intervention. In this review, we summarize the clinical features, pathologic mechanisms, standard and investigational therapies for CSS in three well-defined hematological cytokine storm syndromes: secondary hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (sHLH), idiopathic multicentic Castleman disease (iMCD), CAR-T cell CRS, in order to compare and contrast them with COVID-CSS.",

Primary HLH is typically a pediatric condition driven by germline mutations impairing granule-mediated cytotoxicity in natural killer and cytotoxic T cells [25] . The secondary HLH syndromes observed in adults are most often driven by infection (commonly viral such as Epstein-Barr virus [EBV], Cytomegalovirus [CMV], or Human Immunodeficiency Virus [HIV]); malignancy (lymphomas), primary rheumatologic conditions (termed Macrophage Activation Syndrome-HLH subtype, MAS-HLH), or medications (immune checkpoint inhibitors, lamotrigine) [24] . The HLH-2004 diagnostic criteria (Table 1 ) developed for the pediatric population are recommended to guide diagnosis in adults, and include soluble interleukin-2 receptor, a marker of T cell activation, as a cytokine-related diagnostic criterion [24, 26, 27] . The HLH-2004 criteria may be restrictive in identifying all patients that may benefit from immunomodulation. The HScore was developed specifically for secondary, and especially malignancy associated, HLH in adults, but unfortunately does not include any cytokine-related criteria [28] . Initially named for the hemophagocytosis seen on tissue biopsy; hemophagocytosis in bone marrow aspirate is a common but non-specific feature in adults [29, 30] . Clinical and laboratory features include fevers (often described as \"hectic\" in that they may exceed 40\u00b0C), organomegaly, cytopenias, coagulopathy, and profound hyperferritinemia often > 10,000 \u03bcg/L; which often rapidly worsen despite initial empiric anti-microbial therapy resulting in eventual multisystem organ failure [24, 31] . Mortality remains high in adults, around 70% despite therapy; though patients with MAS-HLH driven by rheumatologic diseases have better prognosis with less aggressive immunosuppression than other secondary HLH syndromes [24, 29] .",

First implemented in relapsed and refractory B-cell lymphoid malignancies, CD19 CAR-T cell therapy has demonstrated response rates of 50-90% in CD19+ B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia and non-Hodgkin lymphoma [36] . The activation of CAR-T cells after an encounter with target cells leads to release of granzyme and perforin, proliferation of the CAR-T cell population, and a supraphysiologic increase in cytokines such as IL-6 and interferon-\u03b3. This cytokine release syndrome (CRS) may occur in up to 70% of patients depending on conditioning therapy and cell construct, with ICU admission rates up to 13% [36] [37] [38] . CRS is grade 1-2 in the majority of patients but may be severe in 12-47% of patients [37] . CRS typically presents within the first 6 days following CAR-T cell infusion with fever as the defining feature followed by hypotension, tachycardia, hypoalbuminemia with capillary leak and weight gain, and consumptive coagulopathy [36, 38] . Immune effector cell associated neurotoxicity syndrome (ICANS) with a varied symptom profile (Table 1 ) may also be observed with later onset: during an episode of CRS or shortly after its resolution [36, [38] [39] [40] . ICANS can also occur in patients who did not develop CRS and this observation in addition to the separate timeline of development has resulted in the separation of ICANS from CRS in the consensus grading system as a distinct toxicity [39, 41, 42] . CRS may be observed after other tumour-directed immune therapies, including the bi-specific T-cell engager drug, blinatumumab [37] .",

            "text": "For most people who contract COVID-19, the clinical course is mild (and often asymptomatic) with the majority of those able to be recover from the disease at home. Individuals who require hospitalization most commonly present with fever, cough, fatigue, and dyspnea [7] [8] [9] 43] . Routine laboratory investigations on admission demonstrate lymphopenia, elevated D-Dimer, and elevated CRP. Chest imaging demonstrates bilateral patchy shadows or ground glass opacities [7] [8] [9] 43 ]. Twelve to 31% of patients admitted to hospital will eventually develop severe hypoxemic respiratory failure and require critical care support [5, 6, 9, 43] . Severe COVID-19 disease, as per WHO-China working group definition, includes the following: respiratory frequency \u2265 30/min, blood oxygen saturation \u2264 93%, PaO2/FiO2 ratio < 300, and/or lung infiltrates > 50% of the lung field within 24-48 h [44] . Critical disease is defined as severe COVID-19 with any of the following: respiratory failure, septic shock, and/or multiple organ dysfunction/failure [44] . While multi-organ failure is frequently reported in this population, marked organomegaly has not been reported. One of the emerging facets of severe COVID-19 is the association with a hypercoagulable state. D-dimer elevation was recognized early on in the pandemic to be an important prognostic marker for predicting severe disease and mortality [43] . Klok et al. have reported a 31% incidence of thrombotic complications in COVID patients admitted to the ICU including demonstration of venous thromboembolism (VTE) in 27% of patients [45] . Increased thrombotic risk is seen with many inflammatory states and reflects overlap in the regulation inflammation and thrombosis [46] . The profound activation of thrombotic pathways may be a unique feature to COVID-19 compared to other CSS, but remains to be confirmed in further studies.",

Inferring from studies of the genetic defects in primary HLH patients, the HLH syndrome results from the dysregulation and unrestrained activation of macrophages, cytotoxic T-cells and NK cells leading to the observed end-organ damage [24, 25, 31, 50] . The inability to resolve certain infections and subsequent uncontrolled immune activation may explain the amplified inflammatory response in sHLH from viral, bacterial, and fungal infections. Aberrant, autonomous cytokine production from malignant cells of the immune system may develop into the HLH observed in lymphomas [24, 25, 31] . Secondary HLH can complicate auto-inflammatory conditions (SLE, Stills disease, etc) with the inappropriate response to self-antigen driving continuous activation of T-cells and macrophages [24, 51] . The observed responses to IFN-\u03b3 antibody therapy suggests this may be a key factor perpetuating the pathologic feedback loop of inflammation; but murine models of primary HLH have implicated both IFN-\u03b3 dependant and independent pathways [52] [53] [54] .",

Mouse models of SARS-CoV suggest that delayed type I interferon signaling promotes accumulation of pathogenic inflammatory macrophages leading to hypercytokinemia, vascular leakage, and impaired T cell responses [60] . Deleting the IFNgamma receptor or depleting macrophages protected mice from lethal infection without affecting viral load, supporting that the inflammatory response may contribute more to severe disease pathology than direct viral effects [60] . In a subset of patients with COVID-19, disease severity seems to correlate with inflammatory markers commonly implicated in other cytokine storm disorders including IL-2R, IL-6, IL-10, and TNF cytokines [7, 8, 10] . In patients with COVID-CSS, development of sepsis, need for intubation, and ARDS, are accompanied by worsening inflammatory markers and are observed between 7 and 14 days after illness onset consistent with clinical deterioration due to inflammatory sequelae [43] . An autopsy series from 6 patients who died from COVID-19 demonstrated IL-6 production by virus-infected macrophages present in lymph nodes and spleen tissue, suggesting that viral-infection leading to macrophage production of IL-6 was the initial trigger for inflammatory dysregulation [61] .",

Tocilizumab is now FDA approved for use in CRS with response rates of 70% following 1-2 Table 3 Summary of therapies for CAR-T cell cytokine release syndrome. [22, 37] . Doses can be repeated every 6 to 24 h until CRS symptoms begin to improve. As tocilizumab is only used in short courses for a limited period, there is less concern of serious adverse events that may be seen in patients taking the drug long-term for rheumatologic indications. Tocilizumab administration has been demonstrated to not affect CAR-T cell efficacy, and is thus the preferred first line agent over corticosteroids. Tocilizumab appears to be not as effective for ICANS, likely because it does not cross the blood-brain barrier and targets the IL-6 receptor with no direct IL-6 lowering effect, leading to elevated systemic IL-6 levels after therapy without CNS protection [38, 40, 72] . Direct targeting of IL-6 by siltuximab may have better CNS response, though this has not been studied in clinical trials. As IL-6 levels correlate with disease severity in hospitalized COVID-19 patients, anti-IL-6 therapy has been one of the first treatment strategies explored during the pandemic [7] [8] [9] [10] . There have been several published case reports, as a well as two larger case series from China, using tocilizumab as a treatment for severe COVID-19 demonstrating biochemical efficacy with decrease markers of inflammation, but the impact of clinical outcomes such as time in intensive care and mortality compared to supportive care, remains unknown [74] [75] [76] [77] [78] [79] . A recent large series of 100 consecutive patients with severe COVID-19 demonstrated clinical stability or improvement in 77% of patients following administration of tocilizumab [80] . A press release for CORIMUNO-TOCI (NCT04331808), a multi-centre, open-label randomized controlled trial of tocilizumab in moderate and severe COVID19 has suggested positive results and with the study currently under peer-review [81] . Optimal timing of tocilizumab initiation is unknown, but there is sound rationale that earlier treatment in patients demonstrating a pathologic inflammatory response may ameliorate immune-mediated lung injury. Repeated doses of tocilizumab, similar in strategy to its use in CAR-T cell related CRS, may be reasonable for patients with refractory COVID-CSS. Serious risks of tocilizumab in the short term include a small risk of bowel perforation, acute hepatic failure, and osteonecrosis of the jaw [82, 83] . Case reports of hypertriglyceridemia and candidemia following tocilizumab infusion for COVID-19 have been reported [84, 85] .",

The use of JAK inhibitors is attractive as the medications are well tolerated, have short half-lives, and have the potential to target numerous inflammatory cytokine signaling pathways simultaneously. While ruxolitinib has been the agent most studied in HLH other JAK inhibitors may have potential advantages. Baricitinib, an oral JAK1/2 inhibitor that is currently approved for treatment of rheumatoid arthritis, was recently identified by artificial intelligence-based technology as a potential immunomodulatory treatment strategy for SARS-CoV-2 [104] . At therapeutic doses baricitinib is predicted to inhibit clathrin-mediated endocytosis and viral entry into cells by blocking the AP2-associated protein kinase 1 (AAK1) [104] . AAK1 regulates endocytosis in numerous cell types expressing ACE2, the receptor that mediates SARS-CoV-2 viral entry, including lung AT2 alveolar epithelial cells [104] . Because any agent that dampens the inflammatory response could lead to a potential loss of immune-mediated viral control, the hypothesized anti-viral effect makes baricitinib an attractive investigational therapy over agents that target disordered inflammation alone. Of concern with baracitinib is the increased risk of thrombosis which may increase the rate of thrombotic complications already observed with COVID-19 [105] . Clinical experience with COVID-19 is limited, but a pilot study of 12 patients has demonstrated improvement in fever, dyspnea, and hypoxia with a lower rate of ICU admission than a historical control cohort [106] .",

Similarly, ferritin and CRP levels in patients with COVID-19 are reportedly higher in patients with severe compared to moderate disease, and in patients who died compared to those that recovered [7, 8, 10] . In our experience with COVID-CSS patients in the ICU we have observed ferritin levels in the range of 1000-10,000 \u03bcg/L with CRP levels typically above 100 mg/L (Hoiland R et al., manuscript under review).",

In HLH, data available in pediatric patients demonstrate moderate IL-6 elevation though it has not been useful in distinguishing HLH from sepsis or other inflammatory conditions [112] . Idiopathic MCD is conceptualized as a primarily a disorder of IL-6 elevation, though serum IL-6 levels in iMCD may be normal or only mildly elevated. Response rates to IL-6 blockade do correlate with baseline IL-6 levels in iMCD, but many patients with low IL-6 levels will improve with therapy while patients with high IL-6 levels can show no response [32, 71] . IL-6 levels peak with disease flares in iMCD and can be used to monitor disease course, but once IL-6 blockade is initiated serial monitoring is not useful. Tocilizumab and sarilumab block the receptor for IL-6 leading to clinical improvement while serum IL-6 levels will remain stable or increase [72] . Similarly, IL-6 levels cannot be accurately interpreted for 12-18 months following the last dose of siltuximab. CAR-T CRS demonstrates substantial increases in IL-6 that correlates with severity of CRS and may be orders of magnitude greater the levels reported for iMCD, and HLH [38, 71, 112] . In COVID-19 IL-6 levels have been high for patients with more severe and fatal disease [7, 8, 10, 111] . In our institutions experience with COVID-CSS observed levels of IL-6 have been in the range of 100-5000 pg/mL (manuscript under review). Interferon-\u03b3 plays a central role in the pathogenesis of HLH, and elevated serum levels can help differentiate HLH from sepsis and other inflammatory disorders in children, but routine use for diagnosis in adults has not been studied [112, 113] . Following emapalumab therapy, interferon-\u03b3 levels do not correlate with disease response, but downstream targets of interferon such as CXCL9 and CXCL10 appear to have utility in monitoring disease activity and treatment response [54, 70] .",

Development of consensus definitions for COVID-CSS may lead to identification of patients most likely to benefit most from immune modulating therapy. We should use the lessons learned from hematologic cytokine storm syndromes to help expedite rapid identification, evaluation, and implementation of treatments urgently needed for COVID-19 CSS.",
