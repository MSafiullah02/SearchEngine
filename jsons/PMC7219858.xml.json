Other etiologies of moderate to severe thrombocytopenia during pregnancy include gestational thrombocytopenia, preeclampsia, hemolysis, elevated liver enzymes, and low platelets (HELLP) syndrome, and immune thrombocytopenia.3 Several mechanisms of COVID-19\u2013associated thrombocytopenia can be postulated. One hypothesis is direct infection of bone marrow cells by the SARS-CoV-2, thereby inhibiting platelet synthesis. Destruction of bone marrow progenitor cells via cytokine storm in a relatively mild case of COVID-19 in our case seems rather unlikely. Alternatively, it is possible that platelet destruction is immunemediated. Interestingly, quinine-based antimalarial medications are one of the leading causes of drug-induced immune thrombocytopenia (DITP). Quinine-dependent antiplatelet antibodies might bind noncovalently to specific platelet surface antigens. Hydroxyquinoline therapy was not initiated, however, in our case. Neither lamotrigine nor gabapentin is implicated in DITP to our knowledge. Finally, thrombocytopenia might occur secondary to a concomitant thrombotic and consumptive process involving platelet aggregation and microthrombi formation, which are implicated in COVID-19.",
