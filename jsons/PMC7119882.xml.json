The FIP virus (FIPV) originates from the less pathogenic feline enteric coronavirus (FECV) by a minor mutation (Pedersen and Floyd, 1985), and acquire the ability to pass through the epithelium into the lymph and to replicate in the cells of the monocytic\u2013macrophagic line (Stoddart and Scott, 1989). Within the monocytes, FIPV spreads throughout the body to target organs. The two feline coronaviruses (FCoV) have slight and poorly understood differences in their genoma (Vennema et al., 1995), but they are morphologically and antigenically identical (Boyle et al., 1984). This leads to some problems in both diagnosis and understanding of the pathogenesis of the disease.",

Even if antibody-enhanced infection has been recently questioned (Olsen et al., 1992, Olsen et al., 1993; Addie et al., 1995), many experimental results demonstrate that anti-FCoV antibodies facilitate the uptake of the virus by the macrophages (Hayashi et al., 1983; Stoddart and Scott, 1989; Barlough and Stoddart, 1990; Hohdatsu et al., 1994; Pedersen, 1995a), and that immunocomplexes lead to a type III hypersensitivity reaction with disseminated intravascular coagulation and fibrinoid necrosis of the vessel's walls, responsible for the effusions (Hayashi et al., 1977, Hayashi et al., 1978; Pedersen and Boyle, 1980; Weiss et al., 1980; Jacobse-Geels et al., 1980; Weiss and Scott, 1981; Fenner, 1987; Pastoret and Bourtonboy, 1991; Pedersen, 1995a). This hypothesized immune-mediated pathogenesis is also supported by epidemiologic considerations (Pedersen and Floyd, 1985; Addie et al., 1995) and by other immunopathological findings, such as the fluctuations of antibody titers and complement fractions during the course of the infection (Pedersen and Boyle, 1980; Jacobse-Geels et al., 1982).",

In cryostatic sections, endogenous peroxidase was inhibited with H2O2 (1%) in 0.1% sodium azide. The blocking sera (20 min at room temperature) were obtained from goats (for CD3), from rabbits (for IgG and IgM) or from horses (for monoclonal antibodies). Then the primary antibodies were applied overnight at 4\u00b0C. After three washes in Tris-buffered solution (pH 7.7) the biotinylated secondary antibodies (30 min at room temperature), and finally the ABC complex (30 min at room temperature) were added. Diaminobenzidine tetrahydrochloride or 3-amino-9-ethyl-carbazole served as chromogen for the reaction.

In other immune-mediated diseases such as leishmaniasis (Carvalho et al., 1992; Bourdoiseau et al., 1997), canine blastomycosis (Legendre and Becker, 1982) and feline immunodeficiency virus (Lin et al., 1990) or feline leukemia virus infections (Hoover et al., 1987), lymphopenia has been interpreted as a sign of reduced cell-mediated immunity. This conclusion was based upon a reduced lymphocyte blastogenesis (Legendre and Becker, 1982; Lin et al., 1990; Bishop et al., 1992; Carvalho et al., 1992) or a low CD4/CD8 ratio (Bishop et al., 1992; Lawrence et al., 1995; Hoffmann-Fezer et al., 1996). This study gives only a quantitative evaluation of lymphocytes, and no information about blood lymphocyte subpopulations or functions in FIP are available in literature. Thus, although an impairment of lymphocyte functions can not be excluded, the neutrophilia and eosinopenia only in the cats with the acute effusive form suggest a stress leukogram (Jain, 1986, Jain, 1993).",

The changes in \u03b1- and \u03b2-globulins are well documented in experimental infections by Stoddart et al. (1988)and characterized by a biphasic acute phase plasma protein response with increases of \u03b11-orosomucoid, \u03b12-haptoglobin and \u03b22-transferrin levels. The same author stated that \u03b3-globulins increases as the antibody titers begin to mount. In the spontaneous disease the early phases of antibody production are not detectable: however the occurrence of animals with high antibody titers without symptoms and of symptomatic cats with low antibody titers have been reported (Pedersen, 1976, Pedersen, 1977, Pedersen, 1995a, Pedersen, 1995b; Reynolds et al., 1977; Vanden Bossche, 1990; Sparkes et al., 1992a, Sparkes et al., 1992b). Based upon the pattern of antibody and \u03b3-globulin levels, four groups of cats were identified (Fig. 4\n):1.Cats with low antibody titers and low \u03b3-globulin concentrations: these cats were mainly those of the control group;2.Cats with high antibody titers and low \u03b3-globulin concentrations: these were cats with effusive FIP or control cats with FCoV antibodies: the latter occurs in FECV-endemic environments (Pedersen, 1995b);3.Cats with low antibody titers and high \u03b3-globulin concentrations: all of these cats were FIP affected, with either the effusive or noneffusive forms. On these animals, the low antibody titers result from the formation of immune complexes (Pedersen, 1987);4.Cats with high antibody titers and high \u03b3-globulin concentrations: they were symptomatic cats with effusive or noneffusive FIP.\n",

A C3 activating factor (C3AF) (Arroyave et al., 1976) and the C1r subunit (Ziccardi and Cooper, 1976) have a \u03b3-globulin motility (Roberts et al., 1981). The changes in the level of these proteins support the previous studies on the fluctuation of complement fractions (Jacobse-Geels et al., 1982) and further confirm the role of type III hypersensitivity in FIP. These changes were present in both the effusive and noneffusive forms, suggesting a similar involvement of the immune system.",
