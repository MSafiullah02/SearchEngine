            "text": "Aims: Bioprocess oxidative stress caused by many reactive oxygen species (ROS) can lead to largely irreversible perturbation of yeast bioprocesses. These include the production of proteins derived from recombinant DNA yeast technology (aerobically grown Saccharomyces cerevisiae). These proteins include rennin, amyloglucosidases (glucamylases), interferons, interleukins, insulin, monoclonal antibodies, tissue plasminogen activators (t-PA), sexually transmitted disease antigens, and measles, mumps and rubella antigens, growth hormones, somatotropin, blood clotting factors VIII and XIII. In addition, there may be a demand for severe acute respiratory syndromecoronavirus antigens, hepatitis A, B and C viral-selected antigens, HIV retroviral antigens, influenza antigens, trypanosomal antigens, and foot and mouth disease antigens. Prevention of oxidative stress has been achieved by application of antioxidant redox metalloenzymes such as superoxide dismutases (containing Cu/Zn cytosolic, Mn mitochondrial and Fe bacterial) glutathione peroxidases (and other Se-containing proteins and enzymes such as the thioredoxins), catalases (Fe-containing), cytochrome c peroxidases (Fe-containing), ceruloplasmins (Cu-containing), metallothionines (these cysteine thiol-rich proteins bind ions of cadmium and mercury) and tyrosinases (Cu-containing). Methods and Results: ROS are generated inadvertently by single metal valency couples such as FeII/FeIII and by FeIII/FeV present in 2700 (including 57 human) isoforms in cytochromes P450 mixed-function oxidases (EC 1AE14AE14AE1; O 2 : mono-oxygenase NADPH/NADH requiring). In addition, mixed-metal couples such as valency unmatched forms in CuI/FeII and FeIII/MnIV can recycle electrons. Moreover, proteins/protein chaperone couples can recycle electrons, often where futile-recycling systems have been instigated. Furthermore, oxidized membrane phospholipids (R) can form ROOH (lipid hydroperoxides) and ROH (lipid alkoxides) that can generate ROS through Fenton chemistry (iron-catalysed) chain reactions. Utilization of chain-breaking antioxidants such as vitamin E (a-tocopherol) in the lipid phase and vitamin C (ascorbate) in the aqueous phase can terminate these ROS-producing reactions.",

            "text": "Furthermore, the likelihood of superoxide anion-free radical (AEO 0 2 ) generation produces an enhanced risk of biomolecular injury as a manifestation of the biohazard of particular metal contamination, both of the environment and in the body. The essential role of oxygen gas, which has built up in the atmosphere as a result of the photosynthetic activity of green plants over a 3AE5-billion-year period is paramount in ROS production. The toxic nature of oxygen (Abele 2002) , although essential for aerobic life on earth, has been subject to amelioration of toxicity through evolution of antioxidant enzymes that have developed over the last 250 million years. Moreover these antioxidant enzymes in the body, such as superoxide dismutase, glutathione peroxidase and catalase, augment the role of dietary antioxidants such as vitamins E and C (Wiseman et al. 2000; Wiseman and Woods 2002) . Furthermore, the use of DNA recombinant forms may confer unexpected technological advantage in bioprocesses in cases where novel proteins, such as biocatalyst enzymes and cells, are introduced into previously unfavourable environments. Where these introductions are associated Table 1 Toxic and nontoxic metals that may be detectable in yeastbioprocess feedstocks (see Table 4 with the biometabolism because of gut microflora of animals, dietary idiosyncrasy considerations are involved in the prediction of harmful outcomes. These predictions therefore need to be evaluated as part of the risk/benefit analysis associated with the necessary toxic hazard/risk recommendation by studies in silico and in real-lab (in Petri). There is a major interest in the possibility that bioactive compounds in foods from agriculture, particularly those in plant and microbially fermented foods, can protect against a wide range of diseases . Furthermore, bioactive compounds can have gender-differentiated effects that are dependent also on a number of other factors including age, genomics and stage of reproductive development. Complacency may be the result of overconfidence in the prediction of 'nontoxicity', to bioprocess and to consumers, but failure to predict the likelihood of a disaster outcome with foodstuffs, has been manifest in the past. Examples include turkey X-disease caused by aflatoxin (a hepatotoxin and carcinogen) in groundnuts contaminated in storage by Aspergillus flavus (late 1940s Africa; see Tables 1 and 2) ; Spanish cooking oil syndrome caused by contamination of cooking oil with aniline (1970s); syndromes caused by forms of organic mercury produced by micro-organisms in waterways (1980s). Natural foodstuffs may also contain toxins (see Tables 3 and 4 ) and protectants (see Tables 5  and 6 ). Molecular toxicology has provided a good mechanistic basis for prediction of future problems, and this approach is supported by the power of computer modelling on a wide range of unusual microbially produced chemicals that reach the body via methods of bioprocessing of foodstuffs that include solid-state fermentation.

Fe 2+ reacts through Fenton chemistry (Halliwell and Gutteridge 1999) with lipid hydroperoxides (ROOH) or lipid alkoxides (ROH) in the phospholipid mixture after storage in an atmosphere that contains oxygen, to form these peroxyl (ROO \u2022 ) and alkoxy (RO \u2022 ) free radical derivatives of phospholipids. These free radicals initiate a chain reaction of further attack of the phospholipids via degradation reactions that produce large amounts of these free radical species (Wiseman et al. 2000; see Figs 3 and 4) .",

Moreover, the renewed demand for antigens of viruses such as hepatitis, severe acute respiratory syndrome (coronaviruses), foot and mouth disease, and HIV retroviruses, has established a greater demand for nonperturbation of yeast bioprocesses by ROS (Wiseman 2003 ) by development of stable phenotype despite variation in gene deletion (Stearns 2003) .",
