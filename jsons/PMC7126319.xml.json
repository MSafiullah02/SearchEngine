            "text": "Treatment of gastrointestinal diseases comprises a large part of small animal medicine, in which typical clinical signs are vomiting and diarrhoea that can lead to death of the animal (Sellon, 2005). Among the main viruses that cause diarrhea are the canine parvovirus-2 (CPV-2), canine enteric coronavirus (CCoV), canine rotavirus (CRV) and canine distemper virus (CDV) (Hoskins, 1997, Tams, 2003). Since the late 1970s, the CPV-2 strain has been known to be a major etiologic agent of infectious gastroenteritis in young dogs (Appel et al., 1979, Morais and Costa, 2007). Thus, canine parvovirus, which occurs with high frequency and endures for long periods of time in the environment, has stood out among other diseases because it results in high rates of morbidity and mortality (Hoskins, 1997). CPV-2 was first isolated in 1978, and since then, it has given rise to new antigenic types that have spread in the dog population (Appel et al., 1979, Morais and Costa, 2007). Over time, the original CPV-2 has been replaced by its antigenic variants, CPV-2a and CPV-2b (Decaro et al., 2008). A strain with an amino acid change, (Asp) \u2013 426 to (Glu) \u2013 426, in an important antigenic site was recognised in Italy in 2000 and was named CPV-2c (Buonavoglia et al., 2001). Subsequently, this strain was identified in Vietnam (Nakamura et al., 2004) and Spain (Decaro et al., 2006). In South America, this new type was first reported in Uruguay (P\u00e9rez et al., 2007), followed by Brazil (Streck et al., 2009) and Argentina (Calder\u00f3n et al., 2009). The identification and monitoring of the types of CPV-2 circulating in the canine population are important in the understanding of viral evolution and the development of measures to control its spread. The present study aimed to detect the presence and characterise the types of CPV-2 circulating in Brazil between the years 2008 and 2010.",

Therefore, dog vaccination and natural exposure to infection should have improved protection; however, a high incidence of disease continues in animals aged between 6 weeks and 6 months (Morais and Costa, 2007). This trend was confirmed by data found in the present study, in which 95.2% of the positive animals were between 1 and 6 months of age. Puppies are more prone to the development of haemorrhagic gastroenteritis caused by CPV-2, although dogs of any age, gender or breed may be affected (McCandlish, 1999, Morais and Costa, 2007, Parrish, 1999). From the 42 positive animals detected in the present study, 12 displayed no signs of HGE, showing that the clinical outcome may depend on the degree of maternal immunity, virulence of the virus strain, infectious virus dose and the host's immune system (Homem et al., 1999, Sellon, 2005, Tams, 2003).",

These data corroborate previous findings in the United States and Uruguay (Kapil et al., 2007, P\u00e9rez et al., 2007), although it had been shown that vaccination would protect dogs exposed to CPV-2c (Spibey et al., 2008).

In the 1980s, CPV-2a strains from many countries displayed the amino acid valine in this position (Cavalli et al., 2008, Decaro et al., 2006). The Ile555Val change can be considered to be a reversion to the original CPV-2 (Martella et al., 2006, Pereira et al., 2007). Comparison of the CPV-2c strains from Europe and Uruguay with those found in Brazil revealed silent mutations in residue 461 (AG) and 546 (CT) from eleven strains and amino acid mutations in two strains (Pro547Thr and Tyr573Phe). The Brazilian strains did not show the mutation at position 440 (TA) that had been previously described (Calder\u00f3n et al., 2011, Decaro et al., 2009, Hong et al., 2007, Kapil et al., 2007). The CPV-2c was the main subtype detected in the Brazilian samples, as previously found in the United States (Hong et al., 2007), Uruguay (P\u00e9rez et al., 2007) and Argentina (Calder\u00f3n et al., 2009). The detection of CPV-2c in Europe, Asia and the Americas is an indication of the worldwide spread of this new variant in the canine population (Decaro et al., 2006, Decaro et al., 2007). Martella et al. (2005) indicated an increasing replacement of subtypes CPV-2a and CPV-2b by CPV-2c that, from 2000 until 2004, increased from 17% to 60% of the samples in Italy. P\u00e9rez et al. (2007) suggested that the rapid spread of subtype 2c was likely associated with an important nucleotide substitution and might lead to the elimination of the other subtypes of CPV-2 over time. In other countries, such as India (Raj et al., 2010), Belgium and Italy (Decaro et al., 2009), the predominance of the type 2a strains has been verified. The CPV-2b has a more homogeneous distribution and has been detected in different Brazilian regions and in other European countries, such as France and the UK (Decaro et al., 2009, Pereira et al., 2000).",

Phylogenetic analysis of the variants circulating in the canine population of Brazil shows that they are very similar to those from other countries in the Americas.",
