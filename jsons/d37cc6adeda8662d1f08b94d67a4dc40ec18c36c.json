There remains an urgent need to understand its transmission characteristics and design effective interventions to mitigate its spread. In this study, we define a non-linear (known in biochemistry models as allosteric or cooperative) relationship between viral shedding, viral dose and COVID-19 infection propagation. We develop a mathematical model of the dynamics of COVID-19 to link quantitative features of viral shedding, human exposure and transmission in nine countries impacted by the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. The model was then used to evaluate the efficacy of interventions against virus transmission. We found that cooperativity was important to capture country-specific transmission dynamics and leads to resistance to mitigating transmission in mild or moderate interventions. The behaviors of the model emphasize that strict interventions greatly limiting both virus shedding and human exposure are indispensable to achieving effective containment of COVID-19.",

In response to the outbreak of Mathematical models have been used to understand the transmission dynamics of epidemics 7 from seasonal influenza 8 to the Ebola virus 9 , forecast their outbreak and spread, and evaluate the efficiency of interventions in containing these diseases 10 . The most widely applied mathematical models in epidemiology are compartmental models, for instance, the susceptible-infectedrecovered-deceased (SIRD) model, in which the total population is divided into several categories susceptible, infected, recovered, and deceased, between which exchange occurs. These models have served a fundamental role in reaching a quantitative understanding of transmission characteristics of COVID-19, such as estimation of basic reproduction number (R0), incubation period, and fatality rate [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] , and evaluation of the efficacies of interventions 5, 6, [16] [17] [18] [19] . While these models have greatly contributed to our current understanding of the COVID-19 pandemic, they lack information on infection mechanisms by SARS-CoV-2 and overlook the quantitative relationship between the rate of infection and dose of viral exposure. Instead, spread of the disease is taken to be directly mediated by interactions between infected and susceptible individuals, which are assumed to occur through linear relationships, thus creating a gap between the modeling tools currently available and the knowledge about detailed parameters of the virus, such as rates of virus shedding and decay 20, 21 , source-dependent viral dose 22, 23 , and dose dependent infectivity 24 , for which experimental data have been collected but not yet used in the development of quantitative models of the pandemic 25 .",

We show that the cooperativity in infection between uninfected and infected individuals is critical in explaining the transmission dynamics of COVID-19 in countries most severely impacted by the pandemic. Cooperativity has a long history in the study of biological dynamics that began with models of ligand binding to receptors with multiple binding sites and has numerous applications to understand fundamental molecular processes in living cells such as gene transcription and signal transduction 26, 27 . Despite the complexity in the pathology of diseases such as COVID-19, there exists a mechanistic similarity between the binding of a ligand and activation of a receptor with multiple binding sites, and the release of virus from an infected person and transmission to an uninfected host.

The reason for using a reduced model instead of the original SIRD model is that the rates for the transition from infected (I) to recovered (R) and deceased (D) are both proportional to the number of infected individuals (I), thus the sum of these two, N, also changes with a rate proportional to I. Moreover, a model with fewer parameters has the advantage of reducing parameter uncertainty and better avoiding overfitting. Using a standard mathematical term describing the cooperative relationship between V and infection of susceptible individuals by viable virus particles, we derived three variations of the original SIRD model, including the reduced SIRD model, the reduced SIRD model with virus pool, and the reduced SIRD model with virus pool and cooperative infection ( Figure 1A , Methods).

These models were then compared as to their accuracy in fitting data consisting of COVID-19 case numbers, recovered and deceased individuals in the nine countries with the highest and still rapidly increasing numbers of COVID-19 infections and deaths, which indicate ongoing COVID-19 pandemic as of Apr 3, 2020. These countries include USA, Turkey, UK, Spain, Italy, Germany, France, Switzerland, and Iran. Accuracy of fit was determined by a cost function defined as the mean squared deviation between simulated and actual daily numbers of infected individuals and non-susceptible individuals on dates within the time window between the confirmation of the first infection in the country and Apr 3, 2020 ( Figure 1B ). We found that among the three models, the reduced SIRD model with a virus pool and cooperative infection (i.e. the cooperative infection model) reached higher accuracy compared to the other two models in all countries, and was able to generate satisfactory fitting (i.e. optimal cost function < 0.005, which means that the mean error for each data point is less than 7.07% of the maximal value of actual data over the entire time course) in 7 out of the 9 countries ( Figure 1C ). By contrast, the two models without cooperative infection generated satisfactory fitting in only two countries, and the addition of the virus pool to the reduced SIRD model did not increase the fitting accuracy of the model despite the increased complexity of model (absolute difference in -log10(Optimal value of cost function) smaller than 0.003 for all countries, Figure 1C ), suggesting that consideration of cooperativity in infection is critical for the model to accurately predict the COVID-19 transmission dynamics.

Parameter sets generating satisfactory fits were obtained by sampling the parameter space (Methods). We found that, in the absence of intervention, all seven countries were predicted to undergo significant increase in the number of infected individuals, especially for the countries UK, USA and Turkey, for which the numbers of infections were predicted to increase rapidly without any tendency of slowdown ( Figure 2B ). We found that the two model parameters that significantly differ across countries are related to the susceptibility of the healthy population to infection (k) and the efficiency of patient clearance (a), while .

These results further support the use of the cooperative infection model because parameters for virus shedding, decay and dose response are directly determined by intrinsic properties of the virus 20 , thus we expect values of these parameters to be indistinguishable between countries, while the susceptibility of the healthy population and efficiency of patient clearance reflects the performance of public health measures and the healthcare systems which are country-specific.

Notably, we found that only population-based interventions with extremely high intervention strength ( = 0.1, equivalent to all people wearing N95 respirators) were sufficient to effectively prevent the growth of infected population (number of infected individuals on day 100 < 15% of the number in the absence of interventions for all countries except for Turkey and 39.8% for Turkey, Figure 3D ).

For each country, we simulated the relationship between the viral dose and the cooperative infection term using 5,000 parameter sets ( Figure 4B ).

We further illustrate this feature of the cooperative infection model by simulating the influence of different levels of viral concentration reduction on the value of cooperative infection term ( Figure 4C ). We found that, under a moderate-to-strong intervention that reduces the viral concentration by 90% (the left panel), the value of the cooperative infection term was only reduced by around 40% to 70% (values ranging from 44.9% for Germany to 68.6% for UK based on parameters with optimal fitting, left panel of Figure 4C , yellow stars). This finding indicates that the majority of infections cannot be prevented by these interventions. On the other hand, under an extremely strong intervention that removes 99% of the virus (the right panel), the value of cooperative infection term was effectively reduced by the extent of more than 90% (values ranging from 93.0% for Italy and 97.3% for France, right panel of Figure 4C , yellow stars). Taken together, these results demonstrate that the cooperativity in infection, which has been found to be indispensable for the model to accurately reproduce country-specific COVID-19 transmission dynamics in our previous analysis, dampens the effects of interventions, thus requiring extremely strong interventions to effectively mitigate the pandemic.",

We also note that, as with any mathematical model for a complicated process, this model is not without limitations. Like all models in computational epidemiology, this model does not account for many factors that contributes to the transmission of COVID-19. First, this model assumes that there is no regional heterogeneity and that the population is homogenously mixed, while it has been demonstrated that the susceptibility to and fatality of COVID-19 depends on many demographic factors, such as gender and age 11, 31 , and life style related variables, such as smoking history 32 . Countries are assumed to be isolated from each other, which means no international travels occur during the time period, while imported cases likely contribute to many COVID-19 outbreaks around the world. Moreover, since a data-driven approach was used to parameterize the models, it might underestimate the severity of the pandemic because of the existence of undocumented infections due to the limitation of diagnostic capacity 33 .

We considered two scenarios of intervention: the infected individual-based intervention that targets the infected population to reduce virus shedding from the infected individuals, and the population-based intervention that limits both virus shedding from infected individuals and exposure of susceptible individuals to the virus. The two scenarios of intervention were modeled by introducing a coefficient that quantifies the strength of intervention, to the cooperative infection model (Figure 3A). We considered three different levels of intervention strength (Figure 3B), equivalent to the approximate efficiency of N95 respirators ( = 0.1), surgical masks ( = 0.2), and homemade masks ( = 0.5) 28-30 .",

These findings highlight the importance of cooperativity in shaping population level responses to an infectious virus and offer new insights into the transmission dynamics of infectious diseases. Notably, the cooperativity in infection leads to the resistance of virus transmission to intervention strategies that are not strong enough, resulting in increased difficulty in designing effective interventions to control the pandemic. Aggressive interventions with the strength approximately equivalent to at least requiring all individuals, no matter infected or not, to wear N95 respirators all time while in public space, are predicted to be necessary by the model. These findings together stress the necessity of strong interventions in effectively controlling the transmission of COVID-19.",

Nevertheless, the model, while possibly underestimating the severity of COVID-19 due to simplification, still forecasts the rapid escalation in COVID-19 spread, and highlights the extreme urgency of stronger interventions such as contact tracing, rigorous social distancing, or the application of N95 respirators for public use by showing that moderate interventions are not likely to effectively reduce transmission due to the cooperative infection term. Modest measures such as those adopted so far in the USA unfortunately nevertheless disrupt the normal function of society and creates substantial economic and societal costs and may not be effective as planned. In summary, this study develops a cooperative infection model that connects viral dynamics to the transmission dynamics of COVID-19 at the population level, captures the nonlinearity in the dose-response relationship in viral infection, correctly reproduces COVID-19 transmission characteristics in different countries, and, forecasts the rapid spread of COVID-19 in the absence of extremely strong interventions due to the cooperativity in SARS-CoV-2 infection. While further research and analysis are needed to improve the model and better understand the molecular mechanisms behind the cooperativity in viral infection, the predictions of this model demonstrate the indispensability of stronger interventions 14,36 that should encourage policy makers with interests in public good.",
