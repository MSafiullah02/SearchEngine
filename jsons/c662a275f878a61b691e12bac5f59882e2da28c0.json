Previous studies have evaluated doffing practices of HCWs in hospital and laboratory settings using both direct observations and video recording methods, and our results are relatively consistent with that of others, given differences in study designs. Katanami et al. [5] assessed PPE use by HCWs using cameras outside of patient rooms identified for contact precautions and reported that adherence to wearing all required PPE was only 34%. We observed much higher compliance of PPE use during care for patients in contact isolation (100%, Table 1 ), but the comparison is limited by our small numbers of observations (n \u00bc 4).

Part of the difference in these results may be due to the fact that we counted contact made by a bare hand only, while Beam et al. considered contact made by any unprotected body part. We found that HCWs removed PPE in the wrong sequence in 52% of observations, which was similar to percentage of HCWs observed by Zellmer et al. [9] Zellmer et al., however, made direct observations outside the patient rooms, so several components of the doffing protocol, including removing glove inside-out and removing gown from the front, were not captured in that study.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 352, "end": 355, "text": "[5]", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 723, "end": 726, "text": "[6]", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}, {"start": 1393, "end": 1396, "text": "[9]", "ref_id": "BIBREF8"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 624, "end": 631, "text": "Table 1", "ref_id": "TABREF0"}], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "We found that gown doffing was the most common doffing problem among HCWs, as HCWs removed the gown by grasping the front of the gown in 58% of observations. This finding was consistent with the Beam et al. [6] study, which found that 75% of HCWs did not remove the gown as recommended. Reusable fabric gowns tie in the back, and the CDC recommends that these gowns be removed from the back-taken off by unfastening gown ties, pulling away from the shoulder inside-out, and folding into a bundle. However, there are different recommendations for gown removal for different types of gowns. In particular, the CDC recommends removing disposable gowns by pulling the gown in the front, away from the body, until the ties break, and then rolling the gown inside out and removing the gloves with the gown. [8] This approach is not feasible with reusable fabric gowns that have woven textile ties, such as were worn by HCWs observed in this study, as these ties are difficult to break. A possible reason that HCWs may frequently doff gowns incorrectly is that they have been trained in both doffing approaches, but over time have forgotten that the best doffing strategy depends upon the type of gown. The impact of gown doffing method on self-contamination, however, is uncertain. Osei-Bonsu et al., [10] in a doffing simulation study involving disposable gowns, found that use of the CDC-recommended doffing sequence that includes removing the gown by pulling from the front was associated with fewer participants with any contamination by the surrogate microorganism Staphylococcus dermidis than use of the doffing sequence that includes removing the gown from the back ( There is an uncertainty in the CDC recommendations regarding whether HCWs should wear a mask with eye shield, or simply a mask, when in close contact with a patient in droplet isolation. [11] In our study, the hospital required HCWs to wear a surgical mask with eye shield in patient rooms identified for droplet isolation, and this was indicated on the isolation sign mounted on the room door. However, we found that in more than one-third of observations when the mask was used, HCWs took off the eye shield while providing care for patients. It may be that HCWs remove the eye shield when wearing prescription eye glasses, but this aspect of the PPE use was not specifically recorded. Removal of the eye shield can increase the risk of exposure to splashes of infectious material to the facial mucous membranes of HCWs, but the eye shield offers much less protection than indirectly vented goggles with anti-fog coating or chin-length face shield in conjunction with a mask, as recommended by the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health to protect the conjunctiva from infectious aerosols. [12] In our study, we had a very high incorrect overall doffing rate (90%) because we evaluated the doffing technique, doffing sequence and the use of correct PPE. However, all doffing errors are not likely to contribute equally to the risk of disease transmission to HCWs or patients. It is plausible that touching contaminated surfaces with bare hand and not performing hand hygiene are the highest risk doffing errors because they increase the likelihood that a HCWs leaves the patient room with pathogens on his or her hands. This issue will be explored in future work that integrates measures of virus presence and concentration on environmental surfaces, PPE, and HCWs.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 207, "end": 210, "text": "[6]", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}, {"start": 801, "end": 804, "text": "[8]", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}, {"start": 1295, "end": 1299, "text": "[10]", "ref_id": "BIBREF9"}, {"start": 1667, "end": 1668, "text": "(", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1856, "end": 1860, "text": "[11]", "ref_id": "BIBREF10"}, {"start": 2776, "end": 2780, "text": "[12]", "ref_id": "BIBREF11"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "Many factors may contribute to lack of compliance with PPE use during care for patients in contact and/ or droplet isolation and with incorrect doffing, including: incorrect interpretation of the isolation signs, workload, under valuing the importance of PPE, under estimation of risk, or lack of knowledge of the correct PPE and correct doffing protocol. [13] Although more complex than the PPE ensembles used in transmission-based precautions, human factors analyses of the doffing process for enhanced PPE ensembles used to care for patients with EVD, have highlighted numerous opportunities for PPE failure and self-contamination. [3] Gurses et al. [14] concluded that safe doffing of PPE requires knowledge, skills and attitudes, not just instructions for the sequence and technique for how to remove pieces of PPE. Our observations suggest that HCWs are not familiar with the sequence and technique for how to remove pieces of PPE, but training that builds knowledge and skills and changes attitudes may motivate HCWs to utilize the correct sequence and technique. This requires a more comprehensive approach to training than is commonly employed today; one that includes knowledge and practical, hands-on experience. Hands-on training in PPE was commonly used with enhanced PPE ensembles during the Ebola Virus Disease outbreak of 2014-2015, and trainees identified hands-on training as has having the greatest influence on their confidence to care for Ebola Virus Disease patients. [15] Such training could be integrated into HCWs' clinical competency skills tests.
