Although viruses of diverse genetic backgrounds can co-exist asymptomatically in bats, majority of these viruses are single stranded RNA viruses (Calisher et al., 2006). Coronaviruses (CoVs) are enveloped, positive-sense, single-stranded RNA viruses in the family Coronaviridae, and are usually associated with respiratory, enteric, hepatic and neurological pathologies of varying severity (Woo et al., 2012). Coronaviruses are classified into four genera; Alphacoronavirus (\u03b1-CoV) and Betacoronavirus (\u03b2-CoV) have been exclusively identified in mammals, whereas Gammacoronavirus and Deltacoronavirus are mainly detected in avian species (Woo et al., 2012, ICTV, 2015). Based on the genetic relatedness, the \u03b2-CoVs can further be subdivided into four clades: A to D (Drexler et al., 2014).",

This relation can be exemplified by the high similarity of the CoV RNA partial sequences (91,9%) detected in Carollia perspicillata species from Fenix-PR, Brazil (KT717385), and Fyzabad, Trinidad and Tobago (EU769557) (Carrington et al., 2008), located at a distance of at least 3900 km.

A distinct cluster of \u03b1-CoVs were also detected in Sturnira bat that grouped with \u03b1-CoVs lineage 1, a group with an evolutionary history of recombination and cross-species transmission between domestic and livestock animals, such as feline, canine and swine \u03b1-CoVs (Lorusso et al., 2008). This clade presents nt similarity between 73.9% and 74.4% with transmissible gastroenteritis virus (DQ811789) and feline coronavirus (AF124987) depending on the Sturnira lineage (Supplementary table). This branching pattern may possibly explain the common-ancestral origin of \u03b1-CoVs lineage 1 species from bats and other animal species. However, extensive evolutionary studies on complete genome sequences of these isolates are required to provide information on the virus origin and divergence.",

These sequences showed sequence similarities with \u03b2-CoV detected in Pipistrellus bats that poses high homology with human MERS-CoV (JX869059). Notably to observer that the Eumops bat positive for CoV was found on an urban area and was predated by a domesticated cat. It was not possible to rule out any event of virus transmission to human, however, this highlight the potential of domesticated animals in virus transmission and disease dynamics at the virus-animal-human interface. This is of special importance due to the established role of animals in the transmission of viruses to human being (Johnson et al., 2015). Taken together, these results represent the first detection of lineage C \u03b2-CoV in South American bats. Despite of close relationship between lineage C \u03b2-CoVs in Asia, Africa and Europe, cumulative data indicate that this lineage showed a more diversified host family distribution in Americas in Mormoopidae, Phyllostomidae and Molossidae bat species (Anthony et al., 2013, Corman et al., 2013, Goes et al., 2013).",
