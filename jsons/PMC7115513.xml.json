            "text": "Faced with the challenges of drug resistance, poor health systems, lack of affordable, safe and convenient treatment options, efficient treatment of malaria, one of the most devastating parasitic diseases, represents an unmet medical need. Malaria is a major public health concern in more than 90 countries inhabited by more than 2.4 billion people \u2013 40% of the world's population and is responsible for almost 1 million deaths every year [1]. The majority of malaria victims in developing countries are pregnant women or children under the age of five, possessing little or no immunological protection. The disease is estimated to result in \u223c250 million new annual infections worldwide. Though the majority of the cases and approximately 90% of the malaria deaths are found in sub-Saharan Africa, the disease is now increasing in Asia and Latin America. Malaria is caused by protozoan parasites of the genus Plasmodium that infects and destroys red blood cells eventually leading to death, if untreated. The persistent threat of emergence of multidrug resistant Plasmodium falciparum, universal chloroquine resistance [2], [3], suspected resistance to artemisinins [4], [5], and lack of effective, appropriate and affordable treatment options have given a new impetus to the research leading to broadening of the range of therapeutic targets. Thus, creating a new armamentarium of drugs with promising antimalarial activity coupled with understanding of their mode of action may lead to the development of a new generation of treatments both for malaria control and eradication.",

The mode of action of 2,4-diaminopyrimidine based drugs, typified by pyrimethamine 4\n[9] and the lead compound WR99210 5\n[10] is through the inhibition of P. falciparum Dihydrofolate reductase (Pf DHFR) enzyme, required for the biosynthesis of tetrahydrofolate involved in the biotransformation of thymidylate synthase-catalysed deoxyuridylate to deoxythymidylate (dUMP \u2192 dTMP), through a methyl group transfer reaction during DNA biosynthesis [11], [12], [13], [14], [15], [16]. In addition, a number of polyamines inhibit ornithine decarboxylase activity in P. falciparum through binding with plasmodial DNA [17], [18]. Recently, investigations in hybrid antimalarial agents, combining 4-aminoquinoline with other pharmacophore having antimalarial activity have been found to be less prone to resistance to parasite and has thus offered an effective means to overcome the problem of drug resistance.",

The in vitro anti-plasmodial activities of 10a\u2013s were determined in primary and secondary screening against CQS and CQR strains of P. falciparum. The half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) of 10a\u2013s are summarised in Table 2\n(Fig. 1). Evidently, the compounds have anti-plasmodial activity in the nM range and against the CQR strain of P. falciparum, in some cases activity was found to be even superior to CQ.

Further lengthening of the spacer chain length resulted in significant reduction in activity against both the CQR as well as the CQS strains. Replacing the C-4 phenyl group in 10c by a methyl group to create 10m resulted in nearly 5 times increase in anti-plasmodial activity (IC50 42.1 nM) against the CQS strain. In fact, compound 10m was found (Table 2) to be the most active compound of the series, against the CQS strain. However, 10m exhibited a high resistance factor (\u223c39) within the series but is 3.5 times less active than CQ, against the CQR strain. Replacement of the ethyl ester with iso-propyl ester (10n\u2013s), in general showed a decrease in in vitro anti-plasmodial activity against the CQS strain, although a reverse trend was observed for the CQR strain, especially in case of 10s, 10p and 10r, where replacing C-4 phenyl by p-nitrophenyl (10s) or o-nitrophenyl (10p and 10r) groups, in addition to incorporating an isopropyl ester, resulted in an increase of activity in that order, rendering 10r as the most potent (IC50 3.6 nM, 56 times more potent than CQ, Table 2) of all these compounds. These results are in accordance with the trend observed in case of N, N-bis(7-chloroquinolin-4-yl)alkane diamines, wherein the alkyl spacer consisting of four carbon atoms showed optimum potency [24].",

Moreover, the introduction of a nitro substituent on the phenyl ring at the C-4 position of the pyrimidine core results in a significant increase in anti-plasmodial activity as well as resistance against the CQR strain, although it has little effect on activities against the CQS strain (Table 2). Also, the corresponding o-, m- or p-nitro derivatives showed considerable variation in anti-plasmodial activity (Table 2). Comparison of compounds (10n, 10q, 10s) having an identical spacer reveals that the p-NO2 substituted 10s (IC50 175.8 nM) is more active than the o-/m-NO2 substituted compounds 10q and 10n, respectively, but are less active than the unsubstituted ethyl ester analog 10b. Further, comparison with the butyl spacer analog suggests that o-NO2 phenyl derivative 10r is more potent than the m-NO2 counterpart 10o, as well as its ethyl ester analog 10c, against the CQR strain. Compound 10r was found to be the most active compound in this series against the CQR strain with anti-plasmodial activity (IC50 3.6 nM), 56 times more than CQ (IC50 201.8 nM) and comparable to artesunate (IC50 2.8 nM) (Table 2).",

Thus, compound 10j displayed a 540-fold decrease in activity compared to 10b, against the CQR strain. Likewise, 10k possessing a branched C-6 spacer depicted a decrease (IC50 860.4 nM, Table 2) in activity against linear alkyl (C-7) spacer analog 10d (Table 2), but higher than 10j. Comparing 10j and 10k, with branched chain spacers, not only was the anti-plasmodial activity of the latter against both CQS and CQR strains increased, but it also showed an increased resistance factor (\nTable 2). The replacement of linear chain spacers with o- and p- linked aryl groups (10h and 10i, respectively), led to much higher IC50 (Table 2) values compared to former against CQR strain, while only moderate activity was observed in case of 10i against CQS strain. These findings could be attributed to the increased steric bulk (10h more than 10i) affecting the interaction of the iron center of heme with the compounds. This has been corroborated by performing the titration of monomeric heme with both 10h and 10i. While the titration of heme (2.4 \u03bcM, DMSO:H2O/4:6, v/v) with increasing concentration of 10h (0\u201385.7 \u03bcM, DMSO:H2O/4:6, v/v) revealed no change in the absorbance at 402 nm (Fig. 2a), the addition of 10i, in a similar way showed marked gradual decrease in absorbance at 402 nm. The decrease in absorbance continued until the concentration of 10i was 8.85 \u03bcM (Fig. 2b), representing 1:4 molar ratio of heme and 10i. Hence, the flexibility, chain length and steric constraints of the spacer linking quinoline moiety and pyrimidine unit seem to play a role in anti-plasmodial activity of these derivatives. Although the in vitro activity of 10a\u2013c, 10p and especially 10r (IC50 3.6 nM) was superior to CQ (IC50 201.8 nM) against the CQR strain, these compounds suffer from high ClogP values (Table 2), which are suggestive of the fact that these possess limited aqueous solubility, which in fact is not a serious limitation in view of recent advancements in formulation methods.",

These compounds are also expected to bind to heme [Fe(III)PPIX] (hydroxo or aqua complex of ferriprotoporphyrin IX) in solution and inhibit aggregation to \u03b2-hematin, in much the same way as CQ itself. The higher ClogP values (Table 2) of these compounds being higher than CQ necessitated the use of aqueous DMSO as solvent. Also in 40% aqueous DMSO solution, heme is expected to be monomeric, while in purely aqueous solutions, it exists in aggregated form. Further, it is known that CQ binds to heme dimer (\u03bc-oxo heme) in vitro and can also inhibit the formation of \u03b2-hematin, the in vitro analog of hemozoin [27], [28], [29], [30]. Therefore the binding assay was also extended to heme dimer also. The interaction of 10c and 10r with monomeric heme was followed by spectrophotometric titration at pH 7.4 and 5.6 (the approximate pH of food vacuole), as described previously [31]. The spectral changes (Fig. 3A, SI Figure S1), upon addition of increasing amounts (0\u201370 \u03bcM) of 10r to a solution of heme (2.4 \u03bcM, HEPES buffer pH 7.4) showed substantial decrease of intensity of the Fe(III)PPIX Soret band at 402 nm with no shift in the absorption maximum. The longer wavelength Q-bands (494 and 537 nm) of the metalloporphyrin also decrease in intensity (SI Figure S2) [32]. A sharp isosbestic point was observed at 416 nm (pH 7.4) and at 412 nm (pH 5.6). The association constants for the complexes formed between monomeric Fe (III) PPIX and 10r at pH 7.5 and 5.6 were calculated from titration data and are presented in Table 3\n.",

With addition of increasing amount of 10r to the solution of \u03bc-oxo heme, the absorbance of Soret band (362 nm) decreased appreciably with significant red shift (362\u2013405 nm, Fig. 5A). The association constants and stoichiometry for both 10r and 10c were determined from titration data and are presented in Table 3.The calculated association constant of 10r (log K 6.31) is greater than 10c (log K 6.09) and corresponds to 1:1 stoichiometry of the 10r:\u03bc-oxo heme complex. The comparison of association constants of 10r and 10c for monomeric and \u03bc-oxo heme reveals that both compounds bind strongly with \u03bc-oxo heme than monomeric heme and inhibit hemozoin formation by blocking the growing face of heme resulting in the observed anti-plasmodial activity. Further, all the compounds were also screened for in vitro inhibition of \u03b2-hematin formation using \u03b2-hematin inhibitory assay in order to further confirm their mechanism of action based on interference with the heme detoxification process [37], [38].",

Further, 10r showed dose dependent inhibition of \u03b2-hematin formation (SI Figure S4) with an IC50 value lower than those reported for CQ and quinine, thus demonstrating a better ability to interact with Fe(III)PPIX.

Additionally, interactions between aromatic nucleuses of the drug with nucleotide bases might also contribute. Binding of the plasmid DNA with CQ resulted in the elevation of the thermal melting temperature (T\nm\n) of DNA in addition to other effects [44], [45], [46], [47]. We therefore investigated the binding of the most active of the series, 10c and 10r toward GC rich Calf Thymus DNA (CT DNA) as well as AT rich pUC18 DNA through stepwise addition of small increments of DNA to a solution the compounds at constant concentration as well as physiological pH (Fig. 6A and B).

The strong interaction of the pyrimidine analog with AT rich pUC18 DNA further suggests that these compounds might target parasite DNA which has unusually a high AT content [47] in addition to \u03b2-hematin inhibition.

It is worth comparing the performance of the compounds designed in this work with that of 5, using molecular docking methods. The crystal structure (PDB id: 1J3I, a structure of wild-type Pf DHFR-TS complexed with WR99210, NADPH, dUMP) was considered for molecular docking analysis. After appropriately preparing the protein structure of Pf DHFR, docking of 5 and 10r were carried out. Fig. 8 shows the top scoring binding pose of 10r in the active site of Pf DHFR. The docking score for 10r is \u221224.5, which is much better than that of the lead compound 5 (\u221220.1). The origin of this improvement in docking score can be traced to the increased number of stabilizing interactions between 10r and Pf DHFR, in comparison to the interactions between 5 and Pf DHFR. 10r shows hydrogen bonding interaction with Tyr170 and Asn108 residues; these two interactions are common to 10r as well as to 5.

            "text": "An efficacious transformation for converting readily available 3, 4-dihydropyrimidinones (DHPMs) to 2-aminopyrimidine based 4-aminoquinolines is presented. The compounds showed anti-plasmodial activity identical to or superior to CQ. Structure\u2013activity relationship has been drawn leading to the identification of at least one compound 10r as lead compound in this series. The tested compounds did not depict any antiviral activity and were cytotoxic. Binding interaction of representative potent compounds with heme and \u03bc-oxo heme using UV\u2013visible and NMR experiments furnished log K values identical with CQ binding and pointed to 1:1 stoichiometry of the most stable complexes in solution. DNA (both GC and AT rich) binding affinity using absorption and spectrofluorometric data indicated stronger interaction of 10c (20 fold) than 10r with CT DNA, however, 10r showed higher affinity toward AT rich pUC18 DNA suggesting targeting of parasite AT rich DNA by 10r in addition to \u03b2-hematin inhibition as possible mode of action of these compounds. DNA melting experiments suggested primary groove binding and/or partial intercalative nature of interaction of 10c and 10r with CT DNA. Thus, the strong electrostatic interaction of newly designed pyrimidine analogs with AT rich DNA and blockage of heme polymerisation by complexation of drug with heme contribute to the observed antimalarial activity in nano molar range. Further, molecular docking analysis of 10r in the active site of Pf DHFR indicated superior binding compared to WR99210. Thus, drug 10r acts on multiple targets (Heme, Enzyme involved in biosynthesis of DNA (DHFR), parasite DNA) which accounts for its high anti-plasmodial activity.",

The cultures were naturally asynchronous (65\u201375% ring stage) and were maintained in continuous log phase growth in RPMI1640 medium supplemented with 5% washed human A+ erythrocytes, 25 mM Hepes, 32 nM NaHCO3, and AlbuMAXII (lipid-rich bovine serum albumin) (GIBCO, Grand Island, NY) (CM). All cultures and assays are conducted at 37 \u00b0C under an atmosphere of 5% CO2 and 5% O2, with a balance of N2. Stock drug solutions were prepared in 100% DMSO (dimethylsulfoxide) at 20 mg/ml. The compound was further diluted to the appropriate concentration using complete medium RPMI1640 supplemented with 15 nM cold hypoxanthine and AlbuMAXII. Assays were performed in sterile 96-well microtitre plates; each plate contained 100 \u03bcl of parasite culture (0.5% parasitemia, 2.5% hematocrit). Each compound was tested in triplicate and parasite growth compared to control and blank (uninfected erythtocytes) wells. After 24 h of incubation at 37 \u00b0C, 3.7 Bq of [3H] hypoxanthine is added to each well [51]. Cultures were incubated for a further 24 h before they are harvested onto glass-fiber filter mats. The radioactivity was counted using a Wallac Microbeta 1450 scintillation counter. The results were recorded as counts per minute (CPM) per well at each drug concentration, control and blank wells. Percentage inhibition was calculated from comparison to blank and control wells, and IC50 values calculated using Graph Pad Prism 4.0. The preliminary screen uses the 3D7 strain. The compounds were tested at 6 concentrations (30, 10, 3, 1, 0.3, and 0.1 \u03bcg/ml). If the compound did not affect parasite growth at 10 \u03bcg/ml it was classified as inactive, between 10 and 1 \u03bcg/ml, the compound was designated as partially active, and if <1 \u03bcg/ml, the compound was classified as active and was further evaluated by three-fold serial dilutions in a repeat test. For secondary screening both the 3D7 clone and the K1 line were used. The compound was diluted three-fold over at 12 different concentrations with an appropriate starting concentration based on the preliminary screen. The IC50 is determined by a sigmoidal dose response analysis using Graph Pad Prism 4.0. For each assay, the IC50 and IC90 values for each parasite line were determined against the known anti-plasmodials chloroquine and artesunate.",

Viral cytopathicity was recorded as soon as it reached completion in the control virus-infected cell cultures that were not treated with the test compounds. The anti-HIV activity and antiproliferative activity were evaluated against HIV-1 strain IIIB and HIV-2 strain ROD in human T-lymphocyte CEM cell cultures. Briefly, virus stocks were titrated in CEM cells and expressed as the 50% cell culture infective dose (CCID50). CEM cells were suspended in culture medium at \u223c3 \u00d7 105 cells/ml and infected with HIV at \u223c100 CCID50.
