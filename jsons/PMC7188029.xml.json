In our simulation, the anesthesiologist covered the head of an airway mannequin with this sheet before preoxygenation with a facemask that is connected to the artificial manual breathing unit through crosscut (Figure B). After induction of anesthesia, vocal cords are visualized either by a direct or video laryngoscope under the sheet (Figure C), and the endotracheal tube is passed through a marked crosscut in the sheet (Figure D). After successfully securing the endotracheal tube cuff, the instruments used are isolated to avoid contamination. We proposed to keep the patients head covered during extubation and, if feasible, during surgery.",
