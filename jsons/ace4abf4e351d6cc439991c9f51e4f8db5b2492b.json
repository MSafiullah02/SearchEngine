            "text": "Infectious diseases continue to cause suffering and death in this teeming world of almost 6 billion people. Every individual is vulnerable to microbial infections regardless of socioeconomic status, gender, age group or ethnic background. Increased international air travel, mass tourism and the expansion of globalization have meant that disease-producing pathogens can be transported and spread rapidly from one geographic region to another. This has been dramatically demonstrated by the sudden and completely unexpected multi-country outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in the beginning of 2003 [1] . This atypical pneumonia, caused by a human coronavirus, led the World Health Organization to issue an exceptional global alert and caution against travel to certain countries. The unfolding tragedy of AIDS, particularly in many developing nations, continues to be vividly highlighted by the scientific and public media. According to current estimates, over 30 million people are virus carriers and around 15000 new cases of HIV occur daily. Tuberculosis and other infections which caused ravages in the nineteenth century are once again resurgent. Several infectious agents, such as neurological variants of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease in Europe, vector-borne West Nile virus in the USA, vancomycin-resistant forms of bacteria in Japan, and virulent avian influenza in humans in Hong Kong, have emerged as public health concerns over the past few years.The sheer adaptability and the destructiveness of infectious microbes pose threats of unforeseen diseases in the 21st century. According to the World Health Organization, at least 30 new diseases have emerged over the past two decades and underscore the need to be vigilant.",

The acute respiratory infections in children, mostly caused by Pneumococci and Haemophilus influenzae, are becoming more drug-resistant. Over 90% of Staphylococcus aureus strains and about 40% of Pneumococci strains are resistant to penicillin which was introduced in the 1940s. Salmonella typhi, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Enterococcus faecium, and Shigella dysenteriae have been reported as multidrug-resistant. Crucial drug choices for the treatment of common infections by bacteria, viruses, parasites,and fungi are becoming limited and even nonexistent in some cases. This development has not been parallelled by an effective increase in the discovery of new medicines for most microbial pathogens [3] .The struggle to control infectious diseases, far from being over, has acquired a new poignancy. Novel concepts acting as adjuncts to established therapies are urgently needed.",

            "text": "The interactions between a host and an infectious pathogen are complex, diverse and intricately regulated. CYTOKINES, hormone-like polypeptides possessing pleiotropic properties, are crucial in orchestrating the appropriate immune responses critical for the outcome of an infection.Certain CYTOKINES stimulate the production of other CYTOKINES and interact in synergistic or antagonistic networks. CYTOKINES exhibit specific IMMUNOMODULATORY properties that can enable manipulation of the host response to enhance overall immunogenicity and direct the nature of the response either toward a type 1 or type 2 pathway. In the type 1 response, Th1 cells produce interferon-\u03b3 (IFN-\u03b3), tumor necrosis factor-\u03b2 (TNF-\u03b2) and INTERLEUKIN-(IL-)2 that are required for effective development of cell-mediated immune responses to intracellular microbes. In the type 2 response, Th2 cells produce IL-4 and IL-5 that enhance humoral immunity to T-dependent ANTIGENS and are necessary for immunity to helminth infections. Recent studies have shown that lymphoid progenitor-derived DEN-DRITIC CELLS (DC1) can also express IL-12 and preferentially induce type 1 T CELL responses, whereas myeloid progenitor-derived DENDRITIC CELLS (DC2) express IL-10 and induce type 2 T CELL responses. Local and systemic effects of CYTOKINES are, thus, intimately involved in the host control of infections ( Fig. 2) (also see chapters A4, A7 and C5). Several recombinant and natural CYTOKINE preparations such as INTERFERONS, granulocyte COLONY-STIMULATING FAC-TOR, and IL-2 are already licensed for use in patients.",

Currently available antiretroviral agents can suppress viral replication and partially reverse cellular immunity defects in HIV patients. Combination antiretroviral drug therapy has been pivotal in the beneficial outcome in many HIV-1 infections and has rekindled a renewed interest in the use of IMMUNOTHERAPY as an adjunct treatment [18, 19] . The ability of IL-2 to induce expansion of the CD4 + T lymphocyte pool has made it the most studied CYTOKINE in the treatment of HIV infection. Initial studies of high-dose IL-2 therapy were reported over a decade ago but were severely limited by toxicity problems. The current approach of decreasing the IL-2 amounts and using intermittent dosing has dramatically increased CD4 + cell counts in HIV-infected persons.A majority of recent combinatory studies in HIV have, thus, been been performed with IL-2 and HAART. Immune-based therapy with IL-2 when used as adjunctive therapy to antiretroviral therapy may further improve immune responses, as demonstrated by an increase in CD4 + T-lymphocyte counts in recent clinical trials [19] . An IL-2 regimen consisting of 5-day cycles administered every 4-8 weeks aims at expanding the CD4 + T lymphocyte pool. Combined antiretroviral treatment in some HIVinfected persons does not lead to a rapid increase in CD4 cell counts. Patients with CD4 cell counts < 200 cells after 9 or more months of combined antiretroviral treatment received IL-2 IMMUNOTHERAPY (4.5 \u00d7 10 6 IU twice daily for 5 days every 6 weeks). After only 3 cycles, their CD4 cell counts increased significantly (mean cell count from 123 cells to 229 cells/mm 3 ).An increase in the naive CD45RA + T CELL subset was noted. IL-2 IMMUNOTHERAPY appears to accelerate the recovery of CD4 + LYMPHOCYTES in persons whose CD 4 + cell counts fail to increase rapidly in response to combined antiretroviral treatment [20] .",

Accumulating evidence suggests that CHEMOKINES have a broad range of functions, including macrophage activation, NEUTROPHIL degranulation, dendritic cell maturation, T CELL activation and B CELL ANTIBODY class switching.Thus, CHEMOKINES can influence both the innate and acquired phases of an immune response. CHEMOKINES can be mediators of angiogenesis and also play important roles in the development of the immune, circulatory and central nervous system. Currently, the chemokine family has expanded to nearly 50 ligands; 16 CXCL,28 CCL,2 XCl and 1 CX3CL CHEMOKINES have been identified. Furthermore, around 18 chemokine receptors, including 6 CXCR, 10 CCR, 1 XCR and 1 CX3CR, have been described (also see Chapter A.4).",

HIV induces T-cell dysfunction and CD8 + T CELL apoptosis, decreasing the number of T-cells that ultimately leads to immunodeficiency. B-cell dysfunction can be caused by HIV and is characterized by hypergammaglobulinemia, polyclonal activation, and absence of specific ANTI-BODY responses. HIV entry into the host cell is mediated through the CD4 receptor and a variety of coreceptors. Chemokine receptors--mainly CCR5 and CXCR4--have been discovered to be necessary for HIV entry [22] [23] [24] [25] .Binding of the HIV-1 envelope glycoprotein gp120 to CD4 and an appropriate chemokine receptor triggers conformational changes facilitating the fusion of the viral and host cell membranes. HIV-1 found in the vagina, rectal mucosa, CNS and in resident MACROPHAGES of many other tissues is mainly CCR-5-dependent. Macrophage-tropic (R5) HIV-1 variants predominantly make use of the CCR5 coreceptors [26, 27] .The T-celltropic (X4) and dualtropic (R5X4) HIV-1 strains, generally associated with the clinical manifestations of AIDS, emerge after a latency of several years, although pathogenesis of the CNS and related symptoms are normally associated to M-tropic (R5) HIV-1 strains. X4 HIV-1 infection augments the expression of CHEMOKINES such as MIP-1\u03b1 (macrophage inflammatory protein) and RANTES (regulated upon activation normal T CELL expressed and secreted).",

Six human \u03b1-DEFENSINS have been described; HD1, 2, 3, and 4 are secreted primarily by granulocytes and certain LYM-PHOCYTES, whereas HD5 and 6 are expressed by intestinal Paneth cells. \u03b2-DEFENSINS are produced in response to microbial infection of mucosal tissue and skin. The unusual circular minidefensins were identified recently in rhesus monkeys. DEFENSINS of vertebrate animals have been reviewed elsewhere [36, 37] . Recent reports have highlighted the anti-HIV-1 activities of DEFENSINS, whose structure and charge resemble portions of the HIV-1 transmembrane envelope glycoprotein gp41. CD8 T LYMPHOCYTES from certain immunologically stable HIV-1-infected individuals secrete soluble factors that suppress HIV-1 replication. CD8 T CELLS from long-term nonprogressors with HIV-1 infection were found to secrete a cluster of proteins identified as \u03b1-DEFENSIN 1, 2, and 3 on the basis of specific ANTIBODY recognition and amino acid sequencing [38] . It is of interest to note that \u03b1-DEFENSINS have been shown to effectively suppress HIV replication in vitro about 10 years ago. In earlier studies, synthetic peptides derived from a region of HIV-1 gp41 exhibited a sequence similar to DEFENSINS. Like DEFENSINS, which can insert themselves into lipid bilayers, gp41 peptides have the ability to associate with liposomes and lymphocyte membranes. An antimicrobial peptide homologous to rhesus monkey circular minidefensins (\u03b4-DEFENSINs) has been prepared by solid-phase peptide synthesis and named \"retrocyclin\" [39] . Retrocyclin has a remarkable ability to inhibit proviral DNA formation and to protect CD4 + LYMPHOCYTES from in vitro infection by both T-tropic and M-tropic strains of HIV-1. Retrocyclin interferes with an early stage of HIV-1 infection and retrocyclin-like agents might be useful topical agents to prevent sexually acquired HIV-1 infections.",

The use of chemokine fusion constructs with gp140, gp120 linked to the extracellular domain of gp41 via a 14amino acid spacer peptide sequence further augmented immunogenicity.This construct elicited antibodies with more effective neutralizing activity than corresponding constructs expressing gp120 [40] . A fusion polypeptide comprising a DEFENSIN and a viral ANTIGEN and its use for producing an immune response in a subject and for treating viral infections, including HIV infection, have been detailed by the US Department of Health & Human Services, National Instistute of Health, Office of Technology Transfer.The viral ANTIGEN may be an HIV ANTIGEN,and the DEFENSIN may be an \u03b1-DEFENSIN or a \u03b2-DEFENSIN. It is interesting to note that the peptides derived from HIV-1 envelope glycoproteins corresponding predominantly to membrane-active domains of gp120 and gp41can exert antimicrobial activity against laboratory strains of Escherichia coli and Listeria monocytogenes. Human \u03b2-DEFENSIN-3 (h\u03b2D-3) and fragments of h\u03b2D-3 for the treatment of various infections, particularly respiratory infections, have been described. The peptides are claimed to be of use in the treatment of infection caused by Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Burkholderia cepacia, other gramnegative and gram-positive bacterial infections and yeast infections. The peptides were synthesized and tested with a range of bacteria such as Enterococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, P. aeruginosa and B. cepacia.",

Several preparations containing bacterial lysates (e.g., Broncho-Munal \u00ae , Luivac \u00ae ) are licensed for use in Europe. There exists a large body of primary literature on placebo-controlled and double-blind clinical trials which have been conducted with these agents.The current concept of the mucosal immune system postulates that stimulation of the gut-associated lymphoid tissue can lead to the induction of a generalized response by the whole mucosal-associated lymphoid tissue. Patients, most often children, having recurrent episodes of infections of the respiratory tract and of the ear, nose and throat have been treated with oral bacterial lysates. In most cases the frequency and the severity of infections was reported to be reduced and both the physician and the patient considered the treatment to be beneficial. It is of interest that many studies have reported a decrease in antibiotic consumption in bacterial lysate-treated patients.A multicenter study with oral bacterial lysate immunomodulator LW 50020 involving 4965 recurrent respiratory tract infection patients in 14 countries in Europe, Latin America, and Asia has recently been conducted. An overall reduction of at least 50% in the number,severity, and duration of respiratory tract infections, the number of antibiotic and symptomatic treatments, and the number of days absent from school or work was reported [47] . Hemodialysis patients suffer from several immune defects which increase their risk of developing bacterial infections, particularly of the respiratory tract. In a double-blind placebo-controlled prospective study,oral IMMUNOTHERAPY with an immunomodulating bacterial extract significantly reduced the number of patients with respiratory tract infections and consequently the number of antibiotic treatment courses [48] .",

The forefront of immunotherapeutics in the coming decades will be on the modulation of the host response against infectious diseases. Selective stimulation of discrete lymphocyte subpopulations important in protective effector mechanisms against a given infection by suitable IMMUNOMODULATORS will play an increasingly important role. Polarized type-1 and type-2 immune responses can be readily achieved, irrespective of the genetic bias of the host and of the nature of the protein ANTIGEN, through the choice of appropriate IMMUNOMODULATORS. The major promise of new IMMUNOMODULATORS lies in their broad activity against diverse microbial pathogens and in a mode of action that is distinctly different from the direct microbicidal action of established antibiotics, antivirals and antifungals.Adjuvant CYTOKINES such as IL-2, IFN-\u03b3, and GM-CSF, can be useful for shortening the duration of treatment. It is now also possible to control the deleterious overproduction of inflammatory CYTOKINES observed in certain disease states with several IMMUNOMODULATORY agents. Activation of innate non-antigen-specific host defenses by recently recognized IMMUNOMODULATORY agents such as CpG DNA will increasingly find a beneficial role in the prevention of infections. It is noteworthy that around 60 biotechnology protein drugs, including recombinant proteins and MONOCLONAL ANTIBODIES, that are currently available represent over a quarter of the drugs introduced worldwide recently. New methodologies currently available have the potential to identify novel targets and foster the development of individually tailored IMMUNOMODULATORY drug treatments. The human genome project has indicated that the human genome contains 30,000-40,000 proteinencoding genes with an estimated 90,000 or more distinct proteins.It would require only a fraction,1 or 2%, of these proteins to be developed as drugs to be able provide hundreds of novel therapeutic agents. IMMUNOMODULATORS are becoming a viable adjunct to established modalities offering a novel approach for the treatment of infectious diseases in the coming decades of the 21st century.",
