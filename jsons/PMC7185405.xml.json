We restricted our search to the English and Chinese languages. Our search identified 45 relevant studies. Previous studies of the prevalence of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) in China (range 2\u201321%) had small sample sizes, did not include a post-bronchodilator test, used outdated data, or were restricted to local, occupational, or urban cohorts. Only one published study in which a post-bronchodilator spirometry examination was done was nationwide, but it was undertaken only in seven provinces or cities of China from 2002 to 2004, and the overall prevalence of COPD was estimated at 8\u00b72%.\nAdded value of this study\nWe did a large nationally representative survey of 66 752 Chinese adults in 2014\u201315. Our study provides up-to-date estimation of the prevalence of COPD in China. We estimated that 13\u00b76% of Chinese adults aged 40 years or older had COPD. A significant difference in the prevalence of COPD was noted between men and women. To our knowledge, our study provides the first direct comparison of COPD prevalence among seven major geographic regions in China within one survey. The prevalence of COPD varied substantially between geographic areas in China\u2014it was highest in southwest China and lowest in central China. According to Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) lung function criteria, 56\u00b74% of individuals with COPD had mild disease (GOLD stage I), 36\u00b73% had moderate disease (GOLD stage II), 6\u00b75% had severe disease (GOLD stage III), and 0\u00b79% had very severe disease (GOLD stage IV). This pattern changed strikingly from the previous nationwide study in China, in which only 24% of patients had mild disease, because we identified more patients diagnosed with mild COPD.\nImplications of all the available evidence\nCOPD has become a major public-health problem in China, and strategies aimed at disease prevention and treatment are needed urgently. The high prevalence of smoking in China suggests that screening for COPD, at least in high-risk populations, could be essential in primary-care units. Avoidance of direct and indirect exposure to tobacco smoke is of primary importance, not only for prevention of COPD but also for reducing the risk of cardiovascular disease, cancer, and diabetes. Intervention strategies could have a pronounced effect on the future trajectory of COPD in China.\n",

Trained staff from local health stations or community clinics administered a comprehensive questionnaire to obtain information on demographic characteristics, medical history, COPD-specific risk factors, and respiratory symptoms. COPD-specific risk factors used in our analyses were indoor exposure to biomass, indoor exposure to coal, and exposure to dust or chemicals in the workplace. We defined indoor exposure to biomass as household use of biomass fuels (including wood, grass, crop residues, and animal dung) for cooking or heating. We defined indoor exposure to coal as household use of coal fuels (including coal, lignite, and kerosene). Measurement of indoor air pollution is complex because of its temporal and spatial distribution within the household and characteristics of the residence's ventilation. Therefore, we used qualitative levels (yes or no) for indoor exposure to biomass or coal in our analyses. We defined exposure to dust or chemicals in the workplace as cumulative exposure to airborne dust or hazardous chemical gases in the workplace (including agricultural operations) for at least 12 months. Airborne dust refers to dirt, sand, powder, mineral dust, flue dust, and smog in the work environment; hazardous chemical gases refer to gases and vapours that are harmful to human beings, including gasoline, pesticides, lampblack, ammonia, sulphur dioxide, carbon monoxide, mercury, benzene, and hydrogen sulphide. We also used qualitative levels (yes or no) for exposure to dust or chemicals in the workplace in our analyses.",

After initial prebronchodilator spirometry, participants who were allergic to salbutamol or had a resting heart rate of 100 bpm or higher were excluded from post-bronchodilator testing. We administered 400 \u03bcg salbutamol (Ventolin; GlaxoSmithKline, Middlesex, UK) to all eligible participants, then post-bronchodilator spirometry was done after 15 min. We measured both prebronchodilator and post-bronchodilator forced vital capacity (FVC), FEV1, forced expiratory volume in 6 s (FEV6), and peak expiratory flow. We did further testing of individuals with a post-bronchodilator FEV1:FVC less than 70%.

We categorised COPD in accordance with GOLD staging criteria: GOLD stage I (mild disease, corresponding to FEV1 \u226580% predicted), GOLD stage II (moderate disease, FEV1 \u226550% to <80% predicted), GOLD stage III (severe disease, FEV1 \u226530% to <50% predicted), and GOLD stage IV (very severe disease, FEV1 <30% predicted). We obtained predicted values of FEV1 for normal lung function and the lower limited normal (LLN) of FEV1 from a nationwide study of reference values for spirometry in the Chinese population.19 Other outcomes of our study were the awareness rate (defined as the proportion of individuals who knew their diagnosis of COPD among all patients with COPD), suspected COPD by spirometry (defined as the proportion of individuals who had undergone spirometry before the survey among all patients with COPD), and treatment rate (defined as the proportion of individuals taking treatments for COPD among all patients with COPD).",

We selected subgroup variables before analyses were done. We calculated standardised prevalence using weighted coefficients to represent the overall Chinese adult population aged 40 years or older. Weighted coefficients accommodated the sampling scheme for unequal probabilities of sample selection and the post-stratification weights, which harmonised the sample structure of the survey with that of the 2010 census of the Chinese population. We categorised every surveillance point into under-developed, intermediately developed, or developed according to the region's gross domestic product per person in 2015. For analyses of COPD severity, we present unweighted estimations because only patients with COPD were included. We used the \u03c72 test to compare prevalence. We calculated p values for trend using the Cochran-Armitage trend test for proportions. We used multivariable logistic regression to assess the association of risk factors with the odds of COPD. We applied four models with progressively increased adjustment of risk factors to assess region-specific odds ratios (ORs) and 95% CIs. We calculated projections using the overall Chinese population aged 40 years and older in 2010 multiplied by the estimated prevalence based on the sampling weight. For sex-specific projections we used sex-specific estimations of the prevalence. All p values were two-tailed and were not adjusted for multiple testing. We judged p values less than 0\u00b705 significant. However, Benjamin and colleagues20 suggested that statistical significance should be redefined (eg, use the threshold of 0\u00b7005 for claims of new discoveries), particularly when the sample size is large. We, therefore, provided exact p values when 0\u00b70001 or larger in all conditions, to help interpretation. We did all statistical analysis with SAS version 9.4 and Stata version 14.1.

Findings suggest use of a fixed ratio might lead to more frequent diagnosis of COPD in the elderly population and less frequent diagnosis in adults younger than 45 years, particularly for mild disease.1 Therefore, we did a sensitivity analysis using a cutoff based on the lower limit of normal (appendix p 12), which gave a prevalence of COPD of 15\u00b70% (95% CI 13\u00b72\u201316\u00b78) in China.",

Specifically, participants in southwest China were reported to have the highest prevalence of COPD (20\u00b72%). The prevalence of current and former smoking and exposure to indoor air pollution from biomass or coal were broadly similar across regions. A higher proportion of individuals exposed to dust or chemicals in the workplace was recorded in the southwest region (appendix p 18). However, the estimated OR for southwest China remained significant after adjustment for these traditional risk factors of COPD, as well as for outdoor air pollution, climate information, and season of the survey (appendix p 19). The southwest region consisted of four provinces and one municipality, including Tibetan participants (appendix p 25). COPD prevalence was highest in Chongqing and Sichuan but relatively low in Tibet, consistent with findings of previous reports in which an inverse correlation between altitude and COPD was noted.18 Thus, reasons for the geographic variation in COPD prevalence are difficult to ascertain from cross-sectional surveillance data. Further investigation is needed to investigate and find the causes.",

Findings of a cluster-randomised controlled trial suggested that a community-based integrated intervention strategy, including systematic health education, intensive and individualised interventions (eg, personalised instructions for smoking cessation, advice for better stoves, and encouragement on adequate excercises), treatment, and rehabilitation, is well-suited for early prevention and management of COPD in China.33 All these intervention strategies could have a pronounced effect on the future trajectory of COPD in China.",

In our study, 112 (1\u00b72%) of 9134 people with COPD were older than 81 years; the predicted value of these patients was, therefore, adopted for those aged 80 years. Second, non-permanent residents were not included in the study because of the sampling design. Moreover, 8355 participants (11% of the total sample) were excluded from the analysis for reasons including non-eligibility for spirometry and the post-bronchodilator test (appendix p 11). Strict rules for spirometry exclude patients with more severe disease for safety reasons, and their exclusion could have affected our estimates. Third, smoking status (and smoking exposure) was self-reported and not validated biochemically using exhaled carbon monoxide or amount of cotinine. Finally, we cannot eliminate the possibility that we misclassified people with asthma and other diseases as having COPD.34 Of 6810 individuals with a post-bronchodilator FEV1:FVC less than 70% who underwent additional chest radiography, 191 (2\u00b78%) had bronchiectasis, 252 (3\u00b77%) had non-active pulmonary tuberculosis, and 37 (0\u00b75%) had lung lesions, indicating the possible overestimation from this perspective.",
