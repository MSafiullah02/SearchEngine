Historically, affected calves suffered from anorexia, diarrhea, abnormal gait, seizures, and death between 3 and 14 days of age. Serum chemistry determinations and measurement of the sodium content of milk replacer and water used on the farm identified salt poisoning as the cause of the clinical signs. The use of high salinity water to mix milk replacer, mixing of oral electrolyte powder directly into liquid feed, adding additional milk replacer powder to the same volume of water for daily cold weather feedings, and limited access to water contributed to the salt poisoning. Morbidity and mortality rates decreased after switching to an entirely whole\u2010milk diet, mixing oral electrolyte powder in water according to label instructions, and providing adlibitum access to normal salinity water.",

            "text": "Sodium imbalances may be caused by dysfunction in either sodium or water regulation. In dairy calves, milk replacer or milk sodium content and water consumption are the major dietary contributors to serum sodium concentration.3 Less common contributors may be high salinity water, oral electrolyte powders, and sodium\u2010containing feed additives or medications such as lasalocid that also might provide a substantial amount of sodium to the calf.4 Inappropriately high concentration of the milk replacer solution, milk replacer mixing errors, lack of access to water, dehydration from disease, or a combination of these factors also can result in hypernatremia.3, 4, 5 Regardless of the cause, hypernatremia causes inhibition of neuronal cell glycolysis and results in central nervous system (CNS) depression.1, 3 Hypernatremia also causes plasma osmolality to increase relative to tissue osmolality. This is particularly important with nervous tissue in which neurons effectively shrink as water is lost to the extracellular space in an attempt to equilibrate the osmotic gradient between the intracellular and extracellular space. A partially protective mechanism occurs with accumulation of amino acids, sugars, and alcohols in neuronal cells in an attempt to balance the intra\u2010 and extracellular osmolality.6, 7 Correcting hypernatremia can be difficult because the animal is predisposed to additional neuronal damage as fluid shifts into the intracellular space creating cellular edema and possible brain herniation through the foramen magnum.1, 3 The current report describes acute and chronic salt toxicity in neonatal dairy calves on a Wisconsin dairy from November 2010 to February 2011 in which abnormally high concentrations of sodium were detected in sera collected from these animals and in the water in which a commercial milk replacer powder was being mixed.",

The farm had lost 90% of its newborn calves in the interim period (approximately 4 months) for a total of 85 calves. Calves that did not die had a tendency to develop diarrhea at 3\u20135 days of age with recovery approximately 14 days later. Abnormal gaits and seizures had occurred in several of the calves. Since the onset of the problem, attempts at treatment included addition of electrolyte powder to the liquid feed, administration of sodium lasalocid to the liquid feed (which already contains lasalocid from the manufacturer) and with multiple antibiotics to no avail. Upon further questioning, it was found that the owner began increasing the amount of milk replacer powder provided to the calves in late fall to provide additional energy during the winter months. Additional history indicated that water quality had been a concern. The depth of the well had been increased and 400 gallons of sodium hypochlorite had been added to the well water supplying the calf barn to improve water quality.",

The only management change at that time was switching the calves to an entirely whole\u2010milk diet. Upon investigation, 3 of 29 calves were showing signs of decreased mentation, base\u2010wide stance, and mild ataxia. Seventeen of 29 (40%) calves had respiratory disease, seven of which had 3 or more signs of respiratory disease (fever, cough, abnormal nasal discharge, ocular discharge, or otitis media) and were under no treatment. Thirteen of 29 (31%) calves had scours. Based upon the history and clinical signs observed, hypernatremia was considered the primary differential diagnosis. Other considerations were meningoencephalitis, lasalocid toxicity, bovine virus diarrhea (BVD) infection, enteric colibacillosis, Salmonellosis or other causes of diarrhea, and associated metabolic derangements or toxemia. Blood samples were collected for measurement of serum electrolyte concentrations from 3 lethargic animals that stood with abnormal extension of the head and neck and were reluctant to move. Fecal samples were obtained for Salmonella enterica culture and acid fast stain for Cryptosporidium spp. from each of 7 untreated calves, five of which had diarrhea at the time of sampling. Two milk replacer samples from the first and last calves fed for each of 6 successive feedings after the farm visit were analyzed for total solids and sodium concentration. Milk replacer total solids were determined by a Brix refractometer1 after construction of a standard curve, with known milk replacer concentrations. Milk replacer sodium concentrations were determined by a VITROS\u00ae 5,1 FS Chemistry System2 after the milk replacer solution was agitated, centrifuged, and an aliquot of the supernatant obtained for analysis. Milk replacer powder3 also was collected, to be mixed with university water for sodium analysis and to serve as quality control standards for total solids calculations by a Brix refractometer. The farm protocol was to mix 10 ounces (283 g) of milk replacer in 2 quarts (1.9 L) of water. Results of analyses are presented in the tables as follows: milk replacer (Table 1) and well water (Table 2). Postmortem reports from 4 calves that died previously were reviewed.",

Lastly, the calves of this report were given approximately 2 mg/kg lasalocid between the liquid medicated suspension and the medicated milk replacer, which is less than reported toxic dosage of 5 mg/kg in neonatal calves.14 Blood, liquid feed, and water analysis confirmed the primary differential diagnosis of severe hypernatremia secondary to high salinity water, lack of water availability, unusually high milk replacer total solids concentration (Table 1), and history of adding additional sodium lasalocid to the milk replacer.",

All conditions associated with hypernatremia reflect hyperosmolality and hypertonicity of the ECF.2 These conditions are caused by a deficit of pure water, such as lack of water access; loss of hypotonic fluid, such as occurs during osmotic diuresis; or gain of sodium, such as during salt poisoning which may result in either relative or absolute dehydration. Hypernatremia caused by the gain of sodium results in expansion of the ECF at the expense of the intracellular fluid (ICF), that is, relative dehydration in an attempt to return plasma osmolality to normal. Hypernatremia because of deficient free\u2010water intake or hypotonic fluid loss is associated with absolute dehydration and reduction in total body water content. Characterization of dehydration is important when determining treatment options. It is likely that the 3 calves tested in this report suffered predominately from relative dehydration because gain of salt was the primary factor predisposing to hypernatremia. Specifically in cattle, the pathogenesis of hypernatremia involves excessive intake of sodium as a result of mixing errors, excessive water loss, or prolonged administration of IV isotonic crystalloids without access to free\u2010choice water.15 Water salinity of 7,100 ppm on this farm contributed 122.4 mEq/L of sodium from water added to the milk replacer powder. Additional sodium from the milk replacer powder (approximately 60 mEq/L), electrolyte powder (3% sodium), and 2 times the recommended lasalocid concentration fed to calves with no access to free\u2010choice water likely contributed to the early onset of clinical signs and death.
