Initial evidences indicated that the masked palm civet (Paguma larvata) was the primary suspect of the animal origin of SARS (Guan et al., 2003; Song et al., 2005) .

SARS-CoV-like viruses were isolated from two species, four out of six masked palm civets and one raccoon dog (Nyctereutes procyonoides).

A retrospective study also indicated that in the animal markets, the prevalence of symptoms of acute upper respiratory infection was significantly higher in individuals with IgG antibody against the SARS-CoV virus 49.28% (34/69) than those who were negative (30.35%, 78/257).

The data indicated that infection with SARS-CoV in traders of animal markets is possibly related to their direct exposure to wild animals, particularly to masked palm civets, and during the period of the SARS epidemic, some of the traders did become infected with the SARS-CoV virus (Xu et al., 2004a) .

In five municipalities (Foshan, Jiangmen, Zhongshan, Guangzhou, and Shenzhen), outbreaks appear to have occurred independently, but the outbreak in Heyuan may be linked to that in Shenzhen and the outbreak in Zhaoqing to that in Guangzhou. It was discovered that two of the seven indexed patients were restaurant chefs; food handlers (i.e., people who handle, kill, or butcher animals) were overrepresented among early-onset cases with no contact history; and patients with early onset were more likely than patients with late onset to live near an agricultural produce market. However, none of the early patients was a commercial farmer nor was living near a farm associated with increased risk.
