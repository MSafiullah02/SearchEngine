            "text": "The complicated multicellular epithelial surfaces of the intestine contain the primary sites of infection for many gastrointestinal (GI) pathogens and the interfaces for interactions with microorganisms (1, 2). However, fundamental knowledge of intestinal epithelial cell (IEC)-pathogen interactions in pigs is limited due to the lack of a reliable in vitro model that recapitulates the complicated intestinal epithelium in vivo. The intestinal epithelium is composed of villi and crypts, and the self-renewing and undifferentiated stem cells in the crypt zone are responsible for the renewal of an entire unit (3, 4). Unlike the classical in vitro models of transformed cancer cell lines, enteroids derived from intestinal crypts contain a stem cell niche and diverse highly polarized intestinal epithelial cell types (enterocytes, goblets, enteroendocrine cells, and Paneth cells); thus, these enteroids well mimic the diverse cellular nature and physiological activity of the intestine in vivo and represent a new in vitro model of infection of the intestinal epithelium by enteric pathogens (5\u20137). Intestinal enteroids maintain the unique characteristics of the tissue from which they are derived and recapitulate many of the biological and physiological properties of the small intestine in vivo (4, 6, 8). As a result, since rodent and human intestinal enteroids were first reported in 2009 and in 2010, respectively, intestinal enteroids have been applied in enteric infection research and have yielded exciting new insights into a variety of aspects of host-virus interactions in the GI tract (4, 7, 9\u201311). However, enteric infection in porcine intestinal enteroids has not yet been reported.",

            "text": "Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV), a member of the alphacoronavirus genus in the family Coronaviridae, is the foremost causative agent of acute diarrhea, dehydration, and high mortality rates in seronegative neonatal piglets, which result in substantial economic losses each year (12, 13). PEDV is highly enteropathogenic, primarily infects the villous epithelia of the small intestine, blunts the affected villi, and disrupts mucosal barrier integrity in vivo (14, 15). The identity of the specific cell types targeted (enterocytes, goblet cells, Paneth cells, microfold cells, tuft cells, or stem cells) by PEDV infection in vivo has remained elusive. However, most in vitro studies of PEDV have been performed in nonporcine cell lines, such as Vero cells from African green monkey kidney and HEK293 cells from human embryonic kidney (16\u201318). Unlike normal mammalian cells, Vero cells are interferon (IFN)-deficient cells that are incapable of producing type I interferons when infected by viruses (19). IPEC-J2 cells, a nontransformed porcine jejunum epithelial cell line from nonsuckling piglets (20), do not mimic the in vivo complicated epithelia, and PEDV clinical isolates generally do not replicate very well in porcine nontransformed epithelial cells such as IPEC-J2 cells (21, 22). The absence of a robust experimental in vitro system that can recapitulate the in vivo PEDV infection process is a bottleneck hampering the investigation of PEDV pathogenesis and the development of novel rational strategies against PEDV infection. Therefore, the development of in vitro models that can closely recapitulate the porcine intestine is crucial for expanding the current knowledge of PEDV pathogenesis and facilitating further biological investigations of host-PEDV interactions.",

Crypts from the duodenum, jejunum, or ileum were freshly isolated as described previously, with slight modification, and were cultured in a semisolid, laminin/collagen-rich Matrigel in proliferation medium to allow their differentiation into three-dimensional (3D) enteroids in 7 to 15 days using previously developed methods (4, 11, 23). After a period of approximately 1 to 2 weeks in Matrigel culture, the intestinal crypt cells proliferated and differentiated into 3D enteroids with a central lumen surrounded by an epithelium containing villus-like structures and budding crypt-like domains, which indicated that the crypt cells from all three small intestine regions could grow into enteroids (Fig. 1A). Because most of the reported enteroid studies have been performed using ileal enteroids, we used ileal enteroids as representative intestinal enteroids and performed most of the experiments of the present study using ileal enteroids. To evaluate whether the differentiated enteroids could be cryopreserved and thawed and whether the resulting thawed cells could differentiate into enteroids, as previously reported, differentiated ileal enteroids were subjected to a freeze-thaw cycle and then differentiated as if they were freshly isolated crypt stem cells. The thawed ileal enteroid single cells grew into enteroids in 7 days (Fig. 1B), and thus, we developed a porcine crypt-derived 3D enteroid culture system.",

We thus sought to develop a porcine planar (two-dimensional [2D]) ileal enteroid culture in microplates, which would make them amenable to efficient infection and would allow deciphering of the complex interplay between viruses and epithelial cells. Previous studies demonstrated that dissociated 3D mouse enteroids can generate planar enteroid monolayers with proper apical and basal polarity that largely recapitulate the many features of 3D enteroids and the in vivo intestinal epithelium (23, 24). The 3D ileal enteroids that were expanded in Matrigel were harvested, mechanically dissociated, and seeded on Matrigel-coated microplates to establish 2D enteroids as described previously (24). After expansion and differentiation, the seeded cells grew out as large, contiguous sheets of epithelium with heterogeneity in terms of cell morphology and densities (Fig. 1C). A large number of villin-positive enterocytes were present on the apical surface and throughout the 2D monolayer (Fig. 1D), indicating the presence of mature enterocytes in the enteroids. Proliferating cells stained with Ki-67 protein and stem cells (Lgr5+) were present throughout the 2D monolayers, which suggested that our 2D enteroids maintain the features of stem cells and contain the transit-amplifying zone. We also identified Paneth (lysozyme C-positive [LYZ+]) cells, goblet (mucin 2-positive [Muc2+]) cells, and enteroendocrine (chromogranin A-positive [CHGA+]) cells in the 2D ileal enteroids (Fig. 1D). Thus, the planar intestinal enteroids generated from budding crypt-like 3D enteroids include multiple cell lineages and recapitulate the various cellular phenotypes of the intestinal epithelium. Moreover, a lumen-like structure was identified in the differentiated planar 2D ileal enteroids (Fig. 1D). Altogether, these results demonstrate that a planar swine enteroid culture can be generated from intestinal crypt stem cells.",

At 48 h postinfection (hpi), the numbers of PEDV genomes were substantially increased to levels 34- to 754-fold higher than their levels at 2 hpi and were correlated with the MOI (Fig. 2A), indicating that PEDV can infect enteroids. It is well established that PEDV primarily infects the small intestine and can infect all three regions (duodenum, jejunum, and ileum) of the small intestine. To assess the potential existence of a disparity in susceptibility to PEDV infection among duodenal, jejunal, and ileal enteroids, we infected the three types of enteroids at the same MOI and monitored the viral replication kinetics. The duodenal, jejunal, and ileal enteroids were all infected by PEDV, and the results showed that the number of PEDV genomes had increased up to 63-fold at 24 hpi compared with the number at 2 hpi and peaked at 48 hpi, indicating successful PEDV replication in all three enteroids. In addition, the enteroids derived from the duodenum, jejunum, and ileum exhibited similar viral replication kinetic levels after PEDV infection (Fig. 2B). PEDV infection in ileal enteroids was further confirmed through an anti-PEDV nucleocapsid immunofluorescence assay (IFA) (Fig. 2C). Successful PEDV infection in ileal enteroids resulted in a significant cytopathic effect and disruption of the enteroid structure starting at 24 hpi, and this structure continued to deteriorate over time (Fig. 2D). These results indicate that PEDV successfully infects enteroids and establishes a productive infection.",

Consistent with data from previous reports, PEDV infection caused severe atrophic enteritis, and PEDV antigen-positive cells were largely located along the sides of villi, suggesting that PEDV successfully infects ileal tissue (Fig. 3B) (27). We also performed double-immunofluorescence staining of the same sample with anti-PEDV spike protein and anti-cell markers (villin, Lgr5, Ki-67, and Muc2) (Fig. 3C). As expected, villin, a marker of mature enterocytes, was present along the apical side of the intestinal villus, and PEDV infection was distributed throughout the villin-positive villi. PEDV infection was primarily located on the tip and waist of villi, and Lgr5-positive cells were primarily concentrated at the bottom crypt area of intestinal villi. We easily identified significant PEDV infection in Lgr5+ cells in the crypt area (Fig. 3C), which indicates that PEDV infects Lgr5+ crypt stem cells, as observed in vitro in enteroids. Unlike Lgr5 staining, which was concentrated in the bottom crypt, Ki-67-positive cells were distributed widely in the proliferative zone of the crypt and reached the waist area of villi (Fig. 3C). PEDV protein was occasionally observed in Ki-67+ proliferating epithelial cells and to a lesser degree in Muc2+ goblet cells (Fig. 3C). These results demonstrate that PEDV is capable of infecting multiple cellular lineages, including enterocytes, stem cells, and goblet cells, as observed in vitro. Thus, intestinal enteroids provide a unique platform for studying the multiple cellular targets of PEDV and the effect of PEDV infection on these various epithelial lineages.",

To recapitulate the segmental discrepancy of PEDV infection observed in vivo, we isolated crypt stem cells from ileal and colonic tissues from the same piglet. The stem cells from both ileal and colonic crypts expanded and differentiated into enteroids and colonoids, respectively (Fig. 1A and 4A), but the rates of intestinal organoid differentiation were not identical. Approximately 7 days were required for the ileal crypt stem cells to differentiate into enteroids, whereas the colonic crypt stem cells required a longer time (approximately 2 weeks) to differentiate into colonoids (Fig. 4A). Consistent with the segmental discrepancy of PEDV infection observed in vivo in the intestine, PEDV infected both ileal enteroids and colonoids but showed restricted infection in colonoids (Fig. 4B). The number of PEDV genome copies in colonoids at 72 hpi was increased only approximately 5-fold compared with that at 2 hpi, whereas the number of PEDV genome copies in ileal enteroids was substantially elevated from 24 to 72 hpi to reach values at 72 h that were 1,527-fold higher than those at 2 hpi. Consistent with the PEDV genome numbers, at 24 to 72 hpi at the same MOIs, ileal enteroids produced up to 44-fold more infectious particles than colonic enteroids (Fig. 4C). The discrepancy in infection between ileal enteroids and colonoids was further confirmed by a PEDV N protein IFA (Fig. 4D), and the results were consistent with the in vivo results: PEDV infection did not cause prominent pathological injury to colonic villi, and only a limited number of PEDV antigen-positive cells was detected in the colonic villi (Fig. 4E). Our results suggest that enteroids retain the internal region-specific identity among intestine segments. These data demonstrate that enteroid systems well mimic the events that occur during PEDV infection in vivo.",

            "text": "Recent studies have shown that PEDV infection inhibits the production of type I and III IFN in IEC lines such as IPEC-J2 (21). To verify whether PEDV infection inhibits the innate IFN responses in enteroids, we monitored the mRNA transcripts of type I IFN (IFN alpha [IFN-\u03b1]) and type III IFN lambda 1 (IFN-L1) by reverse transcriptase quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) in enteroids at various time points after infection with PEDV-JMS. Compared with the mock uninfected control, PEDV-JMS caused a rapid and substantial reduction in the expression of IFN-\u03b1 and IFN-L1 transcripts, as observed at 2 and 12 hpi, and this decrease was followed by the induction of IFN expression after 24 hpi, indicating that PEDV infection inhibits the induction of type I and III IFN at the early stage of infection. However, the IFN-\u03b1 and IFN-L1 expression kinetics were not identical (Fig. 6A and B): IFN-\u03b1 expression peaked at 24 hpi, whereas IFN-L1 expression peaked at 48 hpi. To further verify that PEDV infection suppresses the induction of IFNs, we assessed IFN-L1 production after stimulating PEDV-infected enteroids at 12 hpi with poly(I\u00b7C) for 12 h. Stimulation with poly(I\u00b7C) substantially increased the expression of IFN-L1 in enteroids (Fig. 6C), which suggested that enteroids are capable of efficiently producing IFN-L1. In contrast, PEDV infection for 12 hpi significantly reduced the poly(I\u00b7C)-elicited production of IFN-L1 (Fig. 6C), which suggested that PEDV suppresses IFN production in enteroids. These findings indicate that intestinal enteroids are a suitable ex vivo model for the study of innate immunity in response to PEDV infection.",

To gauge the antiviral activities of type III and I IFNs against virus infection in enteroids, we initially monitored ISG expression in enteroids that had been primed for 24 h with either IFN-L1 or IFN-\u03b1. Both IFN-L1 and IFN-\u03b1 elicited potent expression of interferon-stimulated gene 15 (ISG15) (Fig. 7A), MxA (Fig. 7B), 2\u2032-5\u2032-oligoadenylate synthetase-like protein (OASL) (Fig. 7C), and interferon-induced transmembrane protein 1 (IFITM1) (Fig. 7D) in a dose-dependent manner after stimulation. Consistent with the above-described results for IPEC-J2 cells, IFN-L1 induced significantly higher levels of ISG15, OASL, MxA, and IFITM1 in enteroids than IFN-\u03b1, regardless of the concentrations of IFNs (Fig. 7A to D). In agreement with the ISG expression profiles elicited by IFN-L1 and IFN-\u03b1, both IFN-L1 and IFN-\u03b1 inhibited PEDV infection in enteroids in a dose-dependent manner, although IFN-L1 showed stronger antiviral activity against PEDV than IFN-\u03b1 (Fig. 7E and F). These results demonstrate that IFN-L1 exhibits increased activity on enteroids compared to IFN-\u03b1. In summary, intestinal enteroids present a good in vitro model for evaluating the innate response to PEDV infection.",

Current in vitro cell culture models of PEDV include Vero cells (29), MARC-145 cells (another monkey kidney cell line), HEK293 cells (30), and IPEC-J2 cells (21, 31), and most of these are nonporcine intestinal epithelial cells and thus not the ideal in vitro cellular models for studying the interaction between PEDV infection and the host response due to interspecific variation. Although IPEC-J2 cells are a nontransformed porcine intestinal epithelial cell line, these cells lack the complexity of the cell types found in and the architecture of the intestinal epithelium and thus do not satisfactorily mimic the natural infection process. Intestinal enteroids represent a significant advantage over traditional in vitro models and provide a unique opportunity to explore host-pathogen interactions in an in vitro system that recapitulates the complicated cellularity of the GI tract. Although great progress has been achieved in generating human and mouse intestinal enteroids and using ex vivo systems to better understand the intestinal physiology and pathophysiology of enteric infection, previous studies have not investigated enteric viral infection in enteroids derived from porcine crypt stem cells. Here, we established a porcine enteroid culture system from crypt cells that contains enterocytes, enteroendocrine cells, goblet cells, Paneth cells, and stem cells and found that the proposed system well recapitulates the complex intestinal epithelium in vivo (Fig. 1). The porcine crypt enteroids derived from all three small intestinal regions were found to be permissive to infection by PEDV and provide a unique platform for studying intestinal physiology and a variety of biological aspects of porcine enteric pathogens.",

Previous studies and our results have shown that PEDV largely infects the epithelial cells of the small intestine and occasionally infects colon epithelial cells (Fig. 2 to 4) (27, 32). In fact, we observed differential susceptibilities to PEDV infection between colonoids and ileal enteroids (Fig. 4B to D), indicating that the segment-specific difference is maintained ex vivo in enteroid cultures.

            "text": "Due to their unique features, enteroids better mimic the multiple cell types of the intestinal epithelium in vivo than traditional cell line models. We observed that PEDV was capable of infecting goblet cells and stem cells in addition to the primary cellular target, villous mature enterocytes, in the enteroids, and this finding was confirmed in vivo in the PEDV-infected ileum (Fig. 3C). The intestinal epithelium is a rapidly self-renewing tissue, and the turnover rate for complete renewal is approximately 3 to 5 days (33). The Lgr5+ stem cells in crypts are primarily responsible for replenishing the intestinal epithelium at a high rate of turnover. PEDV infection is cytolytic and causes acute necrosis of the infected enterocytes, leading to marked intestinal villous atrophy (12, 14, 15). Elucidating the effect of PEDV infection on crypt proliferation and differentiation has been a critical challenge. Only two previous reports have shown that PEDV infection causes a substantial increase in the number of Ki-67-positive cells and induces the localization of large numbers of Lgr5+ cells in the crypt niches of the intestine of PEDV-infected pigs (13, 15). A previous study conducted by Jung and Saif showed that the numbers of Lgr5+ cells and the proliferation of crypt cells are associated with piglet age, which is associated with susceptibility to PEDV infection (13). These results indicate that crypt stem cells are involved in the pathogenesis of PEDV infection. However, whether PEDV directly infects Lgr5+ stem cells is unknown. Madson et al. previously visualized PEDV protein at the villus-crypt interface of the distal jejunum and ileum early during the infection process (32). Here, we directly observed PEDV proteins in Lgr5+ cells and Ki-67+ transit-amplifying cells in both ileal enteroids and infected ileal tissue. Enterocytes move on luminal surfaces from the bottom crypt area as they differentiate and mature, but further studies are needed to clarify whether the location and maturity of enterocytes influence the susceptibility of these cells to PEDV infection. In contrast to the previous in vivo study (27), we did not observe a significant increase in the number of Ki-67+ epithelial cells following PEDV infection in enteroids. Other factors might be involved in the increase in the number of Ki-67+ epithelial cells during in vivo PEDV infection, and enteroids provide a good in vitro model to further address this question.",

            "text": "Goblet cells are simple columnar epithelial cells that constitute the primary cellular source of Muc2 mucins (34, 35). Mucins form an intestinal inner mucus layer, which serves as a physical barrier that effectively separates the commensal microbiota from the single epithelial cell layer and plays crucial roles in the maintenance of microbial homeostasis and the protection of epithelial cells from infection (36, 37). Jung et al. previously detected a PEDV antigen in goblet cells and demonstrated that PEDV infection caused a substantial reduction in the number of goblet cells in the small intestine (27, 38). In agreement with the previous in vivo results, we observed that PEDV infected goblet cells of enteroids in vitro. Another porcine alphacoronavirus, transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV), reportedly binds to mucin on the apical membrane of intestinal cells, which allows TGEV to stay longer in the intestine and facilitates intestinal infection (39). However, whether PEDV takes advantage of mucin to facilitate the infection of goblet cells and the effect of PEDV infection on the functions of goblet cells remain unclear. In addition to the secretion of mucins, goblet cells play crucial roles in the presentation of oral antigens to the immune system (34). In the future, it will be very interesting to further explore the effect of PEDV infection on the functions of goblet cells by taking advantage of the enteroid model.",
