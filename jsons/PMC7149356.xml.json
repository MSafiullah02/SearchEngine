Chemically, CNTs constitute pure carbon, where inherent carbon atoms present in a repetitive manner in hexagonal pattern for cylindrical tubes (Bianco et al., 2005). The size of CNTs varies in terms of their length-to-diameter ratio. They are also considered as members of the fullerene family, they differ from each other by the number of carbon atoms (i.e., C20, C30, C36, and C70) and their arrangement. The individual fullerenes are called graphenes. Many describe CNTs as the folded form of graphenes, which are also considered allotropes of carbon. Graphenes are single-layered graphitic sheets with properties identical to nanotubes. CNTs were first discovered accidentally by Ijima (1991) as an allotropic form of carbon by electric arc discharge (EAD) of graphitic materials at high temperature. Led from his discovery, CNTs have been explored for their numerous applications in the area of physical chemistry due to their quasi-one-dimensional property, incredible strength, and fascinating electromechanical properties.",

            "text": "Depending on the structural conformation and shape, CNTs are classified into four major categories: single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs), double-walled carbon nanotubes (DWCNTs), multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs), and functionalized carbon nanotubes (f-CNTs) (Beg et al., 2010). SWCNTs are tube-shaped structures formed from folding graphene sheets, and exist in open or close structures at both the ends. DWCNTs have a double-layer structure containing two sheets of graphene folded upon each other. MWCNTs are formed by folding of 2\u201310 graphenes sheets on each other or by rolling a single graphene sheet to produce a complex multiwalled structure (Mehra et al., 2015). DWCNTs and MWCNTs differ from SWCNTs by an open-end structure on both sides, as depicted in Fig. 4.1\n. SWCNTs have an internal diameter of approximately 1 nm, whereas MWCNTs are having an internal diameter of 5\u201320 nm. Similarly, SWCNTs are insoluble in water and form aggregates soon after sonication, whereas MWCNTs are partially water soluble in nature and form slightly translucent dispersions. The native CNTs or pristine CNTs obtained from synthetic routes are generally water insoluble in nature. Functionalization is a synthetic process whereby requisite functional groups or therapeutic molecules can be tagged on the surface of CNTs. Functionalization imparts high solubility, enhances biocompatibility, and reduces toxicity of CNTs. Accordingly, f-CNTs have higher importance in the area of drug delivery and many more.",

            "text": "Besides pristine nanotubes, several structural variants of CNTs are observed, such as nanohorns, nanotorus, and nanobuds, which are found to have significant applications in drug delivery. Nanohorns are modified forms of SWCNTs, having a single layer cone shape or horn-like structure, closed at one end by a single hexagonal ring of carbon. These are useful in drug delivery due to their unique feature of increase in diameter with increase in length. Accordingly, they are widely employed in targeting drug molecules to malignant cancer cells. Nanobuds are materials with modified structure having a bud-like surface outgrowth, which acts as a reservoir for encapsulation of drug molecules for effective delivery. Nanotori are the ring-shaped structures formed by the folding of single layer sheet of graphene (Purohit et al., 2014). These are theoretically described CNTs bent into a torus or doughnut shape structure. However, the nanotorus has limited importance in drug delivery. Another, structural variant of CNT, coiled nanotubes, are regular or irregularly helical structures formed by the peculiar arrangement of heptagonal and pentagonal rings in the hexagonal backbone structure of nanotubes (Hanus and Harris, 2010). The present review gives an exhaustive account on various types of functionalization of CNTs and applications of functionalized CNTs in drug delivery.\n",

            "text": "The advanced methods for CNTs have now been reported in literature, viz. chemical vapor deposition (CVD), EAD, and laser ablation (LA) methods. Such techniques rely on high frequency electric and laser sources, with fine control on their reactivity with carbon material. Among these, the CVD technique is used as the most sought after technique for the laboratory scale and bulk industrial production of diverse types of CNTs. It produces CNTs by catalysis of carbonaceous materials at very high temperature (700\u00b0C) in a hot furnace (Kumar and Ando, 2010). This technique has an advantage of being economical in nature for bulk production of CNTs. Fig. 4.2\ndepicts the process of synthesis of CNTs using CVD technique. Recent literature instances have shown the utility of several advanced CVD techniques viz. plasma-enhanced CVD, thermal CVD, laser-assisted CVD, and high pressure CVD for effective manufacturing of CNTs (Nessim, 2010). In the EAD technique, the CNTs are prepared by electric discharge of a high voltage beam (100 A) on graphite, used as feed material, as shown pictographically in Fig. 4.3\n. This method has the advantage of producing CNTs of superior quality with very high tensile strength (Sharma et al., 2015). However, in the LA technique the CNTs are produced by hitting a graphitic object with a high-speed laser beam, as shown in Fig. 4.4\n. It produces CNTs of very narrow diameter and suitable for laboratory production of both SWCNTs and MWCNTs (Hornbostel et al., 2006). Lately, other important techniques are being used for industrial and bulk scale production and manufacturing of CNTs, including cobalt-molybdenum catalytic (CoMoCat) process, high pressure carbon monoxide disproportionation technique, fluidized-bed synthesis (Dasgupta et al., 2011, Harris et al., 2008), flame synthesis (Wal et al., 2000), and solar energy\u2013based techniques (Dasgupta et al., 2011).\n",

Such functionalization processes usually involve van der Waal forces and electrostatic interactions. One of the functionalization techniques, i.e., PEGylation, has recently gained immense importance, owing to its enhanced biocompatibility, solubility, and reduced toxicity (Bottini et al., 2011). PEG-functionalized CNTs are most widely used in drug delivery due to their nontoxicity and improved solubility. The increased solubility can be attributed to the hydrophilic segments orientated toward the aqueous phase (Ravelli et al., 2013, Hadidi et al., 2013). Fig. 4.6 depicts the methodology for PEGylation of CNTs. Noncovalent functionalization of pristine CNTs with amphiphilic polymers, such as phospholipid-poly(ethylene glycol), produces CNTs with high aqueous solubility, stability, and enhanced biocompatibility are suitable for drug targeting to cancer cells (Zeineldin et al., 2009).",

Functionalization of MWCNTs block copolymer, Pluronic F127, increased the cellular uptake of the CNTs and enhanced cytotoxicity (Ali-Boucetta et al., 2011). Similarly, noncovalent functionalization of SWCNTs employing amphiphilic diblock copolymer (polyoxyethylene-polycaprolactone) showed enhanced solubility of the CNTs in aqueous media (Park et al., 2007). Functionalization of MWCNTs with an hydrophilic polymer, such as carboxymethyl guar gum, showed higher solubility, enhanced biocompatibility, and superior drug loading ability (Giri et al., 2011).",

CNTs have a tendency to easily penetrate into the cells by crossing the cell membrane and release the attached biomolecules in the nucleus for treatment of gene defects and related disorders (Pantarotto et al., 2004). Polyamidoamine functionalization of MWCNTs can effectively deliver the target gene through cellular trafficking to effectively produce transfection (Liu et al., 2011). Functionalized CNTs show higher affinity toward nucleic acids viz. single-stranded DNA and RNA, and form complexes by electrostatic attraction forces. Surface functionalization of SWCNTs/MWCNTs with ammonium functional groups can easily penetrate into human and murine cells, and helps in the effective delivery of plasmid DNA, which leads to the expression of marker genes. Apart from ammonium functionalization, SWCNTs functionalized with lysine groups can easily penetrate through cellular and nuclear membrane, due to cationic charge present for enhanced delivery of plasmid DNA-nanotube complex (Singh et al., 2005). Noncovalent functionalization of CNTs with single- and double-stranded DNA by nonspecific binding interaction provides enhanced dispersion of hydrophobic CNTs in aqueous media, compared to the pristine CNTs, and better cellular penetration of the CNTs to deliver the DNA (Dieckmann et al., 2003). The enhanced aqueous dispersion of CNTs is due to the interaction of hydrophobic region of the peptide with aromatic rings of the CNTs, while the hydrophilic face promoted self-assembly through peptide-peptide interactions. Functionalization of siRNA molecules on PEG-SWCNTs allows faster cellular entry of siRNA-PEG-SWCNTs complex, owing to higher binding and association with cells by hydrophobic interactions with the cell membrane (Zhang et al., 2006).",

Of late, CNTs have also proved their worth in delivery of biological macromolecules such as proteins, peptides, and oligosaccharides (Baker et al., 2002). Noncovalent functionalization of bio-macromolecules onto the surface of CNTs provides an advantage of enhanced molecular recognition of the bound biomolecules (Bale et al., 2007). Importantly, macromolecular proteins such as fibrinogen, \u03b3-globulin, hemoglobin, and fibronectin have been successfully functionalized with MWCNTs to achieve enhanced biorecognition (Wei et al., 2010). Recently, it has been reported that multifactorial noncovalent functionalization of MWCNTs with arginine-glycine-aspartic acid\u2013serine peptides can produce cell capture, attenuate glycosylation on carcinoma cell surface, and play a significant role in preventing oncogenic transformation, cell differentiation, and cancer metastasis (Xue et al., 2011). Similarly, a functionalization strategy has been described by Liu et al. (2010) for functionalization of arginine-glycine-aspartic acid peptide residues for enhanced delivery of doxorubicin and anti-CXCR4 siRNA to cancer cells (Liu et al., 2009). SWCNTs noncovalently functionalized with peptide 427 undergo specific biding to major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules of antigen presenting cells and induces human CD4 T-cell responses for treatment of Wilm\u2019s tumor (Villa et al., 2011).",

This causes reduction in the length of CNTs, followed by ring opening at both the ends. Furthermore, it generates carboxylic groups at the \u201cend,\u201d on the surface of tips, after the ring opening due to 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition reaction. Consequently, the process is also called carboxyl functionalization, which is used for increasing the dispersibility of CNTs in aqueous solutions (Jain et al., 2011). In the case of SWCNTs, strong acid treatment with reflux causes opening of side caps to produce a hollow cylindrical structure and generation of carboxyl groups at the tips, whereas in MWCNTs, the acid treatment only causes generation of carboxyl group at the end. Long-term treatment of CNTs with strong acid solution causes severe disruption of \u03c0-networks of the CNTs, and results in possible loss of flexibility and electrical and mechanical properties of pristine CNTs (Peng and Cho, 2000). Consequently, alternative approaches such as addition reactions of hydrophilic groups to the CNTs\u2019 external walls and tips can also make them soluble in water. Such types of functionalization are widely employed in drug delivery for therapeutic molecules, such as methotrexate, paclitaxel, doxorubicin, for treatment of diverse types of carcinomas (Karchemski et al., 2012, Pastorin et al., 2006, Lay et al., 2011).\n",

            "text": "It is common in cancer chemotherapy that it tends to destroy the cancer cells along with healthy normal cells, accordingly causing severe side effects. CNTs, in this regard, are helpful in treating cancer cells safely without affecting the colateral tissues. CNTs loaded with chemotherapeutic agents can effectively deliver them to the malignant cells, due to high cellular uptake. The CNTs allow effective delivery of drugs into the tumors cells, owing to their enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect (Fang et al., 2011). Fig. 4.7\ndepicts the approach of EPR effect used by CNTs for traversing through the impregnable blood-tumor barrier. These easily enter into the cell by crossing the cell membrane through disorganized and leaky endothelial junctions on the surface of solid tumors, owing to their small size, which helps in easy retention in the tumor mass (Madani et al., 2011, Rahman et al., 2012). Consequently, nanotubes reduce the dose of drug by localizing its distribution at the tumor site only. This can be further fortified by functionalizing the drug-containing CNTs with an antibody molecule and targeting it to the antigen of cancer cells. Functionalization of SWCNTs with monoclonal antibodies has been employed for targeting drug molecules and diagnostic agents to provide theranostic benefits, i.e., both therapeutic effect and diagnostic imaging (Liang et al., 2016). SWCNTs functionalized with PEG and conjugated with the monoclonal antibodies are able to selectively target the CD20 cell surface receptor present on B-cells, with little nonspecific binding to negative T-cells. This approach has proved to be an alternative way in targeting drug molecules to the cancer cells (\nFig. 4.7\n). Furthermore, the CNTs functionalized with antibodies are also capable of multimodal drug delivery, i.e., delivering more than one type of anticancer drugs to the tumor site. This approach has the advantage of delivering both hydrophilic and lipophilic drugs to the target site. Importantly, the drug molecules and antibodies to be conjugated on the surface of nanotubes must be compatible with each other. The antigenicity of antibodies must also remain unaltered after their attachment with the surface of CNTs (Liang et al., 2016).",

            "text": "Besides drug-targeting ability to malignant tumor cells, CNTs lately also have their own therapeutic properties. CNTs have been reported to exhibit cancer-curing properties, particularly when CNTs are exposed to an infrared light source, they tend to generate heat up to 70\u2013160\u00b0C in very few seconds (<120 s) (Zhou et al., 2009). Consequently, the approach of placing such heated tubes at the tumor site can easily destroy malignant cells. This property of nanotubes makes them a tumoricidal agent. MWCNTs, especially prepared using the CoMoCat process, are of high research importance, owing to their use in cancer chemotherapy for mild tumoricidal action to reduce the size of tumor. Such nanotubes, when placed on the biological object and irradiated with near-infrared light, absorb light radiations of specific wavelength, i.e., 980 nm, and leads to programmed cell death. This approach in cancer chemotherapy is called photothermal therapy (Huang and El-Sayed, 2010). Reports also suggested that short-time exposure of MWCNTs (<2 s) to strong IR radiations (i.e., 700\u20131100 nm) can produce hyperthermia up to 42\u00b0C for 2 h to accelerate the programmed cell death in colorectal carcinoma cells (Huang and El-Sayed, 2010). Furthermore, hyperthermia increases the cellular uptake of anticancer drugs, plausibly due to enhanced cell membrane permeability. Similarly, MWCNTs associated with nitrogen gas have been found to induce thermal ablation causing apoptosis of cancer cells upon irradiation with infrared light source (Torti et al., 2007). The longer the CNT, the more effective would be the therapy, as less time of exposure would be required with minimal dose of radiation due to larger surface area. It can, accordingly, be concluded that the antitumor activity of CNTs might be due to heat transduction, which leads to less cellular cytotoxicity. Above all, it has been observed that functionalization of nucleic acid, i.e., DNA molecules, with MWCNTs provides enhanced tumoricidal action, which leads to death of malignant cells, plausibly owing to increased heat production and transduction. This approach has an advantage over simple radiation/heat therapy to treat human tumors because of the selective tumoricidal action of DNA-encased nanotubes (Zheng et al., 2016).",

CNTs loaded with chemotherapeutic agents have been shown to achieve relatively higher uptake by cancerous tissue without affecting collateral tissues (Ji et al., 2010). Consequently, nanotubes may also be beneficial in dosage reduction by localizing its distribution at the tumor site. This can further be fortified by functionalizing the drug-containing CNTs with an antibody molecule and targeting it to the antigen of cancer cells. Recently, CNTs have been reported to exhibit their own cancer-curing properties as well when exposed to an infrared light source (Zhou et al., 2009).

Alzheimer\u2019s disease, dementia, parkinsonism, mood disorder, AIDS, and meningitis (both viral and bacterial) remain untreated because of restricted entry of therapeutic substances. The blood\u2013brain barrier (BBB), an impregnable barrier is designed for protecting brain from external stimuli such as entry of foreign chemical, toxins, pollutants, drug substances to maintain the brain homeostasis. Drug molecules fail to enter into the brain by crossing the BBB, owing to poor lipophilicity. Similarly, conventional drug delivery systems lack the targeting ability to deliver the drug molecules into the brain (Alam et al., 2010). CNTs, in this regard, have been used for the delivery of drug molecules to the brain primarily because of their ability to cross the BBB (Yang et al., 2010). MWCNTs are effective in delivering neuropharmaceutical agents to brain microglial cells over the SWCNTs. Additionally, CNTs are also useful in treating neurodegenerative disorders due to their magnetic properties. Nanotubes, in combination with nerve growth factors, help in treating the neurological disorders by facilitating differentiation of brain neurons (Alam et al., 2010). As reported, both pristine CNTs and f-CNTs, have positive effects on neuronal growth and these can stimulate the growth of neurons (Spinato et al., 2016). It has been observed that MWCNTs functionalized with DNA and siRNA can internalize into brain microglia cells, i.e., macrophages derived from migratory monocytes, which are believed to be elevated in patients with malignant brain tumors.\n",

CNTs have been widely used for improving gene delivery, owing to their capability of replacement of damaged or missing genes, and transportation of DNA into cells (Bianco, 2004). Synthesis of hybrid structures constituting nanotubes combined with dendrimers by grafting can be helpful in loading nucleic acids for correcting the gene defects, by delivering the loaded cargos into the cells (Pantarotto et al., 2004). Recently, application of CNTs in the form of matrices to support neural growth has been reported elsewhere. Ammonium-functionalized CNTs can be used as vectors for delivering nucleic acids and plasmid DNA for improving the efficacy of gene therapy, in comparison with DNA alone (Prato et al., 2008). Complexation of siRNA with SWCNTs for efficient gene delivery is a newer approach for augmenting gene silencing in genetic diseases. Short interfering RNA and SWCNT complexes can be easily taken up by splenic immune recognizing CD11c+, CD11b+ and Gr-1+CD11b+ cells for faster induction of the immune response after delivering the loaded gene. It has been reported that when single-stranded DNA is tagged onto the surface of SWCNTs, it helps in the protection of DNA probes from possible enzymatic cleavage and interference from nucleic acid\u2013binding proteins (Liu et al., 2007b). Studies have shown that a DNA probe can target a specific mRNA inside living cells when coupled with SWCNTs, which increases its self-deliverability and intracellular biostability, compared to that of the free DNA probes. Consequently, new conjugate systems provide greater potential for applications in the field of genetic engineering.",

Their ability to readily cross the plasma membrane for the transport of cargo molecules renders them as interesting nanovehicles. To achieve a desired response, their cellular internalization needs to be extensively studied. Scientists across the globe have proposed different pathways for their cellular internalization. This internalization by the cell also depends on the physical properties, surface charge, and chemical functionalization of these CNTs. The other parameters influencing its interactions include degree of dispersion and formation of supramolecular complexes (Liu et al., 2007a). Two most commonly understood mechanisms include direct cytoplasmic translocation and receptor-mediated endocytosis. The first pathway acts as a passive diffusion mechanism, where CNTs undergo diffusion across lipid bilayer of the cell membrane to deliver the loaded cargos into the cells (Mu et al., 2009). MWCNTs have been shown to cross cell membranes by means of an energy-dependent process, employing the usage of ATP. Some scientists have also reported that CNTs of approx 100 nm are able to fit into caveolae and clathrin vesicles, while bigger sized CNTs are taken up by means of macro-pinocytosis pathway (Mu et al., 2009).",

Owing to this, CNTs have drawn significant attention by nanotechnologists, from industry as well as academia. In the last two decades, remarkable work has been carried out on CNTs for biomedical applications. Functionalization is a versatile area which has opened newer perspectives in the application of CNTs in advanced drug delivery. Attachment of an organic moiety to nanosized tubes has facilitated their use for diagnostic and targeting purposes, especially in cancer and treatment of infections. Despite their promising role in nanomedicines, CNTs require extensive research investigations to guarantee their safety in clinical setup. Toxicity studies, therefore, are needed for establishing evidence of safety in full scale under in vivo conditions for real time applications and commercialization marketing. Physiological, physicochemical, and molecular processes need to be considered for understanding clinical and preclinical toxicity of CNTs. Regardless of knowledge gained in nanotoxicology, scientists have not yet been able to precisely forecast the biological behavior and biokinetics of CNTs. Furthermore, commercialization of CNTs requires strict regulations that are mandatory, taking into their ambit the environmental, health, and safety issues. However, as alarmingly high numbers of reports are piling up, it can be rationally anticipated that CNTs have a golden future in drug delivery.\n",
