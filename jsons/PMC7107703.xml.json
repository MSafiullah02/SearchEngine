It was not confirmed as a bioterrorism event perpetrated by the cult of Bhagwan Shree Rajneesh until 1 year later when Rajneesh himself confessed.21\u201323 In the absence of the confession, this attack would never have been recognized as bioterrorism.21",

It contains the following 11 nonconclusive criteria: biorisk, biothreat, special aspects, geographic distribution, environmental concentration, epidemic intensity, transmission mode, time, unusually rapid spread, population limitation, and clinical, and two conclusive criteria: identification of the agent as a biological warfare agent and proof of the release of the agent as a biological weapon. Each criterion is given an assessment point ranging from 0 to 3 based on the data and findings collected in the outbreak investigation, multiplied by a weighted factor (a value of 1, 2, or 3). The sum of the nonconclusive criteria were then ranked into four levels of the likelihood that this was an actual event of biological warfare. Based on Grunow\u2013Finke epidemiological assessment tool, the tularemia outbreak in Kosovo was judged as a naturally occurring event. The nonconclusive criteria were widely used in many retrospective case studies to evaluate the potential possibility of bioterrorism, including the anthrax outbreak in the Eastern United States in 1915, the smallpox outbreak in Aralsk in 1971, and the Salmonella outbreak in Oregon in 1984.",

Each component contains more detailed parameters than those used in the Grunow\u2013Finke epidemiological assessment tool. For example, in the component of perpetrator, there are three qualitative criteria: type of perpetrator (government institutions/organizations, terrorist groups, and individuals), sophistication/motivation/ability/capacity, intelligence/secrecy (global and local), and two quantitative ones: number of perpetrators and their distribution. Each criterion is scored with a value of 0 (low probability) or 1 (high probability).

Compared to their first scoring system, in this new method, old criteria were regrouped, and new criteria were added. Each criterion was scored with a score of 0, 1, or not applicable, indicating low probability, high probability, or no data of certain type of outbreak. The total score was compared with four cutoff scores ranging from low probability, possible, high probability, and certain type of outbreak.",

The 11 epidemiological clues to a deliberate epidemic, including the criterion of dead animals, would be sensitive for zoonotic disease detection, but zoonosis-related criteria are absent in other assessment tools, thus the animal data are assumed to be a good parameter to increase sensitivity.36 In terms of correctly classifying natural epidemics, this is not of practical use because public health authorities tend to assume all outbreaks are natural as a default position.8,21 The far greater need is to correctly and with a higher degree of sensitivity, identify unnatural epidemics. For other scoring models, neither sensitivity nor specificity could be accurately assessed from the very limited number of scenarios. However, these models could be tested against historical outbreaks and refined to increase the sensitivity of unnatural epidemic identification.",

To some extent, this means that the likelihood of a bioterrorism event is unrelated to the category (A, B, or C) of the agent. However, an agent with a high score may suggest the high risk of a deliberate attack and priority of bio-preparedness. In terms of prioritization of bioterrorism agents for preparedness, MacIntyre, Seccull, Lane, and Plant,41 developed a scoring method that prioritizes the risk levels of category A agents using 10 disease impact criteria: infectivity of the agent, case fatality rate, stability in the environment and difficulty of decontamination, incidence of disease in worst-case scenario of release, reports of genetic modification to increase virulence, global availability and ease of procurement of the agent, ease of weaponization, historical examples of use or attempted use of this agent, lack of preventability, and lack of treatability of the disease. Each criterion is scored with a score of 0 (no risk), 1 (some/low risk), or 2 (yes/high risk), and the total score is used to rank priority. It shows that anthrax has the highest risk-priority score for preparedness, followed by smallpox, viral hemorrhagic fevers, botulinum toxin, plague, and tularemia.41 These perspectives would be helpful for developing an improved risk-assessment tool in the future. The limitation of our literature review is that we searched the available information from published papers. We may therefore have neglected to include potentially relevant scoring systems that are not yet published or publicly available yet. This is probably the case for systems developed by the military or intelligence communities whose objective is to collect, analyze, and explore information in support of national security, law enforcement, and policymaking.",
