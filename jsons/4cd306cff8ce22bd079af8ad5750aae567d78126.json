Up to March 8, 2020, there have been more than 100000 confirmed cases around the world and more than 3000 medical staff infected by SARS-CoV-2. And there are increasing confirmed cases around multiple countries every day. The transmission dynamics is not fully understood [1] . Establishing an artificial airway is a technique often used in medical activities, either in surgical general anesthesia or in the treatment of critical COVID-19 patients. The airway is the site where the SARS-CoV-2 accumulates most, the priority thing is how to minimize the iatrogenic transmission of the SARS-CoV-2 when perform the intubation. Here we present a protocol to help medical staffs like anesthesiologist, intensive medicine physicians\uff0cemergency physicians and some other related medical staffs to perform tracheal intubation safely and effectively.",

In order to reduce the risk of exposure to SRAS-CoV-2 infections, elective surgery should be postponed as much as possible (for example no recent episodes of gallstone disease, kidney stones, uterine fibroids, cataracts, knee and hip replacement surgery, etc.). 1.2 Establish a full-time intubation team. Generally, there should be 2 to 3 groups of fixed personnel to perform tracheal intubation for suspected or confirmed COVID-19 patients. It is recommended to rotate between groups at regular intervals (usually 14 days of quarantine) to avoid excessive fatigue of medical staff and reduce risk of infection. 1.2.1 Endotracheal intubation in emergency and limited-surgery patients (usually progressive malignancies) Preparation of operating room: Anesthesia and surgery for suspected or confirmed COVID-19 patients should be performed in an isolated negative pressure operating room as far as possible. Patients and medical staff must enter the operating room after the negative pressure system is activated. If there is no negative pressure operating room, you must choose an operating room with special access channels and relatively independent spatial locations. Avoid the central air conditioning and ventilation system during the operation, turn off the purification system during the operation, and perform complete disinfection after the operation. 1.2.2 Preparation of patients and anesthesiologist: Patients enter the operating room to wear medical surgical masks, then remove the patient masks before the intubation until all things are ready\uff0cand try yours best to reduce the direct exposure of the patient's respiratory tract to the operating room. The anesthesiologist strictly implements three levels of protection (including N95 masks, goggles, protective face shield, protective clothing, double surgical gloves, disposable anti-leakage shoe covers). Limit the number of anesthesiologists, in principle, no more than two.",
