Although has different clinical courses, many communicable and infectious diseases can be classified into epidemic febrile disease according to therapies of traditional Chinese medical (TCM) such as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) (Peng, 2003, Shen, 2003, Gu et al., 2005), avian influenza A (H5N1) (Li, 2006, Nie and Lin, 2007), and swine influenza A (H1N1) (Zhou, 2009, Liu, 2009, Zheng et al., 2010). Because of the common feature of high fever, these diseases could be treated with antipyretic prescription according to principle of febrile disease treatment in TCM.",

Herbal medicine is one of the most essential elements of TCM, and Bai-Hu-Tang (or White Tiger Decoction) is a classical natural Chinese herbal formula with a long history of use. The formula originated from the treatise on febrile disease of Shang Han Lun (or Treatise on Cold-Attack) compiled by Zhong-Jing Zhang who lived in Eastern Han Dynasty in China. It was formulated with four herbs of Liquorice, Anemarrhena Rhizome, Gypsum and Rice, and mainly used to reduce fever and promote generation of body fluids (Charles, 2000, Zhu, 2007). It was also useful in treating diabetes mellitus (Chen et al., 2008), eczema, pruritus, some anxiety and emotional disorders (Herb Toxicities and Drug Interactions: A Formula Approach, 2004).The formula has caused wide public concern over the recent years and practiced in many countries (European Herbal and Traditional Medicine Practitioners Association, 2007), and even some international press also published works for user guide (Herb Toxicities and Drug Interactions: A Formula Approach, 2004). Therefore, the BHT is an important traditional Chinese formula that has been extensively used to prevent febrile disease in the world. But there was little basic theory report on its mechanism and effect.",

Some diseases of fever, kidney dysfunction, and liver problem could be attributed to body's response to excessive cytokine production that storm physiology of the body, such as IL-6 and TNF-\u03b1 (Clark, 2007). This virulent immune response with production of large amounts of inflammatory cytokines often was named as immunoinflammatory response, and played the most important role in the pathogenesis of liver damage and dysfunction (Seely and Christou, 2000, Wang and Ma, 2008, Aldridge et al., 2009). The results demonstrated that liver pathological changes were observed significantly in LPS-treated animals, and the serum concentrations of ALT and AST, which were functional readout for liver damage, increased drastically in LPS injection animals, but decreased to normal level with BHT prevention (Fig. 3). These changes were accompanied by changes of inflammatory cytokines, especially sudden change of IL-10 signaling (Fig. 2C). There were no significant changes of other cytokines of IL-2, IL-4, and IFN-\u03b3 (data not shown). This raised the intriguing possibility that excessive production of TNF-\u03b1, IL-6, and IL-10 (Fig. 2), which also caused excessive immune response, may be the direct cause of liver damage, and BHT was able to prevent the pathological process.",

Depending on the combination of cytokines produced in response to the stimulus, innate and adaptive immune responses are initiated. As reported, LPS-induced proliferation of lymphoid cells is thought to be primarily restricted to B cells in acquired immune (Tough et al., 1997), and nearly all B cells require the help of Th cells before they can mature and differentiate into antibody-secreting plasma cells. The conventional T cells played a critical role in tempering the inflammatory response recognized by innate immune system (Kim et al., 2007). In this study, the results of immunoglobulins and T cell subpopulations showed that humoral immunity mediated by B cells was activated by LPS without CD4+ cell (Th cells) increase, but cell immunity carried out by CD8+ cells (Tc cells) was inhibited by LPS. Due to the role of BHT, the CD8+ cell decrease was prevented totally (Fig. 4B), but enhanced humoral immunity was still kept at a high level (Fig. 4C\u2013E). Therefore, BHT did not affect the activated adaptive immunity, but prevented the cell immunity inhibition and excessive cytokines in innate immunity by LPS at the same time.",

            "text": "In addition to cytokines, an important role in innate immunity has been ascribed to TLR family (Lenert, 2006). Different TLR recognizes the different pattern-recognition receptors (PRRs) expressed on the effector cells of immunity system, such as TLR1 recognized lipoproteins, TLR3 recognized double-stranded RNA, and TLR4 recognized LPS (Akira et al., 2006, Kawai and Akira, 2011). Actually, TLRs as main PRRs of immunity system played an important role in linking between rapid defense of innate immunity and delayed eradication of adaptive immunity (Werling and Jungi, 2003, Pasare and Medzhitov, 2004). It was reported that TLR4 played an indispensable role in triggering LPS fever, and the phase of febrile response to LPS depended entirely on the TLR4 (Steiner et al., 2006). Because LPS firstly arrived at liver that is the main LPS-processing and clearance organs after intravenous administration (Li and Blatteis, 2004, it was ponderable to investigate expression of functional genes in liver. The gene expressions of TLR4 studied herein were not affected by BHT (Fig. 5A), but LBP expression was increased (Fig. 5B), which bind and transport LPS to activate cells in the immunity system (Knapp et al., 2006), and inhibiting inflammatory response at higher concentration (Hamann et al., 2005). This indicated that BHT may play an important role in avoiding excessive immunity, and the elevated expression of TLR4 may be beneficial for the initiation of the following adaptive immunity linked by TLR4.",
