            "text": "Electronic cigarettes or e-cigarettes are handheld battery operated devices that heat liquid and deliver an aerosol that simulates smoking. They may also be referred to as electronic nicotine delivery systems (ENDS) in certain literature. In conjunction with the increased use of these devices [1], a health concern has emerged linking the use of e-cigarettes with pulmonary illness [2,3,4]. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) are investigating a multistate outbreak of lung injury associated with the use of e-cigarette or vaping products [5,6]. All of this information is generating widespread debate, which we can be framed as a health scare [7,8] similar to other scares such as the current COVID-19 scare, as well as the H1N1 virus (swine flu), trans fats, Ebola, and the mobile phone usage health scare [9,10]. Health scares can be described as campaigns that attempt to alert the public of a particular substance or activity that can lead to a negative effect on health [11].",

Native Americans would cultivate and smoke tobacco for medicinal and ceremonial purposes. Tobacco eventually spread around other continents and eventually all around the world [12]. Henceforth, it had many thousands of years to become ingrained within human culture and society. In the early years of the 20th Century, cigarette and nicotine marketing through print, television, and radio only helped to boost sales. In recent years, and after the dangers of traditional forms of smoking, e-cigarettes have risen in popularity.",

In today\u2019s digital world, it is possible for consumers and the general public to offer their views and opinions across social media platforms. One of the most open platforms to converse about public health is Twitter, where it is also possible to extract tweets for academic research purposes. Previous research has utilised Twitter to identify public views, key discussions, content, and stakeholders related to health scares [13,14,15]. Twitter can be used to study and understand the context of the current e-cigarette health scare. Twitter is an important platform to study because it has the potential to shape mainstream news because tweets can be embedded in online news stories, as well as highlighted in traditional media (such as TV or radio), amplifying their reach. Health scares need to be studied in the context in which they occur, and one method of studying them is through the use of Twitter [10,16]. This is because Twitter provides citizens with a platform that permits the rapid sharing of public views and opinions and allows these views to become viral and highly shared, regardless of their factual truth; henceforth, this is an important and significant area to study. Moreover, the debate around the safety of e-cigarettes is likely to be of interest to a wide variety of stakeholders.",

Moreover, this is an important topic to study because it aims to build an understanding of how social media may play a role in the global dissemination of amateur and unfounded speculation against accepted medical research. This type of research is increasingly important, as we find medical studies being socially challenged by various social media networks at an increasing rate. We utilised a mix of social network, automated text, and link analysis in order to identify network structures, influential users, the most utilised words, and hashtags. ",

Influential users consisted of CNBC, which had 3.3 million followers, and the news anchor of Columbia Broadcasting System\u2019s (CBS) Nightly Business Report, who had 31.3 thousand followers. The reason for the prominence of CNBC was because they had published an article on October 7th titled \u2018Researchers find e-cigarettes cause lung cancer in mice in first study tying vaping to cancer\u2019. A citizen who tweeted the study and noted the findings of the study for the reason for \u201cnot following trends\u201d received over 400 retweets and 1.8 thousand likes also became influential and had 6.1 thousand followers. The user was characterizing e-cigarettes as a societal trend with dissent towards those who were using e-cigarettes. A user replied to this tweet indicating that the fear around e-cigarettes seemed irrational when traditional e-cigarettes were still being sold. Other influential accounts consisted of The Centres for Disease Control (CDC) with 1.24 million followers who tweeted about cases of lung damage of users of mostly illicit e-cigarettes containing the Tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), and Gregory Conley, with 18.1 thousand followers, who is a tobacco harm-reduction advocate and supporter of e-cigarettes who was tweeting at this time.

            "text": "This study showed the effects of a research study linking cancer in mice to vaping on Twitter. The study was tweeted by several mainstream media outlets and dominated discussions of e-cigarettes on Twitter. The study, however, was questioned by several experts as they noted that the study conducted on mice could not be generalised to humans. Our study highlighted the impact of academic research on Twitter when it is disseminated through the mainstream media. The publication of the study caused great concern over the safety of e-cigarettes on Twitter, and users of the platform were quick to point out that e-cigarettes were still a much safer alternative to traditional smoking. For instance, health authorities such as the National Health Service in the United Kingdom still noted that e-cigarettes contained a fraction of the risk when compared to that of traditional cigarettes [19]. However, the publication of the study linking cancer to mice may have incorrectly been interpreted and understood by some members of the public who would now believe that e-cigarettes were just as unsafe and/or more unsafe when compared to traditional tobacco based cigarettes. Current advice provided by Centers for Disease Control [20,21,22] notes that e-cigarettes are likely to be safer than smoking traditional cigarettes. Our recommendation to health authorities is to offer guidance to the public in order for citizens to make informed decisions about whether e-cigarettes are safe to consume. A key aspect of assessing whether vaping is safe depends on whether an individual is already engaged in using traditional cigarettes and/or rolled tobacco products. However, information disseminated to consumers around the safety of e-cigarettes can be confusing and vague. Moreover, we found that Twitter users tended to be unsure about the safety of e-cigarettes. Henceforth, based on a review of the literature and the advice provided by the Centers for Disease Control, the National Health Service (NHS), and Cancer Research UK [20,21,22], we developed a flowchart, as shown in Figure 3, that could be utilised by consumers and medical professionals when making a decision about whether e-cigarettes are likely to be safe or unsafe based on their circumstances.

Social media may be a source of information for a subset of the population, and it is important to analyse this information from a public health surveillance perspective. Our findings can also be contrasted with previous empirical work in this area. A study published in 2018 [23] conducted an analysis of e-cigarette discussions on Twitter from 2012 to 2015, which examined the reasons for using such devices. The study found that one of the most popular reasons for using e-cigarettes was to quit traditional cigarettes, and Twitter users were positive towards e-cigarette devices. Moreover, they found that 43% of Twitter users were able to give up traditional cigarettes, which demonstrated the potential of e-cigarettes for smoking cessation. The findings of this study were similar to our present study, which also found that there was a sizeable \u201cpro-vaping\u201d community on Twitter. A further study [24] published in 2014 looked at a specific case study containing tweets for and against public health policy related to the Chicago Department of Public Health. This study also found pro- and anti-e-cigarette views such as that they promote smoking cessation, but also that they are harmful and foster nicotine addiction. A further study in the United Kingdom [25] surveyed 3538 current and 579 recent smokers in November and December 2012. It was also found that there were mixed views among the public about whether e-cigarettes were more or less harmful than traditional cigarettes, with a number of citizens unsure of their safety at the time. These results further highlight the need for easy-to-understand guidance for consumers, and our flowchart developed above will be of interest to health authorities.",
