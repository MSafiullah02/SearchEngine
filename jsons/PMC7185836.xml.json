            "text": "Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever (CCHF) is a fatal viral infection described in parts of Africa, Asia, eastern Europe, and the middle east.1, 2 The virus belongs to the genus Nairovirus in the Bunyaviridae family and causes severe diseases in human beings, with a reported mortality rate of 3\u201330%.2, 3 The geographic range of CCHF virus is the most extensive one among the medically important tickborne viruses (figure 1\n). Human beings become infected through tick bites, by contact with a patient with CCHF during the acute phase of infection, or by contact with blood or tissues from viraemic livestock.4 The clinical features show common dramatic progression characterised by haemorrhage, myalgia, and fever, with some differences among different regions suggested but not well studied. Treatment with ribavirin has not yet been approved in many countries. However, there are reports that indicate the drug may be beneficial. The widespread geographic distribution of CCHF virus, its ability to produce severe human disease with high mortality rates, and fears about its intentional use as a bioterrorism agent5 make the virus an important human pathogen. Moreover, ecological complexity of vectorborne diseases, therapeutic controversy, and human-to-human transmission of a zoonotic infection make CCHF an interesting topic for research.",

The signs were presence of blood in the urine, rectum, gums, vomitus, sputum, and abdominal cavity.1 The arthropod that caused the disease was said to be tough, small, related to a louse or tick, and normally parasitising a black bird. In the modern era, Crimean haemorrhagic fever was first described as a clinical entity in 1944\u201345, when about 200 Soviet military personnel were infected while assisting peasants in Crimea in the wake of World War 2.1, 2 The virus was isolated from blood and tissues of patients using intracerebral inoculation of newborn white mice in 1967.1, 2 The virus responsible for Crimean haemorrhagic fever was later shown to be antigenically indistinguishable from Congo virus, isolated in 1956 from a febrile patient in Belgian Congo (present day Democratic Republic of the Congo).10 The common antigenic structure among Eurasian Crimean haemorrhagic fever strains11 and Asian12 and African strains of Congo virus9, 13, 14 led to the virus being called Crimean haemorrhagic fever-Congo virus,15 and then Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever virus.1\n",

When Soviet troops reoccupied the hilly Crimean steppes in 1944, hares had become excessively abundant and neglected pastures were overgrown with weeds, and the first outbreak of the modern era was documented.1 Interestingly, a similar explanation was suggested for the outbreak in Turkey:75 the fields in the affected region had been abandoned from hunting and pasturing between 1995 and 2001 because of terrorist activities in the region; in this period, the numbers of small mammals (eg, hares) and wild animals (eg, boars) increased. After 2001, the fields became available again for hunting and pasturing, and cattle and sheep were exposed to virus-carrying ticks.",
