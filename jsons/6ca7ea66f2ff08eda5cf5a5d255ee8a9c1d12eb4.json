The use of next-generation sequencing (NGS) techniques has led to a rapid increase in the number of viruses described in reptiles. Additionally, transmission studies proving the role of specific viruses in disease processes have been carried out for a number of viral infections in various reptile species. Despite many advances, the factors involved in the development of viral disease in reptiles are, in many cases, unclear. Both host and viral factors are involved. Environmental factors, particularly temperature, have long been known to influence the immune system of reptiles. Increasing evidence suggests that other factors can play an important role in the outcome of viral infections in reptiles, including various pollutants and other infectious agents. Concurrent infections with several infectious agents, including multiple viruses, may occur, and the interactions and effects of these concurrent infections are not yet understood. This makes clinical evaluation of individual test results difficult and reinforces the need to consider multiple pathogens and critically evaluate results in these individual cases. It is critical to differentiate between infection and clinical disease caused by true viral pathogens in our reptile patients.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "30"}, {"text": "Many different methods are available for the diagnosis of viral infections in reptiles.

These were first described based on histological changes in Pacific pond turtles (Actinemys (Clemmys) marmorata), painted turtles (Chrysemys picta), and map turtles (Graptemys spp.). Clinical signs reported in affected animals include lethargy, anorexia, and subcutaneous edema. Characteristic necropsy findings include hepatomegaly and pulmonary edema. Areas of hepatic necrosis with the presence of intranuclear inclusion bodies in hepatocytes were reported. Inclusions have also been demonstrated in the spleen, lungs, kidneys, and pancreas. [44] [45] [46] More recent descriptions have included data on the genomes of the viruses detected. In all cases the detected viruses have clustered with other chelonian alphaherpesviruses. In one case in a captive freshwater turtle (Pseudemys concinna concinna) the animal died with no previous clinical signs. Histologic examination showed hepatic lipidosis with intranuclear inclusion bodies in hepatocytes. 47 A similar virus was also found in a northern map turtle (Graptemys geographica). The turtle had shown weakness and nasal discharge prior to death. Postmortem examination showed pneumonia, as well as hepatocellular and splenic necrosis, all associated with intranuclear inclusion bodies. 48 In a study screening wild bog turtles (Glyptemys muhlenbergii), wood turtles (G. insculpta), and spotted turtles (Clemmy guttata) in the northeastern United States, three different HVs were detected; 51.5% of the bog turtles sampled were HV positive. None of the animals in that study were clinically ill. 49 Herpesviruses have also been described in box turtles in the United States in association with stomatitis and papillomas. 50, 51 A single report is available of an HV infection in an Australian sideneck turtle, a captive Krefft's river turtle (Emydura macquarii krefftii). The animal showed ulcerative lesions of the skin and shell, and histopathology showed orthokeratotic hyperkeratosis with intranuclear inclusions in keratinocytes. 52 A single report also exists of an HV infection in African sideneck turtles (West African mud turtles [Pelusios castaneus]. The animals were imported into Germany from a farm in West Africa.

There is evidence that ranaviruses can be transmitted to reptiles by several different routes, including direct contact between animals, contact with contaminated water or pond sediment, and ingestion of infectious material, for example, from dead amphibians.

Ranaviruses also grow well in cell culture and can be grown on a wide range of cell lines from reptiles, fish, mammals, and birds if the cells are kept at appropriate temperatures (below 32\u00b0C). Samples for the detection of ranaviruses in chelonians should include liver and gastrointestinal tract. Spleen and kidney may also be virus positive. 67 In a transmission study viral DNA was detected in oral and cloacal swabs from intramuscularly infected red-eared sliders as early as 5 days postinoculation (p.i.) and until 26 days p.i. or until the animals died or were euthanized. 67 Oral and cloacal swabs and blood have all been used to detect ranavirus in naturally infected chelonians. 78, 79 Samples for ranavirus detection in squamates should include liver tissue and skin.

Typical eosinophilic to amphophilic intracytoplasmic inclusions in hematoxylin and eosin-stained tissue sections can be found in various tissues.

The etiology of IBD was long unknown, and various viruses have been proposed as possible causes of this disease over time. 119, 120 Reptarenaviruses are now believed to be the cause of IBD. [167] [168] [169] In the first study describing the detection of these viruses, genetically variable arenaviruses were detected in 6 of 8 tested IBD-positive snakes and in none of 18 IBD-negative snakes by metagenomics and RT-PCR. 167 The inclusions are made up of a unique protein (inclusion body disease protein, IBDP), which appears to correspond to the reptarenaviral nucleoprotein. 167, 168 IBD was originally most commonly detected in Burmese pythons but is now most commonly diagnosed in boa constrictors. 105 Anecdotally, pythons tend to develop clinical diseases more quickly, while boas may remain inclusion-body positive but clinically healthy (or low morbidity, chronically diseased) for extended periods of time. The host range of IBD also includes the green anaconda (Eunectes murinus), yellow anaconda (Eunectes notaeus), rainbow boa (Epicrates cenchria), Haitian boa (Chilabothrus [Epicrates] striatus), Madagascan boa (Acrantophis madagascariensis), annulated tree boa (Corallus annulatus), Indian rock python, reticulated python (Malayopython [Python] reticulatus), ball python, and carpet python. 167, 170 Similar inclusions have also been reported in palm vipers (Bothriechis marchi) and an eastern king snake (Lampropeltis getula), 105, 171 although it is not known if these were caused by the same virus.

Both snakes showed signs of gastrointestinal disease. An adenolike virus was also found in the duodenum and spleen of the boa constrictor, while parvo-, adeno-, and herpeslike viruses were detected in the duodenum of the Aesculapian snake. 109 Picornalike viruses have been detected repeatedly by isolation in cell culture in a number of different tortoise species (Marschang et al, Proc ARAV, 2002, p 102).
