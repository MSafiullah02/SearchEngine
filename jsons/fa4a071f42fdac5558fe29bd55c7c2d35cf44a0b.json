We propose a detailed model of the topology of the contact network under various control regimes and demonstrate that this is sufficient to capture the salient dynamical characteristics and to inform decisions. Our model of city-level transmission of an infectious agent (SEIR model) characterises spread via a (a) scale-free contact network (no control); (b) a random graph (elimination of mass gatherings; and (c) small world lattice (partial to full lockdown -\"social\" distancing). This model exhibits good agreement between simulation and data from the 2020 pandemic spread of COVID-19. Also, estimates of the relevant rate parameters of the SEIR model are obtained and we demonstrate the robustness of our model predictions under uncertainty of those estimates. Finally, the social context and utility of this work is identified.",

However, the differential equations depend on good estimates of underlying rate parameters and provide a continuous solution under the assumption that the population is well-mixed and homogeneous (i.e. all individuals have equal contact with all others). Under these assumptions disease propagation is driven by the infamous parameter R 0 -the ratio of the rate of new infections to the rate of removal of infectious individuals from the transmission pool.

Commonly, the agent is either modelling the spread of information or infection. When one is restricted to the spread of infectious agents on a network (in the context of epidemiology, a contact graph) several interesting features arise. In particular, if that contact graph arXiv:2004.10396v2 [q-bio.PE] 23 Apr 2020 is a scale free network (i.e. it has a power-law degree distribution), then the criterion on the key epidemic threshold to ensure control of the outbreak (for the SIS model) becomes R 0 = 0. 7 In effect, what happens is that the power-law distribution of the scale-free network ensures that there is finite probability of the epidemic reaching an individual with an arbitrary large number of contacts. The number of secondary infections arising from that individual will be unbounded and transmission is guaranteed to persist. Of course, in the realworld nothing is unbounded and Fu and co-workers 8 showed that a piece-wise linear/constant infectivity was enough to ensure a positive epidemic threshold.",

Small and Tse 10 introduced a complex network based model of propagation and showed good agreement between simulations of that model and available case data. We found that epidemic parameters widely quoted in the literature were only consistent with observed case data when including significant nosocomial transmission. 11 Finally, and most importantly for the current discussion, the scale-free topology of the model we proposed explained super-spreader events through contact rather than requiring pathologically highly infectious individuals. 12 Unlike what we will propose in this current communication, this model was topologically stationary. [10] [11] [12] The model assumed a lattice with long-range (i.e. small-world) connections following a power-law degree distribution. In those papers 10-12 time varying control strategy was reflected only in changes of the rate parameters. The current coronovirus outbreak (that is, COVID-19) poses a different and unique challenge. Since February 2020 (and up to the time of writing) global transport networks and daily movement of individuals have been disrupted on a global scale. Entire cities and countries have engaged in various levels of \"lockdown\". We argue that it is not appropriate to model this simply by modifying the rate of transmission or rate of removal. In the current work we propose a network switching model through which the topology of the network changes to reflect varying control strategy.",

We do not wish to dwell on the epidemiological appropriateness of these parametersexcept to say that the were chosen by hand because they were consistent with our understanding of epidemiology and also gave results that looked good and coincided with the available time series data. Some brief notes on the effect of parameter selection are in order. First, varying I Th will delay the transition to a \"controlled\" regime and produce a larger peak. The parameter q is largely determined by the epidemiology of the infection, and for coronavirus COVID-19 fairly well established. It does have an important influence on the time delay of the system, but that is not evident from Fig. 1 . Second, the parameters p and r for t < t * also determine the initial rate of spreadas standard epidemiology would expect. Third, the value of these parameters for t > t * determine the length of the \"tail\". In all simulations these parameters are chosen so that a well mixed population would sustain endemic infection. It is the network structure, not fudging of these parameters that causes extinction of the infection -this will be further illustrated in Fig. 2 . Figure 1 depicts one ensemble of simulations. Of note from Fig. 1 is the complete infection of the population without control. Conversely, the random Erd\u00f6s-Renyi graph L(1) has a sufficiently narrow degree distribution that the infection does (slowly) die away. Various values of L(s) with s \u2208 (0, 1) have the expected effect of gradually decreasing the total extent and duration of the outbreak. However, it is important to note that the 90% confidence windows are very wide and overlap almost entirely -while, on average smaller s is better this is very often not evident from individual simulations. This is due to random variation in the initial spread for t < t * : one must be both lucky and clever.",

Otherwise, the mean behaviour indicates infection growth by two orders of magnitude within 300 days -almost complete penetration. Our simulations indicate that this first becomes a risk as the containment is less than 90% effective.

When applied to data from the global outbreak of COVID-19 in 2019/2020, the model closely matches observed data across population centres. Nonetheless, identical simulations with new initial conditions yield vastly different outcomes. The variance of our model predictions is large, and in fact much larger than the variance observed between distinct epidemiological parameter values. Our results indicate that particular simulations of models that claim to have predictive power within that prediction envelope may be prone to over-interpretation. Finally, despite modelling a complex systems with complex networks we have demonstrated the sufficiency of a minimal model. Models with large numbers of parameters which are fitted to time series data are unnecessary and likely to be unreliable and misrepresent the underlying dynamical process. This does not preclude the construction of more complex models when sound epidemiological reasoning dictates it is necessary and when informed with direct evidence to allow for quantitative estimation of the relevant parameters.",
