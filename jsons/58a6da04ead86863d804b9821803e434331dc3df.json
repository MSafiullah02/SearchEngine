Airway epithelial response to viral infection is release of various cytokines such as interleukin-6 (IL-6), tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1), granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (CSF), and granulocyte-macrophage-CSF (GM-CSF).

[13] In vitro studies done on endotoxemia due to lipopolysaccharide, i.e., outer membrane of Gram-negative bacteria, known for inducing cytokine storm due to cytokine activation through aberrant pathway, leading to sepsis, were reduced by nicotinamide supplementation in a dose-dependent manner. [14] A systematic review of such supplementation suggested that Vitamin B deficiency may weaken host immune response; they should be supplemented to the virus-infected patients to enhance their immune system. Therefore, B vitamins could be chosen as a basic option for the treatment of COVID-19. [15] This systematic review also suggested role of Vitamin B3 (nicotinamide) as of potential use. Vitamin B3 treatment significantly inhibited neutrophil infiltration into lungs and produced strong anti-inflammatory effect during ventilatorinduced lung injury (VILI). [15] In one study done on mice, nicotinamide was associated with hypoxemia in VILI, but even they mentioned that neutrophil-induced lung injury was reduced due to niacin supplementation. [16] ",

Hence, nicotinamide, which is the first PARP inhibitor, has activity against PARP-1, PARP-2 can be used as PARP inhibitor. [21] The body's niacin requirement is met not only by nicotinic acid and nicotinamide present in the diet but also by conversion from the dietary protein-containing tryptophan. The relative contribution of tryptophan is estimated as follows: 60 mg of tryptophan = 1 mg of niacin = 1 mg of niacin equivalents. [22] Nicotinamide recommended daily allowance is 0.3 mg/kg/day as recommended daily allowance. However, the dose needed for PARP inhibition is between 300 and 500 mg/kg. It is a very high dose of nicotinamide. Adverse effects of nicotinamide are rare and have occurred mainly with high oral doses (\u22656g/day), which include nausea, vomiting, liver toxicity, headache, fatigue, and dizziness.
