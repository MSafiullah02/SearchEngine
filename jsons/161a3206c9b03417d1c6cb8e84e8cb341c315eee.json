The pneumonia spread quickly to other provinces of China and overseas. At early stage, it was reported that most patients had the contact history with Huanan seafood market [1] [2] [3] . After that, more and more patients had fever and cough symptoms. On 7 January 2020, a novel coronavirus was identified in the throat swab sample of one patient by the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), and was subsequently named as 2019nCoV by World Health Organization (WHO) [1, 2] . As the situation got worse, the WHO declared the outbreak as the public health emergency of international concern (PHEIC) [4] . On 11 February 2020, the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses renamed the virus as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronaviruse-2(SARS-CoV-2) [5] . And WHO announced the epidemic disease caused by SARS-CoV-2 as coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) [6] . This is the third coronavirus pneumonia in the past 20 years around the world. In November 2002, a novel betacoronavirus called severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) emerged in Guangdong, China, and resulted in more than 8000 infections and 774 deaths in 37 countries. In 2012, Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), which was first detected in Saudi Arabia, affected 2494 individuals and caused 858 fatalities [7, 8] . After the outbreak of COVID-19, the Chinese government has initiated a level-1 public health response to prevent the spread of the disease on 26 January 2020 [9] .

In fact, current evidence supports this idea. As for the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2, it contains two regions, S1 subunit and S2 subunit, which consists of 1253 amino acids [20] . The amino acid identity of spike protein between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV was about 75% [21, 22] . Generally, S1 domain is linked to receptor binding; S2 domain is linked to cell membrane fusion. Similar to SARS-CoV, S1 contains the N-terminal domain (NTD) and a receptor-binding domain (RBD) which contains core domain and external subdomain (ESD). S2 contains three functional domains, fusion peptide (FP), and heptad repeat (HR) 1 and 2 (Fig. 1) . Whether SARS-CoV-2 can combine with host cells or not is determined by the affinity between the viral RBD and ACE2 of human cells [22] . Once RBD binds to the receptor, the S2 changes conformation to facilitate the membrane fusion by three functional domains. Although SARS-CoV is not the closest to SARS-CoV-2 at the wholegenome level, the RBD of SARS-CoV-2 is closer to that of [7, 12, 15, [17] [18] [19] . ORF = open reading frame (orange). Structural proteins including S, E, M, N (blue) (S = spike, E = envelope, M = membrane, N = nucleocapsid). Accessory proteins including 3, 3a, 3b, 6, 7, 8, 9a, 9b, 10b, 13, 14 (purple). SP = signal peptide. S1 = subunit 1. S2 = subunit 2. NTD = N-terminal domain. RBD = receptor binding domain. ESD = external subdomain. FP = fusion peptide. HR1 = heptad repeat 1. HR2 = heptad repeat 2. TM = transmembrane domain. CP = cytoplasmic domain. The length of genes is not drawn in scale SARS-CoV, and 72-74.9% amino acid sequences of RBD in both are identical [7, 19, 23] . Several critical residues in SARS-CoV-2 RBD have good interactions with human ACE2. Most residues of RBD interacting with ACE2 are fully conserved [22, 24] . As for function domains of S2, there is no difference between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV except some non-critical amino acids in HR1 region [22] . Another strong piece of evidence supporting ACE2 as a receptor of cells is that HR1 and HR2 domain of SARS-CoV-2 can fuse with each other to form 6-HB following SARS-CoV's fusion mechanism [25] . Despite this, several studies speculated SARS-CoV-2 has less affinity with ACE2 than SARS-CoV [20, 21, 26] . On the contrary, Chen et al. [23] reported SARS-CoV-2 provided a stronger interaction with ACE2 than SARS-CoV by structure analysis of the receptor binding of SARS-CoV-2. By elucidating cryo-EM structure of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, Wrapp et al. [27] also found that compared with SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 bound to ACE2 with 10-to 20fold higher affinity. In order to identify the suppose of entering cellular by ACE2, Peng et al. [28] found that SARS-CoV-2 was able to use ACE2 protein of many kinds of cells, including human cells, as an entry receptor in the ACE2-expressing cells, but not cells without ACE2. It also could not use aminopeptidase N and dipeptidyl peptidase which are other coronaviruses' receptors. In most recent studies, the results provided direct evidence to support ACE2 as the receptor. Yan et al. [29] reported the ACE2-B 0 AT1 (a neutral amino acid transporter) complex can combine with two spike proteins by structural modeling in a structure analysis of fulllength human ACE2, and the extracellular peptidase domain (PD) of ACE2 has the direct interaction with polar residues of RBD [29, 30] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 364, "end": 368, "text": "[20]", "ref_id": "BIBREF19"}, {"start": 458, "end": 462, "text": "[21,", "ref_id": "BIBREF20"}, {"start": 463, "end": 466, "text": "22]", "ref_id": "BIBREF21"}, {"start": 951, "end": 955, "text": "[22]", "ref_id": "BIBREF21"}, {"start": 1201, "end": 1204, "text": "[7,", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}, {"start": 1205, "end": 1208, "text": "12,", "ref_id": "BIBREF11"}, {"start": 1209, "end": 1212, "text": "15,", "ref_id": "BIBREF14"}, {"start": 1213, "end": 1217, "text": "[17]", "ref_id": "BIBREF16"}, {"start": 1218, "end": 1222, "text": "[18]", "ref_id": "BIBREF17"}, {"start": 1223, "end": 1227, "text": "[19]", "ref_id": "BIBREF18"}, {"start": 1820, "end": 1823, "text": "[7,", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}, {"start": 1824, "end": 1827, "text": "19,", "ref_id": "BIBREF18"}, {"start": 1828, "end": 1831, "text": "23]", "ref_id": "BIBREF22"}, {"start": 1981, "end": 1985, "text": "[22,", "ref_id": "BIBREF21"}, {"start": 1986, "end": 1989, "text": "24]", "ref_id": "BIBREF23"}, {"start": 2129, "end": 2133, "text": "[22]", "ref_id": "BIBREF21"}, {"start": 2325, "end": 2329, "text": "[25]", "ref_id": "BIBREF24"}, {"start": 2426, "end": 2430, "text": "[20,", "ref_id": "BIBREF19"}, {"start": 2431, "end": 2434, "text": "21,", "ref_id": "BIBREF20"}, {"start": 2435, "end": 2438, "text": "26]", "ref_id": "BIBREF25"}, {"start": 2470, "end": 2474, "text": "[23]", "ref_id": "BIBREF22"}, {"start": 2687, "end": 2691, "text": "[27]", "ref_id": "BIBREF26"}, {"start": 2867, "end": 2871, "text": "[28]", "ref_id": "BIBREF27"}, {"start": 3260, "end": 3264, "text": "[29]", "ref_id": "BIBREF28"}, {"start": 3549, "end": 3553, "text": "[29,", "ref_id": "BIBREF28"}, {"start": 3554, "end": 3557, "text": "30]", "ref_id": "BIBREF29"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 810, "end": 818, "text": "(Fig. 1)", "ref_id": "FIGREF0"}], "section": "Introductions"}, {"text": "Overall, there is sufficient evidence to support that SARS-CoV-2 infects cells by using the human ACE2.

It is currently speculated that the outbreak of COVID-19 in Wuhan is associated with wild animals. According to WHO, the environmental samples taken from Huanan seafood market were tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 [21] , but the specific animals associated with the virus have not been identified. Based on previous evidence, the bats, the host of more than 30 coronaviruses [32] , may be the origin of COVID-19. The bats are the natural reservoir of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, and spread to human through the palm civets and dromedary camels, respectively [8] . The RaTG13, which is a short RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) region from a bat coronavirus, was closest to SARS-CoV-2 with 96.2-98.7% identity in whole-genome sequence [11, 15, 16, 28] . The other two bat-derived SARS-like coronaviruses, bat-SL-CoVZXC21 and bat-SL-CoVZC45, were closer to SARS-CoV-2 than SARS-CoVand MERS-CoV, which have approximately 88% nucleotide identity [7, [15] [16] [17] [18] . As for the intermediate hosts of SARS-CoV-2, recent studies suggested pangolins were the most probable animal. Two sub-lineages of SARS-CoV-2 were found in organs of pangolins obtained from anti-smuggling activities in Guangdong and Guangxi Province of China by metagenomic sequence [33] . Xiao et al. [34] reported the SARS-CoV-2 was derived from the reorganization of pangolin-CoV-like virus and a Bat-CoV-RaTG13-like virus. However, the pangolin may not be the only intermediate reservoir, because SARS-CoV-2 was not originated from pangolin-CoV-like virus directly, which was demonstrated by the molecular and phylogenetic analyses in Liu's study [35] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 178, "end": 181, "text": "[1,", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}, {"start": 182, "end": 184, "text": "2,", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}, {"start": 185, "end": 188, "text": "31]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 403, "end": 407, "text": "[21]", "ref_id": "BIBREF20"}, {"start": 564, "end": 568, "text": "[32]", "ref_id": "BIBREF30"}, {"start": 742, "end": 745, "text": "[8]", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}, {"start": 920, "end": 924, "text": "[11,", "ref_id": "BIBREF10"}, {"start": 925, "end": 928, "text": "15,", "ref_id": "BIBREF14"}, {"start": 929, "end": 932, "text": "16,", "ref_id": "BIBREF15"}, {"start": 933, "end": 936, "text": "28]", "ref_id": "BIBREF27"}, {"start": 1128, "end": 1131, "text": "[7,", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}, {"start": 1132, "end": 1136, "text": "[15]", "ref_id": "BIBREF14"}, {"start": 1137, "end": 1141, "text": "[16]", "ref_id": "BIBREF15"}, {"start": 1142, "end": 1146, "text": "[17]", "ref_id": "BIBREF16"}, {"start": 1147, "end": 1151, "text": "[18]", "ref_id": "BIBREF17"}, {"start": 1437, "end": 1441, "text": "[33]", "ref_id": "BIBREF31"}, {"start": 1456, "end": 1460, "text": "[34]", "ref_id": "BIBREF32"}, {"start": 1805, "end": 1809, "text": "[35]", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Epidemiology of COVID-19"}, {"text": "To sum up, the bats are the most probable original reservoir based on the current evidence.

The different values of estimated R0 can attribute to different data and different modeling methods [53] . Liu et al. [53] came to conclusion that the average of estimate R0 was 3.28 with a median of 2.79 by an analysis of 12 studies. So, around 2-3 is indeed a reliable range, suggesting the potential of sustained human-to-human transmission [50, 53] . Additionally, so many factors can affect the value of R0, including estimation period, utilized models, and datasets [54] . As various aspects of measures have taken effect, the estimated R0 is mutable. As David said, it is impossible to know what will happen so early in this SARS-CoV-2 epidemic [37] . The initial R0 estimation for SARS-CoV was more than 2.0, but the predicted large outbreak did not occur [8, 37] . It is also notable that asymptomatic patients can also be a source of infection [43, 48] . The super communicator is worthy of notice, who can infect more than 100 individuals [52] .
