Generally, H7N2, H7N3, H9N2, and H10N7 are low pathogenic avian influenza A viruses (LPAIVs) that are usually associated with mild disease in poultry. It has been reported that human infections with these LPAIVs cause upper respiratory tract illness varying from mild (conjunctivitis or uncomplicated influenza-like illness) to moderate in severity. Whereas, highly pathogenic avian influenza viruses (HPAIVs) can cause severe illness and high mortality in poultry. Most human infections with HPAIVs result in conjunctivitis or uncomplicated influenza illness, except for the H5N1 subtype (which is associated with >50% mortality [10]) and the H7N7 subtype (which caused one death during an outbreak in the Netherlands [9]). The recent H7N9 outbreak represents the first time ever that this LPAIV has infected humans and caused disease. Herein, we review the characteristics of this novel avian influenza virus and the disease that it causes, from the perspectives of epidemiology, clinical features, immunology, receptor binding, drug resistance, and vaccine development.",

Direct evidence was revealed by an infection case in Jiangsu Province, China, where a female butcher was infected, and a phylogenetically related H7N9 virus was isolated from a chicken cage 1 m away [5\u2022]. Thus, there was an urgent call to control exposure at poultry farms and LPMs [12, 13], as many LPMs are still open or have re-opened after a short closure. A recent ecological study has assured the effectiveness of the closure of LPMs since April 2013 [14].",

Our most recent work [16\u2022, 17] demonstrates that within the first H7N9 influenza infection wave, a total of 27 genotypes were observed, with diverse internal genes from varied H9N2 lineages but conserved HA and NA genes. Because the H7N9 viruses originated from poultry through genetic reassortment, it is not a surprise that the H7N9 virus could easily reassort with poultry H9N2 viruses (Figure 1). Current studies suggest that none of the H7N9 virus genotypes has gained an overwhelming fitness advantage and that they are still undergoing dynamic reassortment within poultry H9N2 gene pools [16\u2022, 17]. Whether a \u2018super\u2019 reassortant fitting the mammalian hosts would appear is unpredictable because genetic reassortment often has major effects on influenza virus replication within cells. Therefore, extensive surveillance and control of poultry production and transportation is an urgent priority.",

The concentrations of several cytokines/chemokines, including MIP-1\u03b2, IL-6, and IL-8, are even higher than those of previously reported H5N1 infection cases [23]. Furthermore, the hypercytokinemia is correlated with disease severity for H7N9 infection. Higher levels of IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, and MIP-1\u03b2 are detected in fatal cases compared to survivors from H7N9 infections [24\u2022]. Our data indicated that plasma levels of angiotensin II are correlated with disease severity and predict fatal outcomes in H7N9-infected patients [25\u2022]. A recent study elucidated that the human single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rs12252-C, which is associated with dysfunctional interferon induced transmembrane protein-3 (IFITM3), plays a crucial genetic role in early hypercytokinemia development in H7N9-infected patients [24\u2022]. Despite this progress, it remains important to profile the sequential connections of these cytokines/chemokines and clarify the key factors in the infection process, particularly in the local mucosal tissues of the lungs of H7N9 patients.",

Furthermore, a study of human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-typed healthy subjects demonstrates that seasonal influenza virus-specific T-cells poorly cross-react to individual H7N9 variant epitopes, apart from the recognition of the whole virus [30]. It is also indicated that cross-CD8+ T-cell immunity to the H7N9 influenza A virus varies across different ethnic groups based on the HLA background [31]. Thus, further investigations into the features of the H7N9-specific T-cell responses in patients and a comparison of CD8+ and CD4+ T-cell-related immunogenic variance of H7N9 to other currently circulating influenza viruses, for example, 2009 pH1N1, should be performed.",

In the beginning of the H7N9 outbreak, A/Anhui/1/2013 (Anhui-H7N9) and A/Shanghai/1/2013 (Shanghai-H7N9) viruses were two of the earliest strains. Shanghai-H7N9 preferentially binds to the avian receptor analog, whereas Anhui-H7N9 recognizes both avian and human receptor analogs. In contrast to the H5N1 influenza [40, 41], the human-signature substitution Q226L is not solely responsible for binding of the H7N9 influenza virus HA to the human receptor. Rather, other amino acids around the receptor binding site (RBS) are also very important. Four residues (S138A, G186V, T221P, and Q226L) in the RBS that differ between Shanghai-H7N9 and Anhui-H7N9 are able to create a larger hydrophobic region on the left side of the RBS of Anhui-H7N9, which allows Anhui-H7N9 to easily bind the human receptor analog [39\u2022\u2022].",

Specifically, N9 in A/Shanghai/1/2013 contains K294, while residue 294 in A/Anhui/1/2013 is an Arg. Residue 294 is one of the three key arginines at the active site (the other two are R118 and R371) that directly interacts with the substrate/inhibitor carboxylate [44]. The decreased interaction between K294 and the inhibitor carboxylate group plays an essential role in reducing drug sensitivity (Figure 3\n). Furthermore, K294 has an effect on the rotation of the E276 side chain, which is in an unfavorable position to accommodate the oseltamivir hydrophobic pentyloxy group, thereby significantly reducing oseltamivir sensitivity. However, in vitro assays demonstrate that R294K impairs NA activity, which is not advantageous for virus replication [43\u2022]. This is good news for the treatment of the H7N9-infected patients.",

One vaccine containing recombinant Newcastle disease virus expressing HA from H7N3 and two live attenuated vaccines with H7N3 and H7N7 were investigated for their cross-reactivity with the H7N9 virus in May 2013 [45, 46, 47]. Subsequently, universal DNA vaccines based on antibodies targeting the HA stalk region were examined as a possible candidate to prevent H7N9 infection. The H3 stalk-based vaccine is able to elicit antibodies reactive with H7 proteins and also protects mice from H7N9 challenge. In addition, insect cell-derived VLPs containing HA and NA from H7N9 display promising protection in mice against H7N9 [50, 51]. Indeed, shortly after these animal experiments, enrolment of 284 adults was initiated for a phase 1 clinical trial of a monovalent VLP (H7N9) vaccine candidate with and without adjuvant [52]. The clinical trial suggests that VLPs in the presence of adjuvant induce an immune response at a low dosage. Recent data also indicates that antigen preparations from divergent H7 strains are able to induce protective immunity against H7N9 infection [53]. All of these efforts to develop effective H7N9 influenza vaccines with traditional or new techniques are attempting to shorten production cycles and meet the manufacturing requirements for rapid deployment.",

On the basis of the most recent data [54\u2022], the total direct medical cost of H7N9 as of May 31, 2013 is 16 422 535 CNY (2 627 606 USD). For the mean cost of each patient, the cost per day increase correspondingly as the severity of the illness increases. The total cost of disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) is 17 356 561 CNY (2 777 050 USD). Further, the poultry industry losses amount to 7.75 billion CNY (1.24 billion USD) in 10 affected provinces in China and 3.68 billion CNY (0.59 billion USD) in eight non-affected adjacent provinces. The huge poultry industry losses resulted from LPM closings and poultry culling in some areas. Compared to the poultry-industry losses, direct medical losses and DALY losses have been relatively small. Closure of LPMs reduced the mean daily number of infections by 99% in Shanghai and Hangzhou and by 97% in Huzhou and Nanjing based on a Bayesian statistical model for the time series of the onset of illness [14]. However, the medical costs per case are extremely high (particularly for addressing the use of modern medical devices). A cost-effectiveness assessment for disease intervention has yet to be determined.",

Epidemical and genetic analysis illustrates the novel reassortment events that apparently facilitate the transmission from poultry to humans (the so called \u2018host jump\u2019). This was facilitated by the unconventional features of the HA receptor binding pocket. Further, the preliminary understanding of the clinical manifestations and the immunopathogenetic properties of H7N9 infections indicates a complicated interaction between the virus and host. Knowledge gained regarding this novel avian virus may help to pave a way to rapidly conquer it, including approaches to develop an efficient and safe vaccine. However, considering the continuing and unexpected emergence of human infections by novel avian influenza viruses (for example, H6N1 and H10N8) [55, 56], it is necessary to devote more attention to surveillance for interspecies transmission of influenza viruses and toward the development of universal vaccines.",
