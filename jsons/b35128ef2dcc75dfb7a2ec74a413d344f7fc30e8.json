Using data of World Health Organization's situation reports (until situation report 55), an objective analysis was realized to answer this important question. Fulfillment of Benford's law (first digit law) is a rapid tool to suggest good data quality. Results suggest that China had an acceptable quality in its epidemiological surveillance system. Furthermore, more detailed and complete analyses could complement the evaluation of the Chinese surveillance system.",

One of its functions is to provide data with quality that serve to make decisions based on evidence. 1 Unfortunately, it is not easy to know the quality of data during public health emergencies of international concern such as the COVID-19 pandemic. During the influenza A(H1N1) pandemic, Benford's law was proposed as an objective and fast way to assess the performance of surveillance systems during epidemics. 2 Its usefulness was also evidenced in the dengue epidemic in Paraguay (2009-2011) 3 and the Zika epidemic in American countries. 4 Benford's law, 5 also called \"law of the first digits,\" \"Newcomb-Benford law,\" or \"law of anomalous numbers,\" states that for a determined set of numbers, those whose first digit is 1 will appear more frequently (30.103%) than those beginning with other digits, following in order from 2 to 9 (17.609%, 12.494%, 9.691%, 7.918%, 6.695%, 5.799%, 5.115%, and 4.576%, respectively). 6 A very good explanation of Benford's law is the following:",

This must be understood in a pandemic context, and being the country where it originated. In these circumstances, it is highly probable that the reported data are underestimated in great magnitudes, as presented in recent publications. 11 It is frequent in these contexts that only most severe cases are reported. With well-designed population studies, the numerator and denominator of the proportions of the actual occurrence of the infection will be better known. Previous experiences such as Lassa fever in Africa suggests that infections with initial high fatality diminish the severity with widespread epidemiological studies. 12 However, this evaluation did not incorporate all the elements of the health system involved in the management of the current COVID-19 pandemic. A comprehensive evaluation of the Chinese surveillance system should add to the data quality, characteristics of simplicity, flexibility, acceptability, sensitivity, positive predictive value, representativeness, timeliness, and stability. 1 However, this rapid evaluation serves to provide feedback to officials of the Chinese surveillance system. This type of ongoing evaluation is possible in other countries, and it will allow officials in charge to make relevant decisions to improve epidemiological surveillance systems and the response of health care services.",
