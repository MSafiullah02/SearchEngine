            "text": "Priapism is defined as persistent penile erection in the absence of sexual stimulation. This erectile disorder is uncommon in domestic animals and results from the engorgement of the corpus cavernosum while the corpus spongiosum is less turgid than in a normal erection (Rochat 2001). Erectile tissue engorgement can either be the consequence of an increase in arterial blood flow or of a reduction in venous drainage (Bivalacqua and Burnett 2006). The aetiologies of this condition are various. Arterial overflow of the penis occurs when a traumatic event produces an arterial\u2013cavernosal shunt; in man, venous outflow occlusion can follow haematological disorders, prostatic diseases, spinal cord trauma, use of pharmacological agents such as heparin and phenothiazines, or it can be idiopathic (Rochat 2001). In the veterinary literature other reported causes of priapism are spinal cord lesions associated with distemper, complications of castration and lower urinary tract diseases (Rochat 2001).",

(b) Moderate to severe pyogranulomatous infiltrate in the submucosal layer of the penis. HE stain. Original magnification, 600\u00d7. (c) FCoV antigen expressed within necrotic-proliferative foci detectable in the penis. Immunohistochemistry, anti-FCoV antibody, ABC method; chromogen = diaminobenzidine (DAB); counterstain: Mayer's haematoxylin. Original magnification, 250\u00d7. (d) Higher magnification of a pyogranulomatous lesion in which viral antigen is immunohistochemically detectable within macrophages and, to a lesser extent, as a granular positivity scattered among cellular infiltrates. Immunohistochemistry, anti-FCoV antibody, ABC method; chromogen: DAB; counterstain: Mayer's haematoxylin. Original magnification, 400\u00d7.",
