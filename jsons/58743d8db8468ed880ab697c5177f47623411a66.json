Currently, patients are diagnosed by Reverse Transcription Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) from nasopharyngeal or throat swab. 1,2 However, widespread testing is still not readily accessible despite the acceptance that it is critical to rapidly and accurately test individuals to control a pandemic. [3] [4] [5] Further, a major disadvantage of current tests include lack of sensitivity, which results in a 10-30% false negative rate. [6] [7] [8] The shortage of adequate testing has pushed researchers to study complementary options including antibody testing and computed tomography (CT). [9] [10] [11] Notably, recent studies have shown that CT can be used to diagnose COVID-19 and that this can be more sensitive than RT-PCR testing. 10, 11 CT as a testing platform is further beneficial as chemical contaminations which caused shortages of RT-PCR testing are not problems and there is an existing infrastructure for CT in almost every hospital. However, using CT for active screening and diagnosis is currently complicated by the absence of guidelines for detecting COVID-19, which can appear identical to many pulmonary conditions. 6, [12] [13] [14] CT imaging combined with an artificial intelligence (AI) system capable of not only diagnosing * COVID-19 but also doing so with few false positives has the potential to improve clinical response and patient outcome. Recent publications have proposed AI classifiers for COVID-19 diagnosis; however, these tools provide little understanding of how decisions were made, which makes confirming the diagnosis as challenging of a process as diagnosing a patient in the first place. Further, these tools are limited in their ability to differentiate COVID-19 from phenotypically similar diseases. [15] [16] [17] [18] Central to the diagnostic process are ground-glass opacities (GGOs), the radiological finding that indicates the presence of not only COVID-19 but also many similar diseases. 6, [12] [13] [14] While it is * While we often discuss \"diagnosis,\" the tool here developed can be used for screening and/or complementing other techniques, including radiologists' examination; as such, the results in this work should be considered for a broad range of applications and deployments.

Further, our study is limited in basing diagnoses solely from radiological findings from chest CT scans. A recent report showed findings of uncharacteristic COVID-19 positive patients whose CT scans showed no GGOs. 14 While these findings were limited, such patients may be inaccurately classified by our model. Finally, while the pathology of DQ features has been generally accepted, 12 there may be highly irregular cases of COVID-19 that present with such phenotypes. In these events, the decision tree logic would incorrectly assign the patient as COVID-19 negative, although such cases are likely to be isolated.",
