            "text": "Like other betacoronaviruses, SARS-CoV-2 encodes four major structural proteins: spike (S), membrane (M), nucleocapsid (N) and envelope (E). SARS-CoV E protein is abundant in infected cells and plays a crucial role in viral particle assembly. Moreover, the E proteins of SARS coronaviruses likely have important roles in pathogenesis by manipulating a number of cellular processes. Thus, SARS-CoV-2 E protein could also be a critical virulence factor. Ectopic expression of SARS-CoV E was reported to trigger apoptotic cell death of T lymphocytes, which could potentially contribute to the lymphopenia observed in fatal cases, though a causal association is unproven. A potential mechanism for inducing apoptosis was reported to involve an interaction between a putative Bcl-2 homology 3 (BH3)-like motif in SARS-CoV E and the antiapoptotic host protein Bcl-xL. Here we provide the first computational evidence indicating that both the SARS-CoV E and SARS-CoV-2 E have a C-terminal BH3-like motif. We used available sequence data for SARS-CoV-2 and related coronaviruses combined with structural information to evaluate the structure to biological activity relationships of the SARS-CoV-2 E BH3-like motif. Our analysis reveals a predicted interactome for E that is extensively wired to the Bcl-2 apoptotic switch that could potentially be a therapeutic target. Last, network reconstruction identified both the BH3-binding protein Bcl-xL and the autophagy effector Beclin 1, another BH3-containing protein, as vulnerable nodes in the host cellular defense system against SARS-CoV-2.

This protein is abundant in infected cells where it plays a crucial role in virus particle assembly, and appears to have multiple effects on membranes (12) (13) (14) . Compared to wild-type controls, recombinant coronaviruses lacking the E gene have significantly lower viral titers and reduced virus maturation and propagation (15) (16) (17) . E-deficient SARS-CoV is also severely attenuated in vivo, exhibiting diminished pathogenic effects (7, 18) and inability to replicate in the central nervous system (7) , suggesting that the E protein may act as an important virulence factor in coronaviruses.",

This PDZ-binding motif (PBM) in SARS-CoV E is one of many types of small amino acid sequence elements that mediate protein-protein interactions (PPI), and are collectively referred to as short linear motifs (SLiMs). Like many other SLiMs, the PBM found in SARS-CoV E is present at the C-terminus within an intrinsically disordered region (20) . Through its PBM, SARS-CoV E was shown to engage in interactions with the globular PDZ domains of multiple host proteins such as syntenin and PALS1, and these latter interactions may contribute to airway inflammation and permeability of the lung epithelial barrier (18, 19) . Several interesting host proteins were recently reported to bind the E protein of COVID-19 virus SARS-CoV-2 using mass-spec pull-down, including bromodomain proteins involved in immune responses and targeted by other viruses (21) .",

The fact that Beclin-1 interacts with many protein partners in the host interactome suggests that it is a hub. In PPI networks, hubbottleneck proteins tend to be essential, often disease-contributing proteins (54, 55) that represent preferential targets in virus infections (56) . Coronaviruses (including SARS-CoV) were recently reported to target Beclin 1 through their papain-like proteases to induce autophagy (57), thereby reducing downstream innate immune signalling. If SARS-CoV-2 also exploits the Beclin 1 hub, possibly through Bcl-xL targeting by E consistent with our analysis, this could contribute to pathogenicity by inhibiting antiviral innate immunity and concomitantly facilitate virus replication (58, 59) . In support to this, molecular actors implicated in autophagy and interferon type I response appear to aggregate in local interactome neighborhoods (Fig. 7, left) topologically connected to the SARS-CoV-2 network through Bcl-xL (Fig. 7, right) . It is tempting to speculate that SARS-CoV-2 may exploit both types of BH3s, cellular and viral (based on linear motif mimicry) (27, 28, 60) , to modulate host immune responses.",

SARS-CoV-2 shares high sequence homology with SARS-CoV and causes coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), leading to pneumonia and severe acute respiratory distress syndrome.

            "text": "34). Mutagenesis of positions Leu51, Val56 and Val58 in the BH3 was reported to abrogate the ability of SARS-CoV E to interact with Bcl-xL(8). The influence of the other residues present in the CoV E BH3like motifs (including the highly conserved Asn48 located three residues upstream of Leu51) on protein stability, subcellular targeting, function and interaction is unknown and awaits further characterization.To predict structure-activity relationship, we constructed a structural model of the new virus SARS-CoV-2 E guided by the homologous structure of SARS-CoV E (PDB code: 5X29)(11). In both the experimental structure for SARS-CoV E (Fig. 5A) and the derived structural model for SARS-CoV-2 E (Fig. 5B), the position of Leu51 is in a loop between two helices whereas the highly conserved Pro54 residue is located at the beginning of the C-terminal \u03b1-helix. Thus, despite a proline at this position, the BH3-like motif of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 E has intrinsic propensity for helix formation, like classical BH3s. Note that only four positions are different between full-length SARS-CoV E and SARS-CoV-2 E: two within the BH3-like helix (Thr55 and Val56 in SARS-CoV E, Ser55and Phe56 in SARS-CoV-2) and two in a site immediately N-terminal to the PBM (where a pair of residues formed by Glu69 and Gly70 in SARS-CoV E is found instead of a single Arg69 residue in SARS-CoV-2 E). Except for Tyr57 (which contacts Leu28 located in the TM segment of the following chain), the BH3-like region (in red) appears to be only marginally involved in the inter-chain interactions needed to form the protein homopentamer (11), implying alternative roles for the BH3-like motif. Rather, the external orientation, and extended (i.e. irregular) structure of the BH3-like regions in the homopentamer (35) makes the CoV E BH3-like segment highly prone to serve as a small binding interface able to engage in transient interactions with protein partners, consistent",

In addition to shortening the transmembrane domain, which may affect subcellular localization (e.g. by enhancing retention in the Golgi (38)), this deletion could potentially interfere with the binding properties of the SARS-CoV-2 E BH3-like motif by introducing local conformational rearrangements.Last, our analysis of the SARS-CoV-2 interactome using the VirHostNet 2.0 interology webservice (39)(Fig. 6) revealed that the predicted SARS-CoV-2 network appears to be wired to the Bcl-2 apoptotic switch by the nonstructural protein NS7a and by protein E.Interestingly, in this interactome, NS7a contacts the five major anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 proteins (Bcl-xL/BCL2L1, BCL2, BCL-w/BCL2L2, MCL-1 and Bfl-1/BCL2A1) (40), suggesting that this protein might act as a universal modulator of prosurvival Bcl-2 family proteins during infection. Because many viruses have evolved strategies to interfere with apoptosis (41), experimental evidence is needed to establish if the E protein from SARS-CoV-2 directly or indirectly targets prosurvival Bcl-2 homologs to modulate cell viability.Contradictory results have been reported regarding CoV E ability to induce or repress apoptosis(8,42,43). Overexpressed epitope-tagged SARS-CoV E was found to promote apoptotic cell death in the Jurkat T cell line(8), similar to 17Cl-1 cells infected with the mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) (murine coronavirus)(42). Interestingly, although apoptosis of SARS-CoV-2-infected T cells has not yet been established (44), lymphocytopenia seems to be a common feature of COVID-19 patients(45). In contrast, cells infected by a coronavirus lacking E (SARS-CoV\u0394E) were more primed for apoptosis than those infected with the wt strain(43). This latter study also suggested that CoV E may have an anti-apoptotic function by suppressing the unfolded protein response (UPR), likely as a survival mechanism important for virus dissemination(46). It may well be that CoV E activity could protect cells from cell death at early stages post-infection by regulating the UPR, and induce apoptosis at a later stage via Bcl-xL sequestration at the Golgi (8) or through its viroporin activity(10,11).Yang et al. (8)  demonstrated that the interaction of SARS-CoV E with Bcl-xL is mediated by the BH3-like region of SARS-CoV E and the BH3 motif of Bcl-xL. Anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 proteins normally accommodate the BH3 motif from typical BH3-only proteins in a hydrophobic receptor cleft partly formed by their own BH3 region(29)(30)(31)(32). Hence, it remains to be determined whether SARS-CoV-2 E BH3 can bind in the hydrophobic groove of Bcl-xL or at another, distinct interface. It might also be interesting to assess the ability of BH3-mimetics like ABT-737, which tightly binds to the hydrophobic BH3-binding groove of Bcl-xL(47), to inhibit binding of SARS-CoV-2 E to Bcl-xL. Bcl-xL and other family members also has other functions",

Considering the importance of Bcl-2 homologs and BH3containing proteins in pathophysiological settings, the relevance of this interaction and its extrapolation from SARS-CoV to the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 may be revealing about the pathogenesis of COVID-19. In particular, detailed structural characterization and the identification of small molecule drugs able to disrupt this interaction could therefore provide a targeted therapeutic approach where coronavirus treatments are currently lacking or reliant on convalescent sera(62). Recombinant SARS-CoV-2 deleted or mutated in the BH3-like region of E might also prove valuable for the design of a live, attenuated vaccine, with an E protein sufficiently intact to maintain structural integrity necessary for the virus life cycle, but mutated enough to abolish protein-protein interactions involved in viral pathogenicity.

Asterisks in the consensus line indicate positions that are fully conserved. Colons indicate positions that have strongly similar residues and dots are assigned to weakly similar positions.",
