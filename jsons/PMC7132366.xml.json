Previous study showed that Gram-negative bacterial LPS induces myocardial protection [2]. Specifically, pretreatment with LPS for 24 h reduces myocardial I/R injury in mice [2]. This effect is not unique to LPS, since lipoteichoic acid, a cell wall component of Gram-positive bacteria, also reduces infarct size when administered to rats 8\u201324 h before myocardial ischemia [3]. Recently, Izuishi et al [4] reported that preconditioning with HMGB1 also could protect against hepatic I/R injury. However, whether preconditioning with HMGB1 could provide a cardioprotection during myocardial I/R remains unknown.",

HMGB1 has been identified as a new proinflammatory cytokine and as late mediator of inflammation, sepsis, acute lung injury, severe acute respiratory syndrome, autoimmune disease and etc., and which has been found to play a pivotal role in the pathogenesis of the above inflammatory disorders [5], [6]. Recently, HMGB1 has been found that it acts as an early mediator of inflammation and cell injury during myocardial I/R [7]. These results suggest that HMGB1 play an important role in myocardial I/R injury. However, HMGB1 has been recognized as a member of endogenous compounds, called \u201calarmins,\u201d which serve as danger signals to promote activation of the innate immune system in response to tissue injury as a result of trauma, I/R, or infection [8]. Izuishi et al [4] indicated that pretreatment of mice with HMGB1 protected against hepatic I/R injury and blunted the inflammatory response to this insult. And then, recently they found that preconditioning with HMGB1 could also induce LPS tolerance during hepatic I/R [8], indicating that preconditioning with HMGB1 may also protect against myocardial I/R injury as well as LPS.",
