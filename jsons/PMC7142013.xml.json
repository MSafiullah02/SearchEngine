            "text": "Contact between people plays an instrumental role in the direct spread of infectious diseases. Human contact patterns are fundamental to our understanding of the dynamics of infectious disease spread [1]. Put simply, an infectious disease that spreads from person to person cannot persist unless an infected person meets a susceptible one [1,2]. In terms of pathogens, this means that an infection that is readily spread through daily social contact does not have to last long, since an infectious person is almost certain to meet a susceptible individual within 1 day or 2 days [1]. It is not possible for each member of the population to have the same chance of meeting everyone else; instead, individuals are likely to have varying patterns of contact with one another. To gain a better understanding of the epidemiology of infectious diseases, we need to study these contact patterns, as they are important determinants of the spread of infectious disease. Moreover, the ability to predict infectious disease spread and the impact of interventions such as vaccinations depends on whether close contacts among individuals can be quantified. Understanding the nature of human contact patterns is crucial for predicting the impact of future pandemics and for devising effective control measures [2-4]. Presently, reporting systems in many countries measure the numbers and characteristics of contact patterns in the population with the goal of controlling the spread of infection [4-8]. Moreover, mathematical modeling of infectious diseases transmitted by respiratory or close-contact routes (e.g., pandemic influenza) is being increasingly used to predict epidemics and to determine the impact of possible interventions [5].",

Part I-4 consisted of items that collected data about physical (e.g., skin-to-skin) contact, which is associated with the probable spread of infectious diseases, and non-physical contact, defined as face-to-face conversations consisting of 2 or 3 phrases with the interlocutors within 2-3 m of one another.",

In detail, (1) descriptive statistics were utilized; (2) a scatter diagram was used to visualize the relationship between participant age and contact age; (3) contact patterns by participant age were analyzed in terms of the frequency, percentage, chi-square test, and Fisher exact test; (4) contact patterns were analyzed according to the general characteristics of participants using the t-test, Welch test, and Games-Howell test, and contact patterns were analyzed according to contact type, contact location, contact duration, and contact frequency using the chi-square test, Fisher exact test, and bar charts; and (5) perceptions of contacts in daily life and practices of hand hygiene and coughing etiquette were analyzed using the mean, SD, and analysis of variance. The score for each question was considered to be acceptable if the mean was 5 or higher on a 7-point Likert scale, 6 or higher on a 0-point to 9-point Likert scale, or 7 or higher on a 1-point to 10-point Likert scale in order to only count responses higher than neutral as acceptable. For item II-7, the perception of susceptibility to infectious disease was considered to be acceptable if the mean score was 4 or lower [17,18]. The Cronbach alpha was calculated as a measure of reliability.",
