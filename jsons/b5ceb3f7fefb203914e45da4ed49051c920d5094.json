Genetic mutations as well as environmental factors lead to the initiation, promotion, and progression of cancer. Cancer progression ends in tumor metastasis to distant sites, and metastasis is the major reason for cancer patient deaths. Recent experimental evidence suggests the pivotal role of cancer stem cells. A tumor is heterogeneous and composed of different cell types. The cancer stem cells in the tumor have the capacity both to self-renew and differentiate to sustain the tumor. Features of cancer stem cells are described in this review, with an emphasis on the role that dietary phytochemicals may play in cancer chemoprevention. Ingredients in the diet can inhibit cancer cells and cancer stem cells. These compounds include curcumin from curry, epigallocatechin gallate from green tea, resveratrol from red wine, genistein from soy, sulforaphane from broccoli, and many others. Current research findings advocate the beneficial effects towards cancer chemoprevention via uptake of a combination of different dietary phytochemicals.",

Thus, not all cells within a tumor are equal. Clonal evolution and competition within the tumor result in the dominance of the cell that is resistant to therapy and can both self-renew and differentiate its progeny cells. This observed tumor heterogeneity has been explained by the cancer stem cell (CSC) hypothesis. A workshop of the American Association for Cancer Research in 2006 settled with a consensus definition: CSC \"is a cell within a tumor that possesses the capacity to self-renew and to cause the heterogeneous lineages of cancer cells that comprise the tumor\" (Clarke et al. 2006) . The putative CSC is also known as a tumor-initiating cell, a term preferred by some investigators, as seen in this example: \"tumor-initiating cells (popularly known as cancer stem cells)\" (Zhou et al. 2009 ). In this chapter, we use the popular term, CSC.",

Research on various aspects of CSCs has been reported in the intervening years. In addition to research and review publications, CSCs are the topic of edited monographs.

Linking stem cells and cancer, histological similarities were noted between embryonic and tumor tissues in the nineteenth century. This became the \"embryonic rest\" theory: cancers arise from cells with properties similar to those of early embryos. Later investigations concluded that cancer can be viewed as a \"caricature\" of normal development. The uncharted cell proliferation seen in cancer is the result of distortion of normal development, and a lack of coordination between growth and differentiation (Nguyen et al. 2012 ). In addition, knowledge on stem cell biology in normal tissues has been translated to the concept of CSCs in cancerous tissues.",

They are used in the isolation of CSCs from leukemia, breast cancer, and many other cancers. CD24 is a heat-stable antigen, a sialoprotein that acts as a ligand for P-selectin, thus enabling the cell to bind to platelets and protecting tumor cells in the blood stream. Although CD24 is negative in breast CSCs, it is present in ovarian CSCs (Gao et al. 2010) . CD44 is a transmembrane glycoprotein which is a hyaluronic acid receptor. Besides breast cancer, CD44 is found in CSCs from pancreatic, gastric, head and neck, ovarian, and colon cancer. CD133, also named prominin-1, is a glycoprotein consisting of five transmembrane domains with a restricted expression within the plasma membrane protrusion sites. In addition to brain cancer, CD133 is found in CSCs from colon, liver, pancreatic, and prostate cancer (Alison et al. 2011; Zobalova et al. 2011; Hu and Fu 2012) . It should be noted that these antigens are also present in the respective normal stem cells, although they have been used as biomarkers for their cancerous counterparts. Hence, the significance of CD24 and CD44 as CSC markers has been seen as \"an enduring ambiguity\" (Jaggupilli and Elkord 2012) . Another important point is the lack of a single CD antigen common to all CSCs. However, a universal marker may be close at hand. In a recent drug screening study specifically targeting CSCs, dopamine receptors have been discovered as a biomarker for CSCs but not normal stem cells. Because only leukemic and breast CSCs have been tested so far, the novel biomarker requires confirmation and validation (Sachlos et al. 2012) .",

The SP assay measures the ability of cells to expel the fluorescent dye, Hoechst 33342, caused by the activity of ATP-dependent drug transporters on the plasma membrane, especially the ABCG2 transporter (Mo and Zhang 2012) . As analyzed by flow cytometry, cells with fast drug exit form a side population, as opposed to the main population composed of the majority of cells. Initially identified in HSCs, SP has been found in many CSCs. Similarly, ALDH is a detoxifying enzyme and acts by the oxidation of aldehydes to carboxylic acids for further metabolism or liver exit. A fluorescent substrate assay using ALDEFLUOR, biodipyaminoacetaldehyde (BAAA), allows for the isolation of ALDH + cells. The ALDH assay was initially used to isolate HSCs and normal breast stem cells, and then extended to CSCs (Ginestier et al. 2007 ). Inasmuch as both SP and ALDH assays involve drug extrusion and metabolism, exhibiting these capacities indicates drug resistance of normal and CSCs. For example, SP and ALDH assays, in addition to specific biomarker (such as CD44 and CD133) screening, have been utilized for the identification of human ovarian CSCs (as summarized by Bapat 2010) . However, it should be emphasized that these assays only enrich CSCs. The biomarker and functional assays may not characterize all the CSCs in the analyzed samples; therefore, additional CSCs not exhibiting the attribute being tested may still be present. For a list of biomarkers currently being used in the isolation of cancer stem cells, please see Table 1 .",

Tissue culture cells are usually grown as a monolayer in a nutrient-rich medium containing fetal bovine serum as a source of the necessary growth factors and other components. However, in the absence of serum but in the presence of growth factors such as fibroblast growth factor (FGF) and epidermal growth factor (EGF), cells will grow as spheres in suspension in unattached/untreated tissue culture plastic dishes, flasks, or plates. Spheroid cultures mimic the three-dimensional nature of a tissue. Furthermore, it should be noted that oxygen will be less available to the cells located at the interior of a sphere. The hypoxic condition may modulate their differentiated state: towards stemness. Originally developed for neurobiological studies, the spheroid culture is used to \"identify stem cells based on their reported capacity to evaluate self-renewal and differentiation at the single-cell level in vitro\" (Pastrana et al. 2011 ). Spheroid cultures have been developed for normal tissues and tumors . When isolated, individual sphere-forming cells from a tumor will form secondary and tertiary spheres upon sequential subcultures; by operational definition these will be CSCs. However, there have been critiques on this spheroid assay. Spheres are prone to aggregate. Hence, cell density will influence clonality. The quiescent stem cell may be missed by this method (Pastrana et al. 2011) . In fact, the quiescent nature of putative normal and CSCs has been utilized for their characterization. These cells are known as label-retaining cells, because they can retain labels such as the lipophilic dye PKH26, which is diluted in subsequent cell divisions but not so with slow-dividing cells (Pece et al. 2010; Xin et al. 2012) . From a tumor sample, putative CSCs may be characterized by the in vitro techniques discussed above. In addition to isolating CSCs from tumor samples, it is also possible to isolate them from established cancer cell lines (Drewa et al. 2011; Mather 2012) . The advantage of the latter is the absence of nontumor cells as contaminants; the disadvantage is the additional accumulated changes during the long period of in vitro culture. As an example, our interest in CSCs and SP analysis led us to isolate SPs from the rat C6 glioma cell line, deriving putative CSCs from an established cell line (Fong et al. 2010) . However, the C6 stemness state is dynamic: although SPs give rise to both SP and non-SP progenies, as expected, non-SPs can do the same (Fong et al. 2010; Fong and Chan 2012) .",

The isolated cells are tested by their ability to initiate new tumor growth after xenotransplantation into immunocompromised mice . Limiting dilution xenotransplantation yields an estimate of CSC abundance in the tumor sample; sequential transplantation yielding the original tumor will confirm the presence of CSCs. Different murine models with varying degrees of immunodeficiency have been applied to CSC studies. Examples include athymic nude mice, nonobese diabetic/severe combined immunodeficiency (NOD/SCID) mice, and NOD/SCID interleukin-2 receptor gamma chain null ( Il2rg \u2212/\u2212 ) mice. For example, using the severely immunodeficient NOD/SCID Il2rg \u2212/\u2212 mice in single-cell transplants (in an appropriate extracellular matrix, Matrigel) from human melanoma samples, 27% of unselected melanoma cells develop tumors in mice (Quintana et al. 2008) . Does this finding detect the abundance of human skin CSCs, whereas CSCs from other cancers are rare? There have been critiques on this xenotransplantation assay. Placing human cancer cells in immunodeficient mice is artificial because the human cancer cell will not encounter its normal host immune response. Therefore, results from this assay cannot reflect the physiological fate of the CSC in its native environment. Despite these objections, the limiting dilution murine in vivo xenotransplantation assay has been held as the \"gold standard\" for CSC identification (Ghiaur et al. 2012 ). However, other in vivo assays have been attempted for identifying CSCs. One example is the zebrafish model (Blackburn et al. 2011) . Nonetheless, we found this quote: \"despite being considered the gold standard assay for CSCs by many in the field, there is no reason to assume that growth in immunocompromised mice is in fact a relevant assay for CSC activity\" (Ghiaur et al. 2012 ).",

Tracking cells with fluorescent proteins such as green fluorescent protein (GFP) in three different murine solid tumors, as reported in 2012, has been cheered as \"resolving the stem-cell debate\" (Gilbertson 2012; Graham 2012) . In murine intestinal adenoma, 5-10% of the cells were CSCs, exhibiting the marker leucine-rich repeat-containing heterotrimeric guanine nucleotide-binding proteincoupled receptor 5 (Lgr5). The cell lineage tracing was made possible through the use of Cre-reporter at the Rosa26-Confetti locus, showing fluorescence (with four colors: green, red, yellow, blue) and even color conversion during tumor development. Lgr5 cells generated additional Lgr5 cells, as well as other adenoma cell types (Schepers et al. 2012) . In murine papilloma, a benign skin tumor, 20% of cells were stem cells (tracked by yellow fluorescent protein) that divided twice a day whereas the others became terminally differentiated tumor cells (Driessens et al. 2012 ). In murine glioblastoma, a transgene was created to label both the quiescent adult neural stem cells and a subset of the endogenous glioma tumor cells (expressing GFP). The transgene also contained a viral thymidine kinase gene that could be targeted by the drug ganciclovir. Gliomas were treated with the drug temozolomide (TMZ); but TMZ treatment alone led to the regrowth of a subpopulation of CSCs, that were then controlled by ganciclovir. TMZ-ganciclovir cotreatment impeded tumor development, by destroying both cancer cells and CSCs. Hence, this last study demonstrated the existence of murine glioma CSCs and their selective targeting ).",

CSCs are resistant to therapy; they are or become chemo-and radio-resistant during or after therapeutic treatments (Donnenberg and Donnenberg 2005; Krause et al. 2011) . These characteristics are due to the activity of drug transporters and metabolism enzymes, and a DNA repair system activated by genomic instability. CSCs may possess less reactive oxygen species (ROS), and thus are less susceptible to radiation therapy (Diehn et al. 2009 ). Depending on individual cases of cancer, CSCs may arise from either mutated normal stem cells, or dedifferentiated cancer cells exhibiting stem cell features. They display pathways of gene expression in common with those of normal stem cells. Therefore, thinking along therapeutic approaches, compounds targeting CSCs must be capable of differentiating them from the normal stem cells and sparing the latter, otherwise unforeseen problems with normal tissue homeostasis can occur.",

In its bone niche, HSC is quiescent in the bone marrow. In its vascular niche, HSC undergoes proliferation and differentiation within the blood vessels. Similarly, the niche concept applies to the CSCs. In addition to the primary tumor site, there are secondary tumor sites after tumor metastasis. Each tumor site consists of a variety of cellular and extracellular components. In addition to cancer cells and CSCs, other cell types include blood and lymphatic endothelial cells, fibroblasts, adipocytes, and immune and inflammatory cells. These cells may secrete molecules that can either promote or inhibit the tumor depending on changes in the microenvironment. The cytokines, chemotactic factors, and extracellular matrix produced by the various cells affect the behavior of cancer cells. Changes always occur within the tumor; the niche is dynamic. For example, there are cancer-associated fibroblasts and tumor-infiltrating macrophages. Separating the macrophage subsets as M1 and M2 with pro-and anti-inflammatory attributes, respectively, M1 protects against and M2 facilitates tumor development. Furthermore, the niche within the tumor is hypoxic. Hypoxia can be a determinant for CSCs, as CSCs may express hypoxia-inducible factors (F\u00e1bi\u00e1n et al. 2013) .",

Carcinoma cells produce the cytokine interleukin-1, which induces the MSCs to produce the lipid molecule prostaglandin E 2 (PGE 2 ).

The adhesive protein E-cadherin (E for epithelial) is downregulated, leading to more motile cells. The absence of E-cadherin also allows for drug resistance, because its elevated expression has been associated with high drug sensitivity.

EMT enhances cell survival by expressing genes that aid cells in avoiding apoptosis (programmed cell death), anoikis (cell death due to loss of cell adhesion), cellular senescence (the process of limited cell replication), and even host immune response (Tiwaria et al. 2012; Scheel and Weinberg 2012) .",

The rapid mitochondrial fission and fusion depend on GTPases, notably dynamin-related protein-1 (Drp-1) promoting fission and mitofusin-2 (Mfn-2) promoting fusion. The processes lead to elimination of damage (via fission) or compensation of damage (via fusion). Defective mitochondria are destroyed via autophagy (known as mitophagy). If all else fails, the stressed cell undergoes apoptosis (Youle and van der Bliek 2012).",

Using human lung adenocarcinoma cell line A549 xenografts in nude mice, Mfn-2 gene therapy (with adenovirus vector) leads to smaller tumors as compared to control cancer cells. Similar tumor size reduction is also seen with the pharmacological approach using Mdiv-1, a selective inhibitor of mitochondrial division in yeasts and mammalian cells. Thus, impaired fusion and enhanced fission contribute to the proliferation/apoptosis imbalance in cancer (Rehman et al. 2012 ). Targeting cancer cell mitochondria has generated the development of a group of compounds known as mitocans (mitochondrially targeted anticancer drugs). One such example is alpha-tocopheryl succinate, an analogue of vitamin E (Neuzil et al. 2007) .",

Additionally, it has been proposed that the CSC marker CD133 may select the stem cells by both evading host immune response and by overcoming stress-induced apoptosis via a mitochondrial connection (Zobalova et al. 2011) . In a study using the CD44 + /CD24 \u2212/low breast CSCs from MCF7 as xenografts to NOD/SCID mice, the mitochondrial targeting liposome carrying daunorubicin and quinacrine inhibits tumor development (Zhang et al. 2012a ).

The remedy was to wear clothes during chimney work and to clean and bathe afterwards. Such measures were followed in Holland but not in England, resulting in individuals with less and more scrotal cancers, respectively. Prevention of cancer became a topic of interest; concepts of chemoprophylaxis and chemoprotection began being proposed. In 1976, Michael Sporn introduced the word \"chemoprevention\" while investigating vitamin A and its analogues, and this became the commonly accepted term (Sporn and Suh 2000; Lippman and Hawk 2009) .

Phytochemicals have been isolated and characterized from fruits such as grapes and apples, vegetables such as broccoli and onions, spices such as turmeric, and beverages such as green tea and red wine, as well as numerous other sources. Collectively, these compounds became known as chemopreventive agents. As chemopreventive agents, phytochemicals have been shown to interact with multiple cellular targets (Aggarwal and Shishodia 2006a; ) and even with the epigenome (Vanden Berghe 2012). With respect to chemoprevention, phytochemicals target inflammation (Murakami and Ohigashi 2007; Kim et al. 2009 ). This is important because inflammation may initiate cancer, which is the loss of cell cycle control (Meeran and Katiyar 2008) . In addition, the chemopreventive phytochemicals are applicable to cancer therapy, because molecular mechanisms may be common to both chemoprevention and cancer therapy.

Turmeric is produced from the rhizome of the plant Curcuma longa. In addition to its use as a spice, turmeric has multiple applications in traditional Asian Indian medicine, ranging from treating insect bites to wound healing. Multiple health benefits have been associated with curcumin and turmeric, as summarized in a monograph (Aggarwal et al. 2007 ) and many reviews (Strimpakos and Sharma 2008; Goel et al. 2008) . Multiple and diverse bioactivities have been attributed to curcumin, including cancer chemopreventive and anti-inflammatory activities (Bisht et al. 2010 ). Curcumin acts on many cellular targets (Ravindran et al. 2009 ). These include enzymes such as cyclooxygenase, lipoxygenase, and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS); transcription factors such as NF\u03baB and activating protein-1 (AP1); cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor (TNF); and many gene products linked with cell survival, proliferation, invasion, and angiogenesis. For example, we found that curcumin inhibits NF\u03baB and TNF in a human monocytic cell line Mono Mac 6. With the endotoxin-induced murine sepsis model, curcumin ingestion by gavage induces bioactivity as shown by downregulating iNOS gene expression in the murine liver (Chan 1995; Chan et al. 1998) . Synergistic effects between curcumin and chemotherapeutic drugs have been demonstrated: we have shown that curcumin enhances the cisplatin-mediated killing of the human ovarian cancer cell lines CAOV3 and SKOV3 in vitro (Chan et al. 2003; Chan and Fong 2007) . We end this section with a note on curcumin and patentability. In March 1995 the USPTO awarded the patent \"Use of turmeric in wound healing\" (US Patent 5, 401, 504) to Suman Das and Hari Har Cohly, with the University of Mississippi as assignee. The patent was withdrawn in August 1997, after protest from India's Council of Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR) and demonstration of the lack of novelty criterion required for patenting, inasmuch as turmeric has been used for centuries by the Indian population for wound healing (Jayaraman 1997) . Whereas CSCs are drug-and radiation-resistant, curcumin is a chemosensitizer and radiosensitizer for tumors (Goel and Aggarwal 2010 ). However, we should also point out the \"dark side of curcumin\" (Burgos-Mor\u00f3n et al. 2010), as we note the potential of turmeric consumption in reducing the risk of cancer (Hutchins-Wolfbrandt and Mistry 2011).",

A polymeric nanoparticle formulation of curcumin, nanocurcumin trademark as NanoCurc (5-20 \u00b5M), induced apoptosis and reduced the CD133 + stem cells in malignant brain tumors in vitro . A hyaluronic acid (HA)-based nanogel-curcumin conjugate, using cholesteryl-HA, had 8 times higher cytotoxicity than curcumin alone towards human pancreatic CSCs expressing CD44 (Wei et al. 2013 ). The authors also reported similar effects with nanogel-drug conjugates of two other compounds targeting CSCs, namely etoposide and salinomycin. A novel micelle formulation of curcumin, composed of stearic acid-g-chitosan oligosaccharide (CSO-SA) as a polymeric, biocompatible, and biodegradable drug carrier, inhibited CD44 + / CD24 + colorectal CSCs in vitro and in vivo (nude mice xenografts), the latter at a dose of 2 mg/kg daily for 14 days in a 15-day experiment ). Another approach for curcumin solubility is to synthesize analogues. Difluorinated-curcumin (CDF) inhibited spheroid cultures of human colon CSCs from the cell line HCT116 (at 2-8 \u00b5M) in vitro (Kanwar et al. 2011) . CDF (2 \u00b5M) plus FOLFOX/FUOX (100 \u00b5M fluorouracil and 2.5 \u00b5M oxaliplatin) inhibited the growth of the HT-29 colorectal cancer cell line CSCs in vitro via downregulation of microRNA-21 (miR-21) and promotion of differentiation (Yu et al. 2013 ). GO-Y030, a monoketone analogue of curcumin (Sato et al. 2011) , inhibited human colorectal CSCs from the cell lines HCT116 and SW480 in vitro (induced apoptosis at 0.5-2.5 \u00b5M) and in vivo (NOD/SCID mice xenografts), the latter at a dose of 50 mg/kg daily for 14 days in a 29-day experiment .

Resveratrol is present in red wine because the molecule is associated with the skin portions of the fruit to fight against fungal infections of the plant. It is an example of the phytoalexins, compounds produced by plants against pathogens. Similar to plant fungal pathogens, we demonstrated it is active against human dermal fungal pathogens: resveratrol may be useful for treating athlete's foot (Chan 2002) . Health benefits associated with resveratrol are summarized in a monograph (Aggarwal and Shishodia 2006b ) and many reviews (Athar et al. 2007; Gescher 2008; Harikumar and Aggarwal 2008; Kundu and Surh 2008; Saiko et al. 2008) . It is \"one molecule, many targets\" (Pirola and Fr\u00f6jdo 2008) . Resveratrol's recent claim to fame involved its action as an activator of sirtuin deacetylases, leading to lifespan extension from organisms as diverse as yeasts, nematodes, fruit flies, and fish (Baur and Sinclair 2006) . Resveratrol's prior claim to fame involved a phenomenon known as the \"French Paradox\" (Opie and Lecour 2007) , referring to the observation that the French benefit from a relatively low risk of developing cardiovascular disease despite a diet that is high in saturated fat.",

With respect to the French Paradox, it is believed resveratrol and alcohol in red wine may be part of the reason.

Orphan drug designation provides a company with seven years of marketing exclusivity. In late April 2008, Sirtris was purchased by GlaxoSmithKline for $ 720 million. In December 2010, Sirtris announced that the clinical trial of SRT501 was halted but studies with other synthetic resveratrolmimicking drugs would continue. Currently, the role of resveratrol as an antiageing molecule seems to be in doubt (Wade 2011) . However, we must emphasize that resveratrol possesses cancer chemopreventive properties.

Inasmuch as resveratrol has multiple cellular targets, several of the cellular targets in CSCs have been revealed. In AML patients there is an increase in the cytokine interleukin 6 (IL-6) in their plasma. IL-6 induced activation of the Sonic Hedgehog signaling pathway has been shown in the human HL-60 cell line, and resveratrol (25 \u00b5M) inhibits this activation and decreases cell viability (Su et al. 2013) . In malignant brain tumor medulloblastoma CSCs that were grown in spheroid cultures, resveratrol (100 \u00b5M) inhibited proliferation in vitro and enhanced radiosensitivity (Lu et al. 2009 ). In primary central nervous system atypical teratoid/rhabdoid tumors, resveratrol (150-200 \u00b5M) induced apoptosis of the isolated CD133 + CSCs in vitro and also enhanced radiosensitivity. The in vitro resveratrol-treated and irradiated CD133 + CSCs resulted in better survival of SCID mice in a 14-week xenograft experiment ). In glioblastoma multiforma, comparison of CD133 + and CD133\u2212 cells has shown the involvement of signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3). Resveratrol acts via inhibiting the STAT3 cytokine signaling pathway. CSCs treated in vitro with resveratrol (200 \u00b5M) and irradiation resulted in better survival of SCID mice; this effect of resveratrol can be mimicked with small hairpin (sh) RNA of STAT3 ).",

Using CD44 + /CD24 \u2212 CSCs isolated from cell lines MCF7, MDA-MB231, and 231LM, resveratrol (50-100 \u00b5M) inhibited spheroid cultures by inducing apoptosis. The mechanism involved the action of resveratrol on lipid synthesis, by its downregulation of fatty acid synthase (FAS). Luciferase-expressing CSCs from MDA-MB231 showed smaller-sized tumors in nude mice xenografts with resveratrol administration (22.4 mg/kg via oral gavage or intraperitoneal injection) every 2 days in a 28-day experiment (Pandey et al. 2011) . Similar results have been reported by the same investigators using CSCs isolated from another human breast cancer cell line, MCF10DCIS. com (Pandey et al. 2012) . In human head and neck cancer, resveratrol (25-100 \u00b5M) eliminates aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH) activity, spheroid formation, and epithelial mesenchymal transition (EMT) in vitro, as well as reduces tumor xenograft volume and weight in vivo in immunodeficient mice (40 mg/kg daily for 20 days) . Human pancreatic CD133 + /CD44 + /CD24 + CSCs formed spheroid cultures and expressed stemness genes such as Oct4, Nanog, and Sox2. These activities were inhibited by resveratrol (10-30 \u00b5M) in vitro. In a special transgenic mouse model, KRAS G12D, the mice were designed to develop pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma. The increase in size of the pancreas was inhibited by resveratrol (40 mg/kg) administered 5 days a week for 10 months. In addition to inhibiting the stemness genes, alias pluripotency maintaining factors, resveratrol inhibited EMT (Shankar et al. 2011) . In summary, resveratrol aims at different cellular targets of CSCs, depending on the cancer type.",

The agouti mouse model, as noted by color change in the fur, is useful as an epigenetic biosensor for nutritional and environmental alterations on the fetal genome (Dolinoy 2008) . Maternal dietary supplementation with genistein (250 mg/kg in the diet) led to DNA hypermethylation in the embryo and the methylation state was maintained until adulthood. Thus, phytochemicals such as genistein modify the epigenome, and the effect starts early in embryogenesis (Dolinoy et al. 2006) .",

In an in vitro study on chronic myelogenic leukemia in 1996, the stem and progenitor cells were more sensitive to genistein (200 \u00b5M) than the normal progenitor cells (Carlo-Stella et al. 1966a , 1996b . In human prostate cancer, the CSCs from the cell line PC3 had been targeted by genistein (15 \u00b5M) in vitro, which aided in the death of these CSCs by docetaxel. In this work, the CSCs have been named \"the Achilles' heel of cancer\" (McCubrey et al. 2011) . Another study on prostate cancer extended its focus to in vivo xenografts, and discovered the cellular target as inhibiting the Hedgehog pathway . Genistein (30 \u00b5M) inhibited spheroid cultures of prostate CSCs from the cell lines 22RV1 and DU145, and inhibited tumor development in vivo in nude mice (twice weekly of genistein and/or docetaxel at 10 mg/kg) in a 28-day experiment. Although the CSCs were resistant to docetaxel, genistein plus docetaxel decreased tumor volume more than genistein alone. Another interesting report involved the feeding of genistein to mice, \"at concentrations present in soy protein isolate (250 mg/kg food;\" Montales et al. 2012) . Sera from the genisteinfed animals were used to treat human breast CSCs from the cell lines MCF7 and MDA-MB231. When 1-5% of these sera was added to the medium, spheroid formation was inhibited, suggesting \"factors found in sera of mice consuming\" genistein were active against CSCs. Molecular details of the factors were not characterized. However, this last investigation is interesting with respect to chemoprevention: genistein in the diet leads to the animals having factors in the circulation that inhibit CSCs.",

Broccoli, cabbage, cauliflower, Brussel sprouts, and kale are cultivars of the plant known as Brassica oleracea. These common vegetables belong to the plant order Brassicales. An older name is Cruciferae; they are also named crucifers or the cabbage family. The wild cabbage originally came from Europe. Broccoli and related vegetables contain many phytochemicals (Latte et al. 2011 ). In addition to sulforaphane, there are other compounds, such as indole-3-carbinol (I3C) and quercetin. Sulforaphane is released from the plant cell wall by activity of the enzyme myrosinase via cooking or chewing. The compound has multiple cellular targets: as an antioxidant, an activator of phase II detoxification enzymes, an anti-inflammatory agent, an inducer of apoptosis, and other roles (James et al. 2012 ). Broccoli has been used, as an example, for a \"nutritional genomics\" approach \"in conveying to the consumer\" that \"the dietary regime being marketed will positively affect their health\" (Ferguson and Schlothauer 2012).",

Sulforaphane has been shown to inhibit human breast CSCs from the cell lines MCF7 and SUM159 in vitro and in vivo (Li et al. 2010) . Spheroid cultures were inhibited (10-20 \u00b5M), as well as ALDH expression. In NOD/SCID mouse xenografts, two successive generations elegantly showed a decrease in tumor volume and an increase in survival (50 mg/kg daily for 14 days) in a 35-day experiment. Sulforaphane inhibited spheroid cultures in human pancreatic CSCs from the cell line MIA-PaCa2 in vitro (20 \u00b5M) and in vivo . Sulforaphane inhibits renewal of pancreatic cancer stem cells in vitro (20 \u00b5M) by inhibiting the Sonic Hedgehog signaling pathway . In nude mice xenograft experiments, sulforaphane (60 mg/kg) or cotreatment with the multikinase inhibitor sorafenib (3 mg/kg), daily for 3 days in a 5-day experiment, reduced tumor size via inhibition of the NF\u03baB pathway . The same research group also extended their report on pancreatic CSCs to include results on prostate CSCs derived from the cell line DU145 (Kallifatidis et al. 2011) . Sulforaphane was added in vitro to taxol, cisplatin, gemcitabine, flurouracil, or doxorubicin. Targeting was specific for CSCs, because normal cells (primary human fibroblasts and umbilical vein endothelial cells) were not affected. In vivo nude mice xenografts for pancreatic CSCs used sulforaphane in combination with gemcitabine (3 mg/kg consequently for 3 days; treatment started after tumor development was observed, in a 40-day experiment). In a different experiment, the pancreatic CSCs had been pretreated with the sulforaphane-gemcitabine combination before xenograft. Both protocols resulted in decreased tumor volume (Kallifatidis et al. 2011) . In fact, sulforaphane alone could reduce human pancreatic CSC growth in immunodeficient mice, through inhibiton of the Sonic Hedgehog signaling pathway (20 mg/kg once a day for 5 days in a 6-week experiment; Li et al. 2013 ). In addition to solid tumors, sulforaphane enhancement of drug efficacy has been reported for leukemia. The CD34 + chronic myeloid leukemia CSCs previously resistant to imatinib were killed by a combination of imatinib (0.1-1 \u00b5M) and sulforaphane (20-30 \u00b5M) in vitro, via activation of the Wnt pathway and ROS induction ).",

Parthenolide (PTL), from the feverfew plant ( Tanacetum parthenium), is commonly used in herbal medicine. PTL targets human acute myelogenous leukemia stem cells (Guzman et al. 2005) . As an inhibitor of NF\u03baB, it inhibited human breast CSCs from the cell line MCF7 (Zhou et al. 2008) . Screening in silico for compounds with similar effects on gene expression as PTL has revealed others, including celastrol, found in thunder god vine ( Tripterygium wilfordii) and used in Chinese herbal medicine (Hassane et al. 2008) . Another compound, berberine, from plants such as goldenseal ( Hydrastis canadensis) and the Chinese goldthread ( Coptis chinensis), also used in herbal medicine, targets MCF7 SP cells (Kim et al. 2008) . MCF7 SP cells were also inhibited by the alkaloid oxymatrine, from the Chinese herbal medical plant Sophora flavescens . Eriocalyxin, an analogue of the natural diterpene from the Chinese herbal medical plant Isodon eriocalyx, inhibited human ovarian CSCs via NF\u03baB inhibition (Leizer et al. 2011) . Cyclopamine from corn lily ( Veratrum californicum) targets glioblastoma CSCs by inhibiting the Hedgehog pathway (Bar et al. 2007 ). However, it should be noted that cyclopamine is a teratogen that causes holoprosencephaly (cyclopia). Silybin, alias silibinin, is a flavonoid compound from the herbal medical plant milk thistle ( Silybum marianum). The phytochemical targets colorectal CSCs . Butein is a chalconoid compound from the Chinese lacquer tree ( Toxicodendron vernicifluum) with aromatase-inhibiting effects. It targets human breast CSCs (Cioce et al. 2010) . Gossypol is a polyphenol from the cotton plant (genus Gossypium) and at one time had been tested as a male contraceptive. It targets prostate CSCs via activation of the p53 gene regulatory protein (Volate et al. 2010) . From the above studies, it is obvious that many phytochemicals can target CSCs of different cancers.",

            "text": "How safe are the dietary phytochemicals? Because they can interact with drug transporters and drug metabolizing enzymes (known as phase I and phase II enzymes), the potential toxicity and safety of phytochemicals are major concerns. As an example, they have antioxidant capacities against ROS. However, under special conditions they also exhibit pro-oxidant capacity. Whereas ROS is harmful in general, the removal of too much ROS interferes with body functions, as seen in the warning presented by scientists to the food industry (Finley et al. 2011) . With an emphasis on their putative cancer chemopreventive uses, the safety of a group of phytochemicals has been reviewed (Verschoyle et al. 2007 ). For curcumin, given to cancer patients at 3,600 mg/day for 4 months or 800 mg/day for 3 months, only minor adverse effects were seen. For EGCG, daily oral doses for 4 weeks at 800 mg/day in 40 volunteers caused only minor adverse effects. For resveratrol, a single oral dose at 5 g in 10 volunteers caused only minor adverse effects (Boocock et al. 2007 ). However, \"High consumption of dietary phytochemicals should be considered with caution taking into account their dosage regimes, toxicity, metabolic conversion, transport mechanisms, tissue availability, synergistic interaction with drugs, and interferences with key enzymes, receptors, metabolic pathways, and normal GI microflora\" (Priyadarsini and Nagini 2012) . More extensive toxicological testing is recommended, if phytochemicals are to be taken as cancer chemopreventive agents on a long-term basis by healthy individuals.",

For phytochemicals such as plant polyphenols, the effects in vivo, although significant, are more limited than those observed in vitro . However, it is possible to design appropriate interactions that affect the bioavailability of phytochemicals in vivo (Scholz and Williamson 2007) , such as enhancement of curcumin efficacy with piperine, as previously mentioned. We have used oral gavage plus starvation (an empty stomach) to enhance curcumin uptake in mice (Chan et al. 1998; Adapala and Chan 2008 ) so as to demonstrate its in vivo inhibition of the inflammatory iNOS in the murine liver (beneficial outcome) and the exacerbation of murine visceral leishmaniasis, a protozoan parasitic disease (detrimental outcome).

The concept of hormesis suggests that the fundamental nature of the dose-response curve to be neither linear nor threshold, but rather U-shaped or J-shaped. This shows a low dose stimulatory response known as the hormetic effect, representing overcompensation in response to disruptions in homeostasis (Calabrese and Baldwin 2001) . For phytochemicals among an estimated 10,000 secondary products (natural pesticides), it has been proposed that human ancestors evolved a generalized defense mechanism against low levels of phytochemicals to enable their consumption of many different plant species containing variable levels of natural pesticides (carcinogens) without subsequent ill health. Traces of phytochemicals found in fruits and vegetables may potentiate the immune system and help to protect against cancer (Trewavas and Stewart 2003) . A biphasic dose response is observed. At high concentrations, phytochemicals can be toxic, whereas subtoxic doses may induce adaptive stress responses. There is the activation of signaling pathways that results in increased expression of genes encoding cytoprotective proteins. It is suggested that hormetic mechanisms of action may underlie many of the health benefits of phytochemicals (Mattson 2008) . These benefits would include their action against CSCs.",

In September 2012, Science magazine published a special section including a cover photo on the topic of disease prevention (Ash et al. 2012) . One contributed article titled: \"Can Noncommunicable Diseases Be Prevented?\" suggested \"effective approaches for large-scale NCD prevention include,\" among these, \"increasing the consumption of fresh fruits and vegetables\" (Ezzati and Riboli 2012) .",

It has been suggested that \"research should focus more sharply on specific fruits and vegetables and their constituents and on earlier periods of life\" (Willett 2010) . We have already mentioned genistein's effect on fetal DNA methylation. Thus, here comes \"the maternal womb: a novel target for cancer prevention\" (Simmen and Simmen 2011). Dietary interventions prior to and during pregnancy may confer cancer chemoprevention. The first sentence in a discussion on the \"myth or reality\" aspects of dietary molecules begins with the 400 BC statement of Hippocrates: \"Let thy food be thy medicine and thy medicine be thy food\" (Neergheen-Bhujun et al. 2012) .",

In October 2012 the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine was announced for the discovery of cell reprogramming (Abbott 2012) . In 1962 John Gurdon published his work on the plasticity of a differentiated nucleus from an amphibian: the nucleus from a tadpole's intestinal cell replaced the egg nucleus and generated a frog. In 2006 Shinya Yamanaka published his work on the reprogramming of a differentiated cell type from a mouse: the mouse fibroblast became an embryonic stem cell by adding just four genes. The latter work is transferable to humans and the induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells will be important for future clinical applications. The differentiated state of a cell is dynamic. A CSC plays its essential role in maintaining the particular tumor. If dietary phytochemicals, or specific fruits and vegetables, are available to destroy this CSC, or reverse its stemness characteristics, or induce its cell differentiation, there will be chemoprevention of cancer.",
