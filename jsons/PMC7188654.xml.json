Recently published papers have described the clinical characteristics and overall outcomes of COVID-19 patients with the impact on the healthcare system.4 Two studies have reported associated coagulopathy disorders. These reports have highlighted a co-existing hypercoagulable state in patients with COVID-19, which may be associated with higher mortality.5\n,\n6 A sudden and significant increase of COVID-19 infected patients presenting with ALI has been noted at our institutions with the viral spread.

Preoperative computed tomography scan was performed to identify COVID-19 related pneumonia (Figure 1\n). These studies were performed in the Emergency Room in order to avoid cross-contamination and unnecessary risk of viral spread. Patients with suspected aorto-iliac occlusion underwent computed-tomography angiography (CT-A) to assess the extent of disease and vessel sizing (Figure 2\nA,B). Patients who presented with infrainguinal and/or upper limb occlusive disease underwent echo-color-Doppler evaluation of both the arterial and venous systems. Also, during the course of hospitalization all patients were screened for the identification of eventual cardiac emboli sources by means of transthoracic echocardiography. Operative risk profile was defined using a multidisciplinary evaluation which included the physical examination and laboratory blood tests.",

All patients received oxygen support: at the moment of this analysis, no patient required preemptive intubation due to COVID-19 related pneumonia. In cases of aorto-iliac or femoro-popliteal occlusion, a standard groin incision was used for expose of the femoral bifurcation. We selectively used a below-the-knee incision to expose the popliteal artery in patients with isolated popliteal-tibial occlusion. Upper limb ischemia was treated through direct open brachial artery exposure. Thromboembolectomy was performed using standard embolectomy catheters (Le Maitre\u00ae; Burlington \u2013 MA; USA) sized according to the location of the occlusion. In all cases, completion angiography was performed through the surgical access (Figure 2\nC). Tibial arteries and/or forearm vessels were approached selectively in cases of distal occlusion. Fasciotomies was not performed on a routine basis. In latter cases, especially in those with a typical aspect of desert foot, our protocol has been augmented with intra-arterial loco-regional thrombolysis using alteplase (Actilyse\u00ae \u2013 Boehringer Ingelheim Italia S.p.A.; Milan \u2013 Italy) at a ratio of 20 mg/20 minutes. Postoperative anti-thrombotic regimen has been standardized with the most recent patients receiving anticoagulation regimen consisting of continuous intravenous heparin infusions. In case of <80% basal level of anti-thrombin III (AT-III), 500 units of AT-III was infused ten minutes before starting with continuous intravenous heparin to reach 2.5 aPTT (activated partial thromboplastin time). Thrombi retrieved from each patient were sent for histology evaluation (Figure 2). Postoperative surveillance was performed with physical examination every hour coupled with a full blood panel every eight hours. Transfusions of packed red blood cells were given only if the hemoglobin level decreased to <8g/dL. An infectious disease specialist evaluated each patient regularly during the entire hospitalization in order to optimize the type, dosage and duration of antibiotic and anti-retroviral therapy. At discharge, all patients were given enoxaparin sodium injections (Clexane \u2013 Sanofi S.p.A.; Milan \u2013 Italy) for home use at a therapeutic dosage. Follow-up and surveillance imaging will include clinical visits with ankle-brachial index and duplex ultrasound examination at 1, 6, and 12 months, and then yearly. Any change in examination or ankle-brachial index or suspicion loss of patency will be confirmed with duplex ultrasound and CT-A.",

Complications were described as mild (when resolved spontaneously or with nominal intervention, did not prolong hospital stay or did not cause permanent disability), moderate (need for significant intervention, prolongation of hospitalization for >24 hours, a minor amputation, or association with minor disability that does not interfere with normal daily activity), or severe (necessitates a major surgical, medical, or endovascular intervention and includes prolonged convalescence, major amputation, permanent disability, or death). Major amputations were classified as transfemoral or transtibial; minor amputations were considered any toe or forefoot amputation and were not considered in the analysis of freedom from amputation.

During hospitalization, 2/15 (13%) patients underwent reintervention because of a recurrent thrombotic occlusion of the treated arterial segment on postoperative day 1st and 2nd. No ipsilateral deep venous thrombosis was detected in patients with desert foot or in those who delevoped recurrent thrombotic occlusion. Overall, limb salvage was obtained in 14/15 (93.3%) patients: major amputation was needed in 1 patient who was an 81 years old man transferred to our institution 450 minutes after symptom onset and in whom, the attempted revascularization was unsuccessful. Univariate analysis showed no significant differences between those who had successful revascularization and those did not, neither in terms of comorbidities nor in terms of SVS risk profile (P = 0.739). The presence of COVID-19 related pneumonia was not significantly associated with successful revascularization (45.4% vs. 66.7%, P = 0.620). In contrast, preoperative PO2 was significantly lower in those who had not successful revascularization (mmHg, 46 \u00b1 8 vs. 76 \u00b1 17, P = 0.004). Although successful revascularization was not significantly associated with the postoperative use of intravenous heparin (64.7% vs. 83.3%, P = 0.622), no patients receiving intravenous heparin required reintervention.",

This higher incidence and the high failure rate due to unsuccessful revascularization seems to support a marked hypercoagulable status in these infected patients, a process which could be triggered by viral infection. These observations, as well as the findings coming from experimental models, have led us to strengthen our treatment protocol by mainly focusing on the use of intravenous heparin. The addition of heparin could seem to increase treatment effectiveness and most importantly has been associated with better survival.",
