Patients were selected for the study if they presented with wheezing that required therapy with inhaled \u03b22-agonists as judged by the attending physician. In addition, 65 children 0 to 12 years of age (39 boys) without respiratory symptoms and no previous history of wheezing who sought ED care at the same hospitals for other reasons were selected as control subjects. The most frequent complaints among the control subjects were acute gastroenteritis, fever, abdominal pain, headache, vomiting, and seizures. Children with chronic respiratory illnesses (n = 2) (bronchopulmonary dysplasia) and those who reported therapy with corticosteroids within 4 weeks before the ED visit (n = 8) were not included in the study. All children were residents in the city of Ribeir\u00e3o Preto. Wheezing and control children were enrolled every month from October 1998 to June 2000, except for December 1998. Approximately 3% of all children seen in the ED over the study period were enrolled in the study, and 95% of the children approached were enrolled. Peaks of attendance to the ED for wheezing were observed in both years; 61% and 68%, respectively, of wheezing and control children under 2 years of age were enrolled from February through May and 52% and 60% of wheezing and control children older than 2 years were enrolled from March through June.",

A positive family history for allergy was characterized by the report of asthma, rhinitis, and/or atopic dermatitis diagnosed by a physician in the mother, father, and/or sibling(s). History of prior wheezing illnesses was reported for 48% of the wheezing children younger than 2 years and for 93% of the older wheezing children. However, only 16% of the wheezing infants and 51% of the wheezing children older than 2 years reported asthma diagnosed by a physician.

Typing of adenovirus isolated from cultures to the subgenus level was performed by amplification of the VA-RNA region of the viral genome by PCR, according to previously described method.19 PCR products of 520 to 522 bp and 505 bp in length corresponded to adenovirus subgenera B and C, respectively. Certain adenovirus serotypes including those of subgenus C can be identified in nasal aspirates up to several weeks after acute infection.20 To minimize the interference of latent adenovirus, only subgenus B was included in the analysis.",

RSV infections were predominantly found in the months of February to May, corresponding to late summer and early to mid-fall, indicating that the virus occurs in a different seasonal pattern as compared with that of the northern hemisphere.

It is possible that genetic factors may play a role in determining immunologic responses to rhinovirus in different populations. In addition, rhinovirus serotypes circulating in tropical areas may be different from those in temperate climates, particularly regarding their ability to replicate in the lower respiratory airways. Temperatures in the lower airways may be critical for the intensity of replication, at least for some rhinovirus serotypes.27 It has been demonstrated that inhalation of cold air results in substantial temperature decrease in the lower airways28 that may favor rhinovirus replication. In the northern hemisphere, rhinovirus peak prevalence occurs in early fall and late spring and has been associated with new school terms.29 In subtropical climates, it is possible that higher temperatures year-round may be less conducive to productive growth of rhinovirus. Reduced rhinovirus spread in these areas could, at least in part, be due to the styles of housing peculiar to warmer climates, with homes and schools being ventilated by keeping windows open.",

We have previously reported that mites and cockroach were major causes of sensitization among children with asthma and/or allergic rhinitis, seen at university-based allergy clinics in Ribeir\u00e3o Preto and S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil.36 In the current study, the frequency of allergic sensitization was very high, notably among control children (43% of the children).

Inhalant allergens appear to be a major cause of asthma attacks in this environment, and rhinovirus does not appear to play a remarkable role in triggering asthma symptoms, as previously described in temperate regions.",
