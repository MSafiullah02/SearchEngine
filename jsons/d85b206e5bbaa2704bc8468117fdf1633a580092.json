In fact, in the results shown in Fig. 7b , it is possible to identify 5 out of the 7 known A*0201-restricted CD8 T-cell epitopes from SARS nucleoprotein ( Table 2 ) . The goodness of peptide-MHC binding and T-cell epitope predictions provided by any predictive model, including motifprofi les, is tied to the data used for model building [ 32 , 33 ] . To demonstrate such infl uence, here we will compare the predictions of A*0201-restricted CD8 T-cell epitopes from SARS nucleoprotein that are obtained with 4 distinct motif-profi les, including that described in the previous section (hereafter profi le #1). The specifi c peptide selections that give rise to the different profi les used in this section are detailed in Table 2 . Briefl y, all profi le-motifs are generated from peptides binding with high affi nity to A*0201. In addition, profi le #3 and #4 only include peptides from viruses and profi le #2 and #4 only include peptides known to display T-cell activity (they are epitopes). To evaluate the predictive performance of these profi les, we scored and ranked all peptides from SARS nucleoprotein and compared the ranking achieved by the known SARS nucleoprotein A*0201-restricted CD8 T-cell epitopes shown in Table 1 . These results are summarized in Table 3 . All four motif-profi les produce related results, ranking the known CD8 T-cell epitopes among the top scoring peptides of SARS nucleoprotein. This is expected as A*0201-restricted CD8 T-cell epitopes and the peptides used for model building have in common the ability to bind to A*0201. However, there are also differences in the results. Thus, only the profi les derived from viral peptides are capable of predicting the known A*0201-restricted CD8 T-cell epitopes from SARS nucleoprotein among the top 11 scoring peptides (Table 3 ) . Judging from the dispersion of the ranks (Table 3 ) , the best overall epitope predictions are obtained PSSMs generated using position-based weights [ 30 ] with a motif-profi le derived from viral peptides with known T-cell activity (T-cell epitopes). It remains to be explored whether discarding peptide-MHC binders with no reported T-cell activity always improves the resulting T-cell epitope prediction models. It is important to note that none of the known epitopes used in these analyses have been used to derive any of the profi les. In fact, the current version of EPIMHC does not contain any SARS peptides at all. In conclusion, profi les are very powerful at capturing nontrivial motifs and the results shown here support that epitope predictions can be improved using customized peptide-MHC binding profi les.
