Of the 15 dogs that underwent a seroconversion, 12 suffered respiratory symptoms while only 3 remained healthy. Proportionally this was 46% of the dogs with respiratory disease compared to 19% that remained apparently healthy. This difference was statistically significant when the values of the antibody increase from the two groups were compared. This finding indicates that the antibody response to M. cynos occurring following entry into the re-homing kennel is more likely among dogs that show clinical disease. Nevertheless, overt disease may not be necessary for an initiating agent to allow colonisation by secondary pathogens. In other mycoplasma diseases it is well recognised that while the initial mycoplasma infection is mild, secondary bacterial infection may become much more likely following the initial infection (Ciprian et al., 1988, Ciprian et al., 1994, Amass et al., 1994).",

In some cases B. bronchiseptica was present (Chalker et al., 2003a) while in others \u03b2-haemolytic streptococci were found (Chalker et al., 2003b). In other cases, no obvious bacterial cause could be detected. Mycoplasmas have been known for some time to modulate host susceptibility to secondary infections (Kaklamanis and Pavlatos, 1972, Thacker et al., 1999).
