The tone, enthusiasm, and audibility with which the intervention was uttered was at the discretion of the duty member. To minimise confounding we did not disseminate the intervention to colleagues who worked in other departments, such as infection control or biomedical scientists. Each day over a period of 61 days was randomly allocated to the intervention or control using a list prepared before the study start by the trial statistician (PPJP) using the big stick procedure 9 to minimise imbalance between trial arms. Randomisation was not stratified and was implemented using sequentially numbered opaque envelopes containing that day\u2019s allocation.

The upper bound of the 95% confidence interval was less than the prespecified margin of 30 for non-inferiority, thereby providing evidence for non-inferiority. Although the workload was greater on week days than at weekends (a mean increase of 34.6 episodes), the differences between interventions were consistent in the subgroups of week days or weekends with no evidence for an interaction between treatment and type of day (P=0.870). The mean difference between arms was slightly smaller after adjustment for type of day (weekend or week day) and daily bed occupancy (0.4, \u221215.1 to 15.9); although the upper bound of the confidence interval was still less than 30, supporting non-inferiority. The greatest contribution to workload was validation of results, with a mean 97.0 on control days and 96.2 on intervention days (see supplementary file). No evidence of a difference in workload was found between the intervention and control groups for any of the four components, whether in unadjusted or adjusted analyses or when subgroups analysed by week days or weekends (see supplementary file).",

In contrast, in our study we followed a prespecified protocol following SPIRIT guidelines, reported results in line with CONSORT guidelines, conducted the study over 61 days, and looked at several different components of workload. As whole days were randomised in our study we also included both day time and out of hours on-call work. A second similar study was performed in an emergency department in Japan.5 The authors also found no detrimental effect on workload of using the word quiet. Some of the primary and secondary outcome measures were, however, subjective, although attempts were made to control for subjectivity.

Secondly, we did not incorporate microbiology ward rounds in our data collection as these are non-standardised and difficult to measure but they could have impacted on the number of clinical inquiries on any given day. Thirdly, we did not control for other confounding factors such as seasonal variation, number of microbiological samples received, or presence of black cats, cracked mirrors, or lone magpies. Fourthly, while our margin of non-inferiority was prespecified before the study began and was based on the clinical judgment of the authors and colleagues, it was not derived from a formal consensus building approach, as is sometimes recommended. Fifthly, a chance imbalance in treatment allocation occurred between weekdays and weekends (see table 1). Randomisation was not stratified and therefore chance imbalances are possible. We have presented adjusted analyses that showed slightly smaller differences between arms, and subgroup analyses with no evidence of interactions. Our study was not powered to detect treatment-covariate interactions, but we nevertheless consider that the totality of the evidence overwhelmingly supports our conclusion of non-inferiority. Day of week and bed occupancy are likely predictors of workload and we would recommend restricted randomisation to balance one or both factors for future randomised clinical trials in this area. Finally, this trial was conducted in a single study centre over a two month period, which might limit generalisability to other populations.",

Appreciably among this number the case mix can vary hugely across all specialties and age groups\u2014each call for advice presents a unique challenge. However, the components of the primary outcome forms only a part of the role of medical microbiologists. The challenges within infection management are ever increasing, with healthcare associated infections; emerging and re-emerging infections such as Middle East respiratory syndrome, monkey pox, and measles; and, arguably most concerning, increasing antimicrobial resistance.10\n11 Point prevalence data from 2011-12 highlighted that about 30% of patients in UK hospitals received an antimicrobial agent,12 indicating the scale of the role of medical microbiologists. Antibiotic stewardship,13 guideline development, and infection control also form key parts of the medical microbiology discipline. Microbiology is a small specialty with 682 consultant medical microbiologists in the UK and 233 medical microbiology or combined microbiology and infectious diseases trainees. Overall, 35 clinical scientists hold a fellowship of the Royal College of Pathologists (FRCPath) and practice medical microbiology.14\n",
