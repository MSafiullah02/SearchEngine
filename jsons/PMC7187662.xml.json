At the end of 2019, the World Health Organization was notified by health officials in the Chinese province of Hubei, about the presentation of pneumonia of unknown aetiology. Subsequent biological and genomic testing revealed a new type of coronavirus, which we now know as COVID-19 [1]. Following the discovery of the first case, there has been an exponential rise in those infected, and as of 3 April 2020, there have been 1,088,878 confirmed cases of COVID-19, with a total of 58,382 deaths [2].",

The RCOphth website offers guidance on the risk stratification of patients to ensure that none suffer permanent sight loss as a result of the delay to their appointment or treatment, whilst protecting both staff and patients by reducing the departmental footfall [5].",

Whilst this is occurring, the ophthalmic service is operating at around 20% with emergency eye care provision still paramount.",
