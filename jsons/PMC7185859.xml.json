            "text": "The leg-amputees who wear lower-limb prostheses suffer from attenuated tactile knowledge of their extension, owing to the natural sensory loss resulting from amputation [1]. Many clinical studies report that amputees exhibit an asymmetrical gait pattern [2], [3], [4]. For example, unilateral transtibial amputees generally have higher hip extension, knee flexion, and ankle dorsiflexion in amputated side than those in the unaffected side. Leg-amputees are accustomed to the asymmetrical gait pattern if they do not take a series of training after wearing limb prosthesis. Apart from discomfort, the amputees might suffer from some spinal deformities or muscle injuries. Owing to lacking of exercise, muscular flaccidity might occur and the stumps will be getting swollen resulting in that patients cannot swing their thighs backward, and the shank and the knee joint cannot be straightened. Therefore, an expert had better accompany the amputee during the training process to rectify the amputee's gait and the training expense is accordingly significantly increased.",

The human\u2013machine interface for the prosthesis socket has to be properly designed to achieve satisfactory load transmission, stability, and efficient control for mobility [6], [7], [8]. The powered ankle\u2013foot prosthesis is capable of providing human-like ankle work and power during stance and decreasing the metabolic cost of transport compared with the conventional passive-elastic prosthesis [9]. The prosthetic legs outfitted with Bluetooth technology were designed in [10] to make two limbs coordinate each other to control the leg movement. Despite a multitude of technical advances in lower-limb prostheses have been observed in the literature, no existing approaches are able to warn the amputee for the detection of the asymmetrical gait. Though Bluetooth prosthesis [10] can automatically control the leg movement for the amputee, the amputee might suffer from uncomfortable and uncoordinated walking. A well-designed gait training process for rehabilitation is thus still demanded. In the recent positioning technology, Want et al. [11] uses diffuse infrared to develop an active badge positioning system. Users wear badges that transmit infrared signals to provide information about their location to a centralized location service via a network of sensors. However, the infrared signals have the weakness of moving in a straight line, short transmission distance, and easily disturbed by the environment.",

Moreover, the evaluation of gait training effectiveness relies upon accumulated experiences that gait trainer owns and little explicit criterion can be followed. Accordingly, many general statements are used in training records that cause difficult tracing of therapy process. To tackle above-mentioned problems, several important factors are considered in this work, including setting up the quantitative index for leg-amputees training effectiveness assessment, providing real-time guidance for self-training at home, establishing the mechanism of supervising and tracing training process of leg-amputees, offering easy installation, operation, and maintenance to leg-amputees, and considering the affordability of mid and low income families.",

A BASN consists of multiple interconnected nodes on, near, or within a human body, which together provide sensing, processing, and communication capabilities. Through intelligent computing techniques, a BASN can be enabled to monitor environments, systems, and complex interactions in a range of applications, such as healthcare, fitness, and entertainment. A radio frequency identification (RFID) system is adopted to locate the moving track of patient wearing limb prosthesis, and outputs of the RFID are the relative angular magnitude, location, and elapsed time. The received signal strength indication (RSSI) technique [12] is adopted in this work to compute the transmission distance of RFID based on the information received from RFID. RSSI is a circuit that measures the strength of an incoming radio frequency (RF) signal and generates an output that is equivalent to the signal strength. The ability of the receiver to pick the weakest of signals is referred to as receiver sensitivity. The higher the receiver sensitivity is, the better the link quality is. The circuits are designed to measure the signal strength based on the output voltage. The output voltage is higher if the signal strength is good, and vice versa.",

Coupled with wired or wireless communications, the applications of RFID technology keep increasing in recent years and RFID systems offer many new possibilities and have given rise to new fields aimed at integrating distributed intelligence software applications into our daily lives. Examples of the RFID applications include toll road systems, passports, automobile immobilizer systems, supply-chain management, and animal identification. A so-called location identification based on dynamic active RFID calibration (LANDMARC) was proposed in [13], and the proposed system uses four readers and sixteen active tags to calculate the position of the tracking tag. The advantage of this system is to utilize the concept of the reference tag, and to improve the overall accuracy of positioning. RFID is suitable for short-range wireless transmission because of low-cost, small size, and easy establishment, and it is suitable for indoor positioning system because of having two-way communication function. RFID systems have also been applied increasingly in telemedicine and healthcare facilities to provide medical information and services. The technology offers great potential benefits and it is the next big step to identify and track patients, objects, and assets, and speed up or eliminate many manual operations in checking and processing patients. For example, Alexandra hospital in Singapore adopted an RFID tracking system to monitor all patients, visitors, and staffs entering the hospital during the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreak in 2003. If someone was diagnosed with SARS later, all individuals who contacted the person in the hospital could be immediately identified.",

For example, when the system detects that the trainee's gait step is too large, the system will deliver a message, \u201cPlease slow down your movement\u201d, for the beginner because a trainee tends to be nervous at first. On the other hand, a message such as, \u201cPlease don\u2019t straighten your knees too early. You might get hurt!\u201d, will be offered if a well-trained user walks too fast.

Meanwhile, the performance of the three compared classifiers is about the same.
