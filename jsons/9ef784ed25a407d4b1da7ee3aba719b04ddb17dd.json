When combined with antibody libraries, phage display allows for rapid in vitro selection of antigen-specific antibodies and recovery of their corresponding coding sequence. Large non-immune and synthetic human libraries have been constructed as well as smaller immune libraries based on capturing a single individual's immune repertoire. This completely in vitro process allows for isolation of antibodies against poorly immunogenic targets as well as those that cannot be obtained by animal immunization, thus further expanding the utility of the approach. Phage antibody display represents the first developed methodology for high throughput screening for human therapeutic antibody candidates. Recently, other methods have been developed for generation of fully human therapeutic antibodies, such as single B-cell screening, next-generation genome sequencing and transgenic mice with human germline B-cell genes. While each of these have their particular advantages, phage display has remained a key methodology for human antibody discovery due its in vitro process. Here, we review the continuing role of this technique alongside other developing technologies for therapeutic antibody discovery.",

The CDRs encode unique structural diversity and provide antibodies with the ability to recognize a wide variety of targets. The protective efficacy of an antibody can be achieved through binding alone if it results in neutralization of a function of the target or may require additional immune functions provided by the Fc (crystallizable fragment) portion of the antibody molecule with receptors found on immune cells or complement proteins in serum. Antibody Fc region functionality can trigger or augment a number of different host defence mechanisms including phagocytosis, release of cytotoxic or immunomodulatory biomolecules and the complement cascade and formation of the membrane attack complex. These properties potentially make antibodies extremely potent molecules for therapy and they have been developed into an important class of drugs for the treatment of numerous cancers, autoimmune and infectious diseases (1) .",

Originally developed by Greg Winter et al. at the MRC Laboratory of Molecular Biology and Richard Lerner, Carlos Barbas et al. at Scripps Research institute, the basic concept that a vast antibody repertoire could be displayed on phage with their genetic sequences packaged within has allowed for the robust screening of a variety of target antigens and rapid recovery of specific antibody sequences for recombinant expression (3) (4) (5) .",

As this method by-passes the immune system, the usual factors that influence antibody development and limit diversity based on those that can be isolated in animals are not applicable. As such, antibodies can be isolated against targets that have low immunogenicity in animals (nonproteinaceous antigens), to regions of a protein not usually targeted due to the presence of immunodominant epitopes elsewhere, or to hydrophobic targets that are challenging for in vivo manipulation (9) (10) (11) . As such, phage display offers high potential for discovery of novel therapeutic antibodies that cannot be generated naturally through in vivo immunization or infection. Furthermore, the ability to display synthetic repertoires devoid of any negative selection has made this technique a key method for the generation of potent fully human antibody therapeutics against self-antigens (12). Nixon et al. provide an in-depth review of the clinical development of such drugs (13). Each antibody comprises two heavy and two light chains each of which have four and two immunoglobulin domains, respectively. The first domain is variable and determines specificity (VL and VH) while the second domain of the light chain (CL) and the second to fourth domains of the heavy (CH1-3) are constant across all antibodies of the same isotype. The light chain and first two domains of the heavy chain form the Fab, which is the portion expressed on the phage. The last two domains of the heavy chain form the Fc and are responsible for immune function through engagement of receptors on immune cells. Heavy and light chains are linked through a single disulfide bond (orange) between the CL and CH1 domains and the two heavy chains have multiple disulfide bonds at the hinge region between the CH1 and CH2. An scFv consists of just variable light and variable heavy domains joined by a flexible polypeptide linker while an sdAb as the name implies is only a single immunoglobulin (usually VH) domain which is sufficient for binding. (B) Variable domain genetic structure and construction of a natural phage display library. Each variable domain consists of three hypervariable CDRs interspersed between the more conserved FRs. The immunoglobulin domain folds such that the CDRs are brought together to form the antigen-binding surface at the tip of the Fab. Degenerate primers (arrows) are used to amplify the entire variable heavy and light chains (or alternatively variable and first constant domain) from a source of B cells and cloned in-frame with the phage coat protein (usually gene III) into E. coli to produce an Fab, scFv or sdAb library. The rest of the phage genome is supplied through replication defective helper phage to produce antibody-displaying phage.",

Antigen-bound phage is eluted off either typically through pH change or protease digestion and re-infected into E. coli, from which a new library enriched for antigen-binding clones can be made.

An additional advantage of these libraries is that design features can be incorporated to allow facile affinity maturation, such as CDRs flanked by restriction sites for easy replacement or appropriate consensus primers for targeting of specific CDRs for directed mutagenesis (16) . Several fully human synthetic library-derived mAbs have been approved by the US Food and Drugs Administration or completed clinical trials. The first of these was adalimumab, an anti-TNF-\u03b1 antibody developed by Cambridge Antibody Technologies for the treatment of rheumatic arthritis and Crohn's disease (17, 18) . Subsequently, other antibodies were developed for the treatment of cancer and autoimmune disease such as necitumumab (non-small cell lung cancer), ramucirumab (gastrointestinal cancers) and belimumab (systemic lupus erythematosus) (12, 19, 20) . Many others are currently at advanced stages of clinical development and may reach market approval within the next few years (21, 22) .

In many instances, to simplify construction, only the CDR3 region was fully synthetic. Subsequently, libraries with fully synthetic variable sequences were introduced, with the FR based on consensus sequences from natural antibodies but optimized for high expression on phage in Escherichia coli to reduce the effect of variable expression of the human framework sequences on selection. The first fully synthetic Human Combinatorial Antibody Libraries (HuCAL) generated to produce therapeutic antibodies was reported by Morphosys in 2000 with their first version of the HuCAL (16) . Several versions of the HuCAL has since been constructed that incorporate additional features such as improved phage elution by disulphide bond cleavage, selection for in-frame clones, additional CDR3 loop length and diversity and optimization for expression in mammalian cell culture through removal of unwanted potential post-translational modification sites (25, 26) . These modifications have resulted in an increase in the number of antibodies isolated per target antigen. There are several antibodies generated from the Morphosys libraries currently in various stages of clinical development; a recent example being the potent anti-cancer activity of OMP-18R5, with activity in multiple preclinical human tumour models (27) . This antibody targeting the Wnt pathway was isolated from the HuCAL GOLD library and is currently in Phase 1 clinical testing.",

With this in mind, another approach to build synthetic libraries has been to generate novel variable region sequences by overlapping PCR of individual amplified germline CDRs with respective FR (29) . While allowing generation of novel sequences that target self-antigens, it also prevents the generation of synthetic sequences that could contain high levels of T-cell epitopes and be strongly immunogenic. Indeed, antibodies obtained from this library had a proportion of T-cell epitopes no higher than that of naturally occurring antibodies.

These were raised in animals against inactivated whole bacteria for treatment of severe bacterial infections and each preparation was effective only on bacterial strains with homologous carbohydrate structures (32, 33) . This lead to a realization that antibody recognition of the coat structure was an important correlate for efficacy, and the functional classification of bacteria into serotypes for proper matching of antibody and bacterial strain. The requirement for multiple polyclonal antibodies for treatment of even one bacterial species due to large numbers of serotypes was one of the reasons for the switch to more broadly acting antibiotics once they became available (33) . Nonetheless, their effective use is an indication of the therapeutic potential of non-protein targets.",

Even so, the antibodies obtained can often be low affinity IgM due to the inability to engage the mechanisms required for affinity maturation and class switching, hence limiting the utility of animal immunization for antibody generation (36, 38) . On the other hand, phage display has been used to produce anti-carbohydrate antibodies of reasonable affinity in the low nanomolar range (39) . In particular, a phage library constructed with the heavy chain CDR3 enriched for basic residues to improve binding to negatively charged carbohydrates produced anti-carbohydrate antibodies that had relatively high affinity (K D \u2248 50 nM) and excellent specificity (40) . Although no anti-carbohydrate antibodies have been approved for routine clinical use, such antibodies have been shown to be able to target both carbohydrate-rich tumour antigen and bacterial lipopolysaccharides, the latter having been used on occasion to treat severe cases of sepsis (41, 42) .",

In such cases, the approach is to engineer a specific recognition domain into a particular CDR region which significantly increases the likelihood that the recovered antibody will recognize the modification in addition to the protein epitope (52) . For recognition of phosphorylated peptides, a phosphate-binding motif from a naturally occurring antibody was used to generate a mutant antibody library from which antibodies binding specifically to either phosphoserine, phosphotyrosine or phosphothreonine were identified. The CDR amino acids responsible for phosphorylated amino acid recognition were identified and then used to generate a second set of libraries which preserved these structures but had the rest of the CDR randomized; these libraries were then used to screen phosphorylated peptide targets. A similar strategy was used to identify glycan-binding antibodies based on a motif isolated from the anti-HIV antibody 2G12, which binds the HIV-1 glycoprotein gp120 primarily through its glycosylation (53) .",

Moreover, binding affinity and on and off rates of recovered antibodies can be optimized independently according to the selection strategy employed, enabling tailoring to the desired biomedical application (57, 58) .

This is especially useful for membrane-bound antigen such as cell surface receptors and transmembrane proteins whose structure is not easily recapitulated by free antigen and is particularly useful for tumour-specific surface antigens. However, this approach is complicated by the diversity of antigens on the cell surface which may result in selection of phage against common surface epitopes (59). One means to overcome this is to leverage on unique biological properties of the target antigen. For example, signalling receptors such as HER2, epidermal growth factor receptor and p75 neurotrophin receptor, cycle from the cell surface to the interior and recovery of phage from the cell interior has allowed specific phage enrichment (60) (61) (62) . However, most cell types will carry multiple membrane proteins capable of internalizing bound phage. An alternative and complementary means for selection is to pan against alternating cell types expressing the same target antigen to prevent selection of common surface antigens; this can be achieved through the use of mammalian or yeast expression vectors for expression of recombinant antigen on a suitable host cell (62, 63) .",

The latest state-of-art libraries reach complexities of up to 10 11 -10 12 clones and thus may even exceed the size of individual human cell repertoires (67, 68) . While high-affinity antibodies can be isolated from these libraries, occasionally the affinity of the obtained antibodies is low as the genes are obtained from naive B cells that have not yet undergone affinity maturation. In such cases, where the affinity required for therapeutic efficacy is higher than that of the antibody obtained, in vitro affinity maturation may be performed. This is often accomplished by introducing random or specific mutations in the CDRs or the exchange of whole heavy or light chain domains by chain shuffling (69) (70) (71) (72) (73) . Recently, Li et al. described an alternative phage display approach for affinity maturation of a natural human antibody MSL-109 targeting human cytomegalovirus (CMV), where each of the CDRs was allowed to vary in only one amino acid residue at a time (69) . Higher affinity antibodies were isolated which had improved CMV neutralization potency when expressed as Fab fragments in bacterial cells.",

The most potent antibody was also protective in mice when given before and after lethal H5N1 or H1N1 challenge and the epitope was localized to the highly conserved Therapeutic antibodies from phage display 653 membrane-proximal stem of the HA1 and HA2 subunits of hemagglutinin (84, 85) .",

Antibodies are a natural and well-studied component of the immune system and use of a naturally derived antibody should have minimal side effects and thus be ideal for emergency use. In such a situation, rapid antibody isolation is critical. Phage display allows for the screening of an extremely large collection of antibodies of up to 10 11 sequences, far more than that possible by Next Generation sequencing or single B-cell analysis, thus improving the chance of isolating rare antibodies. Even if an immune library is required, rapid construction and screening is possible using cloning protocols such as MEGAWHOP which do not require prior digestion of PCR immunoglobulin sequences and new panning strategies that enable effective enrichment over only one cycle of selection (102, 103) . In addition, vectors have been developed that can express antibodies both on phage as well as in mammalian cell culture as full length IgG through the use of intron-mediated differential splicing without any need for sub-cloning, which enables rapid highthroughput expression analysis of the full length antibody (104) . As such, phage display is likely to remain a key technique for antibody discovery for the foreseeable future.
