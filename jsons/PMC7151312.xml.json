Local, county, and state governments have implemented policies recommending or requiring broad swaths of the population to stay at home except for essential activities. Not only does this affect our patients, but in many cases it affects our physicians, residents, nurses, technologists, and support staff. Major health systems have already converted many job functions to work-from-home. Outpatient clinics have been closed, and elective or semielective procedures have been postponed or canceled. The Society for Vascular Surgery has released guidance as to which procedures should be postponed.1 We do not yet know how much stress the pandemic will put on the U.S. health care system, but most hospitals and health care systems have wisely adopted a strategy to prepare for the worst.2\n",

The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (through the 1135 waiver) and most major commercial insurance companies have relaxed the restrictions on payment for virtual services during this pandemic.3 Options are now available to conduct virtual visits through various technology options including videoconferencing, smart phones, and even landlines. Outside of health crises, these methods have proven successful in the care of vascular patients.4\n,\n5 Obviously, there are limitations on the information available to the physician. In telehealth, only limited physical examination is possible, even with video services. Even the most basic tools from the vascular clinic, such as blood pressure cuffs, handheld Doppler probes, or physical touch, are not available during virtual visits, but plenty of information is accessible to help maintain our delivery of high-quality care.",

Physical examination, vascular laboratories, and computed tomography are often employed to arrive at a diagnosis, but a thorough history may provide us with much of the same information. A careful history can differentiate neurogenic from vascular claudication, even without palpating pulses. A history can also differentiate limb ischemia from venous congestion for patients complaining of blue toes. A thorough history, with targeted inquiries and follow-up questions, can steer us to the correct diagnosis much of the time.",
