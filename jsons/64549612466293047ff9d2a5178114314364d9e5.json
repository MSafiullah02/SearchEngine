Various stakeholders are responsible for ensuring that patient care is safely delivered and that patients are not harmed, including society overall, patients, clinicians including physicians and nurses, educators, administrators, researchers, professional bodies, governments and legislative bodies, and accrediting agencies [2] .",

However, little is currently known about the concerns of the various healthcare stakeholders. Many modern theorists have quoted empirical evidence from the field of policy studies to suggest that policies and actions J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f are intertwined [5] . However, national policies should actually be created using a bottom-up approach as much as possible. The report from a study of developing the national plan for patient-safety R&D [6] also emphasized the importance of regularly surveying consumers and providers to explore their concerns and interests and their implications for national strategic planning and decision-making. The various healthcare stakeholders define quality of care in different ways. Traditional survey and content analysis, and consensus panel methods with qualitative interviews are used where evidence is sparse or opinions are diverse. These methods require consultation with a large group from a geographically dispersed population, and their credibility is greatly dependent on the sampling method and panel composition [7] .",

The analysis was based on a post-hoc examination of the estimates of topic proportions produced by the model.

The LDAvis tool provided a global view of the topics through their prevalence rates and similarities to each other in a compact space. (Supplement material B) Second, we used a list of social events that attracted social attention during the data collection period. This information was useful as crossreference for determining the social context. For example, when a doctor and the associated hospital were accused of illegal orthopedic surgeries being performed by an unlicensed person, relevant news and social responses increased with concerns about patient safety.

However, the research topics did not reflect these concerns. One possible reason is that hospital infections represent strictly confidential information for each hospital, and so both the size and types of problems are unknown.
