Habitats were classified according to the European Nature Information System (EUNIS) habitat classification (available at http://eunis.eea.eu.int/habitats.jsp) and were then aggregated into woody or herbaceous elements. Three aspects of landscape structure were considered at sample site level: amount of habitat per sample site (percentage woody and herbaceous elements); spatial configuration of woody and herbaceous elements measured with landscape metrics using FRAGSTATS (McGarigal et al. 2002); and habitat diversity (number of EUNIS habitat types per sample site). Since many landscape indices are often correlated, we subjected the following metrics to a principal component analysis (PCA): number of patches, patch density, edge density, proximity index, Euclidean nearest neighbour distance, patch cohesion index, splitting index, and clumpiness index. In order to minimise collinearity, indices were selected according to the highest loadings (\u2223r\u2223>0.74) on the first two PCA\u2010axes which explained together more than 65% of the variance. The selected indices were mean Euclidean nearest neighbour distance and mean proximity index for woody and herbaceous elements. The mean Euclidean nearest neighbour distance denotes the distance from one habitat patch to its nearest neighbour of the same type averaged over the sample site. The proximity index describes the size\u2010weighted distance between habitat patches. Large proximity values indicate landscapes with large patches situated close to each other.",

The species traits were fuzzy coded on a 0 to 3 scale following the approach of Chevenet et al. (1994). Since the fuzzy coded trait data consisted of discrete character states rather than continuous ones, we used fuzzy coded multiple correspondence analysis (MCA; Castella and Speight 1996). The number of relevant factorial axes we retained in the analysis was determined by the scree test (Cattell 1966). Following the MCA, we used the factorial loads at the reduced number of axes to carry out a cluster analysis of the species (using Euclidean distance and Ward\u2010algorithm; Chevenet et al. 1994). Functional groups were then identified based on visual inspections of the resulting dendrograms and ecological sense.",

            "text": "Species richness within each functional group was analysed separately, because previous multivariate analyses of variance (MANOVA; not shown) indicated highly differentiated response patterns. Local species richness per functional group was related to explanatory variables using generalised linear mixed effects models (GLMM) via penalised quasi\u2010likelihood estimation (PQL; Breslow and Clayton 1993). This allowed the sample site effect to be accounted for as a random variable. Thus, local communities (sample point data) were considered to be nested within landscapes (sample sites). Other variables were treated as fixed effects. As species richness data were counts, a Poisson error distribution with a log link function was used in all statistical analyses (Quinn and Keough 2002). We allowed for curvilinear effects of the explanatory variables by incorporating their logarithmic and quadratic terms. In order not to over\u2010parameterise the models, we reduced the set of linear, logarithmic and quadratic terms first. Therefore, we performed single variable regressions of linear, linear and quadratic, and logarithmic terms on species richness per functional group, and included only the most significant term(s) of each variable in the initial models. In case of second order terms, both linear and quadratic terms were used initially. The explanatory variables were standardised to mean zero and unit standard deviation to make the coefficient estimates comparable in terms of importance (Quinn and Keough 2002). The initial models were simplified by stepwise regression, wherein we manually removed variables according to their p\u2010values. Since the penalised quasi\u2010likelihood approach does not calculate true likelihood, likelihood ratio tests and likelihood\u2010based t statistics are not available. Therefore, we did not use measures of model fit for model simplification but relied on p\u2010values and we retained only effects significant at the 0.05 level in the final minimal adequate models. Nevertheless, all final models happened to have also lowest values of Akaike\u2032s information criterion (AIC; Sakamoto et al. 1986). To give an impression about the relative importance of each predictor, we provide their standardised partial regression coefficients.",

The trait variables with the largest contribution to species separation were microsite and food of the larvae, and inundation tolerance. This was indicated by high correlation ratios of these traits with the first four factorial axes (Table 3). The number of generations per year and body size had at least higher than average correlation ratios with some axes, while migratory status and flight period showed low correlation with all axes, thus contributing little to species separation.",

For instance, different functional relevance is obvious for two groups of zoophagous species: The environmental factors affecting large, long lived species living on trees (group 4) differed considerably from that affecting species that are medium sized, short living and living in the herb layer (group 6). Recently effort has been made to objectively establish functional groups using multivariate methods (Simberloff and Dayan 1991, Munoz and Ojeda 1998, Pillar 1999). Considering resource traits, niche characteristics, and response type in a multivariate ordination seems proper since it resulted in clearly separated functional groups that responded to changes in land use in specific ways. The functional groups well represented the degree of specialisation, dispersal ability, and resource use: Two groups comprised mainly rare and low dispersing saprophagous specialists that were separated by different larval micro habitats; two groups of intermediate degree of specialisation consisted of mainly common phytophagous and zoophagous species also separated by larval micro habitat requirements; and further two groups embraced very common, highly mobile generalists that were separated by larval feeding style and larval micro habitat.",

However, we could show that this decrease in species richness is not evenly distributed across functional groups but depends on their characteristics. Several studies indicate that factors at the landscape scale affect arthropods differently depending upon the degree of specialisation and dispersal abilities (Hanski and Gilpin 1997, Jonsen and Fahrig 1997, Golden and Crist 1999). Specialists may need to move between habitat patches to acquire specific resources, and could be significantly affected by landscape\u2010scale factors that inhibit dispersal. Generalists are more likely to find sufficient resources within a patch compared to specialists and, if highly mobile, they may perceive a fragmented landscape as sufficiently connected (Thomas 2000). Our study shows that this may also apply to entire functional groups which are dominated by species of a certain degree of specialisation or mobility. Hoverfly species richness within generalistic and highly mobile groups is more or less unaffected by any environmental variable at any spatial scale. Large scale gradients, land\u2010use intensity, landscape structure, or local habitat features have very limited, if any, effects, indicating a potential compensation of adverse environmental conditions in intensively used agricultural landscapes by dispersal and/or niche breadth.",

Hence, even well structured landscapes could not prevent those groups from the negative effects of high land\u2010use intensity. The additional positive effect of habitat diversity at the landscape and local scale points to the great dependence of these species on (micro) habitat type and quality (Maibach and Goeldlin de Tiefenau 1994, Rotheray and MacGowan 2000, Rotheray et al. 2001). The importance of local habitat features and the lack of any evidence of large scale geographical structuring are most likely related to their rarity. Since rare species tend to be rare everywhere, their low numbers might prevent a detection of spatial structuring either at the European or at the landscape scale.",

However, the assumption that species richness affects the risk of extinction for a particular functional group was not supported by our analysis. The two most species rich groups (35 and 25 species; both with intermediate levels of specialisation and common species) were at a comparable risk of extinction as the two species poorest groups (15 and 11 species; both with predominantly specialised and rare species), while the unaffected groups of generalists contained intermediate numbers of species (22 and 18 species). In contrast to most experimental and simulation studies that are based on random extinction patterns or random draws from a species pool, our study on natural communities indicates non\u2010random trait\u2010dependent patterns of species extinction. Our findings are in accordance with recent studies which report that trait\u2010dependent extinction causes greater than random loss of functional diversity (Petchey and Gaston 2002). This suggests that the theoretically and experimentally found evidence for insurance of functional diversity against environmental change due to species richness and redundancy must not necessarily apply to natural conditions. If particular environmental pressures act in a selective way they may cause trait\u2010dependent extinction. Under such preconditions, the risk of losing a functional group merely depends on group characteristics such as dispersal and niche breadth rather than on species richness. These findings add to theoretical and other observational studies that found little evidence for a causal relationship between function and diversity but rather suggest that it is the specific features of the species that determine its function (Grime 1997, Wardle et al. 1997, Hooper and Vitousek 1997, Bengtsson 1998).",

            "text": "Our results show that species extinction in response to environmental pressures such as increasing land use is not random but depends on species traits related to resource or dispersal limitation. Functional groups wherein such traits are accumulated are at higher risk of extinction. This increased risk of extinction seems to depend little on the species richness within a particular group. There is general acceptance that \u2018biodiversity per se is a good thing and that its loss is bad\u2019 (Gaston 1996), but from our results we infer that high species richness within functional groups alone is no guarantee for maintaining functional richness. Even species rich groups can easily become extinct when particular environmental pressures affect their members in a similar manner. According to the insurance hypothesis (Lawton and Brown 1994), species of the same functional group perform the same ecological function, but should be as different as possible otherwise in order to buffer the impacts of different environmental pressures (Walker et al. 1999). When the members of a functional group are very similar in at least one aspect (which might also be the function they perform), environmental pressures that act on this very aspect might become group specific key factors that decide over maintaining or losing a whole functional group. For instance, increased pesticide application leads to the loss of specialised saprophagous hoverflies living on water plants (group 1), or increasing fragmentation of woody elements leads to the loss of intermediate specialised zoophages living on trees and their root zone (group 4). Thus, it is not species richness per se that improves insurance of functional diversity against environmental pressures but the degree of dissimilarity within each functional group in response to selective causes of extinction. These selective, trait\u2010dependent causes of extinction may not only result in rapid loss of functional diversity, but they have the potential to reduce this diversity faster than most often assumed and tested random extinction patterns (Petchey and Gaston 2002). Therefore, future studies should not only focus on overall species richness and random extinction patterns but also consider phylogenetic, morphologic, or general ecological trait similarity and trait\u2010dependent extinction.",
