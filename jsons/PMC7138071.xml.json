The association of viral detection with clinical characteristics at admission and resulting outcomes was explored as secondary objectives.",

Although this may have been only an effect of the small sample size, other studies have found similar results.6, 21, 29 The main hypothesis raised by some of these authors is that the presence of previous acquired non-protective antibodies in older children and young adults might lead to a cross-reaction with the H1N1 virus, which could lead to immunecomplex formation and severe lung disease.29 Smaller children would have a less robust immune response to H1N1 virus, preventing progression to immune-mediated lung disease.21 Another possible explanation would be an earlier and more aggressive treatment in younger children, because they are a risk group.21\n",
