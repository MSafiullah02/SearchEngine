Therefore, the moderate levels of mRNA and protein of c\u2010myc must be tightly regulated and maintained through a very short half\u2010life in cells [Levens, 2003]. Many transcription factors are involved in the control of c\u2010myc promoter activity such as NF\u2010\u03baB [Weber et al., 2005], Notch1 intracellular domain [Rao and Kadesch, 2003; Satoh et al., 2004; Klinakis et al., 2006; Palomero et al., 2006; Sharma et al., 2006; Weng et al., 2006; Liao et al., 2007], MBP\u20101, and \u03b1\u2010enolase [Ray and Miller, 1991; Chaudhary and Miller, 1995; Ray, 1995; Feo et al., 2000; Subramanian and Miller, 2000; Hsu et al., 2008].

However, expressions of c\u2010myc mRNA and protein are only enhanced about 4\u2010fold by Notch1 receptor intracellular domain in K562 cells. Furthermore, it was documented that Notch signaling may have different target genes in distinct cell types [Neves et al., 2006; Weerkamp et al., 2006].
