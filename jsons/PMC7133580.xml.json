She also showed courage to take on the member states as she pressed for major reform of WHO's organisational and governance structures. Despite strong opposition from the tobacco industry, she paved the way for the negotiations for the Framework Convention on Tobacco Control, the world's first evidence-based global health treaty. Importantly, she had the vision to place WHO on a firm knowledge foundation by establishing the evidence-informed policy cluster.",

In the face of strong opposition from the pharmaceutical industry, he showed the courage and conviction of the moral high ground WHO held by supporting the establishment of the International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP).3 He showed integrity in acknowledging the weaknesses of WHO guidelines and acted accordingly to substantially improve the process into one that is strongly evidence-based today, and also led the negotiations for the much needed revision of the three-decade old International Health Regulations.",
