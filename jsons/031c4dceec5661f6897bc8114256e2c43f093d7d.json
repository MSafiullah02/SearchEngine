Recommendations regarding preparation for a global avian influenza pandemic are available, and it is imperative that health care workers participate in preparedness planning and training. In developing countries, health care worker preparedness training should address the modes of avian influenza transmission and specify how to implement appropriate infectioncontrol strategies to prevent and control the spread of avian influenza. We provide evidence for avian influenza transmission methods and identify prevention strategies relevant to infection control for hospitals in developing countries. Pandemic influenza preparedness plans must include health care administrative support, mechanisms to rapidly create temporary isolation facilities, systems to restrict access to exposed health care workers, and plans to involve specialists to screen and identify cases early, to provide for continuous monitoring to ensure adherence to optimal infection-control practices, and to provide regular feedback to health care workers.",

One in every 100 individuals with influenza is expected to be hospitalized, and 7 million people will potentially die within a few months [1] [2] [3] . The ongoing avian influenza (H5N1 infection) epidemic poses significant risks to both humans and animals [4] [5] [6] [7] . The potential exists for cross-species transmission to humans and subsequent reassortment of avian and human influenza viruses in coinfected individuals [8] . Pandemic influenza planning and worldwide surveillance are key factors in mounting an effective global preparedness strategy for avian influenza [9] . Although recommendations for hospital infection control for avian influenza are available [10] , adopting these recommendations has been an issue in developing countries. Because infection-control resources, including infrastructure and personal protective equipment (PPE), may vary considerably in different settings, hospital policy-makers in developing countries need to make decisions regarding the use of infectioncontrol resources on the basis of disease prevalence, local priorities, personnel availability, and financial constraints. It is, therefore, important for health care workers (HCWs), who in many cases serve as first responders (i.e., may triage and eval-uate an index case), to understand the dynamics of avian influenza transmission and to recognize the appropriate infection-control strategies recommended for the prevention and control of avian influenza.",

To date, animal-to-human transmission is thought to be the predominant mode of avian influenza acquisition in humans [12, 13] . Risk factors include plucking and preparing ill birds, handling cocks for fighting events and tourism, playing with poultry, consumption of duck blood or undercooked poultry, and exposure to live poultry within 1 week prior to the onset of illness [11, 12] . Interestingly, interspecies transmission of avian influenza viruses has occurred in experimental settings from chickens to tigers, chickens to leopards, and chickens to domestic cats [14] [15] [16] . Human-to-human transmission of avian influenza has occurred via intimate contact without the use of barrier precautions but has not occurred from casual, social contact [17] . Serological studies of avian influenza among exposed HCWs, household contacts, and poultry cullers suggest that human-to-human transmission to date has been inefficient and that antibodies may develop in asymptomatic, exposed persons [13, [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] . Albeit rare, probable human-to-human transmission of H5N1 virus has been reported in several household clusters [8, 22] .",

The recommendation to routinely use N95 respirators during an influenza pandemic is complicated by several factors. First, N95 respirators require fit testing. Once tested, any individual must use only the brand and size of respirator for which they have been certified. During a pandemic, it is likely that supplies of respirators may be limited, and supply chains may become disrupted. Therefore, it will be difficult to provide the appropriate size of respirator for each HCW. Also, the large number of N95 respirators marketed will make the stockpiling of appropriate numbers and sizes of respirators logistically difficult. The reproducibility of fit testing over time has been questioned [23] , and prolonged use of N95 respirators has been shown to cause headaches [24] and facial discomfort [25] and may result in hypoxemia [26] . Poor compliance or incorrect use of an N95 respirator may negate any potential benefit that might be gained from their use. Therefore, pandemic influenza plans in developing countries might have to take these realities into consideration and use a more risk-based stratification approach to address droplet and contact precautions versus airborne and contact precautions.",

Viral shedding of influenza in adults can extend for 7 days after symptom onset and for weeks in infants and immunocompromised individuals. This makes environmental control of influenza even more difficult in health care facilities. Thus, the initial specific protection of HCWs will need to include available antiviral agents (e.g., oseltamivir and zanamivir) for chemoprophylaxis and treatment. A recently proposed university hospital-based preparedness plan has recommended the stockpiling of oseltamivir [29] . There are 4 potential strategies for using antiviral agents during an influenza outbreak [30, 31] : chemoprophylaxis for the entire influenza outbreak and season, postexposure chemoprophylaxis, treatment of ill patients, and a combination of chemoprophylaxis and treatment. Several studies support the use of prophylactic viral agents [31] [32] [33] [34] [35] . Furthermore, a model of the 1957-1958 Asian influenza pandemic predicted that 8 weeks of antiviral prophylaxis for close contacts of index case patients would have reduced the attack rate from 33% to 2% [36] . Thus, targeted prophylaxis for HCWs and patients would likely mean administering 6-8 weeks of prophylaxis to all vulnerable groups. Although attractive, this strategy is prohibitively expensive for most hospitals and other health care facilities in both developed and developing countries. Furthermore, widespread, long-term use of antiviral prophylaxis could promote antiviral resistance. An alternative strategy that focuses on the treatment of ill HCWs, with some targeted prophylaxis of heavily exposed HCWs, would be more financially feasible. This strategy would provide for treatment of those HCWs directly caring for patients with influenza during a pandemic. Recent studies have reported that neuraminidase inhibitors administered within 48 h of symptom onset decrease the duration of illness and viral shedding, the incidence of hospitalization, antibiotic use, and mortality [35, 37, 38] . Health care workers should be tracked and monitored for influenza-like illness (e.g., myalgia and fever). It is likely that such monitoring would identify most of the ill HCWs and, thus, allow timely administration of antiviral therapy. Despite these recommendations, health care facilities in developing countries may find it difficult to imple- ment antiviral therapy because of the associated high cost.",

Some hospitals controlled the outbreak by having designated SARS teams and geographically separate wards for patient triage, patients with confirmed SARS cases, and patients without SARS [43] . During an avian influenza outbreak, some hospitals in Thailand performed surveillance for avian influenza among all patients who were admitted to the intensive care unit with severe community-acquired pneumonia [44, 45] . The estimated annual cost for avian influenza screening in a Thai hospital was $7375 [44] . These studies reported a low detection rate for avian influenza (3 cases among 5496 patients).

Exhaust fans could be installed above windows in each room if isolation rooms with negative pressure ventilation are unavailable. At least 1 m of distance should be placed between patients to reduce the risk of cross-transmission through respiratory droplets. Although creation of a temporary isolation ward seems to be attractive during an epidemic, it is important to realize that the ward designated for temporary isolation should have separate entrance and exit pathways for HCWs and patients, and a one-way entrance and one-way exit should be designated for patients, to minimize problems involving cross-contamination (figure 1).",
