            "text": "Diagnostic virology is the process in which the viral etiologic cause of infection is identified from a patient's clinical sample. In the past, diagnostic virology relied on three classical techniques to make this diagnosis of viral infection: (a) virus isolation by direct virus cultivation, (b) viral antigen detection, and (c) indirect detection of virus-specific antibodies. While the remaining important tools are utilized by diagnostic virology laboratories today, these techniques are time-consuming and require specific reagents/methods such as cultivation media, cell or tissue cultures, antibodies, or purified antigens. In the past several decades, the number of new molecular-based methods increased rapidly and became widely used in diagnostic virology laboratories. The core of these techniques constitutes of techniques based on nucleic acid detection by specific amplification, hybridization, and/or sequencing (reviewed in [1] ). The majority of these nucleic acid-based diagnostic methods are simple, speedy, sensitive, and specific and thus meet the gold \"four-S standard\" for their application in any diagnostic laboratory. The methods are simple and speedy because only a specific primer pair and a PCR machine are required by the laboratory, and identification of a viral pathogen takes only a few hours. They are sensitive and specific and require only a small amount of patient's clinical specimen to detect a specific nucleotide sequence region. In general, these techniques can be used to detect almost all types of viral pathogens and can even identify multiple viral pathogens or their variants at the same time. In this chapter, we will focus on detection of viral RNA splicing as a new tool for diagnostic virology. ",

            "text": "RNA splicing was discovered 40 years ago by Susan Berget [2] and Louise Chow [3] ; these investigators mapped adenovirus transcription and identified intervening sequences (introns) in type 2 adenovirus primary transcripts. Subsequently, RNA splicing was recognized as an essential nuclear event for mammalian gene expression and for virus replication of almost all DNA viruses and some RNA viruses. Most mammalian genes consist of multiple segments called exons which are separated by noncoding or intervening sequences named introns. Genes which are composed of exons and introns are \"split\" genes. After transcription, a nascent or primary transcript (pre-mRNA) contains both exons and introns. The introns are removed from the pre-mRNA by a molecular process called \"RNA splicing\" resulting in production of spliced mature mRNA. RNA splicing takes place both in coding as well as in noncoding primary transcripts. RNA splicing has been considered a posttranscriptional event; however, recent studies have demonstrated that RNA splicing often occurs co-transcriptionally [4, 5] . Only those transcripts which are fully processed are eventually exportable from the nucleus to the cytoplasm for protein synthesis.",

            "text": "All introns are defined by three cis-elements: a 5' splice site (donor site), a branch point, and a 3' splice site (acceptor site) with a polypyrimidine track immediately upstream (Fig. 1a) . These cis-elements allow cellular splicing machinery to recognize and remove the intron from pre-mRNA. Most mammalian introns start with GU dinucleotide on its 5' end and an AG dinucleotide on its 3' end (\"GU-AG\" introns). The GU-AG pairs are conserved sequences and define the exon-intron boundaries. Introns with an AU on its 5' end and an AC on its 3' end are rare, and this set of the introns are known as \"AU-AC\" introns [6, 7] . The presence of splice Fig. 1 (continued) These initial recognitions of the intron elements by the components of RNA splicing machinery are essential for spliceosome formation on a pre-mRNA, leading to intron removal. (b) RNA splicing is catalyzed by two transesterification reactions. During RNA splicing, the intron (gray) between two exons (black) is removed by two transesterification reactions. First, the intron is recognized by cellular splicing machinery via splicing factors binding to intron-specific sequences as described in (a). Splicing factors carry out the first transesterification reaction between the branch point and the 5' donor site, resulting of an RNA cleavage at the 5' donor site and releasing exon 1 and formation of a lariat intermediate. Subsequently, the free 3'end OH group of exon 1 attacks the 5' end phosphate of exon 2 and joins with the 5' end of exon 2 via the second transesterification reaction to form a mature mRNA. Intron is removed in the form of lariat structure and quickly degraded . An intron is defined by several specific sequence motifs which allow intron recognition by cellular splicing machinery. A 5' splice site or donor site GU at the intron 5' end is recognized by U1 small nuclear ribonucleoprotein (snRNP), a major component of the cellular splicing machinery. A 3' splice site or acceptor site at the intron 3' end consists of an AG dinucleotide, an upstream polypyrimidine track (PPT) and a further upstream branch point, which are recognized correspondently by U2AF35, U2AF65, and U2 snRNP.",

All introns must contain an additional element called a \"branch point,\" which is located 20-50 nts upstream from the 3'splice site, and have a consensus sequence CU(A/C)A(C/U) where A is a most conserved base. The sequence between the branch point and the acceptor site is a run of 15-40 pyrimidines (mostly U) and is referred to as a \"polypyrimidine track.\" RNA splicing is catalyzed by cellular splicing machinery, which consists of the following components: (1) small nuclear ribonucleoproteins (snRNPs, U1, U2, U4, U5, and U6) and (2) splicing factors. During the initial step, snRNP, U1, and U2 recognize the intron sequences at the 5' splice site and the branch point via complementary base-pairing involving the U2 accessory proteins U2AF65 and U2AF35, which associate with the polypyrimidine track and 3'splice site, respectively (Fig. 1a) . Intron recognition is a signal for the formation of a large protein complex called the \"spliceosome\" where intron removal takes place [8, 9] by two transesterification reactions (Fig. 1b) . First, the primary transcript is cleaved at the intron 5' end (5' splice site) to leave the upstream exon free; this step is followed by branching of the cleaved intron 5' end to the branch point (usually A) to create a looped structure named \"lariat intermediate\". In the second step, the hydroxyl group of the free exon attacks the intron 3' splice site leading to the 3' splice site cleavage and lariat formation. Simultaneously, a covalent bond is created between two exons to create a mature mRNA. In general, the lariats are quickly released from the spliceosome and degraded in the nucleus.",

As described above, the level of conservation of the sequences at the splice sites and the branch point will affect the strength of the binding of core splicing factors and thus determine the splicing efficiency. RNA splicing is also modulated by a large family of cellular splicing factors containing serine-arginine-rich proteins (SR proteins) and heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoproteins (hnRNPs). Most of the splicing factors that are differentially expressed in a specified tissues and/or in a development stage are the RNA-binding proteins, which bind to specific RNA ciselement (splicing enhancers or silencers) located within introns and exons [10] . It is now well documented that splicing factors binding to the cis-elements either increase or decrease RNA splicing efficiency depending on the type of splicing factors, the positions of the binding sites, and the overall spliceosome composition [11, 12] . Current studies demonstrate that in addition to splicing factors, other processes such as RNA polymerase rate and chromatin structure also affect RNA splicing [13, 14] .",

Consequently, this alternative RNA splicing leads to the production of RNA isoforms with different exon compositions and production of different protein isoforms. In general, there are four major classes of alternative RNA splicing (Fig. 2) , including exon skipping, intron retention, usage of alternative exons, and usage of alternative 5' and alternative 3' splice site [15] . In addition, alternative promoter or polyadenylation usage can further complicate the alternative RNA splicing. The reason why some of the exons or introns in a pre-mRNA are alternatively spliced is either because of the presence of weak or suboptimal splice signals in the pre-mRNA or due to the lack of a particular splicing factor. It has been noticed that usage of weak splice sites is highly dependent on auxiliary splicing factors binding to the regulatory cis-elements. Since the expression of these factors is variable from cell to cell and from tissue to tissue, alternative RNA splicing is often associated with a specific cell type, tissue, or stage of cell differentiation [16] ; this results in the production of various isoforms of transcripts from one gene [17] . Current analysis also revealed that the number of genes with alternative RNA splicing increases with complexity of the organism and ranges from 0.05% in yeast up to 66.8% in human. Thus, alternative RNA splicing is the driving force behind the complexity of the proteome in higher organisms in addition to the total number of the mapped genes.",

First, RNA molecules isolated from samples are separated based on their size by electrophoresis in agarose or polyacrylamide gel. After transfer to a nitrocellulose or nylon membrane, the individual RNA transcripts are detected by an antisense probe specific for the detecting RNA. The probes used for the Northern blot are usually labeled with 32 P isotope, enzyme (e.g., alkaline phosphatase), digoxigenin (DIG), or biotin and can be derived from a constitutive exon or an exon-exon junction (Fig. 3a) . Constitutive exon-based probes would detect all spliced RNA isoforms and the remaining, unspliced pre-mRNA; these exon-based probes are recommended when the size difference between spliced RNA isoforms and unspliced pre-mRNA is sufficient enough to be separated. If the size difference is too small for two RNA isoforms to be distinguished, an exon junction probe can be used to specifically detect a spliced product. In addition, a specific probe from an alternative exon or intron can be also designed for detection of individual splicing isoforms derived from exon/intron inclusion.

In this diagram, the probe remains intact when binding to the pre-mRNA, while the probe binding to the spliced mRNA (lack of the intron) will cause the digestion of the probe intron region (single stranded) resulting in production of smaller protected products corresponding to each exon",

As a result, the probe protected by the corresponding exon regions of the detecting mRNA is shorter and will run faster in the gel (Fig. 3b) . In general, RPA is more sensitive than Northern blot in detection of RNA splicing. Both Northern blot and RPA are commonly used in research laboratories. Their main advantage is high specificity. However, both methods are very laborious and low-throughput requiring isolation of large amount (usually a few micrograms) of the total RNA from samples and preparation of specific probes often labeled with radioisotopes, which limits their use in clinical diagnostics.",

The most common approach is the amplification over the intron regions by a set of primers in flanking exons. The resulted RT-PCR products vary in sizes depending on how the detecting transcript is spliced. A larger product than the predicted size may represent an unspliced pre-mRNA, or contaminating genomic DNA. The latter can be determined by a minus RT amplification (PCR). A spliced mRNA always gives a smaller RT-PCR product than its pre-mRNA due to removal of intron sequences by RNA splicing (Fig. 4a) . Another approach is to specifically amplify a spliced product by using an exon junction primer because the sequence at exon-exon junction is not present in pre-mRNA, nor in genomic DNA. Similarly, a primer based on an alternative exon would amplify only the transcript with the inclusion of that exon (Fig. 4b) . After amplification, the size and amount of RT-PCR products are analyzed by gel electrophoresis. Because of nonlinear nature of PCR amplification, classical PCR only provides semiquantitative data on the abundance of various spliced RNA isoforms.",

The principles of these different (a) A pair of primers (Pr1 and Pr2) used for amplification are derived from two constitutive exons (black boxes) over an intron (solid line), and the amplified mRNA product (spliced) will be smaller in size than the products amplified from template DNA or unspliced pre-mRNA. In an alternative RNA splicing assay, a pair of primers is derived from exon 1 and exon 3 spanning over alternative exon 2 (gray box). Alternative RNA splicing will result in multiple-spliced RNA products of various sizes amplified by RT-PCR. (b) Specific amplification of spliced RNA products during constitutive or alternative RNA splicing. The specific splicing products could be obtained by using a set of primers in which one represents a splicing junction (Pr1). Because of the lack of this sequence in unspliced pre-mRNA or DNA, only the spliced product will be selectively amplified. A selective amplification could be also used to amplify by RT-PCR a specific RNA isoform derived by alternative RNA splicing by using one primer in an alternative exon (exon 2) in combination with a primer in exon 3. In this case, only the spliced product with exon 2 inclusion will be selectively amplified by RT-PCR detection chemistries are described in Fig. 5 . As of today, SYBR green and TaqMan TM probes represent the most common detection chemistries. SYBR green is a fluorescent dye which has low fluorescence when in solution; however, it becomes highly fluorescent upon binding to double-stranded DNA. On the other hand, TaqMan TM probes, Molecular Beacons, and Scorpions probes employ fluores- . The mechanism of each chemistry is described in detail in the chapter section III-in the corresponding chapter. The sections are not numbered anymore. Double lines represent a double-stranded DNA template generated by RT-PCR, while a single line is correspondent to single-stranded DNA. Horizontal arrows mark primer (Pr1 and Pr2) positions. F stands for quenched \"fluorophore moiety\" and could be present in two stages: quenched nonfluorescent stage (empty circles) or in activated stage (empty circles with spikes) with generation of detectable signal. Q in black circles represents \"quencher.\" Scorpion probes contain amplification stop sequences named \"blocker\" (B in black box) cence resonance energy transfer or F\u00f6rster resonance energy transfer (FRET, also known as resonance energy transfer [RET] or electronic energy transfer [EET]) to generate a fluorescent signal. The FRET combines the donor fluorescent dye (fluorophore) with a nonfluorescent quenching moiety (quencher). When the fluorescent dye is in close proximity of the quencher, the quencher molecule absorbs the energy and thus blocks fluorescence emission from the fluorophore when excited by light. TaqMan probes are 18-22 bp oligonucleotide probes that are labeled with a reporter fluorophore at the 5' end and a quencher at the 3' end; these are thus in close proximity. Each probe is complementary to a region in the middle of the detecting target between the two primers used in the PCR reaction. When Taq polymerase extends the primer to synthesize the nascent strand, the 5' to 3' exonuclease activity of the Taq polymerase degrades the TaqMan TM probe annealed to the targeted region and releases the fluorophore from TaqMan TM probe and thereby breaks the close proximity to the quencher. As a result, the fluorophore when excited by cycler's light emits fluorescence, which marks the presence of PCR product. The method determines the amount of product by generation of fluorescent signal, which is measured in \"real time\" during the entire cycle time of the RT-PCR reaction, which allows the calculation of the amount of PCR product after each amplification cycle. Similar to TaqMan TM , the Molecular Beacon and the Scorpions TM both use probes to detect specific PCR product. However, instead of probe degradation, the signal is generated by physical separation of the fluorophore and quenching moieties after hybridization of the specific probe to the PCR product during amplification (Fig. 5 ).",

In contrast, TaqMan TM , Molecular Beacons, and Scorpions TM probes specifically detect only a PCR product complementary to probe sequence enabling to distinguish specific from non-specific products. The disadvantage of these detection chemistries is that each PCR product requires synthesis of its own specific probe, which increases the cost per reaction.

In tiling arrays, the set of overlapping probes cover the full length of the nascent primary transcript including exons and introns. The analysis of fluorescence for each probe allows the identification of exons and introns based on the difference in signal intensity (Fig. 6bi) . The advantage of tiling arrays is their ability to identify known splice . When bound to unspliced transcript, the binding sites of two probes are separated by intron preventing energy transfer by FRET, and thus, no signal is generated. After intron removal by RNA splicing, two probes are bought to proximity for FRET to occur. The energy transfer from the donor to the acceptor leads to excitation of the acceptor fluorophore (A in circle with spikes) and generation of detectable signal. The diagram is modified from Blanco and Artero [31] events as well as new splice events. Therefore, the tiling arrays are often used as discovery tools. The disadvantages are the requirement of a large amount of probes, which results in time-consuming data analysis. The exon arrays are more commonly used but require the knowledge of splicing events. Several types of probes hybridizing to flanking exons, intron, and exon-exon junctions are designed to detect each splicing event (Fig. 6bii) . The fluorescence intensity is detected for each probe, and a mathematical model is applied to determine the occurrence of splicing event. The advantage of exon arrays is the smaller number of probes required, which means simpler data analysis. However, the exon arrays detect only known or predicted splicing variants. Due to their large capacities, the exon arrays can be designed to detect splicing in multiple viral pathogens simultaneously.",

            "text": "Tissue sections historically represent an important tool for the diagnosis of pathological changes during viral infection as well as the detection of viral pathogens at the cellular level. There are two major types of tissue sections: frozen and formalinfixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE). Both are routinely used for the detection of viral antigens by various types of staining, but their use in the detection of nucleic acids including spliced transcripts is still relatively rare. The improved sensitivity of current nucleic acid isolation and amplification techniques allows the recovery of nucleic acid from tissue sections for further analysis by PCR and RT-PCR with selective isolation of only the cells of interest by the use of laser capture microdissection to add an additional level of specificity [23, 24] . However, the detection of nucleic acids by in situ hybridization (ISH) directly on tissue sections can provide additional information about gene expression linked with spatial distribution of specific RNA transcripts in a morphological context often at the cellular or even subcellular level. In the past, the nucleic acid molecules including RNA transcripts by ISH were detected by DNA probes labeled with radioisotope ( 35 S, 33 P, 3 H) [25] , which were later replaced by nonradioactive DNA probes labeled with biotin or digoxigenin and detected by chromogenic methods using enzyme-labeled antibodies (CISH) [26] . Labeling probes specific for different transcripts with different fluorophores (FISH) allows detection of multiple targets at the same tissue section. However, the sensitivity was always a limiting factor of ISH techniques. This was caused mainly by the use of DNA probes, which suffer from low affinity to complementary RNA targets and are sensitivity to degradation of RNA-DNA hybrids by RNase H. Development of tyramide signal amplification (TSA) has dramatically improved the sensitivity of DNA probes [27] . Further improvement was seen with the introduction of locked nucleic acid (LNA) and peptide nucleic acid (PNA) probes with high affinity to RNA molecules and resistance to RNase H degradation [28] [29] [30] . Detection of RNA splicing by ISH requires a probe to specifically bind only to spliced mRNA without binding to unspliced pre-mRNA or to the genomic DNA in the sample. Historically, this was achieved by designing a probe over exonexon junction containing sequences present only in spliced transcripts (Fig. 6ci ). Another approach in the detection of spliced transcripts by IHS is using co-hybridization of two probes labeled with donor and acceptor fluorophore and the generation of signals by FRET. In principle, each splicing event is monitored by a set of two probes complementary to exonic sequences flanking an intron region. One probe carries a fluorophore acceptor, while the second probe is labeled by a fluorophore donor. When probes bind to genomic DNA or unspliced nascent transcript, their binding sites are separated by intron regions resulting in the distance between the donor and acceptor being too big for the two fluorophores to engage in FRET. However, intron removal by splicing brings the probe binding sites to a proximity close enough for FRET to occur resulting in generation of measurable fluorescence [31] (Fig. 6cii ).This results in high specificity and low background. Using a set of probes with different fluorophores allows detection of multiple spliced transcripts or various spliced isoforms of the transcript. In summary, ISH hybridization methods provide a useful tool for the investigation of the distribution not only of protein-encoding transcripts but also of the rapidly growing number of virusencoded noncoding RNAs, which their role in viral pathogenesis often remains elusive [32] . In situ hybridization methods could be especially suitable in retrospective analysis of archived samples in collections.",

Currently the main platforms are the Illumina HiSeq 2500 or HiSeq 3000/HiSeq4000 for high-throughput sequencing and generating the sequencing reads of various lengths. Sequencing of RNA samples converted to cDNA is called RNA-seq. RNA-seq provides a comprehensive picture of whole genome transcriptome and has been successfully used for analysis on gene expression and posttranscriptional processing including RNA splicing. However, NGS may be costly and time-consuming as well as requiring sophisticated data analysis; this currently makes NGS less suitable for clinical diagnostics. However, RNA-seq does not require any prior knowledge of detecting sequence composition and therefore allows detecting unknown or unpredicted RNA sequences. This may be especially beneficial in discovery of new pathogens including viruses [34] .

While detection of viral genomes in clinical samples indicates virus infection, the result does not provide information about the stage and dynamic of the virus infection. In many cases the progress of viral replication can be assumed from changes in viral load, but this approach requires multiple sampling during infection and varies between individuals. One major advantage for detection of spliced viral transcripts is that viral RNA splicing reflects viral gene expression and thus indicates active viral infection, providing important information about the status of infection without requiring multiple sampling. The production of viral transcripts and their RNA splicing products are often the first sign of virus replication detectable before the increase of viral load or occurrence of viral-specific antigens or antibodies. Therefore, the detection of active viral infection by RNA splicing may be particularly important for early diagnosis of viral infection and may be critical for successful treatment. Because of direct association of spliced viral transcripts with the level of active viral replication and by monitoring viral RNA, one might be able to provide essential information early enough for initiation of antiviral therapy. A rapid shutoff of viral transcription and RNA splicing could be also the first sign of the blockage of viral replication visible even before the change in viral load by genome copy numbers. In the case of ubiquitous and common viruses, such as members of herpesvirus or parvovirus family, which establish latent infection in the host, detection of RNA splicing of a viral early gene would assist to distinguish viral latent infection from active lytic infection. Such a diagnosis is critical for recipients of the transplant organs where reactivation of latent viruses often leads to transplant rejection.",

The number of segments may vary between virus species, with influenza viruses A and B genome having eight segments and influenza C seven segments. In contrast to the majority of RNA viruses, the influenza viruses replicate in the nucleus of host cells because of their dependence on cellular expression machinery [37] . During replication, the viral RNAs are produced by viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase. However, viral RNA genomes use short sequences with a cap structure generated by host RNA polymerase II for priming to initiate viral transcription.

Multiplespliced transcripts of the 2-kb family are expressed in the early stage of virus infec- tion and express tat, rev, and nef. This group of spliced RNAs is produced by using the 3' splice site A3-A5 located in the central part of the viral genome with an A3 site for expression of tat, A4a-c for rev, and A5 splice site for nef proteins. During late stage of HIV infection, nuclear import and accumulation of tat together with rev protein allow the rev protein to bind to a rev-responsive element (RRE) in partially spliced 4-kb and unspliced 9-kb RNA transcripts located in the tat/rev intron between the D4 and A7 splice sites; this rev protein mediates the export of later transcripts into the cytoplasm for translation [53] (Fig. 8c) . Sites A1A and D1A are involved in pre-mRNA stability [54] . Strains from the IIIB family of HIV viruses use additional A6 and D5 splice sites to generate a small exon in the env region; transcripts containing this exon express the tripartite tat-env-rev fusion protein, tev [55, 56] . Regulation of HIV RNA splicing depends on the selection of 3' splice sites, which are, in general, weak in contrast to stronger and highly active 5' splice sites. In addition, numerous positive and negative splicing regulatory cis-elements identified in the HIV RNA genome bind various cellular splicing factors and thus affect the selection of individual 3' splice site (see review [49] ). Comparison of nucleotide sequences between the various clades of HIV-1 has demonstrated a high level of conservation of splice sites among the different clades of HIV-1 strains (except D4a, b, c).",

Huh7 cells seem to produce more spliced RNA than do Hep2G cells. The major spliced product is derived from 30% of pgRNA using nt 2447 5'ss and nt 489 3'ss in genotypes A, C, D, and E. Serum of infected patients or hepatocarcinoma tumor samples frequently contain HBV DNA originating from spliced variants [83, 84] . The level of spliced HBV RNAs in patients varies widely from no splicing to extensive splicing and is related to viral genotype [85] . The role of HBV RNA splicing in the HBV life cycle or in HBV pathogenesis remains to be elucidated. HBV spliced RNAs express two new proteins [86, 87] .

Currently no disease or pathological condition is associated with AAV infection in humans. The correlation between AAV infection and fetal loss and male infertility has been proposed due to a high prevalence of AAV DNA in placental tissues and in genital tissues of men with abnormal semen [95, 96] . This has not yet been shown to be causal. Because AAV lacks pathogenicity, induces a low immune response, and infects both dividing and nondividing cells with the capability of viral DNA integration into the host genome, AAV has gained attention as a vector for gene therapy (see review [97] ).",

AAVs use several different strategies to produce viral products. The first group represents AAV1, AAV2, AAV3, AAV4, and AAV6, and their viral transcripts originate from one of three viral promoters on the left-hand side of the viral genome and are terminated on a single polyadenylation site on the right-hand side of the genome. The middle part of the transcripts contains a ~300-nt-long intron with a non-consensus 5' splice site and two 3' splice sites (Fig. 12a) .The efficient splicing requires the presence of both a helper virus and a large Rep protein [98] . While Rep protein seems to be essential for AAV2 splicing, several adenovirus proteins (E1A, E1B, E2a, E4orf6, and VA RNA) as well as some products of herpes simplex virus (UL5, UL8, UL52, and UL29) also have a stimulatory effect on AAV2 splicing [99] . AAV5 and some animal AAVs are in the second group that utilizes three upstream promoters for their transcription, but their genome contains additional polyadenylation sites in the intron region. Transcripts from two upstream promoters are polyadenylated on the internal poly(A) site, whereas spliced transcripts from P41 promoter use a poly(A) site at the right side of the genome (Fig. 12b) . The only spliced transcript in AAV5 infections is the Cap transcript which contains a smaller (~240 nt) intron. Interestingly, the splicing of AAV5 Cap transcript is constitutive and highly efficient even in the absence of helper virus infection [100] . Human B19 virus, a member of Erythrovirus genus, was first identified in the serum of blood donor [101] . Three genotypes of B19 viruses have been identified from different geographic regions [102] . After acute infection, the virus persists in host for the rest of the life. The infection by B19 virus is generally asymptomatic, but several pathological conditions have been associated with B19 infection; these include erythema infectiosum (the \"fifth disease) [103] , polyarthropathy syndrome [104] , transient aplastic crisis (TAC) [105] , and persistent anemia/pure red cell aplasia (PRCA). B19 infection during pregnancy may associate with spontaneous miscarriage and development of nonimmune hydrops fetalis [106] .",

NS1 ORF on the left-side genome translates a 77-kDa nonstructural protein, while a VP ORF on the right-side genome produces two capsid proteins (84-kDa VP1 and 58-kDa VP2). At least nine virus-specific transcripts have been detected following B19 infection [107] ; all of which are transcribed solely from a single promoter P6 located upstream of NS1 gene, but are alternatively spliced and terminated at two alternative polyadenylation sites (Fig. 12c ) located either in the middle or on the far right side of the genome. By using the poly(A) site in the middle of virus genome, the P6 transcript has an intron in the NS1 ORF, and splicing of this intron from NS1 transcript may create a novel ORF encoding a small accessory 7.5-kDa protein. However, if the poly(A) site on the right-side genome is used for RNA polyadenylation, the P6 transcript becomes a bicistronic (NS1 and VP) transcript with two introns. By splicing to remove the intron 1 from the bicistronic RNA, the single-spliced P6 transcript is capable of encoding both 7.5-kDa and VP1 proteins. Double RNA splicing to remove both intron 1 and intron 2 from the P6 bicistronic transcript disrupts both ORFs for NS1 and VP1, but creates either a VP2 or a novel ORF for another accessory 11-kDa protein, depending on which alternative 3' splice site is selected (Fig. 12c) . Thus, all detected B19 transcripts are derived from a P6 pre-mRNA containing one or two introns with two possible alternative 3' splice sites depending on the selection of one of two possible alternative poly(A) sites. All detected B19 transcripts are alternatively spliced RNA transcripts, except the unspliced full-length NS1RNA. The cis-elements in the central exon and intron 2 are regulatory elements and control the alternative P6 RNA splicing, with the double-spliced P6 RNAs being the predominant species in the infected cells [107] .",

The second intron is a major intron that uses two alternative donor sites, respectively at nt 973 and nt 1111 as well as one acceptor site at nt 1226 for RNA splicing. Alternative splicing of E1A RNA through the utilization of various combinations of splice donor and acceptor sites leads to the formation of five different species (13S, 12S, 11S, 10S, and 9S) of E1A mRNAs based on their sedimentation coefficient (Fig. 13b) and expression of individual unique proteins [111] . The transcription of late genes starts predominantly from a major late promoter. The primary late transcript is then polyadenylated at one of five polyadenylation sites, forming five groups of late transcripts (L1-L5). Each late mRNA contains a 201-nt \"leader\" sequence derived from three noncoding exons that function as a translational enhancer [112] . There are two variants of leader sequence with or without an i-leader exon. Beside the leader sequence region, L1 transcripts also are alternatively spliced by the utilization of a common 5' splice site in combination with two alternative 3' splice sites. Selection of a proximal 3' splice site results in the formation of 52, 55K RNA, while selection of a distal 3' splice site produces IIIa mRNA (Fig. 13c) .",

Similar phenomenon has been observed in the expression of late mRNAs. Inclusion of the i-leader exon is generally a signature of early transcripts, but most of the late transcripts contain a classical tripartite leader. While 52,55K L1 RNA is produced during both early and late infection, the IIIa splice site is used only in the late stage of viral infection [114] .

Simian vacuolating virus 40 (SV40), a prototype virus of the family, was introduced into the human population as a contaminant in early trials of poliovirus vaccine [124] . Serological data indicate that polyomavirus infection is widespread in the general human population with initial infection occurring in childhood [125] . After the initial infection, polyomaviruses persist in the host for the rest of the life. While initial infection is usually asymptomatic, several human polyomaviruses are associated with various pathological conditions in immunocompromised patients including nephropathy and cystitis associated with BK PyV and progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy associated with JCPyV [126] , as well as trichodysplasia spinulosa presumably associated with TSV infection. Polyomaviruses expresses an oncoprotein T antigen, and this T antigen may lead to the development of human cancer by an abortive infection as recently confirmed in a rare but aggressive Merkel cell carcinoma [127] [128] [129] .",

The primary transcript of the T antigen contains two introns, but the first intron 1 has two alternative 5' splice sites. During RNA splicing, the intron 2 retention is important for production of both large T and small t antigens. However, selection of proximal 5' splice site in the intron 1 for RNA splicing leads to production of large T antigen, whereas selection of a distal 5' splice site in the intron 1 results in small t production. Because the sequence region between the proximal 5' splice site and the distal 5' splice site has a stop codon, retention of this region in small t RNA splicing makes the small t RNA larger than the large T RNA, but introduction of a premature stop codon in the small t RNA results in production of a smaller protein (Fig. 14b) . In addition, a rare tiny t antigen of ~17 kDa has been attributed to double RNA splicing in SV40-infected cells [130] . In this case, the transcript encoding the 17-kDa antigen shows splicing of both introns, but splicing of the intron 1 by selection of the proximal 5' ss. Similar to SV40, the multiple-spliced RNA species of early transcripts also were detected in other polyomaviruses such as the truncated T antigen (trunc-T Ag) in BKPyV [131] , T'135, T'136, and T'165 in JCPyV [132] and T3 and T4 early transcripts in MCPyV [127] (Fig. 14b) . Alternative splicing of polymavirus early transcripts allows the expression of multiple T antigens with distinguished function during the viral life cycle. In addition to the cells with actively replicating virus, the early viral transcripts also are expressed in cells with nonproductive infection or in polyomavirustransformed cells. These cells often do not express late gene product due to integration of the viral DNA into host genome, resulting in dysregulated viral gene expression as well as cell transformation.",

The HPV genome consists of three regions: viral early, late, and noncoding regions and generally encodes eight viral genes (E1, E2, E4, E5, E6, E7, L1, and L2). Viral early gene products are regulatory proteins responsible for virus replication and pathogenesis during a productive infection, whereas the late L1 and L2 genes encode two viral capsid proteins for virus particle formation. Interestingly, almost all viral early genes are expressed from an early promoter upstream of the viral E6 gene and are polyadenylated at an early poly(A) signal downstream of E5 gene. Thus, viral early gene transcripts are polycistronic, with several ORFs in a single RNA molecule, and undergo extensive alternative RNA splicing during viral RNA maturation. In contrast, viral L1 and L2 are commonly transcribed from E7 ORF and polyadenylated at a late poly(A) site downstream of L1 ORF (Fig. 15a) . As a result, the 5' sequences of viral L1 and L2 are part of the viral early transcript sequences. RNA splicing to remove most of these early gene sequences from the RNA is important for viral L1 and L2 expression [133] .",

HPV is present in >95% of all cervical cancer and is required for initiation of cervical carcinogenesis and maintenance of the cervical cancer cells. Cervical cancer is a leading cause of death for women in the developing world, with about 493,000 new cases and nearly 273,000 deaths each year. More than 200 genotypes of HPVs have been identified to date and are grouped into two major groups based on their pathogenesis and association with cervical cancer [134] . The reference genome sequences are available at https://pave.niaid.nih.gov/#home. The high-risk or oncogenic HPV types are present in cervical cancers, some anogenital cancers, as well as head-and-neck cancers. The low-risk or non-oncogenic HPVs are not associated with cancers [135] . In general, women acquire HPV infection by sexual contact. A number of epidemiology studies have demonstrated that women with repeat exposure to oncogenic HPVs as well as women with persistent cervical infection by oncogenic HPVs are at high risk for developing cervical cancer [136, 137] . Infection with oncogenic HPV-16 and HPV-18, the two most common oncogenic HPV types, leads to the development of almost 70% of all cervical and other types of anogenital cancers. Viral E6 and E7 of the oncogenic HPVs are two viral oncoproteins that inactivate, respectively, cellular p53 and pRB, which are two tumor suppressor proteins essential for cell cycle control [138, 139] . In cervical cancer tissues and cervical cancer-derived cell lines, E6 and E7 oncogenes are highly expressed; the majority of the E6/E7 bicistronic RNA are alternatively spliced as diagramed for HPV-16 and HPV-18. A major spliced RNA isoform of viral E6/E7 bicistronic RNA is E6*I derived from splicing of nt 226 5' splice site to nt 409 3' splice site for HPV-16 and of nt 233 5' splice site to nt 416 3' splice site for HPV-18 (Fig. 15b) . It has been demonstrated that this RNA splicing is necessary for viral E7 translation [140] and can be easily detected by RNase protection assay (RPA) or by RT-PCR methods [140, 141] .",

A woman who has a Pap smear with abnormal cells may also be referred for HPV DNA testing by two FDA-approved assays: the Hybrid Capture 2 DNA test, which detects 13 high-risk HPVs /HPV E7 mRNA from 14 high-risk types (HPV-16, HPV-18, HPV-31,  HPV-33, HPV-35, HPV-39, HPV-45, HPV-51, HPV-52, HPV-56, HPV-58, HPV-59, HPV-66 , and HPV-68) [144] with a sensitivity and specificity similar to or better than the Hybrid Capture 2 DNA test [145, 146] .

The capsid is covered with a heterogeneous layer of viral proteins and RNAs called tegument. Outside of this tegument is a lipid bilayer membrane (envelope) containing several virus-encoded glycoproteins. A hallmark of herpesvirus infection is the establishment of a lifelong \"latent\" infection in their host following initial infection. Latent virus is often reactivated by various stimuli and causes recurrent infections, which is a typical feature of all herpesviruses. Currently there are more than 100 known herpesviruses infecting a wide range of animal species. All human herpesviruses belong to the Herpesviridae family which is further grouped into four subfamilies: Alphaherpesvirinae, Betaherpesvirinae, Gammaherpesvirinae, and unassigned viruses. Currently, eight herpesvirus species have been isolated from humans; these have been assigned to three subfamilies of Herpesviridae.

Latent infection is characterized by the expression of a few viral genes (latent transcripts) that maintain the viral genome in latently infected cells. Lytic infection is associated with viral genome replication and production of infectious virions; this generally leads to destruction of the infected cell. In contrast to latent infection, almost all viral lytic genes in the lytic infection are expressed in a timely regulated fashion and are divided, based on their dependence on viral protein expression and viral genome replication, into three kinetic classes: immediate early, early, and late. In some circumstances, the virus in latently infected cells may be reactivated and proceeds to lytic infection. The mechanisms controlling the establishment of latency and reactivation of herpesviruses are not yet fully understood. The human herpes viral genome encodes up to 100 different genes including a variable number of noncoding genes expressing noncoding RNAs or viral miRNAs [150] [151] [152] .",

Initial infection generally occurs in childhood or early adolescence through body contact and is followed by the establishment of latent infection. Some herpesviruses are sexually transmitted. Blood transfusion, tissue transplantation, and/or congenital transmission are additional mechanisms for acquiring the virus. The primary infection often occurs in epithelia, i.e., the point of entry, followed by establishment of latent infection, which generally occurs in a specialized cell type (neurons or lymphocytes) and serves as a virus reservoir. Recurrence of infection is caused by virus reactivation from its latent state with the virus escaping from the host immunological surveillance. Overall symptoms of herpesvirus infections in healthy individuals are generally mild, but may be life threatening in immunocompromised patients. While it is clear that infections by some herpesviruses such as EBV and KSHV are etiologically linked to the development of several types of cancer, the role of other human herpesviruses in cell transformation remains unknown [153] . Several antiviral compounds are used to treat acute herpesvirus infections. The only vaccine against herpesviruses currently approved for use in clinic is varicella/chickenpox vaccine against VZV.",

However, without quantification at multiple time points, these techniques are unable to distinguish virus carriers from patients with active virus replication. Detection of viral transcripts associated with virus lytic phase by RT-PCR provides indication of active virus replication, but often leads to a false-positive result due to viral DNA contamination. Such DNA contamination problems could be avoided by selection of an amplicon over the intron in spliced viral transcripts; a specific product of the spliced RNA could be distinguished from its corresponding DNA based on its size. The number of spliced viral transcripts varies from one herpesvirus to another, ranging from only a handful of split genes in HSV-1 to about 30% in KSHV [154] .

A minor 1.5-kb RNA is generated by further splicing of the 2.0-kb RNA by removal of an internal intron of 559 or 556-bp, depending on the virus strain [160] (Fig. 6a) . Both LAT RNAs are uncapped without a poly(A) tail and accumulate in the nucleus of infected cells. HSV-1 LAT RNA is a noncoding regulatory RNA for establishment and maintenance of viral latency by inhibiting the expression of viral lytic genes and thus interfering with the cellular apoptosis pathway [161] . Recent studies have demonstrated that LAT transcript functions as a precursor for the generation of virus-encoded miRNAs [162] .

Multiple approaches have been developed to detect CMV viremia in circulating lymphocytes by direct virus isolation with cultivation, by detection of viral antigens in polymorphonuclear cells, or by quantitative viral DNA [175, 176] . However, the detection of viremia is not sufficient for disease prediction since many viremic patients never develop symptoms. However, active CMV replication in peripheral blood lymphocytes can be verified by analyzing viral mRNAs [177] . Amplification of spliced viral transcripts has some advantages in comparison to intronless transcripts and is not affected by DNA contamination. Detection of spliced immediate-early transcripts had been reported to have a good correlation with the detection of viral DNA or viral antigen [178] [179] [180] . Detection of late gene UL21.5 has a better prediction value and has a significant correlation with disease progression [174, 181, 182] .",

EBV infection is highly prevalent, with more than 95% of the human population becoming seropositive in early life. While primary infection during childhood is usually unremarkable, the virus acquisition in adolescence and adulthood is often associated with the development of the infectious mononucleosis syndrome. In healthy individuals, the EBV infection is well controlled by the immune system. However, EBV remains in long-living memory B cells where it establishes a latent infection. EBV is an oncogenic virus capable of transforming the infected B cells [183] . EBV infections have been associated with the development of a number of human malignancies, including nasopharyngeal carcinoma, Burkitt's lymphoma, Hodgkin's lymphoma, gastric carcinoma, and others (see review [184] ). Active EBV replication due to immunosuppression may cause posttransplant lymphoproliferative disease [185] . During latent infection, EBV expresses six nuclear antigens (EBNA-1, EBNA-2, EBNA-3A, EBNA-3B, EBNA-3C, and EBNA-LP), three latent membrane proteins (LMP-1, LMP-2A, and LMP-2B), and several noncoding transcripts (EBER-1 and EBER-2 and BARTs). Many EBV latent products are defined as oncogenes and are responsible for EBVmediated cell transformation [115] . Several types of EBV latency have been defined by variable expression of latent genes in a number of malignancies [186] .",

Although BRLF1 and BZLF1 are transcribed separately from a different promoter with the Rp for BRLF1 and the Zp for BZLF1, both gene transcripts utilize the same polyadenylation site for RNA polyadenylation [195] (Fig. 17c) . Thus, the Zp promoter-derived transcript is a monocistronic ZEBRA RNA containing two constitutive introns; splicing of these two introns results in production of a 0.9-kb mRNA that encodes ZEBRA protein. Transcription from the Rp promoter leads to production of a 3.8-kb bicistronic transcript, ZEBRA/RTA, which contains two additional introns and the ZEBRA RNA. Splicing of the intron 1 in the 5' noncoding region of ZEBRA/RTA transcript leads to production of a 2.9-kb RNA as a major RNA isoform. However, both isoforms of ZEBRA/RTA RNA have the potential to encode ZEBRA and RTA proteins. A third minor isoform of ZEBRA/RTA transcript is derived from the splicing of an additional internal intron spanning from BRLF1 ORF to BZLF1 ORF; this splicing produces a RAZ transcript of ~0.9 kb encoding a RTA-ZEBRA fusion protein, RAZ. RAZ may function as an inhibitor to ZEBRA during EBV infection [196] .",

            "text": "During latency, the KSHV genome expresses a latency-associated nuclear antigen-1 (LANA-1) [201] from ORF73. The gene ORF73 posits along with ORF72 and K13 in a larger latent locus of the virus genome. The latter two genes encode viral homologues of cellular proteins vCyclin (ORF72) and vFLICE (K13). ORF73/72/K13 are transcribed from a single promoter (P 127880 ) as a tricistronic RNA containing an intron with two alternative 3' splice sites. Alternative RNA splicing and alternative RNA polyadenylation of the tricistronic pre-mRNA result in production of three mature mRNAs (5.4, 3.3, and 1.7 kb) [202] (Fig. 18b) . The 5.4- Fig. 17 (continued) EBV latency-associated EBNA-1 transcribed from several alternative promoters (C p -Q p ). EBNA-1 RNA contains multiple exons (C 1 -K, lines) and introns (half triangles). A detailed EBNA-1 transcript derived from the Q p promoter is shown below with splice sites (black triangles) and splice directions (dashed lines for introns). A primer pair used to detect the spliced EBNA-1 transcript from exon U to exon K [185] is detailed in the table below. (c) Gene structures of BRLF1 (RTA) and BZLF1 (ZEBRA) (two EBV-immediate-early genes) and their spliced RNA products. EBV RTA and ZEBRA are transcribed by two alternative promoters, R P and Z P , but polyadenylated by using the same polyadenylation signal downstream of ZEBRA ORF. Thus, the bicistronic RTA transcript derived from Rp promoter contains multiple introns and has potentials to encode RTA, ZEBRA, and RAZ proteins by alternative RNA splicing, whereas the monocistronic ZEBRA transcript derived from the Zp promoter encodes only ZEBRA protein and also contains multiple introns as detailed further below with nucleotide positions of splice sites, exons (Z1-Z3, black boxes), and introns (dashed lines). Arrows below exons Z1 and Z3 are a primer pair used for detection of spliced ZEBRA mRNA [185] and detailed in the kb transcript most likely responsible for LANA-1 expression is produced by usage of the proximal 3' splice site, whereas usage of the distal 3' splice site leads to expression of 1.7-kb transcripts for vCyclin and vFLICE. Both transcripts are polyadenylated at the same distal polyadenylation site. The minor 3.3-kb transcript uses the proximal splice site for RNA splicing but is polyadenylated at a proximal noncanonical polyadenylation signal (Fig. 18b) . KSHV lytic replication is controlled by a major viral transactivator, ORF50 (also referred as Rta) [203, 204] . Like LANA-1, ORF50 posits along with K8 and K8.1 in a larger gene locus (ORF50/K8/K8.1 cluster) (Fig. 18c) and is expressed as an immediately early transcript during lytic virus replication. K8 encoding a viral k-bZIP protein is an early gene and K8.1 encoding a glycoprotein is a late gene. Although each of the three genes bears its own promoter, all of their RNA transcripts use a single polyadenylation site located downstream of K8.1 gene and undergo alternative RNA splicing (see review [154] ). Thus, the 3' portion of ORF50 transcript is homologous to K8 and K8.1 and has the same intron and exon structures as seen in the K8 and K8.1 transcripts. The ORF50 transcript is tricistronic, K8 is bicistronic, and K8.1 is monocistronic in nature. The bicistronic K8 transcript is composed of four exons separated by three introns (Fig. 18c) . A functional K8\u03b1 protein is expressed from a fully spliced mRNA, but retention of the intron 2 in K8\u03b2 mRNA results in the expression of a minor form K8\u03b2 protein [205] . An unspliced K8 RNA, K8\u03b3, is also detectable, but rare in lytically infected cells.",

Transcripts originated from the ORF73/72/K13 gene cluster are expressed in latently infected, KSHV-transformed cells and are detectable by RT-PCR. Active virus replication is associated with the expression of viral lytic genes. Amplification of the spliced K8 region that detects the expression of both ORF50 tricistronic and K8 bicistronic transcripts could be used to monitor viral lytic replication [206] . genes. Three genes are transcribed from a single promoter (P) as a polycistronic RNA. This polycistronic primary transcript is processed by alternative RNA splicing and alternative polyadenylation (pA, see arrows below). Nucleotide positions of splice sites (triangles) and polyadenylation site in the KSHV genome (GenBank Acc. No. U75698.1) are diagramed further below with coding potentials of each spliced product on the left. Open boxes are exons and dash lines are introns or splicing directions. oKY30 and oKY46 are a primer pair used to detect spliced LANA transcripts [215] as detailed in the table below. (c) Gene structure of a KSHV lytic locus consisting of immediate-early RTA (ORF50), early K8, and late K8.1 genes. Three genes are expressed from three separate promoters (P), but all of their transcripts (full lines with arrows immediately below to the right) are polyadenylated at the same polyadenylation site (pA), resulting in RTA as a tricistronic, K8 as a bicistronic, and K8.1 as a monocistronic transcript. The enlarged K8 coding region contains three exons (filled boxes) and two introns (dashed lines), with nucleotide positions of each splice site in the KSHV genome (GenBank Acc. No. U75698.1). Names of three common forms of K8 transcripts from alternative RNA splicing are shown on the left. oST1 and oST2 are two primers used to detect spliced K8 RNAs as described [215, 216] , and are detailed in the table below",

In the first part, basic information about the mechanisms of RNA splicing and the methodological approaches for specific detection of these spliced RNA molecules is provided. The core of these techniques represents an amplification and detection of nucleic acids. The advantage of nucleic acid-based techniques is the application of the same platform for detection of various viral pathogens, often at the same time, by multiplexing. The rapid setup of these methods is especially important for a rapid response to emerging viruses as has been successfully proven in the case of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), avian influenza, Zika virus, and Ebola virus outbreaks where nucleic acid amplification was rapidly deployed to detect and to confirm these infections. The low material requirement and their simplicity make these detection methods suitable for applications in low resources setting such as laboratories where the first contact is seen as well as field laboratories. Because the genomic sequences for many viruses can be detected by amplification of the nucleic acid molecules as a routine procedure in many diagnostic laboratories, the detection of spliced viral transcripts could be performed simultaneously using already existing methods.",
