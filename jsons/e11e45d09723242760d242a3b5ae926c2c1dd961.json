BST-2 has demonstrated broad-spectrum antiviral activity against numerous enveloped viruses, [7] and in response, most viruses have evolved functions to antagonize BST-2.

A number of signaling pathways have been demonstrated to induce expression of BST-2. The promoter region contains consensus sites for the transcription factors STAT3, IRF1, and ISGF1. [9] Accordingly, interferons (IFNs) from all three classes (i.e., IFN-\u03b1, -\u03b2, -\u03b3, -\u03c4, -\u03bb3, and -\u03c9) induce the expression of BST-2 in numerous cell types. [10, 11] In na\u00efve mice, BST-2 expression appears to be limited to plasmacytoid dendritic cells, but is upregulated on most cell types by interferons that are induced and secreted in response to viral infection. [10] However, upregulation is not limited to IFN signaling, as a number of IFNindependent stimulants have also been reported. For example, IL-27 is a potent inducer, [12] and TLR3 and TLR8 stimulation induce BST-2 expression in the absence of IFN. [13] In contrast, despite the apparent presence of an IRF1 binding site in the BST-2 promoter region, TNF\u03b1 has little impact on BST-2 expression levels. [10, 14] Expression is downmodulated by TGF\u03b2. [15] Because the response to IFN-I is generally conserved in all cells, [16] BST-2 expression should increase in the airway as part of the antiviral response. However, there have been differing observations as to whether or not BST-2 expression is induced in airway epithelial cells. In cultured primary mouse airway epithelial cells and mouse airway cell lines (LA-4), BST-2 expression is induced by IFN-\u03b1, but only modestly increases 24 h after IAV infection. [17] In contrast, we have observed increased BST-2 expression in vivo in mouse airway epithelial cells following both SeV and IAV infection (unpublished data), and BST-2 expression is upregulated in human airway cell lines (A549, NCI-H196, NCI-H358) following viral infection [18] [19] [20] and IFN-I production.

[22] BST-2 inhibits viral replication by preventing release of viral progeny from infected cells, leading to their subsequent internalization and degradation. [23] Since then, BST-2 has been shown to potently inhibit several enveloped viruses that bud from the plasma membrane. [7] Due to this pressure, most viruses have developed antagonist strategies to block BST-2 function. Because of this, the BST-2 viral tethering function has typically been demonstrated in assays using mutant viruses deficient in BST-2-antagonizing proteins (such as Vpu-deficient HIV-1) or virus-like particles (VLPs). These types of studies have shown that BST-2 restricts the budding of VLPs or mutant viruses from the following families: retroviruses (alpha-, beta-, delta-, lenti-, and spuma-); [24, 25] arenaviruses (Lassa and Machupo); [26, 27] herpesviruses (KSHV); [28] filoviruses (Ebola and Marburg); [24, 27] rhabdoviruses (vesicular stomatitis); [29] paramyxoviruses (Nipah); [26] and flaviviruses (Hepatitis C). [30] BST-2 has been shown to effectively inhibit budding of some intact infectious viruses, including Lassa and Machupo arenaviruses, [26] and vesicular stomatitis rhabdovirus, [29] but does not restrict other infectious viruses such as Ebola, Marburg, cowpox, or Rift Valley fever bunyavirus. [26] These observations demonstrate that BST-2 inhibits the budding of a broad spectrum of enveloped viruses and suggest that it might inhibit release of enveloped respiratory viruses from infected epithelial cells. More recent studies have investigated the potential of BST-2 to restrict budding of respiratory viruses ( Table 1) . For IAV, results appear to be dependent on virus strain and cell type used. Some groups have reported that BST-2 does not restrict IAV release, [17, 19, 31] while others report that BST-2 does inhibit release of IAV VLPs [18, 32, 33] and partially restricts infectious virus. [20, 21, 34] These observations appear to be dependent on IAV-encoded BST-2 antagonists, the identity and effectiveness of which may be strain dependent (discussed in section 6). BST-2 also partially restricts the human pathogens PIV2, [35] hCoV-229E, [36] and SARS, [37] and this restriction is enhanced by deletion of viral antagonists. It also restricts animal model respiratory virus SeV, [38] but interestingly does not seem to inhibit pRRSV. [39] Thus, BST-2 appears to restrict a number of enveloped respiratory viruses in vitro, and this ability is hindered by encoded viral antagonists (discussed in section 6).", "cite_spans": [{"start": 195, "end": 199, "text": "[22]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 354, "end": 358, "text": "[23]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 473, "end": 476, "text": "[7]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 972, "end": 976, "text": "[24,", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 977, "end": 980, "text": "25]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1015, "end": 1019, "text": "[26,", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1020, "end": 1023, "text": "27]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1046, "end": 1050, "text": "[28]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1084, "end": 1088, "text": "[24,", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1089, "end": 1092, "text": "27]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1131, "end": 1135, "text": "[29]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1161, "end": 1165, "text": "[26]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1198, "end": 1202, "text": "[30]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1332, "end": 1336, "text": "[26]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1375, "end": 1379, "text": "[29]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1492, "end": 1496, "text": "[26]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1969, "end": 1973, "text": "[17,", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1974, "end": 1977, "text": "19,", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1978, "end": 1981, "text": "31]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2046, "end": 2050, "text": "[18,", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2051, "end": 2054, "text": "32,", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2055, "end": 2058, "text": "33]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2101, "end": 2105, "text": "[20,", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2106, "end": 2109, "text": "21,", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2110, "end": 2113, "text": "34]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2337, "end": 2341, "text": "[35]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2353, "end": 2357, "text": "[36]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2368, "end": 2372, "text": "[37]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2494, "end": 2498, "text": "[38]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2549, "end": 2553, "text": "[39]", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 1814, "end": 1822, "text": "Table 1)", "ref_id": "TABREF0"}], "section": "BST-2 Restricts Cellular Virion Release for a Broad Range of Enveloped Viruses"}, {"text": "The structural organization of BST-2 is highly unique among mammalian proteins. It is a type II transmembrane protein consisting of a short N-terminal cytoplasmic tail (CT), a single transmembrane region (TM), an ectodomain (ED), and a second membrane anchor-a C-terminal glycosylphosphotidylinositol (GPI) ( Figure 1A ). Sequence analysis suggests this dual-anchor topology is only found in one other protein in the human genome, a special form of the prion protein. [40] These structural features are important for the antiviral function of BST-2. Deletion of either one of the membrane anchors (TM or GPI) ablates the ability of BST-2 to restrict viral budding. [22, 41, 42] In addition to being a membrane anchor required for viral tethering, the GPI-anchor is required for cellular trafficking as BST-2 is sequestered in the ER of cells that have defects in the GPI-biosynthesis pathway. [42] The GPI-anchor enriches BST-2 to lipid rafts to enhance its antiviral activity, since this is a preferred site of budding for many enveloped viruses. [40] Mature BST-2 recycles between the plasma membrane, endosomes, and trans-Golgi network (TGN). [40, 43] Despite localization to lipid rafts, BST-2 is internalized via clathrin-dependent endocytosis, mediated by an evolutionarily conserved YxY motif in the CT, which recruits the adaptor AP-2. [43] The BST-2 ectodomain has numerous structural features required for optimal antiviral function ( Figure 1A ). The ectodomain spans the two membrane anchors, forming a coiled-coil parallel dimer containing three inter-dimer disulfides and resembles a molecular \"rope\" spanning roughly 150-170 A\u030a. [44] [45] [46] The ectodomain coiled-coil is unique in that it contains conserved patterns of residues at the dimer interface that destabilize the packing, causing the ectodomain to act less [17, 19, 31] Others report BST-2 inhibits IAV VLP release; dependent on neuraminidase sequence. [18, 20, 21, 32, 33] Others report BST-2 inhibits infectious IAV and IAV VLPs, enhanced by loss of IAV M2.

[51] C) A dimeric assembly created by crystallographic symmetry in the mouse BST-2 crystal structure.

D) Stabilized tubulation and prevention of scission model of BST-2 mediated inhibition of viral budding. BAR-like BST-2 oligomers stabilize the tubulating membrane and prevent membrane scission. These tubules could be further stabilized by cytosolic BAR domain proteins that bind the cytoplasmic tail of BST-2 (e.g., RICH2). [55] This hypothetical model is based on the observation of a BAR-like dimer in the mouse BST-2 ectodomain crystal structure [44] and the observation of long tube-like structures longer than the ectodomain of BST-2 (>200 A\u030a) tethering HIV-1 VLPs to the plasma membrane by cryo-EM.

[42, 49] Cryo-EM and cryo-ET studies have shown budding viruses and VLPs anchored to cells by short tethers containing BST-2. [22, 47, 49, 50] Two orientations for viral tethering are possible ( Figure 1B) . However, insertion of the GPI-anchor into the viral membrane is favored three-to fivefold. [51] This orientation would optimize the ability of the N-terminal CT to interact with the cytoskeleton, which likely aids in BST-2 clustering at the host membrane. BST-2 accumulates at HIV budding sites, where it clusters at around four to seven molecules per site. [52] Mutations to the BST-2 ectodomain prevent clustering and render it unable to restrict the release of VLPs. [53] This orientation and clustering also likely enhances the ability of BST-2 to form signaling complexes, which will be discussed in Section 7.1. Crystallographic and cryo-EM studies suggest a second potential mechanism for BST-2-mediated inhibition of viral budding. Analysis of the crystal structure of mouse BST-2 revealed a dimer-of dimers assembly that resembled those formed by BAR domains ( Figure 1C ). [44] BAR domains are \u03b1-helical bundles that dimerize to form crescent-shaped structures that can bind to and stabilize curved membranes that form during membrane trafficking and budding events.

Consequently, most viruses have developed countermeasures to evade BST-2 antiviral function. These viral antagonists impair BST-2 by a number of different mechanisms, including removal from or prevention of trafficking to the cell surface, and targeting of BST-2 for proteosomal degradation. [7, 56] For example, HIV-1 encodes Vpu, a small membrane protein that interacts with BST-2 via transmembrane regions. [41, 57, 58] Vpu then facilitates recruitment of ubiquitin ligases and AP-1 to enable targeting of BST-2 for endolysosomal degradation. [59, 60] KSHV uses a similar strategy, encoding the protein K5 that is itself an E3 RING ubiquitin ligase that recognizes the BST-2 CT, thus enabling ubiquitination of BST-2 and subsequent degradation [28, 61] SIV Nef protein directs removal from the cell surface by binding the BST-2 CT and linking it to the endocytic adaptor AP-2 to remove BST-2 from the plasma membrane.

As mentioned earlier, IAV release appears to be partially restricted by BST-2 in a strain-dependent manner. [20] These differences appear to be mostly due to variations in the sequence of the encoded neuraminidase. [20, 21, 32, 33] Neuraminidase has been the most widely reported IAV-encoded BST-2 antagonist, but little known about its mechanism of action. Despite this lack of information, differences of a single amino acid have been reported to switch a restricted IAV VLP to one not inhibited by BST-2. [18] Interactions appear to be mediated between the ectodomains of the two proteins. However, this interaction does not appear to promote surface removal of BST-2. A more recent study suggests the IAV M2 channel protein is a BST-2 antagonist. [34] In contrast to neuraminidase, this interaction promotes surface removal of BST-2, ending in proteasomal degradation. In addition, IAV encodes the general IFN-I antagonist NS1, which can broadly inhibit expression of ISGs. NS1 may partially inhibit BST-2 via this broadly targeted strategy. [31, 32] PIV2 encodes the V protein, which targets BST-2 for surface removal, but does not appear to catalyze proteasomal destruction of BST-2. [35] PIV2V may also prevent viral-mediated induction of BST-2. [65] SARS-CoV encodes ORF7a, which binds BST-2 via interaction of their ectodomains. [37] This interaction appears to inhibit maturation of BST-2 glycosylation, which prevents surface expression. Infection of cells with hCoV-229E promotes surface removal of BST-2, but the mechanism and viral protein involved are unknown. [36] SeV infection promotes proteasomal degradation of BST-2. This degradation appears to be mediated by the fusion (F) and hemagluttanin-neuraminidase (HN) proteins in concert, although further mechanistic details are unknown.

In addition to its function as a viral tethering protein, BST-2 also acts as an innate immune viral sensor that signals and triggers activation of NF-\u03baB to elicit production of inflammatory cytokines that alert neighboring cells, extending its protection abilities to adjacent cells by inducing production of antiviral proteins. Clustering of BST-2 captured in budding virions initiates assembly of a signaling pathway that causes NF-\u03baB activation. [66, 67] This clustering creates the formation of a specialized signaling motif called a HemITAM including residues Y6 and Y8 in the BST-2 CT, which recruit Src-family kinases and become phosphorylated (Figure 3) . The phosphorylation specifically recruits the kinase Syk, which then assembles a signaling complex composed of adaptors TRAF2 and TRAF6, as well as TAK1, and culminates in downstream activation of NF-\u03baB. [68] BST-2 is coupled to the actin cytoskeleton via interaction with the BAR and Rho-GAP containing protein RICH2, which binds the BST-2 CT. Mutations that inhibit this interaction prevent or reduce phosphorylation of BST-2 and subsequent downstream NF-\u03baB activation. [68, 69] Thus, it appears that pre-concentration of BST-2 on the cell surface is required for efficient clustering by viruses. This signaling can induce expression of inflammatory and antiviral signaling cytokines IFN-\u03b2, CXCL10, and IL-6. [68] Virusencoded BST-2 antagonists have varying effects on BST-2mediated activation of NF-\u03baB, which appears to be linked to the ability to direct degradation of BST-2. HIV-1 Vpu, which targets BST-2 for surface removal and destruction, also prevents BST-2mediated activation of NF-\u03baB. [67, 70] However, Ebola GP and HIV2 Env, which engage BST-2 to inhibit its viral tethering ability but do not direct its degradation, do not inhibit this signaling ability of BST-2.

In this capacity, it serves as a ligand for the inhibitory receptor ILT-7, which is exclusively expressed on pDCs (Figure 3 ). Circulating pDCs produce IFN-I in response to virus-derived TLR7/9 stimulation, which then initiates the antiviral state in infected and surrounding cells, including upregulation of BST-2 expression. The BST-2 expressed on infected and neighboring cells can then engage ILT-7 on the surface of pDCs, which signals through FcR\u03b3I to shut down production of IFN-I in a negative-feedback manner to prevent overstimulation. [72] HIV-1 Vpu appears to exploit this mechanism by specifically targeting BST-2 clustered to viral budding sites for destruction, and enriching distribution of BST-2 outside of the viral budding site, thus enhancing the probability of BST-2/ILT7 interaction to suppress pDC antiviral response. [73] This interaction has also been suggested to occur in cis between ILT7 and BST-2 both expressed on the surface of pDCs, possibly to prevent premature maturation. [14] BST-2 can also suppress virus-induced interferon production by altering innate immune signaling. It was recently reported that BST-2 can direct the degradation of the RIG-I-like receptor MAVS to dampen IFN-I production. [74] In this scenario, BST-2 engages MAVS and recruits the ubiquitin E3 ligase MARCH8, which directs K27-linked poly-Ub chains to K7 of MAVS. This Structural domains demonstrated to mediate direct interactions are indicated by solid red arrows. Implied interactions are denoted by dashed red arrows. Antagonism of BST-2 by IAV is strain-dependent. In some strains, the neuraminidase protein partially inhibits IAV release. [18, 21, 33] This antagonism is thought to be mediated by the ectodomains (ED) of neuraminidase and BST-2. Another study suggests IAV antagonizes BST-2 using hemagglutinin, but the effect requires neuraminidase. [20] A more recent study suggests that the IAV M2 channel protein antagonizes BST-2 targeting interactions with the ectodomain and/or transmembrane (TM), causing surface removal. [34] The cytoplasmic V protein of PIV2 may antagonize BST-2 by two different mechanisms. It may bind and target BST-2 for surface removal [35, 80] and it may also inhibit induction of BST-2 expression. [65] How interaction is mediated is unknown. SeV F and HN proteins are required to degrade BST-2. However, it is unknown how interaction is mediated or the mechanism. [38] SARS CoV ORF7a ectodomain mediates an interaction with BST-2, which leads to inhibited glycosylation of BST-2 and its antagonism. [37] Human CoV-229E triggers surface removal of BST-2. The identity of the antagonist protein(s) is unknown. [36] www.advancedsciencenews.com www.bioessays-journal.com polyubiquitination then engages NDP52, leading to autophagic degradation ( Figure 3 ).

A number of recent studies indicate that BST-2 can also restrict the budding of respiratory viruses. This leads to phosphorylation of tyrosines in the YDYCRV motif in the cytoplasmic tail by Src-family kinases followed by the recruitment and activation of Syk.
