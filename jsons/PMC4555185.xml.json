Subsequently, a significant amount of effort was put toward developing vaccines, antivirals and animal models for what became known as Middle East Respiratory Syndrome-Coronavirus (MERS-CoV), an enveloped virus with a positive-sense RNA genome. Since its initial emergence in Jordan in April 2012, the virus has become a significant health concern throughout the Middle East, particularly in Saudi Arabia where the virus was isolated and first identified in June 2012 (Corman et al., 2012, Hijawi et al., 2013, Zaki et al., 2012). As of 24 July, 2014 there have been over 830 laboratory confirmed cases of MERS-CoV infection with at least 290 deaths associated with infection with this virus (Global Alert and Response Website: http://www.who.int/csr/don/en/), with the majority of cases occurring in Saudi Arabia.",

These efforts have identified the camel as a potential reservoir for MERS-CoV (Azhar et al., 2014, Hemida et al., 2014). Evaluation of potential animal models has found that mice and hamsters are not ideal models (Coleman et al., 2014, de Wit et al., 2013a) and that macaques develop a relatively mild, self-limiting infection (de Wit et al., 2013b). In order to complete many of the field and model development studies, inactivation of MERS-CoV was a critical activity that allowed safe testing of material potentially containing MERS-CoV.",

These guidelines add a number of restrictions on the movement of and subsequent work with material generated in a BSL-3 facility. Typically, many of the downstream studies performed on highly pathogenic viruses are completed in BSL-2 or BSL-1 laboratory spaces due to the availability of equipment and to reduce stress on staff. In order to complete this work safely, viruses must be inactivated prior to removal from high containment (BSL-3 or BSL-4) laboratories. Previous studies with the closely related SARS-Coronavirus have established that treatment of virus with heat, ultraviolet light, chemical inactivants and a variety of detergents are effective at inactivating beta-Coronaviruses (Darnell et al., 2004, Darnell and Taylor, 2006, Kariwa et al., 2006, Leclercq et al., 2014, Rabenau et al., 2005a, Rabenau et al., 2005b) while Leclercq et al. have shown that heat effectively inactivates MERS-CoV (Leclercq et al., 2014).",

Gamma irradiation also provides a means of translating inactivation protocols between institutions as the effective dose (rad) will be consistent between instruments and is not necessarily user dependent. The kinetics of MERS-CoV inactivation by gamma irradiation was evaluated using a virus stock with typical titer (\u223c5 log10) and a concentrated virus stock (\u223c10 log10). Virus stocks were irradiated to a specified dose and the resulting titer quantified.

Our evaluation process of blind passaging harvested cells requires that all virus particles in a preparation were adequately inactivated.

Despite the likelihood that Trizol\u00ae inactivates virus in cell culture supernatant or infected cells within seconds, our standard methodology dictates a minimum 10 min room temperature incubation to ensure inactivation. Reagents such as AVL buffer, which rely primarily on guanidine isothiocyanate to denature and inactivate viruses, are now used frequently in research labs and in field work due to its ease of transport, ability to automate and easier use and disposal. In the work shown here, we have clearly demonstrated that treatment of MERS-CoV infected material with Trizol\u00ae LS or AVL buffer renders MERS-CoV, and likely other coronaviruses, inactive. We have also shown that RNA purified from MERS-CoV is not naturally infectious in a cell culture system. The ability of positive strand viral RNA to infect cultured cells has been a point of contention for a number of years with the NIH Office of Biotecnology Activities (OBA) and the Recombinant DNA Advisory Committee suggesting that purified fully intact RNA from positive strand viruses be handled at the same biocontainment level as the pathogen in question. The data for inactivation of MERS-CoV with Trizol\u00ae LS and subsequent addition to cultured cells demonstrates that purified RNA from this virus does not infect cultured cells suggesting that the guidance from OBA is not appropriate for this virus.",
