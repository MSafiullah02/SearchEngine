The conserved nature of RNAi pathway across different organisms increases its applicability in various basic and applied fields. Here we attempt to summarize the knowledge generated on the fundamental mechanisms of RNAi over the years, with emphasis on insects and plantparasitic nematodes (PPNs). This chapter also reviews the rich history of RNAi research, gene regulation by small RNAs across different organisms, and application potential of RNAi for generating transgenic plants resistant to major pests . But, there are some limitations too which restrict wider applications of this technology to its full potential. Further refinement of this technology in terms of resolving these shortcomings constitutes one of the thrust areas in present RNAi research. Nevertheless, its application especially in breeding agricultural crops resistant against biotic stresses will certainly offer the possible solutions for some of the breeding objectives which are otherwise unattainable.",

It has been utilized in basic research ranging from functional studies to gene knockdown in plants and vertebrates and to suppression of cancer and viral diseases in medicine. Moreover, from application point of view, it is being used extensively for trait modification by selective inhibition of gene expression universally across the organisms. In agriculture, RNAi has been extensively employed particularly for imparting resistance against biotic stresses including insects, bacteria, nematodes, fungal infection, and viruses (Tan and Yin 2004; Yanagihara et al. 2006; Good and Stach 2011; Banerjee et al. 2017; Majumdar et al. 2017; Zhang et al. 2017 ). This chapter focuses on how RNAi has been extensively used in managing various biotic stresses which constitute serious impediments to crop productivity. Damage due to insects, fungus, parasitic weeds, and plant-parasitic nematodes is a major biotic constraint causing significant yield losses in agriculture year-round.",

            "text": "The basic concept involves a double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) molecule which potentially silences the gene with complementary sequences post-transcriptionally. RNAi phenomenon was first discovered in a free-living nematode, Caenorhabditis elegans (Fire et al. 1998 ). They coined the term \"RNAi\" for describing effective silencing of gene expression by exogenously supplied sense and antisense RNAs in the model nematode, Caenorhabditis elegans. This phenomenon, conserved among eukaryotes, was described as post-transcriptional gene silencing (PTGS) (Carthew and Sontheimer 2009; Berezikov 2011) . Historically the roots of this exciting development can be traced back to 1990 when chsA gene was overexpressed in transgenic petunia plants and the silencing of endogenous as well as transgene of chalcone synthase in the transgenic plants was observed (Napoli et al. 1990 ). Loss of endogenous as well as transgene-derived mRNAs was described as co-suppression, a term formulated by Napoli. Soon, importance of this technology was well understood by the scientific community, and since then, phenomenal growth in this technology has taken place. In fungi, this mechanism of PTGS is known as quelling (Agrawal et al. 2003) . In nature, viruses mediate PTGS in plants, and the effect is amplified in cytoplasm or in the nucleus.",

Each class of small RNA is unique in its biogenesis and mechanism of action, but there are a few similarities too. Both miRNAs and siRNAs are processed from larger dsRNAs through cleavage by Dicer (a ribonuclease III enzyme). Both are associated with Argonaute proteins (AGO) (Ketting 2011) forming RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC). RISC basically is an Argonaute protein bound to a single strand of noncoding RNA. Varied ribonucleoprotein complexes arise due to several ncRNAs and Argonautes involved in formation of RISC (Darrington et al. 2017) .",

First one involves processing of long dsRNA into small dsRNA by ribonuclease III; in the second stage, unwinding of these small RNAs leads to formation of one guide strand, which is loaded into the RISC, whereas the other strand known as passenger strand gets degraded. Finally, the RISC, directed by the guide strand, locates mRNAs containing sequences complementary to the guide, binds to these sequences, and either degrades the mRNA or blocks its translation (Winter et al. 2009 ).

            "text": "The involvement of siRNA molecules as important intermediates of the RNAi process became evident through independent investigations carried out by researchers around the world. The first report of accumulation of siRNAs was confirmed by Hamilton and Baulcombe (1999) while studying tomato lines transformed with 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxyl oxidase (ACO) and later in Drosophila syncytial blastoderm embryo (Tuschl et al. 1999) . Two other independent studies experimentally exhibited the 21-23 nucleotide small RNAs as intermediates for degradation of mRNA (Zamore et al. 2000; Elbashir et al. 2001) . But how these small RNA molecules are excised from their precursor was yet to be discovered. As the role of RNase III enzymes had been recognized as dsRNA nucleases already, the RNase III domain-containing proteins were searched as one of the factors in siRNA biogenesis. Recently only, different experimental studies revealed the involvement of RNAprocessing enzymes in chopping off the dsRNAs into siRNA molecules. One of the crucial enzymes, Dicer, was identified in Drosophila, by browsing its genome for the proteins dedicated for functioning like RNase III endonuclease activity . In another study, Dicer protein in C. elegans (a bidentate nuclease) was characterized revealing its functional role in small RNA regulatory pathways (Ketting et al. 2001) . It was also deduced to be the ortholog of Drosophila DCR-1 protein. Ketting et al. (2001) in this study also showed the requirement of ATP for regulating the rate of siRNA synthesis. In yet another experiment reduction in ATP levels by 5000-fold in Drosophila revealed a decrease in the rate of siRNA production (Nykanen et al. 2001) . It is now believed that Dicer acts as a complex of proteins with domains for dsRNA binding at its C terminus which are separable from motifs like helicase and PAZ. It was experimentally found to co-localize with an endoplasmic reticulum protein, calreticulin (Caudy et al. 2002) . However, the role of ATP in the biogenesis of siRNA is abstruse due to its varied functions among different Dicer proteins in different organisms. An imperative involvement of ATPase in siRNA production was exhibited by Drosophila Dicer-2 and C. elegans Dcr-1 (Tomari and Zamore 2005) in contrast to human Dicer wherein an ATPase-defective mutant showed regular processing (Carthew and Sontheimer 2009) . A comprehensive biochemical, molecular, genetic, and structural study revealed the presence of two main domains, namely, PAZ and RNaseIII, performing a crucial role in excising the siRNAs (Zhang et al. 2004; Macrae et al. 2006) .",

RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRP) is proposed to be involved in augmenting the siRNA molecules on the basis of biochemical studies (Lipardi et al. 2001; Sijen et al. 2001 ). Sijen demonstrated the fundamental role of rrf1 gene having sequence homology to RdRP for the production of secondary siRNAs in C. elegans. In this study, the concept of transitive RNAi pathway induced by secondary siRNAs came into the picture. Thus, catalytic nature of RNAi was proposed.",

In spite of alarming environmental hazard directly due to residual toxicity of insecticides in food chain, the consumption of insecticides has been ever incremental. This is primarily due to resistance development in insect-pest population and lack of awareness among the farming community. The worldwide consumption of insecticide increases by almost 30% in every 4 years. Therefore, insect-pest management, preferably through an integrative approach and without indiscriminate use of insecticide, has become a most sought-after area in research planning worldwide. Millions of dollars were granted for researching on sustainable and low-cost alternate avenues of pest control strategies in five most important agricultural crops. Development of resistant cultivars in crops seems to be the most acclaimed alternative for minimizing the application of insecticides. Unfortunately, for most of the major crop-insect damage, either such resistant cultivars are not available or the resistance has been broken down. Further insight into such examples reveals that lack of resistance source maneuverable either through classical breeding or through transgenesis has been the major constraint.",

Success of Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) toxin-mediated protection of a large number of crops has been celebrated widely and in fact demonstrated for the first time the potential of biotechnological means in developing genetic resistance. However, applicability of Bt-mediated protection is limited as many of the insect pests are not affected by Bt toxin, and also this technology has faced second-generation challenge of some major insect species developing resistance to Bt (Tabashnik 2008; Tabashnik et al. 2008) . It has been realized that lack of useful insecticidal transgenes is the major limitation in transgenic-based engineering of genetic resistance. In contrary, through RNAi, any important gene can be precisely targeted to elicit lethality in the insect species. Use of RNAi has rapidly progressed for gene function analysis in various insect orders, including Diptera (Lum et al. 2003; Dietzl et al. 2007 ), Lepidoptera (Tian et al. 2009; Terenius et al. 2011) , Coleoptera (Baum et al. 2007; Zhu et al. 2011; Bolognesi et al. 2012) , and Hymenoptera (Nunes and Simoes 2009; Meer and Choi 2013; Zhao and Chen 2013) .",

However, a number of studies indicate several branches of RNAi involved in endogenous gene regulation in addition to silencing of genetic elements of pathogen invaders and transposons (Van Rij and Berezikov 2009 ). Gene silencing through RNAi is systemic and transitive as originally described in C. elegans. A host-derived RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) amplifies the RNAi post-elicitation by dsRNA. In contrast to nematodes, in insects, there is no definite proof of the presence of RdRp. In the absence of RdRp-mediated amplification of dsRNA in insects, the silencing is expected to be more localized. Therefore, elicitation of an effective silencing will require delivery of the dsRNA directly to the target cells and tissues in a continuous manner. The administered dsRNA enters the insect cells via siRNA pathway in which a complex consisting of the RNAase III enzyme (Dicer-2) and TRBP cuts the dsRNA into small 21-23 bpsiRNAs. The RISC bound to AGO recognizes the guide strands of the siRNAs. This complex then binds to complementary sequences of target RNAs which are eventually degraded.",

Cell-autonomous RNAi is limited to the cells in which the dsRNA is administered or delivered. In contrary, when the silencing occurs in cells different from the cells delivered with or producing the dsRNA, it is called non-cell-autonomous RNAi. Depending on how the dsRNA is acquired by the cell, non-cell-autonomous RNAi can be grouped in two kinds: environmental RNAi and systemic RNAi. In environmental RNAi, dsRNA is absorbed by a cell from the surrounding environment. Therefore, this is seen in unicellular organisms or any cell lines when administered with dsRNA. Environmental RNAi does not necessarily result into systemic spread of the response. In multicellular organisms, silencing signal is transported from one cell to another by systemic RNAi.",

These secretory proteins are thus of major interest as targets for modulating the interaction. RNAi has been extensively used in functional genomics performed on C. elegans and opened up the possibility of deciphering the function of uncharacterized genes in other parasitic nematodes.

            "text": "There are overwhelming reports on managing PPNs using RNAi. In nematodes, systemic RNAi can be observed resulting in a gene knockout that spreads throughout the organism. This is because RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRP) is present in nematodes which interact with RISC and leads to production of new dsRNAs which are acted upon by Dicer enzymes and further produces new siRNAs (secondary siRNAs) in a well-coordinated amplification reaction. Therefore, the effect of dsRNA persists over development and also can be exported to neighboring cells thereby leading to silencing effect all over the organism (Daniel and John 2008) . C. elegans displays systemic RNAi wherein the dsRNA/siRNAs entering from the environment can spread from one cell to another. Studies on identification of effectors of systemic RNAi revealed presence of protein SID-1 in C. elegans (Winston et al. 2002; Feinberg and Hunter 2003) . Interestingly, M. incognita and M. hapla, along with other parasitic nematodes, despite exhibiting successful RNAi, were found deficient in SID-1 and other related proteins having a key role in dsRNA uptake and its spread. Several detailed comparative studies have postulated the presence of RNAi components in different PPNs and animal parasitic nematodes that were reported in C. elegans (Lendner et al. 2008; Dalzell et al. 2011; Haegeman et al. 2011) . All these studies found rare proteins taking part in RNAi pathway. Seventy-seven orthologous effectors in C. elegans were searched in 13 nematode species, Ancylostoma caninum, Oesophagostomum dentatum, Ascaris suum, Brugia malayi, C. brenneri, C. briggsae, C. japonica, C. remanei, Haemonchus contortus, Meloidogyne hapla, M. incognita, Pristionchus pacificus, and Trichinella spiralis, using reciprocal BLAST followed by domain structure verification (Maule et al. 2011) . It was concluded that effector deficiencies cannot, in any way, be associated with reduced susceptibility in parasitic nematodes. Surprisingly, minimum diversity was observed among these parasitic nematodes in most of the orthologous genes belonging to different functional groups (Table 4 .1). Thus it was evident that all the species possess varied proteins from across the RNAi spectrum each with alternative proteins which are yet to be fully identified and characterized.",

The silencing resulted in defects in embryonic patterning that was similar to loss of wingless (wg) function. This was the first study proving the function of frizzle through dsRNA microinjection in an insect (Kennerdell and Carthew 1998) . Since then, microinjection-based delivery has been used in several insect species. A comprehensive list of Hemipteran insects subjected to microinjection for studying RNAi is presented in Table 4 .3. Direct injection of dsRNA into the insect body leads to higher efficiency of gene expression attenuation compared to other methods. Nevertheless, there are several limitations in microinjection delivery method. In vitro synthesis of dsRNA is skill intensive and costly. Additionally, recovery of the insects, especially smaller insects, from aftershock of microinjection, is relatively low. The significant aftershock is due to damage of cuticle leading to adverse immune responses in the insect (Roxstrom-Lindquist et al. 2004) . Therefore, microinjection is rarely used in functional analysis of large number of genes from the point of view of insect-pest control. It is evident from Table 4.3 that in the microinjection, mediated delivery has been carried out mostly in the case of hemipteran insects.",

Usually after 24 h of injection, good RNAi effect is observed (Fire et al. 1998 ). In C. elegans, dsRNAs of genes like unc-22, unc-54, fem1, and hlh-1 were injected into the adult hermaphrodites, and the interference effect was observed. It was also proposed that in an antisense mechanism, interference of endogenous gene is due to the hybridization between the injected RNA and endogenous mRNA (Fire et al. 1998 ). It is a classical technique, and different target mRNAs can be used for injection simultaneously. However, microinjection has not been very successful in plant-parasitic nematodes in general and particularly in M. incognita. This is because of the small size of the infective stages and their inability to ingest fluid without host plant infection (Banerjee et al. 2017) . In this process, although the range of dsRNA concentrations can be used, the success rate relies upon ample uptake or absorption by the worms (Hull and Timmons 2004) .",

Several insect species of different taxa were studied for RNAi by the administration of dsRNA through artificial diet as presented in Table 4 .3. Araujo et al. (2006) fed the blood-sucking Rhodnius prolixus with an artificial diet containing dsRNA of the nitrophorin2 (Np2) gene and found that the saliva of control R. prolixus prolonged plasma coagulation by approximately fourfold compared with the saliva of Np2-knockdown R. prolixus. Feeding A. pisum with an artificial diet supplemented with dsRNA of the A. pisum aquaporin 1 (ApAQP1) gene caused attenuated expression of the target gene, which resulted in an increased osmotic pressure of the hemolymph in this insect (Shakesby et al. 2009 ).",

(2001) developed engineered bacteria deficient for RNaseIII producing high levels of dsRNA segments of a specific gene. C. elegans feeding on these engineered bacteria showed RNAi effect leading to loss-of-function phenotypes for the target genes. One of the advantages of this method is that it can be conducted for stage-specific RNAi experiments as worms of any stage can be fed with dsRNA (Kamath et al. 2001; Ahringer 2006 ). The feeding method has some major advantages over other methods of delivering dsRNA. These are as follows: (i) it is easy to perform; (ii) feeding dsRNA is less traumatic to the nymphs and juveniles than doing so via injections, the nymphs and juveniles remain healthier, and their mortality is comparatively lower (Shakesby et al. 2009 ); and (iii) perhaps most significantly, delivering dsRNAs in early stages of insects and nematodes is convenient by this method as compared to microinjection which needs special equipment and often causes high rate of mortality due to art effect. However, there are some challenges, viz., low efficiency of this method and requirement of large quantities of dsRNA, which need to be addressed. Moreover, a detailed study in understanding the mechanism of dsRNA delivery by ingestion for inhibiting gene expression is yet to be carried out.",

Apart from C. elegans, silencing of genes in plant-parasitic nematodes (PPN) through soaking technique has been popularly used but with minor modifications. Other techniques like feeding and microinjection possess some limitations with respect to PPNs. In microinjection, successful recovery of injected juveniles is difficult and PPN juveniles do not take up dsRNA orally easily from the solutions. This was overcome by Urwin et al.

In later studies, compounds like resorcinol and serotonin were used for successful uptake of dsRNA in M. incognita (Rosso et al. 2005; Huang et al. 2006) . Apart from neuroactive compounds, fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) as a marker for observing dsRNA uptake and as a mean of selecting affected individuals was used in many studies (Urwin et al. 2002; Rosso et al. 2005) . Intestinal gene cysteine proteinase was suppressed through the soaking method in G. pallida, H. glycines, and M. incognita (Nakai and Horton 1999; Schmidt et al. 1999) . Gene silencing by RNAi soaking has led to various abnormalities in processes like nematode hatching and molting and even resulted in reduced reproduction rates. Many genes, namely, chitin synthase, neuropeptides, msp, c-type lectin, and aminopeptidases, were targeted (Kennerdell and Carthew 1998; Schmidt et al. 1999; Dernburg and Karpen 2002; Ischizuka et al. 2002) . But the efficiency and duration of the silencing effect were assessed for M. incognita calreticulin (Mi-crt) and polygalacturonase (Mi-pg-1) (Rosso et al. 2005) . Other genes targeted by this approach are cellulases, pectate lyase, chorismate mutase, and glutathione-S transferase (Anandalakshmi et al. 1998; Cogoni and Macino 2000; Hammond et al. 2001; Matzke et al. 2001; Carmell et al. 2002) .

It delivers the dsRNA to the target insect pest in a continuous fashion that leads to elicitation of RNAi throughout the life cycle of the insects. Host-mediated delivery of dsRNA was first demonstrated against two important agricultural pests, cotton bollworm, Helicoverpa armigera, and Western corn rootworm, Diabrotica virgifera (Baum et al. 2007; Mao et al. 2007 ). Transgenic rice was developed by delivering dsRNA targeting hexose transporter gene NIHT1, carboxypeptidase gene NIcar, and the trypsin-like serine protease gene NItry of Nilaparvata lugens. The study revealed reduced transcript levels of these three targeted genes in the insects that fed on these transgenic rice plants. However, insect lethality was not reported (Zha et al. 2011 ). Subsequently, several attempts have been made for attenuating key genes of the insects through transgenic host-mediated delivery of dsRNA as presented in Table 4 .4. The gene construct for expression of the dsRNA essentially consists of 200-500 nucleotide tandem repeats of the target gene sequence under the control of a constitutive promoter. Such strategy also offers the scope of tissue specific expression of the dsRNA. For example, for targeting the phloem-feeding insect pests, phloem-specific expression of the dsRNA and their transport in phloem sieve elements would be more desirable. However, several attempts in this direction clearly indicated the effective level of protection would depend on targeting suitable target genes in addition to desired level of expression and delivery of intact dsRNA to the infesting insect pests (Price and Gatehouse 2008) . Further understanding of the uptake process and elicitation of RNAi by dsRNA in insects will facilitate tailoring the gene expression cassette of dsRNA in order to achieve effective protection. Mao et al. (2007) used RNAi-mediated approach to reduce insect's ability to cope up when exposed to xenobiotic compounds, for example, gossypol. Transgenic cotton plants expressing a hairpin dsRNA targeting gossypol-inducible (Mao et al. 2011 ), but were not lethal to the larvae. Interestingly, when a cysteine proteinase which is supposed to damage larval peritrophic matrix leading to higher accumulation of gossypol in the midgut was co-delivered, the tolerance was further enhanced (Mao et al. 2013 ). The similar strategy may be applicable for restoring insecticide sensitivity among resistant insect species (Bautista et al. 2009; Tanget al. 2012; Figueira-Mansur et al. 2013 ). The host-mediated RNAi for controlling insect pest has been considered to be particularly important for phloem-sucking hemipteran insect pests, viz., aphids. In green peach aphid, plant-mediated RNAi of several target insect-specific genes such as salivary proteins MpC002, MpPIntO1, and MpPIntO2 and the gut-specific gene Rack-1 showed reduced fecundity (Table 4 .3). In a similar study, stronger aphicidal activity of a hairpin RNA targeting V-ATPase E or the tubulin folding cofactor D (TBCD) was demonstrated (Guo et al. 2014 ). RNAi-mediated expression attenuation of a serine protease gene MySP in the green peach aphid, Myzus persicae, led to a remarkable decrease in their fecundity and parthenogeneticity (Bhatia et al. 2012 ). These studies on host-mediated delivery of dsRNA and elicitation of RNAi in infesting aphids demonstrated potential of RNAi approach for developing genetic resistance against aphids. Mao and Zeng (2014) reported reduced attack by aphids on transgenic tobacco plants expressing dsRNA against the gap gene hunchback, and reproduction rate of aphids was also retarded.",

By far HD-RNAi is the most successful methodology for developing resistance against nematodes in important crops. This technique exploits the capability of PPNs of ingesting macromolecules from the host plants. Specifically, the method involves producing dsRNA construct and developing transformed plants by Agrobacterium-mediated transformation. For generating dsRNA, a part of the target gene is cloned in sense and antisense orientation separated by an intron or spacer region and expressed under a constitutive or tissue-specific promoter. Majority of researchers have adopted this time-consuming methodology and have successfully developed transgenics resistant against nematodes. Another new approach with rapid screening system has been developed involving hairy root method for transformation of crops like soybean, tomato, and sugar beet.",

            "text": "The dsRNA uptake mechanism in insects is known to be achieved by either of the two pathways, viz., a protein-mediated pathway and via endocytic pathway. The major component of protein-mediated pathway is a multi-pass transmembrane protein known as systemic RNA interference deficient-1 (Sid-1) which exports the small interfering RNAs across neighboring cells (Bansal and Michel 2013) . The second pathway is receptor-mediated pathway. In case of C. elegans, the endocytic pathway involves a Sid-2 gene localized in intestinal cells. It encodes a membrane protein and is thought to import dsRNA from the intestinal lumen which are then exported to other cells with the help of sid-1 channels (Winston et al. 2007; McEwan et al. 2012) . Hence, Sid-1 and Sid-2 proteins must work in conjunction to achieve environmental RNAi. Sid-1 genes have been reported to be evolutionarily conserved among insects orders, but Sid-2 gene is absent in insects. Tribolium is considered as the model insect for studying systemic RNAi with presence of Sid-1 like proteins. However, the Sid-1 gene of Tribolium was found orthologous to Tag-130 gene of C. elegans and not Ce-Sid-1 gene interestingly, where Tag-130 has not been reported to be associated with systemic RNAi in nematodes (Tomoyasu et al. 2008) . The presence of Sid-1-like channel proteins varies among different orders of insects. The involvement of Sid-1-like channel proteins in dsRNA uptake has been reported in brown plant hopper [BPH, Nilaparvata lugens (Xu et al. 2013) ], the Colorado potato beetle [CPB, Leptinotarsa decemlineata (Cappelle et al. 2016)] , and the red flour beetle Tribolium castaneum (Tomoyasu et al. 2008) . In 2016, genes involved in RNAi pathway in insects were identified and classified. The study reveals absence of Sid-1/Tag-130 orthologs in Diptera order (Dowling et al. 2016) . It was suggested that in Drosophila melanogaster, dsRNA uptake is mediated via endocytic pathway along with pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) based on a study by Ulvila et al. (2006) . This study reports more than 90% reduction in the uptake of double-stranded RNA on silencing of these two receptors by RNAi technology. Most of the studies examining dsRNA uptake so far focused on either the endocytic pathway or Sid-1like dependent system. However, a clear understanding of the roles of these pathways on dsRNA uptake across the insect species is still lacking. Nevertheless, insects belonging to another order have been reported to have both the Sid-1-like channel proteins and receptor-mediated endocytosis pathways playing a role in dsRNA uptake (Cappelle et al. 2016) .",

The dataset recognizes sid-1orthologs in two parasitic nematodes, viz., in Haemonchus contortus and Oesophagostomum dentatum only. The Sid-2 protein was not found to be present in other nematode species. Intriguingly, the plant-parasitic nematodes such as Meloidogyne and Globodera spp. despite the absence of Sid-1 and Sid-2 genes exhibit systemic RNAi when subjected to silencing technology indicating a presence of similar receptor-mediated endocytic process for dsRNA uptake as reported in insects ).

Direct toxic effect was also observed even when the dsRNA concentration was reduced to 200 ppm (Zhao and Chen 2013) . In spider mite, gene silencing and increased mortality rate was observed when 160 ppm of dsRNA, targeting several genes, was employed via permeated leaf disc assay (Kwon et al. 2013) . In another mite, Varroa destructor, an ectoparasite of the honey bee, Apis mellifera, both the delivery methods of dsRNA, i.e., by immersing mites in a dsRNA solution or by host-mediated RNAi, wherein dsRNA was fed to the honey bees and eventually delivered to mites, were found to attenuate the target gene expression through environmental RNAi (Campbell et al. 2010; Garbian et al. 2012) .",

However, there are many limitations which need to be taken care of for successful deployment of RNAi technology. There are several factors which need to be carefully looked into while designing RNAi experiments, including the off-target effects, dsRNA design, length and concentration of dsRNA, and many more. Therefore, to ensure a successful and effective RNAi-based silencing, these factors need to be balanced optimally. In case of insects, persistency of RNAi is a major problem due to which an optimum amount of dsRNA needs to be determined for an effective silencing. Interestingly, it is not true for every order of insect which is to be managed. For instance, about 60% (or lower) of gene knockdown was reported in certain recalcitrant insect species, while in coleopterans, 90% knockdown of gene was successfully achieved ensuing a long-lasting hereditary (Baum et al. 2007; Huvenne and Smagghe 2010; Zhu et al. 2011; Bolognesi et al. 2012; Rangasamy and Siegfried 2012; Li et al. 2013) . Not only in insects but in nematodes also barriers like off-target effects have been reported while performing RNAi technology based management approaches. Designing an effective siRNA sequence is a major limitation in RNAi technology-based silencing. The following are some major barriers.",

Therefore, one of the most important aspects is avoidance of nonspecific target effects. It is the sequence used that determines possible off-target effects in the target organism and also in other species. Other than sequence, off-target effects can arise due to wide range of siRNAs being produced from a single dsRNA which increases the chance of nontarget effects. There are many reports of off-target effects, for instance, in triatomid bug R. prolixus, two homologous nitroprin genes were silenced other than the targeted gene (Araujo et al. 2006) .

The gene selected should have a crucial role in the concerned organism, and genes involved in parasitism or development are likely candidate genes fulfilling all such requirements. Moreover, it should be highly specific and not conserved across different genera (Danchin et al. 2013 ) especially in pollinators. Next stage is to choose a suitable target site from the selected target gene. It is necessary to ensure the designing of a species-specific dsRNA. For identifying potential target sites for eliciting effective RNAi, bioinformatic tools are available online. Specificity of the dsRNAs could be conferred by either targeting conserved domain or variable region depending on the candidate gene with the aim to minimize possibility of affecting any unintended genes or organisms. This is particularly important to ensure that dsRNAs targeting agricultural pests should not possess any overlapping similarity to the genes of beneficial pollinators. By targeting the UTR regions, even closely related homologous genes can be selectively silenced through RNAi as demonstrated in D. melanogaster, T. castaneum, A. pisum, and tobacco hornworms, Manduca sexta, with respect to vATPase gene (Whyard et al. 2009 ).The concept of dsRNAs being used as tailor-made pesticides is emerging wherein highly specific dsRNAs are employed against havoc-creating pests and are also eco-friendly to the environment.",

In red flour beetle, the length and concentration of dsRNA had profound effect on efficiency as well as persistence of the RNAi effect, for example, 60-and 30-bp dsRNAs induced 70 and 30% of gene knockdown, respectively (Miller et al. 2012 ). In the same study, it has been also shown that multiple dsRNAs, when injected together, led to competitive inhibition influencing the effectiveness of RNAi. In contrary, dsRNA longer than 200 nucleotides and likely to generate multiple siRNAs contribute efficient RNAi response (Andrade and Hunter 2016) . Multiple siRNAs will help in overcoming the target resistance that may arise due to polymorphism in the target. However, more studies are warranted to understand unambiguously the effect of length and concentration of dsRNAs on the initial efficiency and persistence of the RNAi effect.",

In addition to being a rapid and costeffective method, this method allows monitoring expression of the genes throughout the insect body and thus broadening the base of target selection. Using Illumina parallel sequencing technology, abundance of >90,000 transcripts from trypanosome libraries was scored before and after induction of RNAi. The results led to constitution of non-redundant set of protein-coding sequences (CDS) comprising \u223c7500 genes (Alsford et al. (2011) . Thus these methods can derive core set of essential gene loci if genome sequence of the organism is known. RNAi-mediated attenuation of these core loci is most likely to significantly retard survival and fitness of the insect pests.",

A few other designs, for instance, siRNAs without 3\u2032-overhangs and single 3\u2032-overhang structures in the guide strand, have been active in gene silencing (Czauderna et al. 2003; Lorenz et al. 2004 ).",

Certain products based on RNAi-mediated resistance such as Monsanto's SmartStax Pro, for control of Western corn earworm, and DuPont Pioneer's Plenish high oleic acid soybean (Majumdar et al. 2017 ) are likely to be commercialized soon. However, efficacy of these plants remains to be proven in actual field situations. Diverse classes of biotic factors, affecting crop production worldwide, have shown varied levels of susceptibility toward RNAi, which warrants need for modified and improved versions of dsRNA delivery methods. The better understanding of host-pest interaction and the genetic basis of parasitism are likely to generate more potential target genes for effective HD-RNAi. CRISPR/Cas system has come up as a powerful technique in creating knockout mutants to unravel complex mechanism of parasitism and thus paves the way for identification of the key pest genes. Transplastomic expression of dsRNA in the plants would be a further improvement for achieving higher expression. Applying dsRNA through methods with low environmental risks, for instance, irrigation water, root drench, or trunk injection, would obviate the need for genetic transformation. These methods result in localized application along with rapid breakdown of dsRNA and therefore likely to be more acceptable from a biosafety point of view (Joga et al. 2016) . Successful demonstration of using layered double hydroxide clay nanosheets for topical application of dsRNA against viruses (Mitter et al. 2017) opens up possibilities of applying dsRNA like any other protective agrochemicals.",

RNAi-mediated loss-offunction phenotypes not only determine functions of unknown genes but also lead to identification of new specific targets for managing pest or improving agricultural traits. But understanding RNAi mechanism is of utmost importance as RNAi machinery varies from genus to genus. There are several shortcomings that need to be addressed, for instance, persistence of silencing effects, off-target effects of silencing, etc. Not only this, the biosafety, risk assessment, and government regulations related to commercialization of RNAi-based transgenics still have to be developed. The revelation of RNAi technology has revolutionized the area of research in biotechnology. Not only in pest management, the wide range of RNAi application includes modification of agronomic traits, eliminating mycotoxin contamination, improving nutritional value of crops, etc. It is also proving its worth in RNAi-based therapeutics research for human welfare. In toto, this technology is a potential boon in the arsenal of the scientific community to address the challenges associated with climatic changes, burgeoning population, and sustainability of human race.",
