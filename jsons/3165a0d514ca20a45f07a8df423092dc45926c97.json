The true incidence of tick paralysis in the United States remains unclear as reporting is not mandatory, and many cases are likely attributed to other causes of flaccid paralysis such as Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome.",

Both tick paralysis and GBS can involve the cranial nerves with GBS most often involving cranial nerve VII but also III, IV, and VI. Pupils are rarely dilated in GBS. And CSF will show elevated protein in GBS. MRI imaging is usually normal. Miller-Fischer variant of GBS typically presents with ophthalmoplegia, ataxia, and areflexia without muscular weakness.Transverse myelitis may also present with flaccid paralysis and may present with fever depending upon the cause. Pain and sensory complaints are common. Dilated pupils are absent. CSF evaluation in transverse myelitis will show an elevated WBC and often protein.
