Innate immunity provides a vital bridge between first exposure of the na\u00efve host and subsequent elaboration of specific antibody and T-cell responses, which is extremely important for clearing virus. Viral RNA is recognized through a variety of pattern recognition receptors (PRRs), including Toll-like receptor (TLR)3, TLR7, TLR8, retinoic acid-inducible gene I (RIG)-I and nucleotide-binding domain-like receptor protein (NLRP)3. Once viral RNA is recognized by PRRs, pro-inflammatory cytokines are secreted, such as type I interferons (IFNs), which induce an antiviral state in neighboring cells. Cytokine secretion leads to the recruitment of innate immune cells, which instruct the adaptive immune response for specific killing of influenza-infected cells [4].",

Excessive numbers of monocytes drive immune pathology in severe influenza; however, by reducing recruitment of inflammatory monocytes to the lung, there is a decreased CD8+ T-cell response leading to compromised viral clearance [13]. Recruited monocytes also respond to influenza virus infection by differentiating into monocyte-derived macrophages and monocyte-derived dendritic cells [14].",

The major function of dendritic cells during the antiviral response is to process and present viral antigenic peptides to antigen-specific CD8+ and CD4+ T cells to establish an adaptive immune response [17]. Dendritic cells mainly obtain viral proteins via ingestion of virus-infected cells, as few viruses directly infect dendritic cells. Following ingestion, viral particles are mainly presented on MHC class I molecules through a process known as cross-presentation. Cross-presentation is important as it enables dendritic cells to activate CD8+ T cells, which are required for viral clearance [18].",

Following dendritic cell presentation of viral antigens in the draining lymph nodes, na\u00efve virus-specific T cells undergo a process of activation, proliferation and differentiation to become effector T cells that can migrate to the site of infection and mediate antiviral immune responses [21]. Infection with influenza virus induces differentiation of effector CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, however the contribution of CD4+ T cells to virus clearance is minor, compared to CD8+ T cells. In influenza infection, the primary role of CD4+ T cells involves supporting the activation and differentiation of B cells, leading to antibody production, and memory responses. Effector CD8+ T cells are major players in viral clearance and are essential for elimination of infected cells [22]. CD8+ effector T cells mediate viral clearance through three distinct mechanisms. First, CD8+ T cells can induce lysis of infected cells through exocytosis of perforin and granzyme containing granules. Second, CD8+ T cells can trigger TNF receptor (TNFR) family-dependent apoptosis in infected or stressed cells through either Fas ligand or TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL). Third, when encountered with virus-infected cells, CD8+ T cells can produce pro-inflammatory mediators, such as IFN-\u03b3, which is important for viral clearance [21].",

From this evaluation, the authors discovered that a neutrophil-driven response was the most dominant host factor in disease progression. Notably, the authors identified a neutrophil-driven inflammatory loop that could directly amplify tissue damage and exacerbate inflammation.

Their findings confirmed that neutrophils were primarily responsible for causing immunopathology, lung inflammation and subsequently the development of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Importantly, the authors further discovered that neutrophil extracellular trap (NET) formation correlated with tissue damage. By examining lung histopathology and NET activity, they found that NETs directly caused tissue damage to alveoli, epithelium and the vascular structure in the infected lung.

The patient cohort include those with mild infection (n = 47), moderate infection (n = 34) and severe infection (n = 28) [23]. The findings of this study confirmed previous animal studies; they showed that neutrophil response was the primary host factor in determining the course of illness. Indeed, an excessive neutrophil response was consistently found in most patients with severe disease. Another study by Guan et al. investigated the host response profile of severe influenza infection, using a small case-series of patients with severe H7N9 infection [24]. This study also identified neutrophil response as the most critical factor in severe disease. Collectively, these human studies confirm findings from previous animal studies and pinpoint an aberrant neutrophil response as the main cause of disease progression in influenza infection.",

            "text": "Influenza virus likely interacts with systemic host factors (e.g., circulating neutrophils) during the course of infection. Unravelling this interaction is key to understanding influenza pathogenesis and, in particular, to exploring the mechanism by which influenza infection evolves from lung inflammation to multiorgan failure. Most influenza infection begins in airway and the infection spreads locally to other parts of the lung. The mechanism by which the virus interacts with local immune cells is well studied and much of the molecular/cellular details have already been elucidated. By contrast, the mechanism by which influenza virus interacts with host factors outside the lung, such as circulating immune cells, remains relatively unknown. This is largely due to the established dogma that influenza virus does not circulate outside the lung and, by extension, influenza virus is not expected to interact with circulating immune cells (e.g., neutrophils). This \u2018lung-centric\u2019 paradigm has recently been challenged by new evidence. Several studies showed that influenza virus can indeed be carried by immune cells from lung to non-lung tissues [25\u201327]. These \u2018virus carrying\u2019 immune cells include professional antigen presenting cells such as monocytes, macrophage and dendritic cells [28\u201330]. These cells pick up influenza virus RNA during their encountering and processing of virus infected cells (e.g., epithelium) in the early phase of infection (Fig. 35.1). After processing of dead/infected cells, these cells carry influenza virus RNA within them, migrate towards local draining lymph nodes and subsequently into the systemic circulation.\n",

Their findings provide strong support to the notion that the influenza virus transcriptome is transported by \u2018carrier\u2019 immune cells (e.g., macrophages or dendritic cells) within the systematic circulation, thereby enabling the dissemination of influenza virus transcriptome loads to distant organs [28, 32].",

Both direct and indirect processes may extend beyond the infected lung, since \u2018carrier\u2019 immune cells can transport influenza virus transcriptome to distant organs where a further encounter with recruited neutrophils may trigger local release of NETs into the affected organs. Indeed, in animal models, influenza virus transcriptome can be detected in major organs in the infected host (heart, spleen, kidney, brain, liver) [32]. Furthermore, a recent study showed that neutrophils can be infected by influenza virus [33]. Once infected, these neutrophils become \u2018carrier\u2019 immune cells themselves. They then go on to spread neutrophil-induced inflammation (e.g., NETs, myeloperoxidase, reactive oxygen species) elsewhere or allow actively replicating virions to \u2018seed\u2019 the target organs. Collectively, both direct and indirect tissue injury mechanisms extend an initially lung-centered pathology to other major organs with the ensuing development of organ dysfunction (e.g., myocarditis, acute kidney injury). In light of this, the traditional \u2018lung-centric\u2019 view of influenza pathogenesis requires revision to incorporate a multisystem view of organ dysfunction influenza pathogenesis (Fig. 35.3).\n",
