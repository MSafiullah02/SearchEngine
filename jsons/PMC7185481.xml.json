This subsequently results in inflammation of the affected lung tissue. Clinically, it can be defined as the presence of signs and symptoms of pneumonia such as fever, tachypnoea and cough in a previously well child. In young children these symptoms may be non-specific.",

Consequently, a significant proportion of cases have no pathogen identified, findings mirrored in many prospective epidemiological studies involving numerous specimen types such as blood and sputum. This raises assumptions and poses challenges on adopting an evidence-based approach to managing CAP, in particular on appropriate antibiotic and/or antiviral use. Resultantly, measurements such as blood white cell count and C - reactive protein are utilized as proxies to guide us on the nature and severity of the infection. Whilst these are regarded as useful measurements they do not necessarily allow us to direct our treatment towards specific pathogens. This commonly results in viral pneumonia being treated unnecessarily with antibiotics. This stratifies a clear need for better diagnostic methods.",

Future studies, with further advances in current techniques and development of better methods to detect infections from a wider range of pathogens, will broaden our understanding of the cause of CAP further elucidating new vaccine development.Practice points\n\u2022Community Acquired Pneumonia remains the major cause of morbidity and mortality in the developed and developing world.\u2022Newer techniques have aided in qualifying the true burden of CAP aetiology\u2022Viruses remain the commonest cause\u2022Commonest viruses implicated are RSV and Influenza A whilst the commonest bacteria implicated are S. pneumoniae, H. influenzae and S. aureus\n\u2022In the absence of isolation of a causative organism, oral amoxicillin is the antibiotic of choice\n\n",
