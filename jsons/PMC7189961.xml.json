Microbes play an important role in soil aggregate formation and soil stability that confer fertility and productivity to soil. The soil microbes participate in these processes through many ways, e.g., filamentous microbes assemble clay particles using extensive network of hyphae resulting into soil aggregates. Additionally, some microbes secrete exopolysaccharides or cause compaction of clay particles that promote soil aggregation. The surface soil is always rich in indigenous population of bacteria (including actinomycetes), fungi, algae, and protozoans. Additionally, human and animal activities also introduce specific microbes in the soil by several ways. Human activity directly adds bacteria as biodegradative agents or applying sewage sludge to agricultural fields. Animals introduce microbes through bird dropping or excretion.",

The ability of microbes to survive in aerosol is related to the organism\u2019s surface biochemistry. One possible explanation of this fact could be a structural change in lipid bilayers of the cell membrane in response to very low humidity. During loss of water, the cell membrane bilayer changes from the typical crystalline structure to a gel phase and affects the surface protein configuration resulting into inactivation of the cell. The viruses with enveloped nucleocapsids (e.g., influenza virus) have longer airborne survival in low relative humidity below 50 %, whereas viruses without nucleocapsids (e.g., enteric viruses) are able to survive in high relative humidity above 50 %.",

Lentic habitats are dominated by phytoplankton, forming distinct community gradients based upon the wavelength and the amount of light that penetrates to a depth, e.g., Chlorobium. Chlorobium can utilize longer wavelength than other phototrophs and survive with little or no oxygen by consuming H2S instead of H2O for photosynthesis. In freshwater environment, two types of lakes are present: eutrophic and oligotrophic lakes. Oligotrophic lakes have higher rate (20\u2013120 mg carbon/m3/day) than eutrophic lakes (1\u201330 mg carbon/m3/day) because eutrophic lakes have much higher levels of organic matter causing turbidity and interfering with light penetration.

Despite this, estuaries are highly productive environments, e.g., mangrove swamps in the Everglades of Florida, USA. Estuaries are generally turbid due to the large amount of organic matter brought by rivers and the mixing action of tides; therefore, light penetration is poor. Primary producers vary from 100 to 107organisms/ml and in relation to depth and proximity to littoral zones.

On the basis of the precise depth, pelagic habitat is subdivided into epipelagic and benthopelagic zones. Epipelagic zone is found in upper 100 m of the water column, and a large proportion of organisms living in it are photosynthetic, whereas benthopelagic zone is sea-sediment interface.

The main mechanism of salt tolerance operates by internal sequestration of high balancing solute (K+ in bacteria and glycerol in halotolerant eukaryotes) equal to external salt concentration. A second mechanism of salt tolerance involves proteins with acidic and low proportion of nonpolar amino acids. These proteins require high salt concentrations to balance their charge for their optimal activity.

Both exist in various cell shapes, e.g., cocci, rods, or spirals, and some soil bacteria form branching filaments, e.g., actinomycetes. Their DNA is found free in the cell cytoplasm and lack a true nuclear envelope, and the genome is mainly composed of single double-stranded DNA molecule with smaller DNA elements known as plasmids. The size of bacterial genome typically ranges from four to six million nucleotides in length and enable to code 3,000\u20134,000 genes. A bacterial cell envelope is composed of two layers, the inner layer is cell membrane made of phospholipids and the outer layer is cell wall made of proteins, carbohydrates, and lipids, but its composition varies based on the type of organism. Most of the microbes move through flagella (whiplike extensions from the cell) and file filaments, e.g., pili. The pili enable them to attach with each other or to soil particles. Additionally these pili are also involved in transfer of genetic material between bacterial cells, known as conjugation. These microbes usually reproduce asexually, e.g., binary fission, resulting in the formation of two genetically identical bacterial cells. On the basis of gram staining, bacteria are of two types: gram positive and gram negative; both vary in cell structure and physiology (Fig. 3.3). Bacteria and archaea both require carbon as building blocks of their cellular materials and energy to drive the reactions involved in cell biosynthesis and metabolism. Most of the bacteria utilize oxygen, whereas some bacteria and archaea grow anaerobically by using alternative electron acceptors, e.g., nitrate and sulfate.\n",

Fungi are basically heterotroph organisms meaning thereby that they derive their food from nonliving organic sources, e.g., saprophytic fungi, which feed on dead or decaying organic materials. Few fungi also exist as unicellular organisms, e.g., yeast, which grow through cylindrical threadlike structures (2\u201310 cm in diameter) known as hyphae. These hyphae may be either septate, e.g., compartmentalized through cross walls, or nonseptate. The hypha is a main part of fungus and constitutes a mycelium. Finely branched mycelium occupies a large surface area in the soil and produces a range of enzymes acting on soil organic matter to produce nutrients and energy required for fungal growth. Fungi can reproduce by both sexually, e.g., through spores, and asexually, e.g., budding or binary fission. Fungi are highly diverse and play a wide range of role in their surrounding environment such as decomposers, mutualists, endophytes of plants, pathogens, and predators.

Protists may be free living, parasitic, or opportunistic based on environmental changes. The size of protists varies from 2 \u03bcm to several centimeters. These are classified into four groups: flagellates (Mastigophora), amoebae (Sarcodina), sporozoans (Sporozoa), and ciliates (Ciliophora). Flagellates are characterized by the presence of flagella as a locomotive tool, multiplication by binary fission, and having both heterotrophic and autotrophic feeding mechanisms. Flagellates are further classified into two major divisions: photosynthesizing (Phytomastigophora) and non-photosynthesizing (Zoomastigophora). Autotrophic flagellates possess chloroplast and synthesize their own food or nutrients by photosynthesis such as Euglena, whereas heterotrophic flagellates are parasitic and take their nutrients from their host, for example, Leishmania and Giardia. Amoebae have pseudopodia as their locomotive tool. Pseudopodia help in ingestion of food materials and provide an extended basis of further classification. The Rhizopoda move by a fluid endoplasm, whereas the Actinopoda have a spikelike pseudopodium for their movement and feeding. These organisms are vacuolated and covered in a shell-like outer layer known as \u201ctest.\u201d These shells may be composed of proteinaceous, siliceous, or calcareous substances and have either a single or multiple chambers. Some testate amoebae are also found in soil, building their shells by excreting substances capable of aggregating soil particles. Some important free-living soil amoebae are grouped in the family Vahikampfia. Entamoeba is well-known parasitic amoeboid causing dysentery in humans. The ciliates have hairlike structures in an ordered array surrounding the cell known as cilia that divides by transverse fission. Cilia help in their locomotion and feeding. Ciliates are generally free living such as Paramecium, but some species are adapted to parasitic life cycles. Sporozoans are mostly parasitic and form spores. Few members are adapted in a symbiotic relationship and have no locomotive organ; therefore, they rely on vectors or direct contact with susceptible host to continue their growth and replication. For example, some species have evolved to enable digestion in the gut of domestic livestock. However, parasitic members are totally dependent on host for their nutrition, for example, Toxoplasma, Isospora, and Plasmodium. Most of parasitic protists are of obvious public health concern causing deadly diseases such as malaria, sleeping sickness, Chagas disease, leishmaniasis, giardiasis, cryptosporidiosis, etc. These parasites have adapted themselves for surviving and reproducing in their hosts by evading host immune responses. Many flagellated protists are capable of forming cysts that are known to survive conventional methods of disinfection and can be transmitted to their host via a water route. Entamoeba histolytica is a parasitic amoeba and causes diarrhea and dysentery. Naegleria is a free-living amoeba in freshwater, causing infections in nasal passage of humans and capable of invading brain tissues. Toxoplasma is an invasive protist that causes blindness and serious illness or death in unborn fetuses. Cryptosporidium is responsible for a number of epidemics including the largest US waterborne outbreak in Milwaukee. Plasmodium is a main causative agent of mosquito-borne disease, malaria. Domestic animals are also at risk of serious illness and death from parasitic protozoans, for example, Histomonas, Trichomonas, etc.",

A number of protein capsomers held together by non-covalent bonds form a capsid coast surrounding the nucleic acid molecule. The size of capsids ranges from 18 \u03bcm, as in small parvovirus of animals, to several hundred nanometers, as in some filamentous plant viruses.

The sulfur cycle, in particular, involves some unique groups of prokaryotes. Two unrelated groups of prokaryotes oxidize H2S to S and S to SO4.

This makes everything more complicated, and the food chain becomes a food web. A food web is made up of interconnected food chains. Most communities include various populations of producer organisms that are eaten by a number of consumer populations (Fig. 3.12). The green crab, for example, is a consumer as well as a decomposer. The crab will eat dead things or living things if it can catch them. A secondary consumer may also eat a number of primary consumers or producers. This nonlinear set of interactions which shows the complex flow of energy in nature is more easily visualized. In a food web, nutrients are recycled by decomposers in the end. Animals like shrimp and crabs can break the materials down to detritus. Then bacteria reduce the detritus to nutrients. Decomposers work at every level, setting free nutrients that form an essential part of food chain. Large number of primary producers such as bacteria and algae can maintain the base of pyramid to balance the biomass in trophic levels. In a food chain, energy is lost in each step of the chain in two forms, first by the organism producing heat and doing work and second by the food that is not completely digested or absorbed. Therefore, the food web depends on the constant supply of energy from producer and nutrients that are recycled by the decomposition of organism.\n",

First, microbes either through direct interaction with the plants or indirectly through influencing biotic or abiotic parameters of soil supply minerals to support plant growth. Second, some microbes inhibit the growth and activity of plant pathogens to promote plant growth. Third, few microbes produce phytohormones that stimulate the growth of plants (Table 3.4). Additionally, some saprophytic microbes establish neutral interactions with plants without directly benefiting or harming them. These microbes enrich soil nutrient levels by decomposing organic components and thereby influence their productivity and growth. The plant rhizosphere is the major soil ecological environment for plant-microbe interactions. In rhizosphere different microbes colonize around growing roots, which may either result in symbiotic, neutralistic, or parasitic interactions depending upon nutritional status of soil, soil environment, plant defense mechanism, and the type of microbial proliferation in the rhizosphere zone. The microbial community living in the rhizosphere zone benefits plant by promoting their growth and are also known as plant growth-promoting rhizobacteria (PGPR). These PGPRs include various bacteria, e.g., Azospirillum, Bacillus, Pseudomonas, Rhizobium, Serratia, Stenotrophomonas, and Streptomyces and fungi, e.g., Ampelomyces, Coniothyrium, Trichoderma, etc. These PGPRs support plant growth by increasing soil fertility, secreting phytohormones, and protecting them from various diseases by producing antibiotics and inducing plant defense system. Pseudomonas and Bacillus are well-studied PGPRs and dominating bacteria, present in rhizosphere. PGPR bacteria have following roles to play:\nPGPR bacteria suppress the growth of pathogenic microbes by lowering iron availability through secretion of low molecular weight siderophores.PGPR can reduce the activity of pathogenic microorganisms by activating the plant to induced systemic resistance (ISR) or systemic acquired resistance (SAR). These plant resistance systems are induced by signaling molecules, e.g., jasmonic acid, ethylene, and salicylic acid.PGPR bacteria enhance the production of phytohormones (e.g., auxin, cytokinin, gibberellins), besides having nitrogen-fixing ability. These phytohormones play a critical role in root initiation, cell division, and cell growth. Auxin is most prominently secreted by Azospirillum spp.Several commercial PGPRs support plant growth by several means such as bioprotectants, biostimulants, and biofertilizers.PGPR bacteria, e.g., Azospirillum, also provide nutrition to plants by liberating phosphorous from organic compounds and thereby support plant growth.\n",

During this symbiotic relationship, plant root releases elicitors of nod gene expression, bacteria releases Nod factor, and plant root demonstrates ion flux, expresses nodulin proteins, and undergoes nodule morphogenesis. The plant supports metabolism of bacterial endosymbionts by providing a micro-aerobic environment for effective functioning of the oxygen-sensitive nitrogenase, encoded by bacterial nif genes and carbohydrates. In return, bacteria fix atmospheric nitrogen for plants to meet their biological needs. The other diazotrophs such as Azotobacter, Azospirillum, as well as rhizosphere fungi and bacteria especially Pseudomonas and Bacillus also interact with Rhizobium affecting nodulation and nitrogen fixation and help in creating a beneficiary region where interacting microbes get benefit from additional nutrient resources. Therefore, a mutualistic relationship exists between Azotobacter and Azospirillum where both interact with Rhizobium to improve plant growth, and these beneficiary effects are mainly attributed to improvements in root development, increase in water and mineral uptake by roots, the displacement of fungi and pathogenic bacteria, and, to lesser extent, biological nitrogen fixation (Heath and Tiffin 2009). Nodule formation involves expression of rhizobia specific genes: bacterial genes (nod genes) and plant genes (nodulin genes). The component, enzymes, and their function are leghemoglobin (protection against oxygen), nitrogenase (N2 fixation), glutamine synthetase (N-detoxification), and uricase (N-detoxification).",

In a mycorrhizal association, the fungus colonizes the host plant roots either intracellularly as in arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF or AM) or extracellularly as in ectomycorrhizal fungi (Sikes 2010). In ectomycorrhiza, a fungus does not enter into plant cell, whereas it colonizes the outer cell layers and forms a hartig net. Hartig net is a soil network that connects several organisms and protects against pathogenic fungi and soil bacteria. In this association, fungi form a net around the roots (hairs) to extend their access to soil nutrients. Ectomycorrhiza promotes growth of tree seedlings and germination of seeds. This mutualistic association provides the fungus with relatively constant and direct access to carbohydrates such as glucose and sucrose. The carbohydrates are translocated from their source (usually leaves) to root tissue and on to the plant\u2019s fungal partners. In return, the plant gains the benefits of the mycelium\u2019s higher absorptive capacity for water and mineral nutrients due to the comparatively large surface area of the mycelium/root ratio, thus improving the plant\u2019s mineral absorption capabilities. Additionally, mycorrhizal plants are often more resistant to disease caused by soilborne pathogens and metal toxicity. The mycorrhizal fungi, especially the vesicular arbuscular mycorrhizae (VAM) belonging to the Zygomycetes class, play an important role in phosphorous mobilization in soils having a relatively low level of available phosphorous for the better growth of cereals as well as legumes.

However, symptoms may vary with photoperiod, variety of plants, temperature, humidity, and infective dose. Some plant pathogenic microbes cause severe economically damaging disease such as spots, mosaic patterns, or pustules on leaves and fruits, smelly tuber rots, etc. (Table 3.5).

Although most plant disease is caused by fungi (85 %), only a small fraction of fungi in the environment cause disease. Plant pathogenic fungi have played a powerful role in human and natural history. Fungal pathogens produce toxins causing allergies, e.g., mushrooms produce hallucinogenic mycotoxins (black molds).

Microbes protect our environment from hazardous compounds by using a technique known as bioremediation and keeping our environment healthy. This chapter also provides evidences to explore PGPRs in sustainable agriculture to improve productivity and other environmental prospects. Therefore, current agricultural practices need to be improved through use of biopesticides and biofertilizers in order to minimize environmental and health problems.",
