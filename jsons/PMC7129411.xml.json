The adsorption isotherm for proteins onto adsorbent is typically modeled by the Langmuir isotherm equationQ=QmCKd+C,where Q\nm is the maximum equilibrium adsorption capacity and K\nd the dissociation constant. Q and C are the adsorbed and aqueous protein concentration in equilibrium, respectively. The isotherm in Fig. 2\nwas clearly observed which resembled the linear portion of a Langmuirian isotherm. The maximum adsorption capacity (Q\nm) of NP protein to the Streamline chelating is 58.48 mg of NP protein per gram of adsorbent and the dissociation constant (K\nd) is 3.04 mg ml\u22121. This high binding capacity could be exploited to reduce the amount of adsorbent used and thus decreases the material cost. Therefore, Streamline chelating was chosen to purify NP protein from unclarified E. coli feedstock. Indeed, Clemmitt and Chase [22] have reported that Streamline chelating has very high binding capacity when compared to other similar base matrices with different ligands.",

            "text": "The most important factor in choosing the suitable buffer solution for the adsorption and desorption of proteins depends on the pH and ionic strength to be used. The equilibrium adsorption data in various pH of clarified and unclarified feedstock are summarized in Table 1\n. The results show that the optimal binding pH for NP protein onto the Streamline chelating for both feedstocks is pH 8. Indeed, Clemmitt and Chase [26] have reported that the range of pH for the adsorption of proteins onto a metal-IDA adsorbent is between 7 and 8. The adsorption of protein onto the immobilized metals occurs at pH higher than its pK\na. Since the pK\na of histidine residues is about pH 7 [27], pH 8 has become the optimal pH for its binding. However, further increase of pH to 8.5 has substantially reduced the binding capacity of Streamline chelating adsorbent. The highest equilibrium binding capacity of Ni2+-loaded Streamline chelating adsorbents for NP protein achieved at pH 8.0 was about 13.74 and 10.90 mg ml\u22121 of adsorbents for unclarified and clarified feedstocks, respectively. The results show that the binding capacity of Streamline chelating adsorbent was not affected by the presence of biomass. Hence, the unclarified feedstock can be directly applied onto the IMAC-EBAC for the purification of NP protein. The direct purification from unclarified feedstock has several advantages such as reduction in processing time, cost, and higher recovery yield. Indeed, substantial amount of NP protein was lost during the clarification process [10]. Only a small fraction of total protein (about 10\u201320% and most of them were NP protein) bound to the Ni2+-loaded Streamline chelating adsorbents for both clarified and unclarified feedstocks. This suggests that the binding of non-specific proteins to Ni2+-loaded Streamline chelating adsorbent is very little, which is an important feature of IMAC adsorbent.",

The bed height increased linearly with the superficial velocity and can be described by the Richardson\u2013Zaki equationU=Ut\u03b5n,where U is the superficial velocity (cm h\u22121), \u03b5 is the bed voidage, U\nt is the terminal settling velocity (cm h\u22121), and n is the Richardson\u2013Zaki exponent. The voidage of the expanded bed depends on the degree of expansion, which is the ratio of the expanded and sediment bed height, H/H\n0. The bed voidage of the expanded bed was calculated from equationHH0=(1-\u03b50)(1-\u03b5),where \u03b5 is the expanded bed voidage and \u03b5\n0 is the settled bed voidage. A value of 0.4 was assumed for \u03b5\n0\n[28], [29]. Bed expansion characteristics are dependent on the viscosity and density of process liquid and certain physical properties of adsorbent. As such, the expanded bed was found to expand to a great degree at a particular velocity in the flow in the presence of 8% (w/v) cell lysate due to the increase of feedstock viscosity and density. The n and U\nt values were determined from the linear regression of the Richardson\u2013Zaki equation. The value of the n for the buffer and the presence of biomass was 5.23 and 5.17, respectively (Table 2\n). These values correspond to the theoretical value of 4.8, which is normally used in the laminar flow regime [30]; thus, the bed was assumed to be stable upon expansion in the presence of biomass. The U\nt for the adsorbent fluidized in the feedstock suspension, 865.4 cm h\u22121, is less than the value in the buffer because of the greater viscosity and density of feedstock suspension than the buffer. The linear flow rate intended to be used for bed equilibration and adsorption, 200 cm h\u22121, is far lower than the U\nt. If the linear flow rate is higher than the U\nt, the adsorbent bead will be \u201cblow out\u201d from the column.",

Fig. 4\nshows the breakthrough curve for the NP protein from unclarified feedstock onto Ni2+-loaded Streamline chelating adsorbent in an expanded bed. The NP protein was efficiently captured from the unclarified feedstock. In this study, the dynamic binding capacity of Ni2+-loaded Streamline chelating adsorbent for the NP protein in unclarified feedstock was found to be 2.94 mg ml\u22121 adsorbent at a superficial velocity of 200 cm h\u22121. Therefore, the optimal loading of unclarified E. coli feedstock (0.98 mg ml\u22121 NP protein) that could be applied onto the 100 ml of adsorbent is about 300 ml. However, 300 ml of feedstock is somehow difficult to handle for the present EBA column setup. Instead, 400 ml of feedstock was used, which resulted in the reasonable amount of NP lose during the breakthrough and washing (Table 3\n).",

The unclarified feedstock was applied to the expanded bed at a flow velocity of 200 cm h\u22121, which corresponded to an expanded bed height of 41 cm. The stepwise elution is often selected for large preparative applications because it is technically simpler and reproducible compared to gradient elution [32]. Table 3 shows that the direct purification from unclarified feedstock using IMAC-EBAC has resulted in a 31% adsorption and 9.6% recovery of NP protein. It was a great improvement compared to the 1.3% final yield obtained from the multistep conventional methods involving centrifugation, precipitation, and ultracentrifugation [10].",

The NP protein was subsequently eluted from the column by applying elution buffer containing high imidazole concentration (350 mM). Fig. 7\nshows the SDS\u2013PAGE analysis of protein from elution fractions collected from the second elution, while lane 5 in Fig. 5\nis the pool of these elution fractions. Fig. 6\nshows the elution profile of both elution 1 and elution 2. Peak 1 represents the proteins eluted from elution 1 (50 mM imidazole) and peak 2 represents the proteins eluted from elution 2 (350 mM imidazole). Peak 1 of Fig. 6 and lane 4 of Fig. 5 show that eluate 1 contains higher amount of contaminating proteins and only about 2% of NP proteins were present. Approximately, 38 mg or about 31% of bound NP protein has been eluted from the adsorbent by elution buffer with high imidazole concentration. Substantial amount of protein with molecular weight lower than 60 kDa was found in the eluate 2 (Fig. 5, lane 5 and Fig. 7). These impurities could be either the contaminating protein that was not removed during elution 1 or the degraded NP protein. Indeed, Wizemann and von Brunn [33] have also reported the presence of protein slightly below the size of target protein in the eluate during the purification of hepatitis B virus nucleocapsid protein using Ni2+-chelate affinity chromatography and regarded it as an N-terminal degradation product of the target protein. The present results show that the NP protein has been efficiently purified from unclarified feedstock by using IMA-EBAC without the need of any clarification and concentration steps. In addition, the purity of the NP protein recovered is reasonably high (about 70%) and most importantly the volume of processing fluid was reduced by a factor of 10 (400 ml of feedstock to 40 ml of eluate; Table 3).",

The results of the present study showed that it is possible to recover NP protein directly from unclarified feedstock utilizing IMA-EBAC. A two-step elution protocol was used to elute NP protein from the adsorbent. The protocol employed elution buffer containing 50 mM imidazole that is capable of eliminating high amount of contaminating proteins and elution buffer containing 350 mM imidazole that efficiently elutes large amount of NP protein from the adsorbent. The elution of NP protein was performed in packed bed mode in order to reduce fraction volumes and to concentrate the NP protein. The combination of clarification, capture and purification in a single-step in IMA-EBAC has substantially reduced the downstream processing time, volume of processing fluid, as well as capital and operational costs involved.",
