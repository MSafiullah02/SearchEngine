The elimination half-life is about 2-5.5 hours with a protein binding of 54% in plasma and metabolized by aldehyde oxidase (AO) and xanthine oxidase to its metabolite, T705M1, in liver and excreted to urine. (Du and Chen, 2020) Dose adjustment based on hepatic impairment is not needed however there is not enough humanized study about it (Du and J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f Chen, 2020). The proposed dose for COVID-19 is the loading dose of 3200 mg on day 1 and maintenance dose of 1200 mg on day2-14. (Du and Chen, 2020 ) Main side effects of favipiravir include mild to moderate diarrhea, elevated liver enzymes, testicular toxicity, increased blood uric acid and decrease in neutrophil count (2011). The rate of Q-T prolongation is low (8%) (2011). There is limited clinical data about DDIs and metabolism of favipiravir. In vivo study showed inhibitory effect of favipiravir on CYP2C8 isoenzyme (2011). As well as, other study revealed favipiravir inhibits AO (Du and Chen, 2020) . So, more caution was necessary when used AO inhibitors such as tamoxifen or CYP2C8 substrates like paclitaxel with favipiravir (2011).",

The absorption, distribution and elimination of ivermectin is dependent on Pglycoprotein, on the other hand, it is a potent inhibitor of P-glycoprotein (M\u00e9nez et al., 2012) . The main interactions of this drug are caused by its effects on P-glycoprotein. Ivermectin may change the p-glycoprotein ABCB1 substrate (M\u00e9nez et al., 2012) . The most reported side effects are reported in the context of its use an antiparasitic drug as the result of immunologic response to parasite, including skin rash, fever, headache, nausea and dizziness (Juarez et al., 2018) .

Mild reaction in infusion site is common (Oldfield et al., 2009; Sheppard et al., J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f 2017). One study showed that TCZ has no effect on QT interval. Among the drugs that has concurrently used with TCZ, It seems that coadministration of TCZ has no effect on MTX pharmacokinetic (Schmitt et al., 2012) .Increasing the level of IL-6 is the consequence of blocking IL-6 receptors by TCZ. Elevated IL-6 reduces CYP450 activity, TCZ may reverse this reduced activity of CYPA50. This issue must be kept in mind when we want to administer TCZ with other agents that metabolized by CYP450. TCZ is an immunosuppressive agent; therefore, there is a concern toward its administration in cancer patients who are already immunosuppressed as the result of chemotherapy (26). It should also be noted that due to the long half-life of TCZ monitoring of this interaction may be necessary for 1 to 2 months after the discontinuation of TCZ (Roche Pharma, 2013).",
