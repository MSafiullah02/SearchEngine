            "text": "Let us open with a simple question: how could postmodernism and its famous rejection of grand narratives possibly inform or advance epistemology, the study of truth itself, grand narrative par excellence? In his seminal work Knowledge in a Social World , Alvin I. Goldman goes so far as to accuse postmodernism of being fundamentally veriphobic. Arguing that postmodernists tend to \"deliberately bracket questions of truth and falsity, holding that nothing legitimate can come of any attempt to draw distinctions in those terms\" ( 1999 , p. 7), Goldman suggests that their enterprise is better classifi ed as social doxology , a practice focused not on knowledge but on opinion or belief. Th ough I would argue that Goldman here drastically misunderstands what postmodernism attempts to achieve, in its veriphobic tendencies, one may nonetheless ponder how postmodernism and its emphasis on fl uidity and idiosyncrasies, its fundamental rejection of universalism (a form of universalist statement in and of itself ), may actually contribute to the epistemological edifi ce. In many ways, Goldman's concern with postmodernist theory lies precisely in the latter's challenging of such notions as truth and knowledge when such notions as belief and opinion are already readily available ( 1999 , p. 8) . But here again, Goldman appears to miss the point. Indeed, postmodernism is not necessarily intent on negating truth and knowledge, but raises the question, what do both notions allow or achieve, which justifi ed or accepted belief cannot? Traditional epistemology would tend to suggest that truth bears a usual aura of irreducible transcendentalism or of unquestionable transparency. And this is precisely what postmodernism has striven to expose-that is, the illusionary dimension of said transcendentalism and its intrinsic eff ects of erasure. In the illusion of transparency lies the eff ect of a power whose oppressive capacity heavily relies on its ability to erase all signs of its own actual presence, to silence its own site of production. As such, postmodernism does not partake in the veriphobic move which Goldman assumes it does, but proposes instead a fundamental interrogation of the notion of truth and its role. Its suggested dissolution corresponds not to a shying away from truth but to a return to the original foundation of philosophical inquiry, a return to its logical and revolutionary essence. Driven by its desire to \"examine the possibility of a point of interruption\" (Badiou 2003 , p. 49) , and remembering that desire invariably precludes the possibility of closure, this postmodernist inquiry amounts to nothing less than an epistemological meta-critique, an assessment of epistemology itself, and an appraisal of its foundations, instruments, and eff ects.",

            "text": "One may ponder, at this point, exactly what such critique may have to do with contagion and contagion theory, the object of the present volume. I would argue that it is precisely in the drawing of a parallel between epistemological and epidemiological practices and ideological foundations that we may locate the roots of such a critique. Th e intersection of epidemiology and epistemology is in no way a new phenomenon. Since its origins in late medieval and early modern medical discourse, the idea of contagion as an image system, a metaphorical and rhetorical instrument, has been heavily mobilized by theorists attempting to explain the mechanism underlying the transmission of ideas, beliefs, and emotions. And though its application has tended to be historically rather vague, its enlisting as a metaphorical foundation in the drafting of a new model of epistemic propagation actually allows for the construction of an alternative, comprehensive, and ethically assessable epistemological structure. Embracing the disruptive and transgressive nature of the virus, the fl uid and transformative capacity of contagion, this chapter thus proposes to re-align epistemology and its quest for justifi ed true belief within an ethical fi eld of inquiry in which this quest can be re-framed not as a rooting process but as a decisional moment, one plagued by uncertainty yet itself the founding moment of the possibility of ethics. 1 By re-articulating truth and knowledge as, respectively, illusionary and space of violent oppression, and by re-affi rming the performative dimension of belief, this viral epistemic model opens up a new fi eld of ethical assessment located in the irreducible gap haunting every epistemic re-iteration, a gap which, in turn, not only allows for the subversion of the epistemic machine itself but also signals the infi nite epistemological responsibility of the subject introduced by each epistemic action.",

            "text": "Much work has already been done, within epistemology, on the social value of truth and knowledge, 2 and though most traditional studies appear to take the value of truth as a fundamental evidence, one can fi nd in the works of Philip Kitcher and Ernest Sosa two factors which might potentially counter the postmodernist argument for a dissolution of truth and knowledge altogether. First, the idea that truth and knowledge share a vital role in our daily actions, that \"to mark something out as an item of knowledge is to indicate that it can be depended on, used in practical activities or in further investigations\" (Kitcher 2002 , pp. 404-5) ; second, the notion that truth and knowledge both signal a stability which volition and belief cannot (Sosa 2001 , p. 58) . What both Kitcher and Sosa appear to suggest here is not so much the necessity of truth and knowledge as their essentially apotropaic function. As Zygmunt Bauman ( 1994 , pp. 3-4) suggests, \"human beings exist in [a] never-ending, since never fully successful, eff ort to escape from Chaos,\" and it is precisely this Chaos which we attempt to thwart through the erection of diff erent social structures. In many ways, then, truth and knowledge act as mystical instruments in our quest for freedom, a state itself threatened by the crippling and imprisoning eff ects of doubt and uncertainty.",

Th ough the roots of these obsessive compulsions can certainly, in part, be imputed to the September 11, 2001 attacks, one glance at our recent epidemiological history would comfort even the most skeptical among us in the assumption that our world is, indeed, a dangerous one. From the 2003 Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) outbreak in Asia, the 2004 H5N1 and 2009 H1N1 worldwide infl uenza pandemics, or the more recent resurgence of the Ebola virus in West Africa, each year appears to bring with it a new potential human-and humanity-killer. Within this context, our cultural obsession with security appears all but too comprehensible. As James Der Derian argues, in the face of a danger \"one seeks a security, in the form of a pledge, a bond, a surety\" ( 1993 , p. 98), a pledge dependent on the stability brought about by such notions as truth and knowledge. As the title of a leafl et produced by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in April 2015 suggests-\"What you need to know about Ebola\" (2015, my italics )-knowledge operates, within risk-inducing situations, as an apotropaic instrument, a defense mechanism allegedly protecting individuals against physical and psychological harm.",

            "text": "However, as Alain Badiou argues, this intense desire for stability, this pursuit of a risk-free society runs against the founding force and ambition of philosophy, that is, the \"Mallarm\u00e9an hypothesis that thought begets a throw of the dice\" ( 2003 , p. 41) . Furthermore, its ultimate end result tends not toward freedom, that which it seeks to aff ect, but imprisonment in a never-ending circle of re-assessment whose fi nal eff ect can but be paralyzing. Exposing the apotropaic yet incapacitating eff ect of this drive is thus not to deny the value of truth. Truth is a stable foundation. In its fundamental relation to time, its repeatability, truth provides us with a secure ground upon which to build the vertical and additive structures of knowledge. Imagine indeed for a second what life would be if between each breath, the certainty of my biological compatibility with the air I breathe became something I was inclined to doubt; or if, when confronted with a fast and deadly virus, all members of the medical corps were required to not only re-discover the means at their disposal but test and re-test them until all single traces of doubts were absolutely dissolved, every single instance of a reliance on past, universal, or common knowledge abandoned. Faced with the repeated assaults of a reality whose fl uidity can never entirely be negated, truth and knowledge appear to be the fundamental foundations of all our actions. But to claim that action heavily relies on the assumption of truth, of a certain stability in and over time, does not actually guarantee that such assumptions will be met. At best, it may suggest the illusion of endurance, the fantasized continuation of the event, leaving us nonetheless pondering, as Ludwig Wittgenstein did ( 1969 , p. 12) , whether any certainty \"really be greater for being checked twenty time?\"",

Indeed, though numerous theorists have attempted to provide an adequate definition of truth and its meaning, most epistemologists have so far been forced to recognize that truth cannot be explained without recourse to truth itself, thus enclosing any truth-based argument within an inescapable epistemic circularity. Th e primary objective of any epistemological meta-critique would therefore be to confront this problematic circularity. And I would argue that the answer may not be as complicated as it, at fi rst, appears. In fact, the problem of truth lies in the simple fact that, though epistemology itself is responsible for the creation of the concept it purports to locate or explain, it also has tended to silence its own role in the foundation of this object. In other words, epistemology posits as its ground something it will never entirely be able to prove for the simple reason that it cannot prove the existence of what it itself invented without having recourse to any of the other instruments it used in this object's construction.",

Indeed, though belonging to biology \"because they possess genes, replicate, evolve, and are adapted to particular hosts, biotic habitats, and ecological niches\" viruses remain \"nonliving infectious entities that can be said, at best, to lead a kind of borrowed life\" (van Regenmortel and Mahy 2004 , p. 8).

As the virus problematizes the possibility of distinction between host and non-host, between life and non-life, contagion more largely exposes the inadequacy of our cultural desire for boundaries. Residing between , in the fl uid indistinction characteristic of the point of contact where terms blur into each other, contagion uncovers the operations of culture and reveals the illusionary dimension of any and all distinctions. It loudly exposes the fact that, outside man and the boundaries man has erected for himself in order to make sense of the world, the division between organisms, between life and death, but also between concepts such as truth, knowledge, and belief is one whose ontological foundations is inherently void. As Sedgwick argues, we are, after all, \"working, at best, with hypothetical constructs of our own devising\" ( 1973 , p. 25) . Th eir respective relevance and usefulness are thus only as valid as we make them be, a validity which, in the case of the virus tends quickly to amount to little if anything at all.",

And though most epistemologists may be justifi ed in their reluctance to engage with its standard form, I would argue we may fi nd in the writing of Sextus Empiricus a potential path toward an ethical epistemology. In his Outlines of Scepticism , Sextus voluntarily distances his own brand of skepticism from the standardized solipsistic argument supporting the impossibility of any access to truth or knowledge ( 2000 , p. 3). Instead, skepticism, for Sextus, operates according to three axes: investigation, suspension, and aporia ( 2000 , p. 4). Skepticism, he argues, lies in the suspension of judgment which is forced upon the subject when confronted with the possibility of the \"both\" which traditional epistemology, in its emphasis on a unicity and division, cannot abide. In other words, what Sextus emphasizes here is precisely what a meta-critique proposes to address-that is, the structures underlying the epistemological edifi ce, or, as he expresses itself, the idea that \"what we investigate is not what is apparent but what is said about what is apparent\" ( 2000 , p. 8), not truth nor beliefs but the discourse and presuppositions surrounding these conceptions.",

And this argument is one which is diffi cult to refute. Indeed, the skeptics, in Sextus's defi nition, appear to essentially reject the risk inherent to philosophical inquiry. And though this argument may hold, I would argue that it also misunderstands the potential of such a theory, its capacity to reveal and expose the decision underlying every belief and, therefore, its call for a necessary re-framing of belief as a political and ethical action. In other words, the skeptic addresses the silenced foundational moment at the heart of epistemology that is the voluntary and arbitrary iteration of belief. Skepticism does not signal the removal of the foundations of judgment, as Wittgenstein suggests ( 1969 , p. 81) , but the possibility of its actualization, a rejection of the transcendental, a re-articulation of belief as decisional, and ultimately the inscription of epistemology into the realm of ethics.",

As Zagzebski and Fairweather argue, \"virtue epistemologists prefer to leave skeptical worries aside in order to pursue a program that is not dominated by these worries\" ( 2001 , p. 5). And one might easily understand why they chose to do so as skepticism tends toward inaction rather than action, the primordial object of any ethical inquiry. Virtue epistemology purports to assess the relation between knower and knowledge or, more precisely, between a knower and her alethic ends (Fairweather 2001 , p. 64) . Th rough this assessment, it proposes to re-articulate the quest for knowledge as a virtue, an epistemic obligation in itself. Virtue epistemology therefore introduces the notion of responsibility into the act of belief itself. In 1877 already, W.K. Cliff ord argued that \"it is not possible so to sever the belief from the action it suggests as to condemn the one without condemning the other\" ( 1877 , p. 291).",

Whereas traditional epistemology has tended to conceive of knowledge and belief as a state of being, an end result rather than a process, one which precludes any potential form of responsibility as it inherently negates the agency posited by skepticism, virtue epistemology re-conceptualizes belief as the performative action of an epistemic subject. Yet, the notion of action also suggests agency as well as an agent, a knower whose act of belief can be perceived as controlled and willfully produced, an idea which most epistemologists appear to take issue with. 3 Here again, turning to contagion theory may help locate traces of an answer. Indeed, gazing at their common structures, one is forced to recognize that the individual's epistemological system inherent to most epistemic theories operates according to an economy which, in many ways, replicates that of the immune system found in biological writings. Both heavily rely on a critical apparatus whose function is to recognize and appraise every new incursion based on its compatibility with the rest of the system and then authorize or deny it access if such an incursion threatens the viability of the whole structure. Similarly, we fi nd within communities a similar apparatus functioning at the herd level, or a form of \"herd immunity\" (Wald 2008 , p. 48) in which new biological and epistemological entries are granted or refused access based on the pre-existing pattern of immunity of the collective population. Th ink, for example, of the prevalence of irrational racist agendas within most cultures despite the current climate of globalization and miscegenation dominating most industrialized countries. How can one explain these collective beliefs and their reluctance to variation without recourse to a form of epistemological immune system, a structure whose function it is to assess every \"new\" belief in relation to the existing epistemic structures of the subject and/ or her community?",

Contagion, as Marsha Rosengarten argue, traditionally presupposes \"at least two distinct bodies, in some way self-identical in themselves and diff erent from each other\" between which \"some movement of substance or infl uence [\u2026] must occur\" ( 2001 , p. 169). Contagion invites the drawing of lines of contact between territories and signals the often-illusory nature of the boundaries we culturally impose upon the world. And though the current reigning image system governing contagion theory often conceives of it in military terms (Montgomery 1991 , p. 347) , emphasizing division and confl ict, this perspective may in and of itself be perceived as an apotropaic or defensive mechanism erected against what contagion threatens most-that is, the idea of boundary itself. Indeed, more than anything else, contagion exposes and reveals our inherent vulnerability. As Bashford and Hooker suggest, it \"reaches over domains of nature and culture which we often want to understand, or have an investment in understanding, as separate\" ( 2001 , p. 4) . In its essence, it problematizes the possibility of ontology itself, the boundaries we set up in order to defi ne, the categorical imperative essential to structuration, signaling instead dissolution, fl uid and continuous transmission, a move toward what has been labeled the posthuman and its biotic community of interconnected \"subjects.\" 4 How might this a re-conceptualization, that is, one rooted in notions of fl uidity, movement, permeability, and instability impact epistemology? Its fi rst eff ect is the implicit dissolution of the possibility of an externalist/internalist argument. As the boundaries of the subject dissolve, the strict separation posited by both theories between individual/internal and collective/external belief or knowledge fi nds itself re-framed as an interactive and co-dependent territory in which, as Cliff ord suggests, \"no one man's belief is in any case a private matter which concerns himself alone\" ( 1877 , p. 292). Th ere is, of course, nothing new in suggesting the collective nature of our belief structure, the reliance of our thinking process on the existence of a collective language. However, few epistemological studies have actively engaged with what I would argue to be the inherently collective and interactive dimension of belief. In his work On Certainty , Wittgenstein suggests such a re-conceptualization when he argues that \"to know\" is to always already claim a recognition by a collective of our position as \"knower\" ( 1969 , p. 73), something echoed in Gerhart and Russell's defi nition of knowledge as \"created understanding\" ( 2002 , p. 202) or in Davidson's articulation of objective truth as a product of communication ( 2004 , p. 7) . What all three studies imply is the rooting of truth and knowledge's transcendental dimension in a form of collective consciousness or, at least, acquiescence, the positing of a fundamental and essential distinction between individual and collective forms of belief, a distinction between, respectively, belief on the one hand and knowledge and truth on the other.",

As Wittgenstein argues, to know \"seems to describe a state of aff airs which guarantees what is known, guarantees it as a fact\" ( 1969 , p. 3), ultimately canceling all distinction between what is known and this knowledge, the object and the state referring to it. Any claim to \"knowledge\" thus signals the impossibility of error, error being the privileged territory of belief. In other words, knowledge cannot abide error without being immediately transformed into something else. Postmodernist readers will instantly perceive how problematic this notion may be. Indeed, postmodernism's primary claim has tended to be a positioning of truth and knowledge as violently normative notions, a normative dimension surprisingly often openly recognized by epistemology itself. From its traditional reliance on an \"ideal\" epistemic agent-or as Bonjour puts it, one \"with faculties that are identical to those of a normal human being\" ( 2002 , p. 255, my italics )-to its object itself-that is, a quest for an ideal and unique endepistemology is suff used with normative principles whose primary eff ects are the silencing of any alternative claims to its own precious creations. For most epistemologists, this reliance on unicity, standards, and hierarchical assessment may appear innocuous, or even necessary, 5 and one may be tempted to see in such a claim a fundamental feature of any quest predicated on truth and knowledge. However, the ethical postmodernist reader might see in this precisely what Wittgenstein already recognized when he suggested that this process amounts to little more than using one language-game in order to combat another ( 1969 , p. 80) .",

Violence and oppression do not derive, for Goldman, from truth or knowledge but from false claims to said truth and knowledge. However, Goldman here once again misunderstands the nature of the violence and oppression which postmodernism has tended to perceive in any claim to truth and knowledge. A return to contagion theory and its metaphors helps us expose more clearly the violence contingent in these processes. Indeed, in many ways, the claim implied in epistemology's quest for truth mirrors the underlining ideology guiding our contemporary public health programs and measures. As Marcel Verweij and Angus Dawson suggest, \"calling something a public health issue seems to imply that it concerns us all\" ( 2007 , pp. 18-19) . Public health's claim to universality, to the collective welfare or to a mythical \"public good\" indeed often bypasses, or clearly nullifi es, any claim to private and individual safety. Its reliance on a continuous threat to the community allows the establishment of security measures which more often than not act as a naturalization of its own powers of oppression, silencing in the process the numerous decisions which have shaped its ideological basis and which underline its self-sustained structure of re-duplication. Like epistemology, it tends to cancel its own defi nitional role in the establishment of the structures which it then calls forth as the unfortunate but natural and necessary bases of its own normalizing eff ects.",

Due to their self-proclaimed unicity, knowledge and truth cannot but be product of the violent erasure of all alternative voices, a reduction of all forms of otherness to sameness-that is, the anti-ethical movement par excellence. 6 If positing any claim to both truth and knowledge necessarily forces us to assume a problematic position of authority, can we imagine an alternative epistemological model which would retain its capacity for assessment yet forbid these reductive practices? I would argue this model to be fundamentally impossible, since assessment, hierarchy, and singularity by essence appear to imply the forceful imposition of a domain of abjection. However, in this last section, I propose to explore the possibility opened up by skepticism and contagion theory for the constitution of a potential epistemological meta-critique-that is, a positioning of the epistemological enterprise as a cultural, ethical, and political process in and of itself. Like Sextus himself, I need here to premise this proposition with a concession, a recognition that my position itself cannot constitute another truth claim without running precisely against what it purports to undertake. As such, it should not be taken as a model claiming transparency, nor does it assert its own superiority to any other epistemological structure. Instead, it proposes to recognize its own ethical positioning, its own responsibility as a model of thought, as a belief system itself product of a series of decisions and further beliefs.",

Moving toward a form of posthumanist epistemology, this model appears to disrupt the vertical hierarchy upon which traditional epistemology relies and to replace it instead with a rhizomatic structure within which, as Cliff ord argues, \"no real belief, however trifl ing and fragmentary it may seem, is ever truly insignifi cant\" ( 1877 , p. 292). Within this structure, the multiplicity of beliefs which constitute the system, and upon which the system ultimately relies for its defi nition, continuously make and re-make each other according to a mutational dynamic predicated on randomness and disorder.

To posit a system whose operation includes the absorption and recognition of external elements always already bears the question: where does such a re-cognition take its roots in? In order to be re-cognized, one has indeed to have been previously encountered outside said recognition. As Donna J. Haraway suggests, there can be \"no exterior antigenic structure, no 'invader' that the immune system had not already 'seen' and mirrored internally\" ( 2004 , p. 104 ). Yet, how could one encounter a belief one does not recognize and still trigger the epistemic operations necessary for the transposition of the encountered data into a recognizable belief?",

To posit every decisional act as the re-iteration of an original violence is not to label it unjust. Rather, it is to claim that this decision always already \"exceed[s] the opposition between founded and unfounded, or between any foundationalism or anti-foundationalism\" (1990, p. 945) .

It compels us to re-think not only our own responsibility but our collective means of assessment of this responsibility. Indeed, if each iteration of belief bears within it the (crushing) weight of its own ethical responsibility, it also implies a similar burden weighing upon the collective body whose function and role it is to assess the compatibility of the individual's belief and belief system. If the individual agent's responsibility lies in the re-assessment, in each and every iteration of belief, of her own ethical responsibility in this iteration, a similar process must be involved in the collective assessment of her belief 's position within the collective's own belief structure. Th is re-conceptualization thus posits a collective network of beliefs within which the individual agent's belief system not only emerges-inasmuch as we assume thought itself to emerge within and through a collective process delimiting the conditions of its possibility-but can also be ethically assessed. However, to presuppose this structure to be itself fi xed in nature would once again be to return to the universalism which has tended to normalize (in all its implied violence) the study of epistemic responsibility. Instead, the rhizomatic networked structure posited by a performative and coherence theory of belief intrinsically implies the potential of each belief to produce structural mutations of the collective system. Like the virus whose introduction can cause fundamental mutations in the host (Carter and Saunders 2007 , p. 6) , every belief contains within itself the possibility of a collective epistemic shift.",

What this repetition entails is a necessary opening up of a space of suspension. By grounding its own structure in what Derrida calls, borrowing from Montaigne, the \"mystical foundation\" of authority ( 1990 , p. 943), a performative theory of belief intrinsically posits at its core a moment of pure undecidability, a space of equalitarian co-existence, which it appears to close yet nonetheless retains the haunting memory of. Since every decision contains within itself the traces of its own alternative, every epistemic action is stained by the remaining memory of the inexistent, an opening up to an epistemic pluralism it never entirely manages to discard. Like a virus whose mutational force may remain dormant for years, waiting for a potential re-activation (Carter and Saunders 2007 , p. 3), every belief emerges as the mutual and impossible co-presence of a positive and a negative. As such, the performative process involved in every epistemic action seems to echo the complex biological process involved in viral contagion-that is, a process ripe with potentialities in which every form of bodily communication opens up a potential space of mutation. As new organisms enter the body of the biological subject in a state of pure potentiality-every new organism contains within itself the potential to be either rejected as threat, assimilated as benign or, more perniciously and like the retrovirus, wrongfully incorporated only to later reveal its actual nefarious eff ects-every belief iteration contains within itself the dual and simultaneous possibility of its own acceptance and rejection. And it is precisely this infi nite and irreducible co-presence which requires it to continuously re-iterate itself in order to contain an epistemic plurality whose abiding presence threatens the possibility of judgment.",

It signals an open path toward what Badiou calls a \"philosophy of singularity\" ( 2003 , p. 53), though one which, unlike Badiou's, invariably recognizes the singular as that which cannot be thought, as that which forever remains outside the prospects of epistemology, as the unthinkable, that which one can desire, since desire always precludes possession, yet never fully grasp.",

And though it may appear so, this re-claimed form of political ethics does not actually necessarily negate the possibility of collective action. Instead, it forbids the collective from dissimulating, or silencing, its own responsibility, its own arbitrariness, under the guise of common belief. As Badiou argues, within this idiosyncratic approach, \"we must make our own decision and speak in our name,\" we cannot \"hide behind any great collective confi guration, any supposed force, any metaphysical totality which might take a position in one's stead\" ( 2003 , p. 54) . What this re-conceptualized form of epistemology suggests is the necessary re-thinking of the collective and its own belief system as a plurality, a multiplicity of idiosyncratic structures which never elevates itself to any transcendental status but always remains a congregation of ethical and epistemological responsibilities whose relations can never move beyond the rhizomatic structures which conditions them.",
