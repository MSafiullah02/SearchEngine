The sequence of SARS-CoV-2 is approximately 30 kb long, and could encodes spike, envelope, membrane, nucleocapsid proteins, etc. (Phan 2020). These proteins are responsible for replicating the viral genome as well as generating nested transcripts that are used in the synthesis of the viral proteins.",

            "text": "RNA interference (RNAi) is a native and specific post-transcriptional gene silencing mechanism (Bobbin and Rossi 2016). The progress initiated by double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) to manipulate gene expression (RNAi) has been proved highly effective, at least 10 times more effective than either using sense or antisense RNAs alone (Chalk and Sonnhammer 2002). The RNAi triggered by dsRNA is a phenomenon of homology-dependent gene silencing and may play certain roles in affecting the process of virus expression and proliferation. Recently, several reports have demonstrated the use of RNAi in blocking virus infection and replication in animal cells (Ge et al.2003), suggesting that the small interfering RNA (siRNA, 21\u201325 nt long) plays an important role in RNAi-related gene silencing pathways (Elbashir et al.2001). Progress has been made in anti-HIV and anti-HCV drug design by applying the method of RNA interference (Wilson et al.2003). The effectiveness of siRNA for inhibiting SARS coronavirus genes expression was also demonstrated by Shi et al. (2005). Besides silencing the targeted genes, the siRNAs can also inhibit the replication of the virus. For example, it has been demonstrated that, by targeting the Leader sequence of SARS-CoV, the siRNA demonstrate a strong inhibitory effect on SARS-CoV replication (Li et al.2005). More recently, a CRISPR/Cas13d system was proposed for the treatment of SARS-COV-2 (Nguyen et al.2020). These results indicate that both RNAi and CRISPR/Cas technology might become potential therapeutic approaches for treating viral diseases.",
