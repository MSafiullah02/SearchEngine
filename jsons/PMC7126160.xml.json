Many dogs suffer from a mild cough and recover after a short time; however, in some cases a severe bronchopneumonia can develop (Appel and Binn, 1987). In addition to causing distress to the dogs, CIRD also delays rehoming at rescue centers and causes disruption of schedules in training kennels as well as incurring considerable treatment costs.",

However, CRCV RNA was most frequently found in the trachea of dogs with mild cough (55%). Studies using the human coronavirus strain 229E have shown that coronaviruses can cause disruption of the respiratory epithelium and ciliary dyskinesia (Chilvers et al., 2001). If one supposes that an infection with CRCV may have a similar effect then the virus could play an important role in the early stages of the pathogenesis of CIRD. By damage of the respiratory epithelium and disruption of the ciliary clearance CRCV could facilitate the entry of other viral or bacterial pathogens causing the more severe respiratory symptoms. The less frequent detection of CRCV in tissue samples from dogs with more severe disease may be explained by the destruction of the respiratory epithelium by other microorganisms in the advanced stages of CIRD. At the same time it is likely that the immune response that is induced by CRCV in almost all dogs would help to clear the infection, causing the prevalence of CRCV RNA to be lower in later stages of the disease.",
