At a late stage, an appropriate cellular immune response and a large number of effector molecules are induced at the same time as the appearance of antibodies. The elimination of HBV starts several weeks before the onset of disease through a T cell dependent non-cytolytic mechanism. It is only later that the cytolytic immune response appears and generates the symptoms of hepatitis. During this phase, numerous cytolytic CD8 cells are present in the liver and will react with multiple epitopes, eliminating the virus by destroying infected cells. The activated function of CD8+ T cells is suppressed by a rise in arginase levels which aims to limit the amount of the liver that will be damaged by them in patients with acute HBV infection [6]. Furthermore, soluble Fas may play a role in the onset of fulminant hepatitis. Soluble Fas antigens are present at high levels in patients presenting with this condition, which suggests their involvement in liver damage and that apoptosis is the principal mechanism underlying this damage [7].",

It persists in the liver even if the HBV infection is controlled (e.g. HBs-Ag negative). HBV DNA may also persist in the liver as integrated HBV DNA. A rapid increase in HBV replication from a low level is the principal cause (as reflected by HBV DNA, anti-HBcIgM, HBeAg) of HBV reactivation. During this phase, transaminase levels rise, jaundice appears and the HBV viral load starts to fall. The first episode of an exacerbation of chronic HBV may occur during different phases of this infection: the immune-tolerant phase, immune-active phase, low-replication phase or resolved phase. An increase in the response of T cells against HBeAg and HbcAg occurs during the early stages of an acute exacerbation (acute flare-up) and declines after recovery from the acute exacerbation and HBeAg seroconversion [14]. Spontaneous flare-ups mainly occur in HBeAg-negative patients.",

When immunosuppression is withdrawn, immune restoration is followed by the rapid destruction of infected hepatocytes that may also be responsible for ALF (or chronic hepatitis or cirrhosis).

By contrast, in patients with HBV reactivation, HBV DNA at the time of LT is frequently high and controlling HBV recurrence may be difficult despite adequate immunoprophylaxis against HBV. If possible, the HBV DNA level should be below 105 copies/mL, although it might not be possible to achieve this goal because of the severity of liver failure and the emergency situation.",

The spontaneous prognosis for HBV-related FH is poor. The global management of these patients presenting with FH does not differ from that of patients with FH linked to another cause.
