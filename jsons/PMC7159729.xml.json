CRS patients fulfilled agreed diagnostic criteria for CRS21 and had failed a prolonged trial of medical therapy.1 All had sufficiently extensive disease to merit dissection of all their paranasal sinuses and there were no exclusion criteria. Normal sinonasal mucosa was sampled from 1 patient with a nonfunctioning pituitary adenoma and 1 patient with a malignant lesion of the pterygopalatine fossa. Neither of these patients had symptoms of CRS or evidence of CRS on endoscopy or imaging. Patients were recruited during the southern hemisphere summer and early autumn months (February\u2010April, 2010). Recruitment was ceased at an agreed time when in previous years the rate of detection of respiratory viruses in the general population had been seen to rise. The regional ethics committee (Northern Regional Ethics Committee Ref: NTX/08/12/126) and the hospitals involved gave prior approval of the study and informed written consent was given by all patients.",
