Most sedations were delivered by regular pediatricians rather than residents, the only exception being sedations for those procedures that are usually learned during residency (e.g. lumbar puncture and non-invasive techniques). A nurse was usually present to assist in around 95% of centers, exceptions here being esophagogastroduodenoscopy, colonoscopy, transesophageal echocardiography, non-sonographic imaging, and non-invasive sonography. Up to 44.2% of centers accepted \u201cdual roles\u201d with the same pediatrician delivering the sedation and performing the diagnostic or interventional procedure (again, this was strictly a yes-or-no question so that any omitted replies were considered negative replies). Dual-role acceptance by centers was seen for all 18 procedures. Regarding the question of centers linking case-specific risk factors to a requirement that higher-level (more experienced) physicians should then be in charge of the sedations, it emerged that around half of the centers did have such risk-adapted rules in place for each of the three specified risk factors.",

Regular training is demonstrably helpful in implementing standardized processes [6]. It is therefore all the more surprising that only around one-third of the responding centers organized such courses recurrently. A need for regular trainings and organizational improvements can also be postulated from other findings: 15.9% of pediatric centers did not ask their patients if they were allergic or intolerant to substances used for PSA, around 20% did not consider airway infections during the pre-sedative period, one-fifth did not use a standardized documentation protocol, and one-fourth did not perform follow-up examinations.",

Several papers have been devoted to the need for comprehensive documentation [8, 10\u201312]. Our survey reveals deficits even regarding the essential items of equipment in pediatric sedation environments, and what options are available are not utilized in a consistent fashion. It has repeatedly been highlighted that both adequately equipped sedation settings and appropriate monitoring are mandatory [5, 7, 8, 10, 11, 13]. There is a need to further raise awareness of this problem and to eliminate deficits as required.",

Propofol is a good example to illustrate controversial discussions of the past few years about sedation delivery by non-anesthesiologists [15\u201317]. A consensus paper issued by 21 European national societies of anaesthesia is, in fact, entitled \u201cNon-anaesthesiologists should not be allowed to administer propofol for procedural sedation\u201d [18]. The other side of the story is illustrated by two exemplary reports covering approximately 50000 [19] or 25000 [20] patients in North America, both concluding that severe complications from propofol are quite rare. This was substantially confirmed by Chiaretti et al. in the largest European study in more than 36,500 patients with propofol administration for PSA in children [21].",

Our results show that many centers are aware of inadequate training being a problem and have implemented risk-adapted rules for sedation. Yet the responses also show that there is considerable room for improvement. What remains generally unanswered is the question just how much training should be required from an anesthesiologist or pediatrician to be considered \u201cexperienced enough\u201d for safe delivery of a sedation, regardless of its depth [14]. While we have repeatedly reported on the good experience with our own in-house standard [5, 6, 22, 23], any wholesale extrapolation of this experience and its analysis would be misguided, given that other pediatric centers may have training programs that differ from ours in content and emphasis. Further corroboration of the above points comes from impressive evidence by Hoffmann et al. [24] for an association between rigorous adherence to predefined standards and complication rates.",

The DGAI and BDA require that, in severely diseased (ASA status III-IV) children and during all deep sedations, a second physician not identical to the examiner must be available who is trained in anesthesiology or intensive care medicine and whose sole task is to continuously monitor the vital parameters [11]. The AAP recommends the presence of both an examiner and a helper even in scenarios of moderate sedation, with the helper, once the sedative agents have been administered, monitoring the vital parameters and assisting with tasks of short duration; in scenarios of deep sedation, this specially trained person should not have any tasks other than activities related to the additional delivery of sedative agents or monitoring the sedation [7, 10].",

In some cases, organizational deficits were indeed found in the two-digit percentage range. In addition, numerous centers affirmed that they accepted \u201cdual roles\u201d (meaning that the physician doing the procedure is also in charge of delivering the PSA) for a considerable number of the 18 diagnostic or interventional procedures listed in the questionnaire. Thus we could identify a considerable need to eliminate deficits in both of these areas (no assistant and dual-role acceptance) if the recommendations issued by the aforementioned professional associations are to be met. We believe that any deep sedation must involve two physicians (one being exclusively in charge of the sedation and the other one conducting the diagnostic or interventional procedure) and that any moderate level of sedation should not be delivered without an assistant. Exceptions are only possible under certain conditions, e. g. if a second non-physician has received adequate training in performing and monitoring PSA and the safety of the patients is not adversely affected.",

Perhaps also due to this long questionnaire, the return rate of around 50% surely could have been higher. Another limitation is that, despite our reassurance that the replies would be processed in a pseudonymized format, a certain risk of dishonesty on the part of some respondents cannot be dismissed out of hand but, at the least, seems unlikely when considering that the survey disclosed some rather serious deficits.",

Nevertheless, our results can point into the right direction to use the positive and negative results as a basis of a specific evaluation and correction, as necessary. Another way of viewing our results is that they highlight, based on evidence, the challenges of pediatric sedation analgesia, all boiling down to this quote by Gozal and Mason [15]: \u201cThe challenge facing sedation care providers moving forward in the 21st century will be to determine how to apply the local, regional and national guidelines to the individual sedation practices. A greater challenge, perhaps impossible, will be to determine whether the sedation community can come together worldwide to develop standards, guidelines and recommendations for safe sedation practice.\u201d",
