This incidence increases to 40% of children by age 3 and almost half of all children by age 6 years.1 Two major pathogens, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and human rhinovirus (HRV), cause most of these illnesses. RSV is the major pathogen associated with wheezing illnesses in children younger than 2 years.2, 3, 4 Of other viruses causing wheezing illnesses in infancy, HRV is next most common, and a variety of viruses (coronaviruses, metapneumoviruses, parainfluenza viruses, influenza viruses, bocavirus) also cause significant numbers of illnesses.",

The etiology of virus-induced wheezing illnesses varies with the season: RSV, metapneumoviruses, and influenza viruses (with the notable exception of 2009 H1N1) are usually limited to the winter and early spring. HRV infections are most common in the spring and fall, but can occur throughout the year. Of note, asthma exacerbations are also quite seasonal, and seasonal peaks in children occur regularly in the fall and spring. In Canada, the peaks in pediatric asthma exacerbations occur approximately 17 days after Labor Day every year, and it is assumed that viral infections that are spread within schools are a major contributor to the fall peaks, and perhaps also in the spring after the children return from spring break.6, 7 It is important to bear in mind that other environmental exposures, including allergens and pollutants, also vary by season, and it seems likely that a combination of environmental factors contributes to the seasonal peaks in exacerbation rates.",

In a case-control study of 84 asthmatics admitted for acute exacerbations versus stable asthmatics and patients hospitalized for nonrespiratory diagnoses, a significantly higher proportion of children hospitalized for an acute exacerbation were virus-infected (44%) as compared with the stable asthmatics (18%) and nonrespiratory hospital admissions (17%; both P<.001).15, 16 The combination of allergic sensitization and allergen exposure was also found more frequently in asthma hospitalization group (76%) than in the 2 control groups (48% and 28%, respectively, P<.001). In the multivariate analysis, the viral illness and allergic sensitization/exposure were no longer significant, but the combination of these risk factors dramatically increased the risk of hospital admission (odds ratio 19.4, P<.001), demonstrating the link between these factors in causing asthma exacerbations. Similar findings were reported in an earlier case-control study involving adults; the combination of sensitization, high exposure to one or more indoor allergens, and viral detection considerably increased the risk of being admitted to the hospital with asthma (odds ratio 8.4, 95% confidence interval 2.1\u201332.8; P = .002).17 Finally, in the Inner City Asthma Study (ICAS), children who were sensitized and highly exposed to cockroach allergen were more likely to be admitted to hospital, have more unscheduled medical visits, and more time off school than either nonexposed or nonsensitized children.18 Virology was not performed in ICAS, but it can be presumed that viral infections were important contributors to asthma morbidity in this population.",

In fact, most surveillance studies have focused on detection of HRV during periods of illness, but there are limited data available regarding true rates of infection in children with asthma. It is presumed that children frequently develop asymptomatic or mild infections that do not cause asthma exacerbations. If this is true, other factors must contribute to the risk of more severe illnesses and those with wheezing. To determine the contribution of viral infections and allergic sensitization to loss of asthma control, nasal secretions were obtained weekly in a group of 58 children with asthma during peak HRV seasons (September and April).2 As expected, virus-positive weeks were associated with greater severity of both cold and asthma symptoms. Clinically defined illnesses were then classified according to temporal association with detection of a respiratory virus. For virus-positive illnesses, the duration of cold and asthma symptoms was twice as long, and loss of asthma control occurred more frequently. Approximately two-thirds of the children were sensitized to common aeroallergens. When comparing sensitized with nonsensitized subjects, rates of infection were similar between the 2 groups; however, the sensitized group had 47% more virus-associated illnesses per season. Finally, nonsensitized subjects most commonly reported \u201cnone\u201d or \u201cmild\u201d cold and asthma symptoms with their viral infections, whereas almost half of the viral infections in sensitized children resulted in moderate or severe cold or asthma symptoms (Fig. 1\n).

Accordingly, subjects with allergic rhinitis who were inoculated with HRV had increased levels of histamine in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) samples immediately and 48 hours after antigen challenge during HRV infection.22 These same changes were not observed in nonallergic subjects infected with HRV and challenged to antigen, suggesting that the combination of viral infection and allergic disease leads to greater airway inflammation. In addition, experimentally induced HRV infection caused an enhanced eosinophilic response to allergen challenge in the allergic but not nonallergic subjects. This effect persisted for as long as 1 month after the acute HRV infection.",

These studies have generally reported that the upper airway manifestations of HRV infections are similar in subjects with or without allergies or asthma, but that lower airway symptoms are increased in asthma. Two studies involving subjects with mild asthma have found similar cellular inflammation and proinflammatory cytokines in airway cells when compared with normal control subjects.25, 26 In contrast, Message and colleagues27 found several asthma-related differences in the response to experimental HRV infection. In asthmatic subjects, HRV infection enhanced eosinophilic inflammation. In addition, virologic and clinical outcomes were related to deficient interferon (IFN)-\u03b3 and interleukin (IL)-10 responses and to augmented IL-4, IL-5, and IL-13 responses from blood and airway mononuclear cells. In a study of similar design, DeMore and colleagues25 found that numbers of airway eosinophils preinoculation were significantly related to cold scores induced by HRV infection. Collectively, these findings suggest that eosinophilic inflammation and T-helper 2 (Th2)-biased immune responses associated with allergic sensitization enhance the clinical severity of illness associated with HRV infection.",

This effect could be compounded in asthma because of the association between asthma and defective epithelial repair processes.56 Finally, asthma is associated with remodeling of the airways, which includes increase in the numbers of mucus-secreting goblet cells.

Furthermore, montelukast-induced reductions in EDN levels were associated with a significant decrease in wheezing episodes in follow-up.60 Finally, omalizumab reduces the risk of exacerbations in patients with allergic asthma,61 and provides an ideal tool to determine whether inhibiting allergic inflammation will reduce the risk for virus-induced exacerbations.
