Coronaviruses were first described in 1965 (1) by Tyrell and Bynoe, who cultured the viruses from patients with what was thought common colds symptoms (2, 3) . The term \"Coronavirus,\" which described the characteristic microscopic morphology of these viruses, was officially coined in 1968 (3) . SARS CoV-2 belongs to the B-lineage of beta-coronaviruses and is closely related to the SARS-CoV virus. Currently, the suspicion of infection with 2019-nCoV requires two elements as indicators of the case: presence of fever and symptoms of respiratory disease. SARS-CoV-2 apparently managed to make its transition from animals to humans at the seafood market in Wuhan, China (4,5). Wuhan, is the same place where one of the largest biosafety level 4 (BSL-4) Asia\u00b4s laboratories is located, where European, Canadian and American experts collaborate. The initial clinical sign of COVID-19-related disease that allowed detection was pneumonia.",
