Recently, this virus emerged in England as a novel pathogen in the respiratory tract of dogs suffering from severe respiratory disease (Erles et al., 2003). However, CRCoV infection is thought to cause only subclinical or asymptomatic conditions (Erles et al., 2003). CRCoV replication in the respiratory epithelium may damage the mucociliar system, and thereby lead to a more severe clinical course of infection than other respiratory pathogens (Buonavoglia and Martella, 2007).",

This dissimilar region in BCoV has three different open reading frames (ORFs) and encodes three nonstructural proteins (4.9 kDa, 4.8 kDa, and 12.7 kDa in size), whereas the corresponding region in the CRCoV 4182 prototype strain encodes only two (8.8 kDa and 12.8 kDa) (Erles et al., 2007). Interestingly, British CRCoV strains T4182, T0715, T1030, and T1207 were found to encode two corresponding nonstructural proteins, but strain G9142 was shown to encode three putative nonstructural proteins (4.9 kDa, 2.7 kDa, and 12.7 kDa) (Erles et al., 2007). Sequence analysis of the viral RNA 3\u2032-end of an Italian CRCoV, strain 240-05, also identified the genomic region between the spike and the envelope protein genes, as it did for strain G9142 (Lorusso et al., 2009).",

The canine adenovirus type 1 (CAV-1), canine distemper virus (CDV), and canine influenza virus (CIV) were also amplified using previously published methods (Hu et al., 2001, Frisk et al., 1999, Hoffmann et al., 2001). CRCoV was amplified using the primers described in Table 1\n. Samples from dogs determined by RT-PCR to be CRCoV-positive were then examined, using PCR analysis of appropriate enteric, fecal, lung or tracheal samples, for the presence of other pathogens, namely canine parvovirus (Ikeda et al., 2000, Kang et al., 2008), canine coronavirus (Pratelli, 2006), and Bordetella bronchiseptica (Hozbor et al., 1999). CRCoV cDNA was amplified using a one-step RT-PCR Kit (QIAGEN, Cat. No. 210212). The one-step RT-PCR program consisted of 30 min at 42 \u00b0C, 15 min at 94 \u00b0C, 15 min at 94 \u00b0C, followed by 35 cycles of 30 s at 95 \u00b0C, 30 s at 48\u201352 \u00b0C, and 60 s at 72 \u00b0C, and with a final elongation step of 5 min at 72 \u00b0C. Amplification of specific genes from other viral strains was carried out according to previously published protocols (Erles et al., 2004, Hu et al., 2001, Frisk et al., 1999, Hoffmann et al., 2001, Ikeda et al., 2000, Pratelli, 2006, Kang et al., 2008, Hozbor et al., 1999). PCR products of the expected sizes were purified by electrophoresis on a 1% agarose gel, followed by extraction using a QIAquick Gel Extraction Kit (QIAGEN, Cat. No. 28706, USA). The extracted DNA fragments were subsequently subcloned using the pGEM-T Vector System II (Promega, Cat. No. A3610, USA).",

First, CRCoV infection alone was not found in the lung and tracheal tissues of sampled dogs; and second, complex CRCoV infection occurred together with CAV-1 or -2, CDV, or CPV2a infection, whereas infection with CHV, CPiV, CIV, canine coronavirus (CCV), or Bordetella bronchiseptica was absent in all six CRCoV-positive dogs. Furthermore, among the three CRCoV-positive dogs reported here, two (the K9 and K37 isolate) displayed mild respiratory clinical symptoms, and one (the K39 isolate) presented with a combination of vomiting and diarrhea. However, two dogs (the K9 and K39 isolates) were infected with CPV type 2a according to CPV diagnosis, and not with CPV type 2a variant.",

Three proteins (4.9 kDa, 4.8 kDa, and 12.8 kDa) were found to be encoded by the region between the spike and envelope genes, while the corresponding gene region in CRCoV-4182 encodes only two proteins (8.8 kDa and 12.8 kDa) (Erles et al., 2007). It was recently reported that CRCoV strain 240-05 isolated from Italy encodes proteins of 4.9 kDa, 2.7 kDa, and 12.8 kDa (Lorusso et al., 2009). The 4.9\u201312.8 kDa proteins encoded by three Korean strains were consistent with those of CRCoV strain G9142 and 240-05. The CRCoV-4182 strain isolated from the UK is likely to have undergone genetic mutation. Therefore, it is likely that the proteins encoded by the region between the spike and envelope genes in the CRCoV genome are three nonstructural proteins that are 4.9 kDa, 2.7 kDa, and 12.8 kDa. Coronavirus genes are preceded at the 5\u2032-end by TRSs that commonly include the consensus sequence CYAAAC (Hofmann et al., 1993; Zuniga et al., 2004). In the genetic characterization of the bubaline coronavirus (BuCoV), the predicted nucleotide sequence of TRS encoding the 12.8 kDa protein were shown to be different for BCoV and CRCoV, which were CCAAAC and CUAAAC, respectively.",
