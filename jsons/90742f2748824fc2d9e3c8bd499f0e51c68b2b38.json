Many drug therapy developments consist in investigating through different clinical trials the effects of different specific drug combinations by delivering it into a test group of ill patients, meanwhile a placebo treatment is delivered to the remaining ill patients, known as the control group. We compare the above technique to a new technique in which all patients receive a different and reasonable combination of drugs and use this outcome to feed a Neural Network. By averaging out fluctuations and recognizing different patient features, the Neural Network learns the pattern that connects the patients initial state to the outcome of the treatments and therefore can predict the best drug therapy better than the above method. In contrast to many available works, we do not study any detail of drugs composition nor interaction, but instead pose and solve the problem from a phenomenological point of view, which allows us to compare both methods. Although the conclusion is reached through mathematical modeling and is stable upon any reasonable model, this is a proof-of-concept that should be studied within other expertises before confronting a real scenario. All calculations, tools and scripts have been made open source for the community to test, modify or expand it.

Upon the appearance of a new and contagious disease such as the COVID-19 [12, 13] or any other, urgent working drug therapies are required and usual development times must be stretched and optimized. In many cases a clinical trial consists in a placebo-controlled study: a test group receives a drug treatment and a control group receives placebo. This is necessary to recognize the real drug effect while comparing it to a placebo treatment. These trials need many patients in each of the groups in order to reduce the statistic fluctuations as well as fluctuations that may be originated in uncontrolled or unknown variables which may exist in the patients or in each specific treatment. If the number of patients is large enough, these fluctuations washout and the real effect of the specific drug treatment may be analyzed. The problem with this technique is that each specific drug treatment needs to be taken by a large number of patients, and therefore there is little room to expand in different combinatory treatments. This is translated into a time dilation in finding the best option in drug combinations that would yield the best available therapy.",

Although a normal human research requires to test the same drug and a placebo in many patients to learn its effect as the fluctuations average to zero, a complex Neural Network (NN) could in principle learn from a more diverse dataset in which all patients are tested in a different drug combination. The NN would learn the pattern of the drugs' effect whereas the fluctuations would wash-out to zero in the loss function. This 'reasoning' of the Neural Network could enlarge the scope of the number of possible drug combinations to be analyzed in comparison to the above described usual clinical trial when both techniques use the same number of patients. If this is the case, then the ML technique would be an important tool to find a better drug treatment for a new disease. This is the problem we investigate and present in the current article.",

The drugs' effect on the patients is, among others, non-linear -drugs may interfere with one another-, and patient-dependent. This scenario can be mathematically described as follows. We consider the patient features and initial conditions with a multidimensional vector x, where each component x i corresponds to any kind of patient features or pre-existing conditions which may be relevant for the study, as for instance diabetes or heart pre-conditions, genomics, age group, ethnicity, etc.. The drugs whose combinations are to be studied are described with a multidimensional vector y, where each component corresponds to the daily dose of drug i to be delivered in treatment. For the sake of concreteness and simplicity, for given patient x and drug combination y, we assume a unique treatment that consists in delivering drug combination y every day during a specific fixed number of days. Therefore, for any ( x, y) all treatments consist in the same technique, but with different patient and drug combination. As a result of this treatment, we assume that the patient outcome can be described with a number between 0 and 1: 0 being dead and 1 being in excellent health conditions. In an exact science there would be a function that connects the initial condition and features of the patient to the outcome through a given specific treatment. This health function, which we define as h( x, y), is a multi-variable non-linear unknown function that can take values in [0, 1]. However, in real scenarios there are many uncontrolled variables which also affect the outcome of the given treatment, as it can be some unknown pre-existing condition, a genomic factor, or different physicians providing different evaluation of the patients, among many others. These uncontrolled variables could be included as a stochastic noise on h in different ways. One practical way is to consider a factorizable stochastic modulation on h,",

The distribution of H( x, 0) for random patients x corresponds to the outcome of patients with no drug treatment, and therefore should be mainly below some given bound, since we are assuming that an important fraction of patients do not heal without treatment. The distribution of H( x, y) over x and y should yield values in the proximity of 1 (excellent health), since we are assuming that in principle exists a combination of drugs that can heal patients.

The procedure is to set the x fixed to the new patient features, and vary at random the drugs y until finding the maximum outcome of the NN. Such a drug combination y C would be a customized drug therapy for the patient features.

The part d 1 adds an oscillation that depends on a specific combination of drugs and patient features, allowing here for certain combinations to conspire into an increase or a reduction of the whole value of the function. For example in the second term inside the sin function we see that there is a factor that contains the combination x 1 y 3 \u2212 x 3 y 9 , for which takes into account drug interference between y 3 and y 9 , weighted by the features x 1 and x 3 . The rest of the functions parameters \u03b1 i ,\u03b1 i , \u03b2 i are selected at random, ranging in \u03b1 i \u2208 [0, 10],\u03b1 i , \u03b2 i \u2208 [\u22121, 1]. For each specific set of values of the parameters, we have a certain function H 1 . Thus, the above formulas describe a family of functions H 1 . We checked that for several values of the parameters the distributions of H 1 with and without drugs are sufficiently separated, as in Fig. 3 . We then fixed the parameters' values to reproduce such behavior. Regarding the noise factor S, we use a Gaussian function centered at 1, with a standard deviation \u03b7 and independent of x and y. As we want the output of the function to be in the range [0,1], we have to do two things. First, as it cannot take negative values, we take S to be the absolute value of the Gaussian centered around 1. Then, we calculate the maximum value attained by the part P \u00b7 d 0 \u00b7 d 1 , and take into account possible fluctuations up to two standard deviations \u03b7. We then divide the function by this value H",

            "text": "For the task of building and training the Neural Networks we use Python programming language and resort to the Keras package [18] , for each of the functions we scanned over different architectures and other hyperparameters. The Neural Networks considered were composed of fully connected layers, with RELU activation in all of the units, with a single neuron in the final layer. We turn off the bias in most of the hidden layers to prevent a shift in the output of the NN. As the goal at hand is a regression problem -we want to interpolate the H function given a certain number of sample points-, we used a mean squared error loss function. Each of the H functions is different in complexity and, as such, it would be recommendable to correspondingly choose the number of epochs, the learning rate and the number of neurons. As we need to fit nonlinear functions, we consider deep networks with a number of hidden layers between 4 and 6. For the results in this article, the used architecture consists of 8 hidden layers with neuron numbers of (100, 32, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10) respectively. As we need to avoid overfitting, we have to select architectures with a number of parameters lower than the number of degrees of freedom present in the input data. For example, for N = 500, 5 patient features and 10 drug features, we have 7500 degrees of freedom, for which the complexity of the network cannot be too large. The overfitting of the NN can be checked by plotting the loss function over the training and validation sets. In any case, we have worked in all NN with a dropout of 10% to reduce overfitting.",

While computing the mean squared error treats the fidelity point by point, this method checks whether H N N reproduces the true function behavior over the whole data by yielding a consistently high AUC for each w t .
