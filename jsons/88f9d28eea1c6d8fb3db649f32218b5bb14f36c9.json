For example, Liu et al. showed that the virus RNA copies were significant only in the 27 patient's toilet room [4]; and Ong et al. did not detect virus in air, but detected it on the 28 surface of air outlet fan located very close to the patient [5]. However, a latest study provided 29 evidence that SARS-CoV-2 widely distributed in the air and the transmission distance in the 30 air might be up to 4 m in hospital wards [6]. The report issued by the National Academies of 31 Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine suggested that currently available research supports the 32 possibility that SARS-CoV-2 could be spread via bioaerosols generated directly by patients' 33 exhalation based on collected evidences [7]. For control of opportunistic airborne 34 transmission in health care settings, WHO recommends a ventilation rate at least 288 m 3 /h 35 per person [8]. Natural ventilation or mechanical ventilation system is necessary to achieve 36 such a high ventilation rate. However, natural ventilation is dependent on weather condition 37 and building structure, which make it difficult to achieve such a ventilation rate all the time. 38 Especially, the existing ventilation system in those temporary hospitals receiving and curing 39 COVID-19 patients during this urgent pandemic period usually provides lower ventilation 40 rate, not as high as the recommendations. In health care settings without enough ventilation 41 provided by their existing ventilation system, or none at all, use of indoor air purifiers may be 42 an effective supplementary measure to improve the dilution of indoor air contaminated with 43 virus-laden aerosols. A previous study has proved air purifiers can reduce the health-care 44workers' exposure to aerosols and droplets in dental clinics significantly[9]. 45 distinct size ranges, one in the submicron region with aerodynamic diameter dominant 48 between 0.25 to 1.0 \u03bcm, and the other peak in supermicron region with diameter larger than 49 2.5 \u03bcm [4]. Such aerosols just fall in the size range that can be effectively removed by air filtration, the filtration efficiencies of HEPA is high enough to remove such virus-laden 52",
