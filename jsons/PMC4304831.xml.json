Patients with EV71 infection develop sores on the hands, feet, and sometimes buttocks and mouth, namely hand, foot and mouth disease (HFMD). Although many other enteroviruses cause HFMD in children, EV71 infection is more frequently associated with severe central-nervous-system complications in HFMD patients and thereby is a major cause of fatalities [1,4]. Thus, EV71 is considered the most virulent pathogen among the HFMD-associated enteroviruses. EV71 was first isolated from a sick child in California in 1969, and EV71 outbreaks subsequently occurred in Europe in the 1970s. Currently, HFMD is a major endemic infectious disease, with over one million cases annually in China and Southeastern Asia [3,5\u20137]. So far, the factors that determine the age-dependent susceptibility of children to EV71 infection remain largely unknown.",

            "text": "An early study by Khong et al. has shown that 2-week-old and younger immunodeficient AG129 mice, which lack type I and II interferon receptors, are susceptible to EV71 infection [8]. Their finding suggests that both type I and II interferons (IFNs) are crucial in controlling EV71 infection. Both +ssRNA and -ssRNA are produced in the life cycle of EV71. The recognition of these RNA components by TLR3, TLR7, RIG-I and MDA-5 molecules expressed by host cells potentially induces type I IFN production and limits EV71 infection. Surprisingly, the production of type I IFNs is almost absent in EV71-infected cells presumably because of inhibition by 2C and 3C proteases of the virus [9\u201311]. Consistently, only very low levels of type I IFNs have been detected in EV71-infected mice [8]. Furthermore, a recent study by Shih\u2019s group has shown that mice deficient for interferon alpha receptor were not susceptible to EV71 infection. In contrast, mice deficient for interferon gamma (IFN-\u03b3) receptor were very susceptible to EV71 infection [12]. Altogether, accumulative evidences suggest that IFN-\u03b3, rather than type I IFNs, is likely important in limiting EV71 infection. Interestingly, it has been reported that severe HFMD patients with pulmonary edema have lower numbers of circulating leukocytes, including natural killer (NK) cells and T cells, in comparison to patients with mild disease [13]. Because technically the report has not distinguished NK cells from invariant natural killer T (iNKT) cells, it is entirely possible that iNKT cells, also IFN-\u03b3-producing cells, may also be decreased in severe patients, and could be a link to the development of the disease.",

Following lipid antigen stimulation, iNKT cells express CD40L molecule [14] and rapidly produce high levels of cytokines and chemokines [15,16]. iNKT cells are considered the first line of immune defense and are important mediators that modulate the innate and adaptive immune responses. iNKT cells are implicated in different types of viral infections, helping to control viral load or participate in disease development [17,18].

            "text": "In addition to microbial lipid antigens, iNKT cells recognize self-lipid antigens and are involved in the immune response to infection by microbes, which do not express glycolipids [19\u201325]. Paget et al. demonstrated that stimulation with TLR4, TLR7, TLR8 or TLR9 ligands renders DCs capable of promoting iNKT cell activation in a self-antigen-dependent manner. In terms of TLR9 ligand (CpG)-stimulation, iNKT cell activation fully requires type I interferon or IL-12 in dependence of the types of antigen-presenting cells in the context [24,26]. These results suggest that DNA viruses that contain CpG may trigger iNKT cell activation through the CpG-receptor TLR9. Evidently TLR9 signaling is required for iNKT cell activation in the infection by murine cytomegalovirus (MCMV), a DNA virus [27,28]. The iNKT cell activation does not require CD1d signaling but does require IL-12 production by DCs [27]. The CD1d independence and IL-12 dependence of iNKT cell activation in MCMV infection is unexpected and paradoxical to Paget\u2019s initial observation [24] and to a later finding on microbial infections [19]. The discrepancy and the opposite role of iNKT cells [17,18] indicate that the requirement of iNKT cell activation may vary in different viral infections.",

Similar to the previous reports using C57BL/6 mice [29], the percentages of T cells were 2\u20133-times less in ICR neonates on days 3 and 7 of life compared with 14-day-old mice. Similarly, the percentages of NK and NKT cells were significantly lower in the younger mice. Noticeably, NKT cells were nearly undetectable in the mice before the first week of life (Fig. 1D and S1 Fig.).

To determine the cellular resources of IFN-\u03b3 production after EV71 infection, we cultured splenocytes from C57BL/6 mice with EV71M and analyzed IFN-\u03b3 production in the culture supernatants. We observed that the proportion of IFN-\u03b3-producing cells increased 5\u201320 times upon EV71 infection compared with the controls (Fig. 2A and S2 Fig.). The majority of IFN-\u03b3-producing cells were NK cells, but iNKT cells and NK1.1-negative cells also produced IFN-\u03b3 (Fig. 2A). Because NK and iNKT cells both produced IFN-\u03b3 after EV71M infection, we wondered which cells were essentially required for the IFN-\u03b3 production. RAG1-knockout mice lack NKT cells but have NK cells and other innate components. We therefore cultured RAG1-knockout splenocytes with EV71M and then examined the IFN-\u03b3 production in the cultures. We found that the IFN-\u03b3 production by the splenocytes of RAG1-knockout mice was less than one quarter of wild-type mice, suggesting that the IFN-\u03b3 production of NK cells can not be primarily triggered by EV71 infection (Fig. 2B). These observations suggest that EV71 infection primarily activates iNKT cells, and in return, presumably promotes the activation of NK cells.",

We cultured purified iNKT or NK cells together with EV71M-infected DCs or macrophages and then examined IFN-\u03b3 production in the culture supernatants. As expected, IFN-\u03b3 production was negligible in the culture supernatants of DCs, NK or iNKT cells alone. In addition, co-culture of NK cells with EV71M-infected DCs did not significantly upregulate IFN-\u03b3 production by NK cells. To our surprise, the IFN-\u03b3 production of iNKT cells was also negligible in the co-culture with EV71M-infected DCs (Fig. 2D upper panel). In contrast, the EV71M-infected macrophages dramatically induced IFN-\u03b3 production by iNKT cells (Fig. 2D lower panel). The ability of EV71M-infected macrophages to activate iNKT cells appeared not to be linked with higher level of viral replication than DCs, as the viral titers of macrophages were not significantly different from those of DCs after EV71M infection (S4 Fig.). Therefore, these results reveal that macrophages intrinsically possess the capability to specifically activate iNKT cells upon EV71 infection.",

To identify the potential pattern recognition receptor that recognizes EV71 and triggers activation of iNKT cells, we cultured splenocytes from WT mice or mice deficient for TLR3, TLR7 or MyD88 with or without EV71M and measured the production of IFN-\u03b3 in the supernatants of the cultures. TLR7- or MyD88-deficient splenocytes produced a similar level of IFN-\u03b3 as WT, TLR3-deficient splenocytes failed to produce IFN-\u03b3 in the presence of EV71M (Fig. 3A). Consistently, intracellular staining of IFN-\u03b3 revealed that iNKT cells of splenocytes from TLR3-deficient mice failed to upregulate IFN-\u03b3 expression upon EV71M challenge (Fig. 3B). Thus, these results indicate that TLR3 may be indispensable for iNKT activation in EV71M infection. To further confirm the role of TLR3 signaling in iNKT cell activation, we cultured iNKT cells purified from WT mice together with EV71M-infected macrophages from TLR3-deficient or WT mice and then examined the IFN-\u03b3 expression of iNKT cells. Our results revealed that TLR3-deficient macrophages failed to induce the production of IFN-\u03b3 by iNKT cells (Fig. 3C). It has been reported that the activation of iNKT cells by pathogens in vitro does not always reflect the activation requirements in vivo [31]. We therefore examined the expression of CD69 on iNKT cells obtained from EV71M-infected mice and WT mice. We observed that CD69 expression in vivo was significantly reduced on the iNKT cells from EV71-infected, TLR3-deficient mice in comparison with WT mice (Fig. 3D). Altogether, TLR3 expression in macrophages is indispensable for iNKT cell activation during EV71 infection.",

Likely macrophages harbor a specific capacity to activate iNKT cells upon TLR3 triggering. To address this possibility, we stimulated bone marrow-derived dendritic cells (BMDCs) and macrophages with pI:C and then co-cultured them with purified iNKT cells. Consistent with the previous finding [24], BMDCs stimulated with pI:C failed to upregulate IFN-\u03b3 production in iNKT cells. In contrast, macrophages stimulated with pI:C significantly upregulated the IFN-\u03b3 production of iNKT cells (Fig. 3E).

CD1d deficiency in macrophages also showed dramatically reduced IFN-\u03b3 production by iNKT cells (Fig. 4B). N-(n-butyl)-deoxy-galactonojirimycin (NB-DGJ) is an inhibitor of lactase phlorizin hydrolase, which is the first enzyme responsible for the biosynthesis of endogenous lipid antigens [24,32]. We observed that the addition of NB-DGJ also significantly inhibited the IFN-\u03b3 response of iNKT cells to EV71 infection in culture (Fig. 4C). Furthermore, we adoptively transferred purified iNKT cells into 7-day-old WT mice and CD1d-/- mice and determined the CD69 expression levels of iNKT cells upon EV71M infection. We observed that CD69 expression levels were significantly upregulated on iNKT cells from WT recipient mice but not on those from CD1d-/- recipient mice (Fig. 4D).

Here, we found that the age-dependent susceptibility of mice to EV71 infection was reversely associated with iNKT cell development. EV71 infection triggered iNKT cell activation in a TLR3-dependent manner. Interestingly, TLR3-triggering in macrophages, rather than in BMDCs, activated iNKT cells during EV71 infection. Both IL-12 production and endogenous CD1d ligands were required for the activation of iNKT cells triggered by EV71-infected macrophages. iNKT cells appeared to prevent the spreading of EV71 into central nervous system. Furthermore, TLR3 and CD1d-deficient young mice developed more severe disease post EV71 infection. These novel findings not only help to explain the age-dependent susceptibility of host to EV71 infection but also provide initial knowledge about how infections by RNA viruses trigger activation of iNKT cells.",

            "text": "The incapability of TLR3-mediated signaling in DCs to activate iNKT cells highlights that there is an intrinsic difference in TLR3 signaling pathways between macrophages and DCs. This merits further investigation. However, one caveat is that DCs in our and others\u2019 experiments were in vitro-cultured BMDCs. Unlike in vitro BMDCs, the DCs in lymphoid organs and other tissues of humans and mice are heterogeneous in phenotype and functionality [38]. Thus, it is impossible to exclude some subsets of DCs that may activate iNKT cells upon RNA virus infection in vivo. Furthermore, fecal-oral infection is a natural route of transmission of EV71 infection. CD1d also expresses on the intestine epithelial cells and is involved in the induction of oral tolerance and protection from mucosal infections [39]. We also observed that 75% of CD1d-knockout mice upon oral infection of EV71M developed disease and had significantly higher clinical score than WT mice, as all the wild type mice survived without any palpable symptoms after the infection (S5 Fig.). Therefore, it is also possible that intestine epithelial cells also play a role in the mucosal immunity elicited by iNKT cells against EV71 infection. It is also of great interest to investigate the cell type-dependent activation of iNKT cells in EV71 infection as well as other viral infections in future.",

            "text": "Viruses mostly do not encode enzymes responsible for synthesizing glycolipids that bind to CD1d molecule. Our results showed that blocking CD1d-mediated antigen presentation with antibody and biosynthesis of endogenous lipid antigens in EV71-infected macrophages with an inhibitor significantly decreased the activation of iNKT cells. In addition, CD1d-deficient macrophages post EV71 infection had significantly reduced ability to activate iNKT cells compared to WT macrophages. Furthermore, adoptive transfer of purified iNKT cells also slightly but significantly prolonged the survival of EV71M-infected 3-day-old WT mice, but this protective effect did not occur in CD1d-deficient recipients (S6 Fig.). Similarly, adoptive transfer experiment also suggested that activation of iNKT cells in vivo in EV71M infection also requires CD1d molecule (Fig. 4D). These results all suggested that full iNKT cell activation during EV71 infection required CD1d molecule and its presentation of endogenous lipid antigens. This is in contrast to the findings showing that iNKT cell activation triggered by the infection of MCMV is not dependent on CD1d molecule [27,28]. MCMV encodes a CD1d-like protein, m157, that can directly bind to the Ly49H molecule on NK cells and activate the NK cells [40,41]. Ly49H is still expressed on NK1.1-positive cells in Nfil3-deficient mice that have no NK cells but still have iNKT cells [42], suggesting that iNKT cells may potentially express Ly49H. The potential Ly49H-m157 interaction may thus contribute to the CD1d independence of iNKT cell activation. Altogether, the discrepancy in the CD1d requirement in viral infections may support a notion that different viruses may trigger distinct pathways to activate iNKT cells.",
