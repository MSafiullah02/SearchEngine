            "text": "Hypercapnia in combination with hypoxemia is usually present in severe respiratory disease in the intensive care unit (ICU) and can lead to more severe cognitive dysfunction. Increasing evidence has indicated that the compromised blood-brain barrier (BBB) in the hippocampus in hypoxemia conditions can result in cognitive dysfunction. However, the role and underlying mechanism of hypercapnia in the BBB disruption remains poorly known. A rat model of hypercapnia was first established in this study by intubation and mechanical ventilation with a small-animal ventilator. After this, the cognitive function of the experimental rats was assessed by the Morris water maze test. The BBB permeability was evaluated by the Evans Blue (EB) test and brain water content (BWC). Western blot analysis was carried out to detect the protein expressions of total and nuclear hypoxia-inducible factor-1\u03b1 (HIF-1\u03b1), matrixmetalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) and Aquaporins-4 (AQP-4) in the hippocampus tissue. Double immunofluorescence further verified the protein expression of different biomarkers was localized in the astrocytes of the hippocampus. Hypercapnia alone did not disrupt the BBB, but it could further enhance the BBB permeability in hypoxemia. Concomitantly, up-regulation of nuclear HIF-1\u03b1, AQP-4, MMP-9 protein expression along with increased degradation of the occludin and claudin-5 proteins was found in the hypercapnia rat model, while the total HIF-1\u03b1 remained unchanged. Interestingly, these changes were independent of the acidosis induced by hypercapnia. Of note, after premedication of 2-Methoxyestradiol (2ME2, an inhibitor of HIF-1\u03b1 nuclear translocation), the disrupted BBB could be restored resulting in improvement of the cognitive impairment. Meanwhile, accumulation of nuclear HIF-1\u03b1, protein expression of AQP-4 and MMP-9 and protein degradation of the occludin and claudin-5 were decreased. Thus, our study demonstrated that hypercapnia can further disrupt the BBB through promoting HIF-1\u03b1 nuclear translocation and upregulation of AQP-4 and MMP-9 in hypoxemia. It is therefore suggested that the cascade of hypercapnia-induced nuclear HIF-1\u03b1 protein translocation in hypoxia-activated astrocytes may be a potential target for ameliorating cognitive impairment.",

Specifically, peripheral inflammation can profoundly impair the central nervous system (CNS) cognition through the compromised BBB [10] . It was well recognized that the most closely related to neurocognition region is in the hippocampal substructure: the CA1 area and the dentate gyrus [11] . Montagne et al. suggested that BBB breakdown in the hippocampus is an early event in the aging human brain that may contribute to cognitive impairment [12] . In light of these findings, it was surmised that hypercapnia can further enhance the BBB permeability which would result in aggravating the cognitive dysfunction in hypoxemia. However, detailed mechanisms involved in hypercapnia-induced BBB disruption in hypoxemia have remained to be elucidated.",

They are closely related to the BBB permeability through their end-feet which express Aquaporins-4 (AQP-4) [14] [15] [16] [17] . In the hypoxic rat model, the BBB is compromised due to the upregulation of AQP-4 expression in the astrocytes [17] . Hypoxemia in combination with hypercapnia can further increase the BBB permeability through up-regulation of AQP-4 expression in the rat model [18] . The tight junction proteins (TJPs) which mainly include claudin, occludin, and zonula protein maintain the BBB normal function. Being the most redox-sensitive part of the TJPs, degradation of the occludin and claudin-5 primarily accounts for the increased BBB permeability in hypoxemia [19, 20] . It is well recognized that the degradation of TJPs is by matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), of which matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) is mainly localized in the astrocytes [21] . In hypoxic newborn pigs during resuscitation, hypercapnia can further induce production of MMPs in the ventricles [22] . Hence, under the condition of hypoxemia, hypercapnia may also promote the production of MMP-9 in the CNS.",

In hypoxemia, HIF-1\u03b1 firstly stabilizes in the cytoplasm and then translocates from cytoplasm into the nucleus, where it dimerizes with HIF-1\u03b2 [24] . The HIF-1 heterodimer binds to hypoxia response elements (HRE), where it modulates the transcription of a host of targets against hypoxic conditions [24] . The previous study has demonstrated that MMP-9 and AQP-4 could be up-regulated by HIF-1\u03b1 in the CNS [25, 26] . Furthermore, MMP-9 and AQP-4 expression could be further up-regulated by hypercapnia in hypoxemia [18, 22] , but the mechanism underpinning this further up-regulation has not been established. As far as we know, oxygen (O 2 ) consumption is accompanied by carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) production, hypoxemia and hypercapnia may be perturbed in COPD and ARDS [27, 28] . Hence hypercapnia in combination with hypoxemia may exert different and unique molecular mechanisms unlike that when it acts alone.",

Furthermore, we were interested in searching for the possible drug for ameliorating the hypercapnia-induced neurocognition dysfunction. In this context, we have focused on the drug 2-methoxyestradiol (2ME2), which can confer neuroprotection in the CNS disease [29] . 2ME2 is a naturally occurring derivative of estradiol and devoid of estrogenic activity [30] . It is a potential cancer chemotherapeutic agent, which can tackle cancer with its antiproliferative, proapoptotic, antiangiogenic, anti-tubulin effects [31] . Increasing evidence has shown that the role of 2ME2 on the brain physiology of non-tumor disease is mainly associated with its inhibitory effect on the HIF-1\u03b1 expression [29] .",

            "text": "The present results have shown that hypercapnia could further disrupt the integrity of BBB in the hypoxemic adult rats. Additionally, we have shown that hypercapnia induces the HIF-1\u03b1 nuclear translocation and over-expression of MMP-9 and AQP-4 proteins in hypoxia-activated astrocytes. It is suggested that this had contributed to further disruption of the BBB in the hypoxemic adult rats. Previous studies indicated that hypercapnia can result in more severe cognitive dysfunction [6, 7] . In our present study, a rat model of hypercapnia/hypoxemia was established, in which PaO 2 was maintained at 55-60 mmHg and PaCO 2 was around 65 mmHg with a pH value at 7.20-7.25. This is consistent with the clinical scenarios of COPD and ARDS. In agreement with our previous study [7] , we confirmed here that hypercapnia alone did not sufficiently lead to cognitive dysfunction, but it significantly aggravated the cognitive dysfunction when applied in combination with hypoxemia. Of note, the effect exerted by hypercapnia is independent of the acidosis induced by itself. Furthermore, pretreatment with 2ME2 can prevent the exacerbation of cognitive impairment by hypercapnia.

The average MMP-9 fluorescence (red) density of one single astrocyte in four fields of view per slice was analyzed in each group by the Image-Pro Plus software (c, d). The percentage of MMP-9 positive cells in four fields of view per slice was calculated in each group (e, f). Each data point refers to four fields of view per slice, where n = 24 (4 \u00d7 6, biological replicates). Horizontal lines (black) indicate mean \u00b1 SD. Statistical significance was examined by t test. *p < 0.05; NS non-significant, p > 0.05. MMP-9 matrix metalloproteinase-9; Scale bars: 50 \u03bcm (Color figure online) Despite the above findings, the underlying molecular mechanisms exerted by hypercapnia have remained to be fully clarified. Previous studies have indicated that disruption of the BBB is closely related with the cognitive dysfunction [8, 9] . Furthermore, a recent study has reported that the BBB breakdown in the hippocampus may contribute to the cognitive impairment [12] . In the hypoxic-ischemic models of rats, the BBB integrity was impaired [34, 35] . Hence, we have shown that the BBB permeability was enhanced 3 h after hypoxemic insult in the hypoxemia group. More importantly, hypercapnia can further increase the BBB permeability in the hypercapnia + hypoxemia group. Very interestingly, when the acidosis was neutralized by the trisbase, the further enhanced BBB permeability could not be restored. Taken together, we speculate that hypercapnia may aggravate the cognitive dysfunction through further disruption of the BBB integrity in the hypoxemic hippocampus of rats independently of acidosis.",

First of all, with the AQP-4 protein in astrocytes being up-regulated, the BBB permeability was enhanced [36, 37] . Secondly, being the most important part of the TJPS, the decrease in the occludin and claudin-5 represents the enhanced permeability of the BBB [19, 20] . Under the hypoxic-ischemic conditions, occludin and claudin-5 can be degraded by MMP-9 released from the astrocytes in the brain [38, 39] . Furthermore, MMP-9 and AQP-4 can be regulated by the HIF-1 signaling pathway. Previous studies had demonstrated that the up-regulated expression of HIF-1\u03b1 could induce the up-regulation of the MMP-9 and AQP-4 proteins which would eventually disrupt the BBB integrity [25, 26] . Consistent with this, we had found that 3 h after hypoxemic insult, the MMP-9 and AQP-4 protein expression was increased with a concomitant up-regulation of the total and nuclear HIF-1\u03b1 protein in the H group. Additionally, we have found that hypercapnia alone did not affect the total and nuclear HIF-1\u03b1, MMP-9 and AQP-4 protein production in the astrocytes in the hippocampus. However, in comparison with the hypoxemia group, hypercapnia can induce an increase in nuclear HIF-1\u03b1, MMP-9 and AQP-4 protein production in hypercapnia + hypoxemia group. Following 2ME2 pretreatment, nuclear HIF-1\u03b1 protein in the astrocytes was decreased in comparison with the hypercapnia + hypoxemia group.",

It is documented that 2ME2 is a potent anticancer drug and that it is not a specific inhibitor for HIF-1a [29] . 2ME2 mainly exerts its physiological effects through vasodilatory, pro-apoptotic, tubulin-binding activity in cancer diseases and inhibition of HIF-1a nuclear translocation in non-cancer CNS diseases [40] . The vasodilatory effect of 2ME2 is poorly explored until recently. Previous studies have shown that 2ME2 inhibits phenylephrine-induced tension in the aorta [41] and KCl-induced contraction in the coronary artery [42] through its vasodilatory effect. However, the vasodilatory effect of 2ME2 in the brain have not been explored. The pro-apoptotic effect of 2ME2 is now well-recognized 2ME2 can induce cell death in a variety of malignant cell lines [43] . Tubulin-binding activity is also an important mechanism by which 2ME2 can inhibit tubulin polymerization and induce cell death in cancer cells [44] . However, 2ME2-mediated neuroprotection as reported in this study is unlikely to result from the pro-apoptotic and tubulin-binding activity, because 2ME2 did not induce apoptosis and inhibit tubulin polymerization in normal mammalian cells [45] . Taken together, it is suggested that 2ME2 can confer neuroprotection through inhibition of HIF-1a nuclear translocation in non-cancer CNS diseases.",

It is well known that hypercapnia is generally accompanied by acidosis in vivo. Therefore, cellular effects as observed under conditions of hypercapnic acidosis could be a consequence of elevated CO 2 , decreased pH, or a combination of both [46] . To illustrate this, we next examined whether the pH levels would affect the nuclear translocation of HIF-1\u03b1 protein. After neutralizing the acidosis induced by the hypercapnia through adding tris-base, we found that the effects mentioned above were not reversed. It stands to reason, therefore, that hypercapnia exerts its effect that is independent of the acidosis.",

The secondary antibody was goat anti-rabbit IgG-HRP (1:3000, Cell Signaling Technology, USA, Cat. 7074, RRID: AB_2099233) or goat anti-mouse IgG-HRP (1:3000, Cell Signaling Technology, USA, Cat. 7076, RRID: AB_330924).The membrane was developed using the enhanced chemiluminescence detection system (Millipore, Billerica, MA, USA) and images were developed by an imaging densitometer (ImageQuant LAS 500, GE Healthcare Bio-Sciences AB, Uppsala, Sweden). The relative density was quantified by FluorChem 8900 software (version 4.0.1, Alpha Innotech Corporation, San Leandro, CA, USA). In addition, the expression of target proteins (total HIF-1\u03b1, AQP-4, MMP-9, occludin, claudin-5) was normalized to GAPDH as an internal control. H3 was used as an internal control for nuclear HIF-1\u03b1 protein expression. The specificities of antibodies were demonstrated in the Supplemental Document. docx/ Supplemental Figs. 2-6.",
