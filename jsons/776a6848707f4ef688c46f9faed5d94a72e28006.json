The biological, chemical, and serological studies of the recently emerged SARS-CoV-2 will be greatly aided by the development and optimization of a suitable pseudotyping system. Here, we pseudotyped the SARS-CoV-2 Spike glycoprotein (SPG) on a retroviral (MMLV) as well as a third generation lentiviral (pLV) vector and tested the transduction efficiency in several mammalian cell lines expressing SARS-CoV-2 receptor hACE2. While MMLV pseudotyped the vesicular stomatitis virus G glycoprotein (VSV-G) efficiently, it could not pseudotype SPG. In contrast, pLV pseudotyped both glycoproteins efficiently; however, much higher titers of pLV-G particles were produced.",

Both serums were collected thirty days after onset of symptoms while patients were totally asymptomatic. Antibody testing in a SARS-CoV-2 SPG receptor binding domain ELISA revealed higher levels of RBD-specific IgM and RBD-specific IgG for N304 but lower levels for N308 (Table 1) . Serial dilutions of serum N304 effectively neutralized pLV-S up to 1:1280 dilution whereas N308 did not neutralize the virus at higher than 1:80 dilution (Fig 3) .",

Determining functional immunity has potential social implications as the world community begins to recover from the tremendous social impact of the pandemic. Information regarding the development of herd immunity is important in this effort and can be gained from the results of this assay as well. These pseudoparticles can also be utilized for screening of inhibitors of SPG-hACE2 binding and resultant virus entry. They can also be utilized for screening of potential vaccine candidates as they represent SPG on their surface in its native confirmation.",

All mammalian cells were cultured at 37 \u00b0C with 5% CO 2 .ELISA: RBD-specific antibodies were measured generally according to the protocol developed in the Krammer Lab(17). Briefly, 384-well MaxiSorp plates (Thermo Fisher Scientific) were coated with purified recombinant RBD at concentration of three \u03bc g per ml in PBS. The coating volume and reaction volumes were 25 \u03bc l per well. Plates were incubated overnight at 4 \u00b0C, washed 3x with PBS-Tween20, and blocked with PBS containing 3% dry milk for one hour at room temperature. Blocking buffer was removed, and samples (one log dilutions in blocking buffer, 5x10 1 -5x10 4 ) were added to the wells.Plates were incubated for two hours at room temperature before washing three times.Horse radish peroxidase conjugated to anti-human IgG FC (Southern Biotech) or antihuman IgM (Southern Biotech) was diluted 1:2,000 in PBS containing 1% dry milk, added to the wells, and incubated at room temperature for one hour. Plates were washed five times and developed with tetramethyl-benzidine (Southern Biotech). After30 minutes, development was stopped by adding 25 \u03bc l of 2N H 2 SO 4 to each well. Absorbance was measured at 450 nm. The end point dilution titer is the serum dilution that results in an absorbance of 0.2 absorbance units over background.

The supernatants from cell culture at 24 h were harvested and stored at 4 \u00b0C and more (10 ml) complete media (DMEM + 10% FBS) was added to the plates. The supernatant from cell culture at 48 h was harvested and combined with the 24 h supernatant for each sample. The combined supernatants were spun in a tabletop centrifuge for 5 min at 2000 g to pellet the residual cells and then passed through a 0.45 micron syringe filter. Aliquots were frozen at -80 \u00b0C. New 293T cells plated in 12 well tissue culture dish were infected with the harvested virus (supernatant) with a dilution range of 10 2 to 10 7 . Virus titers were calculated by counting the GFP positive cells in the dilution with 20-100 GFP positive cells. MMLV pseudovirions were made in a similar way. HEK293T cells were transfected with the following plasmids: 10 \u00b5g pLNCX-GFP, 1.2 \u00b5g pCMV-tat-HIV, 6 \u00b5g pJK3, and 3 \u00b5g of pL-VSV-G (control) or pCAGGS-S (SARS-CoV-2). Supernatants were recovered in a fashion similar to above. Patient serum screening: Samples were obtained either from discarded clinical samples or from individual recruited to participate in this study. Written informed consent was obtained from the individuals recruited for this study. The study was reviewed and approved by the Institutional Review Board of the University of Mississippi Medical Center which follows the national and international guidelines consistent with the principles established by the Declaration of Helsinki. Serial dilutions of the patient serum samples (1:40; 80; 160; 320; 640 and 1280) were made in DMEM with end volume of 60 \u00b5l each. Sixty \u00b5l of the supernatant stock (diluted to give 200-500 GFP + cells/well) was mixed with the serum and incubated for 1 h at 37 \u00b0C.
