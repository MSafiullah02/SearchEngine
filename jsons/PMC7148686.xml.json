The genetic material inside the capsid can either be DNA or RNA but never both. The viral genome may be linear or circular and either single-stranded (ss) or double-stranded. As viruses lack organelles and ribosomes, they require the apparatus provided by the host cell in order to replicate. The method of replication depends on the whether the viral genome is DNA or RNA. The steps involved include adsorption, uncoating of the virus, synthesis of viral structures, and release of virus particles by budding or cell lysis. In doing so, host cells can be subjected to transformation with the induction of oncogenes, latent infection, chronic infection, or cell death.",

Type A is the cause of worldwide pandemics, whereas types B and C tend to produce more localized outbreaks and milder forms. Antigenic drift because of minor changes in the NA or HA glycoproteins accounts for epidemics. Antigenic drift tends to lead to less severe disease in individuals pre-exposed to the antecedent virus. Major changes in the HA, called antigenic shift, because of the acquisition of new gene segments can result in pandemics of very severe influenza. This can occur during genetic re-assortment in cells dually infected with a human and an animal virus and hence only occurs with influenza type A.",

Once infected, there is an increased likelihood of developing a secondary bacterial pneumonia, particularly Staphylococcus aureus pneumonia. The most recent pandemic in 2009 was due to an H1N1 strain of influenza A. Other pandemics occurred in 1918 (H1N1), 1957 (H2N2), and 1968 (H3N2). The most recent H1N1 outbreak mainly affected 5\u201324 yr olds, with the obese and pregnant women also at particular risk. Many older patients alive during previous pandemics appeared to benefit from the presence of cross-reactive antibodies against 2009 H1N1. Currently, monitoring of newer H7N9 (Avian flu) strains is ongoing, though sustained human-to-human transmission has not been detected.

Most influenza strains are sensitive to these therapies, but resistant strains are beginning to emerge. Current UK guidance states that all patients with complicated influenza infection should receive antiviral treatment. Antiviral treatment should be commenced as early as possible and should be given on clinical suspicion irrespective of the onset of illness and before laboratory confirmation of influenza virus infection.7 Oseltamivir is to be used for immunocompetent patients. The evidence for use is a reduction in symptoms or disease severity (strongest evidence if started within 48 h of illness onset). Further studies are needed to clarify if there is survival benefit in patients at risk of developing complicated influenza or in patients in whom complications have developed. Zanamivir is reserved for patients who are immunocompromised. There is widespread resistance among influenza A viruses to the amantadine class of drugs (amantadine and rimantadine) so they are not recommended for the current circulating strains.",

It can be particularly severe in premature children, those with chronic lung disease, congenital heart disease, neuromuscular disorders, or immunodeficiency. Prophylaxis with i.m. palivizumab has been considered for high-risk individuals. In the adult population (re-infections), RSV usually causes mild, self-limiting URT symptoms, or flu-like illness. However, it becomes an increasingly recognized cause of pneumonia in the immunocompromised, the elderly (particularly those with chronic lung or heart disease) and residents of long-term care facilities.

Once the vesicles have crusted over and dried up, the patient is no longer considered infectious. It can reactivate from latency in sensory ganglia after periods of stress or reduced cell-mediated immunity. Viral replication and migration along peripheral nerves to the skin then occurs to cause shingles. Diagnosis is usually clinical but can be confirmed by VZV PCR of vesicular fluid.",

Treatment of life-threatening VZV infection and disseminated shingles is with i.v. aciclovir.
