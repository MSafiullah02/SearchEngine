However, the specificity and sensitivity of radiologists in diagnosis of COVID-19 were high and moderate, respectively [8]. Hence, further investigations are needed to help and improve the radiologist's performance. In addition, congestion of patients, as well as a high workload of radiologists, which can increase fatigue, affect diagnostic performance [9,10].",

            "text": "Although for the first time, Lodwick used the term computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) in the literature in 1966 [11], serious attempts on CAD began in the 1980s [12]. Recently, CAD systems have been an inseparable part of a routine clinical practice that assist radiologists in the process of diagnosis. CAD systems have advantages over radiologists. They are reproducible and detect the subtle changes that cannot be observed by the visual inspection [13]. The CAD systems have been widely used to assist radiologists in detecting lung abnormalities. We have included a brief literature review and report the highlights of computerized methods in lung disease management. The system proposed by Than et al. using Riesz and Gabor transforms obtained an accuracy of 98.73% in detecting lung disease. The accuracy increased to 99.53% with the combination of Riesz, Gabor, fractal dimension, grey level co-occurrence matrix, and grey level run-length matrix based features [14]. Gu et al. indicated that a deep convolutional neural network (CNN) could detect lung nodules with a competition performance metric of 0.7967. They proposed a density-based spatial clustering of applications with noise (DBSCAN) algorithm to improve the detection sensitivity of the network [15]. Also, the CAD system based on a 3D skeletonization feature proposed by Zhang et al. can assist radiologists to differentiate lung nodules from interferential vessels [16]. Transforming an image to the time\u2013frequency domain by the optimal fractional S-transform (OFrST) method can provide meaningful information and features, which can be used to diagnose diseases. This method was applied on lung CT images by Sun et al. to detect and differentiate nodules from the vessels. They employed the Teager\u2013Kaiser energy (TKE) in the time\u2013frequency domain to obtain the energy distribution and characterize lung nodules with 97.87% sensitivity [17]. Sun et al. concluded that the CNN represented higher performance than deep belief network (DBN) and stacked denoising autoencoder (SDAE) in diagnosing malignant lung nodules with an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.899 [18]. Furthermore, CAD systems are a useful tool to monitor lung function after transplantation. In this regard, Barbosa et al. compared the quantitative CT (qCT), pulmonary function testing (PFT), and semi-quantitative image scores (SQS) metrics and found that pulmonary function testing and qCT metrics demonstrated the highest accuracy for monitoring bi- and unilateral lung transplantation with an AUC of 0.771 and 0.817, respectively [19]. The potential of CAD systems can go even further and help radiologists to detect lung abnormalities by computerized analysis of pulmonary sounds [20] and flow and gas concentration of breath [21].",

VGG-19 uses 19 layers, including five convolutional blocks (16 convolutional layers) and tree fully-connected layers (fc6-8) [23]. Compared to VGG-16, the VGG-19 is a deeper CNN architecture with more layers (Fig. 3c). SqueezeNet is a compact CNN with up to 18 learnable layers deep to classify images into 1000 different classes [24]. The network starts with a stand-alone convolution layer followed by eight fire modules and ends with a final convolution layer. A scheme of one sample module is illustrated in Fig. 3d. The GoogleNet is a deep model, which is trained on either the ImageNet or Places365 datasets. In this study, we used the GoogleNet trained on the ImageNet dataset [25]. The network is 22-layers deep, starts with three convolution layers, followed by 9 inception blocks, and ends with a fully-connected layer. The inception block as a core part of the GoogleNet is shown in Fig. 3e. MobileNet-V2 is a light-weight CNN with 53 layers deep (52 convolution and one fully connected layers) [26]. The primary part architecture of the network is based on inverted residual and linear bottlenecks. The network starts with three convolution layers, followed by 16 inverted residual and linear bottleneck blocks and ends with one convolution layer and one fully-connected layer. The scheme of the inverted residual block, which is the main part of the network and is illustrated in Fig. 3f. ResNet is a type of deep network based on residual learning. This kind of learning can facilitate the training of networks by considering the layer inputs as a reference [27]. All types of ResNet, ResNet-18, ResNet-50, and ResNet-101, are versions of ResNet that have their specific residual block. ResNet-18 with 22-layers are deep, starts with a convolution layer followed by 8 residual blocks and ends with a fully-connected layer. The main components of the residual blocks of ResNet-18 are shown in Fig. 3g. ResNet-50 is similar to ResNet-18 but has different residual blocks scheme and different number (16) of residual blocks that contain in the network (Fig. 3h). The ResNet-50 contains 50 layers and same is true for ResNet-101. Therefore, it is 101 layers deep with 33 residual blocks (Fig. 3i). The last network, Xception, is CNN based on depthwise separable convolution layers [28]. It starts with two convolution layers, followed by depthwise separable convolution layers, four convolution layers, and a fully-connected layer. The main component of depthwise separable convolution layers are shown in Fig. 3j.",

The results showed that deep learning could distinguish COVID-19 from other atypical and viral pneumonia diseases with high accuracy. The best results were found for the ResNet-101 and Xeption networks. Although the Xeption network implied the highest performances in classifying COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 infections, it did not have the best sensitivity. In contrast, ResNet-101 could diagnose COVID-19 infection with the highest sensitivity and implied lower specificity compare to the Xeption network. It is desired to introduce a method with the highest sensitivity to diagnose all patients with COVID-19. In this regard, the ResNet-101 has an advantage over other networks, especially Xeption, due to its highest sensitivity and AUC. ResNet-101 is trained based on residual learning. This kind of learning can facilitate the training of networks by considering the layer inputs as a reference. In addition, residual networks are optimized easier, and the accuracy can be improved as the depth increases [27]. This specific residual learning can lead to better training and provide robust model. Hence, the best performance can be obtained using ResNet-101. The radiologist classified two groups based on CT slices and patches. The results show that the radiologist failed to diagnose COVID-19 based on patches. The main reason is that a radiologist needs the whole lung lobe to evaluate the intensity of lesions and compare them with the mean density of adjacent organs and structures. However, since computerized image analysis can recognize the pattern quantitatively with more precision, the CNNs could classify two groups with improved performance. The results of the present study indicate that the discriminative power of the proposed CNN is improved compared with the radiologist (AUC of ResNet-101 vs. radiologist: 0.994 vs. 0.873). Also, the deep learning technique can accurately aid radiologists to diagnose infections related to COVID-19.",

The investigators proposed COVNet, which is based on ResNet-50, to diagnose COVID-19, with a resulting 90% sensitivity and 96% specificity. They examined and modified only one CNN, and in contrast, herein we compared the ten most widely used networks to provide comprehensive results, and help the other researchers to prevent redundant analysis and select the best network for their works. Our results indicate that ResNet-101 has an advantage over ResNet-50, the network they used, due to its higher AUC. Unlike us, they fed the whole lung region to their network to differentiate CAP form COVID-19 patients. In their approach, some redundant data such as interferential vessels can be misdiagnosed as pathology [16,31]. Hence, we used ROI based analysis to increase the performance of the network. In addition, they differentiated COVID-19 from community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) diseases. Differentiating CAP from other atypical and viral pneumonia diseases like COVID-19 is not critical in clinics and CT images. The most critical and important issue for radiologists is differentiating COVID-19 and other atypical and viral pneumonia diseases, which are the same in CT imagery and have similar symptoms [32]. Contrary to their study, we include two groups with similar indications, COVID-19, and other atypical and viral pneumonia diseases, to obviate this problem and help radiologists in diagnostic tasks. Few patients with COVID-19 may have initial negative RT-PCR results [33]. Hence, to eliminate any confounding factors, the non-COVID-19 patients who referred to the department before the COVID-19 outbreak were included to ensure that no patients with COVID-19 exist in the non-COVID-19 group. In contrast, they included both patients with COVID-19 and CAP during the same period, which could introduce bias and affect reliability.",

Currently, two primary modalities, RT-PCR and CT, are used to diagnose COVID-19. In this regard, many studies have utilized CT and RT-PCR to evaluate their diagnostic performances; however, the findings must yet be validated. Bernheim et al. [34] and Yang et al. [35] reported that RT-PCR diagnosed COVID-19 earlier than CT, while in some cases, the CT findings could be normal even ten days after symptoms onset. In contrast, Xie et al. [36], Ai et al. [37] and Huang et al. [38] found some cases with positive CT findings and an initial negative RT-PCR screening result, which later became positive upon repeating swab tests. On the other hand, in the pandemic phase of COVID-19, requests for CT Exam has substantially increased. The increased workload can affect the diagnostic performance of radiologists [9,10]. The results of our study indicate that deep learning can characterize the pattern of abnormality effectively, and may help physicians in managing workflow and diagnosing infection related to the COVID-19.",

This molecular assay has limitations including time consumption, high cost, shortage of the kit, and requires well-equipped laboratories. These limitations are overwhelming, especially in middle and low-income countries, and may not be effective in reducing the risk of spreading the disease. Furthermore, since health systems are often weaker in lower and middle income countries, they require technical and financial support to better manage and diminish the risk of COVID-19 efficiently [40]. CT as a first-line imaging modality is fast, widely available, and does not waste materials. In this study, we proposed a CAD system based on CT images to improve diagnostic performance, which can implement in any radiology department and also in deprived areas via telecommunication and analyzing the images remotely. Accordingly, the proposed system could reduce radiologist workload burden and could play a role as an auxiliary tool with regard to decision-making as to whether an infection is COVID-19 related.",
