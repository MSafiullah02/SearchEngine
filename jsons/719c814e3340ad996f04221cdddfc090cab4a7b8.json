This furthers a territorially agnostic discourse about universities, downplays institutional history and purpose, risks concealing innovative practices, and fails to tackle entrenched inequalities. In response, we point to the value of live, place-based debate in HE institutions to highlight distributional inequity, raise local voices and connect these with national policy. Yet even as we compiled this article about HE debate, the Covid-19 pandemic took hold globally, cancelling face-to-face meetings, by necessity. We therefore draw on a postdigital perspective, as we share our individual dialogues in support of debate, via collective writing, against this new backdrop of social distancing and widespread uncertainty. We may not currently be able to convene our Midlands HE Policy Network (MHEPN) debates in person, but we can voice the essential part that regional universities play in connecting global technological and biological change, with local social projects, citizens and industry. Postdigital theory offers one route to understanding that Covid-19 does not sit apart from other political economic challenges in HE and beyond, that we need to debate simultaneously.",

Each of the authors of this paper has presented at and chaired a series of Midlands HE Policy Network (MHEPN) debates that we recently developed and hosted through the Education Observatory, University of Wolverhampton. Each author also participated in the Higher Education Institutional Research (HEIR) Conference, held at the University of Wolverhampton in September 2019, with the theme of 'measuring excellence' in Higher Education. The MHEPN debates were intended as a powerful, place-based forum to hear regional voices that seem to be virtually silenced by the generic structure of national policy frameworks focused on 'measuring excellence'. Now, as we publish our thoughts on the necessity for live face-to-face debate from regional universities unprecedented measures to resist the spread of Covid-19 mean that 'virtual' is literally all that we have left. Whilst the arguments that we share about audible, place-based debate remain highly relevant, a further layer of complexity now unfolds before us. The biological work of this pandemic intermingles with technological communications and social activities to materially and emotionally alter each of our lives.",

Yet simultaneously, this crisis reveals the crucial role that local communities play in any national or global efforts to fight a spiralling pandemic. Now is therefore an important time to 'voice' the essential part that regional universities play in connecting global technological and biological change, with local social projects, citizens and industry. Postdigital theory ) offers one, not entirely perfect, but with room for discussion route, towards understanding also that Covid-19 does not sit apart from other global and local challenges, such as developing creative skills across populations to contend with automation, change, unemployment and opportunity in a 4th Industrial Revolution (4IR) (Peters et al. 2019 ). People's lives are now fusions of both analogue and digital technologies and social practices . Such interconnections can be noticed all around. For example, even as airlines are grounded worldwide, in an unplanned global detox for our atmosphere, we are purchasing (stockpiling perhaps\u2026 and even making by hand\u2026) more plastic bottles of hand sanitiser than ever before. As fast as we seek to communicate crucial information virtually, we also need to be aware of those who may use little or no technology, or who simply cannot afford to. Whilst contactless forms of payment and automated checkouts are prioritised, at the same time, human forms of social care have never been in more demand. Thus, health, social welfare and sustainability concerns are visibly mingling before our eyes, with economic and technological ones. This is a situation that concerns universities at many levels, and not least because it crosses disciplinary boundaries. It is these messy postdigital connections (where many, but not all people, lead lives that are now simultaneously offline and online, material and virtual) that are omitted from national excellence frameworks, alongside deeply contextual differences between our regional universities.",

This is akin to beginning research (rather unethically) by stating what the findings will be before actually approaching the participants. Instead, adopting a grounded, bottom-up approach, using a variety of methods, can make audible the regional voices expressing what is really being done by universities, avoiding assumptions and dynamically informing policy. Perhaps then, at the start of a new (and now very uncertain) decade, it is time to take the triple excellence frameworks of REF (Research Excellence Framework) , TEF (Teaching Excellence and Student Outcomes Framework) and an emerging KEF (Knowledge Exchange Framework) as more of a departure point, rather than a fixed agenda. Even as we write, the deadline for REF has been suspended, buying us all time to reflect on immediate and fundamental change amid a pandemic. Perhaps this is also a good time to thank these exercises for their contribution in revealing the many issues of a national, largely quantitative, rational interpretation of excellence set for universities. After that we might proceed with a richer, more regionally aware agenda, for excellent practices set by universities, one that really reflects, and responds to, contextual and locational diversity:",

The dislocation of place or the relegation of civic interests when, in the words of the Commission, 'university policy remains almost wholly national', feels precisely the wrong approach in today's politics. It downplays institutional history and purpose but worse it betrays a lack of interest in what happens to people and places. At this moment in time, that feels like a huge risk. (Westwood 2019) The singular, generic concept of 'excellence', as it has been articulated in HE policy, has played its part then in furthering a territorially agnostic policy discourse about universities. Unfortunately, (and somewhat irrationally), this has also written out and silenced the very people who are actually positioned to participate in developing more plural excellent practices in teaching, research and knowledge exchange in the community (S. Hayes 2019a; Hayes 2020).",

            "text": "Therefore, secondly, we point to a rather ironic contrast between our national political system and our universities. Active debate takes place daily in the UK Parliament, yet through HE legislation and policy delivering generic excellence frameworks, such measuring effectively shuts down these forms of exchanges within regional, educational institutions. Whilst much attention is focused towards diversity and inclusivity at a national policy level, there seems to be considerably less attention placed on how this plays out differently between institutions and locations. Universities are immersed in different regional contexts, local economies and historical backgrounds. They are interlinked with the communities, schools, industry, local dialects, culture, demographics, deprivation and affluence of the places that surround them. Competing simply to occupy a similar national space risks silencing these diverse voices, and overlooking varying needs, talents and opportunities in each region. Even as we write, we note that (amid the escalating Covid-19 pandemic) the UK government is committing to distributing research-related funding more fairly across the UK (Pells and Inge 2020) . Yet in the days since the budget announcement by Chancellor Rishi Sunak of his 'plan to invest in R&D and cutting-edge technologies' to provide 'support for people in every nation and region of the UK to gain the skills they will need as the economy evolves', the government's pledge 'to level up opportunity and share prosperity across the UK' is also being questioned (Pells and Inge 2020) . Graeme Reid, Chair of Science and Research Policy at University College London, has expressed concern at always being told 'the cheque is in the post,' and bafflement that, 'in a budget that has got some very interesting and clearly well-thought-through content about the place agenda, they've managed to display no progress whatsoever on the Shared Prosperity Fund' (Pells and Inge 2020) . As announcements unfold, a postdigital perspective recognises that whilst scientific and medical knowledge will understandably be key, all steps that are taken will also concern human-technological-material-social-global-regional aspects, as advice is enacted across populations and into the future.",

            "text": "We therefore thirdly each explain (in our own voices) why we believe there is a need for audible place-based debate in HE institutions, via initiatives like our Midlands HE Policy Network (MHEPN). We provide our insights too into why a balance of data, evidence, dialogue, and expertise drawn from our regions is needed, together with suitable investment, to move beyond empty national 'excellence' frameworks alone. This has implications for universities, communities, individuals, and policymakers. Live oppositional argument is just one way dynamically to raise voices from regional univerisites, which are otherwise suppressed by data-driven, nationally focused, measures of excellence. Whilst it is not unusual for media companies to broadcast political debates such as Question Time (BBC 2020) from regional locations, our concern is that such live events appear now to be starkly absent from our educational institutions, where once they thrived. This is not easily changed under current circumstances, when a national lockdown has altered for now the ways in which people live. However, these are key principles that can still be upheld across online technologies and indeed in this article itself. Though our voices are not 'live', or being heard by a group of participants meeting in the same room, they still argue, as they would in that regional context. After each dialogue has been presented, we discuss the role of collective writing about debate\u2026to further debate! Lastly, and certainly not least, we invite others to come forward to host such events as MHERN in the future, (once it is safe to do so), but also to contribute their ideas and voices to extend the experimental format we have developed over the last year. Though it may not currently be safe to crowd into the same room to share the noisy, friendly arguments we have enjoyed during the last year in debate, we can still gather our opinions together, in the act of collective writing.",

These are transmitted across institutions via a rational policy logic which assumes that generic excellent practices can be automatically applied across different contexts with little effort. These frameworks effectively move university mission statements even closer towards competing for a similar space, rather than a diversity of place, as they endeavour to respond to the generic topic of 'excellence'. This leaves HE institutions simply repeating dominant patterns of rationalisation in wider society, like those noted by George Ritzer in his McDonaldisation thesis, and that are now also replicated and augmented online (Ritzer et al. 2018 ). Yet such a generic approach brings with it a troubling opportunity cost, in failing to address regional inequalities, particularly if '\"policymakers\" discursive tropes-from the needs of dynamic \"knowledge economies\" to the benefits of \"excellence\"-distract from the distributional conflicts and power dynamics in the sector' (Schulze-Cleven et al. 2017: 3) .",

Hayes 2017). Couldry argues that 'neoliberal rationality is reinforced not just by explicit discourse but also through the multiple ways in which that discourse and its workings get embedded in daily life and social organization' (Couldry 2010: 12) . As such, neoliberalism crowds out other ways of organising labour and becomes an institutionalised culture, thus shaping our organisation of space. Certain types of spaces become prioritised, whilst others (such as space for critical debate, even in a staff common room\u2026perish the thought..) fall out of use. Unfortunately, the human voices in shared spaces that once existed simply stop being heard (S. Hayes 2019a: 61). This is further reinforced when, in linguistic tone and structure, HE policy discourse, in the shape of 'McPolicy', gives the impression that universities are now the same as any other consumer experience (S. Hayes 2019b; Hayes and Jandri\u0107 2018) . This plays down not only the crucial part that universities need to play as sites of connectivity for 'linking the requirements of industry, technology and market forces with the demands of citizenship' (Delanty 2001) , it also effectively removes an authenticity of place and region (Jopling and Johnson 2019 ). Yet it is precisely this civic focus 'that might just help to rebuild trust in universities as well as restoring local growth and tackling deep regional inequality' (Westwood 2019) . These are key concerns as the realities of underinvestment in regions, as well as nationally focused assumptions are revealed in the responses to Covid-19 and a 4th Industrial Revolution (Connor et al. 2019 ). Now is not the time for policy or media rhetoric to drown out diverse regional voices that express a sense of personal investment and belonging, which leads to both the civic engagement and the creative enterprise we need to draw upon in wider society. Nor should we further a dangerous culture, where education is developed towards therapy, rather than to further autonomous thinking (Ecclestone and Hayes 2019) .",

            "text": "At a time of review also for the UK Professional Standards Framework (PSF) (Advance HE 2020), questions can be asked about whether this too is now occupying the same dark, deserted alley. With potential at its infancy to inform dynamic and diverse, regional teaching practices, Warnes (2020) argues that the PSF has become subsumed, as part of generic university Fellowship schemes, to 'bolster corporate excellence statistics for marketing purposes'. This means: 'the personal value of individual excellence is converted via performance management into impersonal institutional excellence' (Warnes 2020) . By definition then, no direct links can now easily be drawn between a framework once aimed at improving the learning experiences of students through reflexive teaching practice, which has been reappropriated to support 'neoliberal \"carrot and stick\" performance review policies aimed at improving the skill level of the workforce and/or rooting out underperformers' (Warnes 2020) . Fawns et al. (2020) point out that many practices are not adequately captured in data that relies on teachers' and students' activities conforming to an anticipated model. They suggest instead that a balance of data, evidence, dialogue, and expertise is necessary. Furthermore, within their 'ecological' view of HE institutions, rather than considering the performance of individuals in isolation, evaluation can also look at policies, systems and environments, and how these support and constrain educational practice (Goodyear and Carvalho 2019; Fawns et al. 2020; S. Hayes 2019a) . As such, they call for analytics that are part of a wider, ecological view of education, where relationships and holistic conceptions of practice are valued above individual variables (Goodyear and Carvalho 2019) , and where it is acknowledged that metrics do not capture everything that is important (Fawns et al. 2020) . It is here that we suggest that audible regional debate has an integral part to play. Fawns et al. (2020) emphasise the importance of dialogues between teachers and students to make sense of how the formal curriculum intertwines with informal, extra-curricular activity and emergent sites of learning. They suggest that in engaging in dialogue (through workshops, interviews, and other events) with stakeholders, including teaching and administrative staff, students, and the wider community, a values-led vision for universities can be furthered (Fawns et al. 2020) .",

Self-isolation may involve a physical removal of humans from social contact, but it is dialectically linked to forms of digital communication, online and offline choices, economic and political decision-making, and media reporting.

His general defence was that, unlike beasts, we can use language to discuss, criticise and argue. We do not rely on trial and error but can discover error before a trail has damaging consequences. He concluded 'To eschew debate is to inhibit progress'. His personal defence was that we seldom know anything 'unless we can explain it to others and defend it against criticism'.

It is precisely this calling into question that we thought this network could encourage through discussion, provocation and debate.

As our attachments to place become more complex in the UK and other countries, we seem to be increasingly drawn towards, and welcome, simple oppositions. The North-South divide in England is one such opposition. Where does the Midlands sit in all this? It is striking that even advocates for fairly radical forms of regionalism (e.g. Niven 2019) tend to fall into old, oppositional geographical patterns, even whilst ingeniously co-opting the South West into the North. We associated MHEPN with the 'Midlands' because it is simultaneously a useful regional marker (although with very open borders) and an ambiguous one. The Midlands represents both somewhere, drawing on a history of debate, challenge, and calling into question, and nowhere. As a between space below the North and above the South, the Midlands resembles the modern university, caught between oppositions such as excellence and enquiry, learning and delivery, student and customer. This does not mean it is the only space in which to debate these kinds of issues, but it does seem to make it a valuable one.",

As regional institutions, where a rich array of voices express what is actually being done by universities, we have a much stronger chance, if connections can be made with wider policy. In order to develop this dialogue, we need to move away from an approach to writing policy that effectively writes out the labour of students, teachers and leaders (S Hayes 2019a). It is their place-based innovations, creativity and diverse voices that contribute towards reducing regional inequalities and developing skills. It is here in the varied regions of the UK that universities are crucial sites too, for connecting global technological change with local social projects and citizens. In a 'new political economy of higher education', it is a problem if research simply remains 'policy-orientated, descriptive and under-theorised' (Schulze-Cleven et al. 2017) . Debate across regional institutions therefore provides a vehicle to connect new modes of inquiry and to surface academic perspectives on personal positionality, in 'the new postdigital political economy of HE' (S. Hayes 2020). Postdigital positionality is just one way to interpret our individual contexts and to appreciate that people's lives are now fusions of analogue and digital technologies and social practices ).

Live debate happens in a certain place, and those places matter.

Right now, all eyes are understandably on the Conservative Government's responses to the Covid-19 crisis, but this pandemic does not sit apart from other political economic challenges in HE, and beyond. Whilst political and economic measures to enact Brexit continue, a biological epidemic has travelled throughout Europe and across the globe, simultaneously grinding human travel to a halt. Over a matter of days, our global lives have returned to local lives, by necessity. As we try to grapple with overwhelming implications, postdigital insights can further our thinking and responses. Covid-19 has wrought tragedy on a huge scale, but even amid social isolation, we can make collective, productive observations as we look to the future. The current health crisis has all but closed universities, but these regional institutions are feeding into the collective effort to both research Covid-19 tests and vaccines and to manufacture lifesaving equipment. Across the underperforming regions surrounding many of these universities, low-paid care assistants and supermarket workers are being relied upon, as much as professors and doctors. Predicted automation linked to 4IR has therefore not simply replaced human cashiers and shelf stockers, as anticipated in simple terms, because technological change is interconnected with all other forms of change. There is nothing new in this situation of course. After the Black Death in the fourteenth century, unskilled labour was at a premium. In England at least, this was pivotal in destroying serfdom as it had existed for hundreds of years. Thus, our current circumstances, alongside rapid technological changes, are worthy of continuous debate as we consider how 'levelling up' economic performance and closing gaps between regions might be achieved going forward. As regions unite to tackle the crisis, government thinking on HE and the economy needs to recognise the 'anchor institutions' (Skidmore 2020) in overlooked communities, to support their research and to aid their graduates who stay and work in these regions. In each of these places, spaces for live academic dialogue need to gain momentum to rethink what HE can now achieve.",

The imposed rationalities of national and context-free frameworks for excellence only serve to negate personal and institutional positionalities, in our postdigital contexts as they stand. This risks closing down critical, locational dialogue that yields creative and innovative solutions to both current, and future, crises. Couldry (2010) has argued, 'voice matters'. Our HE policy texts are currently devoid of the regional and contextual voices that matter. This needs to change if the many statements about inclusivity and diversity we read in national and institutional policies are to be upheld. The MHEPN has experimented with one way to restore live, audible, human argument in response. This yielded a powerful response from our colleagues requesting more of these forums. Given that universities are crucial sites to connect global, technological change with local social projects and citizens, we owe it to each other to debate what it really means for humans to re-occupy policy, now and in the future (S. Hayes 2019a). A postdigital perspective recognises all of the aspects that we have brought together above, as intertwined dialectically with each other across time and space. In a further layer of complexity, the biological work of a pandemic has connected with technological communications and social activities to materially and emotionally alter the lives of most people on the planet. This too has raised some voices, suppressed others and restricted global freedom of mobility, requiring people to remain (for now) in their local places.",

If the initial, modest steps to allocate scarce resources for major science investment, which inspired the first Research Assessment Exercise worked (at least for big science), the subsequent explosion of centrally determined data captures, and the emergence of league tables-and their attendant homogenisation of higher education, has had the perhaps understandable effect of corroding academic collegiality. It has done this in too many places through a top-down managerialist culture, as institutional leaders, trapped in a fiscal fight, if not quite to the death, struggle to respond to external demands that risk distorting institutional missions. All of this has taken place in the name of marketization. The cost of these ways of thinking to institutions' responsibility to locality was, for me, graphically highlighted as Nottingham University decimated its regional adult learning programmes whilst opening a new shiny campus in Ningbo, China (Tuckett 2017) .",

The paper emerges from the debates generated in the Midlands Higher Education Policy Network, and is properly alive to the bleaching out of regional responsiveness from the drivers shaping current higher education. Yet, whilst it is properly on the side of devolution rather than a one size fits all centralised higher education discourse, and whilst it celebrates the diversity and difference in a cooperative dialogue, it stays comfortably within the sectoral boundaries of higher education. What, I wondered as I read it, would be different in a wider discussion of the sort that the Cape Learning Region in South Africa engaged in, as educators struggled to explore the distinctiveness of different institutional forms, whilst working to create a wider learning culture. Those ideas have fired the resurgence, globally of interest in Learning Cities and Learning Regions, amongst them the Wolverhampton Learning City Region. There, inevitably, educators recognise that in reconfiguring a learning culture, academics need allies in business, industry, the faith and voluntary sector, and need, too, to imagine new forms of association, involving adults and young people of all sorts. That, surely, is the humus that will be needed if a politics linking productivity, skills, and a learning culture are to be revitalised.",

There we saw a region in action. The event had a focus-that of academic activism as it happens, and it was held within a larger territory (that of the Philosophy and Theory of Higher Society)-and so it had a border, community, voices, conversation and an identity.

Perhaps, though, some elements are more clearly visible than others. Is there, need there be, a definite border to a 'Midlands' network. It seems to embrace Manchester but not Birmingham! There are certainly voices and conversation here and we can sense that it builds on a larger community, that of a regional policy network. Of its identity, we cannot be too sure. But what, in these days of fluidity, is to count as identity? Can identity ever be pinned down? It is always in the making.",

An implication of the term is that we can get beyond the digital and put the digital behind us or, at least, move onto a higher level of being; but any such temptation must be eschewed. Even those who have no access to computers (often forgotten by those in higher education) are influenced by the Internet, if only in services, messages, cultural resources and information denied to them. We are all not post-digital but co-digital, whether we like it or not. All of us, at every level (personal, institutional, national), have our own accommodations to the digital age. Simultaneously, we live with the digital, conduct ourselves alongside the digital, try to outlaw the digital, embrace the digital, hide from the digital, spy on the digital, and court the digital. We are all socially distant from, or socially proximate to the digital; and often both of these, and many other postures as well, in the one set of relationships. None of us is post-digital.",

And how significant, for the university, is the element of face-to-face encounters? It has long been observed that some students are more comfortable in online learning. There is a shadow presencing here: neither fully in the face of the other but yet sufficient space for one to express a point of view and to have a voice. Perhaps something similar can be observed for the academics themselves. Now, perhaps, digital media are helping to realize Habermas' ideal speech situation-and it was advanced as an ideal. In the contemporary interactive digital media, inequalities of position fade, if only a little. Formal positions and title ('Professor', 'Dr', 'Student') recede, to be replaced by a name on the screen. Academic identifiers are now more equal.",

The authors of this writing collective have surely hit on three key points: in the presence of strong states (say, the UK, France, China), the regions are subjugated; a potential mismatch between debate at the national level and its near absence at the regional level; and (consequently) the overlooking of regional identities that are sometimes at odds with the central policies, which are imposed upon the regions. This set of ingredients is a recipe not only for dull uniformity but also for the suppression of regional difference, autonomy and vitality. (It is ironic that, as the authors observe, their exchange is conducted in the presence of a virus pandemic, for its shaping in the UK has followed just this pattern, of failed attempts at the centre to dominate the regions and with dire consequences.) So there are assuredly tasks and responsibilities for those in geographical regions to work at forming regional identities (which have hitherto) been subjugated. Voice, identity, community and conversation can and should all be worked at. In the process, new kinds of digital citizenship may emerge. Shall we call the new forms of happening not just 'gatherings' but 'purposive gatherings'? It is right, however, that the geographical border(s) remain indistinct. Let the borders stay open; well, reasonably open at least.",
