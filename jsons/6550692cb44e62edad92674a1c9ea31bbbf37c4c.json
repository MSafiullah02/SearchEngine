Nevertheless, the real impact of such important measures has not been appreciated due to the lack of proper metrics. In this work, we have proposed a method for estimating a lower bound for the number of positive cases by using the reported data on the oldest age group and the regions' population distributions. The proposed estimation method improved the expected similarity between the age-distribution of positive cases and regions' population. Further, we have provided a quantitative measure for the impact of intensive care on the critical cases by comparing the CFR among those who did and did not receive intensive care. Our findings showed that the chance of living among non-ICU receivers is less than half of ICU receivers (\u223c24% vs \u223c60%).",

One of the earliest attempts to estimate the CFR for COVID-19 was done by Baud et al. [2] . They took into account a 14-day incubation time for COVID-19 and estimated mortality rates by dividing the number of deaths on a given day by the number of patients with confirmed COVID-19 infection 14 days before. However, the CFR calculated by Baud et al. was an overestimation due to under-testing at the beginning of the pandemic and improper phase lag estimation. Spychalski et al. estimated CFR based on the total number of confirmed cases and showed that this approach is least affected by the reporting biases [3] . In another study, Dehkordi et al. discovered that the distribution of daily confirmed cases and the number of deaths in a specific region have a quasi-linear relationship if an optimum phase lag for number of deaths is calculated. In their work, optimum phase lag was calculated by minimizing the error for the regression line while changing the phase lag. Then, CFR for that region was corrected by dividing the number of deaths on a specific date by the total number of confirmed cases on a shifted date (based on the optimum phase lag) Dehkordi et al. [4] .",

These discrepancies are generally known to appear because of two reasons: (1) inaccurate estimations of CFR; (2) the differences in health care quality metrics. However, the real effect of each factor has not been effectively quantified. As for the estimation of CFR, it must be realized that not all of the infected cases are symptomatic. For example, Liu et al. showed that 23% of transmission in Shenzen was originated from pre-symptomatic infections. Further, testing all members of society is not feasible at the moment due to limitation in throughput of current assays and lack of antibody detection tests ready for the public use. CFR can also be underestimated because of the delay between diagnosis and reporting of the positive cases [3] . As for the impact of health care, one must note that because of the nature of the disease, the intensive care capacity and the time that this cap is reached significantly influence the CFR. In light of this, there is a great need for quantitative assessment of the aforementioned factors on CFR.",

Ongoing research by the community has shed light on the reality of such mechanism. For example, it is now evident that respiratory, contact and aerosol transmission are the main mechanisms by which the virus spreads [5, 6] . Accordingly, countries that were heavily impacted by COVID-19 were forced to put in place various mitigation policies. Also, it has been shown that initial viral load is important for a more effective transmission of the disease [5, 7] . However, there is little known about whether people with different age have different susceptibility to the infection [8] . Given a higher mortality rate for older cases, in one study, Li et al. showed that more than 50% of early Patients with COVID-19 in Wuhan were more than 60 years old. However, under-representation of younger people was suspected to be attributed to the fact that some of young infected people were asymptomatic [5, 6, 9, 10] . Therefore, in the absence of a true picture of the disease behavior, data scientists are instead urged to practice realistic assumptions when evaluating CFR.",

Also, in order to improve the estimation of number of positive cases, the data on the oldest age group, namely >80-year-olds, are used to calculate an infected population ratio. Such infected population ratio will then be used to estimate the number of positive cases in other age groups. Furthermore, using corrected estimated CFR (based on our previous work [4] ), we provide a new perspective on the importance of healthcare system capacity. Importantly, a quantitative measure for comparing the access vs no access to ICU beds for critical cases, in terms of fatality rate, will be provided. In accomplishing so, the following assumptions are made: (1) Infection mainly occurs through the three aforementioned known mechanisms of transmission; (2) Susceptibility to catching the virus is not age-dependent; (3) On average, >80-year-old cases have less number of social contacts than younger population [11] ; and (4) All >80-year-old cases are symptomatic and correctly identified. Because of our last two assumptions, our analysis provides only lower bound estimates to the positive number of cases.",

On March 7, the intensive care rate shows a drop, which could be due to the fact that limit of health care capacity was reached, while the number of cases that needed intensive care continued to grow. Following that, one day after this drop, a sudden increase in CFR was observed for Lombardy. It is also observed that, starting on March 7, CFR surpassed intensive care rate, which means, from this date on, some patients that critically needed intensive care did not get a chance to receive it.",

Motivated by a report from the World Health Organization (WHO), which provided numerical percentages for mild, severe, critical and fatal cases, a best fit curve was obtained to overlay shifted curve for fatal cases and the curve for a fraction of critical cases. World Health Organization (WHO) provided numerical percentages for mild, severe, critical and fatal cases [24] . Motivated by this, we investigated the possibility of correlating the number of fatal cases to the number of cases that received intensive care. For this purpose, first, the fatal cases were shifted based on the phase lag value obtained from CFR calculations [4] . Next, a percentage factor that could correlate the shifted number of fatal cases to the number of intensive care cases was obtained. This was done by minimizing an error describing the difference between the two curves. The resulting percentage value was \u223c40%. Accordingly, we compared, in the chart of Fig 1c, the numbers for fatality cases versus 40% of cases that received intensive care. In this chart, the horizontal line represents 40% of intensive care capacity. It is observed that, fatal cases and 40% of intensive care receivers, which fairly overlap until March 5, start to diverge on March 6, when the maximum capacity of intensive care is reached. The 40% factor used for intensive care capacity is for the normalization purpose, to assure that the numbers of intensive care receivers and intensive care capacity are compared on the same scale. Note that, the number of intensive care receivers continues to grow after it reaches the ICU cap, which implies that additional ICU beds have continuously been added but with a rate slower than required to accommodate all cases in need of it.",

Such expected number of fatal cases was estimated using the number of confirmed cases and an average CFR value calculated from the days prior to reaching the cap of ICU beds. This CFR number was \u223c8.45% as can be construed from Fig. 1a . The resulting expected number of fatal cases is shown in Fig. 1c , which follows the actual number of fatal cases, before ICU bed cap is reached, but remains below the actual number of cases ever since. The numbers for actual fatal cases, the expected fatal cases as well as the number of cases that receive intensive care are used to quantitatively estimate the effect of shortage of ICU beds on exacerbation of fatality rate. For this purpose, the fatality rate was estimated for critical cases who did not have access to standard ICU beds and was compared with that of those who had access to them, which are assumed to form \u223c40% of the cases. This result is presented in Fig. 1d . Note that, as opposed to the fatality rate for the group that had access to ICU beds, the fatality rate of the group that did not have access to ICU is graphed only after March 8. The reason for doing so is that, the latter group essentially was non-existing before March 8, as the cap of ICU beds was not reached yet. The fatality rate for the group, without access to ICU, spiked to \u223c96% right after the cap was reached and slowly stabilized at \u223c76%. This means that the chance of living for cases in need of intensive care, but not having access to it, was only about \u223c24% as opposed to he \u223c60% chance of living for the group that received the intensive care. The fatality rate of the group with no intensive care never reached 40%.",

Further, we have provided a quantitative measure for the impact of intensive care on the critical cases by comparing the CFR among those who did and did not receive intensive care. We showed that \u223c40% of intensive care cases are fatal and that lack of access to ICUs immediately impacts the CFR. Our results showed that the chance of living among critical cases who don't receive the intensive care remains less than half of ICU receivers (\u223c24% vs \u223c60%). The proposed approach can serve as a generic tool for the community to conduct rigorous quantitative analysis on COVID-19 data from various regions. The resulting analyses provide insight for the policy makers regarding positive case distribution of the disease and the real impact of intensive care capacity on the fatality rate of COVID-19.",
