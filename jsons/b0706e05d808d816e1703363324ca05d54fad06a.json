We used publicly available data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention FluView Interactive to evaluate its potential for COVID-19 syndromic surveillance.

If undocumented cases of COVID-19 are present in the United States and individuals infected display an ILI syndrome, we hypothesized there may be a differential burden of ILI versus reported laboratory-confirmed influenza disease.

However, the WHO guidance relies heavily on SARS-CoV-2 testing, something that continues to be difficult in many countries including the United States. Even when testing kits are available, reagents and genome extraction kits continue to be in limited supply. Due to these issues, a syndromic A potential limitation of this analysis is that FluView shares public health and clinical laboratory data but may be limited in the number of influenza diagnostic tests conducted as influenza disease is not a reportable illness, therefore misclassification is possible. Further, reporting may be delayed, or influenza testing may be limited due to supply constraints or other burdens of the COVID-19 pandemic. Here, we found a decrease in the number tested for influenza and evaluated for influenza like illness in the current year but not prior years. This could explain some of the discrepancy. This is also the very beginning of the outbreak in the United States, with only a limited number of weeks of potential transmission evaluated. The outbreak is too far in its infancy in the United States to validate our results. Further, if transmission were to be occurring in peak influenza season, it could be difficult to discriminate between influenza and non-influenza respiratory illness such as COVID-19, potentially impacting the utility of this syndromic approach. These data must all be taken under the consideration that we have never experienced a pandemic of this magnitude during a time when computational and data resources were as available as they are today in a highly globalized environment. Much like predictive models for COVID-19, all analyses may change rapidly due to the constant influx of new information.",
