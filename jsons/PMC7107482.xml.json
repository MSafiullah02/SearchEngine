Human adenovirus-E datasets consisted of 6 novel genomes and 40 representative virus isolates of HAdV-E4. The datasets were analyzed using different methods as implemented in Recombination Detection Program (RDP4) [35]. These methods included RDP, GENECONV, Bootscan, MaxChi, Chimaera, SiScan, and 3Seq and their P values estimated. The breakpoints positions and their major and minor parents were identified for putative recombination strains.

The ML topologies (Supplemental Figure 5B) indicate that SG05 recombinant was descended from C1, but it also comprised genetic components from the BJ04 recombinant strain. The BJ04 strain was crucially important [37] because it has been shown to bear gene sequences from 3 different genotypes: HAdV-C1 at (position 1\u201318076, comprising E1A, E1B, penton base), HAdV-C2 (18077\u201333397, comprising hexon and fiber), and HAdV-C6 (33398\u2013end, comprising the E4 gene region).

Another recombinant, SG09, was found to be almost identical (99.9% nucleotide identity) to SG05, therefore they both displayed the same breakpoint location (Supplemental Table 2) and RDP graph (data not shown) as well as the phylogenetic position as expected (Supplemental Figure 1).

More important, patients with HAdV-C2, HAdV-E4, and HAdV-B7 were more likely to have severe disease. Hence, it seems prudent for public health officials and clinicians to consider using antiviral therapies and HAdV vaccines in Singapore. For instance, brincidofovir, an experimental antiviral therapy, is being used in the USA against severe HAdV infections with good outcomes [39\u201341]. In addition, a very effective \u201cAdenovirus Type 4 and Type 7 Vaccine, Live, Oral\u201d has been used among US military personnel since 1971.

The high prevalence of HAdV-E4 infections identified in our study is intriguing. The HAdV-E4 genes and genome have been shown to be almost identical to several chimpanzee adenoviruses, including the SAdV-E25 genome at 91% and the SAdV-E26 at 92%, with the 1952 prototype as reference [38, 43]. These values are consistent with HAdV-E4 being the only HAdV amongst several chimpanzee adenoviruses phylogenetically grouped within HAdV species E, supporting a zoonotic origin, consistent with current hypotheses that cross-species infections may lead to the emergence of novel human pathogens [44]. Furthermore, sequence analysis of 2 recent circulating HAdV-E4 strains revealed a recombination event that provides a conserved DNA replication motif (NF-I), likely from a respiratory pathogen of HAdV species B, that is present in almost all HAdVs but absent in SAdVs as well as the HAdV-E4 prototype and contemporaneously circulating isolates, including the \u201cvaccine\u201d strain [38, 45]. This HAdV-like motif, as well as the conserved core origin and NF-III motif, were present in all 6 of the fully sequenced Singapore HAdV-E4 genomes. The NF-I human transcription factor and its binding have been extensively characterized molecularly and biochemically as required for optimal HAdV DNA replication [46, 47]. This putative genome-based host adaptation may be the \u201ctipping point\u201d that has allowed HAdV-E4 entry into a global general population, which is presumably immunologically naive to its epsilon (hexon) antigen, because HAdV-E4 had been known to circulate sporadically outside the US military basic trainee populations [20, 48\u201350]. The recombination event is likely a recent one, with the earliest appearance in 1978 (KX384956 V0014/France/1978) as noted in a resurvey [23] of 2 sets of recently released genomes that include archived and currently circulating military and civilian HAdV-E4 isolates [20, 49], and it may be important as an example of a molecular evolution pathway by which zoonosis may be a source of emergent human pathogens [44].",

It is notable that SG06 was the only HAdV-C2 strain fully sequenced in our study and was isolated in 2016 from a severely ill 2-year-old Singapore patient requiring oxygen therapy. Given the observed increased risk for severe disease among the 6 prospective pediatric patients infected with HAdV-C2, 4 infections of which occurred within a 1-month period, we speculate that these patients might represent a cluster.",

It is also possible that some of the HAdV infections were not associated with the acute clinical presentations. Our study could have been strengthened by testing blood (or another sterile compartment such as CSF) from all study patients or by testing matched patient controls to demonstrate a stronger probability of disease association. However, the prevalent genotypes identified (ie, HAdV-B3, HAdV-B7, and HAdV-E4) were genotypes that are commonly known to cause acute respiratory infections. Finally, mixed HAdV infections could not be ruled out as the cause of the untypable patient samples (14%). This theory is supported by the observed increased risk for severe disease among patients infected with an \u201cunknown\u201d HAdV genotype, as well as the high prevalence (40.9%) of unknown HAdV genotype infections among immunocompromised patients in our study. Another reason for an untypable sample is inadequate HAdV DNA for amplification, resulting in an unknown HAdV genotype classification. The majority of these untypable samples were adult samples, which is consistent with the theory that infected adults shed less virus when compared with children.",
