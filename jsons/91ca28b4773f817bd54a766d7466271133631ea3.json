The mean time from onset of symptoms to diagnosis was 3.4 years (0-10) and patients were listed for OLT an average of 10.8 months (0-60) after diagnosis. The mean time from listing to OLT was 8.2 months (1-18). Five patients died after OLT, during a mean follow-up of 3.5 years (4 months -6 years). One-year patient survival was 100% and threeyear patient survival was 92%. One patient required retransplantation for hepatic artery thrombosis. Neurologic symptoms were the initial clinical manifestation in the majority of patients (7/12), followed by cardiopulmonary (4112) and gastrointestinal symptoms (1112). Most patients experienced multiple symptoms. Subjective evolution of symptoms as assessed by chart review demonstrated that symptoms referable to amyloidosis worsened after OLT in seven patients, and improved or stabilized in five.

Prior to OLT, all twelve patients had an increased IVST on echocardiogram. Post OLT cardiac symptoms improved in six patients (five of whom also had cardiac transplantation), worsened in three patients, and were unchanged in three patients (one of whom also had cardiac transplantation BACKGR0UND :Accurate delineation of the scope and magnitude of peri-operative donor risk is necessary to better allow for informed consent, to maximize the potential for donor safety, for comparative outcome analysis and ultimately to serve as a key determinant of the utility of adult-to-adult living donor liver transplantation (AALDLT). However, at present, there is lack of uniformity regarding what constitutes a complication in this setting. Moreover, a system to stratify adverse events with respect to their life altering (quantity or quality) impact is lacking. AIMS: 1) to define a graded, inclusive classification schema for both early (E) and late (L) adverse operation-related events in live liver donors a n d 2) to apply this system to a retrospective review of events in individuals undergoing partial hepatectomy for live liver donation at our center. Two patients (6.5%) suffered cut-surface bile leaks and one (3.2%) a right colon injury (Grade 3E complications). One patient (3.2%) developed a transient bilateral ulnar neuropathy (Grade 2E). Two patients (6.5%) were readmitted within 30 days of operation for nausea and dyspnea respectively (Grade 1E). One patient underwent repair of an incisional hernia 6 months post donation (Grade 2L). One patient suffered positioning-related brachial plexopathy (Grade 3L). CONCLUSIONS: The definition and adoption of a graded, scale-based system of operation-related adverse events in live liver donors will allow for an inclusive, consistent and universally applicable method to collect, analyze and report donor complications. All AALDLT programs must be encouraged to fully review and report their donor related morbidity, ideally through the creation of a national donor registry Initiation of antiviral therapy in the early post-transplant period, prior to overt evidence of HCV recurrence (i.e. preemptive therapy) may enhance rates of HCV eradication. Aims: To determine the efficacy and tolerability of preemptive IFN versus IFNlRBV in anti-HCV positive LT patients. Methods: Consecutive and eligible LT recipients from a single center were enrolled. The goal was to initiate treatment within 6 wks of LT. Patients were randomized to IFN or IFN plus RBV (400mg daily X 2wks, then 800mg daily X 2 wks, then 1.0-1.2g daily based upon body weight 75 kg). Induction therapy with daily IFN was used for the first 8 wks (1.5MU daily X 2wks, then 3MU daily X 6 wks) followed by 3 MU TIW (N=39) or peg-IFN 1.5 uglkglwk (N=10) for 40 wks. Key inclusion criteria were stable clinical status, Cr45,OOO and WBC>3.0. Dose reductions for side effects, especially cytopenias were standardized. Growth factors were given for neutropenia (ANC<1000) and anemia (Hgb<9.0gldL) beginning 7l2001. Virological (VR) and biochemical responses (BR) were evaluated at end-of-treatment (ET) and 6 mos post-treatment (sustained virological (SVR) and biochemical (SBR) responses (table below) were associated with response. Histological disease was mild in the majority of patients at treatment end (78% stage 0 fibrosis and 72% grade 1 or less necroinflammatory activity). Conclusions: Preemptive antiviral therapy was applicable to -60% of transplanted patients. Biochemical responses were frequent but SVRs uncommon. Treatment discontinuation and lowering of RBV doses due to side effects likely reduced SVRs and may have limited our ability to detect differences between treatment groups. The only predictor of SVR was a negative qHCVRNA pre-treatment, which implies that patients with low VL early post-LT may be the best candidates for preemptive therapy. Compared to historical reports, the severity of histological disease was very mild at 1-year post-LT in the majority of treated patients, suggesting preemptive antiviral therapy may provide important histological benefits. The cadaveric organ shortage has led to the development of alternative strategies for organ transplantation. Living donor liver transplant (LDLT) is one strategy that has offered many individuals transplantation before they die or become too sick for transplant.Chronic hepatitis C (HCV) is the leading indication for liver transplantation. Preliminary results from small single center studies suggest that recurrent HCV is more common after LDLT compared to cadaveric transplant with concern that graft survival may be lower after LDLT. &: To compare patient and graft survival in HCV recipients who undergo LDLT to cadaveric liver transplant recipients. Methods: We analyzed the United Network for Organ Sharing (UNOS) liver transplant database from January, 1999 -December, 2002. Inclusion criteria included liver transplant recipients 218 years old transplanted from 1999-2002 with the transplant diagnosis of chronic hepatitis C. Exclusion criteria included subjects who were hepatitis B surface antigen positive, history of prior organ transplant, concurrent kidney or heart transplant. The logrank test was used to compare survival between the two groups. Results: From 1999-2002 6.6% of adult liver transplants were LDLT. 279 LDLT recipients and 3,955 cadaveric recipients transplanted for end stage liver disease from HCV were identified. The results are shown in the Table: LDLT ( A greater proportion of LDLT recipients were female and LDLT recipients were less ill at the time of transplant.1 and 3 year patient and graft survival were not significantly different between the 2 groups, (p=O.11). If only the pre-MELD era is considered (01l99 thru 2/02) 1 year graft survival for LDLT (n=240) and CLT (n=3322) are 78% and 83%, respectively, p=O.lO. Conclusions: Our analysis demonstrates that short-term patient and graft survival are equivalent in LDLT and cadaveric recipients with HCV suggesting recurrent hepatitis C does not adversely affect survival over this time period. LDLT recipients are less ill at transplantation which did not confer a short-term survival advantage. Continued follow-up should determine the impact of less advanced liver disease at the time of transplant and recurrent hepatitis C after transplant on long-term graft and patient survival in LDLT recipients. Disclosures: Introduction: Histologic injury due to recurrent HCV has been reported in up to 90% of HCV infected patients who undergo liver transplantation with a cadaveric graft. However, the natural history of HCV following living donor liver transplantation (LDLT) is not as well described. Anecdotal evidence suggests that HCV recurrence may be more severe in LDLT recipients. We hypothesize that post-operative liver regeneration in the partial graft procured from living donors may facilitate HCV replication, or increase the vulnerability of hepatocytes to infection. Methods: We performed a retrospective analysis comparing outcomes, and the incidence, timing, and severity of histologic recurrence of HCV following transplantation in patients who underwent living donor liver transplant compared to recipients of cadaveric organs. Between 12/98 and 3/02,68 HCV infected adult patients (age > 18 years old) underwent liver transplantation for HCV associated cirrhosis. 45 patients received a cadaveric graft (CAD) and 23 received a graft from a living donor (LDLT). Mean time of patient follow up was 25 months, with a range of 6 to 39 months. Elevated serum transaminases, positive HCV RNA, and liver biopsy consistent with histologic evidence of HCV defined recurrence. Cholestatic Hepatitis C (CHC) was confirmed if all of the following criteria were met: serum total bilirubin greater than lOmg/dl with no evidence of extra-hepatic biliary obstruction on ultrasound and cholangiography, and histologic features on liver biopsy consisting of portal expansion, ductular proliferation, and bile stasis with or without hepatocyte ballooning. Immunosuppression, definition and treatment of rejection were standardized for both CAD and LDLT. Results: When comparing CAD to LDLT, both the incidence of HCV recurrence and time to recurrence were not different. The overall incidence of \"severe\" sequelae of HCV recurrence, either cholestatic hepatitis, grade 111-IV inflammation, and/or HCV induced graft failure requiring re-transplantation was also not different when comparing CAD to LDLT. However, when comparing CAD versus LDLT, no CAD patient developed cholestatic hepatitis C, compared to 17% of LDLT who developed this complication (p = 0.001). Conclusions: In this patient population, the timing and OVERALL incidence of HCV recurrence were not different when comparing CAD versus LDLT, but the incidence of cholestatic hepatitis was significantly greater in patients with HCV who underwent LDLT. Further multicenter studies are warranted to determine the incidence and risk factors for cholestatic hepatitis C following liver transplantation. UCSF, Sun Francisco, CA; Fabien Zoulim, INSERM, Lyon, France; Carol L Brosgart, Michael Wulfsohn, Michael D Miller, Shelly Xiong, Gilead Sciences, Inc., Foster City, CA Background Lamivudine (LAM) resistance occurs in approximately 40% of chronic hepatitis B (CHB) patients after 2 years of LAM monotherapy. In contrast, resistance to adefovir dipivoxil (ADV) occurs infrequently with 1.6% of CHB patients developing the adefovir resistance mutation rtN236T after 2 years of ADV therapy. Pre-existing LAM resistance mutations or concurrent use of immunosuppressive therapy by LT patients may increase the risk of resistance to ADV. Objective: To determine the incidence of ADV resistance in a clinical trial of liver transplantation (pre and post) patients with LAM-resistant HBV treated with ADV for 96 weeks (LAM therapy was maintained in most patients). Methods: The HBV reverse transcriptase domain was sequenced for LT patients with detectable HBV DNA by PCR (>lo00 copieslml) after 96 weeks of ADV therapy (n=114). In vih-o drug susceptibility was determined following transfection of HepG2 cells with patient-derived HBV clones from baseline and week 96 serum samples. Results: The rtN236T mutation wa!j observed in 21114 patients (1.8%) at week 96. LAM had been discontinued at weeks 16 and 28 after initiation of ADV in these two patients respectively. The baseline LAM-resistant YMDD mutation reverted to wildtype prior to week 96 in both patients. Emergence of rtN236T was associated with rebound in serum HBV DNA and ALT elevation in both patients. In vitro phenotypic analysis showed approximately 4-fold reduced susceptibility to adefovir with rtN236T. However, these adefovir-resistant HBV clones were fully susceptible to LAM and entecavir in vitro. LAM therapy was re-initiated, in addition to the ongoing ADV therapy, after emergence of rtN236T in these patients resulting in a > 2.9 loglo copies1mL reduction in serum HBV DNA in both patients. One patient also had a significant reduction (>80%) in ALT within 5 months of LAM treatment. No other mutations potentially associated with adefovir resistance were detected. Conclusions: Emergence of the adefovir resistance mutation rtN236T was observed infrequently after 2 years in liver transplantation patients (1.8%, 2/114) infected with LAM-resistant HBV, similar to observations in treatment naYve non-liver transplantation patients. The ADV-resistant HBV was sensitive to LAM and addition of LAM resulted in clinical stabiliation in both patients. Local liver immune responses are thought to play a major role in chronic autoimmune diseases directed at biliary epithelium.Using the apical sodium dependent bile acid transporter (ASBT) promoter to drive biliary epithelial cell -specific expression of a membrane form of ovalbumin (OVA), we have previously developed OVA-BIL transgenic mice. Because these mice are tolerant to OVA, we use OVA-specific T cells from OT-1 and OT-I1 transgenic mice, restricted by MHC class I and class 11, respectively, with well defined peptide epitopes specific for OVA to induce biliary damage in a dose dependent manner. AIM: 1) To determine the liver mononuclear cell populations (MNC) involved in necroinflammatory disease, and 2) to determine where adoptively transferred cells home and proliferate. METHODS: 10 million OT-I and 2 million OT-I1 naYve T cells were adoptively transferred to OVA-BIL mice by intraperitoneal injection. At days 0, 5, and 7, liver MNC were isolated by collagenase digestion, purified by discontinuous Percoll gradient centrifugation, and analyzed by flow cytometry. Tail bleeds were performed at days 0, 3, 5, and 7 to follow serum ALT. In a subset of experiments, OT-1 cells were labeled with carboxyfluorescein diacetate succinimidyl ester (CFSE) and analyzed on day 3 and 5 by flow cytometry after adoptive transfer with unlabeled OT-I1 T cells into OVA-BIL mice. RESULTS: OVA-BIL mice develop normally without evidence of disease up to 2 years. After adoptive transfer of OVA-specific T cells, there was a marked increase in serum ALT. CD8+ OT-I T cells were required for liver damage and OVA-specific CD4+ T cells markedly augmented this inflammation. Adoptive transfer of OT-I1 CD4 T cells alone did not induce liver injury. There was extensive portal inflammation in every portal triad, centered around the bile ducts with infiltrating lymphocytes in the bile duct epithelia, apoptotic cells, loss of biliary epithelial cells as well as interface hepatitis. Liver MNC were abundant in OVA-BIL mice and increased after adoptive transfer of OVA-specific T cells. Serum ALT peaked at day 5 (mean 263 IUlml), coincident with liver MNC peak. CFSE labeling studies revealed robust homing of adoptively transferred OT-I CD8 cells to the liver, but not to the spleen, of OVA-BIL mice. The OVA-specific CD8 cells, but not CD4, NK1.l, or CD19 cells, underwent cell division. CONCLU-SION: Recognition of biliary epithelial antigen in OVA-BIL mice induces a necroinflammatory response in the liver as assessed by serum ALT, liver MNC numbers and immunohistochemistry. The magnitude of this response correlates with influx of nahe OVAspecific cytotoxic T cells, which are activated and divide in the liver but not in the spleen. T cell recognition of antigen expressed on bile duct epithelium occurs rapidly, causes biliary specific inflammation with interface hepatitis, which may be a model of autoimmune bile duct injury or cholangiopathy. The etiology of autoimmune hepatitis (AIH) is only poorly understood although the major autoantigens, such as cytochrome P450 2D6 (CYP2D6), could be identified and immunodominant epitopes have been mapped. One major reason for this lack of comprehension is the fact that there are currently only few valid animal models for AIH and none of them involves the autoantigen targeted in humans. Thus, we generated an animal model for human AIH using a natural autoantigen (CYP2D6). Self-tolerance in transgenic mice that express human CYP2D6 in the liver was challenged by infecting these CYP2D6-mice with an Adenovirus-CYP2D6 vector (Ad-2D6) in order to deliver large amounts of the critical antigen to the liver and to provide a inflammatory environment that would favour autoimmunity. Infection with an empty Adenovirus vector resulted in a transient form of focal necrosis 4 days after infection that subsequently disappeared after 2 weeks. In contrast, infection with Ad-2D6 resulted in extended and persistent infiltration of CD4, CD8 lymphocytes as well as macrophages resulting in confluentlbridging necrosis at week 10 post-infection. In addition, the overall morphology of the liver was massively disturbed after Ad-2D6 infection. At week 10 postinfection, the liver was approximately half the size of the control and its lobules were fused together and rounded up. First indications of fibrosis and hyperplasic nodules become apparent. The overall architecture of the liver was disrupted I disorganized and the liver parenchyma was partially collapsed. Furthermore, theliver of Ad-2D6 infected mice was surrounded by multiple layers of connective tissue as seen in some stages of liver cirrhosis. Additional signs of cirrhosis started to become apparent in the form of nodules that are entrapped in fibrous tissue. In addition, accumulation of infiltrating cells are visible directly under the liver capsule. These observations indicate that the CYP2D6-mouse displays a persistent form of hepatitis after infection with Ad-2D6 that may form the basis for a novel model system which would allow to study mechanisms involved in the initiation, propagation and precipitation of autoimmune processes involved in human autoimmune hepatitis.

            "text": "Herkel, Peter R Galle, Edgar Schmitt, Ansgar W Lohse, Johannes Gutenberg University, Mainz, Germany Background: In clinical hepatitis, hepatocytes express MHC class I1 molecules; we recently reported that MHC I1 expressing hepatocytes can function as antigen presenting cells that stimulate specific CD4 T cells (Hepatology 2003; 37: 1079-85) . To understand the relevance of hepatocellular antigen presentation for hepatic immunity, we now examined whether hepatocytes may induce the differentiation of primary CD4 T cells. Because inflammatory CD4 T cells in the liver are most likely primed by dendritic cells of the draining lymph nodes, we also examined whether hepatocytes may also re-differentiate dendritic cell-primed CD4 T cells. Methods: Primary CD4 T cells from Ovalbumin-specific T cell receptor-transgenic mice were stimulated by antigen presenting hepatocytes from hepatocyte-specific CIITA-transgenic mice or splenic dendritic cells.The response type was determined by measuring secreted interferon-gamma (IFN) and interleukin-4 (IL-4). Results: We found that antigen presenting hepatocytes by default induced differentiation of primary CD4 T cells to TH2 cells (IFN: 200 Ulml; 1L-4: 1800 Ulml). In contrast, primary CD4 T cells stimulated by dendritic cells differentiated to Thl effector cells (IFN: 2400 Ulml; 1L-4 20 Ulml). However, these dendritic cellprimed Thl type cells, when re-stimulated by hepatocytes, had a decreased capacity to produce IFN (580 Ulml vs. 2800 Ulml after dentritic cell stimulation); and after repeated re-stimulation by hepatocytes, the dendritic-cell primed T cells even differentiated into Th2 cells (IFN: 112 Ulml; IL-4: 1270 Ulml). Conclusions: These data show that antigen presenting hepatocytes induce Th2 differentiation of undifferentiated CD4 T cells. Most notably, even dendritic cell-primed CD4 T cells that are committed to Thl differentiation could be reverted by hepatocytes to Th2 type. Thus, hepatocytes seem to have an extraordinary capacity to promote antiinflammatory hepatic immune responses. It is therefore conceivable that antigen presentation by hepatocytes associated with clinical hepatitis, in the absence of pro-inflammatory stimuli, seems to downregulate inflammatory infiltrating T cells. Background NKT cells are a unique subset of regulatory lymphocytes with important immune modulatory effects. These cells recognize exogenous glycolipids anchored by a ceramide tail to the MHC-like CDld molecule, expressed by various antigen presenting cells. Glycosylceramides, including the marine sponge-derived a-galactosylceramide can activate NKT cells, leading to exacerbation of hepatitis. Concanavalin A induces immune mediated hepatitis in which NKT cells are key participants. Glucocerebroside (GC) is a naturally occurring glycolipid. Aims: To determine the immune modulatory effect of GC in a murine model of Con A hepatitis. Methods: Five groups of BalblC mice were studied Group A and B mice were treated with GC (1.0 pg IP) two hours prior to and two hours following administration of 500 pg Con A, respectively; group C mice were treated with Con A alone; group D mice were treated with GC alone; group E mice did not receive any treatment. The degree of liver damage was evaluated by serum aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels, and by liver histology. The immunmodulatory effect of GC was determined by FACS analysis of intrahepatic and intrasplenic lymphocytes for NKT markers, and by ELISA measurements of serum IFNy, IL2, IL4, IL10, and IL12. The effect of GC on NKT lymphocyte proliferation was assessed in vitro. Results: Treatment with GC markedly reduced serum AST and ALT levels in group A compared to group C (143 vs. 600 IU in group A and group C, respectively, for AST; 57 vs. 801 IU in group A and group C, respectively, for ALT, p<0.05). Administration of GC alone did not change AST or ALT levels compared to naive controls. Histological sections of livers from group A mice revealed markedly attenuated damage compared to sections from group C livers, in which massive hepatocyte necrosis was present. The beneficial effect of GC on immune mediated hepatitis was associated with a 20% decrease in the intrahepatic NKT lymphocyte number, and with significant lowering of serum IFNy levels (3725 vs. 5620 pglml in groups A and C, respectively, p<0.05); administration of GC alone led to increased serum IL-12 levels (573 pglml vs. 92 pglml in group D vs. group E, respectively, p<0.05). In vitro, administration of GC decreased NKT cell pro-liferation by 42% in the presence of dendritic cells, but not in their absence. Conclusions: Administration of GC led to significant amelioration of Con A hepatitis that was associated with a dendritic cell-dependent decrease of NKT cell proliferation in vitro, and with decreased intrahepatic NKT lymphocytes and serum IFNy levels in vivo. These results suggest that the effect of GC may be mediated by inhibition of intrahepatic NKT cells, resulting from competitive displacement of activating elements from the CDld molecule on antigen presenting cells. Glucocerebroside, a naturally occurring glycolipid, holds promise as a new immunomodulatory agent, with a possible role in treatment of autoimmune hepatitis and other immune-mediated liver disorders. Disclosures: Background CD4+ cells constitutively expressing CD25 have a regulatory function, their experimental removal leading to spontaneous autoimmune disease in normal rodents. CD4+CD25+ regulatory T cells suppress both TH1 and TH2 responses, competing with effector CD4+ cells in recognizing the same peptide antigens. Their ability of expansion is key to the maintenance of tolerance. Autoimmune hepatitis type 2 (AIH-2) is characterized by T cell immune responses against 6 well-defined regions on cytochrome P4502D6, the autoantigen of AIH-2. Aims: To investigate the ability of expansion of CD4+CD25+ after exposure to non-antigen-specific and CYPZD6-specific stimuli in AIH-2. Methods: CD4+CD25+ T cells were analysed by triple colour flow-cytometry of freshlcryopreserved peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) befare and after culture in the presence of a T cell expander capable of maintaining the original T cell function (CD3KD28 Dynabeads T cell expander, Dynal Biotech, Norway) and of 28 synthetic CYP2D6 peptides (10 pMol), spanning the 6 antigenic regions known to induce proliferative CD4+ responses in AIH-2. Patients and controls: Nine patients with AIH-2 (7 female, median age 11.4 yrs, range 2.5 to 21 yrs) were investigated, 3 at diagnosis and 6 while on sustained remission. Nine healthy laboratory workers served as normal controls. Results: Before stimulation, the level of CD4+CD25+ T cells was significantly lower in AIH-2 patients (3.59 2 1.08) than in normal controls (6.39 f 0.87; p=O.O2), a difference present both at diagnosis (2.24 ? 0.56, p<0.005) and during remission (4.25 2 0.35, p=O.Ol). Following exposure to the T cell expander, the level of CD4+CD25+ T cells increased 4.5 times (28.6 2 30.8) in normal controls, but only 1.85 times in AM-2 patients (6.62 ? 1.85, p=O.Ol). Upon exposure to cyMD6 peptides, CD4+CD25+ T cells remained numerically unchanged, in contrast to the PBMCs from the same patients giving a strong proliferative response (up to 6.9 times). Summary & Conclusion: Our data show a numerical and functional impairment of regulatory T cells in AM-2. This defect is likely to be key to the initiation and perpetuation of the autoaggressive process in this condition. Orth, Mark A McNiven, Nicholas F LaRusso, Mayo Medical School, Clinic and Foundation, Rochester, MN Cryptosporidium parvum (CP) opportunistically infects intestinal and biliary epithelia causing worldwide morbidity, especially in patients with AIDS. Epithelial invasion by CP involves host cell membrane alterations resulting in a parasitophorous vacuole that envelops the parasite and a dense-band within the host cell underlying the attachment site; both processes require host cell actin remodeling. Since recent studies in other systems have demonstrated that Cdc42, an actin-associated GTP-binding protein, plays a central role in microbial-induced actin remodeling, we tested the HYPOTHESIS that CP activates host cell Cdc42 and its downstream effectors to induce actin rearrangement and microbial invasion. METHODS: We exposed cholangiocytes derived from normal human liver and immortalized by SV40 transformation to freshly excysted CP sporozoites and applied molecular and morphofogical approaches to test our hypothesis. RESULTS By immunofluorescent and immunoelectron microscopy, we found accumulation of Cdc42 in cholangiocytes at the parasite-host cell interface during CP invasion. We confirmed activation of Cdc42 in infected cholangiocytes by immunoprecipitation using an antibody to PAK4, a downstream effector molecule that binds exclusively to the activated form of Cdc42. Phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI-3K), a membrane-associated kinase associated with Cdc42 activation, was also recruited to the site of attachment, as were N-WASP, PAK4 and p34-Arc, downstream effectors of Cdc42. Inhibition of PI-3K by wortmannin or LY294002 blocked CP-induced Cdc42 accumulation. While overexpression in cholangiocytes of a constitutively active mutant of Cdc42 promoted CP invasion (up to 50%), overexpression of function-deficient mutants of PI-3K, Cdc42 or of the WA fragment of N-WASP inhibited CP invasion by 60 -80 %. Moreover, inhibition of host cell Cdc42 activation by dominant negative mutation inhibited CP-induced actin accumulation, and parasitophorous vacuole and dense-band formation at the attachment site. CONCLUSIONS: These combined data suggest that CP invasion of cholangiocytes (and perhaps other target epithelia) results from the organism's ability to activate a complex host cell Cdc42 signaling pathway that induces host cell actin remodeling at the attachment site. BACKGROUND: Hepatitis B (HBV) and Hepatitis C (HCV) infections are a world-wide health concern. Studies of these infections have been hampered by a lack of a convenient animal model. We previously have shown that immunocompetent rats tolerized and transplanted with human hepatocytes can support HBV infection for at least 15 weeks. AIM: To demonstrate that the immunocompetent rat which has been tolerized and transplanted with human hepatocytes can be used to sustain and study HCV infection. METHODS: Sprague-Dawley rats were injected in utero at 16-17 days gestation with one hundred thousand Huh 7 cells (human hepatocyte cell line) to tolerized them to human hepatocytes. One week after birth, the tolerized newborns were intrasplenically transplanted with 5 million Huh 7 cells. One week after transplantation, rodents were inoculated with one hundred thousand HCV RNA copies, genotype l b human serum. Animals were sacrificed at 6 and 12 weeks. The presence of human cells was determined by immunofluorescent staining of cryosectioned liver tissue using antibodies to human albumin. PCR and RT-PCR was used to confirm the presence of human albumin in liver tissue. The presence of HCV was assayed using an antibody to NS5A viral protein, and visualized using a rhodamine labeled secondary antibody. HCV infection in the liver was confirmed by the presence of negative strand RNA using nested PCR. RESULTS: Functional Huh7 cells in the chimeric livers were confirmed by the presence of human albumin mRNA and DNA using RT-PCR and PCR. The presence of human albumin protein in the liver was further demonstrated by immunofluorescence of human albumin in frozen liver sections. Eighty-one percent (n=57) of the tolerized, Huh 7 transplanted rodents were positive for human albumin in the livers. Seventy-two percent (n=36) of the chimeric animals infected with HCV were positive for the presence of NS5A HCV protein from immunofluorescence studies. Livers of control rats that were only tolerized and control rats that were tolerized and transplanted with Huh7 cells, but not inoculated with HCV were negative for NS5A (n=12). HCV viral replication could be demonstrated in livers of tolerized, transplanted and HCV infected rats by the presence of HCV RNA bands of the correct size from nested PCR using negative strand specific primers. CONCLUSION Immunocompetent rats tolerized and transplanted with human hepatocytes can be a useful laboratory model to study HCV infection. ( We have previously observed that allogeneic hepatocellular transplants are highly immunogenic and are resistant to immunosuppressive therapy with a variety of agents. Donor specific transfusion in combination with anti-CD40L mAb is highly effective in inducing prolonged survival of skin and myoblasts and inducing indefinite and donor-specific tolerance to heart and islet allografts. The proposed mechanism of action for DST and anti-CD40L mAb suggests peripheral deletion of alloreactive CD8+ T cells and induction of a regulatory CD4+ T cell population. Resistance to induction of indefinite acceptance has been attributed to peripheral reappearance of alloreactive CD8+ T cells. In preliminary studies, we observed that DST and anti-CD40L mAb prolonged FVBlN hepatocyte (HC) survival in C57E3L/6 mice to median survival time (MST) of 88 days and induced indefinite acceptance (>90 days) in 43% of mice. HC rejection occurs by CD4-dependent and (CD4-independent) CD8-dependent pathways. This model permits evaluation on these two pathways separately. The current studies address the hypothesis that DST and anti-CD40L mAb induces prolonged HC allograft acceptance by inducing immunoregulation of both alloreactive CD4+ and CD8+ T cells. Methods: FVBlN (hAlAT-FVBIN, H-24) HCs were transplanted into CD4 KO, CD8 KO, and C57BL/6 (all H-2b) mice. Hc survival was monitored by detection of reporter hAlAT protein in serum by ELISA. For comparison, donor-matched islets were transplanted into streptozotocin-induced diabetic CD8 KO (H-2b) mice, and survival was monitored by blood glucose. Recipient mice received peritransplant administration of DST ( 1 0~1 0~ FVBlN splenocytes, day -7) and anti-CD4OL mAb (1.0 mg, ip, d-7, -4, 0, 4) . Some CD8 KO hosts were reconstituted CD8+ T cells (2x107 iv, d-10). Results: When the CD8-dependent rejection was studied in isolation (CD4 KO mice), DST and anti-CD4OL mAb prolonged HC survival to MST of 35 days (N=4) compared to 10 days in untreated CD4 KO (N=7); however, this was not significantly different from anti-CD40L mAb alone. When CD4-dependent rejection was studied in isolation (CD8 KO mice), HCs were unexpectedly rejected with MST of 7 days (N=8) despite DST and anti-CD40L mAb treatment. In contrast, islets of the same strain were accepted indefinitely in CD8 KO mice (N=5, MST>70 days). Since this siraiegy effectively controlled HC rejection in C57BL16 mice which have both CD4-and CD8-dependent pathways available, the collective results suggested that perhaps host CD8+ T cells were necessary for the beneficial effects of the DST and anti-CD40L mAb. To determine whether CD8+ T cells were required for induction of longterm HC survival with DST and anti-CD40L mAb, CD8 KO HC recipients were reconstituted with CD8+ T cells prior to DST and anti-CD4OL mAb treatment. CD8reconstituted CD8 KOs accepted HCs for MST of 56 days. Conclusion: The effects of DST and anti-CD40L mAb on combined CD4-and CD8-initated HC rejection are more pronounced than on either pathway alone. CD8+ T cells appear to be required for induction of longterm HC survival under cover DST and anti-CD40L mAb, which offers an apparently distinct mechanism compared to the existing paradigm for the mechanism of action of DST and anti-CD40L mAb.

            "text": "Engraftment of transplanted cells in the liver is affected by cellcell interactions involving hepatic endothelial cells and Kupffer cells. The proximity of transplanted cells to HSC suggested that HSC could promote cell adhesion and extracellular matrix remodeling during cell engraftment. To investigate cell-cell interactions in the liver, we analyzed HSC activation in DPPN-rats transplanted intrasplenically with F344 hepatocytes. Analysis of tissues by immunostaining from animals 6h, 24h, 3d and 7d after cell transplantation showed appearance of desmin +ve HSC in periportal areas, reaching a peak on day 3 (4-10 fold increase in desmin f v e HSC in cell recipients, p<O.OOl). Using combined immunostaining and DPPIV histochemistry, desmin +ve HSC were often observed in the immediate vicinity of transplanted cells. However, a-smooth muscle actin (SMA) was not expressed in HSC perturbed by cell transplantation, whereas CCl&reatment in control animals induced SMA expression in HSC, as shown by tissue immunostaining, as well as western blots of tissue extracts. After cell transplantation, perturbed HSC expressed desmin extensively, especially in areas with cell transplantation-induced ischemia and consequential GGT expression. To examine whether desmin +ve HSC were perturbed following activation of Kupffer cells by cell transplantation, we administered carbon particles to hepatocyte recipients intrasplenically. These studies established that the majority (up to 72%) of desmin +ve HSC were located directly adjacent to carbon containing activated Kupffer cells. As Kupffer cells are activated within 6 hrs after cell transplantation, whereas HSC were perturbed maximally at a later time, we reasoned that these cell-cell interactions were likely mediated by soluble factors. To demonstrate whether TNF-alpha plays a role in the stellate cell activation process, we transplanted hepatocytes into animals treated with the TNF-alpha-blocker etanercept. However, etanercept did not prevent perturbation of HSC, suggesting that factors other than TNF-alpha must be involved. To eliminate the component of ischemia-mediated cell activations, we treated animals with intrasplenic nitroglycerine infusion before and during cell transplantation, which resulted in marked attenuation of hepatic GGT expression. Interestingly, desmin +ve HSC were now distributed throughout the entire liver lobule, with 3-5 fold greater prevalence, compared to rats treated with cells alone without nitroglycerine, p<O.OOl, suggesting that circulating soluble factors reached HSC more effectively. In contrast, treatment of animals with nitroglycerine alone did not perturb HSC.",

Nitroglycerine pretreatment resulted in superior parenchymal integration of transplanted cells, in proximity with desmin +ve HSC. Conclusions: Transplantation of cells in liver sinusoids activates desmin, but not SMA, expression in HSC. Activated Kupffer cells are likely mediators of HSC perturbation. Improved cell engraftment following perturbation of HSC indicates that extracellular matrix remodeling could facilitate this process. These findings offer ways to further optimize liver repopulation with transplanted cells. Knudsen, Timothy B Hummer, Kim A Buffers, Kiyoshi Ogata, Cody A Koch, Jefiey L Platt, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, M N Background Hepatocyte transplantation has been of much interest as a biological liver support. How to treat hepatocytes to achieve optimum function has been uncertain. Cultured, cryopreserved and hypothermically preserved hepatocytes have been employed for clinical hepatocyte transplantation, but the efficacy was rarely compared between those cell sources. Using a xenogeneic hepatocyte transplantation model, the function of transplanted hepatocytes was quantified in vivo. Methods: Porcine hepatocytes were isolated by a two-step collagenase technique. The hepatocytes were: (1) immediately used; (2) kept in UW solution at 4\u00b0C; (3) cultured in supplemented Williams E medium; or (4) cryopreserved in LJW solution with 10% DMSO before use. The viability of hepatocytes was determined by trypan blue exclusion, and 1 x lo6 viable hepatocytes were injected into the spleens of Rag-2-defficient mice. To evaluate the function of transplanted hepatocytes, the porcine albumin level in the recipient plasma was determined by a sandwich ELISA. The number of surviving porcine cells in the recipients' spleen was estimated by a quantification of porcine genomic DNA sequences. Results: The viability of hepatocytes was as follows: freshly isolated hepatocytes, 92.2 2 1.9%; 24 hours, 48 hours, and 72 hours at 4\"C, 85.8 t 3.1, 74.3 i 1.9, 71.0 i 3.2%; cryopreserved hepatocytes after thaw, 65.0 2 2.6%; cultured hepatocytes after dissociation, 78.4 t 6.3% (means t SE). After transplanting comparable numbers of viable hepatocytes, the porcine albumin concentration was found to be lower in recipients of hypothermically-stored (Group 2) and cultured hepatocytes (group 3) than recipients of fresh hepatocytes (Group 1). Cryopreserved hepatocytes (group 4) failed to secrete any albumin. Because the half-life of porcine albumin in Rag-2deficient mice was 13.5 hours, the porcine albumin concentration in the recipient plasma reflected real-time albumin secretion from the transplanted hepatocytes. The porcine genomic DNA in the recipient spleen was quantified 4 weeks after transplantation. Fewer cells were found in the hypothermically preserved hepatocyte-recipients (group 2). Therefore, the lower level of the porcine albumin secretion in the group 2 was mainly attributable to the failure of the transplanted hepatocytes to survive. The amount of porcine genomic DNA was comparable between cultured hepatocyte-recipients and freshly isolated hepatocyte-recipients, although the plasma of cultured hepatocyte-recipients included less porcine albumin. It suggested that the hepatocytes had dedifferentiated during culture and secreted less albumin thereafter in vivo. The cultured hepatocytes did not seem to differentiate again in murine spleen. Conclusions: Both the survival and differentiation of hepatocytes were important to maintenance of good function in vivo. The hypothermically preserved and cryopreserved hepatocytes did not survive long after transplantation contrary to their good viable look. Cultured hepatocytes showed relatively good survival, although their dedifferentiation was not reversible resulting in poor outcome. Freshly isolated hepatocytes are recommended for cell transplantation. Medicine, Ube-Yamaguchi, Japan; Hiroshi Nishina, University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan; Kiwamu Okita, Yamaguchi University School of Medicine, Ube-Yamaguchi, Japan Obiective; We had developed an in vivo model to monitor the trans-differentiation and proliferation of BMCs into functional hepatocytes via hepatoblast phenotype (GFPICC14 model). In this model, transplanted GFP-positive BMCs via tail vein efficiently migrated to the peri-portal area of liver lobules under CC14induced chronic liver damage condition. Transplanted BMCs gradually proliferated and spread from the peri-portal area (zone 1) into the central area (zone 2). Under persistent liver damage condition, BMCs trans-differentiated into functional hepatocytes. Previous analysis had shown that inflammatory signals had been important for the trans-differentiatin of BMCs. In this study, we focused on growth factors and analyzed which affected the transdifferentiation and proliferation of BMCs into hepatocytes in GFPl CC14 model. Materials and methods; Immunohistochemical staining and immunofluorescent double staining with antibody of GFP, several growth factors and their receptors were performed in GFPICCl4 model. Hepatocyte growth factor (HGF), epidermal growth factor (EGF), fibroblast growth factor (FGF), vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF), and transforming growth factor (TGF) were analyzed. The percentage of stained area was quantified in the sections at thirty random fields (n=6 in each group), and statistical analysis was performed using PLSD test (ANOVA). Results; The most significant result was shown in fibroblast growth factors (FGFI, FGF2) and their receptors (Flg, Bek). In immunohistochemical staining, the stained region migrated and increased from zone1 into zone2 of liver lobules with the time after BMT. In immunofluorescent double staining, co-expressions both GFP and FGFs, FGF-receptors were detected at the same distribution. The percentage of stained area of FGFs and FGFreceptors gradually increased with significant difference (The data was shown in Table 1 ). Although expressions of other growth factors and their receptors were detected, the significant differences were not shown. Conclusions; FGFs are the most important growth factor to transdifferentiate and proliferate BMCs into hepatocytes. Cholangiocytes are the target cells of chronic cholestatic liver diseases (i.e., cholangiopathies), characterized by the dysregulation of the balance between apoptosis and proliferation that leads to changes in ductal bile secretion. In rats with bile duct ligation (BDL), there is increased cholangiocyte proliferation and enhanced basal and secretin-stimulated ductal secretion. We have shown that both cholinergic (by vagotomy) and adrenergic b y administration of a single intraportal injection of 6-hydroxydopamine (60HDA)I denervation impairs the proliferative and secretory responses of intrahepatic bile ducts to BDL through an increase in cholangiocyte apoptosis. We have shown that bile acids and nerves co-ordinately regulate the balance between cholangiocyte apoptosislproliieration in hyperplastic rat livers. In BDL rats, while ursodeoxycholate and tauroursodeoxycholate feeding prevents the loss of bile ducts caused by vagotomy in a CaZ+/PKC-dependent manner, taurocholate feeding prevents vagotomy-induced duct damage in a PI3K dependent manner. No information exists regarding the interaction between bile acids and adrenergic innervation in the regulation of cholangiocyte function. Thus, we tested the hypothesis that taurocholate feeding protects from bile duct damage induced by adrenergic denervation by 6-OHDA. Methods: Immediately after BDL, rats received a single intraportal injection of 6-OHDA (which induces degeneration of adrenergic terminal fibers, 50 mglKglbody weight) or vehicle, and subsequently were fed 1% taurocholate or control diet in the presence of daily injections of wortmannin (a PI3K inhibitor, 0.7 mgl kg body weight) or a control solution. We used 1 week BDL rats as control animals. Seven days later, we evaluated cholangiocyte apoptosis by : (i) TUNEL assay in liver sections; and (ii) measurement of caspase 3 activity and protein expression for cleaved pro-caspase 3, and the number of purified cholangiocytes positive for annexin-V. Cholangiocyte proliferation was evaluated by measurement of the number of PCNA-and CK-19-positive cholangiocytes in liver sections, and PCNA immunoblots in pure isolated cholangiocytes. The changes in ductal functional activity were evaluated by measurement of (i) secretinstimulated cAMP levels and Cl-IHCOS exchanger activity in pure cholangiocytes; and (ii) secretin-stimulated bile flow and bicarbonate secretion in bile fistula rats. Results: Taurocholate feeding prevented the increase in the number of apoptotic cholangiocytes and the enhancement of caspase 3 activity and protein expression for cleaved pro-caspase 3 induced by 6-OHDA. Taurocholate feeding prevented 6-OHDA-induced decrease in the number of PCNA-and CK-19 positive cholangiocytes, and the loss of PCNA protein expression. At the functional level, taurocholate feeding prevented the decrease in secretin-stimulated cAMP levels, C1-l HCO3 exchanger activity and bile and bicarbonate secretion. Consistent with the concept that PI3K regulates the interaction of bile acids with adrenergic nerves in cholangiocytes, we found that administration of wortmannin blocks 6-OHDA-induced activation of cholangiocyte apoptosis, and inhibition of cholangiocyte proliferation and ductal secretion. Summarylconclusion: Taurocholate feeding prevents the increase in cholangiocyte apoptosis and the loss of cholangiocyte proliferation and ductal functional activity induced by adrenergic denervation by 6-OHDA. Taurocholate effects are mediated by the PI3K pathway, since the simultaneous administration of wortmannin reverses such effects. These novel findings suggest that bile acids play a major role in sustaining the growth and functional activity of the intrahepatic biliary tree following liver transplantation. Hepatocyte apoptosis by death receptors is emerging as a critical determinant in the initiation of hepatic inflammation and fibrosis during cholestatic liver diseases. However, the cellular sources of death ligands to activate the death receptors is unknown. We postulated that Kupffer cells, which contribute to hepatic inflammation, may also contribute to hepatocyte apoptosis and liver fibrosis by generating death ligands. Thus, our AIM was to ascertain whether Kupffer cells express death ligands and contribute to hepatocyte apoptosis and liver fibrosis in the bile duct ligated mouse, an animal model of cholestasis. METHODS: Mice were subjected to bile duct ligation (BDL) or a sham operation and treated with gadolinium chloride, a Kupffer cell intoxicant, or saline for three days. Hepatocyte apoptosis in liver sections was assessed using the TUNEL assay. Serum ALT values were quantitated using commercially available kits. Kupffer cells were isolated using arabinogalactan gradient centrifugation. Real time PCR was used to measure expression of death ligands and fibrosis indicators. RESULTS: Hepatocyte TUNEL positive cells, and serum ALT values were 3.3-fold, and 5.2-fold, respectively, greater in 3 day-(BDL) saline-treated vs. gadolinium chloride-treated mice. Kupffer cell expression of the death ligands TNF-alpha and Fas ligand was 14 and 20-fold greater when Kupffer cells were obtained from BDL vs. sham operated mice. The enhanced expression of Fas ligand was verified by immunoblot analysis and TNF-alpha by an ELISA. These data confirm that Kupffer cells generate death ligands and contribute to hepatocyte apoptosis in cholestatic liver injury. Consistent with a role for Kupffer cellassociated hepatocyte apoptosis in liver inflammation, neutrophil infiltration into the BDL liver was abrogated by gadolinium chloride. Hepatic mRNA transcripts for a -smooth muscle actin, and collagen a 1(I), markers for stellate activation were all significantly attenuated gadolinium chloride vs. vehicle-treated animals. Finally, the mechanisms for Kupffer cell activation were explored in cell culture. Isolated Kupffer cells phagocytosed apoptotic bodies, which induced death ligand expression. In contrast, bile acids had no effect on Kupffer cell gene expression. infection is associated with vigorous, durable CD8+ T cell responses against nonstructural HCV proteins. HCV persistence has been attributed to poor priming of cellular immune responses.",

The principal characteristic of this vector is its ability to replicate in transfected cells which in turn enhances production, processing and presentation of the encoded HCV NS3 antigen. Moreover, the availability of cytopathic and noncytopathic forms of the same replicon enabled us to study the immunologic implications of DC apoptosis and antigen reprocessing, leading to crosspriming in vivo. Results: The murine dendritic cell lines DC2.4 was transfected with cytopathic and noncytopathic recombinant replicon RNA, respectively. HCV NS3 expression was detectable in more than 95% of the transfected cells by immunofluorescence. The time kinetics of apoptosis induction was monitored by flow cytometry using annexin V and propidium iodide staining. In contrast to the noncytopathic replicon, the cytopathic replicon led to DC apoptosis 12 hours after transfection. DC2.4 transfected with the cytopathic recombinant replicon RNA were then used to immunize HLA-A2 transgenic mice subcutaneously. IFN-positive, proliferative CD4+ T cells and IFN--y positive, cytotoxic CD8+ T cell responses were detectable after a single subcutaneous immunization with replicon-transfected dendritic cells and significantly stronger than after conventional, intramuscular DNA immunization, the previous gold standard. Crosspriming was demonstrated when T cells, primed by injection of H-2b+ DCs into the H-2b+ HLA-A2+ mice, were tested with HLA-A2+ antigen-presenting cells. Transfer of cellular material from the vaccine DCs to the endogenous APCs, a phenomenon that underlies crosspriming, was directly visualized in vivo when fragments of CSFE-labeled, injected H2b+ DCs were demonstrated in HLA-A2+ host cells in lymph nodes and spleens by flow cytometry and IF microscopy. Finally, the protective effect and the in vivo function of the induced HCV-specific T cells were evaluated in a surrorgate challenge model with recombinant, HCV NS3 encoding vaccinia virus. Whereas lo4 to lo7 pfu were detected in nonvaccinated control mice, no vaccinia virus was detected in mice vaccinated with replicon-transfected DCs, indicating complete protection. Summary and conclusion: These findings demonstrate and explain the immunologic potential of the proposed vaccination strategy. Moreover, they support the hypothesis that experimental forcing of exogenous antigens into the MHC class I pathway and subsequent promotion of cross-priming is particularly important to generate T cell responses against noncytopathic and tissue tropic viruses such as HCV.

            "text": "Introduction: Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection leads to chronic liver disease in about 85% of infected individuals while only a minority achieves spontaneous viral elimination in the initial phase of acute hepatitis C. Anti viral mechanisms clearing the infection in these patients, however, could contribute to the genera-tion of therapeutic or prophylactic vaccines. The strong association of a broad, HLA restricted, vigorous and long lived anti viral CD4+/ Th1 T-cell response with spontaneously resolving acute hepatitis C has been demonstarted in the past. Only few epitopes recognized by anti HCV specific CD4+ T cells that are associated with spontaneous viral clearance have been characterized so far. The aim of the present study was to identify and characterize HCV specific CD4+ T cell epitopes and their HLA restriction during acute self limited HCV infection andlor viral control. Methods: Proliferative CD4+ T cell responses (3H-thymidin incorporation) against viral proteins (HCV-NS3, -NS4) and against overlapping 20-mer pep-tides covering the entire NS3 and NS4 (aa 1027-1972) region were performed in 25 patients with acute self limited HCV infection and in two patients during temporary viral control (HCV RNA negative). Ten patients with chronic HCV infection served as control group. CD4+ T cell clones were generated by limit-ing dilution of HCV protein specific T cell lines. HCV specific CD4+ T cell clones were further characterized fine specificity was assessed by proliferation assay after stimulation with overlapping peptides of the corresponding protein region, then the minimal epitope was defined with N-and C-terminal truncated peptides for each epitope. HLA restriction was assessed by inhibition experi-ments (anti-DP, -DQ, -DR) and CD25+ expression in the presence of a panel of EBV blasts by flowcytometry. Results: We studied 25 patients with acute self limited HCV infection. All pa-tients displayed significant proliferative T cell responses against HCV-NS3 or -NS4 protein, that was strongly associated with self-limited disease and absence of HCV RNA. Proliferative responses against 20-mer peptides showed multiple responses within the NS3 and NS4 region, possibly reflecting multiple epitopes in this region. In contrast no virus specific T cell responses were detectable in a control group of patients with chronic HCV. For further characterization of T cell epitopes HCV specific T cell clones were generated from 6 patients against eight different HCV epitopes located within the NS3 (aa1027-1657, two epi-topes) and NS4alb (aa1658-1972, six epitopes) region. The minimal epitopes consist of 8 to 12 amino acids. All T cell clones were HLA class I1 restricted and could be stimulated by protein or peptide pulsed EBV blasts expressing the cor-responding HLA-DR or -DQ. Conclusion: The HCV NS3 and NS4 proteins contain several immunodominant CD4+ T cell epitopes which are associated with spontaneous viral clearance. The detailed characterization of minimal epitopes and HLA restriction are a pre-requisite for the synthesis of HLA class I1 tetramers and for the development of prophylactic and therapeutic T cell vaccines. Background A brief period of tissue ischemia followed by reperfusion renders tissue resistant against subsequent prolonged ischemia and reperfusion, a phenomenon called ischemic preconditioning. Hepatic ischemic preconditioning protects sinusoidal endothelial cells against subsequent cold storagelwarm reperfusion injury and improves graft survival after liver transplantation in rats. Aim Ischemic preconditioning also reduces liver injury after warm ischemia and reperfusion, in which hepatocyte damage and Kupffer cell activation are dominant features. However, it is incompletely elucidated which cell type ischemic preconditioning affects and how it works. Therefore, our aim was to investigate the mechanisms of ischemic preconditioning against warm ischemia and reperfusion injury. Method Male Sprague-Dawley rats were injected intravenously with 20 mglkg gadolinium chloride (GdCls), 10000 Ulkg superoxide dismutase (SOD) or 300 mglkg N-acethyl-L-cyctein (NAC) to suppress Kupffer cells, superoxide formation or oxygen radical formation, respectively. Livers were then preconditioned by clamping the hepatic artery and portal vein to the median and left lobes for 10 min followed by 10 min reperfusion. Subsequently, livers were subjected to warm ischemialreperfusion injury in in vivo experiments and in liver perfusion experiments as follows. In vivo experiments: The blood flow to the median and left lobes was occluded with a vascular clamp for 40 min. One hour after removal of the clamp, blood was collected for determination of ALT activity and hyaluronic acid (HA) concentration. Liver perfusion experiments: Livers were perfused through the portal vein for 10 min with physiological buffer and stored at 37\u00b0C in the same buffer. After 40 min, livers were reperfused with the buffer containing 500 ng/mL HA for 60 min in a recirculating system for determination of ALT activity in the perfusate and hepatic HA uptake as a marker of sinusoidal endothelial cell injury. Livers of other non-treated rats were preconditioned by perfusion with the buffer containing H202 instead of ischemic preconditioning, and then subjected to warm ischemialreperfusion similarly. In other experiments, livers were subjected to ischemic preconditioning and perfused with the buffer containing 0.5 mglmL nitro blue tetrazolium (NBT) for 10 min and fixed with formalin. Since NBT reacts with superoxide to form insoluble blue formazan, Kupffer cell superoxide formation was evaluated in histological sections. Results Ischemic preconditioning decreased serum ALT activity compared to control (168 ? 34 [mean 5 SEMI vs 333 ? 52, p < 0.05), but did not change serum HA concentration. Pretreatment with GdC13 reversed the effect of ischemic preconditioning (262 2 41), though GdC13 itself did not change ALT activity after ischemialreperfusion (318 t_ 33). Similar results were obtained in liver perfusion experiments, suggesting that ischemic preconditioning protected hepatocytes, but did not change sinusoidal endothelial cell injury. It is also suggested that Kupffer cells mediate hepatocytes protection by ischemic preconditioning. In rats treated with SOD or NAC, decrease in ALT activity in the perfusate by isch- Background: Living donor liver transplantation (LDLT) and split livers have emerged as a solution to ease the shortage of liver transplants and have achieved remarkable success in pediatric populations. In adults, LDLT is limited by the size of the graft that can be safely harvested and transplanted. Similar limitations apply when extensive liver resections are needed for the treatment of hepatic tumors. We have previously demonstrated that the anti-apoptotic gene A20 is part of the physiologic response of hepatocytes to injury, protecting them from apoptosis and limiting inflammation by inhibiting NF-KB activation. Our objective was to check whether A20 expression would help decrease the minimal liver mass required for mice survival. Methods and Results: Two-thirds partial hepatectomy is well tolerated and is an accepted model of liver regeneration in rodents. We performed an extended (78%) liver resection (n=12/group) in non-infected (NI) mice (10-12 week BALB/c) and mice infected with recombinant A20 adenovirus (rAd.A20) or a control adenovirus (rAd.P-gal). Surviving mice suffer a delay in regeneration as assessed by the number of proliferation cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) positive nuclei 48 h following resection (5-10 positive cellslHPF in mice with 78% liver resection vs. 60-70 positive cells/ HPF in mice with a 2/3 liver resection). Interestingly, such a delay was not noted in mice expressing A20 (70-80 PCNA positive cells/ HPF were detected 48 h following 78% resection). A20 also prevented the development of coagulopathy as assessed by prothrombin time. We extended our resection to a radical hepatectomy comprising 87% of the liver (n=12lgroup). We observed 100% lethality in NI and rAd.P-gal infected mice. Expression of A20 resulted in the survival of 60% of the animals and correlated with increased PCNA positive hepatocytes as an indicator of increased cell proliferation. A20 mediated increase in hepatocyte proliferation was not merely dependent upon its anti-apoptotic function. Expression of A20 in hepatocyte cultures, in a nonapoptotic milieu, increased their proliferative response to serum and HGF as compared to NI and rAd.P-gal infected cells. Conclusion: These results demonstrate a novel pro-proliferatif function for A20 in hepatocytes and argue for its critical role in accelerating liver regeneration and promoting hepatocyte survival and function, even when facing extreme metabolic demands.",

Previously, we showed that a rodent orthologous for autosomal recessive PKD (ARPKD), the PCK rat, has a splicing mutation IVS35-2A-T in Pkhdl (the gene coding for fibrocystin) and displayed extensive postnatal remodeling of the biliary tree resembling human ARPKD. Recent studies have indicated a possible role for primary cilia in renal cyst formation, but involvement of these organelles in related liver disease has not been demonstrated. We employed scanning (SEM), transmission (TEM), immonoelectron (IEM) and immunofluorescent (IMF) microscopy to examine the expression of fibrocystin, the protein product of Pkhdl, in cholangiocytes and its role in biliary cyst formation using specific monoclonal and polyclonal antibodies. We also designed small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) targeting nucleotide 6830-6851 of the Pkhdl coding sequence to determine the effect of fibrocystin inactivation on ciliary structure. Experiments were performed on intrahepatic bile duct units (IBDUs) isolated from normal rats and on liver cysts isolated from PCK rats. RESULTS: In normal liver by SEM and TEM, each cholangiocyte possessed a single cilium projecting into the lumen. IMF and IEM microscopy using specific antibodies against fibrocystin and acetylated a-tubulin (a known ciliary component) demonstrated that fibrocystin was localized to cholangiocyte cilia. In the PCK rat, cilia were abnormal-appearing with bulbous extensions, shorter than normal (3.8622.16j~m, vs. 6.6821.67prn; p<O.OOl) and very heterogeneous in length (range 0.24 -6.31j~m).IMF and IEM microscopy showed that cilia in biliary cysts were devoid of fibrocystin. Normal IBDUs treated with siRNA to silence Pkhdl (mRNA level inhibited by 80%) did not express fibrocystin and were significantly decreased in length compared to IBDUs treated with scrambled siRNA (2.4221.51pm vs. 5.9121.32pm; p<O.OOl). CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that fibrocystin is required for the maintenance of cholangiocyte cilia under normal conditions. Mutations to Pkhdl, as seen in the PCK rat, result in biliary cystogenesis, abnormalities in ciliary morphology, and diminished fibrocystin expression in cilia. The data support the notion that biliary cystogenesis in the PCK rat, and possibly in human ARPKD, is associated with defects in cholangiocyte cilia.Disclosures: Peter C Harris -No relationships to disclose Bing Q Huang -No relationships to disclose Nicholas F LaRusso -No relationships to disclose Anatoliy I Masyuk -No relationships to disclose Tatyana V Masyuk -No relationships to disclose Rachaneekorn Punyashthiti -No relationships to disclose Patrick L Splinter -No relationships to disclose Vicente E Torres -No relationships to disclose Xiofang Wang -No relationships to disclose Christopher J Ward -No relationships to disclose REGULATION AND FUNCTIONAL IMPAIRMENT OF THE ORGANIC CATION TRANSPORTER 1 (OCT1) IN RAT LIVER.

In 1994 the first organic cation transporter, Octl, was isolated from rat kidney through expression cloning(Grundemann et al., Nature 1994; 372 549-52). Many physiological substances (e.g. choline, thiamine, transmitters) and xenobiotics (e.g. metformin, azidothymidine, cytosinarabinoside, tetraethylammonium (TEA)) are substrates of Octl. Rat Octl is expressed at the basolateral membrane of hepatocytes, proximal renal tubules, and enterocytes. Although cholestasis alters the expression of several basolateral and canalicular transport proteins, nothing is known about the effects of cholestasis on hepatic cation homeostasis and transport. Aim: To investigate the effect of obstructive cholestasis on Octl expression in rat liver and kidney and on organic cation transport. Methods: Male Sprague-Dawley rats were subjected to bile duct ligation (BDL) or sham surgery. Animals were sacrificed after 3, 7, and 14 days and tissues were harvested for Western analysis, real-time RT-PCR, and immunohistochemistry (n=3-5 each group). To assess functional effects of BDL on organic cation transport, the model Octl substrate TEA (0.2 mg [14C]-TEA / kg bw plus 1.1 mg TEA I kg bw), was administered i.v. to male Sprague-Dawley rats 14 days after BDL or sham surgery, respectively (n=4-6 each group). After 1 h the distribution of radioactivity was determined. Results: Western analysis of total membranes revealed a significant decrease of Octl protein expression in cholestatic livers. Three days after BDL hepatic Octl protein levels were 42.1?17.7% of controls (RO.01). After 7 and 14 days of BDL there was a further loss of Octl protein in the liver (15.5?4.7% and 8.6i2.7% of controls, respectively, R 0 . 0 5 ) . In contrast, there were no significant changes of Octl protein expression in kidneys even 14 days after BDL. Real-time RT-PCR demonstrated a decrease of hepatic Octl mRNA levels after BDL to 77.2?12.7%, 40.7i8.1% (P<0.05), and 50.3-C7.5% (R0.05) after 3,7, and 14 days, respectively. In contrast, there was a significant increase of Octl mRNA levels in BDL kidneys (179.4?24.7% of controls (RO.01)) but only after 3 days. Thereafter, kidney Octl mRNA levels returned to normal. Tissue immunofluorescence corroborated the data from Western analysis. Control liver sections showed the typical distribution pattern of Octl in the hepatocytes surrounding the central veins. However, 14 days after BDL only a weak signal was detected. Functional studies confirmed these findings since the hepatic accumulation of [14C]-TEA in 14 day BDL rats was reduced to 29.6?10.9% of controls (P<O.OOl). Conclusion: Obstructive cholestasis results in progressive down-regulation of Octl in rat liver which is associated with a reduced hepatic uptake of the Octl substrate TEA. These findings suggest that the hepatic uptake of therapeutic agents that are small organic cations may be impaired in cholestatic liver diseases.Disclosures: Ulrich Beuers -No relationships to disclose James L Boyer -No relationships to disclose Gerald U Denk -No relationships to disclose Hermann Koepsell -No relationships to disclose Albert Mennone -No relationships to disclose Carol J Soroka -No relationships to disclose OBSTRUCTIVE CHOLESTASIS RESULTS IN DOWN-VIA CHOLESTEROL 7 a HYDROXYLASE PROMOTER FACTOR (CPF) AND IS HEPATOPROTECTIVE IN OBSTRUCTIVE CHOLESTASIS. Alan Bohan, Wen-Sheng Chen, Lee A Denson, Matthew A Held, James L Boyer, Yale University School of Medicine, New Haven, CTBackground. The multidrug resistance associated protein 3(MRP3/Mrp3/ABCCB/Abcc3) is up-regulated in obstructive cholestasis and is thought to convey hepatoprotection by functioning as a basolateral bile salt export pump. We have previously reported the association between Mrp3 and CPF (FTFILrh-1) induction and hepatocyte protection in bile duct ligated (BDL) mice (Hepatology 2002;36(4):241A); and that Mrp3 expression is induced by ligands for nuclear hormone receptors (NHRs) and that one of these, CPF, directly up-regulates MRP3 promoter activity (Hepatology 2002;36(4):323A). We hypothesized that some of the factors responsible for the up-regulation of Mrp3 may include cytokines and may exert their activity via CPF. Methods. We performed sham surgery and bile duct ligation on wildtype C57BL6J (WT) and Tnfa Receptor I knockout (TnfrI-l-) mice. Hepatic histology, serum and tissue bile acid levels and Mrp3 and Lrh-1 expression were determined. HepG2 cells were treated with cytokines or bile acids and expression of MRP3 and CPF were assessed. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays were performed using both murine and tissue culture nuclear proteins to determine the degree of CPF binding to the response elements on the Mrp3 promoter. Activity of the 0.5kb MPR3 promoter, containing both intact and mutated adjacent CPF response elements (REs), which had been transfected into HepG2 cells, was determined by luciferase assay after co-transfection with cpf or treatment with Tnfa. Results. Wildtype mice manifested significantly less histological necrosis, higher serum bile acids and lower hepatic bile acids than TnfrI-l-mice. This was associated with hepatic upregulation of Lrh-1 and Mrp3 in WT, a response that appeared absent in TnfrI-l-, mice. CPF and Mrp3 RNA and protein were up-regulated in HepG2 cells after treatment with Tnfa, ILlp or CDCA. EMSA demonstrated significantly increased DNA binding to adjacent CPF response elements (RE) from the Mrp3 promoter in WT BDL compared to TnfrI-/-BDL mice, and in cells treated with Tnfa, ILlp or CDCA. Furthermore, activity of the MRP3 promoter was up-regulated by co-transfection with CPF or treatment with Tnfa in HepG2 cells, while combined mutation of the CPF REs abolished these effects. Conclusion. Up-regulation of Mrp3 appears to be hepatoprotective in obstructive cholestasis. MRP3 expression is up-regulated by cytokines and bile acids. This is associated with an increase in DNA binding to the CPF RE on the MRP3/Mrp3 promoter in mice and HepG2 cells, and upregulation of Mrp3 promoter activity via adjacent CPF elements in transfected HepG2 cells. Tnfa appears to up-regulate Mrp3 via CPF activation, the therapeutic manipulation of which may lead to new treatments for cholestatic liver disease.

Liver perfusion with NBT revealed superoxide formation in Kupffer cells even after 10 min ischemia. Conclusion Ischemic preconditioning reduced warm ischemialreperfusion injury by protection of hepatocyte, not by suppression of sinusoidal endothelial cell injury in contrast with the effect against cold ischemialreperfusion injury. This effect may be mediated by oxygen radical formation in Kupffer cells during ischemic preconditioning.

            "text": "Previous studies from our lab show that interleukin-6 (IL-6) is a complete biliary epithelial cell (BEC) mitogen that is normally produced by BEC at low levels and upregulated by mechanical, infectious, or immunologic biliary tract injury. Bile duct ligation (BDL) in IL-6-deficient (IL-6-/-) mice results in a reproducible phenotype that includes rapidly decompensating biliary cirrhosis, which is at least partially attributable to impaired biliary tree integrity. METHODS AND RESULTS: Oligonucleotide array analysis of primary mouse IL-64-and wild type IL-6+/+ BEC cultures was used to search for possible molecular mechanisms that might account for impaired biliary tree integrity in IL-64-mice. The results showed upregulation of Trefoil factor family (TFF) messenger RNA (mRNA) in the IL-6+/+ BEC compared to the IL-64-BEC. TFF are mucin-associated protease-resistant peptides that greatly contribute to barrier and epithelial repair in the gastrointestinal tract. Various molecular analyses in vitro using BEC cultures confirmed that IL-6-mediated gp130 signaling through the signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) importantly contributes to TFF3 mRNA and protein expression. In vivo, TFF3 mRNA and protein was expressed predominantly in the medium and large bile ducts and peribfiary glands in normal mouse liver in IL-6+/+ mice, but weakly present or absent in IL-64-mice. Within several weeks after BDL, TFF3 mRNA and protein levels decreased transiently then increased to near baseline levels by twelve (12) weeks after BDL in the IL-6+/+. In contrast, the IL-64-mice failed to show the secondary recovery of TFF3 by 12 weeks when mRNA and protein levels were significantly lower than IL-6+/+ (Figure) . The retarded recovery of TFF3 mRNA and protein in the IL-6-Imice was reversed by daily treatment of recombinant IL-6. Similar results were obtained in analysis of normal human liver and various biliary tract diseases. CONCLUSIONS: TFF3 is the predominant Trefoil factor expressed in the mouse and human biliary tree; its expression appears to be upregulated by STAT3 signaling and suppressed by the mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK) signaling in the BEC. TFF expression in the biliary tree importantly contributes to biliary tree integrity and repair reactions. Blackard, Carolynne Zander, Massachusetts General Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA; Gregory Beck, University of Massachusetts, Boston, MA; Emmett V Schmidt, Raymond T Chung, Massachusetts General Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA BackgroundlAims: The innate immune response (type I IFN system) is postulated to play a critical role in control of viral infection.The role of the IFN system in controlling HCV replication has been inferred but not proven. In addition, HCV protein expression has been shown to antagonize the IFN response in vitro. Until recently, it has been impossible to assess the interaction between HCV and the type I IFN system in vivo without a model that successfully supports viral replication. We have developed a cell-based binary HCV replication model that successfully recapitulates the early stages of the HCV life cycle (PNAS 98 9847,2001) . We therefore used this system (1) to assess the role of type I IFN in controlling HCV replication; and (2) to assess the effect of HCV expression or replication on IFN-induced intracellular signaling. Methods: Full-length HCV cDNA corresponding to the pH77 strain previously shown to be infectious in the presence of ?7 was transfected into Huh-T7 cells (a T7 stably-transfected Huh7 be), as well as mutant m G H human fibroblast cell lines null for the IFN signaling proteins Tyk2 (Ul), IRF9 (U2), Statl (U3), Jakl (U4), and Stat2 (US) respectively. To test the effects of known IFN antagoflists on HCV replication, the IFN signaling antagonist Sendai virus Y2 protein was cotransfected into Huh-T7 cells. In addition, neutralizing antibodies (nAb) to type I IFN were added to selected Huh-TI cells. To study the effect of HCV on IFN signaling, Huh-TI cells were cotransfected with the reporter plasmids pISRE-luc and pRL-TK. IFNa (1000 IU/ml) was added to selected cells after transfection. Reporter gene expression was monitored by the dual-luciferase reporter assay system and measured as relative luciferase activity. HCV core protein was measured using the Trak-C HCV core Ag ELISA. Results IFNa significantly reduced HCV core Ag production from 203.5 pg/ml (pH77+/IFN-) to 41.3 pglml (pH77+/IFN t) (p=O.OOl). In contrast, Y2 protein enhanced HCV core Ag production to 407.6 pglml in pH771Y2 cotransfected cells (p=O.OOOl). Control experiments confirmed that Y2 protein inhibited IFNa-induced ISRE-mediated signaling in Huh-T7 cells; relative luciferase activity was reduced from 653 (pH771 IFNP nAb increased HCV core Ag replication by 42% and 23% compared to no treatment (p=O.O1). The Combination of anti-1FNa nAb and anti-IFNP nAb significantly enhanced HCV core Ag production by 73% (p=O.004). The U3 cell line enhanced HCV core Ag replication by over two-fold compared to the parental m G H and other mutant cell lines. HCV (pH77) transfection suppressed IFN-induced relative luciferase activity by 50% compared to IFN-treated pGEM transfected cells (p= 0.W). Transfection with a replication defective H77 mutant, subgenomic HCV core, or HCV structural protein mutant constructs had effects on suppression of ISRE-luc similar to H77.Conclusions: Using a binary, full length HCV replication model, we found that (I) HCV replication is enhanced in the presence of the IFN antagonist Y2 as well as by IFN neutralizing antibodies, confirming the criticality of the type I IFN system in innate control of HCV replication.(2) Statl null cell lines enhanced HCV replication, indicating that this protein is the critical signaling component in innate antiviral immunity to HCV. (3) HCV expression inhibits IFN signaling. HCV protein expression and specifically HCV core expression appears to be su\u20acficient to suppress IFN signaling. These findings demonstrate that the innate immune response exerts direct antiviral effects on HCV, and that HCV protein expression subverts type I IFN signaling. Our replication model has the potential to provide new insights into the mechanisms of host control of HCV replication as well as the mechanism of HCV persistence.

Anti-IFNa nAb and anti-Background Cytotoxic T lymphocyte activator 4 downregulates T cell activation by ligating B7. Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) at positions -318 in the promoter and +49 in exon 1 of the CTLA4 gene have been associated with an increased risk for autoimmune diseases. The +49G allele has also been associated with a greater likelihood of response to interferon-alpha in patients treated for chronic hepatitis C. Since some of the CTLA4 SNPs either individually or linked together (haplotypes) may alter CTLA4 expression or activity, we hypothesized that they may be associated with natural hepatitis C virus (HCV) clearance or persistence. Methods: Utilizing a nested case-control study design from an injection drug using cohort and a hemophiliac cohorts, we matched subjects with HCV clearance (anti-HCV positive and HCV RNA negative on two occasions separated by a minimum of 6 months) to two persistently HCV-infected individuals (HCV RNA positive on two occasions) based on H N status, race, and gender. Five CTLA4 SNPs, which define all common haplotypes, were genotyped using either sequence specific primers or a single base extension method. Conditional logistic regression was used to determine odds ratios and P-values for these SNPs. Haplotypes were constructed using the PHASE program and analyzed using the SNPEM program. Results: Included in this study were 190 and 370 subjects who either cleared or had a persistent infection with HCV, respectively. The study cohort was 47% Black, 46% White, and 7% Other. Blacks who were homozygous for the mutant allele 49G were more likely to experience viral clearance (OR 0.45, P=0.03). This association was not found in White subjects (OR 0.92, P=0.81). Since, HLA-Cw\"O4 is associated with viral persistence in these cohorts (Thio et a1 J Virol2002), we stratified the 49G homozygous individuals by C w W . Both Blacks and Whites who did not have CwW4 were more likely to have viral clearance if they were homozygous for 49G (OR 0.45, P=0.13 and OR 0.49, P=O.11, respectively) . Stratification by other HLA alleles associated with HCV clearance or persistence did not reveal additional relationships. The 49G formed haplotypes with the wild type alleles at three of the four other SNPs examined, and those haplotypes did not have a stronger association than 49G alone. 49G was found in haplotypes with both the mutant and wild type alleles at the -1722 promoter position, but neither of these haplotypes had a stronger association with clearance. Conclusions: Homozygosity for the CTLA4 49G SNP is associated with clearance of HCV in Blacks regardless of HLA genotype, whereas in Whites, homozygosity at this position trends toward an association with clearance in HLA-Cw*M-negative persons. Since CTLA4 49G has been reported to augment T ceIl activation by decreasing CTLA4 expression, these results point to the importance of T cell activation in HCV clearance. Disclosures:Jacquie Astemborski -No relationships to disclose James G Goedert -No relationships to disclose Recurrence of HCV infection post liver transplant is universal. High levels of viraemia characterize the post transplant course. In this setting, acute rejection in association with HCV re-infection of the graft (AR (HCV)) and recurrent chronic hepatitis (CHI) are recognized clinical entities. We aimed to 1) Determine the intrahepatic gene profile in AR (HCV) and CHI. 2) Examine whether the gene profile in AR (HCV) is different to that of acute rejection in non-HCV infected allografts (AR non-HCV). 3) Examine whether the gene profile of CHI is different to chronic hepatitis C pre-transplant (CH). Methods: GeneChip arrays were utilized to study pooled RNA from 34 liver tissue; 6 patients with AR (HCV), 6 patients with AR (non-HCV), 8 patients with CHI, 8 patients with CH and 6 normal livers. Probe level data was analysed using the Bioconductor affy library and genes with more than 2 fold changes were considered to be upregulated. Results: AR (HCV) us AR (non-HCV): Compared to normal tissue, both groups were similarly characterized by upregulation of several T cell dependent immune activation genes such as the lymphocyte antigen CAMPATH-1, Mac-2 binding protein and IFN related genes. However, compared to AR (non-HCV), AR (HCV) was specifically characterized by upregulation of several IFN-alpha associated genes including 2-50AS, and p27. CHI vs C H Compared to normal, both groups were characterized by upregulation of genes involved in antigen presentation (proteasome subunit 42, MDW), T cell activation (T cell receptor and CTL-17), IFN-gamma inducible genes (IFN-56KD, IP-10, Humig and class I1 MHC) and IFN-alpha associated genes (p27 and 2-5 OAS). However, the IFN-alpha and gamma genes were more upregulated in CHI compared to CH. Furthermore, compared to CH, the CHI group displayed increased expression of genes involved in cellular proliferation (PCNA, cyclin, beta integrin), apoptosis (cytochrome c, Fas-L, caspase 4), inflammation (macrophage mannose receptor, complement factor H) and fibrosis (angiotensin I1 receptor, proteoglycan core protein). Conclusions: At the transcriptome level, the pathological process in HCV infected allografts with acute rejection or recurrent chronic hepatitis is characterized by upregulation of several IFN-alpha and gamma related genes compared to other livers. Moreover, chronic HCV post transplant is further characterized by an increased process of cellular proliferation, apoptosis and fibrosis compared to chronic hepatitis in the pretransplant setting. Collectively the data suggest that the high levels of viraemia which characterize the post transplant setting drive the immune response to act at a higher level. In addition, the upregulation of several interferon related antiviral genes supports the notion that HCV is a strong inducer of intrahepatic interferons, but is relatively resistant to their antiviral activity. (HCV) infection is thought to be mediated by a multispecific immune response. HCV-specific T cells have been described in HCV-seronegative virus-exposed individuals such as i.v.-drug addicts, family members of chronic HCV-patients and lab-personnel. However, it is not known whether these individuals had recovered from previous asymptomatic acute hepatitis C. In this study, we prospectively followed 10 individuals who experienced an injury with an HCV-contaminated needle. Methods: Between January 2001 and March 2003 we collected PBMC from 10 individuals (medical health professionals at our institution; 3 females, 7 males; age 30-45 years) who experienced an injury with an HCV contaminated needle. Blood samples were taken on the day or the day after the event and at different time points during follow-up for up to 12 months. Low levels of HCV-RNA were examined in serum by the highly sensitive transcription-mediated TMA-Assay (detection limit 5-50 IUIML) and in RNA of PBMC. T cell-cytokine secretion (ELISPOT-assays for IFN-gamma and IL-10, flow-cytometry-based IFN-g capture assays), T cell-proliferation (3-thymidin incorporation, CFSE-staining), and T cell-cytotoxicity (51-chromium release assays) were investigated directly ex vivo and in T cell lines. Results: None of the individuals became positive for HCV-RNA in serum (TMA-assay) or PBMC and all of them remained anti-HCVnegative throughout follow-up. At the time of the needle stick injury, HCV-specific CD4+ T cell responses were already detectable in 2 of the individuals and became detectable thereafter in 2 additional persons. HCV-specific CD8+ T cell responses could be investigated in one HLA-A2-positive individual in more detail at several time points. He was negative for HCV-specific interferon gamma-and IL-10-producing cells on the day of the injury as determined by ELISPOT assays. However, after 18 weeks, we detected for Core-178-specific IFN-gamma producing CD8+ T cells. Out of 7 MHC-class I-restricted HCV epitopes tested, one additional peptide (NS3-1406) became positive 8 weeks later. The presence of Core-178 and NS3-1406-specific CD8+ T cells was confirmed by a second flow-cytometry-based assay. HCV-specific INF-gamma positive cells were CD8-dim and HLA-DR-negative. The frequency of NS3-1406 and Core-178-specific CD8+ T cells was about 114500 and 118500 PBMC, respectively, in the ELISPOT assay and remained constant in this subject until month 11 of followup. The increase of CD8+ T cell responses was accompanied by the development of an HCV-specific CD4+ response targeting predominantly the HCV-core and HCV-helicase antigens. Conclusions: We here demonstrate in a prospective study the development of HCV-specific T cells in HCV-exposed individuals after needle stick i n j q in the absence of viremia. Surprisingly, these HCVspecific T cells became detectable rather late after the potential exposure. Our data are in line with previous studies demonstrating HCVspecific T cell responses in chimpanzees inoculated with subinfectious doses of HCV. T cell immunity in medical health professionals against HCV may contribute to the low prevalence of HCV among doctors and nurses since HCV prevalence in medical health personnel has been shown to be equal or even lower as compared to the general population in most studies. Aims: Laparoscopic cholecystectomy is the treatment of choice for symptomatic gallstone disease at present. Despite its wide spread application in the past decade, the incidence of iatrogenic bile duct injuries related to this procedure has remained unchanged around 0.3-0.6%. We review the investigation, management and outcomes of such injuries referred to a tertiary referral center in the United Kingdom. Methods: Prospectively collected data on iatrogenic bile duct injuries following elective laparoscopic cholecystectomy referred to our center was analyzed. The Strasberg classification was used for defining the types of injury. Results: A series of 125 patients were referred for management of iatrogenic bile duct injuries between January 1991 and June 2003.Median follow up period was 55 months. 87 patients had type E injuries (To%), followed by 20 with type A (16%) 14 with type D (11%) and 2 each of types B (1.6%) and C (1.6%). An uncomplicated primary operation was described in 74 patients (60%). Despite the operation being converted to an open procedure in 27 patients only 18 injuries were recognized at the time of surgery.(l4.4%) Although the median time to recognition of biliary tract injury was 2 days (1-21) the median time to referral increased to 10 days (0-99) for a type A injury, and 16 days (0-2200) for a type E injury. A total of 29 patients underwent surgical intervention prior to referral of which 20 had biliary reconstruction. Nine of these patients required subsequent revision surgery. After referral 15(13%) patients were managed conservatively while 6(5%) had ERCP and biliary stenting and 24(29%) had interventional radiology as the main procedure. Surgical intervention was required in 79 patients (53%) at our center following referral. This included T-tube insertion (7), primary common bile duct repair (lo), biliary reconstruction (60) and liver resection (2) with three patients requiring subsequent revision surgery. Major associated vascular injuries were present in eight patients. One patient suffers from recurrent cholangitis while five remain asymptomatic on follow up. Two required liver resection due to severe ischaemic necrosis. Bowel perforations were associated in three patients. Both vascular and bowel injuries occurred in patients with type E bile duct injuries. Nine patients (7%) had recurrent cholangitis following treatment. Three patients developed end-stage liver disease due to secondary biliary cirrhosis with one undergoing orthotopic liver transplantation. There were five deaths related to bile duct injuries. Two had associated vascular injuries and one had bowel perforation. A further two patients with type A injuries died following multiorgan failure due to sepsis. Conclusions: Iatrogenic bile duct injuries are associated with significant morbidity and mortality. Delay in recognition and appropriate referral remain a continuing problem. A multi disciplinary approach in a specialized institution has a significantly better long term outcome.",

            "text": "Background Radio-frequency ablation (RFA) is widely used as a treatment of inoperable tumor leasons in the liver. Preliminary studies of a VX2 hepatoma model in rabbits showed tumor specific T lymphocytes after RFA treatment and a significantly prolonged survival of these treated animals compared to a control group. Aim: The aim of the study was to assess whether the observed tumor specific T cell response after RFA treatment, found in the VX2 tumor model, is transferable to humans. Methods: 12 Patients were included into a pilot study. 6 Patients had metastases of colonic cancer and 6 patients were suffering from hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) with underlying cirrhosis. All patients were treated with RFA (Elektrotom Him 106, Berchtold, Germany).Blood samples were taken before and 4 weeks after RFA. An Interferon gamma cytokine secretion assay (Miltenyi, Germany) was carried out on whole blood and measured by a flowcytometer (FACS Calibur, BD Science, Germany). As test antigens served autologous liver tissue and tumor tissue received by biopsy. T cells were doublestained with CD 8 antibody to detect cytotoxic T cells. The basic IFN gamma secretion was also measured unstimulated. The activated/non activated CD8 positive T cell ratio (ANR) was calculated and analysed statistically with SPSS. Only RFA naive were included. Results: Before RFA patients had a mean stimulation of 0,022 ANR (SD=0,001) against liver tissue and 0,027 ANR (SD=0,002) against tumor tissue (see tab.1). 4 weeks after RFA a strong increase of ANR was observed with 0,11 ANR (HCC) and 0,15 ANR (colorectal carcinoma) against tumor tissue. This increase was also detectable 8 weeks after RFA (0,14 ANR (SD=0,003) (HCC) and 0,14 ANR (0,003) (colorectal carcinoma)) (see Fig. 1 and tab.1) . The ANR levels were allways low against liver tissue with 0,03 ANR (SD=0,002). Discussion: RFA shows significant tumor specific T-cell stimulation in patients with primary and secondary tumors of the liver. RFA seems to overcome immune tolerance or presents alterated and/or cryptic tumor antigens, and causes a significant tumor specific cytotoxic Tcell response. This effect could be exploided in multimodal antitumoral strategies. The strategy of primary hepatic resection followed by secondary liver transplantation (SLT)was not evaluated in-term of operative risks and survival. Between 1991-2001, among 88 cirrhotic patients transplanted for HCC with Mazzafero's criteria on analysis of the specimen, 18 had liver resection prior to SLT : for recurrence (n=11), deterioration of liver function (n=4) or high risk for recurrence (n=3) with a mean time between liver resection and listing for LT was 20 months .The comparison between SLT group and patients who underwent primary liver transplantation (PLT) showed similar median age (55 vs. 53 years), sex and etiology of liver disease (alcohol/viral BIClother). Overall time on LT waiting list of the two groups was similar (5 vs. 3 months). Pathologic analysis of the specimen revealed similar number (1.7 vs. 1.6) and tumor size (2.3 vs. 2.2 cm). Pen-and post-operative course were not different in terms of operative time (551 vs. 530 min), blood loss (1282 vs. 1191 mL), transfusion (3 vs. 2 units), ICU (10 vs. 9 days) or hospital stay (32 vs. 31 days), morbidity (56% vs. 51%) or 30-day mortality (5.7% vs. 5.6%). During a median follow-up of 32 months (3 to 158 months), 3 patients recurred after PLT and one after SLT. After transplantation, 3 and 5-year overall survivals were not different between groups (82 vs. 82% and 59 vs. 61%). Results of our study showed that liver resection for HCC prior to transplantation did not increased the morbidity or impair long-term survival following LT. Therefore liver resection prior to transplantation can be integrated in the treatment strategy for HCC. AIMS: CT-1 is a member of the IL-6 family of cytokines which protects myocardiocytes against thermal and ischemic insults. In this work we analyzed the expression of CT-1 by normal and diseased liver and whether this cytokine might protect the liver against ischemia-reperfusion injury. METHODS: Rat CT-1 cDNA was cloned, recombinat rat CT-1 was produced and used for generation of poly and monoclonal antibodies which were employed in immunochemistry, western blot and ELISA. The recombinant cytokine was assayed for therapeutic use in rat models of ischemia-reperfusion injury. Wistar rats were subjected to 60 min ischemia of 70% of the liver by clamping the corresponding branches of the hepatic and portal vein. After this period the clamp was released and serum and tissue samples were obtained at 6 hours. Rats were divided into three groups: group 1 received 100 mcg CT-1 10 minutes prior to ischemia (n=8), group 2 received saline instead of CT-1 (n=8) and group 3 were sham operated (n=4). RESULTS: Immunohistochemistry of normal livers demonstrated CT-1 expression selectively in hepatocytes of the centrolobular area. Six hours after reperfusion of ischemic livers the values of serum ALT were 10 times higher in group 2 than in group 1 (pCO.01). Severe focal hepatocellular necrosis was found in animals from group 2 while no apparent morpholgical changes were observed in rats from group 1. Serum CT-1 levels were raised after reperfusion in untreated animals as compared with sham operated rats. Western blot of liver samples showed an increase of CT-1 expression in the non-ischemic liver lobule as compared with the damaged part of the liver. CONCLUSIONS: CT-1 is a hepatoprotective cytokine produced by hepatocytes in centrolobular areas. CT-1 synthesis increases after ischemic insults. Administration of recombinant CT-1 protects very efficiently the liver against ischemia-reperfusion injury. CT-1 may be a valuable therapy to attenuate hepatic damage of the donor liver during orthotopic liver transplantation.

            "text": "BACKGROUND: In experimental and clinical acute liver failure, both a loss of cerebrovascular autoregulation and an increase in cerebral blood flow (CBF) have been implicated in the development of brain edema. It is unclear whether the pathogenesis of these two phenomena are linked. The accumulation of glutamine within astrocytes appears to be a critical first step in the development of cerebral hyperemia, as experimental inhibition of glutamine synthetase with methionine sulfoximine (MSO) attenuates brain edema and corrects cerebral hyperemia. To study cerebrovascular autoregulation without the confounding variable of brain edema, we examined animals one day after portacaval anastomosis (PCA), where a decreased cerebral blood flow has been noted in the setting of a hyperdynamic systemic circulation. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A PCA or sham surgery was performed in male SlD rats (300-400 gm). At 24 hrs, mean arterial pressure (MAP) was measured continuously in anesthetized rats. Noradrenaline was infused at a dose of 1 pglkglmin for 60 minutes. MSO or saline was given as an intraperitoneal injection (150 mglkg) three hours prior to NA infusion. Relative changes in cortical blood flow (CBF) were measured with a laser Doppler probe placed over the parietal cortex. The animals were mechanically ventilated and arterial blood gases were monitored throughout the experiment. Three groups of rats were studied (n= 18). RESULTS: The sham group had significantly higher MAP, in accordance with the systemic vasodilatation seen in PCA rats. Adding NA to all groups significantly raised MAP and HR. The sham+NA group did not exhibit an increase in CBF with a rise in MAP. The PCA+NA group had a significant increase in laser Doppler flow (LDF) from baseline that coincided with an increase in MAP. Pretreatment of the PCA animals with MSO prevented the rise in CBF despite a rise in MAP. There were no significant differences in pC02 among the three groups. As expected, arterial ammonia levels were higher in PCA animals and increased further after inhibition of glutamine synthetase in the group that received MSO. CONCLUSIONS: A rise of MAP in rats after PCA results in an increase of CBF, indicating a loss of cerebrovascular autoregulation. The restoration of autoregulation with MSO, despite higher arterial ammonia levels, suggests that accumulation of glutamine within the brain is critical to the pathogenesis of altered cerebrovascular regulation in this model. As similar conclusions can be reached regarding the development of cerebral hyperemia in experimental acute liver failure, it appears that the mechanisms responsible for cerebral hyperemia and failed cerebrovascular autoregulation are linked. Future studies should focus on the nature of the intracerebral signal that is responsible for the loss of cerebral autoregulation in this model. A decreased intra-hepatic production of nitric oxide (NO) participates on the pathogenesis of portal hypertension in cirrhosis. Although non-specific NO donor substances, such as nitrates, are able to decrease the intra-hepatic vascular resistance to portal blood flow, the use of these vasodilators to treat portal hypertension in cirrhotic patients is limited by the occurrence of side effects (arterial hypotension, headaches etc). Aim. To test the effect of a liver-specific NO donor (NCX-1000), an ursodeoxycholic acid-derived compound, on both systemic and intra-hepatic hemodynamics in portal hypertensive cirrhotic rats. Method. After the development of ascites, cirrhotic rats (CC4-induced) were treated with NCX-1000 (28 mglKg b.w.) or ursodeoxycholic acid (15 mglKg b.w., control group) by gavage once a day for 14 days and, then, used in 1 of 3 studies: 1) in vivo mean arterial pressure (MAP), portal pressure (PP), and superior mesenteric artery (SMA) blood flow measurements before and during progressive blood volume expansion (blood infusion); 2) in situ liver perfusion to obtain doselresponse curves to methoxamine (alpha*-adrenergic agonist) or flowlpressure curves; and 3) cGMP concentration measurement in liver tissue. Results. Both MAP and heart rate were similar in both groups, indicating that NCX-1000 had no effect on systemic hemodynamics. PP was also similar in both groups. During blood infusion, NCX-1000 treated rats and control rats showed similar MAP (p=0.134) and SMA blood flow (p=0.449) increases; however, the PP increase observed in control rats was blunted in NCX-1000 treated rats (p=0.015). Flowlpressure curves obtained during liver perfusion were similar in both groups; however, livers from NCX-1000-treated rats showed a decreased response to methoxamine (p=0.016) than controls. The concentration of cGMP in NCX-1000-treated livers was significantly higher (p=0.015; ) than in ursodeoxycholic acid-treated livers (27.65 t 7.95 vs. 11.20 2 6.03 fmollmg of protein). Conclusion. NCX-1000 improves the portal system adaptability to portal blood flow increase and decreases the intra-hepatic hyper-reactivity to methoxamine observed in cirrhotic rat livers without causing systemic side effects. These beneficial effects are probably due to increase in the intra-hepatic NO bioavailability. The mechanisms behind the upregulation of endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) in portal hypertensive animals remain unknown. The aim of this study was to investigate the mechanism that initiates eNOS upregulation in the superior mesenteric artery (SMA) in portal hypertension. It has been shown that the vasoconstriction of the SMA with the consequent increase in the SMA cyclic strain is the earliest event that occurs within hours after portal vein ligation (PVL). Thus, we tested the hypothesis that this early vasoconstriction of the SMA may initiate eNOS upregulation in PVL animals. Methods: Portal hypertension was induced by partial ligation of the portal vein (n=99). In a separate group of rats, mesenteric vasoconstriction was achieved also by renal artery ligation (RAL, n=26). Corresponding sham-operated rats were used as control groups (n=50). Effects of vasoconstriction of the SMA in PVL and RAL rats were evaluated by measuring perfusion pressure changes in the isolated SMA beds in response to methoxamine, NOS activity and eNOS protein expression. Data were compared to the corresponding sham group. Hemodynamic features were also determined. Mean arterial pressure (MAP), portal pressure ( I \" ) and SMA blood flow (Qsma) were measured by catheterization and pulsed Doppler flowmetry. SMA vascular resistance was calculated from MAP, PP and Qsma. Results: There was a significant increase in the SMA vascular resistance in PVL (2.33%0.13 vs 1.2220.03 rnmHgl %flow, K0.05) and RAL rats (23220.18 vs 1.18%0.02 mmHgf%flow, P<0.05) compared to their corresponding sham-operated rats, demonstrating the presence of SMA vasoconstriction in both PVL and RAL groups. The mesenteric vasculature of PVL and RAL animals showed hyporeactivity to methoxamine compared to their respective sham groups (P< 0.01). Whiie PVL rats were portal hypertensive (P<O.Ol), RAL rats were not. The SMA vascular hyporeactivity of PVL and RAL were corrected by L-NMMA and while there was not significant difference in eNOS protein expression NOS enzyme activity was significantly higher in the PVL and RAL rats compared to the corresponding sham-operated groups (see figure) . Conclusions: Mesenteric arterial vasoconstriction in itself leads to eNOS upregulation and therefore, plays a triggering role in the initial increase of eNOS catalyhc activity in SMA of PVL rats. Helen Hendrickson, Vijay Shah, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, M N Background. Diminished eNOS derived NO production from the hepatic vascular endothelium contributes to hepatic vasoconstriction in cirrhotic portal hypertension. Unfortunately, prior studies aimed at delivering a constitutively active form of eNOS (S1179DeNOS) using an adenoviral vector (AdS1179DeNOS) were unsuccessful in correcting hepatic vasoconstriction in the bile duct ligated (BDL) rat liver. Aim. To better understand the mechanism of S1179DeNOS dysfunction in BDL liver by examining the influence of the eNOS inhibitory protein caveolin on recombinant S1179DeNOS function in transduced hepatic stellate cells, which do not express eNOS endogenously but are a prominent cell target of systemically delivered adenoviral vectors. Methods. Cellular localization of caveolin was determined from fixed sham and BDL liver sections by immunogold electron microscopy. In vitro gene transfer was performed in the LX2 HSC line with AdS1179DeNOS and an adenoviral vector encoding caveolin (Ad-Cav). Protein interactions were determined by immunoprecipita-tion and Western blot analysis. NOS activity was assessed by arginine to citrulline conversion assay. Results. Caveolin immunogold analysis in BDL liver demonstrated prominent expression not only in liver endothelial cells, but also in stellate cells. Western blot analysis from LX2 cell lysates confirmed caveolin protein expression in vitro. In LX2 cells transduced with AdS1179DeNOS, immunoprecipitation of caveolin co-precipitated recombinant S1179DeNOS and conversely, immunoprecipitation of S1179DeNOS coprecipitated caveolin. To examine the influence of excess caveolin protein levels on S1179DeNOS, LX2 cells were co-transduced with AdS1179DeNO.S and AdCav. Co-transduction of AdCav and AdS1179D promotes the enhanced binding between S1179DeNOS and caveolin as well as a decrease in the activity of recombinant S1179DeNOS by 25% (P<0.05; AdS1179DeNOS vs AdS1179DeNOS +Adcav; n=5). Conclusion. These studies demonstrate a functional effect of enhanced caveolin expression and binding with S1179DeNOS in stellate cells and indicate that the lack of function of recombinant S1179DeNOS protein delivered in vivo to cirrhotic liver may be due to inhibition of S1179DeNOS by caveolin-1 in stellate cells. Background and Aims: The presence of actin-like microfilaments in the neighborhood of sinusoidal endothelial fenestrae (SEF) indicates that the cytoskeleton of sinusoidal endothelial cells (SEC)s plays an important role in the modulation of SEF. We have reported that a potent vasoconstrictor endothelin (ET) causes contractions of SEF as well as hepatic stellate cells via the ETA and ETB receptors, leading to the elevations of sinusoidal microvascular resistance supposed to be one the essential factors in the pathogenesis of portal hypertension. Rho has emerged as an important regulator of the actin cytoskeleton, and consequently cell morphology. The present study aimed to examine how a Rho stimulator; lysophophatidic acid (LPA), and a Rho inhibitor; Y-27632 Rho-kinase inhibitor, affect the morphology of SEF in vitro. Methods: Monolayers of cultured SEC were obtained by collagenase infusion of a rat liver and then subjected to primary culture for 24 hours. The cells were separated into three groups; control, LPA-treated (lOpM), and Y-27632-treated (10pM) groups (treatment duration, 30 min). SEF morphology was observed by scanning electron microscopy. Formation of F-actin stress fibers was observed by confocal microscopy. Actin cytoskeleton around SEF was investigated by permealizing cells with streptolysin-0 (1.5 U) for 30 min and examined by transmission electron microscopy. Rho A and phosphorylated myosin light chain kinase were analyzed by Western blotting. Rho activation was measured by Rhotekin binding assay. Results: Following LPA treatment, F-actin stress fiber and active Rho increased concomitant with a decrease in diameter of SEF. However, following Y-27632 treatment, F-actin stress fiber and active Rho were reduced, concomitant with an increase in diameter of SEF. Actin cytoskeleton around SEF increased in LPA-treated cell, but decreased in Y-27632-treated cell. Rho A levels were similar in control, LPA-treated, and Y-27632treated SECs. Phosphorylated myosin light chain kinase levels were diminished gradually after 5 min in Y-27632-treated SECs and increased after 5 min in LPA-treated cells. LPA treatment increased the amount of active Rho, compared to control and Y-27632 treatment. Conclusion: These results indicate that Rho may play an essential role in the regulation of contraction and dilation of SEF through the actomyosin system. Disclosures: Analysis of visual-evoked response patterns suggests that GABAergic tone is increased in brain in liver failure and that this is a major cause of hepatic encephalopathy (Schafer et al., troenterolow 86:540-545,1984) . However, the precise mechanisms responsible have eluded researchers in this area for the last two decades. Studies in brain tissue from both human and experimental animals with liver failure have consistently shown that GABA synthesis, GABA receptors and their associated benzodiazepine modulatory sites are intact and that expression of the subunit proteins of the GABA-A receptor complex are unchanged (Zwingmann et al., Hevatologv 37420-428,2003; Ahboucha et al., Neurochem. Int., 2003) . On the other hand, there is emerging evidence to suggest that neurosteroids (NS), a novel class of compounds with potent GABA agonist properties are increased in brain in endstage chronic liver failure in humans (Ahboucha et al., Hepatola 36: 318A, 2002) . In order to further assess this possibility, NS concentrations were measured using a sensitive radioassay in samples of frontal cortex obtained at autopsy from 15 cirrhotic patients who died in hepatic coma compared to an equal number of controls matched for age, gender, and autopsy delay intervals. Patient material contained up to 12-fold increases of NS and subsequent analysis by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry showed that the major component NS with positive allosteric properties at the GABA-A receptor was allopregnanolone. Patient material did not contain significantly increased concentrations of either GABA or benzodiazepines. In a separate series of experiments, NS concentrations were found elevated up to 2-fold (p<0.02) in brains of rats following end-to-side portacaval anastomosis (PCA) and 5.2-fold (p<O.Ol) in brains of rats following hepatic devascularization (PCA followed by hepatic artery ligation) compared to sham-operated controls. Administration of inhibitors of the NS synthesis enzyme 3-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (trilostane or indomethacin) resulted in dose-dependent reductions in brain concentrations of allopregnanolone and a concomitant improvement in locomotor activity scores in PCA rats. Together, these findings offer unequivocal evidence that NS with positive allosteric modulatory properties are generated in brain in both human and experimental liver failure and that these substances contribute to the \"increased GABAergic tone\" characteristic of hepatic encephalopathy. Pharmacological agents aimed at reduction of NS synthesis or modulation of the NS site on the GABA-A receptor complex could afford effective novel therapeutic strategies in the treatment of hepatic encephalopathy [Funded by CIHR Canada] ABSTRACT Primary hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the most common malignancies, ranks fi&h in frequency among all cancers worldwide, and causes over 1 million deaths annually. Although a number of oncogenes and alterations in signaling pathways have been identified in HCC, current treatment for this liver tumor is largely ineffective and has poor patient prognosis. One of the potentially curative approaches in HCC therapy is based on interfering with HCC progression by blocking cell division. In regenerating liver, expression of the proliferation-specific Forkhead Box m l b (Foxmlb) transcription factor is reactivated prior to hepatocyte DNA replication and its levels are sustained throughout the period of hepatocyte proliferation. Deletion of the Foxmlb fllfl (LoxP targeted) allele using Albumin promoterlenhancer driven-Cre recombinase (Alb-Cre) transgene resulted in significant reduction in regenerating hepatocyte proliferation, which was associated with diminished expression of cell-cycle promoting Cdc25A and Cdc25B phosphatases and increased nuclear levels of cyclin dependent kinase (Cdk) inhibitor p21Cipl protein. In order to test the hypothesis that Foxmlb is required for the development of HCC, we subjected Alb-Cre Foxmlb -/-mice and Foxmlb fllfl (control) mice to a Diethylnitrosamine (DEN)lPhenobarbital (W) liver tumor induction protocol. Our data demonstrated that Alb-Cre Foxmlb -Imice are highly resistant to liver tumor formation as evidenced by their failure to develop either hepatic adenomas or HCC following 33 weeks of DENlPB tumor induction protocol. In contrast, at 23 weeks following DEN/PB tumor induction protocol, Foxmlb fllfl livers displayed a large number of adenomas that progressed to HCC by 33 weeks following DEN/PB treatment. The Alb-Cre Foxmlb -Iliver displayed enzyme-altered foci as evidenced by protein expression of the Glutathione-S-Transferase placental isoform. However, Alb-Cre Foxmlb -/hepatocytes failed to develop hyper-proliferative foci, whereas abundant BrdU labeling was found in hepatic adenomas and HCC of DENlPB treated Foxmlb fllfl mice. This reduced DNA replication of Foxmlb -/-hepatocytes was associated with increased nuclear levels of the Cdk inhibitor p27Kipl protein. Furthermore, Foxmlb fllfl tumors expressed high nuclear levels of M-phase promoting Cdc25B protein, while undetectable nuclear levels of Cdc25B were found in Foxmlb -Ihepatocytes after DEN/PB treatment. The Cdc25B phosphatase is required for mitosis because it activates the M-phase promoting Cyclin B-Cdkl complex, and its increased expression is a prognostic marker for a variety of aggressive tumors. Consistent with this finding, Foxmlb -/-hepatocytes failed to enter mitosis following DENlPH tumor induction protocol and this was associated with accumulation of large polyploid hepatocytes. These studies demonstrate that Foxmlb is required for the proliferative expansion of hepatic tumors, suggesting that Foxmlb can be used as a potential target in treatment of patients with HCC.
