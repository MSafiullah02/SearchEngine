Members of the NIR team need to be appropriately fitted with the N95 mask and be aware as to how to obtain all appropriate PPE as N95s may be stored in secure environments. Those who have facial hair or cannot tolerate an N95 must be trained to use a powered air purifying respirator (PAPR) or follow alternative institutional protocols.

While there may be a theoretical risk of increasing surgical site infections (SSIs) in a negative-pressure environment, this may be outweighed by the benefits of minimizing the exposure of clean areas to infectious matter. 12 If a facility has 2 NIR suites, one should become the designated suite for COVID+/PUI patients and the other for documented COVID-19-negative patients. The inventory in the COVID-19designated suite should remain in closed storage closets at all times, or a barrier such as plastic sheets could be secured to cover the inventory. Infrequently used inventory should be removed from the suite and could be stored in the control room or an adjacent anteroom.",
