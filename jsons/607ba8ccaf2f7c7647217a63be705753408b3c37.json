Low-resource countries with weakened healthcare systems are likely to become overwhelmed with a sudden surge of cases due to exponential growth and community transmission. Therefore, it becomes all the more imperative to consider measures such as social distancing and complete lockdowns with a great deal of seriousness, in order to \"flatten the curve\" and prevent hospitals from being overburdened. Healthcare providers should be recruited in critical care management depending upon their skill set and confidence level. 4 Redeployed dermatologists should not be expected to make critical decisions in patient management or carry out complex procedures such as ventilator management. They should receive training in simple procedures such as vascular access, straightforward intubations, proning maneuvers, and fluid management in uncomplicated patients in order to take off some of the pressure from ICU staff. As the focus shifts from containment efforts to disease mitigation, the healthcare community must step up as a whole to lend its expertise as never before.",

This confirms the altruistic mentality of physicians as they are not averse to stepping outside of their comfort zones for the greater good of society. 5 These are exceptional times that call for exceptional measures. Our patients need us to move out of our comfort zones and heed the clarion call for \"all hands on deck\" in order to defeat COVID-19. ",

Many dermatologists have not dealt with critical patients for years and should not be expected to retool themselves in a flash. 3 Medical boards and critical care associations must provide refresher training in various aspects of critical care to dermatologists.There is an urgent need to initiate training of redeployed dermatologists and other physicians now and not after hospitals and intensive care units (ICUs) become overwhelmed with patients.",
