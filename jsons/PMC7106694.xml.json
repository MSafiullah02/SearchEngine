In areas of moderate to high transmission intensity, severe life-threatening malaria mainly affects infants and toddlers, as immunity against severe disease is acquired at a young age after a few malaria episodes [1\u20133]. Young children who have acquired immunity to severe infections are still susceptible to less severe malaria episodes and immunity against these gradually forms during childhood [4]. This development of immunity can be explained by a gradual acquisition of IgG against variable polymorphic proteins expressed on the surface of infected erythrocytes [5\u20139]. Members of the P. falciparum Erythrocyte Membrane Protein 1 (PfEMP1) family are considered main targets of this immunity. These proteins are anchored in the erythrocyte membrane exposing their large N-terminal to engage with receptors on endothelial cells (reviewed in [10]). This permits an effective sequestration of infected erythrocytes to the endothelial lining and allows these cells to escape blood flow and splenic filtration. On the erythrocyte surface, PfEMP1 is accessible to antibodies functionally inhibiting the binding between the infected erythrocyte and the endothelium. These antibodies are thought to be important mediators of immunity [11\u201314].",

Despite their extensive sequence diversity, the distribution of different PfEMP1 types is similar in all parasites [16]. PfEMP1s are composed of two to nine Duffy Binding-like (DBL) and cysteine-rich interdomain region (CIDR) domains, and in most PfEMP1 the second domain from the N-terminus is a CIDR domain [16]. These domains have diversified to confer binding to either endothelial protein C receptor (EPCR) (CIDR\u03b11 domains) [17], CD36 (CIDR\u03b12\u20136 domains), or unknown receptors (CIDR\u03b2/\u03b3/\u03b4 domains). These mutually exclusive binding phenotypes are maintained by chromosomal separation of the encoding genes, with so-called group B and C var genes encoding CD36-binding PfEMP1 and group A genes encoding EPCR-binding PfEMP1 and CIDR\u03b2/\u03b3/\u03b4-domain PfEMP1. In addition, most parasites carry one to three variants of the so-called DC8 group B/A chimeric var genes also encoding EPCR-binding PfEMP1 [18].",

No other PfEMP1 domain is consistently associated with severe malaria pathology [19\u201321]. However, CIDR\u03b11-PfEMP1 are large multi-domain molecules, and it is likely that endothelial receptor-interactions of some accompanying domains act in concert with EPCR-binding to promote parasite survival. For example, current evidence suggests that supplementary binding to ICAM1 or HABP1 is associated with EPCR binding by group A [21, 22] and B/A PfEMP1 [23], respectively. PfEMP1 binding to EPCR abrogates EPCR-mediated conversion of protein C to activated protein C, which promotes a pro-inflammatory state of the endothelium prone to thrombin-induced expression of endothelial cell adhesion molecules including the Intercellular Adhesion Molecule 1 (ICAM1) [24, 25].",

The EPCR binding mechanism of the CIDR\u03b11 domain mimics that of activated protein C to EPCR, indicating that an evolutionary stalemate has been reached, in which neither the parasite or human protein can mutate its basic structure without compromising its vital function. However, immune selection pressure has imposed extensive sequence diversity across surface exposed amino acids on the CIDR\u03b11 domain, albeit limited to variation maintaining structure and the physio-chemical properties of the amino acids directly interacting with EPCR. As a result, EPCR-binding CIDR\u03b11 sequence variants distribute into six subgroups, CIDR\u03b11.1 and CIDR\u03b11.4\u20131.8, of which CIDR\u03b11.1 and 1.8 are found in group B/A PfEMP1 and the rest among group A PfEMP1. The EPCR-binding site is essentially comprised of a ~ 25 amino acid kinked alpha-helix structure protruding from a core triple helix structure [26]. Across the 19 kDa minimal binding domain of CIDR\u03b11, sequences are pairwise 40\u2013100% identical. The average sequence identity within CIDR\u03b11 subgroups (e.g. 1.1) is 69\u201372%, but short amino acid stretches of high similarity are shared across members of different subtypes [26].",

The most heterogeneous of CIDR\u03b11 subtypes is the CIDR\u03b11.4 and CIDR\u03b11.7 domains, to which it appears to be particularly difficult to elicit cross-ractive antibodies. Vaccines presenting antigens on Virus-Like Particles (VLP) have been shown to induce high tittered, long lasting functional IgG responses in humans [29, 30] and can drive immune responses even to weakly immunogenic or self-antgens [31, 32]. We, and others, have recently developed a technique that allows effective coupling of complex proteins to pre-formed VLP and demonstrated that the IgG response to the proteins coupled is potent, functional, and durable even with self-antigens [31, 33, 34]. Here, VLP-CIDR\u03b11.4 vaccines adjuvanted with aluminum hydroxide elicited stronger immune responses than a similar soluble CIDR\u03b11 vaccine in Freund\u2019s incomplete adjuvant, and antibodies reactive and functionally inhibitory across group A CIDR\u03b11 variants was elicited from immunization with a single CIDR\u03b11 antigen variant.",

Parasites causing severe malaria mainly express PfEMP1 binding EPCR and increasing proportions of EPCR-binding parasites appears to be associated with increase with severity of symptoms. No other PfEMP1 domain or trait shows this association [20, 21, 39\u201344], despite all PfEMP1 carrying additional domains capable of interacting with host receptors. This strong association may be tied to the observation that CIDR\u03b11 binding to EPCR disrupts EPCR function, triggering endothelial inflammation and vascular leakage, characteristic for the pathology of severe malaria [45]. Children in malaria endemic areas develop immunity to severe malaria after relatively few infections coinciding with the acquisition of antibodies to CIDR\u03b11 [9, 46]. For these reasons, CIDR\u03b11 is considered an important target for vaccines protecting against clinical and particularly severe malaria [47].",

Based on amino acid sequence, the domains can be divided into six subclasses (1.1, and 1.4\u20131.8), each of which contain many different sequence variants. Despite the considerable amino acid variation, the protein structure and molecular basis of the interaction with EPCR is maintained across CIDR\u03b11 domains [26]. Immunity to severe malaria is acquired relatively fast, which suggests that natural infection can induce IgG, targeting a relatively broad panel of CIDR\u03b11 types. This notion is supported by the fact that IgG purified from malaria-exposed children and by affinity for a single CIDR\u03b11.1 variant, can inhibit the EPCR-binding of distant CIDR\u03b11.4 variants and vice versa [26]. The complexity of these antibody pools remains unknown. However, as short 63-mer peptides spanning the EPCR binding site was used for affinity purification in these studies, the data suggest that inhibitory antibodies interact with similar epitopes at or near the EPCR-binding site of different CIDR\u03b11 variants [26].",

This was also seen in previous studies [27, 28], where animals were vaccinated with soluble recombinant CIDR\u03b11 domains or live attenuated adenovirus inducing in vivo CIDR\u03b11 protein secretion. In these studies, induction of cross-reactive antibodies was most clearly demonstrated by vaccination using two CIDR\u03b11.1 domains resulting in antibodies reactive to 11 of 14 group B/A (CIDR\u03b11.1 and CIDR\u03b11.8) antigen variants [27]. The group B/A PfEMP1 are encoded by a set of chimeric var genes originating from group A and B var gene recombination events 5\u2032 to the CIDR\u03b11 sequence. Due to the opposite directions of transcription of group A vs. B and B/A var genes, these var gene subfamilies are likely to have evolved separately. Within group A PfEMP1, CIDR\u03b11 domains have diverged into groups, with CIDR\u03b11.4 and 1.7 variants being the closest related. Within subgroups CIDR\u03b11 domains are typically 65\u201375% pairwise identical [16]. Between group A and B/A, CIDR\u03b11 variants are on average 46% pairwise identical. The data presented here, indicate that immunization with a group A CIDR\u03b11 mainly elicited cross-binding inhibitory antibodies against other group A CIDR\u03b11 variants. This suggests that group B/A and group A CIDR\u03b11 domains, to a certain extent comprise two separate serogroups. It was not possible from the present data to identify shared specific epitopes responsible for recognition and inhibition across variants.",

The best examples are the HPV vaccines, which after two immunizations elicit IgG maintained at stable levels for decades [29, 30]. Recently, methods that enable coupling of complex antigens to pre-formed VLP have been developed, employing the SpyTag/SpyCatcher conjugation system [31, 33, 34]. Employed in mice, these VLP vaccines have induced high and stable IgG levels against microbial antigens, including malaria antigens [48\u201351]. The VLP system secures a dense presentation of the vaccine antigen keeping an identical orientation on a rigid virus particle. The dense and repetitive presentation of antigens in their native conformation can override B cell tolerance and thus may alter not only the strength and longlivity of the response, but potentially also the epitopes targeted. In the case of CIDR\u03b11 antigens, VLP presentain could therefore potentially alter the breadth of the immuneresponse to a broader reactivity across the protein family.",
