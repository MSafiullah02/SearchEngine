            "text": "Despite these environmental implications and the substantial public health concerns, biomass identity, distribution, and abundance in the atmosphere and in indoor air have been poorly described. Certainly, this is not consistent with analytical perspectives of aerosol chemistry or the understanding of microorganisms in aquatic environments and potable water supplies. There are three reasons contributing to this knowledge gap. First, atmospheric sciences have traditionally been paired with the analytical chemistry efforts needed to investigate the air pollution of the industrial age. A consequence of this tradition is that extensive chemical rather than biological characterization of the atmosphere exists and that few scientists or engineers have complementary aerosol and biotechnology skill sets. The second reason is the difficulty in detecting airborne microorganisms due to their dilute nature (Roy and Milton, 2004). For microorganisms, the atmosphere is an extreme and oligotrophic environment, and compared with sampling practices for food, aquatic, and terrestrial environments, microorganism collection from ambient air presents a significant technological challenge. Bioaerosol sampling equipment has collection efficiencies less than 100%, and these efficiencies vary significantly with the aerodynamic diameter of airborne particulate matter. Further, conventional collection devices that harvest particulate matter from air introduce significant sampling stresses, which can substantially reduce the viability and/or culturability of a broad range of airborne microorganisms (Buttner et al., 1997; Stewart et al., 1995).",

            "text": "The final reason for the relatively limited understanding of aerosol microbial ecology is a direct result of the poor integration of biotechnology with aerosol science. Conventional culturing methods, such as plate counts, continue to be the most widely used method in aerobiology investigations (ACGIH, 1999). While culturing still fills an important role in aerosol studies, particularly with pure culture investigations that isolate intrinsic responses of airborne microorganisms and determine the viability or infectivity potential, the ecological bias introduced by culture-based microbiological assays has been well documented (Woese, 1987). Less than 1% of bacteria from terrestrial and aquatic environments can be recovered by enrichment culture (Amann et al., 1995; Pace, 1997). In many of these environments, the majority of the cells are believed to be viable but do not form colonies on agar plates. Based on bioaerosol studies that have measured both total and culturable microorganisms, this low recovery of culturable microorganisms also extends into the atmospheric environment (Table 1\n). The strong reliance on culturing has also limited the types of bioaerosols that can be studied. The etiological agents of many infectious airborne diseases have never been detected in the environment, and there is still uncertainty in the transmission modes for many airborne diseases (Samet, 2004). For example, common infectious airborne agents such as Pneumocystis carinii cannot be cultured (Wakefield, 1996). Even though more than one million people die of tuberculosis each year, and one third of the world's population has been exposed to the causative agent Mycobacterium tuberculosis (WHO, 2004), we are aware of no studies in the peer reviewed literature to confirm the culture-based detection of viable M. tuberculosis from an ambient air sample. Further, culture-based techniques do not apply for assaying allergenic fractions of plants and insects, and recent application of quantitative PCR allergenic fungi in house dust suggested that culturing may underestimate concentrations by 2\u20133 orders of magnitude (Meklin et al., 2004). Finally, the number of environmental bioaerosol studies reporting on the analysis of airborne viruses is markedly less than those targeting other microorganisms. Classical cell culture assays are the most common type of virus enumeration technique. However, many virus particles do not yet have cell culture assays, and the low efficiencies associated with recovering submicron viral particles in liquid impingers (Willeke et al., 1998) result in the necessity to sample for viruses on filters. Filter recovery has limitations, since dessication incurred during collection may strongly contribute to significant infectivity losses and the consequent inability to detect viruses by cell culture analysis (Agranovski et al., 2004). In their extensive review of viral aerosols, Sattar and Ijaz (1997) strongly state that proper studies on the airborne spread of many human viruses have not been possible because many viruses cannot be readily cultured using standard laboratory techniques.",

            "text": "In the last 15 years, techniques used to study microorganisms in the environment have dramatically expanded due to the ability to detect and identify microorganisms and viruses by DNA or RNA sequence comparison (Pace, 1997). This advance has been made possible by polymerase chain reaction (PCR), an enzymatic reaction in which a sequence of DNA (usually a specific gene or portion of a gene) is selected and multiple copies produced. Using carefully designed DNA primers, a genetic sequence representing a specific microorganism, a group of microorganisms, or a microbial function can be targeted, amplified, quantified, and sequenced. The resulting sequences can then be analyzed directly and compared with existing public databases for identification, or processed for population fingerprinting, microarray analysis, or clone library analysis. PCR can only be performed on DNA sequences. RNA amplification is achieved by first converting RNA to DNA through a reverse transcriptase process and then PCR amplifying the resultant DNA. The advantages of PCR-based techniques for aerosols include the remarkable sensitivity and the unambiguous bioaerosol detection and identification that can be made independent of culturing, thus circumventing the sampling and aerosol-type limitations previously described. The PCR method is general, as it can be applied to any biological matter that contains nucleic acids, such as fungi, viruses, bacteria, and many types of allergens. The elimination of culturing pathogens removes the need for specialized labs to perform cell cultures that require extensive biosafety infrastructure not common in aerosol laboratories. Finally, PCR-based methods also have the potential to provide results more rapidly than culturing techniques\u2014on the order of hours as compared to days or weeks.",

Approximately 30% of all peer-reviewed aerosol research papers that included PCR as a main analytical tool were published after 2004, and greater than 80% of these papers have been published since the year 2000. This progress on PCR-based application and the resulting understanding of biomass in the atmosphere will continue only if these molecular tools become more approachable to the aerosol science community. Accordingly, the goal of this review is to identify practical protocols and the previous barriers associated with the application of PCR technology to characterize atmospheric and indoor aerosols. The intention here is not to focus on the details of the polymerase chain reaction or the population analysis methods, as these methods are the same for water, soil, or clinical samples and robust protocols are published elsewhere and referenced here. The focus of the review is to provide an overview of the sampling and sample processing methods that are specifically tailored to efficient DNA recovery and nucleic acid amplification of microorganisms retained in aerosol samples, with consideration given to the most recent literature examples. Further, the aerosol scientist not familiar with these molecular biology techniques, and the molecular biologist not familiar with aerosol sampling, may find enabling information here that is currently retained by only a few specialized labs involved with both aerobiology and PCR. Finally, a generalized procedure is provided to aid in making this technique more approachable, successful, and common in aerosol arenas.",

Consequently, an inherent requirement for performing PCR on aerosol samples is to concentrate the dilute biological aerosol. As with all aerosol samples, quantity, capture efficiency, and size resolution are also important considerations. An additional unique and critical consideration for bioaerosol monitoring is the ability to remove all biological matter from the sampler before reusing, as PCR is highly sensitive and a small amount of contamination\u20141 target cell or 1 fg of DNA\u2014can result in a false positive response. PCR-based methods do not provide information independent from bioaerosol culturability or infectivity; thus, ensuring that a collection process does not compromise viability is of less concern. The three most common methods for sampling bioaerosols for both culturable and PCR-based studies are impaction onto solid media, impaction into a liquid (impingement), and filtration (Table 2). The distribution of sampling methods in previous aerosol PCR-based studies is 20%, 24%, and 56% for impaction, liquid impingement, and filtration, respectively.",

All glass liquid impingers avoid desiccation artifacts and impart the lowest sampling stress of currently marketed bioaerosol samplers so that culturing can be concurrent with PCR-based analyses. The flow rate for common impingers is 12.5 L min\u22121\u2014the approximate breathing rate of humans, and cells are impinged into a 15\u201320 mL volume of collection fluid. While the size ranges of both bacteria and fungi suggest efficient collection via impingement (collection efficiency is near 100% above 0.6 \u03bcm aerodynamic diameter; Willeke et al., 1998), liquid impingers are more commonly used for bacteria, since many fungal spores are hydrophobic and may impinge with low efficiency (Eduard and Heederik, 1998). Individual or agglomerated virus particle collection (diameters between 0.01 and 0.3 \u03bcm) via liquid impingent is possible, but collection efficiency declines rapidly with aerodynamic diameters less than 0.5 \u03bcm (Willeke et al., 1998). The disadvantages of common liquid impingers include the low flow rate, the limited amount of time that impingers can be operated before the collection fluid is changed (although this may be extended with the use of a more viscous, nonevaporative collection fluid; Lin et al., 2000), and their inability to discriminate between such relevant respirable size ranges as PM10 and PM2.5.",

Size discrimination can be achieved by the addition of a cyclone with a specific aerodynamic diameter cut point in front of the filter apparatus. Material type is selected to optimize collection, and elution/analysis and commonly includes polycarbonate, polytetrafluoroethyline (PTFE), polyvinylchloride, or mixed cellulose ester. Collected bioaerosols can be eluted from membranes and used in culture-independent methods, such as microscopic direct counts or PCR-based analysis (Alvarez et al., 1995; Palmgren et al., 1986). The loss in viability of vegetative bacteria during filter collection has been well documented, although bacterial and fungal spores show a much higher survival rate than vegetative bacteria and viruses (Agranovski et al., 2004; Jensen et al., 1992; Palmgren et al., 1986). Filter collection efficiency for a variety of materials and pore sizes is typically greater than 95% for particles as small as 0.035 \u03bcm in diameter (Lee and Mukund, 2001), and therefore, filters allow for the efficient collection of a wide variety of bioaerosols ranging from large fungi and pollens to airborne viruses and particulate biotoxins. Pore sizes used in fungi and bacteria collection have ranged from 0.2 to 1 \u03bcm (Mastorides et al., 1997; Wilson et al., 2002; Zeng et al., 2004) while pore sizes for filters used for virus collection have ranged from 0.1 to 2.0 \u03bcm (Bej et al., 1991; McCluskey et al., 1996; M\u00e9ndez et al., 2004; Myatt et al., 2004; Sawyer et al., 1994). While environmental airborne viruses and bacteriophages have been detected by cell culture in air via liquid impingers (Pillai et al., 1996) and impactors filled with fluid (Carducci et al., 1999), the successful PCR detection of viruses from air has been most commonly from the collection of samples on filters (McCluskey et al., 1996; Myatt et al., 2004; Sawyer et al., 1994).",

The development of high-volume samplers designed specifically for bioaerosols is undergoing a dramatic expansion in response to biological warfare and bioterrorism concerns. High-volume biosamplers, such as the Spincon\u00ae (Sceptor Industries, Inc., Kansas City, MO), the BioCapture\u00ae 650 Air Sampler (Meso Systems, Inc., Kennewick, WA), and volumetric aerosol concentrators such as the Microvic\u00ae (Meso Systems), are commercially available and operate at greater than 500 L min\u22121 in a liquid impingement format (although their cost may be 10\u2013200 times that of glass liquid impingers). The ASAP sampler (Rupprect and Patashnick Co., Inc., East Greenbush, NY) collects by impaction onto foam, and like high-volume impingers, it is also marketed to allow for both culturable analysis and the collection of cells for DNA extraction and subsequent PCR-based analysis. Beyond cost, the key limitation to these samplers is a lack of performance data. In contrast to the conventional impingers and impactors (An et al., 2004; Juozaitis et al., 1994; Lin et al., 2000), there is a paucity of collection efficiency performance data and limited peer-reviewed reports available for the new generation of high-volume samplers. One exception is the collection efficiency for particles of mean aerodynamic diameters of 0.5, 1, and 2.5 \u03bcm reported for the Reuter Centrifugal agar strip samplers (RCS High Flow, Biotest Diagnostics Corp., Denville, NJ) (An et al., 2004).",

In some previous studies, viral particles or cells have been eluted directly in a mild lysis buffer (Myatt et al., 2004; Paez-Rubio et al., 2005). The agitation methods of eluting fungal or bacterial cells or viral particles from filters include rapid vortexing, placement on an orbital shaker table, or sonication (McCullough et al., 1998; M\u00e9ndez et al., 2004; Palmgren et al., 1986). Elution times depend upon mechanical agitation methods and are typically on the order of minutes for vortexing and hours for placement on orbital shaker tables. It is critical that filters are removed after elution and not subjected to DNA extraction reagents. This important observation was reported in a PCR optimization study that systematically compared the level of detection associated with common filter materials, including PFTE, polycarbonate, or mixed cellulose ester filters (Bej et al., 1991). The comparisons in this case were made for samples in which the filter was not eluted; rather, it was placed in the DNA extraction buffer and carried all the way through to the PCR reaction. Only PTFE filters (hydrophobic were better than hydrophilic) allowed for detectable PCR amplification of samples containing 1\u201310 cells. Other studies have demonstrated that when polycarbonate filters were eluted and removed before the cell lysis step, DNA detection limits of 1\u201310 cells result (Wan et al., 2004; Wu et al., 2002a; Zeng et al., 2004).",

            "text": "Due to the low number of microorganisms in most aerosols and the desire for quantitative results, the extraction of DNA or RNA from environmental samples must also be efficient, not damage the DNA or RNA target, and provide nucleic acid that is free of PCR-inhibiting compounds. Nucleic acid extraction consists of cell lysis and nucleic acid purification. Lysis is the disruption of a cell or spore wall or virus coating and the corresponding release of genomic DNA or RNA. Enzymatic, chemical, or physical methods or a combination of these methods are used to disrupt cell walls and virus coatings, and are typically accompanied by a detergent such as SDS to aid in releasing the nucleic acid from disrupted cells. The lysis protocol may be tailored to the target microorganism. If a single microorganism is targeted and possesses a weak cell wall, such as the Gram-negative Neisseria meningitides or Haemophilus influenzae, then a strong surfactant coupled with enzymatic disruption of protein and polysaccharides may be a suitable lysis method. Many commercially available kits, which typically use less stringent chemical lysis procedures, can be useful for this purpose. More typically in aerosols, the stronger Gram- positive bacterial and fungal spore cell walls necessitate a more robust lysis method. This involves incubation with lysozyme to hydrolyze the polysaccharide components of cell walls and incubation with protein lytic enzymes, such as Proteinase K, to cleave peptide bonds in cell wall proteins. These enzymatic preparations are often followed by the use of surfactants such as hexacetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) or SDS (3\u20135%) to break up and dissolve cell wall lipids. For most environmental bacteria and fungi, an additional step such as high-energy agitation with micron-sized beads (bead beating) or rapid freeze-thaw cycling is necessary for complete cell wall disruption. Indeed, the use of these physical disruption steps has been associated with 99% cell disruption in environmental samples (Freeman et al., 2002) and large increases in DNA yields from soils and aerosol samples (Haugland et al., 2002, Zhou et al., 1996, Miller et al., 1999). Other researchers, however, have cautioned that methods such as bead beating and sonication can shear genomic DNA into fragments (Miller et al., 1999; Picard et al., 1992) and that these fragments may lead to either incomplete PCR amplification or chimera (PCR amplicon composed of DNA from different, multiple microorganisms) production. Miller and coworkers describe speeds and times for bead beating that reduce this fragmentation (Miller et al., 1999), and extraction by sonication is not recommended. Clearly described protocols exist for thorough cell wall lysis for small quantities of fungi (Haugland et al., 2002; Schabereiter-Gurtner et al., 2001) and all bacteria (Frank et al., 2003), and both have been employed successfully in aerosol studies.",

            "text": "The second step in nucleic acid extraction is purification, the process of separating DNA from cell lysates (proteins, carbohydrates, and lipids) and other environmental contaminants. This step is necessary to avoid interferences in nucleic acid measurement and enzymatic inhibition of the PCR reaction (Alvarez et al., 1995; Dean et al., 2005; Haugland et al., 2005). DNA or RNA purification is a two-stage process in which nucleic acid is first separated from protein typically using a phenol:chloroform extraction. During this first step, cell lysate is mixed with a 1:1 phenol:chloroform mixture. Proteins partition into the organic (chloriform) phase while nucleic acids are extracted into the top aqueous (phenol) phase and removed. DNA or RNA is recovered from the phenol by cold precipitation in ethanol. The precipitated nucleic acid is then collected by centrifugation. Difficulties can arise in precipitating and collecting very small amounts of nucleic acid, although precipitation can be improved by the addition of tRNA or glycogen to samples (Williams et al., 2001). Alternatively, purification of nucleic acid can be achieved through the use of microcentrifuge spin columns that take advantage of silica\u2013nucleic acid binding. Many column manufactures exist (Qiagen, Inc., Freemont, CA; Sephadex\u00ae Products, Sigma Chemical Co., St. Louis, MO; Mo Bio Laboratories, Inc., Carlsbad, CA; Promega, Inc., Madison, WI). During column purification, cell lysate, usually with a high ethanol content, is loaded onto columns with high affinity for nucleic acids. The column is cleaned by several rinses in ethanol, and then DNA and RNA is eluted using a small volume (50 \u03bcL or less) of water or buffer. Recovery of DNA or RNA by filter column is at least as efficient as the phenol:chloroform/ethanol precipitation method.",

There is strong evidence that both lysis and nucleic acid purification steps are necessary in processing aerosol samples for PCR. Recent aerosol studies independently concluded that inhibitory compounds produced by either fungal cell lysates or by the environmental matrix (dust or particulate matter) can significantly inhibit PCR, and that these compounds and their associated inhibition can be removed by nucleic acid purification techniques such as phenol:chloroform extraction with ethanol precipitation (Dean et al., 2005; Williams et al., 2001) or by using spin columns with cleanup and elution (Haugland et al., 2002).

In a related study, PCR was compromised by significant inhibition, which correlated with aerosol biological concentrations (Alvarez et al., 1995). In liquid impinger samples that were seeded with Escherichia coli DH1 cells, as few as 10 cells were detected using nested PCR when samplers were operated outdoors, and 2.1\u00d7102\n CFU m\u22123 environmental bacteria were collected. In cases where a greater number of environmental microorganisms were collected (4\u00d7103\n CFU m\u22123), PCR was inhibited when 10\u2013102 CFU were purposely spiked into the collection device. Successful PCR amplification was restored to \u201cpre-spike\u201d levels in this sample by serial dilution (greater than 10 times) of the impinger collection fluid to remove most of the inhibition. Indeed, in many cases, inhibition of PCR amplification can be significantly reduced by simply diluting the purified DNA extract.",

Given the sensitive nature of PCR, issues relating to contamination are common. Equipment and reagents must be free of any contaminant cells or nucleic acids. Because the viability of a cell is not required for PCR, the common sterilization measure of autoclaving is not useful in decontaminating reagents, equipment, and samplers. Common quality assurance practice for PCR laboratories includes the following: a dedicated set of pipettors to be used only for PCR reagents, the use of aerosol filter pipette tips, use and frequent changing of powder-free gloves during all PCR steps, and the use of PCR grade reagents, water, and tubes. Finally, preparation of PCR samples in a positive pressure facility or clean room or in a laminar flow cabinet is recommended.",

The number of copies of a target gene in an environmental sample can be determined through PCR by monitoring the increase in amplicon concentration during DNA amplification then regressing to the original concentration. In practice, a quantifiable signal that is proportional to the amplicon concentration is produced at the end of each PCR cycle by a labeled probe that fluoresces when bound to the target DNA amplicon. Because fluorescent data is reported for each cycle, this type of PCR is often termed real-time PCR. The real-time PCR measurement that is critical for quantification is achieved by tracking fluorescence intensity as it progresses through successive PCR cycles up to a cycle threshold (Ct)\u2014the cycle number where a statistically relevant increase in fluorescent signal from a background is first observed (Fig. 3\n). The number of target gene copies in an environmental sample can then be determined from a calibration curve of standardized DNA solutions versus the corresponding Ct value. In all cases, a gene copy quantity can be determined. This may or may not be the same as a whole cell or virus quantity since whole genomes often contain either multiple copies of the same gene or multiple genome copies per cell. In cases where a pure culture of microorganisms is available, a calibration curve of whole cells versus Ct can be produced to circumvent this issue (Zeng et al., 2004).",

Recent studies have shown this technique to be comparable to culturing for the quantitative monitoring of Enterococcus spp. fecal indicator microorganisms in lakes (Haugland et al., 2005). As few as 27 gene copies could be reliably detected from lake samples, and a positive linear correlation was observed between quantitative PCR results and the traditional membrane plate count culture method. Quantitative real-time PCR has been extended to virus quantification in drinking water and sewage and has revealed similar advances in detection and quantification over culturing (He and Jiang, 2005). Recently, quantitative PCR has also been successfully applied to study airborne microorganisms collected from the environment. Schweigkofler and coworkers measured aerosol concentrations of the Monterey pine fungal pathogen Fusarium circinatum (Schweigkofler et al., 2004). Here, the use of PCR for quantification allowed for the selection of primers that were specific to only the relevant pathogenic Fusarium species, in contrast to the many nonpathogenic species within the genus Fusarium that may grow on a specific media and are difficult to morphologically differentiate from the pathogenic strains. Quantitative PCR has also been used to describe aerosols associated with human disease. Chen and Li (2005) measured the quantities of airborne M. tuburculosis pathogens in hospital isolation rooms. Moderate correlations of airborne M. tuberculosis concentrations and patient sputum culture or sputum smear results were observed. In cow barns and farms that handle hay and grain, quantitative real-time PCR was also used to study the aerosol concentration of the slow growing fungi Wallemia sebi, the suspected causative agent of farmer's lung (Zeng et al., 2004). In all three cases, Ct values were calibrated to a known number of fungal spores or bacteria cells. Detection levels were below 100 cells. In each bioaerosol study listed above, researchers reported an enhanced ability to detect the fungal spores and bacteria by using quantitative PCR compared with conventional culturing. This enhancement came through either a more rapid or accurate quantification or qualitatively by the ability to control detection to target a very specific phylogenetic grouping.",

This is precisely the type of information needed in exposure\u2013response epidemiological studies. Thus, PCR holds promise in moving bioaerosol study away from indicator microorgansisms such as total fungi or heterotrophic plate counts and toward analysis of microorganisms with specifically known health effects. In cases where infectivity or viability information is necessary, parallel cell culture or infectivity studies must also be performed. Issues such as DNA extraction efficiency, PCR inhibition, and gene copy number in specific microorganisms diminish the ability to make precise quantification with this technique in environmental samples and must be controlled or accounted for where possible. The strong need for quantitative information is driving improvements in quantitative PCR methodology and data analysis. While quantitative PCR can be precise, between \u00b16%\u201321% (Rutledge, 2003) the accuracy and can be limited by reagent and operator variability and a lack of standardization in data analysis (Burns et al., 2005; Bustin, 2002). Commonly the accuracy has been questioned when using the cycle threshold method due to different amplification efficiencies between the clean samples used to construct standard curves and the environmental samples to which they are compared (Meijerink et al., 2001). A recently suggested improvement to this problem is the use of a sigmoidal curve-fitting method to first calculate an original fluorescence value from the real-time amplification data and then convert fluorescence to DNA copy number using standard curves of copy number versus fluorescence. This sigmoidal method removes issues associated with differing amplification efficiencies between standards and samples, and its simplicity makes possible increased throughput of samples (Rutledge, 2004).",
