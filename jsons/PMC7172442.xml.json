            "text": "Toll-like receptors were the first PRRs discovered and are thus well studied. We will only give a brief overview as they have been extensively reviewed before (Akira and Takeda, 2004; Kawai and Akira, 2010; Kawasaki and Kawai, 2014; Lester and Li, 2014; Odendall and Kagan, 2017; Takeda and Akira, 2005; Thompson et al., 2011). The TLR family has 10 members in humans, TLR1\u201310, of which TLR1, TLR2, TLR4, TLR5, and TLR6 are expressed at the plasma membrane, while TLR3, TLR7, TLR8, and TLR9 are located in endosomes (Thompson et al., 2011). Although they can be found in diverse tissues (for instance, in intestinal epithelium) and a variety of immune cells, TLRs are mainly expressed in professional antigen-presenting cells (B cells, DCs, and macrophages). Why they display restricted tissue expression is unclear but may reflect that their role is in immune surveillance rather than the detection of infection per se. As professional cell sensors they are well placed to both activate the innate cellular response and promote adaptive immunity. Many TLRs were first discovered as receptors for bacterial PAMPs. For instance, TLR4 is the primary receptor for bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) (Lu et al., 2008), while TLR2 is activated by bacterial lipoproteins such as lipoteichoic acid (Hashimoto et al., 2006; Oliveira-Nascimento et al., 2012). Signal transduction through TLR2 also requires heterodimerization with either TLR1 or TLR6 and helps broaden ligand specificity (Farhat et al., 2007; Kang et al., 2009; Schenk et al., 2009). TLR5 is largely responsible for the innate immune response to flagellin (Hayashi et al., 2001). This pattern suggests that plasma membrane-associated TLRs are mainly responsible for the detection of invading bacteria. However, more recently, it has been shown that TLR4 and TLR2 can produce a signaling response upon infection with RSV (Murawski et al., 2009; Rallabhandi et al., 2012), and TLR2 with mouse mammary tumor virus (MMTV) and murine leukemia virus (MLV) (Villano et al., 2014), measles virus (MV) (Bieback et al., 2002), and human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) (Compton et al., 2003). These studies demonstrate that plasma membrane-bound TLRs can also sense cell-bound viruses. However, although direct binding is suggested, it is unclear how such diverse ligands are detected and what the mechanism of activation is. Of the endosomal TLRs, TLR3 has been shown to recognize dsRNA and mediate a protective response against poliovirus, coxsackievirus, and herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV1), all of which use dsRNA intermediates in their life cycle (Tatematsu et al., 2014). Additionally, TLR3 is capable of recognizing stem loop structures in ssRNA (Tatematsu et al., 2013). TLR7 and TLR8 can both sense long ssRNA, with TLR7 also capable of recognizing specific motifs in short dsRNA (Thompson et al., 2011). They have been implicated in the response to RNA viruses such as influenza (Diebold, 2004; Lund et al., 2004), coxsackie B virus (Triantafilou et al., 2005), vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) (Lund et al., 2004), and hepatitis C virus (HCV) (Lee et al., 2015; Wang et al., 2011a). Finally, TLR9 is capable of recognizing unmethylated deoxycytidylate-phosphate-deoxyguanylate (CpG) motifs, which are common in viral and bacterial DNA, but do not occur in mammalian DNA (Hemmi et al., 2000). TLR9 is important in the defense against DNA viruses such as human adenovirus (hAdV) (Zhu et al., 2007), mouse cytomegalovirus (MCMV) (Krug et al., 2004), and Epstein\u2013Barr virus (EBV) (Fiola et al., 2010). The role of TLR10 has not been elucidated yet; however, there is evidence that it functions as a negative regulator of TLR signaling and thus is an inhibitory TLR (Jiang et al., 2016; Oosting et al., 2014), while one study reported that it is involved in the immune response against influenza virus (Lee et al., 2014).",

            "text": "CLRs are mainly expressed on dendritic cells but also on other myeloid cells. They are characterized by a carbohydrate recognition domain which allows them to bind pathogen-associated carbohydrate motifs (Geijtenbeek and Gringhuis, 2009). This makes them especially important in the defense against bacteria and fungi (Drummond and Brown, 2013). A well-known CLR is DC-Specific Intercellular adhesion molecule-3-Grabbing Nonintegrin (DC-SIGN), which interacts with mannose and fucose residues on pathogen surfaces. It has since been shown that DC-SIGN can act as a receptor for numerous enveloped viruses including HIV (Geijtenbeek et al., 2000), dengue virus (DENV) (Tassaneetrithep et al., 2003), and MV (de Witte et al., 2006), through interactions with their envelope glycoproteins, exemplifying how viruses can directly exploit the host's defense mechanisms. Since CLRs are exclusively expressed on the cell surface, they will not be discussed further here but have been excellently reviewed (Dambuza and Brown, 2015; Drummond and Brown, 2013; Geijtenbeek and Gringhuis, 2009; Hoving et al., 2014; Osorio and Reis e Sousa, 2011; Sancho and Reis e Sousa, 2012).",

            "text": "Nucleotide-binding and oligomerization domain (NOD)-like receptors (NLRs) are cytosolic PPRs that mediate responses to a diverse range of PAMPs such as LPS (Kayagaki et al., 2013), flagellin (Kayagaki et al., 2013), and viral RNA (Allen et al., 2009; Li et al., 2015), but also host cell and environmental factors such as cholesterol crystals (Duewell et al., 2010) and reactive oxygen species (ROS) (Kanneganti, 2010). They are characterized by a central NACHT domain as well as a C-terminal leucine-rich repeat (LRR) and can be divided into five groups based on their N-terminal domain: NLRA (acidic activation domain), NLRB (baculoviral inhibitory repeat-like domain (BIR)), NLRC (caspase activation and recruitment domain (CARD)), NLRP (pyrin domain (PYD)), and NLRX. Activation of NLRs can result in four different effector functions: inflammasome activation, activation of innate immunity signaling pathways, transcriptional regulation, and autophagy. Inflammasome formation is mediated through members of NLRP and NLRC and results in recruitment of Caspase-1 and the release of the inflammatory cytokines IL-1\u03b2 and IL-18, as well as pyroptosis. Members of NLRP lack a CARD domain; they depend on the adaptor molecule apoptosis-associated speck-like protein (ASC), which contains a C-terminal CARD domain, for recruitment of Caspase-1. While members of the NLRC family, such as NLRC4, have a CARD domain and thus do not require ASC for direct interaction with Caspase-1, ASC is required for full activation and robust IL-1\u03b2 release (Broz et al., 2010; Lamkanfi and Dixit, 2014). Inflammasomes, especially NLRP3 inflammasomes, play an important role in the immune response to many viruses, including influenza A virus (IAV) (Ichinohe et al., 2009, Ichinohe et al., 2010), hAdV (Barlan et al., 2011), encephalomyocarditis virus (EMCV), VSV (Rajan et al., 2011), and rabies virus (Lawrence et al., 2013). Inflammasome activation by hAdV can be caused by plasma membrane and endosomal damage (Barlan et al., 2011), both of which occur during adenoviral infection (Luisoni et al., 2015), and are known triggers for the NLRP3 inflammasome (Hornung and Latz, 2010; Mu\u00f1oz-Planillo et al., 2013). Viral RNA (Allen et al., 2009) as well as RNA analogues such as polyI:C (Rajan et al., 2010) can also activate the NLRP3 inflammasome; however, the mechanism is not yet fully elucidated. It has been suggested that recognition of viral RNA results in the activation of the RIPK1\u2013RIPK3 complex which stimulates the mitochondria-associated GTPase DRP1, thus promoting mitochondrial damage and the production of ROS (Wang et al., 2014), another known trigger of the NLRP3 inflammasome (Abais et al., 2015; Heid et al., 2013). Other studies have identified DDX19A (Li et al., 2015) and DHX33 (Mitoma et al., 2013) as cytosolic RNA sensors that can interact with NLRP3, thus bridging viral RNA and the NLRP3 inflammasome. For a comprehensive overview of the role of inflammasomes in viral infection, see the following reviews: Franchi et al. (2008), Guo et al. (2015), Kanneganti (2010), Kim et al. (2016), Lamkanfi and Dixit (2014), and Thompson et al. (2011).",

The most well known are NOD1 and NOD2 (NLRCs), which recognize bacterial peptidoglycans and activate both NF-\u03baB and AP-1 signaling pathways (Franchi et al., 2009). NOD2 can also recognize viral ssRNA and mediate the production of IFN\u03b2 through MAVS (mitochondrial antiviral signaling)-dependent IRF3 activation (Sabbah et al., 2009). NLRC4 is predominately a potent inflammasome activator in response to bacterial ligands. Here, neural apoptosis inhibitory proteins (NAIPs, members of the NLRB family) act as receptors for bacterial PAMPs such as flagellin (NAIP5) or the type three secretion system (NAIP2), with NLRC4 being the adapter recruiting Caspase-1 to the NLRC4 inflammasome (Zhao and Shao, 2015; Zhao et al., 2011).",

            "text": "Retinoic acid-inducible gene I (RIG-I)-like receptors (RLRs) are PRRs present in all nucleated cells, where they are poised to detect cytosolic viral RNAs (Ireton and Gale, 2011). This expression pattern is in clear contrast to TLRs, CLRs, and NLRs and may reflect that RLRs are true sensors of infection rather than part of immune sampling and surveillance. This can also be discerned from the species of viral ligand that they detect. It has been clearly shown for influenza that it is progeny rather than incoming genomes that are detected by the RLR RIG-I (Rehwinkel et al., 2010). Thus, it is replicating virus and not merely inert particles that are being sensed. The RLR family has two other known members: melanoma differentiation-associated gene 5 (MDA5), and laboratory of genetics and physiology 2 (LGP2), which, like RIG-I, possess a central ATPase-containing DExD/H-box helicase domain (Dixit and Kagan, 2013). However, only RIG-I and MDA5 have N-terminal CARDs which are essential for initiation of signal transduction. LGP2 is thus thought to modulate RIG-I and MDA5 signaling instead of initiating signaling itself (Thompson et al., 2011). RIG-I and MDA5 both recognize viral RNA; however, while RIG-I senses small dsRNA that is characterized by a 5\u2032-triphosphate group and a 3\u2032-polyuridine-rich region, MDA5 binds long ssRNA and oligomerizes along its length (Kagan and Barton, 2014; Wu et al., 2013a). Binding of RNA to MDA5 or RIG-I leads to interaction of the N-terminal CARD with the CARD of MAVS, which is mainly located in the outer mitochondrial membrane. Upon activation, MAVS multimerizes, forming the \u201cMAVS signalosome\u201d and initiating downstream activation of NF-\u03baB and IRF3 (Koshiba, 2013). Both MDA5 and RIG-I are tightly regulated through constitutive phosphorylation of their CARDs, which prevents interaction with MAVS. Upon viral infection, both sensors are rapidly dephosphorylated which results in downstream immune signaling (Gack, 2014; Maharaj et al., 2012; Sun et al., 2011; Wies et al., 2013). Ligand-free RIG-I adopts an autorepressed conformation in which the CARDs are sequestered. Binding of RNA results in a conformational change that liberates the CARDs (Kowalinski et al., 2011; Liu et al., 2017a); however, this liberation is not thought to be sufficient for RIG-I activation and thus additional activation mechanisms exist. These include ubiquitin conjugation by the E3-ligase TRIM25 to the CARDs (Gack et al., 2007), binding of unanchored K63-linked ubiquitin chains to the CARDs (Jiang et al., 2012; Zeng et al., 2010) and ATP-dependent filamentous oligomerization of RIG-I along the dsRNA (Peisley et al., 2013). All of these mechanism allow for subsequent MAVS aggregation and it has been suggested that ubiquitin promotes the formation of a RIG-I tetramer that acts as a primer for MAVS oligomerization (Peisley et al., 2014).",

            "text": "RLRs have been implicated in the sensing of multiple RNA viruses, with RIG-I sensing viruses such as influenza (Loo et al., 2008; M\u00e4kel\u00e4 et al., 2015), rhabdoviruses (Furr et al., 2010), HCV (Saito et al., 2008), and other flaviviruses (Chang et al., 2006), and MDA5 recognizing mainly picornaviruses (Chang et al., 2006; Gitlin et al., 2006) and caliciviruses (McCartney et al., 2008). RIG-I is also capable of detecting picornavirus infection but is antagonized by the viral 3C protease (Barral et al., 2009; Papon et al., 2009). Enveloped viruses such as West Nile virus (WNV), MV, and Sendai virus (SeV) can be sensed by both MDA5 and RIG-I (Schlee, 2013). These sensing events are not necessarily redundant as it has been shown that during WNV infection MDA5 and RIG-I cooperate in sensing RNA of the replicating virus, likely by operating at different times during the viral life cycle (Errett et al., 2013). Interestingly, RIG-I can also be activated by dsDNA viruses such as HSV-1 (Rasmussen et al., 2009) or hAdV (Minamitani et al., 2011). Here, it relies on the RNA polymerase III-dependent transcription of AT-rich regions of the viral genome into dsRNA that contain a 5\u2032-triphosphate (Ablasser et al., 2009; Chiu et al., 2009). As further evidence that RLRs detect replicating pathogens, many viruses have evolved to antagonize RIG-I-dependent immune activation, as reviewed in Kell and Gale (2015).",

            "text": "Absent in melanoma (AIM)-like receptors are a relatively recently discovered family of cytosolic and nuclear DNA sensors. In humans, it consists of four members: AIM-2, interferon-\u03b3-inducible protein 16 (IFI16), myeloid cell nuclear differentiation antigen (MNDA), and pyrin and HIN domain-containing protein 1 (PYHIN1) (Gray et al., 2016). Like NLRPs, they have an N-terminal pyrin domain, but their C-terminal nucleotide-binding site is an HIN domain rather than an NACHT domain (Ratsimandresy et al., 2013). AIM2 and IFI16 are thus far the best-characterized family members. AIM2 is a potent inflammasome activator in response to cytosolic DNA. It binds DNA with its HIN domain and ASC with its pyrin domain, which results in recruitment of Caspase-1. This leads to release of IL-1\u03b2 and IL-18 as well as cell death by pyroptosis (Fernandes-Alnemri et al., 2009; Hornung et al., 2009). It has been shown to promote host defense against DNA viruses such as MCMV, vaccinia virus (VV) (Rathinam et al., 2010), and hAdV (Eichholz et al., 2016; Stein and Falck-Pedersen, 2012). IFI16 activates an alternative immune response via the ER-associated stimulator of IFN genes (STING) upon binding of dsDNA. Activation of STING promotes TBK1 activity, resulting in the induction of type I interferon (Unterholzner et al., 2010). A recent study by Gray et al. using ALR knockout mice has demonstrated that ALRs are dispensable for the IFN response to synthetic DNA as well as infection with DNA viruses and further do not contribute to the autoimmune phenotype found in Trex-1 knockout mouse models of Aicardi\u2013Gouti\u00e8res syndrome (Gray et al., 2016). However, the mouse and human ALR families are significantly divergent, with 13 members in mice and only 4 known in humans (Brunette et al., 2012; Cridland et al., 2012). Furthermore, AIM2 is the only member of the family showing true orthology between mice and humans, while IFI204, initially considered to be the murine equivalent of IFI16, is not now thought to be a true orthologue of IFI16 (Brunette et al., 2012), as two independent studies have shown that IFI16 is required for efficient DNA sensing in both human macrophages (J\u00f8nsson et al., 2017) and human keratinocytes (Almine et al., 2017) and that it cooperates with cGAS to achieve full activation of the type I IFN response.",

            "text": "The oligoadenylate synthetase (OAS)-like receptors (OLRs) are a family of viral dsRNA and dsDNA sensors, which generate immune second messengers. They are characterized by a core nucleotidyl transferase domain, but have divergent C-terminal domains that explain their different ligand specificity (Kranzusch et al., 2013). OAS 1, OAS 2, and OAS 3 are the founding members of the family. Upon recognition of viral dsRNA, they produce the secondary messenger 2\u2032-5\u2032-linked oligoadenylate, which results in dimerization and thus activation of the endoribonuclease RNaseL. RNaseL then recognizes viral (and cellular) dsRNA and degrades it (Hornung et al., 2014). This directly interferes with the viral life cycle and the generated RNA cleavage products can be recognized by RLRs, which initiates the induction of type I IFN (Malathi et al., 2007). OAS proteins have been shown to be protective against a number of RNA viruses, such as flaviviruses like HCV (Kwon et al., 2013), DENV, and WNV (Ferguson et al., 2008; Lin et al., 2009). The function of OAS-like proteins is not well elucidated as they lack an active nucleotidyl transferase domain. They have been implicated to compete with OAS proteins and thus negatively regulate the RNaseL pathway (Choi et al., 2015; Rogozin et al., 2003), although one study has shown that they positively regulate the RIG-I pathway (Choi et al., 2015; Zhu et al., 2014, Zhu et al., 2015).",

            "text": "Although only discovered in 2013 (Sun et al., 2013), cyclic GMP\u2013AMP synthase (cGAS) is now considered the pivotal dsDNA sensor in the cytosol, since it has been shown to be absolutely required for IFN signaling in response to dsDNA. Binding of cGAS to dsDNA results in the production of cyclic guanosine monophosphate\u2013adenosine monophosphate (cGAMP), which binds STING (Wu et al., 2013b). STING then dimerizes and interacts with TBK1, which phosphorylates IRF3 and thus leads to the induction of IFN\u03b2. TBK1 also activates the IKK complex, resulting in the transcription of NF-\u03baB target genes (Burdette and Vance, 2013; Sun et al., 2013). To date, cGAS has been implicated in the host's immune defense against multiple viruses, including DNA viruses such as HSV-1 (Reinert et al., 2016), hAdV (Lam et al., 2014), and HCMV (Paijo et al., 2016), and retroviruses such as HIV (Gao et al., 2014), and surprisingly the RNA virus WNV as cGAS KO mice were more susceptible to it (Cai et al., 2014; Schoggins et al., 2014). Basal ISG (interferon-stimulated gene) expression is altered upon cGAS knockout, so this apparent ability to sense an RNA virus is almost certainly an indirect effect due to the reduction in expression levels of other sensors such as RIG-I. Constitutive cGAS activity may occur through stimulation by DNA from damaged mitochondria, sequences generated from viral RNA by cellular reverse transcriptases (Lazear and Diamond, 2016; Shimizu et al., 2014), or microbial infection (Cai et al., 2014; Gough et al., 2012). It has also been shown that cGAMP can be incorporated into nascent viral particles and thus be transferred between cells, leading to a rapid type I IFN response in newly infected cells (Bridgeman et al., 2015). Presumably this occurs in parallel with the paracrine interferon response itself. Aside from cGAS, there are several other cytosolic DNA sensors that have been identified, which do not belong to the OLR family. These include DDX41, DHDX36, DHX9, DAI, and LRRFIP1; however, there is increasing evidence that many of them are dispensable for the IFN induction in response to dsDNA (Burdette and Vance, 2013; Vance, 2016).",

The most common C-terminal domain is the PRYSPRY domain, which is found in 39 human TRIM proteins and consists of an ancient PRY element and a juxtaposed SPRY element. The PRYSPRY domain mediates interactions with various ligands, such as antibody in the case of TRIM21 and retroviruses in the case of TRIM5\u03b1. Structural studies on the TRIM21 PRYSPRY domain have shown that ligand interactions occur through a canonical binding site, which consists of six variable loops, similar to antibody CDRs, whose rapid diversification may have driven the evolution of PRYSPRY domains (James et al., 2007). Other C-terminal domains include the COS-box, which has been shown to mediate interaction with microtubules; FN3 domains, which contain a DNA-binding site; PHDs, which are usually associated with chromatin-mediated transcriptional regulation; and ARF domains, which partake in intracellular trafficking; and finally MATH domains, which have been shown to be involved in receptor binding and oligomerization (Ozato et al., 2012).",

            "text": "The most widely studied antiviral TRIM is TRIM5\u03b1, which restricts HIV-1 in old world monkeys such as rhesus macaque (Stremlau et al., 2004). TRIM5\u03b1 binds to the HIV-1 capsid via its PRYSPRY domain and is thought to form a hexagonal lattice around the virus (Ganser-Pornillos et al., 2011; Li et al., 2016) via B-box oligomerization (Wagner et al., 2016). TRIM5\u03b1 restriction involves stepwise autoubiquitination (Fletcher et al., 2015) and subsequent proteasomal degradation of the viral capsid (Lukic et al., 2011; Rold and Aiken, 2008; Stremlau et al., 2006), a block to infection which occurs prior to reverse transcription. If the proteasome is inhibited or TRIM5\u03b1\u2019s RING domain, which mediates E3-ligase activity, is deleted, RT is restored; however, HIV-1 infection is still efficiently prevented (Anderson et al., 2006; Kutluay et al., 2013; Roa et al., 2012; Wu et al., 2006). Why the two separate blocks to viral infection exist is not understood. Simultaneous with restriction of HIV-1, TRIM5\u03b1 also elicits potent immune signaling via AP-1 and NF-\u03baB, which is also dependent on its E3-ligase activity (Pertel et al., 2011). Crucially, human TRIM5\u03b1 cannot restrict HIV-1, which may help to explain why the virus is so pathogenic in man. Human TRIM5\u03b1 is capable of restricting N-tropic MLV (N-MLV) and equine infectious anemia virus (EIAV) (Nisole et al., 2005; Yap et al., 2004), suggesting that it is nevertheless an active antiviral. Interestingly, in new world owl monkeys, whose TRIM5\u03b1 is also unable to restrict HIV, a retrotransposition of cyclophilin A (CypA), which binds the HIV-1 capsid, into the TRIM5 loci has generated the fusion protein TRIM-Cyp that renders owl monkeys resistant to HIV-1 infection (Sayah et al., 2004). TRIM-Cyp has also independently evolved in old world monkeys, in the macaque lineage via an exon-skipping mutation (Wilson et al., 2008). This highlights the intensive selective pressure that retroviral infection has on primate species and the selective advantage a functional TRIM protein can provide. Indeed, TRIM5\u03b1 is thought to be the fastest evolving primate gene.",

            "text": "Another TRIM that has been implicated in the restriction of HIV-1 is TRIM19 (Turelli et al., 2001). While the mechanism has not been elucidated, it has been suggested that it interferes with viral replication (Turelli et al., 2001), silences gene expression (Lusic et al., 2013; Masroori et al., 2016), or indirectly interferes with reverse transcription (Dutrieux et al., 2015). Indeed, TRIM19 has been implicated in the restriction of multiple viruses, including human HCMV, VSV, and IAV (Nisole et al., 2005). The importance of TRIM19 in viral restriction is highlighted by the fact that HSV encodes a specific antagonist in the form of ICP0, which causes the degradation of TRIM19 (PML) bodies (Boutell et al., 2003). For VSV, it has been shown that TRIM19 is able to directly restrict virus by blocking viral protein expression, while HCMV and IAV are only restricted through TRIM19\u2019s effect on type I IFN signaling. This highlights another similarity between TRIM5\u03b1 and TRIM19, namely that they are able to both restrict viral infection directly and initiate innate immune signaling. However, while the signaling activity of TRIM5\u03b1 is directly coupled to its mechanism of viral restriction, since both require K63-linked ubiquitination upon capsid recognition (Pertel et al., 2011), TRIM19 potentiates signaling indirectly, for instance, by recruiting Pin1 into nuclear bodies and interfering with Pin1-mediated degradation of IRF3 to positively regulate type I IFN signaling (El Asmi et al., 2014).",

One example of this is the potentiation of RIG-I signaling through N-terminal CARD ubiquitination by TRIM25 (Gack et al., 2007; Zeng et al., 2010). RIG-I undergoes a conformational change in response to ligand binding and dephosphorylation (see Section 1.4), which enables TRIM25 binding. It is thought that TRIM25-mediated ubiquitination of the CARDs facilitates the interaction of RIG-I and MAVS and thus modulates downstream IFN\u03b2 induction (Gack, 2014; Gack et al., 2007; Sanchez et al., 2016; Zeng et al., 2010). In this context, two studies have also found a role of TRIM4 in the ubiquitination of RIG-I in cooperation with TRIM25 (Sun et al., 2016; Yan et al., 2014).",

Interestingly, TRIM20 does not have a RING domain but instead has an N-terminal Pyrin domain and thus acts as an inflammasome activator through recruitment of ASC and subsequent activation of Caspase-1, analogous to NLRP3 and AIM2 (Latz et al., 2013; Richards et al., 2001; Yu et al., 2006). Mutations in MEFV, the gene encoding TRIM20, are associated with the autoinflammatory disease familial Mediterranean fever (FMF) (Latsoudis et al., 2017; Manukyan and Aminov, 2016; Masters et al., 2016; Park et al., 2016). The pyrin inflammasome can be activated by Rho GTPases that have been modified and inactivated by bacterial toxins (Xu et al., 2014). It is thought that Rho GTPases constitutively activate pyrin phosphorylation, which leads to the binding of inhibitory 14-3-3 proteins (Park et al., 2016). When Rho GTPases are inhibited, TRIM20 is no longer phosphorylated and becomes active. Notably, one mutation associated with FMF is S242R, which results in a loss of inhibitory 14-3-3 binding at phosphorylated S242 and might thus result in constitutive TRIM20 activation (Masters et al., 2016).",

This highlights the notion that it is important to consider immune responses in their totality rather than focusing on the contribution of any one pathway or component. In addition to the detailed cases earlier, further examples include TRIM30\u03b1, which has been shown to negatively regulate TLR-mediated TRAF6-induced NF-\u03baB activation by degrading TAB2 and TAB3 (Shi et al., 2008). A study by Hu et al. has also shown that TRIM30 negatively regulates the NLRP3 inflammasome. Knockdown of TRIM30 resulted in higher levels of IL-1\u03b2 secretion in J774 cells as well as BMDMs in response to several NLRP3 agonists. Since there is no direct interaction of TRIM30 with members of the NLRP3 inflammasome, the authors suggest that TRIM30 attenuates the production of ROS and thus NLRP3 inflammasome activation.",

TRIM27 has also been suggested to regulate NF-\u03baB signaling, via the K48-linked ubiquitination and subsequent proteasomal degradation of NOD2, thereby acting as a negative regulator of NOD2-induced NF-\u03baB signaling (Zurek et al., 2012). TRIM38 is another TRIM that has been proposed as a negative regulation of innate immune pathways through its E3-ligase activity. Several studies have shown that TRIM38 attenuates TLR signaling pathways through K48-linked ubiquitination and degradation of TRIF (Hu et al., 2015; Xue et al., 2012), TRAF6 (Zhao et al., 2012a), and NAP1 (Zhao et al., 2012b).

The cytosolic antibody receptor TRIM21 provides an excellent such exemplar for both signaling and effector TRIM function as it simultaneously restricts antibody-coated viruses and elicits potent innate immune signaling (Mallery et al., 2010; McEwan et al., 2013); hence, its mechanism will be discussed in depth in the following sections.",

            "text": "TRIM21 is the only known cytosolic IgG receptor in mammals. All other known IgG receptors capture IgG via their Fc at the plasma membrane (Fc\u03b3Rs) or within an endosome (FcRn). TRIM21 is structurally unrelated to Fc\u03b3Rs and engages a different region of IgG Fc. The PRY element of TRIM21 forms a binding pocket for the CH2 domain of the Fc region, while the SPRY domain forms a pocket for the CH3 region. Binding of the antibody molecule occurs within the canonical PRYSPRY-binding site defined by its six variable loops (see Section 2.1). There are four hot spot residues in TRIM21 that are crucial for antibody interaction and their mutation abrogates all binding: D355 proximal to VL2, W381 and W383 in VL4, and F450 in VL6. They contact three hot spot residues in the IgG-Fc, located near the C-terminus of CH3: H433, N434, and H435. The PRYSPRY residues in VL4 and VL6 form a hydrophobic ring around a bifurcated hydrogen bond that D355 forms with H433 and N434, shielding it from solvent (James et al., 2007; Keeble et al., 2008). Interestingly, while this binding site is distant from the binding site of classic Fc\u03b3Rs, it overlaps with the FcRn-binding site. FcRn is important for prolonging the half-life of IgG molecules through recycling of internalized antibodies as well as transfer of IgG from mother to fetus across the placenta. The binding of FcRn to IgG can only occur at the endosomal pH of 6.5 and is markedly reduced at pH 7.4 since FcRn binding relies on the protonation of H433 and H435, which only occurs at acidic pH (Roopenian and Akilesh, 2007; Stapleton et al., 2011). In contrast, the binding of TRIM21 is pH independent and does not require protonation. TRIM21 is capable of binding all IgG subclasses with nM affinity (Keeble et al., 2008) and has also been shown to bind IgM (Mallery et al., 2010) and IgA (Bidgood et al., 2014), however with lower affinities of 17 and 50 \u03bcM, respectively.",

In response, it mediates dual effector and sensor functions by facilitating simultaneous proteasomal degradation of virions and innate immune signaling (Fig. 1\n). The two critical prerequisites for this mechanism are virus penetration of the cytosol and exposure of antibody molecules to the cytosol. This means that not all virus/antibody combinations will be able to stimulate TRIM21; the antibody cannot block viral entry into the cells, e.g., through binding viral epitopes crucial for receptor engagement and the virus cannot gain access to the cytosol through a fusion mechanism that will result in shedding of the antibody. Therefore, most experiments elucidating viral neutralization and innate immune signaling mediated by TRIM21 have used either hAdV or mouse adenovirus 1 (MAV-1) as well as human rhinovirus 14 (HRV14), as they are nonenveloped viruses that penetrate the endosome during entry, carrying bound antibodies with them. In this review the term neutralization is used as defined by P.J.

Binding of the antibody activates the E3-ligase activity of TRIM21 through a still unknown mechanism. It is thought that TRIM21 first recruits the E2 enzyme Ube2W, which monoubiquitinates the N-terminus of TRIM21. Subsequently, the E2 enzyme complex Ube2N/Ube2V2 polyubiquitinates TRIM21 through K63 chain extension of the N-terminal ubiquitin. This mechanism of autoubiquitination is analogous to the mechanism the TRIM5\u03b1 uses (Fletcher et al., 2015). Cellular depletion of Ube2N also results in loss of TRIM21 K48 ubiquitination, suggesting that there may be additional E2 enzymes recruited to TRIM21 resulting in mixed or branched chains. It is not known whether the antibody or the virus also becomes ubiquitinated. Following ubiquitination, it has been shown that PohI, a proteasome-associated DUB, is required for the removal of K63-linked ubiquitin chains, which is pivotal for both TRIM21-mediated neutralization and signaling. The virus:antibody:TRIM21 complex is then degraded by the proteasome in cooperation with the AAA ATPase p97/VCP (Hauler et al., 2012), while the liberated K63 chains activate innate immune signaling through NF-\u03baB, AP-1 as well as IRF3, IRF5, and IRF7 signaling pathways (McEwan et al., 2013). This results in the induction of proinflammatory cytokines such as IL-6, CCL4, and TNF\u03b1 as well as IFN\u03b2. Interestingly, while TRIM21-dependent neutralization has only been demonstrated for hAdV (and recently for foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV) in swines (Fan et al., 2016a)), TRIM21-dependent signaling could be demonstrated for hAdV, HRV14, feline calicivirus (FCV), as well as Salmonella enterica. Furthermore, TRIM21 is important in exposing the respective dsDNA and ssRNA genomes of hAdV and HRV, through degradation of the viral capsid, thus making them accessible to sensing by cGAS and RIG-I, and driving a second wave of signal induction after the first wave initiated by TRIM21 (Watkinson et al., 2015).",

            "text": "While the neutralization and signaling activities of TRIM21 are coupled, they have different response thresholds. Neutralization of hAdV could be observed with as little as 1.6 antibodies per virus in IFN\u03b1-treated MEF cells (McEwan et al., 2012). Similarly, TRIM21\u2019s neutralization activity is tolerant to mutations in the Fc region that decrease the antibody's affinity for TRIM21 to the point that it is even capable of neutralizing virus with an H433K mutant, which displays a 100-fold decrease in affinity for TRIM21. Conversely, signaling is highly sensitive to changes in affinity. In cells where Fc mutant I253A (which has approximately a twofold lower affinity for TRIM21 than the wild-type (WT) antibody) does not impact neutralization, signaling is almost completely lost. This phenotype can be partially rescued by increasing antibody concentration, but this mutant's signaling activity is always significantly lower than WT (McEwan et al., 2012). In line with this observation, it has been shown that TRIM21 effector functions strongly correlate with antibody off-rate, more so than simply affinity for the antigen, a trend that is again more pronounced for TRIM21\u2019s signaling output than its neutralization function (Bottermann et al., 2016). It is intuitive that signaling would be regulated more strictly and have thresholds, since TRIM21\u2019s neutralization activity cannot be harmful for the host, while the initiation of potent immune signaling can have potentially severe consequences. During an immune response, this may ensure that TRIM21 signaling only activates immune transcription in the presence of high-affinity IgG or significant viral challenge. However, this separate threshold allows for neutralization function during the early stages of an immune response where viremia is lower and where antibodies are derived from the natural or low-affinity IgM repertoire. This is supported by the fact that in vivo, TRIM21 can protect na\u00efve mice from fatal MAV-1 infection, where the protective antibody effect can only result from natural or low-affinity IgM that is produced prior to affinity maturation. Moreover, immune signaling in na\u00efve mice after challenge with MAV-1 shows no TRIM21 dependence (Vaysburd et al., 2013). Conversely, mice that received MAV-1 immune sera prior to challenge with MAV-1 were not only better protected from fatal infection in a TRIM21-dependent manner (Vaysburd et al., 2013), but they also showed strong TRIM21-dependent upregulation of proinflammatory cytokines (Watkinson et al., 2013).",

This suggests that the protection mediated by TRIM21 extends to nonclassical pathogens, such as proteopathic agents. This also highlights that TRIM21 is agnostic to the nature of the infectious agent. TRIM21 is essentially a DAMP sensor for antibodies that mislocalize to the cytosol\u2014something that should only happen if normal cellular compartmentalization has been compromised.",

            "text": "Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is an autoimmune disorder that is characterized by erythematosus, fatigue as well as joint pain and swelling. While its cause and origin are still unknown, it is often associated with autoantibodies against TRIM21. The same is true for the autoimmune disorder Sj\u00f6gren's syndrome, where the presence of TRIM21 autoantibodies has served as a diagnostic tool for decades (Fujimoto et al., 1997). One hypothesis of how TRIM21 may contribute to these autoimmune disorders is that autoantibodies against it might undergo bipolar bridging, involving simultaneous engagement of their Fc and Fab regions. This could result in the formation of large aggregated immune complexes that cannot be cleared by Fc\u03b3-mediated phagocytosis, thereby contributing to pathogenesis (James et al., 2007). Another study has shown that macrophages from SLE-prone mice do not fully mature their lysosomes, which has been suggested to result in a defect in clearance of apoptotic cells, an accumulation of nuclear antigens and leakage of DNA and IgG into the cytosol, which then activates AIM2 and TRIM21 (Monteith et al., 2016). Furthermore, there has been evidence that TRIM21 is involved in not only the initiation of immune signaling but also its regulation. TRIM21 has been implicated in the polyubiquitination and subsequent degradation of IRF transcription factors IRF3, IRF5, and IRF7 and thus in the negative regulation of IFN\u03b2 signaling (Higgs et al., 2008, Higgs et al., 2010; Lazzari et al., 2014; Oke and Wahren-Herlenius, 2012). However, other studies contradict a negative regulatory role and have shown that TRIM21 positively upregulates type I IFN signaling through interference with the Pin1\u2013IRF3 interaction (Yang et al., 2009), which usually results in IRF3 degradation (Saitoh et al., 2006), or through ubiquitination and thus stabilization of IRF8 (Kong et al., 2007). One study using TRIM21 KO mice has suggested that while mice are phenotypically normal when left unmanipulated, they develop symptoms consistent with autoimmune disorders upon metal eartagging. In mice that spontaneously become autoimmune, proinflammatory cytokines such as IL-6 and IL-17 (Espinosa et al., 2009) are upregulated. However, one drawback of this study was that the TRIM21 KO generated in these mice was not complete, but through homologous recombination targeted to exon 5. This means that the RING, B-box, and coiled-coil domains of TRIM21 are still intact and in frame with the native promoter, while the PRYSPRY domain has been knocked out, meaning that the catalytic part of TRIM21 is still present. On the other hand, Yoshimi et al. generated TRIM21 KO mice where the entire sequence encoding the TRIM21 mRNA was replaced by eGFP. In this study, it was shown that TRIM21 expression is prevalent in many tissues, while particularly high expression levels are observed in immune cells. Interestingly, these mice did not display any autoimmune phenotypes upon eartagging (Yoshimi et al., 2010). However, MEF cells from these TRIM21 KO mice displayed higher levels of proinflammatory cytokines after TNF\u03b1 stimulation than MEFs from WT animals as well as enhanced NF-\u03baB promoter activity. The ubiquitination of IRF3 and IRF8 was reduced in the TRIM21 KO MEFs, but ISG expression in BMDMs was not affected. This suggests that knockout of TRIM21 can impact the regulation of proinflammatory cytokines; however, it is not clear whether this plays a role in autoimmune disease.",
