Not everybody is paying such close attention. Because of the heightened risk of the complications of COVID-19 inherent in the disorders that produce cerebellar ataxia, our patients need to adhere to these preventive measures and heed all precautionary warnings. The most urgent recommendation therefore is to not get the infection by staying at home and avoiding contact with people who may harbor the virus.

            "text": "An unresolved issue specific to patients with the immune ataxias is whether their therapies should be stopped, including intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg), corticosteroids, plasma exchange, mycophenolate, and rituximab. There is currently no internationally accepted recommendation for patients with immune ataxias. There is no evidence to suggest that IVIg, corticosteroids, or plasma exchange carry an additional risk of contracting COVID-19 [8]. Thus, any decision should be based on the individual\u2019s potential risks (age, associated diseases, severity of the immune ataxia), and the patient should be involved in decision-making. The recommendation in the UK, which we endorse, is that these patients should continue their treatment but be considered high risk, necessitating shielding, a step beyond physical isolation. In the event the patient develops symptoms suggestive of infection, they are instructed to stop the immunosuppressive drug until they have fully recovered from the infection, as a common general rule. Further problems arise from the inability to perform the usual monitoring of hematologic parameters, as well as the current inability to administer these medications in outpatient infusion therapy centers. Similarly, there is no consensus about starting immunotherapies. It will be better if at all possible to delay the immunotherapy. Clinicians should also, however, recognize the risk of not starting immunotherapies particularly in cases of rapidly progressive immune-mediated ataxias. There is preliminary evidence that the inflammatory cytokines IL-1 and IL-6 are elevated in patients with coronavirus infection and that low-dose prednisolone and tacrolimus might have beneficial effects on COVID-19 critically unwell patients [9]. Notably, COVID-19 elicits cytokine storm syndrome, which might be controlled by immunotherapies including IVIG, corticosteroids, and selective cytokine blockade [10]. However, until we have clear evidence that immunotherapy may be of benefit for COVID-19-positive patients, current best practice suggests the approach outlined above.",

Decisions about escalation to intensive care are likely to be made by intensivists and/or internists without the input of the neurologist who normally cares for CA patients. These decisions are fraught with difficulty and have led to algorithms in some countries, exemplified by the use in the UK of the Clinical Frailty Scale (CFS) score [11]. Current recommendations are that for patients over 65 with CFS scores of 5 or greater; discussions should be held in advance about the suitability of critical care should their condition deteriorate. Such discussions are unlikely to involve the neurologist who cares for the patient. Most patients with CA over the age of 65 are likely to be in that \u2265 5 category.

This has the downside of potentially delaying or preventing care, compounding the burden of disease to the point that it may require inpatient admission, placing these chronically ill patients at risk of acquiring infections, and further burdening the already strained healthcare system.

Many institutions have already implemented telehealth/telemedicine, and this has rapidly become standard practice for many neurologists. Available programs such as Zoom, Doxy.Me, Cisco Jabber, WhatsApp, and FaceTime are used for healthcare visits if a patient agrees and contacts the doctor first, and while recent security breaches have been recognized, they are in the process of being repaired. These telemedicine platforms are efficient and practical. In our experience, they are appreciated by patients and have demonstrable positive impacts on patient sense of well-being and confidence that they have access to care providers to address concerns either related to our independent of the current pandemic. These virtual platforms make it possible to maintain contact with patients; review interim history and medications; and identify new, active, or potentially resolving issues. They keep the flow of conversation open and allow care providers to have meaningful dialog with patients in real-time. Virtual video-assisted platforms are well suited to performing some of the core elements of the neurology clinic visit including assessing overall mental state, selected eye movements, speech, examination of hyperkinetic movement disorders, ataxia, dexterity, gait (if caregiver is also present), and power (if caregiver can assist). We need to acknowledge, though, that while the virtual visit platform is a powerful and useful tool, it cannot fully replace the in-person encounter. Assessment of movement disorders such as tremor is not optimal using these video-assisted platforms. The oscillating nature of the movements is not always adequately captured in two dimensions, the quality of the video feed may be poor, and technical sophistication may be limited not only on the part of the patients and their families but also the physicians new to this platform. Further, for those patients with accompanying Parkinsonism, dystonia, or hyperkinesias, it is not possible to assess rigidity remotely. Finally, virtual interaction may be more difficult for CA patients because of the flat two-dimensional virtual environment and technical issues related to the audio component of the interaction. Delayed timing of speech and limitations of the visual platform might disproportionately burden CA patients because their automatized social models of timing and sequencing might be weaker and/or less flexible. There are no data on this topic to our knowledge, which makes this a potential fruitful area for future research.",

The virtual visit can lessen the patient\u2019s need to come in to the office in person for every visit, relieving the burden of the time and practical challenges inherent in traveling sometimes far distances, incurring expenses to get to the clinic, and requiring the assistance or family members who must take time off from work to accompany them. The era of ambulatory clinical medicine that existed before COVID-19 is thus likely to be transformed in a positive way, at least in part, by the experience of care during this pandemic. This development may represent a silver lining of this catastrophe and an opportunity for scientists and healthcare providers to invest in remote data collection to build on this potentially efficient approach to evaluating disease and monitoring progression in the clinical environment and in clinical trials.",

As a result, patients with CA are already reporting from phone interviews a worsening of balance and falls. Patients with spasticity in the context of spinocerebellar ataxias complain of increased muscle spasms. The benefits of rehabilitation therapy reported for stroke patients are also applicable to patients with CA [12]. A 4-week intensive rehabilitation program (1 h \u00d7 3 sessions per week) improved balance, gait, and limb coordination based on the Scale for Assessment and Rating of Ataxia. Importantly, the retention of beneficial effects of such programs depends on continuous training. Long-term programs that include daily 1-h training sessions at home are associated with 1-year benefits, despite gradual decline in motor performance associated with natural progression of the disease. These results highlight the long-term benefits of intensive rehabilitation therapy in CAs, especially when combined with home rehabilitation. Thus, discontinuation of rehabilitation could exacerbate symptoms and worsen the clinical condition. Speech therapists are particularly exposed to viral infections due to the nature of their work, and many of them have stopped visiting patients at home or in residential homes. Patients are now reporting greater difficulties not only for oral communication but also more dysphagia. This is a worrisome development because of the greater incidence of potentially life-threatening aspiration pneumonia.

Expert panels on cerebellar disorders are positioned to offer additional guidelines, generating the virtual means of telemedicine rehabilitation that patients can practice remotely.

The clinical features vary but include impaired executive function, visuospatial cognition, and personality changes with blunting of affect or abnormal behavior [13, 14]. Patients with spinocerebellar ataxia types 1 and 2 (SCA1 and SCA2) develop severe depression and negative symptoms, particularly apathy [15]. Thus, it is reasonable to expect that these patients may be more vulnerable to a psychological crisis such as we are seeing with COVID-19. In addition to their cerebellar disease, CA patients are chronically ill, which predisposes them to greater anxiety and depression. The altered structure of life around them, social isolation, and fear of acquiring the infection may exacerbate these tendencies. Compounding this psychological vulnerability is the reality that providers may have fewer resources available to offer. General practitioners are overwhelmed by the pandemic and less able to commit time and effort to the daily care of patients with chronic neurological conditions such as CA, and in-person psychology or therapy visits have ceased in most countries. In the present stressful climate, it is important to emphasize the need for assessment and monitoring of patients\u2019 emotional health.",

We recommend that patients connect with their behavioral therapists, psychologists, and psychiatrists using virtual visits. The present reality has prompted healthcare providers and insurance companies to recognize these virtual services, which have now become billable. It is our experience already that these communication systems and online programs help provide opportunities to lessen anxieties and enable caregivers to assess their patients while providing timely and necessary support, counsel, and therapeutic intervention. This was shown empirically in a trial in Shanghai which described the benefits of interventions designed to cope with psychological crises among affected populations [16]. The authors utilized on-site psychological services to patients with COVID-19 as well as telephone and the Internet interactions to provide systematic psychological support to family members, friends, and/or colleagues, as well as people living in the neighborhood. The physical isolation required to flatten the curve of transmission has the potential negative consequence of true social isolation, with loss of in-person interactions with the support systems and society at large. Online platforms organizing virtual support group meetings can be instrumental in breaking the social deprivation. Local support group leadership should be encouraged to host such endeavors, supported by ataxia specialists who can address questions and issues raised by members of the support groups.",

The development of rapid turnaround tests is expected to expedite the ability of society to grapple with the uncertainty of not knowing whether a person has been exposed to the virus and could be an asymptomatic carrier/spreader. Similarly, the development of a definitive serum test for the presence of antibody response to prior infection will enable more informed and rational decision-making about optimal approaches to a person entering the home of a patient to provide care or caregivers returning to work and to what we regarded as normal life just a few months ago. Data on body site-specific virus replication, immunity, and infectivity are critical to establish strategies of decontainment [17].

The practical manifestations of this are to continue our work with the technology of online conferences; giving permission to ourselves and our colleagues to embrace intellectual and emotional space and take a break from the constant terrible news of the pandemic, from our own involvement in the care of COVID-19 patients now or in the imminent future; and finding comfort in thinking about and discussing the topics we care about in cerebellar neurobiology and clinical neurology.
