Pediatric early warning scores (PEWS) utilize vital signs and components of the routine bedside nursing examination to calculate a score that may suggest a patient is at risk for deterioration. Many institutions have adopted PEWS, and based on the calculated score, PEWS may trigger an evaluation by a Rapid Response Team (RRT). Accurate scores and timely documentation are essential for these tools to be effective. Scores calculated manually are at risk for calculation errors by the documenting nurse. A PEWS erroneously calculated too low based on the recorded vital signs may result in a missed mandatory escalation and further deterioration. Additionally, multiple steps are required collecting vital signs and physical examination findings, manually calculating a score, and entering examination findings into the EHR that might require different fields of entry. This process prolongs the time to enter a patient\u2019s PEWS, delaying the recognition of deterioration.",

PEWS of 0-2 result in normal monitoring, a score of 3 requires notification of a physician and re-evaluation within 2 hours, a score of 4 or individually scoring a 3 in one category requires a prompt bedside evaluation by the primary team, bedside RN and charge nurse, and a score of 5 or greater requires the bedside RN to initiate an RRT activation manually. The RRT is composed of a pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) fellow or nurse practitioner, a PICU charge nurse, and a PICU-based respiratory therapist. Before September 3, 2015, the collection of vital sign components of the PEWS was by a patient care tech and delivered to the bedside nurse or collected directly by the bedside nurse. The bedside nurse would mentally calculate the PEWS using the collected vital signs and the nurse\u2019s clinical assessment and then later enter the total PEWS and each PEWS subscore (cardiac, respiratory, and behavior) into the EHR. After September 3, 2015, the EHR was changed so that the bedside nurse enters each component of the PEWS into the EHR, and the EHR automatically calculates the PEWS and prompts the bedside RN to engage in the appropriate escalation based on the score (see Table 1, Supplemental Digital Content 1, http://links.lww.com/PQ9/A176).",

A possible tradeoff to this project is the loss of awareness of how to calculate the PEWS by the bedside nurse, and thus reduce his or her understanding of the score itself. A calculation table is included for reference in the current electronic form to maintain nursing awareness of the score. Additionally, during periods of EHR downtime, the bedside nurse may struggle to calculate PEWS. Automation of the score may also impact the understanding of how each PEWS subcomponent relates to deterioration again, highlighting the importance of using PEWS as an aid and not an absolute decision point.",

            "text": "One limitation of this study is the inability to identify inaccurately elevated scores during our preimplementation phase. Before the implementation of the calculator, only information regarding the recorded heart rate, respiratory rate, and total subscore (cardiac, respiratory, or behavior) were available, rather than the nonvital sign components that might affect a subscore. As a result, if a score was higher than expected by the vital sign range, it was assumed that another feature (ie, poor perfusion for cardiac, or severe retractions in respiratory) resulted in the higher than expected score, and thus they were classified as \u201caccurate\u201d for our analysis. Whether or not the preimplementation documented vital signs were used by the bedside nurse to calculate a PEWS subscore cannot be determined, but serve as the best guess for vital signs at the time of PEWS assessment. A second limitation is that this study only evaluated patients with RRT activations or unplanned transfers. As a result, stable acute care patients may not experience the same benefits in accuracy and more timely documentation. It was felt that demonstrating improvement in patients showing signs of deterioration was the primary purpose, and thus the reason to study this population. Finally, we are unable to link the centerline shift to the implementation of the automated PEWS EHR calculator. During the study period, the implementation of other projects16 to reduce non-ICU arrests may have influenced the centerline shift. It is unclear how much of that reduction was due to the automated calculator.",
