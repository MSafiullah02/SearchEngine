            "text": "Coronaviruses (CoVs) belonging to the Coronaviridae family are viruses known to infect a wide range of animals and humans. In humans, CoVs are responsible for mild to severe respiratory illnesses such as the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and the Middle-East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS). The epidemic of SARS which started in 2002 in China, and spread on various other continents such as North America and Europe, reached a mortality rate of 9% 1 . The other severe epidemic illness (MERS) appeared more recently in the Middle East, and like the SARS, it also spread in other countries in Africa, America and Europe with case fatality rates of 35% (reviewed by de Wit et al. 2 ). Currently the world is facing an ongoing pandemic caused by a new coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) that emerged in China in December 2019 and caused disease resulting in 118 326 confirmed cases and 4292 deaths as of March 11, 2020 3 . Since the emergence of these respiratory diseases, CoVs have been considered a real public health problem because of their ability to become epidemic and pandemic 4 . Even though human to human transmission of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV occurs mainly through nosocomial transmission, some human cases recorded were occasionally the results of a zoonotic transmission 5 . This raised an interest in the identification of animal reservoirs. Indeed, it appears that almost each human CoV have zoonotic origins or otherwise have a close relative that circulate in wild animals (bats) [6] [7] [8] and domestic animals (camels and cattle) 9, 10 . Besides SARS-CoVs and MERS-CoVs, numerous other CoVs have been detected in bats in Africa, Asia, Europe and America and are classified into the genera Alphacoronavirus and Betacoronavirus 11, 12 . For SARS-CoV-2, a recent study revealed that the whole genome sequence of SARS-CoV-2 was most closely related with a bat coronavirus detected in bats from Yunnan Province in China 13 . Consequently, bats were defined as reservoirs of ancestral coronaviruses which were transmitted to humans 14, 15 . Other wildlife species appear to Molecular characterization of identified CoVs. Fifteen bat nucleotide sequences were obtained and compared to those available in the public database using the algorithm \"Blastn\" of NCBI BLAST. The results indicated that all the nucleotide sequences from this study matched the deposited CoVs sequences. In order to determine the genetic relationships between the 18 bat CoVs from this study and previously described CoVs, phylogenetic analysis was performed based on 327-bp RdRp truncated sequences (Fig. 2a) . The results showed that 12 out of 15 sequences belonged to the Alphacoronavirus (\u03b1-CoV) genus (Fig. 2b) , whereas the remaining three belonged to the Betacoronavirus (\u03b2-CoV) genus (Fig. 2c) . Among the 12 sequences of \u03b1-CoVs, 7 were obtained from individuals of H. cf. ruber caught in 2009 in the Faucon cave, 2 from other individuals of the same species but caught the same year in the Batouala cave; the other 3 sequences were obtained from 2 H. cf. ruber and 1 H. gigas, all caught in 2010 in the Faucon cave. The 3 sequences of \u03b2-CoVs were detected only in H. gigas.",

According to these results, it appears that CoV infection in H. gigas is correlated with the months of July and October.

This study identified coronaviruses (CoVs) in 18 bats belonging to the species H. cf. ruber, H. gigas and M. inflatus from two caves located in the Ogooue-Ivindo province located northeast of Gabon. The nucleotides sequences obtained showed that these CoVs belonged to the Alphacoronavirus and Betacoronavirus genera. In a previous www.nature.com/scientificreports www.nature.com/scientificreports/ study, the identification of CoVs was already reported in H. cf. ruber in Gabon 17 . Taken together, these results indicated that genetically distinct coronaviruses co-circulate among bats in the Ogooue-Ivindo province. These findings supported that bats carry a great genetic diversity of CoVs and Woo et al. 19 suggested that bats were ideal hosts for both alphacoronaviruses and betacoronaviruses and could play an important role in the ecology and evolution of coronaviruses. Although no coronavirus was identified in other animal species, alpha-and betacoronaviruses were already found naturally in various wild mammals such as civets 5 , buffalos 20 and rodents [21] [22] [23] . In their studies in rodents from China, Lau et al. 21 and Wang et al. 22 analyzed 725 and 1465 rodents, respectively, whereas we analyzed only 494 rodents. The lack of detection of CoVs in our study could be linked to the small sample size, unlike the aforementioned studies. However, in their study, Ge et al. 23 found 23 infected rodents out of the 177 studied. Unfortunately the rodents in our study come mainly from urban localities, rodent captures should also be considered in rural forest areas around caves inhabited by bats. Moreover, experimental infections have been described in non-human primates 24, 25 but no natural infection of CoV in NHP have yet been reported. For other wild animals, the small size of samples investigated by species could explain the lack of CoVs found in this study.",

A close co-evolutionary association could be suspected between CoVs, particularly betacoronaviruses, and bats of this family 26 . Interestingly, in our study, we detected a specific Hipposideridae Betacoronavirus clustering with a Betacoronavirus previously detected in Tha\u00efland in 2007 26 . It was suggested that phylogenetic relationships between betacoronaviruses are mainly driven by the host phylogeny 26 . However, in a study conducted in Africa, Quan et al. 27 suggested that there was no strict association between bat species and betacoronaviruses. Besides this study, previous studies on CoV host species in Asia have suggested that there was no strict association between bat species and alphacoronaviruses 28, 29 . Indeed, many studies have described coronaviruses in a wide range of bat species 30, 31 . Nevertheless, despite the report of alphacoronaviruses in numerous species of Miniopteridae and Vespertillionidae, Ar Gouilh et al. 32 suggested a strict association between Alphacoronavirus EPI6 and Rhinolophidae, a familly usually associated with betacoronaviruses.",

Altogether, these findings first suggest the transmission of CoVs between individuals of the same species through close contacts probably increased by social and roosting behavior, large colony size and reduced space in these caves 26 ; this strain of Alphacoronavirus could be enzootic in H. cf. ruber in this area of Gabon and roosts harboring a large number of bats nesting together promotes viral diffusion in the colony 29, 35 , and second, local movements of bats individuals in the region imputable to seasonal/reproductive or opportunistic roosting behaviors, as the two caves being only 67 km apart. The migratory behavior of some bats provides an opportunity for pathogens to spread over long distances, as reported for flying foxes of the species Eidolon helvum able to migrate more than 1000 km 36 38 . In Ghana, Pfefferle et al. 6 identified a strain of Alphacoronavirus in H. cf. ruber closely related to the human coronavirus 229E. Our finding argues that close relatives of the human coronavirus 229E exist in African bats 14 . The phylogenetic proximity of the CoV strains identified in this study with the human CoV-229E strain suggests a risk of emergence of this virus in humans in Africa. Furthermore, the 10GB0354 alphacoronavirus strain (MG963188), from H. gigas bats caught in 2010 in the Faucon cave, was phylogenetically close (93.8% nucleotide identity) to the Alpaca CoV strain detected in the Vicugna pacos species, commonly known as alpaca (JQ410000). Maganga et al. 17 and Corman et al. 14 already described two Gabonese CoV strains from hipposiderid bats caught in 2009 in the Faucon cave closely related to Alpaca CoV. Indeed, this coronavirus was described in 2007 during the epidemic of severe respiratory disorders associated with abortions in alpacas. It could be the direct progeny of its common ancestor with HCoV-229E, sharing with the latter a nucleotide www.nature.com/scientificreports www.nature.com/scientificreports/ identity of 92.2% 39, 40 , on 440 bases of the nsp12 (polymerase). The phylogenetic link between these 2 CoVs could originate from an inter-species transmission, as a result of the opportunistic evolution of their common ancestor. As a result of genetic mutations and recombinations, the Alpaca CoV would have passed from bats to alpaca and vice versa. Phylogenetic analysis also revealed that two betacoronaviruses from 2 H. gigas, caught in 2013 in the Faucon cave, were phylogenetically close to a bat betacoronavirus named the Zaria bat coronavirus (ZCoV), detected in Nigeria in 2008 in a species of chiroptera genetically close to H. gigas, H. commersoni 27 , suggesting that phylogenetic proximity between host species may promote inter-species transmission 41 .",

Since BLAST proved to be more sensitive, the same was done for the 2 other samples in order to verify that no coronavirus reads could have been missed. No more reads related to coronavirus were found. Moreover, this analysis overall showed that viral reads were extremely under-represented. One could argue that not finding the targeted virus might be caused by low DNA concentration in sequencing libraries. However, even in the sample where the highest concentration has been recorded, no coronavirus reads were found. Furthermore despite having achieved a satisfying quality sequencing, the biased amplification (majority species will be over-represented) and the low viral load explain why coronavirus was identified with such weak coverage.",

In Gabon, the parturitions in H. cf. ruber occur synchronously but some colonies give birth in March and others in October. In H. gigas from the Republic of Congo, a neighboring country, the young are born at the beginning of the rainy season. In Gabon, the months of October and November correspond to the beginning of the rainy season. A study demonstrated a high prevalence of CoVs in Chinese bats during the beginning of the rainy season 43 . The same finding was reported for the shedding of astroviruses in insectivorous bats in Asia (Borneo) 42 . Moreover, these months also correspond to the parturition season for H. gigas and H. cf. ruber. Indeed, lactating females of H. cf. ruber and juveniles of the same species were observed in October in northeastern Gabon. Regarding H. gigas, these observations are more difficult, Brosset and Saint Girons 44 reported that the seasonal events of mating and parturition in H. gigas were confined in large caves where these large bats are entirely dependent to raise their young. According to Plowright et al. 45 , reproductive stress was an important driver of Hendra virus antibody prevalence. The prevalence of antibodies against the Hendra virus was higher in pregnant and lactating female of Pteropus scapulatus contrary to non-reproductive females. Different studies showed that parturition and lactation were important risk factors for CoVs shedding in insectivorous bats 46, 47 . These two physiological states are energetically costly and thus lead to a depression of the immune system.",

These results also suggest an association between the disturbance of the bats' habitat by human activities and the infection of these animals with these viruses. This study highlights a probable seasonality of the infection of insectivorous cave bats of the north-east of Gabon by CoVs. To conclude, a longitudinal monitoring should be carried out at different months of the year in order to determine the reproduction periods of the different bat species and therefore the periods favorable to viral shedding. The effect of the habitat disturbance on viral shedding should also be studied further. Bats harbor a large number of potentially zoonotic CoVs and pose a threat to public health for populations that are in contact with reservoir species of these viruses. The knowledge of CoVs ecology in bats is essential to prevent emergence in human populations.",

Briefly, after RNA quantification and fragmentation, cDNAs were generated with SuperScript III reverse transciptase. Agencourt AMpure XP beads (Beckmann Coulter, The Netherlands) was used for size selection purification and resulted in a total library size 300-500 bp. Library quality was evaluated on an Agilent BioAnalyser 2100 (Agilent Technologies, USA). Sequencing was performed on Illumina's MiSeq (V2 reagents) to obtain 2 \u00d7150 bp paired-end reads. Bioinformatic analyses were conducted with EDGE v2.3.1 pipeline 57 . EDGE's quality module (FastQC v2.08 tool) filtered sequencing reads based on a 25 PHRED score threshold, no ambiguous bases and a 50 bp minimum size. Then taxonomy classification was conducted on both trimmed reads and contigs after assembly (SPAdes v3.13.0). The EDGE's taxonomy module allows for a broad exploration using minimap2 v2.16, Kraken2 v2.0.7, Metaphlan v2.7.7, BWA v0.7.12 and GOTTCHA2 v2.1.5. Unclassified contigs were aligned with BLAST 58 and NCBI RefSeq virus database (September 16, 2019 release).",

Fecal sample collection from non-human primates (NHPs) in protected areas was approved by the National Parcs Agency (ANPN). Bat and rodent captures and sampling were conducted with the permission of the Wildlife and Hunting Department of the Gabonese Ministry of Water and Forestry (N\u00b0003/MEFE-PA/SG/DGEF/DCF, N\u00b00021/MEFE-PA/SG/DGEF/ DCF and N\u00b00031/MEFDD/SG/DGEF/DFC). All the capture events, animal handling, euthanasia and transfer of samples across the country were performed in accordance with the guidelines of the American Society of Mammalogists (http://www.mammalsociety.org/committees/animal-care-and-use). Safe and humane euthanasia was achieved through the use of halothane prior to autopsy. We performed the autopsies under a microbiological safety station equipped with personal protective equipment, mask and visor.Study area and sample collection. We screened several samples from bushmeat, bats, rodents and NHPs collected from 2009 to 2011 and from 2013 to 2015 in six provinces of Gabon(Fig. 1).Bushmeat sampling. Bushmeat was collected from officers of the provincial direction of the Gabon Ministry of Water Affairs and Forestry after seizures of illegal hunting, as well as from salesmen during the hunting season. The sampling was performed in 2013 in four provinces of Gabon (Haut-Ogoou\u00e9, Ngouni\u00e9, Ogoou\u00e9-Ivindo and Woleu-Ntem). Species identification was performed as previously described52 .

In 2011, only the guano of C. afra, H. cf. ruber, H. gigas, M. inflatus and R. aegyptiacus species was collected, unlike other years where organs were taken from bats. In this cave, the R. aegyptiacus colony lives in areas separated from other species including H. cf. ruber and H. gigas. The lack of detection in 2011 may be due to the poor quality of the samples having undergone several thawing. In 2014, only the R. aegyptiacus species was sampled in the Kessipoughou cave. In this cave, the R. aegyptiacus populations live in areas separated from other species including H. cf. ruber and H. gigas. However, Tong et al. 37 and Lau et al. 30 detected alphacoronaviruses in Rousettus bats in Kenya and China. Alphacoronavirus strains detected in H. cf. ruber from the Faucon cave displayed a variable nucleotide identity of 91 to 93% with human coronavirus 229E.
