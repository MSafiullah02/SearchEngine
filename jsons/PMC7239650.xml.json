The learners valued the process yet expressed numerous limitations.1 In response to the COVID-19 outbreak in Qatar, medical schools stopped in-person teaching creating a hiatus in clinical instruction. The Clinical Skills and Simulation Lab (CSSL) team devised and piloted a Web-OSCE to determine its feasibility in this setting, and to evaluate stakeholders\u2019 experiences.",

Student, SP and faculty feedback was encouraging. We identified a need to teach telemedicine, learnt that checklists needed to be modified in rating appropriateness of student eye contact, since looking at a patient on screen means looking away from the camera. All the essential goals aside from physical exam skills could be assessed in the Web-OSCE. These included accurate history taking, communication and rapport building (ie, eye contact, active listening, and so on), critical reasoning based on elicited data and provided physical exam findings.",
