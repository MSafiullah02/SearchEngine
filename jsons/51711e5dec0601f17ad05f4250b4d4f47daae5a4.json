PWUD who share drugs or paraphernalia are consequently at increased risk of transmission between drug users. In addition, drug use often takes place in crowded or substandard living conditions, threatening social distancing and hand hygiene adherence, and placing both PWUD and the wider public at risk. PWUD are also disproportionately represented in homeless, vulnerably housed, and incarcerated populations, which face additional risks from COVID-19 infection. 7, 8 Surges in demand for emergency care during COVID-19 are forcing health systems to scale down routine services, risking discontinuity of care across many domains of health, including substance misuse services. This threatens PWUD with reduced access to vital medications, psychological support, and clean drug equipment. In addition, physical distancing and self-isolation public health measures raise further barriers to accessing health and social services within this already-disadvantaged group.",
