Coronaviruses were identified in several non-human species, including rats, mice, chickens, cattle, turkeys, swine, cats, dogs, rabbits and horses. In these species, Coronavirus infection often causes devastating epizootics of respiratory or enteric diseases. Several coronaviruses, such as HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43, were identified since the mid-1960s. Prior to the SARS-CoV outbreak, coronaviruses were only thought to cause mild, self-limiting respiratory infections in humans, commonly referred at as \u201ccolds\u201d. These viruses are endemic among the human populations, causing 15\u201330% of respiratory tract infections each year. Rarely, these viruses can cause lower respiratory tract infections, especially in neonates, in the elderly, and in individuals with underlying illnesses.",

The pathogen was identified as a novel enveloped RNA \u03b2 coronavirus that was named severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) [4]. The virus showed phylogenetic similarities to both SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV viruses. In view of its similarities to bat coronaviruses, it was postulated that bats could have been the primary hosts of SARS-CoV-2. This hypothesis suggested that the infection originated via transmission from wild animals illegally sold in the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market. On January, 30th, 2020, The World Health Organization (WHO) declared coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) a public health emergency of international concern, and on March 11th, WHO Director General referred to COVID-19 as a pandemic. As of May 5th, 2020, the number of confirmed cases of COVID-19 has exceeded 3 million worldwide, with more than 250,000 COVID-19-related deaths. The epidemic has put public health systems under severe strain both in western countries and in the developing world. SARS-CoV-2 displays a more efficient transmission pattern when compared with SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV [5], retaining a high transmission rate also in the asymptomatic incubation period [6]. The clinical spectrum of COVID-19 syndrome varies remarkably, going from asymptomatic forms to acute bilateral pneumonias requiring hospitalization. Common presenting symptoms include fever, fatigue and dry cough, while laboratory tests often show lymphopenia and elevated lactate dehydrogenase levels. Chest computed tomographic scans show a typical pattern of bilateral patchy shadows or ground glass opacity. A significant percentage of cases requires admission to intensive-care-units (ICU) due to acute respiratory distress syndrome that requires mechanical ventilation support. A subgroup of patients with severe COVID-19 can experience the so-called \u201ccytokine storm syndrome\u201d, characterized by a fulminant and fatal hyper-cytokinemia associated with multi-organ failure.",

It is likely that the widespread use of this term is related with its rather immediate meaning, which actually recalls the role of the immune system in producing an uncontrolled and generalized inflammatory response [7]. It seems not casual that the term cytokine storm was first employed in describing the events modulating the onset of the graft-versus-host disease [8], a condition characterized by an impressively powerful activation of the immune system. Cytokine storms characterize a wide spectrum of infectious and non-infectious diseases, and since 2005, it was associated to the avian H5N1 influenza virus infection [9]. Apart from the immediate significance of the term cytokine storm, the biological and clinical consequences of this immune system hyperactivity are by far less known, making it worthwhile to be briefly overviewed.",

Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is a devastating event, with an estimated mortality of approximately 40%, defined as the presence of bilateral lung infiltrates and severe hypoxemia. ARDS can occur in a variety of clinical situations, including pneumonia, sepsis, pancreatitis, blood transfusion. ARDS pathogenesis involves inflammatory injury to the alveolo\u2013capillary membrane, which results in increased lung permeability and the exudation of protein-rich pulmonary edema fluid into the airspaces, leading in the end to respiratory insufficiency [12].",

As far as COVID 19 infection is concerned, Huang et al recently reported that infected patients also show high levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines [4]. The demonstration of increased levels of IL-1B, IFN\u03b3, CXCL10, and CCL2 strongly pointed toward an activation of T-helper-1 (Th1) cell function. More importantly, the so called \u201ccytokine storm\u201d emerged as a main factor driving a more severe clinical course. This concept originated from the observation that COVID-19 patients requiring ICU admission displayed higher concentrations of CXCL10, CCL2 and TNF\u03b1 as compared to those in which the infection was less severe and did not require an ICU admission. To further complicate the issue, it should be highlighted that, in patients with SARS-Cov-2 infection, at difference from SARS-CoV infection, there is also an increased secretion Th2-immune-oriented cytokines such as IL-4 and IL-10, whose main effect is to suppress inflammation[14].",

They mediate the traffic of immune cells to the site of the infection, induce the increase of the acute phase signaling, activate epithelial cells and mediate the production of secondary cytokines [21]. Among them, Interleukin-6 (IL-6) deserves a more extensive discussion in view of its involvement in the coronavirus-induced cytokine storm. IL-6 is crucially involved in acute inflammation due to its role in regulating the acute phase response [21]. It is produced by almost all stromal cells and B lymphocytes, T lymphocytes, macrophages, monocytes, dendritic cells, mast cells and other non-lymphocytic cells, such as fibroblasts, endothelial cells, keratinocytes, glomerular Mesangial cells and tumor cells [22]. The production of this cytokine is increased by IL-1\u03b2 and tumor necrosis factor (TNF- \u03b1)[23]. IL-6 may also be responsible for the activation of T helper 17 (TH17) cells in the dendritic cell-T cell interaction [24]. In COVID-19 affected patients, a high TH17 cells activation could result from a virus-driven increased production of IL-6 by the immune system. IL-6 plays a key role in the pathogenesis of the cytokine storm owing to its pleiotropic properties. Several studies showed that the serum levels of IL-6 are increased in COVID-19 patients and that its circulating levels are positively related to disease severity [14,25,26]. For this reason, high serum IL-6 levels were suggested as predictors for disease severity [27,28]. Indeed, in animal models of SARS-CoV infection, the inhibition of the transcription factor of IL-6 and, in turn of its production, was associated with reduced mortality [29].",

Several studies also showed that the intratracheal injection of mob-1 in mice induced pulmonary migration of leukocytes in the alveolar space, with massive recruitment of neutrophils, especially monocytes. This event was rapidly followed by microvascular injury and pulmonary edema typical of ARDS [35,36]. CXCL10 signaling appears to be a critical factor for the onset of ARDS, as shown in mice models of ARDS induced by either acid aspiration or by viral infection (with influenza H5N1 virus). Briefly, Ichikawa et al, demonstrated that wild-type mice developing ARDS had increased levels of CXCL10 mainly due to an increased secretion by infiltrating neutrophils, which induced an autocrine loop mechanism on the chemotaxis of inflamed neutrophils, leading to fulminant pulmonary inflammation. On the contrary, CXCL10 and/or its receptor CXCR3 knock-out mice showed decreased lung injury severity and increased survival in response to both viral and non-viral lung injury [37]. Moreover, CXCL10 expression in the lung was significantly up-regulated after induction of ARDS with Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) in a mouse model of lung injury, and the neutralization of CXCL10 with anti-CXCL10 antibody lead to amelioration of lung injury[38].",

Some chemokines play a direct anti-viral effect by inducing an array of phenomena that lead cells to determine an \u201canti-viral \u201cstate. These phenomena include activation of apoptosis or direct killing of infected cells by activated immune cells. Chemokines also recruit immune cells to the site of infection, which will fight against the intruder [55]. Viral infections are associated with enhanced expression of several chemokines, in particular the interferons-inducible ones. Interferons, which can be produced by any mammalian cell, are involved in the rapid and efficient host innate response against viruses. A powerful IFN response triggered by the first contact with a virus can slow down viral multiplication and \u201cbuy time\u201d for the organism to establish a more efficient adaptive immune response [56]. IFNs can stimulate surrounding cells to express potent antiviral proteins including enzymes, transcription factors, cell surface glycoproteins, cytokines and chemokines [57,58]. Moreover, they can inhibit cell proliferation, regulate apoptosis and modulate the immune response [59]. Among interferons-induced molecules, the chemokine CXCL10 is currently regarded as a main player in the organism anti-viral response [60], and particularly in respiratory tract infections. Several studies demonstrated that CXCL10 levels, as evaluated in serum, bronchial-alveolar washing fluid or nasal secretions, consistently correlate with the severity and duration of acute respiratory tract infection due to viral infections.

            "text": "These findings prompted further in vitro studies aimed at investigating the relationship between SARS and the chemokine system. Spiegel et al, demonstrated that, in addition to its direct effect on epithelial lung cells, SARS-CoV could also enter macrophages and dendritic cells [72]. This appeared crucial as viral entrance in these cells lead to an abortive infection (e.g. the virus enters the host-cell but cannot successfully complete replication). Yet the virus elicited the secretion of pro-inflammatory chemokines by dendritic and macrophages cells [73]. This finding was confirmed in vivo because the serum levels of a wide spectrum of cytokines and chemokines produced by dendritic cells and macrophages were elevated in SARS-CoV infected patients [74]. Furthermore, the infection with SARS-CoV of human primary myeloid-derived dendritic cells was followed by an impaired defensive IFN\u03b2 response, which was paralleled by a moderate up-regulation of pro inflammatory cytokines (such as TNF-\u03b1 and IL-6) and a much more significant up-regulation of inflammatory chemokines (such as CXCL10, CCL3, CCL5, and CCL2) [75]. The authors suggested that the lack of response to antiviral interferons in the presence of chemokine up-regulation could represent a further mechanism of immune evasion by SARS-CoV [73]. In line with this hypothesis, the direct exposure of lung epithelial cells [76] or Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cells (PBMCs) [75] coming from SARS infected patients to viral proteins (such as S-protein and N-protein) induced a prompt release of several chemokines, including CXCL8 and CXCL10. In vitro gene-expression studies also reported that PBMC from normal healthy donors inoculated with SARS-CoV showed an early enhancement in the expression of several chemokines belonging both to the CC family (CCL4, CCL20, CCL22, CCL25, CCL27, and their receptors CCR4, CCR7) and of the CXCL family (CXCL8 and IL-17) [77]. Additional data came from animal models of SARS-CoV infection. In mice infected with SARS-CoV, the clinical features of the syndrome showed an age-dependent increase in severity (similarly to what observed in humans), which was related to an increased level of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines, paralleled by a reduction in T-cell responses [78]. Another study showed that in mice infected with SARS-CoV, robust virus replication accompanied by delayed type I interferon secretion caused a rapidly fatal pneumonia. This delayed Type I-interferon signaling promoted the accumulation of pathogenic inflammatory monocyte-macrophages, with resulting increase in cytokine (IL-6) and chemokine (CCL2) lung levels, vascular leakage, and impaired virus-specific T cell responses.

This strategy may help to hide and protect RNA replication intermediates from being sensed by intracellular RNA-sensors, thus avoiding the activation of the IFN cascade [81,82].-Active mechanisms include a direct action of viral proteins on transcription factors and intracellular signaling molecules that regulate the IFN cascade.

However, transcriptional enhancement of CXCL10 could be due to a direct effect on the Nuclear Factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF-kB) [85] triggered by SARS-CoV[86], even if other Authors did not confirm this early observation [87]. Similarly, the up-regulation of the CXCL8 gene expression, could be due to a direct effect of the virus at the cellular level. Indeed, intestinal and lung cells lines infected by SARS-CoV, promptly increase their secretion of CXCL8 [88]. This observation would fit with the notion that the expression of CXCL8 is dependent on the transcription factor Activator protein 1 (AP-1), which was shown to be strongly up-regulated by SARS-CoV [86,89].",

Furthermore, SARS-CoV-2 infection was less able to trigger the expression of any IFNs, suggesting that SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 might differ in their ability to modulate the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines. As an example, it could be worth highlighting that SARS-CoV infection upregulated 11 out of the 13 pro-inflammatory factors evaluated, while SARS-CoV-2 upregulated only five of them, (namely, CXCL10, IL6, CCL2, CXCL1, CXCL5). Interestingly, CXCL8 transcription was up-regulated only by SARS-CoV, but not SARS-CoV-2 infection, while the opposite was observed for CXCL10 [97].",

Moreover, an up-regulation of several genes involved in apoptosis and P53 signaling pathways in PBMC was observed, leading to the hypothesis that this process could be the underlying cause of lymphopenia commonly observed in COVID-19 patients.

Another study by Wang et al, including 65 SARS-CoV-2-positive patients showed that the absolute numbers of CD4 + T cells, CD8 + T cells and B cells progressively decreased in relation with increasing severity of illness.

Indeed, several cytokine/chemokine levels were measured and found to be elevated in patients with different clinical severity of the COVID-19. Among them, CXCL10, CCL7 and IL-1 receptor antagonist were the ones significantly related to disease severity and even more importantly, CXCL10 levels were the only one to be positively and significantly correlated with the viral load (Yang, et al. 2020).",

Based on current knowledge, the \u201ccytokine storm\u201d appears as one of the most dangerous and potentially life-threatening event related to COVID-19 sustaining its major clinical consequences. The immune mediated events related to the response to SARS-CoV-2 infection, and the role of the chemokine/chemokine receptor system, will be further and more extensively characterized with the final goal to identify targeted therapeutic strategies. Although lessons from the previous SARS and MERS epidemics can be drawn, there is still much to do in order to conclude whether SARS-CoV-2 virus behaves in the same way of its predecessors or if it is characterized by peculiar specificities. Clearly, the hide-and-seek challenge between the virus and our immune defenses will also help us understanding the extremely variable spectrum of clinical manifestations of COVID-19, which appears to range between asymptomatic cases to possibly lethal bilateral pneumonia with multi-organ failure.",
