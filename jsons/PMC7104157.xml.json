Most intensive care units (ICUs) in Taiwan face such a situation. Most ICUs utilize a written form when carrying out EGDT, and the entire form must be completed [11].",

Currently, little is known about the secular trend in ED visits due to septicemia in the general population of Taiwan.

However, there has been little research on awareness of the diagnosis of patient visits for septicemia in the ED during implementation of EGDT and SSC, or how patient visits for septicemia are influenced by implementation of these programs. In the current study, we expected that EGDT protocol and SSC education program would increase awareness of the diagnosis of patient visits from septicemia in the ED, which in turn would increase the number of visits due to septicemia. We used segmented regression to determine the immediate impact of the EGDT protocol and SSC education program on the annual rates of septicemia-related ED visits by comparing the visit rates before EGDT implementation (1998\u20132001), during EGDT and SSC implementation (2002\u20132005), and after SSC implementation (2006\u20132012).",

We used this Report, which includes data on all ED visits indexed by the International Classification of Diseases, 9th Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM) Codes, to assess the number of visits (disease code and ID card number were key data points allowing for patient-centered review and removal of duplicate information) [26].

Segmented regression models can illustrate more than one intervention at a time. For instance, we might be interested in the effects of the different components of a larger intervention introduced at different times. The level and slope are the parameters that define the intercept and slope, respectively, of each successive segment of the time series. The level parameter was defined as the expected or mean number of patient visits at a particular time interval, and the slope parameter quantifies the change in the number of patient visits over a single unit of time (per year). A disjointed or interrupted intervention effect is reflected in the step-change (change in intercepts) in the outcome variable between any two consecutive periods after the intervention. Before-and-after changes in the number of septicemia-related ED visits were estimated by testing differences in the slopes between the pre- and post-intervention periods. The specific estimators of the segmented regression include time (calendar years before intervention), intervention (the index year(s)), and timeafterintervention (calendar years after intervention). The multivariate linear regression model containing the two change points (interventions) is as follows:Y=\u03b20+\u03b21time+\u03b22intervention1+\u03b23timeafterintervention1+\u03b24intervention2+\u03b25timeafterintervention2+\u03b26malesex+\u03b27age+\u03b28malignantneoplasm+randomerror\n",

We considered the Poisson regression models for 2002 and 2007 to express the intervention effects, respectively. In practice, the intervention effect can be expressed as the absolute difference in predicted visits between when the intervention was implemented and the counterfactual value.

In the United States, the National Hospital Discharge Survey found that the septicemia incidence rate increased from 0.83 to 2.4 per 1000 population between 1997 and 2000 [31]. Discharge data from the Nationwide Inpatients Sample found that the hospitalization rate for septicemia ranged from 0.65 to 1.35 per 1000 population in 1993\u20132003 [32]. The findings can be attributed to a gap between the true and reported incidence of septicemia, a phenomenon that might be explained by advances in diagnostic devices used by hospital infection control teams [33], a higher likelihood of ED physicians to make septicemia-related diagnoses (i.e., surveillance bias), and overall increased awareness of septicemia-related symptoms and signs by the general population, including at-risk patients and their family members. Indeed, we found that the number of septicemia-related ED visits was about the same in 2012 as in 2002.",

However, these visits showed differing trends after the two interventions. The EGDT protocol is regarded as so complicated that it remains controversial whether it actually reduces case fatalities. On the other hand, the SSC guidelines can be delivered as part of an education program, which has been shown to improve outcomes. Potentially counter-intuitive to these findings is the finding that there were fewer estimated septicemia-related ED visits when the SSC intervention was not implemented. This can be explained by an increase in physician awareness. Physicians\u2019 awareness of septicemia-related symptoms might be promoted through education programs. Chen et al. investigated the effect of a nationwide educational program based on the SSC guidelines on hospitalizations for severe sepsis. The annual severe sepsis incidence rate increased slightly after the program (by 0.4 on average). Furthermore, physicians\u2019 clinical practice of sepsis care and patient mortality rate for severe sepsis both decreased [37]. Thus, it is important to evaluate the effectiveness and outcomes of the SSC education program.",

In this study, we noted that ED visits by older adults (\u2265 65 years) might serve as a sentinel event for the observed substantial growth in septicemia-related ED visits. Therefore, we suggest further prospective investigation of older patients after their discharge from the ED. This prospectively collected information might provide valuable insights on clinical, psychosocial, and EMS risk factors for repeated ED attendance by the elderly population. Such studies might also generate an evidence base for evaluating the success of the SSC education program in meeting the acute healthcare needs of this critical population.",

However, the emergent rescuer responsive hospitals for acute care must implement SSC quickly because of requirements by the MOHW\u2014namely, the Grading Responsible Hospitals for Acute Care (GRHAC) audit program, which was implemented from 2007 to 2009 [39]. The MOHW has annually audited and updated the list of responsible acute care hospitals since 2009. The current lag between the implementation of the SSC intervention and its actual rollout, which is about three years, allows for a dramatic growth in septicemia ED visits to the ED. With the implementation of the SSC program, public health decision-makers might be able to increase the period for protocol administration, and thereby better evaluate the impact of the SSC intervention on septicemia-related ED visits. Therefore, it might be important to consider the length of the intervention period when developing health care plans that can help public health programs achieve their goal.",

Therefore, there is a potential risk of unmeasured and uncontrolled confounding variables in the current analysis. Second, we investigated the impact of the EDGT protocol and SSC education program on septicemia-related ED visits between 1998 and 2012 due to data availability. Besides, the relatively short pre-intervention period (1998\u20132001 and 2002\u20132005) might have limited the statistical power for the segmented regression analysis to detect minimal changes in the level or slope parameters [29]. Third, the aggregated format datasets make it difficult to completely adjust for confounders (such as comorbidities, education levels, or lifestyle) in the multivariable linear regression model. Further completed studies need to resolve this limitation when using individual data. Fourth, the number of cases of septicemia was relatively low (Table 1) compared to another study using aggregate claims data (which reported the incidence rates for severe sepsis) [37]. One potential reason is the coding method of sepsis we adopted. Gender differences might be another reason: For example, women might be less likely to develop septicemia than men [40].",
