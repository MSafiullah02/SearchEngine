Conditions in jails are very conducive to the transmission of SARS-CoV-2, and social distancing is impossible. Therefore, there is widespread concern that there could be major outbreaks in jails and that jails could amplify transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in surrounding communities.",

As a preventive measure against coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreaks, some jails are releasing low-risk offenders early or admitting fewer inmates, or both.3 It is unclear whether these interventions will be sufficient to prevent the occurrence of major outbreaks.",

R0\nwj is defined as the average number of secondary infections of COVID-19 that are caused by one infectious inmate during the time that they are incarcerated. If R0\nwj is greater than 1, then an outbreak will occur in the jail; if R0\nwj is less than 1, an outbreak will not occur. the greater the value of R0\nwj, the more severe the outbreak. To prevent an outbreak from occurring, interventions need to reduce R0\nwj to less than 1.",

Both curves show that there are multiple interventions, in terms of the proportion of inmates that are released early and how early they should be released, that would be effective in preventing an outbreak. For example, if R0\nwj equals 1\u00b71 in the absence of interventions (red line), any of the following three interventions would be effective: (1) not admitting 9% of potential inmates to the jail; (2) releasing 20% of inmates after an average of 11 days in jail; or (3) releasing all inmates after an average of 39 days in jail. If R0\nwj equals 1\u00b75 in the absence of interventions (blue line), more extreme interventions would be necessary to prevent an outbreak occurring\u2014for example, (1) not admitting 33% of potential inmates to the jail; (2) releasing 60% of inmates after an average of 8 days in jail; or (3) releasing all inmates after an average of 16 days in jail.",
