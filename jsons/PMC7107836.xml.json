In both experimental [14, 15] and naturally occurring [16] human influenza virus infections, increased serum levels of several proinflammatory cytokines (e.g., TNF-\u03b1 and IL-6) have been positively correlated with the symptoms of clinical illness. In an experimental model of human influenza A virus infection, H3N2 viruses were shown to be more potent inducers of TNF-\u03b1 and IL-6 than were H1N1 viruses [17]. The avian H5N1 influenza viruses that have caused fatal disease in humans are exceptionally potent inducers of proinflammatory cytokines [18\u201321]. Cytokine dysregulation is now regarded as a major contributor to the severe pathophysiological changes seen in human disease caused by the avian H5N1 [2, 18\u201321] and 1918 pandemic influenza viruses [22, 23].",

However, statins can also induce remarkable short-term improvements in cardiovascular function. For example, the use of short-term, low-dose simvastatin treatment for patients with nonischemic dilated cardiomyopathy resulted in clinical improvement that was associated with substantial reductions in serum levels of several inflammatory mediators, including TNF-\u03b1 and IL-6 [27]. The anti-inflammatory effects of pravastatin on coronary endothelial dysfunction [28] and of simvastatin on C-reactive protein levels [29] have been demonstrated in patients even after administration of a single dose. Moreover, an epidemiological study of >300,000 patients with acute myocardial infarction has shown that those who continued receiving or were newly receiving statins within 24 h of hospitalization had a >3-fold reduction in mortality, compared with patients who were not treated [30]. These short-term effects of statins might have important implications for the management of other acute life-threatening events associated with inflammation.",

In a murine model of acute bacterial sepsis (cecal ligation and puncture without subsequent administration of antibiotics), prophylaxis [33] and treatment [34] with simvastatin dramatically preserved cardiac and hemodynamic function and significantly prolonged survival. In addition, 3 clinical reports have suggested that statins were of benefit in patients with acute bacterial sepsis (table 1) [35\u201337]. The first study included 388 patients who were hospitalized with gram-negative or Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia [35]. The second study included 361 patients who were hospitalized with presumed or documented acute bacterial infections [36]. The third study included 438 patients who were hospitalized with bacterial sepsis [37]. Remarkably, if statin treatment was continued in the hospital, the rate of death attributable to bacteremia was reduced by 87% in the first study [35] and 92% in the third study [37]. In addition, a population-based, nested, case-control study of 69,168 elderly patients discharged after hospitalization for acute cardiovascular events showed that the risks of subsequent hospitalization for sepsis and for fatal sepsis were lower for statin-treated patients than they were for untreated control patients (table 1) [38]. Another population-based study did not find a beneficial effect of statins on 30-day sepsis-associated mortality, but the number of statin-treated patients was small and the 95% CIs around the point estimates were very broad (table 1) [39]. Many physicians have begun to ask whether treatment of sepsis should include statins [41].",

Animal models of acute lipopolysaccharide-induced sepsis (similar to endotoxemia) and bacterial sepsis have shown that a variety of inflammatory mediators are implicated in fatal disease [42]. Nonetheless, many treatment interventions targeting specific abnormalities suggested by animal studies (e.g., TNF-\u03b1) have not been efficacious when tested in clinical trials in humans. To date, only low-dose corticosteroids and activated protein C have been shown to benefit patients with severe sepsis [42]. However, several newer therapeutic targets are now being considered, including Toll-like receptors, high-mobility group box 1 protein, macrophage migration inhibitory factor, complement C5a and C5a receptors, and inhibitors of apoptosis [43, 44]. Statins have effects on several of these targets.",

Simvastatin also induced pronounced endothelial barrier protection in a murine model of acute lung injury caused by intratracheal administration of lipopolysaccharide [51]. In this model, simvastatin significantly altered lipopolysaccharide-mediated expression of several genes associated with inflammatory change (e.g., IL-6 and Toll-like receptor 4). In another model of acute lung injury in rats after intestinal ischemia and reperfusion, pretreatment with simvastatin was associated with reduced leukocyte infiltration into lung tissue, decreased production of free oxygen radicals, and reduced severity of acute lung injury [52].",

The Swiss investigators recently completed a population-based, nested, case-control study of pneumonia (R. G. Schlienger and C. M. Meier, personal communication). They studied cases that occurred throughout the year, not just those that occurred during influenza seasons. They found that people who were currently taking statins (defined as statins having been prescribed within 30 days of the date of onset of pneumonia) had a statistically significant reduced risk of 30-day pneumonia-associated mortality and a lower but not quite statistically significant risk of being hospitalized with pneumonia and surviving. Protection was not shown for those who had taken statins in the past (defined as statins having been prescribed \u2a7e30 days before the date of onset of pneumonia) but were currently not taking them, nor was it shown for those who had taken a control medication at any time.

Cholesterol synthesis is essential for the normal functioning of cell membranes, especially lipid rafts [66]. Cholesterol is also essential for influenza virus assembly, budding from raft-derived microdomains, and virus infectivity for other cells [67\u201369]. Experimental studies in mice have shown that Toll-like receptor 7, which is located in the endosomal compartment of the cell, recognizes single-stranded influenza virus RNA [70]. Once recognized, Toll-like receptor 7 recruits several adaptor molecules (e.g., myeloid differentiation protein 88 [MyD88]) that, through a series of signalling steps, lead to the translocation of NF-\u03baB to the nucleus, an essential event in establishing influenza virus infection [71]. The \u201cMyD88-dependent pathway\u201d controls gene expression for several proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines (e.g., TNF-\u03b1, IL-6, and IL-1\u03b2), type 1 interferons, plasmacytoid dendritic cell maturation, and antiviral immunity [70]. These and many other intracellular signalling cascades have been identified in cells infected with influenza virus [72].",
