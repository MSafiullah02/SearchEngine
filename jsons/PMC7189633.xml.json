The COVID-19 pandemic is also exacerbating multiple health and wellness disparities such as unequal distribution of SARS-CoV-2 acquisition and transmission risks, more severe clinical courses in some patients, and reduced access to food, housing, ongoing medical care, and prescription medications. Given intersecting biological and structural risks, gay, bisexual and other men who have sex with men (MSM) have long been understood to be far more likely to be at risk for and living with HIV than other reproductive aged adults in the US [5]. Over one-third of MSM in the US who are already diagnosed with HIV are not on adequate treatment and may be immunocompromised, potentially increasing risks associated with COVID-19 [6]. MSM at risk of HIV infection may also continue to engage in risky health behaviors or have problems accessing necessary sexual health and HIV prevention services during the COVID-19 pandemic. Younger MSM may be more impacted by the economic effects of COVID-19 and may be particularly vulnerable to reduced access to these services [7].",

Our research group is also validating at-home self-collection of specimens for SARS-CoV-2 testing and plan on implementing a COVID-19 prevalence survey this spring.

Participants were eligible to participate if they were age 15 years or older, male sex at birth, resided in the US, and reported oral or anal sex with a man at least once at any time in the past. Participants of the August through December 2019 AMIS data collection cycle who provided their email address for future study invitations were sent a link to a special COVID-19 impact survey screener where AMIS eligibility was reassessed.

The economic impacts of COVID-19 are also being felt disproportionately among younger MSM who may be more reliant on hourly and in-person service employment as part of the \u201cgig economy\u201d [7]. Though few of our participants had yet to report loss of health insurance or housing due to COVID-19, many had already lost jobs or had money problems setting the stage for additional troubles if economic policies are not implemented rapidly. This is particularly concerning because substantial proportions of our participants are already reporting COVID-19 related barriers to HIV and STI testing, PrEP access, and HIV treatment. Many participants had not yet tried to access these services, but if the COVID-19 pandemic is protracted, more MSM will have trouble getting these vital health services. A longer COVID-19 mitigation or recovery process could also potentially impact access to PrEP and HIV medications as longer-term prescriptions expire and medical care visits are required for renewal. Relaxing follow-up laboratory guidelines, increasing prescription refill numbers, and having providers transition to telehealth services are solutions already being promoted by professional organizations [13].",

Though condom access and usage appears to be minimally affected by COVID-19, participants are reporting fewer sex partners likely as a result of COVID-19 social distancing recommendations and stay-at-home orders [11]. This may have an immediate effect on decreasing HIV and STI transmission risk among MSM, but substantial proportions of MSM are already reporting that they aren\u2019t strictly adhering to COVID-19 mitigation recommendations. It is possible that protracted mitigation orders will result in even further compliance challenges, placing these MSM at increased risk of acquiring or transmitting SARS-CoV-2 infection, particularly if they are ignoring stay-at-home orders so they can meet sexual partners. There is also evidence from a study conducted after the September 11 terrorist attacks that showed a small but significant increase in condomless anal sex among US MSM after the tragedy, with people who lost a friend or relative reporting even greater increases [14]. If MSM have a similar response to COVID-19 but are experiencing sustained interruptions in HIV/STI services, we may see increased HIV and STI incidence among MSM. In addition, these data also indicate that young MSM may be disproportionately impacted by HIV and STI service interruptions, which may reverse some of the recent gains in reducing HIV incidence among young MSM [5].",

The surveys only involved self-report of COVID-19 related impacts, it\u2019s unclear whether this would be prone to misreporting and what effects those biases would have on our findings. More detailed quantitative and qualitative studies of the COVID-19 impacts would be needed to clarify these effects. Our findings are also likely to be very transient in nature due to the changing nature of local COVID-19 transmission, mitigation efforts and their impacts on healthcare and economies. This may limit reproducibility of the findings but could also be a substantial benefit in rapidly examining changes in these impacts as the COVID-19 pandemic evolves. Online surveys are uniquely suited to these types of rapid re-assessments.",

Our study provides the first evidence of the scope of these disruptions among US MSM, including direct impacts on sexual partnering and access to HIV prevention and treatment. To avert increased HIV and STI incidence, steps need to be taken immediately to improve access to these services, such as increasing the use of telehealth for PrEP and HIV care and mailed self-collection of specimens for HIV and STI testing. To avoid exacerbating health disparities, we must also make rapid progress on deploying large-scale seroprevalence studies to better understand potential co-morbidity of HIV and SARS-CoV-2 among MSM from across the US. Ultimately, systematically characterizing the outcomes and mitigation strategies of both the US COVID-19 epidemic and associated impacts on HIV prevention and care represents a rapidly emerging priority for gay men and other MSM in 2020.",
