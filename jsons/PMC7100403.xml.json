The disease is present in many parts of the world in both farmed livestock and wildlife reservoirs (Humblet et al. 2009; Hlokwe et al. 2014; Rivi\u00e8re et al. 2014). Although the majority of the Member States of the European Union (EU) are officially tuberculosis free, some EU countries continue to have endemic bovine disease, with the United Kingdom (UK) heading the list. Multiple risk factors for disease in cattle, badgers and other mammals in the UK have been identified (Broughan et al. 2016), but ongoing arguments over whether removing (often known as \u2018culling\u2019) the wildlife reservoir of badgers (Meles meles) in bovine high incidence areas is scientifically and ethically justifiable attract most attention (Woodroffe et al. 2016; Brunton et al. 2017; McCulloch and Reiss 2017).",

For bTB, cattle and badgers have been killed in their thousands in the UK to reduce disease incidence over many years. Positive cattle, detected primarily through injecting avian and bovine tuberculin into the neck skin of cattle and measuring comparative immunological responses after 72 h (de la Rua-Domenech et al. 2006), are compulsorily removed to slaughter with compensation by the State. Badger removal, begun in England in the 1970s to prevent transmission to cattle, continues in some parts of England as part of the national disease eradication strategy (DEFRA 2014; Brunton et al. 2017).",

Ireland)\u2014the bTB eradication programme began in earnest in 1959 with full legislative support (Robinson 2015), but even with one of the most sophisticated bTB control systems in the world, involving a large cadre of private and state veterinarians carrying out intensive, sustained cattle testing and removal over many years, disease eradication remains elusive. Like Sisyphus in Homer\u2019s Odyssey, forever pushing the boulder to the brim of the hill only for it to roll to the bottom again (Homer 1946, p. 155), bTB just keeps on coming back. Although present in only a minority of herds at any given time [herd incidence 9.61% in 2017 (DAERA 2018)], dealing with this problem is expensive, and cost the state \u00a3317 M (US$ 449 M) in N. Ireland between 1996 and 2011 (NI Assembly 2012), and that does not include the private cost to farmers. Despite early promise, when the disease appeared on the verge of eradication in N. Ireland in the late 1960s, M. bovis could be viewed as largely having \u2018made a shambles\u2019 of efforts to halt its spread within the cattle population of N. Ireland for nearly 60 years (Robinson 2015). This resonates with Latour\u2019s view on the difficulties of \u2018mastering\u2019 a microbe: \u201cNatural objects are naturally recalcitrant; the last thing that one scientist will say about them is that they are fully masterable. On the contrary, they always resist and make a shambles of our pretentions to control\u201d (Latour 2000, p. 116). This is sobering (and highly frustrating) for farmers and veterinarians charged with practising \u2018biosecurity\u2019\u2014the separation of microorganisms from animals\u2014in an effort to protect livestock from infection and disease (Kelly 2005).",

Despite the vital importance of the microbes, there has been little specific focus on the agency of these \u201cuncooperative bacteria\u201d (Atkins and Robinson 2013a, b) as arguably the central actors in the disease problem. This paper therefore has three main objectives. First, it seeks to re-orientate the scholarly and stakeholder analysis of bTB to focus on the bacteria as the central disease actors, rather than the animal bodies (cattle and badgers) which succumb to infection and disease; the farming, veterinary and other stakeholders who manage the animals; or the state which governs the disease eradication efforts. This objective is challenging, because as social beings, the bacteria act in concert with other things, forming associations which can be difficult to prise apart (see Mansnerus 2009; Porter 2016 for further examples of microbial (dis) entanglement). A better understanding of the agency of the bacteria is necessary if progress is to be made with the eradication campaign. In doing so, this research contributes to the literature considering the political ecologies of health which has been heavily influenced by STS approaches and theorization (Jackson and Neely 2015; Neely 2015; Robinson 2017b), and which emphasize the liveliness of more-than-human biological agents within assemblages of control (Robbins et al. 2008; Biehler 2009; Hausermann 2015). Indeed, Hausermann (2015, p. 2218) explicitly calls for critical political ecologies to \u201ctake the nonhuman seriously\u201d. Second, this focus on the agency of bacteria further expands the burgeoning literatures on the political ecologies of health by combining theoretical insights on performativity and performance with more-than-human agency to examine how pathogenic bacteria can act on multiple levels and do things to shape the world which are simultaneously natural, social, economic and political. The bacteria perform, but also cause other actors, both human and more-than-human, to perform in tandem, often causing confusion and destabilization, challenging the expertise of the human actors involved in disease control. Particularly relevant here is Schuurman and Franklin\u2019s (2015, p. 23) notion of \u201ccounterperformance\u201d, namely \u201cresistance in a situation where it has the potential to disturb the performance or transform it\u201d. Extending conceptually beyond the consideration of counterperformance in animal\u2013human relations takes the social theory of performance and performativity into the realm of the pathobiology and epidemiology of animal infection and disease. Third, the paper also demonstrates the value of natural scientists using STS as a medium to trace and examine \u201cactors and actions involved across different social worlds\u201d (Engel 2012, p. 54). In doing so, they can re-view themselves, their actions, policies, and literatures through a different (socio-political and -cultural) lens, testing long-held assumptions, and offering alternative solutions to complex scientific and socio-technical problems.",

It is to be repelled and removed, rather than accepted and accommodated, but, as this paper will demonstrate, there are profound challenges inherent in attempting to discipline microbes (Ingram 2007), and militaristic framings of disease control are themselves performative, of which more will be said later.",

How the horse behaves in response to the exercise of control by the trainer reflects positively or negatively on the expertise of the trainer.

In considering these multiplicities, I focus on what the bacterium does, recognizing that \u201cperformativity \u2026 involves the saturation of performances and performers with power\u201d (Gregson and Rose 2000, p. 441). This focus provides a way to \u201cunlock and animate new \u2026 potentialities\u201d of the nonhuman (Thrift and Dewsbury 2000, p. 411), and brings to the fore the everyday practices (Thrift, 1997) of a bacterium. This allows us to \u201cexamine the reality of [M. bovis] as an outcome of multiple performances that overlap and depend upon one another\u201d (Robins 2012, p. 188). These overlaps are important, for Dewsbury (2000, p. 476) posits that \u201cperformativity is about connection. One asks what something does, and how in its doing, or being thus, it connects with other things, digresses boundaries instigating new ones, whilst rejecting, separating, and recomposing others\u201d. I bring performativity into the sphere of agricultural economy, and argue that this study of the entanglement between nature and culture (Harrison et al. 2004) and \u201cnature performed\u201d (Szerszynski et al. 2003), draws an under-rated actor from the shadows and into the spotlight.

The interview data come from sixty individual and two focus-group interviews of individuals and groups of cattle farmers, veterinarians (private and state), and scientists involved with bTB in N. Ireland. These interviewees were asked about why they thought the Northern Irish programme had not yet achieved its original objective of eradication of the disease.

The interviews were semi-structured in format and were recorded with consent between September 2012 and May 2013, before full transcription and analysis using a grounded theory approach (Glaser and Strauss 2008).

Accepting that \u2018open\u2019 cases will allow bacteria to escape, he goes on to suggest that thorough disinfection of the cattle accommodation was one of the most important factors to consider in the eradication of the disease. Mycobacteria have unique cell walls which make them resistant to most antibiotics, and difficult to kill with chemical disinfectants (Scanlon and Quinn 2000). The cell wall also protects the bacterium from drying out, and it can survive for periods of weeks or months in the environment, the period dependent on ambient temperatures and exposure to sunlight (Menzies and Neill 2000). The cell walls of mycobacteria such as M. bovis are incredibly thick, and act as very efficient permeability barriers (Hoffmann et al. 2008). This gives the bacterium an aura of indestructibility, acknowledged by this research scientist:Well, it has probably got the biggest wax coat of any sort of organism \u2026 It will come into contact with, say, lung macrophages if it lands in the lungs. Under normal circumstances all the [chemical] reactions go on in the macrophage \u2026 that\u2019s quite lethal to most bacteria. But the structure of mycobacteria means that they will resist that on many occasions (Int A33, research scientist).Mycobacterium bovis is present in multiple materialities in the environment. Infected animals excrete M. bovis in their faeces, possibly due to bacilli from lesions in the lung being swept up the trachea in mucus and swallowed. Schroeder and Cotton (1907) estimated that one diseased cow passed as many as 38 million tubercle bacilli in one day in 13 kg of faeces. Scanlon and Quinn (2000) suggest that M. bovis organisms may survive for up to 6 months in slurry, and this infected slurry may then be spread on land as fertilizer, contaminating pastures as well as slurry storage tanks. Nasal secretions from infected cattle have also been found to contain M. bovis (de Kantor and Roswurm 1978), and these mucoid secretions are thought to contain the organisms from three months after infection as the animal begins to shed (Neill et al. 1991). The micro-environment of the bovine nasal cavity is a suitable place for bacterial multiplication: \u201cIt\u2019s dark, warm and moist \u2026 it provides a good spot for it to grow\u201d (Int A33, research scientist). Contaminated faecal ingestion is thought to be a rare source of infection in cattle (Menzies and Neill 2000), but nasal secretions shared through close bodily encounters may be more important as a means of transmission (Neill et al. 1989; Cassidy et al. 1999).",

Even the humble earthworm has been demonstrated to ingest and move the bacteria from cattle faecal deposits, and perceivably could infect badgers through ingestion (Barbier et al. 2016). Deer, another recognized wildlife host of M. bovis, may also contaminate the environment and act as a vehicle of indirect transmission for cattle (Johnson et al. 2008)\u2014their excretions into the environment are known to contaminate livestock feed and infect cattle in the USA (Palmer et al. 2004).",

Perceived scientific wisdom in the twenty-first century suggests that the most important and significant mobility of M. bovis is its carriage through the air in minute watery droplets of respiratory fluid\u2014aerosol exhaled by diseased animals\u2014coughed up in expulsions from the depths of the lungs. Just like the asbestos disturbed and released in demolition work to produce \u201can airborne dance of inextinguishable fibres\u201d (Gregson et al. 2010, p. 1067), so the violent eruptions from the bovine respiratory tract release M. bovis in probably its most deadly form. Inhalation of these droplets in the air is thought to be the most common form of transmission of infection between cattle (Pollock and Neill 2002), and is also considered the main route of infection for badgers (Corner et al. 2012). Gannon et al. (2007) demonstrated in a laboratory study that M. bovis is robust in its airborne state, with 94% of bacilli surviving the first 10 min after aerosolization, and they concluded that once airborne, it can survive for prolonged periods. Such is the potency of M. bovis as an agent of disease, that only one colony-forming-unit (CFU), containing 6\u201310 viable bacilli, is required to initiate successful infection by the respiratory route (Dean et al. 2005). Many more bacilli are thought to be necessary to initiate bovine infection through ingestion (Menzies and Neill 2000).",

The rod-shaped bacterium does indeed have a damaging \u201ccolonising materiality\u201d (Gregson, 2012, p. 2016) with a wide host range and flexibility, but it produces contrasting views between veterinarians on how dangerous that tendency to colonize may be:It takes every possible opportunity to spread to other species and to get itself a little niche \u2026 it seems perfectly adaptable to any situation (Int A41, state vet).The only thing that saves us from wildfire spread of the disease throughout the whole blooming country is the fact that bTB actually does not transmit that easily and readily between bovines. It happens, but if it were to happen at the same rate as some other diseases, we would be over-run (Int A42, state vet).These movements from the environment into animal bodies are therefore confusing and difficult to adequately predict (Robinson 2017b).

The frontline defence from the host are cells called macrophages (literally \u2018big eaters\u2019 from the Greek), and they engulf the bacilli to seek to destroy them. Interplay between cells is sparked by chemical messengers called cytokines as they summon help and enhance the capacity of macrophages to kill the invading non-self. Neutrophils, natural killer cells and more macrophages migrate across the blood vessels to join the attack (Gupta et al. 2012). Bactericidal gases such as nitrous oxide are released as part of the panoply of host defences. If the initial infection cannot be repelled, the acquired immune response kicks in after a number of days, and T-cells (also known as lymphocytes, a type of white blood cell) are recruited, with these cells forming the basis of immunological memory to providing defence if the invader is encountered again in the future as well as attack in the present (Pollock and Neill 2002).",

The infected macrophage becomes the centre of a lesion\u2014a \u2018granuloma\u2019\u2014a cheesy abscess of dead and gradually decaying matter surrounding a bacterium which can remain very much alive, and with the ability to recrudesce months or years later. Subsequent infections with other mycobacteria have been found to \u2018home in\u2019 on the existing granuloma, showing that they are permeable entities\u2014transit hubs\u2014and do not offer protection to the host from future mycobacterial invaders (Cosma et al. 2008). The bacteria can performatively appear and re-appear, disrupting and causing confusion:The wee beastie can hide itself away\u2026 it\u2019s intracellular, it can hide within cells, and hide in little encapsulated nodules \u2026 for years and years and years, only to break out when the immune status of the animal has dropped below a certain point (Int A42, state vet).There were animals that didn\u2019t show any signs of bTB, and yet they had M. bovis [living] up their noses\u2014how do you explain that? (Int A33, research scientist).Latency, the period of inactivity without progression, is considered an important feature of both bovine and human TB (Pollock and Neill 2002; Lin and Flynn 2010). The mycobacteria appear as if content to bide their time until exerting their destructive effects, waiting for the opportune moment to reactivate when defences are weakened through old age or a compromised immune system. Throughout this \u2018in-between\u2019 state of latency, like humans in remission from cancer, the infected animal is \u201cneither sick nor cured\u201d and in \u201ca space that has no concrete conceptual boundaries\u201d (Stoller 2012, p. 177) between the \u201cnormal and the pathological\u201d (Canguilhelm 1978 [1966]). What adds to the irony is that the destruction of tissue is caused by the host itself in response to the bacterium, and the question arises as to who or what is being \u2018fought\u2019:What develops within the animal or the human is really the immune response to the organism, it\u2019s not necessarily the organism which is doing the damage, it\u2019s the immune response which is damaging the animal or the human \u2026 people look at it as if you are fighting this organism, but the damage that is being done is as much to do with the host response as it is to do with the organism itself (Int A33, research scientist).Breakdown of the granuloma and bacterial mobilities within the body mean that new lesions can be formed and the healthy lung tissue (or whatever organ is seeded with infection) is destroyed\u2014a slow, chronic, insidious process, but one which is very seldom seen in the developed countries today where regular animal testing removes infected animals before death would occur by much longer natural course.",

And then, if it can manage to stay in an animal and wall itself off, the nasty little sod can stay out of the way, without detection by our bTB test, and then eventually at some point in time it can break out again and cause more infection to other animals (Int A40, private vet).The tuberculin test, a skin test performed by veterinarians injecting a weakened form of M. bovis into the skin of a bovine to provoke an immune reaction, has been used by vets to diagnose bTB since John McFadyean published his initial experimental results in 1891 (Pattison 1984). The tuberculin test remains controversial, mistrusted and disliked by farmers and sometimes by veterinarians as well (Enticott 2012). False positives to the test (unconfirmed at slaughter or in the laboratory) decrease farmers\u2019 confidence in the expertise of the vet and the diagnostic process. False negatives, where the test fails to pick up the infection and it is later found at slaughter, seem to incur even more scorn from farmers. Farmers often have anecdotes about such cases:I have seen us testing and getting clear in the test and having 3 cattle\u2026 we tested on a Monday and Tuesday.\u2026 and killed [them] the following week on the Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday, and there was one animal down with bTB each day (Int A7, beef farmer).There\u2019s been evidence a whole lot of times where men [sic] have had a clear test and then cows have gone to the abattoir and they have had bTB, so what did that tell you? \u2026 It misses too many positive animals, that\u2019s why you\u2019ve got the problem of going to the abattoir and then finding bTB when they open it up (Int A9, dairy farmer).To make matters worse for the veterinarians and farmers, there is apparent evidence of performative co-belligerence between M. bovis and other biological species to weaken the efficacy of the tuberculin test. Experimental evidence has suggested that the parasite Fasciola hepatica (liver fluke) weakens immune responses to the test (Claridge et al. 2012) allowing M. bovis to further evade detection with the best diagnostic tool currently available. Similarly, co-infection with bovine viral diarrhoea virus (BVDV) is thought to compromise diagnostic tests, and also may potentiate susceptibility and onward transmission of infection through immunosuppression (Monies 2000; Kao et al. 2007). It appears that M. bovis is more \u2018nomad\u2019 than \u2018monad\u2019 when it comes to its inter-relations with other microbial species (Attenborough 2010). Given that infection with both liver fluke and BVDV is widespread in British cattle herds, there is cause for concern, although further investigation is required to elucidate the risks (Byrne et al. 2016, 2017).",

Finding animals with granulomatous lesions through visual inspection at slaughter in abattoirs is recognized as an important part of the overall surveillance regime (Olea-Popelka et al. 2012). It is though a blunt instrument of detection, bearing in mind that an animal may only have one small lesion, causing many infected animals to be missed (Corner et al. 1990). Even in the laboratory the organism is difficult to detect from tissue samples extracted at slaughter, and Medeiros et al. (2012) suggest the need for a combined approach of multiple laboratory techniques including bacteriology, histopathology, molecular and immunological detection methods to find all infected animals due to the range of stages of infection at presentation. Gallagher and Horwill (1977, p. 155) described bacteriological culture of the organism, and noted that M. bovis was a \u201cfastidious\u201d organism which \u201cgrew very poorly\u201d in the laboratory.

The significance of the badger in the spread of M. bovis in the UK and Ireland, and what to do about it, has caused much controversy both within scientific discourse, and between farmers and veterinarians (\u2018the industry\u2019) and sceptical publics. Grant (2009) describes the inability to eradicate bTB from the English and Welsh cattle herds as an \u201cintractable, long-term policy failure\u201d, and chronicles the succession of government review committees and reports on the subject over decades, particularly on the question of what to do about the badger. The vaccination of badgers against bTB with bacille Calmette\u2013Gu\u00e9rin (BCG\u2014a derivative of virulent M. bovis) is one option and is used in some parts of the UK and Ireland as part of a long-term strategy to reduce both badger and cattle incidence (Robinson et al. 2012; Aznar et al. 2018). Badger culling has been used at various times in England since the early 1970s depending on state policy (McCulloch and Reiss 2017), but is much more politically charged than vaccination. The largest field experiment ever conducted\u2014the Randomized Badger Culling Trial (RBCT)\u2014was led by a specially convened panel of scientists (known as the Independent Scientific Group on bovine TB\u2014ISG) and the trial cost some \u00a349M ($65M) (Cassidy 2015). This massive expenditure failed to stem the argument at both scientific and policy levels about whether to continue to cull badgers, or to re-focus on cattle-to-cattle transmission. Whilst the ISG\u2019s final report on the RBCT supported the belief that badgers transmitted bTB to cattle, the overall conclusion was that \u201cbadger culling cannot meaningfully contribute to the control of cattle TB in Britain\u201d (Bourne et al. 2007, p. 181). This conclusion provoked a storm of protest, dissent and counter-argument. The British Government\u2019s Chief Scientific Officer disagreed with the conclusion that culling was no longer a valid option, stating that \u201cthe removal of badgers could make a significant contribution to the control of cattle TB in those areas of England where there is a high and persistent incidence\u201d (King 2007). From Ireland, More et al. (2009) questioned the RBCT evidence which suggested that perturbation of badgers caused by culling increased the risk of cattle further bTB breakdowns. Irish research suggested that badger culling was indeed a valid and effective means of reducing disease incidence in both cattle and badgers, in conflict with the British research conclusions (Olea-Popelka et al. 2009). The most recent epidemiological analysis of the current industry-led culling policy in England suggests it may have a beneficial effect on reducing cattle incidence (Brunton et al. 2017), but the controversy is likely to continue.",

It\u2019s test every year and if something goes down, do two tests and\u2026 nothing has changed in the past 40 years [exasperated] (Int A15, dairy farmer).Conflict predominates, with farmers pitted against the state, and the state in turn suggesting farmers could do more to help eradicate bTB, particularly by improving biosecurity on farms to try to keep infection out (Enticott 2008a). But this advice is met with apathetic responses:If you start to say \u201cYou could maybe help yourself here\u2014there\u2019s an awful lot farmers could be doing on biosecurity\u201d. But they [farmers] are totally disillusioned (Int A41, state vet).Farmers, veterinarians, government policy officials and scientists engage in blame and counter-blame. For example, a private veterinarian mocked a new state initiative to search more intensively for infected herds, blaming the state (and scientists) for a lack of creative thinking:bTB, you would say, is very lacking in science, and very lacking in in-depth stuff. Everyone is sort of floundering around with vague ideas about what is going on \u2026 It sounds like the American Army in Afghanistan: \u201cWe\u2019re going to have a surge now on the herds around the reactor\u201d \u2026 I think we aren\u2019t very far down the path when that\u2019s the conclusion\u2014that\u2019s the obvious place to check.

The bacterium unwittingly exerts a political agency and power to deflect blame away from itself. This is particularly relevant for the human actors, and especially the state actors charged with disease eradication, where the persistent resistance and counterperformance by the bacterium results in failure to achieve objectives, the slippage of authority, and the questioning of expertise (Schuurman and Franklin  2015).",

(2010, p. 1081), and they remind us that \u201cthese surprises can be less than enchanting, nasty and certainly costly\u201d. Much the same can be said of M. bovis. We have seen how the material environmental and bodily performativities of the organism are varied and diffuse, but I would suggest that the epidemiological performances of the bacterium are most surprising of all. Whilst M. bovis is primarily a pathogen of cattle, there are surprising spillovers of infection, exhibiting a much wider potential host range than M. tuberculosis, its human-hosted counterpart (Allen 2017). For example, in the past decade infection has been reported in the British Isles in a dog (Shrikrishna et al. 2009), sheep (van der Burgt et al. 2012), goats (Daniel et al. 2009), alpacas (Connolly et al. 2008), cats (Roberts et al. 2014), and in a cluster of humans with no known links to agriculture (Evans et al. 2007). In cattle, occasionally most of a herd of cattle is affected, sometimes a cluster within a herd, but, somewhat paradoxically, most of the time only a single animal succumbs to infection (Menzies and Neill 2000). Transmission has been described as \u201can enigma\u201d (Gannon et al. 2007) with \u201ccomplexity and unpredictability\u201d (Khatri et al. 2012). It has a mysterious mobility, and bTB is often surprising as an infectious disease; it can appear from nowhere, and leave again as quickly (Robinson 2017b). In other herds, it lingers for years without remission, but the heterogeneous performances leave farmers confounded by the multiplicity of bTB:We haven\u2019t had any rhyme or reason on the bTB\u2014we\u2019ve had it in milk cows, an in-calf heifer, and a 9-month-old calf. (Int A24, dairy farmer).Whether it was coincidence or not, I don\u2019t know, but we had a cow which came from England, and it was a daughter of hers which went down\u2014and then her sister\u2019s daughter went down. There were years between them, but I found it very odd. (Int A11, dairy farmer).I bought a cow\u2014she was a great cow\u2014and we had a herd test about 2 or 3 weeks after that, and that cow went down with a bang with bTB. There was a [skin] lump on her the size of your fist! And then we retested [the herd] again and everything else was clear\u2014there was no spread of infection. (Int A13, dairy farmer).Multiple strains of M. bovis circulate, and their cartographies can be elucidated through molecular typing methodologies. Some strain types are found far from their normal home range, presumably diffused as animals are moved to other farms, and yet most sources of infection seem to be local (Skuce et al. 2010). Genetically identical strains are shared between cattle and badgers in the same locality (Biek et al. 2012). There are different geographies (Abernethy et al. 2013) and histories (Atkins and Robinson 2013b) of bTB. Different herds, different age groups within a herd, different strains, different geographies, different histories of infection\u2014different, but the same\u2014confusing ontologies, heterogeneities, different versions of disease (Enticott et al. 2012; Atkins and Robinson 2013a). This is what makes M. bovis even more difficult to control, for we are \u201cthrown into the flux of an inherently mutable molecular life where reassortment is not what we control, but what we fear\u201d (Braun 2011, p. 400).",

On the other hand, veterinary scientists and policy makers, with their predominant focus on the biological aspects of bTB as a disease, have only in recent years appreciated the importance of the attitudes and resultant behaviours of the stakeholders involved in bTB eradication programmes. The pressure to make profit in competitive global agribusiness markets and resultant intensification of livestock agriculture, have contributed to the spread of M. bovis through husbandry practices which are less than ideal when it comes to disease eradication. Economic pressures to maximize production efficiency can result in prioritizing other important tasks, and the disciplined focus required to separate pathogenic environmental bacteria from bovines through disinfection, or keeping bovines away from badgers, or from other (potentially bTB-infected) bovines in neighbouring herds, becomes more fuzzy. As a result, the bacteria are enabled to perform in ways which enhance their ability to survive and prosper.",

Future research in scientific laboratories might open up new vistas and give hope of brighter days to come. For example, through the development of new diagnostic technologies (Casal et al. 2014); further elucidation of complex immune responses to infection (Waters et al. 2016); effective vaccine discovery (Buddle et al. 2013); and using whole-genome sequencing to more accurately trace the spread between animals and farms (Trewby et al. 2016), we may have better tools to tackle the disease in future.",

            "text": "More work needs to be done to further elucidate the pathogenesis of the infection, the significance of a contaminated environment, and how specifically it is transmitted between animals. There is therefore a need to \u201clinger in the space of the [bacterium]\u201d (Moore and Kosut 2014, p. 517) and to study more of what van Loon (2005, p. 39) calls the \u201cuncharted zones between the microphysics of infection and the macrophysics of epidemics\u201d. The aim in doing so is to attempt to keep one step ahead of a remarkably persistent contagion, mindful that these microbes \u201cadhere to different topologies and comprise non-human mobilities, which frequently do not conform to the territories and networks familiar to humans\u2019 geographies\u201d (Hodgetts and Lorimer 2015, p. 7). The danger of over-emphasizing respect for the \u201cradical alterity and unpredictability of organisms [and] their ecologies\u201d in what Lorimer calls the \u201cvibrant strand of political ecology\u201d may result in \u201cappeals for flourishing and conviviality [which] are vague and context-specific. They do not offer general ethical frameworks or overarching structural causes\u201d (Lorimer 2012, p. 604). On the other hand, ignoring or underestimating the liveliness and vibrancy of matter (Bennett 2010) is also problematic. As Lorimer (2012, p. 606) counterbalances his argument, he affirms that \u201ctargets, icons and action plans are necessary, but they should give scope for non-human dynamics, multispecies deliberation and experimentation and forms of adaptive management\u201d.",

            "text": "Second, the militaristic language used throughout this paper is in itself performative, and considering its usefulness (or not) and consequences is instructive. As discussed in the introduction, veterinary meetings with pathogens are often framed as battles to be fought and won. Indeed, Hlokwe et al. (2014) ask \u201cAre we losing the battle?\u201d when considering the increasing intra- and interspecies transmission of M. bovis in South Africa. These martial framings acted as useful performative devices to bring the bacterium on stage during interviews. Veterinarians responded enthusiastically to this framing, and it encouraged them to focus on the bacterium, otherwise neglected in conversation. As a result, it was variously described as \u201ca nasty little sod\u201d (Int A40), \u201cwee beastie\u201d (Int A42), \u201cvery insidious\u201d (Int A45), and a \u201cclever little devil\u201d (Int A47), and the race to beat the \u2018bad guy\u2019 was highlighted in this excerpt:If it was a war situation with a live enemy they would be laughing at us. It\u2019s a bit like \u2018M\u2019 burrowing away for Bond, producing all these gizmos and gadgets to get one step ahead of the bad guys, except we\u2019re the good guys, and it\u2019s the bad guy (Int A41, state vet).But if a war is taking place, who are the protagonists? Farmers never mentioned the bacterium when interviewed. The bacterium is not making war, but the veterinarians perhaps are still attempting to:I think we are well aware of our enemy\u2014we just can\u2019t get rid of it! [laughs] \u2026 It\u2019s a clever organism, and I don\u2019t think we will have the science, well, not in my lifetime, to throw what we need at it to eradicate it (Int A47, state vet).There are definite risks, for as Baehr (2006, p. 55) warns: \u201cwar language is risky, a double-edged sword, because to lose a \u2018war\u2019 is to bleed authority\u201d. Herein lies the problem\u2014the \u2018war\u2019 against bTB in N. Ireland has been ongoing for many years, and hope of \u2018victory\u2019 has been all but lost, with the state blamed for failing to eradicate the disease despite the optimism of yesteryear (Robinson 2015). Although the state\u2019s battle cries may have had an effect during the Foot-and-Mouth disease crisis in 2001 (Wright and Nerlich 2006), and has been used for other national emergencies such as the Hong Kong SARS crisis of 2003 (Baehr 2006), the problem is that M. bovis has already penetrated and entrenched its positions across the landscape. It is not a new enemy to be feared and kept out at all costs, but is the enemy within, unseen and largely ignored. Even those who consider it, as our quote above demonstrates, believe that science and the state is effectively struggling to do anything about it. The language of war no longer exerts a useful performative effect when apathy and despair predominate:I don\u2019t think it will ever be eradicated. I don\u2019t think so. An old vet fifty-plus years ago\u2014my father asked him if bTB would ever be eradicated, and he said: \u201cNo, they will keep it under control, but they will never do away with it\u201d (Int A36, dairy farmer).Third, I suggest there is a need to widen the vista and shift the primary political focus away from predominantly concentrating on the controversies surrounding what to do about the badger. There is a need to re-focus the politics of bTB to deal with the main protagonist in all of this sorry mess\u2014the bacterium itself. Throughout my interviews with the farmers and veterinarians in N. Ireland the bacterium was the one actor most readily forgotten. Even a research scientist stated half an hour into the interview: \u201cThe one thing I haven\u2019t talked about is the organism itself\u201d (Int A33). Even if we do so, with its ultimately surprising performativities, M. bovis looks like lingering for some time to come, and it is certainly an example of \u201cmaterial agency\u201d with the \u201cnegative power to resist or obstruct human projects\u201d, and which must be considered a powerful political agent (Bennett 2007, p. 113). The encore is maybe, and certainly not yet. A dose of realism must be injected into the politics, with more recognition of the \u201contological instability of matter\u201d (Braun 2008, p. 677). It is not just performance which is \u2018feral\u2019 (Clark 2003; Thrift and Dewsbury 2000, p. 429), but also this difficult-to-control bacterium. The human actors therefore need to work collaboratively together and stop blaming each other for the failure to completely curb the spread of this \u201crecalcitrant microbe\u201d (Latour 2000, p. 116).",

There are no simple solutions to the complexities of implementation \u2026 but dealing with these complexities requires open, frank discussion\u201d (Closser 2012, p. 399). Focusing on the performativities of M. bovis highlights that bTB is multiple, and the bacterium is both object (to which things are done) and subject (which does the doing) (Latimer and Miele 2013). It is a bacterium whose performances need to be brought front and centre stage once again (Goffman 1990 [1959]). Farmers, veterinarians and policy makers need to consider how farming and veterinary practices can better cope with halting the ongoing spread of, and removing, the unwelcome microbes in their midst. The danger, as Schuurman and Franklin (2015, 32) point out in a different context, is that \u201cpersistent counterperformance holds increased potential to negatively subvert the overall performance\u2014too many incidents of counterperformance result in leakages in the performance, and control is no longer possible\u201d. A policy of continuing to test and kill the microbial hosts, by itself, looks unlikely to achieve eradication: it\u2019s time for a rethink which takes the microbes themselves more seriously. To do that, there needs to be a better acknowledgement and understanding of how they (counter) perform at their best.",
