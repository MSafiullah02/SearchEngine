AVN can occur from 6 months to 10 years after the use of steroid.22 The pathogenesis of steroid-induced AVN is unknown, but it maybe due to the increase in the size of marrow fat cells or to fat embolism, so that the intra-osseous pressure is increased.23 As about 23\u201332% of SARS patients become critically ill,11 corticosteroids, either intravenously and/or orally, are frequently prescribed. In our study, all the SARS patients received steroids. Some studies show that there is no relation between AVN and the cumulative dosages of therapeutic doses,24., 25. but other studies show a strong correlation between the mean daily total steroid dose and AVN.26., 27. A study by Rademaker et al.28 shows that 700 mg prednisolone is the threshold for developing AVN. In our study, only one patient received prednisolone below this threshold (640 mg), and at the time of writing this patient has not developed AVN.",
