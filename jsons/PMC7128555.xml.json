The prevalence of MRSA has increased progressively since the early 1980s, and by 2002 MRSA accounted for nearly 60% of nosocomial S aureus infections acquired in intensive-care units.1 MRSA strains have been reported to account for 30\u201362% of nosocomial S aureus bloodstream infections and 42\u201360% of S aureus surgical-site infections.2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 In some facilities, the proportion of health-care-associated S aureus infections caused by MRSA is even higher. Vancomycin-intermediate S aureus (VISA) strains, which have vancomycin minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of 8\u201316 mg/mL, have continued to cause occasional health-care-associated infections, although transmission within health-care facilities of such strains has seldom been documented.8 At least three well-documented isolates of vancomycin-resistant S aureus (VRSA) that have vancomycin MICs of 32 mg/mL or greater have been recovered from patients in the USA.9 Although it is possible that the relatively high frequency of co-colonisation by vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE) and MRSA among patients in the USA may create more opportunities for in-vivo transfer of the vanA gene complex from VRE into MRSA strains, it is not known if this has affected the frequency of VRSA in the USA.",

            "text": "By contrast with the uncommon occurrence of VISA and VRSA, MRSA strains that are still classified as susceptible to vancomycin (ie, MICs of 1\u20134 mg/mL) have caused an increasing number of health-care-associated infections that respond poorly to vancomycin therapy.8, 10, 11 The poor response to vancomycin therapy in such cases appears to be associated with several strain characteristics. Patients infected with MRSA strains with vancomycin MICs of 1\u20134 mg/mL have responded to vancomycin therapy less frequently than patients with infections caused by strains with MICs of less than 0\u00b75 mg/mL.10 In some cases, poor clinical responses may have been due to strains with hetergenous resistance to vancomycin\u2014so-called hetero-VISA.6 Fowler and colleagues14 found that MRSA bloodstream infections that persisted for more than 7 days despite appropriate vancomycin therapy were significantly more likely than short-duration MRSA infections to have been caused by strains that exhibited (1) higher rates of survival in vitro after exposure to thrombin-induced platelet microbicidal protein (p=0\u00b7005), (2) defective delta-lysin production (suggestive of loss of accessory gene regulator [agr] function; p=0\u00b7057) and (3) agr type II (p=0\u00b7037). In two prospective randomised trials of treatment of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), vancomycin therapy was significantly less effective than treatment with linezolid (p=0\u00b7001) among a subset of patients with VAP caused by MRSA.12 Unfortunately, the microbiological characteristics of MRSA from these pneumonia studies were not described in detail. The above trends suggest that although vancomycin remains the drug of choice for most serious health-care-associated MRSA infections, clinicians in the USA may need to consider the use of other agents\u2014eg, linezolid, daptomycin, or tigecycline\u2014in some clinical situations based on the characteristics of the infecting strain and the body site affected.",

            "text": "Another major change in the epidemiology of staphylococcal infections in the USA is the rapid emergence of community-acquired MRSA strains since the late 1990s.13, 14, 15, 16 Although such infections have been more common among population groups such as young children, native American and Pacific islander communities, prisoners, military personnel, men who have sex with men, intravenous drug users, and individuals involved in amateur or professional competitive sports, spread within the general community is likely occurring.13, 15, 16, 17 A relatively small number of unique strains appear to be responsible for many of the community-acquired MRSA infections occurring in the USA.17 Most of such strains contain the mobile genetic element staphylococcal cassette chromosome mec (SCCmec) type IV, which is relatively uncommon among health-care-associated MRSA strains in the USA.18 Emergence of community-acquired MRSA has also required that clinicians alter their approach to empiric treatment of community-acquired skin and soft tissue infections. Physicians have been encouraged to routinely culture skin lesions to determine if community-acquired MRSA is the cause, and in geographic areas where community-acquired MRSA are relatively common, empirical therapy of such infections with clindamycin, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (co-trimoxazole), doxycycline or minocycline, or linezolid is becoming common. If empiric clindamycin is administered, testing community-acquired MRSA isolates for inducible clindamycin resistance by using the \u201cD-test\u201d is recommended.19\n",

Measures recommended by the Society for Healthcare Epidemiology of America for controlling health-care-associated MRSA include the use of screening cultures to detect colonised patients, placing patients in private rooms or cohorting patients, wearing gloves for room entry, gowns for substantial contact with patients or their environment, and hand hygiene before and after patient contact.20 However, there is considerable debate among experts in the USA about whether or not the use of screening cultures to detect patients at high risk of MRSA is necessary or practical in all health-care settings. Given the considerable body of evidence that screening cultures, when combined with contact precautions, are beneficial and cost-effective,20, 21, 22 it is disconcerting that a recent survey of infectious disease consultants found that only 50% of 463 respondents favoured the use of screening cultures to detect multidrug-resistant pathogens, and only 30% worked in facilities where screening cultures were routinely done.23 The costs of surveillance cultures, potential logistic problems that may result from an increased number of patients requiring isolation, and lack of controlled trials demonstrating the efficacy of screening cultures are often cited as concerns by those who do not use screening cultures. Further studies are necessary to establish the relative efficacy of control measures such as screening cultures, cohort nursing, increased staffing levels, and improved hand hygiene adherence rates in controlling transmission of MRSA in health-care facilities.24 At present, there is no consensus regarding which measures are most appropriate for reducing transmission of community-acquired MRSA in community settings and for preventing the spread of these strains in health-care facilities.",

Since 1997, increasing numbers of ST22-MRSA-IV (UK EMRSA 15) have been detected clinically, on screening, and in the annual surveillance studies. This non-multidrug-resistant clone is the major epidemic strain in Western Australia, where it comprises 21% of all MRSA isolates and 80% of all epidemic strains. A similar trend is occurring on the eastern side of Australia, with Sydney having the highest prevalence of this strain (15% of all MRSA). Nurses coming from the UK are an important source of these isolates, which are often detected on pre-employment screening. This clone has also become established in many long-term care facilities. In addition to nosocomial epidemic MRSA we have been documenting the evolution of true community-acquired MRSA strains in Australia over the past 20 years, such that now we have at least 23 clones that have evolved independently around the country. It is somewhat ironic that Western Australia, the state with the lowest rate of noscomial epidemic MRSA, should now have the highest rate of community-acquired MRSA (75% of all MRSA isolates). These strains, although frequent in admitted patients, rarely seem to be transmitted to others in the hospital. When identified, patients colonised or infected with community-acquired MRSA are managed with enhanced precautions (single room if possible, attention to hand hygiene, contact precautions, and extra cleaning during admission and on discharge). To date, we have not had any major hospital outbreak with community-acquired MRSA, despite an increasing prevalence in the community.",

In addition, staff who have worked clinically outside Western Australia are also screened pre-employment. This screening has led to my colleagues in Sydney, Melbourne, and Brisbane calling us \u201cfortress WA\u201d. We have had a number of outbreaks over the years, particularly in my own hospital, which has a lack of single rooms, but swift screening of contact patients and staff, isolation of colonised patients, attention to hand hygiene, and enhanced ward cleaning has terminated the outbreaks rapidly. We also routinely screen all patients in high-risk areas (intensive care, burns, vascular, and spinal units) on admission, discharge, and after prolonged stay. Decolonisation is initiated for persistently colonised staff and patients likely to have frequent readmissions. In general, topical hexachlorophene or triclosan together with mupirocin nasal ointment is used. However, if oral carriage is detected or the topical regimen fails, systemic therapy with two agents is given. I cannot speak for my colleagues on the other side of Australia who have lived with endemic nosocomial MRSA for many years, but I believe that there are a variety of practices mostly aimed at containment rather than eradication.

It would not be feasible for us to do this with all our community-acquired MRSA isolates but it may be possible for those with PVL.

Although there is some interest in the subject, the risks and safety issues surrounding MRSA are generally not that well known. MRSA carriage is seen as a \u201cstigma\u201d for patients and because colonisation with MRSA is not usually differentiated from an infection, the media are quick to generate a scandal and attach blame to hospitals and doctors when MRSA is reported. Hence, most hospitals tend to refuse MRSA-positive patients to avoid potentially damaging repurcussions for the hospital. Moreover, this situation can lead to clinicians hesitating to identify MRSA carriage of patients who are being transferred to another hospital. In many countries it is strongly recommended that clinicians at the transferring hospital should notify MRSA carriage status of the patient to the infection control team at the receiving hospital before transfer. However, this procedure has not been followed stringently in Japan.",

However, it is still difficult to share microbiological results through a single medical computer network system. Each hospital needs to develop MRSA flagging software for this purpose. Although Japanese hospitals are extensively computerised, the main purpose of the hospital computer system is for ordering and accounting for medical procedures. The data sorting function from previous laboratory results is usually optional. We have recently developed a small computer programme on our hospital network to indicate an \u201calert spot\u201d on the individual patient record window. If a patient has a previous history of being MRSA positive, a red-coloured alert spot automatically appears on the computer display. This alert system helps us to recognise whether the patient is a potential or current MRSA carrier without checking any previous microbiological results, which is usually a tedious and time-consuming procedure for busy clinicians and hospital officers. This function will be introduced to a new hospital computer system in the future. Ideally, these data will become indispensable information for inter-hospital transfers via a shared database that should be set up in the future.",

The main principles are promotion of hand disinfection, identification of MRSA risk patients (carriers and contacts of known MRSA cases), rapid microbiological identification of MRSA, contact isolation of MRSA cases, and treatment of MRSA infections. Emphasis is placed on trying to target preventive measures at the very first steps of possible MRSA transmission. According to the guidelines, every patient who has been treated in a hospital outside of Finland during the previous year and is transferred to a Finnish hospital is screened for MRSA colonisation at the time of hospital admission. Patient records of each MRSA case are labelled accordingly, and an \u201cMRSA alert\u201d is also added to electronic patient records in many institutions. These actions have proven to be effective in controlling several rather large hospital MRSA outbreaks in the 1990s. Some of the international MRSA clones have also repeatedly entered our country via patients or health-care workers who have come from abroad, but they have caused few secondary cases or outbreaks.",

We evaluated our hospital's main nosocomial MRSA clone and tried to track the sources of the clonal types in different clinics by pulsed field gel electrophoresis. One major type was identified among their strains. This single clone was compared with another Turkish university hospital's clone and several main international clones including the Iberian and Brazilian clone, and it was found to be different from them.46 Predominance of this clone or any other clone is not known. This type of evaluation needs to be done by most hospitals. With enough funding a national epidemiological surveillance group should be established.47\n",

Both in Amsterdam and in Utrecht, MRSA was introduced by a patient who had been transferred from a hospital abroad. These early experiences prompted the Dutch Working Party on Infection Prevention (WIP) to formulate national MRSA guidelines. This working group is funded by the Ministry of Health, and its task is to develop guidelines for infection prevention in hospitals, nursing homes and institutions for the mentally handicapped, and dental care and homecare. The guidelines issued by the WIP are considered professional standards and are used as such by the Dutch public health inspector; this undoubtedly contributes to the adherence to the guidelines by nearly all health institutions.",

First, patients with MRSA are always isolated in single rooms, whether they have an active MRSA infection or not\u2014carriers are also considered potential sources of transmission. Isolation for being a carrier raises anxiety in the patient and their relatives. However, 30% of adults are staphylococcal carriers, and they develop an infection only occasionally, so, in itself, carriage of a staphylococcus that has additional resistance is not a source of worry for the individual patient. Second, patients suspected of potential carriage are always placed in isolation; potential carriage is considered in all patients transferred from hospitals abroad to Dutch hospitals, in patients from Dutch hospitals, or from nursing homes with an actual problem of MRSA, and in patients who have been nursed in the same room as a patient in whom MRSA is detected unexpectedly. This isolation may come as a shock to people who become ill abroad, are repatriated, and arrive with a sigh of relief in a hospital in the Netherlands, only to be faced with strict isolation measures, where even the family members have to wear gowns and masks upon entering the patient's room. An often-heard reaction is \u201cam I a leper?\u201d, and it may be taxing to the attending physician to explain the reasoning behind the precautionary measure. Third, contacts of patients with MRSA\u2014both other patients and hospital staff\u2014are screened for MRSA carriage and treated with mupirocin nasal ointment if found positive. This screening can prove trying for staff, because they are not allowed to return to work unless negative. Fortunately, MRSA is usually quickly lost in normal community life or upon treatment with mupirocin nasal ointment. On occasion, a staff member proves to be a \u201cstubborn\u201d carrier, and several courses of mupirocin and the use of disinfectant soap are needed to clear the carriage. This upsets personal life and the working schedules of staff colleagues, who have to fill in for their colleague during the period he or she is not allowed to work. Fortunately, untreatable carriage is very unusual, but may lead to the necessity to change job. The WIP guidelines for MRSA are also published in English and can be found at http://www.wip.nl.",

The decreased therapeutic options, the nightmare of impending vancomycin resistance, and the higher numbers of therapeutic failures that accompany infections with MRSA provide a firm ground for the Dutch policy.

Countries like Finland, Denmark, and the Netherlands have managed to keep MRSA at a low level using surveillance cultures of patients and personnel, strictly enforced contact precautions, and judicious use of broad-spectrum antibiotics. Unfortunately, these countries are facing now the paradoxical situation that transmission of community-acquired MRSA may jeopardise their well-established strategies to control nosocomial MRSA. Denmark, for instance, has seen a substantial increase in MRSA since 2003, due to the epidemic spread of genetically distinct community-acquired MRSA strains.50 Conversely, many middle-income countries (eg, Turkey, Argentina) and some high-income countries (eg, Italy, Greece, UK, USA) that were not able to install stringent counter-measures now have hyper-endemic MRSA and are obliged to concentrate available resources to prevent MRSA infections in high-risk populations\u2014eg, dialysis, transplant, or critically ill patients. A few countries with endemic MRSA (eg, Australia, France, Belgium) have managed to stabilise or even decrease MRSA prevalence in confined geographic areas. On the other hand, several Asian countries (eg, China, South Korea, Japan) have more or less ignored this public-health problem for a long time, resulting in some of the highest MRSA incidence rates worldwide. In these countries, financial incentives for physicians' antibiotic prescribing linked to the pharmaceutical reimbursement system have strongly influenced antibiotic overuse and increased antibiotic selection pressure on MRSA; an issue that has only recently been adequately addressed at the policy level.",
