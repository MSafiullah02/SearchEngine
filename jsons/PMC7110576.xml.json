IPC gaps and needs were discussed at length. International guidelines were universally applied as the basis for IPC programmes in their respective institutions.

These national programmes are responsible for issuing national IPC guidelines, training of healthcare personnel, and monitoring and evaluation. However, published data from a number of LMICs describing outcomes as a result of these national programmes are scarce. Although appropriate IPC measures have been adapted in various institutions, the focus group agreed that it was fundamentally the implementation of such programmes that posed a major challenge in achieving favourable results, meeting IPC goals and ensuring patient safety. In view of the recent outbreaks of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus and Ebola virus, as well as HAIs and AMR, the lack of IPC implementation has been a subject of discussion and concern at various recent international meetings and is now getting the global attention it deserves.",

Kenya has a national IPC strategic plan for 2014\u20132018 and revised its national IPC policy and guidelines in 2015. To facilitate the implementation of the guidelines and bridge the knowledge gap in IPC, the MoH developed a 6-day face-to-face training course on IPC for front-line healthcare workers (nurses, clinicians, pharmacists, laboratory technicians, and microbiologists).

Surveillance data are available from sentinel sites, but are very limited from hospitals across the country due to inadequate laboratory capacity for diagnostics and under-utilized health information systems. The National Patient Safety Survey 2013 revealed a general lack of IPC knowledge and practices among healthcare personnel (An Assessment of Patient Safety Standards in Kenya\u2014Summary Report of the Patient Safety Survey 2013, World Bank; Bridging the Knowledge Gaps, poster presentation at the 17th International Congress on Infectious Diseases in 2016). This was attributed to the lack of technical expertise in IPC at all levels, poor financing for IPC to ensure a continuous supply of commodities, and inadequate physical infrastructure. The lack of surveillance data makes it difficult to measure the burden of HAIs in order to advocate for more investment in IPC. However, the establishment of AMR units in the MoH and East Africa Public Health Laboratory Network represents a promising development towards improving IPC efforts in the near future in Kenya.",

National guidelines on IPC structure, standard and transmission-based precautions, and outbreak control have been implemented gradually since 2007. Prior to that there were individual provincial programmes. Guidelines for the prevention of SSI, CLABSI, CAUTI, and VAP, amongst others, have been introduced nationally, with a significant reduction in HAIs (Figure 1\n). Surveillance of HAIs and AMR is supported by a robust laboratory service. The MoH has established an AMR ministerial advisory committee and IPC is an integral part of this vital programme. Each healthcare institution, including community-based facilities, has a named IPC practitioner. A basic level IPC course (6 months) is offered to all healthcare workers, managers, and non-clinical staff. More than 89% of practitioners have been formally trained at the basic level. A diploma (1 year) or postgraduate diploma in IPC (PDIC) (2 years part-time) is also offered. To date, 93 IPC practitioners have completed the PDIC. In 2015, the first two Masters in IPC graduated from Stellenbosch University, South Africa. The major drawback for IPC in South Africa is that it is not currently recognized as an independent subspecialty in the country, increasing the urgent need for structured career paths.",

Ideally, there must be practices in place to evaluate the effectiveness of these graded measures in a given work environment. Such evaluation, as well as innovative measures for IPC that can more easily be applied in the LMIC setting, could be supported by the ISID research grant programme (http://www.isid.org/grants/grants_research.shtml) or other initiatives that support capacity building in LMICs. The ISID Guide to Infection Control in the Hospital serves as a free resource for IPC programme recommendations and improving programme implementation efforts. Future editions of this guide may be applied as an evidence-based, multi-modal, point-of-care mobile resource to assist in the prioritization and implementation of local infection prevention strategies. Another important resource is the INICC multidimensional infection control approach.",

This article illustrates the current status of IPC programmes in selected countries, including the main gaps and challenges. It is important to have a systematic process to evaluate the IPC status in LMICs overall, and to ensure that basic IPC and AMR strategies are implemented. Open training resources and guidelines need to be easily accessible. Studies from LMICs are urgently needed to better describe the local epidemiology of HAIs and to identify successful approaches better suited to the needs of these countries.",
