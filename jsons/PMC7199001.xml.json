Chinese media has exposed a number of listed companies, such as China Railway Construction Corporation and Zhuhai Gree Group, spending staggering amount of money on top managers' entertainment. A major stream of research investigates the causes of SOE senior executives' perk consumption from such aspects as the agency cost (Jensen and Meckling, 1976; Hart, 2001), internal and external governance mechanisms (Brickley and James, 1987; Yermack, 2006; Grinstein et al., 2017), and management incentives (Rajan and Wulf, 2006). However, there has been little research to examine the effect of policy burdens on the senior executives' perks under the socialist economy.",

            "text": "We are motivated to examine SOE policy burdens and senior executives' perks in China for the following reasons. Firstly, during the process of national economic development, most Chinese SOEs bear policy burdens imposed by the government (Lin et al., 1998), including strategic policy burdens and the social policy burdens (Lin and Tan, 1999). For example, the government directs SOEs to develop national strategic industries, regarding energy, communications and transportation etc. Besides, SOEs are required by the government to recruit redundant staff and not to lay off workers for the maintenance of social stability (Lin and Li, 2008). The policy burdens serve as a means by which the government intervenes in the economy (Li, 2008). It is therefore difficult for the government to distinguish losses induced by policy burdens from those of SOEs\u2019 poor managerial performance. This challenge worsens information asymmetry and, in turn, increases agency cost which causes soft budget constraints, rent seeking, the moral hazard, managerial slacks, and corruption (Kornai, 1980; Lin and Li, 2008; Ting and Huang, 2018; Fang et al., 2018; Guo, 2018; Zhao et al., 2019; Yu and Lee, 2016). These issues constitute the political cost incurred by SOE policy burdens. Research on the association between SOE policy burdens and excessive perks of senior executives could shed light on the political cost.",

For example, in 2013, the annual accounting report of China Railway Construction Corporation, a large SOE engaged in railway construction, exposed an enormous sum of perks among which the entertainment expense reached $118 million, accounting for nearly 10% of the company's net profit that year. In addition, Chinese media reveal that managers of Sinopec's Guangdong Petroleum Branch and Zhuhai Gree Group consumed a large quantity of luxurious liquor. Atkinson and Stiglitz (2015) suggest that Chinese SOE managers are more likely to spend ludicrously on such things as food, clothing, housing, transportation, and entertainment at the company's expense. Some studies estimate perks can amount to 15%\u201332% of total executive compensation (Kato and Long, 2006). Therefore, it is of great practical significance to study the perks of SOE executives.",

Based on a sample of listed SOEs over 2010\u20132018 period (5991 firm-year observations), we demonstrate that SOE policy burdens are significantly and positively associate with excessive managerial perks. We conduct robustness tests to mitigate the negative influence of endogeneity and find their results remain qualitatively robust. The further analysis suggests that strategic policy burdens of SOEs have stronger positive correlation with excessive perks than social policy burdens do. Additionally, the positive correlation between policy burdens and excessive perks is significantly weaker in eastern coastal provinces of China due to the higher degree of marketization. It is significantly mitigated in centrally administered SOEs (CSOEs) as they are subject to stricter supervision of Chinese central government.",

We find significantly positive impact of SOE policy burdens on senior executives\u2019 excessive perks. Further, we find that compared with social policy burdens, strategic policy burdens have significantly stronger positive correlation with excessive perks. It provides enlightenment for the further research and valuable insights to policymakers and regulators not only in China, but in other countries concerning policy burdens.",

Previous studies generally attribute managers' perks to their agency behavior (Jensen and Meckling, 1976; Hart, 2001; Yermack, 2006), internal corporate governance mechanism (Brickley and James (1987); Claessens et al. (2002); Andrews et al. (2017), external supervision (Yermack (2006); Bushee et al. (2010); Andrews et al., 2017) and insufficient compensation incentives (Rajan and Wulf, 2006; Marino and Zabojnik, 2008; Kato and Long, 2006; Adithipyangkul et al., 2011). We further this direction of research from a new perspective. In addition, existing research regards perks as a whole, which gives rise to two competing views of perk consumption. The first view argues that perks are a tool for senior managers to misappropriate a firm's surplus (Jensen and Meckling, 1976; Hart, 2001; Yermack, 2006). The alternative view is that perks can be an incentive in an optimal employment contract to motivate employees (Fama, 1980; Rajan and Wulf, 2006). However, it indicates that managerial perks can be a result of both agency costs and nonmonetary incentives (Cai et al., 2011). In our study, we follow Luo et al. (2011) to separate senior executives' excessive perks and examine its relationship with SOE policy burdens, which thus enriches the research on perk consumption.",

Jensen and Meckling (1976) point out, due to the separation of ownership and management, managers tend to seek perks by misappropriating corporate resources, which is detrimental to the firm value. Large consumption of perks could be incurred in the businesses where their managerial ownership is small and corporate governance is weak. The consumption of perks is more likely to be found in mature companies which possess less growth opportunities but more cash flow (Grossman and Hart, 1983; Jensen, 1986). Likewise, Hart (2001) proves that perks are derived from executives' exploitation of the corporate resources in their own interests. Subsequent research finds that senior executives' perk consumption has negative influence on the enterprises. It could foster low morale, drastically reducing corporate performance (Yermack, 2006). Managerial perks are associated with poor accounting disclosures (Gul et al., 2011). Moreover, the weaker the corporate governance, the more perks CEOs consume (Andrews et al., 2017).",

Institutional investors could be another factor to influence the agency cost. High institutional ownership, could reduce perks consumed by CEOs (Claessens et al., 2002). It is further supported by Chen et al. (2019) who find the diversified large shareholders could result in lower perks consumed by managers. Firms with foreign ownership discourage excessive perk consumption. Conversely, the consumption of perks could be encouraged in firms with weak corporate governance (Andrews et al., 2017). Luo et al. (2011) find high corporate shareholding proportion of the banks leads to big CEO perks. Ting and Huang (2018) find that greater perks could be incurred by CEOs with more power in the board of directors.",

First, audit quality of accounting firms could influence consumption of managerial perks (Yermack, 2006). Second, media exposure can provide strong external governing pressure on managerial perks (Bushee et al., 2010). Dai et al. (2015) find that local newspapers can report enterprises' illegal behaviors earlier and faster, which has a more effective constraint on the perks. Third, enhanced SEC disclosure requirements impose greater pressure on managerial perks. Grinstein et al. (2017) find evidence that CEO who used to enjoy abnormally high compensation reduced or eliminated perks after SEC tightened the disclosure requirements on executive compensation in 2006. Fourth, the implementation of the political and economic system reform alleviates the consumption of managerial perks. Xin and Tan (2009) find that China's market-oriented reform may reduce the perks of SOEs' senior executives. Fang et al. (2018) discover that the perks used to build political rapport declined after the 18th National Congress of the Chinese Communist Party, or after the anti-corruption campaign. However, CEOs, especially of centrally administered SOEs in China, who subject to pay restrictions imposed by Chinese central government, make more perk consumption in their own interest (Bae et al., 2019).",

Perks may serve as a component of a complex compensation package to motivate employees to work harder and thus may actually increase firm value (Fama, 1980). Marino and Zabojnik (2008) find that more perks would be awarded in firms in more uncertain production environments and firms with better corporate governance. Company owners may allow their managers' discretion in consumption of certain perks such as entertainment, dining, traveling, etc.(Zhang et al., 2014), especially when the monetary compensation of executives is low (Zhao, 2019). Further, evidence of perks as managerial incentives in Chinese enterprises has been confirmed in some research. It's been a traditional compensation treatment under Chinese corporate culture to provide non-cash perks (Kato and Long, 2006; Chen et al., 2010; Luo et al., 2011). Adithipyangkul et al. (2011) find that owing to the Chinese institutional background, the existence of pay restriction and government administrative intervention makes listed companies more inclined to use perks to replace monetary compensation to motivate managers.",

In 1950s, Chinese government realized that in order to transform China from an underdeveloped agricultural country into a developed industrial one, it had to establish an independent and complete industrial system. The key foundation is heavy industry. Therefore, since the first five-year plan, Chinese government has given priority to the development of heavy industry, and the subsequent five-year plans follow this development strategy. The heavy industry normally requires decades to develop with huge investment. However, as an underdeveloped agricultural country, China featured scarce capital and sufficient labor. It violated the theory of comparative advantage to develop heavy industry. Thus, private enterprises were unwilling to invest in heavy industry. SOEs were then required to prioritize the development of heavy industry, which is strategic policy burdens (Lin and Tan, 1999). The imbalanced industry development strategy couldn't ensure enough jobs for urban residents, which negatively impact social stability. In order to provide sufficient job positions, the government asked SOEs to hire as many workers as possible. That is SOE social policy burdens. When reform and opening-up began in 1978, SOEs dominated China's industrial sectors. SOEs' share in China's total industrial output was 77.6% in 1978. Until 1996, SOEs still employed 57.4% of urban residents and possessed 52.2% of total investment in industrial fixed assets (Lin et al., 1998).",

Many scholars believe competitive market mechanism can alleviate the aforementioned agency problems (Megginson and Netter, 2001). On the one hand, the competitiveness mechanism in the product market could mitigate information asymmetry between managers and owners. The profit status of an industry is public information in a fully competitive market. Shareholders can assess a manager's performance by comparing with the actual profit status of the company (Stigler and Friedland, 1983). Such public information also enables shareholders to structure a manager's remuneration package based on their performance comparison, and therefore, discourage shirking and opportunistic behaviors (Grossman and Hart, 1983; Gupta et al., 2017). On the other hand, the competitive manager market could restrain the agency behaviors of executives by means of its reputation mechanism. Fama (1980) argue that in a competitive manager market, managers are self-conscious about their performance record and will constantly seek market rewards. Competent managers will be hired with high salaries, and the rewards offered by their employers will be equivalent to the value of managers' human capital. Therefore, managers must work hard to improve their reputation and value in order to improve their future reward (Fee et al., 2018).",

SOEs undertake both strategic policy burdens and social policy burdens. The former drives SOEs to invest in capital-intensive industries, which violates the theory of comparative advantage. The latter keeps SOEs overstaffed for social stability. Such social policy burdens have greatly increased labor costs and make them less competitive in the market. In return, the Chinese government lends a hand to SOEs. For example, commercial banks are required to make loans to SOEs with low interest rates (Faccio, 2006; Li et al., 2008). The government supports SOEs in mergers and acquisitions to increase market shares (Shleifer and Vishny, 1994). And SOEs could acquire cheap raw material and preferential tax policies, which reduce their operation cost (Faccio, 2006; Lin and Li, 2008). Therefore, SOEs\u2019 performance is not only influenced by market competitiveness but also by policy burdens and government support. It is not reasonable to assess managerial performance by comparing SOE performance with that of their counterparts.",

This enhances information asymmetry. Second, the policy burdens expand and complicate SOEs\u2019 business and managerial activity (Lin and Li, 2008). For example, local government often assigns SOEs poverty alleviation tasks such as local infrastructure work and public service.

On August 29, 2014, Politburo of the CPC Central Committee reviewed and approved the Reform Plan for the Compensation System for Persons in Charge of CSOEs. The \u201cpay cap\u201d has led to an overall decline in SOE managers\u2019 monetary compensation.

It suggests excessive perks are prevalent in firms with large cash reserve and higher profit or return on assets. ExPerk is significantly positively related with Dual and Tenure, indicating that the more power a manager possesses or the longer he holds office, the more excessive perks occur. A significantly positive correlation is also found between ExPerk and Age.

SOE policy burdens bring negative impact on SOE performance while government support induced is beneficial to their performance.

Thus, there has been a lot \u201cnoise\u201d in the process of evaluating SOE executives' performance, which makes it difficult to motivate executives by using pay-for-performance scheme. The governments, therefore, attempted to restrain SOE executives' compensation. Currently, pay ceiling has been set to SOE executives\u2019 compensation. Many SOE executives believe their remunerations are undervalued by the government and felt a sense of injustice. As a result, they are motivated to abuse their managerial power for perk consumption.

On August 29, 2014, the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee approved a document entitled Opinions on Reasonably Determining and Strictly Regulating CSOE Senior Executives' Position Benefits and Business Expenses. It sets the ceiling of expenses on 7 categories, such as official cars, offices, training, business entertainment, domestic travel, short-term business trips abroad, and communications. China's Audit Commission has strengthened its audit supervision over centrally administered SOEs year by year. On June 25, 2015, it reported 14 centrally administered SOEs, many high profile SOEs such as China National Nuclear Corporation (CNNC), which have violated the internal control regulations and the anti-corruption rulings. In addition, after the 18th National Congress of CPC, the central government has appointed inspection groups to centrally administered SOEs in an attempt to strengthen its supervision. There has been an increased number of SOE executives exposed for consuming excessive perks. As a result, executives from centrally administered SOEs have become more cautious over consuming excessive perks. However, the supervision has been much weaker at local governments. Local audit authorities rarely disclose their audit reports, and hardly take stringent measures over local SOEs. Therefore, we expect a weaker association between centrally administered SOE policy burdens and excessive perks. We construct a dummy variable, Cntrl. It equals 1 if SOEs are centrally administered, and 0 otherwise. We then capture the moderating effect of tighter central government supervision by employing the interaction of Cntrl and Burden in model (6).(6)ExPerki,t=\u03b20+\u03b21Burdeni,t+\u03b22Cntrli,t+\u03b23Burdeni,t\u00d7Cntrli,t+\u03a3\u03b2ContrlVars+\u03b5\n",

The empirical analysis shows that SOE policy burdens are significantly positively correlated with senior executives' excessive perks. We conduct a series of robustness tests, e.g. fixed effects panel regression analysis, Heckman two-stage test, two-stage-least squares regression, and DID test. Our conclusion remains robust. Further analysis demonstrates that compared with the social policy burdens, the strategic policy burdens have stronger impact on senior executives' excessive perks. In the eastern coastal provinces of China, the positive correlation between the SOE policy burdens and excessive perks is significantly weaker due to the higher degree of marketization. As centrally administered SOEs are subject to stricter supervision, the positive impact of their policy burdens on excessive perks is significantly weaker.",
