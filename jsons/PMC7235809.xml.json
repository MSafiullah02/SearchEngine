            "text": "Until recently, infectious diseases such as dengue fever, yellow fever, influenza, malaria, middle east respiratory syndrome (MERS), Zika fever, and Ebola have consistently occurred in various countries in the world, which has been causing a serious global threat to many countries and humans. Moreover, a new coronavirus has recently emerged in Wuhan city of China, which has the potential to spread as a serious pandemic worldwide through contact and interaction between humans. Zoonosis induces very serious diseases in human society. From this perspective, Toxoplasma gondii is a parasite that is found in all warm-blooded animals, including birds and marine animals. In addition, T. gondii is a zoonotic parasite that induces toxoplasmosis in humans by consuming particularly raw or undercooked meat, and by being infected via physical contact with feces of pets and companion animals such as cats. It causes serious chronic diseases through its infection at all ages, including both adults and young children. Biologically, T. gondii not only has similar intracellular organelles, such as eukaryotic cells, but also includes various and unique micro-organelles, such as rhoptries, conoids, micronemes, apicoplasts, endosome compartments, and a basal complex. Furthermore, T. gondii has an inner membrane complex (IMC) and plasma membrane that consist of a unique double membrane structure, which acts as a protective wall for the survival, cell division, and proliferation of T. gondii [1,2,3,4]. In particular, T. gondii proliferates through a unique form of cell division, such as amoeba, slipper-animalcule, or bacteria, which indicates a characteristic of endodyogeny. T. gondii proliferates and grows into a vacuole membrane by forming a parasitophorous vacuole membrane (PVM) in host cells after infection as a key feature [5,6,7]. ",

            "text": "Recently, zoonotic diseases have been causing a major public health concern worldwide by frequently occurring in various countries, which is a major concern at global, regional, and country levels. Efforts to overcome these challenges of zoonotic diseases have been attempted in various research groups and pharmaceutical industry fields, including global non-profit organizations. In particular, it was reported that extracts derived from medicinal plants and compounds significantly induced anti-T. gondii effects/activity in the in vivo and in vitro stages [8,9,10,11,12,13]. Nevertheless, effective drugs of next generation for inhibiting T. gondii have not yet been developed. In this regard, the difficulty of developing drugs against parasitic zoonosis not only consistently causes a public health crisis worldwide, but also increases the risk of unknown zoonosis. Although various compounds, biomedicine, and/or vaccines have continuously been developed for treating infectious disease such as Zika fever, malaria, tuberculosis, acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS), influenza, and/or parasite infection in the past decades, people are still widely exposed to various threats, including drug-resistance [14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22]. Moreover, viruses and parasites have advanced their biological evolution, as well as evasive techniques, for survival by effectively sustaining the enduring interactions with humans and/or the natural environment. The influenza virus is a major pathogen that consistently causes acute infectious respiratory diseases in humans, and has recently induced a serious public health concern worldwide by overcoming the limits of the species barrier. In addition, the influenza virus consists of various constitutive factors, including seven or eight single-strand RNAs, neuraminidase, hemagglutinin, virus matrix protein M1, proton channel M2, and a lipid bilayer, and its genome has increased the resistance and/or evasion strategy against existing drugs and environmental changes through mutations. For these reasons, the various antigens of pathogens have been utilized as a major factor in solutions for the prevention and treatment of infectious diseases and zoonosis. Furthermore, vaccine techniques and methods through unique antigens (such as DNA, RNA, and proteins) of pathogens have recently advanced, and have been effectively utilized for blocking and preventing infectious diseases [23,24,25,26,27]. However, despite these efforts, an effective vaccine against toxoplasmosis has not yet been developed or launched clinically.",

Furthermore, the SAG1 has not yet been reported as a virus-like particle (VLP) form for the vaccination of T. gondii and toxoplasmosis. The studies for developing and/or discovering effective and novel vaccine candidates against T. gondii are urgently required. In these aspects, this study started from the hypothesis that SAG1-VLP conflated with SAG1 and the influenza virus matrix protein may induce the protective effect and vaccine efficacy against T. gondii infection. For this reason, this study was performed to evaluate the vaccination effect of SAG1-VLP formed by the influenza A matrix protein and the specific SAG1 antigen of T. gondii as an effective strategy for preventing and/or blocking toxoplasmosis and T. gondii infection, and to confirm the potential and the utility of SAG1-VLP as a vaccine candidate against T. gondii infection.",

This study developed a vaccine candidate that induces effective immunogenicity and vaccination efficacy against T. gondii infection using the influenza matrix and SAG1 among various subcellular organelles of the parasite. T. gondii-specific SAG1 and influenza matrix genes were amplified by RT-PCR and PCR with their specific primers using the total RNA of T. gondii and the synthesized matrix genes respectively, and their specific genes were cloned into a pFastBac vector (Figure 2). Subsequently, T. gondii-specific SAG1-VLPs containing T. gondii SAG1 and influenza matrix protein were generated in Sf9 cells, and the VLPs were confirmed through western blot analysis (Figure 3). The generation principle of VLPs containing T. gondii SAG1 and influenza matrix protein is shown in Figure 4. Recently, various studies regarding vaccination have been reported, especially research on vaccines against parasites. However, recent studies showed the limitation that they could not inhibit toxoplasmosis induced by T. gondii infection. In this regard, the results of this study provide the accurate information on VLPs through their molecular weight when matrix protein 1 includes or does not include the specific antigen as spikes, which indicates the potential and utility of them as an antigen delivery system of vaccination for preventing T. gondii infection. Therefore, these results clearly indicate the SAG1-VLPs formed through the T. gondii SAG1 antigen and the matrix protein 1, as well as the VLP formed through only matrix protein 1, without the specific antigen or spikes.

Infectious pathogens are still increasing and evolving their adaptability to environmental variation through infectivity to the host and their viability. Furthermore, many people are still dying by infectious diseases such as influenza, tuberculosis, dengue fever, and malaria every year worldwide. In this aspect, the international organizations and companies, including WHO and global pharmaceuticals, are persistently supporting various studies on treating and preventing acute or chronic infectious diseases, which are being focused on studies for developing vaccines and novel drugs against pathogens. Recently, animal infectious diseases, such as Avian influenza (AI) and African swine fever (ASF), are causing a pandemic worldwide, and they have the potential to be transmitted to humans by overcoming limitations of the interspecies barrier though their mutation. Furthermore, although studies for preventing or inhibiting parasitosis and zoonosis have been performed in various fields worldwide, effective drugs have not yet been launched clinically, which is consistently causing a public health concern worldwide. Recently, the number of people living with companion animals (cats and dogs, etc.) has been increasing globally, but infectious diseases which are induced by them have been overlooked and have not attracted attention.

            "text": "For these reasons, this study focused on toxoplasmosis among zoonosis that is transmitted by various infectious pathways. Toxoplasmosis is a zoonotic parasitosis that infects humans through feces of cats and dogs, including vertebrates. In particular, T. gondii induces not only serious complications in pregnant women, immune deficient patients, and HIV patients, but also cerebral calcification and toxoplasmic encephalitis through brain infection. T. gondii infection regulates the response of T. gondii IgG seroprevalence that specifically responds to T. gondii in patients. T. gondii may affect the production and interaction of cytokines, as well as induce an imbalance of the immune response through a change of the cytokines after infection, which results in immune deficiency by weakening homeostasis of the immune system in the host [30,31,32,33]. Moreover, it is known that T. gondii blocks or inhibits the signal pathways of cell cycle initiators or the apoptotic stage in host cells. T. gondii promotes its proliferation by rapidly forming PVM or regulating cell cycle factors of the host for survival after invasion, which finally increases the viability of T. gondii in the host [34,35]. Recently the subcellular organelles of T. gondii, such as dense granules (GRAs), the rhoptry, the microneme, and the inner membrane complex, have been used as major recombinant proteins and/or antigens for vaccine candidates, as well as major targets for inhibiting T. gondii infection. Furthermore, various studies regarding vaccine development have been reported, particularly vaccine researches against T. gondii infection [36,37,38,39,40], as well as the surface antigens and recombinant chimeric proteins of T. gondii [41,42,43,44]. Nevertheless, the recent studies have still difficulties in relation to parasite infection and its treatment. ",

            "text": "From these perspectives, this study tried to find feasible alternatives for overcoming toxoplasmosis induced by T. gondii infection, and to discover an effective vaccine candidate for preventing and inhibiting the parasite infection and zoonosis. In particular, the various components and factors of both the virus and T. gondii can be effectively utilized or applied in vaccine development fields. For this reason, this study focused on developing a novel vaccine candidate through the T. gondii antigen and VLP of the virus as one of the various strategies for developing novel vaccines against parasite infection, and evaluated the protective effect and efficacy of a novel vaccine candidate against T. gondii infection. In the present study, T. gondii-specific SAG1 and influenza matrix genes were cloned into a pFastBac vector, which was clearly confirmed through RT-PCR and PCR analysis. The expression of T. gondii SAG1-VLPs was confirmed by western blot analysis. The results clearly indicated the SAG1-VLPs expressed by T. gondii-specific SAG1 antigen and influenza matrix protein 1 as well as the VLPs without the antigen, which remedied the uncertainty and incorrect results of recent VLP studies by clearly presenting the difference regarding the formation of VLP. In addition, the antibody (IgG, IgG1, IgG2a, and IgA) levels of mice were significantly increased in all groups after origin and boost immunization, and the antibodies were effectively produced in the group immunized with SAG1-VLPs compared to non-immunized groups. These results show that SAG1-VLPs not only effectively caused the immunogenicity by inducing the production of specific antibodies through the parasite-specific antigen after twice immunizations, but also persistently increased the protective actions against T. gondii infection by effectively inducing or accelerating the progressive maturation of specific antibodies. Although the cytokines (IL-1\u03b2, IL-4, IL-6, IL-12, TNF-\u03b1, and IFN-\u03b3) were increased in all groups after the parasite infection, the cytokine levels of the group immunized with SAG1-VLPs were markedly reduced compared to the non-immunized infection group. The results clearly indicated that SAG1-VLP immunization significantly reduced the production of cytokines which are induced by the parasite infection by effectively generating T. gondii-specific antibodies through twice immunizations. In particular, the neutralizing effect of the immunized antibodies is an indicator which shows the inhibition and preventive ability against pathogens as a major factor of the vaccination effect. The survival rates of T. gondii were significantly inhibited in the group immunized with SAG1-VLPs compared to the non-immunized group, and the cell viability of TLA-treated splenocytes was markedly decreased in the non-immunized group. Furthermore, the survival rate of the group immunized with SAG1-VLPs was 75% for 35 days after T. gondii infection, whereas the non-immunized infection group all died within 18 days after the parasite infection. The results demonstrate that SAG1-VLPs effectively induced the activity of antibodies as well as the vaccination effect/action against T. gondii infection through immunization. ",

The SAG1-VLPs showed the effective immunogenicity action/function by consistently inducing or promoting the production of the T. gondii-specific antibody after twice immunizations. The results indicated that SAG1-VLP immunization effectively decreased the inflammatory cytokines (IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, and TNF-\u03b1), as well as the anti-inflammatory cytokines (IL-4, IL-12, and IFN-\u03b3) after T. gondii infection. Furthermore, the sera immunized with SAG1-VLPs showed a neutralizing activity/effect by inhibiting the proliferation and growth of T. gondii through specific antibodies generated by the immunization, and the immunization of SAG1-VLPs exhibited a protective effect against TLA by effectively increasing and activating the viability of splenocytes infected with TLA. In particular, SAG1-VLP immunization effectively increased the survival rate of the mice by specifically inhibiting or blocking the death of mice which is induced by the proliferation of T. gondii after T. gondii infection.
