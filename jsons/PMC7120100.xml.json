Prophylactic vaccines prevent disability and disease, saving millions of dollars in potential health-care spending. Since prophylactic vaccines are administered to healthy individuals, including infants and children, it is important to demonstrate the safety of vaccines preclinically prior to testing the vaccine in clinical studies. A benefit-to-risk profile is considered for each individual vaccine and depends on many factors including preclinical and clinical toxicities that are observed, frequency of administration and intended target population. For prophylactic vaccines, in particular, the concerns about potential risks often outweigh the perception of benefit [1]. Therefore, over the past decade, there has been an increased focus on nonclinical safety assessment of vaccines, including toxicity testing.",

Next generation vaccines are being designed not only for prevention of infectious diseases but also for treating chronic diseases such as hepatitis C or cancer. Next generation vaccines aim to induce strong humoral and cell-mediated immune responses and include both prophylactic and therapeutic vaccines. Next generation vaccines are often produced synthetically or purified from pathogens, and include antigens (proteins, peptides or carbohydrates) capable of inducing humoral and cellular immune responses. These new epitopes are often weak immunogens; therefore, they need to be presented in multimeric form, conjugated, or formulated with immune potentiators such as adjuvants in order to elicit a stronger immune response [2]. Next generation vaccines include virus-like particles (VLPs) that are noninfectious but are immunogenic, or can act as carriers to linked peptide-antigens. Next generation vaccines also include DNA vaccines which transfect cells in order to express the antigen of interest, and are delivered either in a plasmid form or vectored using an intact bacteria or virus.",

Local reactions are often observed with vaccines administered via the intramuscular or subcutaneous routes of administration, and there are concerns about the severity of pain, redness, swelling, in addition to formation of granulomas and abcesses at the injection site, necrosis and regional lymphadenopathy [3]. Vaccines might induce systemic reactions, including nausea, diarrhea and general malaise. Potentially severe responses might include anaphylaxis, pyrogenic fever responses, organ specific toxicity, or immune-mediated toxicities (such as cytokine release, immune activation or suppression, and autoimmune diseases). Other potential concerns include effects on reproduction and development, and carcinogenicity. For live or attenuated pathogen-based vaccines, there is a risk of reversion to virulence in addition to concerns regarding administration of the vaccine to subjects who have an impaired immune system. For next generation vaccines which include adjuvants, there are potential synergies and interactions between the mechanisms of action for vaccine antigens and adjuvants. Adjuvants typically act by enhancing the immune response, and might cause excessive amounts of pro-inflammatory and pyrogenic mediators leading to an exacerbation of both local and systemic effects [3]. Next generation vaccines that are DNA-based or vectored have specific risks of recombination and integration into the host genome. Therefore, the biodistribution, integration, and persistence of the DNA or vector are important evaluations for DNA-based and vectored vaccines.",

In many cases, rodents or rabbits are used for the toxicology evaluation. Nonhuman primates are only used if no other relevant species exist. Disease models are typically not used for toxicology studies, but supplementary studies in disease models could be used to address specific toxicology concerns. For example, a transgenic mouse model of Alzheimer\u2019s disease, which over-expresses the human \u03b2-amyloid protein, could be used to demonstrate that Alzheimer\u2019s disease vaccine candidates do not cause meningoencephalitis or microhemorrhage in the brain [25].",

In addition, the full-human dose of the vaccine or the maximum amount that can be injected into the selected animal species also results in much higher exposure to the vaccine in animals based on their smaller body weight compared to humans. Importantly, the vaccine formulation used in toxicology studies should be representative of the proposed clinical formulation. Therefore, for adjuvanted vaccines, the vaccine antigen(s) and adjuvant are tested together based on the evidence that immune response to adjuvanted vaccine can only be evaluated within the confines of immunogenicity of the vaccine antigens [26].",

An assessment of local reactogenicity is performed after each vaccine dose is administered. Specific safety pharmacology evaluations (e.g., body temperature, electrocardiogram, and central nervous system evaluations) could be incorporated within the repeat-dose toxicity study [27]. For vaccines that are administered intramuscularly, particular attention is focused on redness and swelling at the injection site and impairment of limb use after the injection. Clinical chemistry (urinalyses, hematology, serum biochemistry, coagulation) evaluations are typically performed a few days after the first vaccination and at the scheduled necropsies. Immunogenicity assessments are performed at the end of the study (as described in Sect. 3.1). Ophthalmic examinations are included after the first vaccination and prior to the first necropsy. Necropsies are performed on two occasions: (1) 1\u20133 days after the last dose is administered and (2) after a treatment-free period of 2\u20134 weeks (to determine whether any effects detected at the first necropsy have started to recover with time).

For example, for a therapeutic vaccine, the interval between dose administrations in animals would follow the clinical study design very closely, including the total number of doses and dosing intervals; whereas for a prophylactic vaccine, the dosing interval could be condensed in the animals (e.g., clinical dosing frequency of once-every-3-months could be condensed to once-every-3-weeks in the toxicology study) and one more dose is administered in animals when compared with the number of doses in the clinical regimen. There is a perception that there is a potential difference in the tolerance for adverse effects for therapeutic vaccines when compared with prophylactic vaccines, since therapeutic vaccines address life-threatening conditions for which there might be no other treatment options. However, the benefit-to-risk ratio needs to be carefully evaluated depending on the target population. It should be noted that certain target populations for therapeutic vaccines might be immunosuppressed due to other concomitant medications. Therefore, caution is needed when evaluating the benefit-to-risk ratio for both therapeutic and prophylactic vaccines.",

Novel adjuvants that are being tested in clinical trials currently include mineral salts (e.g., aluminum hydroxide), oil emulsions (e.g., MF59), particulate adjuvants (e.g., virosomes and ISCOMS), microbial derivatives (e.g., monophosphorylated lipid A), and endogenous immunomodulators (e.g., human GM-CSF).

It is proposed that toxicological characterization of chemical-based adjuvants in a manner similar to all new chemical entities (NCEs) is desired in order to understand their unique toxicity profiles [6, 16].

The doses tested would reflect the targeted clinical use, which is typically much lower than the maximum tolerated dose. The purpose of the toxicology studies with adjuvant alone is to establish a margin of safety rather than a maximum tolerated dose. Full necropsy and histopathology are included in the repeat-dose toxicity study. Similar to other NCEs, an assessment of genotoxicity potential of novel chemical adjuvants is also recommended using the standard battery of tests (e.g., potential for gene mutation, chromosome aberrations, and primary DNA damage) [28]. Carcinogenicity studies are not required for adjuvants, since they are only used a few times at low doses.

In developing the TTC concept, an Expert Group under the International Life Sciences Institute (ILSI) considered a wide range of toxicological concerns including metabolism and accumulation, structural alerts, endocrine disrupting chemicals, genetic toxicity, carcinogenicity, neurotoxicity, teratogenicity, developmental toxicity, allergenicity, and immunotoxicity [37]. This published work has been adopted by the European Medicines Agency for establishing a guideline on the limits of genotoxic impurities in pharmaceutical development [38].

            "text": "Animal species that are used in nonclinical safety studies with vaccine candidates should be able to mount an immune response, for example, antibody levels to the vaccine antigens. At the same time, toxicology studies are expected to be conducted in a laboratory animal species, for which historical control data exist to help distinguish true toxicity caused by the tested vaccine from potential background (not test article-treatment related) lesions occasionally found during a thorough histopathological examination of most organs and tissues involved in such studies. Rats are most commonly used in toxicology studies with a broad range of chemical entities and they are typically the species of choice for toxicity studies with vaccine candidates. However, rats are rarely used in nonclinical pharmacology studies that are focused on protective or therapeutic immune responses to a vaccine candidate. Instead, mice, rabbits and/or nonhuman primates (NHPs) are typical species in vaccine pharmacology studies based on available models of diseases and attempts to predict immune responses from animals to humans. In order to \u201cbridge\u201d the toxicology and pharmacology animal species, a measurement of immune responses in species selected for nonclinical safety evaluation (e.g., rats) to a vaccine candidate is included in a separate study or within a repeat-dose toxicity study [39]. This approach provides indirect evidence of the exposure and activity of the vaccine and is aligned with the general principle of all toxicology studies, in which the demonstration of the animal exposure to a test article following the administration of this test article in the course of a study is required. However, based on recent discussions and some regulatory guidelines [6], there are additional expectations (if not requirements) for toxicology studies of vaccines, that is, the animal species should be sensitive to the pathogenic organism or toxin targeted by the vaccine-induced immune response. Addressing this expectation in toxicology studies may be problematic when the \u201cdisease-sensitive species\u201d are different from the \u201croutine species\u201d because the former are not well characterized to provide reliable data to distinguish between \u201cbackground\u201d lesions relative to what may be considered a vaccine-related effect. Typically, a solution to this problem would involve the use of more than one species to evaluate safety of such vaccine candidate; for example, using a routine species in a well-controlled toxicity study (i.e., compliant with Good Laboratory Practice regulation) and a nonroutine species in an exploratory safety study, which is likely less comprehensive but with endpoints focused on pathogen-specific concerns [23]. In both types of studies, the immune response to the vaccine should be demonstrated.",

            "text": "Traditional vaccines containing aluminum salts as adjuvants have predominantly functioned via local rather than systemic mechanisms, and a systemic inflammatory response to these vaccines has generally not been a concern. However, as indicated above, the theoretical concern of synergistic immune stimulation seems to be heightened for novel, particularly \u201cmolecular\u201d adjuvants such as Toll-like receptor (TLR) agonists [43] and cytokines [44, 45]. The safety concerns for the use of immunostimulatory adjuvants include potential excessive pro-inflammatory and pyrogenic responses (IL-6, TNF\u03b1, IL-8, IL-1\u03b2, PGE2); stronger or unexpected organ specific toxicity (local inflammation, cell death, immuno-dysregulation); severe local reactogenicity (increased vascular permeability, cellular infiltration, fluid accumulation); and break-down of self tolerance (dysregulation of T cells and other host cells). Therefore, the potential for a systemic inflammatory response for vaccines, particularly those containing immuno-active adjuvants, is expected to be assessed within the nonclinical \u00adtoxicology studies. While there are several examples of animal safety studies conducted with a novel adjuvant alone or included as a control group for the toxicology study with a vaccine containing that adjuvant, including oligonucleotides (e.g., CpG DNA sequences [46]), oil emulsions (e.g., MF59 [47]), and saponin-based (e.g., QS-21 [48]) adjuvants, they generally confirmed the expected dose-dependent effects based on mechanisms of action, but did not reveal any findings of toxicological concerns. In contrast, there are examples of unwanted immune responses in patients treated with experimental therapeutic vaccines in clinical trials. One example of adverse T cell-mediated toxicity induced by a therapeutic vaccine involved an amyloid-\u03b2 vaccine AN1792, consisting of A\u03b21-42 amyloid antigen and the QS-21 adjuvant, used in clinical studies for treatment of Alzheimer\u2019s disease [49]. Symptoms of meningoencephalitis that were observed in some trial patients were not predicted by nonclinical safety studies and the cause of the unwanted immune responses was difficult to establish. Based on some retrospective nonclinical studies using transgenic mouse models of the \u00addisease, it was suggested the inclusion of the QS-21 adjuvant in the AN1792 \u00advaccine might have contributed to the adverse Th1 response, involving significant IFN-\u03b3, IL-4, and TNF-\u03b1 expression [50].",

Gene profiling was performed on peripheral blood from monkeys treated with several vaccines with known clinical adverse effects. A gene module data analysis approach was used to demonstrate that one of the gene modules could be used as a classifier to predict vaccine/adjuvant reactogenicity. The classifier gene set was then applied in subsequent monkey studies to predict reactogenicity associated with experimental vaccines.",

A postnatal follow-up of the pups from birth to weaning is also included to assess normal growth, nursing activity, body weights, and viability which are established as reliable indicators of normal development. Design of vaccine DART studies has been reviewed by Wolf et al. [39] In brief, female animals are immunized a few weeks before mating in order to ensure peak immune responses during the critical phases of pregnancy (e.g., organogenesis). Vaccine booster doses are then administered during gestation (embryo-fetal period) and lactation (postnatal period) to evaluate potential direct embryotoxic effects of the components of the vaccine formulation and to maintain an immune response throughout the remainder of gestation. If an adjuvant is included in the vaccine, an adjuvant-alone control group could also be included, similar to the approaches to general repeat-dose toxicity studies discussed above.",

It was reported that participants generally agreed that the primary objectives and design of current DART studies performed according to the existing guidelines are appropriate and no specific changes were recommended. Furthermore, it was confirmed that no specific immunotoxicological endpoints are necessary since the evaluation of antibody response to the vaccine antigen(s) in DART studies is adequate to assess an effect of the vaccine on the immune system in the treated mother and indirectly on the developing immune system of the offspring. Additional immune parameters should only be evaluated on a case-by-case basis where there is an increased concern for potential immunotoxicity. Also, if DART studies would reveal vaccine-induced adverse effects on either the pregnant/lactating animal, the embryo/fetal development or development of the offspring, further nonclinical studies to evaluate the cause of the effect should be conducted. Follow-up studies would include broader immunological evaluations, e.g. histochemical analysis for antibody depositions, evaluation of lymphoid organ weights, histology and hematology of the F1 generation.",

While this type of test remains appropriate for some neurotropic virus strains (e.g., polio and yellow fever), at a workshop in 2005 jointly organized by the International Association for Biologicals (IABs), the EP and the WHO, it was recommended that MNV testing no longer be required for established strains with proven safety records such as measles, mumps, rubella, and varicella [73]. In fact, the EP monographs for measles [74], mumps [75], rubella [76], and varicella [77] now require that only new strains of these viruses be evaluated for neurovirulence and that the test, in an appropriate animal model, be conducted during preclinical development only. In addition, FDA has removed the requirement for neurovirulence testing from the CFR [73]. In some cases, neurovirulence testing is required, for example, if inadequate data on neurovirulence of a virus for which a novel vaccine is being developed, if neurotropism or neurovirulence is apparent, or if a novel vaccine has been attenuated by passage in neuronal tissue. However, novel models for neurovirulence testing that do not involve the use of NHPs are being pursued. For example, Rubin et al. have developed a neonatal rat model which has shown better predictive value than the MNVT in distinguishing between neurovirulent and attenuated strains of mumps virus [78]. Other test systems such as marmosets have also been evaluated and show some promise. Nonanimal-based testing methods have also been considered but full replacement of animal testing may not be feasible as the complexity of neurovirulent viruses may not be adequately reflected [79].",

With the continuous progress in technology, especially molecular and genetic methodologies applied both in discovery of vaccines and formulation sciences, the development of well-defined specific antigens for use in vaccines enables production of next generation novel vaccines to prevent and/or treat diseases which have been refractory to vaccination in the past. Scientific and technological advances have led to improved vaccine products aiming at elimination of potentially virulent or carcinogenic components and reduction of impurities. However, vaccines containing \u201cpurer\u201d antigens are often not very immunogenic and therefore require addition of more effective adjuvants and other excipients. Paradoxically, while the next generation vaccines are more defined and better characterized than the traditional vaccines, they are viewed as \u201cless natural.\u201d Also, advances in molecular engineering leading to the use of novel adjuvants and other components as well as novel delivery systems are not always paralleled by a full understanding of biological mechanisms of action of these components. A limited understanding of mechanism of action of newly available vaccine adjuvants leads to increased concerns about their safety [3]. Nevertheless, many recent scientific and regulatory discussions dedicated to this topic seem to indicate that currently recommended and applied approaches to nonclinical development, including toxicology studies, of vaccine candidates are appropriate and adequate [54]. The principles for the nonclinical safety assessment reviewed in this chapter should provide a foundation for the evaluation of next generation vaccines.",
