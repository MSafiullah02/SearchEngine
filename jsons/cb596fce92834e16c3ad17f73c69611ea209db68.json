Although sites and mechanisms of action and the pathologies caused by different chemical insults vary, common biochemical signaling pathways, molecular mediators, and cellular processes provide targets for MTMC drugs. This article will review the MTMC hypothesis for blister and nerve agents and will expand the scope of the concept to include other chemicals as well as briefly consider biological agents. The article will also consider how common biochemical signaling pathways, molecular mediators, and cellular processes that contribute to clinical pathologies and syndromes may relate to the toxicity of threat agents. Discovery of MTMC provides the opportunity for the integration of diverse researchers and clinicians, and for the exploitation of cutting-edge technologies and drug discovery. The broad-spectrum nature of MTMC can augment military and civil defense to combat chemical warfare and chemical terrorism.",

Terrorist threat agents include all classes of chemical warfare agents, toxins, and a broader menu of toxic industrial chemicals. The large number of threats and potential for use of multiple toxic substances in combination can complicate agent identification and medical response. A terrorist assault might more closely resemble the chemical accident at Bhopal, India, than a chemical warfare attack. Symptoms may be closer to smoke inhalation and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) than to the cholinergic crisis caused by nerve agent poisoning. Research into medical countermeasures against weaponized battlefield chemical warfare agents has focused on distinct classes of nerve, blister, choking, or edemagenic agents and pathologies specific to these agents, e.g., nerve agent-induced seizure, phosgene-induced ARDS, and SM blistering. The present challenge of defending against the myriad of threat chemicals and toxins necessitates a more collective and comprehensive strategy that more generally addresses the symptoms and pathology of chemical toxicity rather than a specific chemical mechanism.",

These common pathways are key in initiating the cellular processes that contribute to clinical pathologies caused by chemical exposures. Clinically defined syndromes or symptoms that represent pathologies of respiratory, neuronal, cardiac, cutaneous, or other systems to include anaphylactic shock, bronchospasm, ARDS, seizure, excitotoxin-like neuronal degeneration, and blistering are observed after exposure to chemical warfare agents, hazardous chemicals, toxins, and even infectious agents. The MTMC hypothesis suggests that common biochemical pathways contribute to the toxicity that causes the pathologies associated with different classes of toxic chemicals. MTMC drugs that target these key pathways might create a physiological \"quiescent\" state that protects against various chemical insults. 14 ",

[14] [15] [16] . Although evidence for a significant role for inflammation in chemical toxicity continues to accumulate, inflammatory response is still often regarded as merely collateral to chemical insult and secondary to toxicity. [14] [15] [16] The evolution over the last decade of the concept that inflammatory response is a key element of chemical toxicity that allows for the development of anti-inflammatory drugs as multi-agent countermeasures is unique to the MTMC hypothesis. [14] [15] [16] The MTMC hypothesis encompasses the interaction of multiple toxic agents and diverse countermeasure drugs on mediators and signaling pathways that cause or sustain inflammation. Whether inflamma-tion is a collateral biomarker or causative contributor to chemical toxicity is controversial. However, in either case inflammation can provide a common denominator to facilitate deciphering the relationships between agents, drugs, signaling pathways, and cellular processes pertinent to predicting candidate MTMC drugs. 14 A major tenet of the pharmacology of anti-inflammatory drugs is that drug action can result from the specific inhibition of molecular mediators of inflammation or from modulation of the underlying biochemistry that initiates or sustains an inflammatory response. Different inflammatory mediators, pathways, and cell populations can be induced or recruited by different conditions or insults. This multifaceted nature of inflammation may require the use of numerous pharmacologically distinct antiinflammatory drugs to contend with the different manifestations of inflammatory pathology. However, enough uniformity of biochemical pathways of inflammation exists to allow for development of broad-spectrum anti-inflammatory drugs.",

[15] [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] Experimental evidence has accumulated over the last decade demonstrating SM-increased proteases and the expression of inflammatory enzymes, gene products, mediators, and receptors in tissue or cell cultures. 14, 15, [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] Inflammatory enzymes and cytokines have also been reported in the skin of SM-exposed animals. 24, 25 Cholinergic crisis is the paramount toxicological event in nerve agent intoxication, causing acute toxicity and precipitating seizure and neuronal degeneration. 26 However, along with cholinergic crisis anaphylactoid reactions, pathological proteolytic activity and inflammatory cytokines have also been reported in nerve agent-intoxicated animals. 14,27-31 The initial observations of anaphylactoid reactions associated with soman poisoning reported by Doebler et al. 28 and Newball et al. 29 nearly a quarter century ago have recently again been considered by Gilat et al. 30 in sarin-intoxicated animals. Anaphylactoid reactions, by definition, occur upon initial exposure to a chemical independent of antibody production. Anaphylactoid reactions and nerve agent intoxication can generate acute symptoms such as convulsions, bronchoconstriction, respiratory failure, circulatory collapse, and death within a few minutes. 14,16 Thus, anaphylactoid reactions, 14, 16 like the more extensively investigated cholinergic crisis and excitotoxin-like neuronal degeneration, are a clinically well-defined and potentially lethal syndrome associated with nerve agent intoxication.",

The pattern of injury was similar to that caused by epilepsy and isch- Acute lung/organ dysfunction emic brain injury. Some animals also had cardiac lesions characterized by acute necrosis with subsequent mild inflammation and fibrosis. Inflammatory cytokines such as TNF, IL-1, and IL-8 are associated with recruitment of inflammatory cells and cellular processes such as degranulation, apoptosis, and necrosis. Inflammatory cytokines are causative factors in phosgeneassociated ARDS, they contribute to SM injury, and they are implicated in nerve agent seizure and neuronal degeneration. 14, 17, 18, 24, 25, 31, 32 Skin from mice SM exposure sites and the brains of soman-intoxicated rats demonstrate increased IL-1\u2424 mRNA. 22,23,31 IL-1 is an inflammatory cytokine that can precipitate other cytokines such as TNF, IL-6, and IL-8, and such a cytokine cascade is implicated in SM toxicity. 22 Svensson et al. 31 have demonstrated that soman induces the inflammatory cytokine IL-1\u2424 in rat brain, and this activity is highly correlated with convulsions. Williams et al. 33 confirmed IL-1\u2424, and further observed an acute and transient upregulation of other inflammatory gene response, i.e., TNF, IL-6, E-selectin, and intercellular adhesion molecule-1 caused by exposure to soman. The authors suggest that these molecules may be involved in soman-induced brain injury. Eriksson et al. 34 demonstrated that NMDA antagonists could suppress excitotoxin-induced IL-1\u2424 mRNA in the rat brain. Furthermore, Vezzani et al. 35 have protected mice against NMDA receptor-dependent seizures with soluble IL-1 receptors that specifically antagonize IL-1 activity. The authors suggest that the interaction between IL-1 and IL-1 receptors represents a crucial mechanism of seizure and a target for development of anticonvulsant drugs. The role of inflammatory cytokines in edemagenic, nerve, and blister agent toxicity supports cytokine antagonists as candidate MTMC.",

Furthermore, antivesicant drugs with anti-inflammatory pharmacology generally demonstrate inhibition of HD-increased IL-8 in human epidermal keratinocyte (HEK) cultures (Ref. 41; FM Cowan, CA Broomfield, and WJ Smith, unpublished observations). Collectively, the MEVM and in vitro SM-increased IL-8 HEK assays effectively screen, not just for vesicant countermeasures, but also for anti-inflammatory drugs that inhibit IL-8. These models further identified drugs such as capsaicin analogs as better antivesicants and anticytokine drugs than major classes of currently available corticosteroids and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs.",

Hypersensitivity to inhalation of the cholinergic compounds such as methylcholine or the autacoid histamine is a diagnostic test for asthma, and anticholinergics are sometimes used as supplementary treatment. 45 Inflammatory, neurological, and tissue pathology pathways involve proteolytic processes. 14 Synthesized mediators such as PAF and serine proteases such as tryptase and tissue plasminogen activator (t-PA) in addition to autacoids such as histamine are significant factors in inflammatory and anaphylactic responses. 14, 16, 46 Carbamates can inhibit serine proteases that mediate anaphylaxis and prevent anaphylactic response. 47 The benzodiazepine diazepam is Food and Drug Administration approved for the treatment of seizures associated with nerve agent poisoning. 48 Benzodiazepines can, in addition to acting as \u2425-aminobutyric acid receptor agonists, also inhibit PAF receptors. 49 PAF is a dual proinflammatory and neuromessenger phospholipid molecule that participates in pathological phenomena that include protease synthesis, lethal anaphylaxis, vesication and NMDA glutamate receptor excitotoxicity, seizure, and neuronal degeneration (for review, see Ref. 14) . Mice are protected from lethal anaphylaxis by serine protease inhibitors or PAF antagonists. 46, 49 The \u2425-aminobutyric acid receptor agonist and PAF receptor antagonist actions of benzodiazepines might synergistically protect against nerve agent cholinergic and inflammatory toxicities. Furthermore, proteolytic and inflammatory pathways are also strongly implicated in NMDA receptor-mediated seizure and neuronal degeneration. Knockout mice deficient in the protease t-PA were resistant to seizure and neuronal pathology caused by excitotoxins (for review, see Ref. 50) . Furthermore, the synthetic protease inhibitor tPA-STOP (American Diagnostica, Greenwich, CT) suppressed excitotoxin-induced seizure and neuronal degeneration (for review, see Ref. 50 ).",

Van Helden et al. 54 used the adenosine A1 receptor agonist N6-cyclopentyl adenosine as a countermeasure to soman poisoning. Without any supportive treatment with atropine, oxime, or diazepam, N6-cyclopentyl adenosine protected rats from convulsive activity and respiratory distress and improved 24-hour survival. 54 Reduced ACh levels in rat brains were reported in this study, and the protection was attributed to cholinergic mechanisms wherein the adenosine A1 receptor agonists binding to the A1 adenosine receptor caused inhibition of ACh release. 54 However, the cholinesterase-inhibiting nerve agents sarin, tabun, and soman can interact directly with brain A1 adenosine receptors and may competitively alter the action of these agents at adenosine receptor sites. 14, 55 Adenosine receptors can moderate the activation of other receptors that influence neurotransmitter release and/or synaptic transmission, e.g., ACh and NMDA receptors. 54,56 A2, A3, and A1 adenosine receptor agonists can further influence mast cell degranulation, and adenosine-directed treatment modalities have been suggested for asthma. 57 Neutrophil infiltration of dermal inflammatory sites, similar to that also observed in SM pathogenesis, was inhibited by administration of adenosine A1 receptor agonists. 14, 58 This anti-inflammatory action of adenosine agonists was reversed by an NMDA agonist and was mimicked by a glutamate NMDA receptor antagonist. 58 Hence, in this model, central NMDA receptor activity can control peripheral neutrophil accumulation, and adenosine A1 receptor agonists can influence this NMDA receptor excitation-mediated inflam-mation. 58 Virag and Szabo 59 have further demonstrated that adenosine can inhibit the activation of PARP, and they propose that this may affect cell death and inflammation. Thus, adenosine agonists can influence multiple inflammatory biochemical pathways associated with nerve and blister agent toxicity and are candidate MTMC (Table III) .",

            "text": "The activation of inflammatory responses that contribute to pathology is not restricted to chemical agents. T-2 toxin, as a major trichothecene mycotoxin, has some radiomimetic properties, and the results of its action, like the blistering induced by SM, can be alleviated by treatment with glucocorticoid hormones. 60, 61 Moreover, PAF seems to have an important role in the pathophysiology of T-2 toxicosis because its selective antagonist BN 520121 can prolong survival of rats exposed to lethal doses of this toxin. 62 Trichothecene mycotoxin also induce mesenteric 63 and subcutaneous mast cell degranulation 64 and increased secretion of interleukins IL-1\u2424 and IL-6 in vitro. This suggests that superinduction of cytokines might be one of the mechanisms of T-2 toxin-induced tissue damage. 65 The inflammagenic properties of mycotoxin may further contribute to core pathologies such as ARDS. Likewise, inflammatory cytokines and the complication of ARDS are associated with the pathology of infectious agents such as anthrax, smallpox, Ebola, and, of course, the corona virus infection that causes severe acute respiratory syndrome. [66] [67] [68] The MTMC hypothesis suggests that inflammation is not just a biomarker, but is also a major cause of toxicity for many chemical warfare agents and toxic chemicals. As a counterpoint to the anti-inflammatory MTMC drugs, substances that increase inflammation can synergistically augment chemical toxicity. Roth and coworkers (for review, see Ref. 69 ) demonstrated that a small dose of the inflammagenic endotoxin lipopolysaccharide (LPS), which is without effect by itself, markedly enhances the hepatotoxic effects of aflatoxin B 1 . A similar effect of LPS endotoxin occurs with other toxic chemicals and other target organs (for review, see Ref. 69 ). Stone et al. 70 have reported that LPS or the inflammatory cytokines TNF or IL-1 enhanced the cytotoxic effects of the SM stimulant 2-chloroethyl ethyl sulfide. Whether the results of coexposure to an inflammagen such as LPS or an intrinsic property of a toxic agent, the inflammatory response can augment sensitivity to chemical toxicities. Thus, inflammation associated with chemical toxicity is a target for anti-inflammatory MTMC.",

Many biological toxins and infectious agents cause inflammatory responses that contribute to pathology. Finally, because MTMC addresses clinically recognized pathologies such as ARDS, collateral improvements in general health care and emergency medicine are possible. Once one looks past the diverse chemistry, sites of action, and symptoms, common biochemical pathways may exist for many chemical threat agents. Even when threats extend to mixtures of agents and toxic industrial chemicals, or new threat agents evolve, such biochemical signaling pathways may remain more constant and amenable to medical intervention. Defining and interdicting these pathways provide strategies for developing civil defense and military preparedness against chemical threats. Of perhaps equal significance, the MTMC hypothesis provides an incentive for dialogue and cross-fertilization between diverse chemical defense, academic, clinical, and drug discovery research interests to combat chemical warfare and chemical terrorism. Using MTMC to blunt pathological actions of chemical agents is an attractive possibility.",
