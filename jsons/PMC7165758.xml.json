However, in a study of antiviral treatment in runners, not all episodes of URS were associated with EBV expression,\n49\n and the frequency of EBV expression differs substantially between sports. Although an anti\u2010herpes virus treatment was effective in reducing EBV expression in the long\u2010distance runners it did not reduce the frequency of episodes of URS, indicating other causes for the URS. In studies of swimmers\n48\n and footballers\n50\n expression of EBV DNA in saliva was associated with a prior reduction in salivary IgA levels and increased detection of URS. Saliva samples from swimmers were also examined for expression of other herpes group viruses but did not exhibit viral DNA for Cytomegalovirus or HSV1 or HSV2.\n48\n IgA has a major role in controlling viral reactivation and low levels before the appearance of EBV viral DNA indicates that salivary IgA could be used as a surrogate marker for increased risk of viral reactivation. Considering EBV viral reactivation as a cause of URS is important as it can be controlled either therapeutically or by altering training loads to prevent IgA suppression and reactivation.",

Athletes suffering recurrent URS warrant a thorough clinical assessment and investigations of potentially treatable conditions.

Antibiotic preparations are effective although side effects can include fatigue, photosensitivity, cardiac disturbance, diarrhoea and increased risk of tendinopathy. Choice of narrow\u2010spectrum antibiotics and avoiding extended courses around competitions is advised. In runners, topical respiratory anti\u2010inflammatory medications may assist with reducing the severity of symptoms.\n37\n, \n38\n Anti\u2010viral intervention may reduce the viral load of EBV but may not have an impact on the incidence of URS.\n49\n Expectorants to clear mucus production are usually well tolerated although exercise itself can have this effect.

Inflammation from non\u2010infective causes is common among athletes and many will have underlying treatable conditions. In research settings, differentiation between the inflammatory causes of the URS is often not feasible. Antioxidant, probiotic and bovine colostrum supplementations may be beneficial for some athletes.
