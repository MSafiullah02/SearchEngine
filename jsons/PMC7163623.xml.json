The Netherlands experienced the largest Q fever outbreak ever reported between 2007 and 2011. It is estimated that at least 32 200 individuals were infected, and around 4000 patients notified having a symptomatic acute Q fever infection 3. During an acute Q fever infection, the C. burnetii bacterium resides inside the phagolysosomes of monocytes and macrophages 1, 2. In order to survive and replicate in the phagolysosome, or Coxiella containing vacuole, of these cells, C. burnetii is known to alter and subvert various host cell processes 4, 5.",

It was shown that monocytes and likely also myeloid progenitor cells are able to acquire long\u2010lasting immunologic memory (also termed \u201ctrained immunity\u201d) through epigenetic remodeling at the promoter regions of various cytokines 11, 12. Depending on their initial challenge, these cells show altered (decreased or increased) responses to secondary challenges such as infections 13, 14. Given these findings, it could be hypothesized that QFS patients who experience more frequent and severe upper respiratory tract infections since their acute Q fever infection, exhibit epigenetic remodeling of chromatin at the level of immune genes involved in host defense against viral upper respiratory tract infections. This remodeling could then result in altered cytokine responses to such infections. We test this hypothesis by conducting in vitro stimulation experiments on monocyte responsiveness of QFS patients with frequently recurring and severe upper respiratory tracts infections, together with an investigation of epigenetic changes at various cytokine promoter regions of these monocytes.",

            "text": "The most common pathogens to induce upper respiratory tract infections are Rhinoviruses, Coronaviruses, and Influenza viruses 15. Most research on the role of antiviral cytokine and chemokine responses was done on Influenza. When looking at disease severity, human studies show consensus and indicate toward an association with increased cytokine and chemokine responses 16, 17. Studies on disease susceptibility are however scarce, mainly consist of mouse models, and show conflicting results. Both positive and negative associations are found when looking at disease severity, morbidity, and mortality in mice deficient for IL\u20106 18 and IL\u20101 19, 20, MCP\u20101 21, and IP\u201010 21 receptors. Nonetheless, it is conceivable that the decreased cytokine responses in our cohort of QFS patients contribute to an increased susceptibility to viral upper respiratory tract infections. Previous studies on cytokine responses in QFS found that white blood cells of QFS patients produce higher amounts of IL\u20106 and IFN\u2010\u03b3 when exposed to Coxiella antigen 8, 9. One could therefore argue that immune regulation in QFS is ligand dependent, which makes it challenging to decipher its exact underlying immunopathologic mechanisms. It should be noted that this study solely included QFS patients who experience more frequent and severe upper respiratory tract infections since their acute Q fever while the above mentioned studies made no such distinction.",

The concept of trained immunity is based on metabolic and epigenetic remodeling of monocytes, macrophages, and their progenitor cells, following insults such as infection, vaccination, or inflammatory diseases (e.g. atherosclerosis) 10, 11, 12, 13, 14. Epigenetic remodeling on promoter regions of pro\u2010inflammatory cytokines, e.g. TNF\u2010\u03b1 and IL\u20106, can result in transcriptionally active chromatin, often accompanied by higher expression of open chromatin marks such as H3K4me3 11, 22. Such remodeling can result in an increased inflammatory response upon a second, nonspecific, infectious stimulus. As a counterbalance of trained immunity, certain incentives are known to inflict long lasting decreased inflammatory responses, i.e. tolerance 22, 23, 24, 25. Such a process, inflicted by a strong initial incentive, e.g. acute Q fever infection, could perhaps explain the altered cytokine responses in these QFS patients and arises from similar metabolic and epigenetic remodeling.",

Given the differing results in monocyte responsiveness when using various ligands, such remodeling is likely to be complex and vary per cytokine and chemokine promoter region.

This could in part explain the decreased mRNA expression and cytokine production in these QFS patients compared to their age\u2010 and sex\u2010matched healthy controls. However, it should be noted that this is an investigation of a very specific part and alteration on these promoter regions. Many more modifications are known to occur at these regions, which could all influence activation, inhibition, but also each other 23, 26. Perhaps these results could best serve as an indication that the immunologic alterations seen in QFS could in part be explained by epigenetic remodeling in myeloid cells. This epigenetic remodeling could very well be induced by acute infection with C. burnetii, and result in long\u2010lasting changes in monocytes, macrophages, and their progenitor cells.
