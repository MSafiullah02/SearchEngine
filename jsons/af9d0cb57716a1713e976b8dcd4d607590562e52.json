In particular, this work advocates for a third-party-free approach to assisted mobile contact tracing, because such an approach mitigates the security and privacy risks of requiring a trusted third party.

Harnessing mobile computing technologies is an obvious means to dramatically scale-up conventional epidemic response strategies to do tracking at population scale. However, straightforward and well-intentioned contact-tracing applications can invade personal privacy and provide governments with justification for data collection and mass surveillance that are inconsistent with the civil liberties that citizens will and should expect-and demand. To be effective, acceptable, and consistent with the need to observe commitments to privacy, we must leverage designs and computing advances in privacy and security. In cases where it is valuable for individuals to share data with others, systems must provide voluntary mechanisms in accordance with ethical principles of personal decision making, including disclosure, and consent. We refer to efforts to identify, study, and field such privacy-sensitive technologies, architectures, and protocols in support of mobile tracing as PACT (P rivacy sensitive protocols And mechanisms for mobile C ontact T racing).",

Proximity-based sensing can be done in a privacy-sensitive manner. With the approach, no absolute location information is collected nor shared. Variants of proximity-based analyses have been employed in the past for privacy-sensitive analyses in healthcare [23] . Taking advantage of proximity-based signals can speed the process of contact discovery and enable contact tracing of otherwise undiscoverable people like the fellow commuter on the train. This can also be done with a third-party-free approach providing similar privacy tradeoffs as manual contact tracing. This functionality can enable someone who has become ill with symptoms consistent with COVID-19, or who has received confirmation of infection with a positive test for COVID-19, to voluntarily and under a pseudonym, share information that may be relevant to the wellness of others. In particular, a system can manage, in a privacy-sensitive manner, data about individuals who came in close proximity to them over a period of time (e.g., the last two weeks), even if there is no personal connection between these individuals. Individuals who share information do so with disclosure and consent around potential risks of private information being shared.

First, a user generates a random seed, which they treat as private information. Then all users broadcast random-looking signals to users in their proximity via Bluetooth and, concurrently, all users also record all the signals they hear being broadcast by other users in their proximity. Each person's broadcasts (their \"pseudonyms\") are a function of their private seed, and they change these broadcasted pseudonyms periodically (e.g. every minute). Whenever a user tests positive, the positive user then can voluntarily publish, on a public server, information which enables the reconstruction of all the signals they have broadcasted to others during the infection window (precisely, they publish their private seed, and, using the seed, any other user can figure out what pseudonyms the positive user has previously broadcasted). Now, any other user can determine whether they are at risk by checking whether the signals they heard are published on the server. Note that the \"public lists\" can be either lists from hospitals, which have confirmed seeds from positive users, or they can be self-reports (see Section 2.3). Credit: M Eifler.",

This could potentially be done with stronger cryptographic methods to limit the exposure of information about these traces to negative users; one could think of this as a more general version of private-set intersection (PSI) [1, 8, 15] .

Another proposal is the DP 3 T [20] protocol, in which G is constructed from a hash function, a PRF, and another PRG.

In our protocol and CEN, information about the exposure time is not intended to be as hidden at the protocol. In our protocol the time an ID was used is even included as part of a report and used to prevent replay attacks, as discussed earlier.

With regards to anonymity, if the protocol is implemented over the internet, then GeoIP lookups can be used to localize the query-maker to a varying extent. People who really care about this could potentially query through an anonymization service.2. The narrowcast messages in particular may be best expressed through existing software map technology. For example, we could imagine a map querying the server on behalf of users and displaying public health messages on the map.3. The bandwidth and compute usage of a phone querying the full database may be to high. To avoid this, it's reasonably easy to augment the protocol to allow users to query within a (still large) region.We mention one such approach below.4. Disjoint authorities. Across the world, there may be many testing authorities which do not agree on a common infrastructure but which do wan to use the protocol. This can be accommodated by enabling the phone app to connect to multiple servers.5. The mobile proximity tracing does not directly inform public authorities who may be a contact. However, it does provide some bulk information, simply due to the number of posted messages.There are several ways to implement the server. A simple approach, which works fine for not-to-many messages just uses a public GitHub repository.A more complex approach supporting regional queries is defined next.",

More specific subscriptions can be constructed on the fly based on policies that consider a region R and privately observed periods of time that an individual has spent in a region. Such scoped queries and messaging services that relay content based on location or on location and periods of time are a convenience to make computation and communication tractable. The reference implementation uses regions greater in size than typical GeoIP tables.To be specific, let's first define some concepts.\u2022 Region: A region consists of a latitude prefix, a longitude prefix, and the precision in each. For example, New York which is at 40.71455 N, -74.00712 E can be coarsened to 40 N, -74 E with two digits of precision (the actual implementation would use bits).\u2022 Time: A timestamp is specified in the number of seconds (as a 64 bit integer) since the January 1, 1970.\u2022 Location: A location consists of a full precision Latitude and Longitude\u2022 Area: An area consists of a Location, a Radius, a beginning Time, and an ending Time.",
