This is probably due to\na combination of two factors.5 First, Hong Kong was the epicentre of the 2003 SARS\noutbreak, and the local population learned painful lessons from that time very well.\nFrom the first news of the situation in Wuhan in January 2020, the vast majority of\nHong Kong people spontaneously began rigorous mask-wearing, personal hygiene, and\nsocial distancing. Second, the official response by the healthcare system was also\nrelatively quick. On January 8, before a single case had even been confirmed in Hong\nKong, the new \u201csevere respiratory disease associated with a novel infectious agent\u201d\nwas listed as a notifiable disease, and all visiting at public hospitals was\nrestricted. By January 25, when there were only 5 confirmed cases in Hong Kong, the\nHospital Authority activated its emergency response level, suspending all visiting\nat public hospitals and requesting all public hospitals to review their nonemergency\nservices.6 The latter effectively meant that the majority of elective\nsurgery operations were suspended to allow resources to be focused on the COVID-19\nresponse. The private healthcare sector in Hong Kong is relatively large and robust,\nand private hospitals quickly followed suit by applying very strict policies\nregulating both patients and staff to ensure that any person with suspected COVID-19\ncould not enter. The net result of these parallel approaches was that care for\nsuspected cases of COVID-19 was concentrated in public hospitals, whereas private\nhospitals could continue a degree of normal service, including elective surgery.",

            "text": "Cardiothoracic surgery services in Hong Kong during the COVID-19 outbreak have been\naffected to a lesser degree than other surgical specialities. It was recognized that\npatients on the waiting lists for cardiac and thoracic malignancy operations may\nhave conditions that require prompt surgery, and hence these cases have been\nprioritized. Although the elective cardiothoracic operating lists in the public\nhospitals were initially reduced to some degree, normal or near-normal service was\nsoon resumed. Again, the lessons learned from the 2003 SARS outbreak enabled\nhospitals to quickly adapt measures protecting operating room staff and allowing\nsurgery to proceed.7,8\nAt the time of writing, because the viral outbreak has thus far been reasonably\ncontrolled, the ward and intensive care unit bed situation in Hong Kong has not been\nexcessively strained and has not compromised cardiothoracic surgical services. The\nparallel approach taken by the private hospitals to ensure a virus-free environment\nalso ensured that they were in a good position to not only maintain near-normal\nvolumes of private thoracic operations, but also to take up any shortfall in the\npublic service. In particular, patients concerned about being managed in\ncomparatively busy public hospitals that also treated COVID-19 cases had the option\nof private surgery instead. Overall, the only noticeable effect on cardiac and\nthoracic surgical services has perhaps been a drop in the number of operations for\nnon-neoplastic thoracic conditions. At the time of writing, the only uncertainty in\nthe near future is whether a recent uptick in the number of COVID-19 cases due to\nHong Kong citizens returning from abroad and a mini-outbreak from those going to\nbars and clubs may evolve into a full-blown second or third wave of\ninfections.9 If this occurs and causes a surge in admissions, the provision\nof cardiothoracic surgery services may yet come under review.",

It was a tentative summary of issues based on current evidence and\nguidelines from overseas academic societies, which surgeons should be aware of. This\nstatement analyzed the current and future status of COVID-19 infection and described\nhow to continue to provide surgical treatment to patients. In the statement, it was\nemphasized that ensuring the safety of both patients and medical staff was most\nimportant in continuing medical activities. It was also suggested that patient\ntriage before surgery may be indispensable when medical resources were limited. In\nthoracic surgery, operations for malignant tumors and lung transplantation were\nlisted as high-priority and should be performed even if resources were limited. On\nthe other hand, surgery for low-grade malignant tumors such as stage IA\nadenocarcinoma with ground-glass opacities was given a lower priority. Prior to any\nsurgery, a polymerase chain reaction test on the patient\u2019s nasopharyngeal swab was\nrecommended. Chest computed tomography, as a sensitive means for detecting lung\ninfiltration, was also recommended just before surgery.",

Patients suspected of having COVID-19 are\nreceived at designated clinics in each administrative district. Those confirmed to\nhave the disease are centralized to the Shanghai Public Health Clinical Center, a\nhospital specializing in infectious diseases established during the SARS outbreak.\nThis has been very successful in that the total number of confirmed COVID-19\ninfection has been curtailed to a little over 300, most of them coming from other\nplaces in China or from other countries. With merely 3 deaths so far, it has been a\nremarkable achievement for a metropolitan city of over 20 million population.\nHowever, patients with other diseases may have had their treatment delayed due to\nlimited access to routine healthcare during this pandemic. The latter has been\nlargely slowed down, either because of resources deviated to deal with the epidemic\n(there have been over 1000 doctors and nurses sending to Wuhan from Shanghai), or\ncaution on the side of the hospital for protection of healthcare staff as well as\nunaffected patients. Elective surgery was suspended in most general hospitals when\nthe situation in China was critical in late January and early February.

Thoracic and cardiovascular surgery services were gradually\nreturning to near to normal by March. At the Shanghai Chest Hospital, a tertiary\nreferral center specializing in chest diseases, emergency surgery was not stopped,\nand selective surgery for lung cancer, esophageal cancer, and mediastinal tumors\nresumed in early February, right after the Chinese New Year holidays. This was\nundertaken very carefully, screening candidates using both clinical history and\ncomputed tomography. Only those without history of traveling to severely affected\nareas or contact with a person suspected of coronavirus infection and no sign of\npulmonary infection, would be admitted. Surgery was postponed for patients with\nground-glass opacity lesions smaller than 1.5 cm, mostly pure ground-glass opacity\nwith a mean computed tomography value less than 500 Hu, and those showing no\nenlargement or consolidation during follow-up. They were treated similarly to\npatients with benign diseases in whom postponed elective surgery would do no harm\nbut may help avoid an unnecessary risk of exposure to coronavirus. In the more than\n700 cases operated on in the past two months, the majority recovered uneventfully\nwith only a few morbidities (none related to coronavirus). With the COVID-19\noutbreak now a pandemic around the world, almost every surgeon is facing similar\nproblems to some extent. It is now known that the situation may go on much longer\nthan expected.

The response included border control,\ncase identification, and containment. The travel history of all citizens could be\nassessed by all hospitals, clinics, and pharmacies to identify individuals at high\nrisk through contact. The policy also included resource allocation with control of\nall surgical masks, N95 masks, and negative-pressure control rooms by the Taiwan\nCenter for Disease Control, to ensure their availability for disease prevention and\ntreatment.12 As of April 2020, there were around 400 confirmed cases\n(including 6 mortalities) in Taiwan. COVID-19 infection was detected among the\nmedical personnel in one medical center, which led to a policy of restriction for\nall visitors to hospitals in Taiwan. The government has encouraged people to delay\ntheir visits to hospital for \u201cminor disease\u201d. However, there are no clear criteria\non disease categories. Although, there is a decrease in patient numbers in all\nsurgical departments, medical and surgical practice in Taiwan remains unchanged for\nall patients without risk of COVID-19 infection. This situation may be changed or\nfurther modified as the situation evolves at the time of writing. As an example of\nthe potential fluidity of the situation, a second wave of new cases due to overseas\ncitizens returning to Taiwan was observed in March, although there was subsequently\na continuous decrease in reported new cases.",

The spread first started amongst people who had contact with\nforeigners. However, Thailand currently ranks sixth in the world among countries\nwith the strongest health security, second for \u201crapidly responding and mitigating\nthe spreading of the endemic\u201d, and has been coping well with the endemic since the\nbeginning. The total of number confirmed cases was under 100 in January and\nFebruary. In March, two outbreak clusters changed the game. One cluster was in the\nThai boxing stadium that contained 5000 people crowded into a closed space. Among\nthese people were tourists from around the world. The other cluster was at a party\nthat included a sick Chinese man. These two clusters, together with returning Thais\nfrom abroad, brought the total confirmed cases to just over 1000 in early April\n2020. The situation was getting worse so several acts were announced. Shutdown of\nseveral main cities, including Bangkok, and stay-at-home/social distancing campaigns\nhave been introduced. These actions have allowed the situation to be better\ncontrolled. Regarding the effect on the healthcare system, increasing numbers of\nconfirmed and critical cases raised nationwide awareness. Each hospital prepared for\nthe worst-case scenario and realized that most lacked adequate resources, especially\nprotective equipment such as medical masks and gowns. Shutdown of\nnonemergency/non-urgent services was instituted in most hospitals, including\nsurgical services. Siriraj Hospital, the largest hospital and one of the main\nhospitals treating critical COVID-19 patients, has postponed all elective cases\n(including even cancer operations) for months. The majority of the other hospitals\nmarkedly reduced their surgery volume but still operated on cancer patients.

Turkey\u2019s first SARS-CoV-2 case was diagnosed on March 11, 2020. On March 27,\ntough restrictions such as cancelling all international flights, banning citizens\nfrom intercity travel via public transport and airplanes, and closing picnic and\nrecreation sites on weekends were announced.14 From March 11, Istanbul became\nthe epicenter of the outbreak in Turkey, with more than 60% of Turkish cases. Many\nsecondary and all public and private tertiary care hospitals with expertise in\ninfectious disease, chest disease, anesthesiology, and specialist intensive care\nwere announced to be \u201chospitals of the pandemic\u201d. This meant that all confirmed\nand/or suspected cases can be admitted to those hospitals, and all patients can be\ntreated under the nationwide insurance system umbrella. The number of elective\nthoracic surgeries performed reduced during the last two weeks of March in most\nhospitals in Istanbul. At the time of writing, almost no elective thoracic surgical\noperations are being performed, including stage III lung cancer cases. Most thoracic\nsurgery units were re-purposed as wards for COVID-19 patients. In Istanbul, almost\nall thoracic surgery attending and consulting surgeons as well as thoracic surgery\nresidents were put on duty lists to care for COVID-19 patients. Only a small number\nof wards could be dedicated to noninfected cases. This reorganization of thoracic\nsurgery units did not happen in other cities in Turkey, in which only small numbers\nof patients were diagnosed to have COVID-19. Many thoracic surgery units outside\nIstanbul have reportedly continued to perform elective surgeries.15 However, the\nnumber of thoracic surgeries performed were claimed to be reduced to some extent due\nto public restrictions that were in effect in the whole nation. As the reported\nnumber of new cases and mortalities in Turkey continued to increase, although at a\nslower rate, as of April 6, it is unknown whether other thoracic surgery units in\nother cities would continue to perform elective surgeries with their patients\nadmitted to dedicated thoracic surgery wards.",

Although some regions have experienced\nsignificant reductions in the volume of thoracic surgery operations, others have\nmaintained near-normal service. The key determinants of whether thoracic surgery\nservices can be provided during the pandemic appear to be: prior experience with\nepidemics, resulting in pre-established response plans; prompt government action to\nboth reduce import of cases and limit local spread (i.e., flatten the curve);\nadequate resources to split between dedicated COVID-19 care and normal clinical\nservices; prioritization of important clinical disease (such as thoracic cancer);\nand volume of confirmed or suspected cases in a specific region. The lesson from the\nAsian experience appears to be that if prompt action is taken to control the viral\noutbreak in its early stages, it is still possible to maintain a degree of\nspecialist surgical service to the most in-need patients during the COVID-19\npandemic. When the world emerges from this current pandemic, it is necessary to draw\nfrom current experiences to establish robust response strategies in preparation for\nfuture outbreaks.",
