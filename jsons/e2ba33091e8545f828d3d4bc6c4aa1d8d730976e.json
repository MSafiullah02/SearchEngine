The most likely limited 197 resource will be that of operating room availability and anesthesia providers along with 198 nursing/support personnel as all surgeons within the system will be trying to work through the 199 large backlog of scheduled cases. The second potential resource restriction will be that of 200 limited PPE. If inadequate PPE exists, cases with short operative times and higher volumes are 201 likely to burn through more PPE than longer/complex cases, where fewer gowns/gloves/masks 202 would be used by default due to less changes throughout the day. In this scenario, the short 203 operative time surgeries may be less appropriate to push into the system during early ramp up 204 of elective surgery, even in healthy and likely outpatient surgical candidates. The third potential 205 resource limitation may come in the way of limited hospital space/capacity in terms of bed 206 availability or nursing capacity. If hospital beds remain the limited resource, longer/complex 207 cases in patients with higher comorbidity burden are less desirable, and the healthy patients 208 that can be done efficiently and safely sent home are more likely to be more suitable in this 209 scenario. Finally, the availability of testing screening for providers and patients may be a 210 resource limitation if it remains a limited resource, or perhaps just as likely, a potential variable 211 that allows for an accelerated return to increased clinical care if the resource is readily available. 212",

The COVID-19 response, however, has forced us to adopt this 333 strategy overnight and realize the areas that where improvements have been made as a result. 334 From a regulatory and policy perspective, the relaxation of unnecessary governmental 335 restrictions on interstate communication with our patients residing in states beyond our license 336 have enabled us to both provide services as well as, hopefully, be reimbursed for them. 337 Furthermore, previously, the relaxation on the requirement of HIPAA compliant telehealth 338 platforms have created more options to communicate with patients who previously may have 339 had unequal access and understanding of available technologies. 340 While virtual health care remains challenging for an arthroplasty practice to be fully 341 reliant on, due to the need for hands on examination for the diagnosis of many conditions 342 including imaging and tests, the COVID-19 response has further shown us that we can 343 potentially challenge our long-standing protocols and reliance on occasionally burdensome 344 care. There is no doubt that many of our treatment interventions and modalities that we typically 345 offer mandates in person contact (including some rehab care, injection therapy and surgery). 346 While many of these interventions are not currently offered due to the needed response, we 347 have been able to use this time to realize there exists some potential over-reliance on routine 348 protocols for burdensome visits, imaging and studies that may be able to be minimized and, as 349 a result, efficiencies may be added into routine care. Such efficiencies and value may be added 350 by eliminating unnecessary in-person visits that are expensive in both the time and money 351 required of both patients and families. The limited resource of physical clinic space in some 352 practices can be preserved for patients truly needing in-person visits, and potentially even 353 expanding capacity as a result. Additionally, there can be improved efficiencies realized by 354 virtual visits in having all of the information needed and verified in advance by medical 355 assistants, as well as eliminating the rooming and room cleaning time, etc. While patients still 356",
