It has an icosahedral symmetrical structure with a diameter of approximately 17 nm [1]. PCV2 is the causative agent of porcine circovirus-associated disease (PCVAD), which manifests as postweaning multisystemic wasting syndrome (PMWS), reproductive failure, porcine dermatitis and nephropathy syndrome (PDNS), congenital tremors (CT), porcine respiratory disease complex (PRDC), enteritis, and proliferative and necrotizing pneumonia (PNP), among other conditions [2]. Since its identification in the 1970s, PCV2 has become prevalent globally. PCV2 infection normally causes immunosuppression and reduced immunity by damaging the immune system, which leads to co-infections with other pathogens, such as Porcine Reproductive and Respiratory Syndrome Virus (PRRSV), CSFV and Porcine Pseudorabies Virus (PRV), usually resulting in worse conditions, making the requirements for prevention and control more serious [3]. PCV2 infection has caused huge economic losses in pig production in China and worldwide and is recognized as one of the most important pig diseases.",

Six ORFs (ORF1\u20136) encode proteins that have been identified from these overlapped and nested ORFs [4, 5]. The viral genome contains two major open reading frames: ORF1 and ORF2. ORF1 encodes two proteins associated with replication, designated as Rep and Rep\u2019 [6]. ORF2 encodes the capsid (Cap) protein. The Cap protein is the only structural protein of PCV2 virus that contains immunologically important epitopes associated with virus neutralization. Therefore, the ORF2 and Cap proteins are commonly used for PCV2 phylogeny, epidemiology, and genetic diversity analyses [3]. PCV2 may evade the immune response in the form of mutations because of the immune pressure due to vaccination and may affect the antigenicity and immunogenicity of the Cap protein. Huang found that after a single amino acid change in the PCV2 Cap protein, a strain cannot be neutralized by an antibody known to have neutralizing capacity [7]. PCV2 maintains evolutionary dynamics closer to single-stranded RNA viruses than double-stranded DNA viruses because the rate of nucleotide substitution for PCV2 has been estimated to be 1.2 \u00d7 10\u2212 3 sites per year, which is the highest recorded substitution rate for a single-stranded DNA virus [8].",

            "text": "Since the first isolation of the PCV2 virus in 1998, PCV2 strains have been classified into five genotypes (PCV2a, PCV2b, PCV2c, PCV2d and PCV2e) based on phylogenetic analyses of genomes and ORF2 sequences [9]. PCV2a is the first genotype to be identified, and PCV2a and PCV2b are distributed worldwide. PCV2a can now be further subdivided into five (2A-2E) and three (1A-1C) clusters [10, 11]. Since 2003, there has been an observable worldwide genotypic shift, with PCV2b replacing PCV2a and becoming the predominant genotype. The PCV2d genotype has recently become a popular genotype in the world and can be subdivided into two clusters (2d-1 and 2d-2) [11, 12]. PCV2c was detected only in Denmark in archived swine serum samples [13]. PCV2e is a new genotype that has been circulating in the USA since 2015, the ORF2 sequences of which have 12 or 15 additional nts (CTT/TCTTATATGTAA) compared to those of PCV2a-PCV2d. PCV2e was reported in China for the first time in 2017 [14, 15]. Intermediate and new genotypes have been proposed, with increasing numbers of sequences available in recent years. For example, the recombinant cluster that recombines between PCV2a and PCV2b strains can occur in the Cap protein-coding region through different patterns and yield different recombinants [16]. In 2018, results from a retrospective analysis showed that a new genotype, PCV2f, was tracked to samples collected in 1996 in China [17]. Up to now, there is no specific treatment available for PCV2 infection and PCVADs. Vaccination has proved to be the best choice to prevent PCV2 infection in the field. However, with its high evolution rate, the virus\u2019 predominant genotype is constantly changing. This leads to the appearance of new genotypes and increased difficulty for vaccine development, making the prevention and treatment of PCV2 more difficult. Thus, investigation of the antigens and capsid structure variations of the virus is critical to improve diagnosis, new vaccine design, and our understanding of the PCV2 pathogenesis of this disease.",

When compared with two vaccine strains, SH and LG (AY686763 and HM038034), all nucleotide homology levels of the Yunnan strains were 94.7\u201398% and 95.1\u201396.7%, respectively.\n",

Though PCV2 infection alone does not cause clinical disease, the resulting autoimmune inhibition still leads to co-infection; thus, the virus is responsible for multiple diseases. PCV2 infection has caused serious economic problems for the swine industry in China [19]. In this study, 279 samples collected from 2016 to 2019 were screened for PCV2 by PCR, with a positive rate of 60.93%. Moreover, the infection rate of PCV2 increased from 2016 to 2019.

In more recent times, PCV2d has become the new emerging major genotype circulating in China [16]. PCV2d can be further divided into two main groups: PCV2d-1 and PCV2d-2. In this study, we found that PCV2d-2 has replaced PCV2b and become the predominant PCV2 genotype [21]. Phylogenetic analysis showed that the co-infection of multiple PCV2 genotypes (2a, 2b, 2d) is common in Yunnan pig herds, and the PCV2d strain is the main epidemic genotype, accounting for 80% (12/15) of the isolates in Yunnan. The genetic diversity of PCV2 is continuously increasing, and the cycle of the three genotypes continues in the herd.

Lower nucleotide sequence identities and amino acid homology with vaccine strains will result in noneffective cross-protection and immune failure [23]. PCV2b isolates presented a high amino acid sequence identity of 97.4% with vaccine strain SH (HM038027), and PCV2a isolates presented an amino acid sequence identity of 93.1% with vaccine strain LG (M038034). In contrast, PCV2b isolates presented an amino acid sequence identity ranging from 89.7\u201392.7% with two vaccine strains.

The typical motif TNKISI is present in 86\u201391 sites in PCV2a. The motifs 190\u2013191/206/210 S/PNPRSV and A/TGIE are present in PCV2b. SNPLTV and TGID motifs are present in most PCV2d strains [24]. Additionally, the amino acid epitopes 50\u201381, 113\u2013134, 161\u2013208, and 227\u2013233 in the Cap protein of PCV2 have been previously identified [25]. Alanine at position 59, threonine at position 190, and glutamic acid at position 191 are parts of a conformational neutralizing epitope [7, 26]. Asparagine at position 77 and isoleucine at position 206 are key residues and essential for antibody recognition [27]. According to a previous report, if an amino acid in an epitope mutates, the mutated virus cannot be recognized by the epitope\u2019s antibody [28]. Meanwhile, compared with the traditional PCV2a/PCV2b strain, the PCV2d strain contains seven unique amino acids (53I, 59 K, 68 N, 89 L, 90 T, 134 N, 169R) in the Cap protein sequence, and these amino acids are mostly distributed along the surface of the viral nucleocapsid. This new surface conformation also renders the antibodies raised against the SH and LG vaccines unable to neutralize the virus [29]. In the present study, several aa mutations occurred at epitopes in the Cap protein. For the isolates Lijiang-2017 and Lijiang-2018, mutations occurred at positions 133 (A133V), 134 (T134N) and 206 (I206K). Although Lijiang-2017 and Lijiang-2018 belong to PCV2a, these aa mutations are consistent with PCV2d unique amino acid sequences and occurred at epitope-associated positions. Yuxi-2018 isolates belong to PCV2b; a mutation at position 59 (R59K) is consistent with PCV2d. These aa mutations may be responsible for contributing to genotypic variation in PCV2. In addition, several PCV2d isolates also substituted mutations at positions 53 (Y53C) and 187 (L187P) in HongHe-2016, 169 (R169G) in HongHe-2017 and HongHe-2018, and 200 (T200P) in KunMing-2018. These aa mutations at epitope-associated positions may be responsible for PCV2 escaping from the immune defence of the host and promoting the spread of PCV2 strains among pig populations. Although the widespread use of vaccines can control PCVAD, PCV2 is still present in pig herds, which suggests that some changes might have occurred on the viruses. PCV2 escapes the host immune system by continuously changing its antigenic properties. Mutations at the positions between different genotypes of the isolates are positively selected under pressure, suggesting that amino acid changes at these sites are beneficial for the virus and may contribute to the escape of PCV2 from the host immune system.",
