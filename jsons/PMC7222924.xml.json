            "text": "Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common arrhythmia after cardiac surgery [1]. Many risk factors exist for development of post-operative AF (POAF) [2\u20135]. POAF is the consequence of multiple re-entry wavelets resulting from the \u201cdispersion of atrial refractoriness\u201d (non-uniformity of the distribution of local atrial refractory periods). Dispersion of atrial refractoriness requires an atrial structural substrate. It might be the consequence of advanced age, hypertension, diabetes, obesity, left atrial enlargement, and left ventricular hypertrophy. Operative and post-operative factors such as atrial ischemia and surgical atrial injury might also contribute to the development of the structural substrate. Inflammation, oxidative stress, and genetic factors also seem to play an important role. Once these conditions are present, a triggering factor such as an atrial premature contraction, electrolyte imbalance, and/or enhanced adrenergic or vagal stimulation will initiate POAF [6]. Both experimental and clinical studies have provided strong evidence that atrial ischemia is the primary stimulus that triggers the development of POAF in patients with atrial \u201cdispersion of refractoriness\u201d [6]. Since its incidence peaks at post-operative day 2 or 3, inflammatory mechanisms, both systemic and local, may also play an important role in the development of POAF [2].",

            "text": "Off-pump technique of coronary artery bypass grafting (OPCAB) is believed to elicit less systemic inflammation than on-pump surgery because of reduced cytokine responses and less myocardial injury. OPCAB also allows avoidance of ischemia/reperfusion injury and reduces the oxidative stress. Ascione et al. [7] reported that the incidence of POAF after CABG was decreased, from 45% in patients operated under cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) to 11% in those operated without CPB. Another study [8] documented reduction in POAF, from 28% in hearts protected with cardioplegic arrest to 9% in those operated on using intermittent ischemia. Both these studies point to inadequate atrial protection using cardioplegic arrest as the trigger for developing POAF.",

Eighteen (12 patients in the NSR group and 6 in the POAF group) patients expired during follow-up. In 2 patients (one in each group), the cause of death could not be ascertained. All patients in POAF and 8 patients in NSR died due to cardiac cause. The non-cardiac causes included COPD exacerbation in 2 patients, malignancy in one patient, and sepsis from cellulites in another patient. There was no difference in myocardial infarction rates, angina rates, repeat revascularization, and heart failure admissions between the 2 groups. However, late occurrence of chronic kidney disease and stroke was more common in the POAF group during follow-up (Table 3).",

The role of OPCAB in reducing the incidence of AF is controversial. CPB inclusive of cardioplegic arrest was the main independent predictor of POAF (OR 7.4, CI 3.4\u201317.9) in patients undergoing CABG in a prospective randomized study reported by Ascione et.al [7]. However, this report was criticized for its small patient sample size and single-center origin. Moreover, several studies failed to show statistical association between OPCAB and a lower incidence of POAF. Investigators of the ROOBY trial (the randomized on vs. off bypass trial) found that the incidence of POAF was 27% in off-pump group with no difference in POAF rate based on off-pump vs. on-pump strategy of revascularization [20]. The ROOBY trial was criticized for the fact that the conversion rate to CPB was unacceptably high at 12% and has drawn skepticism as to the level of \u201coff pump\u201d experience of the surgeons involved in the study. Patients enrolled were almost exclusively males and there was a trend toward enrolling lower-risk patients and excluding higher-risk patients. It is questionable whether this study is applicable to the real world. In the mass III trial, the incidence of POAF in OPCAB patients was 35% and much higher than patients undergoing on-pump CABG [21]. Since we rarely perform CABG using CPB, we are unable to comment on this outlier study.",

In the recently published OPERA (omega-3 fatty acids for prevention of post-operative atrial fibrillation) trial [22], compared with on-pump CABG, OPCAB was significantly associated with a lower risk of POAF (odds ratio (OR), 0.53; 95% CI, 0.33\u20130.85) among men and in patients aged less than 65 years (OR, 0.35; 95%CI, 0.16\u20130.75). Lower POAF rates are reported in the south Asian population [9, 10] compared with the Caucasian race. Younger age at the time of revascularization and lower body mass index are the usual reasons for the lower incidence of POAF in the south Asian population [23].

However, surgical stresses, blood transfusions, and endotoxemia from bacterial translocation from gut are some factors that provoke the development of systemic inflammatory syndrome/sepsis in OPCAB [24]. In our series, 11.2% of patients developed clinical and or laboratory features suggestive of sepsis. 2.67% had positive bacterial cultures. It is also likely that secondary to multiple systemic issues in healthcare, the burden of nosocomial sepsis, including post-operative sepsis, is higher in emerging economies. In multivariate analysis, it has emerged as a strong risk factor for development of POAF. Systemic inflammation associated with sepsis is a well-known trigger for development of POAF in critically ill patients [25]. This study highlights the important contribution of sepsis to the occurrence of POAF, hitherto probably under reported in the post-operative cardiac surgical population. POAF will worsen the hemodynamic parameters in patients with both diastolic dysfunction [26] and systolic dysfunction emphasizing needs for the health systems in these countries to target sepsis control as high priority.
