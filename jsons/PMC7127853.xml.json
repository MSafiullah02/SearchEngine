Their development has resulted in three approved drugs, and research on ANPs continues to provide new active compounds.1, 2 The presence of the phosphonate group is responsible for their ionic character when subjected to physiological pH. The ionized molecule is not easily permeable through the gastrointestinal wall and biological membranes. In order to achieve better oral bioavailability, the phosphonate group of the drug can be transformed to a phosphonic ester or amidate, which is enzymatically cleaved to the parent drug after passing the intestinal barrier, or later inside the cells. A considerable number of ANP prodrugs have been evaluated, but only a few of them passed the preclinical studies. This likely arises from the complexity in achieving the right balance between the suitable chemical, physical, and pharmacological prodrug properties.",

The orally administered prodrug is absorbed and then cleaved by carboxyesterases in the serum generating pivalate and formaldehyde as its byproducts.

Some alkyl6 and alkyloxyalkyl7 esters of nucleotides or acyclic nucleoside phosphonates have already been advanced into clinical studies. Their antiviral activities are superior when compared to the parent drugs. On the other hand, their physical properties are far from being optimal. They suffer from low solubility in water. Additionally, a simple alkyl chain is subjected to a \u03c9-oxidation process resulting in inactivation of the prodrug. Therefore, we have focused on those promoieties consisting of the aliphatic chain modified by means of addition(s) of hydroxyl group(s) or insertions of oxygen atoms. A hydroxylated alkyl or alkyloxyalkyl unit or a hexaethyleneglycol unit was attached by ester linkage to the phosphonate group of Adefovir as a model drug. The influence of the above-mentioned modifications on the in vitro antiviral activities is reported here. We also studied the effects of the addition of the hexaethylene glycol unit in Cidofovir [(S)-HPMPC, 2] as prodrugs closely related to Cidofovir hexadecyloxypropyl and octadecyloxyethyl esters, that is, HDP (S)-HPMPC and ODE (S)-HPMPC, respectively7 (Fig. 1\n). HDP (S)-HPMPC (CMX001) is currently being developed for use in the prophylactic and preemptive therapy of dsDNA viral infections.",

The compounds were also evaluated against retroviruses [(i.e., human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) and type 2 (HIV-2)] (Table 2\n). All of the compounds were also examined against several RNA viruses, including vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV), Coxsackie B4, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), parainfluenza virus type 3, reovirus-1, Sindbis virus and Punta Toro virus (Table 2). None of the prodrugs showed activity against the different RNA viruses, except for HIV-1 and HIV-2. However, a loss in the antiviral activities of the hydroxylated decyl or decyloxyethyl and hexaethyleneglycol esters of PMEA (compounds 3\u201314) against HIV was observed since compound 7 {2-[(10-Hydroxydecyl)oxy]ethyl ester of PMEA} was the only compound among this type of prodrugs showing some activity against HIV at nontoxic concentrations. Thus, compound 7 was able to inhibit HIV replication with 50% effective concentrations (EC50) which were \u223c10-fold higher than those observed for PMEA. In contrast, the (5-methyl-2-oxo-1,3-dioxolen-4-yl)methyl ester of PMEA (compound 15) had anti-HIV activities (EC50 values of 10.6 \u03bcM and 9.3 \u03bcM for HIV-1 and HIV-2, respectively) equivalent to that of PMEA (EC50 values of 10.4 and 8.6 \u03bcM for HIV-1 and HIV-2, respectively).",

In the case of HSV and VZV, the drop in antiviral activities was inferior to that observed for HIV since the EC50 values for compound 7 against HSV and VZV were three- to four-fold lower than those for PMEA. However, compound 7 was totally inactive against CMV. The (5-methyl-2-oxo-1,3-dioxolen-4-yl)methyl ester 15 had anti-herpesvirus activities.

The loss of anti-HIV activity of 12 is even more significant (>107-fold compared to HDP\u2013PMEA). Comparison of activities of compounds 3\u201311 with HDP\u2013PMEA is not possible because different chain length plays a role. We can only speculate based on the relationship between activity and chain length, as observed with Cidofovir prodrugs.11 The adequate chain shortening from 20 atoms (HDP) to 12 atoms (octyloxypropyl) caused circa 1000-fold drop in anti-CMV activity. However, the decrease in antiviral activity of compounds 3\u20138 is more significant (\u223c107-fold compared to HDP\u2013PMEA) and is hardly accountable solely to the chain shortening.",

The antiviral assays, other than HIV, were based on the inhibition of virus-induced cytopathicity or plaque formation in human embryonic lung (HEL) fibroblasts, African green monkey cells (Vero), human epithelial cells (HeLa), Crandell-Rees feline kidney cells (CRFK), or Madin Darby canine kidney cells (MDCK). Confluent cell cultures in microtiter 96-well plates were inoculated with 100 CCID50 of virus (1 CCID50 being the virus dose to infect 50% of the cell cultures) or with 20 plaque forming units (PFU). After 1\u20132 h adsorption period, the residual virus was removed, and the cell cultures were incubated in the presence of varying concentrations of the test compounds. Viral cytopathicity or plaque formation (VZV) was recorded as soon as it reached completion in the control virus-infected cell cultures that were not treated with the test compounds. Antiviral activity was expressed as the EC50 or concentration required reducing virus-induced cytopathogenicity or viral plaque formation by 50%. The methodology of the anti-HIV assays was as follows: human CEM (\u223c3 \u00d7 105\n cells/cm3) were infected with 100 CCID50 of HIV-1 (IIIB) or HIV-2 (ROD)/ml and seeded in 200-\u03bcL wells of a microtiter plate containing appropriate dilutions of the test compounds. After four days of incubation at 37 \u00b0C, HIV-induced CEM giant cell formation was examined microscopically.",

HEL cells were seeded at a rate of 5 \u00d7 103\n cells/well into 96-well microtiter plates and allowed to proliferate for 24 h. Then, medium containing different concentrations of the test compounds was added. After three days of incubation at 37 \u00b0C, the cell number was determined with a Coulter counter. The cytostatic concentration was calculated as the CC50, or the compound concentration required reducing cell proliferation by 50% relative to the number of cells in the untreated controls. CC50 values were estimated from graphic plots of the number of cells (percentage of control) as a function of the concentration of the test compounds. Alternatively, the cytotoxicity of the test compounds was expressed as the minimum cytotoxic concentration (MCC) or the compound concentration that caused a microscopically detectable alteration of cell morphology.",
