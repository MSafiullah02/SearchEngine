There is an international consensus on the importance of humidifi cation during invasive mechanical ventilation. The two humidifi cation methods used during invasive MV are: the heated humidifi er and the heat-and-moisture exchange (HME). Noninvasive mechanical ventilation (NIV) is increasingly used in intensive care units (ICU) and emergency departments. Currently, it is the standard of care in the treatment of acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), acute cardiogenic pulmonary edema (CPE), and immunocompromised patients [ 2, 3 ] . Furthermore, NIV is available for home use for patients with sleep-related breathing disorders and chronic respiratory failure.",

In the last decade, there has been a major technological breakthrough in the manufacturing of humidifi ers and a better understanding of how to incorporate these new humidifi ers into the conventional devices of NIV. For example, with some of these humidifi ers, some potential benefi cial effects were described on the control of hypercapnia and work of breathing (WOB) [ 13 ] . Furthermore, a form of agreement that humidifi cation of inspired gases should be a standard of care has begun to evolve among specialists [ 1 ] . Since 2005, a growing number of studies on the use of humidifi cation in NIV have been published. In this chapter, we discuss the international survey we conducted in 2008 in 15 hospitals to explore the practice of incorporating humidifi cation in NIV [ 5 ] .

A status of balance between the cost and the benefi ts of humidifi cation should be achieved particularly when considering short-term use of NIV [ 18 ] . With regard to invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV), clinical aspects such as the duration of IMV, the increased risk of developing ventilatorassociated pneumonia and weaning diffi culties are well identifi ed and important outcomes that favor the routine and early use of humidifi cation [ 19, 20 ] . Unfortunately, in the case of NIV such clinical outcomes are not well identifi ed and studied. Nevertheless, the development of complications as a result of not using proper humidifi cation in patients with ARF treated with NIV will add to the cost of ARF treatment. Furthermore, failure of NIV for any reason will lead to a more costly intervention, such as endotracheal intubation. Therefore, it would be reasonable to identify patients on NIV at a moderate to high risk of developing complications if not using humidifi cation and provide them with early humidifi cation. One of the serious complications is the diffi culty experienced with endotracheal intubation, which is attributed to the dryness of the upper airway mucosa [ 5, 8, 16, 21 ] .",

The loss of these characteristics leads to retention of the bronchial secretions, especially in the distal airways of the bronchial system that are diffi cult to draw from, and results in increased airway resistance, impaired gas exchange, and airway obstruction, etc. [ 6, 15, 21 ] . The early combination of proper humidifi cation with cough-assist techniques is useful and can improve the outcome of the NIV. Other factors that can encourage an early implementation of humdifi cation include: older age, increased nasal resistance, mucociliary dysfunction, medication that can cause dehydration of the mucosa, chronic nasal or respiratory diseases, mouth breathing, and bronchial hypersecretion, especially if associated with COPD or bronchiectasis [ 21, 23, 25 ] . Despite the long list of proposed benefi ts of humdifi cation in NIV, it is usually used without humdifi cation, and controversy still exits regarding humidifi cation effi cacy [ 1, 4 ] . More studies are needed to document the benefi ts of humidifi cation in patients with ARF who require NIV. Although we still need more evidence, the application of humidifi cation in the above-discussed conditions is encouraged. Contrarily, some factors deter the routine use of humidifi cation in NIV. These factors include: 1. Absence of a consensus on the criteria needed to identify the appropriate candidates and indications for early humidifi cation use. 2. In some cases, the humidifi er model used can induce asynchronization problems via different mechanisms [ 6, 13, 19, 26, 27 ] : I. Increasing the largest dead space, II. Increasing work of breathing, III. Rebreathing problems, IV. Causing a drop in inspiratory positive pressure. 3. Humidifi er use may increase the cost of treatment with NIV [ 18 ] . 4. Concerns with cross-infection may limit the use of humidifi ers. Heat-moisture exchange (HME) use for short-term NIV in patients with ARF is associated with less cross-infection [ 28 ] . The heated humidifi er may carry a greater risk of spreading aerosols of respiratory viral infections (SARS, H1N1) or Mycobacterium tuberculosis . Nevertheless, the currently published work of the International Network Group, which was analyzed during the H1N1 pandemic, did not demonstrate such an association [ 29 ] . However, with the long-term use of NIV at home for OSAS, a potential risk of colonization and infection was described [ 30 ] .",

Heated humidifi er (HH) The HH acts as an active system to increase the AH to acceptable levels with a minimal effect on the set inspiratory positive airway pressure (IPAP) (on average IPAP can decrease by a value of 0.5-1 cmH 2 O) [ 20 ] . Currently HHs are preferred when the air is dry and cold with retention of bronchial secretions [ 26 ] . Unidirectional fl ow causes nasal mucosal dryness, promotes the release of infl ammatory mediators, and increases nasal resistance [ 15, 21 ] . The HH increases the RH in the air, reduces nasal airway resistance, and may increase adherence to the NIV compared to HMEs [ 6, 8, 9, 17, 26, 33 ] .",

It is recommended to be applied early, but not recommended with all types of interfaces (nasal mask or face mask). They are ideal for the helmet system. Chanques et al. found that the humidifi ers most commonly used are HMEs (52%), followed by HHs (26%), both (4%), and neither (19%) in postoperative resuscitation units. In our international survey, we analyzed the information from 15 hospitals including information on 1635 patients who had been treated with NIV in 2008 [ 5 ] (Fig. 11.1 ). When the results were analyzed in relation to the humidifi cation system used, we found that the heated wire humidifi er (HWH) was used most frequently (46.6%). No differences between countries, types of hospital settings, or acute care units were observed. This is different from the results of Chanques et al., who analyzed data collected from post-surgical observation units [ 31 ] .",
