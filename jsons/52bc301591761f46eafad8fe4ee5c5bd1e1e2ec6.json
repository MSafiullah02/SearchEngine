In the case of COVID-19, estimates of R 0 from epidemiological data suggest R 0 \u2243 2.5 \u2212 3; this can be compared with R 0 for standard seasonal flu, which is about half.

In this, there are two classes of infected/infectives individuals, I and J, and two classes of removed ones, R and U . Here I represents the known infectives, J the unknown (in particular, asymptomatic) ones; similarly R represents the registered recovered individuals, while U the unregistered ones -basically those who went through an asymptomatic infection and are removed from the epidemic dynamics only once they are naturally healed. The model assumes that both classes of infectives are equally infective (it would be easy to formulate a variation removing this assumption, but we want to deal with the simplest model accounting for asymptomatic infectives); on the other hand, while symptomatic infectives are promptly removed from the dynamics by Hospital or home isolation, asymptomatic ones stay around for all the infective period.
