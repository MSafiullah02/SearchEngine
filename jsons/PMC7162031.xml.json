In previous studies, triterpenoid saponins have been shown to possess marked antiviral activity at concentrations at which the saponin showed no cytotoxic effect on Vero cells.\n13\n, \n15\n The mechanism of the antiviral activity was suggested to be associated with an early event in the viral infectious cycle, through the inhibition of virus\u2013host cell attachment based on a direct interaction of saikosaponin D with the surface membrane of host cells.\n16\n, \n17\n In the present study, we postulated that the antiviral activity of saikosaponin B2 on anti\u2010HCoV\u2010229E could be through a direct inactivation of the virus or by direct interaction with the host cell membrane, resulting in morphological changes in the cell membrane.
