A sequential timing of relaxing restrictions across groups is explored in order to identify policies that simultaneously reduce health risks and economic stagnation relative to current policies. The goal will be to mitigate health risks, particularly among the most fragile sub-populations, while also managing the deleterious effect of restrictions on economic activity. The results of this paper show that a properly constructed sequential release of age-defined subgroups from strict social distancing protocols can lead to lower overall fatality rates than the simultaneous release of all individuals after a lockdown. The optimal release policy, in terms of minimizing overall death rate, must be sequential in nature, and it is important to properly time each step of the staggered release. This model allows for testing of various timing choices for staggered release policies, which can provide insights that may be helpful in the design, testing, and planning of disease management policies for the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and future outbreaks. arXiv:2005.05549v1 [q-bio.PE] 12 May 2020",

However, limiting attention to this specific class of policies ignores the crucial fact that diseases like COVID-19 have differential impacts of infection on various sub-groups of the population. Disease severity and survival rates for COVID-19 have been documented to vary significantly based on age and health of an individual (CDC, 2020). In this paper, we make use of this inherent variation to design a more effective set of restrictions that strategically releases some sub-groups of the population earlier than others.",

This is the downside of the any simultaneous release policy that serves as the benchmark for comparison in this paper.

By releasing the young group from restrictions at an earlier date than others, their subsequent exposure to the disease, which would mostly result in asymptomatic or mild infections, provides a much higher density of immunity in the population when it comes time to release the older groups from restrictions. This lowers the likelihood of infection for everyone post-lockdown which should help avoid exceeding health care capacity. The concept of deploying recovered individuals with antibodies into society to restart the economy while keeping infectious contacts low is further developed in (Weitz et al., 2020) who term it 'shield immunity. ' Compare this manageable level of infections to the potentially dangerous secondary peak that would appear under the simultaneous release policy. In that scenario, an overburdened health care system has significant negative spillover effects to all members of the population regardless of their COVID-19 infection status. Any patients with a severe infection during a time when health care systems are overburdened face a significantly higher risk of death, and it is precisely these additional deaths that staggered release policies are able to reduce, according to our results.",

The model introduced in this section is an extension of the standard Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious-Removed (SEIR) model modified by the incorporation of asymptomatic infections, disease-induced deaths, hospitalizations, and preferential mixing between different age groups. These extensions enable a flexible description of COVID-19 disease transmission dynamics within a model that accounts for age-defined groups.

Although our model is formulated for n groups, in order to illustrate our approach, we consider three groups denoted by G1, G2, G3, representing young (age 35 and younger), middle-aged (35 to 65 years old), and elderly (65 and over), respectively.

In this section, we explore the impact of releasing the middle-aged group at some point between the young group and the elderly group as well. The intuition would be that since the middle-aged group is less vulnerable than the elderly group, staggering their releases may have similar benefits to the early release of the young group. We will observe a similar result here, but with some caveats. In order to facilitate the intermediate release of the middle-aged group, we will now need to include a tertiary period of restrictions, during which that group may be released. This will be a natural extension of previous notation. As d b and d s referred to the duration of initial and secondary restrictions, d t will be used to refer to the duration of tertiary restrictions. As before, s o (t) = 0.8 for all t < T 1 + d b + d s + d t , but now s m (t) = s t m \u2264 0.8 is another policy variable. At this point it becomes expedient to denote four particularly important values for t. First, T 1 is the day of the outbreak on which initial restrictions are installed. We will maintain T 1 = 70 as before.

Thus policies can be further simplified as a choice of release dates (r y , r m , r o ) for the three groups, where r i \u2208 {T 2 , T 3 , T 4 }. Note that the extremal staggered policy considered in section 3.1 with s s y = 0.1 would be represented by (r y , r m , r o ) = (T 2 , T 4 , T 4 ) with (d b , d s , d t ) = (30, 70, 0). We call this the \"young release\" policy. The baseline simultaneous release policy will be the same idea as before, with all three groups being held under the same severity of restrictions as the initial restrictions until T 4 . This is represented by (r y , r m , r o ) = (T 4 , T 4 , T 4 ). Two natural comparisons are the \"young release\" policy and the \"middle release\" policy of (r y , r m , r o ) = (T 2 , T 3 , T 4 ), where the young group is released after initial restrictions and the middle-aged group is released after secondary restrictions. Figure  4 depicts the timing of policy changes for an example staggered release policy. These policies will be evaluated based on the resulting peak size of infections and projected death rates for the elderly (\u03c9 o ) and overall (\u03c9). is the \"young release\" case where the young group is released at T 2 = 100 days. Plot (c) is the \"young and middle-aged release\" case, where the young group is released at T 2 = 100 days and the middle-aged group is released at T 3 = 140 days. Plot (d) is the \"alternate staggered release\" case, where the young group is released at T 2 = 100 days and the middle-aged group is released at T 3 = 150 days. More detailed descriptions of these results can be found in the text and Table 2 . (30, 50, 40). This fourth policy is an adapted version of the \"middle release\" policy designed as a minimal change in order to fix a key oversight that would lead to negative consequences if the \"middle release\" policy is implemented. These four policies along with projections for peak size and various death rates are summarized in Table 2 . Table 2 : Comparison of four different policies and associated outcomes. A detailed description of these policies can be found in the text and Figure 5 offers a visualization of their projections.",

This represents a non-trivial trade-off between decreasing death rates for the middle-aged group and the elderly, but whichever choice is made would result in one of the staggered release policies being chosen. Since members of the young group face very small risk from the disease, only negligible changes to their death rate occurs across any of these policies. The more fundamental question of how to handle the trade-off between economic stagnation and health risks is certainly difficult to answer, but from these results it would appear that however that problem is ultimately tackled, the resulting optimal policy must incorporate some form of staggered release. An early simultaneous release is far too costly in terms of health risks and loss of life to justify the marginal increase in economic activity compared to even a slightly staggered release policy. On the other hand, a delayed simultaneous release is both economically detrimental and more dangerous than staggered release policies.",

The estimated size of this effect is robust to alternate parameter specifications, and some sensitivity analysis is presented in the Appendix.

The decision to lift restrictions on everyone simultaneously is perhaps the natural policy, but this can have dire consequences if a second peak arises as a result of insufficient immunity in the population.

That is, initial restrictions of severity s b = 0.8 were installed at time T 1 = 70 for a duration of d b = 30 days. Then at t = T 1 + d b = 100, there is a choice of whether (and to what degree) to release the young group from restrictions; a choice of s s y . Regardless of this choice, the middle-aged and elderly groups are held under restrictions for d s = 70 more days, and eventually everyone is (mostly) released (s r = 0.1) from restrictions at t = T 1 + d b + d s = 170 days.

We will present the aggregate death rates between a staggered release policy and a simultaneous release policy for a variety of values for each of the following parameter groups: proportion of asymptomatic cases (p i ), preferential mixing ( i ), recovery rate (\u03b3), and the duration of restriction for the initial period (d b ).
