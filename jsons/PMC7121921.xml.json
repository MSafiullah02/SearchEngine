Infection with RSV may occur at any age, although it is most frequently diagnosed in the first 2 years of life. Reinfections with RSV may occur. It causes upper respiratory tract symptoms, such as rhinorrhea (often copious in nature), cough, and otitis media, as well as lower respiratory tract disease, such as bronchiolitis and pneumonia. In newborns or premature infants, apnea may be a presenting symptom. Most infections with RSV occur during the fall and early winter, but there are annual and regional differences to the start and finish of each RSV season. Most RSV infections are self-limited; however, infection may cause serious, even life-threatening disease in medically fragile patients, such as those with congenital heart disease, neuromuscular disease, and/or immunocompromised hosts. RSV is a common cause for medical visits in clinics, urgent care centers, and emergency centers, as well as hospitalization in acute care and intensive care units, providing ample opportunity for nosocomial transmission. Nosocomial outbreaks in pediatric wards, pediatric intensive care units, bone marrow transplant units, and neonatal intensive care units have been reported [8, 10, 11] and are associated with prolonged hospitalizations, prolonged time receiving mechanical ventilation, and even increased mortality.",

It also can persist on environmental surfaces and hands. Healthcare-associated transmission from patient to healthcare worker often occurs via hand to nose or hand to eye self-inoculation after contact with contaminated secretions. Patients hospitalized with suspected or proven RSV infection should be cared for under standard and contact precautions (Table 14.1), using gown and gloves, and rigorous hand hygiene. Some centers, especially bone marrow transplant units, will also use enhanced isolation precautions, and add droplet precautions, with healthcare workers wearing surgical masks during patient encounters [15\u201317]. In a quasi-experimental study in a children\u2019s hospital, the use of contact and droplet precautions was associated with a 39% reduction in nosocomial respiratory viral infections (including RSV) [1]. The use of eye goggles or face masks is not routinely recommended to reduce nosocomial transmission of RSV from patient to healthcare worker. Additional measures found to be helpful in some centers to minimize nosocomial spread of RSV include cohorting infants with suspected or proven RSV infection and excluding visitors with respiratory tract infections.",

The PIVs are also seasonal viruses, and usually circulate in early fall and late spring/early summer, with different serotypes having distinct seasonal patterns. Most children are infected with PIVs prior to 5 years of age. Infection with PIVs is usually self-limited; however, prolonged viral shedding, often associated with severe lower respiratory tract disease which may be fatal, may occur in immunocompromised patients. In children who have received bone marrow transplants, PIV infections commonly result in serious lower respiratory tract infections, especially if they occur before engraftment [18]. In such patients, ribavirin may be administered in efforts to shorten the duration and lessen the severity of disease [19].",

Many hospitals will enforce droplet precautions at the time of admission, for all patients presenting with ILI, until the cause can be established through appropriate diagnostic testing. During the 2009 influenza A (H1N1) pandemic, infection control recommendations from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention included the use of N95 respirators for healthcare workers caring for patients with suspected pandemic influenza, in addition to contact and droplet precautions. Realistically, however, many institutions had difficulty complying with these enhanced isolation precautions, either due to unavailability of N95 respirators, poor tolerability, work flow concerns, or patient volume, among other reasons. In addition, to their impact on individual patient symptoms, antiviral agents have a role in the prevention of spread of influenza within a hospital unit. Prompt antiviral therapy with oseltamivir or zanamivir for children hospitalized with ILI or confirmed influenza virus infections has been shown to reduce nosocomial spread of influenza by reducing viral shedding in infected patients [24]. Oseltamivir resistance may emerge during prolonged antiviral treatment of hospitalized immunocompromised hosts who have persistent and prolonged viral shedding while receiving antiviral therapy. Routine immunization of all healthcare workers with the seasonal influenza vaccine, prior to the beginning of the influenza season, is also recommended (and even mandatory in many hospitals) to reduce healthcare worker-to-patient transmission of infection.",

Nosocomial outbreaks of rhinovirus infection and disease in pediatric hospitals and neonatal intensive care units have been documented. A notable emerging pathogen included in this group is Enterovirus D68 (EV-D68); EV-D68 can cause respiratory illness or asthma exacerbation in children, as well as acute flaccid paralysis similar to poliomyelitis [32].",

In one study, 37% of environmental samples taken from a children\u2019s hospital waiting room in the winter had evidence of adenovirus [7], highlighting the potential for this virus to persist in the environment. Nosocomial outbreaks in pediatric wards, bone marrow transplant units, intensive care units, ophthalmology clinics, and neonatal intensive care units have been documented [34, 35]. Medical devices, such as eye specula (blepharostat) used to examine the eyes of newborns and preterm infants at risk for retinopathy of prematurity in the nurseries and neonatal intensive care units, have also been linked to nosocomial outbreaks [34]. In addition, tonometer prisms used in ophthalmology clinics may be a source of ADV infection after eye exams [36]. Given this notable risk of infection transmission, single-use eye specula and tonometers are preferred if available. Autoclave sterilization is the preferred method of sterilization of reusable eyelid specula between neonate examinations. However, if autoclave use is not available or will damage the instrument, washing the specula with chlorhexidine gluconate or dilute bleach (sodium hypochlorite) in between examinations may be more effective than cleaning with an alcohol swab [37\u201339]. Patients in the healthcare setting with suspected or proven ADV infections should be cared for under standard, contact, and droplet precautions. In addition, rigorous hand hygiene with soap and water or an alcohol-based hand rub should be enforced and environmental surfaces should be disinfected frequently [40]. Notably, one laboratory-based study found that alcohol-based solutions in hand sanitizers may not be effective against some strains of adenovirus [36].",

They can be cultured using special isolation techniques involving amoebae as a eukaryotic co-host and detected by molecular techniques. Clinical diagnosis, however, remains a challenge since they are difficult to detect. However, serologic assays have suggested these viruses may play a role in community-acquired and healthcare-associated pneumonia in adults [44].

Intravenous acyclovir is recommended for immunocompromised patients. Other antivirals commonly used to treat cytomegalovirus (CMV), such as ganciclovir, valganciclovir, foscarnet, and cidofovir, also have activity against VZV. Administration of varicella immune globulin (VariZIG) or intravenous immune globulin (IVIG) may be used in select situations for postexposure immunoprophylaxis, in addition to antiviral therapy with acyclovir or valacyclovir [50].",

Skin lesions from chicken pox and zoster contain high titers of infectious virus which may aerosolize or be deposited on fomites or surfaces and are the most likely sources of viral transmission. Molecular techniques have also detected VZV DNA in the air surrounding patients with varicella zoster infections (chicken pox and zoster) [54]. Transmission from respiratory droplets is thought to be much less common. Nosocomial transmission of VZV infections is well documented in the healthcare setting (especially pediatric wards), and healthcare-associated outbreaks, sometimes with fatal outcomes in immunocompromised hosts, may occur [55, 56]. Patients hospitalized with chicken pox or disseminated zoster (or immunocompromised patients with simple zoster who may be at risk for dissemination) should be isolated in a private room equipped with a separate exhaust system and negative pressure air relative to the hallway, if such rooms are available [50]. They should also, in addition to standard precautions, be cared for with contact and airborne precautions. Isolation should continue until no new lesions occur, and all lesions that have occurred are completely crusted over. In addition, nonimmune patients in the hospital setting who have been exposed to varicella should also be isolated under airborne and contact precautions for 8\u201321 days after exposure (and up to 28 days after exposure if VariZIG or IVIG were received as postexposure immunoprophylaxis) if they require ongoing hospitalization. Newborns born to mothers with varicella at the time of delivery should also be isolated and cared for under contact and airborne precautions while hospitalized (or until 21 days of age or 28 days if immunoglobulin is provided). Normal patients with localized zoster may not require special isolation with airborne and contact precautions if the zoster lesions are able to be completely covered. However, some hospital infection control officers may prefer to isolate even immunocompetent patients with localized zoster under airborne precautions and, if available, place them in a negative pressure room, especially if they are roomed near immunocompromised patients.",

These specific characteristics allow for the ready nosocomial spread of rotavirus. Since the advent of the rotavirus vaccine, the epidemiology of rotavirus diarrhea has changed in developed countries who employ routine immunization, with a substantial decrease in outpatient visits and hospitalizations for rotavirus diarrhea as well as reduced nosocomial acquisition of infection [59].

The latter is a chronic disease of the respiratory tract that often requires repeated surgical procedures or photoangiolytic laser treatments to alleviate long-term stenotic complications in the airways. Oral warts and oropharyngeal cancers caused by HPV types 16 and 18 also may require laser/electrosurgery procedures. These procedures may generate laser plumes, aerosols, or smoke that may contain HPV virus particles and therefore are a potential risk for healthcare workers. The risk of inhalation of potentially infectious aerosols that may be generated during the procedure can be mitigated by performing the procedures in a well-ventilated room, while using localized smoke evacuator exhaust ventilation, and wearing of N95 respirators during the procedure [68]. Reports also exist of HPV contamination of improperly sterilized gynecologic instruments and vaginal ultrasound probes [69, 70].

In resource-limited healthcare facilities, mobile Ebola treatment units (ETUs) are typically set up, with \u201ccold zone\u201d and \u201chot zone\u201d designations to minimize the risk of healthcare-associated transmission between patients, from patients to healthcare workers, and to the community [88]. Only specially trained, essential personnel should enter the SIU, ETU, or hospital room to care for the patient with suspected or proven EVD , and a log of all persons should be maintained, and their symptoms monitored for fever, cough, or other acute illnesses for 14 days after contact with the patient. Personnel should be trained in both standard hand hygiene and PPE, such as gloves, gowns, and eye and face shield protection, as well as use of fit-tested, N95 filtering facepiece respirators and face shields in AIIRs or PAPRs used in SIUs [89]. Caution should be used when performing all aerosol-generating procedures. All procedures, such as blood drawing or central line access, should be minimized, carefully planned, and performed with extreme care. All trash contaminated with bodily fluids requires special handling and should be double-bagged, taped closed, and autoclaved or incinerated prior to leaving the SIU or ETU. Toilets should be flushed with the lid closed, or with a covering over the bowl during the flush, to minimize aerosols of potentially infectious material [87]. All surfaces in contact with the patient, or near the patient, should be frequently cleaned and decontaminated, and special handling is required after a spill or body fluid contamination. PUIs or those proven to be infected with Ebola virus should be reported to the healthcare facility infection control officer and the local public health authorities at once. If the patient dies, special precautions are recommended for autopsy and handling of the human remains.",
