BNNs are typically implemented using arbitrary normal-distributed prior distributions on the model parameters. Here, we explore the effects of different prior distributions on classification tasks in BNNs and evaluate the evidence supporting the predictions based on posterior probabilities approximated by Markov Chain Monte Carlo sampling and by computing Bayes factors. We show that the choice of priors has a substantial impact on the ability of the model to confidently assign data to the correct class (true positive rates). Prior choice also affects significantly the ability of a BNN to identify out-of-distribution instances as unknown (false positive rates). When comparing our results against neural networks (NN) with Monte Carlo dropout we found that BNNs generally outperform NNs. Finally, in our tests we did not find a single best choice as prior distribution. Instead, each dataset yielded the best results under a different prior, indicating that testing alternative options can improve the performance of BNNs.",

We rescaled all features using a min-max scaler prior to training. II. Virus data -As a possible real-world application, we compiled and analyzed a dataset of influenza virus RNA sequences, obtained from the Influenza Research Database [29] (www.fludb.org). Even though Influenza viruses are RNA viruses, the sequences that are available for download are coded in common DNA notation, i.e. the RNA nucleotide uracil (U) is coded as thymine (T). Our dataset was restricted to Influenza A viruses (e.g. the swine flu virus H1N1), which are categorized into subtypes based on the combination of two surface proteins hemagglutinin (H) and neuraminidase (N). We downloaded the coding RNA sequences (genes) of both of these proteins as sequence alignments (individually for each protein) and trimmed the alignments at the first methionine (Met) codon. To deal with individual sequences of differing lengths, we trimmed the end of the alignments to ensure >50% of sequence coverage throughout the complete alignment. Next, we randomly selected 600 sequences for each subtype, only choosing samples with sequence data for both genes; the final dataset included 6,600 samples belonging to 11 Influenza A subtypes. We then transformed the nucleotide sequences into numerical arrays, by determining the frequencies of each possible nucleotide triplet (i.e. all possible 3-letter permutations of the 4 nucleotides A,C,G,T), independently of the amino acid reading frame. The resulting arrays of 4 3 = 64 frequencies of nucleotide triplets for each of the two segments were concatenated between the two genes, resulting in a set of 128 features for each instance.",

To this end we simulated a dataset in which features were largely overlapping among classes. The dataset included 20 classes each represented by 199 instances. For each class k we sampled 10 features drawn from beta distributions, such that the i th feature was a random draw from B( 5) . Although each class is defined by a distinct set of shape parameters of the beta distribution, these are not guaranteed to be substantially different, as they are drawn from the same uniform distribution. As a consequence of this and the limited number of features, the dataset is expected to produce a classification accuracy < 1 for in-distribution instances and potentially a high frequency of false positives for out-of-distribution data.",

False positives in out-of-distribution samples can be interpreted as a measure of the accuracy of a model in distinguishing known samples from unknowns. This is important when applying classifiers to datasets extending beyond the described classes used for training the model. For instance, with biological data such as the Influenza subtypes used here, the ability to identify unknowns can be a tool to identify samples representing new virus types or undescribed species.",

All models were trained on data belonging to classes 1 and 2. Dots and whiskers show the mean and 95% interval of label probabilities for each sample. For regular NNs, we report the probability of a class resulting from the SoftMax function at the output layer. Gray shaded areas indicate out-of-distribution instances belonging to the third class. , and false positive rates for out-of-distribution data (c). The results are shown for BNNs with four priors (Uniform, Normal, truncated-Cauchy, and Laplace (color-coded as in Fig. 1 ) and an NN with MC dropout (dropout rate = 0.01). For each model we summarized the results of 10 independent runs, trained on a different random subset of 10 of the total 20 classes, and the whiskers show the range of values derived from these 10 subsets. Figure 6 : Empirical prior probabilities of the 5 training classes across all instances within one of the 10 resampled virus datasets, obtained under four priors: Uniform, Normal, truncated-Cauchy, and Laplace. These plots show that all tested prior distributions applied to the BNN parameters result in unbalanced prior probabilities for the classes, although these probabilities are consistent among the 500 instances within the dataset. To produce these values, we ran an MCMC sampling the weights from their prior distributions. We then used the resulting models to predict labels for each sample (same as Fig. 3 ) and plotted the histograms of the resulting label probabilities of each class. ",
