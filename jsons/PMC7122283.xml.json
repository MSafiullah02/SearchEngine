            "text": "\nStrongyloides stercoralis, an intestinal nematode commonly known as the human threadworm, affects millions of people worldwide.1 It is endemic in Southeast Asia, Latin America, sub-Saharan Africa, and parts of the southeastern USA.2 In the USA, the highest prevalence rates are found in eastern Kentucky and rural Tennessee. A unique feature of Strongyloides stercoralis infection is the occurrence of an autoinfection cycle which permits persistence of the parasite years after the normal host has left an endemic area. In this cycle, the rhabditiform larvae in the duodenojujenal portion of the small intestine transform directly into filariform (infective) larvae. The filariform larvae without leaving the body can reinfect the patient by penetrating the intestinal mucosa. This distinctive characteristic of Strongyloides, to persist and replicate within the host for decades, produces minimal or no symptoms. Immunocompromised patients may develop a fulminant illness due to a unique process in the life cycle of Strongyloides in which there are dramatic increases in the number of filariform larvae. In the hyperinfection syndrome, massive numbers of larvae migrate through the intestinal mucosa and into the lungs (the usual migration pattern) and disseminate to involve other organ systems not ordinarily a part of the life cycle of the parasite. Larvae may be found in the central nervous system, kidneys, liver, and almost any other organ.",

Immunosuppressive regimens including cyclosporine for organ transplant recipients have been reported to have a decreased incidence of hyperinfection Strongyloides. This has been attributed to the anti-helminthic properties cyclosporine demonstrated in mouse models.5 Organ transplant recipients can develop hyperinfection syndrome from endogeneous reactivation and by acquisition of Strongyloides from the transplanted organ and obligatory immunosuppression.6\n",

            "text": "The vascular distribution of the lesions of hyperinfection Strongyloides closely parallels that of the caput medusa seen in chronic liver disease with portal hypertension. In that setting, increased portal pressure leads to retrograde flow through the periumbilical portosystemic anastomoses. The patients reported with periumbilical purpura had been placed on respirators before the development of their skin lesions. Positive pressure ventilation produces a rise in portal pressure. It is hypothesized that numerous larvae leave the host\u2019s bowel through the superior and inferior mesenteric veins entering the liver. Patients receiving respiratory assistance have transient rises in portal pressure, shunting portal blood through the periumbilical portal systemic shunt. This blood carries numerous larvae that, on reaching the dermal vascular plexus, cause extravasation of red blood cells.9 A subtle case of two faint periumbilical purpuric patches was seen by one of the authors in a patient with mild gastrointestinal and pulmonary symptoms who was not on mechanical ventilation. Skin biopsy revealed the filariform larvae of Strongyloides supporting the hypothesis that while the larvae may migrate through the skin during hyperinfection, positive pressure mechanical ventilation is required to produce the classically described periumbilical thumbprint purpura. A 25-year-old Mexican man with acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) (CD4 count 70) was hospitalized with GI complaints, weight loss, and numerous 2\u20133 mm purpuric \u00adpapules on his abdomen. Skin biopsy demonstrated filariform larvae of Strongyloides.13\n",
