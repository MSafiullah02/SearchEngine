This outbreak shows us the urgent need to control this disease. Considering that several attempts are ongoing to design proper vaccines and monoclonal antibodies against SARS-CoV-2, some other investigational treatments based on natural products that affect SARS-CoV-2 cell invasion and replication might be studied [2,3]. It is known that herpesvirus (double-stranded enveloped DNA viruses) diseases are contagious and have become a global concern due to their immense threat to public health [4]. These pathogens induce latent and lytic infections in humans and animals [5]. As observed with all viruses, herpesviruses and SARS-CoV-2 share the same characteristic in which host receptor recognition is an essential step for viral infection. Therefore, targeting these receptors could be a valuable approach for designing effective antiviral drugs [6,7].",

In a recent study that has been published in the journal Antiviral Research, two natural alkaloid type compounds with notable anti-herpesvirus properties (homoharringtonine and emetine; Figure 1) were detected for their ability to effectively inhibit the replication of SARS-CoV-2 in vitro with EC50 (50% effective concentration) values of 2.55 and 0.46 \u00b5M, respectively [10]. However, the study did not disclose the mechanisms by which both compounds induced anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity. On the other hand, such outcomes might open the door to further investigations to optimize and design these compounds as effective drugs to combat COVID-19. ",
