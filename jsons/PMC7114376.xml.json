            "text": "Influenza A (H1N1) virus infections can cause severe acute lung injury leading to significant morbidity and mortality (Carmona et al., 2011, Glezen, 1982, Kasowski et al., 2011). The renin-angiotensin system (RAS) plays a key role in pathogenesis of acute lung injury (Jerng et al., 2007, Kuba et al., 2006, Marshall et al., 2004). Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), a negative regulator of the RAS, protects against acute lung injury in several animal models of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) (He et al., 2007, Imai et al., 2005, Li et al., 2008b). ACE2 was identified as a functional receptor for the SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV), and mediated efficient virus replication (Hamming et al., 2004, Li et al., 2004, Li et al., 2003, Li et al., 2005). ACE2 expression was markedly downregulated in acute lung injury of mice caused by infection with SARS-CoV. The virus replication was effective in ACE2-transfected 293T cells, but could be blocked by anti-ACE2 antibodies on Vero E6 cells (Li et al., 2003). However, little is known about the mechanism of ACE2 in pathogenesis of influenza-induced acute lung injury. If ACE2 expression levels were altered after influenza virus infection has not been confirmed yet.",

ACE2 protein downregulation was most likely related to ACE2 protein degradation by proteasome pathway rather than ACE2 shedding. Further, we put forward a mechanism of ACE2 cleavage by influenza neuraminidase (NA) different from proteolytic cleavage of ACE2 by sheddase.",

The cell lysates were obtained at 12 hpi and 24 hpi, and then ACE2 protein levels were detected by Western blotting. The results showed that ACE2 was decreased after infection with two strains in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 1a and b). ACE2 protein levels showed clear decline at a high moi of 5 at 24 hpi. The decline of ACE2 protein levels was also observed in 293T-ACE2 infected with either PR8 or CA07 viruses (Fig. 1d). Further, ACE2 protein levels in CNE-2Z cells were examined by flow cytometry. The fluorescence intensity of ACE2 was decreased after PR8 infection at 24hpi (Fig. 1c). Then, the ACE2 mRNA levels in CNE-2Z cells were analyzed by real-time PCR; However, the ACE2 mRNA level was not altered after PR8 infection compared with mock-infected cells (Fig. 1e), and as a control, there was hardly any ACE2 mRNA expression in A549 cell lines. These results suggested that influenza virus infection downregulated ACE2 protein levels.",

But whether NA protein could cleave other proteins is still not clear. So, we cannot confirm the specificity of ACE2 protein cleavage by NA. Whether or not ACE2 levels were regulated by other proteins of influenza virions has not been confirmed yet. NA is a glycosidase that specifically promotes the cleavage of sialic acid from glycoprotein saccharide chains (Suttajit and Winzler, 1971). Whether NA catalyzed the hydrolysis of glycosidic linkages of ACE2 proteins are yet to be identified.",

It has been reported that ACE2 was implicated in hypertension, cardiac function and diabetes (Clarke and Turner, 2012, Hamming et al., 2007). In mouse models of lung failure induced by acid aspriration or sepsis, ACE2 deficiency worsens acute lung injury (Imai et al., 2005). However, the regulation of ACE2 protein in influenza-induced lung injury has not been reported yet. In our study, ACE2 proteins can be reduced by influenza virions in vitro, and also by transient expression of NA proteins in cells. But whether a similar effect of ACE2 downregulation could be detected in influenza virus infected mouse models has not been confirmed yet. We think that it is very essential to figure out the meaning of ACE2 cleavage in pathogenesis and the effect of ACE2 deficiency in pathogenesis of influenza-induced acute lung injury in the future.",
