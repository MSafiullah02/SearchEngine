The comprehensive functions of this MES were analyzed in detail and were applied in Shanghai Iron and Steel Company. In terms of PLM and MES integration, due to the large differences in the integrated data format, source, scale, etc., Anis [4] proposed to integrate a product design, manufacturing system hardware data, and real-time data generated in the production process to design an intermediary system that resolves syntactic and semantic conflicts. In the integration of various functions within the MES, Jeon [8] introduced a design method of advanced MES (i.e., intelligent MES), by establishing a collaboration mechanism of MES internal functions. It supported the functions improvement and auxiliary management decision-making capability of the MES in data collection and analysis. Anyway, it only analyzed its feasibility by simulation based on the established TO-BE scenario model and AS-IS model.",

For example, Novak [6] believes that intelligent manufacturing systems can use a five-layer pyramid to describe an automated system structure. To support dynamic production scheduling, provide the flexibility of intelligent manufacturing systems, and reduce response time, it presented a way to integrate a production planning and scheduling module within MES. However, the levels and integration methods of software such as DNC/CAPP are not concerned. Cai [7] aimed at the integration of the distributed manufacturing services in virtual factories, and adopted the ontology and constraint-based distributed manufacturing service modeling methods to develop a prototype of the semantic Web system of ManuHub (i.e., Manufacturing Center), which provides a friendly graphical user interface to search for the required services and get the semantic annotations for the manufacturing assets services. Ghielmini [9] and Mourtzis [10] believes that the existing ICT solutions have low interoperability in supporting the distributed manufacturing assets integration for small and medium enterprises. Therefore, they proposed a virtual factory framework (VFF) to solve this problem, including semantic shared data models, virtual factory managers (VFM), and so on. Mourtzis [11] proposed an integrated quality monitoring method to support cloud manufacturing in virtual factories. Iarovyi [12] proposed an open, knowledge-driven MES architecture by adopting the base-of-breed method, which can effectively support MES to intelligently expand functions and performance, improve MES application quality, and reduce configuration costs and system downtime.",

(3) The CAPP system sends the products manufacturing methods, processes, and the required types of manufacturing assets (such as machine tools and equipment, etc.) to the MES, i.e., how the products are processed, the processing steps and their operations and the required processes equipment (e.g., tools, fixtures, gauges, and accessories, etc.). (4) MES will feedback on the execution status of the parts processing to CAPP so that the process planners can refer to the execution information of the process task when they design new manufacturing processes or execute processes change design. (5) The MES sends the CNC machining instructions in the CAM to the DNC system according to the production plan, and then the DNC system downloads the cutting program to the CNC machine. (6) DNC needs to feedback the equipment information to the MES (information of the parts being processed by the machine tool, processing status, processing start time and estimated end time). (7) The MES sends the materials and quantity information of the currently processed parts to the WMS. After the processing is completed, it is stored in the warehouse and the completed part information is entered into WMS/ERP. (8) MES interacts with SCADA. On the one hand, when the MES is scheduled for production, it is necessary to obtain the status of manufacturing assets from SCADA (whether the equipment is normal, whether the operators are on the job, whether the inventory is sufficient, etc.), and pass the processing parameters to the processing equipment and testing equipment; on the other hand, MES sends statistical analysis data of workshop equipment to the SACADA and then the management staff can access the information by graphical viewing tools.",
