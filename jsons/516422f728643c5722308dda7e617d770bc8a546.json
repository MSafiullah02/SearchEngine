Here we 23 provide prospective evidence of a change in depressive symptomatology of Italian students during 24 COVID-19-related lockdown. 25 The study was approved by the University of Padova Ethical Committee of Psychology and 26 participants provided informed consent. Between October 3 rd and October 23 rd 2019, we introduced 27 the study to approximately 1000 University of Padova students, 153 of which matched target 28 population characteristics (Italian native speaker students, age 18-30) and completed a demographic 29 questionnaire and the Italian version of Beck Depression Inventory-2 4 (BDI-2, a validated self-30 report questionnaire for depressive symptoms evaluation, the score of which correlates with severity 31 of depressive symptomatology) online 5 , both in October and in April (between 3 rd -23 rd ) 2020. We 32 implemented generalised linear mixed models to evince if BDI-2 score changed during isolation 33 with respect to the scores reported 6 months before. To assess a percentage change in BDI-2 score, 34 we defined %\u0394BDI-2 as the difference between BDI-2 score during lockdown and before 35 lockdown, the whole divided by BDI-2 score before lockdown + 1 and analysed %\u0394BDI-2 with 36 linear mixed-effects models.

We 41 recorded that the median percentage increase is higher in males (+36%; IQR = -12 -91%) than in 42 females (+16%; -26 -89%) and is independent from a history of mental disorder (Figure, B) , 43 although students with such history report higher before and during lockdown BDI-2 scores than 44 students without any established diagnosis of psychopathology ( Figure, C and Table) . This increase 45 is not significantly linked to sex, familiarity for a mental disorder, worry for one's economic 46 situation, or residence. Statistically, it is significantly linked to BDI-2 score before lockdown 47 (Figure, D) and age, evidencing that younger participants with lower BDI-2 score before lockdown 48 report higher percentage increases in BDI-2 score during lockdown. To assess if such increase 49 could be clinically relevant, we divided participants into three clinically useful categories according 50 to BDI-2 scores before lockdown (below 90 th percentile, above 95 th percentile, and between these 51 two ranges 4 ) and tested how many participants switched from one category to another, or remained 52 in the same one during lockdown. We fit the observed data to a multinomial regression model and 53 found that a median increase of 22% in BDI-2 score (IQR= -21 -90%) would not clinically affect 54 79,2% of our target population (IQR = 74,7 -81,4%); 8,2% (6,9 -9,8%) would progress to a more 55 serious clinical category (either from < 90 th to 90 th -95 th range or from this latter to > 95 th ); and 6,2% 56 (5,3 -7,2%) would directly progress from < 90 th percentile category to the most severe clinical 57 category ( Figure, E and F) .
