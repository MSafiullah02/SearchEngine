The risk classification tool was developed using retrospective data from all COVID-19 patients that were diagnosed until April 1 st , 2020 in a large healthcare organization (\"training set\"). The developed tool combines 10 risk factors using simple summation, and defines three risk levels according to the patient's age and number of accumulated risk points -basic risk, high risk and very-high risk (the last two levels are also considered together as the elevated risk group). The tool's performance in accurately identifying individuals at risk was evaluated using a \"temporal test set\" of COVID-19 patients diagnosed between April 2 nd and April 22 nd , 2020, later than those used for model development. The tool's performance was also compared to that of the CDC's criteria. The healthcare organization's general population was used to evaluate the proportion of patients that would be classified to each of the model's risk levels and as elevated risk by the CDC criteria.",

The model's ability to further divide the elevated risk population into two markedly different subgroups allows providing more refined recommendations to the general public and limiting the restrictions of social distancing to a smaller and more manageable subset of the population.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) put forth a list of criteria to define people at high risk for severe COVID-19 disease. This list includes those 65 years of age and older, those who live in nursing homes or long-term care facilities, and those who meet at least one of a long list of clinical criteria 2 .

Based on a heatmap that considered the interaction between the chosen age categories and the number of points (Figure 2b ) with the predefined thresholds for the risk levels detailed above, the final cutoff points for each risk level were defined ( Figure 2c) . Figure 3 presents a summary of the final model; Patients of any age with four or more risk points, patients aged 50-69 years with 2 or more risk points and patients over the age of 70 years with 0-3 risk points were classified as the high-risk group. Patients over the age of 70 years with 4 or more risk points were classified as the very-high risk group. All other patients were classified as the basic risk group. According to this model, a total of 35.4% of the entire CHS population (50.4% over the age of 20) will be classified as elevated risk by the CDC criteria, compared to 18.0% (27.6% over the age of 20) using the score-based model (considering the very-high and high risk groups combined) ( Table 2) . Among the 2,624 lab-confirmed COVID-19 patients in the temporal test set (Table 1 ), a total of 96.3% (95% CI: 91.6-98.8%) and 91.9% (95% CI: 85.9-95.9%) of the 122 patients with the composite outcome were correctly identified as elevated risk (sensitivity) by the CDC criteria and score-based model, respectively (Table 2 ). In addition, of those who would have been classified as elevated risk by the CDC criteria and by the model, a total of 13.1% (95% CI: 11.0-15.3%) and 19.6% (95% CI: 16.5-22.9%) would have suffered severe COVID-19 or death, respectively. Both models identified all death cases as elevated risk.",

The model performs well, correctly identifying 92% of patients who will experience a severe COVID-19 infection or death as having an elevated risk, while only classifying 18% of the total population as such.

On average, 33% of the patients defined as very-high risk will have severe illness if infected, and 21% will die. The high risk group is considerably larger, and captures 49% of all severely ill patients, and these patients have a 15% risk on average to be severely ill, and 7% risk of mortality. This division of the elevated risk population into two markedly different subgroups, allows health authorities to provide more refined recommendations, and to limit more restrictive social distancing recommendations to a smaller and more manageable subset of the population (Figure 3) .",

These guidelines refine the social distancing recommendation to be based on three axes (as depicted in Figure 3 ). The first axis considers the individual's risk of severe disease if infected, which is provided by the score-based model. This risk should be considered in light of the temporospatial level of disease dissemination (the second axis); In Israel, the MOH designed a method to define \"red\" areas based on the level and trend of positive test results. In this way, individuals can easily consider the disease activity in their area and integrate this factor into their personal risk management. Finally, individual risk management should also take into account a person's pattern of activities and their associated likelihood of contact with infected individuals (the third axis). High risk professions such as school-teachers and high risk activities such as providing medical care should be considered in a different manner. Conveying a complicated message such as individual risk management based on three axes to the general public is challenging but necessary. Figure 3 was constructed as a visual aid to educate the general public on how to perform this individual risk management themselves, taking location, day and specific activity into account.",

The choice to assign each hospital admission a separate point was made for three reasons -first, this variable was found to be highly indicative of high risk when considering thousands of candidate variables 3 ; second, its value reflects the severity of the other chronic conditions that were uniformly assigned a single point, thus compensating to some extent for not accounting for the variability of these conditions' risk level; and third, it sometimes stands for rarer conditions that were not included as specific risk factors in the model.",

Also, the nomogram's complexity is more suitable for medical staff than for lay people. Unlike these models, the point-based model suggested in this study is meant to help decide on risk mitigation strategies prior to contracting SARS-CoV-2.

This was used to select age groups. Figure 2B shows a heatmap of the outcome rates in groups of ages (as selected using figure 2A ) and according to the number of points. This was used to select the final risk groups. Figure 2C shows a collapsed heatmap, with the eventual groups selected. In each case, the guiding principle was to group cells with similar outcome rates together. The colored outlines and the dividing lines represent the eventual groupings made.
