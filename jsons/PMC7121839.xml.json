            "text": "Definitions of One Health have varied among different authors and institutions, but a defining central tenet is that a One Health approach brings a holistic understanding of health. This broader view includes human medicine, veterinary medicine, and an understanding of the ecological context of health (which we call \u2018Ecohealth\u2019). To date, One Health approaches have tended to focus on closer collaboration among veterinarians and medical professionals, but remain unclear about how ecological approaches could be applied or how they might benefit public health and disease control. In this chapter, we review ecological concepts, and discuss their relevance to health, with an emphasis on infectious diseases, notably emerging infectious diseases (EIDs). Nearly two-thirds of EIDs are zoonotic, and a majority of those (72 %) originate in wildlife (Anderson et al. 2004; Cleaveland et al. 2001; Daszak 2000). Diseases are considered \u2018emerging\u2019 if they are identified as occurring in a new geographic area, expanding their incidence rapidly, displaying novel genetic code, or moving into humans for the first time. The most important are pandemics, those that become established in humans and spread internationally. Pandemics tend to be zoonotic, foodborne, or antimicrobial resistant pathogens, and their emergence and spread is overwhelmingly a result of changes in human demography (e.g. travel, population growth), behavior (e.g. drug use), economic activity (e.g. agricultural intensification), or anthropogenic changes to the environment (e.g. land-use change, climate change) (Weiss and McMichael 2004; Jones et al. 2008). The interactions among these underlying drivers and the dynamics of pathogens in wildlife, livestock, and people are a key focus of studies of the ecology of infectious diseases.",

While originally a descriptive science, the theories of adaptation, evolution, and speciation rapidly became central to the field, and led to increasingly analytical approaches (Lawton 1999). Over the past few decades, ecologists have analyzed data from field observations, laboratory studies, and large-scale field experiments to describe the structure and dynamics of populations, their interactions within communities, and the complexity of ecosystems. In this chapter, we build on the work of Wilcox and Jessop (2010) and Last (1998), adding an ecosystem network perspective to describe how ecological approaches can be focused on infectious diseases.",

Population ecology is the study of the population dynamics of a species with relevant metrics of density, natality, mortality, immigration, and emigration (Hall 1988; Murray 1999). Population dynamics are generated through competition, predation, parasitism, and the distribution of species. Community ecology describes the clustering of populations of species into communities and the processes that dictate composition and diversity. Pertinent community metrics are similarity, continuity, species, and genetic diversity. Ecosystem ecology is the study of biotic and abiotic components of ecological systems, their biophysical interactions, and the flow of energy and materials (Lindeman 1942; Odum 1969; Cook 1977). The metrics for ecosystems include state, rates, and productivity. Ecosystems provide the framework for organization of species and resource compartments, and modulate rates and dynamics of functions, processes, and services.",

Rarely are they stable or at equilibrium, as described by static representations of food chains, trophic guilds, and species dominance. Moreover, they demonstrate non-equilibrium dynamics in a mosaic of patches shifting among stable states when disturbed.

Indeed, a community approach to disease emergence can reveal important nodes and interactions that differ from those identified in population analyses. For example, some nodes, such as keystone species, may be disproportionally important to the system due to strong connectivity or high centrality. Superspreaders are highly connected and rapidly disseminate disease through a network. Identifying and monitoring the keystone species, superspreaders, and nodes that regulate host and vector abundance is important in disease prevention and control.",

Thus, it is difficult to draw meaningful comparisons among food webs. What is required is a method that generalizes models and captures topological position and functional importance of networks without a food web-specific bias (Olff et al. 2009).

Bioaccumulation of toxins throughout food webs poses a health threat, an example of which is dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT), effective in controlling disease vectors but endangering animal and human health by its bioconcentration. Ecosystems provide services such as sequestering toxins in wetlands and sediments, but these processes often are fragile and their disruption results in system-wide impacts. Nutrient enrichment, or eutrophication, of lakes has been directly correlated with prevalence of aquatic disease agents (Johnson and Carpenter 2008). Regulation of disease is an indirect ecosystem service.

The single predator\u2013prey dynamic is unique in its simplicity and is one of the longest studied. The system has never achieved equilibrium and cannot be explained either by top-down control of moose abundance by wolf predation or bottom-up control of wolf abundance by moose availability (Vucetich et al. 2011). Moreover, the system exhibits both influences, with episodic disturbances from disease and climate. The introduction of parvovirus by a domestic dog caused the wolf population to crash in 1980. Subsequently, the moose population exploded which impacted balsam fir, their winter food. Consequently, in 1996 the moose population crashed during a harsh winter. Moose are mega-herbivores (Owen-Smith 1988) that grow sufficiently large to escape predation from wolves, so wolves are only able to prey on the young and infirm. The moose are vulnerable to ticks, which contributes to poor body condition and makes them more vulnerable to wolf predation. Ultimately, the dynamics of an invasive disease agent influenced community structure, as did predation, resource availability, parasitism, abiotic conditions, and genetic diversity. These events challenged the certainty of predictive models of population dynamics and community structure. This case study illustrates the difficulty of modeling EIDs in relation to ecosystem dynamics.",

The annual bimodal peaks of cholera in Bangladesh (Spring and Fall) correlated with plankton blooms in the spring and fall, with copepods proving to be a vector for V. cholerae (de Magny et al. 2008). Further studies, employing satellite remote sensing to monitor chlorophyll, sea surface temperature, and sea surface height in the Bay of Bengal, provided useful models of the relationship of cholera and climate (Lobitz et al. 2000).

Pathogens such as Nipah virus (NiV), SARS coronavirus, and Ebola virus originate in wildlife species from tropical or subtropical regions, where human population density is high, and rapid changes to the environment drive increasing risk of spillover.

Unfortunately, studies tend to view the role of wildlife as a risk factor for spillover and rarely involve detailed studies of wildlife population dynamics. For example, fruit bats were identified as the reservoir of Nipah virus (NiV) in Malaysia and are, therefore, a risk factor for its emergence elsewhere. In Malaysia, NiV first emerged in pig farms close to fruit bat habitats. It was hypothesized that the intensive nature of the farms were the trigger for its emergence (Chua et al. 2000). An alternative hypothesis was that bats brought the virus into the country from nearby Sumatra following forest fires there during a severe El Nino event (Chua et al. 2002). A collaborative group including wildlife biologists, veterinarians, virologists, mathematical modelers, physicians, and epidemiologists collected and analyzed data on the hunting of bats, pig population dynamics at the index farm, large-scale movement of fruit bats and the capacity of the virus to survive in urine, saliva, and fruit juices (Pulliam et al. 2011). This work was able to demonstrate that the continued presence of bats in the index farm region, and the particular dynamics of intensive production allowed the virus to invade the pig farm, produce a partially immune population of pigs, then re-invade to create a long-term exposure of pig workers, and the large-scale outbreak observed (Pulliam et al. 2011).",

Subsequent investigations involved wildlife biologists who used infrared cameras to confirm contamination in the field (Khan et al. 2011), and conducted longitudinal surveillance of bat populations to examine whether seasonal patterns exist that could be used to estimate risk. These studies demonstrate the value of analyzing wildlife reservoir ecology in tandem with epidemiological and specific disease investigations. Such an approach will become increasingly important, given the disproportionate rise in EIDs originating from wildlife over the last few decades (Jones et al. 2008).",
