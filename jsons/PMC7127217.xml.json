Replication and transcription of the BDV genome occur in the cell nucleus. The genome size is 8.9 kb, which makes it the smallest of all known negative-stranded RNA viruses [19], [20]. The organization of the six open reading frames (ORFs) is similar to that of other Mononegaviruses [20]. Based on their positions in the viral genome (3\u2032-N\u2013X\u2013P\u2013M\u2013G\u2013L-5\u2032) and the features of the corresponding amino acid sequences, these polypeptides are counterparts of the nucleoprotein (N), phosphoprotein (P), matrix protein (M), surface glycoprotein (G) and polymerase (L), respectively, which are also found in other negative-stranded RNA viruses [21]. Negative-stranded RNA viruses initiate infection by introducing their genetic material in the form of ribonucleoprotein complexes into host cells. These complexes, which consist of the single-stranded RNA genome associated with the RNA-binding protein N, the polymerase cofactor P and the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase L, are transcriptionally active and direct the synthesis of viral mRNAs [22]. Both the composition and stoichiometry of the nucleocapsid N and P are involved in the regulation of the BDV multiplication cycle [23], [24], [25].",

For instance, increased protein content and mononuclear pleocytosis may be seen in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) due to meningoencephalitis. However, these findings are not specific for BD, rather represent non-specific indicators for viral meningoencephalitis [26]. BDV-specific antibodies in serum and or CSF are considered useful indicators, but post-mortem confirmation by histological and immunohistochemical analysis of brain tissues is required. Histologically, variable degrees of encephalitis are observed with BD [27], [28], [29], characterized by disseminated mononuclear polioencephalomyelitis, with subsequent neuronal degeneration and meningitis. Usually, areas of the limbic system, particularly the hippocampal formation, are involved, whereas the brain stem and cerebellum remain relatively unaffected [28]. Immunohistochemical analyses of paraffin-embedded brain sections using monoclonal antibodies to the major BDV antigens P38/40 (N) and P24 (P) have shown consistently that virus-infected cells are not uniformly distributed in brains from diseased animals and that antigen-positive neurons are detected most frequently in the hippocampus [3], [27], [28].",

Serological assays, such as the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) [30], and molecular methods based on nucleic acid hybridization [31] or on the PCR have been evaluated for the detection of viral transcripts [2], [26], [30], [31], [32], [33]. For example, highly sensitive conventional PCR assays have been developed for the detection of BDV in unfixed or formalin-fixed brain tissue [2], [32], [33]. While presently these PCRs are useful, they have the disadvantage that it is a \u2018nested\u2019 assay [33] and, for routine application, is thus prone to cross-contamination problems during the conduct of the procedure. Therefore, laboratory diagnosis, relying exclusively on RT-nested PCR results should be evaluated and appraised with caution [5]. To overcome this limitation, the present study established a rapid and effective reverse-transcription, real-time PCR for the detection and quantification of the nucleoprotein (P38/40) and the phosphoprotein (P24) transcripts of BDV in brain tissue samples from sheep and horses with BD. Furthermore, highly sensitive and specific BDV-assays are important for the detection of inapparently infected animals and epidemiological studies regarding possible vectors.",

As negative controls, brain samples from two healthy, assumingly uninfected animals (one sheep and one horse) were also collected. From one-half of the brain, tissue samples (1 cm3) were collected using a scalpel, stored in Petri dishes at \u221220 \u00b0C or \u221270 \u00b0C.

The viral RNA loads in the different brain regions for the three horses (Fig. 3\n) were comparable to the loads detected in sheep. Again, a higher load was detected for p24 compared with p40. In one BDV-positive horse (S00-0913), the BDV loads in the cortex and hippocampus were greater than in the cerebellum, supporting the trend for sheep. For the other two, lobus piriformis showed similar (S96-0868) or even higher (S99-0598) BDV loads compared with cortex or hippocampus, which may be explained by the lobus piriformis (belonging to the bulbus olfactorius) proposed to being the host entry point for the virus [36], [37].",

Relative quantification was achieved by using the signal from 18S rRNA as a calibrator for the amount of extracted cells in the assay. The primer and probe sequences for p40 and p24, respectively, were designed based on the sequences of four BDV strains, namely Borna V, Borna HE/80, Borna H1766 and Borna No/98 [18], [38], [39], [40].",

The brain sites cortex and hippocampal formation were chosen according to the predilection sites of BDV in the brain. As expected, the relative virus loads in cortex and hippocampus were higher than in the cerebellum, which is usually also less affected by the infection [28], [29], [41], [42]. Interestingly, the relative virus load in lobus piriformis was similar to that of the hippocampal formation. The data obtained by the PCR correlated, on a qualitative level, with the immunohistochemical findings of higher virus load in cortex and hippocampus compared to the cerebellum [28], [29], [41], [42]. However, since different dilutions of the monoclonal antibodies had to be used for optimal immune staining, the viral protein loads (P38/40 and P24) could not be directly compared between signals arising from the anti-P24 monoclonal antibody or the anti-P38/40 monoclonal antibody, respectively. However, comparison between signals from the same tool in different locations in the brain was possible. Immunohistology gives a representation about the local distribution of infected cells in the present section, whereas our newly established methods give the average of template copies in a specific sample relative to the amount of cells used for extraction. Finally, the variation in stability of BDV antigens and RNA in formaldehyde fixed or frozen tissue has to be considered as an unreliable factor. For these reasons, consistent quantitative correlations between immunohistology and quantitative RT-PCR could not be expected.",

While varying BDV RNA loads were detected in individuals and in different brain areas, the loads associated with p24 were consistently greater than those linked to the p40 locus. A hallmark of the virus producing (productive) infection of cells with members of the Mononegavirales consists of the formation of a gradient of mRNAs with synthesis of the highest copy number of mRNA at the 3\u2032-end of the negative sense genomic RNA, followed by increasingly attenuated mRNA synthesis towards the other end of the genome [46]. It had been expected that, similar to infected cell cultures, an equal or even greater number of p40 targets would be present in productively infected cells of patient tissue. Indeed, studies have demonstrated that BDV replication is optimal when P38/40 antigen was in a 30-fold excess compared with P24 [23], [24], [25].",

A technical explanation may be that p24 targets were reverse transcribed at greater efficiency than p40 targets, although, due to the opposing observation in cell culture extracts, it seems more plausible that more p24 than p40 targets were present in those samples. Indeed, we did not use in vitro transcribed RNA to compare the efficiency of individual cDNA synthesis in our system. However, Watanabe and others made the same observation in BDV-infected neonatal gerbils [47]. Interestingly, both the p24 mRNA and the P24 protein were more abundant than their p40 and P38/40 counterparts in diseased gerbils as opposed to healthy gerbils infected with the same dose of BDV. Together, these two independent observations suggest that the amount of p24 mRNA could be used as a marker for the progression of disease and that the gerbil model reflects the situation in the natural host. Diagnostically, these observations suggest that detection of the p24 target is the more sensitive tool for routine applications with patient materials.",

Extracts from triplicate samples of different brain sites of three different BDV-diseased sheep (S03-0057, S02-1736 and S99-1356) were subjected to reverse transcription and real-time PCR. Box plots are shown, representing maximal, average, median, and minimal numbers of BDV-specific template detected. The signals of the BDV-specific amplifications are expressed as arbitrary units (y-axis) relative to the 18S rRNA signal, which normalizes the total number of cells in the assay. Amplifications for p40 and p24 were done simultaneously, using the same volume of the same template. The threshold for both primers was 0.005. x-axis: brain sites and PCR system; y-axis: relative BDV copy number.",
