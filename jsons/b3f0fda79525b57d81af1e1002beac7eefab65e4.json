A score of 10 or greater 130 represents a reasonable cut point for identifying cases of anxiety with a sensitivity of 89% and 131 specificity 82%, internal consistency (Cronbach \u03b1=.92) and Test-retest reliability (intraclass 132 correlation=0.83) [14] . The GAD-7 has also been identified as a screener for panic disorder, social 133 phobia and PTSD ( with a cutoff score of 8 sensitivity 77% and specificity 82%) [15] . In our study, 134 the GAD-7 score was totaled for each student and classified into cut-off points of (0-4 minimal, 5-135 9 mild, 10-14 moderate and 15-21 severe) levels of anxiety. Levels of anxiety were measured using 136 the GAD-7 scale at three different time points. In addition to calculating the mean GAD-7 score, 137 scores were classified into 3 categories (minimal, mild and moderate/severe anxiety).",

What makes this 280 study unique, is that medical and non-medical students were compared, and within the medical 281 student group, we compared medical and dental students. Furthermore, this study assessed anxiety 282 levels at three different time points: during hospital visits for medical and dental students, before 283 online learning and after switching to the online learning for all students. Among the 284 medical/dental group, students in their clinical phase of study and who had rotations in high risk 285 wards or who had been in contact with COVID-19 patients reported significantly higher (moderate 286 to severe) levels of anxiety, demonstrating that high risk perception of COVID-19 may contribute 287 to higher levels of anxiety. Medical/dental students continued attending the hospitals at the early 288 onset of COVID-19 when fear and worry associated with the outbreak would have been at their 289 peak and before lockdown restrictions were in place, which could also explain their high 290 compliance with infection control measures.

This may be due To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to provide important information on the initial 331 response and anxiety levels in university students across the UAE immediately following the 332 period COVID-19 was declared a global pandemic. More than half of university students reported 333 mild to severe anxiety levels with a quarter of students reporting severe anxiety. Specifically, 334 medical students reported higher levels of anxiety during their clinical rotations which decreased 335 with the introduction of online learning, yet, non-medical student's anxiety levels increased with 336 online learning. The findings from our study can be used at the government and university level to 337 develop effective screening strategies and to formulate interventions that improve mental health 338 of students. Such strategies will reduce unnecessary stress and anxiety among university students, 339 .

The 242 impact of COVID-19 on university students is particularly burdensome due to the perceived effect 243 of the virus on their studies; and with medical students specifically it could be due to the 244 interdisciplinary nature of their training and the potential proximity of being exposed to the virus 245 during their clinical studies [17]246",

Compliance and 267 adherence with these restrictions has been found to differ amongst different age groups and 268 populations, with less acceptance of these restrictions being reported amongst younger age-groups 269 [27]. However, in our study, the majority of students did not consider the strict measures 270 undertaken by the healthcare authorities as dysfunctional or not required. The students were 271 worried about transmitting COVID-19 to their family members more than they were worried about 272 catching the virus themselves, therefore, indicating a beneficial sense of social responsibility 273 during such infectious disease outbreak.

Secondly, the nature of self-reported data in the survey may 324 lead to response biases specifically for hygienic practices where students may provide socially 325 desirable responses and self-reported levels of anxiety, stress and worry which may not always be 326 as accurate as being assessed by a mental health professional.
