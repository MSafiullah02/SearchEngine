According to the US National Health Interview Survey, rhinosinusitis affects approximately 1 in 7 adults yearly [1]. In children, upper respiratory infections are contracted on an average of 6\u20138 per year with 0.5\u20135 % of these subsequently developing acute rhinosinusitis [2]. Twenty million doctor visits annually in the United States contribute to the high healthcare utilization of people with rhinosinusitis [3]. Nearly 3 billion dollars per year in the United States are used for the treatment of rhinosinusitis, with the costs derived from medications, testing, procedures, and outpatient and emergency room visits [4, 5].",

Primary care physicians tend to make the diagnosis of acute bacterial rhinosinusitis clinically with little supportive objective criteria, and it is common to prescribe antibiotics as a first-line therapy in most cases. It has been estimated that antibiotics are initiated in up to 85\u201398 % of presumed rhinosinusitis cases [6, 7]. This contrasts with the fact that the majority of rhinosinusitis episodes are of viral origin and unrelated to a bacterial infection acutely. Nearly all cases of viral rhinosinusitis in an otherwise normal host will commonly resolve without antibiotic treatment provided the sinuses adequately drain once the virally induced inflammation resolves. If the disease has a nonbacterial inflammatory mechanism as the source of symptoms rather than a bacterial one, the addition of antibiotics will not be of benefit. In fact, the overuse of antibiotics will promote further bacterial resistance as well as increase the risk of the patient of the consequences of any adverse drug reaction. A major issue for healthcare providers in treating acute rhinosinusitis is when the initiation of antibiotic treatment will provide cost-effective clinical benefit.",

In children, the ethmoid and the maxillary sinuses form in utero [8], and the sphenoid sinuses are generally pneumatized by 5 years of age [8]. On the other hand, the frontal sinuses frequently do not appear till about 7\u20138 years of age and typically do not completely develop until late adolescence [8] (see 10.1007/978-1-4939-0265-1_2 for a more detailed discussion of the ontogeny of the sinuses). Pediatric guidelines describe acute bacterial rhinosinusitis as an infection of the paranasal sinuses lasting less than 30 days that presents with either persistent or severe symptoms of nasal or postnasal drainage, daytime cough, headache, facial pain, or some combination of these [8]. Persistent symptoms are those lasting longer than 10\u201314 days but less than 30 days [8]. Severe symptoms include a temperature of at least 39 \u00b0C and purulent nasal discharge which present concurrently for at least 3\u20134 consecutive days in an ill-appearing child [8].",

In contrast, fungi, when involved, can induce three variations of allergic inflammation: eosinophilic fungal rhinosinusitis, eosinophilic mucin rhinosinusitis, and allergic fungal rhinosinusitis. None of these represent acute infections. All refer to a rhinosinusitis state that is chronic (>12 weeks\u2019 duration) and accompanied by sinus opacification with allergic mucin [20] (see 10.1007/978-1-4939-0265-1_8 for a detailed discussion of fungal rhinosinusitis). Allergic rhinitis flares can be complicated by a superimposed acute fungal rhinosinusitis. However, none of these involve fungal invasion below the mucosal surface. Rather, they are symptomatic rhinosinusitis events that result from various atopic sensitizations. Despite more than 100,000 molds recognized in the environment, few genera are associated with allergic disease [20]. Aspergillus species and the dematiaceous molds that include Alternaria and Cladosporium species are those most frequently implicated, although Bipolaris and Curvularia species have also been reported [20].",

It should be remembered that chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) is a group of inflammatory diseases of the nasal cavities that may or may not include polyp formation with no unifying theory based on scientific evidence that will explain the pathophysiology of chronic airway disease in all cases. In contrast, the etiology appears to be multifactorial. Research has focused on alterations involving inflammatory cell and T-cell stimulation, the role of TGF-\u03b2 on remodeling, generation of inflammatory mediators such as leukotrienes and prostaglandins, the role of IgE and microorganisms, and also the role of the epithelium as an immunologic barrier to infection or insult. While much of the more recent literature appears to focus primarily on CRS as an inflammatory disease, that is not to say that bacteria and microorganisms are not involved in some cases and that antibiotics will not be helpful in alleviating some symptoms [21]. Bacteria have been shown to play a role in some patients with CRS either directly by infection or by stimulation of infection [22]. The main bacteria implicated in causing infection or triggering inflammation in patients with CRS, especially those with nasal polyps and asthma, is Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) [22]. In a recent study, swabs from the middle meatus of controls and patients with CRS were taken during endoscopic surgery and analyzed by quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR). There was no statistically significant difference in the total bacteria seen between CRS patients and the controls, but the abundance of S. aureus was increased in CRS patients with allergic rhinitis, nasal polyps, and asthma [22]. Nevertheless, the antibiotic approach to a CRS patient experiencing an acute flare of rhinosinusitis should include a drug choice directed against the same organisms defined above. Although there is no consensus on when or how long to treat flares of acute disease in CRS patients, the majority of medical providers would tend to use antibiotics earlier and sometimes longer than traditional guidelines suggest.",

In general, only 1\u20132 of every 100 otherwise healthy patients with sinus symptoms have a concomitant bacterial infection [23]. It is often difficult to distinguish between those who will recover spontaneously and those who will require antibiotic therapy. In many cases, there is no evidence of any infectious etiology (viral, bacterial, or fungal), and indeed the disease may be a manifestation of an inflammatory process rather than infection. Antibiotics would only have minimal to no benefit to these patients. It is therefore imperative to at least attempt to determine which patients will benefit from antibiotic therapy, so as to avoid unnecessary antibiotic use and potentiating the development of bacterial resistance.",

It can be prescribed daily and has bactericidal activity against the most common bacterial pathogens including Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, and Moraxella catarrhalis. Cefdinir is well tolerated and does not significantly suppress the normal gut flora causing less gastrointestinal adverse effects. Children have also been seen to favor cefdinir due to its taste and smell [25].",

However, first-generation antihistamines have been used in acute rhinosinusitis to combat nasal drainage. This is primarily due to the anticholinergic effect of these drugs, an activity that is mostly absent in second-generation drugs (loratadine, fexofenadine, cetirizine) that are also now available over the counter. First-generation antihistamines may cause overdrying of the nasal mucosa and thus lead to further discomfort limiting their usefulness [15]. On the other hand, antihistamines can be effective in atopic patients due to their antihistamine activity. Antihistamines block the H1 histamine receptor and have been demonstrated to be effective in patients with documented aeroallergen allergies. Basophils and mast cells are stimulated to release histamine by the binding of cell-bound IgE antibodies to the offending aeroallergen protein. Therefore, antihistamines only help the acute sinusitis patient when rhinorrhea, sneezing, nasal congestion, and nasal pruritus are associated with basophil and mast cell release of histamine. A recent Cochrane Review noted that there is no evidence supporting the routine use of antihistamines in the treatment of acute rhinosinusitis in children. For most patients, antihistamines will not significantly alleviate nasal congestion, rhinorrhea, or sneezing in patients with an upper respiratory infection [38]. Therefore, antihistamines should not be used in acute rhinosinusitis unless the patient has documented allergies to aeroallergens that are present during the time of the infection. Further research needs to be conducted [39].",

In a recent controlled prospective study, growth and pulmonary function in children was evaluated during long-term treatment with orally inhaled budesonide. The results were compared to children who were not treated with inhaled corticosteroids. The study showed that there were no statistically significant changes in growth velocity, weight gain, or lung development in those treated with inhaled budesonide as compared to those who were not [52]. One study on intranasal steroids showed that there is no growth suppression with 100 mg intranasal mometasone furoate once daily in children. Overall, there is much less data regarding the effects of intranasal corticosteroids on growth. However, since there is less systemic exposure with intranasal corticosteroids than orally inhaled corticosteroids used for asthma due to lower total dosing, the risk should be even smaller.",

Otolaryngologists tend to favor the use of oral corticosteroids to treat the severe nasal congestion and inflammation that is commonly associated with acute rhinosinusitis. Allergist/immunologists generally defer the use of oral corticosteroids to only the most severe circumstances because of potential side effects. They point out that side effects from even a short course can include aseptic necrosis of the hip, glaucoma, lower extremity edema, hypertension, mood swings, and weight gain. When oral steroids are used more chronically, the list expands to include cataracts, hyperglycemia, osteoporosis, adrenal suppression, thinning of the skin, an increased risk of infection, and, in children, reduction in growth velocity. Further clinical trials are needed to assess the risks/benefit relationship of treating acute rhinosinusitis with oral corticosteroids before this debate can be settled. In general, considering the side effect profile, the oral method of steroid administration should not be considered a first-line treatment of acute rhinosinusitis. Table 19.7 outlines the different classes of oral corticosteroids [54].\n",

It may be used to soften viscous secretions and improve mucociliary clearance. Evidence exists that saline nasal irrigation reduces the symptoms of chronic rhinosinusitis [63\u201367]. No clinical trials exist for the treatment of acute rhinosinusitis, but irrigation with nasal saline appears safe. Minor adverse effects can be avoided with modification of administration technique and adjustment of the saline concentration, and there have been no reports of serious adverse events. Nasal saline irrigation can be recommended as a supportive mode of treatment in acute rhinosinusitis.",

In two studies from Russia, Nasodren has been reported to be effective in the treatment of acute rhinosinusitis [68, 69]. The first study evaluated 50 patients with acute suppurative bacterial rhinosinusitis [68]. Half were treated with Nasodren, amoxicillin, and xylometazoline with the other half treated with only amoxicillin and xylometazoline for 8 days [68]. A higher proportion of patients receiving the Nasodren described their overall treatment as excellent. The treatment group also had a statistically significant increase in mucociliary transport time [68]. Another study evaluated 30 patients with acute rhinosinusitis treated with Nasodren alone [69]. All 30 patients received Nasodren monotherapy [69]. The study showed that for these patients with moderately severe acute rhinosinusitis, Nasodren alone ensured recovery in 73 % of cases by day 7 [69]. Based on these studies, Nasodren proved to be beneficial in relieving symptoms due to acute rhinosinusitis both as an adjunctive therapy and on its own. Sinupret \u00ae is an herbal medicinal product made from gentian root, primula flower, elder flower, sorrel herb, and verbena herb. It is frequently used as a complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) in the treatment of acute and chronic rhinosinusitis and URIs. Sinupret \u00ae was shown to have significant antiviral activity against many viruses including adenovirus C subtype 5, human rhinovirus B subtype 14, and RSV [70].",

A majority of cases of rhinosinusitis are caused by viral infections. The difficulty is defining when a case of acute rhinosinusitis is complicated by bacterial infection. Many guidelines have been developed to aid in the diagnosis of acute bacterial rhinosinusitis and to differentiate it from other nonbacterial causes. Most of the guidelines state severe persistent symptoms as the main reason to treat a patient with oral antibiotics. However, recent evidence has shown that even if a bacterial cause for the acute rhinosinusitis is suspected, antibiotic treatment may not promote a more rapid clearance of the bacteria from the sinuses or resolution of symptoms. When choosing to use antibiotics, the best choice in the ambulatory care setting is a drug that is beta lactamase resistant such as amoxicillin-clavulanate or a second-generation cephalosporin. Nasal rinsing with isotonic or hypertonic tepid saline is commonly beneficial and has been shown to hasten recovery. There is some data to support the use of topical nasal steroids and even short-course systemic corticosteroids for symptom relief although the side effect profile of this format of therapy clearly favors the topical application. Other adjunctive therapies such as antihistamines, decongestants, and mucolytics may be beneficial for symptomatic relief in selected cases, but few studies clearly show additional efficacy when used alone or in conjunction with antibiotics.",
