            "text": "In the urban metropolises of the Global South, informal transportation options such as minibuses, tuk-tuks, cyclos (trishaws) and motorbikes, with flexible fares, timetables, and routes enable those with limited financial means to access services and employment, and to move goods for themselves or small-scale businesses. With limited large-scale, planned transportation schemes, these alternatives are often the only means by which millions of people can travel on a daily basis, making a major contribution to urban mobility (Evans et al., 2018). Yet increasingly, such means of transportation are being seen as outdated and obsolete, failing to fit modern urban transportation ideals, with policies being implemented to restrict their operations (Eidse et al., 2016; Doherty, 2017; Sopranzetti, 2018). Such policies increase mobility injustice for lower socio-economic residents in Global South cities, as well as for the operators of these vehicles themselves (Evans et al., 2018). This paper focuses on such tensions in Hanoi, the capital of the Socialist Republic of Vietnam. In a city with a rapidly changing urban form, I examine the degree to which contemporary transportation plans and policies are creating mobility injustice for a specific category of road-users, the city's informal motorbike taxi drivers, locally known as xe \u00f4m (\u2018hug vehicle\u2019), and how these individuals attempt to adapt and respond.",

This was an initial step in a concerted drive by Vietnam's central government and Hanoi's municipal authorities to create a mega-city that would be prosperous, \u2018civilised and modern\u2019 (\u0111\u00f4 th\u1ecb v\u0103n minh, hi\u1ec7n \u0111\u1ea1i) (Coe, 2015). Yet while aiming for a population of over 10 million by 2030 \u2013 compared with 7.7 million in 2019 \u2013 the authorities also want Hanoi to be the world's first \u2018sustainable city\u2019. To meet this goal, and despite concerns raised by Vietnamese architects over the process, lack of local input, and design flaws, the \u2018Hanoi Capital Construction Master Plan to 2030 and Vision to 2050\u2019 was approved by the Prime Minister in July 2011 (Vietnamnet, 2009; Socialist Republic of Vietnam, 2011). Promoted by a slick advertising campaign, this plan was designed with foreign consultants from the US and South Korea, and now guides the city's \u2018sustainable development\u2019 and changing urban form. It aims to fashion a sustainable mega-city by preserving a significant amount of green space, with 60% of urban land allocated to green corridors and 40% to urban development (S\u00f6derstr\u00f6m, 2014). Satellite cities in the enlarged city-region are a key feature, along with plans for rapid mass transport infrastructure.1\n",

After numerous delays, the first metro line, for which construction began in 2011, is expected to start operations sometime in late 2020. The government is also designing new transportation corridors and investing heavily in highways and expressways (despite the contradictions this might imply vis-\u00e0-vis creating a more sustainable city). These transportation plans have entailed the destruction of house and shop-fronts, the widening of traditional alleyways, and the reorganisation of neighbourhoods. Moreover, critics claim that \u201cthere is very little inter-connectivity between [metro] platforms and other transportation nodes\u201d and a \u201clack of coherence and vision in the transport policy calls into question its ability to solve mobility problems\u201d (Leducq and Scarwell, 2018: 74). Gibert and Son (2016: 33) add that \u201cthe metropolitan authorities have come up with new priorities, beginning with the need for traffic fluidity, which reveals the rise in power of a neo-functionalism perspective concerning urban planning in Vietnam today\u201d (see also Schwanen, 2018). As a telling materialization of this approach, despite the fact that over five million motorbikes ply the city's streets as opposed to only half a million cars, the Hanoi People's Council has proposed to ban motorbikes from downtown streets by 2030 (BBC News, 2017; Hansen, 2017).",

These interviews focused on driver livelihoods, their everyday routines, the challenges they face due to changing municipal policies, and their perceived roles in their local neighbourhoods. Of these 76 drivers, 74 were men and two were women, a fairly representative proportion of xe \u00f4m in the city, with women drivers being uncommon. \u2018Ride-along\u2019 interviews (Kusenbach, 2003) were undertaken with eight additional male xe \u00f4m drivers in 2017. During these rides a smartphone application was used to map the route and photos were taken of decision making points (cross-roads, roundabouts etc.). Informal interviews were completed with the drivers as they drove or immediately afterwards (while showing them the photos just taken) to gain information on decision making points. Additional semi-structured interviews were also completed with 26 motorbike drivers working for app-based firms (at that time UberMoto and GrabBike, before UberMoto was acquired by Grab in 2018), and a further five semi-structured interviews were conducted with urban planners and planning academics. Finally, 52 conversational interviews with Hanoi residents focused on their opinions and use of independent xe \u00f4m and app-based motorbike taxis, bringing the total number of interviews for this research to over 160.",

As such, Cook and Butz (2018) conceive mobility justice as focusing on fair access to motility across society, as well as unprejudiced institutional decision-making processes. More specifically, Sheller (2016: 15) explains that: \u201cMobility may be considered a universal human right, yet in practice it exists in relation to class, racial, sexual, gendered, and disabling exclusions from public space, from national citizenship, and from the means of mobility at all scales\u201d. With a focus here on xe \u00f4m drivers in Hanoi, exclusions based on class, gender, age, and technological savviness are particularly salient, as is the local political context. Yet, to suggest that mobility injustice exists in a world of vastly unequal power is rather obvious, with the balance tipped structurally in favour of those with the largest holdings of economic and symbolic capital (Bourdieu, 1984). Thus, I argue that a core value of the mobility injustice concept is to highlight hidden inequalities, while also being a call to action. Vukov (2015: 113) notes \u201cthe need to call into question the disciplining and policing of embodied movement that goes into legitimizing normative forms of movement\u201d. Non-normative modes of mobility often disrupt the plans and goals of those in positions of power, which can result in rapid responses by such power-holders, furthering mobility injustice (ibid.).",

            "text": "One possible way to highlight these inequalities is to look for sites of \u2018friction\u2019. Cresswell (2014: 108) explains that the importance of friction is that \u201cit draws our attention to the way in which people, things and ideas are slowed down or stopped\u201d. More broadly, Tsing (2005: 4) notes that friction is \u201cthe awkward, unequal, unstable, and creative qualities of interconnections across difference\u201d; it is the moment when universals such as financial capital, science \u2013 and I would suggest urban planning \u2013 \u201ctouch down on real terrain\u201d (Cresswell, 2016: 1084). Tsing adds that \u201cas a metaphorical image, friction reminds us that heterogeneous and unequal encounters can lead to new arrangements of culture and power\u201d (2005: 5). Friction \u201cis not a universal but has specific contours that reflect the places it occurs in\u201d (Cresswell, 2016: 1085). As such, when focusing on a case within a socialist state \u2013 or what Kerkvliet (2019: 19) calls a \u201cresponsive-repressive party-state\u201d \u2013 I also find it relevant to search specifically for what Scott (1990) describes as hidden transcripts as adapted responses to overwhelming power. Thus, while highlighting how those in power create opportunities for mobility tuned to their own vision and needs, I want to focus on how those who find their mobility curtailed \u2013 who experience numerous frictions \u2013 respond and possibly push back. To do so, I examine how mobility (in)justice is intertwined among bodies, streets, transport systems, and policies and processes of urbanisation in Vietnam's capital city. Moreover, with Hanoi's Master Plan being imagined and fashioned overseas among an alliance of international elites, there are important global connections to consider too.",

The People's Council Deputy, Nguy\u1ec5n Ti\u1ebfn Minh, argued that: \u201cSome 70 per cent of traffic accidents are related to motorbikes, which proves that motorbike drivers are those at the highest risk of road accidents\u201d (cited in Vietnam News, 2017b). Given the fact that there is about a 10:1 ratio of motorbikes to cars, this degree of involvement of motorbikes in accidents is perfectly logical, perhaps even low, and makes a rather weak argument for their ban. Other reasons given for the ban have included congestion (Vietnam News, 2017b) and pollution (Al Jazeera, 2018). While Hanoi's streets are congested with motorbikes, cars, and buses, and one could argue that Hanoi has reached \u2018peak motorbike\u2019, replacing motorbikes with cars and buses is unlikely to ease congestion in the near future.3\nPollution is also a questionable rationale for specifically targeting 4-stroke low-cc motorbikes while coal-fired power plants, heavy industry, seasonal agricultural burning, and even strong winds bringing pollution from Chengdu and Chongqing in southwest China have all been found to be important causes of the city's pollution woes (Al Jazeera, 2018).",

This time, the decree includes a focus on developing multimodal public transportation to serve 50\u201355% of residents' needs in the central urban area, and 40% in satellite areas by 2030, while motorbikes are being gradually limited in specific city areas and will be banned in inner districts by 2030 (Socialist Republic of Vietnam, 2017; Vietnam News, 2017b). These steps are very much in line with Vietnam's northern neighbour, where over 30 Chinese cities have restricted or banned motorbikes \u2013 with an associated drastic increase in the sale of cars (South China Morning Post, 2004). The decree for Hanoi also plans similar restrictions on electric bicycles and cyclos, while cars will require automatic toll collection equipment to be installed for inner city areas \u2013 without regulation of their polluting power \u2013 and taxi numbers are to be increased (Socialist Republic of Vietnam, 2017).4\nWhile state officials are pinning their hopes on the new bus rapid transit system and the still to be completed elevated metro system to fill the gap, a former World Bank official has noted: \u201cThere is no evidence from the experience of other cities that just building new transit lines creates a shift in demand toward transit away from individual vehicles like motorcycles and cars. This is especially true when the use of individual means of motorized transport have been prevalent over many years, as is the case in Hanoi\u201d (Bertaud, 2011: 11).",

Customers typically negotiate a price for a ride of a certain distance in advance, and then jump on the seat behind the driver for what can be a hair-rising dash through dense traffic. In Hanoi, xe \u00f4m drivers tend to cluster around train and bus stations and other service locales such as hospitals, as well as waiting on countless busy street corners (Fig. 1\n).6\nAs part of this population, the cohort of independent xe \u00f4m drivers whom we interviewed had an average age of 51, and had been working in this occupation for an average of 15 years. Just over half were from Hanoi, with the remainder from nearby northern provinces. Before becoming a xe \u00f4m driver, over three-quarters had held other informal employment with construction work, cyclo/trishaw riding, and security guard positions being common, while the rest had been farmers. Working an average of 12 h a day, the drivers' daily profits after petrol costs were about VND200,000 (USD$8.60) or US$258/month. By working every day, which the vast majority did, this level of income places them well above the official monthly minimum wage for Hanoi (US$180 as of January 2019). Regular customers were important for just under half of the drivers interviewed, with these customers phoning to organise a ride for themselves, to take children to and from school, or to deliver goods for a small business. Xe \u00f4m drivers worked hard to maintain their customer base, as one noted: \u201cI must be on time, drive carefully, and always be polite. That means I'll be asked to drive for them again. It's important that I build trust with my customers\u201d (interview 2017). Drivers explained that their core motivation to enter this occupation was the flexibility, as well as the freedom from being reliant on others. This flexibility allowed them to help other family members with their jobs, such as ferrying goods from a wholesale market to a family's small food stall, or looking after children or grandchildren. As one 61 year old driver explained: \u201cthis is a \u2018free job\u2019 [l\u00e0m thu\u00ea]; I can come and go as I please and I don't have to follow someone else's rules. We might have to deal with bad people at times, but that's part of the job\u201d (interview, 2016).",

A 48 year old xe \u00f4m driver explained: \u201cIf we are in the wrong lane, or if the policeman's greedy, we'll get stopped and fined. It's about VND200,000-250,000 [US$9-11] if it's on the spot; sometimes we pay a bribe, sometimes it's more official. It changes like the weather really, but it's always more before T\u1ebft [Vietnamese New Year holiday]\u201d (interview 2016).

Xe \u00f4m drivers skillfully draw upon their social networks and knowledge of police routines to protect their spatial practices as much as possible, with specific mobility practices to avoid transport police (cf. Stillerman, 2006). As well as avoiding regular police check-points, drivers utilise their social capital and warn xe \u00f4m friends of new check points and the numbers of police waiting.

Second, some female customers, especially older women, mentioned that for safety reasons they preferred to travel with a driver they already knew, while others noted that they sent their young children to school with a regular driver and would not trust an app-based driver whom they did not know.

Xe \u00f4m drivers are pushing back against GrabBike competitors by mimicking their uniforms. It is incredibly easy to order knock-off copies of clothes in Vietnam, and just as easy to order a freshly painted and designed helmet. Thus some resourceful xe \u00f4m drivers now dress to impersonate GrabBike drivers, wearing a fake GrabBike green logo-printed t-shirt and green helmet. Moreover, since some GrabBike drivers have taken to waiting near bus stations and around tourist areas, rather than waiting for a customer via their phone, xe \u00f4m drivers in their fake GrabBike gear do just the same; not even needing a smartphone and just negotiating a fare in person, as they always have (Fig. 3\n). In addition, since GrabBike bought out UberMoto, there have been limited large-scale app-based competitors to keep GrabBike fares in check. As GrabBike has raised its prices, especially at busy periods of the day and night, some customers are realising that this company (as well as smaller emerging app-based competitors such as Be and GoViet) no longer offers important benefits over traditional xe \u00f4m drivers, and have reverted to xe \u00f4m (resident interviews 2018, 2019).",

These neighbourhood xe \u00f4m had a strong belief that it was their duty to protect their neighbourhood, with some even having been asked directly by local ward officials to \u201ckeep an eye out and help maintain neighbourhood law and order\u201d (interview, 2018). Because of this informal neighbourhood role, xe \u00f4m drivers felt they were fully entitled to wait for customers on local sidewalks. One 52 year old male driver explained: \u201cWhen I am at work here, I also look out for this neighborhood. We [xe \u00f4m drivers] have to jump in to help out when something happens, like a fire. We can't stand by idle; people wouldn't like it and would call us names. Even when things like scuffles or an assault occurs in the neighborhood, we have to help talk with the people involved. If anything serious happens we have to report to authorities; they are in charge but we still help to lower the tension and calm down the situation\u201d (interview, 2018). Another a 59 year old driver determined that his role was more prevention than giving chase to thieves, explaining: \u201cWhen we see a thief we have to shoo them away. It's not our job to chase after them, that's police work, but if we see strangers hanging around, such as drug addicts, we have to ask them to move on to ply their trade elsewhere\u201d. It is important to note that this narrative was spatially bound, and only played out in the xe \u00f4m drivers' own neighbourhoods rather than on the city's streets as a whole. As the above 52 year old driver added: \u201cOf course I only help out in this [neighbourhood name]; elsewhere I would ignore whatever is going on since you can get into big trouble poking your hands in other people's business\u201d.

In this context, it is probably na\u00efve or overly hopeful to consider that members of this precarious work force will be able to create long-term, meaningful counter-spaces or counter-hegemonic movements anytime soon (Gramsci, 1971; Pratt, 2004). Unlike protests against the restructuring of public space in democratic countries in the Global North (Mitchell, 1995; McCann, 1999), xe \u00f4m drivers must try to protect their livelihoods through far more subtle means and cautious negotiations reminiscent of Scott's (1990) notion of infrapolitics. Yet, with their everyday, micro-level, spatial practices, independent xe \u00f4m drivers do resist dominant mobility paradigms with flexible and creative approaches. They warn friends of police blocks, navigate around the city to avoid fines and bribes, and imitate GrabBike drivers to reach a broader customer base. Xe \u00f4m drivers build trust with customers, neighbours, and shop keepers, many of whom they have known for years, in very local and situated ways, while remaining highly mobile, navigating the city with their vehicles and bodies, and transgressing geographical and social boundaries (see also Sopranzetti 2018). Concurrently, they have also succeeded to some degree in creating a new narrative regarding their rights to certain spaces. I thus suggest that \u2018micro counter-spaces\u2019 are being shaped via their actions, opening up space for alternative narratives to be heard and acknowledged by a range of actors. Yet, will they be able to take this further? As a comparison, in 2008 the Vietnamese Women's Museum (B\u1ea3o t\u00e0ng Ph\u1ee5 n\u1eef Vi\u1ec7t Nam) organised an exhibition on Hanoi's women street vendors which gained wide press coverage and helped raise awareness of who these individuals' backgrounds, livelihood options, and family responsibilities.12\nA similar exhibition supported by a non-government organisation or social enterprise (albeit unlikely to be staged at the Women's Museum) could help highlight the alternative narratives being put forward by Hanoi's independent xe \u00f4m drivers, and perhaps also create space for dialogues with city officials regarding the upcoming motorbike ban. Such an exhibition has yet to occur and the 2020 Coronavirus outbreak throws these livelihoods into an even more tenuous situation. Nonetheless, there is still hope that in their low-key, daily decisions, manoeuvers, and unexpected actions, these independent xe \u00f4m drivers will continue to adapt to maintain their livelihoods and access to the city, while contesting and subverting elements of the dominant urban planning model being put forward by powerful actors.",
