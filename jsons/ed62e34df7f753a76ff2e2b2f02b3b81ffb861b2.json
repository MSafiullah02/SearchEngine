We excluded EUS and ERCP patients. \"Elective\" status was established by consensus among our endoscopists. The survey solicited perceptions in two main domains: 1) undergoing endoscopy during the pandemic with no effective treatment or vaccine available and 2) the impact of adopting new safety measures and staff COVID-19 testing on willingness to proceed. Stay-athome orders were active in Indiana (only essential travel) during the survey period. Indiana announced elective procedures, including endoscopies, could resume on April 27, 2020 1 .",

How effective any particular measure will be and whether it will be available in the next few months is currently unknown. The actual measures that will be taken at the time that you undergo the procedure are under ongoing review.You are under no obligation to participate in this survey, and refusing to participate will not affect your care at Indiana University in any way. If you participate, your identity will be confidential and will not be made known to the doctors reviewing the results of the survey. We expect that approximately 500 patients who have had their procedures delayed will be called to participate in this survey. The survey is expected to take 5-10 minutes to complete. Are you willing to help us by participating in this survey? For this section you should assume that we are past the peak of the infection but it is still around and there is some risk of acquiring it from going out into public. In addition you should assume that no effective treatment for active infection has become widely available. Also assume that no vaccine is available. After I read each measure, I'll ask you to rate it according to how valuable or important you perceive the measure to be in making you confident about the safety of having your procedure and not being exposed to coronavirus. The lowest rating is that this measure has \"no value\" from your perspective -meaning it doesn't increase your confidence at all, the next rating is \"a little value\", then the next rating is \"important-this measure should be in place at the endoscopy unit\", and the highest rating is \"critical for my confidence in undergoing the procedure.\" Finally, if you aren't sure or don't know what the measure is you can rate it you are \"not sure or don't know\".12.
