We propose a study in a public organization based on action design research (ADR) methodology to enhance theoretical knowledge and develop practice in relation to employee-driven digital innovation. This research-in-progress study follows the divided stages of ADR, where the stage of problem formulation is to be conducted through semi-structured interviews. Findings from stage 1 will provide knowledge about the phenomenon with a public organization as a context and make up the problem definition within ADR. The stage of building, interventions and evaluation is to be conducted with interventions in focus groups where we will investigate how to increase adoption of employee-driven digital innovation and how introducing digital tools can support employee-driven digital innovation as an innovation practice. The study aims to contribute by creating general solution concepts about employee-driven digital innovation.",

Employee-driven innovation is founded upon the argument that organizations cannot ignore the innovative resources and potential of ordinary employees [2] . This new approach to innovation, although the underlying elements are not new, has been attracting more interest in recent years [3] . Looking into the subject shows that most of the research in the quest to understand employee-driven digital innovation has been done towards private organizations. But there exist knowledge gaps to the understanding of the phenomenon with regard to public organizations, not at least in relation to digital innovation. This brings us to our research questions for our study: R.Q.1: How do employee-driven digital innovation work in a public organization? R.Q.2: How to increase employee-driven digital innovation in a public organization? R.Q.3: How to introduce digital tools to support employee-driven digital innovation?",

Some researchers claim that organizations that are not interested in innovation to face the dynamic environments will apparently disappear [5] . Organizations seek to exploit the opportunities to innovate in pursuit of competitive advantages. Innovation is more than just a creation of an idea, it is also about idea-creation and idea-development (exploring), and how these can be utilized (exploited) through new product and service offerings [6] . Innovation in the public sector however is an area that has not been extensively studied before, and there is no common understanding of what innovation in public organizations is or developed a framework for understanding innovation within [7] . One reason for this might be the fundamental differences between public and private organizations that might affect their interest and ability to innovate, such as purpose and innovation focus. In recent years, several new approaches to innovation have emerged, including user-driven innovation and open innovation [8] . Lately we have also seen the emergence of employee-driven innovation [9] . The understanding of innovation, and how innovation develops in the organizations, is no longer limited to R&D units or experts. Innovation processes initiated by employees, and often in collaboration with the external ecosystem, are recognized. Because of these new approaches improved explanatory models are required to innovation.",

In employee-driven innovation, the focus is on utilizing the innovation potential that the organization has overall and, not least, the knowledge, skills and experience that the ordinary employees possess. Organizations increasingly recognize that innovation does not just happen exclusively through top-down decisions, internally by investing in R&D units or externally by pursuing open innovation or creating innovation hubs [11] . The core idea of employeedriven innovation is that by inciting cooperation between employees and managers, companies' innovation performance will improve greatly [1] . A bottom-up approach, like employee-driven innovation, might produce value to the organization by utilizing employee's knowledge, experience and ideas to provide continuous innovation. Changing environment and conditions in work life also underpin employee-driven innovation, as a growing number of innovations will be intangible and service oriented [12] . These changes, together with increasing focus on digital innovation, has created what we have chosen to call employee-driven digital innovation. Digital innovation can be understood as using digital technology during the process of innovation or that the outcome of the innovation is fully or partly digital [13] . When ordinary employees, through involvement in the innovation process, creating ideas and contributing to the realization of these, with elements of digital innovation, one can talk about employeedriven digital innovation. Despite the emerging interest in digital innovation, it emerges as a research area to the extent that it is not fully developed [14] . Digital innovation initiatives still need further theorization [14] .",

The field of Information Systems earlier relied on design research [19] and action research [20] to address these challenges. The emergence of ADR [4] , as a variant of design science research [19] , privileges organizational influences on the design and evolution of the design artifact, emphasizing concurrent building, intervention and evaluation [21] . In our study the aim is to both contribute to theory and practice, and to elucidate our research questions, we have chosen to use the methodology of ADR. ADR is a research method for generating prescriptive design knowledge through building and evaluating ensemble IT artifacts in an organizational setting [4] . This methodological approach deals with two seemingly disparate challenges: (1) addressing a problem situation encountered in a specific organizational setting by intervening and evaluating; and (2) constructing and evaluating an IT artifact that addresses the class of problems typified by the encountered situation [4] . Employee-driven digital innovation has knowledge gaps when it comes to application in public organizations. Our aim is to study employee-driven digital innovation through the use the ADR method in the context of a public organization (theoretical contribution) and increase the use of employee-driven digital innovation and implement digital tools to support the innovation practice (practical contribution).",

In this organization, there are several digital innovation projects that are already employee-driven, and they have an ambition to increase the impact of digital innovation through new and better services for their inhabitants. The management has expressed a desire to increase adoption of employee-driven digital innovation, as an innovation practice, to the whole organization. We therefore think that using ADR is an appropriate approach to the problem. Our research approach can be attributed to the four stages in the ADR methodology (Fig. 1) . Through this approach we will be both gaining an understanding of the problem as well as generating interventions in the innovation practice and adoption and support of employeedriven digital innovation. According to [4] the ADR research method can be broken down into four different stages:",

This is a diagnostic phase and contribute to the problem definition of employee-driven digital innovation. The problem formulation stage in ADR identifies and conceptualizes a research opportunity based on existing theories and technologies [4, 20] . Here we do that through the use of existing theory of employee-driven digital innovation. The data collection is done through the use of semi-structured interviews with respondents, including project leaders and project members, from three different ongoing employee-driven digital innovation projects. There will also be conducted semi-structured interviews with people holding other positions across the organization close to the different projects (support positions). These respondents both include the strategic level in the organization, as well as at the IT-department (programmers) who interact across the various digital innovation projects. This also gives us opportunities to compare between the different projects and increases the validity of the potential findings. This acquisition of knowledge will also be important when we face the stage of intervention later in the research design. These innovation projects are at different stages in the innovation process, which gives us different perspectives on the innovation process.",

This stage heavily rests upon the framing and theoretical premises adopted at stage one [4] . Through this stage we will build further knowledge about the phenomenon of employee-driven digital innovation and do interventions through the use of focus groups to increase adoption in parts of the organization that have not yet adopted and implemented the innovation practice. This stage will create knowledge about best practices of employee-driven digital innovation in public organizations that also can be used in stage four to create general solution concepts. The design of the model/construct/approach for how to increase the adoption of employee-driven digital innovation in the organization must be done in close collaboration with the employees and management of the organization. This also applies for introduction of digital tools to support this innovation practice. The outcome of stage two of the ADR is the realized design of the artifact [4] . This type of research is aimed at changing the organization's practice, and not just studying the phenomenon from an outside perspective [19] . There is also conceivable to apply iterations to the ADR method at stage one and two. This will give the possibilities of further developing knowledge and practices about adoption of employee-driven digital innovation in the organization and how introduction of digital tools to support it can be done [22] . This building of knowledge and practices will also contribute to the reflection and learning in stage three in the ADR method.",

Our main goal of the study is to increase the knowledge and understanding of employee-driven digital innovation in a public organization. There is reason to believe that employee-driven digital innovation in private and public organizations might have differences in terms of factors (e.g. innovation focus and tasks) affecting employees' willingness to participate in the innovation process. One of the reasons for this may be that innovation in public organizations is based on providing the best and most effective services to the citizens, while in private organizations it is based on innovating with a view to products and services that will maximize profits. These differences in basic assumptions in the organizations can influence how innovation processes are adopted, implemented and practiced, and not least the outcomes. It may also be that factors known as basis for creating employee-driven innovation in private organizations; as autonomy, organizations innovation focus, willingness to collaborate, etc., may appear different in the context of public organizations. We believe that using ADR, with the possibilities of numerous iterations at stage two, will give a better understanding of employee-driven digital innovation in a public organization, and provide the ability to create general solution concepts of how to increase adoption and digital supporting tools that are more applicable then the use of any other research methods.",
