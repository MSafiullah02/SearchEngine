Recent studies introduce deep learning to mitigate the manual feature extraction (i.e., data representation) efforts and achieve high accuracy. However, there are still challenges in learning accurate representations for sensory data due to the weakness of representation modules and the subject variances. We propose a scheme called Distance-based HAR from Ensembled spatial-temporal Representations (DHARER) to address above challenges. The idea behind DHARER is straightforward-the same activities should have similar representations. We first learn representations of the input sensory segments and latent prototype representations of each class, using a Convolution Neural Network (CNN)based dual-stream representation module; then the learned representations are projected to activity types by measuring their similarity to the learned prototypes. We have conducted extensive experiments under a strict subject-independent setting on three large-scale datasets to evaluate the proposed scheme, and our experimental results demonstrate superior performance of DHARER to several state-of-the-art methods.",

The performance of these methods normally depends on the effectiveness of the extracted features where are heuristic, task-independent, and not specially designed for HAR [12] . Since designing powerful task-specific features require significant domain knowledge, and are labour intensive and time consuming, recent research introduces deep learning methods, which have exceptional data representation ability to expedite feature extraction. These works utilize deep neural networks, such as Convolution Neural Networks (CNN) [5, 16] and Long-Short Term Memory (LSTM) [8, 11] , as feature extractors to learn the representation of the input sensory segments automatically, and then map the representation to labels using another neural network (normally a basic fully-connected layer).",

Considering the sensitivity of neural networks to noise, the biases in the representations further prevent neural network-based classifiers from making correct activity classification. In addition, subject variances inherently exist in HAR, where people tend to perform activities that are heavily influenced by personal characteristics, such as gender, height, weight, and strength. For example, men usually perform activities at a larger magnitude than women. Such divergence introduces deviations to the representations among subjects and thus prevent the model from getting accurate classification for new subjects (haven't appeared in the training set).",

            "text": "The recent work in HAR has moved towards designing deep learning models for more accurate recognition, given the exceptional representation ability of deep learning techniques. Most deep learning-based HAR methods focus on capturing the temporal correlations in the sensory streams. Jian Bo et al. [16] tackle the problem with convolutional neural networks, in which the convolution and pooling filters are designed along the temporal dimensions to process the readings of all sensors. Their work can capture long-term temporal correlation by stacking multiple CNN layers. Ord\u00f3\u00f1ez et al. [12] further extend this model to Deep-ConvLSTM by integrating LSTM after CNN layers. The proposed DeepCon-vLSTM framework contains four CNN layers and two LSTM layers to capture the short-term and long-term temporal correlations, separately. One drawback of the DeepConvLSTM is that it potentially assumes the signals in all time steps are relevant and contribute equally to the target activity, which may not true. Murahari et al. [11] propose to solve the problem by integrating the temporal attention module to DeepConvLSTM. The attention module aligns the output vector at the last time step with other vectors at earlier steps to learn a relative importance score for each previous time step. Different from these methods, Guan et al. [8] propose to achieve more robust data representation ability with the ensemble method. They employ the Epoch-wise Bagging scheme in the training procedure and select multiple LSTMs in different training epochs as basic learners to form a powerful model. However, these methods neglect the spatial correlations among the different sensors, which cannot represent the sensory data precisely. Besides, they directly classify the learned representations to activity type with basic NN-based classifier, which could lead to misguided result due to the learning deviation and subject variances in the representations.",

As a contrast, the spatial CNN applies the CNN kernels with size k l S \u00d7 k l S in the l th S-CNN block to capture the spatial correlations between different sensor series.

The prototypes are used to represent the embedding of each class. Then, DCAM recognizes the segment representation by comparing its similarity with the prototypes, which follows the same idea with the nearest neighbour methods. For clarity, we denote the data used to learning the prototypes as the support set and the segments to be recognized as queries (see Fig. 2 ). In the training period, both support set and queries come from the training dataset. In the testing phase, we extract the support set from the training dataset and the queries from the testing dataset to avoid the information leakage.",

We also evaluate them with the LOSO evaluation protocol iteratively to achieve a fair and thorough comparison. Table 2 shows the experimental results, from which we can observe the following points: 1) all the SOTAs deep learning models perform better than SVM, showing the superior ability of deep learning models in extracting complex nonlinear temporal patterns in the sensory streams. 2) the MC-CNN model outperforms LSTM-based methods in the MHEALTH dataset and PAMAP2 dataset, but fails in the UCIDSADS dataset. Recall the window length of each dataset, we interpret the results as the admirable ability of temporal CNN in capturing accurate temporal correlations with only a short time period of data. As a contrast, LSTM-based methods need data from longer period of time. 3) the complex reinforcement learning-based Multi-agent model does not work very well as reported in [5] , where only six basic activities are selected for experiments. The result indicates the difficulty of selecting important modalities for numerous and more complex activities. 4) Last but not the least, our method consistently beats all the comparison models on three datasets with a significant margin.

We first design a dualstream networks based on CNN to represent the sensory streams more accurately by integrating both spatial and temporal correlations. Then, a distance-based classification model is introduced, which classify the segments by comparing their similarity to the learned prototypes of each class in the representation space. Comparing to the NN-based classification module, the distance-based classification model is less susceptible to the bias in the segment representations. Moreover, we propose the cross-subject training strategy to deal with the deviations caused by subject-variance. Extensive experiments on three datasets demonstrate the superior of our proposed method over several strong SOTAs.",
