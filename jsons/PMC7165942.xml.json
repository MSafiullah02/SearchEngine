Quantifying the amount of pathogen present in such samples is more difficult as the pathogen concentration in these sampling sites can vary over time as well as locally, in different sampling sites. However, in general, these pathogen loads are very high in the acute phase of illness, (e.g. 108\u20131012 viral RNA copies/ml for influenza, although the actual proportion that represents viable viruses is uncertain) (Chu et al., 2004; Hatagishi et al., 2014; Lee et al., 2011; Milton et al., 2013; Tang et al., 2014; To et al., 2010).",

These data give us an idea of the type and number of organisms (or at least the viral or bacterial RNA/DNA copies/ml collection fluid) present in the \u2018airborne\u2019 environment, that is the ambient air from which people inhale, with the potential risk of inhaling an airborne respiratory pathogen that could lead to infection and disease. Although most of these data are in the form of nucleic acid detection, a few have also cultured live pathogens from air samples (particularly influenza).",

Nevertheless, over the past 10 years, there have been more and more studies using air sampling, with the development of newer, more sensitive, and less \u2018traumatic\u2019 samplers (Koehler et al., 2012; Sleeth and Vincent, 2012; Yao and Mainelis, 2007; Zhou and Cheng, 2010).",

However, given the different immunological makeups of those that are exposed, the number of people actually contracting infection and disease from such infectious agents is difficult to estimate. Although many modeling and experimental studies have tried, the validation of such estimates is difficult and the results from such studies can be inaccurate at best and misleading at worst. Conclusions drawn from such imperfect studies are often used by public health teams to estimate potential incidence rates and therefore to guide their preventative and/or interventional policies, for example, the tough criticism of the WHO regarding recommendations to stockpile the anti\u2010influenza drug, oseltamivir (\u2018Tamiflu\u2019), in response to early fears of a much more severe 2009 H1N1 pandemic (BMJ, 2014).",

In fact, the difference in viral loads is of the order of several log10 lower in the airborne droplet compared to the diagnostic oral swab, when the samples are taken from the same patient, within minutes to hours of each other. This is an intriguing finding and requires further confirmation, but, if confirmed, suggests that just using the diagnostic viral load, normally expressed in viral RNA copies/ml, as a basis to estimate the influenza viral concentration in exhaled droplets of different sizes/volumes, may be misleading.",

Proximity to fresh air sources, such as open windows or personalized ventilation systems? Recent, renewed interest in the human thermal plume, using experimental visualization methods, suggests that it may act as a sort of natural air curtain, but that it is easily penetrated. It may also act to move contaminants upwards toward the upper part of the room, but again, this is potentially double\u2010edged phenomenon in that it may convect contaminants from lower levels into the inhalation zone, as well as moving contaminants into the inhalation zone of others, where they are positioned above one's head height (Clark and de Calcina\u2010Goff, 2009; Craven and Settles, 2006; Licina et al., 2014; Licina et al., 2015; Murakami, 2004; Tang et al., 2009; Voelker et al., 2014).",

Also, there is an accumulating evidence that the newly emerged Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS\u2010CoV) has a preference for infecting the LRT rather than the URT, and diagnostic testing for this virus has given false\u2010negative results on URT samples, where the LRT samples have tested positive (Memish et al., 2014). Therefore, knowing where different droplet sizes deposit within the human URT and LRT after inhalation may be useful to determine the likelihood of infection and subsequent disease.",

Obviously this is a continuous spectrum. Most recently, new evidence is emerging for some pathogens (particular influenza) that the expelled droplets in such naturally generated aerosols may, in fact, carry far less pathogen than was present in the original infected host compartment (usually the URT/oropharyngeal cavity). This latter finding needs further confirmation, but if true, it may require a rethink of current infection control concerns and interventions for such pathogens; (3) finally, relatively little work has been done examining the inhalational phenomenon and the relevant infectious doses in this airborne transmission context. However, in a related field \u2013 that of drug delivery \u2013 much modeling and experimental work has already been performed, examining how to adjust particle sizes, concentrations, and modes of delivery to optimize their deposition and therefore their required effect in the human respiratory tract. Some of these data can be applied to investigations into this final stage of the airborne transmission pathway. Specifically, this may be of relevance if the receptor distribution within the respiratory tract for specific pathogens is known.",

However, due to the variously variable pathogen incubation periods, it is noted that such workplace\u2010acquired infections may be difficult to separate from home\u2010 and community\u2010acquired infections, unless carefully controlled \u2018clinical trial\u2010like\u2019 studies are also performed to assess the effectiveness of individual interventions.",
