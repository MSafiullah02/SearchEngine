            "text": "The common structural denominator for a typical small virus is a genome surrounded by a shell composed of dozens of copies of the capsid protein. Many small viruses also have lipid envelopes studded with glycoproteins that can facilitate cell entry. Even a small virus is complex, yet its formation is a canonical example of self-assembly. Given the right conditions, the capsid proteins of many viruses will assemble to capsid-like structures, rapidly, in high yield and with high fidelity (Table 1\n). This observation opens up two distinct fields of study: the process of self-assembly and regulation of assembly. The process of self-assembly is best described by physical chemistry, for example self-assembly can be modeled by a system of differential equations or emulated with small molecules. Regulating assembly, by contrast, is fundamentally biochemical and ultimately biological in nature. Consider our hypothetical virus where unregulated assembly could yield capsids that did not contain the viral genome or toxic accumulation of the fusion protein. These spontaneous assembly reactions must be delayed until the right time and place. Regulation is probably at the level of allostery, which is defined as a conformational change in a molecule, usually a protein, that alters its activity, induced by an effector molecule. In addition to allostery, regulation could require viral or host factors. Regulation of the large event of virus assembly by a small reaction, such as inducing conformational change of a single protein, provides the leverage that controls virus replication in vivo. Disruption of regulation is an ideal target for antiviral therapeutics. Defining the regulation that directly controls the physical chemistry of assembly is a field in its infancy and the focus of this review.",

Both the capsid and glycoprotein are protein oligomers; from a physical\u2013chemical perspective, their assembly is similar; from a biological perspective they demonstrably have similar elements of regulation. Although there are numerous experimental systems (Table 1, Table 2\n), the discussion of capsid assembly will focus on hepatitis B virus (HBV) with significant references to retroviruses and bacteriophage MS2. Furthermore, small molecules that dramatically affect HBV assembly have demonstrable antiviral activity. The discussion on glycoprotein assembly will focus on the formation of the spike complex of alphaviruses as the spike is composed of two proteins which intricately interact and are required for viral entry. Finally, we will discuss potential steps in assembly that could be targeted for designing antiviral therapeutics.",

            "text": "Instead, assembly simulations, from master equations that treat assembly reactions as a well-mixed solution 2, 3 to molecular dynamics that describe stochastic formation of single capsids 4, 5, concur on three generalizations (Box 1\n). First, weak interactions are necessary to minimize errors and kinetic traps. Weak interactions also contribute to a defined nucleation step. Second, nucleation minimizes the initiation of assembly, decreasing kinetic trapping of intermediates due to depletion of AUs. Third, the initial kinetic phase where there is little capsid formation is due to the time required to build the steady state of intermediates that supports subsequent assembly. More sophisticated mathematical models that incorporate the biological details of individual viruses (e.g. nucleic acid, scaffolding and allostery) will help to identify opportunities to interfere with assembly.Box 1An analytical description of capsid assemblyProbably the simplest way to describe assembly of a capsid of N assembly units (AUs) is as a progressive series of intermediates [100]. To quantify this description, one can assume that all contacts between AUs have the same energy, energies are additive, microscopic forward rates are identical (subject to statistical considerations) and that backward rates are the product of forward rates, dissociation constants and statistical terms. The result is a series of rate equations each with terms for assembly and disassembly. Two equations in the series are unique: the monomer equation references all intermediates and the final equation is a dead-end with only one build-up and one build-down term.d[n-mer]/dt=kforward,n[(n\u22121)mer][monomer]\u2212kforward,n+1[n-mer][monomer]\u2212kbackward,n[n-mer]+kbackward,n+1[(n+1)mer]\nIncorporating weak interactions between AUs and a slow nucleation step to limit the initiation of assembly results in robust reactions with minimal kinetics traps where errors and (meta)stable intermediates accumulate 4, 39. This model necessarily leads to sigmoidal kinetics and, at equilibrium, a pseudocritical concentration of free AU 5, 100. The resulting model recapitulates most of the features observed in vitro (Figure I\n).Assembly can be described in much greater detail as stochastic reactions using discrete event simulators or coarse-grained molecular dynamics [4]. These molecular simulations provide detail, showing conditions where association of intermediates could be an important path, where reversibility is crucial [5], and how subunit geometry can affect the size and shape of assembly products [4]. This statistical mechanical view of assembly leads to a view that is fundamentally similar to the thermodynamic\u2013kinetic view described above [4]. However, the detail provides additional insights into the reactions and the behaviors that can be anticipated by biological molecules.",

Viral RNA has been considered as an \u2018antenna\u2019 to attract free AUs [17] and as a platform that attracts and organizes AUs on its surface [18]. Assembly driven by RNA can be thought of in terms of the McGhee\u2013von Hippel model of nonspecific protein binding to a surface [19], which considers that the association for nucleic acid (NA), K\nNA, is modified by a cooperativity coefficient, \u03c9, based on the protein\u2013protein association constant. An \u03c9 of 1 indicates no cooperativity; an \u03c9 >1000 results in steep cooperativity and reactions that appear to be two-state. Cowpea chlorotic mottle virus, which does not assemble under RNA-binding conditions, binds RNA with low cooperativity, displaying gradual assembly and partial capsids [20]. HBV, where the reciprocal of the pseudocritical concentration (equivalent to \u03c9) is \u223c105 under physiological conditions, binds RNA tenaciously and with high cooperativity, resulting in quantitative assembly under mild conditions [21]. A NA scaffold can thus concentrate the capsid protein and provide additional association energy.",

            "text": "Retroviral Gag, the \u2018capsid protein\u2019 of immature retroviruses, is a multidomain protein. The elements of Gag that are most important for this discussion are the two-domain capsid (CA) segment (the primary mediator of Gag\u2013Gag interactions), a spacer peptide that follows CA, and the RNA-binding nucleocapsid (NC) segment. The earliest suggestion of allostery in retrovirus assembly came from in vitro assembly studies using DNA oligomers and Gag 22, 23. Gag dimerization was crucial for assembly: HIV Gag would not assemble with very short oligos nor if the oligo had high-affinity sequences separated by a low-affinity sequence, suggesting that protein\u2013protein interaction was required to activate assembly [24]. Replacing NC with a leucine zipper promoted dimerization of Gag and was sufficient to drive assembly in cells [25], although other factors were required in vitro\n[26]. What transitions are driven by protein oligomerization and DNA-binding? Small angle neutron scattering indicated that HIV Gag had a propensity to fold on itself [17], thus straightening might be a crucial assembly transition. Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) studies have indicated that the spacer sequence C-terminal to Gag (in HIV and RSV) can refold 27, 28. This refolding transition, driven by binding NA, might expose surfaces on CA to allow interaction [28] and generate a new, potentially helix-rich interaction between the spacer peptides 29, 30. Recent tomographic studies of immature HIV demonstrate CA\u2013CA interactions and spacer peptide\u2013spacer peptide interactions 30, 31. Thus, it appears that Gag undergoes one or more conformational transitions to assemble into an immature lattice. These conformational transitions are involved in Gag assembly and are consistent with a regulatory effect, that is they prevent assembly by obstructing interactions [28] and this obstruction can be removed by binding a cofactor [26].",

            "text": "In the RNA bacteriophage MS2, the role of allostery mediated by NA is unambiguous (Figure 2\n). These phages are organized with T = 3 quasi-symmetry; their capsids comprise 90 chemically identical dimers that fit into AB and CC environments [32]. B half-dimers cluster around icosahedral fivefold vertices, A and C half-dimers alternate around icosahedral threefold vertices (quasi-sixfolds). The A and C half-dimers are very similar, whereas a loop on the B subunits has a different conformation, suggesting a structural switch. Uhlenbeck and co-workers showed that a specific RNA stem\u2013loop from the genome, TR, was necessary and by itself sufficient to induce capsid assembly 33, 34. By NMR, TR-free dimer was shown to be symmetrical in solution, suggestive of a CC dimer, but TR-bound dimer was asymmetric [35]. Pure RNA-free dimers or pure TR-saturated dimers do not assemble rapidly, that is they appeared kinetically trapped [35]. Addition of the other form of coat protein to trapped species resulted in rapid assembly [36]. These results showed that both forms of dimer, symmetric and RNA-bound asymmetric, are needed for efficient assembly and that RNA was an allosteric effector. Non-TR RNA stem\u2013loops also trigger these effects, although they are much weaker binders, implying that multiple RNA\u2013coat protein interactions within the capsids also contribute to conformer switching 36, 37. Normal mode analysis has suggested that the RNA-induced conformational change might be one of dynamics, rather than static dimer conformations [38], and is consistent with the lack of sequence-specificity. Analyzing mixed assembly reactions by mass spectrometry has provided a clear example of assembly by one dimer at a time rather than via coalescence of oligomers [35]. Examination of assembly reactions with TR incorporated into a longer RNA have lead to the surprising conclusion that assembly might be directed by an RNA scaffold [36], funneling the system along only a few of the very many possible assembly paths [36]. Thus, initiation by an allosteric event and limitation by allosteric responses to protein\u2013RNA and protein\u2013protein interaction gives MS2 assembly the appearance of following a deterministic path. An alternative viewpoint suggested by recent theoretical studies is that only a relatively small number of intermediates will ever be used during assembly as a consequence of kinetic availability and thermodynamic stability [39].",

Conformational differences between free Cp dimer and the same protein in the context of capsid are evident in the crystal structure of an assembly defective mutant (Figure 3b)\n[40]. Dimers from capsid are symmetrical about the dimer interface [41], whereas free dimer is asymmetric. Comparison of the structures suggests a mechanical linkage of subdomains connected to a central chassis; these subdomains displace one another like so many molecular dominos, leading to movements of up to 9 \u00c5 and a conformation that is geometrically incompatible with an icosahedral structure. In comparison to the crystal structure, an NMR study under non-assembly conditions showed a symmetric dimer that was readily asymmetrized by interaction with a Cp-binding peptide [42]. Thus, the dimer is able to adopt multiple conformations, or families of conformations, tentatively categorized as assembly-active and assembly-inactive.",

In vitro experiments showed that HAPs could misdirect assembly and, more crucially, HAPs strengthen dimer\u2013dimer association and accelerate assembly kinetics, sometimes by orders of magnitude 9, 44. A crystal structure of a HAP\u2013capsid complex (Figure 3a) shows that HAPs lead to a change in capsid quaternary structure (but not Cp tertiary structure), bowing out icosahedral fivefold vertices while flattening hexagonal arrangements of dimers [41]. These two effects explain the basis of assembly misdirection by destabilizing fivefold vertices while favoring sheets of Cp dimers [9]. The HAP molecule fills a hydrophobic pocket at the dimer interface, increasing buried surface area and presumably the association constant while slightly distorting the geometry of Cp\u2013Cp interaction [41].",

This hypothesis leads to predictions about the nature of assembly and its allosteric activation. First, as per assembly models, a kinetic effect will be most evident in the nucleation step. Starting capsid assembly at an inappropriate time (e.g. without the viral genetic material) is unfavorable for the virus. Second, faster kinetics indicate that effectors decrease the energy barrier to assembly, which can be best explained by invoking an effector-induced conformational change. The graphic of the HAP site in the context of free and the capsid conformations (Figure 3c) supports this hypothesis. The key point is that only the nucleation step of an assembly reaction needs be affected to gain an overall enhancement of assembly kinetics (Figure 3d). Thus, the few effectors needed for nucleation can be leveraged to consume many copies of Cp to produce failed virus.",

However, when TF is translated, E1 translation is abrogated, presumably drastically impacting the assembly of the pE2\u2013E1 heterodimer.",

The three classes are trimers in their fusion-active conformation. For most viruses, the final step of glycoprotein spike assembly is the activation of the fusion protein.

The cleavage of E3 from pE2 occurs in the trans-Golgi [63] and marks the transition from an immature to mature or fusogenic alphavirus particle. Immature and mature alphaviruses are structurally similar, but immature particles have reduced infectivity levels compared with mature particles because of the presence of E3 and/or because E1 is not in a metastable state able to facilitate fusion [63]. Retaining the E3 protein until the trans-Golgi might serve to prevent premature fusion of the assembled spikes with membranes in the host cell secretory pathway. Thus, E3 is an effector of spike activity. At the plasma membrane the spikes are arranged in large hexagonal arrays [64], creating a platform for virus budding. Host proteins have not been identified within the alphavirus glycoprotein array, suggesting that lateral interactions between the spikes are important, in contrast to vesicular stomatitis virus [65], HIV [66] and influenza virus [67] which also bud from the plasma membrane. Although not usually described as such, pE2 acts as an effector of E1 activation at two different times, as a chaperone and by releasing E3 for activation.",

The Class III fusion proteins do not have a chaperone protein nor do they require a cleavage step to activate the protein into a fusion-active form. The vesicular stomatitis virus G protein is found in three reversible conformations in a pH-dependent equilibrium. The reversible conformations are a unique property among Class III fusion proteins, suggestive of allosteric conformational changes, which also prevents premature fusion during assembly [70].

For example, we have learned from the HAP molecules that interfering with assembly is not equivalent to inhibiting assembly. In addition, weak interactions between protein subunits or glycoprotein complexes minimize production of misassembled spikes. Thus, altering the kinetics, misdirecting the intermediates, stabilizing an interaction to prevent disassembly are all viable options that disrupt a highly evolved set of reactions to achieve the same end goal: reduced virus propagation.",
