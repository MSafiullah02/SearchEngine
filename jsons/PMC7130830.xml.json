These infections can cause severe symptoms in preterm infants, such as respiratory distress with high morbidity and mortality. Lower respiratory viral infections (LRTI), especially due to respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), are the leading cause of hospital admissions among infants.1 Having a history of prematurity (less than 32 weeks of gestational age) is a risk factor for severe LRTI in early childhood, and late preterm babies have been considered in the same risk group.2 Nevertheless, this issue is under investigation and some research groups have not found a higher risk in late preterm infants (more than 336 weeks of gestational age (GA).3 Respiratory distress syndrome at birth could be a risk factor for hospitalisation in this group.4 Other authors have not found association between prematurity and hospitalisation during the first two years of life.5\n",

In these assays, reverse transcription (RT) and first amplification round were carried out in a single tube using the Qiagen\u00ae OneStep RT-PCR kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). Influenza A, B and C viruses were detected using a previously described method including the primer sets specific to amplify influenza viruses in a multiplex PCR assay.8 From 2003, this assay was used directly in respiratory samples as the routine method for the establishment of primary influenza A, B and C diagnosis at the National Influenza Centre-Madrid. A second multiplex PCR was used to detect parainfluenza viruses 1\u20134, human coronaviruses 229E and OC43, enteroviruses and rhinoviruses.9 Presence of RSV-A and B types, HMPV, HBoV and adenoviruses were investigated by a third multiplex RT-nested PCR method.10\n",

This risk is further increased if during the neonatal period they presented hyaline membrane disease and/or needed invasive mechanical ventilation (p\n < 0.001).

The physiological deficiencies that result from incomplete lung development are likely to account for the early morbidity and vulnerability to infection.11 A modest but growing body of literature has documented the broad range of complications that late-preterm infants may experience. Colin et al.11 in a review of the literature, found 24 studies, 16 of which were retrospective population-based cohort studies; and eight were observational, most of which focused on RSV infection. They found that infants born at 32\u201336 weeks GA, experience substantial respiratory morbidity compared with term infants. Respiratory distress syndrome at birth has been described as a risk factor for hospitalisation in the first year of life.4 Also, in our patients, infants with HMD and needing mechanical ventilation were more frequently hospitalised and probably are the group which needs most attention.",
