When evaluating the patient characteristics we found a high percentage of the hospitalised children having an underlying illness. Prematurity was the most common and a probable risk factor for more serious RV disease. Secondly, the median age in the hospitalised children was significantly lower than the median age at sampling for non-hospitalised children. As younger children are more vulnerable for hospitalisation this was not an unexpected finding. However, as our study is not a matched case-control study we cannot exclude an age-specific distribution of RV species and types. Ct-values differed significantly between non-hospitalised and hospitalised children. We found a higher viral load (indicated by lower Ct values) in hospitalised children, suggesting that a higher viral load might lead to more severe disease [15], [23]. This has been described in other studies as well [24] . Another influencing factor might be infection with co-pathogens. The frequency of viral co-infections was comparable in both groups, but a bacterial co-infection was detected more often in severely ill children. Our study indicates that bacterial co-infection, and especially co-infection with respiratory pathogens such as M. catarrhalis and H. influenzae, might be an important contribution to disease severity.",
