These may involve praying to God or meditating (Christian centering prayer, Buddhist mindfulness meditation, or Hindu transcendental meditation); reading sacred scriptures such as the Bible, Qur\u2019an, Bhagavad Gita, or Dhammapada; spending time thinking about and applying these sacred scriptures to one\u2019s life; memorizing scriptures or reciting them aloud; listening to or watching inspirational programs on radio, podcast, or TV; or otherwise engaging in private religious activities that are encouraged by one\u2019s faith tradition. Although attending religious services together is not possible at the present time due to COVID-19 restrictions, people of faith can often congregate \u201cvirtually\u201d by participating in services that are now being live streamed. When life was \u201cnormal,\u201d one might have been so busy that there was no time for spiritual matters, with hobbies, jobs, housework, recreational activities, social and family activities filling up every moment of the day. Now that normal activities have virtually come to a halt, there is lots of time for activities that will help build spiritual health.",

In practical application of these research findings, one physician\u2014when treating a religious patient with panic attacks due to fear of the coronavirus\u2014prescribed clonazepam three times a day. With that prescription, he instructed the patient to read Psalm 91 out loud immediately after taking each dose. As noted above, Psalm 91 mentions protection from \u201cpestilence\u201d no fewer than three times for those who take refuge in God.",

Christians were those who stepped up to care for Christians and non-Christians alike, often risking their own lives to do so. This made such an impression on non-Christians that they began to convert to the Christian faith. They saw something different about these Christians and wanted what they had. Many priests today in Italy have likewise lost their lives caring for those infected with the coronavirus in that country. There is now the same opportunity for those of all professions and religious faiths to spread God\u2019s love and hope to family members, neighbors, friends, and anyone else in need, while minimally increasing the risk of their own safety.",

The importance of following this directive is without saying, but this should not mean becoming socially distant from one another. People cannot give each other physical hugs or handshakes now to prevent the coronavirus spread. However, there are ways of providing hugs and handshakes through the technology that is now available. For example, there is a Marco Polo phone app that allows recording of a video message. The recipient can watch it whenever desired (and also video record a message and send it back to the person). This app informs the individual when a message arrives by a red dot on the app and a beep. This may be especially helpful for less tech-savvy relatives who are isolated at home. If a family member does not have a cell phone, consider purchasing one and teaching the person how to use it (perhaps doing this by landline). Is it not amazing that at this time in history there is technology capable of connecting virtually everyone during this crucial period? From a faith perspective, God has allowed the coronavirus pandemic for some reason at this particular time in history, and it coincides with the present booming age of technology that connects people both near and far at virtually no cost or risk to health.",

There are hundreds of thousands of older adults in nursing homes, and given the new ban on visitors, they too are at risk. Many nursing homes are even making residents stay in their rooms, which means no congregating with other residents for meals, socializing, or recreational activities. Once an individual (or individuals) is identified that meet this criterion, contact them and ask if they would like to have a spiritual partner during these unsettling times (many will likely say yes, often enthusiastically). Partnering means contacting them at times that are agreed on, perhaps several times per day. This time would be spent praying for and with one another, listening, and sharing God\u2019s love and hope. This will not only give a sense of meaning and purpose to those dreary endless hours spent at home, but also dispel boredom that can easily creep in when unable to get out of the house. The technology is now available to do this from the safety of home. Not only will this spread a message of love and hope, but will enhance the initiator\u2019s own health and well-being by doing something good that the scriptures of all faith traditions say will be rewarded many-fold both in this life and the next.",

Anyone with a cold, especially if they have a fever and cough, should not have close physical contact with others (especially with older adults, anyone with underlying medical problems, or anyone at all, including family members). Caring for others can now be done remotely, as noted above. Reckless also means not following the simple steps that can help to prevent the spread of the coronavirus: (1) washing hands regularly with soap for 20\u201330 s every couple hours, especially after having any contact with others; (2) being careful to wash hands after coming into contact with anything that comes into the home (cardboard boxes, mail, food products); (3) not touching the face until after hands have been thoroughly washed; (4) wearing a facemask when out in public, as is currently recommended; (5) keeping a safe physical distance from others (to avoid transmitting or receiving airborne droplets that may contain the coronavirus); (6) not physically congregating with several people at a time, including family members; and finally, and (7) staying physically healthy and resistant to infection.",

Moderate intensity exercise is known to improve immune function and potentially reduce risk and severity of respiratory viral infection (Martin et al. 2009), similar to the infection that the coronavirus causes. Exercise seven days per week at the same time each day to make it a habit, and spend time briefly outdoors each day to get sun and fresh air.

Well hydrated means drinking a minimum of 32\u201364 oz twice daily. Most fluids should be consumed in morning shortly after rising and again around noontime prior to lunch. Doing so will also increase urinary output requiring several trips to the restroom, thus increasing physical activity which helps to avoid deconditioning as well (for those who cannot or will not exercise). Fluid intake after about 3:00 in the afternoon should be minimal, and no fluids should be consumed after 6:00 PM.

These studies are often conducted in individuals with compromised immune systems, such as older adults (Koenig et al. 1997; Koenig and Cohen 2002; Lutgendorf et al. 2004; Kurita et al. 2011) and those with HIV/AIDS, other infections, or immune system disorders (see below). This research shows that religious involvement is associated with a reduction in pro-inflammatory cytokine levels and an increase in immune functions necessary to resist infection.",

More directly, research in both healthy and vulnerable populations (e.g., those with HIV/AIDS, hepatitis, sexually transmitted diseases) have found that religious activity is associated with decreased rates of infection (Merchant et al. 2003; Kagimu et al. 2012; Chen and VanderWeele 2018; Watson et al. 2019; Krause 2019); decreased viral load (concentration of viruses in blood) among those already infected (Ironson et al. 2006, 2011, 2017; Van Wagoner et al. 2016); and better outcomes from viral infection over time (hepatitis C infection; Raghavan et al. 2013). Furthermore, at least one randomized controlled trial has shown improved immune functions among those with viral infection in response to spiritual interventions (McCain et al. 2008). Oman and Riley (2018) provide a recent summary of studies examining the impact of religious or spiritual involvement on immune competence, infection risk behavior, rates of infection, adherence to treatments for infections, and programs for prevention or treatment of infection.",
