            "text": "At the end of December 2019, Chinese public health officials announced to the World Health Organization (WHO) that a new and unknown virus caused a disease with symptoms similar to pneumonia in Wuhan (Khan & Fahad, 2020). They immediately recognized that the virus was from the coronavirus (CoV) family and was rapidly spreading out of Wuhan. The WHO is seeking to identify, track and restrict a new disease from the CoV family called CoV disease 2019 (COVID-19), which is still affecting many peoples in China and outbreaking to other countries. This type of CoV is also spreading in other countries such as Iran, Italy and South Korea (Memberships & Join, 2020). With the number of CoVs currently increasing, the researchers are trying to figure out what is the main cause of the virus to spread easily and widely. Some genetic and structural analyzes have identified the main characteristic of the virus, which could increase the efficiency and speed of virus transmission between human cells (Belouzard et al., 2012; Jaimes & Whittaker, 2018). Also, some groups are investigating a receptor on cell membranes that introduces the fusion of new CoV into human HCs (Veljkovic et al., 2020; Zheng & Perlman, 2018). Both the cellular and protein receptors of the virus provide potential targets for development of drugs against pathogen (Kaufmann et al., 2018; Papadopoulos et al., 2017). However, some well-developed experiments and promising data are required to ensure such a mechanism. Indeed, exploring the transmission mechanism of the virus is important to prevent its future outbreaks. The COVID-19 spreads much more easily than the SARS virus and infecting easily the people have been already infected with SARS (Jiang et al., 2020; Lai et al., 2020; Liu et al., 2020).",

Genomic analysis of the new CoV has shown that its SP differs from that of other viruses (Du et al., 2017; Li, 2016), indicating that the protein has a site activated by a HC enzyme called furin (Millet & Whittaker, 2015) (Figure 1).",

            "text": "This enzyme normally cleaves and activates a wide range of substrates in different organisms (Figure 2a) (Braun & Sauter, 2019). This enzyme is found in many human tissues, including the lungs, liver and small intestine, which means that the virus has the potential to invade different organs (Belouzard et al., 2012; Heald-Sargent & Gallagher, 2012; Scamuffa et al., 2006). The furin activation site (FAS) makes the new CoV much different in cell entry than SARS, and probably affects the stability of the virus and, consequently, the transmission process (Li et al., 2015; Millet & Whittaker, 2014; Yamada & Liu, 2009). Several other groups have also identified the site of activation to investigate how the virus spreads among humans (Basak et al., 2007; Kim et al., 2016; Kleine-Weber et al., 2018; Porter et al., 2014). They pointed out that other viruses including influenza family viruses contain these sites that are easily spread among people (Huang et al., 2011; Menachery et al., 2014; Tang et al., 2020; Vlasak et al., 1988 ). But in these viruses, the site of activation is found on a protein called haemagglutinin, not on the SP (Bernstein et al., 2020; Koopman et al., 2019; Lai et al., 2019). However, some other researchers are more cautious about the significant role of the activation site in helping CoV and facilitating its spread (Amer et al., 2018; Van Doremalen et al., 2013). Other scientists are also skeptical of comparing the influenza viral activation sites with the new CoV transmission channels (Heymann & Shindo, 2020; Yang et al., 2005). The haemagglutinin protein at the surface of influenza viruses is not the same as the SP in CoVs (Yin et al., 2016; Zmora et al., 2018).",

Scientist have pointed out that among several targets, the SP as fusogenic envelope glycoprotein of SARS CoV, is a promising site for treatment of infectious diseases (Li et al., 2018; Licitra et al., 2013). SPs mediate CoV fusion and the entry of the CoV genetic material into the human cell (Senathilake et al., 2020; Struck et al., 2012). Afterwards, a SP-selective strategy, when used at the initial phase of CoV infection is probably considered as a potential approach to mitigate infection inside the body. The furin induces the cleavage of SPs at the RNTR761\u2193EV site (Bergeron et al., 2005) and results in the production of two segments: S1 and S2 (Figure 2b); each segment shows its own biological activity. The S1 segment known as the globular section of SP mediates attachment of CoV to the receptor, ACE-2 with dominance of \u03b1-helix structures (Li et al., 2003). A 193-resdiue fragment of SP has been determined as the protein-binding site (Wong et al., 2004). S2, known as the biomembrane-anchored stalk domain and leads to CoV\u2013human cell fusion (Prabakaran et al., 2004). Some other experiments also exhibited that other biomembrane-anchored proprotein convertases (PrCos), namely PoCo5B and PoCo7 cleave SPs.",

A conventional approach to explore the CoV life cycle is to clone the FP gene into an appropriate vector, transfect the cells, incubate with the related protease, purify the protein and carry out the protein assays (Cong et al., 2019; Li et al., 2019). This approach shows a number of drawbacks: the need of viral genome, expensive synthesizing process, availability of monoclonal antibodies, and time-consuming process. Therefore, Jaimes et al.

The theoretical analysis of FCS and the case alignment of CoV family determined that FCS may be a crucial site of CoV evolution. ZJ01 showed mutations close to FCS (F1-2), which led to alterations in the conformation and the charge distribution on the surface of the SP. They employed Adaptive Poisson-Boltzmann Solver (APBS) analysis and exhibited that the binding site of furin was covered with a number of negative residues (Figure 4a). The F1 site of SARS-CoV-2, namely ZJ01, Wuhan-Hu-1 and RaTG13 were almost covered with positive moieties while SARS was covered by both mixed negative and positive residues. F1 site of ZJ01 showed more positive charge distribution in its head and more negative residues in its basal site in comparison with Wuhan-Hu-1. The F2 site of GZ02 had negative charge distribution while F2 site of Wuhan-Hu-1 and RaTG13 demonstrated a limited level of positive moieties. ZJ01 displayed more positive charge distribution in F2 site than the other species, most likely derived from gene deletion. GZ02 presented a number of negative charge distribution in F3 site while limited negative charge distribution was observed in SARS-CoV-2-associated virus (Figure 4a). Hence, they deduced that, the mutation close to FCS site lead to a significant change in the protein conformation and surface charges, which further affected its interaction with the ligands (Xi et al., 2020).",

In a point of fact, ACE-2 can induce a protective impact against CoV-stimulated lung damage by enhancing the formation of the vasodilator angiotensin (Imai et al., 2005). Indeed, the attachment of the SP of the CoV to the ACE-2 triggers a reduction in the levels of ACE-2 (Kuba et al., 2005), most likely stimulating lung injury. Xu et al. (2017) reported that vitamin D can be used as a potential candidate to mitigate lipopolysaccharide-induced acute lung damage via control of the renin-angiotensin system. Therefore, it could be suggested that vitamin D can control the outbreak of CoV through inhibition of ACE-2. Gurwitz (2020) claimed that angiotensin receptor blockers can be used as promising SARS-CoV-2 therapeutics. Also, it has been suggested that probable way of fighting the CoV could be the injection of ACE-2 which will result in the preventing the interaction of the CoV to off-infected cells and replenishing ACE-2 in infected cells (Zhang et al., 2020). Some other studies have indicated a close correlation between hypertension and heart disease and CoV infection which may be associated with the prescription of ACE-2 inhibitors (Fang et al., 2020). Indeed, treatment of CoV infection with ACE-2 inhibitors leads to an upregulation of this receptor especially by epithelial cells of the lung followed by facilitation of infection with different kinds of SARS-CoV (Li et al., 2017).",

Although, a great deal of research is required to exhibit experimentally this assertion, the inhibition of furin or furin-like enzymes may display a promising anti-viral platform. Actually, it has been recently demonstrated that HCs infected by several kinds of viruses stimulate an interferon-based activity to block the enzymatic activity of furin-like enzymes (Lodermeyer et al., 2013). It was also revealed that virus infection triggers the upregulation of some receptors (Braun & Sauter, 2019; Kim et al., 2015) that inhibit the furin trafficking in post-Golgi compartments.",

Furthermore, it can be deduced that small molecular and ligands inhibitors that can limit the interaction of ACE-2 with RBD should be developed to combat the spreading CoV epidemic (Chen et al., 2020; Senathilake et al., 2020). Isolating and cultivating CoV in vitro may not usually be practical or demand particular facilities that are not accessible in every bioresearch laboratory. Therefore, there is a necessity for developing some strategies to assay the human health response to spread of emerging CoV that can be performed in normal laboratory systems. Apart from viruses targeting humans, several animal viruses also have identical FPs, hence, exhibiting the comparable features than their human sites. Purifying these kinds of viruses can display some inevitable biological challenges, making the application of pioneering devices to examine them unavoidable.",

In recent years, compounds affecting different stages of the virus\u2019s life cycle have been introduced and a wide range of anti-viral strategies have been proposed, including inhibiting the entry and stopping of viral replication or targeting intracellular signal transduction pathways (Peeri et al., 2020). In recent decades, targeting viral proteins inducing humoral and cellular immune responses have received a great deal of attention in development of anti-viral compounds (Zumla et al., 2016). The ability of biomolecular systems such as cytokines, interleukins, and bacterial derivatives to improve immunogenicity and xenografts is being evaluated as a novel strategy, although immune system regulatory proteins have received more attention.",

To transfer their genetic materials into the human HCs, they are dependent on the interaction of their envelope with the human HC biomembrane. The SP mediates CoV entry and conducts the interaction of CoV with receptor (ACE-2) on the HCs as well as mediating the fusion of HC biomembrane and viral envelope. Also, SARS-CoV-2 furin substrate site can facilitate the cleavage of the SP. This review discussed an overview on the role of ACE-2 and furin in the binding of CoV with HC biomembrane mediated by SP. Also, we surveyed the contribution of FCS on the CoV outbreak. Moreover, we considered the ability of small molecular inhibitors on the limiting the interaction of ACE-2 and furin with SP to be used as promising antiviral drugs or vaccines. This paper may provide promising information about the development of useful strategies to combat the spreading CoV epidemic.",
