Recent clinical data have confirmed the usefulness of these medications for the treatment of lupus erythematosus. Current research has further enhanced our understanding of the pharmacologic mechanisms of action of these drugs involving inhibition of endosomal toll-like receptor (TLR) signaling limiting B cell and dendritic cell activation. With this understanding, the use of these medications in dermatology is broadening. This article highlights the different antimalarials used within dermatology through their pharmacologic properties and mechanism of action, as well as indicating their clinical uses. In addition, contraindications, adverse effects, and possible drug interactions of antimalarials are reviewed.",

As well, Page effectively treated 18 cutaneous lupus patients who were resistant to treatment with quinine (5) . In the 1950s the 4-aminoquinoline derivatives of quinine, such as chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine, became well-accepted drugs for the management of skin lupus as they were found to be more effective with more tolerable side effects in lupus patients (6) . Since then, antimalarials have been shown to be effective in treating a variety of skin conditions.",

The isoquinoline nucleus has a double benzenelike structure with a chloride atom at position 7 and an alkyl side chain at the 4-amino site. It is a chiral molecule with D and L forms (7) . The clinical relevance of the chiral isoforms remains a subject of debate (8) . The drug is manufactured as a diphosphate (aralen phosphate, resochin) for oral administration or as a hydrochloride for intramuscular injection (in the therapy of malariainduced coma). Approximately 60% of the diphosphate represents the base. It is water soluble and readily absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract. The pharmacokinetics of the drug was reviewed by Krishna and White (9) and by Ducharme (10) . After oral administration, peak plasma concentrations are reached within 8-12 hours. Approximately 60% of the drug in the plasma is bound to protein. Doses of 250 mg daily lead to stable plasma concentrations of 100-500 ng/mL (11) . The drug is deposited in tissues with 200-20,000 times the plasma concentration found in the liver, spleen, kidney, and lung (12) . Significant accumulation of the drug also occurs in leukocytes. Highest concentrations of the drug are found in melanincontaining cells in the retina and skin. As a result of this widespread tissue deposition, there is a large volume or distribution (over 100 L/kg) (9) . Chloroquine undergoes hepatic biotransformation into two active metabolites, desethylchloroquine and bisdesethylchloroquine via the cytochrome P450 enzymes (13, 14) . Renal clearance accounts for half of the total systemic clearance and is increased by acidification of the urine. The pharmacokinetics is complex with plasma levels determined by the rate of distribution rather than by the rate of elimination. When the drug is discontinued after daily dosage for 2 weeks, plasma halflife is initially 6-7 days with a gradual increase to 17 days after 4 weeks and a terminal half-life of 30-60 days (7) . Chloroquine remains in the skin for 6-7 months after cessation of therapy at a time when the drug is no longer detectable in the plasma (11) .",

            "text": "Hydroxychloroquine differs from chloroquine by the presence of a hydroxyl group at the end of the side chain: The N-ethyl substituent is beta-hydroxylated (FIG. 1) . It is available for oral administration as hydroxychloroquine sulfate (plaquenil) of which 200 mg contains 155 mg base in chiral form. Hydroxychloroquine has similar pharmacokinetics to chloroquine with rapid gastrointestinal absorption, a large volume of distribution, and renal elimination. Hydroxychloroquine is N-desethylated by cytochrome P450 enzymes CYP 2D6, 2C8, 3A4 and 3A5 into Ndesethylhydroxychloroquine (15) . Whether genotype differences in these enzymes affect the efficacy or toxicity of hydroxychloroquine is still unknown. Maximal clinical efficacy may take up to 3 -6 months to achieve. Dose loading, with administration of higher doses (up to 1200 mg/day) for the first 6 weeks, has been shown to accelerate clinical response in rheumatoid arthritis (16) , albeit with an increase in incidence of gastrointestinal intolerance. Interestingly, the efficacy of this drug has been correlated with drug blood concentrations in rheumatoid arthritis (17) and in systemic LE. In a recent study, whole blood drug concentrations were measured in 143 unselected systemic lupus patients receiving 400 mg of hydroxychloroquine for at least 6 months (18) . A large variability in whole blood drug concentrations was noted possibly due to poor compliance and as of yet unknown interindividual pharmacokinetic parameters. The mean whole blood concentrations in patients with inactive disease (1079 ng/mL) was significantly higher than in patients with active disease (694 ng/mL) and a low level of blood hydroxychloroquine was a predictor of exacerbation during follow-up, leading the authors to propose individual dosing schedules to maintain whole drug concentrations above 1000 ng/mL. Similar studies are not available for chloroquine. It has been stated, based on therapeutic response in rheumatoid arthritis, that hydroxychloroquine in approximately two-thirds as effective as chloroquine and half as toxic (19) . Both chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine readily cross the placenta. Hydroxychloroquine blood levels in the fetus are similar to those in the mother and are excreted in small amounts in breast milk (20) .",

A summary and new concepts are presented here (FIG. 2) . Antimalarials are lipophilic weak bases that pass easily through plasma membranes in the free base form to accumulate in acidic cytoplasmic vesicles such as lysosomes where they are trapped in a protonated, ionized state (26) . Christian de Duve, the discoverer of lysosomes, termed drugs with such properties lysosomotropic agents (27). As such, partitioning results in concentrations of drug within the lysosome that are up to 1000 times greater than in the culture media. This results in a number of immunologic and nonimmunologic effects. The pH of the lysosome increases from 4 to 6 (28). The alteration in pH results in the inhibition of acidic proteases within the lysosomal compartment and generally diminishes proteolysis (29). This also results in the decreased intracellular processing, glycosylation, and secretion of proteins (30). Furthermore, the morphology of lysosomes is altered, reflecting altered maturation. In patients treated with chloroquine, an increased number of lamellar inclusions is noted within lymphocytes for example. This has been associated with decreased cell functioning such as chemotaxis, phagocytosis and superoxide production by neutrophils (31).",

The foreign antigens are digested within the lysosomal cellular compartment and loaded onto a peptide groove of the class II MHC molecule. Chloroquine interferes with the digestion of these antigens and the subsequent presentation of these antigens to T cells (33). Chloroquine also prevents the dissociation of the invariant chain from the class II MHC molecule. This dissociation must occur for peptide loading to proceed. Thus, chloroquine interferes with class II MHC antigenic peptide loading (34). As self-peptides are thought to be of relatively low affinity to the class II MHC molecules (35), it has been proposed that this process might preferentially diminish responses to self (36). Whereas lysosomotropic agents such as chloroquine have been known to interfere with class II MHCrestricted antigen presentation, they have recently been shown to increase the CD8 T-cell responses against soluble antigens (37): A single 500-mg dose of chloroquine, 1 day prior to hepatitis B vaccine booster dose immunization, increased the CD8 T-cell response to the vaccine. It was shown that interference with soluble antigen degradation in the lysosomes increased export into the cytosol, where the soluble antigen could access the pathway leading to loading of class I MHC molecules for presentation to CD8 T cells. This dichotomous effect (inhibition of CD4 T-cell stimulation and promotion of CD8 T-cell stimulation), which still needs to be demonstrated with chronic antimalarial use, may explain in part the paucity of opportunistic infections during antimalarial therapy.",

A dose-dependent inhibition of TNF-\u03b1 , IL-1 \u03b2 , and IL-6 by endotoxinstimulated whole blood was also noted (39). Although inhibition of T-lymphocyte mediated cytokines such as IL-2, IL-4, and IFN-\u03b3 is described (40), the major cellular target appears to be macrophages and monocytes whose IL-1 and IL-6 production is readily inhibited (41). Monotherapy of SLE patients with chloroquine results in a decrease in serum levels of IL-6, IL-18, and TNF-\u03b1 (42). It has been suggested that antimalarial-induced inhibition of TNF-\u03b1 production, which mainly affects monocytes, may be independent of the lysosomotropic action of the drugs and related to nuclear effects (43). Chloroquine was shown to interfere with phosphorylation of extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERK)1/2 and the ERK-activating kinases mitogen-activating protein/ERK kinase (MEK)1/2 and thus inhibit TNF-\u03b1 production (44). However, many of these assays were conducted using concentrations at or above 10 \u00b5 M , which are higher than attained in vivo and that may also result in mammalian cell growth inhibition.",

            "text": "A more potent effect of the antimalarials has recently been noted on the inhibition of stimulation of the toll-like receptor (TLR) 9 family receptors. TLRs are cellular receptors for microbial products that induce inflammatory responses through activation of the innate immune system (45). Nanomolar rather than micromolar concentrations of chloroquine were shown to potently prevent bacterial DNA-induced IL-6 production by human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (46), an effect now known to be the result of inhibition of TLR-9 signaling. TLR-9, -8, -7, and -3 are all found within the endosomal compartment of antigen-presenting cells and are susceptible to inhibition by lysosomotropic agents. In a recent mouse model, rheumatoid factor production by B cells could be induced by chromatin-containing immune complexes, and this effect required signaling through TLR-9, which could be inhibited by chloroquine (47). In SLE, DNA and DNA-associated auto-antigens were shown to activate auto-reactive B cells via sequential engagement of the B-cell antigen receptor (BCR) and TLR-9. Likewise, TLR-7 signaling promotes the activation of autoreactive B cells by RNA and RNA-associated autoantigens in SLE (48). Furthermore, necrotic synovial cells from RA patients induce pro-inflammatory cytokine and chemokine production by synovial fibroblasts through a TLR-3-mediated mechanism (49). DNA-associated autoantigens also stimulate dendritic cells to produce inflammatory cytokines through TLR-9-mediated signaling (50). All of these events are inhibited by low (and therapeutically relevant) concentrations of antimalarials. Taken together, these observations suggest that chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine have a potent effect on TLR signaling, which may explain their efficacy in the treatment of SLE, RA, and possibly other inflammatory diseases (51,52). As this effect is primarily on antigen-presenting cells which initiate immune reactions, this may account for their delayed onset of action in the clinic (in that previously activated T cells and perhaps B cells are less readily inhibited).",

Quinacrine, but not chloroquine has been shown to affect matrix metalloprotein production by leukocytes (58). Increased nitric oxide synthase activity is noted in endothelial cells following exposure to chloroquine in vitro (59).

With this antimalarial combination treatment, if clinical effect is achieved, then the hydroxychloroquine dosage may be lowered to 200 mg/day after 1 month, as well the quinacrine dosage may be lowered to reduce any side effects. Alternatively, chloroquine 250-500 mg daily (maximum dosage 4 mg/kg lean bodyweight/day) may be used in cases not responding to hydroxychloroquine and can also be combined with quinacrine. The combination of hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine are avoided due to the risk of retinal toxicity.

Low-dose therapy is started with either choroquine 125 mg twice weekly or hydroxychloroquine 100 mg two times weekly, which the dosage is increased depending on the clinical response (89) . Patients are recommended by some authors to be given a test dose of 125-250 mg of chloroquine with examination of liver function tests initially (96) . The use of high-dose hydroxychloroquine consisting of 250 mg three times daily for 3 days has been reported to be used in 72 patients (97) .

Five patients showed complete improvement and four showed partial improvement when receiving only hydroxychloroquine. In addition, when two patients were taken off of hydroxychloroquine, the cutaneous rash flared up and cleared after receiving treatment again. Hydroxychloroquine has also been shown to be effective in childhood dermatomyositis as shown in a study consisting of nine patients with incomplete response to corticosteroids or flaring up when corticosteroids were lowered (103) . With hydroxychloroquine, these patients showed significant improvement in cutaneous symptoms at 3 and 6 months and also had a reduction of proximal and abdominal muscle weakness. Hydroxychloroquine is recommended in the treatment of dermatomyositis with patients having cutaneous lesions not responding to steroids and in patients with cutaneous involvement without any muscle involvement (termed amyopathic dermatomyositis). Recently, the use of combination antimalarial treatment (with this addition of quinacrine to the 4-amino quinolone) has been shown to be of benefit in patients that do not respond to a single 4-amino quinolone antimalarial alone (104) .",

In a study with nine patients that received less than 6.5 mg/kg/day of hydroxychloroquine with a total cumulative dose of greater than 1000 g (1054 -3923 g), no individuals acquired retinal toxicity (149) . The second study being the largest retrospective study on hydroxychloroquine retinal toxicity contained 1207 patients being followed up for 2 years also observed no toxicity in the same dosage range (150). Mackenzie followed up over 900 patients with rheumatoid arthritis over 7 years to determine retinopathy associated with cumulative and daily dosage regimens (151) . From these patients, those that received greater than 1 kg of chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine were further observed to find that the mean daily dosage were: (i) 3.65 mg/kg/day of chloroquine and 6.49 mg/kg/day of hydroxychloroquine in those that did not progress to retinopathy; (ii) 5.11 mg/kg/day of chloroquine and 7.77 mg/kg/day of hydroxychloroquine in those that developed retinopathy. Therefore, Mackenzie concluded in his study that recommended safe dosages for chloroquine is less than 4 mg/kg/day and for hydroxychloroquine is less than 6.5 mg/kg/ day to prevent retinopathy. A review of the literature has shown that chloroquine 250 mg/day is more oculotoxic than hydroxychloroquine 400 mg/ day, whereas quinacrine has a relative lack of retinal toxicity (152, 153) . Only two questionable cases of retinotoxicity have been reported with quinacine use (154, 155) , and thus most specialists do not recommend routine ophthalmologic follow-up of patients on this drug.",

Based on the guidelines, patients are divided into two categories: low-risk patients who receive this lower dosage and have used the drug for \u2264 5 years, and higherrisk patients who have received higher dosages or having other risk factors such as high body fat level, concomitant kidney or liver disease, concomitant retinal disease, or \u2265 60 years of age. Patients should have a baseline ophthalmologic examination within 1 year of starting these medications, which includes examination of the retina through a dilated pupil and testing of the central visual field sensitivity by either a self-testing grid chart (Amsler grid) or an automated field tester (Humphrey 10-2 testing). When patients are in the low-risk category, no further testing is required for 5 years if the initial baseline examination is normal according to the AAO guidelines, whereas patients in the high-risk category are examined annually. If any toxicity appears to develop then more elaborate tests are recommended such as multifocal electroretinography (159) .",

A recent report suggests that cutaneous adverse reactions to antimalarials may be more common in patients with dermatomyositis (where they were noted in roughly 30% of patients treated at one center) than in patients with lupus where the historical reaction rate is roughly 3-10% (170) . Patients that took quinacrine during World War II developed lichenoid eruptions with rates of 1/2000 soldiers on 100 mg daily, and in 1/500 soldiers taking 200 mg daily of therapy (171) . Three of these patients were observed to develop squamous cell carcinoma; however, two of these patients also had radiation therapy and the medication was continued for months to years despite the onset of the eruption.

The combination of hydroxychloroquine treatment with chloroquine should not be given due to potential retinotoxicity (148) . Levels of penicillamine or digoxin may be increased with hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine usage (21) . Metoprolol levels have been shown to increase with usage of hydroxychloroquine (172) . Chloroquine can reduce the bioavailability of ampicillin and increase cyclosporine levels (21) . Kaolin and anti-acids may decrease absorption of chloroquine and therefore the intake of these medications should not be within 4 hours of chloroquine therapy. Antiarrhythmic activity is possible with chloroquine as seen with amiodarone and chlorpromazine, and therefore caution should be used in prescribing these medications concurrently (21) . Cimetidine tends to impair elimination of chloroquine. Simultaneous usage of chloroquine with hepatotoxic drugs increases the risk of hepatotoxicity and use with mefloquine with seizures (173) (174) (175) . Antimalarials interfere with neuromuscular transmission and therefore should not be used in patients with disruption of neuromuscular transmission via predisposing conditions or secondary to medications. Smoking has been reported to inhibit the P450 enzyme system, decreasing the efficacy of antimalarial therapy (176) . Furthermore, nicotine may inhibit the lysosomal uptake of antimalarials (177) . A more recent study showed no difference in effectiveness in smokers; however, there were a lower number of patients in this study that could account for failing to detect a difference (178) .",

When compared with other immunomodulatory agents, antimalarials have a favorable safety profile. The major mode of action now appears to be inhibition of endosomal TLR signaling resulting in reduced B-cell and dendriticcell activation. This mode of action has obvious relevance in these drugs' efficacy in the treatment of LE. This mode of action may also explain the beneficial effects of these drugs in other T-cellmediated dermatoses such as lichen planus and granulomatous dermatoses such as sarcoidosis and granuloma annulare. Our new understanding of the toxicities and modes of action of these drugs may suggest new applications and modified treatment regimens. ",
