            "text": "Because viruses outside their hosts are inert particles, their chances of transmission from host to host are greatly dependent on the degree of their robustness, which allows them to remain infectious during the various conditions they encounter in the environment and foods. Numerous physical, chemical, and biological factors influence virus persistence in the environment (Table 13.2). Some of the primary factors affecting the survival of viruses in liquid environmental matrices are temperature, ionic strength, chemical constituents, microbial antagonism, the sorption status of the virus, and the type of virus. Considerable differences have been observed in the survival of enteric viruses in different types of environmental and food samples. Different behaviors and inactivation rates have been observed not only among viruses of different families and genera, but also among viruses of the same family, genus, and even among similar types or strains of virus. Among the chemical constituents of liquid or semisolid (feces, human night soil, biosolids, and animal manures, etc.) environmental matrices, the amount and type of organic matter and specific antiviral chemicals (such as ammonia at elevated pH levels or natural antimicrobial compounds of fruits) play a role in virus stability. Of the physical factors influencing virus persistence in liquid media, temperature, sunlight, and virus association with solids are among the most important. Soil moisture, temperature, sunlight, and other soil characteristics may influence the persistence of viruses in soil. On inanimate surfaces (or fomites), the most important factors that affect virus stability are the type of virus and surface, relative humidity, moisture content, temperature, composition of the suspending medium, light exposure, and presence of antiviral chemical or biological agents. Most of these factors are also relevant for the ability of viruses to persist in aerosolized droplets, together with the moisture content and the size of the aerosol particles, and the air quality.\n",

However, these techniques are unable to differentiate between infectious and non-infectious particles and, therefore, unsuitable for virus persistence studies. A promising approach to avoid this drawback relies on the use of nucleic acid intercalating dyes such as propidium monoazide (PMA) or ethidium monoazide (EMA) as a sample pretreatment previous to the RT-qPCR. So far, PMA combined with RT-qPCR has successfully been applied to discriminate between infectious and heat-treated non-infectious viruses e.g., poliovirus, coxsackievirus, echovirus and HAV (Parshionikar et al. 2010; S\u00e1nchez et al. 2012; Coudray-Meunier et al. 2013). Moreover, EMA has also been used to distinguish between thermally inactivated MNV and poliovirus suspensions (Kim and Ko 2012).",

Most studies are performed by artificially adding a known amount of virus to a food sample without considering all the mechanisms of attachment involved. For instance, enteric viruses bind to food products by a variety of mechanisms, including ionic and hydrophobic interactions, van der Waals forces, interaction with receptors (e.g. NoV binding to carbohydrates) and uptake into bivalve mollusk and vegetable tissues, which may have an impact on its survival on these food items.",

However, enteric viruses can also attach to the leaf surface and internalize through stoma and cuts on the leaf during direct contact with contaminated water (Wei et al. 2011). Furthermore, a new mechanism of HAV contamination of green onions was proposed by Chancellor et al. 2006. In this study HAV particles were found trapped inside growing green onions taken up intracellularly through the roots, even though survival of the virus was not evaluated. This mechanism has also been described for NoV and NoV surrogates such as MNV, Tulane virus, porcine sapovirus and canine calicivirus on lettuce (Dicaprio et al. 2012; Esseili et al. 2012; Urbanucci et al. 2009; Wei et al. 2011) and green onions and spinach (Hirneisen and Kniel 2013).

As previously mentioned, the most relevant factors affecting virus survival in the water environment are: temperature, virus association with solids, exposure to UV, and the presence of microbiota. The effect of temperature on viral persistence in water may be due to several mechanisms including protein denaturation, RNA damage, and influence on microbial or enzymatic activity (Dimmock 1967; Melnick and Gerba 1980; Deng and Cliver 1995). Early studies pointed to damage to virion proteins as the primary target for viral inactivation at high temperatures, although damage to both protein and RNA occurs at all temperatures (Dimmock 1967). Even though all viruses persist better at lower temperatures than at higher temperatures, some enteric viruses, such as HAV and parvovirus, do exhibit higher thermal resistance than other viruses.",

The increased virus survival in the presence of sediment has important implications in the marine environment, because fecal contamination of coastal areas results in contamination of shellfish harvesting areas, accumulation of solid-associated viruses in sediments with sediments acting as virus reservoirs, and finally accumulation of viruses in shellfish. Additionally, virus uptake by molluskan bivalves is enhanced by the presence of particulate material (Landry et al. 1983).",

However, data on the successful isolation of microorganisms with virucidal properties are scarce (Fujioka et al. 1980; Giron\u00e9s et al. 1990; Bosch et al. 1993). Additionally, the ability of bacteria to inactivate viruses is usually lost while subculturing the microorganisms in the laboratory (Gunderson et al. 1968; Katzenelson 1978), although in a few studies, such bacteria could be subcultured for more than 1 year without losing their antiviral activity (Giron\u00e9s et al. 1990; Bosch et al. 1993). In some studies, the virucidal agents in the tested waters could not be separated from the microorganisms (Shuval et al. 1971; Denis et al. 1977; Fujioka et al. 1980; Ward et al. 1986; Giron\u00e9s et al. 1990), whereas in others the virucidal activity could be separated from the bacteria (Matossian and Garabedian 1967; O\u2019Brien and Newman 1977; Toranzo et al. 1983; Bosch et al. 1993). The antiviral activity seems to be based on proteolytic bacterial enzymes that inactivate virus particles in water by cleavage of viral proteins, thus exposing the viral RNA to nuclease digestion (Toranzo et al. 1983; Giron\u00e9s et al. 1990; Bosch et al. 1993).",

There is a concern about a possible increase in soil-borne diseases in human population, given the land disposal practices of sewage and sewage sludge. In developing countries, untreated domestic wastewater is used in agricultural irrigation, presenting a high risk to farm workers and to consumers of food products irrigated with wastewater (Strauss 1994).

In consequence, viral adsorption increases with increasing clay mineral content (Gerba et al. 1981). The high adsorptive properties of a clay soil will prevent virus transport to another matrix, such as groundwater, whereas coarse soil will not.",

            "text": "Microbial movement in soils is also greatly dependent on the water saturation state. When the soil is saturated, all pores are filled with water, which allows faster virus transport through the soil because virus contact with the soil has been diminished. When the flow is unsaturated, the viruses are in closer contact with the soil, thus promoting virus adsorption to the soil (Santamar\u00eda and Toranzos 2003). Goyal and Gerba (1979) considered soil pH as the single most important factor influencing viral adsorption, although the combined effect of organic matter and clay content, and cation-exchange capacity, could surpass the sole soil pH effect. At ambient conditions, viruses are usually negatively charged, thus being attracted to and entrapped by positively charged material in soil (Sobsey et al. 1980). In neutral and alkaline soil situations, viruses will not bind to any particulate matter and will be allowed to move freely in soil. There are, however, many exceptions to these general rules. Virus absorption to soil is also affected by cation concentrations. Cations favor virus adsorption to soil by reducing their repulsive forces. Sewage wastes provide an environment that enhances virus retention to soil, while this retention would be low in distilled water. As a matter of fact, distilled water may actually lead to the elution of viruses from soils, favoring virus mobilization and transport through soil. On the other hand, soluble organic matter will compete with the virus for soil adsorption sites. Likewise, humic and fulvic acids will also compete with the virus and will reduce the level of adsorption of viruses to the soil (Sobsey and Hickey 1985). Wei et al. (2010) investigated murine norovirus (MNV) and HAV stability on three types of differently treated biosolids at 20 and 4 \u00b0C and they reported that both viruses were inactivated rapidly in alkaline pH biosolids.",

The presence of microorganisms in aerosols generated from wastewater-treatment processes or in treated wastewater for agricultural irrigation is a potential danger to human health (Teltsch et al. 1980; Alvarez et al. 1995). In hospitals, aerosolization of vomit was reported to be of major importance in the transmission of NoV infection during outbreaks, while cleaning vomit or feces from patients did not significantly increase the risk of developing gastroenteritis (Chadwick and McCann 1994). Members of the Caliciviridae family have been reported to be fairly stable in aerosols (Donaldson and Ferris 1976). The most important factors affecting the stability of viruses in the aerosol state are temperature, pH, relative humidity, moisture content, size of the aerosol particle, composition of the suspending medium, sunlight exposure, air quality, and virus type.",

At high relative humidity, surface alteration of the virion has been reported, whereas at low relative humidity virus inactivation appears to be mediated by the removal of structural water molecules. Relative humidity seems to confer a protective effect on aerosolized non-enveloped virus particles. Thus, poliovirus was more stable in aerosol at 22 \u00b0C at high relative humidity than at low relative humidity (Harper 1961). Picornavirus infectious RNA may be detected at all humidity levels, suggesting that virus inactivation is caused by virion capsid damage (Akers and Hatch 1968). High relative humidity and low temperature enhance the persistence of bovine rotavirus in aerosols (Moe and Harper 1983; Ijaz et al. 1985), although simian rotavirus SA11 survival in aerosols seems to be the best at intermediate relative humidity levels (Sattar et al. 1984). In any case, human, simian, and calf rotavirus strains may be detected in aerosols after as long as 10 days (Moe and Harper 1983; Sattar et al. 1984; Ijaz et al. 1985), although discrepancies, probably due to methodological differences, are found among these studies. Aerosolized adenovirus particles also show increased persistence at high relative humidity and low temperature (Miller and Artenstein 1967; Elazhary and Derbyshire 1979).",

Results showed that transfer of both NoV and FCV from stainless steel surfaces to lettuce occurred easily. Recently Lopez et al.

Moisture would mediate suspension of virus particles and facilitate their movement between touching surfaces; drying would reduce this effect. Laboratory studies have shown that viruses persist better in the environment at high relative humidity and at low temperatures (Sattar et al. 1984; Sobsey et al. 1988; Abad et al. 1994; Bidawid et al. 2001a). However, as mentioned above, data on the effect of relative humidity on enteric virus survival is contradictory. These reported differences, particularly affecting rotavirus persistence, are difficult to explain but may be due to differences in the methodologies employed in these studies.",

A variety of enteric viruses have been examined for the effects of chilled temperature on their survival in a range of food matrices (reviewed by Baert et al. 2009) (Table 13.3). Most of the studies found that enteric viruses remained infectious for periods exceeding the shelf-life of products (Table 13.3). On vegetables, Croci et al. (2002) evaluated HAV survival on lettuce, carrots and fennel, reporting complete inactivation of HAV by day 4 and 7 for carrots and fennel, respectively. On lettuce a slight decrease was observed over time. Sun et al. (2012) recently reported that HAV survived more than 20 days during storage at 3\u201310 \u00b0C on surface inoculated green onions. Shieh et al. (2009) investigated the survival of HAV on fresh spinach leaves in moisture- and gas-permeable packages that were stored at 5.4 \u00b0C for up to 42 days, reporting only a 1 log reduction of HAV infectivity over 4 weeks of storage. In shellfish, HAV inoculated in commercially prepared marinated mussels showed a 1.7 log reduction of infectivity after 4 weeks of storage at 4 \u00b0C (Hewitt and Greening 2004).\n",

Persistence of NoV was evaluated by RT-qPCR, showing that NoV GII was less resistant than NoV GI under the tested conditions. However there was no more than 1 log difference in the reductions found for the two NoV genogroups. Likewise, after freezing of inoculated pizza product (7 and 14 days, at \u221218 \u00b0C) and mincemeat (8 days, \u221218 \u00b0C), no significant reductions in the NoV titer pretreated withRNase was observed (Mormann et al. 2010).

They may consist of naturally acidic foods, such as tomatoes\u2019 sauce or fruit juices, or they may be formulated by combining acidic foods with other foods to achieve the desired acidity. Moreover some foods, such as vinegar and certain pickled vegetables, may develop acidity from microbial fermentation. However acidification of food is not a suitable hurdle to control enteric virus in foods since they are highly stable at an acidic pH. For instance, HAV had a high residual infectivity after 2 h of exposure to pH 1 at room temperature, remaining infectious for up to 5 h. HAV remained infectious for 90 min at pH 1 and 38 \u00b0C (Scholz et al. 1989). Similar trends are reported for human NoV, (Mormann et al. 2010) reported only a 1.7 log reduction of NoV titers pretreated with RNase after storage at 6 \u00b0C during 24 days under acid pH conditions in potato salad (pH from 5.0 to 5.5). Furthermore, no reduction in the virus titer was observed for storage in noodle salad (24 days, pH from 5.0 to 5.5) or tomato ketchup (58 days, pH 4.5). In conclusion these data show that acidification is not a suitable strategy to reduce the number of enteric viruses present on food.",

As a consequence, emphasis should be on prevention of contamination by implementing good hygienic, agricultural, and manufacturing practices. Strategies to reduce the risk of foodborne outbreaks of enteric viruses should focus on preventing foods from becoming contaminated. In developing countries, young children should be kept away from areas where fresh produce is grown and harvested. This measure is important for hepatitis A infection, since in developing countries this disease is usually acquired during early childhood as an asymptomatic or mild infection. Education of workers, with an emphasis on hygiene; providing facilities for maintaining cleanliness; and the use of treated water in production and processing will be major deterrents to contamination of food with enteric viruses. Shellfish harvesting areas should be monitored for NoV and HAV contamination.
