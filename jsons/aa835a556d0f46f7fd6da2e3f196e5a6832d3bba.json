Numerous broad-spectrum antivirals have been developed for these purposes. 32 Both dynamin-dependent and dynamin-independent pathways are considered as the routes of influenza cell internalization. 33 The inhibitors to these pathway including Cytochalasin B and D, jasplakinolide, and latruncul A are all specific inhibitors to the internalization of influenza. 34 There are accumulated evidence to confirm that activation of PI3K promotes virus internalization. 35 The interplay of influenza virus and receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) of host cell can promote this pathway and facilitate viral uptake. 36 However, one should be cautious about potential benefit of RTK inhibitors as potential antiviral agents, as a limited number of RTKs can be manipulated by chemical inhibitors or siRNAs at the same time. 36 For most enveloped viruses, the low-pH environment of endosome is not only triggers the fusion between endosomes and virions, but also causes dissociation of viral ribonucleoprotein complexes (vRNPs) from the capsid, which allows for its subsequent import into the nucleus and the start of viral replication. 37, 38 Thus, blocking endosomal acidification can also interfere with viral infection. Saliphenylhalamide, concanamycin A, archazolid B, diphyllin, and bafilomycin A1 are all endosomal acidification inhibitors which may abrogate influenza viral infection through inhibiting cellular vacuolar ATPase (vATPase) or vacuolar-type proton (V-H \u00fe ) pump of endosome. [39] [40] [41] Among them, saliphenylhalamide (SaliPhe) can effectively inhibit several wild type of influenza viruses, including pandemic swine-origin influenza virus, highly pathogenic H5N1 avian influenza virus, and oseltamivir-resistant seasonal H1N1 influenza virus. 41 Moreover, it protected 62.5% of mice against a lethal challenge of a mouse-adapted influenza strain. 41 Thus, these endosomal acidification inhibitors with even better selective indices may become candidates for the treatment of viral infections in the future.",

Unfortunately, most of the current human and avian influenza viruses are amantadine-or rimantadine-resistant due to drug overuse. 52-54 However, Wang et al offer a glimmer of hope to the development of M2 inhibitors. 55 They discovered a novel M2 proton channel inhibitor which is effective against both the wild-type and the most prevalent drug-resistant mutant (S31N) from influenza A virus.",

Cyclophilin inhibitors such as Cyclosporin A can also inhibit the propagation of influenza virus by interfering the assembly or budding of influenza virus besides interfering with viral RNA synthesis in A549 cells. 84, 85 In the final release process of influenza virus, NA enables progeny virus to be cleaved from its receptor and spread to other cells. 86 Thus, the NA inhibitors can prevent the influenza from spreading further by blocking the release of progeny virion. 87 Four commercial NA inhibitors (oseltamivir, zanamivir, peramivir, and laninamivir) have been approved for use in humans. 2 Among these NA inhibitors, laninamivir has an extremely long persisting time in the lungs, increasing the prospect of the long-acting antiviral that can effectively prevent influenza infection with a single dose. 88 The emergence of NA-inhibitor-resistant influenza strains can be a substantial challenge to antiviral therapy in the future. 89 Although there is no direct evidence to confirm that the development of resistance have correlations to the wide use of oseltamivir, the resistant viruses would acquire more chances of transmissibility under drug-selection pressure compared with the drug-sensitive strains. 11",

Because of the the similarity of clinical symptoms to respiratory viral infections, rapid and sensitive diagnoses are essential for early viral identification and subsequently cost-effective monitoring of antivirals in clinical trials. The automated and multiplex NAAT may help to solve these problems, and this method is anticipated to generalize its applications in the future. There are still many challenges and unanswered questions about the development of antivirals. Several potent agents have been developed to target viral proteins or cellular factors essential for virus replication. However, they generally have yet to pass through clinical trials to show antiviral evidence in humans. On the other hand, the existing antiviral therapies also face the challenges of drug resistance and nonspecific side effects. Therefore, there is an urgent need for novel drugs and combination therapies. Efforts should be made to design and develop new antivirals that specifically target the basic steps of viral life cycle, including attachment, endocytosis, replication, assembly, budding, release, and cellular processes. The efficacy, viral resistance, mutual effect, and toxicity of combined usage of antivirals need to be clarified.",
