            "text": "Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) uses the S1 B domain of its spike protein to bind to dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4), its functional receptor, and its S1 A domain to bind to sialic acids. The tissue localization of DPP4 in humans, bats, camelids, pigs, and rabbits generally correlates with MERS-CoV tropism, highlighting the role of DPP4 in virus pathogenesis and transmission. However, MERS-CoV S1 A does not indiscriminately bind to all \u24232,3-sialic acids, and the species-specific binding and tissue distribution of these sialic acids in different MERS-CoV-susceptible species have not been investigated. We established a novel method to detect these sialic acids on tissue sections of various organs of different susceptible species by using nanoparticles displaying multivalent MERS-CoV S1 A . We found that the nanoparticles specifically bound to the nasal epithelial cells of dromedary camels, type II pneumocytes in human lungs, and the intestinal epithelial cells of common pipistrelle bats. Desialylation by neuraminidase abolished nanoparticle binding and significantly reduced MERS-CoV infection in primary susceptible cells. In contrast, S1 A nanoparticles did not bind to the intestinal epithelium of serotine bats and frugivorous bat species, nor did they bind to the nasal epithelium of pigs and rabbits. Both pigs and rabbits have been shown to shed less infectious virus than dromedary camels and do not transmit the virus via either contact or airborne routes. Our results depict species-specific colocalization of MERS-CoV entry and attachment receptors, which may be relevant in the transmission and pathogenesis of MERS-CoV. IMPORTANCE MERS-CoV uses the S1 B domain of its spike protein to attach to its host receptor, dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4). The tissue localization of DPP4 has been mapped in different susceptible species. On the other hand, the S1 A domain, the N-terminal domain of this spike protein, preferentially binds to several glycotopes of \u24232,3-sialic acids, the attachment factor of MERS-CoV. Here we show, using a novel method, that the S1 A domain specifically binds to the nasal epithelium of dromedary camels, alveolar epithelium of humans, and intestinal epithelium of common pipistrelle bats. In contrast, it does not bind to the nasal epithelium of pigs or rabbits, nor does it bind to the intestinal epithelium of serotine bats and frugivorous bat species. This finding supports the importance of the S1 A domain in MERS-CoV infection and tropism, suggests its role in transmission, and highlights its potential use as a component of novel vaccine candidates.",

Two of these domains, S1 A and S1 B , are involved in binding to host cell surface molecules during the attachment phase. The S1 A domain preferentially binds to several glycotopes of \u24232,3-sialic acids, while the S1 B domain recognizes a host exopeptidase named dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4), the viral receptor (4, 5) . The absence of DPP4 renders cells insusceptible to MERS-CoV (4) . Meanwhile, elimination of sialic acids in susceptible cell lines significantly reduces MERS-CoV infection (5) . These findings indicated that besides DPP4, the functional entry receptor of MERS-CoV, \u24232,3-sialic acids act as attachment receptors (4, 5) .",

It is expressed in the nasal epithelium of camelids, pigs, and rabbits, in which MERS-CoV causes upper respiratory tract infection (6) (7) (8) (9) (10) (11) (12) . In the human respiratory tract, it is mainly expressed in type II pneumocytes in the lungs (8, 13) , in line with clinical data showing that in humans, MERS-CoV mainly replicates in the lower respiratory tract (14) (15) (16) . In common pipistrelle bats, a potential reservoir for MERS-CoV-like viruses, DPP4 is scarcely detected in the respiratory tract but abundantly present in the intestinal tract (17) . Accordingly, MERS-CoV-like viruses are detected mostly in fecal samples of this species as well as in other insectivorous bat species (18) (19) (20) . Sheep, on the other hand, do not seem to express DPP4 in their respiratory tract and thus hardly shed infectious virus and did not seroconvert upon experimental intranasal MERS-CoV inoculation (7, 21) . Epidemiological studies did not reveal MERS-CoV-seropositive sheep in the field, except for one study using sheep sera obtained from Senegal (22) (23) (24) (25) . Altogether, these data support the role of DPP4 in determining the host range and tissue tropism of MERS-CoV.",

However, it is important to note that MERS-CoV S1 A does not indiscriminately bind to all \u24232,3-sialic acids. It does not recognize those with 5-N-glycosylation or 9-O-acetylation but preferentially binds 5-N-acetyl-modified sialic acids (5) . Among these \u24232,3-linked, N-acetyl-modified sialic acids, MERS-CoV S1 A predominantly binds to short, sulfated, \u24232,3-linked monosialosaccharides and to long, branched, di-and triantennary \u24232,3-linked sialic acids, with a minimum extension of 3 N-acetyl-D-lactosamine tandem repeats (5) . These glycotopes were previously identified by glycan array analysis using nanoparticles displaying multivalent MERS-CoV S1 A (5). Here, using these nanoparticles, we developed a histochemistry-based technique to map the MERS-CoVrecognized glycotopes in the tissues of different susceptible species. The results of our study offer further insight into the importance of these glycotopes in MERS-CoV host range, tropism, and transmission.",

The nasal epithelia of dromedary camels express DPP4 and are susceptible to MERS-CoV upon experimental inoculation (8, 27) . Recent studies revealed that these tissues also express \u24232,3-sialic acids based on Maackia amurensis lectin II binding (5) . However, this lectin binds to a broad range of modified \u24232,3-sialic acids and thus may not represent a specific marker for glycotopes recognized by MERS-CoV S1 A (28) . In order to map these glycotopes, we displayed MERS-CoV S1 A in a multivalent manner using 60-meric self-assembled nanoparticles generated from the lumazine synthase protein of the bacterium Aquifex aeolicus (np-S1 A ) (5) and subsequently used these nanoparticles to set up a histochemistry assay. We previously showed that both np-S1 A and MERS-CoV virions can agglutinate human erythrocytes, while dimeric MERS-CoV S1 A cannot, indicating that multivalent presentation is necessary for the hemagglutination phenotype of MERS-CoV S1 A . Similarly, np-S1 A , but not dimeric MERS-CoV S1 A , can bind to tissues in our assay. As shown in Fig. 1 , np-S1 A binds specifically to the nasal epithelium of dromedary camels. We found that these glycotopes are expressed in clusters of ciliated and goblet cells in the nasal epithelium in a random multifocal pattern (Fig. 1A) . We determined the binding specificity of np-S1 A by using blank nanoparticles and tissues pretreated with neuraminidase as negative controls (Fig. 1A) . Goblet cells, however, are DPP4 negative and thus are not susceptible to MERS-CoV despite expressing these glycotopes (Fig. 1B) . The nasal tissues used for the np-S1 A binding experiment, DPP4 detection, and periodic acid-Schiff staining were obtained from noninfected dromedary camels, while those used to visualize both np-S1 A binding and MERS-CoV nucleoprotein were obtained from MERS-CoV-infected dromedary camels. The tissues of these animals were collected during a previous study (27) .",

We confirmed its specific binding to the S1 A domain through S1, S1 B , and S1 A enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs). While the control nanobody (29) was negative in all FIG 1 MERS-CoV S1 A binds specifically to the nasal epithelium of dromedary camels.

The identified S1 A nanobody inhibited np-S1 A binding to nasal epithelial cells, whereas the S1 Breactive nanobody did not, further confirming the np-S1 A binding specificity and the potential role of S1 A -specific antibodies in blocking MERS-CoV attachment (Fig. 1A) . MERS-CoV S1 A does not bind to the nasal epithelium of pigs and rabbits. Similar to dromedary camels, pigs and rabbits also develop upper respiratory tract infection upon MERS-CoV inoculation. However, both pigs and rabbits shed less infectious virus (mainly between 10 2 and 10 3 50% tissue culture infectious doses [TCID 50 ]/ml) than do dromedary camels (between 10 4 and 10 5 TCID 50 /ml) postinoculation (6, 7, 9-11, 27, 30) . In line with these findings, we found smaller numbers of infected nasal epithelial cells in the nasal tissues of these MERS-CoV-infected pigs and rabbits than in dromedary camels (Fig. 2 ). Using the nasal tissues obtained from mock-infected dromedary camels, pigs, and rabbits, we show that DPP4 is highly expressed in the nasal epithelium of these three species (Fig. 2) , indicating that the differences in infectious virus shedding observed in these three species are not likely due to differences in DPP4 expression. Subsequent screening for the presence of \u24232,3-sialic acids in these tissues using lectin histochemistry revealed that the nasal epithelium of pigs does not express these sialic acids, in accordance with the results of previous studies (31, 32) . In contrast, these sialic acids were detected in the nasal epithelium of dromedary camels and rabbits (Fig. 2) . We then used np-S1 A to test for the presence of MERS-CoV-recognized glycotopes in the nasal epithelium of pigs and rabbits and found that unlike dromedary camels, both species do not express these glycotopes (Fig. 2) . The absence of these glycotopes in the nasal epithelium of rabbits, despite the abundant presence of \u24232,3-sialic acids, further supports the fine specificity of A domain binding.",

Altogether, these studies suggest the susceptibility of various bat species to MERS-CoV-like viruses. However, not all susceptible bat species may act as hosts for these viruses, as they were preferentially detected in insectivorous bats (18) (19) (20) . One study conducted a large screening of over 5,000 insectivorous bats, from Ghana, Ukraine, Romania, Germany, and The Netherlands, showing that these viruses were mainly detected in Nycteris bats and pipistrelle bats (20) . Using np-S1 A , we investigated whether MERS-CoV-recognized glycotopes were differentially expressed in the intestinal epithelium of insectivorous bats, i.e., common pipistrelle (Pipistrellus pipistrellus) and serotine (Eptesicus serotinus) bats, and frugivorous bats, i.e., Gambian epauletted (Epomophorus gambianus) and Egyptian fruit (Rousettus aegyptiacus) bats. We observed that np-S1 A binds to the apical surface of the intestinal epithelium of common pipistrelle bats in both villi and crypts, while in others, np-S1 A binds only to the intestinal crypts (Fig. 3) .",

In line with these observations, DPP4 is expressed in the lower airway epithelium but not in the upper airway epithelium. It was detected in bronchiolar and alveolar epithelial cells but primarily in type II pneumocytes (Fig. 4A) , consistent with previous studies (8, 13) . Our lectin histochemistry staining showed that both bronchiolar epithelial cells and type II pneumocytes express \u24232,3-sialic acids (26) . Both cell types also express MERS-CoV-recognized glycotopes, as indicated by the binding of np-S1 A (Fig. 4B ). Using immunofluorescence, we show that DPP4 expression and np-S1 A binding colocalize in the same alveolar epithelial cells in the human lung (Fig. 4C) .",

This domain initiates infection by binding to host cell surface molecules, either proteinaceous, sialoglycan based, or both (41) . The S1 proteins of feline coronavirus, transmissible gastroenterovirus, and MERS-CoV have been demonstrated to have dual-binding specificity, allowing them to engage both sialoglycans and proteinaceous molecules (5, 38, (41) (42) (43) (44) (45) . We have previously reported that for MERS-CoV, this dual binding is facilitated by distinct domains of its S1 protein, i.e., S1 A and S1 B (4, 5) . The S1 B domain binds DPP4, the functional receptor of MERS-CoV (38) . DPP4 has been demonstrated to have a major influence on viral host range and tropism since its tissue localization varies between species (7, 8, 13, 17, 33, 38, (46) (47) (48) . It is detected in the nasal epithelium of camelids, pigs, and rabbits (7, 8) . In bats, it is mainly expressed in the small intestinal epithelium of common pipistrelle and serotine bats and in both the respiratory and intestinal epithelia of Gambian epauletted and Egyptian fruit bats (17) . Meanwhile, in the human airways, it is present merely in the lower respiratory tract epithelium, particularly in type II pneumocytes (8, 13) . Besides DPP4, MERS-CoV preferentially binds \u24232,3-linked sialic acids via its S1 A domain and uses these sialic acids as an attachment factor (5). Using nanoparticles displaying a multivalent S1 A domain, we show that the tissue localization of these glycotopes varies between various tissues in susceptible species. The S1 A domain bound to the nasal epithelium of dromedary camels and type II pneumocytes in human lungs but not the nasal epithelium of pigs and rabbits. Binding of particles to other molecules besides sialic acids such as mucus and extracellular factors that are removed during the preparation of tissue sections as a result of the boiling procedure, however, cannot be excluded.",

            "text": "Previous studies have shown that MERS-CoV-inoculated pigs and rabbits shed less infectious virus than did dromedary camels (6, 7, 10, 11, 27) . In addition, these animals did not transmit the virus via either contact or airborne routes (30, 49) . In contrast, MERS-CoV is easily transmitted among dromedary camels (12, (50) (51) (52) (53) . The absence of MERS-CoV-recognized glycotopes in the nasal epithelium of pigs and rabbits might render them less permissive to MERS-CoV, thus shedding less infectious virus, which subsequently limited virus transmission. This is supported by our finding that the loss of these glycotopes, e.g., through desialylation, could significantly reduce MERS-CoV infection (5) . However, it is important to note that the expression of other factors, such as proteases and interferons, may also influence MERS-CoV replication and transmission. MERS-CoV has been reported to use host cell proteases, such as TMPRSS2, furin, and cathepsins, to mediate fusion to host cells (54) (55) (56) . The virus has been shown to be sensitive to type I interferon, an essential host innate immune cytokine (5, (54) (55) (56) (57) (58) . Thus, the absence of these proteases and the presence of an inhibiting host innate immune response could effectively limit MERS-CoV replication and transmission, in combination with the absence of MERS-CoV-recognized glycotopes (5, (54) (55) (56) (57) (58) . The importance of glycotopes in MERS-CoV transmission, either solely or in combination with other factors, remains to be further elucidated. These studies would likely require experimental infection of camelids, particularly dromedary camels (50, 51, 59, 60) . Our data also show that besides their presence in the respiratory tract of dromedary camels and humans, MERS-CoV-recognized glycotopes are expressed at the apical The MERS-CoV receptor, DPP4, is expressed in the nasal epithelium of dromedary camels, while in the lungs, it is mainly expressed in endothelial cells. In the human respiratory tract, DPP4 is expressed in bronchiolar epithelial cells (arrowhead) and type II pneumocytes (arrow) in the lungs but not in the nasal epithelium. (B) \u24232,3-Sialic acid expression and MERS-CoV S1 A binding are also detected in human bronchiolar epithelial cells (arrowheads) and type II pneumocytes (arrows). DPP4 expression, \u24232,3-sialic acids, and MERS-CoV S1 A binding are indicated in red. (C) In human alveoli, DPP4 expression (red) colocalizes in the same cells where MERS-CoV S1 A binds (green). Pictures of the nasal epithelium were taken at a \u03eb400 magnification, and those of the alveoli were taken at a \u03eb1,000 magnification. surface of the villi and crypts of the intestinal epithelium of common pipistrelle bats. Interestingly, in serotine bats and both Gambian epauleted and Egyptian fruit bats, these glycotopes are detected merely in the intestinal crypts. This finding further supports the belief that insectivorous bats are one of the natural hosts of MERS-CoV-like viruses (18) (19) (20) and also suggests that not all insectivorous bats express the \u24232,3-sialic acid glycotopes recognized by MERS-CoV in their intestines. However, how sialic acid abundance and distribution in the intestine relate to infection by MERS-CoV-like viruses in various bat species remains to be investigated. Such studies would likely rely on the availability of primary bat intestinal cell culture or bat intestinal organoids, since experiments in insectivorous bats are difficult to perform, partly due to legal restrictions.",

These glycotopes and DPP4 are both expressed in the nasal ciliated epithelial cells of dromedary camels, type II pneumocytes of humans, and intestinal epithelial cells of common pipistrelle bats, providing further evidence that these tissues are the main replication sites of MERS-CoV in the respective species. This study corroborates \u24232,3-sialic acid glycotopes as an important attachment factor for MERS-CoV (5) and highlights the necessity to further understand their role in MERS-CoV pathogenesis and transmission. Importantly, our results also imply that the MERS-CoV S1 A domain should be considered a target for vaccines (61, 62) . ",

Use of these materials for research purposes is regulated according to human tissue and medical research under the code of conduct for responsible use (64) . Dromedary camel, pig, and rabbit FFPE nasal tissues, both MERS-CoV infected and mock infected, were obtained from previous studies. The dromedary camels and pigs were inoculated via the intranasal route with 10 7 tissue culture infectious doses (TCID 50 ), while the rabbits were inoculated with 10 6 TCID 50 via the intranasal route and 4 \u03eb 10 6 TCID 50 via the intratracheal route. Mock-infected animals were inoculated with cell culture medium. Infected animals were all sacrificed at day 4 postinoculation (6, 7, 27) . Bat FFPE intestinal tissues were also obtained from a previous study (17) . Tissues of common pipistrelle and serotine bats were obtained from bats that were stranded or severely wounded and admitted to an official local bat shelter in The Netherlands. The Gambian and Egyptian fruit bats used in this study originated from free-ranging populations in Ghana. The animals were euthanized and necropsied by licensed veterinarians. The bat tissues included in this study were histologically normal as determined by using hematoxylin-eosin staining prior to our experiment.",

Briefly, the paraffin-embedded tissues were deparaffinized using xylene, hydrated using graded concentrations of alcohol, boiled in 10 mM citric acid buffer (pH 6) for 15 min, and subsequently incubated in 3% H 2 O 2 for 10 min and in 5% normal goat serum for 30 min before staining with antibodies. This protocol has been more thoroughly described in previous studies (7, 8, 13, 17) . Periodic acid-Schiff staining was performed by deparaffinizing and hydrating the tissue slides, subsequently incubating them in a periodic acid solution for 5 min and Schiff's reagent for 15 min, and counterstaining them with Gill's hematoxylin for 1 min, with water rinsing between steps. This protocol has also been used in our previous study (7) . Expression of \u24232,3-sialic acids was detected using biotinylated Maackia amurensis lectin II (Vector Labs, Burlingame, CA, USA) at a 1:800 dilution and streptavidin-horseradish peroxidase (HRP) at a 1:300 dilution, both diluted in 1\u03eb Trisbuffered saline containing 0.1 M MnCl 2 , 1 M MgCl 2 , and 0.1 M CaCl 2 , and then subsequently visualized using 3-amino-9-ethylcarbazole and counterstained with hematoxylin. Detection of S1 A binding on the tissues was performed using nanoparticles displaying a multivalent S1 A domain (np-S1 A ) and a Strep-tag generated in a previous study (5) . The tissues were boiled in 10 mM citric acid buffer (pH 6) for 15 min and blocked with 5% normal goat serum (Dako, Glostrup, Denmark) before staining with 3 g/ml np-S1 A overnight at 4\u00b0C. Tissues that were stained with an equal concentration (3 g/ml) of blank nanoparticles and those that were pretreated with 800 mU/ml neuraminidase from Vibrio cholerae (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) for 4 h at 37\u00b0C were used as negative controls. Additional controls were performed by staining tissues with np-S1 A previously incubated for 1 h at 37\u00b0C with either anti-S1 A , anti-S1 B , or control nanobodies at a 15-g/ml concentration. These nanobodies were obtained from a nanobody library generated in a previous study (29) . These tissues were subsequently stained with rabbit anti-Strep-tag sera generated in-house and goat anti-rabbit IgG-HRP (Dako, Glostrup, Denmark), each at a 1:100 dilution, for 1 h at room temperature and then visualized with 3-amino-9-ethylcarbazole and counterstained with hematoxylin. For immunofluorescence staining, fluorescence-conjugated secondary antibody was applied in the experiment, i.e., goat anti-rabbit IgG conjugated with Alexa Fluor 488 and goat anti-mouse IgG conjugated with Alexa Fluor 594 (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA, USA), both at a 1:250 dilution, with a 1-h incubation at room temperature.",
