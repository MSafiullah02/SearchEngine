His argument was that if you and your immune system survived a given infection once, then why wouldn\u2019t you survive it a second time? You wouldn\u2019t need a better response for that. And of course, if you did not survive the first infection, having developed memory would be irrelevant.",

We are currently witnessing a pandemic spread of a novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, for which no one, neither old or young, has any form of immunological memory. Everyone thus depends on the strength of the primary immune response, either humoral and/or cellular, we don\u2019t know yet, for survival.",

The older ones, starting at 40, are hospitalized, may require intensive care, and can die from the consequences of COVID-19. Apparently, their immune systems are too weak to eradicate this novel virus in time. Would their immune systems be clogged with (for this infection) useless memory cells, hindering a fast and adequate primary immune response? Young, na\u00efve immune systems learn faster to combat this virus, just like young children are better at learning a foreign language because their brains are not yet congested with vague memories of other languages.",
