In forest areas, a cycle including primates and mosquitoes also exist\n6\n. To date, two manifestations, dengue fever and dengue hemorrhagic fever are known\n4\n, \n7\n. The symptoms are same among the four serotypes. Once immunity is developed in a human, it remains life\u2010long and re\u2010infection with the same serotype does not occur. However other serotypes may then cause disease because of the incomplete protection of the first infection. More than tens of millions of people have dengue fever and more than hundreds of thousands of people are reported to have dengue hemorrhagic fever every year. Dengue virus is approximately 11 kb positive single stranded RNA virus. It consists of structural proteins of core, membrane and envelope, and seven non\u2010structural proteins. Envelope protein is the target of neutralizing antibody and hemagglutinin inhibition antibody. Serotypes of dengue virus 1, 2, 3, and 4 are originally classified using antiserum, but recently they have also been classified with envelope gene analyzes. The similarity of envelope gene is more than 90% at the same serotype and 65% at a different serotype. Moreover, dengue virus serotype 1, 2, 3 and 4 are divided into three, six, four and one genotypes, respectively\n8\n. There are common and different genotypes in serotypes 1\u22123 in Asia, Africa, Pacific islands and Caribbean islands. Some genotypes appear in specific areas during a limited period each year. Variation of envelope gene affects the virulence of these viruses, and other structural and non\u2010structural proteins might also affect the virulence\n7\n. Host immune response also affects the virulence of these viruses. At present, there is no clear explanation for the dengue and dengue hemorrhagic fever.",

Each segment codes L protein (polymerase), envelope protein (G1 and G2) and Nucleoprotein (NP). The molecular epidemiological analysis is mainly done in nucleotides of M gene. Three different clusters were discovered: (1) Hantaan virus, Dodrava virus, Seoul virus and Thailand virus from Murinae rodents; (2) Puumala virus from Arvicolinae rodents which cause hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome; and (3) Sin Nombre virus, New York virus, Bayou virus, Black Creek Canal virus, Andes virus, Lagna Negra virus from Sigmodontinae rodents which causes hantavirus pulmonary syndrome\n24\n, \n25\n.",

Respiratory syndrome is common in pigs but convulsions, abnormal movement and miscarriage are also recognized. The mortality rate for this virus is low. The virus infects dogs, cats and horses with the rise of the antibody level. The virus reached Singapore via pigs imported from Malaysia. More than 10 humans were infected and one person died. Hendra virus is similar to Nipah virus and was discovered in horses and spread in Australia in 1994\n27\n. It was transmitted to humans and caused respiratory symptoms.
