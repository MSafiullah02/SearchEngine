            "text": "Bovine viral diarrhea virus 1 and 2 (BVDV-1 and BVDV-2) belong to the genus Pestivirus of the Flaviviridae family (Simmonds et al., 2011), together with Classical swine fever virus (CSFV), and Border disease virus (BDV). Pestiviruses are enveloped single-stranded positive RNA viruses with a genome composed by a single open reading frame (ORF), flanked by 5\u2032- and 3\u2032-untranslated regions (UTRs). Transcription of the single ORF leads to the synthesis of a polyprotein that gives origin to 12 smaller proteins through cleavage by cellular and viral proteases: Npro, C, Erns, E1, E2, p7, NS2/NS3, NS4A, NS4B, NS5A, NS5B (Simmonds et al., 2011). The 5\u2032UTR, Npro, and E2 regions are widely used for sequence comparison and phylogenetic analysis (Ridpath et al., 1994, Harasawa and Giangaspero, 1998, Schirrmeier et al., 2004, Liu et al., 2009). Two BVDV biotypes have been identified, namely cytopathogenic (cp) and non-cytopathogenic (noncp), both involved in the pathogenesis of mucosal disease (MD), a fatal form of BVDV infection in persistently infected (PI) calves. Acute BVDV infections can cause different clinical pictures, including transient pyrexia, leucopenia, oculonasal discharge, respiratory distress, diarrhea, and reproductive failure (Brownlie et al., 1984, Bolin et al., 1985).",

            "text": "Due to the economical impact of pestivirus infection in cattle herd, the main goal of diagnostic is a rapid and reliable detection of animals with acute or persistent infection. Several molecular assays have been developed for detection of bovine pestiviruses. A 5\u2032UTR RT-PCR assay, largely used for pestivirus molecular screening (Vilcek et al., 1994), was not able to detect the novel HoBi-like pestivirus, due to a nucleotide mismatch at the 3\u2032 end of the forward primer (Decaro et al., 2012b). Whether the real-time RT-PCR assays developed for detection of pestiviruses (Young et al., 2006, La Rocca and Sandvik, 2009, Gaede et al., 2005) are able to detect HoBi-like pestiviruses has not been assessed. An assay was able to detect the prototype strain D32/00_\u2018HoBi\u2019 (Hoffmann et al., 2006) and two additional HoBi-like viruses contaminating FCS batches (St\u00e5hl et al., 2010), but it was not validated methodically with field samples. In addition, a nucleotide mismatch at the 3\u2032 end of the probe with respect to the European HoBi-like reference strains might severely affect the assay sensitivity. A real-time RT-PCR assay for specific detection of HoBi-like viruses has been developed in recent years, but this assay does not detect simultaneously BVDV-1 and BVDV-2 and cross-reaction may occur for high-titer BVDV-2 samples (Decaro et al., 2012b, Decaro et al., 2013b). In addition, two commercially available real-time RT-PCR assays proved to detect HoBi-like viruses, but with different efficiency on the basis of the sample typology (Bauermann et al., 2014).",

BVDV infection in cattle has a different outcome based on the age, and the immunological and reproductive status of infected animals. This includes subclinical infections, immunosuppression, acute diarrhea, respiratory disease, reproductive disorders, and mucosal disease in persistently infected calves (Baker, 1995, Ridpath, 2010). While BVDV-1 and BVDV-2 have been known to circulate in cattle for some decades, HoBi-like pestivirus emerged as bovine pathogen only a few years ago (Bauermann et al., 2013). Reports on HoBi-like pestivirus infections and related diseases are progressively increasing (Cortez et al., 2006, Kampa et al., 2010, Decaro et al., 2011, Decaro et al., 2012a, Decaro et al., 2012c, Decaro et al., 2013a, Decaro et al., 2014, Weber et al., 2014, Haider et al., 2014, Mishra et al., 2014), and it is not clear if the existing diagnostic assays are able to detect efficiently this emerging group of pestiviruses (Schirrmeier et al., 2004, Decaro et al., 2010). Although there are several molecular methods for diagnosis of pestivirus infection (Bhudevi and Weinstock, 2003, Young et al., 2006, La Rocca and Sandvik, 2009, Yan et al., 2011, Fan et al., 2012, Zhang et al., 2014), only some assays have been demonstrated to be able to detect HoBi-like pestiviruses (Bauermann et al., 2013, Bauermann et al., 2014).",

An exogenous IC was selected instead of an endogenous IC, such as glyceraldehydes-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, 18SrRNA, or \u03b2-actin, since bovine RNA cannot be detected easily in cell-free samples (such as urines). However, even when not using any IC, dilution of extracts from samples rich in DNA, such as EDTA\u2013blood, should prevent PCR inhibition.",

This protocol had been found to fail or to detect with low efficiency HoBi-like strains due to the presence of a mismatch at the 3\u2032 end of primer 324 that prevents the correct primer annealing (Bauermann et al., 2013). Whether the higher efficiency observed in our study was due to a higher complementarity of the primer binding region of the Italian strains to primer 324 is unclear, although the HoBi-like strains circulating in Italy are strictly related to the Southern American viruses (Decaro et al., 2011, Decaro et al., 2012a, Decaro et al., 2012c, Decaro et al., 2013a, Decaro et al., 2013b).",
