The main symptoms of URI are nasal stuffiness and discharge, sneezing, sore throat, and cough. The presence of low-grade fever is variable and more common in children than in adults. In spite of the benign nature of the illness, URIs cause a substantial economic burden on society in terms of medications, visits to physicians and other healthcare providers, and absenteeism. Young children suffer on average 6-8 and adults 2-4 URIs per year. The occurrence of URI displays a clear seasonal variation. The highest incidence rates are observed in the autumn and winter in temperate regions of the northern hemisphere. In tropical countries, most URIs occur during the rainy season. URIs are usually self-limited illnesses confined to the upper respiratory tract, but occasionally the viral infection spreads to adjacent organs, resulting in different clinical manifestations. Viral URIs may also predispose to bacterial complications. In children, the most common complication of URI is acute otitis media (AOM). The highest incidence of AOM occurs in children between 6 months and 2 years of age. By the age of 2 years, approximately 70% of children have experienced at least one episode of AOM. In adults and the elderly, the most frequent complications of URI are paranasal sinusitis and pneumonia.",

On the other hand, during rhinovirus infection the number of infected cells in the upper respiratory epithelium is limited, and no histopathologic changes have been seen in nasal biopsy specimens from subjects infected with rhinoviruses. The absence of epithelial destruction during rhinovirus infections -the most frequent cause of URIs -suggests that the clinical symptoms of URI are not primarily caused by virus-induced epithelial injury but instead are caused by the inflammatory response of the host.",

The incubation period of URI varies considerably among different viruses, ranging from 12 h to 7 days. A typical illness starts with a sore throat that is shortly accompanied by nasal stuffiness, runny nose, sneezing, and cough. The soreness of the throat often disappears quickly, whereas the initial watery nasal discharge soon turns thicker and more purulent. Usually the severity of the symptoms increases rapidly and peaks within 2-3 days. The average duration of URI is 7-10 days, but in a number of patients some symptoms may still be present after 3 weeks.",

However, the value of this symptom in suspecting AOM is severely limited by the fact that almost half of infants and young children with AOM either do not have earache or they cannot express it to their parents.

In the absence of sinus puncture, facial pain (especially if unilateral), maxillary toothache, postnasal drip, and nasal obstruction or thick nasal discharge for more than 7-10 days are usually thought to be indicative of bacterial sinusitis.

The primary ways of transmission as well as the detailed pathogenetic mechanisms differ among various respiratory viruses.

            "text": "Respiratory viruses gain entrance to epithelial cells by binding to specific receptors on the cells. About 90% of rhinovirus serotypes use intercellular adhesion molecule-1 as their receptor. Viral replication starts rapidly inside the cells, and progeny viruses can be detected within 10 h of viral inoculation. However, not all infections lead to clinical illness. Viral infection of the nasal mucosa results in vasodilation and increased vascular permeability, which, in turn, cause nasal obstruction and discharge that are the hallmark symptoms of URI. Cholinergic stimulation leads to increased mucous gland secretion and sneezing. There is increasing evidence that the clinical symptoms of the patient are primarily caused by the host's inflammatory response. Increased levels of several inflammatory mediators, for example, interleukin (IL)-1, IL-6, IL-8, tumor necrosis factor, leukotrienes, kinins, histamine, and RANTES (regulated upon activation normally T-cell expressed and secreted), have been found in nasal secretions from patients with URI. It has been reported that the concentrations of IL-6 and IL-8 in nasal secretions correlate with the severity of symptoms. The host response mechanisms during respiratory viral infections are, however, very complicated, consisting of a network of factors affecting each other in a timedependent manner, and it is probable that several essential factors still remain to be identified. Viral infection in the nasopharynx results in congestion of the nasopharyngeal mucosa. Congestion in and around the eustachian tube leads to dysfunction of the tube, which is considered the most important factor in the development of AOM. Inflammatory mediators play a key role in disruption of normal eustachian tube function although certain viruses, for example, influenza viruses, can also cause direct damage to the epithelial cells in the eustachian tube. Dysfunction of the eustachian tube results in formation of underpressure in the middle-ear cavity, decreased drainage of middle-ear secretions into the nasopharynx, and loss of protection of the middleear from nasopharyngeal secretions. Eventually, these events lead to microbial invasion of the middle-ear, host inflammatory response in the middle-ear mucosa, and clinical signs and symptoms of AOM.",

This effect is probably more likely due to the anticholinergic rather than the antihistamine features of these drugs. Locally administered ipratropium has also been shown to reduce nasal discharge. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs reduce fever and soreness of the throat. Cough medications are commonly used but their efficacy has not been demonstrated convincingly. Despite corticosteroids being potent anti-inflammatory agents, their intranasal or oral use has not resulted in any clinical benefits. The use of intranasal steroids in children during rhinovirus infection may even increase the risk of AOM. Data on the efficacy of zinc, vitamin C, or echinacea extracts in the treatment of URI are inconclusive. Although it is well known that antibiotics are not effective against viruses and that unnecessary use of antibiotics increases bacterial resistance, antibiotics are frequently used in the treatment of uncomplicated URIs.

            "text": "Although viruses play a key role in the development of AOM, bacteria are often found in samples of middle-ear fluid, and so AOM is usually treated with antibiotics. However, spontaneous resolution of the middle-ear effusion usually occurs within a couple of weeks or months, which has initiated an intense debate on whether antibiotic treatment is necessary in all cases of AOM. Unfortunately, clinically useful indicators to help decide which patients would really benefit from antibiotics are not currently available. The same problem applies to the treatment of sinusitis, in which spontaneous resolution is also frequent and reliable diagnosis of bacterial sinusitis is extremely difficult without sinus puncture.",
