The basic characteristics of eosinophils are understood: among these, the aforementioned staining properties, the fact that they develop from pluripotent progenitors in the bone marrow, and observations related to proliferation, activation, and recruitment to tissues in response to characterized stimuli, such as the cytokines, interleukin (IL)-5, and eotaxins 1, 2, and 3, the latter known by their systematic names, CC chemokine ligand (CCL)11, CCL24, and CCL26. Most researchers also agree that, under homeostatic conditions, eosinophils spend only a brief time in the peripheral blood and reside in one of several distinct peripheral tissues, notably in the gastrointestinal tract. However, when inflammation ensues, eosinophil development in the bone marrow is accelerated, and large numbers of eosinophils leave the bone marrow, enter the bloodstream, and eventually are recruited to and accumulate in any one of a number of peripheral tissues where survival is prolonged .", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Introduction"}, {"text": "At this writing, much of our understanding of eosinophil function both in health and in disease remains uncertain.

Likewise, eosinophils are recruited to and activated in lung tissue as part of the pathophysiology of specific types of asthma (Wenzel, 2012) .

Eosinophils can be readily distinguished from the more prevalent neutrophils in peripheral blood by virtue of their bilobed nuclei and large specific granules ( Figure 1 ). Large specific granules of human eosinophils contain four major proteins: the eosinophil peroxidase (EPX), major basic protein (MBP), and ribonucleases eosinophil cationic protein (ECP) and eosinophil-derived neurotoxin (EDN) (reviewed in Acharya and Ackerman, 2014) . These granules also store numerous cytokines, enzymes, and growth factors. Other prominent features include primary granules that contain Charcot-Leyden crystal protein (galectin-10) and lipid bodies, which are the sites of synthesis of cysteinyl leukotrienes, thromboxane, and prostaglandins. Eosinophils have been identified and characterized in all vertebrate species, but their morphology, repertoire of cell surface receptors, and intracellular contents can vary significantly from one another (Balla et al., 2010; McGarry, 2013; Lee et al., 2010) .

Notable interactions are those that involve members of the GATA family, including GATA-1 and GATA-2, also CCAAT-binding proteins, such as C/EBPa and C/EBP\u03b5, as well as PU.1. Expression and overexpression of GATA-1 or GATA-2 promote eosinophil commitment and differentiation in myeloid progenitor cells, and deletion of a GATA-binding enhancer site in the mouse Gata1 gene results in unique loss of the eosinophil lineage (Yu et al., 2002) . Functional interactions between GATA-1, PU.1, and C/EBP\u03b5 have been reported in eosinophil promyelocyte cell lines, and more recently, Bedi et al. (2009) identified both activator and repressor isoforms of C/EBP\u03b5 that modulate the differentiation of human CD34 \u00fe progenitor cells into eosinophils in vitro. However, all of these transcription factors also have roles in supporting the development of other hematopoietic lineages. Although there are no known transcription factors that are uniquely dedicated to promoting eosinophil lineage commitment, a recent report by Bettigole et al.

The most prominent example is the ill-fated clinical trial of a formalin-inactivated RSV vaccine, which has been reviewed extensively (Castilow et al., 2007) . Briefly, it has been concluded that nonneutralizing, nonprotective antibodies developed in children immunized with the formalininactivated virus, and, upon encountering a natural RSV challenge, the vaccinated children developed a hypersensitivity response to the virus antigens, characterized by bronchoconstriction and severe pneumonia with pronounced tissue eosinophils.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 246, "end": 269, "text": "(Castilow et al., 2007)", "ref_id": "BIBREF12"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Eosinophils, Viruses, and Antiviral Vaccines"}, {"text": "Gene-deletion and cytokine-depletion mouse model studies all point to Th2 cytokines as crucial to recruiting eosinophils to the lungs and airways in response to formalininactivated RSV (Rosenberg et al., 2009) , and the overriding assumption was that eosinophils were contributing specifically to negative physiologic sequelae. This question has been explored in a series of experiments by Knudson et al. (2015) using formalin-fixed RSV antigens.

These features are common to sites of allergic inflammation (lung, skin, gastrointestinal tract), to lung and liver granulomata associated with helminth infection, responses to pathogens, as well as other sites at which eosinophilic infiltration may be observed (e.g., solid tumors, muscle degeneration; see Table 1 ).
