Knowledge of diseases circulating in wildlife populations can be important not only for conservation and livestock production but also for public health, and in this article we review current knowledge of viral diseases of the wild boar, emphasizing the effect on populations and the r\u00f4le that the wild boar may play as a viral disease reservoir for domestic pigs. Special attention will be paid to diseases listed as notifiable by the Office International des Epizooties (OIE). The distribution and ecological features that are of importance for a better understanding of the effects of viral diseases on wild boar population dynamics and pathogen circulation among wild populations are also addressed.",

As a result of introductions, they are also found in areas far from their original distribution (Lever, 1994). In most areas where the wild boar has been introduced, hybridization with free-roaming domestic pigs has led to crossbreeding, producing what is often referred to as a feral pig, feral swine or feral hog. Feral pigs are common in the Southern USA, Australia and New Zealand (Mayer and Brisbin, 1991, Oliver and Brisbin, 1993, Waithman et al., 1999, Woodal, 1983). In this article, the term \u201cwild boar\u201d will be used both for the European wild boar and for feral pigs; in specific cases, the European wild boar and the feral pig will be distinguished as a consequence of their areas of distribution.",

(2001) observed only mild temperature increases, some sneezing, slight nasal discharge and conjunctivitis in wild boars experimentally infected with an ADV strain of wild boar origin although after immunosuppressive treatment the animals showed severe respiratory signs and died or were euthanased. Hahn et al. (1997) concluded that ADV strains of feral pig origin were attenuated when compared to those of domestic pigs. Obviously, new and more virulent ADV strains could have consequences in the population dynamics of wild boars, especially in dense populations.",

Firstly, when the domestic pig and wild boar coexist and CSF is then eradicated from the domestic pig population, the disease is not maintained in the wild boar. Secondly, when CSF virus has been intentionally introduced in feral pig populations, the disease is not self-maintained. Thirdly, when information about the origin of a CSF outbreak in wild boars has been correctly collected, human interference was apparent. Notwithstanding this thesis, all CSF virus strains isolated from wild boars in Germany in the 1990s were also isolated in domestic pigs from the same locations. Moreover, 92% of the primary outbreaks in domestic pigs were located in regions where CSF was endemic among the wild boar populations, and it was considered that 60% of the outbreaks were due to direct or indirect contacts with wild boars (Moennig et al., 1999). Similar observations have also been reported in Italy (Rutili, 1997, Ferrari et al., 1998).",

The infection spread to the Iberian Peninsula, first in Portugal (Manso Ribeiro et al., 1963) and later into Spain (Polo Jover and Sanchez Botija, 1961), and since then it has appeared in several South and Central American countries and Sardinia. ASF is included within the single list of diseases notifiable to the OIE. High morbidity and mortality is reported during ASF outbreaks in domestic swine, leading to economic losses not only due to high animal mortality but also to the restrictions in trade of animals and their products.",

The scarcity of knowledge of the sanitary status of wild boar populations in regard to HEV outside Japan makes it impossible to establish either the impact of the disease among wild boar or the possible r\u00f4le of the wild boar as a putative HEV reservoir for the domestic pig. However, the relative widespread HEV infection in domestic pigs in Europe (Banks et al., 2004, De Deus et al., 2007) suggests that to find HEV in European wild boar populations would not be surprising. Indeed there is recent information that HEV may already have been found (N. De Deus, personal communication).",

The virus has been reported to be present in almost 100% of domestic pig herds in many different countries (McKeown et al., 2004).

TTV is considered non-pathogenic for all species where it has been found, but swine TTV genogroup 2 has been found more prevalent in PMWS affected pigs than in non-affected pigs (Kekarainen et al., 2006).",

There is also a lack of information on pathogenesis, clinical manifestation, epidemiology and prevention and control methods of viral diseases in wild boar.
