            "text": "The World Health Organisation (WHO) declared the rapid spread of cases of COVID-19 a pandemic on 11 th March, 2020. The COVID-19 pandemic is a challenging situation for the general population and especially for eye care practitioners working in close proximity to patients [1] [2] [3] . At the beginning of March 2020, different authorities for example the \"Zentral Verband f\u00fcr Augenoptik und Optometrie\" (ZVA, national association of optics and optometry, Germany) and the College of Optometrists (UK) [4] or the \"Berufsgenossenschaft\" (BG, German employer`s liability insurance association) published special recommendations in terms of personal protective equipment. During the current J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f full lockdown (mid-March to end of April), almost all optometry and optic practices in Germany, Austria and Switzerland were only offering emergency services during restricted opening times. [5] Nevertheless, exit strategies are discussed and it is of interest to know how eye care practitioners plan on protecting themselves against infection of COVID-19 during the upcoming months, after the lockdown phase. During this time there will still be a high risk of infection from CORVID-19 until population immunity (herd immunity) has developed and/or vaccine is available. The aims of this first phase of the project were (i) to evaluate which personal protective equipment eye care practitioners intend to use during the upcoming months and (ii) what they plan on asking their patients to use in their clinical practices. Subsequently, a following survey will evaluated how they are actually working then to see how attitudes may have changed in the meantime. This short paper summarizes the first survey`s results briefly.",

Based on 12 questions, use of personal protective equipment was evaluated in different sub-categories such as fitting contact lenses or doing refractions (i.e. longer duration close working distance tasks; <0.5m, commonly a practitioner is 10-20 minutes at this close distance), anatomical fitting of frames, lens and frame measurements (i.e. close working distance tasks; <0.5m, commonly a practitioner is less than 5 minutes at this close distance) as well as assisting patients in frame choice (i.e. far working distance tasks; ~1m distance). Results: Most eye care practitioners intended to wear surgical masks (44%) or FFP2/3 masks (31%) during refractions, and 39% and 30% during contact lens appointments, respectively. 62% of the eye care practitioners also expected the patients to wear masks during these \"longer duration close working distance tasks\". This number is higher than in \"close working distance tasks\" or \"far working distance tasks\" (figure 1). For all tasks, 90% of the eye care practitioners would in addition to hand washing disinfect their hands, and around 80% expect the patients to also do so.",

It is designed to protect the wearer against the inhalation of both droplets and particles suspended in the air (FFP2 category: masks which filter at least 94% of aerosols (inward leakage < 8%); FFP3 category: masks which filter at least 99% of aerosols (inward leakage < 2%)).

The ZVA also recommend frequent handwashing, avoidance of handshaking, 1.5m distancing if possible, disinfection of surfaces, and cleaning customers' spectacles before adjusting or repairing them. Mask or glove wear or other personal protective equipment when attending to potentially asymptomatic COVID-19 patients was not explicitly recommended, especially as there was a shortage of personal protective equipment. The BG additionally recommend disposable gloves and surgical masks, if available [6] . This survey revealed that eye care practitioners tend to follow these recommendations even more strictly, particularly by intending to ask their patients to use personal protective equipment for some parts of the eye examination or consultation. Most of the eye care practitioners will use hand disinfection and mask wear for eye care practitioners and patients alike. This is interesting, because it was stated in the survey, that hand disinfection does not mean hand washing. A minority of the eye care practitioners intended on using maximal safety levels including face shields, gloves, safety spectacles, overalls and FFP3 masks, in contrast to the other extreme of eye care practitioners, who did not plan on using a greater level of personal protective equipment than before the COVID-19 outbreak.",
