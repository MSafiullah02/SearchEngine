            "text": "Pharmacological characterization of GPCRs is commonly performed in transfected mammalian cells or in cells that endogenously express the receptor of interest (Kenakin 1996). There are, however, several problems of mammalian cell systems. First, mammalian cells normally express various additional GPCRs, which may result in GPCR heteromerization or signaling crosstalk (Breitwieser 2004; Prezeau et al. 2010; Gomes et al. 2016). For example, signaling crosstalk between GPCRs has been described for the G\u03b1i-coupled GABABR and the G\u03b1q-coupled mGlu1AR (Rives et al. 2009). Another example is ACKR1 (atypical chemokine receptor 1), which has been shown to functionally antagonize CCR5 by forming ACKR1/CCR5 heterodimers (Chakera et al. 2008). Second, the presence of other constitutively active receptors may interfere with the analysis of agonist-independent activity of the receptor of interest. For example, the inverse FPR1 agonist cyclosporin H failed to inhibit basal G\u03b1i protein activity in HL-60 cells, indicating that these cells additionally express other constitutively active receptors different from FPR1 (Wenzel-Seifert and Seifert 1993; Seifert and Wenzel-Seifert 2003). Third, promiscuous G protein coupling of GPCRs in the presence of several G protein subtypes may preclude the analysis of GPCR-G protein selectivity (Woehler and Ponimaskin 2009). Finally, some GPCRs are only expressed at low levels in mammalian cells, rendering it difficult to obtain a sufficiently high signal-to-noise ratio in functional and ligand binding assays.",

Sf9 cells are derived from the Sf21 cell line, which had been originally isolated from the pupal ovarian tissue of the American fall army worm (Spodoptera frugiperda). The protein of interest is expressed by infecting Sf9 cells with baculoviruses encoding the corresponding gene. Although Sf9 cells express G\u03b1i-, G\u03b1q-, and G\u03b1s-like proteins, insect cell G\u03b1i is not activated by mammalian GPCRs. This renders Sf9 cells a functionally \u201cG\u03b1i-free\u201d system and permits the analysis of G\u03b1i-coupled receptors without the necessity of pertussis toxin (PTX)-mediated GPCR/G\u03b1i uncoupling. Also, PTX would not be active in Sf9 cells, because it does not enter the cells (Wenzel-Seifert et al. 1998). By contrast, uncoupling of G\u03b1i-coupled GPCRs by PTX in mammalian cells is problematic. Despite entering mammalian cells, PTX is not capable of completely inactivating all G\u03b1i proteins (Wenzel-Seifert and Seifert 1990).",

This results in high signal-to-noise ratios in binding assays and allows the purification of receptor protein, e.g. for crystallization purposes. Finally, as explained below, Sf9 cell membranes expressing large amounts of GPCRs and G proteins can be used to study G protein activation in steady-state GTPase assays and experiments with [35S]GTP\u03b3S ([35S]-labeled guanosine 5\u2032-O-[\u03b3-thio]triphosphate).",

When histamine binds to the hH4R, the receptor protein undergoes a conformational change and interacts with an inactive GDP-bound heterotrimeric G protein (Fig. 2 step 1). This induces GDP release and the formation of the so-called ternary complex, which contains agonist, receptor and guanine-nucleotide-free G protein (Fig. 2, step 2). It is generally accepted that a GPCR exhibits its highest agonist-binding affinity, when it is part of the ternary complex. The interaction between agonist-bound GPCR and G protein promotes GTP binding to the G\u03b1-subunit. This weakens the intermolecular interactions in the G protein and in the ternary complex, breaking the complex up into agonist and GPCR as well as G\u03b1- and G\u03b2\u03b3 subunit (Fig. 2, step 3).\n",

Normally, agonists show their highest affinity to the ternary complex (Fig. 2, step 2) and stabilize the active receptor conformation. Thus, agonistic radioligands preferentially label the G protein-coupled high-affinity receptor population. When two populations of GPCRs with different G protein coupling states occur simultaneously, the saturation or competition curves with agonistic radioligands may become biphasic, which allows the determination of high-affinity and a low-affinity binding constants. This was, e.g., demonstrated for histamine H2R (Houston et al. 2002) as well as for the \u03b22-adrenergic receptor (\u03b22AR) or the dopamine D1R (Gille and Seifert 2003).

Neutral antagonists do not discriminate between active and inactive receptor states and label both receptor conformations with comparable affinity.",

Thus, no GDP-loaded G protein is available anymore for the formation of new ternary complexes resulting in uncoupling of the entire GPCR population.

A detailed protocol for high-affinity agonist binding assays as well as example data for various receptor/G protein systems is provided in book chapters about GPCR/G protein co-expression and fusion protein systems in Sf9 cell membranes (Schneider and Seifert 2010a, b).",

Unlike GTP, however, GTP\u03b3S cannot be hydrolyzed by the intrinsic GTPase activity of G\u03b1 (Gilman 1987), resulting in an accumulation of GTP\u03b3S-bound G\u03b1-subunits. When radiolabeled [35S]GTP\u03b3S is used, the amount of activated G\u03b1 subunits can be quantitated by scintillation counting, allowing the characterization of G\u03b1 activation kinetics (time course of [35S]GTP\u03b3S-G\u03b1 accumulation) and the determination of agonist- and inverse-agonist modulated G\u03b1 activation. When the total ligand-regulated G\u03b1 activation (maximum effect of full agonist minus activation level in the presence of a full inverse agonist) is divided by the B\nmax value from radioligand binding, the so-called coupling factor is obtained.

            "text": "The H1R is ubiquitously expressed, specifically in lung, CNS, and blood vessels. It preferentially couples to G\u03b1q/11 proteins, causing PLC and protein kinase C (PKC) activation as well as inositol-1,4-5-trisphosphate (IP3) formation and intracellular Ca2+ release (Seifert et al. 2013; Panula et al. 2015). The typical signs of a type I allergic reaction like pruritus, increased vascular permeability, and edema are caused by H1R activation. Therefore, administration of H1R antagonists (so-called antihistamines) belongs to the most important anti-allergic therapeutic interventions (Simons and Simons 2011), e.g. for the treatment of allergic rhinitis. The H1R is expressed on various types of immune cells, specifically on T cell subsets and dendritic cells and influences T cell polarization (Neumann et al. 2014). Moreover, as indicated by results from H1R-deficient mice, the H1R plays a role in various models of inflammatory diseases, e.g. nasal allergy, Th2-driven allergic asthma, atopic dermatitis or experimental autoimmune encephalitis (EAE) (Neumann et al. 2014). In the CNS, H1R is involved in the regulation of locomotor activity, emotions, cognitive functions, arousal, sleep and circadian rhythm or pain perception (Schneider et al. 2014a). Moreover, the H1R participates in the modulation of energy consumption, food intake, and respiration. H1R blockade with antagonists increases susceptibility to seizures (Schneider et al. 2014a). Sedation, the most important side effect of brain-penetrating first-generation antihistamines, is caused by antagonism at H1R in the CNS (Simons and Simons 2011; Neumann et al. 2014). The human H1R (hH1R) is endogenously expressed by various human cell lines. HeLa cervix carcinoma cells as well as U373 MG astrocytoma cells are used since more than two decades to study hH1R pharmacology and signal transduction (Seifert et al. 2013). In the following, the results from the characterization of the human H1R in the Sf9 insect cell expression system will be discussed.",

Only co-expression of the hH1R with the regulators of G protein signaling RGS4 and GAIP (G-alpha-interacting protein, RGS19) unmasks an interaction of hH1R with insect cell G\u03b1q, resulting in histamine-induced stimulatory effects of 142% (RGS4) and 126% (GAIP) (Houston et al. 2002). These results indicate that the intrinsic GTPase activity of Sf9 cell G\u03b1q is rate-limiting for hH1R-mediated G protein activation in Sf9 cell membranes. This is probably due to a low number of G proteins relative to hH1R molecules. RGS proteins commonly accelerate the intrinsic GTPase activity of G\u03b1 proteins, which results in a higher turnover and in increased availability of inactive GDP-bound G\u03b1 subunits (Fig. 2).",

This revealed major pharmacological differences between H1R species isoforms. Specifically, some agonistic bulky 2-phenylhistamines and histaprodifens exhibited increased efficacy and up to tenfold higher potency at gpH1R as compared to hH1R (Seifert et al. 2003). Such differences were also observed for antagonists. Most notably, the potency of several arpromidine-type H1R antagonists was up to tenfold higher at gpH1R than at hH1R (Seifert et al. 2003). Mutagenesis experiments were performed to elucidate the molecular basis of these pharmacological species differences. Basing on the hypothesis that smaller amino acid substitutions render the gpH1R binding pocket more flexible than the corresponding site at the hH1R, the amino acids 153 or 433 of the hH1R were mutated into \u201cgpH1R direction\u201d (Phe-153 \u2192 Leu 153 or Ile-433 \u2192 Val 433) (Seifert et al. 2003). Although this attempt was unsuccessful in terms of generating gpH1R-like pharmacology, the mutations dramatically decreased hH1R receptor expression, function, electrophoretic mobility as well as [3H]mepyramine (tritiated 2-((2-(Dimethylamino)ethyl)(p-methoxybenzyl)amino)-pyridine) affinity, suggesting that these amino acid positions are essential for correct folding and expression of the H1R (Seifert et al. 2003). In addition, the hH1R-F153L/I433V double mutant was studied. Although this protein was excellently expressed in Sf9 cell membranes, there were only partial changes in pharmacology. Thus, Phe-153 and Ile-433 cannot fully explain the species difference between hH1R and gpH1R (Seifert et al. 2003).",

To address this hypothesis, wild-type hH1R and gpH1R as well as the chimeric receptors h(gpE2)H1R (hH1R with ECL2 from gpH1R) and h(gpNgpE2)H1R (hH1R with N-terminus and ECL2 from gpH1R) were co-expressed with RGS4 in Sf9 cells and compared in radioligand binding and steady-state GTPase assays (Strasser et al. 2008b). A small inverse agonistic effect of mepyramine suggests that all four receptors show only low constitutive activity. Histamine potency in steady-state GTPase assays decreased in the series hH1R > h(gpE2)H1R > h(gpNgpE2)H1R. Maximum Gq-protein activation by histamine and the \u0394V\nmax/B\nmax ratio (turnover number) was significantly enhanced at h(gpNgpE2)H1R as compared to hH1R, gpH1R, and h(gpE2)H1R, despite a very low expression level of h(gpNgpE2)H1R. This indicates that histamine induces a h(gpNgpE2)H1R conformation which is specifically efficient at activating G proteins (Strasser et al. 2008b). Molecular dynamics simulations suggest that the replacement of N-terminus and ECL2 affect the network of hydrogen bonds between N-terminus, ECL1 and ECL2 and alter the conformation and flexibility of ECL2. Thus, either the replacement of the N-terminus or the combined exchange of N-terminus and ECL2 induces conformational alterations that increase the stimulatory effect of histamine and reduce its potency (Strasser et al. 2008b).",

Previous molecular dynamics simulations with these compounds had suggested that they can adopt two distinct orientations in the gpH2R binding pocket (Strasser et al. 2008a). Thus, the data may be explained by a change in ligand orientation in the series hH1R \u2013 h(gpE2)H1R \u2013 h(gpNgpE2)H1R. Such changes, however, are probably determined early in ligand binding, which can only be addressed by kinetic binding studies (Strasser et al. 2008b).",

Moreover, another study addressing the pharmacology of phenylhistamines and phenoprodifens at human, guinea pig, bovine, and rat H1R identified bulky phenylhistamines with higher potency and affinity at hH1R as compared to gpH1R (Strasser et al. 2009). A comparison of the hypothesized binding modes of these compounds with the binding mode of the previously characterized N\nG-acylated imidazolylpropylguanidine UR-AK57 (N\n1-(3-Cyclohexylbutanoyl)-N\n2-[3-(1H-imidazol-4-yl)propyl]guanidine) (Xie et al. 2006b) suggests that the higher potency at the hH1R is caused by a more pronounced van der Waals interaction with Asn2.61 of hH1R as compared to Ser2.61 of gpH1R (Strasser et al. 2009). Moreover, phenoprodifens seem to adopt two distinctly oriented binding modes that cause the highly conserved Trp6.48, which is part of the toggle switch mechanism of GPCR activation (Shi et al. 2002), to assume either an active or an inactive conformation (Strasser et al. 2009).",

It should be noted, however, that the analysis of H2R-deficient mice yields conflicting results, probably because of the variability of the disease models studied (Neumann et al. 2014). The human histamine H2R (hH2R) has been pharmacologically characterized in both human cells and in the Sf9 cell expression system (Seifert et al. 2013). Neutrophils are specifically well suited for the analysis of hH2R pharmacology, because they are primary cells that can be easily isolated from human blood in large numbers. The hH2R inhibits superoxide anion production induced by chemotactic peptides in neutrophils (Burde et al. 1989, 1990; Reher et al. 2012a) and eosinophils (Reher et al. 2012a). Moreover, H2R activation induces functional differentiation of HL-60 promyelocytes (Klinker et al. 1996). Furthermore, it is discussed that decreased hH2R function may contribute to inflammation in bronchial asthma (Seifert et al. 2013).",

The hH2R did not even activate mammalian G\u03b1q co-expressed in Sf9 cells or fused to the hH2R (Ca2+ assays, high-affinity agonist binding and [35S]GTP\u03b3S binding) (Houston et al. 2002). Surprisingly, not even the hH1R was able to activate co-expressed mammalian G\u03b1q in Sf9 cells. Thus, mammalian G\u03b1q was probably inactive in Sf9 cells, despite high expression levels, and therefore, Sf9 cells are not suited to investigate the interaction of GPCRs with mammalian G\u03b1q (Houston et al. 2002).",

This hypothesis was tested by expressing the mutant hH2R-A271D-Gs\u03b1S as well as the chimeras NgpChH2R-Gs\u03b1S (N-terminus \u2013 TM3 from gpH2R and TM4-C-terminus from hH2R, containing Ala-271) and NhCgpH2R-Gs\u03b1S (N-terminus \u2013 TM3 from hH2R, and TM4-C-terminus from gpH2R, containing Asp-271) in Sf9 cell membranes (Kelley et al. 2001). In fact, steady-state GTPase assay data clearly showed increased potency of guanidines at both hH2R-A271D-Gs\u03b1S and NhCgpH2R-Gs\u03b1S, confirming the importance of Asp-271 in the gpH2R for guanidine binding. Unexpectedly, the efficacies of guanidine-type agonists at hH2R-Gs\u03b1S and NgpChH2R-Gs\u03b1S as well as the more \u201cgpH2R-like\u201d constructs hH2R-A271D-Gs\u03b1S and NhCgpH2R-Gs\u03b1S were lower than at gpH2R. This demonstrates that potency and efficacy are independent properties of the H2R. The modeling and experimental data suggest that an interaction between TM1 (Tyr-17) and TM7 (Asp-271) is important for the stabilization of the guanidine-induced agonistic conformation of the gpH2R and therefore for guanidine efficacy. This interaction is absent in hH2R and in the other constructs analyzed by Kelley et al. (2001).",

Moreover, H3R-deficiency reduces addictive behavior in mouse models of ethanol consumption, which is probably due to the reward-inhibiting function of an increased histamine release (Vanhanen et al. 2013; Schneider et al. 2014b). This renders the H3R an interesting target for the treatment of alcohol addiction (Nuutinen et al. 2012). Despite the decade-long research on H3R pharmacology, only the inverse H3R agonist pitolisant is currently used as an orphan drug to treat narcoleptic patients (Dauvilliers et al. 2013). Mouse models suggest that, in contrast to the other three histamine receptor subtypes, the H3R does not seem to play a major role in immunological processes and inflammation (Neumann et al. 2014).",

When hH3R was expressed in Sf9 cell membranes without any mammalian G protein, the signals induced by histamine and thioperamide were only small, indicating that hH3R-mediated stimulation of insect cell G proteins was virtually absent (Schnell et al. 2010a).

This was explained by the phenomenon of \u201cprotean agonism,\u201d which is the ability of a ligand to induce GPCR conformations with lower G protein-coupling efficiency than the agonist-stimulated or constitutively active receptor (Gbahou et al. 2003). It has been hypothesized that protean agonism of proxyfan is due to functional selectivity, i.e. G protein coupling of the proxyfan-bound hH3R differentiates between various G\u03b1i/o isoforms. The data reported by Schnell et al. (2010a), however, strongly suggest that neither proxyfan nor any other of the tested hH3R ligands exhibits this kind of functional selectivity, at least when the hH3R is co-expressed with or fused to various G\u03b1i/o isoforms in Sf9 cell membranes. One reason for this discrepancy could be the influence of different types of G\u03b2\u03b3 subunits, which was not systematically investigated in Sf9 cells, because in the experiments performed by Schnell et al. (2010a) all hH3R/G\u03b1i/o combinations were uniformly co-expressed with G\u03b21\u03b32. Moreover, specific combinations of various G\u03b1i/o isoforms or cross-talk between signaling pathways could have influenced the results reported by Gbahou et al. (2003) and Krueger et al. (2005).",

A quantitation of rH3R binding sites by radioligand binding with [3H]JNJ-7753707 and of receptor-coupled G\u03b1 subunits by [35S]GTP\u03b3S binding revealed a rH3R/G protein stoichiometry between 1:2 and 1:7 (Schnell et al. 2010b), which is comparable to the properties of the corresponding hH3R membranes (Schnell et al. 2010a). Moreover, similar to the hH3R, the rH3R showed similar high constitutive activity with each of the four G\u03b1i/o subunits as indicated by comparable relative effects of the agonist histamine and the inverse agonist thioperamide (Schnell et al. 2010b). The independence of rH3R pharmacology of the co-expressed G\u03b1i/o type was confirmed by steady-state GTPase experiments.",

To explain this switch in quality of action, molecular modelling studies were performed by docking imoproxifan into the binding site of the active hH3R and the inactive rH3R. The simulations revealed different electrostatic surfaces between TM V and TM III. While the hH3R shows a positive surface potential in this region (NH moiety of Trp6.48), the corresponding part of the rH3R is slightly negatively charged (OH moiety of Thr6.52), which results in different orientations of the ligand at both receptors. Moreover, hH3R differs from rH3R in amino acid position 3.37. Thr3.37 of the hH3R interacts with Glu5.46, making Glu5.46 pointing away from the binding pocket, which creates a binding site for the imoproxifan methyl moiety (Schnell et al. 2010b). By contrast, an alanine in position 3.37 of the rH3R precludes any electrostatic interaction between Glu5.46 and position 3.37.",

Thus, the imoproxifan oxime moiety points downward towards Ala3.40 in hH3R and stabilizes Trp6.48 in its horizontal conformation via a hydrogen bond. By contrast, the oxime moiety is directed upwards in rH3R and interacts with Thr6.52, while the methyl group of imoproxifan fits into a pocket between Val3.40 and Trp6.48. This stabilizes Trp6.48 of rH3R in its vertical conformation. According to the rotamer toggle switch mechanism of GPCR activation (Shi et al. 2002), the horizontal conformation of Trp6.48 corresponds to the active state, while the vertical conformation stabilizes the inactive receptor state.

The inactive state, however, is stabilized by (partial) inverse agonists (Schneider et al. 2010b; Sato et al. 2016). The degree of constitutive activity depends on the intrinsic tendency of the receptor protein to occur in the active state. It is well established that ions are able to modulate GPCR function (Strasser et al. 2015). Specifically, sodium represents an allosteric stabilizer of the inactive receptor conformation and inhibits constitutive activity, which was, e.g., demonstrated for chemoattractant receptors (Seifert and Wenzel-Seifert 2001, 2003).\n",

To address this question, a profile of the effects of various monovalent cations (Li+, Na+, and K+) as well as of different anions (Cl\u2212, Br\u2212, and I\u2212) was determined in steady-state GTPase assays with membranes expressing hH3R plus G\u03b1i2 and G\u03b21\u03b32. The rank order of efficacy was Li+ ~ Na+ ~ K+ < Cl\u2212 < Br\u2212 < I\u2212. This indicates a direct proportionality between anion radii and reduction of basal hH3R activity and shows that anions contribute more to the salt-induced reduction of constitutive activity than cations. Moreover, the different efficacies of the anions exclude the possibility that an increased osmolality may be responsible for the effect on constitutive activity (Schnell and Seifert 2010). Similar results had been previously obtained with the h\u03b22AR-Gs\u03b1L fusion protein, and it had been hypothesized that anions may enhance GDP affinity to the G protein, reducing the ability of the receptor to promote GDP dissociation (Seifert 2001). Interestingly, a comparison of the NaCl effect on hH3R basal activity in membranes co-expressing G\u03b21\u03b32 and various G\u03b1i/o subunits (G\u03b1i1, G\u03b1i2, G\u03b1i3 or G\u03b1i/o) revealed the strongest NaCl-mediated reduction of constitutive activity in the presence of G\u03b1i3 (Schnell and Seifert 2010).",

In the absence of sodium, the D2.50N mutant (co-expressed with G\u03b1i2 and G\u03b21\u03b32) exhibited a reduced number of [3H]NAMH binding sites and an affinity reduction of [3H]NAMH by about 90% as compared to the wild-type hH3R (Schnell and Seifert 2010). Constitutive activity in steady-state GTPase assays was completely eliminated by the D2.50N mutation (co-expressed with G\u03b1i2 and G\u03b21\u03b32) and consequently, neither thioperamide nor NaCl further inhibited basal activity. Interestingly, however, the stimulatory effect of histamine at the D2.50N mutant was highly sensitive to NaCl and was completely eliminated at NaCl concentrations > 90 mM. Most surprisingly, the D2.50N mutation introduced G protein selectivity, as the mutant did not productively interact any more with G\u03b1i3, but still activated G\u03b1i1, G\u03b1i2, and G\u03b1o1. Thus, Asp2.50 seems to play a decisive role in the hH3R/G\u03b1i3-interaction (Schnell and Seifert 2010). In summary, the characterization of the hH3R in the Sf9 cell expression system by Schnell and Seifert (2010) revealed that G\u03b1i3 interacts with hH3R in a very distinct manner as compared to the other tested G\u03b1i/o isoforms (stronger NaCl effect on activity of wild-type hH3R and complete inactivity of the hH3R-D2.50N mutant). Interestingly, the D2.50N mutant was not completely NaCl-insensitive, which indicates that the interaction between ions and hH3R is more complex and cannot be explained by a single interaction site (Schnell and Seifert 2010).",

A potential explanation for this discrepancy was recently offered by Wittmann et al. (2014). A comparison of various human aminergic GPCRs revealed that in the majority of receptors, glycine is the most abundant (80%) amino acid in the sodium binding channel between the ligand binding site and the sodium binding region (Wittmann et al. 2014). This is, however, not the case for hH3R and hH4R. Moreover, in hH4R the glutamine in position 7.42 disrupts a water chain, which is extending from Asp3.32 (orthosteric binding site) to Asp2.50 (allosteric binding site). This might kinetically prevent sodium from binding to the allosteric binding site (Wittmann et al. 2014).",

Binding studies with [3H]histamine revealed a K\nD value of ~10 nM (Schneider et al. 2009), which fits well to the literature range (5\u201320 nM). Steady-state GTPase and [35S]GTP\u03b3S binding experiments confirmed the high constitutive activity of the hH4R, which was effectively inhibited by the inverse agonist thioperamide (Schneider et al. 2009). Surprisingly, thioperamide was not able to suppress [35S]GTP\u03b3S binding in the co-expression system (hH4R + G\u03b1i2 + G\u03b21\u03b32) to the level of control membranes expressing only G\u03b1i2 and G\u03b21\u03b32 (Schneider et al. 2009). This strongly indicates that thioperamide is only a partial H4R inverse agonist and not, as originally suggested in the literature (Lim et al. 2005), a full inverse agonist. The Sf9 cell system provides a \u201cclean\u201d background devoid of mammalian G\u03b1i proteins and their cognate GPCRs. Thus, expression of mammalian G proteins without GPCRs in Sf9 cells provides a valid control for baseline G\u03b1 activity and for the maximum possible effect of a full inverse agonist. In the following, the most important results from the pharmacological characterization of the hH4R in Sf9 cell membranes are discussed. An overview of the most important results is provided in Table 4.\n",

Ternary complex formation, however, is prevented in the presence of GTP\u03b3S which binds to the G\u03b1 subunit like GTP (Gilman 1987), but cannot be hydrolyzed. Thus, GTP\u03b3S disrupts the G protein cycle, resulting in the accumulation of uncoupled inactive GPCRs with reduced agonist affinity. Surprisingly the hH4R shows an active state which is completely independent of G proteins (Schneider et al. 2009). This is supported by the following four observations: First, high-affinity [3H]histamine binding (K\nD and B\nmax) to membranes expressing hH4R, G\u03b1i2, and G\u03b21\u03b32 was retained in the presence of GTP\u03b3S. Second, [3H]histamine binding affinity was almost identical in the hH4R/G\u03b1i2/G\u03b21\u03b32 co-expression system and in Sf9 cell membranes expressing hH4R in the absence of mammalian G proteins. Third, the K\ni values of the inverse hH4R agonists thioperamide and JNJ-7777120 were unaltered in membranes expressing only hH4R, although the two-state model of receptor activation (Fig. 4) suggests that inverse agonist affinity increases, when the receptor is not coupling to G proteins and assumes an inactive state. Finally, steady-state GTPase assays with membranes co-expressing hH4R, G\u03b1i2 and G\u03b21\u03b32 revealed that the constitutive activity of the hH4R is insensitive to sodium ions. According to the standard two-state model of receptor activation depicted in Fig. 4, however, it is expected that Na+ stabilizes the inactive state of a GPCR. This has been shown previously, e.g. for FPR-26 (Wenzel-Seifert et al. 1998; Seifert and Wenzel-Seifert 2001) or the \u03b12-adrenoceptor (Tian and Deth 2000).",

            "text": "The high constitutive activity of the hH4R prompted us to investigate its conformational stability and the stabilizing effect of ligands. In fact, addition of histamine (10 \u03bcM) or thioperamide (1 \u03bcM) to Sf9 cells co-expressing hH4R, G\u03b1i2 and G\u03b21\u03b32 significantly increased the B\nmax value in histamine high-affinity agonist binding assays (Schneider et al. 2009). Interestingly, this effect was not visible in immunoblots, indicating that histamine and thioperamide mainly support the correct folding of hH4R in the cell membrane, but not during intracellular protein synthesis. This was confirmed in experiments, where denaturation of hH4R (co-expressed with G\u03b1i2 and G\u03b21\u03b32) was induced by incubation of the membranes at 37\u00b0C. After 120 min, almost 70% of the histamine binding sites in the ligand-free control were lost, but only 35% in the presence of histamine. Most surprisingly, however, thioperamide increased the B\nmax by 30\u201340%, suggesting that it did not only prevent hH4R denaturation, but even re-folded a priori misfolded receptors. This intriguing \u201crefolding\u201d effect of the inverse agonist thioperamide was confirmed in a two-step assay, during which the receptor was first denatured and then incubated with thioperamide.",

The hH4R-G\u03b1i2 protein co-expressed with G\u03b21\u03b32 in Sf9 cell membranes exhibited linear signaling with a coupling factor of ~1 in [35S]GTP\u03b3S binding assays and a turnover number of ~1 in steady-state GTPase assays. Thus, hH4R exclusively activates the tethered mammalian G protein but not the insect cell G proteins (Schneider et al. 2009). This was additionally supported by the lack of [35S]GTP\u03b3S binding in membranes expressing non-fused hH4R in the absence of mammalian G proteins (Schneider et al. 2009). The K\nD value of [35S]GTP\u03b3S in the presence of the full hH4R agonist histamine or the inverse agonist thioperamide in membranes co-expressing hH4R-G\u03b1i2 and G\u03b21\u03b32 was significantly reduced as compared to the coexpression system, indicating enhanced efficiency of G protein activation (Schneider et al. 2009). A higher GTP affinity of G\u03b1i2 in the fusion protein was also reflected by a significantly decreased K\nM value in the presence of histamine in steady-state GTPase assays. Moreover, a slight increase of constitutive activity in steady-state GTPase assays additionally demonstrates the increased efficiency of G protein activation in the fusion protein system (Schneider et al. 2009). Interestingly, the B\nmax value of the hH4R-G\u03b1i2 fusion protein in immunoblots and [3H]histamine binding assays was increased as compared to the non-fused receptor (Schneider et al. 2009). This suggests a chaperone-like stabilizing effect of G\u03b1i2, favoring membrane insertion of the receptor protein. Incubation of the cell culture with histamine or thioperamide did not further enhance the B\nmax value of the fusion protein in [3H]histamine binding (Schneider et al. 2009), suggesting that the fusion of hH4R to G\u03b1i2 induces already the maximum possible number of correctly folded receptors. An overview of the most important features of the hH4R-G\u03b1i fusion protein in comparison to the co-expression system (hH4R + G\u03b1i2 + G\u03b21\u03b32) is provided in Table 4.",

Although the total protein amount on the Western blot was comparable for both untreated and tunicamycin-treated H4R protein (2.5\u20133 pmol/mg as assessed by using FLAG-\u03b22AR standard membranes with known receptor expression levels), the B\nmax value in [3H]histamine binding was reduced by 75% after tunicamycin treatment. Nevertheless, the K\nD value of [3H]histamine remained unchanged (Schneider et al. 2009).

Data obtained from the rhodopsin molecule have led to the assumption that the so-called ionic lock is highly important for the inactivation of GPCRs (Palczewski et al. 2000; Vogel et al. 2008). The ionic lock is a salt bridge between a highly conserved glutamate in position 6.30 of TM6 and the arginine of the DRY motif located on the bottom of TM3 (position 3.50). The importance of the ionic lock for the regulation of odorant GPCR activity has been shown recently (de March et al. 2015). However, some receptors do not form an ionic lock, despite the presence of the required amino acids. This has been reported, e.g. for the human \u03b22AR (Cherezov et al. 2007; Rasmussen et al. 2007; Rosenbaum et al. 2007) or the human A2A adenosine receptor (Jaakola et al. 2008), both of which show considerable constitutive activity.",

To test this hypothesis, the TM6 part of the potential ionic lock was reconstituted by introducing the A6.30E mutation, and the resulting mutant was analyzed in the Sf9 cell expression system. Immunoblots and [3H]histamine saturation binding indicated comparable expression levels of the mutant and the wild-type hH4R.

This revealed an additional salt bridge between D5.69 at the N-terminus of the second cytoplasmic loop (CL3) and R6.31, which may stabilize an active receptor conformation (Schneider et al. 2010a).

            "text": "Recently, the reasons for the high constitutive activity of hH4R were further elucidated (Wifling et al. 2015a, b). These studies made use of the large pharmacological differences between human and rodent H4R (Schnell et al. 2011; Strasser et al. 2013). For example, constitutive activity of mH4R and rH4R is strongly reduced as compared to hH4R (Schnell et al. 2011) and the inverse hH4R agonist JNJ7777120 exhibits partial agonism at mH4R and rH4R. Moreover, the potency of the agonist histamine is lower for the rodent orthologues as compared to hH4R (Schnell et al. 2011). Mutational studies indicate that position 169 of the second extracellular loop is an important determinant of the distinct agonist binding properties of human and mouse H4R (Lim et al. 2008). The F169 of the hH4R is replaced by a V169 in the mH4R. Thus, Wifling et al. (2015b) performed a detailed analysis of the \u201cmouse-like\u201d hH4R-F169V mutant in the Sf9 cell system. In fact, hH4R-F169V exhibited decreased constitutive activity as compared to wild-type hH4R, resulting in an increased agonistic effect of histamine. Moreover, histamine binding affinity as well as the inverse agonistic effect of thioperamide was reduced (Wifling et al. 2015b). The second key amino acid identified by Wifling et al. (2015b) was S179, which is replaced by methionine in the mH4R and by alanine in the rH4R. The double mutants hH4R-F169V+S179A and hH4R-F169V+S179M showed an even stronger reduction of constitutive activity as compared to the hH4R-F169V single mutant (Wifling et al. 2015b). These results suggest that the constitutively active state of hH4R at least partly depends on hydrophobic interactions between the extracellular domains of TM 5, 6, and 7 and ECL2. A hydrogen bond between S179 and T323 additionally stabilizes the agonist-free active state of the hH4R (Wifling et al. 2015b).",

This analysis revealed that R3.50 of the hH4R may interact with the backbone oxygens of C352 and G353 in the G\u03b1i2 C-terminus (Schneider et al. 2010a). This supports the adoption of the G\u03b1i2 conformation, which is required for interaction with TM6 of the receptor. Thus, the R3.50A mutation hampers G protein recognition by hH4R. Nevertheless, the hH4R-R3.50A mutant is still able to form the salt bridge between D5.69 and R6.31, which stabilizes an active state. This could explain why hH4R-R3.50A still exhibits relatively high histamine affinity (Schneider et al. 2010a). However, the effect of mutations in the E/DRY motif is not disrupting G protein coupling in all GPCRs. Rovati et al. (2007) described two phenotypes P1 and P2 that are produced by mutations of the E/D3.49- or the R3.50-residue. While in P1-type receptors high-affinity agonist binding and G protein coupling are retained after mutating position R3.50, P2-type receptors show a disrupted receptor-G protein interaction and reduced agonist binding affinity (Rovati et al. 2007). Accordingly, the hH4R belongs to the group of P2-type GPCRs. An overview of the most important features of the hH4R-R3.50A mutation in comparison to the wild-type hH4R is provided in Table 4.",

The expression of an hH4R-G\u03b1i2 fusion protein did not improve the signal-to-noise ratio, but resulted in even higher constitutive activity and reduced relative intensity of histamine-induced signals (Schneider et al. 2009).

RGS proteins are classified in eight subfamilies that differ from each other by protein size and the presence of additional functional domains. They regulate the activity of G\u03b1i/o- or G\u03b1q proteins, but no RGS protein-mediated activation of G\u03b1s has been reported to date. Due to their mechanism of action, RGS proteins should enhance signal intensity in steady-state GTPase assays. In fact, fusion of the \u03b12AR C-terminus to the RGS4 N-terminus significantly increased \u03b12AR-mediated stimulation of GTPase activity (Bahia et al. 2003).",

Possibly, the differences are caused by distinct G protein affinities of these RGS proteins. According to the UniProtKB database entry P49795, GAIP binds to G\u03b1i proteins in the rank order G\u03b1i3 > G\u03b1i1 > G\u03b1o >> G\u03b1z/G\u03b1i2. Thus, among the G\u03b1i isoforms, G\u03b1i2 is the one with the lowest affinity to GAIP. This means that the effect of GAIP may only become visible, when the number of activated G\u03b1i2 subunits exceeds a certain threshold. While under basal conditions the number of activated G\u03b1i2 subunits is too low for a visible hH4R-GAIP-mediated effect, stimulation by histamine increases the number of active G\u03b1i2 to a level, where the GAIP-mediated effect becomes visible. By contrast, RGS4 may exhibit a higher G\u03b1i2 affinity than GAIP and therefore show already an effect under basal conditions. This hypothesis, however, should be tested by a side-by-side comparison of the G\u03b1i2 protein affinity of RGS4 and GAIP.",

A comparison of hH4R-GAIP and wild-type hH4R (both co-expressed G\u03b1i2 and G\u03b21\u03b32) in steady-state GTPase assays revealed comparable pharmacological properties. First, potency and efficacy of selected hH4R standard ligands were unaltered. Second, similar to wild-type hH4R, the hH4R-GAIP fusion protein exhibited sodium chloride-insensitive constitutive activity (Schneider and Seifert 2009). Third, the hH4R-GAIP fusion protein showed an unchanged G protein selectivity profile as compared to the unmodified hH4R protein (Schneider et al. 2009; Schneider and Seifert 2009). The unaltered G protein profile is surprising, because GAIP shows distinct affinities to different G\u03b1i isoforms, which should theoretically influence the interaction between hH4R-GAIP and the G protein. The results, however, indicate that the G-protein-specificity of the hH4R-GAIP fusion protein is governed by the properties of the receptor rather than by the RGS protein part. In summary, the hH4R-GAIP fusion protein (co-expressed with G\u03b1i2 and G\u03b21\u03b32) can fully replace the standard co-expression system (hH4R + G\u03b1i2 + G\u03b21\u03b32) in steady-state GTPase assays and allows the functional characterization of new hH4R ligands with higher sensitivity and signal-to-noise ratio. The hH4R-GAIP fusion protein approach was successfully used to evaluate a new class of N\nG-acylated imidazolylpropyl-guanidine-derived hH4R agonists (Ghorai et al. 2008; Igel et al. 2009b) or of cyanoguanidine-related hH4R agonists (Igel et al. 2009a; Geyer et al. 2016).

However, this feature becomes an advantage, when inverse agonists are characterized. The hH4R may maintain its constitutive activity under physiological conditions, because it is resistant to high sodium concentrations. As hypothesized by Schneider et al. (2009), on the one side, inverse agonists could be therapeutically advantageous in case of pathophysiologically increased constitutive H4R activity, because they may exert a stronger anti-pruritic effect than neutral antagonists. On the other side, the re-folding of misfolded H4R protein observed with the inverse agonist thioperamide (Schneider et al. 2009) (Sect. 2.4.4) may be a general effect of inverse H4R agonists. Thus, inverse agonist-mediated upregulation of intact H4R protein may result in rebound effects after drug discontinuation (Schneider et al. 2009). Although these hypotheses were not proven yet under physiological conditions, they illustrate the potential importance of characterizing inverse H4R agonism during drug development. Therefore, structure-activity relationships for hH4R inverse agonism should be established.",

Moreover, both the carbonyl moiety and the indole NH of the ligand establish an interaction with the side chain of the uncharged Glu5.46. The indole moiety of the ligand shows a hydrophobic interaction with the indole part of Trp6.48 (Schneider et al. 2010b). Trp6.48 is a key player in the so-called rotamer toggle switch mechanism of receptor activation, which had been previously postulated for the \u03b22AR (Shi et al. 2002). The stabilization of Trp6.48 in its vertical conformation by the indole-derived ligand is a typical feature of the inactive receptor conformation and may explain the inverse agonism of such compounds.

Molecular dynamics simulations suggest that two small binding pockets in the H4R protein may be filled by these chlorine residues, which increases the ligand-receptor contact area (Schneider et al. 2010b). Substitution of R5 by -OCH3 reduces binding affinity, suggesting that larger substituents may be unfavorable. However, there is no significant correlation between molar volume and affinity of a series of indole compounds, suggesting that the volume of R5 may not be the only descriptor that influences binding affinity (Schneider et al. 2010b). By contrast, the size of R5 correlates excellently with the inverse agonistic efficacy of a subset of eight indole-derived compounds with varying R5 substituents. A calculation of the descriptors logP, molar refractivity, molar volume, polarizability, refraction index and polar surface area revealed that inverse agonistic efficacy solely depended on molar volume, but not on the other factors. The inverse agonistic efficacy of these compounds was inversely correlated to the molar volume of the substituent R5 (Schneider et al. 2010b).",

On the other hand, it is difficult to isolate primary cells in sufficiently high numbers. Moreover, a side-by-side comparison of receptor isoforms or species orthologues in a defined environment is virtually impossible in primary cells. Since cells from different tissues have to be used, cell type-specific properties like crosstalk with other receptors or special features of the signaling pathways can lead to heterogeneous results, even for the same receptor isoform. Also, for some receptors like H3R, no suitable primary cell system is available (Seifert et al. 2013).",

Radioactivity-based assays, however, are increasingly hampered by legal overregulation and growing waste disposal costs. In this situation, fluorescence-based GPCR ligand binding and G protein activation assays could represent interesting alternatives. Unfortunately, many histamine receptor ligands are rather small molecules and easily lose binding affinity when coupled to a bulky fluorophore. Nevertheless, some progress has been made during the past years. For example, a cyanine dye-labeled aminopotentidine derivative exhibited nanomolar hH2R potency (Xie et al. 2006c). Moreover, fluorescent pyrylium- or cyanine-labeled dimeric carbamoylguanidines were synthesized, but these compounds failed in binding assays due to intracellular accumulation and the resulting high fluorescence background (Kagermeier et al. 2015). A high-affinity fluorescent H1R antagonist was obtained by labeling mepyramine with a BODIPY (4,4-difluoro-4-bora-3a,4a-diaza-s-indacene)-derived dye (Rose et al. 2012). Fluorescent hH3R-selective ligands were developed by using the chalcone partial structure (Tomasch et al. 2012). Moreover, a compound named \u201cBodilisant,\u201d which has been reported recently, is a BODIPY-labeled non-imidazole ligand with nanomolar hH3R affinity (Tomasch et al. 2013). Some progress has also been made in the field of fluorescence-based G protein activation assays. For example, a europium-labeled non-hydrolysable GDP derivative can replace [35S]GTP\u03b3S in GTP\u03b3S binding assays (Koval et al. 2010). This enables a time-resolved fluorescence-based assay that is, e.g., suited for the functional characterization of hH3R ligands (Singh et al. 2012).",

The hH4R ligand JNJ-7777120, which acts as an inverse hH4R agonist in G protein activation assays (Schneider et al. 2009), unexpectedly turned out to be an agonist with regard to hH4R-mediated \u03b2-arrestin recruitment (Rosethorne and Charlton 2011).

For example, exact knowledge of the hH4R conformation could help to explain, why this receptor shows such a high constitutive activity (Schneider et al. 2009; Wifling et al. 2015a). Moreover, a crystal structure of the hH3R may provide important information about the hH3R-G protein interaction interface and possibly answer the question, why the hH3R discriminates between G\u03b1i3 and other G\u03b1i/o isoforms (Schnell and Seifert 2010). Furthermore, an hH3R crystal may lead to the identification of the anion binding sites responsible for the monovalent anion-mediated reduction of constitutive hH3R activity (Schnell and Seifert 2010). Finally, the knowledge of HxR crystal structures could lead to the development of compounds that alter HxR function as allosteric modulators. The concept of GPCR modulation by allosteric ligands is well established, and such ligands have been identified, e.g. for dopamine, muscarinic, adenosine, or chemokine receptors (Christopoulos 2014).

Every GPCR population exists in an equilibrium of active and inactive receptor conformations. Full agonists produce a maximum shift towards the active side, while inverse agonists cause a maximum stabilization of the inactive GPCR conformation. Partial agonists and partial inverse agonists induce only an incomplete shift towards either side. Neutral antagonists bind to all receptor states with the same affinity and therefore do not change the equilibrium. G proteins stabilize the active conformation, while sodium ions usually uncouple GPCRs from their G proteins by shifting the equilibrium towards the inactive side. It should be noted that, despite its usefulness, the two-state model is very simplistic and does not account for the numerous distinct ligand- and G protein-specific receptor conformations occurring in reality.
