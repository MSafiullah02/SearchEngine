Although Koch's postulates could not be fulfilled for human bocavirus so far, there is increasing evidence that it is a true pathogen rather than an innocent bystander in airway infection (reviewed by [3] [4] ). Recently, we and others have shown that acute HBoV infection can lead to a persistent infection [5] [6] [7] leading to covalently closed circular HBoV genomes in infected cells [6] . It becomes a likely hypothesis that chronic HBoV infection could lead to ongoing, maybe subclinical inflammation processes that finally lead to fibrosis of the chronically infected tissue, as observed for other DNA viruses like hepatitis B virus infections [8] . It might also be speculated that persistent infection HBoV could be responsible for chronic idiopathic interstitial lung diseases such as usual interstitial pneumonia (UIP).",

Post mortem tissue samples collected during the autopsy were formalin fixed and paraffin embedded and tested for CMV and HBoV. Of the tested tissue samples lung tissue from the right lower lobe, the heart's septum, the pancreas, and the thyroid gland became positive for CMV. Surprisingly, in addition, both right and left ventricle myocard was tested positive for HBoV. Other Formalin Fixed Paraffin embedded tissues (liver, spleen, kidney left and right, bone marrow, testis, lymph node, adrenal gland, and prostate gland remained negative for both viruses. Finally, tissue samples of the lungs revealed an interstitial pulmonary fibrosis with scarring and honeycomb change, which was consistent with UIP [9] . Based on these finding it cannot be fully excluded that the clinical course could be a reactivation of CMV as previously described [11] ; however, CMV was detected in some but not all tissue sample, the latter being compatible with the assumption of local persistence of the virus rather than a ubiquitous reactivation by immunosuppression.",

Moreover, quantification of HBoV loads in the BAL is imprecise as the instillation volume strongly dilutes the HBoV titre in the infected tissue or the tissue mucus and thus was not performed. In addition, head-to-tail PCRs were positive for both BALs, indicating the presence of cccDNA in both patients.",

In the two patients UIP was diagnosed according to established recommendations [9] . Recently, acute HBoV infection has been shown to potentially lead to a persistent infection [5] [6] [7] . Thereby, HBoV was shown by us and others to persist as cccDNA [6, 12, 13] . A cccDNA is also known as the persisting genome of the human hepatitis virus infections in which the chronic persistence may lead to fibrosis and cirrhosis after years in which the infections was clinically silent [14, 15] . In addition, several studies have addressed the possible role of chronic viral infection in the aetiology of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis with most research having focused on Epstein-Barr virus [9] . Based on these observations and on the present findings the current authors would raise the possibility of HBoV playing a significant role in the aetiology of UIP.",

Although the role of this observation still needs to be elucidated, and although it remains unclear when the primary HBoV occurred in the reported cases and how it contributed to the onset of fibrosis, the current report has identified HBoV as a potential agent causing UIP and possibly even heart disease. This clearly warrants further systematic studies on HBoV an UIP, which also should included systematic testing for the shedding period of the virus [16] . Although we are aware of the bias of our case reports that a corresponding serology was missing we are convinced that the presented cases are important to trigger further clinical studies that take HBoV into account as a pathogen that may be responsible for the development of fibrotic diseases of the lung.",
