In addition, the emergence of zoonotic poxvirus infections such as the monkeypox virus in both the US and Western Africa in human populations aggravated the people\u2019s panic.6 For all of these reasons, special attention has been paid to establish efficient safe therapies for dealing with poxvirus infections.",

But the low oral bioavailability of CDV and potential nephrotoxicity accompany with its intravenous administration limited the clinical application of the CDV. Recently, the lipophilic prodrug of CDV, hexadecyloxypropyl ester (HDP-CDV, 2), was demonstrated that have improved bioavailability and equivalent effectiveness against orthopoxvirus infections and is in phase I/II clinical studies currently.7 Moreover, Tecovirimat (ST-246, 3), an orally bioavailable compound that targets the F13L protein of the virus, which inhibit the growth of multiple orthopoxviruses and has significant antiviral activity in various poxvirus disease animal models, was demonstrated favorable safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics in phase I clinic trial.8, 9 In 2010, Tecovirimat was received both orphan drug designation and fast-track status from the US FDA and with the hope that it can be approved for the prevention and treatment of smallpox infections.",

But an adenovirus infection might led to severe and life-threatening disease (multiple organ failure) in the immunocompromised individuals.14 During the last two decades, a number of adenovirus serotypes that largely from species A, B, and C were isolated from immunocompromised patients successfully. Ad2, a species A serotype that has been most detailed studied of adenovirus so far, are often associated with respiratory illness with a lethal outcome occasionally. Currently, there have no available drugs for treatment of AdVs infections. Cidofovir was proved to be the most promising anti-adenoviral agent of those currently used in clinical settings, but the outcome in the hematopoietic stem cell recipients has been found to be poor adenovirus infections.15 Therefore, there is compelling need for the discovery of new antiviral drugs of vaccinia and adenovirus that possess an improved safety property and oral bioavailability.",

The starting material 2-hydroxyisoindoline-1,3-dione (14) was firstly reacted with benzyl bromide to obtain 2-(benzyloxy)isoindoline-1,3-dione (15). Then 15 was treated with hydrochloric acid and acetic acid via an acidulation reaction to form the key intermediate O-benzylhydroxylamine hydrochloride (16).29 Meanwhile, the commercially available material 2-amino-5-iodobenzoic acid (17) was treated with methanol in the presence of concentrated H2SO4 gave the intermediate methyl 2-amino-5-iodobenzoate (18) via an esterification reaction. The intermediate 3-(benzyloxy)-6-iodoquinazoline-2,4(1H,3H)-dione (19) was obtained by ring closure of 18 with carbonyldimidazole (CDI) and 16 under the condition of sodium hydroxide.30, 31 Then this heterocyclic scaffold was alkylated with iodomethane and iodoethane in DMF afforded the N1-methylation product 20a and N1-ethylation product 20b respectively. The key alkyne building block 22a or 22b was prepared from 20a or 20b via the Sonogashira cross-coupling reaction and trimethylsilyl-removal reaction successfully. Copper(I) catalyzed click reaction (CuAAC) of the alkyne key intermediate 22a or 22b with different azido substituent groups generated the corresponding key 1,2,3-triazole intermediates (23a01\u201323a13 and 23b01\u201323b13), which were deprotected under basic condition affording two series of target compounds 1,2,3-triazole-substituted 3-hydroxy-quinazoline-2,4(1H,3H)-diones 24a01\u201324a13 and 24b01\u201324b13. Their structures were determined by their 1H NMR, 13C NMR, and MS (ESI) spectra. Notably, the 1H NMR spectrum showed a singlet at 8.50 corresponding to the triazolyl proton while the 13C NMR spectrum showed peaks at 125.73\u2013125.90 and 149.12\u2013149.65 corresponding to CH and qC characteristic to the triazole core unit.",

In addition, most of the compounds showed no cytotoxicity (as determined by microscopy) at the highest concentration (MCC > 100 \u03bcM) tested in HEL cells.

Especially, most of N1-ethyl substituted analogues showed favorable activity against adenovirus, but nearly all the compounds lost their activity when the compounds with N1-methyl substituted counterparts with an exception of compound 24a12. Introduction of an electron-withdrawing group at the para substituents of the aryl can remarkable improve the anti-vaccinia activities (NO2\n > CN > F > CH3). To the contrary, a strong electron-withdrawing group can result in the compound lost their adenovirus activities, but the compounds with electrondrawing group (24b13 and 24a13) exhibited the most potent antiviral activity against adenovirus.

Among them, 24b11 and 24b13 was demonstrated with the most potent vaccinia and adenovirus inhibitory activity respectively, which were promising compounds for further exploration as drug candidates for anti-poxvirus or adenovirus therapy. Preliminary SARs were discussed with the hope to provide a helpful guidance for the design of next-generation of quinolinone analogues. Obviously, the mechanism of action and precise viral target of these 1,2,3-triazolyl 3-hydroxy-quinazoline-2,4(1H,3H)-diones derivatives presented here remain to be identified.
