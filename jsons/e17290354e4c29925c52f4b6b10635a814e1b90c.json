Respirators which use negative pressure require an airtight seal against the user's face to ensure that inspired air passes through, rather than around, the filter.

Even if not formally cleared, filtering facepiece respirators generally offer useful fluid resistance, and with types for which approval testing includes oil-based aerosols, this is likely to be high, but in all cases manufacturers' direction should be followed. There have been recommendations to wear a surgical mask over a filtering facepiece respirator 11 , however this does not increase respiratory protection and does increase the burden to the wearer. 12 13 We did not consider extended use or reuse of respirators in this review as that topic is the subject of a separate review. 14 The standards reported in Error! Reference source not found. and Error! Reference source not found. are not specific to healthcare. Therefore, a respirator (either disposable or reusable) may be used in a range of different settings, providing that the standards it meets are those applicable in the new setting.

The headgear can either be a loose-fitting hood or a tight fitting (sealed) mask. The loose-fitting hood type does not need a seal because the positive pressure ensures a constant outflow from the hood. One advantage of PAPRs is that they remove the effort of breathing against the resistance of filters, and so reduce the wearer's physiological burden. They can also accommodate facial conformities where a face fit seal has been unsuccessful including for users with beards. Blowers generally employ rechargeable batteries (though for emergency stockage primary cells may be available), so a battery maintenance programme is necessary, as is an air flowrate check before use.",

            "text": "Summary of review findingsAt least 10% will need to try more than one respirator in order to achieve fit. Seal check is a poor predictor of fit and is not sufficient. FFR fit markedly diminished in presence of facial hair.CPR led to failure of fit in 10-60% of FFR users(3  studies). No failure in PAPR users, no studies with EFR. Generic healthcare activities: 0-30% fit failure with FFR during generic healthcare activities Failure to follow guidelines for safe use is common both in donning / doffing and during use. Repeated training appears to be necessary to ensure continuing safe respirator fit Small studies in specific settings. Likely that this is an issue, but unclear how large Performance of simulated procedures including endotracheal intubation minimally affected. Participants report problems with vision and with hearing.Measured meaningful drop in speech quality (EFR & PAPR) and hearing (PAPR). Subjective identification of difficulties in 20-40% usersDiscomfort reported in 15-40% users. Higher with EFR/PAPR than FFR. More than half of users unable to wear for full 8hr shift.HCW balance between discomfort and extra protection. Both HCW and organisations indicate important of practical issues (storage, access) and social context of norms and culture.Two high quality qualitative studies + surveys FFR: filtering facepiece respirator; EFR: elastomeric facepiece respirator; PAPR : powered air-purifying respirator.
