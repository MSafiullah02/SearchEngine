            "text": "We read with concern the articles that report the presence of coronavirus in kidney based on electron microscopic evidence (1, 2). Neither article, in fact, demonstrates the presence of coronavirus in the kidney. The authors of one paper (1) show purported virus particles in the cytoplasm of kidney tubular epithelium and podocytes. These structures are not viral particles, but rather clathrin-coated vesicles, normal cell organelles involved in intracellular transport. The objects in Figs a, b (~60 nm) are somewhat smaller than coronaviruses (~80 to140+ nm), but more importantly, their \"spikes\" (peplomers) are in contact with the cytosol, as are those on clathrin-coated vesicles; the larger particle in d also has spikes that are touching cytosol and does not have a dense core. Coronaviruses, on the other hand, have their projections either facing the extracellular space between cells or the space inside vacuoles within the cells (3, 4, 5). This phenomenon is due to the fact that coronaviruses receive their outer covering by budding into or upon cellular membranes, thereby forming intracellular vacuoles with the viral projections in contact with the vacuolar content, not the cytosol. During assembly, viral structural proteins are incorporated into the endoplasmic reticulum-Golgi complex of the infected cell, and viral RNA, packaged with another protein, buds into these membranes, forming a membrane-bound sac containing mature virions; the spikes are on the outside of the virion, but inside the vacuole and not in direct contact with the cytosol (Fig 1) . These virions get out of the cell by exocytosis when the vacuole membrane fuses with the plasma membrane and opens its contents to the outside; thus, complete virions with peplomers are seen within the cell inside the membrane container (sequestered from the cytosol) and outside of cells, frequently still attached to the opened vacuolar membrane that has fused with the plasma membrane. The particles shown in electron micrographs in this article have their spikes in contact with the cytoplasmic fluid, like endocytotic vesicles, i.e., clathrin-coated vesicles (Plate 523, Figs 3-5, pp 1214-5 in reference 6; Figs 18 c, d in reference 8; 9). Likewise, the particles in the second article (2) are not coronaviruses. While they are inside a vacuole, have spikes, and are approximately the correct size, they do not have the uniform appearance of virus particles with a dense double-layered membrane outer covering (3, 4, 5). These objects are inside a vesicle called a multivesicular body (Plates 277-8, pp 632-345 in reference 6; Fig 3, p 393 in reference 7). This article is concerning, as electron microscopy is the only alleged evidence presented in support of the suggestion that coronaviruses are actually present in this kidney tissue; all other tests for coronavirus in kidney were negative. These micrographs do not support the statement that the particles are indeed viruses.",

The particles shown in electron micrographs in this article have their spikes in contact with the cytoplasmic fluid, like endocytotic vesicles, i.e., clathrin-coated vesicles (Plate 523, Figs 3-5, pp 1214-5 in reference 6; Figs 18 c, d in reference 8; 9). Likewise, the particles in the second article (2) are not coronaviruses. While they are inside a vacuole, have spikes, and are approximately the correct size, they do not have the uniform appearance of virus particles with a dense double-layered membrane outer covering (3, 4, 5). These objects are inside a vesicle called a multivesicular body (Plates 277-8, pp 632-345 in reference 6; Fig 3, p 393 in reference 7). This article is concerning, as electron microscopy is the only alleged evidence presented in support of the suggestion that coronaviruses are actually present in this kidney tissue; all other tests for coronavirus in kidney were negative. These micrographs do not support the statement that the particles are indeed viruses.",
