It is also due to recognition that problems in the last century tackled by public health actions have provided ongoing benefits.",

Users of the drug are prone to experiencing hallucinations and can be particularly agitated and violent. Communities in regional Australia are twice as likely to use methamphetamine than those in major cities, along with smoking daily and drinking excessively [11] . This is particularly challenging for health care professionals in emergency departments who treat them following an overdose, as they not only have to treat the physiological sequelae but also the violence and aggression that often accompany them. Within 3 years from 2010, ice has grown to be the illicit drug thought to be of most concern for the general community, and in 2013 became the second highest cause of death from illicit drugs [11] . However, it still lags behind heroin as the single largest cause of illicit drug deaths.

Being in regional and rural areas means that health services are unlikely to be able to provide high complexity services such as neurosurgery or cardiac surgery due to a lack of scale.

Of the social determinants, household income, highest level of schooling completed and employment status have the largest estimated impact on the gap.Australian Governments have acknowledged this issue, through the Close the Gap Statement of Intent signed by the Prime Minister in 2008, and at the December 2007 COAG meeting at which the Australian governments committed to:\u2022 Closing the life expectancy gap within a generation. \u2022 Halving the mortality gap between ATSI and non-Indigenous children under 5-years of age. \u2022 Halving the gap in reading, writing and numeracy within a decade.",
