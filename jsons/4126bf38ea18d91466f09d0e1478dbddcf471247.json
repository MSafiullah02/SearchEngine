A large number of components have been isolated from licorice, including triterpene saponins, flavonoids, isoflavonoids and chalcones, with glycyrrhizic acid normally being considered to be the main biologically active component.

Daily oral doses of LE or G for 1, 4 or 10 consecutive days in mice, were able significantly to induce hepatic CYP3A-and, to a lesser extent, 2B1-and 1A2dependent activities, as well as 6-beta-(mainly associated to CYP3A), 2-alpha-, 6-alpha-(CYP2A1, 2B1), 7-alpha-, 16-alpha-(CYP2B9) and 16-beta-testosterone hydroxylase (TH) activities. Thus, the induction of cytochrome P450-dependent activities by long-term ingestion of licorice may have clinical consequences for patients taking drugs metabolized by the same CYP enzymes (Paolini et al., 1998) . But, high doses of LE and G could cause significant adverse effects. Thus, it seems that routine licorice consumers under CYP3A induction might therefore be predisposed to associated Other components of the extract could affect the pharmacokinetics of glycyrrhizin (G) and glycyrrhetic acid (GA), a main metabolite of G. After administration of aqueous licorice root extract (LE) to rats and humans, G and GA levels were lower compared with G alone and the pharmacokinetic curves showed significant differences in the areas under the plasma-time curve (AUC), C max , and T max parameters. Also, the data obtained from urine samples confirmed a reduced bioavailability of G present in LE compared with pure G. Interaction between the G constituent and other components in LE during intestinal absorption was mentioned. Thus, modified bioavailability could explain the various clinical adverse effects resulting from the chronic oral administration of G alone as opposed to LE (Cantelli-Forti et al., 1994) . However, it seems that the pharmacokinetics differ in other species. In another study the AUCs of G and GA after oral administration of LE were significantly higher than those after pure G in rabbits and the bioavailabilities of G and GA were significantly better from licorice than from pure G in rabbits, but the presystemic metabolism of pure G in the rabbit is rather different from that in rat, pig and human (Hou et al., 2005) . It was shown that the pharmacokinetics of G is nonlinear. After bolus intravenous administration at a dose of 20, 50, or 100 mg/kg in rat, the decline in the concentration of G in plasma, was generally biexponential at each dose, but the terminal disposition became much slower as the dose was increased. In addition, the apparent total body clearance decreased significantly with increases in the dose. But the apparent distribution volume after intravenous administration was unaffected by the dose (Tsai et al., 1992) . Administration of different oral doses of 18beta-glycyrrhetinic acid (\u03b2-GRA) in healthy volunteers showed a biphasic decay of the plasma concentrationtime curve at doses >500 mg. The peak plasma concentration and the AUC increased with increasing \u03b2-GRA doses. Urinary elimination of \u03b2-GRA and its glucuronides over 24 h was less than 1% of the dose administered. The data based on single dose kinetic analysis revealed that after multiple doses of 1.5 g \u03b2-GRA/day, 11 beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (11 beta-HSD) might be constantly inhibited, whereas at daily doses of 500 mg or less, such an inhibition might occur only transiently (Krahenbuhl et al., 1994) .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 643, "end": 665, "text": "(Paolini et al., 1998)", "ref_id": "BIBREF160"}, {"start": 1643, "end": 1672, "text": "(Cantelli-Forti et al., 1994)", "ref_id": "BIBREF34"}, {"start": 2089, "end": 2107, "text": "(Hou et al., 2005)", "ref_id": "BIBREF103"}, {"start": 2611, "end": 2630, "text": "(Tsai et al., 1992)", "ref_id": "BIBREF207"}, {"start": 3270, "end": 3295, "text": "(Krahenbuhl et al., 1994)", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "DRUG INTERACTIONS"}, {"text": "Administration intravenously of G to an animal model of liver disease (D-galactosamine-intoxicated (GAL) rat), significantly decreased the apparent volume of distribution (V dss ) and the total body clearance (CL total ) than those in normal rats.

Also, the AUC for GA, after oral administration of G was higher in GAL rats than in normal rats, although there was no significant difference in MRT or T max , C pmax or the bioavailability for GA between GAL and normal rats.
