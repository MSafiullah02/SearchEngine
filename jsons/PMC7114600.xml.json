The clinical use of siRNA is hindered by three major problems: (1) rapid enzymatic degradation resulting in a short half-life in the blood; (2) poor cellular uptake; (3) insufficient tissue bioavailability [2], [3], [4]. In general, these problems can be partly overcome by mixing siRNAs with cationic lipids or cationic polymers to form complexes, which could be additionally surface-modified with specific ligands allowing for targeting of required tissues [5]; or by modifying siRNAs with cell-penetrating peptides (CPPs), which have been successfully applied for the delivery of various cargoes into a variety of cells both in vitro and in vivo [6], [7], [8], [9]. However, these approaches frequently failed because of aggregation of siRNA-carrying positively charged complexes in the blood in the presence of plasma proteins, which results in unfavorable pharmacokinetics mainly due to the rapid uptake into the tissues of the mononuclear phagocytic system (MPS) [10].",

In particular, Lipofectamine2000 is frequently used for the delivery of siRNA [14], [15]. Despite the certain success using Lipoplexes, these agents allow for little control over the process of their interaction with siRNA leading to the final product, siRNA-lipoplex particle, of excessive size, low stability, and with incomplete encapsulation of siRNA molecules, which thereby exposes siRNA to potential enzymatic or physical degradation prior to delivery to cells. The complexes are sensitive towards serum, and therefore, optimal transfection must be performed using serum-free conditions, which has obvious shortcomings for potential in vivo applications. In addition, such complexes do not work efficiently with many cell types and are toxic to cells and experimental animals [16].",

R8 belongs to a large group of so-called cell-penetrating peptides (CPP), which are positively charged and can enter cells when added exogenously [18]. Various CPPs have been successfully used for the delivery of exogenous molecules, such as oligonucleotides and proteins, and even small particles, such as iron oxide nanoparticles, liposomes, and quantum dots, into the cytoplasm and nuclei of cultured cells [6], [7], [8], [9], [19]. Thus, DNA-loaded liposomes were delivered into various cells by multiple TAT peptide molecules attached to the liposome surface and allowed for the successful transfection with TAT\u2013liposome\u2013DNA complexes both in vitro and in vivo [20]. Synthetic oligo-arginines, such as 9-mer and 8-mer (R8), were shown to be very effective CPPs [21] allowing, for example, for successful cell transfection with R8-luciferase-encoding plasmid complexes [22].",

To the suspension, 4 ml of Tris buffer, pH 9.0, was added, then mixed and incubated overnight at 4 \u00b0C under an argon atmosphere. Since the modified R8 becomes amphiphilic and forms micelles, these micelles were separated from the non-reacted free R8 by the overnight dialysis against distilled water at 4 \u00b0C using a Spectrum dialysis bag (MWCO of 5 kDa), after which samples were freeze-dried. R8-PEG-PE was identified by NMR and TLC and stored as a powder at \u2212 20 \u00b0C.",

When the positively charged dry lipid film is hydrated with the aqueous solution containing 21 nt short double-stranded and strongly negatively charged RNA, two types of different forces act within the system: (1) electrostatic interaction between siRNA and the cationic polar heads of DOTAP drives the formation of inverted hexagonal structures entrapping single siRNA molecule, and (2) hydrophobic interaction between lipids resulting in the formation of a bilayered liposomal membrane, with PEG-PE preventing vesicles from aggregation. Heating the system induces the rearrangement of the lipid molecules and membranes to cover the surface of small inverted hexagonal micelles and arrange them to form a larger mosaic vesicle. A theoretical calculation further supports the above model. 21 nt siRNA can be considered as a rigid rod, 44 \u00c5 in diameter and 72 \u00c5 in length. The thickness of the lipid bilayer in egg PC vesicles is about 5\u201310 nm and varies with the acyl chain length [29]. The freeze-fracture EM shows that a small vesicle has a diameter of about 20 nm in diameter, indicating that the small vesicle represents a single siRNA molecule coated by a single lipid bilayer.",

After R8-lipo-siRNA lysis by SDS, however, the loaded siRNA was released from the liposomes, and all bands were seen with the intensity close to that of the control free siRNA except the mobility of all bands was slower than that of the free siRNA (Fig. 2d). The fact that siRNA released from R8-lipo-siRNA by SDS had a slower mobility than free siRNA could be explained by possible interaction of SDS and serum components with siRNA released from R8-lipo-siRNA.

It is possible that siRNA cannot condense into the complexes formed by Lipofectamine2000 and DOTAP and remain exposed for degradation. When these complexes were subjected to electrophoresis, all siRNAs were released in their free form, resulting in a band with intensity close to the control free siRNA (Fig. 2g, compare lanes 1, 3 and 4).",

Gel electrophoresis demonstrated that electrophoretic behaviors of R8-lipo-siRNA were significantly different from the free siRNA and the Comp-R8-lipo-siRNA (Fig. 1e), with much lower intensity compared to the free siRNA before lysing, however, after SDS lysing, two siRNA bands were seen with intensity markedly brighter than before lysing (Fig. 1e), indicating that in this case most loaded siRNA was released in a free form. The new band close to the loading position should have a higher molecular weight than free siRNA or a lesser negative charge than free siRNA, which could reflect a complex of siRNA with few DOTAP molecules formed as a result of non-complete liposome degradation by SDS or even a triple complex of negatively charged siRNA and SDS with DOTAP, since negatively charged SDS can form complexes with cationic lipids such as DOTAP in aqueous solutions. Lipid composition, size distribution, and surface charge of such liposomes can be easily manipulated to provide a clinically acceptable formulation for systemic delivery. In the process of formation of these liposomes, siRNA reacts with the head group of the liposomal DOTAP forming a neutral coordination complex. As a result, R8-lipo-siRNA have no or minimal charge. The reduction of the membrane surface charge is essential for improving the stability of siRNA-lipid formulations in the blood stream and decreasing the uptake by the reticulo-endothelial system [10]. In our study, we have confirmed that the mechanism of action of R8-liposome-encapsulated siRNA is determined by the RNAi-mediated degradation of the target mRNA.
