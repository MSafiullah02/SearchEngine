            "text": "Although MV can be a lifesaving intervention for many intensive care (ICU) patients, it has been associated with potential complications known as ventilator-induced lung injury (VILI) [1], [2]. The choice of appropriate ventilator mode and settings can improve the benefit-to-risk ratio of MV by providing adequate gas exchange while reducing the risk of VILI [3], [4]. However, known bedside measures to guide the clinician in adjusting MV settings are limited in that they tend to give global information regarding the performance of the lungs. Arterial blood gas analysis and airway pressure\u2013volume (PV) graphical waveforms have been the gold standard clinical practices for assessing the acid\u2013base balance, lung function, and guiding the titration of MV in critically ill patients. These are combined with measurements derived from pressure, flow, and volume, which give information about the mechanical properties of the lungs and chest wall. However, these methods are only able to provide an indication on the overall lung function, and thus fail to provide full information about the regional lung behavior. To date, chest imaging has relied on bedside X-ray radiography and the gold standard computed tomography (CT), which provides comprehensive images of the morphologic structures of the lungs and shows ventilation distribution with high spatial resolution. However, during these procedures, the patient is exposed to a substantial dose of radiation, and in the case of CT, the patient needs to be transported to the radiology department, which is a high risk process in the unstable critically ill. Indeed, the risks may be so high that the investigation is not carried out at all. Even if possible, the practical considerations mean that CT is an occasional investigation usually only repeated every few days at most. It is costly and both time and labor intensive. The process will require waiting for the scanning time to be available and will usually take up an hour or two of medical, nursing, and technician time (potentially depleting staff resources on the ICU itself), as well as radiology staff time, portering involvement, and occupying transfer equipment and ventilators. The last point is particularly important, as changing from the ICU ventilator to a transport ventilator will result in a brief period of loss of PEEP, with the potential for lung derecruitment or more subtle changes in ventilator pressures or flows, which may be deleterious for the patient. Absolute electrical impedance tomography (aEIT) provides a cheap, potentially continuous form of monitoring the behavior of the lungs, which may reveal changes and trends in regional ventilation. For example, progressive loss of ventilation in one lung may lead to the early detection of an endotracheal tube that has slipped down either the right or left main bronchus, leading to obstruction and underventilation of the opposite lung, or may suggest the development of some other pathology in the deteriorating lung, such as a developing pleural effusion compressing the lung or worsening atelectasis due to a disease process such as a pneumonia. Long-term electrode application can be irritant for the skin (although not more than ECG monitoring, which is almost invariably in place). There are practical problems with maintaining good electrical contact and coping with the wires. However, practice and timely application when patients are being rolled as part of routine patient care can go a long way to reduce these problems.",

The resulting physiological model can simulate different scenarios of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) lungs and reproduce consistent images of lung ventilation distribution in response to different PEEP levels.

The process of recovering the conductivity distribution within the body from the applied currents and measured boundary potentials is known as the inverse problem in EIT. There are two approaches for solving the image reconstruction problem in EIT. Static reconstruction produces an image of the absolute conductivity distribution of the medium based on one set of measurements. Dynamic or difference imaging attempts to recover the change in resistivity based on measurements made at two different time periods.",

The model uses normally distributed TOP and TCP pressures with a specific mean and standard deviation (SD), which may be adjusted to reflect the heterogeneous characteristic of alveoli under different abnormal lung conditions such as ARDS [20], [21]. Fig. 4 illustrates the mechanics of a single alveolus during inflation and deflation. During inflation (inspiration), when the applied pressure exceeds the TOP, the lung unit pops open and assumes a volume according to (3). During deflation (expiration), the lung unit collapses and its volume becomes zero when the applied pressure falls below the TCP.\n",

There is also often a clinical debate as to the value of certain monitoring techniques in a practical situation, such as the value of pressure volume loops and how these can be interpreted. Inflexion points on pressure volume loops are an example of this. These occur when the pressure volume relationship changes, indicating either improved compliance because airways are held open with PEEP. Alternatively, a fall in the change in volume per unit pressure increase seen at higher pressures suggests worsening compliance as the lung becomes overinflated. However, these inflexion points may be very indistinct or may not be obvious at all. Some of these issues are indeed important when considering the potential of EIT because measures of pressure and volume provide information about the whole respiratory system; hence, information on regional changes may be lost in the data originating from both lungs. EIT has an advantage in that regional change can be analyzed and changes over time are easier and potentially safer to monitor than formal pressure volume loop assessment. Even when pressure volume loops are used in the development of EIT, and in order to help establish either normal values of resistivity at different levels of lung inflation, the ability to examine regional change adds another dimension to our ability to examine the lung.",

Continuous measurement during normal ventilation will provide information on regional atelectasis or overinflation and dynamic changes such as regional air trapping. Indeed, it could be argued that these are the pressures that the lungs are continually exposed to and so are the most important guide to adjustment of ventilator pressures. In this context, absolute EIT is very important, so that comparisons can be made against normal values. It may be that in future studies, aEIT will demonstrate that above a certain level of overinflation, more severe lung volutrauma can be expected. The ability to look at regions of the lung in this context may be very important.",

With this information available at the bedside along with other relevant patient's physiological parameters routinely monitored in ICUs, a computer advisory system can ultimately enhance the clinician's expertize with rapid and precise adjustments of ventilator settings, thus minimizing the known adverse effects of mechanical ventilation. The authors propose to use a previously developed data-driven physiological model (SOPAVent [27], [28]) for continuous and nonnvasive blood gas predictions, and the information generated from the Sheffield Mk3.5 absolute EIT [29] system to design the advisory system shown in Fig. 15. Key to the success of such a system will be data/information fusion block whose task will be to resolve any conflicts between the multisource nature of inputs of possible patient therapies prior to providing a unified decision.\n",

EIT is capable of tracking local changes in pulmonary air contents, and thus, can be used to continuously guide the appropriate setting of mechanical ventilation in critical care patients. A simulation model based on respiratory physiology has been developed to demonstrate the principles of EIT in monitoring ARDS-affected lung models under mechanical ventilation. The model is not intended to be a complete representation of the respiratory physiology of ventilated patients affected by ARDS. However, while relatively simple, it gives a good understanding of the processes of recruitment and derecruitment in ARDS-affected lungs, and illustrates how ventilator settings can be optimized with the aid of EIT monitoring techniques. The model was able to reproduce images of the ventilated lung under different ARDS conditions, which were consistent and presented a good agreement with the PV curve simulation results obtained for the same model of ARDS lungs. Future extension will include 3-D model representation for completeness of information. These models will be validated against clinical data recorded from ICU patients at the Northern General Hospital, Sheffield, U.K., using the Mk3.5 aEIT system.",
