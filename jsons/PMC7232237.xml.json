Following the cleavage of the viral polyprotein, VP0, VP1 and VP3 immediately form the protomer. Five protomers subsequently assemble into the pentameric subunit, and twelve pentamers combine to yield the full capsid. A final cleavage event results in maturation of the capsid and separation of VP0 into VP2 and 4, and the resulting capsids have two-fold, three-fold and five-fold axes of symmetry [8]. During the capsid assembly cascade, a network of noncovalent interactions is formed between the capsid protein precursors, which are essential for the self-assembly, structural integrity and stability of the capsid [9,10]. They must be strong enough to prevent capsid dissociation in the harsh extracellular environment yet remain labile to allow uncoating and genome release inside the cell [10,11]. Importantly, interface residues do not equally participate in the binding of protein complexes. Rather, a small subset of residues termed \u201chotspots\u201d contributes significantly to the binding energy, specificity and stability of protein\u2013protein associations [12,13].",

Thus, studies have attempted to identify these important residues and determine their role in capsid assembly and viral function [17,18,19]. Most of these studies have relied upon the systematic dissection of individual interfacial residues by in vitro mutagenesis [9,11,20]. Such an approach is significantly challenging when large interfaces, like those found in viral capsids, are to be analysed. Consequently, authors have attempted to theoretically assess residues at capsid subunit interfaces and generate a map of specific residues for further experimental analysis using computational methods such as electrostatic energy calculations [21] and free energy functions [22].",

Energy-based models, such as computational alanine scanning, use free energy functions to estimate the change in binding energy (\u0394\u0394G binding) between the wild type and mutant protein complex upon mutation of individual amino acid residues to alanine [23,24]. Drawbacks to this method are firstly, that residues which form contacts through main-chain and not side-chain atoms are ignored and secondly, protein conformations may be altered or destabilised during the alanine substitution, leading to an increase in false positives [25,26]. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations also estimate the free energy of association and have excellent predictive power but are not suited to studies of extensive interfaces because of their computational cost and difficulty of execution [27,28,29]. Feature-based approaches use machine learning models to evaluate several sequence and structural characteristics of interfaces for hotspot prediction such as residue location, type, conservation and solvent accessibility [30] and are computationally efficient, but may be oversensitive to the selected features they consider [31]. Several studies have demonstrated that hotspot prediction can be improved by combining various energetic- and feature-based models [32,33,34,35].",

We previously developed an in silico approach employing computational alanine scanning to identify a network of hotspot residues in conserved motifs within the intraprotomer, interprotomer and interpentamer subunit interfaces of enterovirus capsids that are possibly involved in capsid uncoating and RNA release [36]. The study contributed to the understanding of the conserved molecular determinants that modulate enterovirus capsid stability at a genus level; however, knowledge regarding the residues that critically contribute to the assembly and stability of capsids belonging to picornaviruses from other genera remains limited. Identifying these specific residues in other picornaviruses is imperative for a comprehensive understanding of picornavirus capsids and how they are assembled and disassembled, but also for the development of improved broad-spectrum strategies to control these significant viruses. The present study elucidates the residues at the intraprotomer, interprotomer and interpentamer interfaces that contribute to the stability and assembly of the Theiler\u2019s murine encephalomyelitis virus (TMEV) capsid, using an in silico screen that combines five readily accessible energy- and feature-based models for hotspot prediction. The hotspot residues are further assessed to differentiate between those which are unique to the TMEV capsid and those which are conserved within capsids of viruses across the family. Our findings demonstrate that hotspot residues unique to TMEV are predominantly found at the intra- and interprotomer interfaces of the capsid, but many hotspots in the same interfaces and particularly those between pentamers are conserved in viruses from other genera, suggesting that molecular determinants of capsid stability may be somewhat conserved across the family.",

To reduce computing time, single complexes representing the intraprotomer, interprotomer and interpentamer interfaces were generated by extracting the relevant protomer subunits from a homology model of the complete biological assembly of TMEV GDVII [37,38]. Protomers in the biological assembly are numbered P1\u2013P60 according to their position in the capsid, where P1\u2013P5 constitutes the first pentamer and P6\u2013P10 the second pentamer. Protomers in the derived subcomplexes were labelled according to this scheme. To represent the intraprotomer interface, a single TMEV protomer (P1) was extracted (Figure 2A). To represent the interprotomer interface, two adjacent protomers within a single pentamer were extracted (P1 and P2) (Figure 2B). Finally, to represent the interpentamer interface, two complexes were generated using three protomers. The first complex, shown in Figure 2C, consisted of a protomer (P1) from one pentamer and an opposing protomer from the adjacent pentamer located across the two-fold axis (P22). The second complex comprised the same protomer (P1), but the second protomer was the adjacent protomer (P23) in the adjacent pentamer located next to the three-fold axis of symmetry (Figure 2D).",

We previously identified a network of conserved interacting motifs within the subunit interfaces of enterovirus capsids and used in silico alanine scanning to elucidate hotspot residues within these preserved regions that contribute to the stability, assembly and uncoating of enteroviruses [36]. In the current study we made use of a different strategy for the prediction of hotspots in the TMEV capsid. Hotspots were identified throughout the entire subunit\u2013subunit interface, rather than in conserved motifs alone, and the conservation of TMEV hotspots was determined thereafter. The rationale for this approach was twofold. Firstly, it allows for the identification of nonconserved hotspots at an individual virus level that have evolved to stabilize the capsid in a manner unique to the virus\u2019s life cycle; secondly, it allows for the extraction of hotspot residues that are conserved in related viruses, which may provide insights into family-wide mechanisms of capsid stability. In this study, we integrated two energy- and three feature-based tools for hotspot prediction, as the use of multiple methods in combination has been shown to improve prediction accuracy [32,33,34,35].",

In this study, residues W202, W206, F215 (VP1) and Y135 (VP2) which form hydrophobic interactions between the VP1\u2013VP2 interface were detected as stabilizing hotspots. This finding supports earlier suggestions that these residues form a hydrophobic core that stabilizes the VP1 and VP2 loops [49]. Moreover, the screen detected VP2 residue E146 as a hotspot that interacts with non-hotspot D241 (VP1) through hydrogen bonds that were previously speculated to contribute to stability of the VP1 loop [49]. It has been suggested that stabilizing interactions between capsid subunit loops are also important for TMEV pathogenesis [49,57]. We detected residues R94, W95 and V96 (VP1) as hotspots that form interactions with hotspot residues F176 and M178 in VP2. Interactions between these residues were previously demonstrated to be essential for stability of the VP1-2 loops and the virus life cycle, as substitution of a neighbouring amino acid to a bulkier residue drastically attenuated virus growth and persistence [50,57].",

            "text": "The pentamer subunits are highly stable intermediates during capsid assembly and uncoating [10,62]. It is speculated that evolution has favoured strong interactions between the interprotomer interfaces, as pentamers are not required to dissociate into protomers during uncoating, and strong interactions promote higher concentrations of intact pentamers for efficient capsid assembly [9]. To identify hotspot residues that contribute to the stability of the interprotomer interfaces, a complex of two adjacent protomers was submitted for analysis. Thirty-four residues were predicted as hotspots, which mainly form hydrogen bonds and hydrophobic interactions with partner residues across the interface. Hotspot residues P153 (VP1) and I181 (VP3) which interact with partner residues in VP3 and VP2 respectively, were previously shown to be located within the TMEV receptor binding site [52]. This is unsurprising considering that the receptor binding sites of most picornaviruses, such as the canyons of enteroviruses, involve residues that traverse the protomer\u2013protomer interfaces [63,64]. Furthermore, P153 was previously reported to be directly involved in binding the TMEV co-receptor, following a series of in vitro substitution experiments that attenuated or abolished receptor binding and infectivity [52]. The uncoating mechanism of TMEV is poorly understood, and the insensitivity of TMEV to acidic conditions suggests that uncoating may be induced by receptor binding, unlike other cardioviruses [49,65]. It is tempting to speculate that the binding of the TMEV co-receptor, or unknown primary receptor, to energetically important hotspots including P153 may destabilize the interface and contribute to the induction of uncoating. Conversely, these hotspots may maintain the binding site in the correct conformation for receptor interactions but may not be destabilized upon binding.",

Interestingly, several interprotomer hotspot residues belonging to VP1 and 2 correspond to residues in the SAFV-3 A-particle that maintain their interactions during expansion where they surround the edges of the five-fold pore. In TMEV these hotspots are involved in strong hydrophobic interactions with their partner residues. A second set of TMEV hotspots in VP1 and 3 that form weaker hydrogen bonds with their partner residues correspond to residues in SAFV-3 that undergo conformational changes to yield the pore [53]. It is tempting to speculate that these conserved residues function similarly in TMEV. Residues at the interprotomer interfaces in picornaviruses are variable and contribute to a variety of topological features that are species-specific [49,64,66]. Despite the variability of amino acids at the interprotomer interfaces, 22 of the 34 residues predicted as hotspots were conserved in representative viruses from other genera, suggesting that the mechanisms that regulate the stability of the interprotomer interfaces may be somewhat conserved across the picornavirus family.",

            "text": "It is generally accepted that the interfaces between pentamer subunits are major sites of structural rearrangement during capsid uncoating. For example, studies have widely documented the formation of pores at these interfaces [67,68,69,70,71,72,73] or the loss of one or more pentamer subunit(s) [53,58,74,75] upon exposure of the picornavirus capsid to denaturing conditions. To identify the hotspot residues that are critical to the binding specificity and stability of the pentamer interfaces, complexes of two opposing protomers at the two-fold axis and two adjacent protomers at the three-fold axis were analysed. Twenty-four residues were identified as stabilizing hotspots at these interfaces; however, the residues are doubled across the entire pentamer interface as four protomers are involved. Most of the hotspot residues formed hydrogen bonds with partner residues across the interface, although hydrophobic interactions were more common near to the two-fold axis, consistent with suggestions that weak noncovalent interactions mediate pentamer\u2013pentamer binding [9,76,77]. Unlike the intraprotomer and interprotomer interfaces, all hotspot residues at the interpentamer interface were conserved in at least one other virus of the family. Residues P195 and Y198 in VP3 were the only hotspots conserved in cardiovirus representatives alone, while hotspots R61 (VP2), K124, D152 and T194 (VP3) were universally conserved in all representatives from the cardio-, seneca-, aphtho- and enteroviruses. Interestingly, these residues correspond to residues R60, R120, D148 and T190 in FMDV, respectively, which were shown to be fundamental for virus growth and capsid stability following the in vitro substitution of these residues to alanine [11]. TMEV hotspot Y62 (VP2) is replaced in the seneca-, aphtho- and enteroviruses by residues with similar properties. It was previously shown that substitution of F62 in FMDV Type O and SAT 2 to the tyrosine observed in TMEV improved the thermostability of FMDV [55].",

Furthermore, hotspots M144, I150, D152 and L153 (VP3) are conserved with residues in human rhinovirus (HRV)-2 that become disordered during uncoating and RNA release [56]. HRVs are prone to dissociation in acidic conditions, and histidine residues at the two-fold axis have been implicated in this sensitivity. Residues in HRV-B14 corresponding to TMEV hotspots R61 (VP2) and K124 (VP3) form interactions with histidine residues and become destabilized at mild acidity [78]. However, in TMEV, these hotspots form interactions with partner residues which resist protonation under mildly acidic conditions. Furthermore, hotspot R61 forms cation\u2013pi interactions with hotspot Y148 (VP3) in TMEV but in HRV-B14 Y148 is replaced with the acid-sensitive H150. These findings may partially explain the different pH stabilities of these viruses.",

Many of the predicted hotspots, particularly those between pentamers, were conserved with residues reported to be important for virus growth and capsid stability in representative viruses across the family. This finding suggests that the molecular determinants of capsid stability may be conserved across the picornaviruses, providing a logical basis for further investigations into the significance of these residues to aspects of the virus life cycle. For example, our preliminary in vitro mutagenesis experiments have demonstrated that conserved hotspot residues predicted in the interpentamer interface are required for the development of cytopathic effect in permissive cells, but not for viral replication or protein synthesis. Finally, the analysis presented here can be applied to any icosahedral virus as a first step in identifying residues that significantly contribute to the stability and assembly of the viral capsid, which represent potential antiviral targets.",
