This was one of several measures implemented to limit the importation of COVID-19. Other measures included entry restrictions for tourists from high-risk countries, temperature and health screening at ports of entry, and advising residents against all travel. 1 SHN was conceptualized to restrict travellers to a place of residence for one incubation period, so as to prevent subsequent local transmission and to detect infections early. Visitors have to provide proof of the place where they will serve SHN, such as hotels or a family member's home. Persons under SHN are instructed to remain in a separate room and to minimize contact with others, such as by having meals placed outside their rooms.",

Persons under quarantine are transferred directly to hospital via ambulance for testing if they develop symptoms, whereas persons under SHN can be assessed at primary care clinics. Nonetheless, both are similar in concept and legally enforceable. Persons under SHN are sent text messages on their mobile phones at random times during the day with a unique web link. When clicked, the link prompts the individual to turn on the GPS location service to report his or her location. If the individual does not respond within an hour, public officials will make video calls or house visits. The Infectious Diseases Act provides legal power to prosecute non-compliance, including electronic tagging with tracking devices, fines and imprisonment.",

In the 2 weeks from 18-31 March 2020, only 10 secondary cases arose from 207 travellers put on SHN, mostly in the household setting. In contrast, 24 secondary cases arose from 195 travellers before the SHN rules were in place. The 7-day moving average of the interval from symptom onset to isolation for imported cases in Singapore has decreased from 9.0 to 0.9 days. 2 The finding of some household transmissions from persons under SHN prompted authorities to introduce a tighter \"enhanced SHN\" regime, with mandatory stays in government-designated hotels for those returning from countries with high-risk of importation of COVID-19. Since 26 March 2020, returnees from the UK and USA are put on enhanced SHN in view of the large number of returnees from these countries testing positive for SARS-CoV-2. This was extended to returnees from all countries on 9 April 2020. Travellers are transported directly from the airport to the hotels, where they are not allowed to leave their individual rooms, which are managed with infection control precautions. The government pays for their stay, including meals and laundry. Over 12,000 hotel rooms were reserved for this purpose, which also supports the hospitality industry. Of note, there has been no secondary transmission from travellers under enhanced SHN to date.",
