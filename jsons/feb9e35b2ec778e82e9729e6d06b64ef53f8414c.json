Several considerations have been incorporated throughout the time such as backorders and imperfect quality. More recently, sustainability issues have also been introduced to the literature of inventory models remarking the increasing importance of the three bottom line: environment, social and economic criteria. In that sense, the aim of this research work is to develop a new sustainable inventory model considering a discontinuous transportation cost function and a new carbon emissions function to include different sources of pollution in the decision making process that are not taken into account using the traditional approaches in the inventory literature. The proposed inventory model permits to obtain a continuous and a discrete solution for the lot size and constitutes an easy-to-use process that can be implemented in a simple manner.",

            "text": "The concerns and efforts on reducing greenhouse gases (GHG) emissions and their corresponding effect on global warming have incremented through the years. The Kyoto protocol was established in the United Nations framework in 1997 and it was ratified by 156 countries. According to Almer and Winkler (2017) the main objective of Kyoto protocol is to establish the reduction of GHG emissions in 5.2% with respect to 1990. Later, in 2015, the Paris agreement was introduced and entered into vigor in 2016. This protocol was approved by 195 countries and its aim is to keep the increment of global temperature below 2 degrees Celsius and to pursue efforts to limit the temperature rise below to 1.5 degrees Celsius (United Nationsclimate change, 2018). Additionally, it seeks to strengthen the ability of countries to deal with the impacts of climate change. In that sense, each country makes efforts to reduce the environmental impact in some specific areas. For example, Wang, et al. (2019) states to consider environmental issues in logistic activities. Since Harris, (1913) formulated the economic order quantity (EOQ) inventory model in 1913, different characteristics, including sustainability criteria, have been incorporated into a common framework which is the EOQ inventory model. Arslan and Turkay (2013) revised the standard EOQ inventory model to integrate sustainability considerations that take account of environmental issues. In that work the authors include objectives and constraints; and they analyze five different approaches: Direct accounting, carbon tax, direct cap, cap and trade and carbon offsets. As it is depicted in the latter work, the most practical approach is the direct accounting approach because the sustainability issues are translated into costs and modeled as a part of the total cost function.",

They examine the impact of carbon cap and carbon price on order size as a method of inducing the retailer to reduce carbon emissions that result in the increase of total costs. Bonney and Jaber (2011) discussed in depth how to design responsible inventory systems including not only the importance of some activities in the total cost of the system but also their effect in the environment and interrelations with other activities. Additionally, a simplistic model that extends the EOQ to include some environmental costs is proposed. Chen et al. (2013) analyzed if it is possible to reduce emissions by changing the order quantities. Moreover, they provide a condition under which the reduction in carbon emissions is greater than the increment in cost and studied which factors affect the difference between these two quantities.",

(2013) proposed carbon emission constraints in a multisourcing lot-sizing problem. The aim of these constraints is to put a limit in the carbon emission per unit of product supplied. Furthermore, this inventory model considers a multi-sourcing lot-sizing problem in which a company must determine, over a planning horizon of T periods, when, where and how much to produce of an item in order to satisfy a deterministic time-dependent demand. Moreover, different production locations and transportation modes are available to satisfy the demand. Benjaafar et al. (2013) proposed an inventory model that incorporates carbon emission constraints on single and multi-stage lot-sizing models with a cost minimization objective. For this purpose, four regulatory policy settings are considered, based respectively on a strict carbon cap, a tax on the amount of emissions, the cap-and-trade system and the possibility to invest in carbon offsets to mitigate carbon caps.",

For instance, Rosi\u010d and Jammernegg (2013) extended the dual sourcing model based on the newsvendor framework by considering the environmental impact of transport. In the first step, the effect of a linear carbon emission tax on transport is analyzed, and in the second step, an emission trading scheme for the transport sector is proposed. Choi and Chiu (2012) explored the mean-downside-risk (MDR) and mean-variance (MV) newsvendor models under both the exogenous and endogenous retail price decision cases. First, analytical models with the MDR and MV objectives are constructed. Then, it is shown that the analytical solution schemes for both the MDR and MV problems are the same. In contrast, a different approach is proposed by Glock (2012) who focuses on coordinated inventory replenishment decisions between buyer and vendor and their impact on the performance of the supply chain. The joint economic lot size (JELS) models determine simultaneously the order, production and shipment quantities from the perspective of the supply chain with the objective of minimizing total system costs whereas carbon emissions constraints are considered.",

The proposed methodology is useful to include the effects of the environment on the social aspect, more specifically human health because of the emission of different gases.

The authors considered a single period inventory model with recycling action and the government subsidy for one and two supply option systems. Then, the effects of environmentally sensitive for customers and the green degree of products on the pricing policies are studied. Finally, Tiwari et al.

To optimize the total cost function, a Taylor polynomial is used and therefore, the optimization procedure is based on an approximation. This approximation is analyzed, and a sensitivity analysis is carried out to figure out how the accuracy of the approximation changes as the value of parameters increases or decreases. Additionally, an algorithm and a numerical experiment are carried out when the order quantity is considered as a continuous and discrete variable. From this mathematical procedure, it is worth highlighting that a useful approximation is obtained which not only allows to minimize the cost of the inventory system when the lot size is a continuous variable but also to optimize the inventory policy when the lot size is an integer value.",

The emissions ( \uf065 ) per replenishment are associated with the carbon emissions of activities done during each cycle such as the use of some machines. An amount g of emissions per unit of average inventory level is incurred too.

This can be an attribute of the carbon emissions behavior of some machines whose emissions are related to their energy consumption (that is proportional to the average inventory level during a period). However, if it is assumed that these machines are turned off and turned on every cycle, the corresponding carbon emissions can grow rapidly since a small batch size implies many orders over a period which means, for instance, to turn off and turn on the air conditioner several times diminishing its performance.",

Regarding the discontinuity points, it is considered that the supplier has two options of containers for transporting the product. The capacities of each container 12 ( , ) yy are (300,600). Moreover, since there are only two containers of each type available, six ranges are studied and enumerated in the first column in Table 2 . Using the values of parameters in Table 1 and the algorithm (main procedure) previously described in Subsection 4.1, the obtained results are shown in Table 2 and Table 3 . Table 2 is obtained by using the 13 total cost function and in Table 3 , the results are obtained using the proposed approximation total cost function. It must be observed that the results are pretty similar. The main procedure is applied to obtain Table 2 and Table 3 . For each range, a local minimum is obtained using equation (28) and it is allocated in column '* j Q app for the j th range. It must be reminded that this formula uses an approximation and this lot size is not the corresponding local minimum for the total cost function in (20). However, the true local optimal is obtained by using Lingo and is reported is column '* j Q opt for the j th range. Then, carrying out the optimization algorithm implies the evaluation of a cost function, for each range, in the local minimum found by using equation (28) (or Lingo) or the in the discontinuity points. It must be also realized that in case the local minimum is obtained using equation (28) or Lingo for a certain range, the condition true (T) or false (F) is reported in column T/F. There are two options to carry out the main procedure: to use the total cost function (TC) in equation (20) or the approximated total cost function (AC) in equation (25). Then, both options are implemented in Table 2 and In Figure 2 , it is observed that there are several points of discontinuity (two in the graph). Moreover, it is proved that the optimal solution is * opt Q = 486.084 from Table 2 . By using the approximation, as it is proposed in the model formulation, the optimum is * app Q = 486.078 which is reported in Table 3 .",

The difference between the sustainable lot size and the merely environmental lot size is 2.8301%. It is worth noting that the corresponding region in the total cost function is pretty flat. Therefore, the variation in total costs is negligible. It is observed that as the value of the parameter r increases, the region in which the optimal lot size for the total cost has been found has become flatter. Then, the variation in the total cost function is negligible for high values of r , for any value of the lot size in the corresponding range. However, as it is concluded from the sensitivity analysis, as the parameter r grows, the accuracy of the approximation diminishes. Then, a trade-off between the accuracy of the approximation and the possibility of obtaining a flat optimal-lot-size region needs to be considered.

Then, mathematical relationships for r and l are developed. Finally, a practical methodology to understand and to obtain the parameter r and l is developed.As it is mentioned in the mathematical formulation, there are some emissions 2 () CO Q depending on the lot size that cannot be explained as the typical equationsince the first term is decrescent 23 and the last one is crescent regarding to the lot size and there are some activities or components of the inventory system that does not fit with this behavior. Then, a new expression is proposed as follows:The difference between the formulas is the addend 2 rD Q Q le . The amount of carbon emissions, according to this new expression, is supposed to grow while the lot size does tend to a straight line for lot sizes above a critical value that is introduced in this work as the critical lot size and represented as * Q . It is also observed that the annual amount of emissions is increasing rapidly while the lot size decreases below * Q . The benefit of using this expression is the possibility of incorporating the emissions curve behavior of some machines that depends on the average inventory level when the lot size is above a certain value. However, when the number of orders during a period of time is above a critical number of orders * N and its corresponding lot size is below the critical lot size * Q the amount of emissions during the year increases rapidly in a very undesired way for the company purposes.By modifying the parameters r and l , the curve shape can fit into a variety of shapes for different company purposes. This new expression can model the behavior of some machines such as industrial air conditioners.If we assume that a plant needs to be turned on and down each cycle to make the replenishment of products, the number of orders affects considerably the environmental performance.On the other hand, for large lot sizes, the amount of emissions during a period of time increases in a closed way to a straight line since the average inventory level is proportional to the amount of energy consumed by the air conditioner and its corresponding carbon footprint. However, when the number of cycles increases above its * N , the environmental performance of the air conditioner is affected since it is turned on and down too many times. Then, the corresponding carbon emissions to that range of lot sizes is then increasing undesirably.It is worth noting that fixing r and l the corresponding emissions curve could be modeled and the carbon emissions function proposed in Section 3 can be used with the algorithm introduced in this work (main procedure and discretization algorithm). Until now, the parameters r and l are introduced as shape parameters. However, it is useful to observe some mathematical relationships for both to improve the understanding of these parameters from a more practical point of view.",
