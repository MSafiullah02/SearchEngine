Concerning its spread in Italy, at the web-page [1] a basic SIR model has been initially used for this purpose. Even though this simple model has displayed interesting potentialities in yielding accurate predictions of the diffusion of the disease for the subsequent few days, it heavily relies on the assumption of homogeneity of the spread of epidemic across the country, which is evidently not the case. Furthermore, it cannot capture the possible interactions between the different areas of the country which, as is well known, has played an important role in the diffusion of the epidemic.",
