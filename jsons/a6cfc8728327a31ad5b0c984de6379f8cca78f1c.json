The effects of the COVID-19 health emergency will probably persist long after the peak of the pandemic has passed, especially in specialties such as vascular surgery; the majority of our patients are at high risk of COVID-19 related mortality. Admission to hospital risks exposure to the virus, while the acute on chronic nature of many vascular pathologies makes patients vulnerable to delay. Guidelines are updated frequently as the clinical picture changes. A significant proportion of vascular work involves pre-emptive intervention to prevent complications (e.g., carotid endarterectomy to reduce risk of stroke). For these reasons, vascular patients are particularly vulnerable to the postponement of their definitive treatment. There is an urgent need to quantify the impact of the pandemic on the provision of vascular and endovascular surgery, delays to treatment, and the adjustments made to standard vascular practice.",
