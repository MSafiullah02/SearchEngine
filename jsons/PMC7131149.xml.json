It is estimated that malaria is responsible for the annual deaths of more than one million people, mostly children under the age of five [1]. An effective malaria vaccine is urgently needed to control the disease. Major obstacles to developing an effective malaria vaccine include the complex life cycle and antigenic diversity of the parasite. Despite the challenges, encouraging results have been reported recently for RTS,S, a pre-erythrocytic, circumsporozoite protein (CSP)-based vaccine. This leading candidate has demonstrated protection against clinical malaria in malaria-na\u00efve adults in Phase 2a experimental challenge studies [2] and in African children in a Phase 2b field trial [3], [4].",

            "text": "The traditional approach for malaria vaccine development is based on recombinant proteins. However, one of the main challenges for a recombinant protein-based vaccine is that the protein itself is poorly immunogenic. As such, many recombinant protein-based vaccines require the addition of an adjuvant to boost immune responses, especially when a Th1-biased immune response is desired. Most of the experimental malaria vaccines are currently using adjuvants that have yet to be used in licensed vaccines. In addition, many antigenic targets are highly structured and proper conformation seems to be required to generate a functional immune response. This leads to challenges in developing the purification process where refolding and isolation of proper conformers often results in complex manufacturing processes and low yields. Another challenge is the long-term stability of recombinant proteins when they are formulated in adjuvants at ambient temperatures. Viral vectors, on the other hand, appear to be capable of inducing both antibody and T-cell-mediated immunity in the absence of an adjuvant. Furthermore, complex process development may not be required for viral-vectored vaccines, which usually have a consistent purification process, irrespective of the transgene they express. As these vaccines use the eukaryotic cellular machinery to generate the antigenic targets, it may be possible to generate antigens with native conformation. Finally, some of the viral vectors have the capacity to deliver more than one gene. Thus, a single viral vectored construct may contain multiple antigens from the different parasite life stages and would have the potential to induce a broad protective immunity. Significant manufacturing cost savings could also be realized.",

Although earlier studies have generated mixed results, recently there have been substantial advances in applying viral vectors towards malaria vaccine development, and such vaccines have progressed to through Phase 2b efficacy testing in African children. Viral-vectored vaccines have shown some efficacy in malaria vaccine trials in humans but not so far in other diseases. At the same time, significant progress has been made in developing new viral-vector technologies, and some of them are being used for the development of HIV vaccines. To facilitate the application of viral vectors for malaria vaccine development, the PATH Malaria Vaccine Initiative (MVI) organized a workshop on \u201cViral Vectors for Malaria Vaccine Development.\u201d The purpose of the workshop was to share experience in vector technologies and in malaria vaccine development, which could be very valuable in designing the next generation of effective viral-vectored malaria vaccines.",

The vaccine candidate was tested in a Phase 1/2a human trial [8]. Immune responses to all antigens except SERA were detected, although the titers were low. Vaccine doses of 108 plaque forming unit (PFU) appeared to be more immunogenic than 107\n pfu. Pre-existing immunity against vaccinia virus appeared capable of modulating immunogenicity. The immunized subjects were subsequently challenged with P. falciparum-infected mosquitoes. One of the 35 immunized patients was fully protected from the challenge. An average of a 2-day delay in the pre-patent period was detected in the vaccinees.",

Studies in an animal model demonstrated that all six antigens in the candidate were immunogenic. In addition to its utility as a vector, data in mice indicate that poxvirus can enhance the immunogenicity of recombinant protein-based vaccines through co-administration, indicating that the virus may be capable of acting as an adjuvant [17]. This finding raises the intriguing prospect of using a vectored vaccine to deliver malaria antigens while simultaneously serving as an immunostimulator for recombinant proteins.",

One of the vaccines contains blood-stage antigens AMA-1 and MSP-1, the other contains three pre-erythrocytic antigens CSP, LSA-1 and TRAP. Each of the malaria antigens is being optimized for expression in mammalian cells and for immunogenicity in animal models. It is known that there are significant differences in protein synthesis between protozoan and mammalian cells. For example, codon-usage of the Plasmodium gene is different from the mammalian gene. Codon-optimization significantly increases the expression level of Plasmodium antigen in mammalian cells. In addition, other than the glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchor that attaches some of the antigens to the parasite surface, native P. falciparum proteins are not glycosylated [21]. However, AMA-1 and MSP-1 of P. falciparum contain multiple potential N- and O-linked glycosylation sites. It has been reported in one study that N-glycosylation of MSP-1 in mammalian cells decreased protective immune responses in non-human primates [22], whereas O-glycosylation of AMA1 did not appear to have an effect on the functionality of the antigens [23]. Studies are therefore being conducted to determine whether the removal of N-glycosylation sites leads to increased immunogenicity of the adenovirus-vectored, blood-stage vaccines.",

Attempts are being made to replace the Plasmodial GPI signal sequence with the mammalian sequence to improve the immunogenicity of the adenovirus-vectored MSP-1 vaccine. Also, the presence of GPI signal sequences appear to interfere with protein expression. For example, GPI signal sequence from CSP has been shown to affect protein expression in vitro and immunogenicity in a rodent model [25]. Site-directed mutagenesis is being conducted to reduce antigen-related toxicity and to improve the immunogenicity of the pre-erythrocytic stage vaccines. In addition, the use of a single adenovirus vector for expression of multiple antigens using different promoters is being studied. Preliminary studies suggest that the RSV promoter exhibits reduced gene expression and immunogenicity in animal models as compared to the cytomegalovirus (CMV) promoter (J.

Pre-existing immunity has been shown to reduce the immunogenicity of these adenovirus-vectored vaccines in animal models [26], [27], [28]. Seroprevalence for Ad5 is as high as 95% in Africa [29], [30]. To overcome the pre-existing immunity against Ad5, a new adenovirus vector based on serotype 35 (Ad35) has been developed [30], [31], [32], [33], [34], [35]. The seroprevalence against Ad35 is significantly lower than that for Ad5. In Africa for example, Ad35 seroprevalence is only about 20%. [29], [30] The Ad35 vector can be produced in PER.C6/55 K cells, a PER.C6 cell line that has been modified to express the Ad35-E1B 55 K protein [31], or in 293ORF6 cells, a cell line that is currently used for cGMP manufacturing of experimental vaccines. Ad35 can efficiently transduce human antigen-presenting cells. An Ad35 expressing CSP of P. yoelii has been tested in mice and shown to be highly immunogenic and protective [36]. Pre-existing immunity to Ad5 virus did not inhibit the immunogenicity of Ad35-derived vaccines. An Ad35 vector expressing CSP of P. falciparum (Ad35-CS) was tested in rhesus macaques. Ad35-CS induced a strong T- and B-cell-immune response. Interestingly, in contrast to Ad5-based vectors, Ad35 vectors are efficient in homologous prime-boost studies in primates. This construct is scheduled for testing in humans. In addition, a new candidate, Ad35.LCS, expressing a polypeptide containing LSA-1, CSP and STARP of P. falciparum, is being constructed. Future work will determine whether the three malaria antigens act synergistically in inducing protective immunity.",

Protective immunity was also studied in the P. yoelii rodent malaria model. Immunization regimens including a poxvirus vector as a boost resulted in the highest level of protective immunity. However, this protective immunity appeared to be short-lived, as there was a significant reduction in protection 6 months post-immunization.

MV has been used to express antigens derived from SIV, HIV, hepatitis B, mumps, WN virus and SARS-CoV [58], [59], [60], [61]. In most of these studies, recombinant MVs that express heterologous antigens appeared to induce specific humoral neutralizing antibodies in a transgenic mouse model [62]. The MV expressing HIV Gag or Env were capable of inducing cellular immune responses to these proteins [58], [60]. Moreover, in transgenic mice and macaques, MV expressing gp140 was capable of inducing anti-HIV antibody responses in the presence of pre-existing immunity against MV [58], [60], [63]. MV expressing P. falciparum MSP-1 is being investigated for use in malaria vaccine development (J.-F. Viret, personal communication). Due to the established safety profile of MV vaccine, it is recommended for young infants after the age of 6 months. In addition, several reports have established the safety of the vaccine in children after an aerosolized application [64], [65]. In this context, the approval of MV vaccination as an aerosol would open the way towards its application in younger infants even in the presence of pre-existing maternal antibodies. Therefore, the usefulness of MV in malaria vaccine development should be investigated for its ability to protect infants and children, with the added benefit of a simultaneous immunization against measles, one of the high priorities of WHO's Expanded Program on Immunization [63]. Alternatively, MV may also be used as a booster in a heterologous prime-boost regime for young infants.",

However, the virus can also be transmitted to livestock, causing vesicular lesions on the skin around the mouth, nostrils and teats. Human infection with wild type (wt) VSV is rare, and consequently there is a very low VSV sero-prevalence in the human population. When VSV does infect humans, it is either asymptomatic or may result in a mild, self-limited, flu-like illness. When it became possible to recover VSV from genomic cDNA, the potential of recombinant VSV (rVSV) as a vaccine vector was explored. In the SHIV challenge model, it has been demonstrated that rVSV expressing SIV gag and HIV env provides significant protection against development of AIDS in non-human primates (NHPs) [66]. However, results from an exploratory neurovirulence (NV) study in NHPs indicated that rVSV was insufficiently attenuated for human testing. The NV phenotype represented a potential obstacle to regulatory approval of rVSV vaccine vectors. To address this problem, a variety of strategies were developed to generate further attenuated rVSV vectors. As a result of these efforts, two rVSV mutants, N4CT1 and N4CT9, which have the N gene translocated from the first to the fourth position in the genome, and the cytoplasmic tail (CT) of the attachment (G) protein truncated from 29 amino acids to either one or nine amino acids, respectively, were generated and shown to cause very minimal neuropathology in a subsequent NHP NV study. Surprisingly, the highly attenuated N4CT1 and N4CT9 rVSV vectors expressing HIV gag were shown to be more immunogenic than the much more virulent prototypic rVSV-gag vector, following intramuscular inoculation of mice. Both attenuated vectors also elicited cellular immune responses in NHPs that were equivalent in magnitude to responses elicited by the prototypic rVSV-gag vector (D. Clarke, personal communication).",

Understanding the unique properties of individual vectors to induce humoral and cellular immunity is an important aspect in vaccine design. The classical vaccinia virus vector appears to be less effective in priming immune responses, but is excellent in boosting immune responses. As such, it is likely that a vaccinia virus vector will be useful in heterologous prime-boosting regimens in combination with other vectors or DNA/protein-based vaccines. Replication-deficient adenovirus vectors have been shown to be excellent in priming and boosting immune responses, in particular for generating cellular immune responses. Therefore, it may be the preferred vehicle for T-cell-based vaccines. However, most of the adenovirus-vectored vaccines are based on Ad5. Therefore overcoming pre-existing immunity against the adenovirus vector may be critical for vaccine development. Alphavirus vectors have been shown to be excellent in inducing antibody responses in animal models. They may be useful for blood stage or sexual stage malaria vaccines, where it has been demonstrated that antibody responses are associated with inhibition against parasite growth. However, a cGMP manufacturing production cell line is needed for alphavirus vectors. The current production process using electroporation is unlikely to be suitable for commercial manufacturing.",

Removal of N-glycosylation sites should be evaluated for maintenance of the conformation and antigenicity of the native protein. For proteins that are targeted for antibody responses, there may be a need to exchange signal peptide and anchor sequence to mammalian-like signals to facilitate transportation to the cell surface. Finally, as some of the Plasmodial antigens may be toxic to the vector or mammalian cells, site-directed mutagenesis may be necessary to reduce the toxicity.",
