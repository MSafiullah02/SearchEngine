Few have 17 redeployed residents and most are increasingly relying on teleconferencing solutions for 18 meetings and resident education. Most commonly programs are using faculty-(91%) or resident-19 led (65%) lectures, though nearly 75% are supplementing resident education with materials from 20 the Congress of Neurological Surgeons (CNS). Continuing education in spite of decreased case 21 volume and maintaining resident morale are cited as the most common concerns of PDs. 22 23 Conclusion 24 Here we find that there is great homogeneity in the responses of neurosurgical residency 25 programs to the COVID-19 pandemic. Programs are increasingly incorporating teleconferencing 26 platforms and third-party education materials, most commonly materials from the CNS. 27 Additionally, most respondents indicated that their program has not redeployed residents in the 28 care of COVID-19 positive patients. The results of the present study may assist program 29 directors in developing a uniform resident curriculum and consider wellness initiatives during 30 this time of crisis. 31 With the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic and the resultant cancellation of elective surgical  1  cases nationwide, 1 there have been significant changes to how neurosurgery is taught and  2 practiced. The dramatic decrease in operative cases has significantly impacted the training of 3 neurosurgical residents, who depend on elective surgical volume to hone their clinical and 4 operative skills. 2 As residents must meet minimum case volumes to demonstrate proficiency 5 upon program completion, 3 there is concern among both residents and program directors 6 regarding the severity of the impact of COVID-19 on neurosurgical resident education. 4 7 8 Recently, several centers have reported the significant changes that their departments have 9",
