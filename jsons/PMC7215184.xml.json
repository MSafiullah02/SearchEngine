Actually, this is a fundamental feature of a multi-agent system (such as a group decision and negotiation) where there is no agent as an (absolute) authority who can command and control other agents\u2019 behaviors [19]; thus, influencing an agent\u2019s preference is the precondition of influencing his/her behavior. Therefore, in the context of a group decision and negotiation, not only the mutual influence among agents\u2019 preferences should be discussed, but also the transformation from agents\u2019 influenced preferences to their behaviors needs to be investigated. In fact, an influenced (updated) preference will possibly lead to the adoption of a (new) behavior, or not [21]. There is randomness due to bounded rationality and changing environment. The conditions for the generation of behaviors under influence is an important issue that deserves full discussions.",

In fact, a family is a very typical group composed of more than one member, with abundant group behaviors and full of constant communications among members. The interactions among family members consist of typical group decisions and negotiations. Particularly in a \u201cdemocratic\u201d instead of \u201cdictatorial\u201d family, all family members collectively make decisions and ceaselessly negotiate on critical family issues, such as whether and when to bear a child. This kind of decision will profoundly change the life of a family in the long-term, thus, all family members will join the process of decision-making and usually all try their best to convince and influence other members with their own preferences in order to achieve a desirable result. For example, a couple does not want to bear a child, but the couple\u2019s parents may have strong intentions to have a grandchild and will try to convince the couple from time to time; on the other side, the couple may resist their parents\u2019 \u201ctraditional\u201d opinions and even try to sell their own \u201cmodern\u201d ideas to their parents. Therefore, the case of fertility intention and behavior in families could be a perfect example to study the mutual influence among preferences and its transformation to behaviors in groups.",

Particularly in China, families\u2019 reproductive behaviors are profoundly affected and constrained by the population and fertility policies. The well-known fertility policy in China was simplified as the \u201cone-child policy\u201d, which had been strictly enforced on childbearing behaviors (especially of urban residents) for more than three decades [10, 28]. Under the one-child policy, 36% of the population strictly had only one child; 53% of the population were permitted to have a second child if their first child was a girl; 9.6% of the population were permitted to have two children regardless of their first child\u2019s gender; and 1.6% (mainly ethnic minority) had no limit at all [3]. It implies an average of 1.47 children per couple [11], falling far under the international population replacement rate of 2.1 (which means the population of China will be decreasing fast in the future). The tremendous reduction in fertility rate, together with the improved life expectancy and other demographic and socioeconomic factors, has forced China to face a more rapid and serious challenge of population aging than other countries (particularly the so-called \u201caging before getting rich\u201d1).",

The new policy is called the \u201cuniversal two-child policy\u201d. Because of this major change of fertility policy, approximately an additional 90 million women have become eligible to have the second child [31]. The implications of the universal two-child policy are of great public interest and policy concern. However, the fertility intention and actual fertility behavior may significantly differ from what is intended by the policy. A few studies have estimated the long-term effects of this new policy on fertility level and population aging [30, 32]. Till now, the actual fertility rate under the new policy has been much lower than the government\u2019s expectation.",

Moreover, Verhulst proposed Logistic block population growth model, which could better describe the variation of population growth [2, 18, 29]. Leslie came up with a comprehensive population prediction model, the well-known Leslie Matrix model, containing multiple factors [22]. Subsequently, an innovative population optimal model that accurately describes the dynamic changes of people\u2019s ages was developed by Andrew and Meen [1].",

This paper introduces an agent-based modeling and simulation approach for the study of fertility behavior and population growth. It is based on a set of intelligent and autonomous agents that can communicate, interact and influence with each other. Each agent represents an individual member of a family and a multi-agent system represents the interaction among family members. In each interaction, every agent\u2019s preference (namely, a family member\u2019s fertility intention) is influenced by his/her own and other agents\u2019 preferences (namely, other family members\u2019 fertility intentions). Under certain conditions based on fertility intentions, a fertility behavior of the family will be produced (namely, a child to be born).",

Further, we ran experiments and simulations for the study of the interaction of fertility intentions and the generation of fertility behaviors in families, from a micro perspective of individual interactions instead of conventional macro perspective of entire social system in Demography. Our agent-based model handles the complicated multiple influencing relationships (stronger or weaker, positive or negative) among individual members in families, and the transformation from family members\u2019 fertility intentions to prospective mothers\u2019 fertility behaviors with consideration of randomness. In our research, we designed a series of experimental programs, and monitored the dynamics of fertility intentions and behaviors, and particularly the number of new born children in the long-term. We hope that our results would contribute to discovering important factors that affect the fertility behavior and population growth under different policies (particularly under consideration of the policy changed from the one-child policy to the universal two-child policy in China) and help the government to adjust policies and strategies for the well-being of society. However, our work is not yet sufficient, as many other prospects remain. One aspect is about the advancements of the general model of influence among preferences and its transformation to behaviors:We express agents\u2019 preferences in a cardinal approach, assuming a normalized value as intention for each agent, and use the intention values of agents as probabilities for the generation of their behaviors to include randomness in the formulation of the transformation from preferences to behaviors. An ordinal approach to represent agents\u2019 preferences, particularly the preference ordering among multiple alternatives, could be tried in future work.We have not provided enough material to support the multi-agent system we designed to accurately characterize the dynamics of agents\u2019 preferences and behaviors due to mutual influence in groups in practice. In the future, the contributions of other disciplines such as logic and psychology, cognitive science and behavior science, particularly the empirical evidences in these fields, would be much valuable.We assumed a linear relation between agents\u2019 intentions and the generation of their behaviors: the higher an agent\u2019s intention is, the more possible it is to produce a behavior, and the return brought by the increase of intention is proportional. While in reality, there may be some thresholds of intentions for the generation of behaviors, which means the increase of intention within certain range may have very limited impacts, but once beyond a certain threshold, the return brought by the increase of intention will be much tremendous. The artificial neural network could be used to model the complicated psychical process under the transformation from intentions to behaviors of humans in future work, particularly making full use of all kinds of non-linear activation functions.\n",

From the economic (rational) perspective on fertility behavior, a utility-based approach may be recommended. In this approach, prospective parents may try to optimize the expected utility combing both assistance and care in the elderly period provided by their children and expense defrayed and energy consumed during the childhood of their children. Economists may encourage us to introduce to the agent-based model some economic variables.We assumed one usual household structure composed of a husband and a wife, both two (prospective) grandparents on each side, and several relatives and close friends on each side. But in real-world situations, there are more kinds of household structure, for instance, there are not four grandparents alive. More household structures can be designed in future work, particularly according to the result of the census of population.We mainly discussed the interaction of fertility intentions and the generation of fertility behaviors in families under the impact of population policy transition. While the fertility intention and behavior are closely related to cultural traditions which are hard to be measured from a computational perspective. For instance, in China, the effectiveness of the implementation of population polices are quite different in different areas. Therefore, the fertility intention and behavior are affected not only by state interventions. The interplay of political, economic and cultural factors can be discussed in future work.\n",
