MERS-CoV situation update 21 November 2018, 17:00 h; Rome, http://www.fao.org/ag/againfo/programmes/en/empres/mers/situation_update.html). The spread of MERS-CoV to countries outside the Arabian Peninsula has been through travellers incubating the disease with minimal/or no symptoms while travelling. To date, no documented transmission of MERS-CoV has been proved to be associated with the transportation systems or hubs.1 The most recent travel incident was through a South Korean business traveller to the State of Kuwait who went back to South Korea (SK), and on arrival, he developed respiratory symptoms and was promptly isolated and the diagnosis of MERS-CoV was confirmed. This was be the second incident of an MERS-CoV-positive returning traveller that SK had to deal with, but fortunately there was no transmission to other passengers on the same flight or in SK.2\u20134",

This was achieved by increasing healthcare workers\u2019 (HCW) knowledge about the disease, improving infection prevention and control practices in HCFs, the application of a wide-net disease case definition and strict screening and triage in emergency room (ER) of all HCFs in KSA. This undoubtedly comes at a very high cost through excessive testing for MERS-CoV, increased workload for HCW, prolongation of patient waiting time in emergency rooms and an unmeasured compromise in handling urgent cardiac and renal failure patients who often are mislabelled as suspected MERS-CoV patients on ER presentation. The financial toll of MERS-CoV and its preventative strategies is yet to be estimated, and the impact of MERS-CoV on the performance of other national communicable disease preventive programs is unknown.",

            "text": "One of the strategies to assess the robustness of MERS-CoV case definition is to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of diagnostic testing at a national level. Healthcare in KSA is divided between the Ministry of Health (MoH) and other government sectors, at a ratio of 70:30%. Over the last 3 years, the KSA MoH has purchased between 125 000 and 140 000 MERS-CoV PCR kits annually. The estimated cost of doing one PCR test in the lab (inclusive of genetic extraction, PCR test, controls and consumables) is around 60 USD (personal communication KSA MoH). On a national level, between 10 and 11 million USD are spent annually on MERS-CoV testing alone. The yield of this testing is extremely low, based on a recent report from the Saudi MoH, which indicated that over a 10-month period (1 April 2015\u20131 February 2016) only 384/57 363 (0.7%) of MERS-CoV PCR tests were positive.6 This highlights an urgent need to re-evaluate the current case definition for MERS-CoV, even though its fifth version was just released on May 2018 (MIDDLE EAST RESPIRATORY SYNDROME CORONAVIRUS; GUIDELINES FOR HEALTHCARE PROFESSIONALS 5th ed. May 2018. Available at: https://www.moh.gov.sa/CCC/healthp/regulations/Documents/MERS-CoV%20Guidelines%20for%20Healthcare%20Professionals%20-%20May%202018%20-%20v5.1%20%281%29.pdf). The wider case definition is usually recommended earlier in the course of any emerging epidemic to capture all suspected cases and limit disease spread nationally, regionally and globally. But as more knowledge about the disease accumulates over time, refinement of the case definition is needed to make it more precise and to refocus resources available to new areas in need of research and development.",

Multiple POCTs have been developed and others are under development, all waiting to be validated nationally in KSA.8,9 The KSA MoH attempted to address the early detection of suspected MERS-CoV cases among patients presenting with respiratory symptoms through a visual triage system which was developed and continues to be adopted at the national level since its development in 2016. It is a scoring system applied on every patient presenting with respiratory symptoms to any ER or haemodialysis unit nationally. The score takes into account certain demographic, clinical signs and symptoms and risky exposures. A score of 4 was selected randomly to represent a high risk of MERS-CoV requiring directing the patient to a respiratory pathway, prompt medical assessment and isolation and testing. A recent small-scale evaluation of this system indicated the lack of sensitivity and specificity in detecting MERS-CoV-positive patients even if the score was increased to 8.10 Large-scale, national evaluation of this system is needed to make a decision regarding its use.",

But the definition should ensure that the above 2-patient categories are triaged through POCT mechanisms in hospitals and dialysis centres across the whole healthcare systems in KSA. For the two other categories of the case definition which are linked to risky exposure and includes fever and gastrointestinal symptoms, a critical review of the national database of MERS-CoV reported cases should be undertaken to test its sensitivity and specificity.
