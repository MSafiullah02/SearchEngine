Hutchison et al. (2004) reported high numbers of zoonotic pathogens (E. coli O157, Salmonella, Listeria monocytogenes, Campylobacter, Cryptosporidium parvum, Giardia intestinalis) in both fresh and stored animal waste (cattle, pig, poultry and sheep). The application of raw manure and slurry is standard practice on farms to utilise animal waste while also replenishing nutrients to the soil (Szogi et al., 2015). AD is a process which can also use FYM&S as a feedstock and, by the action of microorganisms, break down biodegradable organic compounds into simpler molecules in the absence of oxygen to produce methane (Abbasi et al., 2012; Manyi-Loh et al., 2013, Manyi-Loh et al., 2016). The methane can also be cleaned and use as a fossil fuel replacement for transport and domestic use (Purdy et al., 2018). Another advantage of AD is that the process itself can inactivate pathogens; however, complete inactivation is not always achieved; for example, Smith et al. (2005) reported a 2 log reduction in E. coli could be achieved by mesophilic AD (M-AD). However, E. coli can be present as high as 6 log CFU g\u22121 (Hutchison et al., 2004) in fresh cattle manure and therefore, there is the potential for E. coli to survive the M-AD process.",

M-AD is the most common system in Ireland (Smyth et al., 2009). It has a more stable operation but a lower biogas production rate compared to other types of AD. In contrast, the higher temperature process (T-AD) reduces pathogen numbers even further and provides more rapid reaction rates than M-AD (Mahmud et al., 2016). Process parameters such as temperature, pH, hydraulic retention time, organic loading rate, carbon\u2011nitrogen ratio and free ammonia presence can also have a significant influence on pathogen inactivation (Sakar et al., 2009; Abbasi et al., 2012; Manyi-Loh et al., 2013).",

In the future, more consideration should be given to AD of biodegradable waste, where material recycling is combined with energy recovery (European Commission, 2017). Given the drive for renewable energy sources, the use of AD to process waste streams is likely to increase. There is a concern that several pathogens of significance may survive the process. Therefore, this study examined whether AD process residues (i.e. digestate) could re-enter the circular economy (Longhurst et al., 2019) by exploring issues of potential human, animal and environmental risk; and emphasises the considerable weight of evidence required to inform stakeholders of the safety of digestate.",

It is understood that Salmonella, influenza virus, measles virus, Cryptosporidium and E. coli are the top five pathogens which have been responsible for several human health outbreaks in Europe; however, influenza virus and measles virus can only be transmitted from person to person (Waring et al., 2005; Li et al., 2009; Borges et al., 2016). In terms of the application of AD digestate to the agricultural land person to person is a non-critical pathway. Airborne, foodborne, waterborne and animal contact (zoonotic) diseases are of greatest human health concern (Health Service Executive, 2019). Foodborne illness (gastroenteritis) is a particular global health concern (WHO, 2008; Thomas et al., 2013; Torgerson et al., 2015). Nag et al. (2019) mentioned that the application of raw FYM&S and anaerobic digestate could possibly play a role in pathogen transportation from agricultural land to humans through the food chain (mainly ready to eat RTE crops). According to TIME Health (2017), 351,000 people die of food-poisoning globally every year. Foodborne disease means, according to WHO (2008), any disease of an infectious or toxic nature caused by consumption of food and a foodborne disease outbreak can be defined in the following ways,a)The observed number of cases of disease exceeds the expected numberb)The occurrence of two or more cases of a similar foodborne disease resulting from the ingestion of a common food.\n",

Whereas, sheep mortality is predominantly caused by parasitic diseases, respiratory infections, septicaemia, clostridial and enteric disease. Pneumonia, enteric infection, septicaemia and nervous system diseases are the predominant causes of pig mortality. Septicaemia, digestive, musculoskeletal, respiratory and parasitic diseases are common in the poultry industry.

Thermal inactivation data for each of the pathogens were collected from the available literature with a specific focus on the time-temperature relationship with Z value (reference temperature at which the time-temperature inactivation tests were done) and Dref (duration of heating at Tref for complete inactivation of the pathogen). Songer (2010) indicated that microbial inactivation of spore-forming organisms is difficult as spores are much more heat resistant compared to the parent cells and spores can survive in the soil for many years (Sahlstr\u00f6m, 2003).

Most of the references mentioned in Table S3 indicated a linear relationship between pathogen survival or inactivation and temperature at a shorter temperature range (35 \u00b0C to 90 \u00b0C). Hence, an appropriate temperature was adopted for the normalization process. For another example, Salmonella enterica spp. can be inactivated by heating at 60 \u00b0C for 60 mins or 121 \u00b0C for 15 min (Table S2); hence, the lower temperature-time (60 \u00b0C for 60 mins) was adopted for calculation.

In the absence of a mortality rate, the score was proposed based on the number of annual human deaths globally (Fig. 3) where 0 to 100 deaths were assigned a low score and >10,000 deaths corresponded to a high score. Infection or illness cases per 100,000 population was another alternative approach as mortality rate and global deaths due to all 91 pathogens was not available. A low score was given where infection or illness was <1 per 100,000 population; the value between 1 and 99 was assigned a moderate score; and, a high score was given to 100 or more incidents per 100,000 population (Fig. 3). If any of these three criteria were not fulfilled, a low score (0.3) was given for the consistency of the model (Fig. 3). This step was introduced to consider the \u2018severity\u2019 of the hazard within likelihood-severity (L \u00d7 S) matrix. The final score S of the screening process was based on the multiplication of three individual scores S1, S2 and S3 (Eq. (3)).

The bars extending to the right-hand side indicate a positive correlation between these model inputs and the final risk score. Consequently, the score due to the mortality rate (S3) was identified as the most sensitive parameter of the model followed by thermal inactivation (S1) and score for potential contamination pathways (S2). Again, in some pathogens, the final score (S) which was presented in the form of bars, could be visible only in mesophilic conditions (Fig. 4).

Enterococcus faecalis is an opportunistic pathogen which generally affects elderly patients with underlying disease and other immunocompromised patients who have been hospitalized for long periods (Public Health Agency of Canada, 2019). According to Oprea and Zervos (2007), Enterococci are not classic foodborne pathogens. There are some animal pathogens other than those which are mentioned in Table S1 (AFBI and DAFM, 2016). A list of pathogens (other than Table S1) causing disease in animals and not in humans are presented in Table 8\n. The model can also be used to assess the pathogens of an animal health concern as a comparison between these pathogen and indicators used in the model can be readily carried out. In the absence of detailed thermal inactivation data (Tref, Dvalue and Zvalue), only a comparison was made to find out the indicators (final column of Table 8) and it is noted all indicators were already captured in this model (Table 7). Feline calicivirus (FCV), which is a non-enveloped virus, is a more heat resistant enteric virus (used as a surrogate for noroviruses) and generally causes illness in cats (Wong et al., 2010; Cook, 2013; Cromeans et al., 2014). However, it was not considered directly in the list of 91 pathogens as it is not likely to add a cat-carcass in an AD plant in Ireland. Finally, the choice of an indicator is very important and this can be limited to case-specific scenarios; for example, Cryptosporidium is a good indicator of parasites (matured cells); however, Ascaris eggs were found to be more resilient (Kato et al., 2004) compared with Cryptosporidium oocysts at all sampling points.",

It is not recommended to mix urban wastewater with FYM&S in an AD plant, hence limiting the likely presence of these parasites. Finally, this study looked to identify the top-ranked pathogens comparing common pathogens found in different scenarios such as BM, Scenario A FOODIRE (or Scenario B FOODEU) and Scenario C RAWFYM&S (Table 10\n). Table 10 provides a prioritisation of the highest-ranking pathogens likely to be of concern and requiring vigilance. The pathogens which appeared more than once in the scenarios (Table 10) are Cryptosporidium parvum, Salmonella enterica spp., norovirus, Streptococcus pyogenes, Entamoeba histolytica, E. coli enteropathogenic (EPEC), Mycobacterium spp., Salmonella typhi followed by S. paratyphi, Clostridium spp., Listeria monocytogenes and Campylobacter coli (11 in total). In Ireland, the co-digestion of urban wastewater and FYM&S is unlikely (Singh et al., 2010). Hence, Entamoeba histolytica may be excluded at this final stage of the hazard identification for Ireland.",

Cryptosporidium parvum, Salmonella spp., norovirus, Streptococcus pyogenes, E. coli enteropathogenic (EPEC), Mycobacterium spp., Salmonella typhi (followed by S. paratyphi), Clostridium spp., Listeria monocytogenes and Campylobacter coli were found to be the most relevant (top 10) pathogens in relation to potential risk from spreading anaerobic digestate on agricultural land, specifically in Ireland. The score corresponding to the mortality rate (S3) was the most sensitive parameter (rank coefficient 0.49) to the final score S; followed by thermal inactivation score S1 (0.25) and potential contamination pathways S2 (0.16). A complete risk assessment of top-ranked pathogens can unify the data collected from the laboratory and field experiments into comprehensible statistics and predict potential risk which could help relevant agencies and government authorities to take the necessary steps to identify the most sensitive pathways or processes responsible for the overall risk and thus, act to minimise potential risk.",
