            "text": "In January 2020 reports of unidentified severe respiratory illness were described in Wuhan, China. A rapid expansion in cases affecting most countries around the globe led to major changes in the way people live their daily lives. In the United Kingdom, the Department of Health and Social Care directed healthcare providers to establish additional resources to manage the anticipated surge in cases that could overwhelm the health services. A priority area was testing for SARS-CoV-2 RNA and its detection by qualitative RT-PCR. Design: A laboratory workflow twinning research environment with clinical laboratory capabilities was implemented and validated in the University of Birmingham within 4 days of the project initiation. The diagnostic capability was centred on an IVD CE-marked RT-PCR kit and designed to provide surge capacity to the nearby Queen Elizabeth Hospital. The service was initially tasked with testing healthcare workers (HCW) using throat swabs, and subsequently the process investigated the utility of using saliva as an alternative sample type. Results: Between the 8 th April 2020 and the 30 th April 2020, the laboratory tested a total of 1282 HCW for SARS-CoV-2 RNA in throat swabs. RNA was detected in 54% of those who reported symptoms compatible with COVID-19, but in only 4% who were asymptomatic. Conclusion: This capability was established rapidly and utilised a cold-chain free methodology, applicable to a wide range of settings, and which can provide surge capacity and support to clinical laboratories facing increasing pressure during periods of national crisis.

This new strain was first described in January 2020 as a cause of a novel severe respiratory illness now known as COVID-19. As of the 3 rd May 3,356,205 confirmed cases were reported globally with 238,730 deaths, affecting 215 countries around the world [2] . The rapid development of the pandemic highlights the need to speedily assemble the capability to support healthcare services in a variety of international settings. Responsive capacity building was part of the United Kingdom's strategy to rapidly scale up testing for SARS-CoV-2 RNA in respiratory samples using qRT-PCR. A directive from the Department of Health and Social Care, and National Health Service Improvement (NHSI) instructed NHS hospitals to identify the means to increase testing capacity [3] . Accordingly, the University of Birmingham (UoB) was included in an extended laboratory network to provide additional capacity to the existing diagnostic laboratories in the West Midlands region, particularly to support healthcare worker testing. Rapid technology and knowledge transfer combined with a partnership between a UKAS-accredited clinical service and academic research infrastructure reconfigured the laboratories into a molecular diagnostic service capable of providing quality assured testing using a verified commercial test. External support was provided by Public Health England clinical virologists in an advisory role.",

The VIASURE test is a multiplex of three targets: the viral N and ORF1ab genes (China-CDC) [4] , and a synthetic internal control to detect assay inhibition. Lyophilized reaction reagents were reconstituted, 15\u00b5l of master mix used per reaction with the addition of 5\u00b5l sample RNA. Thermocycling was performed on either ABI 7500 or QuantStudio 5 instruments. All preliminary data analysis from qRT-PCR analyses was performed using the Thermo Cloud software (Thermo Scientific), with automated threshold and baseline setting followed by careful manual inspection of individual amplification curves by two senior experienced operators. Final interpretation of the RT-PCR assay results was as specified in the manufacturer instructions for use (IFU). Confirmatory testing on indeterminate results was performed with E gene assay [4] . These results were transmitted electronically to the UKAS-accredited service, for reporting to the NHS Trust and Public Health England surveillance systems.",
