NeuAc-coupled TNF (NeuAc-TNF ) exhibited reduced activities in vitro by about threefold compared to native TNF . In this study, we examined a variety of TNF activities in vivo. NeuAc-TNF reduced activities in the up-regulation of serum levels of IL-6 and NOx, but comparable activity as native TNF in the down-regulation of the serum level of glucose. However, NeuAc-TNF was more potent than TNF in the up-regulation of the serum level of serum amyloid A (SAA). NeuAc-TNF was less toxic to mice. In addition, NeuAc-TNF exhibited an augmented anti-tumor activity against Meth-A Wbrosarcoma without hemorrhagic necrosis. These results indicate that coupling with NeuAc enabled us to develop neoglycoTNF with selective activities in vivo, including enhanced antitumor activity but reduced toxicity.",

In glycoproteins, sialic acid is usually conjugated with galactose and plays an important role in preventing the clearance of glycoproteins from the serum because asialoglycoproteins are rapidly cleared through galactose binding lectins present in the liver [7] . Furthermore, sialic acid is also important as a ligand for selectins [8] and Siglecs [9] and is involved in cellular signaling events and the modulation of immune reactions. Therefore, it is expected that the coupling of sialic acid enables its conjugate to bind to a variety of cell types and prolong its serum level as well.",

This is in contrast to its in vitro activities, in all the assays performed in vitro, including antiproliferative or cytotoxic activity to tumor cells, a proliferative eVect on Wbroblast cells, a stimulatory eVect on IL-6 production by melanoma cells and NF-B activation in hepatocytes, NeuAc-TNF exhibited similarly reduced activities by about 1/ 3, as compared to native TNF . It is interesting as to why the eVects of NeuAc coupling to TNF activities in vivo diVered according to the activities. The activities of TNF in vitro could be mainly determined by its aYnity for the receptor. In contrast, the in vivo system is more complex, and the potency of TNF activity cannot be determined solely by the aYnity to its receptor. In our previous studies, NeuAc-IL-1 similarly exhibited reduced activities in all the assays performed in vitro, including its receptor binding aYnity, as compared to native IL-1 , but in vivo, it exhibited selective activities, such as reduction in the activity to induce serum IL-6, moderate reduction in the activities to induce serum SAA and NOx, comparable activity to reduce the serum glucose level and augmented activity to improve the recovery of peripheral white blood cells from myelosuppression in 5-FU treated mice [18, 19] .

In particular, NO produced by smooth muscle cells is implicated in the hypotension caused by TNF , which is a serious deleterious eVect in the application of TNF to patients [11] . NeuAc-TNF was weak in the induction of serum NOx level. Therefore, it is beneWcial for the therapeutic use of NeuAc-TNF .

NeuAc-TNF inhibited the tumor growth more rapidly and eYciently than native TNF . The rate of complete disappearance of the tumor was also higher in NeuAc-TNF as compared to native TNF . As has been known, TNF caused hemorrhagic necrosis. Quite interestingly, however, NeuAc-TNF caused necrosis without hemorrhage. The tumor lesion was pale; subsequently, the tumor regressed and disappeared. It is of note that when the necrotic tumor lesion was touched by hand, the TNF -injected mice, but not the NeuAc-TNF injected mice, became rowdy. Probably the TNF -injected, but not the NeuAc-TNF injected mice, felt pain. TNF exerts its anti-tumor eVect through its direct cytotoxic eVect, necrosis or apoptosis, on tumor cells and also indirectly through host cells. TNF induces inXammatory exudates by inducing chemokines and cytokines, and augments the tumor cell killing activity of monocytes, macrophages, neutrophils and NK cells [10, 11] . It is also reported that TNF selectively stems blood Xow in newly formed microcapillaries in the tumor lesion by inducing thrombus formation, leading to the autolysis of tumors [29] . Although the mechanism by which NeuAc-TNF caused necrosis without hemorrhage remained to be elucidated, our study indicated that conjugation of NeuAc to TNF rendered the conjugate more potent in anti-tumor eVect and less toxic. The study also suggests that the site-directed conjugation of NeuAc will enable us to develop a more ideal TNF in future.",
