Whereas no enhancement in mRNA or protein levels of TGF\u03b2 has been reported after infection or vaccination with European or type I PRRSV genotypes (D\u00edaz et al., 2006, Silva-Campa et al., 2010), an increased mRNA and protein expression of TGF\u03b2 has been observed in infections with North American or type II genotypes (Silva-Campa et al., 2009, Renukaradhya et al., 2010).",

Viral expression in the lung and lymphoid organs of PRRSV-infected pigs was observed from 3 dpi until the end of the study, however, a different trend was observed in each examined organ. Whereas the expression of PRRSV reached a maximum at 7 dpi in the lung and mediastinal lymph node parenchyma decreasing onwards, a two-peak curve was observed in the tonsil, with a first peak at 3 dpi followed by a second peak at 14 dpi (Fig. 2).",

However, no serum expression of TGF\u03b2 was detected throughout the study neither in control nor in infected animals, contrary to the results obtained from the immunohistochemical study. Recently, an enhancement in the expression of TGF\u03b2 has been reported for type II PRRSV genotypes (Silva-Campa et al., 2009, Renukaradhya et al., 2010) but not for type I genotypes (D\u00edaz et al., 2005, D\u00edaz et al., 2006, Silva-Campa et al., 2010). This finding may be related to the higher virulence attributed to type II genotypes of PRRSV (Mart\u00ednez-Lobo et al., 2011), which usually trigger off a more accentuated cytokines cascade. In our study, the lack of serum expression of TGF\u03b2 together with the local expression of this cytokine at lymphoid organs and lung level, confirm this hypothesis, and point to a role for the local expression of cytokines in the modulation of the immune response in infections with European PRRSV isolates.",

Interestingly, similar findings were observed concerning the expression of PRRSV and IL-10 in the examined organs in parallel studies carried out by our research group (G\u00f3mez-Laguna et al., 2010b, Barranco et al., 2011a), which suggests a synergic action between the local expression of TGF\u03b2 and IL-10. The correlation observed between PRRSV and TGF\u03b2 antigens in the lung in the present study points to a direct induction of the production of TGF\u03b2 by PRRSV replication, whereas the different trend showed by these parameters in lymphoid organs suggests that either TGF\u03b2 may play a minor role in the modulation of the immune response in the mediastinal lymph node and in the tonsil of PRRSV-infected pigs or that an indirect mechanism might be involved in the expression of this cytokine in these organs during PRRSV infection.",

Interestingly, \u201cfully resistant\u201d animals showed milder respiratory lesions which may be related to a role of this cytokine in controlling the onset of pulmonary lesions after respiratory infections.

Conversely, in the present study the expression of TGF\u03b2 was mainly observed in PAMs and secondly in other cells, such as septal macrophages, neutrophils and/or lymphocytes. Thus, taking into account the immunomodulatory role of TGF\u03b2 (Letterio and Roberts, 1998), the expression of this cytokine by PAMs may be involved in the lack of expression of IFN\u03b3 by these cells, and the subsequent lack of activation and impairment of PAMs, which favour secondary bacterial infections. In addition, comparing our results with parallel studies from our group (Barranco et al., 2011a) the enhancement on the expression of TGF\u03b2 observed in the present study coincided with a lower expression of proinflammatory cytokines in the lung and lymphoid organs of pigs inoculated with PRRSV field isolate 2982 (G\u00f3mez-Laguna et al., 2010a, Barranco et al., 2011a).

Nonetheless, few studies have been yet performed to determine the role of Tregs in PRRS. Thus, a TGF\u03b2-dependent induction of Th3 cells by PRRSV-infected dendritic cells has been reported (Silva-Campa et al., 2009). In the present study we observed an enhancement in the expression of TGF\u03b2 in the lung and lymphoid organs of PRRSV-infected animals from 3 dpi onwards, which may be involved in the induction of Tregs observed by other authors. Further studies are being conducted to confirm the role of TGF\u03b2 in the induction of Tregs during PRRS.",

The expression of this cytokine may either favour or difficult the onset of an efficient host immune response. On the one hand, TGF\u03b2 may be able both to avoid overproduction of proinflammatory cytokines at tissue level and to difficult PRRSV replication by downregulating the expression of CD163. On the other hand, TGF\u03b2 may impair the host immune response by (1) inhibiting an efficient expression of antiviral cytokines, and/or (2) inducing the differentiation of Tregs.",
