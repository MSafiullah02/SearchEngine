It covers an area of about 5cm on either side of the nose, specifically in the region of the superior nasal conchae, the septum and the ethmoid bone (Fig. 1\n). This region harbors about 100 million bipolar olfactory cells in humans (220 million in dogs). The sensory epithelium also contains stem cells with the lifelong capacity for replacing olfactory cells that have died. The peripheral processes of the bipolar sensory cells rise to the mucosal surface (Fig. 2\n). They bear up to 1,000 hairs (cilia) on which the primary contact takes place between aromatic molecules and receptors. The hairs differ in length among the various organisms. The longer the hairs, the more points of contact for the aromatic molecules. Organisms with long sensory hairs are therefore described as macrosmatic, those with short ones as microsmatic. The hairs must be moistened constantly so as not to be destroyed by desiccation. The olfactory zone thus has special mucous glands which, in contrast to other glands in the nose, do not form proteolytic enzymes. Odorants would otherwise be broken down into substances with a different smell prior to contact with the sensory cells.",

These proteins activate signal proteins (G proteins) which in turn trigger a cascade that sends an electric signal (action potential) along the central process of the cell to the bulb of the olfactory nerve (Reed 1992). This bulb contains cell accumulations (granules), each granule corresponding to a specific receptor molecule (Reed 1992). The expression of the specific olfactory receptor proteins is genetically determined (Buck and Axel 1991), one gene encoding each receptor molecule. Altogether, we possess about 1,000 different olfactory receptors. Approximately 1 percent of our genes are used here, which corresponds to the largest family of genes found in humans. This underscores the profound importance of the sense of smell in man (Axel 1995).",

The mucosal cells develop cilia and lose contact to nerves. Thus, there are discussions as to whether the organ loses its function in humans at a very early stage, that is, in infancy. However, some findings (Monti-Bloch et al. 1998, Grosser et al. 2000) have demonstrated that the vomeronasal organ can be stimulated directly and specifically by a pheromone in adults (see below).",

Since this leaves open the possibility of simulation and aggravation, expert opinions always require clarification by taste tests with substances that can only be smelled (e.g., peppermint solution) or by objective examination procedures. In the objective smell test, an odorant is introduced into the nose by pulsed application, and the brain waves are measured via the vertex synchronous to inhalation.

Some of the results are physiologically significant. The test clearly demonstrated, for example, that men have a poorer sense of smell than women (something women have always said). This difference is enhanced in old age. The olfactory sense is best at the age of 20 and declines continuously with age (about 40\u201350 percent by the age of 80).

Thus, Shoyi et al. found that the vomeronasal system has very high sensitivity to various stimulating substances, though the sensory cells in the nasal pouch do not possess distinct cilia like the olfactory cells of the classic olfactory system. In contrast, Smith and Bhatnagor (2000) already detected a transformation into ciliated cells in infancy. On the one hand, a physiological receptor function has been negated in man (Trotier et al. 2000). On the other hand, women randomized in a double-blind manner reacted specifically to the male pheromone androstadienone when applied to their vomeronasal organ in picogram quantities. Direct application of the female pheromone pregna-4,20-diene-3,6-dione (vomeropherin PDD) to the vomeronasal organ of men elicited a significant and dose-dependent parasympathomimetic reaction and also decreased serum LH and testosterone (Monti-Bloch et al. 1998). The threshold for pheromone detection is extremely low in animals. Hence, a male silk moth will find a female even at a distance of 10km, though not if it is sitting under a glass bell. As mentioned above, the stimulating substances of the vomeronasal system are pheromones, androstenone, and androstenol being among those found in humans. They are formed in the nasolabial groove, the axilla, the mammillae and the sexual organs. We do not perceive consciously their stimulation of the vomeronasal organ. If we think we are smelling pheromones, these are bacterial breakdown products of the respective substances, for which we also develop marked hedonics. Famous in this connection is a letter Napoleon wrote to his wife, Josephine, requesting that she no longer wash herself because he was coming home from the field.",

Smelling pheromones is particularly important for newborn creatures, especially while still helpless, for example, blind animals. They smell their mother's mammary glands via pheromones. Kangaroo babies are very small creatures at birth. Guided by pheromones, they find their way unaided to the mother's pouch, where the mammary glands are situated.",

Thus, hedonics for the pheromones of a partner are known to be all the more positive, the greater the difference between the immunocompetence of a couple, as measured by the major histocompatibility complex. This is nature's attempt to prevent marriages between brothers and sisters. Hedonics has been found to undergo a reversal in the course of pregnancy, during which time a previously preferred partner is not very attractive. This effect is biologically understandable. The reversal only lasts as long as the pregnancy. However, women taking oral contraceptives also show a reversal of hedonics, and this circumstance harbors an implicit threat to their partnership.",
