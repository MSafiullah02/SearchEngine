The cells that present peptides derived from non-self, e.g., from viruses or bacteria (after binding to MHC molecule), can trigger a T-cell immune response, which leads to the destruction of such cells [2]. T cells do not recognize soluble native antigen but rather recognize antigens that has been processed into antigenic peptides, which are presented in combination with MHC molecules. It has been observed that peptides of nine amino acid residues (9-mers) bind most strongly; peptides of 8\u201311 residues also bind but generally with lower affinity than nonamers [3, 4]. Binding of a peptide to a MHC molecule is prerequisite for recognition by T cells and, hence is fundamental to understanding the basis of immunity and also for the development of potential vaccines and design of immunotherapy [5].",

The second approach, i.e., based on structures corresponds to techniques with distinct theoretical lineage and includes the use of homology modeling, docking and 3D-threading techniques.",

Threading methods [15] and Gibbs motif sampler [16] approach have also been used for prediction of MHC-binding peptides. In many cases, the number of known binders and non-binders to specific MHC alleles are limited; therefore, the convergence to optimal weights of ANN has to be improved.

            "text": "The values of learning rate are taken between 0.0 and 1.0. Back propagation network learns using a method of gradient descent to search for a set of weights that can model the given classification problem, so as to minimize the mean squared distance between the network\u2019s class prediction and the actual class label of the samples. The learning rate helps to avoid getting stuck at local minimum in the decision space (i.e., where the weights appear to converge, but are not the optimum solution) and encourages finding the global minimum. If the learning rate is too small, then learning will occur at a very slow pace. If the learning rate is too large, then oscillation between inadequate solutions may occur [17, 18]. In gradient descent, learning rate determines the magnitude of the change to be made in the parameters, i.e., weights and a bias of nodes as per (1) and (2); furthermore, the updated weights and biases are given by (3) and (4). The value of error (Errj) at output node and at internal node is given by (5) and (6), respectively. The input and output to each j-th unit are given by (7) and (8), respectively. For a given training set of input vectors, the learning rate L is kept fixed which leads to poor convergence in case of a small dataset. To improve the convergence, variable learning rate (i.e., the learning rate is updated after each input vector in a given training set of input vectors) has been used as per (9). The error is calculated using (5) after each training vector, and the learning rate is increased by a value a, if the error on the subsequent training vector decreases. It is decreased geometrically by value b\u03b7, if the error on subsequent training vector increases. The value of \u0394L has to be calculated after each input vector in the given training set as per (9), and used to update the learning rate, L. The updated learning rate, L + \u0394L, has been used for further training to calculate the values of the weights and biases of the nodes as per (1)\u2013(4). 1\\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsmath}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{wasysym} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsfonts} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amssymb} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsbsy}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{mathrsfs}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{upgreek}\n\t\t\t\t\\setlength{\\oddsidemargin}{-69pt}\n\t\t\t\t\\begin{document}\n$$\\begin{array}{rcl} \\Delta {w}_{\\mathit{ij}}& = (L){\\mathrm{Err}}_{j}{O}_{i}&\\end{array}$$\n\\end{document}\n2\\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsmath}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{wasysym} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsfonts} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amssymb} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsbsy}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{mathrsfs}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{upgreek}\n\t\t\t\t\\setlength{\\oddsidemargin}{-69pt}\n\t\t\t\t\\begin{document}\n$$\\begin{array}{rcl} \\Delta {\\theta }_{j}& = (L){\\mathrm{Err}}_{j}&\\end{array}$$\n\\end{document}\n3\\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsmath}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{wasysym} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsfonts} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amssymb} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsbsy}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{mathrsfs}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{upgreek}\n\t\t\t\t\\setlength{\\oddsidemargin}{-69pt}\n\t\t\t\t\\begin{document}\n$$\\begin{array}{rcl}{ w}_{\\mathit{ij}}& = {w}_{\\mathit{ij}} + \\Delta {w}_{\\mathit{ij}}&\\end{array}$$\n\\end{document}\n4\\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsmath}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{wasysym} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsfonts} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amssymb} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsbsy}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{mathrsfs}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{upgreek}\n\t\t\t\t\\setlength{\\oddsidemargin}{-69pt}\n\t\t\t\t\\begin{document}\n$$\\begin{array}{rcl}{ \\theta }_{j}& = {\\theta }_{j} + \\Delta {\\theta }_{j}&\\end{array}$$\n\\end{document}\n5\\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsmath}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{wasysym} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsfonts} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amssymb} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsbsy}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{mathrsfs}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{upgreek}\n\t\t\t\t\\setlength{\\oddsidemargin}{-69pt}\n\t\t\t\t\\begin{document}\n$$\\begin{array}{rcl}{ \\mathrm{Err}}_{j}& = {O}_{j}(1 - {O}_{j})({T}_{j} - {O}_{j})&\\end{array}$$\n\\end{document}\n6\\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsmath}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{wasysym} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsfonts} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amssymb} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsbsy}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{mathrsfs}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{upgreek}\n\t\t\t\t\\setlength{\\oddsidemargin}{-69pt}\n\t\t\t\t\\begin{document}\n$$\\begin{array}{rcl}{ \\mathrm{Err}}_{j}& = {O}_{j}(1 - {O}_{j}){\\sum }_{k}{\\mathrm{Err}}_{k}{w}_{\\mathit{jk}}&\\end{array}$$\n\\end{document}\n7\\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsmath}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{wasysym} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsfonts} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amssymb} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsbsy}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{mathrsfs}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{upgreek}\n\t\t\t\t\\setlength{\\oddsidemargin}{-69pt}\n\t\t\t\t\\begin{document}\n$$\\begin{array}{rcl}{ I}_{j}& ={ \\sum }_{i}{w}_{\\mathit{ij}}{O}_{i} + {O}_{j}&\\end{array}$$\n\\end{document}\n8\\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsmath}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{wasysym} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsfonts} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amssymb} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsbsy}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{mathrsfs}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{upgreek}\n\t\t\t\t\\setlength{\\oddsidemargin}{-69pt}\n\t\t\t\t\\begin{document}\n$$\\begin{array}{rcl}{ O}_{j}& = \\frac{1} {1+{e}^{-{I}_{j}}}&\\end{array}$$\n\\end{document}\n9\\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsmath}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{wasysym} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsfonts} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amssymb} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsbsy}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{mathrsfs}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{upgreek}\n\t\t\t\t\\setlength{\\oddsidemargin}{-69pt}\n\t\t\t\t\\begin{document}\n$$\\begin{array}{rcl} \\Delta L& = \\left \\{\\begin{array}{l} + a\\quad \\mathrm{if}\\ {E}^{t+\\Gamma }\\langle {E}^{t} \\\\ - b\\eta \\quad \\mathrm{otherwise}\\\\ \\end{array} \\right \\}&\\end{array}$$\n\\end{document} where \u0394w\nij is the change in the weight w\nij,  \u0394\u03b8j is the change in the bias t\nj,  W\nij is the weight of the connection from unit i to a unit j in the next higher layer, Errj is the error for unit j at the output layer, Errj is the error for unit j at hidden layer, I\nj is the net input to unit j,  O\nj is the output of the unit j,  T\nj is the true output, \u0394L is the change in the learning rate, L is the current learning rate, a and b are coefficients E\nt is the error at the node in output layer in the previous learning input vector, E\nt + \u0393 is the error at the node in output layer for current learning input vector.",
