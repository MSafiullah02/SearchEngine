            "text": "The susceptible-infected-susceptible (SIS) process [1] is a basic epidemic model which models the spread of viruses, information, opinions, and computer malware on networks. In the SIS model, each node in the network can be either infected or susceptible (healthy). The infection state of node j for j=1,...,N at time t is denoted by a Bernoulli random variable Xj(t): infected Xj(t)=1 or susceptible (healthy) Xj(t)=0. The SIS model has simple local rules that nodes can be infected by their infected neighbors and be cured by themselves. The infection and curing processes are independent and both Poisson processes with infection rate \u03b2 and curing rate \u03b4, respectively. By tuning the effective infection rate \u03c4\u225c\u03b2/\u03b4, the phase transition of infection persistence emerges at an epidemic threshold determined by the network [2,3]. If the effective infection rate \u03c4 is below the epidemic threshold, then the virus dies out quickly and every node becomes healthy. Above the threshold, the infection can persist in the network for a very long time [4].",

Locally, an individual node in the network can be infected and cured repeatedly so that the infection state Xj(t) at two different time points can be autocorrelated. The autocorrelation of the infection state of a node j between time s and t is\n(1)\u03c1j(s,t)\u225cE[Xj(s)Xj(t)]\u2212E[Xj(s)]E[Xj(t)]Var[Xj(s)]Var[Xj(t)].The numerator on the right-hand side in (1) is the covariance of the infection state Xj(s) and Xj(t), and the denominator normalizes the covariance. If time t=s, then the infection state Xj(s) is fully correlated with itself, and the autocorrelation is \u03c1j(s,s)=1. If Xj(s) and Xj(t) are independent, then the autocorrelation is \u03c1j(s,t)=0. The autocorrelation is symmetric: \u03c1j(s,t)=\u03c1j(t,s). Given the initial infection state of the network [X1(0),...,XN(0)], the infection states Xj(s) and Xj(t) are positively correlated [5], Corollary 1 such that E[Xj(s)Xj(t)]\u2265E[Xj(s)]E[Xj(t)] and the autocorrelation \u03c1j(s,t)\u22650.

            "text": "The autocorrelation contains information about the change of the infection state of each node. A large autocorrelation implies that the change of the infection state is slow, and the infection state is more likely to be identical between time s and t. While a smaller autocorrelation indicates that the infection state between time s and t is more independent. Globally, the fluctuating fraction of infected nodes I(t)\u225c1N\u2211j=1NXj(t) is also autocorrelated, and the autocorrelation and its spectral analysis of I(t) in real epidemics can be traced back to Anderson et al.\n[6]. By analyzing the autocorrelation and its spectrum of the incidence data of pertussis, mumps, and measles, Anderson et al.\n[6] indicate statistically significant seasonal and the longer-term resurgence of those diseases and find that vaccination increases the periods of the longer-term oscillations of the incidence data. However, in the basic networked SIS model, the autocorrelation of the infection state is infeasible to be calculated, because the SIS model is a 2N-state Markov process [3,7] and the computational complexity is exponentially high regarding of the network size N. Previously, Meier et al.\n[8], Supplementary Information E analyzed the correlation of the infection state of the SIS model for small time intervals, but the calculation involves higher-order moments. In this paper, we apply the N-intertwined mean-field approximation (NIMFA) [3] to study the autocorrelation of the infection state Xj(t) and the fraction of infected nodes I(t) both in the transient and steady states. Particularly in the steady state, we derive the explicit formula of the autocorrelation of the infection state, which is an exponentially decreasing function of time delay. The accuracy of the NIMFA autocorrelation is evaluated by simulating the exact SIS process. The result indicates that NIMFA, as an approximate stochastic process, well captures the autocorrelation properties of the exact SIS process. Moreover, the autocorrelation can also be used to estimate the infection and curing rates of the SIS process.",

For Bernoulli random variables, uncorrelation E[Xi(t)Xj(t)]=E[Xi(t)]E[Xj(t)] and independence Pr[Xi(t),Xj(t)]=Pr[Xi(t)]Pr[Xj(t)] are equivalent [12, footnote 5].

The NIMFA epidemic threshold is \u03c4c(1)\u225c1\u03bb1, where \u03bb1 is the largest eigenvalue of the adjacency matrix A.

A larger infection rate \u03b2 implies a faster state transition from healthy to infected, and the autocorrelation of the infection state is smaller consequently. A larger \u03b4 leads to a faster transition from infected to healthy, but, simultaneously, the infection probability of each neighbor becomes smaller. Therefore, the state transition of each node is slower from the healthy state to the infected state, and the effect of the curing rate \u03b4 is unclear. Only in special networks can the effect of the curing rate \u03b4 be determined. For example, the infection probabilities of all nodes are equal to 1\u22121k\u03c4 in a k-regular graph [3], and then the autocorrelation function becomes\n(9)Rj\u221e;k-regular(h)=e\u2212\u03b2kh.Formula (9) indicates that the autocorrelation of the infection state does not depend on the curing rate \u03b4 in regular graphs, which enables us to adjust the autocorrelation while keeping the effective infection rate \u03c4 unchanged. In regular graphs, the effect of the decrease (increase) of vj\u221e is exactly compensated by the increase (decrease) of \u03b4 in (8). The autocorrelation under other mean-field approximations can also be derived with the same procedure. For example, the heterogeneous mean-field approximation (HMF) assumes statistical equivalence among the nodes with the same degree [2], and the autocorrelation under HMF has the same form as the NIMFA autocorrelation (see Appendix B). In the case of regular graphs, HMF is equivalent [15] to NIMFA and then their approximate autocorrelations are identical.",

We can apply the Magnus expansion [16,17] to analyze the NIMFA transition matrix Pj(s,t) in Eq. (16). A brief introduction of the Magnus expansion can be found in Appendix C. Although the calculation of the exact NIMFA transition probability Pj(s,t) is not possible, approximations of Pj(s,t) allowing a fair comparison between NIMFA and the exact SIS process can be made with restricted error. First, there exists a 2\u00d72 matrix \u03a9(s,t;j) such that the solution of Eq. (16) is Pj(s,t)=exp[\u03a9(s,t;j)]. Second, if (see the derivation of (C5) for details in Appendix C)\n(17)0<t\u2212s<T\u225c\u03c0\u03b22dj2+\u03b42,then the exponent matrix \u03a9(s,t;j) can be expanded into a convergent Magnus series \u03a9(s,t;j)=\u2211k=1\u221e\u03a9k(s,t;j). Specifically, by only preserving the first term, i.e., \u03a91(s,t;j)=\u222bss+hQj(t)dt, in the convergent Magnus series of \u03a9(s,t;j), we can achieve a third-order accuracy (see Appendix C) for the time length h=t\u2212s, i.e.,\n(18)Pj(s,s+h)=exp\u222bss+hQj(t)dt+O(h3).Equation (18) holds because exp[X+O(hk)]=exp(X)+O(hk) holds for a matrix X as can be verified by evaluating their power series. Using the Taylor expansion of the infinitesimal generator Qj(t)=\u2211k=0\u221e1k!dkQk(u)duku=s(t\u2212s)k at time s, the solution (18) becomes\n(19)Pj(s,s+h)=expQj(s)h+dQj(t)dtt=sh22+O(h3).Only the first two terms of the Taylor expansion of the infinitesimal generator Qj(t) are preserved in (19) since the error is O(h3) in (18). The first term on the right-hand side of (19) can be calculated by matrix diagonalization described in Appendix A. The derivative of the infinitesimal generator dQj(t)/dt involves d\u03b2~j(t)dt from Eq. (6), which is\n(20)\u03b2~j\u2032(t)\u225cd\u03b2~j(t)dt=\u03b2\u2211i\u2208Njdvi(t)dt=\u03b2\u2211i\u2208Nj\u2212\u03b4vi(t)+\u03b2[1\u2212vi(t)]\u2211k\u2208Nivk(t),where Nj denotes the neighbors of node j. The calculation in Eq. (20) involves the infection probabilities of two-hop neighbors of node j. Specifically, the transition probability that node j remains infected after h time units is\nPr[Vj(s+h)=1|Vj(s)=1]=[Pj(s,s+h)]22=2\u03b4e\u2212(\u03b2~j(s)+\u03b4)h\u2212\u03b2~j\u2032(s)h2/2+2\u03b2~j(s)+\u03b2~j\u2032(s)h2\u03b2~j(s)+2\u03b4+\u03b2~j\u2032(s)h+O(h3).Different from that in the steady state [see Eq. (8)], the infection probabilities of neighbors of node j always appear in the calculation of the transition matrix Pj(s,t) in the transient state as indicated in (20). Higher-order accuracy is also possible by preserving more terms of the Magnus series, and higher-order derivative dk\u03b2~j(t)/dt, which can be calculated by the infection probabilities of all nodes within k+1 hops from node j, is involved. For example, if we preserve the second term in the Magnus expansion of \u03a9(s,s+h;j), which can be calculated by the Taylor expansion as\n\u03a92(s,s+h;j)=\u03b41\u221211\u22121\u222bss+h\u222bst1[\u03b2~j(t1)\u2212\u03b2~j(t2)]dt2dt1=\u03b41\u221211\u2212116d\u03b2~j(t)dtt=sh3+112d2\u03b2~j(t)dt2t=sh4+O(h5),then we can achieve an accuracy of O(h5) because (see Appendix C)\nPj(s,s+h)=exp\u2211i=12\u03a9i(s,s+h;j)+O(h5)and the calculation involves the infection probabilities of neighbors within three hops. For NIMFA, preserving more terms is not always reasonable, because the infection probability of each node can only be solved numerically. When more Magnus terms are preserved, the inaccuracy is mainly caused by the numerical method which solves the nonlinear NIMFA Eq. (4). For example, using the fourth-order Runge-Kutta method [17, p. 200], the error of the infection probabilities is of order O(h4).",

The NIMFA autocorrelation Rj\u221e(h) is a very accurate approximation on those graphs.

The autocorrelation of the hub node is much smaller than that of the leaf nodes since the infection probability of the hub node is larger.

For a large time delay, the inaccuracy is due to either the omission of term O(h3) in (19) or that the NIMFA transition probability matrix Pj(s,t) itself is a bad approximation, but we can eliminate the possibility of the latter using Eq. (21). As the black middle curve in Fig. 6 indicated, the NIMFA joint expectation E[Vj(0)Vj(h)] is indeed a good approximation using Eq. (21) with subinterval length 0.01.\n",

We consider the reverse problem of estimating the curing rate \u03b4 and the infection rate \u03b2, given the sequence Xj(t+\u0394),Xj(t+2\u0394),...,Xj(t+n\u0394) of the infection state of node j in the metastable state. From Eq. (8), the curing rate is\n(22)\u03b4=\u2212(1\u2212vj\u221e)ln[Rj\u221e(h)]h.Formula (22) can be used to estimate the curing rate \u03b4 of the SIS process. In formula (22), we can approximate the infection probability as vj\u221e\u22481n\u2211i=1nE[Xj(t+i\u0394)], while the autocorrelation Rj\u221e(h), which approximates the exact autocorrelation \u03c1j(s,t) in (1), is just the autocorrelation of the binary infection sequence Xj(t+k\u0394). Furthermore, using the NIMFA equation in the metastable state \u2212\u03b4vj\u221e+\u03b2(1\u2212vj\u221e)\u2211i=1Najivi\u221e=0, we can eliminate \u03b4 and (22) becomes\n(23)\u03b2=\u2212vj\u221e\u2211i=1Najivi\u221eln[Rj\u221e(h)]h.Under NIMFA, the curing rate \u03b4 can be estimated by (22) without knowing the underlying network. However, to estimate the infection rate \u03b2, formula (23) involves the network information. We rewrite (23) as\n\u2212vj\u221e\u03b2ln[Rj\u221e(h)]h=\u2211i=1Najivi\u221eand sum over all nodes\n\u2212\u2211j=1Nvj\u221e\u03b2ln[Rj\u221e(h)]h=\u2211j=1N\u2211i=1Najivi\u221e=\u2211i=1Ndivi\u221e,where di is the degree of node i. After rearrangement of the above equation, we obtain\n(24)\u03b2=\u2212\u2211j=1Nvj\u221e\u2211j=1Ndjvj\u221eln[Rj\u221e(h)]h.Thus, the estimation of the infection rate \u03b2 requires either the degree of every node dj for all j as in (24) or the local topology information about node j, i.e., aji for all i as in (23).",

Interestingly, the steady-state autocorrelation is independent of the curing rate \u03b4 in regular graphs. Moreover, using the Magnus expansion, we are able to calculate the autocorrelation in the transient state of the SIS process.
