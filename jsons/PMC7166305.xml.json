The patients who had a routine laboratory test including lipids in our hospital between January 9 and 17, 2020 prior to their SARS-CoV2 infection and tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 during the COVID-19 epidemic were included in this study. All patients were admitted to our hospital between January 18 and February 8, 2020, and were either discharged or died by March 15, 2020. Healthy subjects (n = 31) and patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD, n = 21) who had lipid tests in our hospital between September 2019 to October 2019 were included as normal and non-COVID-19 controls. Electronic medical records including demographic, clinical treatment, and laboratory data, were extracted. Detailed methods were described in the supplementary materials. Data were presented as median (interquartile range, IQR) or mean (standard deviation, s.d.) and a Mann-Whitney U test was used to compare differences between groups.",

            "text": "There are several possible explanations for aberrant lipid levels in COVID-19 patients. First, it may result from a liver injury. Although liver functions only exhibit mild abnormalities in protein synthesis (Supplementary Table 1), whether lipid biogenesis has been impaired is yet to be determined. Second, viral infection induced pro-inflammatory cytokines modulate lipid metabolism including oxidation of LDL by reactive oxygen species singling to facilitate LDL clearance [[11], [12], [13]]. A measurement of oxidized LDL in patient's serum will aid in determining this mechanism. Third, COVID-19 patients may have an increased vascular permeability caused by viral-induced inflammation. Exudates have been found evidently in the early phase of COVID-19 lung pathology [8]. Exudative fluids, containing high levels of protein and cholesterol, are caused by inflammation-related vascular permeability [14,15], which may be one possible mechanism underlying our data. The major limitations of this study include a small size of patients and lack of information of specific lipoproteins and oxidized LDLs. Another limitation is lack of a data set with lipids monitoring on a hospitalized non-COVID-19 disease group to further address the specificity between LDL levels and COVID-19 severity. We also posit that the dyslipidemia plays an important role in pathological development of COVID-19, which mechanism needs an urgent investigation. In conclusion, our results demonstrate that LDL decrease is associated with pathological course of COVID-19, which can serve a factor to access the disease progression and mortality.",
