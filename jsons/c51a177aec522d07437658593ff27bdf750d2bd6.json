The first article entitled \"Moderate and severe exacerbations have a significant impact on health-related quality of life, utility, and lung function in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease: A meta-analysis\" concluded that moderate to severe exacerbations had a substantial and lasting impact on health-related quality of life, utility and lung function in these patients. The second article on \"Prognostic significance of the controlling nutritional status (CONUT) score in patients with colorectal cancer\" concluded that this score was a practical prognostic factor associated with prognosis of colorectal cancer.",

The first study compared single anastomosis duodenal switch-proximal approach versus one anastomosis gastric bypass-mini gastric bypass found both procedures to result in excellent control on weight, HOMA-IR index and diabetes mellitus. The second article is a population based cost analysis in Ontario, Canada to compare Health economic evaluation between simultaneous versus staged resection for synchronous colorectal liver metastases. The study concluded that the cost for the staged procedure to be significantly higher despite similar postoperative complications rates between the 2 procedures. The third article is a multi-center study to compare low anterior resection syndrome in ovarian cancer patients. The study concluded that this syndrome was frequent and under-reported in patients who required cytoreductive surgery with rectal resection. The fourth article on \"Enhanced recovery after surgery protocols in patients undergoing liver transplantation\" concluded the protocol to be safe, feasible and improved patients' recovery. Finally, the fifth article used propensity score-matching analysis to compare single-site robotic versus single-incision laparoscopic cholecystectomy. The study concluded that the former procedure was superior to the latter procedure by decreasing the incidence of bile leakage.",

            "text": "this June 2020 issue of International Journal of Surgery. Industry 3.0 was brought about and spurred by the advances in the electronic industry in the last several decades of the 20 th Century [1]. It has been considered to be the bridge between Harry Ford's move towards greater productivity and the intelligent processes that we are now seeing arise under Industry 4.0. These production processes were not only streamlined as they were designed by Ford, but automation made vital parts of the processes safer and more efficient [2]. The invention and industrial application of a variety of electronic devices which automated machines substantially resulted in reduced effort, increased speed, improved accuracy and in some cases even completely replaced human power. Software systems were designed to integrate electronic hardware into manufacturing systems, and to enable management processes like enterprise resource planning, inventory management, logistics in tracking deliveries, product flow scheduling and monitoring of manufacturing processes. With advances in electronics and intelligent technology, the pressure to further reduce costs forced many manufacturers to move to low cost countries [1,2]. The subsequent dispersion of geographical locations of manufacturing led to the formation of the concept of Supply Chain Management, and later World Economy or Global Economy [3]. Surgery 3.0 evolved in the 1990s and is still developing in the 21 st century. It is marked by the development and gradual acceptance of minimally invasive surgery (MIS) by surgeons around the world. MIS includes interventional, laparoscopic and robotic surgery. Many MIS operations have now replaced traditional open surgery to become the gold standards of surgery. Although MIS has been used mainly as a diagnostic tool for abdominal pathologies in the first few decades of the 20 th century, it was until after the 1980s when therapeutic MIS was established that MIS became widely accepted by the surgical community [4]. MIS has the advantages of less access trauma, faster recovery, less pain, less wound complications and better cosmesis than open surgery. I shall talk more about the development of MIS in the coming issues of the Editor's perspectives.",
