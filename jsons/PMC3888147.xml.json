In the RCT, children with no underlying chronic medical conditions between 3 and 15 years of age (n = 947) from 46 colonies were randomly assigned by colony to receive either inactivated seasonal influenza vaccine (A/Brisbane/59/2007[H1N1]-like virus, A/Brisbane/10/2007[H3N2]-like virus, B/Florida/4/2006-like virus; Vaxigrip) or hepatitis A vaccine (Avaxim-Pediatric, Sanofi Pasteur). Children with underlying conditions (n = 65) and other children (n = 174) were followed but not randomized. All participants were followed regularly with twice-weekly assessments by research nurses over the influenza season, defined by the start date (1 laboratory-confirmed influenza case for 2 consecutive weeks) and stop date (no laboratory-confirmed influenza cases for 2 consecutive weeks). This period was from 28 December 2008 to 23 June 2009.",

Age was also analyzed both as a continuous variable and categorized into 3 groups (<5 years, 5\u20139 years, 10\u201315 years). A Cox proportional hazards model was used to estimate adjusted hazard ratios (aHRs), and the model was adjusted for clustering at the colony level. Variables with a P value < .1 were considered for inclusion in the multivariable model, and the final model was determined using a stepwise backwards elimination method. It was decided a priori to adjust the final model for age and sex. The proportional hazards assumption was evaluated using Sho\u00ebnfeld residual test, graphically using Sho\u00ebnfeld residuals and log-log curves and examination of variables for time dependence. Overall model fit was assessed using Cox-Snell residuals and deviance residual plots.",

            "text": "Other Canadian studies have failed to show an association between vitamin D status and risk for hospitalization for acute lower respiratory infection in children <5 years of age [19, 25]. Although differences in vitamin D levels were not found in these studies, a higher proportion of participants with acute lower respiratory infection were found to have vitamin D receptor polymorphisms associated with reduced receptor expression in one study [34]. We did find an association between serum 25(OH)D level and upper RTI in children <5 years of age, which may be related to differences in population (urban vs rural, genetic differences such as vitamin D receptor polymorphisms), study design, serum 25(OH)D measurements, or outcome (upper vs lower RTI).",

It has been postulated that lower vitamin D levels may explain the seasonal variation in influenza [35]. In the case of RSV infection, studies have shown that in RSV-infected human airway epithelial cells, vitamin D induces Ik\u03b2\u03b1, an NF-k\u03b2 inhibitor, in airway epithelium and decreases RSV induction of inflammatory genes [11]. Although we were unable to look at serum 25(OH)D level and the risk of individual respiratory viruses, this area warrants further research as serum 25(OH)D level may impact viruses differently.",

            "text": "Our study has several limitations. First, we obtained only 1 vitamin D measurement for each participant and therefore do not have the exact level around the time of RTI. However, serum 25(OH)D measurements were taken around the same time in October and November and reflect the vitamin D status at the start of the respiratory infection season prior to the development of viral RTI. We believe this estimate is more appropriate than estimates taken at the time of illness because the impact of acute viral illness on serum 25(OH)D levels has not been studied. These levels were also taken at a time just after levels tend to peak in the Northern Hemisphere [36]. Therefore, it is unlikely that vitamin D levels would have rebounded by early spring and had an appreciable impact on infections that occurred later in the follow-up period. In addition, 10 participants had serum for 25(OH)D levels obtained after the follow-up period had started. Sensitivity analysis removing these estimates also did not affect the results. A third limitation was that data were not collected on sources of vitamin D intake for each individual participant. However, there are no data demonstrating that vitamin D supplementation or the use of fortified foods is part of routine practice in Hutterite communities, and therefore we do not feel that this would affect our analysis. Finally, this study was conducted in Hutterite children and adolescents and may not be generalizable to other populations. Studies evaluating other pediatric populations are warranted.",
