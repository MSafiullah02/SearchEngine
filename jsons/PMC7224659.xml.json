Futile line insertions will subject the staff to unnecessary viral exposure as well as misallocation of limited medical supplies and personal protective equipment (PPE). In particular, a significant portion of patients with severe COVID-19 disease will develop renal failure requiring hemodialysis and the prognosis appears to be very poor.5 This is limiting available hemodialysis machines and exposing the dialysis staff to COVID-19. Thus, it is particularly important in these patients needing hemodialysis access that a goals of care discussion is held prior to line insertion whenever possible. In non-intubated patients who are hemodynamically stable, preference can be given to placement of midline catheters or large bore peripheral intravenous access.",

The ultrasound machines are meticulously cleaned with an alcohol-based solution after every use. We realize some institutions may have limited access to ultrasounds in which case anatomic landmarks can be used. This will also avoid transporting and cleaning an ultrasound machine for each procedure. Additionally, portable chest x-rays may be difficult to obtain in a timely fashion during the COVID-19 crisis. An advantage of femoral vein access is no post-procedure chest x-ray is needed. However, for straightforward internal jugular vein central lines, post-procedure chest x-rays are not routinely ordered to avoid potential exposure of the virus to radiology staff.",

The majority of these high-risk for aerosolization procedures have been in non-intubated patients with COVID-19 and renal failure requiring hemodialysis access. Additionally, a significant portion of patients with severe COVID-19 may require prone positioning to improve oxygenation and ventilation. In these instances, femoral lines will be much more difficult to access and preference can be given to internal jugular vein access. Some providers have routinely placed triple lumen catheters (TLC) in the left IJ or subclavian vein so the right side can be used for hemodialysis catheters if needed. An alternative is that both the TLC and dialysis catheter can be placed on the right side, with spacing of the access sites in the neck. We have noted that many of our lines have thrombosed shortly after line insertion when instilled with saline or low dose heparin. Thus, we have begun to instill each port of the central line with heparinized saline (5000U/cc).",
