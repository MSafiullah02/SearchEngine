The purposive sample was enrolled from the departments where doctors, nurses, and technicians were likely to be in contact with blood, needles, and sharps, such as internal medicine, surgery, and laboratories. Temporary employees were excluded. Participants were informed verbally of the aims of the survey and provided their answers voluntarily in an anonymous written questionnaire, which assessed (1) sociodemographic characteristics: age, gender, job category (doctors, nurses, technicians); (2) exposure type: exposure to blood that is potentially infectious during work lifetime; (3) exposure frequency: number of exposure episode(s) during the previous year; (4) engagement in 8 protective behaviors related to the practice of SP; and (5) awareness and training history on SP. We calculated an individual compliance score by summing the scores for the 8 protective behaviors of SP, ranging from 0 to 8. A higher compliance score indicates better compliance with SP.",

Furthermore, we suggest to also include other psychosocial factors, such as attitude, belief, and social norm, from the Theory of Planned Behavior,5 which has previously shown effectively to explain and enhance compliance of HCWs.6 Finally, a favorable physical environment is essential. For example, sufficient supply of PPE is a prerequisite for compliance of HCWs with SP.7\n",

This retrospective study relies on self-reported information, possibly leading to under-reporting of actual exposure (because of recall bias) and to overestimate the extent to which they comply with SP in practice (because of social desirability bias). Also, the respondents came from tertiary hospitals where health care quality and safety are considered to be higher than in general hospitals in China.8 Nevertheless, the high level of risk and insufficient precautions taken in the tertiary hospitals, as well as the likelihood of under-reporting of exposure and over-reporting of compliance, reflect an urgent need for interventions to improve the occupational safety of HCWs nationally.",
