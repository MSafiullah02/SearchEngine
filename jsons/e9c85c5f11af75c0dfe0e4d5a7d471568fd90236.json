Since PDCoV was first detected in 2009 in Hong Kong, the prevalence of PDCoV has increased in recent years, resulting in serious economic losses to the swine industry. The coronavirus spike (S) protein is an antigen that has been demonstrated to contain epitopes that induce neutralizing antibodies. The presence of serum and milk IgA antibodies against pathogens that replicate primarily on mucosal surfaces is important for mucosal immunity. Here, an indirect anti-PDCoV IgA antibody enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (PDCoV S1 IgA ELISA) using the purified S1 portion of S protein as the coating antigen was developed to detect PDCoV IgA antibodies in serum and sow's milk. A receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis showed high specificity and sensitivity of the PDCoV-S1-IgA-ELISA based on samples confirmed by IFA. Anti-PDCoV IgA antibodies in 152 serum samples and 65 milk samples collected from six farms that had experienced diarrhea outbreaks within previous last two years were detected by this assay, and 62.5% of the serum samples and 100% of the milk samples were positive for PDCoV. The indirect ELISA method established in this study will provide a convenient tool for measurement of serum and milk IgA levels against PDCoV in pig herds, rapid detection of PDCoV infection in pigs, and evaluation of the immunogenicity of vaccines.",

Like other coronaviruses, PDCoV also contains four main structural proteins: the spike (S), envelope (E), membrane (M), and nucleocapsid (N) proteins. The S protein is postulated to contain epitopes that induce neutralizing antibodies, and it has receptor-binding, cell membrane fusion, and virus entry functions [14, 15] . In most coronaviruses, the S protein is cleaved into two separate polypeptides, S1 and S2, by a host cell furin-like protease. S1 is the large receptor-binding domain, while S2 mediates membrane fusion and virus entry [16] [17] [18] . Enzymelinked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs) for the detection of antibodies against porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) and transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) based on the purified S1 portion of the S protein have been successfully developed [19] [20] [21] .",

However, PDCoV is an enteric pathogen, and the presence of IgA antibodies against pathogens that replicate primarily on mucosal surfaces is important for mucosal immunity. IgA is an important immunoglobulin for mucosal immunity that can be detected in serum and milk of pigs after virus challenge or inoculation, and therefore serum and milk IgA antibodies to enteric pathogens can act as indicators [25, 26] . Therefore, measuring IgA levels in serum and milk samples is critical for evaluating the level of protection of the mucosal response against PDCoV infection. Here, we have developed an indirect anti-PDCoV IgA antibody ELISA that uses the purified S1 portion of PDCoV S protein as a coating antigen. This assay will serve as a convenient tool for measuring of serum and milk IgA antibody levels in pig herds. Many studies have shown that serum antibodies are passed mainly to piglets through sow's milk, which results in passive immunoprotection. IgA antibodies have a variety of biological functions, such as inhibiting adhesion and immunological exclusion and neutralization of viruses [27] . Thus, an indirect ELISA for detection of IgA antibodies against PDCoV can be used as a sensitive and specific quantitative method to evaluate immunity to PDCoV.",
