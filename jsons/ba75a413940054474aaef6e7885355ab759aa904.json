infection and self-limited viral illness in this age group \u2022 Neonates who have fever and do not appear ill have a 7% risk of having a serious bacterial infection \u2022 Serious bacterial infections include occult bacteremia, meningitis, pneumonia, osteomyelitis, septic arthritis, enteritis, and UTI \u2022 Late onset neonatal bacterial diseases, e.g., group B Streptococci, E. coli, and Listeria monocytogenes and perinatal herpes (HSV) infection \u2022 If the neonate has fever recorded at home by reliable parents, the patient should be treated as febrile neonate \u2022 If excessive clothing and blanket falsely elevate the temperature, the excessive covering should be removed and retake the temperature in 15-30 min Management \u2022 All febrile neonates must be hospitalized \u2022 Full sepsis evaluation including blood, urine; CSF should be cultured \u2022 CSF studies should include cell count, glucose, and protein level, Gram stain, cultures; HSV, and enterovirus PCR should be considered \u2022 Blood and urine cultures warranted \u2022 Chest radiograph may be included \u2022 Child should receive empiric antibiotics such as cefotaxime or gentamicin + ampicillin \u2022 Acyclovir should be included if HSV infection is suspected Fever in 1-3-Month-Old Infants Background \u2022 Large majority of children with fever without localizing signs in 1-3 months age group likely viral syndrome \u2022 Most viral diseases have distinct seasonal pattern, unlike bacteria, e.g., respiratory syncytial virus, and influenza more common dur-Well-appearing infants 1-3 months previously healthy with no evidence of focus of infection: -WBCs count of 5000-15,000 cells/\u03bcL, an absolute band count of \u2264 1500 cells/\u03bcL, normal urinalysis, and negative culture (blood and urine) results are unlikely to have a serious bacterial infection \u2022 The decision to obtain CSF studies in the well-appearing 1-3 months old infant depends on the decision to administer empiric antibiotics \u2022 If close observation without antibiotics planned, a lumbar puncture may be deferred Fever in 3-36 Months of Age Background \u2022 Approximately 30% of febrile children in the 3-36 months age group have no localizing signs of infection \u2022 Viral infections cause most fevers in this population \u2022 Risk factors indicating probability of occult bacteremia: Temperature \u2265 39 \u00b0C, WBC count \u2265 15,000/\u03bcL, elevated absolute neutro-phil count, bands, ESR and C-reactive protein (CRP) \u2022 The risk of bacteremia and/or pneumonia or pyelonephritis among infants 3-36 months of age increases as temperature (especially > 40 \u00b0C) and WBC count (especially > 25,000) increase For nontoxic-appearing infants who have temperature < 39 \u00b0C: Can be observed as outpatient with no diagnostic test or antibiotics \u2022 For nontoxic infants who have rectal temper-ature \u2265 39 \u00b0C, options include obtaining a blood culture and administering empiric antibiotic therapy (ceftriaxone, a single dose 50 mg/kg not to exceed 1 g); or blood culture with no antibiotic and observing the patient within 24 h as outpatient.
