RNA was reverse transcribed and amplified by a TaqMan EZ RT-PCR Core Reagents kit in a 7000 Sequence Detection System (Applied Biosystems). The ORF1b region of SARS-CoV was the target for SARS detection and 18S rRNA sequence derived from infected host was used as internal positive control. Briefly, 4 \u03bcl of RNA was amplified in a 25 \u03bcl reaction containing 2.5 U rTth DNA polymerase (Applied Biosystems), 5 \u03bcl of 5\u00d7 TaqMan EZ buffer, 300 \u03bcM of dNTPs (except 1200 \u03bcM for dUTP), 3 mM of manganese acetate and 2.5 U of AmpErase UNG. For the monoplex assay for ORF1b sequence, 800 nM of primers (5\u2032-CAGAACGCTGTAGCTTCAAAAATCT-3\u2019 and 5\u2019-TCAGAACCCTGTGATGAATCAACAG-3\u2032), and 400 nM of probe [5\u2032-(FAM)TCTGCGTAGGCAATCC(NFQ)-3\u2032; FAM, 6-carboxyfluorescein; NFQ, nonfluorescent quencher] were used. The specificity of this primers-probe set was demonstrated previously (Poon et al., 2003a, Poon et al., 2004). In vitro transcribed T7 RNA polymerase transcripts or plasmid DNA containing the target viral sequence was used positive controls to generate calibration curves. Reactions were first incubated at 50 \u00b0C for 2 min, followed by 60 \u00b0C for 30 min. After a 5 min denaturation at 95 \u00b0C, reactions were then thermal-cycled for 50 cycles (94 \u00b0C for 15 s, 58 \u00b0C for 1 min). For simultaneous detection of SARS-CoV and 18S rRNA, 2.5 nM of primers and 10 nm of VIC-labeled probe specific for 18S rRNA molecules (TaqMan Ribosomal RNA Control Reagents, Applied Biosystems) was added into a reaction as instructed (Applied Biosystems).",

To minimize and control for these factors, we further modify our test into a duplex RT-PCR assay that allows simultaneous detection of SARS-CoV and endogenous 18S rRNA derived from host cells. This duplex assay had a dynamic range for SARS-CoV from 106 to at least 10 copies per reaction (Fig. 1A\n). We evaluated this duplex assay by using 48 SARS specimens which were tested by the monoplex RT-PCR as described above (Fig. 1B). Of these 48 SARS samples, 44 were positive in the previous assay. Results generated from the duplex RT-PCR assay correlated completely with the results of the monoplex assay. The correlation coefficient for ORF1b sequence concentrations deduced from these two systems was 0.995 (Pearson correlation analysis; P<0.001; Fig. 2\n), indicating that the primer-limiting amplification of 18S ribosomal RNA does not affect PCR amplification efficiency for the viral sequence. All of these SARS samples were positive for the 18S rRNA as expected. Furthermore, all of negative control samples (N=24) were negative for SARS-CoV, but positive for the 18S rRNA.",

In particular, we recently reported a highly sensitive two step quantitative RT-PCR assay for early SARS diagnosis which has been validated on relevant clinical specimens (Poon et al., 2003a). In order to reduce hands-on processing time and handling procedures, we have modified this assay into a one step RT-PCR assay. The overall sensitivity and specificity of the test is 86.2% and 100%, respectively. In addition, we further modified this assay into a duplex assay that allows simultaneous detection of SARS-CoV and 18S rRNA as an internal positive control. The detection of 18S rRNA enables us to discriminate false-negative due to PCR inhibitors. To avoid interference with the amplification of ORF1b sequence, the concentration of primers specific for the 18S rRNA was limited to 100 nM, a concentration eight times lower than the one for SARS-CoV detection. Results generated from the duplex assay correlates exactly with that of the monoplex assay, demonstrating the internal positive control could be detected with no discernible effect on target sequence detection. In conclusion, we have reported a one step quantitative RT-PCR assay for simultaneous detection of SARS-CoV and 18S rRNA sequences.",
