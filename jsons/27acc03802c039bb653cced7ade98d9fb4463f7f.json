This advocacy note details how Child Study Center, an applied behavior analysis facility in North Texas, transitioned into Camp Cook, a free-of-charge childcare facility that operates weekdays from 6:00 a.m. to 8:00 p.m. Closing the doors on our billable services allowed us to open them to the essential health care workers who were fighting on the front lines against COVID-19. Here we describe the redeployment of employees across 3 departments in an effort to ease the burden of childcare within our local community.",

These include, but are not limited to, language, social skills, academic skills, leisure skills, and self-help skills (e.g., using the toilet, eating). Reduction of stereotypy and other problem behavior (e.g., tantrums) are also targeted. Services are provided 7 hr per day, 5 days per week, and have an overall duration of 2-3 years.

On Friday, March 13, in conjunction with senior leadership and after consulting with state and local health authorities, CSC closed the day programs for 2 weeks.

Although it was an easier endeavor for JJS than for Autism Services or BDC, JJS was suddenly charged with providing ad hoc distance learning to students. Because of our unique population, we felt it was unreasonable, if not unethical, to ask parents to become their children's teachers and require online learning. Further, many of our parents were themselves considered essential employees and were not home with their children. These considerations led us to develop classroom distance-learning websites that contain customized links where parents and students can access worksheets and online educational programs. Teachers also communicate with students via Zoom and are able to check work and provide feedback. At the time of this writing, about 90% of our students are reliably engaging with the content on the websites.",

Responses could generally be divided into two categories: \"We're doing fine, but she misses her therapists and peers\" and \"Being stuck inside with her routine disrupted has brought about problem behavior like we've never seen before!\" Knowing that we had to do something for the latter group, we frantically began exploring options for the provision of telehealth services. Although we had never previously considered telehealth, we are fortunate to be part of a health care system with physicians who practice telemedicine, so the infrastructure had already been developed. Still, significant thought and effort were required to understand payor rules, evaluate delivery methods, and ensure that the services we provide would genuinely make a positive impact on our patients. As most who work in clinical settings would predict, responses from insurers were often inadequate or contradictory. Thanks to the work of staff in our Client Services Department, we began providing telehealth services on Thursday, April 9.",

We would soon know, as Cook Children's Emergency Task Force asked if we could operate a childcare facility for the children of essential employees. Cook Children's operates a day care on site, but with every school district and most early childhood centers closed, ensuring all employees had childcare was difficult. Thus, CSC transitioned into \"Camp Cook,\" a free-of-charge childcare facility operating Monday through Friday from 6:00 a.m. to 8:00 p.m. and staffed by CSC day program staff.",

Second, because of social distancing guidelines, we limit the number of guests in each room, resulting in much smaller classrooms (\u226410) and ratios (1:5). Third, the hours are extended to accommodate employees who work a 12-hr shift at the hospital. And finally, many of our guests have been assigned online schoolwork to complete during the day. This has worked in our favor, as who is better equipped to monitor virtual schoolwork than a staff of teachers and behavior technicians? When our guests complete their virtual school requirements, Camp Cook staff schedule periods of time that vary in structure. Guests participate in classroom games and activities, use two outdoor playgrounds and our indoor gym, and go to art class three times per week.",

Most of them are completing work at or above grade level. They have amazing social skills, flow effortlessly through conversations, and follow directions with a smile and a \"yes, ma'am\" (and maybe an occasional eye roll from our preteen set). They eat their lunches, use the restroom, wash their hands, and generally take care of their business independently. Not surprisingly, we have observed that these children are sensitive to the same contingencies of reinforcement as the students and patients we traditionally serve in each of our respective programs. Having a well-prepared staff who are accustomed to providing high rates of positive reinforcement helped ease the transition. Moreover, this is an opportunity for our staff to see what typical development looks like. It is a reference point and a good reminder of the outcomes for which we are working every day.",
