            "text": "The coronavirus has placed the healthcare worldwide system under tremendous strain. As part of the global approach to manage COVID-19, a number of social distancing measures were implemented. In the health context, the good practices should consider delaying or re-scheduling patients coming in both for not urgent situations and periodic exams, in particular for the elderly or those with chronic health issues [1]. Not only for patients\u2019 safety but also to ensure resources, the Italian National Institute of Health has recommended that non-emergency surgery be delayed. Moreover, it must be considered that COVID-19 can complicate the perioperative course with diagnostic challenge and a high potential fatality rate. In locations with widespread infections and limited resources, the risk of elective surgical procedures may outweigh the benefit [2]. The authors have expertise in colorectal surgery, and they have changed the day-life practice concerning not only the surgery itself but also the extensive management of patients with colorectal conditions. From March 1 to April 25, 2020, we have rescheduled 82% of colorectal resections for benign conditions. On the contrary only 12% for malignancies has been postponed because the delay could have had an impact on the quality of care and condition a worsening of results even in the long term of cancer treatment [3]. During the same time period, we have also reduced about 60% of outpatient clinic for patients with stoma and colorectal diseases but there are some conditions that even if not cancer related, cannot be deferred (e.g. the stoma education and management). Recently, some authors have underlined pragmatical and technical suggestions in the work-up for colorectal surgical patients during Covid-19 outbreak but remains poorly investigated the way to follow step by step the patient during the perioperative period [4].",

The platform will help patients in the route of surgery based on ERAS guidelines ensuring customized and real-optimized care [5]. Moreover, patients will be able to receive some of the customized post-surgical care they need without having to go to a medical centre. iColon sends push notifications twice daily to remember to fill out the adhesion of the items. At the end of each daily questionnaire, the app provides a feedback to clinicians on the patient\u2019s status and adherence to daily optimization and recovery after discharge. The surgeon follows patients\u2019 route on a dedicated web-app platform. In case of critical issues arbitrarily chosen for each phase such as fever, increased stoma output and difficult pain control, a specific alert is sent to the surgeons. For the abovementioned reasons, the IRCCS Sacro Cuore Don Calabria Hospital has designed the iColon app, customized during the outbreak to support government efforts to reduce the spread of the disease. In the COVID-19 era, iColon will connect patients with their care team and will facilitate the take-over of needful information about patient\u2019s health allowing a safe hospitalization.",

In addition, after discharge, the app could aid the process of identifying people who have been developed suspicious symptoms and their potential \u201ccontacts\u201d. While many patients will understand the circumstances and the need for this evolution, there will be challenges associated with a rapid transition to an outpatient telehealth. At first, the sacred patient-physician relationship has traditionally been developed during face-to-face interactions which will represent a shift from our current culture. Secondly, some patients may not have access to required technology for telehealth services, which may exacerbate disparities in obtaining care during the current pandemic.",
