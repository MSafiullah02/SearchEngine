Vaccination is aimed at protecting animals from infectious agents and plays an important role in public health. No vaccine, however, is completely effective or without adverse reactions, and vaccine-associated adverse events (VAAEs) do occur, albeit infrequently, after vaccinations. Epidemiological surveys in the United Kingdom (Gaskell et al., 2002) and the United States (Moore et al., 2005) identified the rates for VAAEs as 0.093 and 38.2/10,000 vaccinated dogs, respectively.",

According to large epidemiological studies on canine VAAEs, the incidences of anaphylaxis were 0.018/10,000 vaccinated dogs in the United Kingdom (Gaskell et al., 2002) and 0.65/10,000 vaccinated dogs in the United States (Moore et al., 2005). Based on a survey of a small number (35) of Japanese veterinary hospitals, the anaphylaxis rate in Japan appeared to be somewhat higher, at 0.17% (6/3477 vaccinated dogs) (Fujimura, 2006). However, to date, no large-scale investigation had been carried out on VAAEs associated with canine non-rabies combined vaccine in Japan. Moreover, although incidences of anaphylaxis were provided, none of the previous studies (Gaskell et al., 2002, Moore et al., 2005, Fujimura, 2006) considered important details, such as concurrent symptomatic states.",

Practicing veterinarians diagnosed adverse reactions and classified them into 5 groups according to clinical signs: death, anaphylaxis, dermatological signs (swelling of face, pruritus, urticaria, flush, and erythema), gastro-intestinal signs (vomiting and diarrhea), and other signs (including hypodynamia and anorexia). In cases of anaphylaxis, additional information was obtained by reinvestigation to support the diagnoses.

            "text": "The risks involved in vaccination of dogs were highlighted by previous large epidemiological studies (Gaskell et al., 2002, Moore et al., 2005); however, surveys on VAAEs had only been performed on a small scale in Japan (Ohmori et al., 2002, Ohmori et al., 2005a, Fujimura, 2006). Here, we present the results of a large-scale investigation of VAAEs at Japanese veterinary hospitals. We found a VAAE rate of 62.7/10,000 vaccinated dogs, which is much higher than the rates reported in the United Kingdom (0.093/10,000 vaccinated dogs) (Gaskell et al., 2002) and the United States (38.2/10,000 vaccinated dogs) (Moore et al., 2005). Previous reports suggested that small breed dogs (<10 kg), especially Dachshunds, were more prone to VAAEs than larger dogs (Gaskell et al., 2002, Moore et al., 2005, Moore and Hogenesch, 2010). According to the Japan Kennel Club (http://www.jkc.or.jp), Miniature Dachshund, Chihuahua, and Toy Poodle are the most popular breeds in this country, and account for just over half of the total registrations in the Club (50.3%). This popular breed bias and the proposed breed susceptibility may contribute to higher VAAEs rate in Japan than in other countries.",

Our previous study reported large amounts of bovine serum albumin (BSA) and bovine IgG contents in canine vaccines (Ohmori et al., 2005b). Furthermore, we found IgE reactivity against fetal calf serum (FCS) components in dogs with allergic reactions after vaccination, suggesting that most of these reactions might be caused by FCS components derived from the culture media used to produce vaccines (Ohmori et al., 2005b, Ohmori et al., 2007). Many vaccines that are commonly used in Japan are imported from abroad, although a few are made in Japan. Multilateral studies are necessary to clarify the relationship between VAAEs and vaccine by-products, and to ascertain whether certain vaccines are more likely to give rise to VAAEs.",

The dogs showing anaphylaxis in the present study included many small breeds such as Miniature Dachshund and Miniature Schnauzer.

Unfortunately, as the information regarding dogs with no adverse events could not be obtained in the present study, the odds ratios of VAAEs could not be estimated; however, we did estimate the P values for anaphylaxis according to adverse reactions after vaccine administrations using a logistic regression model. Additionally, we were not able to analyze the relationship between breed and anaphylaxis due to small sample numbers for many breeds. However, no significant differences were observed in the anaphylaxis risk by sex and neuter status, weight, and age; thus, our data seem to show the same tendency of potential risk factors for VAAEs in the results of Moore et al. (2005). The results of the present study suggest that various factors such as weight and age could predict the potential risk of adverse reactions, including anaphylaxis after vaccination, which may allow practicing veterinarians to allay the anxiety of at least a few owners regarding vaccination.",
