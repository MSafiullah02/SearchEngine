Its symptoms include high fever, chills, rigors, dyspnea, nonproductive cough, myalgias, lymphopenia, and chest infiltrates, which begin after an incubation period of 2\u201310 days. SARS initially appeared in southern China at the end of 2002 and was first recognized as a new disease entity by World Health Organization infectious-diseases expert Carlo Urbani. By the beginning of 2003, SARS had spread into 29 countries. The 2003 epidemic lasted >16 weeks and affected 8098 people, 774 of whom died. Nosocomial transmission of SARS-CoV was a striking feature of the epidemic. If another SARS epidemic were to occur, surveillance efforts in containing the secondary transmission of SARS-CoV would ideally be combined with better prophylactic and therapeutic measures. Despite the substantial number of cases and the intensive studies that have been conducted, the mechanism of the protective immune response against SARS-CoV remains unknown",

It is conceivable that, in patients with mild disease, various adaptive and innate immune responses cooperate to control and eventually eradicate SARS-CoV infection in vivo. The cell-mediated antiviral mechanisms against CoVs involve T cells that express \u03b1\u03b2 or \u03b3\u03b4 T cell receptors (TCRs) [3\u20135]. Thus, we analyzed, \u223c3 months after the onset of disease, \u03b1\u03b2 and \u03b3\u03b4 T cell profiles in health care workers (HCWs) who had had SARS and had convalesced (SC-HCWs). In contrast to there being no measurable changes in the population of peripheral-blood \u03b1\u03b2 T cells, the effector memory V\u03b39V\u03b42 T cell population was selectively expanded in the peripheral blood of SC-HCWs. In addition, V\u03b39V\u03b42 T cells were able to inhibit SARS-CoV replication in Vero cells in vitro and to kill SARS-CoV\u2013infected target cells, suggesting a potential role for V\u03b39V\u03b42 T cells in SARS immunosurveillance",

To evaluate the noncytolytic antiviral activity of cell-released soluble factors, 1\u00d7106 \u03b3\u03b4 T cells were plated on 1 \u00d7 104 Vero cells/mL of culture medium. The Vero cell cultures were maintained in flat-bottom 24-well plates and separated (from the stimulated \u03b3\u03b4 T cells) by a semipermeable polycarbonate membrane with a 0.4-\u03bcm pore size (Transwell; BD Labware). After 24 h, the Vero cell cultures were infected with SARS-CoV at an MOI of 0.01. The supernatants were collected 4 days afterward, and the TCID50 per milliliter was determined as described elsewhere [6]. RNA was extracted using NucliSens isolation reagents (NASBA Diagnostics, Organon Teknica), and the number of SARS-CoV RNA copies was assessed by real-time polymerase chain reaction (Artus). Moreover, V\u03b42 T cell lines (expression of V\u03b42 by >80% of cells) were obtained by stimulating the PBMCs from 2 control subjects with IPP (10 \u03bcmol/L) and IL-2 (100 U/mL) for 12 days.

The cultures were then infected with SARS-CoV at an MOI of 0.01. Twenty-four hours after infection, the Vero cell culture supernatants were collected, and the TCID50 per milliliter was determined. A cytokine neutralization assay was performed using a polyclonal rabbit anti\u2013interferon (IFN)\u2013\u03b3 (original titer, 50,000 neutralization units/mL). The concentration of antibody against IFN-\u03b3 was 10,000 U/mL, that is, 10\u2013100-fold higher than that required to neutralize the IFN-\u03b3 present in the supernatants of cultures in which \u03b3\u03b4 T cells are stimulated with 10 \u03bcmol/L IPP",

Therefore, we used THP-1 cells, a human monocytic cell line that is infectable with SARS-CoV in vitro [8].

Although the V\u03b2 T cell profiles (figure 1A) and the effector memory \u03b1\u03b2 T cell profiles (figure 1B) were not significantly altered in the SC-HCWs, compared with those in the control subjects, a substantial expansion of the V\u03b42 T cell population was observed in the SC-HCWs (figure 1A). These results are compatible with the hypothesis that the V\u03b39V\u03b42 T cell population (an absolute majority of V\u03b42 T cells coexpress V\u03b39) is stimulated during infection with SARS-CoV. A representative analysis of the V\u03b42 T cell subsets (the percentages of V\u03b42 T cells expressing or not expressing the CD45RA and CD27 markers\u2014i.e., CD45RA+CD27+ cells [naive], CD45RA\u2212CD27+ cells [central memory], CD45RA\u2212CD27\u2212 cells [effector memory], and CD45RA+CD27\u2212 cells [effector]) in one of the SC-HCWs is shown in figure 1A(inset). The representation of naive and fully differentiated effector V\u03b42 T cells was not significantly different (P\u2a7e.05, Mann-Whitney U test) between the 2 groups. In contrast, the central and effector memory subsets were significantly (P<.05, Mann-Whitney U test) expanded in the SC-HCWs, compared with those in the control subjects (figure 1A, inset). Interestingly, the higher number of circulating V\u03b42 T cells was associated with higher anti\u2013SARS-CoV\u2013specific IgG titers (titer, >1:500; P=.036, Mann-Whitney U test). Therefore, it is conceivable that SARS-CoV infection induces a V\u03b42 T cell response that may be involved in the anti\u2013SARS-CoV immunosurveillance in vivo",

Both freshly purified \u03b3\u03b4 T cells and \u03b3\u03b4 T cell lines were used. Initially, \u03b3\u03b4 T cells from the control subjects were purified by magnetic microbead selection and stimulated with IPP. Then, the \u03b3\u03b4 T cells were cocultured with SARS-CoV\u2013infected Vero cells separated from the \u03b3\u03b4 T cells by a semipermeable membrane. In addition, V\u03b39V\u03b42 T cell lines were obtained by stimulating PBMCs from the control subjects with IPP and IL-2, and the resulting \u03b3\u03b4 T cell lines were restimulated with IPP. The supernatants from these cultures that contained soluble molecules released by IPP-activated cell lines were tested for their anti\u2013SARS-CoV activity. These experiments demonstrated that stimulated V\u03b39V\u03b42 T cells release noncytolytic antiviral GDFs. The presence of GDFs in the SARS-CoV\u2013infected Vero cell cultures substantially reduced the quantity of SARS-CoV infectious units (measured as TCID50) produced in the system, compared with that in control cultures (figure 2A). Also, the total viral load (measured as the number of SARS-CoV RNA copies) was considerably decreased in the presence of GDFs. Interestingly, the anti\u2013SARS-CoV activity of the GDFs was completely abolished by the addition of an antibody against IFN-\u03b3 (figure 2A). These results strongly suggest that IFN-\u03b3 is at least partially responsible for the observed antiviral action of the GDFs. Additional experiments demonstrated that the GDFs complemented IFN-\u03b1 in blocking SARS-CoV replication (data not shown), confirming a synergistic SARS-CoV\u2013inhibitory activity of human type I and type II IFNs [9]. Finally, the V\u03b39V\u03b42 T cell/THP-1 cocultures were used to assess cytotoxic function and cytokine production. Our results demonstrated that production of IFN-\u03b3 is augmented in V\u03b39V\u03b42 T cells stimulated by SARS-CoV in vitro (769.8 pg/mL in uninfected cocultures vs. 979.0 pg/mL in SARS-CoV\u2013infected cocultures) (figure 2B). In addition, analysis of hypodiploid nuclei demonstrated a substantial increase in the cytotoxicity of V\u03b39V\u03b42 T cells against SARS-CoV\u2013infected THP-1 target cells (87.5%), compared with that against uninfected target cells (21.9%). Thus, it appears that SARS-CoV infection of THP-1 cells promotes the cytotoxic effector function of V\u03b39V\u03b42 T cells",

One of the traits of SARS is the rapid development of lymphopenia, with CD4+ T cells being more severely reduced than CD8+ T cells during acute infection [10, 11]. In recovering patients, peripheral \u03b1\u03b2 T cell subsets are rapidly restored, suggesting that tissue sequestration may contribute to the decrease in lymphocyte counts during acute SARS. In addition, CD8+ \u03b1\u03b2 T cell responses to SARS-CoV spike protein epitopes have been observed in patients who had recovered from SARS [12]. Indeed, certain HLA class I molecules may direct the CD8+ T cell response, conferring either protection or increased susceptibility [13]. No V\u03b2-specific changes were measured in our SC-HCWs \u223c3 months after the onset of disease, indicating that any oligoclonal \u03b1\u03b2 T cell response that might have occurred did not persist in the peripheral blood in a form that was detectable by our MAb analysis",

SAgs are proteins produced by certain bacteria, mycoplasma, and viruses that stimulate a large number of T cells that express specific variable regions of the TCR \u03b2 chains. In the present study, we analyzed the TCR V\u03b2 repertoire in the SC-HCWs, and no differences were observed in the frequencies of the different V\u03b2 chains or in the effector memory V\u03b2 T cell subsets in the peripheral blood of the SC-HCWs and the control subjects. Typically, any SAg response is expected to induce a significant perturbation of the V\u03b2 T cell repertoire, resulting in specific deletions or expansions of selected V\u03b2 T cell subsets. Therefore, in light of our data, the involvement of a V\u03b2-specific SAg in the immunopathogenesis of SARS appears to be unlikely",

These cells can display a broad antiviral activity against different viruses, including retroviruses, flaviviruses, paramyxoviruses, orthomyxoviruses, picornaviruses, CoVs, rhabdoviruses, arenaviruses, herpesviruses, hepadnaviruses, and orthopoxviruses [15]. The antiviral action of \u03b3\u03b4 T cells may play an important defensive role, especially given their relatively large numbers (e.g., \u223c1 of 30 adult human PBMCs is a V\u03b39V\u03b42 T cell) and their ability to respond very quickly (typically, no antigen processing is required for the SAg-like activation of V\u03b39V\u03b42 T cells). The molecules recognized by \u03b3\u03b4 T cells during viral infections are probably of cellular rather than viral origin and may be metabolites of altered cellular pathways [15]. Moreover, virus-exposed \u03b3\u03b4 T cells can be rapidly activated by type I IFNs (IFN-\u03b1 and IFN-\u03b2), a phenomenon that is likely to contribute to an effective antiviral response. Thus, the potential involvement of a possible \u03b3\u03b4-specific SAg in SARS-associated immune responses cannot be excluded",

In a rodent model of CoV infection (infection with mouse hepatitis virus [MHV]), T cells expressing the \u03b3\u03b4 TCR appeared to be the major T cell effectors and were found predominantly in areas of virus replication [3]. In MHV-infected mice, \u03b3\u03b4 T cells may function by both lysing infected target cells and secreting proinflammatory cytokines and could be important for anti-MHV responses in vivo. In our experiments, we observed that V\u03b39V\u03b42 T cells are able to exert a potent cytolytic activity against SARS-CoV\u2013infected target cells. The remarkable similarities of the NKG2D receptor between rodents and humans may support a role for NKG2D ligands in the recognition and killing of CoV-infected cells. In the present study, V\u03b39V\u03b42 T cells appeared to be able to inhibit SARS-CoV replication in vitro through an IFN-\u03b3\u2013dependent process. Recently, Dandekar et al. have shown that \u03b3\u03b4 T cells mediate demyelination in mice infected with MHV (strain JHM), with IFN-\u03b3 and NKG2D as the critical players in this process [4]. NKG2D is an activating, C-type lectin NK cell receptor that is recognized as a potent costimulator of the cytotoxic functions of human V\u03b39V\u03b42 T cells [16]. Our data do not exclude the possibility that NKG2D ligands may be involved in the recognition and killing of SARS-CoV\u2013infected cells. Furthermore, our results are compatible with the idea that V\u03b39V\u03b42 T cells contribute to anti-SARS innate immune responses by employing both cytotoxic and noncytolytic antiviral mechanisms",

It is noteworthy that the in vitro and in vivo activities of V\u03b39V\u03b42 T cells can be stimulated by many nonpeptidic molecules, including nitrogen-containing bisphosphonates (which are frequently used in the treatment of bone-demineralization disorders) and pyrophosphomonoester drugs (which are currently being tested in phase 1 cancer trials) [20]. The relatively low in vivo toxicity of many of these drugs may facilitate novel approaches to the treatment of SARS-CoV infection, including ones that could be based on type II IFN released by activated V\u03b39V\u03b42 T cells in combination with type I IFN chemotherapy",
