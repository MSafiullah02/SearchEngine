We have studied whether such an altered Golgi complex can carry out the glycosylation and transport to the plasma membrane (PM) of the Semliki Forest virus (SFV) glycoproteins in doubleinfected cells. Double-immunofluorescence staining showed that 90% of the cells became infected with both viruses. Almost the same final yield of infectious SFV was obtained from double-infected cells as from cells infected with SFV alone. The rate of transport from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) via the GC to the plasma membrane of the SFV glycoproteins was analysed by immunofluorescence, surface radioimmunoassay and pulse-chase labeling followed by immunoprecipitation, endoglycosidase H digestion and SDS-PAGE. The results showed that: (i) the SFV glycoproteins were readily transported to the cell surface in doubleinfected cells, whereas the UUK glycoproteins were retained in the GC; (ii) the transport to the PM was retarded by -20 min, due to a delay between the ER and the central Golgi; (iii) El of SFV appeared at the PM in a sialylated fonn. These results indicate that the morphologically altered GC had retained its functional integrity to glycosylate and transport plasma membrane glycoproteins.",

The terminal glycosylation step(s) also occurs slowly, -90-120 min after synthesis (Kuismanen, 1984) . In addition to the typical highmannose-and complex-type glycans, short endo H-resistant glycans, which probably are processing intermediates, are found in virions .",

At 37\u00b0C the transport from the ER to the GC takes place within 20-25 min (Green et al., 1981) followed by the appearance of the glycoproteins at the PM starting -30 min after their synthesis (Green et al., 1981; Kaariainen et al., 1980; Simons and Warren, 1983) . During transport, El acquires one complex glycan with terminal sialic acid, while the primary high-mannosetype glycans of E2 are trimmed by removal of glucose and 3-4 mannose residues (Kaariainen and Pesonen, 1982) .

(B) The same cells were treated with rabbit antiserum raised against the isolated SFV envelope glycoprotein complex (29S) followed by FITCconjugated swine anti-rabbit IgG. In addition to the staining of the perinuclear region a reticular fluorescence typical for the ER is seen.

Intracellular immunofluorescence staining with antibodies against UUK glycoproteins revealed that all cells had been infected productively and at least 80% of them displayed the typical perinuclear vacuolar staining of late UUK infection like that shown in Figure IA . As shown previously this staining pattern is due to a dilation and vacuolization of the GC Gahmberg et al., 1986) . At 20 h after UUK ts12 infection the cells were superinfected with wild-type SFV. Double immunofluorescence staining of the cells 4 h later revealed that both SFV and UUK glycoproteins were found in the same intracellular perinuclear vacuolar structures ( Figure IA and B). Also the cell surface was brightly stained with antibodies against SFV ( Figure IC ). Surface staining of double-infected cells with antibodies against UUK glycoproteins gave negligible fluorescence (not shown), similar to that seen in cells infected with UUK tsl2 alone, indicating that UUK glycoproteins were not co-transported with those of SFV.",

After 60 min incubation in the presence of the drug most of the fluorescence due to anti-SFV antibodies had disappeared ( Figure 3D ). Staining of the same cells with antibodies against UUK glycoproteins showed an expansion of the perinuclear fluorescence, prominent already after a 1 h treatment with cycloheximide ( Figure 3C and E). We conclude from this experiment that the SFV glycoproteins were transported further from the GC, whereas the UUK glycoproteins were effectively retained there. Kinetics of transport of SFV glycoproteins in cells infected with UUK tsJ2 and SFV ts] UUK tsl2-infected cells were superinfected at 25 h with a temperature-sensitive mutant tsl of SFV at 390C. At this temperature the SFV glycoproteins are synthesized normally but are arrested in the rough ER Saraste and Hedman, 1983) . When the cultures are transferred to 28\u00b0C (permissive temperature) in the presence of cycloheximide the SFV glycoproteins are transported in a synchronous manner through the GC to the plasma membrane Saraste and Kuismanen, 1984) . We have estimated that at least 50% of the pulse-labeled SFV glycoproteins synthesized before the shift to 28'C are transported to the plasma membrane (Pesonen et al., 1981) . At 3.5 h after superinfection with SFV tsl the cultures were shifted to 28\u00b0C in the presence of cycloheximide, and the amount of SFV glycoproteins at the cell surface was measured using a radioimmunoassay (RIA) devised earlier . Cells infected with SFV tsl alone and mock-infected cells served as controls (Figure 4 ). There was a delay of -15-30 min in the appearance of SFV glycoproteins at the surface of doubleinfected cells as compared with cells infected with tsl alone. Next we wanted to know whether the delay in the appearance of SFV glycoproteins at the cell surface in double-infected cells was due to a retardation during the early steps in the transport pathway. For this purpose we could take advantage of the fact that SFV El has a single complex glycan (Pesonen and Renkonen, 1976; Pesonen et al., 1981) . The acquisition of endoglycosidase H resistance was used to measure the transport time of El from the ER to the central Golgi (Lodish et al., 1981; Simons and Warren, 1983; in singleand doubleinfected cells. The cells were pulse-labeled with [35S]methionine for 10 min at 3.5 h after superinfection with SFV tsl or infection with tsl alone at 39\u00b0C. After the pulse the cultures were transferred to 28\u00b0C in the presence of cycloheximide as before, and chased in the presence of an excess of unlabeled methionine.",

To estimate the time for acquisition of endo H resistance for El, which was transported during the chase at 28\u00b0C, we had to deduct the proportion of non-transportable El. To analyse the transport of SFV glycoproteins in individual cells after a shift of the tsl -tsI2 double-infected cultures to 28\u00b0C we also used double immunofluorescence staining of the glycoproteins of UUK and SFV. Cycloheximide was added to the cultures 5 min prior to the shift to 28\u00b0C. At different times cultures infected with SFV tsl alone or double-infected, were withdrawn, permeabilized and treated with antibodies against UUK and SFV glycoproteins.

In the double-infected cultures the perinuclear fluorescence stained with anti-SFV antibodies was visible with certainty only in samples taken at 30 min or later after the shift to 28\u00b0C (Figure 6K and N) . This difference between the singleand double-infected cultures suggests that in UUK-infected cells the transport of SFV glycoproteins from the ER to the GC was retarded by -20 min. Terminal glycosylation of SFV El in double-infected cells UUK tsl2-infected cells were superinfected after 25 h with wildtype SFV at 39\u00b0C. At 4 h after SFV infection the cells were treated with periodate to oxidize sialic acid residues followed by reduction with tritiated borohydride (Gahmberg and Andersson, 1977) . The cells were lyzed and antibodies against El were used for immunoprecipitation. Cells infected with SFV alone served as controls. The immunoprecipitates were analysed by SDS -PAGE (Figure 7, lanes A and B) . El proteins from both singleand double-infected cells were labeled. Quantitation of the fluorogram was done by scanning. The intensity of the band from double-infected cells amounted to 82 % (Figure 7 , lane A) of that from the same number of single-infected cells ( Figure  7 , lane B) indicating that the terminal glycosylation was not severely affected by UUK infection. The amount of the protein moiety of El was also estimated in singleand double-infected cells using lactoperoxidase-catalyzed iodination (Hubbard and Cohn, 1972) . Quantitation of the bands showed that the amount of El protein labeled in double-infected cells was 75% of that in single-infected cells (Figure 7 , lanes C and D) (quantitation scans not shown). We conclude from these experiments that the SFV glycoproteins were transported to the cell surface in roughly equal amounts and were terminally glycosylated in a similar manner in singleand double-infected cells.",

This is unlikely since under our experimental conditions the UUK ts12 glycoproteins had already been transported to the GC during the 20-25 h period preceding superinfection with SFV. Preliminary experiments with pulselabeled collagen in UUK ts12-infected cells suggest that the secretion of collagen is retarded in the virus-infected cells as compared with uninfected cells (unpublished) .

For example Gl and G2 leaving the ciscisternae might be transported directly to the trans-cisternae. In this case no processing of the glycans could take place.
