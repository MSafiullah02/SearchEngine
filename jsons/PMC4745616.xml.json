Both serve as reminders that past and current efforts to enhance primary prevention efforts remain important in the interpandemic period.",

During the 2009 H1N1 pandemic, IOM in collaboration with the McGill University Ingram School of Nursing undertook a study to identify factors associated with a high level of knowledge about influenza among migrants in Thailand. The results from the study were used to develop public health recommendations aimed at increasing primary prevention of influenza. Thailand is an important point of focus in terms of global pandemic preparedness due to its role as the major transportation hub for Southeast Asia, the endemic presence of multiple types of influenza and its role as a receiving country for migrants. Certain groups of migrants in Thailand may be particularly vulnerable to pandemic influenza due to traditions in raising poultry and swine, poor personal hygiene and sanitation, low levels of health knowledge and awareness and limited access to health care (Ministry of Public Health, 2007; Sutic, 2007; Ahmed and Dibb, 2008; Jitthai, 2008). Furthermore, proximity to international borders may increase the likelihood of cross-border disease communication and occurrence of future pandemics (Haskew et al., 2010).",

Four respondents were excluded from analyses due to incomplete questionnaires. Sample size was determined starting with the assumption of a 50:50 chance that participants would have a high level of knowledge. Under this assumption and seeking to estimate the true proportion to within 5% (i.e. between 45 and 55%) with 95% confidence (i.e. \u03b1 error set at 0.05), we required 384 participants (Hosmer and Lemeshow, 2000). In order to be able to offer each of the provincial health authorities results relevant to their areas, we aimed to reach this number for each province. In order to guard against loss to analysis due to missing data, we chose to recruit 400 participants in each province. One additional participant was included in the study due to a record-keeping oversight. With data from 384 participants available for analyses and assuming 50% (n = 192) will have low knowledge levels, logistic models can reasonably be developed with 18 predictors (10 participants per predictor) in addition to the intercept. The number of predictors that could reasonably be accommodated by combining data from both provinces is more than double.",

Second, data collectors approached members of the selected households and requested a volunteer from each household to complete the survey. The decision to seek volunteers from each household was made after extensive consultation with IOM and MCHWs as the most ethically and culturally appropriate method in this context. Consideration was given to sampling the household heads, but it was felt that this would have resulted in a predominately male sample and put unintended pressure on this person to participate. Random selection of individuals was also considered, but it was likely that this method would have been culturally offensive to some groups. Data collectors attempted to recruit equal numbers of male and female migrants by requesting a female volunteer from the first household, a male from the second household, a female from the third and so forth. It was requested that volunteers be between the ages of 18 and 65 without any known psychological disability that would prevent them from completing the survey.",

Pandemic preparedness \u2018experts\u2019 currently working with IOM provided their feedback on the revised version and it was adjusted accordingly. Responses for each \u2018knowledge\u2019 question were assessed and a \u2018correct\u2019 answer for each was determined based on the current literature. The questionnaire was then translated from English into Thai using two independent translation services. Both translations were reviewed by one author (N.J.) and the superior version was blind back-translated (Brislin, 1970). The back-translation was compared with the original English version and necessary adjustments were made. MCHWs provided further feedback on the questionnaire during training sessions and suggested adjustments were made to ensure cultural appropriateness. The questionnaire was then piloted with non-study participants and revised one final time. Interpretation of the Thai questionnaire into the primary languages of the participants was rehearsed extensively during training to ensure accuracy and equivalency between MCHWs.",

Once predictors were entered into the model, a stepwise procedure was used to eliminate variables with minor contribution to the model (Lemeshow et al., 1990): variables were removed from the model one by one and excluded if the coefficients for the other variables changed <10% from their original value. If a coefficient(s) changed by >10% the variable was re-entered. This process was continued until no further variables could be removed from the model. Results were similar in the two provinces thus their combined results are presented here. All analyses were performed using EpiInfo\u2122 3.5.1.",

This difficulty was addressed by working with MCHWs to determine acceptable translations. In addition, data were collected at a single point in time. As such, we cannot infer causality between potential \u2018predictors\u2019 and knowledge. However, for some predictors, such as family income and Thai language fluency, it is difficult to imagine that a high level of knowledge would have been a cause as opposed to a result. Finally, we were forced to dichotomize the knowledge outcome variable, which may have introduced bias and led to a loss of power. However, this was the optimal approach available given that our data were not normally distributed.",
