The viral genome comprises two untranslated regions (UTRs) at the 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 ends (Boursnell et al., 1987, Ziebuhr et al., 2000), two overlapping open reading frames (ORFs) encoding the polyproteins 1a and 1ab, and regions encoding the main structural proteins \u2014 spike (S), envelope (E), membrane (M) and nucleocapsid (N) (Spaan et al., 1988, Sutou et al., 1988). In addition, two accessory genes, ORF3 and ORF5, expressing proteins 3a and 3b and 5a and 5b, respectively, have been described (Casais et al., 2005, Hodgson et al., 2006, Lai and Cavanagh, 1997). The S protein (~ 3462 nt), located in the surface of the viral membrane, is the major inducer of neutralizing antibodies (Cavanagh and Naqi, 1997, Winter et al., 2008) and is responsible for virus binding and entry to host cells (Cavanagh et al., 1986a, Koch et al., 1990, Niesters et al., 1987). It is post-translationally cleaved into the amino-terminal S1 (~ 535 amino acids) and the carboxyl-terminal S2 (~ 627 amino acids) subunits at a multi-basic cleavage site (Cavanagh et al., 1986b).",

Such variability may lead to important biological differences between strains and novel serotypic variants can emerge as the result of a limited number of amino acid changes in the spike protein. Nucleotide heterogeneity is most prevalent in the S1 portion of the S gene and largely contained within three different hypervariable regions (HVRs) (aa 38\u201367, 91\u2013141 and 274\u2013387) (Cavanagh et al., 1988, Moore et al., 1997). Accordingly, the analysis of the complete or partial S1 gene nucleotide sequence has been conventionally used to determine viral genetic types. Currently, more than 50 different antigenic and genetic types of IBV have been recognized, some with substantial economic impact on the livestock industry, and some others restricted to specific geographical areas (de Wit et al., 2011a, Jackwood, 2012).",

A variety of methods have been developed to differentiate IBV strains. Systems that examine the antigenic or genetic features of an isolate result in the description of serotypes and genotypes, respectively, whereas methods that are focused on the immune response of chickens against challenge with an IBV strain lead to the designation of protectotypes (Lohr, 1988). Importantly, however, the genotype-, serotype- or protectotype-based approaches do not always group IBVs in the same way. In the absence of fast and appropriate biological assays for IBV classification, analyses of S1 sequence data are the most widely used means to assign IBV strains to groups, arbitrarily and confusingly defined as genetic types, genotypes, clades or clusters.",

However, there is no agreement on the exact method by which sequences should be compared nor the criteria used to distinguish viral genetic types. This is in part due to the rapid appearance of novel variants and a lack of consistency and uniformity in the nomenclature of the IBV genetic groups. For example, several genotyping studies have been performed on IBV within a specific geographic area without considering a more global context (see below). As a consequence, different clade designations, such \u2018Korean New Cluster II\u2019 (Mase et al., 2010), \u2018JP-IV\u2019 (Lim et al., 2012) and \u2018Chinese New Type\u2019 (Li et al., 2013), have been assigned to describe closely related viruses. Further confusion arises because different regions of the S1 subunit have been used to infer phylogenetic trees, and which region is most informative is debated (Kingham et al., 2000, Lee et al., 2003, Li et al., 2012, Mo et al., 2013, Schikora et al., 2003, Wang and Huang, 2000).

Due to its variability and biological function, the S1 gene is the region commonly sequenced as an ideal target in molecular assays to type IBV strains. Accordingly, we focused on the complete S1 gene. Using all publicly available S1 gene sequence data, our goal was to determine the genetic structure of IBV and to propose a rational and standardized nomenclature of the IBV genetic groups identified here, referred to as lineages. In addition, we evaluated the ability of S1 fragments of different sizes to recapitulate the phylogeny and classification obtained from full-length S1 sequences.",

To confirm the occurrence of recombination smaller sequence data sets comprising the suspected recombinant and the putative parental strains were analyzed using the RDP, Geneconv, Maxchi, BootScan, 3Seq and Chimaera methods available in the RDP package v.4 (Martin et al., 2010), applying default settings. The Simplot program v.3.5 was also used to define the locations of recombination break-points (Lole et al., 1999). We considered \u201ctrue recombinants\u201d to be those sequences identified by at least two methods (P\n < 1 \u00d7 10\u2212 10) and confirmed by significant phylogenetic incongruence among trees estimated on either side of the putative recombination break-points. All sequences with a history of recombination determined in this manner were removed from the original 1518 sequence data set used to identify \u2018pure\u2019 IBV lineages, but described as recombinant IBV forms (see Results). In addition, a number of sequences were considered to be unreliable due to a lack of congruence between the strain description in the associated publication and the corresponding nucleotide sequences. This quality control step resulted in a final data set of 1286 full-length S1 sequences, which was used to determine the phylogenetic relationships among IBV strains and to classify them into well-established lineages.",

Specifically, all the GI-19 S1 gene full-length sequences collected before the administration of the homologous vaccine in the field (n = 354) were selected.

Prior to phylogenetic analysis, all hypervariable and potentially poorly aligned regions were removed using Gblocks (Castresana, 2000). For this analysis, a less stringent procedure, allowing for gap positions within final blocks, was employed. In addition, the best-fit model of nucleotide substitution was inferred using JModeltest v.2.1.4 (Darriba et al., 2012). Accordingly, the General Time Reversible (GTR) model with a discrete gamma distribution (\u0393) and allowing for invariant sites (I) was selected in all data analyses based on AICc. Nodal supports in the PhyML analyses were assessed using Shimodaira\u2013Hasegawa (SH)-like branch supports (Anisimova and Gascuel, 2006, Guindon et al., 2010). To further assess the robustness of the phylogenetic tree, additional analyses of the small S1 gene sequence data set were performed using the Bayesian approach within MrBayes v.3.2 (Huelsenbeck and Ronquist, 2001), and the Neighbor-Joining method available in MEGA6 (Tamura et al., 2013). In both these cases we employed the GTR + I + \u0393 substitution model, with nodal support values obtained by posterior probabilities and 1000 bootstrap replicates, respectively. Topological congruence between trees was compared through visual inspection for (i) ML trees obtained for the complete (n = 1286) and the small data sets (n = 199), (ii) the ML trees estimated for the full-length S1 sequences (\u223c 1620 nt) and those corresponding to the HVRs1 and 2 (312 nt) and HVR3 (342 nt) regions, and (iii) the ML, NJ and Bayesian trees all run on the small data set.",

Accordingly, 32 IBV lineages, each of which was defined by strongly supported nodes (> 0.98 SH-like test support values), were identified using our expansive S1 gene phylogeny. The designation of \u201clineage\u201d was arbitrarily assigned to monophyletic groups of at least three viruses sampled from at least two different outbreaks. Strains that do not cluster into any lineages according to these subjective criteria are labeled as unique variant (UV) in the phylogenetic tree (n = 26).

The first known strain of CR88 serotype was isolated in France in 1985 (Picault et al., 1995), whereas the 793B strain emerged in the United Kingdom in 1991 and was originally described as a unique serotype responsible for severe respiratory syndromes (Callison et al., 2001, Cook et al., 1996). A retrospective study revealed a 96% sequence similarity between a strain isolated in Morocco in 1983, which is here referred to as the GI-13 lineage prototype strain, and the 793B variant, suggesting that this North African virus is the progenitor of the lineage (Jones et al., 2004).

The GI-19 variant, the so-called QXIBV strain, was first detected in China in 1996 where it was associated predominantly with severe nephritis, \u2018false layer\u2019 syndrome and potentially proventriculitis (Wang et al., 1998). Since then, several QX-type strains have been identified in China, although most cases have been associated with renal pathology (Liu et al., 2006b). In Europe, numerous reports described QX-like strains following the Chinese index case (Abro et al., 2011, Beato et al., 2005, de Wit et al., 2011b, Gough et al., 2008, Monne et al., 2008, Valastro et al., 2010, Worthington et al., 2008). At the same time, the first QX-like strains were identified in Japan (Ariyoshi et al., 2010, Mase et al., 2004) and Korea (Lee et al., 2008). Thereafter, it was soon reported in such diverse localities as Russia, Africa and the Middle East (Amin et al., 2012, Bochkov et al., 2006, Toffan et al., 2011). Thus, all strains falling in the GI-19 lineage have been previously assigned to the QX clade, also called LX4 (Han et al., 2011, Li et al., 2013, Liu et al., 2009) and A2 (Ji et al., 2011, Li et al., 2010). Confusingly, the same genetic group has also been referred to as Korean-II (K-II) (Lee et al., 2008) and Japanese-III (JP-III) clusters (Ariyoshi et al., 2010, Mase et al., 2004). Of note, a recently submitted sequence (KC577395) shows that the lineage had arisen in China by 1993.",

The designation of Korean III genotype (K-III) was also used to describe Korean strains clustering with Chinese viruses of LDL-like type. Notably, the classification into K-III was performed using phylogenetic analyses of partial S1 gene sequences (620\u2013642 nt) (Lee et al., 2008), and to our knowledge no complete S1 nucleotide sequences of this genetic group are currently available. The GI-16 lineage has been associated with respiratory syndrome (Ababneh et al., 2012, Yu et al., 2001), severe drops in egg production (de Wit et al., 2012) and nephropathogenic disease (Huang et al., 2004, Toffan et al., 2013). Although it is known to have a more widespread geographic distribution, we only include sequences from three countries. After the first isolation of the Q1 strain in China between 1996 and 1998 (Yu et al., 2001), the lineage was reported in Taiwan in 2002 (Huang et al., 2004), in South America since 2009 (Marandino et al., 2015, Sesti et al., 2014), in some Middle Eastern countries (Ababneh et al., 2012) and in Italy (Toffan et al., 2013) in 2011, and in Colombia in 2012 (Jackwood, 2012). Of note, our phylogenetic analysis reveals that the GI-16 prototype strain is an Italian virus \u2013 IZO28/86 \u2013 isolated in 1986, approximately 10 years before the first identification of the Q1 strain in China.",

GI-24 includes, among others, the prototype CA/1737/04 strain (Jackwood et al., 2007) along with the DMV/5642/06 (Wood et al., 2009) and GA/60,173/07 (Jackwood et al., 2007) variants. The GI-27 lineage contains the most recent IBV defining a lineage, being first identified in 2007. The variant, which became the predominant virus type at that time, was reported to be a novel genotype and designated as GA08 (Jackwood et al., 2010, Kulkarni and Resurreccion, 2010).",

This group contains both vaccine and field strains (n = 24) isolated between 1992 and 2003. Among these is the variant referred to as Delaware variant (DE or DE072), isolated in 1992 from commercial broiler chicks during severe respiratory disease and designated to be of a novel genotype and serotype compared to the others (Gelb et al., 1997, Mondal et al., 2001). In the same lineage are IBV strains previously designated as GA98 and described to be closely related to the DE variant, although of a different serotype (Lee et al., 2001). It has been suggested that the GA98 variant arose from immune selection caused by DE072 attenuated live vaccine introduced in the country in 1993 (Lee and Jackwood, 2001). In addition, viruses recovered in 2000 from layer flocks experiencing reduction in egg production also fell into this lineage (Mondal et al., 2001).",

            "text": "The GI-2, GI-3 and GI-4 lineages were first described in the USA between the 1950s and the 1960s and later detected in Asia many years later. Notably, however, GI-2 and GI-4 were reported in USA only during the 1950s\u20131960s and never again, while GI-3 was also reported in North America in the late 1990s (Gelb et al., 2005, Gelb et al., 2001) before being identified in Taiwan in 2006. Hence, old lineages may be sporadically re-detected. A total of 5 viruses cluster within the GI-3 lineage, which, among others, includes the serotypes known as Holte and Iowa 97 (Albassam et al., 1986, Hofstad, 1958) and two viruses sampled in China between 2004 and 2006 (Bing et al., 2007). The GI-4 lineage consists of 1 nephropathogenic strain, isolated in USA in 1962 (Winterfield and Hitchner, 1962), whose S1 gene was entirely sequenced in 1994 (accession number L18988; Wang et al., 1994) and two additional viruses collected in China for which no published data are currently available. Of note, the same IB strain nomenclature has been used to identify two viruses genetically distant between each other and belonging to two different lineages. Hence, both the GI-2 and GI-4 lineages include a virus called \u2018Holte\u2019 as prototype strain. The GI-3 lineage contains 7 viruses, comprising both respiratory and nephropathogenic strains. It was originally designated as JMK or the Gray serotype because of the appropriate reference strains (accession numbers L14070 and L14069, respectively). Although these two viruses are antigenically very similar (Cowen and Hitchner, 1975), their pathogenicity is different because the Gray variant can be nephropathogenic while the JMK virus is strictly respirotropic (Kwon and Jackwood, 1995, Thor et al., 2011, Winterfield et al., 1964, Winterfield and Hitchner, 1962).",

            "text": "The GI-11 lineage is unique to South America and comprises a total of 13 Brazilian viruses collected between 1975 and 2009. However, novel IBV sequences, which were obtained from field samples from Argentina and Uruguay, have been recently submitted to GenBank (Marandino et al., 2015). By phylogenetic analysis of the complete S1 coding region, the authors included these strains in a genotype referred to as South America I (SAI), which also contains the GI-11 Brazilian viruses. A previous nomenclature based on partial S1 nucleotide sequences of local Brazilian field variants has been also adopted (Balestrin et al., 2014, Chac\u00f3n et al., 2011, Fraga et al., 2013, Villarreal et al., 2010), and referred to as the Brazil (Villarreal et al., 2010) or BR-I (Chac\u00f3n et al., 2011) genotypes. The partial Brazilian sequences show a high degree of nucleotide similarity with those of GI-11 (98\u201392%), such that it is unclear whether they represent the same genetic type. The GI-11 lineage has been associated with a variety of clinical conditions, ranging from respiratory disease, infertility, drop in egg production and egg quality (Chac\u00f3n et al., 2011, Chac\u00f3n et al., 2008, Montassier, 2010, Villarreal et al., 2007a) to enteric disorders (Villarreal et al., 2010, Villarreal et al., 2007b). It was recently demonstrated that the Brazilian variant causes predominantly respiratory and kidney diseases under experimental conditions (Chac\u00f3n et al., 2014: de Wit et al., 2015). Interestingly, our phylogenetic analysis demonstrates that the indigenous GI-11 lineage has been circulating in the country since 1975, supporting the hypothesis of Montassier (2010) that this variant had already been present in the field since at least as early as 1988.",

Within the GI-21 lineage we group 14 viruses sampled between 1997 and 2005 in Italy, the United Kingdom and Spain. The IB viral type of the lineage was originally isolated in Italy in 1999 and designated Italy02 (Bochkov et al., 2007). Thereafter, it was reported to be one of the most predominant genotypes in Spain (Dolz et al., 2009) and the third most frequent in Western Europe over 2002\u20132006 (Worthington et al., 2008). This variant has mainly been detected in broiler flocks that experienced respiratory signs, as well as adult birds, broiler breeders and layers, associated with drop in egg production (Worthington et al., 2004). It also appeared to induce renal disease in young chickens (Dolz et al., 2012). Although strains in this lineage are related to one of the major and widespread European wild types, a limited number of complete S1 nucleotide sequences are available for analysis.",

The lineage is comprised of only the Dutch isolates D1466 and V1397, showing a large evolutionary distance compared to the remaining IBV genotypes. The D1466 variant (also called D212) was detected for the first time in The Netherlands in the late 1970s, when it was recognized to have antigenic and molecular properties significantly different from known IBV strains (Adzhar et al., 1995, Davelaar et al., 1984, Kusters et al., 1989, Kusters et al., 1987). Historically, D1466 has never been responsible for major disease in flocks and hence may be of relatively low pathogenicity. However, an increase in virulence of this variant was recently observed. In particular, poor egg production in both layers and broiler breeders was reported between 2005 and 2006 in some countries of Western Europe (Worthington et al., 2008) and more recently in Poland (Domanska-Blicharz et al., 2012).",

Alternatively, studies performed on the Egyptian isolates divided them into different genotypes on the basis of their HVR3 sequences; they were defined as Egyptian Variant 1, having as reference the strain Egypt/Beni-Suef/01 (Abdel-Moneim et al., 2002) and Egyptian Variant 2, which includes the viruses ck/Eg/BSU-2/2011 and ck/Eg/BSU-3/2011(Abdel-Moneim et al., 2012).

Strikingly, important topological inconsistencies were observed between the HVRs1 and 2 phylogeny and that inferred using the complete S1 gene. Specifically, although GIII, V and VI exhibit large evolutionary distances compared to the remaining lineages, they cluster within GI in marked contrast to what is seen in the complete S1 tree, while 4 lineages \u2013 GI-7, -14, -23, and -27 \u2013 do not form monophyletic groups (Fig. 3\n). In addition, while most groups were strongly supported in the SH test (> 0.96 SH-like), others were more weakly supported, such as GI-15 which only received 0.60 support, and GI-6 and GI-9, both of which received 0.80 SH-like support. Genetic typing based on HVR3 was similarly inconsistent with that obtained from the whole S1 gene (Fig. 4\n). In particular, 8 lineages (GI-5, -7, -10, -18, -22, -24, -25 and -27) are no longer monophyletic. Overall, these results indicate that both the genotypes and lineages identified using the HVRs are not representative of those obtained from the phylogenetic analysis of the whole S1 gene, so that only the latter should be used in IBV genetic classification.",

The International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV) has no guidelines for the classification of viruses below the species level. However, classification systems have been developed and widely used for a variety of avian pathogens, including Avian influenza (AI) (WHO/OIE/FAO H5N1 Evolution working group) and Newcastle disease (ND) viruses (Aldous et al., 2003, de Almeida et al., 2013), within which distinct \u201clineages\u201d have been established through phylogenetic analysis and sequence similarities. Herein, we propose a similar framework for IBV. To date, no genetic characterization of IBV has included sequences from all the existing viral variants or adopted a unified system for naming the groups, such that no consensus on IBV classification has been reached. Indeed, the diversity of IBV genetic clustering and naming available at present is highly confusing. Hence, we have attempted to construct a comprehensive phylogenetic history of this virus and from this to derive a rational and harmonious scheme for the classification of IBV that we suggest should be used for future epidemiological and evolutionary studies.",

            "text": "A more challenging issue is recombination, which undoubtedly has major implications for virus classification (Simmonds, 2015). Importantly, however, viral phylogenies based on a single gene (as here) have been previously used to establish viable classification schemes. Notable examples include members of genus Enterovirus (Mirand et al., 2006, Oberste et al., 1999), pestiviruses such as BVDV-1 (Deng et al., 2012, Vilcek et al., 2001) and BVDV-2 (Flores et al., 2002, Jenckel et al., 2014, Weber et al., 2015), circoviruses such as PCV2 (Franzo et al., 2015, Grau-Roma et al., 2008, Segal\u00e9s et al., 2008), and lentiviruses such as FIV (Mar\u00e7ola et al., 2013, Sodora et al., 1994). In the case of IBV we propose that an effective classification scheme, particularly the designation of lineages and genotypes, should be based on clearly identifiable genetic groups (i.e. with recombinants removed) as these represent a robust phylogenetic backbone. A similar approach has been undertaken for PCV2 (Franzo et al., 2015). Hence, we contend that this is the most coherent and practical way for virus classification in the face of recombination, particularly as it is impractical to integrate multiple incongruent phylogenies and simplistic to think that such complex evolutionary histories will produce more rational classifications. Rather than being defined as unique variants in their own right, recombinants can then be referred to as combinations of these distinct lineages and genotypes, analogous to the definition of \u2018circulating recombinant forms\u2019 among HIV subtypes. However, it is evident that more experimental studies are needed to assess how recombination might impact viral fitness. In this respect, the relatively high number of recombinant viruses in our data (n = 213) is in part due to the presence of strains showing an identical recombinant structure and possessing a strong epidemiological link between each other. Hence, these should not be regarded as result of independent recombination events.",

Accordingly, a total of 6 genotypes (GI-GVI) and 32 lineages were identified, with other potential groups present as unique variants (UVs) and which may become established should future viruses be sequenced. Some well-established lineages such as GI-1 and -13 have a broad geographic distribution, which is presumably associated with the use of vaccines derived from them. Therefore, the majority of the IBV strains included in these lineages might be vaccine and vaccine-like strains. The first vaccine to control the disease was developed in the USA in the 1950s using the van Roeckel M-41 strain (van Roeckel et al., 1942) that represents the parent strain of most of the Mass type vaccines used there. By the early 1960s IB had been diagnosed in The Netherlands, leading to the development of a Mass-based vaccine known as the H strain (Bijlenga et al., 2004). The resulting vaccines, H120 and H52, soon became widely used. Today, the Mass and H120 strains of the lineage GI-1 continue to be the most commonly administrated attenuated-live vaccines. In contrast to the GI-1 vaccine strains, the 793B-like vaccines (GI-13), which were developed in Europe in the 1990s and used in many countries, have been never administered in North America. To date, the GI-13 lineage has not been detected in the USA, Oceania and many African and Latin American countries.",

In particular, with the exception of strains of the GI-1 lineage, IBVs in Europe differ from those found in the USA or Australia, and each geographic group can be distinguished at the phylogenetic scale. That most of the strains in the GI-9 lineage come from the USA might suggest that the pathogenic Ark variant is geographically confined to that country. However, there are unpublished reports recording the circulation of Ark-like strains in South America (Jackwood, 2012, Marandino et al., 2015). The Ark virus is one of the most commonly reported types able to cause widespread disease in the USA, against which an attenuated vaccine was developed. When it first emerged in Arkansas in 1973, it was described as genetically distinct from all the known IBV serotypes recognized at that time and was referred to as Ark99 (Fields, 1973, Johnson et al., 1973). During the 1980s, an attenuated vaccine derived from an Ark-type virus isolated in the Delmarva Peninsula (Ark DPI strain) (Gelb et al., 1983, Gelb et al., 1981) was extensively used in the USA and remains one of the most common vaccines administered to flocks in this country and also in the United Kingdom. In this respect, a previous epidemiological survey reported the identification of GI-9-like strains in Western Europe only in flocks that had received the commercial bivalent IBMM + Ark vaccine (Worthington et al., 2008). However, no European IBV sequences similar to the GI-9 lineage are available in the public database. A similar situation arises with the Chinese IBVs in GI-9 (n = 5). Among these, the Jilin strain (AY839144), which was previously reported to be 100% identical to the Ark DPI strain (Ammayappan et al., 2008), is currently used as vaccine in China (Liu et al., 2006a). This suggests that the Chinese IBVs present in this lineage most likely represent re-isolations of the vaccine strain and not of the Ark field type.",

This Chinese lineage has generated considerable attention due to its ability to become endemic, causing major economic losses in the poultry industry worldwide, with the exception of the Americas and Oceania where it has been never detected. The origin of this lineage and the factors responsible of its distinctive distribution remain unclear (Bochkov et al., 2006, Gough et al., 2008).

            "text": "Importantly, the present study seems to counter the common assumption that the GI-16 lineage arose in China in 1996. In particular, our analysis provides evidence that the Italian IZO28/86 strain, isolated in 1986, belongs to GI-16 such that it constitutes the lineage prototype strain. This nephropathogenic virus was originally sampled in Italy about 10 years before the first identification of the Q1 strain in China, and its sequence has been only recently submitted to the public database. Additionally, the IZO28/86 sequence is closely related to strain 624/I (JQ901492), suggesting that they belong to the same lineage, which also includes the Q1-like strains. However, they have previously been classified as distinct genotypes. The 624/I virus was first reported as novel variant in Italy in 1993 (Capua et al., 1994) during an outbreak of severe respiratory disease, although only a 350 nt region of S1 was sequenced (Capua et al., 1999). Thereafter, it has been sporadically detected in Italy, in Russia (Bochkov et al., 2006) and Slovenia (Krapez et al., 2011). More recently a longer nucleotide 624/I sequence (1043 nt in length) has been released (JQ901492), which clusters into the same monophyletic group. Based on these observations, it is plausible that both variants belong to the GI-16, unless recombination has occurred in the C-terminal portion of the 624/I S1 sequence.",

            "text": "In the last two decades, a combination of phylogenetic clustering and patterns of sequence similarity in the S1 gene have been conventionally used to group IBV isolates into genetic clades, although a confusing variety of such clustering schemes currently exist. For instance, IBVs have been referred to as novel variants when their S1 nucleotide sequences are at least \u2264 75% dissimilar from that of any other IBV type (Gelb et al., 2005, Kingham et al., 2000). However, because of rate variation between sequences, reflected here in the lack of temporal structure in the data, distance-based classification methods are susceptible to error. In particular, elevated evolutionary rates leading to individual clusters may result in high genetic distances between sister taxa even though they are closely related. Thus, we suggest that phylogenetic relationships are a more appropriate measure of evolutionary history and hence the basis of a rationale classification than pairwise comparison of sequences. In addition, it is unrealistic to think that nature will create discrete groups of sequences that can consistently be recovered using genetic distances.",

Some investigators have reported that the genetic typing based on HVR1 of the S1 gene is inconsistent with the groupings based on the whole S1 gene (Li et al., 2012, Mo et al., 2013, Schikora et al., 2003), although others disagree (Lee et al., 2003, Wang and Huang, 2000). We clearly show here that the hypervariable fragments (HVRs1 and 2 and HVR3) do not consistently produce clusters that are equivalent to those found through phylogenetic analyses of the S1 phylogeny. Therefore, the risk of misclassification decreases by using a larger portion of the S1 gene, and the sequencing of only one of these regions might result in insufficient phylogenetic resolution. Hence, we strongly recommend a phylogeny that considers the complete S1 gene sequence be employed for future designations of novel IBV lineages or genotypes.",

As heterogeneous genetic group designations, which are inconsistent with phylogenetic classification, have largely been used to the present day, it is essential to employ a standard nomenclature of practical use and a well-supported system to identify these novel variants. Herein, we propose a simple and repeatable S1 phylogeny-based classification system combined with an unambiguous lineage nomenclature for the future assignment of IBV strains. Following the suggestions here proposed, at least three complete S1 sequences of viral samples collected at least from two different outbreaks should be available for the identification of a new viral lineage, and genotypes and lineages should be referred to according to the current numerical system. In addition, and in similar manner to the convention in AIV, we encourage the use of a uniform and informative system for naming IBV isolates, which at least should include the name of the strain, country of origin and date of collection (Cavanagh, 2001). Clearly, the adoption of an internationally accepted nomenclature and a common system to coherently designate viruses is central for efficient communication on the evolution and emergence of epidemiologically important IBV variants.",
