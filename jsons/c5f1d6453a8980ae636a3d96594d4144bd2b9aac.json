Tribal divisions often make very difficult the development of national states to which all the population can be loyal. In nearly all cases, decolonization has left a legacy of division between the tribes of different areas. Often the tribal situation is complex but in some cases the divisions are only too obvious. In some cases this has boiled over into genocide, as with the Tutsis and Huttus of Rwanda. In the Sudan there is a continuing civil war between the Christians of the south and the Muslims of the north. Elsewhere divisions have burst out into civil war, as in Biafra in Nigeria back in the 1960s, but now smoulder below the surface. The list of countries suffering from civil war is endless: Nigeria, Ethiopia, Somalia, the Sudan, Angola, Mozambique, Liberia, the Congo, Sierra Leone and the Ivory Coast.

Extreme events can have a dramatic effect on performance indicators such as profit. There is always the chance of an extreme event occurring which would take down even the best prepared organizations. They come with a varying degree of probability, in some cases with a complete uncertainty. Some projects offer the prospect of huge losses, if they fail.

The frequent overshooting and undershooting of demand relative to supply means that prices rise and fall in cumulative movements.

The most common are ratings of creditworthiness. Moody's, Standard & Poor's and Fitches use letter systems to assess the creditworthiness of both companies and governments. The listing runs typically from the lowest risk AAA rating to the highest risk rating D. The key dividing line is between investment grade and that deemed less than investment grade. The downgrading of a company or country to a non-investment grade not only increases the cost of capital for the recipient, but often has seriously negative effects on share prices. All countries are assessed for their sovereign credit rating, that is, the likelihood that the government will be able to continue to service its bond or bill issues. All large companies are rated for their corporate risk. Powell (2002) noted, Japan's main social problem is to prevent her best baseball players from defecting to the USA. How does this compare with an HIV infection rate of above 38%? Certainly Botswana has some mineral riches, notably diamonds. But why is the comparative rating at the level it is?

This project was associated with a plan for Enron to become a major player in the distribution of liquefied natural gas in India and to be one of the major consumers of that gas. The gas was to come from a project in the Gulf state of Qatar, partially financed by Enron's parent company. The power project was very large, involving a US$2 billion contract with the state government, up to that date the largest single foreign investment in India and the largest independent power project in the world.",

The political ploy, based on anti-outsider nationalism, was highly successful in winning the attention and support of the electorate; the opposition won the election and immediately instituted an inquiry into the project by a government committee. The report of the committee was never published but its findings of deception and cost padding were leaked. In response to the cost padding, Rebecca Mark, who was CEO of Enron International and responsible for the original negotiations, argued: 'In India you are supposed to have a 20 percent import duty on equipment. But when it comes right down to it, very common in a project is that it doesn't end up being 20 percent but whatever the customs inspector wants it to be on the day you get there.

This requires putting together, in the general market for risk, offsetting risks, whether directly or through a specialist enterprise or specialized financial instrument. It assumes that risk exists for different individuals or enterprises in ways which can be set against each other, that is, in ways which are compensating. For example, the original development of a futures market for pigs was based on the different needs of farmers and butchers. The supply of pigs reflected weather conditions in any given year. The farmers feared a glut and the resulting fall in price which would reduce their income. They wanted to ensure that the price at which they sold in a year's time was not too low. The butchers feared a dearth and the resulting rise in price which would reduce demand for their product and hence their income. They did not want the price to rise. A futures or forward market allowed them to hedge their risk by entering into a transaction which managed risks for both parties to the transaction. What is risk for one party is opportunity for another; in this case a low price for farmers and a high price for butchers. The key is to find a way of bringing the parties together, either in a market transaction or another type of arrangement. Specialist institutions, because of the high volume of their transactions, can provide the service at a low level of transaction costs. Alternatively the enterprise can put together its own hedges, thereby lowering cost.",

Where the commitment of resources is such that a failure will threaten the very existence of the enterprise, alliances are highly desirable. They represent a way of redistributing the risk, but the cost is obviously the simultaneous redistribution of some of the return.

Scenario building is the technique which should be used. Most commentators, including the country risk rating agencies, have a poor record in predicting such sudden turns of fortune. Where strategy making is based on scenario building, it is sometimes called scenario planning. Scenario building becomes an integral part of the strategy-making process itself. It is highly desirable to develop both in combination. However, country risk encapsulates a set of factors which have a powerful influence on patterns of direct investment, acting as a major deterrent where the level of country risk is high. It is a critical aspect of the home country bias discussed in Chapter 3. Once attention is directed to a direct investment in productive facilities which has been made for the medium or long term, the focus also necessarily moves away from strictly economic or financial factors to emphasize political factors.",

The epidemic is already imposing a cost on every ounce of gold or platinum produced. Anglo Gold estimates the additional cost to be $6 on a total cost of about $170-180, Anglo American platinum $3. All companies suffer from the costs indicated above. A study of six companies operating in South Africa and Botswana (Rosen et al. 2003) , showed annual direct costs ranging from 0.4% to 5.9% of the wage bill, with between 7.9% and 29% of workers infected. Previously the companies simply bore the cost, which might take the form of the employment of two workers where one is needed, on the expectation that one will become sick. Until recently the most that was done was to assist in a programme of education and encouragement to use condoms. Now it is thought that the cost of drugs has fallen sufficiently to justify the expenditure. Not all infected workers take up the offer. Most companies think that the cost of treatment and education is cheaper than the cost of doing nothing, that is, not treating the disease. Even properly discounting the future, the costs of infection prevention and treatment provision are less than the savings which can be made in future costs. This applies to those already operating. For potential newcomers there is an additional cost, higher where the incidence of the disease is higher. Avoidance of high incidence areas is still an option for potential investors. The example of Botswana can act as a model for the rest of Africa. As the head of the Gates and Merck Foundation, Dr Donald de Korte, formerly head of Merck in South Africa, has said: 'If you're looking for a self-interested motive, it is that if this model works, it will be repeated throughout Africa and increase the pharmaceuticals' markets.' If it does not work in Botswana, it cannot work elsewhere.",

The South African government encouraged both parallel importation of cheap drugs and an abuse of patents with generic production of the drugs within South Africa. The drug companies took them to court. The reputation of the pharmaceutical companies became a real issue, which persuaded them to capitulate. Elsewhere in Africa, for the enormous effort required in coping with the disease to be effective, it must combine the commercial with the humanitarian. The model which might work for a small country like Botswana, that is, small in population, will not work in the more populous countries like Nigeria, Kenya or South Africa.",

In terms of relative numbers there is likely to be a similar impact, certainly in the region of the southern cone, but the impact of AIDS will be packed into a much shorter time period. Like AIDS, slavery took those predominantly in the age group which provided the bulk of the labour force and the ability of the community to reproduce. The Botswana Institute of Development Analysis has estimated that AIDS could reduce growth rates in several African countries by amounts ranging from 0.5% to 2.6%, an impact which is doubly significant since the growth rate for most African countries is already low.",

The influenza epidemic after World War I also took about 20 million people, with less overall impact than the Black Death, but a reinforcement of the negative shock of World War I. It is possible to trace the effects of these events and build possible scenarios of what will happen in Africa. AIDS is by no means the last epidemic disease to strike; the advent of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) has shown that. Epidemic disease has also been a problem for livestock. Fast-mutating fungal and other plant diseases become resistant to treatment and further treatments need to be developed. There are other societies at risk from AIDS. What is happening in Africa is only the tip of an iceberg which might prove to be very large indeed.",
