Since the terrorist attack of 2001, focus on securing food supply chain has intensified as governments and industries are constantly reviewing the security programs and procedures to ensure food safety in case of any \u2018intentional\u2019 disruption, such as sabotage or deliberate contamination.[2, 3] A critical vulnerability in relying on these measures to trace back intentional disruptions is the difficulty in traceability of the place and source of initial contamination.[4\u20136] The food supply chain is complicated by its multiple transfers of ingredients, raw materials, and finished products from farms, processors, distributors, and retailers making every point a potential terrorist opportunity.[6, 7] To complicate it further, high employee turnover and ease of facility access (such as maintenance and sanitation crews) allows potential terrorists to enter with limited suspicion.[6, 8] There are many types of other risks the food industry must consider in securing the food chain. Risks to company and product reputation, consumer safety, disruption of operations (due to lack of raw materials, water, electricity, etc.), and personnel must all be realized [8].",

There are direct costs associated with the public health impact from the outbreak, such as treatment for the sick and a cost estimate for the loss of life (based on the estimated insurance benefits per life). There are indirect costs, such as the loss of productivity and gross community product due to an unusual number of employee absenteeism.[19] The cost of intervention strategies executed, such as setting up PODS for vaccinating the population, is also included. Finally, the loss of public confidence, as computed by the public opinion model, may result in an economic loss, such as when the stock market swung during the recent economic turmoil.

No one entity has the whole picture, requiring all participants in the food supply chain to proactively share the piece of information they have access to in order to collectively address cases of intentional contamination.The media plays an important role as a source of information. Taking a reactive role in a time of crisis lead to more uncertainty as consumers may succumb to panic.The proper responses, prevention, control, and thought processes for dealing with intentional contamination differ from addressing issues due to inherent contamination.Given the vulnerability and impact of disruptions to the food supply chain, procedures should be put in place for new hires including in-depth background checks, character evaluations, and performance surveys.
