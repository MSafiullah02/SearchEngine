Understanding of neuroprotective barriers has since evolved to incorporate the neurovascular unit (NVU), the blood-cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) barrier, and the presence of CNS lymphatics that allow leukocyte egress. Identification of the cellular and molecular participants in BBB function at the NVU has allowed detailed analyses of mechanisms that contribute to BBB dysfunction in various disease states, which include both autoimmune and infectious etiologies.

Since then, physicians and scientists have appreciated the unique diffusion barrier between the blood and the brain and its stringent regulation of central nervous system (CNS) entry of molecules, immune cells, and pathogens [2] [3] [4] . The BBB occurs at the level of postcapillary venules and capillaries and is comprised of a variety of physical specializations including inter-endothelial tight and adherens junctions (TJ and AJ), endothelial cells with polarized expression of protein receptor influx and efflux transporters, and transcytosis systems limited to albumen and histones [5] . Vasculature at the BBB is enveloped by pericytes and astrocyte end feet, which leads to the development of dual basement membranes with a complicated extracellular matrix (ECM) separating blood contents from perivascular spaces within the CNS parenchyma. The CNS ECM is comprised of hyaluronic acid and proteoglycans (PG), mainly chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans (CSPG) [6] . Heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPG), especially the negatively charged heparan sulfate (HS), bind and sequester pro-inflammatory molecules, including the endothelial cell-derived chemokine CXCL12 ( [7] and see below), which regulates the recruitment and effector functions of leukocytes that infiltrate the CNS during neuroinflammatory diseases [8] . BBB TJ are heterodimeric proteins comprised of occludin and members of the claudin family of proteins, including claudin-3 or -5, that link to the cytoskeleton via the scaffolding and regulatory proteins ZO-1, -2, -3, and cingulin (reviewed in [9] ). Similarly, AJ are comprised of E-cadherin proteins that link to actin filaments via \u03b1-, \u03b2-, and \u03b3-catenin. The length of actin fibers, which are regulated by the activation of RhoGTPases, controls the integrity of both AJ and TJ complexes [10] . Activation of Rac1 promotes stabilization of TJ and AJ, while RhoA promotes destabilization. Junctional integrity is critical for two separate capacities of the BBB, termed \"gate\" and \"fence\" function [11] . Gate function refers to the importance of inter-endothelial junctional complexes in limiting the movement of molecules and cells from the blood to the brain parenchyma. RhoA activation may therefore reduce gate function and allow BBB penetration without loss of junctional proteins. Fence function refers to the role of TJ and AJ in the maintenance of BBB polarity, preventing the rotation and diffusion of proteins and other biomolecules within the cell membrane between abluminal and luminal surfaces. Thus, BBB permeability can also be increased without complete destruction of junctional proteins through alterations in the locations of proteins involved in transport or transcytosis.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 295, "end": 298, "text": "[1]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 526, "end": 529, "text": "[2]", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}, {"start": 530, "end": 533, "text": "[3]", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 534, "end": 537, "text": "[4]", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 890, "end": 893, "text": "[5]", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}, {"start": 1267, "end": 1270, "text": "[6]", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}, {"start": 1472, "end": 1475, "text": "[7]", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}, {"start": 1619, "end": 1622, "text": "[8]", "ref_id": "BIBREF8"}, {"start": 1869, "end": 1872, "text": "[9]", "ref_id": "BIBREF9"}, {"start": 2115, "end": 2119, "text": "[10]", "ref_id": "BIBREF11"}, {"start": 2323, "end": 2327, "text": "[11]", "ref_id": "BIBREF12"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Introduction to BBB Structure and Function"}, {"text": "The transcellular transport of macromolecules across endothelial barriers occurs in peripheral organs via a variety of pathways including macropinocytosis and clathrin-and caveolae-mediated endocytosis. The BBB, however, exhibits low levels of macropinocytosis and lack of clathrin expression. Caveolae-mediated transcytosis is strictly regulated at the BBB by the major facilitator superfamily domain-containing protein 2a (Mfsd2a), which is exclusively expressed on brain endothelial cells and induced by pericytes [12] . Consistently, Mfsd2a \u2212/\u2212 mice exhibit increased BBB permeability, caused by enhanced caveolae-mediated transcytosis [12] . Caveolae are flask-shaped plasma membrane invagination enriched in cholesterol and sphingolipids. They contain the major structural protein caveolin-1 (Cav-1), which undergoes extensive oligomerization prior to interacting with cavin-1 to form caveolae. Genetic ablation of either Cav-1 or cavin-1 results in a complete loss of caveolae in related tissues, suggesting their essential role in caveolae formation [13, 14] . Previous studies identified a close association between caveolae and stress fibers, a feature absent in clathrin-coated vesicles [15] . These interactions are critical for both stabilizing and entry of caveolae at the plasma membrane and are also regulated by the small RhoGTPases, including Ras homolog gene family, member A (RhoA) and Ras-related C3 botulinum toxin substrate (Rac)-1 [15] . Caveolae internalization is further regulated by kinases and phosphatases. In general, BBB endothelial cells exhibit low level of formation of caveolae due to the effects of Mfsd2a. However, levels of this protein are decreased during intracranial hemorrhage, suggesting that serum inflammatory mediators might increase BBB permeability via their effects on caveolae-mediated transcytosis.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 517, "end": 521, "text": "[12]", "ref_id": "BIBREF13"}, {"start": 640, "end": 644, "text": "[12]", "ref_id": "BIBREF13"}, {"start": 1058, "end": 1062, "text": "[13,", "ref_id": "BIBREF15"}, {"start": 1063, "end": 1066, "text": "14]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1198, "end": 1202, "text": "[15]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1455, "end": 1459, "text": "[15]", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Introduction to BBB Structure and Function"}, {"text": "The polarized expression of proteins at the CNS vascular barriers is also important for normal immune surveillance of the CNS. There is a growing body of evidence that lymphocytes, including effector memory CD4 and CD8 T cells, normally reside within the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) compartment [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] . The CSF compartment includes both the subarachnoid space (SAS) and the ventricular system, the latter of which contains the choroid plexus, a plexus of microvessels with modified ependymal cells that form a barrier between its fenestrated capillaries and the CSF compartment (reviewed in [23]), which connects with lymphatics that provide mechanisms for leukocyte egress out of the CNS [24, 25] . The choroid plexus is the main producer of CSF, which circulates via a combination of directed bulk flow, and both pulsatile and continuous bidirectional movement at the BBB and at the borders between CSF and CNS interstitial spaces (reviewed in [26] ). The SAS occurs between meningeal arachnoid and pia maters and contains fenestrated capillaries where immune cells may exit the blood and migrate along abluminal surfaces into perivascular spaces within the brain parenchyma at sites with BBB specializations. The localization of lymphocytes along CNS vasculature is accomplished via polarized expression of chemokines, including CXCL12 [27], which promotes interactions between T and perivascular antigen-presenting cells (APCs) in the setting of neuroinfectious diseases. Infiltrating T cells express CXCR4, a G protein-coupled signaling receptor of CXCL12 that is downregulated after T cell receptor activation, which allows T cell egress out of perivascular compartments [28, 29] . The abluminal localization of CXCL12 stands in stark contrast to its expression pattern at high endothelial venules within lymph nodes, where luminal CXCL12 promotes the homeostatic circulation of lymphocytes between the blood and lymphoid compartments [30], whereas BBB CXCL12 instead limits T cell entry into the CNS parenchyma [27, 28] . The level of CNS expression of CXCL12 vascular barriers is accomplished at both transcriptional and protein expression levels, the latter of which occurs via the CXCL12 scavenging receptor CXCR7 [31] . As the CXCR7 promoter contains eight NF-kB binding sites, multiple cytokines may alter the level of its expression at the BBB during neuroinflammation, including interleukin-1, -8, -17, and interferon-\u03b3. Alterations in the patterns of localizing cues at the BBB could promote excessive leukocyte entry, which may lead to further alterations in the BBB functions.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 293, "end": 297, "text": "[16]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 298, "end": 302, "text": "[17]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 303, "end": 307, "text": "[18]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 308, "end": 312, "text": "[19]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 313, "end": 317, "text": "[20]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 318, "end": 322, "text": "[21]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 323, "end": 327, "text": "[22]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 716, "end": 720, "text": "[24,", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 721, "end": 724, "text": "25]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 973, "end": 977, "text": "[26]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1704, "end": 1708, "text": "[28,", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1709, "end": 1712, "text": "29]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2045, "end": 2049, "text": "[27,", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2050, "end": 2053, "text": "28]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2251, "end": 2255, "text": "[31]", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Introduction to BBB Structure and Function"}, {"text": "The NVU is comprised of brain microvascular endothelial cells (BMECs), abluminal pericytes, and astrocyte terminal processes, known as end feet, the latter of which receive neuronal signals that modulate BBB influx and efflux transporters in response to parenchymal demands or damage [5] .

Studies in pericyte-deficient and transgenic mice with aberrant signaling between endothelial-derived platelet-derived growth factor BB (PDGF-BB) and platelet-derived growth factor receptor \u03b2 (PDGFR\u03b2) in pericytes have thus identified critical roles for these cells from embryonic development to adulthood [33] .

Thus, acute and subtle changes in BBB permeability with accompanying mild elevations in CSF protein levels may occur without severe CNS symptoms.

NMOSD are rare, relapsing immunemediated CNS disorders characterized by inflammation and demyelination of the optic nerves and spinal cord with evidence of BBB dysfunction in up to 70% of cases and two-thirds of patients exhibiting elevations in serum anti-AQP4 autoimmune IgG antibodies (classified as NMO patients) (reviewed in [46] ). While patient serum levels of anti-AQP4 IgG are not a predictive biomarker for overall disease course [47] , they are positively correlated with the extent of spinal lesions; BBB permeability, as assessed via albumin index; levels of CSF myelin basic protein concentration; and serum C3 [48] . Anti-AQP4 IgG contribute to pathogenesis via effects at astrocyte end feet within the NVU, which express AQP4, and bind to the abluminal surfaces of microvessels in NMO patients, in conjunction with lesions containing complement proteins, infiltrating neutrophils and eosinophils, and loss of AQP4 [49] . Human data are consistent with a significant role for anti-AQP4 IgG in the pathogenesis of NMO, which is further supported by the clinical efficacy of plasma exchange and B cell depletion [50] . In animal studies, targeted deletion of AQP4 or administration of anti-AQP4 IgG-positive sera plus complement from NMO patients leads to loss of BBB integrity and impaired water homeostasis within astrocyte end feet [51] [52] [53] . Similarly, using an in vitro human BBB model administration of human anti-AQP4 IgG and complement increased the migration of granulocytes across BMECs and led to astrocyte injury and decreased transendothelial electrical resistance (TEER) [54] . While the mechanism of anti-AQP4 IgG entry at the BBB, including access to astrocyte end feet, is unclear, endothelium-specific antibodies, VEGF, and matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-9 are all elevated in NMO [52, 55] . Activation of BMECs via endothelium-specific antibodies may lead to concomitant upregulation of intercellular adhesion molecule (ICAM)-1 [52] , promoting capture of leukocytes, and secretion of TNF and VEGF. The release of MMP-9 from infiltrating neutrophils could play a role in the degradation of the BBB ECM [55] by allowing anti-AQP4 IgG access to astrocyte AQP4.

Viral sensing by NLRs triggers the assembly and activation of inflammasome complex, resulting in the maturation and release of interleukin-1\u03b2 (IL-1\u03b2) and IL-18 from infected cells (reviewed in [140] ). Seemingly, IL-1\u03b2 acts in synergy with type I IFNs to suppress virus replication in cortical neurons, thus providing protection against lethal WNV infection in mice [147] . In contrast, enhanced production of IL-1\u03b2 is linked to neuropathology associated with JEV infection in murine models [148] . IL-1\u03b2 also abrogates the protective effect of astrocytes on BBB integrity by suppressing astrocytic expression of sonic hedgehog (SHH), a protein that upregulates the expression of TJs in BMECs [149] . Additionally, IL-1\u03b2 and IL-18 activate microglia and astrocytes to generate more inflammatory molecules potentiating inflammation. Activation of microglia is often reported during encephalitic viral infection [104, [150] [151] [152] [153] , which is regulated by IFNAR signaling in astrocytes and neurons [154] . While microglia play a crucial role in viral clearance in the CNS [154] [155] [156] , uncontrolled gliosis can disrupt BBB integrity through induction of pro-inflammatory cytokines and matrix metalloproteases [153] . Similarly, astrocytes mount a strong innate immune response upon recognition of viral PAMPs via RLR and TLR signaling pathways. In fact, astrocytes are the main producers of type I IFNs during infection with several distinct neurotropic viruses, including La Crosse virus, rabies virus (RABV), vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV), and Theiler's murine encephalitis virus (TMEV) [157, 158] . Deletion of IFNAR signaling specifically in astrocytes results in severe encephalomyelitis and mortality during otherwise nonlethal mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) [159] . Nonetheless, activated astrocytes can release excess amount of IP-10 during encephalitic viral infection [109] . IP-10 enhances the expression of tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF\u03b1) in a JNK-dependent manner, leading to barrier disruption [109] .

This is followed by a second stage when the parasite enters and establishes infection in the CNS, which can cause meningoencephalitis [218] . T. brucei initially enters the CNS through choroid plexus and circumventricular organs, likely by secreting a protease that degrades the basal lamina [219, 220] . During the early phase of CNS infection, production of IL-6 and IL-10 protects against neuroinflammation [221] . However, later in disease, activated microglia and astrocytes produce high levels of inflammatory cytokines (e.g., IL-1\u03b2, CXCL-8, CCL-2, and TNF-\u03b1), which can lead to severe neuropathology [222] . These inflammatory cytokines upregulate the expression of cells adhesion molecules (i.e., ICAM-1, VCAM-1, and E-selectin) on brain endothelial cells, which promotes leukocyte migration into the CNS. Infiltrating lymphocytes are particularly involved in the entry of parasite across BBB. They secret IFN-\u03b3, which in turn activates MMP9, a protease that degrades astrocytic basement membrane allowing paracellular entry of parasite into the CNS [219] . Consistently, enhanced expression of MMPs is reported during Trypanosoma infection [223, 224] . Additionally, IFN-\u03b3 augments the expression of CXCL-10 by astrocytes, which recruits more lymphocytes into the CNS [225] . Furthermore, T. brucei releases cysteine proteases that trigger protease-activated receptors (PARs) on BMECs, thereby promoting BBB dysfunction through enhancement of intracellular calcium level [226] . Interestingly, production of nitric oxide by perivascular macrophages restricts the entry of both parasites and activated T cells into the CNS by preserving BBB integrity [224] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 359, "end": 364, "text": "[218]", "ref_id": "BIBREF196"}, {"start": 517, "end": 522, "text": "[219,", "ref_id": "BIBREF197"}, {"start": 523, "end": 527, "text": "220]", "ref_id": "BIBREF198"}, {"start": 635, "end": 640, "text": "[221]", "ref_id": "BIBREF199"}, {"start": 832, "end": 837, "text": "[222]", "ref_id": "BIBREF200"}, {"start": 1283, "end": 1288, "text": "[219]", "ref_id": "BIBREF197"}, {"start": 1374, "end": 1379, "text": "[223,", "ref_id": "BIBREF202"}, {"start": 1380, "end": 1384, "text": "224]", "ref_id": "BIBREF203"}, {"start": 1502, "end": 1507, "text": "[225]", "ref_id": "BIBREF204"}, {"start": 1705, "end": 1710, "text": "[226]", "ref_id": "BIBREF205"}, {"start": 1884, "end": 1889, "text": "[224]", "ref_id": "BIBREF203"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Trypanosomiasis"}, {"text": "Acanthamoeba castellanii is a fatal infection of immunocompromised individuals and is associated with BBB dysfunction and has been shown to cause granulomatous encephalitis in immunocompromised patients.

These interactions trigger degradation of TJ proteins (e.g., occludin and ZO-1) in a Rho kinase-dependent manner [228] . Additionally, parasite interaction can induce cell cycle arrest and apoptosis through activation of phosphatidylinositol 3 kinases (PI3K) and inhibition of proteins that are involved in cell cycle progression [229, 230] . Similarly, cell cycle arrest and apoptosis of brain endothelial cells have been reported for Balamuthia mandrillaris, another parasite that is known to cause fatal amoebic meningoencephalitis [231] . Notably, host immune response plays a major role in the disruption of BBB during infection with A. castellanii and Naegleria fowleri [227, 232] .

These responses are generally neuroprotective, such as the IFNAR-mediated increase in TJ integrity during viral invasion or the stringent regulation of T cell access that can promote efficient clearance of pathogens, such as T. gondii, without excessive immunopathology. Pathogens have evolved various mechanisms to exploit cellular and molecular processes that control the CNS access, such as the reduction in expression of ZO-1 induced by the B. anthracis edema toxin (ET). Host responses, in turn, regulate immune cell infiltration into the CNS via antigen-specific events that allow leukocyte localization, interactions, and egress from perivascular spaces such that inflammation is efficiently directed at pathogen elimination. The interaction of immune cells with BMECs destabilizes junctional molecules via cytokinemediated signaling events that alter the structural properties of these cells. Thus, the most severe outcomes in the context of neuroinfectious diseases that enter the CNS via the BBB arise from host inflammatory responses rather than due to direct effects of pathogens themselves. This is particularly evident in the context of autoimmune diseases of the CNS where leukocytes gain inappropriate access to the CNS and cause extensive damage without acute infection.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Future Perspectives"}, {"text": "While we continue to improve our understanding of these processes, the challenge will be to better identify mechanisms that promote efficiency in immunemediated pathogen clearance while enhancing the CNS' own neuroprotective mechanisms. The use of animal models of neuroinfectious diseases that focus on various aspects of these processes in conjunction with the development of methods to isolate cellular participants, such as RiboTag or single cell RNA sequencing, in conjunction with cell-specific gene deletion strategies will permit cell-type-specific evaluation of mRNA expression and protein functions during the course of in vivo pathogen invasion, infection, and clearance. The advent of techniques in which human-induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) can be differentiated into all members of the NVU which are then incorporated into three-dimensional, fluid-based models of the human BBB also holds promise for identifying molecular players in this process and validating results in human systems. Future studies are likely to uncover novel neuroimmune pathways that may be safely targeted to prevent or treat infections of the CNS while also providing strategies for manipulating BBB function for the purposes of drug delivery or immunotherapies for noninfectious neurologic diseases. 14 ", "cite_spans": [{"start": 1299, "end": 1301, "text": "14", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [], "section":
