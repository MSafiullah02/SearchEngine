In order to identify the evolutionary 28 relationship of SARS-CoV-2 and evaluate the detection efficiency of primers that are 29 currently used in different countries, we retrieved genomic sequences of 373 30 SARS-CoV-2 strains from multiple databases and performed genome-wide variation 31 analysis. According to the nucleotide C28144T variation, the SARS-CoV-2 can be 32 divided into group A (117 strains) and group B (256 strains). The spike protein gene is speculated that the Washington strain is more like an ancestor type, and the Wuhan 44 strain is the offspring of the group A virus strain. By comparing the detection Introduction: 55 The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) started to 56 emerge in Wuhan in December 2019. As of April 20, 2020, more than 2.4 57 million cases have been reported in more than 211 countries and regions. 58 While the outbreak and pandemic of SARS-CoV-2 poses a great threat to public 59 health, in-depth studies have been conducted on key issues such as 60 transmission ability, epidemiology, clinical characteristics, pathogenic 61 mechanism, clinical treatment, and laboratory testing. Regarding the origin of 62 SARS-CoV-2, bat coronavirus RaTG13 was found to be highly similar to 63 SARS-CoV-2, so it was speculated that bats might be the original host of the 64 virus [1] . It was further found that the virus isolated from pangolin was similar 65 to SARS-CoV-2, suggesting that pangolin might be an intermediate host [2, 3] . 66 By comparing the genomes of existing coronavirus such as SARS-CoV-2, 67 MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV, it was found that RNA editing in the human body 68 is related to certain mutations obtained by virus evolution [4] . In order to 69 reveal more clues of the origin of SARS-CoV-2, which is still an urgent problem to 70 be solved, we retrieved the publicly available virus sequences from global 71 database sources such as GISAID and NCBI to analyze the emerged mutation, 72 evolution and typing of SARS-CoV-2, and to evaluate the influence of its 73 mutations on molecular detection in current clinical settings. and used to construct the phylogenetic tree by The variation percentage and pairwise distance were calculated using 87 MEGA-X32.

The ORF8 region is 207 considered to be an evolutionary hotspot of SARS related coronaviruses 208 (SARSr-CoVs) and an important region for the evolution of SARSr-CoVs. The 209 ORF8 region has been shown to play an important role in the virus replication 210 efficiency of SARS-CoV, interspecies transmission, and adaptation to human 211 hosts. It is speculated that it may be the result of the adaptation of 212 SARS-CoV-2 to the human host, and it has undergone reorganization selection 213 during the transmission from animal to human [12] .
