Your assertion that theoretically upholding the Hippocratic oath should make the fatality rate irrelevant has some merit. Although physicians, as you state, do not need to be martyrs, they need to fulfill their professional responsibility the same as a fireman running into a burning building. There is now personal protective equipment (PPE) that reduces the infectivity rate substantially which if worn properly should be reassuring. I agree that having PPE available is crucial. Peggy Noonan penned an editorial in the Wall Street Journal published April 11-12, 2020. She reflects upon the \"\u2026selflessness of doctors and nurses, for instance, and how they do their jobs because it's a calling. This tells us what bravery looks like, but also what a vocation is, and how a vocation is a spiritual event.\" 3. I am very sensitive to the fact that many residents are young with spouses and children.",
