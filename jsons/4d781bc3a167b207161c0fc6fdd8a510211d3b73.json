The severe group included patients with severe COVID-19 and those needing ICU care for acute respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation, or for shock, or multiorgan failure. The acute cardiac injury was defined as an elevation in cardiac troponin or new changes of ischemia on electrocardiography (ECG) or new wall motion abnormalities on an echocardiogram. Table 1 summarizes the baseline characteristics of 6 studies which compared dead versus survived patients and 1 study which compared patients with elevated D-dimer vs normal Ddimer level. Among the 6 studies which compared dead versus survived patients, the mean age of the study population in this group was 62.5\u00b114.8 years and 56.3% were males. Overall, hypertension (HTN) was the most common comorbidity (36.6%), followed by diabetes (DM) (16.8%) and coronary artery disease (CAD) (11.7%). The acute cardiac injury was present in 19.3% of patients while shock was observed in 8.9% of patients. New-onset arrhythmias of some form were observed in 12% of patients. Table 2 summarizes the baseline characteristics of 11 studies that compared severe versus non-severe COVID-19 patients. The mean age of the study population in this group was 49.9\u00b117.2 years and 54.6% were males. Overall, HTN was the most common comorbidity (18.8%), followed by DM (9.2%) and CAD (3.9%). The acute cardiac injury was present in 11% of patients while shock was observed in 3.6% of patients, of which, 2% of patients have septic shock while it was undefined in other patients.",

The D-dimer is routinely utilized clinically in diagnosing disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) and those with low pretest probability for deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE) 29 . More recently, D-dimer has been explored to identify patients thought to develop severe COVID-19 infection earlier in their course of illness. Elevated D-dimer level was discovered in about 36%-47% of hospitalized patients with COVID-19 infection, the majority of whom are those with severe COVID-19 infection 31 . A prior meta-analysis comprising of 4 studies showed a higher D-dimer level in patients with severe COVID-19 infection compared to those with the non-severe disease 32 . However, this meta-analysis was limited by relatively smaller sample size. Also, it did not answer an important question regarding the prognostic value of D-dimer in predicting severe COVID-19 infection and mortality. Our meta-analysis comprising of 18 studies evaluated the prognostic role of D-dimer in COVID-19 and is the",

Besides, studies have shown that rising D-dimer levels during the course of hospitalization are associated with worst long term outcomes 12, 13 . Additionally, COVID-19 patients with one or more comorbidities [HTN, DM, and cardiovascular diseases] are associated with adverse outcomes (i.e. severe COVID -19 disease and/or mortality) 35-37 . In our pooled analysis, patients with severe COVD-19 infection had significantly elevated D-dimer levels, with an increasing prevalence of HTN, DM, and CAD. There has been upcoming evidence regarding an increased incidence of venous thromboembolic events (VTE), including DVT and PE in patients with severe COVID-19 infection 38 . Besides, disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) has been increasingly reported in these patients. Tang et al. found a 3.5-fold increase in D-dimer levels in those who of 88.5%, however, results should be interpreted with caution due to small sample size and lack of external validation 40 . It is unclear at this time if this is a direct consequence of SARS-CoV-2 infection or a due to cytokine storm resulting in systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS), as seen in other viral infections 41-44 . A similar pattern of changes in coagulation cascade with increased prothrombotic state and incidences of DVT and PE were also noted with coronavirus responsible for Middle Eastern Respiratory Syndrome (MERS-CoV) and SARS-CoV-1 45 . The risk of VTE is generally high in critically ill patients, but the risk appears to be higher in patients infected with SARS-CoV-2. Due to several reasons for D-dimer elevation in these patients, imaging studies to diagnose DVT or PE should only be pursued if clinically warranted 40 . High clinical suspicion for DVT or PE is warranted in patients with elevated D-Dimer (more so in > 2mg/dl), as failure to treat may result in adverse clinical outcomes 17 . Thus, it is possible that patients who remained untreated for this catastrophe condition, accounted for adverse clinical outcomes as noted in our pooled analysis. However, no such information was available from the studies included in our analysis to evaluate for this difference. Also, performing imaging like CT angiogram of the chest can often be challenging in these patients due to isolation precautions and unstable hemodynamics, inability to administer intravenous contrast due to acute kidney injury and proning. In such cases, identification of new right ventricular dysfunction and/or enlargement on transthoracic echocardiogram can be useful. Perhaps, empirically treating all COVID-19 patients with intermediate or full (therapeutic) doses of anticoagulation to prevent",
