Oleszak and colleagues1 reported that the spike proteins of coronaviruses, particularly the mouse hepatitis virus, bovine coronavirus, and transmissible gastroenteritis virus, display Fc gamma receptor activity. Such molecular mimicry of components of our own immune system may even have a role in viral pathogenicity. This phenomenon, if shown to be true with the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) virus, could help to explain why seemingly healthy individuals with active immune responses make up a large proportion of the patients who die from SARS. This mimicking of the Fc receptor might result in binding of non-specific IgG to the mimic receptor, expressed on virus or virus-infected cells, which would then inhibit neutralisation by virus-specific IgG because of steric hindrance. Such mimicry might also protect infected cells from antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity and complement neutralisation.",

With FIPV, antibody-dependent enhancement is mediated by specific sites on the spike protein.2 Whether the SARS virus exhibits such properties needs to be investigated.",
