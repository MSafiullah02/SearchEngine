The technology allows for a high degree of multiplexing, with the detection of \u226515 pathogens from a single test. The RespPlex I test is designed to detect bacterial respiratory pathogens, whereas the RespPlex II test detects respiratory viruses. For each pathogen in the multiplex PCR, nested gene-specific primers are designed and included in the reaction [3]. These target specific primers are added at very low concentrations and are used to enrich the targets during the first few cycles of PCR. The inner gene-specific primers have tag sequences that are recognized by a universal set of primers, called SuperPrimers. The SuperPrimers are added at a higher concentration than the gene-specific primers, which allows for the exponential amplification of all targets present in the sample. The reverse SuperPrimer is labeled with biotin and is added at a higher concentration that the forward SuperPrimer; the asymmetric PCR yields more reverse strands for detection and eliminates the need to denature the PCR products before hybridization with probe. The labeled PCR products are detected using a capture probe specific for each target; these probes are covalently coupled to a color-coded bead, and each specific target corresponds to a unique bead color. The biotin-labeled amplified products are then detected by the addition of streptavidin-phycoerythrin. Detection occurs in the Luminex instrument, each unique colored bead is recognized by the laser, and the presence or absence of the phycoerythrin-labeled product determines whether that gene-specific target is present in the sample. The unique design of the ResPlex II system allows for sensitive, specific, and reproducible amplification of multiple targets.",

The tests used in one study [4] were designed to detect 21 pathogens, including common viral and bacterial pathogens. Of the 1742 respiratory samples tested, 67% had \u22651 pathogen detected, including 40% with 1 pathogen, 21% with 2, and 6% with \u22653. For the viruses that were also detected by direct immunofluorescence testing [direct fluorescent antibody DFA] (influenza A and B, parainfluenza 1\u20133, respiratory syncytial virus [RSV]), the RespPlex test had a sensitivity of 84%\u2013100% compared with DFA. For adenovirus, the ResPlex test had a sensitivity of <10% compared with DFA, which led to the reconfiguration of the adenovirus component of the test. Another study showed similar results [5]; the sensitivity of the RespPlex II test varied from 72% to 100% when compared with culture and monoplex real-time PCR assays, with a very high specificity (>99%). Although the sensitivity for some pathogens needs to be improved, overall the RespPlex tests have potential as a diagnostic tool. The ability to detect multiple pathogens in a single test is an important diagnostic advance and provides an approach to study the outcomes and clinical significance of coinfections.",

Nasopharyngeal aspirates were collected from children \u22643 years of age hospitalized for acute respiratory tract infections. Overall, 79.6% of specimens were positive for \u22651 virus by both real-time and the microarray tests, 18.5% were negative for all viruses by both methods, 1.8% of the samples (4 of 221) were positive only with the real-time tests, and no viruses were detected only with the microarray test. The most common viruses detected were RSV, influenza A, coronaviruses, and rhinoviruses or enteroviruses; multiple viruses were found in 13.1% of the specimens. When results were compared between the 2 methods for each specimen, there was a 94.1% concordance. The sensitivity of the microarray test was \u226590% for all of the viruses except adenoviruses and coronavirus NL63. Overall, the single real-time PCR tests were more sensitive than the microarray test, although the latter required fewer manual steps; for 24 specimens, 5 h less hands-on time is required, and throughput is higher than for the performance of the individual real-time tests. The microarray test requires several steps before loading of the Infiniti analyzer and is designed for batching specimens. The nucleic acid extraction, RT-PCR, and enzyme digestion steps take \u223c3 h; once the Infiniti analyzer is loaded, the first result is available in \u223c3.5 h, and each subsequent result requires an additional 20 min.

After the clinical specimen is pipetted into the specimen tube, the reagents and disposables for the nucleic acid extraction and amplification reactions are loaded onto the instrument. Nucleic acid extraction is performed in individual reagent cartridges which are loaded into the Jaguar instrument along with the amplification cartridge. The remainder of the test is completely automated. The proprietary extraction method allows for the rapid and efficient purification and concentration of nucleic acid from a relatively large specimen volume (500 \u03bcL to 1.0 mL) into an elution volume of 10 \u03bcL , which is then used to resuspend the amplification reagents. The amplification step is performed in a cartridge that is about 7 \u00d7 11 cm and 2 mm thick, each cartridge can accommodate 12 reactions, each with a reaction volume of 4 \u03bcL. This small volume allows for a very rapid cycling time hence the entire test is completed in \u223c90\u2013110 min. Because the system uses real-time PCR, the multiplexing capabilities are limited to 2\u20136 targets. However, the Jaguar system has several advantages: it is automated and very simple to use, essentially requiring a single pipette step, and because it uses real-time PCR there is no postamplification manipulation of the specimen, eliminating the risk of carryover contamination. The ease of use and rapid time to result would allow this system to be placed in a rapid-response laboratory in an emergency department to provide near-patient testing, with results available quickly enough to affect clinical management.",

STAR is similar in principle to real-time PCR but uses amplicon size instead of fluorescent probes to identify targets. After nucleic acid extraction, a multiplex PCR reaction is set up with unique primers for each specific target. The thermal cycler for the amplification reaction and capillary electrophoresis device are contained in the ICEPlex instrument. During the amplification reaction a very small sample (nanoliter) of the master mix is subjected to capillary electrophoresis; with sequential sampling (every 2 cycles, starting at cycle 19) and size separation, the signal for the amplicon increases. The accumulation of the amplicon is plotted over time, generating an amplification curve, and a cycle threshold is determined for each target. Each different target can be identified based on the unique size of the amplicon. Quantification of the targets is accomplished by adding 3 standards to the master mix, each at a different concentration and with a unique amplicon size. A standard curve is generated by plotting the cycle threshold values for the standards against their known concentration, and this curve is used to determine the concentration of the targets.

After nucleic acid is extracted and purified from the clinical specimen, multiple PCR reactions are performed in 96-well microtiter plates that use primers targeting highly conserved regions of the microbial genome that flank variable regions. These types of primers have been also used for sequence-based pathogen identification. The plates are loaded into the PLEX-ID analyzer, which automates the desalting step, ESI-MS, determination of base composition, and data analysis. The amplified mixture is injected into an electrospray ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometer, where the mass of each amplicon is measured. From the mass of the amplicon it is possible to determine the nucleotide base composition (ie, the number of A, G, C, and T nucleotides for that DNA molecule). By requiring the base composition for the forward and reverse strands to be complementary, the number of possibilities is reduced to a single unambiguous solution. The organism(s) in the sample are determined by comparing the base composition of the observed amplicons to a database comprising known sequence data from a wide array of pathogens.
