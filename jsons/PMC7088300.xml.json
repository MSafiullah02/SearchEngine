To our knowledge, the first attempts to model virus spreading in mobile networks rely on the use of non-rigorous mean-field approximations (similar to the classical Kephart\u2013White model Kephart and White 1991) that incorporate the mobility patterns of users. In Mickens and Noble (2005), the authors derive a threshold for the persistence of the epidemic by computing the average number of neighbours of a given node. Using a similar approach but with different mobility patterns, Nekovee (2007), Rhodes and Nekovee (2008) explore the evolution of the number of devices that are infected in terms of the contact rate between users.",

The information is transmitted between users who happen to be in each other\u2019s range. As in the case of static networks (Pittel 1987), one may be interested in the time it takes for the rumour to be known to all users. To this end we need to understand how information is transmitted between an informed and an ignorant user. This is also relevant to patterns of opinion formation and propagation of trends on social networks (Amini et al. 2009). Our work gives some insight on the impact of the network structure on the likelihood of successfully transmitting the rumour.",

More precisely, we consider a simple and stylised mathematical model of the spread of infection as follows. There is a finite, connected, undirected graph G = (V,E) on which the individuals perform independent random walks following a certain rate transition matrix Q. The infection can pass from an infected to a susceptible individual only if they are both at the same vertex.

The parameter \u03b2 is known the infection rate. We shall focus a single infected and a single susceptible individual and ask what the probability is that the susceptible individual becomes infected by time t. This probability has been studied in the case of a complete graph in Datta and Dorlas (2004). Here, we extend their results to a much wider class of graphs.",

In particular, random walks play a central role in computer science, spanning a wide range of areas in both theory and practice, including distributed computing (Bui et al. 2004). In fact many distributed algorithms use random walks as a building block. Applications in networks include token management (Coppersmith et al. 1993), load balancing (Karger and Ruhl 2004), small-world routing (Draief and Ganesh 2006; Kleinberg 2000), search Gkantsidis et al.

(2009) the authors propose a number of these dynamics and study their asymptotic properties on regular graphs. Aldous (1991) derives an upper bound for the expected meeting time of two independent copies of Markov chain as a function of the hitting time for a single chain. Coppersmith et al. (1993) provide an upper bound for the expected meeting time of a variant of the problems of two random walks on a general graph whereby an adversary tries to keep the tokens apart. Finally, Dimitriou et al. (2006) addresses a similar problem to ours. The authors analyse the dynamics of interacting random walks k \u2212 1 of which are healthy and one is infectious where the infetion is transimitted as soon as an infectious and a healthy particle meet at given site. This model is related to the broadcast model presented in Cooper et al. (2009). They derive upper bounds for the time it takes to infect all the healthy particles using standard results on the coalescence time of multiple random walks (Aldous and Fill 2002).",
