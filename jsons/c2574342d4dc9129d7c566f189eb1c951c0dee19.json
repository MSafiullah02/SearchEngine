ABSTRACT This paper augments the technology acceptance model (TAM) by empirically investigating the influence of behavioral traits (privacy concerns and trust) and cognitive beliefs (perceived usefulness and perceived ease of use) on patients' behavioral intention to accept technology in healthcare service delivery. Despite increased emphasis on healthcare service delivery, there has been limited studies as to how various behavioral constructs are related to adoption of new technology in healthcare sector. To this end, and to develop meaningful insights, a J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f conceptual model integrating behavioral constructs with constructs related to technology acceptance model is devised. The aim here is essentially to understand relationships that predict patients' acceptance of technology in healthcare services. The devised model is tested on responses obtained from survey of 416 patients availing healthcare service at various primary health centers in New Delhi, India. Structural equation modeling (SEM) is employed to conceptualize the model and validate nine hypotheses entailing key constructs. The results",

However, the targets were missed and considerable gaps in delivering and accessing healthcare services remain, particularly in developing countries (World Health Statics 2010) . Great disparities in terms of measured health inequalities prominently and visibly persist across the developing countries (Wagstaff, 2002) . Poor in developing countries continue to have minimal access to health services, J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f resulting in deterioration of health and thus, further aggravating poverty (Smith, 1999; Peters et al., 2008) . In order to access healthcare services, adoption of technology by patients has often been considered a key enabler for mitigating widespread disparities and poor accessibility (Lalseng and Andreassen, 2007) . In this backdrop, acceptance and utilization of technology in healthcare service delivery are crucial for both service providers and service consumers (patients).",

Among these theories, TAM is perhaps one of the widely explored models by information science (IS) researchers (Hwang 2005; Venkatesh 2000) . It establishes parsimonious relationships amongst ease of use, usefulness, and intention to use. TAM posits that usefulness and ease of use are the major determinants of the end-user's intention to use information technology (IT) (Davis 1986; Davis 1989) .",

To this end, this empirical study focuses on patients receiving treatment in primary health centers (PHCs) in New Delhi, India is aimed at answering the following research In order to answer these questions, based on a comprehensive review of extant literature, we propose extending TAM by integrating two latent behavioural variables, i.e., trust and privacy concern. This study puts forward a model apt for healthcare services in order to identify relationships between relevant factors affecting intention to use technology by patients. Structural equation model (SEM) is employed to analyse the structural relationships using survey based responses obtained from 416 respondents belonging to the age group of 18 to 60 years, availing healthcare service at primary health centers in New Delhi, India.",

            "text": "Available literature on adoption of technology in healthcare can be broadly categorized in two streams. First, studies concerned with extent of IT related adoption in healthcare by analyzing pervasiveness, scope and scale. Second, studies examining enablers and barriers in adoption of IT (Agarwal et al., 2010) . Studies belonging to first stream have explored various characteristics of healthcare service providers, such as size, location, competition, ownership status, etc., that have adopted IT (Cutler et al., 2005; Jha et al., 2009; Kazley and Ozcan, 2007; McCullough, 2008) . Major barriers in adoption of IT as enumerated by second stream of studies include financial, functional, environmental and individuals including service providers and service users (Bhattacharjee et al., 2006; DesRoches et al., 2008; Jha et al., 2009; Tang et al., 2006) . One key challenge with adoption of IT in healthcare is that the systems are typically not designed for multi-institutional lifetime records. Ethically managing health data, guarantee of security, auditability of records, and interoperability and immutability are few concerns that need to be addressed (Ekblaw et al., 2016) . Qadri et al., (2020) in their study of emerging technologies for healthcare delivery advocated for IoT (Internet of things) and AI (artificial intelligence) oriented healthcare delivery system. Further, this study conceptualized the tenets of H-IoT (healthcare internet of things). The arguments for adoption of H-IoT was also supported by Porambage et al., (2016) . Meng et al., (2018) in their surveyed stakeholders belonging to 12 different healthcare organizations developed a trust-based approach to figure out malicious devices in a healthcare environment. Yan et al., (2015) proposed trust based framework for virtualized networks and softwaredefined networking. The study in particular argued for adoption of cloud computing to securely deploy various trustworthy security services over the virtualized networks. Ahmed et al., (2017) explored the recent advances in big data analytics for IoT systems as well as the key requirements for managing big data and for enabling analytics in an IoT environment. Lin et al., (2018) presented a blockchain-based system for secure mutual authentication to enforce fine-grained access control polices. proposed two trust evaluation algorithms to support different application cases. Specifically, these algorithms can overcome attacks raised by internal malicious evidence providers. Perera et al., (2017) argued for adoption of FOG (edge) computing based approach for solving analytical and computational problems for diverse problems including those related to medical industry and smart cities. Wazid et al., (2017) devised a novel authentication framework for medicine J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f anticounterfeiting system considering the IOT environment aimed at ascertaining the authenticity of pharmaceutical products. The key benefit of the proposed scheme was in terms of its lower communication and computation cost over other similar authentication schemes. Wazid et al. (2018) proposed a new secure remote user authentication scheme for implantable medical devices communication environment to overcome security and privacy issues associated with existing schemes.",

TAM has received enormous empirical support in elucidation and prediction of technology acceptance and use in various settings (Dabholkar, 1996; Dabholkar and Bagozzi, 2002, and . Divergent external factors such as training, compatibility, anxiety, computing support, experience, relevance, personal innovativeness, etc., have been studied in context of TAM (Lee et al., 2003) . TAM has also been applied to study various aspects in healthcare services. Online disability evaluation systems, personal digital assistant for healthcare, telemedicine technology, electronic health records (EHR) and mobile applications are few of them. Adoption of e-health monitoring using smart wearable healthcare devices has been one of the recent contributions to extant research literature (Li et. al, 2016; Papa et. al, 2018; Wu et. al, 2011; Zhou et al., 2019) . Rahimi et al.

Privacy concern has been typically defined as concern for loss of privacy and need for protection against uncalled-for communication and misuse of personal information (Smith et al., 1996) . It concerns with being in control of personal information exchanges and security, and whether the beholder of the information will use it appropriately (Lanier and Saini, 2008) . Xu et al. (2008) suggested that privacy concern is the result of individual's outlook to privacy and circumstantial cues that enable him/her to assess the outcome of information disclosure.

Trust is essentially needed in uncertain situations, since it J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f eventually implies accompanying risks and becoming susceptible to trusted parties (Hosmer, 1995) . It has been identified as a catalyst of transactions providing service receivers with expectations of fruitful exchange relationship with service providers.

Steininger et al., (2015) in their study pertaining to acceptance of electronic health record (EHR) demonstrated that privacy concerns impact perceived usefulness of EHRs negatively. He et al., (2012) identified the security challenges facing a sensor network for wireless medical monitoring and suggested that the network should follow a two-tier architecture. Based on such an architecture, the study also devised an attack-resistant and lightweight trust management scheme termed as ReTrust. Zhou et al., (2013) Likewise, researchers have extensively explored behavioural constructs namely, trust and privacy concern, their enablers and their influence on technology acceptance independently in online transactions and e-commerce applications. However, studies on effect of behavioural aspects of patients on acceptance of IT in healthcare are lacking.

Consumers evaluate usefulness of a service based on what they get and what they pay for it. Similar to other services, within healthcare services as well, the patient strives for timely and right treatment without much burden on his/her resources. If the patient perceives that any technology can help in getting effective treatment, the patient is more likely to avail the service facilitated by that technology. Similarly, given major parameters remaining same, if patients are provided with option to get themselves treated at any place without physically carrying their case history and using technology as facilitator, they would most likely gravitate towards accepting the technology. Further, ease of use is vital for acceptance, as familiarity with technology and skills to use technology are likely to vary significantly within the diverse population. There is extensive literature that has established that perceived usefulness and perceived ease of use directly and positively influence behavioral intention to use. Perceived ease of use also influences indirectly through perceived usefulness (Dabholkar, 1996; Dabholkar and Bagozzi, 2002; Davis, 1989; Szajna, 1996; Venkatesh, 2000) .

Healthcare delivery, however, is more personalized and vital service for consumers (Berry and Bendapudi, 2007) . The patient has to give access to personal information and previous health records to the service providers. Extant studies have established an array of divergent aspects in delivery and patients' ability to evaluate healthcare services (McGlynn et al., 2003) . Healthcare is one such typical service, wherein efficacy of primary service availed (treatment) cannot be evaluated or verified even after consumption of service. Hence, the consumer has to solely rely on the diagnosis made by the J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f service provider. Handing over personal details to the service provider is predicated upon trust, a vital factor in acceptance of technology in healthcare services. Trust is one of the defining factors in such exchanges, where uncertainty is present. Practically, trust is a prerequisite for interactions conducted in uncertain environment (Ba and Paulov, 2002) . In such situations, beliefs about the service provider (apart from usefulness and ease of use) also becomes crucial. If the service providers fail to convey trustworthiness, the consumer is not likely to engage in transaction (Hoffman et al. 1999) . Similarly, in case of healthcare, if the patient trusts the healthcare provider to fulfill his or her needs, then the patient is more likely to view technology as beneficial for him or her (Lalseng and Andreassen, 2007) Studies have supported trust as a vital construct for predicting acceptance of technology (Carter and B\u00e9langer, 2005; Gefen et al., 2003; Parasuraman et al., 2008; Paulov, 2003) .",

On the other hand, if trust is low, consumer would be forced to devote more time and effort to gauge the service thus to avoid any opportunism on part of the service provider.

            "text": "Privacy concern (a part of our proposed model) is considered a direct determinant of BI. The rationale is extracted out of the existing studies carried out in different domains. Existing literature suggests that privacy concerns make users circumspect about using technology and sharing personal information. In sensitive areas, privacy concern of health information may even cause individuals to avoid obtaining certain healthcare services. If privacy concerns of the customer are not mitigated by the service provider, it will have significant negative effect on the consumer's attitude and behavior towards the service (Milne and Boza 1999; Phelps et al. 2001) . In an empirical study on internet uses, Dinev and Hart, (2005) also found out negative impact of privacy concern on intention to use. Privacy of the personal information is the focal concern of the individual (Stewart and Segars, 2002) . Mukherjee and Nath (2007) identified that security to privacy along with shared values positively influences behavioral intentions of the customers. This study follows the perception that privacy concerns measure the patient's assessment of lack of reliance on the service provider, especially when one has to share personal details. Therefore, in line with the above presented arguments, we hypothesize the following. Though various researchers have explored privacy in different contexts and environments, we found a few literatures on the effect of privacy concern on PU and PEOU. Andrews et al., (2014) asserted that higher privacy concerns negatively mediate the relationship between perceived risk and attitude of the user. Intuitively, we can argue that patients will not find usefulness in a technology that is likely to invade their privacy. Individuals are likely to put more effort into monitoring if they feel that their privacy is at stake while using any service. Therefore, concern for the privacy of the user will reduce the ease of use and will affect J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f his/her perceived usefulness for any service negatively. Along these arguments, we hypothesize the following. ",

Whenever a patient visits any healthcare provider, either the patient carries the related previous records (in the form of case history) obtained from previous healthcare providers, or the case is registered as a fresh case. In such redundant process, lots of scarce resources that could have been provided to a new patient, are used on the same patients repetitively. To facilitate availability of medical records, we propose that healthcare records to be linked to unique identity (Aadhaar -unique identification number for the citizen of India) of the patient.

Further, within privacy related items itself, perhaps PCON1 has the lowest mean, implying that respondents in general are already concerned about the providing much personal information. ",

Widely accepted and reported fit indices including absolute fit, incremental fit and parsimony fit indices of the conceptual model are examined (Hooper at al., 2008) . Absolute fit measures, i.e., chi-square static, GFI (goodnessof-fit index), AGFI (adjusted goodness-of-fit index) and RMSEA (root mean square error approximation) determine degree to which the overall model predicts the observed covariance or correlation matrix. Incremental fit indices, i.e., NFI (normed fit index), CFI (comparative fit index) and NNFI (non-normed fir index) compare the proposed model to J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f baseline model, often referred to as null model. PNFI (parsimonious normed fit index) and PGFI (parsimonious goodness-of-fit index) are termed as parsimony fit indices. These indices determine impact of additional parameters on the conceptualized model.

In addition to reaffirming relations of original TAM constructs, our results elucidate that trust and privacy concern directly affect patients' intention to use technology in healthcare services. Growing interest in patients' reaction to introduction of technology in healthcare has given impetus to theories that predict and explain technology acceptance and usage. The results suggest that while enhanced trust positively affects behavioral intention and perceived utility of the service, privacy concern, on other hand, has negative effect on behavioral intention, perceived utility and perceived ease of use of medical services. In particular, the studies carried out by Andrews et al., (2014) and Honein-AbouHaidar et al., (2020) are important to be discussed here, since both of these studies, investigated the acceptance of technology by people availing healthcare services. Andrews et al., (2014) , while investigating Australian general public perception of adopting a personally controlled electronic health record (PCEHR), argued that individuals appreciate the value associated with PCEHR. However, adoption of PCEHR was explained by perceived value and perceived risk. Further, individuals also liked to have two key concerns, viz., reduction in privacy and lack of trust to be mitigated before committing to PCEHR. However, how and to what degree trust and privacy concerns impact the behavioral intentions of individuals is something ascertained by our study. Unlike the study by Andrews et al. (2014) , our study also considers the relationships amongst behavioral constructs and perceived utility associated with adoption of technology in healthcare delivery.",

However, evaluation of effect of trust and privacy concern on technology acceptance in healthcare services provides the aspect of originality in respect of existing literature. Our results in regard to behavioral intention also somewhat support the findings from Honein-AbouHaidar et al., (2020) arguing that positive relationship exists between perceived utility and behavioral intention in adopting electronic patient portal (EPP). Our study supports earlier literature on trust and transactions and confirms their relevance in healthcare services also. Data from primary health centres shows that trust has direct bearing on behavioural intentions of patients to use the service or avoid to it. The study also establishes positive relationship between trust and perceived utility. Based on these results, we can assert that trust is an enabler of acceptance of technology in healthcare services. The results also demonstrate that privacy concerns of patients are negatively associated with perceived utility, perceived ease of use and as a result behavioural intention of adaptation of new technology in healthcare. Our results support previous studies, carried out in different services, which suggest that if consumers' privacy concerns are not mitigated, they will have negative impact on consumers' decision on availing that service (Eastlick et al., 2006) . Given the potential repercussion on consumer's attitude, it is essential J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f that researchers accurately understand the concern related to consumer's information privacy.",

Health care managers, therefore, must find cogent ways to obtain superior healthcare results considering rather limited resources. Secondly, as numerous studies have shown that adoption of new technologies in healthcare can provide quality healthcare to all socioeconomic strata of the society particularly in rural and remote areas, it is pivotal for healthcare service providers to understand the driving forces of patients' acceptance of technology. This study demonstrates factors that affect behavioural intentions of patients in acceptance of newer technologies.

In this regard there are certain concrete steps can be taken by the concerned stakeholders including both government and healthcare providers. In Indian context and on a governmental level, of particular interest would be HIPAA (Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996) and EUs safe harbor law (Barua et al., 2011) . These laws usually mandate strict security measures for sharing and exchanging health data, and failure to comply with them is accompanied by severe penalties. From the standpoint of health care service providers, only authorized users such as medical staff should have access to the collected health data as it almost always contains confidential and sensitive data. This security critical system, however, requires careful balancing between confidentiality and availability. The dichotomous nature of these two goals is clear: while all the patient's data should be available to be shared and monitored to deliver professional healthcare services; for security reasons, part of the data may be considered confidential and therefore must not be accessible. Clearly, rationalization of the paired goals should be achieved to provide the best possible care for patients. Further, when dealing with privacy concerns in e-healthcare models, security models revolving around data collection, data transmission, and data storage would have to be designed carefully (Zriqat et al., 2016) . Of particular interest in this context would be use of blockchain concept for patients' registration and handling of medical record as proposed by Dhaggara et al., (2019) as a way of creating immutable and secure framework.",

This study has been carried out in urban area of one city of the country wherein the respondents were relatively J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f young and educated. Educated respondents therefore pose less of a challenge as far as interpretation of survey responses are concerned. Though data has been collected by randomly selecting healthcare centers and patients, it may not reflect huge diversity of the population. To further validate present findings, proposed model may be investigated in different countries in different geographical spreads. Model may further be cross validated in developing and developed countries. This will further boost the reliability of results and may result in some degree of generalization of managerial and theoretical inferences. To further boost robustness and validity of the proposed model, study may be replicated with larger sample size and at different levels of healthcare services like in specialty hospitals. Finally, the study investigates effect of only two additional behavioral constructs on technology acceptance in healthcare delivery. Future study may include more behavioral constructs to study their effects on technology acceptance in healthcare. Of particular interest would be to include behavioral constructs that can explain patients' behavioral and psychological traits in the time of pandemics (for instance the ongoing COVID-19 situation). Psychological interventions for all or specific (e.g., more vulnerable) groups aimed at identification of adverse psychological impacts and psychopathological symptoms in the general population during the pandemics would be of use to governments and healthcare service providers.",

However, such methods, for instance, those related to FE (e.g., ordinary regression, uni/multivariate regression models) and RE including meta-analysis related (e.g., Hunter-Schmidt/Hedges-Vevea) are often considered data hungry methods, wherein some important questions such as how much and what kind of data need to be collected to deploy such models meaningfully and reliably need to be addressed. Questions, for instance, whether the data would be pooled in nature or individual respondent based would also aid practitioners in determining the right sampling strategy (Martin et al., 2010) . Schmidt et al. (2011) in their study discussed comparison of FE and RE model for empirical data. They argued that results often vary substantially given the type of model used since FE is often associated with apriori while RE takes into account statistical calibration. Further, J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f deploying FE models and generalizing findings are often dichotomous in nature in that FE models can lead to inflated Type I error rates and erroneously narrow confidence interval (Hedges & Vevea, 1998; Hunter & Schmidt, 2000) .",

Intent of this empirical work was to explore constructs that affect patients' acceptance of technology in healthcare. Technology in healthcare has many advantages and at times seems to be only answer to the enormous task of providing universal health coverage. However, for implementation and acceptance of technology in this sector, practitioners and researchers have to take behavioral traits of patients into consideration as well. This empirical study presents an extension to the well-established TAM model. Primary contribution of this study is integration of behavioral variables (trust and privacy concern) with TAM constructs into a parsimonious model that predicts patients' acceptance of technology in healthcare service. This study suggests that trust, privacy concern and perceived utility shape patients attitude towards technology acceptance; while trust and privacy concern directly influence perceived utility. As healthcare service is often characterized by credence of highest degree and different from other services on many accounts, there remains significant scope of unauthorized exploitation of patients' health data. This study suggests that patients' fears about losing privacy has to be dispelled for their acceptance of any newer technology. Practitioners and agencies responsible for healthcare need to earn trust of patients before implementing any new technology. The study empirically establishes relationship between trust and privacy concern of patients with their intention of technology acceptance. Based on a scenario, the data was collected from primary health centers in India to understand various constructs and to test related hypotheses.
