In dogs, two distinct coronaviruses have been described; canine coronavirus (CCoV), which belongs to group 1 and canine respiratory coronavirus (CRCoV) belonging to group 2. Coronaviruses possess a single stranded, positive sense genome of 27\u201331 kb in length which contains a large open reading frame for the major nonstructural proteins at the 5\u2032 end and the structural proteins as well as minor nonstructural proteins in the 3\u2032 third of the genome. The structural proteins include the spike glycoprotein (S), the small envelope protein (E), the membrane protein (M) and the nucleocapsid protein (N) (Weiss and Navas-Martin, 2005).",

For primers CENP 1 and CENP 2 directed to the CCoV nucleocapsid protein gene (Table 1\n) the following cycling conditions were used: 95 \u00b0C for 5 min, 35 cycles of 95 \u00b0C for 1 min, 53 \u00b0C for 40 s and 72 \u00b0C for 30 s followed by a final extension at 72 \u00b0C for 10 min. The primers were designed to amplify a 280 bp product corresponding to 68\u2013347 nt of the nucleocapsid gene of CCoV. The 5\u2032 end of the spike gene was amplified using a consensus forward primer located in ORF1b (CEPol-1) and reverse primers specific for either TGEV (TGSp-2), CCoV type I (CESp-10) or CCoV type II (CESp-6). The primer sequences are given in Table 1. Primer pair CEPol-1-TGSp-2 amplified a 370 bp product corresponding to 20,168\u201320,537 nt of the TGEV Purdue genome, which consisted of 198 nt of the 3\u2032 end of ORF1b and the first 172 nt of the spike gene. Primer pair CEPol-1-CESp-10 was designed to amplify a 1108 bp product consisting of 167 nt of the 3\u2032 end of ORF1b and the first 941 nt of the spike gene. Primer pair CEPol-1-CESp-6 amplified a 578 bp product consisting of 197 nt of the 3\u2032 end of ORF1b and the first 381 nt of the spike gene. The cycling conditions were 95 \u00b0C for 5 min, 35 cycles of 95 \u00b0C for 1 min, 50 \u00b0C for 1 min and 72 \u00b0C for 1 min followed by a final extension for 10 min at 72 \u00b0C. In addition primers EL1F and EL1R directed to the spike gene of type I CCoV (Pratelli et al., 2004) were used, which amplify a 346 bp product corresponding to 3538\u20133883 nt of the spike gene of CCoV strain Elmo. A nested PCR primer set to the CCoV spike gene (Naylor et al., 2002) amplified a 1086 bp product using the outer primers, corresponding to 81\u20131166 nt of the spike gene of CCoV strain Insavc. The spike gene consensus primers 55 and 56 for all coronaviruses (Wise et al., 2006) amplified 3549\u20134188 nt of the spike gene of CCoV Insavc (640 bp product). Primers M5 and M6 amplified the complete sequence of the CCoV membrane protein gene (Pratelli et al., 2003). The consensus primers Conscoro 5 and Conscoro 6 were based on the polymerase gene (corresponding to 13,602\u201313,852 nt of the genome of TGEV strain Purdue). These primers detect both, CCoV and CRCoV (Erles et al., 2003). The region containing ORFs 7a and 7b was amplified using primers N3SN and R3AS as previously described (Wesley, 1999).",

While all samples were negative for CRCoV by PCR, CCoV was detected in 17.5% of samples tested. The dogs sampled for this study did not show any clinical signs of enteric disease indicating that subclinical infections with CCoV were common in this population. Alternatively the dogs may have recovered from CCoV induced enteritis some time in the past as long term shedding of CCoV for several months has been reported (Pratelli et al., 2001). Dogs housed in kennels are more frequently positive for CCoV as shown by virus isolation and antibody detection (Pratelli et al., 2002, Tennant et al., 1993). A number of PCR assays for CCoV were compared in this study three of which identified seven positive samples (out of 40 tested). The consensus PCR approach offered the advantage of detecting both CCoV and CRCoV but required further processing of the PCR product by restriction digest. Primer pairs CENP1-2 and N3SN-R3AS gave the same results as the consensus primers but were specific for group 1 coronaviruses and are therefore more useful for CCoV detection in clinical samples.",

Previously it had been described that CCoV strain UCD-1, a US field strain isolated in the 1970s, possessed a spike gene similar to that of TGEV (Wesley, 1999). However further studies on the prevalence of this type of CCoV in dogs have not been reported. All strains that were closely related to TGEV at the 5\u2032 end of the spike gene had a complete ORF 7b, which is not present in TGEV, indicating that these were CCoV strains rather than a direct infection of dogs with TGEV. These strains were also more closely related to TGEV in the N gene than to CCoV type I or type II, however they were more closely related to CCoV type II in the M gene. The evolution of CCoV and TGEV appears to be closely linked and it has been proposed that type I CCoV was the ancestor for CCoV type II and that TGEV subsequently evolved from CCoV type II (Lorusso et al., 2008).",

The prevalence of this type of CCoV in the canine population of the UK and world-wide will therefore have to be determined in future studies. The spike protein carries major antigenic epitopes of coronaviruses. Despite their divergence at the N-terminus of the spike protein cross-neutralisation in vitro between TGEV and CCoV has been reported (Reynolds et al., 1980) and sera raised against CCoV were shown to recognise TGEV spike protein by ELISA (Horzinek et al., 1982).
