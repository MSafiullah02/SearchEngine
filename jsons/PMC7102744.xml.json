All but three of the cases could be linked to one index patient, a woman who had returned from Hong Kong in February. There she had stayed on the same floor of a hotel as a physician who had travelled from Guangdong province in southern China where several hundred cases of the then unknown respiratory illness had been detected in the preceding months [2] (Figure 1\n). The effort to contain the epidemic in Toronto included the investigation of 2132 potential cases and the identification of 23103 contacts as requiring quarantine. The provincial government of Ontario calculated the costs for coping with the epidemic at C$1.13billion [3]. The tourism industry lost C$260 million following a World Health Organisation (WHO) advisory against travel to Toronto [4].",

Globalisation with increasing mobility of humans poses an ever-growing challenge to international public health. Among 784 American travellers to developing countries 501 (64%) reported at least one illness during their trip. The risk of falling ill was the lowest in Southern Africa and the highest in the Indian subcontinent [7] (Figure 2\n). The most common illnesses acquired during travel in the developing world are diarrhoea, malaria, influenza and dengue fever [8] (Figure 3\n). In contrast to short-term travel, international migration can lead to changes in the epidemiology of longer lasting diseases such as tuberculosis, HIV and Hepatitis B, reflecting the prevalence gap of these disorders between original and receiving country [9]. Thus between 1997 and 2002, two thirds of all heterosexually acquired HIV-Infections in 12 European countries were diagnosed in people from countries with generalised HIV epidemics [10]. Of particular concern are undocumented migrants, as by definition they have little access to medical care and are afraid to report any illness by fear of being deported. They also may not only import infections occurring at home, but also others acquired during their odyssey [11].",

The previous IHR were set up in 1969 with the purpose to monitor six different infectious diseases: cholera, plague, yellow fever, smallpox, relapsing fever and typhus. In view of newly emerging diseases such as viral hemorrhagic fevers, increasing cross-border travel and the lack of an internationally coordinated mechanism to contain international disease spread, the revision of this international agreement was initiated in the 1990s. The IHR (2005) are a set of rules that are legally binding on 194 countries around the world. They require that all countries strengthen their public health and surveillance capacities and that they notify WHO in case of a \u201cpublic health emergency of international concern\u201d which is determined as any event that \u201cconstitutes a public health risk to other states through the international spread of disease and that potentially requires a coordinated international response\u201d. In response WHO offers advice as well as technical and possibly financial support to meet these new obligations [12].",

Their aim is to gather and distribute information about imported infectious diseases, thus allowing the update of travel recommendations. Sometimes, the diagnosis of a disease in a returned traveller can serve as a sentinel for a change in the epidemiological situation in the country of travel. In November 2004 an outbreak of falciparum malaria in the eastern Dominican Republic was detected through sentinel reports in Tropnet Europe and SIMPID, the associated European and German networks for surveillance of imported infectious diseases, as well as through three reports reaching CDC from the US and Canada. The information led to investigations and control measures in the Dominican Republic. CDC recommendations for chloroquine prophylaxis in the region were adapted [13], [14].",

While being unable to take off, the aircraft ventilation system was shut off. Within 72 h, 72% of the 54 passengers developed symptoms of influenza, the attack rate being higher the longer the person had stayed on board. Epidemiologically and through typing of the virus the infections could be traced back to one index patient who had developed symptoms shortly after entering the aircraft [21]. The event raised widespread concern about the danger of the spread of infectious diseases during air travel. Fortunately these fears have not been confirmed. There have been several reports on potential transmission of Mycobacterium tuberculosis during air travel and in some cases contact investigations found evidence of transmission of infection (i.e. positive skin tests), but none of the affected individuals has developed active tuberculosis. Based on an overall notification rate of 0.05 per 100,000 long haul passengers the aircraft cabin can be classified as a low TB incidence environment [22].",

On average, they stay abroad for a longer time and they are more likely to travel with medical conditions, being pregnant and with small children. Living in close proximity with their relatives in low socioeconomic settings they are at higher risk for diseases like tuberculosis, typhoid fever and also malaria [29]. In a study assessing fever in returned travellers from the GeoSentinel Surveillance Network VFRs were more likely to develop fever after travel to sub-Saharan Africa, south-central Asia and Latin America. They were also more likely to suffer from a vaccine-preventable illness returning from Southeast Asia (OR 5.9; 95 CI, 2.9\u201311.9), south-central Asia (OR, 2.7; 95% CI, 2.0\u20135.1) and Latin America (OR, 2.7; 95% CI, 1.1\u20136.6) [30].",

Leaving the \u201csocial control\u201d of the home country behind, making new acquaintances and maybe increased consumption of, e.g. alcohol might lower the threshold for sexual encounters with unknown partners. Reported rates of casual sexual experiences during travel vary from 5% to 51% [31]. In an Australian study only 34% of male travellers to Thailand stated not intending to have sex [32]. Men and women do not differ in their willingness to get to know new partners, but in their behaviour. Men more often pay for sex and, similarly to middle aged women, they are more likely to have sex with local partners. Younger women have sexual contacts more likely with fellow travellers and expatriates. Factors that are associated with a higher rate of casual sexual encounters in an individual include higher socioeconomic status, travelling alone or with people of the same gender, history of multiple sexual partners at home and repeated visits to a region [33].",

However, we must all realize that there is no base for complacency.
