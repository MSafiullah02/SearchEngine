Each employee is fit-tested for the appropriate respirator size and is provided training on how to put on, take off and how to clean the respirator. The effectiveness of a respirator will depend on a good mask-to-face seal, and OSHA requires that respirators be checked annually to determine that the fit remains acceptable. During the fitting session, employees are given several respirator options and are allowed to choose the option they prefer on the basis of comfort and adequacy of fit. Room for eye protection, to talk, and the position of the mask on the nose, face, and cheeks determine comfort. The fit of the respirator is determined by proper chin placement, adequate strap tension, fit across the bridge of the nose, ability to cover the distance from nose to chin, tendency to slip, and a seal check.5\n",
