Within these degenerative diseases, the feline acquired immunodeficiency syndrome induced by some variants of FeLV (FeLV\u2010FAIDS) is usually fatal, and also very similar to human AIDS (Hardy and Essex, 1986). Immunodeficiency is produced because FeLV replicates in the cells of the immune system, producing a dramatic decrease in the populations of lymphocytes and granulocytes. More cats die from FeLV\u2010induced immunodeficiency than from proliferative diseases (Hardy and Essex, 1986).",

In this disease, an altered proteinogram of the peritoneal effusion is pathognomonic of wet FIP; cats with clinical signs such as anorexia, weakness, wasting, etc. along with ocular and/or neurological signs and elevated serum globulin levels should be suspected of having dry FIP. The albumin/globulin ratio (A/G) is also a useful diagnostic tool, especially when measured in the effusion. An A/G ratio <0.4 is associated with FIP (Sparkes et al., 1994).",

In brief, DNA was extracted from 200 \u03bcl of blood, using DNeasy Tissue kit (QiaGen, Valencia, CA, USA). The DNA was amplified by a pair of primers which are common to FIV and FeLV and hybridize in the pol region, rendering a product of 1325 bp for FIV and 490 bp for FeLV.

It has been stated that the hypergammaglobulinemia correlates with aberrant polyclonal hyperactivation of the B cells, although their total numbers in the peripheral blood remain normal (Ackley et al., 1990). In FIV infections, as in HIV ones, there is an increase in antibodies both against virus\u2010specific and non\u2010virus\u2010related antigens (Flynn et al., 1994). Possibly, the high mutation rate of these viruses accounts, at least in part, for the hypergammaglobulinemia, as variants would be constantly emerging inducing the continuous formation of antibodies. In AIDS, most of the HIV\u2010infected patients develop hypergammaglobulinemia during the first year post\u2010infection, also associated with the inversion of the CD4/CD8 ratio (Shirai et al., 1992). Its development is difficult to explain. First, a low CD4/CD8 ratio implies low number of CD4+ T\u2010helper cells to activate B cells; secondly, it has been shown in HIV+ patients that B cells undergo cell death through apoptosis and other mechanisms (De Milito, 2004). Thus, it seems paradoxical that gammaglobulins would increase if B cells are both dying and not being activated by T\u2010helper cells.",

According to some authors, the statistically significant differences in the gammaglobulins disappeared after month 56 (Hofmann\u2010Lehmann et al., 1997), because of an increased variance of the gammaglobulin fraction in the FIV\u2010positive cats. This may reflect the beginning of a decreased B\u2010cell activation and, with it, an additional step towards immune suppression in some of the FIV\u2010positive cats. As this was not observed in the cats of the present study, it could possibly mean that they had not reached this stage of infection.",

Also, high gammaglobulin levels corresponded to high absolute and relative neutrophil numbers, which is also indicative of inflammation. However, other authors have reported that haematological parameters, such as haematocrit, total WBC, neutrophil and lymphocytes were not correlated with the gammaglobulin concentrations (Shelton et al., 1995). The discrepancies observed may be due to the different number of animals included in each study (89 in the present study, five in the one conducted by Shelton), or to the variability of the virulence of the infective strain (Hofmann\u2010Lehmann et al., 1997).

In fact, most of the animals included in the study had low gammaglobulin levels (86.7%); however, four animals, non related to each other, that had gammaglobulin levels higher than 3.0 g/dl raised the mean. Two of these animals were female kittens 4 and 5 months old, which died of acute respiratory signs shortly after being taken to the practitioner. The high gammaglobulin levels could be due, either to maternal antibodies or to a very severe infection in such young kittens (one of them had severe lymphocytosis of 91%). The other two (also females) had vesicular lesions in the oral mucosa, which could have been caused by secondary infections. The possibility of infection by FIP virus was investigated in these four cats, both serologically with sera 90 days apart (only in the last two cats), and clinically.

As regards \u03b12\u2010globulin, statistically significant differences were also seen between FeLV+ cats and non\u2010infected cats. Most \u03b11 and \u03b12 proteins are acute phase proteins, considered to be markers for acute inflammatory disease, infection or neoplastic and traumatic disorders (Duthie et al., 1997; Pocacqua et al., 2005). An increase in these fractions is an indicator of tissue damage and can be attributed to the fact that the pathogen induces an acute phase response in the host, as reported in FIP (Giordano et al., 2004) or in canine leishmaniosis (Mir\u00f3 and Fraile, 1999). One of these acute phase proteins, \u03b11\u2010acid\u2010glycoprotein or AGP, is considered as immunomodulator, and it has diagnostic value in FIP (Duthie et al., 1997; Kajikawa et al., 1999). It has been reported to be increased in FIV infections (Duthie et al., 1997), which would mean that FIV\u2010positive cats would have elevated \u03b1\u2010proteins in the serum, a fact we did not observe. In the present study, cats were not in the terminal stage of the disease (as were the cats in Duthie's study) which may account for this discrepancy.

The plasma electrophoretogram is useful for assessing the initial clinical status, and could be a valuable tool to determine the clinical course of the disease, during and after suitable therapy. High gammaproteins, as seen in FIV\u2010infection, should alert about an increase in the humoral immune response, probably reflecting the uncontrolled replication of the virus and higher presence in the bloodstream. Acute phase proteins, which migrate in the \u03b1\u2010globulins fractions, are indicative of microbial infection or following inflammatory stimulus, and also in neoplastic and traumatic disorders, and they are helpful as indicators in clinical diagnosis. After empirical treatment, such as with interferon (De Mari et al., 2004), it would be advisable to follow\u2010up these parameters, to assess the results objectively, economically and easily.
