Three of four patients were previously healthy and immunocompetent. One patient had complex comorbidities, including hemochromatosis, type 1 diabetes mellitus, stiff person syndrome (a rare autoimmune disorder of progressive muscle rigidity), and Addison\u2019s disease. All patients required tracheal intubation and mechanical lung ventilation for hypoxemic (patient C) or mixed hypoxemic/hypercapneic (patients A, B, D) respiratory failure. On admission to the intensive care unit, the patients were hemodynamically unstable requiring vasopressor support, with APACHE II scores ranging from 18-26. The patients initially received antimicrobial therapy for community-acquired bacterial pneumonia at local emergency departments or nursing stations. Upon arrival at the tertiary facility, bronchoscopy with bronchoalveolar lavage was performed. Wet mount microscopy of respiratory samples showed yeast morphology consistent with B. dermatitidis, subsequently confirmed by culture. Accordingly, in patients A-C, liposomal intravenous amphotericin B 5 mg\u00b7kg\u22121\u00b7day\u22121 was initiated within the first 48 hr of hospital care. Patient D was given conventional amphotericin B infusion 1 mg\u00b7kg\u22121\u00b7day\u22121 commencing at hour 78. Three of four patients received systemic corticosteroids (Methylprednisone 40-60 mg every six hours) within the first 48 hr of mechanical ventilation. Additional baseline characteristics are summarized in Table 1.\n",

A low tidal volume ventilation strategy (5-8 mL\u00b7kg\u22121 of predicted body weight) with permissive hypercapnia was used. Life-threatening hypoxemia, acidosis, and injurious airway pressures developed despite 100% FiO2 (patients A-D), neuromuscular blockade (patients A-D), inhaled nitric oxide at 20 ppm (patients A and D), and prone positioning (patient D) (Table 2). In two cases, these conditions prompted dispatch of an aeromedical ECMO transport team, consisting of a cardiothoracic surgeon, perfusionist, critical care nurse, and critical care fellow, to facilitate ECMO cannulation in the peripheral hospital. In the remaining cases, the cannulation procedure was performed on-site at the ECMO facility.\n\n",

One of two circuit configurations was selected at the cardiothoracic surgeon\u2019s discretion (Table 1). The bi-femoral configuration consisted of drainage via the left common femoral vein (LCFV) with return via a long single-stage right common femoral vein cannula directed to the atrial-caval junction. The right internal jugular configuration consisted of a single 31Fr bicaval dual-lumen catheter (Avalon Laboratories, Rancho Dominguez, CA, USA) capable of drainage via the superior and inferior venae cavae and return via the right atrial inlet. In either configuration, an additional venous drainage catheter could be added at an available site to achieve adequate flows and oxygenation, if required. The circuit was connected to a BioMedicus\u00ae 540 centrifugal pump (Medtronic, Minneapolis, MN, USA) and a Maquet QUADROX-iD oxygenator/heat exchanger (MAQUET Cardiovascular, San Jose, CA, USA). The circuits were heparin coated and primed with Lactated Ringer\u2019s solution 600 mL at room temperature. The cannula position was confirmed via transthoracic or transesophageal echocardiography and chest radiography. Following confirmation of adequate flow and favourable gas exchange on ECMO, inspired FiO2 was weaned and lung rest settings were applied to facilitate peak inspiratory pressures < 30 cm H2O, PEEP 10-15 cm H2O, and respiratory rate ~10 breaths\u00b7min\u22121, as described in the CESAR trial.9 Weaning from extracorporeal support was considered after a global assessment of disease resolution based on chest radiography, respiratory mechanics and work of breathing, and adequacy of gas exchange while delivering a lung protective ventilation strategy. At this point, a weaning trial of extracorporeal FiO2 and/or ECMO blood flow was initiated prior to release from ECMO.",

This facilitated reductions in tidal volume and PEEP which resulted in significantly lower airway pressures. Vasopressor requirements, hemodynamic parameters, and serum lactate levels also improved within 24 hr of ECMO support. In three cases, continuous venovenous hemodiafiltration was incorporated into the ECMO circuit due to acute kidney injury and volume overload. This facilitated achievement of a negative fluid balance and recruitment of the native lung. A timeline of in-hospital events is presented in Fig. 2. The duration of ECMO ranged from seven to 23 days (Table 4). Patients A, B, and D were relieved of mechanical ventilation at 18-25 days and were subsequently discharged with a Cerebral Performance Category 1 score obtained via chart review. Patient C sustained a 15-min cardiac arrest due to tension pneumothorax seven days after ECMO decannulation. Despite targeted temperature management, the patient experienced an anoxic cerebral injury that required prolonged rehabilitation. Three months later, the patient returned home and was independent with several activities of daily living.

All patients in this series had severely impaired gas exchange, reduced pulmonary compliance, and rapid deterioration despite respiratory support consistent with the standard of care. Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation facilitated improved gas exchange, as evidenced by increased PaO2/FiO2 ratios and normalization of pH and PaCO2, and allowed lung rest as shown by reductions in potentially injurious airway pressures. Although the therapy was resource intensive and necessitated prolonged admissions to hospital and the intensive care unit, in all four cases, ECMO decannulation was performed, mechanical ventilation was withdrawn, and the patients were discharged home with acceptable quality of life. These outcomes are exceptional given the uniquely high mortality of blastomycosis-related ARDS.",

Maintaining a lung protective ventilation strategy may have greater clinical importance in this setting due to the pathologic severity of blastomycosis-related ARDS.2\n",

First, diagnoses were made relatively early due to high clinical suspicion and experienced laboratory personnel. Accordingly, appropriate antimicrobial agents were instituted early in the clinical course. It is well established that the administration of early appropriate antimicrobials reduces mortality in septic shock.17 Second, ECMO support was initiated within 72 hr in all patients. Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation may confer greater therapeutic benefit in ARDS when initiated within seven days.8,18 In addition, three patients in this series received early systemic corticosteroids, a therapy which may limit the inflammatory response and possibly reduce mortality in blastomycosis-related ARDS,4 although controlled studies are lacking. Finally, all patients in our cohort were cannulated with venovenous ECMO configurations. Previous attempts at veno-arterial ECMO in blastomycosis-related ARDS may have been less efficacious due to reduced pulmonary blood flow in this configuration.14\n",

Although ECMO flows upon peripheral cannulation were 4-5 L\u00b7min\u22121, this would not have matched patients\u2019 cardiac output prior to cannulation in the setting of septic shock,19 nor would ECMO be expected to deliver direct improvement in hemodynamics in a venovenous configuration. Thus, we speculate that ECMO indirectly improved hemodynamics by improving oxygen delivery to vital organs and restoring physiologic acid-base balance.
