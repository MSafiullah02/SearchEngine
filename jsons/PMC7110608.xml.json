            "text": "PDD has long been suspected to be a viral disease based on epidemiologic observations, its apparent infectious nature, the typical lesions associated with it, and by ruling out other possible causes.5, 14, 15 Several researchers have attempted to identify the PDD virus using standard virological methods such as culture and electron microscopy (EM). Initially, a virus was recovered from macaws suffering from serositis, and that was later identified as the Eastern equine encephalitis virus, which was suggested to be the candidate causative agent of PDD.23, 24 However, further research did not support this hypothesis.7, 14 Pleomorphic virus-like particles of variable size (30\u2013250 nm) have also been described in tissues of affected birds by EM.25 These particles were suspected to be of the genus avian paramyxovirus (APMV); however, birds affected by PDD have been shown to lack antibodies against APMV of serotypes 1 to 4, 6, and 7, as well as against avian herpes viruses, polyomavirus, and avian encephalitis virus.5, 6 In studies from Germany, APMV-1, closely related to the Hitchner B1 vaccine strain, was isolated from the spinal cords of around 20% of patients with PDD; however, these isolates showed very low pathogenicity and failed to reproduce the disease in African gray parrots.26, 27 Other virus species that have been sporadically documented in tissues or excretions of affected birds include an adeno-like virus, enterovirus, coronavirus, and reovirus.6, 7, 28, 29\n",

In 2008, Kistler and colleagues11 and Honkavuori and colleagues34 independently reported on the recovery of a novel Bornavirus from birds with PDD from the United States and Israel. This virus is now designated avian Bornavirus (ABV). Based on 16 ABV isolates, 5 distinct genotypes were identified, each sharing only around 65% nucleotide sequence identity with previously known members of the Bornaviridae family (all originating from mammalian hosts), and around 85% with other ABV genotypes.11\n",

The placement of Bornaviruses within a separate family (Bornaviridae) was based on several unique characteristics of their genome and mechanism of replication, most notably that they replicate in the host-cell nucleus rather than in its cytoplasm.35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40 Before the discovery of ABV, the single known species within this family was the Borna disease virus (BDV). Borna disease is an encephalitic disease found in horses, sheep, and occasionally other domesticated mammals. The disease was first described in the early nineteenth century in Southeast Germany and has since remained endemic in that area. Many additional species, including the chicken (Gallus gallus), are susceptible to BDV infection under experimental conditions, with the outcome ranging from severe encephalomyelitis to persistent asymptomatic infection.37 The lesions seen with BDV are the result of neural invasion by T CD8+ lymphocytes rather than virus-inflicted cellular damage.38\n",

Partial sequence analysis has shown the canary ABV strain to be closely related to ABV5.20 Although most of the recoveries of ABV so far have been from clinically affected birds, asymptomatic infection and long-term virus shedding have also been identified and likely play an important role in the epidemiology of PDD.22, 43, 45, 48\n",

Distention of the proventriculus by gas alone is not typical of PDD. Proventricular diameter has been shown to increase over time in Spix macaws with PDD and has been suggested to be a useful indicator for performing crop biopsy.12 Other GI compartments that may be distended include the crop, ventriculus, and small intestine; however, none of these findings are specific for PDD. The degree of distention of the various GI parts varies among birds with PDD, some showing changes only in the intestine or crop. A relatively large proventriculus may be seen in some healthy eclectus parrots, while distention of the proventriculus and crop can be physiologic in neonate birds.51, 54\n",

In cases where the findings are equivocal or when the overall clinical picture does not fit well with PDD, positive contrast studies may be indicated (Fig. 8\n). The technique for performing GI contrast studies in psittacine birds has been previously described.55, 56 After the birds have been fasted for 4 hours, contrast material is introduced into the crop by gavage. Some investigators recommend dosing the patient at 25 to 50 mL/kg; however, the use of 10 to 15 mL/kg is often sufficient and reduces the risk of regurgitation and aspiration. Either barium sulfate or iodine-based contrast media may be used. Barium sulfate generally provides better and longer-lasting positive contrast compared with iodine-based products, but can cause airway irritation if accidentally aspirated and should be avoided if GI perforation is suspected. The use of barium also necessitates any GI surgery (eg, for collecting a crop biopsy) to be delayed until its complete clearance. Contrast studies may be performed with the patient anesthetized or awake. Although the disadvantages of anesthetizing the patient multiple times are obvious (increased anesthetic risk, risk of aspiration, altering GI motility), images obtained from an awake bird (eg, placed in a cardboard box or on a perch) may not always be sufficiently diagnostic. In many cases, a combination of both options may prove most practical, that is, most of the images are obtained with the bird awake, and the bird is anesthetized for a short period of time to achieve correct positioning, only once or twice, at well-chosen time points.",

After administration by gavage of 5 to 10 mL/kg barium sulfate mixed 1:1 with commercial hand-feeding formula, the awake bird is placed in a cardboard box or on a perch and observed intermittently with the fluoroscope until the barium reaches its cloaca. The main advantage of fluoroscopy compared with standard contrast studies is that it provides real-time views of the GI motility. Knowing the normal motility patterns is obviously necessary for the detection of changes. In the normal psittacine bird, boluses of ingesta can be clearly seen leaving the crop and traveling along the thoracic esophagus to the proventriculus. These boluses usually occur at an approximate rate of 1 bolus per minute, and should be unidirectional with no significant amount of barium remaining in the esophagus between boluses. The motility of the proventriculus is less pronounced than that of other GI parts, but every few minutes a large contraction followed by partial emptying into the ventriculus should be seen. Little or no proventricular motility may be present in patients with PDD with a grossly distended proventriculus. Most striking of all are the changes in normal ventricular motility seen with PDD. Because of the sequenced contraction of the thick and thin muscle pairs of its wall, a constant washing machine-like turning effect is produced and should be clearly visible in the lateral view of a healthy bird. In patients with PDD this pattern may be completely missing, often being replaced by a shallow and irregular flutter of the ventricular wall. The latter finding is the likely cause of failure of the mechanical food grinding action of the ventriculus, leading to the passing of whole seeds in the feces of patients with PDD. Peristalsis of the small intestine is bidirectional in psittacine species, with waves traveling down to the cecal remnants and back up to the pylorus. Some patients with PDD may show very fast and erratic peristaltic activity and an increase in duodenal diameter, whereas in others motility may be slower than usual. As with other imaging techniques, fluoroscopy findings should be regarded suggestive, but not confirmative, for PDD. Unfortunately, this useful technique requires costly equipment; therefore, it is not readily available to many private practitioners.",

The skin is then incised along the ventral midline or slightly to the left of it, and the crop wall is exposed by undermining and retracting the skin laterally. The ventral portion of the crop is freed from its fascial attachments and lifted gently. Some investigators suggest that the cranial portion of the left lateral sac of the crop be preferred as the surgical site, because this area is less subject to stress and iatrogenic injury by feeding tubes.57, 59 The biopsy should include a prominent blood vessel (Fig. 9\n), because this increases the chances of obtaining nerve sections.54, 57 Stay sutures may be placed cranially and caudally to the biopsy site, which should measure no less than 12 mm at its long axis (ie, along the blood vessel). It is advisable to obtain an elliptical rather than a round biopsy (eg, 12 \u00d7 8 mm), because this enables later identification of the biopsy's original orientation. A second, smaller piece of about 2 \u00d7 2 mm should be collected in a sterile container and kept frozen for RT-PCR testing (see later discussion). The crop incision is closed in a continuous inverted (eg, Cushing's) pattern, using synthetic absorbable suture material, and the skin is closed routinely.",

Based on the limited information available to date, brain, crop, proventriculus, ventriculus, and adrenal glands appear to be the most consistent sites for postmortem detection of ABV RNA.34, 42, 43, 44, 45 Some birds may have ABV RNA present in most major organs, as well as in the plasma,43, 45 whereas others show a more restricted distribution pattern. Therefore, it is important to test several tissue types (brain and stomachs at the least). Specimens that may be tested for ABV RNA antemortem include crop tissue, blood, choanal and cloacal swabs, and feces. Unfortunately, preliminary data show that ABV-infected birds are not consistently viremic43, 45 and shed the virus only intermittently in their saliva/feces, and that crop tissue may test ABV-negative in some patients with PDD.43, 45 Furthermore, some naturally infected birds have been reported to shed the virus without obvious clinical signs.43, 45 One such cockatiel has had ABV RNA present in 90% of its choanal and cloacal swabs during a period of 110 days43 and has remained asymptomatic for at least 1 year thereafter (A.Y. Gancz, unpublished data, 2005\u20132010). These findings suggest that false-negative and false-positive results may occur when attempting to determine a bird's PDD status based on RT-PCR.",

The protein from the bird's brain was extracted and used to test other sera from birds with PDD and from control birds, with promising results.60 Similarly, Lierz and colleagues45 have used Western blot to test sera from symptomatic and asymptomatic ABV-positive birds. Recombinant ABV N and P proteins, as well as BDV N and P proteins, were used rather than brain extracts, and similar antibody responses were detected, regardless of the birds' clinical status. The strongest reaction was to the recombinant ABV N protein, showing minimal cross-reactivity with BDV N. Responses to both P proteins were relatively weak and variable. It was concluded that serology could not differentiate between patients with PDD and asymptomatic ABV carriers.

When used for the diagnosis of PDD, false-positive as well as false-negative results are possible. The tests may detect the ABV status of a bird correctly, but cannot be directly correlated to the patient's clinical status. Therefore, the definitive diagnosis of PDD in the single patient continues to be based on histology, with PCR, serology, and IHC results as supporting evidence (Fig. 11\n). The advantage of these tests is that they offer for the first time practical tools for screening birds for the causative agent of PDD. The optimal screening protocol (eg, serology vs PCR of several swabs collected serially) is yet to be determined. However, it is hoped that these tests greatly improve our ability to clear flocks from ABV and by that significantly reducing the incidence of PDD.",

The COX-1 protein is constitutively expressed (ie, it is present under normal conditions and does not need to be induced) and is involved in the maintenance of homeostatic conditions. For example, COX-1 plays a role in blood clotting and elicits a protective role in organs such as the GI tract. The COX-2 protein, on the other hand, is inducible and is involved in the immediate early gene response to various stimuli such as cytokines, growth factors, and ultraviolet light. Older NSAIDs such as aspirin, ibuprofen, and flurbiprofen, inhibit both forms of COX and are referred to as nonselective NSAIDs. Newer NSAIDs, such as celecoxib and rofexocib, are selective for COX-2 and are referred to as selective COX-2 inhibitors.61, 62, 63, 64\n",

In vitro experiments showed that the effect of COX inhibition was at least partially mediated by increased production of nitric oxide, a molecule that is known to inhibit VSV replication.

The best results were found in group 3, in which lesions typical of PDD were not found in any of the 14 birds. These results may be attributable to the extruded diet readily absorbing the medication, attributable to its hypoallergenic nature and an enhanced efficacy of tepoxalin on this diet, or possibly because the species in group 3 were easier to treat effectively compared with the species in groups 1 and 2. Palm cockatoos (Probosciger aterrimus) were found to be particularly difficult to treat effectively, accounting for 7 out of 8 cases of treatment failure. Palm cockatoos and hyacinth macaws (Anodorhyncus hyacinthinus) consume much of their calories through nuts and seeds, making consistent dosing difficult.67 In these species, some sort of soft or fresh food, such as fruits and vegetables, should be used as a vehicle for administration of the medication.",

The diet should be easily digestible, because ventricular and proventricular function is adversely affected by PDD. Liquid diets and pelleted diets have been developed specifically for birds with PDD, and juvenile hand-feeding formulas can also be used for initial nutritional therapy. Formulated diets are ideal because they are easier to digest than seeds; however, extreme caution should be used in converting an ill bird from a seed-based diet to a formulated diet.

Antioxidants including oils, specific amino acids, and minerals, and some natural herbal anti-inflammatory agents may be beneficial. A balance of omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acids has proved to be beneficial in many inflammatory diseases. Salmon oil, flax seed oil, and safflower oil are used as sources of omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acids. Fatty acid supplementation is provided at 50 to 250 mg/kg BW of omega-3 fatty acids with an omega-3:omega-6 ratio of 1:2 to 1:6. If the bird is primarily on a seed diet, which is naturally high in omega-6 fatty acids, supplementation with salmon oil and flax seed oil helps to correct the omega-3:omega-6 ratio. Nutritional adjuncts to therapy that may be beneficial in cases with CNS signs include Ginkgo biloba, vitamin E, alpha-lipoic acid, acetyl-l-carnitine, and B-complex vitamins.

With this observation in mind, the obvious goals of PDD prevention are: (a) to avoid introducing the pathogen into new flocks and (b) to clear it from flocks where it is already present. However, until recently these goals were nearly impossible to achieve due to the disease's long incubation period and because its cause was unknown. Even facilities that quarantined all new arrivals for extended periods of time and facilities that performed crop biopsies on all of their birds were not completely safe from PDD. Now, with the discovery of ABV and the development of molecular and serologic assays for its detection, it is hoped that this situation will change.",
