The disease is pathologically characterized by almost complete myelin loss, reactive astrocytosis and the appearance of characteristic large round cells called globoid cells in the white matter of the CNS.1 Diseases identical to GLD have been reported in several animal species:2 dogs,3, 4 sheep,5 rhesus monkeys6, 7 and cats.8, 9, 10 GLD is defined by the deficiency of a lysosomal enzyme, galactocerebrosidase (GALC), resulting in the accumulation of a cytotoxic metabolite, psychosine.1 GALC\u2010deficient mice, such as Twitcher mice,11, 12 are being used as experimental GLD models.13 Besides GALC, the deficiency of saposin A, 14 one of the sphingolipid activator proteins, also causes an identical disease to GLD in mice15 and humans.10 While GALC mutation was found in dogs16 and rhesus monkeys.17 To date, there have been only three reports of the disease in cats,8, 9, 10 indicating that the disease is extremely rare in cats. These previous reports on feline GLD revealed histopathological features characterized by symmetrical myelin loss, astrocytosis and perivascular accumulation of large macrophages with intracytoplasmic deposits (globoid cells).",
