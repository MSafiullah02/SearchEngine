            "text": "The Dermatologist's Perspective: Why is COVID-19 mortality lower in females than males? 2 Dedee F. Murrell, M.D. 1 The current COVID-19 pandemic is upon us, and factors that are contributing to the 8 mortality in apparently healthy people are yet not understood. The epidemiologic statistics 9 from the source at Wuhan and death rates in Iran, Italy and Spain reveal almost double 10 mortality in men over women. (1, 2, 3) 11 Some of these excess deaths are attributed to the increased prevalence of smoking amongst 12 men in China and the attendant co-morbidities associated with chronic smoking, but in the 13 European Union many women smoke as well, yet the mortality is still much higher in men. 14 (1) Could estrogen have a role? 15 We know that the COVID-19 virus uses its spike protein to gain entry to cells, via the 16 Angiotensin Converting Enzyme-2 (ACE-2) protein, a receptor for the virus which is 17 expressed on a number of tissues in humans, including the mucosal linings of the heart, 18 kidneys lungs, oral cavity and eyes. (4) 19 The expression of ACE-2 is reduced by estrogen, whilst it is increased by testosterone. ",
