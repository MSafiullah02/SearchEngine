Simulation can also reach individuals wherever they are during mobilization for disaster relief in remote areas, including team training of individuals even before the team is geographically assembled. GHS training must balance the use of technology, with its probable absence in operational environments. This is analogous to the U.S. Department of Defense (DOD) military services and others who operate in remote and austere environments where technology, including telementoring and decision support tools, may not be available.

To prepare GHS responders to meet these challenges, various organizations and universities have developed competencies for healthcare responders. In 2008 the American Medical Association published a consensus-based and multidisciplinary educational framework for disaster medicine and public health preparedness defining 19 core competencies. Healthcare responders were assigned to three levels of proficiency: Informed worker/student, practitioner, and leader. This approximates the ascending levels of application and synthesis of knowledge in Bloom's taxonomy of learning [20] . Core disaster competencies aligned with the six levels of proficiency established in Blooms taxonomy have been proposed by others also [19, 21] . attempts to present educational and evaluation problems authentically. Learners are required to respond to the problems as he or she would under natural circumstances. High fidelity medical simulations facilitate learning under the right conditions of: 1) providing feedback 2) repetitive practice 3) curriculum integration 4) a range of difficulty 5) multiple learning strategies 6) a controlled environment 7) individualized learning; 8) defined outcomes 9) and simulator validity. These conditions maximize the impact of simulation-based training [23] .",

Simulation enables learners to progress from just knowing information to being able to apply it in actual situations through deliberate practice. Some professionals develop faster than others and continue to improve during the ensuing years. These individuals are eventually recognized as experts. In contrast, many professionals reach a stable, average level performance within a relatively short timeframe and maintain this status for the rest of their careers. Expert performance requires continued deliberate practice for maintenance of high performance. Deliberate practice has been found to be key factor in maintaining expert levels as performers reach older ages. Most expert musicians have spent over 10,000 h of practice which is 5000 h more than less accomplished groups of musicians. A sufficient amount of weekly delivered practices been shown to allow expert pianists in their 50s and 60s to maintain their piano performances at a comparable level to that of young experts.

Simulation requires an instructional design framework to assist educators in creating appropriate simulation learning experiences. Simulation includes vastly different educational modalities. The framework for simulation instructional design has four domains:(1) Instructional medium; (2) simulation modality; (3) instructional method; (4) presentation. Each simulation modality is best suited for specific competency domains and learning outcomes. The choices within each domain are based on a matrix of simulation relating the severity of possible outcomes to the frequency of events, with a corresponding optimal \"Zone of simulation matrix\" [46] .",

Several concepts associated with fidelity are more useful in explaining educational effectiveness, such as transfer of learning, learner engagement, and suspension of disbelief. It is been proposed to abandon the term fidelity in SBT and replace it with terms reflecting the underlying primary concepts of physical resemblance and functional task alignment, and shift from the current physical emphasis or emphasis on physical resemblance to a focus on functional correspondence between the simulator and applied context [63] .",

Novice pilots can become overwhelmed with total fidelity. This is because initially novice pilots must first familiarize themselves with the look, shape, location, and feel the actual devices in the cockpit and in the memorization and execution of emergency procedures. It can therefore be deduced that high fidelity is desired in simulation-based assessment devices that attempt to predicted expert performance in real-world situations.

Scenarios can be reset rerun within seconds to maximize the resource availability and cost effectiveness, enabling participants to perform and gain an understanding of multiple key roles. The ability to record and playback the scenarios from a point of view of each participant enables accurate and structured debriefing, either by expert facilitators or peers, which is difficult to achieve in a large-scale live or tabletop exercise. Virtual worlds also have the advantage of replicating exactly out location resources in a healthcare facility.

VR is an effective training platform for rare GHS incidents where high level performance is critical, but difficult to rehearse, such as CBRNE incidents [81] . A VR hybrid approach has been successfully used to simulate Ebola treatment centers. By immersion in a highly realistic Ebola treatment center projected on the wall, learners advance to accomplish competency-based specific operational skills by using real equipment and performing procedures on manikins. This hybrid simulation model provides trainees opportunities to integrate different evaluation methodologies, such as using fluorescent liquid or powder under ultraviolet light to measure the degree of exposure, and video cameras for education replay and educational analysis [86] .",

Educational game design and development is a process of defining learning and assessment goals, determining what is needed to achieve those goals, developing an appropriate simulation, and validating its effectiveness. The methodology often used is the ADDIE instructional design model of analysis, design, development, improvement, and evaluate. Portions of the methodology may require a compromise between educators and developers because instruction and assessment requirements may dictate selection of a particular genre platform. Learning outcomes from simulations also depend how well the domain instruction is integrated into the simulation due to cognitive load theory. Cognitive load is the total amount of mental activity imposed on working memory at a point in time. Extraneous cognitive load is a load caused by any unnecessary stimuli. These are key design considerations when designing educational games [113] . Achieving the proper balance between entertainment and instruction in a game is essential and can be difficult to attain. Serious games are an experiential activity, rather than a presentation requiring memorization of facts. Learning goals and gameplay are often not disclosed to the user. Often the user learns by playing the game, where discovery in itself may be part of the gameplay [114] .",

Game development requires expertise in GHS, education, and technology development to create the complex design, modeling, and scoring required to make an effective game. Game development can be costly and require lengthy development time. Proposed frameworks for game development have been proposed using a three-phase development process. The first phase is preparation and design. This includes identifying and funding the appropriate members needed to develop the technical components i.e. game developers, GHS content subject matter experts, and users. A development schedule to include frequent meeting should be agreed upon. The second component in this phase is a subject matter concepts transfer. The SMEs demonstrate how to perform tasks, allowing game developers to ask questions and take notes and photographs for reference. One of the key challenges in game development is difficulty conveying expert concepts to nonexpert developers. Concepts transfer helps orient the game developers to the information to be shared or used in the game. Content production, including any necessary physiological modeling incorporating existing evidence, guidelines, and expert derived algorithms is completed during this phase with storyboards describing the flow and required functionality of the game. The second phase is development of wireframes, which are illustrations of proposed game components and assist in visual communication design of the structure, functionality, and learner interface. The third phase is a formative evaluation. This starts with usability testing to identify content, design, functionality, and usability problems with the game, and should include both subject matter experts and end-users. After usability testing is complete and all edits have been made, the final product is delivered for beta testing [115] .",
