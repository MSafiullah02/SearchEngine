An in vitro infection-based system including the highly attenuated vaccinia virus Ankara strain expressing the T7 RNA polymerase from bacteriophage T7, with co-transfection of three helper plasmids and a full-length cDNA plasmid, was successfully developed to rescue genetically modified Newcastle disease viruses in 1999. In this chapter, the materials and the methods involved in rescuing Newcastle disease virus (NDV) from cDNA, utilizing site-directed mutagenesis and gene replacement techniques, are described in detail.",

Thereafter, this MVA was used to generate the MVA/T7 that expresses the RNA polymerase gene from bacteriophage T7 [36] . The MVA/T7 system has been used by several research groups to recover infectious clones of genetically modified NDV for multiple applications [12, 14, 17-19, 39, 40] .",

Next, the multiple overlapping fragments are sequentially cloned together, either through compatible restriction site ligation or through the use of a cloning kit, into a modified low-copynumber plasmid containing a T7 polymerase promoter, the sequence of the hepatitis delta virus ribozyme (HDV Rz) and the T7 terminator; the multi-cloning site (MCS) is located between the T7 polymerase promoter and the HDV Rz, where the amplified cDNA will be inserted [12, 18, 40, 41] . The HDV Rz will generate precise 3\u2032 ends by auto cleavability and ensure the appropriate size of the viral genome, complying with the rule of six [3, 42] (i.e., genome size must be a multiple of six nucleotides; Fig. 1 ). The full-length cDNA plasmids can be used as a backbone to delete genes, replace or insert foreign genes into NDV genome to study their function, and/or to create recombinant vaccine vectors [12-15, 19, 25, 28, 39] . Once the full-length antigenome plasmid has been constructed, viral rescue ensues. As mentioned above, this system requires infection of the mammalian cell line (Hep-2) with MVA/ T7, which will express and produce the T7 RNA polymerase. Infected cells will then be co-transfected with the full-length cDNA plasmid and the three helper plasmids. The T7 RNA polymerase will bind the promoters on the helper plasmids and on the fulllength cDNA to start transcription and translation for virus replication and assembly.",

As all RNA viruses mutate easily, sequencing and cDNA amplification may yield products that represent an average quasispecies rather than a functional virus. This may explain why sometimes scientists cannot fully rescue the phenotype of a wild-type virus by reverse genetics. Our experience demonstrates that utilizing plaque-purified viruses as starting material, in general leads to recombinant viruses with phenotypes that are indistinguishable from wild-type viruses. Plaque purification also helps to eliminate any possibility of mixed virus population with varying genotypes or virulence.",

Let incubate for 3-5 min at 37 \u00b0C (in the cell culture incubator) until the cells detach. Tap the sides of the flask to help with the detachment. 8.

Apply carefully in a dropwise fashion so as not to disrupt the cell monolayer. Rock the plates gently to evenly distribute the inoculum. 6. Incubate for 1 h at 37 \u00b0C under a 5% CO 2 atmosphere, rocking the plates every 15 min. 7. While the infection is ongoing, prepare the DNA complexes and Lipofectamine mixtures. (a) DNA complexes: Mix each cDNA with helper plasmids (NP, P, and L) at a ratio of 1:0.5:0.25:0.1 [full-length NDV cDNA (1 \u03bcg): NP (0.5 \u03bcg): P (0.25 \u03bcg):L (0.1 \u03bcg)] in 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tubes. After all four plasmid DNAs have been mixed together, bring volume up to 250 \u03bcL with Opti-MEM. (b) Lipofectamine: Gently mix Lipofectamine \u00ae 2000 (Invitrogen) by inverting the tube. Mix 4 \u03bcL with up to 250 \u03bcL of Opti-MEM, mix gently by inverting the tube, and incubate at room temperature for 5 min.(c) DNA-Lipofectamine mixtures: Add 250 \u03bcL of Lipofectamine mixture to each DNA complex, mix gently, and incubate at room temp for 20 min.",
