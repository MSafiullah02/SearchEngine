It is produced enzymatically as a side product of protein synthesis catalyzed predominantly by aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases [1]. Ap4A has been proposed to be an intracellular \u201calarmone\u201d both in prokaryotes [2] and in eukaryotes [3]. Intracellularly it affects DNA repair [4], RNA processing, cell division [5], heat shock and oxidative stress [6], [7], apoptosis [8], [9] and transcriptional regulation [1]. In bacteria, Ap4A levels may also play a role in invasion [10], [11]. In addition, as an extracellular signaling molecule, Ap4A may play an important role as a neurotransmitter in the cardiovascular system [12], [13].",

            "text": "Ap4A hydrolase is responsible for metabolizing the \u201callarmone\u201d nucleotide Ap4A and is therefore involved in all the above biological processes. Recent evidence further implicates that the SARS-CoV 7a protein interacts with human Ap4A-hydrolase and may participate in common pathways leading to cell cycle arrest and apoptosis [15]. Ap4A hydrolase belongs to Nudix (nucleoside diphosphate linked to X) hydrolases, a superfamily of Mg2+-dependent enzymes which catalyze the hydrolysis of nucleoside diphosphates linked to other moieties, X, and contains the conserved Nudix sequnce GX5EX7REUXEEXGU (where U represents a bulky aliphatic residue usually Ile, Leu or Val, and X represents any residue) [16]. It is characterized as cleaving the polyphosphate chain at the fourth phosphate from the bound adenosine moiety. According to phylogenetic analysis [17], Ap4A hydrolases were classified into two distinct groups, animal-archaeal type and plant-bacterial type enzymes. The latter contain loop insertions that undergo a large translation on substrate binding and exhibit substantial dynamic changes [18]. Previous studies of Ap4A structures from both groups revealed that the enzyme has the \u03b1\u03b2\u03b1-sandwich architecture of a Nudix fold [18], [19], [20]. However, these studies suggest that important differences exist in the binding sites between animal-archaeal type and plant-bacterial type enzymes. According to the analysis of the NMR structure of human Ap4A hydrolase (E58A), a proposal suggests recognition trigger is not required as the side chains of some key residues are on average predisposed with the correct orientation to unite key interactions for binding [19].",

The first residue of the Nudix motif, Gly43, is on \u03b24 and anchored by intrasheet hydrogen bonds to Cys6 of \u03b21. Arg57, a conserved residue in the Nudix hydrolases, is involved in salt links with Glu49 and Glu58. Glu62, another signature residue, helps to orient Glu110 to bind a sulfate ion by making hydrogen binds to the side chain of Glu110. At the other end of the motif, Gly64 of loop L5 makes a hydrogen bond to Arg106 carbonyl O atom of loop L7. Most of the non-conserved residues of the Nudix sequence are solvent-exposed and point away from the substrate binding cleft. However Leu52 and Leu56 help to stabilize the helix \u03b11 on the central sheet by making hydrophobic interactions with some hydrophobic amino acids from strands \u03b21, \u03b25 and \u03b26.

            "text": "One of the monomers (chain B) in the wild-type enzyme has another sulfate ion near the Nudix sequence motif in the substrate-binding pocket, where its oxygen atoms are at hydrogen-bonding distance from the side chain ND1 and the main-chain amide of His44, OE2 of Glu110, OE1 and OE2 of Glu58. In monomer A, the equivalent position is most likely a sulfate although a water molecule was modeled in the density. In contrast, there is no relevant density in this region in monomers C and D, and the residues His44 and Glu110 show a different conformation compared to that in monomers A and B. In addition, inspection of the active site shows there is sufficient flexibility in the location of \u03b2- and \u03b3-phosphates between the two sulfate ions sites. Thus, this sulfate position is most likely close to the substrate \u03b4-phosphate binding site. Consequently, the sulfate is at a distance of about 3.8\u223c5 \u00c5 from some other Nudix signature sequence residues Arg57, Clu61 and Glu62. Probably due to the lack of magnesium ions, this sulfate position is closer to the Nudix sequence motif than the proposed \u03b4-phosphate binding site in the crystal structure of C. elegans counterpart (Fig. 2D). This observation of the sulfate would suggest these residues (His44, Arg57, Glu58, Clu61, Glu62 and Glu110) are sufficient to stabilize the substrate and orientate the \u03b4-phosphate by hydrogen bond or via metal coordination for nuclophilic attack.",
