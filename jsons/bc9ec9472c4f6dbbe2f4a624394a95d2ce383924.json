Epidemiology is not a science with a clearly defined field of application in contrast to anatomy or gastroenterology, which target specific parts or aspects of the human body. Rather it is a scientific method which can be applied to a broad range of health and medical problems, from infectious diseases to health care. Epidemiology is a constantly changing field of science, because new questions arise in population health and new statistical techniques are developed and adapted from other sciences. In times of modern information technologies and high-speed computers, new opportunities arise for data collection and storage on a large scale and for application of advanced bio-informatic and modelling techniques. In the era of globalization, many health problems are relevant on a global scale and intervention strategies have to be developed on an international level. In particular, for infectious disease epidemiology, global spread is increasingly important as demonstrated by the spread of the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and the pandemic spread of influenza A.",

Epidemiology also includes the study of associations between specific diseases and factors to which populations are exposed. In this way, risk factors or protective factors which are associated with a health status of an individual or with some conditions can be identified. These associations can be identified because risk factors and diseases are not randomly distributed in populations but rather there are population groups where some diseases and associated factors occur more often than in other population groups.

Later the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) was characterised in the laboratory as the cause of the disease and an antibody test was developed. Epidemiological studies had to a certain extent a filter function for gaining insight into this new infectious disease by sorting a wide set of potential aetiological factors and elucidating the infectious nature of the disease. This hypothesis was then checked in the laboratory and proven through the identification of the infectious agent. Thereafter, epidemiology had not lost its important role in the investigation of the HIV epidemic.

The natural history of HIV infection in its initial stages is characterized by acute retroviral syndrome, which is accompanied by fever, substantial viral pathology and viremia, followed by a long-lasting latent period, where a relative equilibrium between HIV and the immune system of the infected individual exists despite active viral replication. Following an early clinical stage, full-blown AIDS may develop, which is marked by a collapse of the immune system.

At the centre of the focus of infectious disease epidemiology is the relationship between an infectious agent and its host, its routes of transmission and the environment in which transmission takes place. In contrast with non-communicable diseases, an infected individual (case) can be an initial source for further infections, thereby leading to chains of transmissions in a population. If these are clustered in time they will be recognized as an outbreak and will require localized intervention to break transmission chains. Inapparent and subclinical infections and carriers of infection may be sources for further infections without being identified as infectious cases. Some persons or population groups may be immune against an infection due to vaccinations or after prior exposure to the infection. Important questions studied in infectious disease epidemiology concern the transmissibility and virulence of pathogens, the course of clinical or sub-clinical infections and the duration of protective immunity. Also, in contrast to the epidemiology of non-communicable diseases, in infectious disease epidemiology the study of human contact patterns play an important role. These can be contacts between humans, between humans and animals, between humans and vectors, or between humans and their environment.

In case of an infectious disease, their exposure to infectious agents -a pathogen -can lead to infection, but does not necessarily lead to disease. Infectious agents can be prions, viruses, bacteria, fungi or parasites. The disease can then be caused either by the pathogens themselves after replication in the infected host or by their toxic products. The exposure to an infectious agent depends on its transmission route. Different outcomes of an exposure to an infectious agent can be observed (Fig. 5.2) . The outcome may or may not depend on the infectious dose or the inoculum size. For very infectious pathogens a small dose may result in infection of the host, while for less infectious pathogens higher doses of a pathogen are needed for infection. For example, exposure to hepatitis B virus via sexual contact has a much higher probability for resulting in infection than does exposure to HIV. For some infections the relationship between infectious dose and probability of infection can be quantified by dose-response relationships (Teunis et al. 1999) . ",

For most pathogens, infection describes the event that the pathogen can establish itself in the host individual and reproduce itself or some stages of its life cycle. For some pathogens one has to distinguish between colonization (a settlement of the pathogen on the skin or other body tissues), where an individual has no clinical signs or symptoms of disease, and invasive infection, when the pathogen permeates through certain barriers of the host like the skin or the mucous membrane and causes symptomatic infection. In pathology, an inflammation caused by an infectious pathogen (or other damaging agents) is characterized by following four phenomena: redness and hyperthermia of, e.g. affected skin areas followed by swelling, pain and loss or impairment of function. Infections with different pathogens, but also with the same pathogen in different individuals, can differ widely in their natural history. Some infections are acute and exist only for a few hours, days or weeks (e.g. measles, mumps, influenza, diarrhoea), while others after a short acute phase can become chronic and might remain detectable for decades (e.g. hepatitis B and C, HIV). These differences reflect how the human immune system can deal with different pathogens, which in turn depends on a pathogen's genetic variability and on where it is localized in the host.",

Carriers are of large importance for the spread of infections and for intervention, because they are not easily recognized or detected. A carrier of an infection is usually not aware of his/her infection and the risk they pose towards their direct contacts. Therefore, susceptible contact persons do not take precautions against being infected. It is difficult to target public health measures to prevent risky contacts and to identify sources of infection (e.g. hepatitis B infection, HIV). Under these conditions, only systematic screening of entire population groups may ensure that effective interventions are implemented.",

Finally, some pathogens invade the immune system itself and thereby not only limit the host's immune response against themselves but also enable other pathogens to invade the infected host (e.g. HIV and opportunistic infections). Immunity can be acquired either after natural infection or indirectly. Maternal antibodies protect the newborn child against many infections in the first few months of its life. After that, immunization for some infectious diseases is possible by vaccination. Also vaccineinduced immunity can be lifelong or temporary.

The latent period is the time interval from infection to the start of the infectious period; the incubation period is the time interval from infection to the onset of clinical symptoms (Fig. 5.3) For a specific infectious disease the incubation period may vary widely between individuals. Therefore, incubation periods are often better described as incubation time distributions with a minimal, a mean or median and a maximal incubation time (Fig. 5.4) . In outbreaks one frequently observes several generations of an infection, i.e. clusters of cases with typical time intervals between their days of symptom onset (Fig. 5.5 ). The first case, or index case, in an outbreak is of great importance because he or she brings the infectious disease into the community. Secondary cases are those infected by the index case, tertiary cases those infected by a secondary case, etc. The typical time interval between the onset of symptoms in a case and the onset of symptoms in the cases infected by him/her is called the generation interval or serial interval. The distribution of this interval is determined by the durations of The reproduction number or reproductive rate of an infection is its potential to spread after invasion into a population.

Droplet spread is defined as direct transmission because it is transmitted by a direct spray over a few metres before droplets fall to the ground. Indirect transmission takes place through vectors or via the environment. A vector is an invertebrate animal that becomes infected from infected animals or persons and transmits the infection to other persons, e.g. the Anopheles mosquitoes that transmit malaria parasites from person to person.
