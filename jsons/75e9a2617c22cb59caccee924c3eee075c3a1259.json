Covid-19 disease, caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection includes a spectrum of illness; from asymptomatic infection [2] to severe pneumonia characterized by acute respiratory injury in about 20% of patients presenting to medical care [3] . The risk factors associated with disease severity, included increased age, diabetes, immune suppression and organ failure [3] . Recognition of risk factors for morbidity and mortality is important to determine prevention strategies as well as to target high-risk populations for potential therapeutics.",
