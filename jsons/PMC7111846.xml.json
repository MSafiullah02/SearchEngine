            "text": "Many flavonol natural products are glycosylated, like compounds in Figure 1. The sugar part can be almost any common sugars, such as glucose, galactose, rhamnose, fucose, xylose or arabinose. The sugar part can also be disaccharides or oligosaccharides, with or without acyl groups. The aglycon part differs in the number and position of substitution groups, including hydroxy group and methoxy group. The high structural diversity makes flavonols an interesting class of molecules for medicinal chemistry study, since the structural units have a profound effect on the biological activity. In a structure-activity relationship study of kaempferol 3-O-(3\u2033,4\u2033-di-O-acetyl-\u03b1-l-rhamnopyranoside) (Fig. 1b), conducted by Smith et al. indicated that, the hydroxyl groups on the aglycon are critical for the activity.12 Replacing the hydroxyl groups with methoxy groups or acetoxy groups will cause complete loss of the activity. They also noticed that the glycosylated compound is 50 times more active than the aglycon. A broader and more complete understanding of the structural-activity relationship of glycosylated flavonols would greatly benefit their further pharmaceutical applications. However, only a small number of these compounds are available for biological studies due to the difficulty in isolating them from natural sources. Therefore, a general synthetic method and combinatorial synthesis of a library of these molecules would be very desirable.",

The aglycon will be synthesized from substituted 2\u2032-hydroxyacetophenones and substituted benzaldehydes. Glycosylation of the flavonol followed by deprotection will afford the target molecules.

Chalcones were converted to flavonols 4 by treating with hydrogen peroxide and base in ethanol. Fourteen flavonols (4a\u2013o) have been made through this method and the results are listed in Table 1\n. The overall yield of the synthesis is acceptable, with an average yield at about 60% for the first step and 70% for the second step. All 14 flavonols have been reported in literature, but not all syntheses are reported.19, 20, 22, 23 It is noteworthy that the reaction protocol is a little different when benzyoxyl was used at protecting group, in compounds 4i, 4j, and 4o. 1,4-Dioxane must be used as co-solvent for optimal yield.24 The reason is the poor solubility of those corresponding chalcones if ethanol is the only solvent in the reaction.",

This method can give glycosylated product 6 at around 50% yield, however, the product is often difficult to be separated from a side product of the reaction, the lactols formed from hydrolysis of glycosyl bromides through flash chromatography. To solve this problem, the crude product was further treated with acetic anhydride and triethylamine at room temperature. The lactol side product was converted to a fully acetylated sugar which is less polar than the product and can be easily removed through chromatography (see Scheme 3\n).",

Flavonol 4a, 4j, 4l, and 4o (Table 1) were used to react with four different types of monosaccharide donors, including tetraacetylglucosyl bromide (5a), tetraacetylgalactosyl bromide (5b), triacetylxylosyl bromide (5c), and triacetylarabinosyl bromide (5d). Sixteen glycosylated flavonols were obtained in acceptable yield (24\u201385%). The glycosylation selectively affords \u03b2-products for all reactions. The xylose donor tended to give lower glycosylation yield, which is likely due to the low stability of xylosyl bromide. Xylosyl lactol was a major side product on TLC, together with unreacted flavonols starting material. Another possible reaction for the varying yield is the biphase reaction nature, which might depend on how well the biphase reactants were mixed. The glycosylated flavonols (6) were then deprotected under standard conditions to afford target molecules (7) in good yield (see Table 2\n).26\n",
