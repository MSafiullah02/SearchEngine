Naive method underestimated 36 the CFR of the CFR with a median of 1.3% across countries. 37 Conclusion: Our best estimation of CFR across countries is 2% and varies according to the aged 38 population size.

Moreover, it is 203 lower than other recent coronavirus epidemics as the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome 204 (SARS) with a fatality rate of 10% [22] , or the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) with an 205 even higher mortality rate of around 34% [23] .

The dCFR from Canada was excluded in a subsequent analysis 178 because their confidence interval did not overlap with any the estimates of the remaining 179 countries, this analysis showed a pooled dCFR of 2.1% (95%CI 1.5 to 3.0), and a prediction 180 interval that ranged from 0.4% to 10.9%(Figure 2). Our sensitivity analysis including countries 181 with positivity rate \u22645% showed a consistent result with a pooled dCFR of 2.0% (95%CI 1.5 to 182 2.8)(Supplementary file figure S3). 183The linear regression analysis among the countries with larger testing coverage did not 184show an association between the dCFR and the number of critical care beds per million people 185 (\u03b2 = 0.01; 95%CI = -0.07 to 0.08, p value= 0.85); but we observed and association with the 186 number of physicians per thousand people (\u03b2 = 0.52; 95%CI = 0.18 to 0.87, p value= 0.004) and 187with the proportion of population over 65 years old (\u03b2 = 0.11; 95% CI 0.06 to 0.18, p value 188 <0.001)(Figure 3). In the multivariate analysis, there was no association with the number of 189 the nCFR and dCFR over time for New Zealand, SouthKorea, and Germany.  192    In the three examples, we observed that, as the epidemic progressed over time the naive 193 estimations showed an increasing pattern, from very low rates to rates near the adjusted 194 estimations, with a lag of approximately one to two weeks (",
