Several studies have described co-infection with T. foetus and various pathogens, including Giardia, Toxocara, Eucoleus, Cryptosporidium, Cystoisospora, feline enteric coronavirus (FCoV) and Clostridium perfringens (Bell et al., 2010; Gookin et al., 2001, 2004; Kuehner et al., 2011; Paris et al., 2014; Profizi et al., 2013). So far, only Cryptosporidium sp. has been demonstrated to be associated with more severe clinical disease (Bell et al., 2010; Gookin et al., 2001, 2004). Gookin et al. (2001) examined the relationship between Cryptosporidium sp. and T. foetus and found diarrheal duration and severity was greater in cats with co-infection of Cryptosporidium sp. Detection of T. foetus was also noted more commonly co-associated with feline coronavirus and C. perfringens than as a singular pathogen in a retrospective study of 1088 cats within the United Kingdom (Paris et al., 2014).",

The findings described in the small intestine and mesenteric lymph nodes were consistent with late-stage FPV infection (Balboni et al., 2014). FPV infects rapidly dividing cells, including lymphoid tissue and proliferating cells of the bone marrow resulting in cell lysis and functional immunosuppression which predisposes these animals to other infectious agents (Truyen et al., 2009). FCoV causes a mild diarrhoea and coinfects cats with T. foetus (Paris et al., 2014; Vogel et al., 2010). FCoV may have contributed to the increased T. foetus burden, however, its role was likely minor in the face of severe feline parvoviral enteritis. It is likely the host response to T. foetus was compromised, leading to increased numbers of T. foetus. Bovine T. foetus infections elicit a parasite-specific antibody response to adhesin and contact-dependent cytotoxicity, and these mechanisms may be hindered in immunosuppressed animals (Tolbert and Gookin, 2016; Voyich et al., 2001). Fluctuations in intestinal microbiota in the weaned kitten, influenced by co-infection of enteric pathogens, may have contributed to the trichomonad disease burden (Gookin et al., 2017; \u0160lapeta et al., 2015).",

Many cats infected with T. foetus undergo spontaneous resolution of their diarrhoea and become \u2018asymptomatic carriers\u2019, shedding low levels of the organism without clinically apparent diarrhoea (Gookin et al., 2017). It is thought trichomoniasis resolves within 2 years in healthy cats, but in cats compromised with concurrent viral infection e.g. FPV, the time period until resolution is unknown (Gookin et al., 2017). Co-infection with other diarrheic agents such as FPV in this case may serve to increase the trichomonad disease burden. This has the potential to create an environment whereby a known reservoir of infection is shedding large amounts of the infectious agent in question. T. foetus is a protozoan known to persist in the environment for long periods of time (Hale et al., 2009; Van der Saag et al., 2011). Increased environmental T. foetus contamination creates a long-term persistent problem.",
