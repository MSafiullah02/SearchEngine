            "text": "Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is a novel enzyme with possible implications in the treatment of blood pressure disorders. Recent evidence suggests that an upregulation of ACE2 can be stimulated by all-trans retinoic acid (at-RA); however, at-RA also affects regulation of the stem-cell marker octomer-4 (Oct-4) and thus cellular differentiation. We have previously shown that smooth muscle cells and macrophages present within rabbit atherosclerotic plaques are positive for ACE2, Oct-4 and the haematopoietic stem-cell marker CD34. Thus, to provide evidence that possible at-RA treatment could affect both plaque cellular biology (via effects on cellular differentiation) and blood pressure (via ACE2), it is vital to show that cells with atherosclerotic plaques co-express all three markers. Thus, we sought to provide evidence that a subset of cells within atherosclerotic plaques is positive for ACE2, Oct-4 and CD34. We used New Zealand White rabbits that were fed a control diet supplemented with 0.5% cholesterol plus 1% methionine for 4 weeks and then allowed to consume a normal diet for 10 weeks. Immunohistochemistry was performed by standard techniques. We report that ACE2, Oct-4 and CD34 were all present within atherosclerotic plaques. Although macrophages were positive for all three markers, spindle-shaped cells in the media did not show all three markers. The endothelium overlying normal arterial wall showed positive Oct-4 and ACE2 immunoreactivity, but CD34 immunoreactivity was patchy, indicating that such cells might not have fully differentiated. It is concluded that cells in atherosclerotic plaques express co-express ACE2, Oct-4 and CD34. Further studies aimed at establishing the effects of all-trans retinoic acid on blood pressure and atherosclerotic cell differentiation are warranted.",

            "text": "Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEi) and antagonists of angiotensin II receptors are successful medications for the treatment of cardiovascular diseases (CVD). This has now established an overactive reninangiotensin system (RAS) as a major culprit of CVD and hypertension (Paul et al. 2006) . Current research suggests that the heptapeptide, Ang(1-7), has a beneficial role in the prevention of CVD, and this has been further substantiated by the recent discovery of angiotensinconverting enzyme 2 (ACE2), the major enzyme involved in the formation of Ang(1-7). It is well documented that the actions of the ACE2-Ang(1-7) axis counterregulate the ACE-angiotensin II axis (Santos et al. 2005; Ferrario, 2006; Reudelhuber, 2006) , and some studies have suggested that the activation of the ACE2-Ang(1-7) axis can prevent or reduce the damage observed in CVD (Loot et al. 2002; Diez-Freire et al. 2006; Ferreira et al. 2007) . Indeed, an increase in plasma Ang(1-7) is observed after chronic treatment with ACEi and/or angiotensin II receptor antagonists, suggesting that it could be possible that the beneficial effects of these RAS blockers result, in part, from Ang(1-7)-mediated effects Iyer et al. 1998) . Therefore, the emerging concept is that an imbalance in Ang(1-7)-angiotensin II levels is critical in the development of CVD.",

All-trans retinoic acid is known to influence gene expression and protein production in many ways. A single, classical pathway for the way in which at-RA works has emerged, consisting of all-trans retinoic acid, plus a dimer of retinoic acid receptor (RAR) and retinoid X receptor (RXR; Zhong et al. 2004) . Recent studies have shown that at-RA can influence gene expression within the RAS, which plays a role in the pathogenesis of hypertension (Zhong et al. 2004) . The beneficial effects of at-RA are generally exerted via interference with the action of the RAS (Dechow et al. 2001) . For example, Zhong et al. (2004) showed that spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) treated with at-RA significantly increased the expression of ACE2 mRNA and protein, which was also accompanied by a reduction in blood pressure. However, chronic treatment with at-RA on non-hypertensive rats did not have any effect on the expression level of ACE2 (Hamming et al. 2007 ).",

To determine whether there were differences in cellular expression of all three factors between small and large plaques, we studied both types of plaques.

In addition, the media beneath plaques also showed a lack of uniformity for all three factors, but ACE2-positive cells and separate Oct-4-positive cells were clearly visible (Fig. 2) . In larger sized atherosclerotic plaques, all three factors co-localized in cells that were of macrophage appearance, similar to the situation in smaller plaques, and it was difficult to determine spindle-shaped cells owing to the large number of cells of macrophage appearance (Fig. 3) . Sections of abdominal aorta from both animals killed at 4 weeks and animals killed at 14 weeks all showed negative staining to the negative control antibody.

We also showed that the RAS anti-atherosclerotic factors, ACE2 and the angiotensin II type 2 receptor, co-localize in rabbit atherosclerotic plaques (Zulli et al. 2006 ) and that such cells also express markers of embryonic stem cells, such as Oct-4 (Zulli et al. 2007b ). In addition, our most recent publications clearly demonstrate that human diseased vessels also express markers of embryonic stem cells (Zulli et al. 2007c ) and the RAS (Zulli et al. 2007a) , indicating that cells in diseased arteries do express markers of primitive origin or might be primitive cells that have migrated into diseased tissues.",

            "text": "The presence of ACE2/Oct-4-positive cells within atherosclerotic plaques indicates that ACE2 could also be involved in the determination of cellular differentiation state. For example, a recent study of patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) demonstrated that ACE2 expression correlated positively with the differentiation state of human airway epithelia. The authors show that infection of human airway epithelia by SARS coronavirus correlates with the state of cell differentiation and ACE2 expression and localization (Jia et al. 2005 ). In addition, ACE2 has been shown to be sharply upregulated in maturing oocytes, specifically at the time of oocyte maturation (Bobe et al. 2006) . Thus, whether ACE2 expression correlates with Oct-4 expression or macrophage/smooth muscle cell/endothelial cell differentiation warrants further study. Indeed, retinoic acid is a compound that could be used both to upregulate ACE2 and to downregulate Oct-4. Retinoic acid has also been shown in a variety of cell culture experiments to impact a variety of cellular processes. For example, treatment of embryonal carcinoma cells with retinoic acid was associated with profound changes in cell morphology that also expressed smooth muscle \u03b1-actin that also functionally responded to angiotensin II (Blank et al. 1995) , indicating that other effects of retinoic acid might be to stimulate a more pro-constrictive cellular environment as well as ACE2. All-trans retinoic acid is also a potent stimulator of embryonic stem-cell differentiation, and it is suggested that one of the mechanisms of action is via decreasing Oct-4 (Faherty et al. 2005) , which is a transcription factor whose expression is associated with an undifferentiated cell phenotype and is downregulated when the cells differentiate (Pesce & Scholer, 2001) . For example, a recent study by Faherty et al. (2005) clearly shows that that the level of at-RA is an important determinant of cell fate. They showed that in embryonic stem cells, lower levels of retinoic acid (0.1-10 nm) promoted the formation of epithelial-like cells, whereas higher levels (100-10 000 nm) favoured differentiation into fibroblastic-like cells. This study suggests that the dose of at-RA is important in the determination of cell type; therefore, further experiments aimed at determining the dose of at-RA that allows for a more stable plaque phenotype are warranted.",

Since at-RA can upregulate ACE2 and downregulate Oct-4, we suggest that further studies into cardiovascular disease should be aimed at determining the role of at-RA in both blood pressure regulation and cell differentiation.",
