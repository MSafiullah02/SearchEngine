Artificial intelligence models have been helpful for successful analyses in the biomedical field. In this study, Coronavirus was detected using a deep learning model, which is a sub-branch of artificial intelligence. Our dataset consists of three classes namely: coronavirus, pneumonia, and normal X-ray imagery. In this study, the data classes were restructured using the Fuzzy Color technique as a preprocessing step and the images that were structured with the original images were stacked. In the next step, the stacked dataset was trained with deep learning models (MobileNetV2, SqueezeNet) and the feature sets obtained by the models were processed using the Social Mimic optimization method. Thereafter, efficient features were combined and classified using Support Vector Machines (SVM). The overall classification rate obtained with the proposed approach was 99.27%. With the proposed approach in this study, it is evident that the model can efficiently contribute to the detection of COVID-19 disease.",

Using deep learning approaches, AI has been used in many applications such as image detection, data classification, image segmentation [5, 6] . People infected by COVID-19 may suffer from pneumonia because the virus spreads to the lungs. Many deep learning studies have detected the disease using a chest X-ray image data approach [7] . A previous study has classified the pneumonia X-ray images using three different deep learning models [8] namely the fine-tuned model, model without fine-tuning, and the model trained from scratch. By using the ResNet model, they classified the dataset into multiple labels such as age, gender, etc. They also used the Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) as a classification method and achieved an average of 82.2% accuracy. Samir Yadav et al. [9] performed a classification algorithm using pneumonia data, SVM as a classification method, and InceptionV3, VGG-16 models as a deep learning approach. In their study, the dataset is divided into three classes: normal, bacterial pneumonia, and viral pneumonia to improve the contrast and brightness zoom settings with the augmentation method for each image in the dataset. The best classification achievement was 96.6%. Rahib Abiyev et al. [10] used the Backpropagation Neural Network and Competitive Neural Network models to classify pneumonia data. Using pneumonia and normal chest X-ray images, they set 30% of the dataset as test data and compared the proposed approach with the existing CNNs. They achieved 89.57% classification success. Okeke Stephen et al. [11] proposed a deep learning model to classify the pneumonia data from scratch to train the data.",

All datasets are X-ray images, and each image is converted to JPG format. Since COVID-19 is a new disease, the number of images related to this virus is limited. For this study, we combined two publicly accessible databases consisting of COVID-19 images. The first COVID-19 dataset was shared on the GitHub website by a researcher named Joseph Paul Cohen from the University of Montreal. After the experts checked the images, they were made available to the public. In the Joseph Paul Cohen dataset, image types are MERS, SARS, COVID-19, etc. The data of 76 images labeled with COVID-19 were selected for this study [13] . The second COVID-19 dataset consists of the images created by a team of researchers from Qatar University, medical doctors from Bangladesh, and collaborators from Pakistan and Malaysia. The second COVID-19 dataset is available on the Kaggle website, and the current version has 219 X-ray images [14] . For this study, two datasets containing COVID-19 images were combined, and a new dataset consisting of 295 images was created. COVID-19 virus causes pneumonia in the affected individuals and can provoke death if the lungs are permanently damaged [15] . The second dataset is important in this study to compare COVID-19 chest images using deep learning models. The second dataset consists of normal chest images and pneumonia chest images. Pneumonia chest images include both virus and bacteria types, and these images are taken from 53 patients. The images were created by experts and shared publicly [16] .",

If linear bottlenecks occur between the layers, the problems are fixed in this version with shortcuts [17]. Fig. 2 shows the architecture design of the MobileNetV2 model. Its input size is 224 \u00d7 224 pixels, and its architecture comprises of in-depth (DW) separable filters and combination of steps. The model performance increases as it examines the DW, and the input features are divided into two layers.

Some of these neurons are responsible for perceiving facial expressions such as our eyebrows sharpening or laughing, etc. These neurons also act as interbrain communication and generate a response to this effect. In other words, social imitation is the condition of adopting the behavior, conversation, or dressing of another person, which one sees as a guide. Based on this, an advanced is made towards a better understanding of human behavioral activities[34].Social Mimic Optimization (SMO) is a method developed by inspiring people to imitate other people. This is inspired by imitating the behavior of people in society. Locally, each problem produces a solution using the SMO algorithm, which moves towards the global solution. Each solution determines the difference in the global value by comparing the local value obtained in the last iteration. This is applied to the problem parameters to find the solution randomly based on the difference in the value obtained. While the term \" \" in SMO expresses the population, the \" \" parameter expresses the best global value, and the \"! \" \"# #\" $\" parameter represents the number of iterations. The number of followers is obtained by multiplying the population with the number of decision variables (%). Decision variables have a lower bound ( ) and upper bound ( ) value. Eqs.

True Positive (TP), False Positive (FP), True Negative (TN), and False Negative (FN) parameters of the confusion matrix were used to calculate the metrics [35,36]. When the samples that belong to a specific class are identified correctly by the classifier, these samples are located to TP indices.
