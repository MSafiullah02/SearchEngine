            "text": "Disease spreading through human travel networks has been a topic of great interest in recent years, as witnessed during outbreaks of influenza A (H1N1) or SARS pandemics. One way to stop spreading over the airline network are travel restrictions for major airports or network hubs based on the total number of passengers of an airport. Here, we test alternative strategies using edge removal, cancelling targeted flight connections rather than restricting traffic for network hubs, for controlling spreading over the airline network. We employ a SEIR metapopulation model that takes into account the population of cities, simulates infection within cities and across the network of the top 500 airports, and tests different flight cancellation methods for limiting the course of infection. The time required to spread an infection globally, as simulated by a stochastic global spreading model was used to rank the candidate control strategies. The model includes both local spreading dynamics at the level of populations and long-range connectivity obtained from real global airline travel data. Simulated spreading in this network showed that spreading infected 37% less individuals after cancelling a quarter of flight connections between cities, as selected by betweenness centrality. The alternative strategy of closing down whole airports causing the same number of cancelled connections only reduced infections by 18%. In conclusion, selecting highly ranked single connections between cities for cancellation was more effective, resulting in fewer individuals infected with influenza, compared to shutting down whole airports. It is also a more efficient strategy, affecting fewer passengers while producing the same reduction in infections.",

For this, we observe individuals within cities that contain one of the 500 most frequently used airports worldwide (based on annual total passenger number). Individuals within the model can be susceptible (S), infected (I), or removed (R). The number of infected individuals depends on the population of each city and the volume of traffic over airline connections between cities. Note that the time course of disease spreading will also be influence by seasonality [23] ; however, only spreading in one season was tested here. The simulated epidemic starts in 1 July 2007 from a single city, Mexico City in our case, and its evolution over the following year is recorded. We then consider the number of days necessary for the epidemic to reach its peak as well as the maximum number of infected individuals ( Fig. 2A) . This procedure is then repeated following the removal of a percentage of connections ranked as by a range of distinct measures such as edge betweenness centrality, Jaccard coefficient or difference and product of node degrees. Finally we also test the effect of shutting down the most highly connected airports (hubs) up to the same level of cancelled connections.",

This gives a much more realistic estimate of the actual spreading pattern as not only the existence of a flight connection but the specific number of passengers that flow over that link is taken into account.

For the 25% restriction level considered, betweenness centrality was the best measure even when no communities were present, offering a 41% reduction in infected cases in both types of network. This apparent advantage of betweenness even in networks without communities is due to its use of the capacity of each connection (edge weight), at 25% edge removal it will have removed most major high capacity connections from the network. Jaccard is a purely structural measure and without knowledge of capacity. The presence of communities is then critical for its performance.

Second, spreading was observed only in one season, summer. Previous work [23] has pointed out that the actual spreading pattern differs for different seasons. Third, only the 500 airports with the largest traffic volume rather than all 3,968 airports were included in the simulation. While this was done in order to be comparable with the earlier study of Hufnagel et al. [5] , tests on the larger dataset would be interesting.

For the second, the original community structure was preserved but the sub-network within each community was rewired, so connections within the community were rearranged but the original inter-community links were preserved. Both rewiring strategies preserved the original degree structure by the commonly used algorithm [37] in order to maintain the same number of passengers departing from each city and the number of passengers is only shuffled to different destinations. This way both strategies did not change in the number of passengers departing from each city, only the connectivity structure was modified. The original community structure was identified using an heuristic modularity optimization algorithm [38] which identified four distinct clusters. These are predominantly geographic: one for North and Central America, including Canada and Hawaii, another for South America, a third including the greater part of China (except Hong Kong, Macau and Beijing) and finally a fourth including all other airports (Fig. 1B) .",
