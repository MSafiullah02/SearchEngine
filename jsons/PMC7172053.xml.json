            "text": "Viral respiratory infections, particularly rhinovirus infections, are the most common cause of asthma exacerbation. Johnston et al. reported that viral infections were associated with 80\u201385% of asthma exacerbations in children (Johnston et al., 1995). Picornaviruses (human rhinoviruses (HRV) and enteroviruses) accounted for about 65% of these virus-induced asthma exacerbations. Also in adult asthma patients, respiratory virus infections are associated with the majority of exacerbations (Nicholson et al., 1993). Corne et al. observed that HRV infections usually lead to more severe symptoms and longer duration of lower respiratory tract (LRT) disease in asthmatics than in otherwise healthy individuals (Corne et al., 2002). However, the exact mechanism by which HRV cause exacerbations of asthma is unclear. One postulated mechanism is that the HRV-specific intracellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM-1) receptor is up-regulated in asthma patients, therefore increasing their susceptibility to HRV infection (Manolitsas et al., 1994, Yamaya et al., 1999). Another mechanism is suggested by the increased susceptibility to HRV infection of bronchial epithelial cells from asthmatic patients (Wark et al., 2005). The authors suggest that this indicates an abnormal innate immune response by these cells to infection by HRV, resulting in increased viral RNA expression and virus release from cells from asthmatics than from cells from healthy controls. The role of post-infectious immune responses was suggested by studies in patients with allergic rhinitis or asthma; those who had a high IFN-\u03b3\u2013IL-5 ratio (Th1 helper response) tended to have less severe symptoms after an HRV challenge, and shed less virus in the sputum, compared to those who had a low IFN-\u03b3\u2013IL-5 ratio (Th2-helper response) (Gern et al., 2000). The magnitude of the cytokine response (IL-8) in either the sputum or in the upper respiratory tract (nasal secretion), correlated with increased airway hyper-responsiveness (Gern et al., 2000, Grunberg et al., 1997b).",

URT symptoms that were scored were defined as runny, stuffy or itchy nose, sneezing, watery/sore eyes, sore throat, hoarse voice and headache. LRT symptoms that were scored included coughing, wheezing, difficult breathing and shortness of breath during effort (Johnston et al., 1995). Patients in the asthma group recorded peak flow each morning and afternoon (peak flow score), using their peak flow instrument (Mini Wright meter; Clement Clarke International London, UK) three times in succession, and recording the highest value. The median baseline score for a subject was the mean of the peak flow score in five consecutive time points around the baseline (week 8). Subjects were asked to contact the investigators if the URT symptoms score totaled 4 or more, and/or if the LRT symptoms score exceeded 5, resulting in a home visit within 48 h. Follow-up visits were performed at days 3\u20134, days 5\u20136, after 2 weeks and after 8 weeks (baseline). The duration of URT and LRT symptoms was determined by the number of days with a URT or LRT symptoms score of 1 above the individual baseline score, respectively. The severity of the URT and LRT symptoms was defined as the maximum of URT and LRT symptoms scores, respectively. During each visit a nasal wash (NW) was collected from each nostril as described previously (Grunberg et al., 1997b). Briefly, 10 ml of sterile saline was instilled in each nostril and collected in the same tube. The tube was mixed thoroughly and immediately placed on wet ice. One milliliter of NW was used for virus culture. The remainder was mixed with an equal volume of diluted sputolysin reagent (6.5 mM dithiothreitol in 100 mM phosphate buffer) (Calbiochem-Novabiochem Corporation, San Diego, CA). Both aliquots were then clarified by centrifugation (1000 \u00d7 \ng for 10 min at room temperature). The remaining supernatant fluid was stored at \u221280 \u00b0C until further analysis.",

Comparisons of measures of infection and illness (viral load, symptom assessment and peak flow measurements) and cytokine levels between asthmatics and controls were done with the Wilcoxon signed rank test (SPSS 11.0 for Windows). Correlations were determined using the Spearman's rank correlation coefficient (SPSS 11.0 for Windows). An area under the curve (AUC) analysis including both virus load and duration of shedding was performed using the trapezium rule (Matthews et al., 1990). The AUC calculated from the data points from all individuals was then compared with means of the Mann\u2013Whitney test (SPSS 11.0 for Windows).",

The severity of LRT symptoms in asthmatic patients infected with HRV has been attributed to Th2 dominance in asthma patients and an enhanced Th2-helper response (Papadopoulos et al., 2002, Gern et al., 2000, Konno et al., 1996). Experimental HRV infections suggest that the pattern of cytokine production in asthmatic patients may be responsible for exacerbations related to a HRV infection (Parry et al., 2000, Gern et al., 2000). We were unable to detect IFN-\u03b3 or IL-5 in the NW of subjects, which may be related to the presence of DTT in our samples, which blocks detection. This is in line with another observation that both cytokines could not be detected in sputum during acute respiratory virus infections (Pizzichini et al., 1998, Gern et al., 2000). IL-8, a potent chemoattractant for and activator of neutrophils, has also been implicated in virus-related exacerbations of asthma (Grunberg et al., 1997a, Noah et al., 1995, Johnston, 2000, Teran et al., 1997). Although we did see a statistically significant increase in IL-8 over baseline we did not observe a difference in intranasal IL-8 levels between the asthmatic group and the control group.",
