Bifidobacteria were major proportions in healthy cats with cell number of 9.34 (log10 cells/g faeces), as determined by FISH. Significantly lower numbers of bifidobacteria have been found in cats with IBD [21].

Based on the analysis of 16S rRNA, it was reported that the feline GIT is often represented by five phyla where Firmicutes dominate (68%), followed by Proteobacteria (14%), Bacteroidetes (10%), Fusobacteria (5%), and Actinobacteria (4%), [15]. However, a more recent study using the metagenomic approach revealed that the feline gut microbiota is predominated by Bacteroidetes/Chlorobi group bacterial phylum comprising around 68% of total classified diversity and followed by Firmicutes (\u223c13%) and Proteobacteria (\u223c6%) respectively, while known Archaea, fungi (Ascomycota), and viruses represent minor communities in the overall microbial diversity [10], [24]. Minamoto and collaborators [25] summarised the studies on feline small and large intestine microbiota showing in detail microbiota to genus level. Most studies have been conducted in shorthair cats [8] which leaves much of the microbiota of other pet cats in different breeds to be studied more in detail. Thus, the composition appears to be distinctly different from both canine and human studies. Since different techniques may create bias from one report to another and the result, more studies are needed to uncover the details of variation within the canine and feline community and also between individual animals.",

In addition, antibiotic therapy has been shown to have a long-term effect on intestinal microbiota [51], [52]. Microbes with antimicrobial multiresistancy, such as ampicillin- and tetracycline-resistant enterococci, may transfer from pets to pet owners occuring even in hospital infections [49], [53], [54]. An experimental study evaluating the effect of macrolide antibiotic tylosin on microbial diversity in the canine small intestine using 16S rRNA gene sequencing revealed decrease of Fusobacteria, Bacteroidales and Moraxella, while the proportions of Enterococcus-like bacteria, Pasteurella, Dietzia, and Escherichia increased. Microorganisms belonging to Spirochaetes, Streptomycetaceae, and Prevotellaceae were undetectable at the end of antibiotic challenge [55].",

Possible benefits of the probiotic use in pets include: modulation of the immune system, help in stress maintenance, protection from infections caused by enteropathogens, increased growth and development, control of allergic disorders and recently also obesity (Fig. 2\n).",

The presence of Helicobacter spp. has been associated with gastritis in dogs and cats [89]. The only treatment is a \u2018triple therapy\u2019 composed of two antibiotics and a proton-pump inhibitor [90] but at least in humans this therapy is not always successful and new alternatives are being developed [91]. Some probiotic strains, such as L. casei DN-114 001, showed a high success rate of eradication of Helicobacter in children(along with a standard treatment) at a high daily dosage of 1 \u00d7 1010 CFU [92]. Thus, probiotics could be a promising tool to combat Helicobacter infections in dogs and cats.",

In addition the inactivated forms of probiotic strains were also able to adhere to dog mucus in vitro. Thus, non-viable probiotics have a potential as a successful probiotic feed additives in canine diet [65], [66]. The in vivo study using non-viable forms of probiotics are also promising, although preparation method of non-viable form might have an impact on probiotic potential. Kanasugi and colleagues [111] demonstrated that oral administration of a heat-killed E. faecalis (FK-23) stimulated non-specific immune responses in healthy dogs. A bacterial enterovaccine Colifagina which contains deactivated whole bacteria and lysates of E. coli 01, 02, 055, 0111, Bacillus pumilus, Morganella morgani, Alcaligenes faecalis, Shigella flexneri, B. subtilis, E. faecalis, and Proteus vulgaris and is used in human medicine to treat intestinal symptoms, has been shown to improve symptoms and faecal consistency in five dogs with recurrent episodes of diarrhoea. Authors reported that such improvement lasted as long as the dogs were monitored for diarrhoea, i.e. up to one month after discontinuation of the probiotic treatment [112]. Thus, non-viable forms of probiotics could be a good alternative to live probiotic cells, but the current definition identifies only viable microorganisms as probiotics [56], [57]. Nevertheless, more research on non-viable forms of probiotic bacteria could be useful to assess their antipathogenic and physiological effects on canine and feline health.",

Since different sources of the same probiotic may significantly alter strain properties, the outcome of intervention studies may be questioned. Recently, we have shown that growth media may significantly affect the adhesive ability of canine probiotics lactobacilli to dog mucus [66]. Their impact on enteropathogen adhesion to canine mucus was also altered depending on the growth media used to cultivate probiotics [65]. Thus, the growth conditions and media should be carefully considered for quality control of existing probiotics and for identification of new probiotics for companion animals, since even small changes in properties may significantly influence the outcome with different impact on host health. In addition, the storage stability of non-viable forms of microorganisms may provide new possibilities of developing nutritional supplements for companion animals.",

However, as microbiota differences may facilitate exposure to pathogens and harmful environmental influences, it is of importance to search for novel tools to protect dogs and cats and at the same time the human owners from pathogens. There is therefore a need for development of products aimed at improving the well-being of companion animals and probiotics are excellent candidates. The current evidence suggests that specific probiotic strains and/or their defined combinations may be useful in the canine and feline nutrition, therapy and care. The probiotics of human origin appear to be among the new promising tools for the maintenance of pets' health. However, the host-derived microorganisms might be the most appropriate probiotic source. More controlled trials are needed to both identify and characterise new specific probiotic preparations with an impact on general health and well being as well as health maintenance in both dogs and cats. At the same time the potential to reduce safety risk related to new probiotic microorganisms in animal health and welfare should be assessed. Special attention should be placed to develop tools to monitor probiotic activity during processing and storage of canine and feline probiotics.",
