Historically, CoV infection in humans has been associated with mild upper respiratory tract diseases [ 1 ] . However, the identifi cation of the severe acute respiratory syndrome CoV (SARS-CoV) in 2003 [ 3 ] and the recently emerged (April 2012) Middle East respiratory syndrome CoV (MERS-CoV) [ 4 ] , which has been associated with acute pneumonia, redefi ned historic perceptions and potentiated the relevance of CoVs as important human pathogens. In this sense, the development of CoV infectious clones provides a valuable molecular tool to study fundamental viral processes, to develop genetically defi ned vaccines, and to test antiviral drugs. However, the generation of CoV infectious clones has been hampered for a long time due to the huge size of the CoV genome (around 30 kb) and the toxicity of some CoV replicase gene sequences during its propagation in bacteria. Recently, these problems were overcome using nontraditional approaches based on the use of bacterial artifi cial chromosomes (BACs) [ 5 ] , in vitro ligation of cDNA fragments [ 6 ] , and vaccinia virus as a vector for the propagation of CoV full-length cDNAs [ 7 , 8 ] .",

            "text": "In this chapter we describe the protocol to assemble CoV fulllength cDNAs in BACs using the MERS-CoV EMC12 strain [ 9 ] as an example. In this system, the full-length cDNA copy of the viral genome is assembled in the BAC plasmid pBeloBAC11 [ 10 ] ( Fig. 1 ) , a low-copy-number plasmid based on the Escherichia coli ( E. coli ) F-factor [ 11 ] that presents a strictly controlled replication leading to one or two plasmid copies per cell. This plasmid minimizes the instability problem of several CoV sequences when amplifi ed in high-copy-number plasmids, allows the stable maintenance of large DNA fragments in bacteria [ 11 ] , and its manipulation is similar to that of conventional plasmids. The cDNA of the CoV genome is assembled in the BAC under the control of the cytomegalovirus (CMV) immediate-early promoter and it is fl anked at the 3\u02b9-end by a 25-bp synthetic poly(A) followed by the sequences of the hepatitis delta virus (HDV) ribozyme and the bovine growth hormone (BGH) termination and polyadenylation signals to produce synthetic RNAs bearing authentic 5\u02b9-and 3\u02b9-ends of the viral genome. This DNA-launched system couples expression of the viral RNA in the nucleus from the CMV promoter [ 12 ] with a second amplifi cation step in the cytoplasm driven by the viral polymerase, allowing the recovery of infectious virus from the cDNA clone without the need for in vitro ligation and transcription steps. Although some splicing events could occur during the nuclear expression of the viral genome, the effi ciency of this phenomenon is very low and does not affect the recovery of infectious virus [ 5 ] .",

BHK-21 cells are selected because they present good transfection effi ciencies and support the replication of most known CoVs after transfection of the viral genome. The following protocol is indicated for a 35-mm-diameter dish and can be upscaled or downscaled if desired ( see Note 26 ).1. One day before transfection, plate 4 \u00d7 10 5 BHK-21 cells in 2 ml of growth medium without antibiotics to obtain 90-95 % confl uent cell monolayers by the time of transfection ( see Note 27 ). Also plate susceptible cells (Huh-7 cells in the case of MERS-CoV) at the required confl uence for the amplifi cation of the recombinant virus after transfection. 2. Before transfection, equilibrate the Opti-MEM I Reduced Serum Medium at room temperature and put the DNA ( see Note 28 ) and the Lipofectamine 2000 reagent on ice. For each transfection sample, prepare transfection mixtures in sterile microfuge tubes as follows: (a) Dilute 5 \u00b5g of the BAC clone in 250 \u00b5l of Opti-MEM medium. Mix carefully, avoiding prolonged vortexing or pipetting to prevent plasmid shearing. (b) Mix Lipofectamine 2000 gently before use.

(c) Combine the diluted DNA with diluted Lipofectamine 2000, mix carefully, and incubate for 20 min at room temperature. 3. During this incubation period, wash the BHK-21 cells once with growth medium without antibiotics and leave the cells in 1 ml of the same medium per dish. 4. Add the 500 \u00b5l of the DNA-Lipofectamine 2000 mixture onto the washed cells and mix by rocking the plate back and forth. Incubate the cells at 37 \u00b0C for 6 h ( see Note 30 ).",

            "text": "Although the BAC DNA prepared by this method is contaminated with up to 30 % of bacterial genomic DNA, it is suitable for analysis by restriction enzyme digestion or PCR.Large-scale preparation of ultrapure BAC DNA suitable for all critical applications, including subcloning, DNA sequencing or transfection experiments, is performed by alkaline lysis with the Qiagen Large-Construct Kit, which has been specifi cally developed and adapted for BAC purifi cation. This kit integrates an ATP-dependent exonuclease digestion step that enables effi cient removal of bacterial genomic DNA contamination to yield ultrapure BAC DNA.1. Inoculate a single colony from a freshly streaked plate (LB agar plate containing 12.5 \u00b5g/ml chloramphenicol) ( see Note 9 ) in 5 ml of LB medium containing 12.5 \u00b5g/ml chloramphenicol and incubate for 8 h at 37 \u00b0C with vigorous shaking (250 rpm).2. Dilute 1 ml of the culture into 500 ml of selective LB medium ( see Note 10 ) pre-warmed to 37 \u00b0C and grow the cells with vigorous shaking (250 rpm) in a 2 l fl ask at 37 \u00b0C for 12-16 h, to an OD at 550 nm between 1.2 and 1.5. This cell density typically corresponds with the transition from a logarithmic to a stationary growth phase ( see Note 12 ).3. Harvest the bacterial cells by centrifugation at 6,000 \u00d7 g for 15 min at 4 \u00b0C and purify the BAC DNA with the Qiagen Large-Construct Kit according to the manufacturer's specifications ( see Note 13 ). Depending of the BAC size, yields of 20-35 \u00b5g of ultrapure BAC DNA can be obtained.",

            "text": "The use of a swinging bucket rotor is recommended for the last isopropanol precipitation step to facilitate the further resuspension of the BAC DNA. After washing with 70 % ethanol, air-dry the pellet for only 5 min. Never use vacuum, as overdrying the pellet will make the BAC DNA diffi cult to dissolve. Carefully remove any additional liquid drop, add 250 \u00b5l of 10 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.5) (DNA dissolves better under slightly alkaline conditions) and resuspend the DNA overnight at 4 \u00b0C. To prevent plasmid shearing, avoid vortexing or pipetting to promote resuspension of the BAC DNA. Transfer the DNA to a clean 1.5 ml microfuge tube, remove any possible resin traces by centrifugation for 1 min in a tabletop microfuge, and keep the supernatant in a clean tube at 4 \u00b0C. If the purifi ed BAC DNA is not going to be used for a long period of time we recommend storage at -20 \u00b0C. Avoid repeated freezethaw cycles to prevent plasmid shearing.14. For effi cient cell transformation, bacterial culture OD at 550 nm should not exceed 0.8. To ensure that the culture does not grow to a higher density, OD measurement every 20 min after 3 h of growth is highly recommended.15. Take care when decanting the supernatant as the bacterial pellets lose adherence in 10 % glycerol.16. The Qiagen QIAEX II resin can be used to effi ciently purify DNA fragments from 40 bp to 50 kb from aqueous solutions and from standard or low-melt agarose gels in TAE or TBE buffers. Other commercial kits are available, but check whether they have been optimized for purifi cation of DNA fragments larger than 10 kb, as most BAC constructs used during the assembly of the infectious clone are larger than 10 kb.17. The large size of the BAC vectors reduces the ligation efficiency. To increase this effi ciency, it is essential to use larger amounts of vector, insert, and T4 DNA ligase than when using conventional plasmids.18. Most electroporation machines contain programs with defi ned parameters for transforming specifi c cell types. In this case, choose the program containing the conditions closest to those described in this protocol.19. The presence of salt increases the conductivity of the solution and could cause arcing during the electrical pulse, drastically reducing the transformation effi ciency. If arcing occurs, use a smaller amount of the ligation reaction in the electroporation or remove salt from the DNA using any commercial kit or by extraction with phenol-chloroform followed by precipitation with ethanol and 2 M ammonium acetate.20. Plating volumes higher than 200 \u00b5l of electroporated cells on a single plate may inhibit the growth of transformants owing to the large number of dead cells resulting from electroporation.If only small numbers of transformant colonies are expected, it is recommended to spread 200 \u00b5l-aliquots of the electroporated cells on different plates.21.A mix of small and large colonies indicates that the cloned DNA fragment presents some toxicity when amplifi ed in E.",
