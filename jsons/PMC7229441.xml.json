            "text": "Generating means to detect mercury(II) (Hg2+) is necessary since reports have shown Hg2+ to be a health threat to the world environment, this stemming from its highly toxic nature and ubiquitous impact in both the lithosphere and hydrosphere (Coronado et al. 2005). Years of experimental works have shown Hg2+ to pose health problems not only to human beings but also to other animal species. Hg2+ contamination is being engendered through natural and anthropogenic endeavours, including ocean and volcanic eruptions, mining of metal (especially artisanal and small-scale gold mining, ASGM), incineration of waste, tanning of leather, electroplating, occupational operations, dental care, preventive medical practices, agricultural and industrial operations, and fossil fuel combustion (from coal-burning power plants) (Renzoni et al. 1998; Rice et al. 2014; Bravo et al. 2014; Costa et al. 2016; Martinez-Finley et al. 2014). Elemental mercury and ionic mercury (Hg and Hg2+, respectively) have the tendency to be transformed by microorganisms like bacteria into methylmercury (MeHg), which is a potentially harmful neurotoxin capable of bioaccumulation into the food chain (Nolan and Lippard 2008). Its damaging effect on the placenta of pregnant women has been particularly identified, which thereby poses a developmental problem to foetal brain and central nervous system, resulting in a developmental delay in children (Coronado et al. 2005; Kim et al. 2008; Gibb and OLeary 2014). This can then implicate certain biological processes, inducing a chain of diseases including splanchnic damage, nosebleed, headache, perforation of the stomach, nerve disorder, intestines septum, and acute renal failure (Renzoni et al. 1998; Zhai et al. 2012; Hoyle et al. 2005; Zarlaida 2017). As such, exposure to low concentrations of Hg2+ can trigger numerous grievously damaging effects to the human heart, kidney, stomach, and intestines, resulting in metabolic disorders, motor and cognitive disorders, and sensory malfunctions and disorders (Rice et al. 2014; Hoyle and Handy 2005; Arya and Bhansali 2011; Ghasemi et al. 2018; Wang et al. 2008). This has resulted in stringent regulations imposed on relevant industries to bring about a clean-up system for mercury-laden wastewater before its discharge into waste streams. The maximum permissible limit of total mercury in wastewater discharge is 10 \u00b5g/L (US Environmental Protection Agency 2001; Kumar et al. 2012a). US EPA\u2019s previously regularised guideline of Hg2+ in drinking water of 1 \u00b5g/L was changed to 6 \u00b5g/L in 2005\u2014the former value being based on methylmercury (MeHg), whilst the recent guideline is based on inorganic mercury (Frisbie et al. 2015). Amongst the various heavy metals, Hg2+ ion shows the most toxicity, hence, the inspiration and need for its monitoring. These obvious environmental and biological threats which (Hg2+) poses have engendered the construction of methods for its detection and measurement in aqueous phases\u2014three of such widely exploited concepts being the fluorescent, colourimetric, and/or ratiometric detection modes due to their pre-eminence over other detection techniques.",

            "text": "The past twenty plus years of the arrival of the supramolecular chemistry have recorded stunning successes in the constructions of fluorescent, colourimetric, and ratiometric probes as vibrant, vital tools for the sensing of environmentally and biologically relevant cations and anions, and also for the detection of H+ (proton) in biological assays (Gunnlaugsson et al. 2006; Lodeiro and Pina 2009; Duke et al. 2010; Georgiev et al. 2011; Park et al. 2020). Compared to conventional analytical detection methods of voltammetry, polarography, X-ray fluorescence analysis, infrared spectroscopy, atomic fluorescence spectrometry, high-performance liquid chromatography, mass spectrometry, atomic absorption spectroscopy, etc., which have been utilised to recognise heavy metal ions like Hg2+, the fluorescence method is a preferred, sought-after, and powerful analytical tool. The fluorescence technique has been employed for molecular recognition since it offers the benefits of high spatial resolution, ultra-high sensitivity and selectivity, real-time detection, local observation, operational simplicity, equipment\u2019s inexpensiveness, quick response time, and non-destructive nature (Lee et al. 2015; Carter et al. 2014; Zhang et al. 2014; Kim et al. 2012, 2011; Chen et al. 2012; Yang et al. 2013; Singha et al. 2019). Because of these merits, there have been successful instances of the application of the fluorescent technique in clinical diagnostics, biotechnology, biochemistry and molecular biology, materials and environmental sciences (Mason 1999). It has been used for the monitoring of diverse groups of analytes including heavy metal ions, explosives, peptides, and pesticides (Bigdeli et al. 2019).",

Ratiometric fluorescence detection method affords the possibility of simultaneous recording of two measurable signals in the presence and absence of analyte (Grynkiewicz et al. 1985). This detection technique is usually both desirable and preferable as it can measure fluorescence signals at two different wavelengths unlike the traditional methods that measure fluorescence intensity only at a single wavelength. Fluorescent resonance energy transfer (FRET) allows for the possibility of precise and quantitative read-outs. Due to this desirable property of FRET, many ratiometric fluorescent probes, such as some discussed in this review, have been designed by adopting the FRET-based ratiometric approach. FRET, in principle, is a distance-dependent physical process involving the non-radiative transfer of energy from an excited molecular fluorophore, i.e. the donor, to another fluorophore, i.e. the acceptor, through an intermolecular long-range, dipole\u2013dipole coupling. FRET can measure molecular closeness at angstrom distances of 10\u2013100 \u00c5 and is highly efficient if the donor and acceptor are positioned within the F\u00f6rster radius (i.e. the distance at which half the excitation energy of the donor is transferred to the acceptor, usually 3\u20136 nm). FRET is a sensitive technique that could investigate biological processes which induce changes in molecular proximity as it is dependent on the one-sixth of inter-molecular separation (F\u00f6rster 965; Clegg 1996; Lakowicz 1999; dos Remedios et al. 1987). Apart from FRET, in the context of this review work, other detection mechanisms/strategies including photoinduced electron transfer (PET), internal charge transfer (ICT), \ufefftwisted intramolecular charge transfer (TICT), electron transfer (ET), energy transfer (eT), through-bond energy transfer (TBET), fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET), time-gated fluorescence resonance energy transfer (TG-FRET), aggregation-induced emission (AIE), through-bond fluorescence resonance energy transfer (TBFRET), etc., have also been employed for the design of some reported probes towards Hg2+detection.",

            "text": "Prompted by the efficacy of the fluorescence, colourimetric, and ratiometric detection techniques, a plethoric number of probes have been developed using various categories of fluorophore motifs. The analytical advantages of small-molecule probes have been recognised, viz high selectivity, bioorthogonality, minimal perturbation to living systems, high sensitivity, simplicity of manipulation, and non-sophistication of instrumentation (Chan et al. 2012; Chen et al. 2011). The year 1845 saw the report of the first fluorescent organic molecule, the sulphate of quinine, which was discovered by Sir John Herschel (1845), whilst the year 1852 saw the advent of the term \u2018fluorescence\u2019, which was conceptualised by Stokes (1845). The discovery of quinine sulphate (Fig. 1) has informed the discovery of many other organic compounds which fluoresce with distinctive colours. These include fluorescein and rhodamine derivatives, boron-dipyrromethene (BODIPY) dyes, cyanine dyes, and others (Fig. 1) (Zheng et al. 2013; Baeyer 1871; Ceresole 1888; Loudet and Burgess 2007; Luo et al. 2011). Dyes which fluoresce with red to near-infrared (NIR) light show great potentials for in vivo imaging in biological systems, owing to their ability to penetrate tissues in the red to near-infrared wavelength region (650\u2013900 nm) (Luo et al. 2011; Weissleder and Ntziachristos 2003). This has implied the development of a new class of dyes, which not only emit red or NIR fluorescence but possess higher extinction coefficients. This class of dyes anchors fluorophores functionalised with additional ring systems or heteroatoms or dye moieties which have been structurally modified. (Umezawa et al. 2008; Yuan et al. 2012; Egawa et al. 2011; Kim et al. 2011; Samanta et al. 2010). Lately, fluorescent dyes with two-photon imaging and super-resolution imaging abilities (Kim and Cho 2009; Krishna et al. 2006; Ma\u00e7\u00f4as et al. 2011) have been gaining momentum for sensing purposes.",

These strong merits make them employable as probes for imaging applications. Typically, MOFs have \ufefftwo components: the metal ion or cluster and the organic linker. Common organic linkers used for the constructions of MOFs have been summarised in a paper published by Allendorf\u2019s group. The properties of MOFs can be modulated easily by varying the linker, metal, and/or growth conditions (Allendorf et al. 2009). Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) are covalent porous crystalline polymers that enable the elaborate integration of organic building blocks into an ordered structure with atomic precision. \ufeffCOFs possess high thermal stabilities, low mass densities, and long-lasting porosity. These interesting properties of COFs have made them useful towards sensing ends. Both two-dimensional (2D) and three-dimensional (3D) COFs have been recognised (Feng et al. 2012). A diversity of building blocks is available for the development of COFs, and this has been given in a reported literature (James 2003).",

            "text": "Research investigations have found out that some drawbacks of fluorescent dyes can be combated or at the very least ameliorated by the enclosure of the dye in nanoparticle delivery systems (Koo et al. 2007). The distinctive optical and electronic properties of nanomaterials have informed their increasing use as probes and diagnostic agents (Xu et al. 2014). Probes based on nanomaterials possess the advantages of stronger fluorescent emission, large surface-area-to-volume ratio, stability, multifunctionality, target specificity, simplicity, novelty, high selectivity and sensitivity, excellent sensing parameters such as low detection limit and water solubility (Guo et al. 2014; Song et al. 2010). Common examples of nanomaterials include gold nanorods, silver nanoparticles, DNA oligomers, silica nanoparticles (Xu and Suslick 2010; Guo et al. 2009; Ritchie et al. 2007; Shang and Dong 2008; Zhou et al. 2016; Zhang et al. 2015a), quantum dots (QDs) (e.g. CdSe and CdTe), TiO2 NPs, SiO2 NPs, and Fe3O4 NPs (Lin et al. 2011). Probes based on QDs show superior features of outstanding stability, tunable and minuscule emission spectrum, large quantum yield and Stokes\u2019 shifts, wide excitation wavelength, which mirror the merits of synthetic organic probes. Graphene oxides (GOs) show tunable physicochemical properties and good dispersion ability in many solvents, especially in water (Freeman et al. 2009; Abdelhamid and Wu. 2015). Many mercuric (II) (Hg2+) nanoprobes either make use of the change in colour (absorption) or fluorescence intensity (\u2018turn on\u2019 and \u2018turn off\u2019) in their detection modes. Some of these can be DNA-functionalised or non-DNA-functionalised.",

The sensing properties of the probes under each subsection have been discussed by emphasising the parameters of the most suitable solvent system, optimum pH value/range, interference property, detection limit, and association constant. Some occasional mentions of the probes\u2019 utility in imaging Hg2+ in biological systems are also given. Sufficient references, totalling 196 articles, are reviewed in strength to keep abreast of the works done in various labs whilst ensuring succinctness of the report. All reported compounds either employ the fluorescence, colourimetric, and/or ratiometric method in their detection modes (Fig. 3). In some instances, however, the mentioned compounds make use of combined fluorescence or colourimetric or ratiometric methods in their sensing technique/detection methodology. This review closes by giving a brief conclusion that will help guide future research works in the chemistry of Hg2+ sensing.",

The linear range of detection was within 0\u201312 nM, whilst the detection limit was calculated as 43 nM. The probe was also capable of Hg2+ monitoring in the solid state.

The design strategy was based on the combination of both PET and ICT, which allow for a dual analyte monitoring mode. (PET-based probe design involves the fluorophore unit connected to the ionophore unit through a spacer, whilst ICT-based probe design involves the direct connection of the fluorophore unit and ionophore unit to form a single species (Gupta and Kumar 2016.) The reported compound underwent a multiplication in its fluorescence signal intensity after Hg2+ was added, whilst the other ions tested together did not modulate the fluorescence signal intensity of the probe significantly. There was a linear response of the probe for Hg2+ monitoring with the detection limit reportedly low to the level of 2.40 \u00d7 10\u20137 M (lower than those of previously reported probes), and the association constant reportedly high as 4.12 \u00d7 105 M.

In phosphate buffer, the two compounds display ultra-high-level sensitivities and selectivities for Hg2+ detection. It was observed that Hg-2 and Hg-3 could detect Hg2+ over a vast expanse of pH, between 7.0 and 10.0. In a 10 \u03bcM solution of Hg-2 in phosphate buffer (pH = 7.5), upon the addition of cations like Ag+, Al3+, Ba2+, Cd2+, Ca2+, Co2+, Cr3+, Cu2+, Fe2+, Li+, K+, Na+, Mg2+, Zn2+, Mn2+, Pb2+, Ni2+, and Hg2+, only Hg2+ led to ca. 90% suppression of the fluorescence intensity of Hg-2; meanwhile, the other cations impressed only benign effects on the fluorescence intensity. A similar observation went for Hg-3. There was linearity in Hg2+ monitoring by Hg-2 between the concentration range of 2 and 10 \u03bcM, and the lowest detection limits of Hg-2 and Hg-3 for Hg2+ detection were 2.1 \u03bcM and 3.1 \u03bcM, respectively. Analytically, Hg-2 exhibits higher selectivity and sensitivity towards Hg2+ than Hg-3, this being accrued to the fact that the conjugation action of morpholine which exists in Hg-3 makes it to poorly bind to Hg2+. The proton NMR of the binding of Hg-2 to Hg2+ shows the disappearance of a major peak downfield in the NMR spectrum upon the addition of Hg2+.",

The reported Probe Hg-6 could allow the detection of Hg2+ ion in an amount as low as 2.7 \u03bcM. The isomeric probes Hg-6 and Hg-7 were demonstrated to exhibit varied sensing behaviours with Hg-6 showing a faster signalling speed than Hg-7. This was explained as due to the carbon resonance of the more electron-rich thiocarbonyl group of Hg-6 which possesses more electron-rich sulphur and appears in a higher field (192.5 ppm) than that of Hg-7 which appears in a lower field (194.2 ppm) (Fig. 9). The signalling behaviour of the dithio-derivative, Hg-8, was not reported, only that upon interaction with Hg2+, it became desulphurised to the monothiol-derivative, Hg-7.",

The optimum experimental pH range for the sensing of Hg2+ by Hg-13 was found to be 6\u201311. At 586 nm, a sizeable fluorescent escalation of about 1500-fold increment was noted upon Hg2+ addition to the solution of the probe in the presence of other alkali, alkaline earth, and transition metal ions (Na+, K+, Ca2+, Mg2+, Cr3+, Fe3+, Fe2+, Cd2+, Mn2+, Pb2+, Zn2+, Cu2+, Ag+, Co2+, Ni2+) investigated under identical testing conditions.

A fast response time (there was no apparent time delay) was demonstrated in the tracking of Hg2+ by Hg-13 as justified by the results of the real-time analysis. Utilising the fluorescence imaging experiments, the biological utility of Hg-13 demonstrated its ability to image Hg2+ in living HeLa cells whereby an MTT assay gave cell viability of 95% after treatment with 10 \u03bcM of the compound after 24 h of incubation.",

The compound, which functions as a chemodosimeter rather than as a probe, could detect Hg2+ in the broad and stable pH range of 6.0\u201310.0, although with the optimums pH range being 7.2\u20137.6. In 0.01 M HEPES-buffer ethanol solution (EtOH/H2O 1:8, v/v, pH = 7.4) solution, the proposed compound Hg-15 revealed a remarkable increase in its fluorescence intensity only upon contact with Hg2+ in the co-presence of several other cations, which induced neither an individual nor a collective effect(s) on the fluorescence intensity of Hg-15. 5-min response time for the monitoring of Hg2+ by Hg-15 was observed. The Job\u2019s method of continuous variation gives a 1:1 stoichiometric ratio between Hg-15 and Hg2+ in the Hg-15/Hg2+ complex. An estimated detection limit of 4.2 \u00d7 10\u20138 M was obtained, and Hg-15 was successfully demonstrated as capable of monitoring Hg2+ in living cells via confocal laser scanning microscopy (CSLM).",

Such systems have been proven effective for the highly sensitive and selective sensing of Hg2+ in the joint existence of other metal ions when spectroscopically investigated in CH3CN/HEPES buffer (1:1, v/v, pH = 7.0). There was a 7.09-fold fluorescence enhancement when Hg2+ was added to a solution of Probe Hg-27 (Fig. 24), this being attributed to a Hg2+-chelated spirolactam ring opening. Meanwhile, the association constant and detection limit of Probe Hg-27 for Hg2+ monitoring are 8.31 \u00d7 105 M\u22121 and 7.91 \u00d7 10\u20137 mol L\u22121, respectively.

There is operational ease in the tuning of their visible excitation and emission by simply modifying the pyrrole core (Loudet and Burgess 2007; Thoresen et al. 1998; Rurack et al. 2001). They also possess high fluorescence quantum yields (\u03a6F \u2248 1.0, even in water), high molar absorption coefficients (typically log max > 8.8), narrow emission bandwidths, and excellent photostability. They lack a net ionic charge, and their fluorescence is insensitive to solvent or pH.

Desirably, these cations impacted only a meagre effect on Hg-36\u2032s fluorescence emission intensity. The apparent dissociation constant of Hg-36/Hg2+ was calculated to be 62 \u03bcM. The sensing property of Hg-36 was tested by mixing it with other cations like Ag+, Ca2+, Cd2+, Co2+, Cu2+, Fe2+, Fe3+, K+, Mg2+, Mn2+, Ni2+, Pb2+, and Zn2+. Experimental results revealed that the fluorescence emission intensity of the BODIPY derivative underwent a substantial increase upon the addition of Hg2+, but remained unperturbed when other metal ions were added. Job\u2019s method indicated a 1:1 binding ratio between the detecting compound and the detected ion. The dissociation constant of 62.1 \u00b1 5.7 \u03bcM was obtained.

However, when the pH changed to > 6.96 by the addition of PBS buffer, there was a sudden appearance of vibrant fluorescence intensity with an accompanying colour variation from colourless to purple. This is due to the formation of O-anionic compound from the resorufin in the probe. The incremental additions of Hg2+ (0\u20131.0 \u03bcM) incited a 25-fold enhancement of the compound\u2019s fluorescence intensity. However, the addition of a dozen of cations including Ca2+, Cd2+, Co2+, Cu2+, Mg2+, Mn2+, Zn2+, Ag2+, Pb2+, Fe3+, Fe2+, Ni2+ did not alter the fluorescence intensity significantly under the similar investigation conditions. The limit of detection of Probe Hg-61 for Hg2+ was quantified as 0.15 \u03bcM or 30 \u03bcg/L. The potent value of Compound Hg-61 was realised in its application to track Hg2+ analyte ion in the A549 cell line of a 5-day-old zebrafish and human lung adenocarcinoma epithelial origins (Fig. 53).",

            "text": "From the foregoing careful discussion on various kinds of fluorescent, colourimetric, and/or ratiometric Hg2+-selective probes developed from diverse fluorophore motifs, these important generalisations are made:Probes such as Probes Hg-1, Hg-7, Hg-8, and Hg-13 appended with solubilising groups like the amino group, \u2013NH2, tend to be more soluble in water than those without this functionality. Moreover, amino group-appended probes possess enhanced quantum yield than their counterparts without this functional group.For ages, there has been a heavy reliance on the use of nitrogen-centric motifs for the construction of Hg2+ probes, but the need for nitrogen coordination for signalling processes usually encounters some inadequacies. Besides an exclusive reliance on nitrogen coordination chemistry, there is always a possibility of false-positive signalling owing to protonation or pH sensitivity. This limitation has been largely tackled by a research focus shifting towards the employment of sulphur-incorporating groups, although this also is not without its restraints.Hg2+ being a soft Lewis acid and equally possessing a strong thiophilic affinity has prompted many reported Hg2+-selective probes typically to employ sulphur as a soft donor atom to facilitate a tight binding to the metal as part of the fluorescence probe architectures. Reported probes that employ this strategy include Probes Hg-4, Hg-6, Hg-7, to mention a few. Only a few probes for Hg2+ based on alkynes have been developed according to the \u03c0 electrophilicity of Hg2+. Furthermore, their signalling modes are due to the irreversible chemical reactions of alkynes as opposed to reversible interactions. This impedes their practical applications. As a basic requirement, ideal probes should possess a reversibility property (Dong et al. 2017).Most longstanding strategies employed for the design of Hg2+-selective probes are based on the complexation or chemical reaction between the probes and Hg2+. The reaction-based design includes Hg2+-induced desulphurisation and desulphurisation which ensues in cyclisation to the heterocycle, mercuration, and Hg2+-promoted hydrolysis reactions. Comprised in the latter category is a typical reaction-based strategy tagged \u2018Hg2+-promoted deprotection of thioacetals\u2019 which has been taken advantage of to generate a host of probes. Reported probes which makes use of this design strategy include Probes Hg-14, Hg-15, Hg-21\u2013Hg-25, Hg-53, Hg-57, Hg-58, etc.There is increasing gravitation towards the use of red to near-infrared (NIR) probes (which possess > 600 nm) owing to their merits of profound tissue penetration, reduced photodamage to biological models and lowered interference ensuing from background autofluorescence of biomolecules in living systems. This is particularly relevant to the construction of rhodamine probes since the absorption and emission wavelengths of most rhodamine derivatives are < 600 nm, placing a restraint on their biological applications. Instances of NIR probes reported in this review include the case of Probe Hg-32.Probes, such as Probes Hg-9, Hg-32, Hg-48, Hg-56, Hg-65, and others that make use of ratiometric fluorescence signalling mode are more desirable and gaining increasing research attention than those with a single fluorescence response wavelength. Basically, ratiometric probes operate by making use of the ratio of the emission intensity at two different wavelengths. Ratiometric detection strategy eradicates uncertainties mostly due to environmental conditions like polarity, pH, temperature, and non-homogeneity of distribution of fluorescent indicators in cells. Sterling instances of such probes include the squaraines-based probes which possess long excitation and emission wavelengths (have sharp absorption around ca. 640 nm).Inorganic quantum dots are gaining grounds as alternative fluorophores due to their good photobleaching anti-resistance and possession of high quantum yields and wide light-absorption band. Unfortunately, inorganic quantum dots typically contain Se, Cd, Pb, or other toxic elements (Das and Tan 2008). Carbon QDs have replaced inorganic QDs as the former possess greater photostability and reduced toxicity. Recently, graphene oxide (GO), which contains carbon (being environmental-friendly, earth-abundant, and inexpensive), has emerged as a new fluorophore because of its good water solubility, strong photoluminescence, great mechanical strength, facile surface alteration, and the ability for bio-conjugation.A rapid response time is highly essential for either an on-site or online field monitoring. Good response times have been achieved by many of the reported probes, including Probes Hg-10, Hg-13, Hg-14, Hg-15, Hg-16, Hg-32, Hg-41, Hg-61, etc.In all analytical detection sense, fluorescence \u2018turn on\u2019 probes are more sought after than their fluorescence \u2018turn off\u2019 counterparts since the former usually display lower background and higher sensitivity than the latter (Wang et al. 2013).",

Probes that exhibit fluorescence or colourimetric variation in response to various analytes are preferable to other types of probes, as they emit easily recognisable optical response by fluorimeters or simply by naked eyes. The main features highlighted in the reported probes in this review were the parameters of the most suitable solvent system, optimum pH value/range, interference property, detection limit, and association constant. The environmental and/or biological utilities of these probes are also discussed wherever possible. Even though research works on the detection of Hg2+ have been very successful thus far, there still exist a couple of lingering obstacles which need tackling for the achievement of further advancements in the science of Hg2+ detection.",

Meanwhile, many organic probes require laborious synthetic methods, whilst probes based on quantum dots (QDs) exhibit toxicity. Besides, a large proportion of these probes possess very short fluorescence lifetime and utilise visible light emission which cannot be used in in vivo sensing. Other challenges are irreversible Hg2+ complexation, poor selectivity, and long response time. Perhaps the greater challenge, now, is the difficulty in designing and synthesising probes that could overcome all these challenges.",
