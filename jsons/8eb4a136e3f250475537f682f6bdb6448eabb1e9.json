While decreased alertness and increased anxiety can be considered side effects of symptomatology, symptoms alone may not be responsible for the psychomotor and attention deficits of colds and influenza, respectively. An alternative hypothesis, as proposed in this review, suggests that the immune response, in the form of a cytokine cascade, may be responsible for both the physical and psychological symptoms. In particular, patterns of cytokine production for each infection will dictate the symptoms and performance deficits both within and between viruses. This hypothesis can be extended to incorporate infectious mononucleosis, as well as colds and influenza. The efficacy of symptom-based overthe-counter medications is then called into question.",

In a meta-analytic review, Pilcher and Huffcutt (1996) found that partial deprivation, or sleep fragmentation, had \"a considerably greater overall impact\" (p. 322) on mood than long-term deprivation. Varied sleep patterns, in the form of increased slow-wave and decreased REM sleep, are also a common feature of illness (Hart, 1988 , also see Mullington et al., 2000) , these sleep phases being considered restorative for physical and cognitive functioning, respectively (Graves, Pack, & Abel, 2001; . The overall quality of sleep may then be reduced during times of illness, as supported by Drake et al. (2000) , who demonstrated significant decreases in total sleep time and sleep efficiency in volunteers challenged with a rhinovirus. Pilcher, Schoeling, and Prosansky (2000) also found significant correlations between sleep quality and subjective ratings of alertness, although the Drake et al. results did not support this. Hence, the possibility that the URTI-associated depressed mood is a result of disrupted sleep patterns and a subsequent decrease in sleep quality cannot be discounted.",

For example, despite the consistent use of analysis of covariance, individual variations may have been amplified by the small sizes of the infected groups, which therefore may not be representative of the general population (e.g., , who had an influenza B group of three participants). Savory (1992) also considered the classification of uninfected participants as healthy controls to be problematic as they, too, had been inoculated with the virus. An apparent lack of matching of the controls to the experimental group may add to the classification problems, as parameters such as age and gender are considered to be influential on performance under certain conditions.",

Hall and Smith (1996a) , for example, have classified their focussedattention task as attention-based but the temporal and spatial location of the stimulus are known. The task simply requires the use of predominantly psychomotor functions in the form of responding appropriately (pressing either the A or B key on a keyboard) to the presentation of each stimulus. Consistent with this description is the finding that colds rather than influenza impaired performance on this task (Smith et al., 1989) . Furthermore, Drake et al.

The definition of an infection as \"clinical\", however, as adopted by the Common Cold Unit, from Beare and Reed's (1977) method of classification, suggests that a small number of mild symptoms may still be apparent. Research of a more immunological nature has also utilised a similar method, with most referring to a clinical cold as an illness that has accumulated a specific number of points on a Symptom Scale. Zhu, Tang, Gwaltney, Wu, and Elias (1997) , for example, classified participants as having a clinical cold if their Total Symptom Scores were 5 plus either nasal discharge for 3 days or the subjects' belief that a cold had occurred. As such, the distinction between a clinical and a subclinical infection is arbitrary and rather subjective. Harris and Gwaltney (1996) also supported the possibility of symptoms during the asymptomatic phase of an infection. Their study on the incubation period of a rhinovirus infection found that some symptoms were present as early as two hours following inoculation. Shibayama et al. (1996) also found an increase in mucus production in the asymptomatic group. Furthermore, there is evidence to suggest that the severity of impairment varies between the symptomatic and asymptomatic phases. In particular, influenza B impairment was more severe during a clinical infection and less severe in the incubation period or a subclinical infection (Smith, Tyrrell, Al-Nakib, et al., 1988) . Circumstantial evidence suggests, then, that symptoms are present during the so-called asymptomatic phase of an illness, and therefore may still be involved in impairment. The nature of the symptoms in both influenza and the common cold, though, may contraindicate any causal role this aspect has with impairment, as these infections are not always distinguishable on clinical grounds (Nicholson, 1998) .",

Research supports cytokines as a mechanism of symptomatology by showing a temporal relationship between cytokines and symptom groups (e.g., Yoon, Zhu, Gwaltney & Elias, 1999 , observed a temporal relationship between IL-1 and symptomatology during a rhinovirus infection).

A spray of bradykinin into the nasal passages caused symptoms similar to that of a cold, as well as a sore throat. Higgins (1988, 1991) have used the cytokine-challenge technique to investigate the effects of the interferon (IFN)-ca on performance. Interferons are antiviral cytokines that infected cells release in order to warn and protect nearby healthy cells. When IFN-ca is used as an antiviral treatment, influenza-like side effects on health have been observed, such as fatigue. Smith et al. speculated that IFN-ct, as a cytokine involved in a systemic immune response, might be able to account for the influenza impairment through interaction with the CNS and, more specifically, the frontal lobes.",

Furthermore, many cytokines are able to initiate and control the production of others (e.g., IL-1 and tumor necrosis factor-a are able to induce the production of IL-8), indicating that these mediators may function as a network in order to generate the immune response. This implies that IFN-a alone, for example, would not cause an entire profile of impairment, but rather would act with other cytokines in order to do so, which is supported by Smith, Tyrrell, Coyle, and Higgins's (1991) study.

By using two experimental groups (those who were infected with a respiratory syncytial virus and those who were infected with another cold-producing virus), the study was able to demonstrate that all four cytokines were present, regardless of the viral strain present in the volunteers. A comparison of the literature on rhinoviruses and influenza A also indicates that a number of cytokines may be part of a generic response to any URTI.

IL-I may simply be more relevant to the rhinovirus infection than influenza, as the latter infection does not utilise this receptor. Thus, discrepancies in cytokine production between infection types may be able to explain the psychological differences between colds and influenza. In fact, the possibility that virusspecific profiles of psychological impairment could be a reflection of virus-specific patterns in the immune response is something that demands systematic research.",

This finding is not supported by the earlier studies, though. Influenza and acute IM also differ quite markedly with regard to symptomatology. Acute IM features a \"characteristic triad\" of fever, pharyngeal inflammation, and inflammation of the lymph nodes at the neck (Hornef, Wagner, Kruse & Kirchner, 1995, p. 209) , suggesting this to be a more physically severe viral infection. Hall and Smith (1996b) also made a comparison between acute and chronic IM (defined as > 6 months since the onset of the illness) and found that the two infected groups did not differ on a measure of symptomatology. It was suggested, however, that the majority of chronic IM sufferers might have felt as though they had not yet recovered from the acute illness, as they did not exhibit any characteristic after-effects. Differences were noted between the two on performance measures, though, suggesting a strong argument for dissociation between symptoms and impairment. Crocker et al. (1997) did not appear to find any significant differences between acute and chronic IM on a measure of symptom severity, or on tests of performance. Corney et al. (1994) attempted no comparison between the two IM groups, though, so this result cannot be validated at this time. A study by White, Dash, and Thomas (1998) , however, found that the impairment on a measure of information processing decreased over a 6-month period, from the onset of IM, as did a subjective rating of concentration.",

The two main approaches in removing this, as with most health problems, are prevention and treatment. For influenza, vaccinations are now readily available and antiviral agents, which inhibit viral replication, are also considered to be effective. Such preventative measures are difficult to produce for the common cold, though, due to the vast array of cold-producing pathogens (the rhinovirus alone has 100+ serotypes) (Sperber, 1994) . Furthermore, antiviral agents are most effective when taken immediately after exposure to the virus, rather than as a treatment once the symptoms are apparent (see Turner et al., 1999) .

While the alleviation of symptoms may be a priority, the literature highlighted in this review suggests that the psychological features of an infection cannot be ignored. Smith and members of the Common Cold Unit in the UK have studied both zinc gluconate lozenges and nedocromil sodium (Smith, Tyrrell, Al-Nakib, et al., 1991) , the mechanisms of which are unclear, but there are no known studies on the impact of symptom-based medication on URTI-associated impairment. A brief consideration of the mechanisms underlying these treatments may provide an argument for or against their efficacy in this regard.",

Decongestants, such as pseudoephedrine, are sympathomimetic in nature and are considered to be effective by constricting blood vessels in the nasal passage and sinuses (Jawad & Eccles, 1998) . This, in turn, leads to a reduction in nasal symptoms such as congestion (Taverner, Danz & Economos, 1999) and sneezing (Bye et al., 1980) . The antihistamines are also used in order to combat sneezing and rhinorrhea associated with URTIs, but while this group of compounds may be effective in treating seasonal allergies, many are considered to be little better than a placebo in treating the symptoms of a cold (Smith & Feldman, 1993) . This general ineffectiveness is believed to be due to the absence of histamine in the immune response to viral infections. A review by Smith and Feldman highlighted several studies where a number of antihistamines (e.g., chlorpheniramine) reduced symptom scores but it is likely that such effects were due to the drying out of nasal secretions (Sperber, 1994) rather than an inhibition of the immune response.",

Echinacea is an increasingly popular herbal remedy with immunomodulatory properties (Melchart et al., 1995) ; that is, regulation or stimulation of the immune response. More specifically, this treatment is thought to \"activate the immune system via cytokine pathways\" (Burger, Torres, Warren, Caldwell & Hughes, 1997, p. 377) , possibly by increasing the migration of cells to the site of infection. While this may lead to an increase in cytokine production, the level of cells present allows for greater elimination of the pathogen from the body before the infection can become fully established. Consistent with this proposal is the reduction in duration and severity of the illness as found by Barrett, Vohmann, and Calabrese (1999) . Due to the properties underlying the efficacy of echinacea, the hypothesis can be made that this form of therapy could also alleviate the impairments associated with an URTI.",

It may be the differences in cytokine production between the types of viruses that lead to the observable patterns in both physical and psychological symptoms.

The patterns within the response may determine both the clinical and the psychological features of a particular infection, and subsequently dictate the differences between infections.",

The issue of performance decrements then becomes important for medical and occupational reasons, as the symptoms are the major cause of absenteeism.
