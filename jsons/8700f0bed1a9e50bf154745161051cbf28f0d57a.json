[6] [7] [8] [9] No proven effective treatment has been 210 identified, and a vaccine for widespread use is not yet available. In response to the virus, 211 state/provincial and local governments instituted shelter-in-place orders, and non-essential 212 ambulatory care was significantly curtailed. This included either outright cancellation or 213 considerable prioritization of allergy/immunology services. 2,10,11 Guidance on how to scale 214 down services in the setting of the COVID-19 pandemic was recently published in mid-March, 215 supported by the AAAAI, ACAAI, and CSACI jointly. 2 At the time of this writing, rates of new 216 infections and fatalities may be reaching a plateau and/or declining to levels where some state 217 and local municipalities are now lifting shelter-in-place orders, with or without \"safer-at-home\" 218 or other less restrictive orders, though in certain areas, the infection rate may not yet have 219 peaked. 12,13 Correspondingly, restrictions on provision of routine ambulatory care will likely be 220 lifted. While there may be oscillation between shelter-in-place and safer-at-home orders over the 221 next several months as additional waves of the virus may occur, there is a need to help guide the 222 allergy/immunology clinician on how to re-initiate services. Similar to other epidemic forms of 223 coronavirus and viral pandemics, it is expected that COVID-19 will circulate within our 224 communities for months or longer. 14 As such, it is essential that we stratify the provision of 225 services and develop a plan for how to increase or decrease service capacity.

Determining staff availability for scheduling (e.g., based on high-risk conditions, 279 childcare needs, etc.) 280 281 As the spread and burden of the pandemic has been variable with regard to geographic 282 locations and demographic groups, approaches for one practice or area may be more or 283 less applicable to another, as was the case with recommendations on how to scale down 284 services. 2 However, the essential concepts should remain universally applicable. 285 286 General Guiding Principles: 287 These are unprecedented times and circumstances, currently framed by uncertainty due to limited 288 data concerning SARS-CoV-2 and the current political and economic influences that may be 289 motivating local, state, and national policies. This makes already difficult decision-making even 290 more challenging. All situations have trade-offs, and as society begins modifying mitigation 291 responses, the threshold for where the risk of continuing to defer management of the patient's 292 underlying medical conditions exceeds the risk of infection transmission may begin to change, 293 and we have a continuing duty to adapt to the needs of our patients. In this context, there are 294 common goals of providing all necessary care and doing so safely. Unfortunately, the risk of 295 SARS-CoV-2 transmission will likely exist for the foreseeable future. Therefore, as services are restored, safety cannot be entirely guaranteed, even with use of PPE and screening. 20 Patients, 297 clinicians, and office staff need to be vigilant to minimize the risk of office-based SARS-CoV-2 298 transmission. A new normal (or \"abnormal\") exists, where practices are tasked with minimizing 299 the risk of transmission to their staff as a top priority, given the potential risk of care disruption 300 if the healthcare workforce becomes sick. So long as current restrictions regarding the 301 practice of telehealth remain relaxed, , very strong consideration should be given to 302 conducting as many visits as possible via telehealth where this option exists, as well as 303 continuing this practice until current risk levels decline such that requirements for PPE 304 and social/physical distancing are significantly relaxed and the risk of acquiring infection 305 in an office in which appropriate precautions are in place is reduced. 2,21,22 Such guidance is 306 in accordance with recommendations at www.cdc.gov and 307 https://www.canada.ca/en/services/health.html 23 regarding limiting in-person visits to medical 308 providers, though such guidance is fluid and may evolve. 309 310Much may have been learned already regarding the ability to effectively deliver care via 311 telehealth, and telehealth need not be viewed as a secondary option moving forward, provided 312 that payment parity and expanded guidelines continue. Parity is particularly important given 313 reduced in-person clinical volumes. The rapid conversion to telehealth visits by many has 314 demonstrated this is an effective primary means of healthcare delivery. Many clinics will 315 consider utilizing a mix of in-person and virtual medicine in order to mitigate risk. In an 316 environment with the uncertainty of infectious risk, telehealth can be maximized as a gatekeeper 317 visit (provided regulations continue to be relaxed permitting enhanced use of telehealth for new 318 visits), 21 where problems can be discussed and a shared-decision can be reached about the need 319 for any in-person services, thereby reducing unnecessary exposure for patient, clinician, and 320 staff, and conserving limited PPE reserves. Telehealth may also help prioritize the level of PPE 321 that should be used for each encounter.

            "text": "rollout: Community Infection Risk Remains High 331This phase incorporates the initial re-opening of previously curtailed services, where some (but 332 not all) restrictions on ambulatory or non-essential medical care are lifted. Practices can 333 consider resuming select face-to-face visits despite a high rate of community transmission of 334 COVID-19 and lack of widespread availability of testing, so long as PPE supply is adequate, 335 risk mitigation has been discussed with the staff, job roles are reviewed, and a modified, 336 workable scheduling template has been created. While face-to-face visits are resumed for 337 medical problems with the highest acuity, telehealth should continue for all but the most 338 necessary visits where a time-sensitive procedure is recommended, provided current telehealth 339 expanded guidelines remain in place. At the time of scheduling, discussions with patients about 340 potential risk and benefit of telehealth vs. in-person visits, including the likelihood particular 341 services may be provided at the visit, should be initiated to help determine which visit format is 342 most appropriate. New initiation of immunotherapy to allergens other than venom is still not 343 recommended, although a modified schedule/protocol may be adapted for current 344 immunotherapy patients based upon PPE supply and physical distancing capabilities. 345Spirometry is still contraindicated in most scenarios due to the aerosolization risk, except in 346 highly individualized situations where it would be essential for immediate treatment decisions 347 that could not otherwise be made without such information and where it can be performed with 348 appropriate precautions and room/equipment disinfection. 25 Office-based administration of 349 biologics, as well as infusions, can be prioritized if home administration is not appropriate, 350 possible or desired. The highest priority should be assigned to patients unable to connect for 351 telehealth visits with conditions meeting more urgent/priority recommendations as detailed in 352 Tables 1and 2. Appropriate communication to all patients regarding new precautions must be 353 conducted prior to their in-person visit. In addition, screening protocols should be established in 354 accordance with current CDC, Health Canada, or local health department recommendations, and 355",

Though venom 390 immunotherapy can continue to be initiated, routine initiation of inhalant immunotherapy is not 391 generally recommended in this phase, given required weekly face-to-face visits during the 392 buildup towards maintenance, but can be considered in patients who have refractory rhinitis or 393 asthma with inadequate control using other medical measures. Additional expansion of patients 394 needing biologics or office-based infusions can occur. Initiation and updosing of oral food 395 immunotherapy remain generally not recommended; however, as with all forms of 396 immunotherapy, consideration may be made in certain situations in which the benefits and safety 397 of therapy outweigh the risks of contracting COVID-19. 398 399 Phase 3 rollout: Community Infection Risk Declining. 400In the third phase, there is significant differentiation from phases 1 and 2, with now very low 401 rates of community transmission (accompanied by strict contact tracing), readily available and 402 widespread testing, and/or an effective treatment and/or vaccine exists. Given the marked 403 decrease in risk of transmission, as well as effective identification of cases and treatment, this 404 represents a clear threshold where the risk of face-to-face visits has lowered to the point that 405 telehealth as the preferred encounter medium can be reduced and more in-clinic visits can be 406 scheduled in accordance with lessening of social/physical distancing, permitting more utilization 407 of clinical space and a lesser need for PPE. Screening protocols may have changed but will 408 likely remain in place to some extent. There should be continuation of shared decision-making 409 regarding preference for type of visit, recognizing that patients may prefer telehealth for 410 particular visits, providing telehealth remains an option under expanded policies as infection risk 411 lowers. Routine spirometry can begin to be reintroduced, as can office-based rhinolaryngoscopy. 412 PPE should be considered for both rhinoscopy and spirometry, given the potential risk for 413 indirect aerosolization. 25 Specifically, rhinoscopy poses both droplet as well as potential indirect 414 aerosolization risk from this being a procedure that manipulates the pharyngeal mucous 415 membranes and may precipitate cough/gag/sneeze from patients. 27 High, medium, and low 416 priority skin testing, food/drug challenge and desensitization procedures, new environmental 417 immunotherapy starts/reinitiation (including sublingual immunotherapy), and wait list patients 418 unable to connect to telehealth can be scheduled. Oral immunotherapy updosing can resume and 419 new starts can be initiated, given a lower likelihood of service disruption to updosing visit, or 420 baseline viral transmission. 421 422 Phase 4 rollout: Post-pandemic/\"Normal\" Operations 423Phase 4 essentially represents as close a return to pre-SARS-CoV-2 operations in the post-424 pandemic landscape as possible. In this phase, herd immunity or vaccine(s) exists (with wide 425 adoption), and/or community transmission is very low, with limited risk of exposure from a 426 casual encounter. There would be no social distancing requirement and no need for PPE (beyond 427 pre-SARS-CoV-2 norms). Screening protocols may remain to some extent. All normal services 428 would be recommended to be operational. 429430Special Consideration: Primary and Secondary Immunodeficiency 431While care for all allergy/immunology patients is important, patients with known or suspected 432 immune defects may have the highest risk for life-threatening complications, worsened 433 depression/quality of life, and concerns about medication shortages and therefore require special 434 attention. 28 Efforts are presently underway to systematically understand global risk, but the risk 435",

            "text": "to the care of the patient (vs. telehealth services, as deemed by their clinical 452 immunologist). Furthermore, immunocompromised patients are more likely to have a 453 pre-existing need for droplet/contact/reverse precautions, and thus a more specific 454 requirement for provider or patient PPE. Given the nature of clinic/consultation visits 455 with clinical immunologists, many of the services provided -including counseling and 456 data review -can be provided remotely (via telehealth). Exceptions to remote services 457 include: 458i. Infusion Services -For those patients who require intravenous infusions of blood-459 derived products (such as immune globulin) or biologic agents that are not 460 provided in-home, they will continue to receive such services in their respective 461 infusion centers. For those patients who require subcutaneous injections of 462 biologic agents that are not provided in-home, they will continue to receive such 463 services in a clinical setting, with consideration for use of visiting nurses to 464 convert this to home administration if appropriate. For patients on intravenous 465 immune globulin (IVIG), the risks and benefits of transitioning to self-466 administered subcutaneous immune globulin (SCIG) should be discussed with the 467 patient/family. 468ii. Vaccinations -Select patients will require administration of vaccines for either 469 added protection against specific pathogens to which they may be uniquely 470 susceptible and/or as part of their diagnostic evaluation. Preferably, vaccines 471 would be administered by the primary care provider of the patient; however, in 472 instances where this may not be possible, administration of select vaccines may be 473 coordinated through an allergy/immunology office or practice. 474iii. Spirometry/Plethysmography -Select patients will require spirometry or 475 plethysmography, which are services they will continue to receive through either 476 the office/practice, pending resumption of these services once deemed to be safe, 477 or, if needed, could be arranged in a setting that minimizes aerosolization risk. 478 iv. Imaging Services -Select patients will require diagnostic imaging, which is a 479 service they will continue to receive through local radiology practices in an 480 outpatient or hospital setting. 481 v. Laboratory Services -Select patients will require blood, urine, stool, and/or nasal 482 virology studies, which are services they will continue to receive through the 483 outpatient or hospital setting. 484 vi. Consideration for Convalescent Plasma Administration -As we better understand 485 the risks and benefits of convalescent plasma in both preventing and treating 486 COVID-19, some patients may be considered for such therapy (or other newly 487 developed preventative therapy that may emerge) either clinically or as part of 488 national trials. 36 489 Some of the above considerations may be applicable to patients without immune deficiency. should be incorporated into this new paradigm on continual change, given the movement may be 505 forward and even backward through the phases as this is an evolving situation. This document, 506 in combination with the COVID-19 preparation document, can provide a rationale for handling 507 the uncertain future with respect to the SARS-CoV-2 or any other potential pandemic. Please 508 check the AAAAI website COVID-19 resource page (https://education.aaaai.org/resources-for-a-509 i-clinicians/covid-19) for ongoing updates and recommendations that have been issued regarding 510 resuming practice as well, which offers some more general recommendations. 24 511 512 provider-fact-sheet Accessed April 28, 2020. 556",
