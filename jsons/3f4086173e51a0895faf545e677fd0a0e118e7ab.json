            "text": "We have reported previously on use of a web-based application, Supramap (http://supramap.org) for the study of biogeographic, genotypic, and phenotypic evolution. Using Supramap we have developed maps of the spread of drug-resistant influenza and host shifts in H1N1 and H5N1 influenza and coronaviruses such as SARS. Here we report on another zoonotic pathogen, H7 influenza, and provide an update on the implementation of Supramap as a web service. We find that the emergence of pathogenic strains of H7 is labile with many transitions from high to low pathogenicity, and from low to high pathogenicity. We use Supramap to put these events in a temporal and geospatial context. We identify several lineages of H7 influenza with biomarkers of high pathogenicity in regions that have not been reported in the scientific literature. The original implementation of Supramap was built with tightly coupled client and server software. Now we have decoupled the components to provide a modular web service for POY (http:// poyws.org) that can be consumed by a data provider to create a novel application. To demonstrate the web service, we have produced an application, Geogenes (http://geogenes.org). Unlike in Supramap, in which the user is required to create and upload data files, in Geogenes the user works from a graphical interface to query an underlying dataset. Geogenes demonstrates how the web service can provide underlying processing for any sequence and metadata database.",

Viral molecular evolution associated with pathogenicity can occur via point mutations or intersegmental recombination (Hirst et al., 2004) . Many suggest that three or more polybasic amino acid inserts 5\u00a2 of the HA proteolytic cleavage site serves as a biomarker for pathogenicity (Chen et al., 1998; Steinhauer, 1999) . However, recent studies have shown that this model is not universally applicable (Ro\u00a8hm et al., 1996; Senne et al., 1996; OIE, 2009; Uchida et al., 2011) . While acknowledging improvements in molecular understanding of viral pathogenicity, the World Organization for Animal Health (OIE [Office International des Epizooties]) uses animal testing to assess pathogenicity. Pathogenic viruses are classified as such when they cause 75% mortality in chicks that have been inoculated with a strain of interest (Alexander, 2003; OIE, 2009 ).",
