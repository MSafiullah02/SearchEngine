The virus was thus named \"human bocavirus\" (HBoV). By a specific polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay, the virus was found to be present in 17 (3.1%) of 540 respiratory specimens collected from hospitalized children over a 1-year period [11] . Subsequently, HBoV has been reported in respiratory samples from children in various parts of the world (including Australia, North America, Europe, Asia, and Africa), suggesting that the virus is circulating worldwide [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] .

In a recent study, HBoV DNA was found to be frequently present in serum samples from patients with acute wheezing, suggesting that the virus may be associated with systemic infection [25] .

In this 1-year pro- spective study, HBoV was found in NPAs from 79 children, 71 of whom had acute respiratory tract illness. Similar to previous studies, most of our patients with HBoV infection were infants or young children. Although on occasion adults have been reported to be infected with HBoV [22, 30] , none of the NPAs from adults in the present study was positive for HBoV. Among patients with acute respiratory tract illness, URTI and LRTI were equally common. Although asthma exacerbations, febrile convulsions, and gastroenteritis were common associated clinical manifestations, other apparently unrelated diagnoses were also frequent. Among those patients without respiratory symptoms but with HBoV detected in NPAs, gastroenteritis was the most common diagnosis, in agreement with the detection of HBoV in fecal samples from children with gastroenteritis.
