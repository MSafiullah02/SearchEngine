The type of likely pathogens should be considered while choosing the type of disinfection. Nearly all the chemical disinfectants are toxic or harmful to the eyes, skin, and lungs. Sterilisation is recommended for critical items that are directly introduced into the blood stream or into the normally sterile areas of the body. Semicritical items come in contact with mucous membranes, do not ordinarily penetrate body surfaces, and require high level chemical disinfection. Non-critical items that do not come in contact with the patients or touch their intact skin only, require general housekeeping measures like washing with detergents and water. The basic principle of universal biosafety precautions is that blood and body fluids from all patients ought to be considered as potentially infected, irrespective of their serological status. These precautions should be followed during patient care and handling of dead bodies in health care settings.",

            "text": "1. Sterilisation (Latin: sterilis = barren): This is a \"process by which, an article, surface, or medium is freed of all living entities (including vegetative microorganisms and spores)\". An article may be regarded as sterile if it can be demonstrated that the probability of viable microorganisms on it is less than one in a million as per pharmacopoeia definition (Simpson & Slack, 2006 ). 2. Antisepsis (Greek: anti = against; s\u00e8psis = putrefaction): This is a \"process by which, living tissues are freed of pathogens\". This is usually done by destruction of pathogens or by growth inhibition. 3. Disinfection (Latin: dis = reversal of): It is defined as a \"process by which, inanimate objects, or surfaces are freed of all pathogens\". Usually, disinfection does not affect spores. A disinfectant in higher dilution can act as an antiseptic. But, the reverse is not always true. Prophylactic disinfection is defined as \"measures applied before the onset of disease\" and includes chlorination of drinking water, pasteurisation of milk, and washing of hands before clinical procedures. Concurrent disinfection refers to \"measures applied during illness, to prevent further spread of the disease\" and includes disinfection of patient's excretions, secretions, linen, and materials used in treating the patient. Terminal disinfection is defined as \"measures applied after the patient has ceased to be a source of infection after cure, discharge, or death\". This technique is obsolete. Terminal disinfection is now replaced by terminal cleaning of rooms, including ventilation. Rarely, bedding is fumigated (Ananthanarayan & Paniker, 2000; Collins & Grange, 1990; Sathe & Sathe, 1991) . 4. Incineration (Latin: cineris = ashes): Incineration is \"total combustion of all living and organic matter, by dry heat at not less than 800\u00b0C\" 5. Decontamination (Latin: dis-or de-= reversal of; contamun\u00e4tum = pollutant): This is a general term that indicates procedures put into practice to make equipment safe to handle. The word \"contamination\" may refer to chemical, microbiological or radioactive contamination (Simpson & Slack, 2006) . 6. Sanitation (Latin: sanitas = health): This refers to reduction in the number of pathogens (Ananthanarayan & Paniker, 2000) . Sanitation includes cleaning, wet mopping, dust control, environmental hygiene, and safe disposal of waste.",

The D value remains constant over the full range of the survivor curve. This means that the time and dose required to reduce the population of organisms from 10 6 to 10 5 is the same as that required to reduce the population of organisms from 10 5 to 10 4 (Simpson & Slack, 2006) .

            "text": "1. Species or Strain of Microorganism: In general, vegetative organisms are more vulnerable, while spores are resistant to action of sterilising and disinfecting agents. There is an interspecies variation in the D value at 60\u00b0C -Escherichia coli (few minutes) to Salmonella enterica subtype Senftenberg (one hour); D value at 70\u00b0C -Staph aureus (less than 1 minute) and Staph epidermidis (3 minutes) . Prions (organisms that cause scrapie, bovine spongiform encephalopathy, and Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease) are killed at 134\u00b0C for 18 minutes. Hence it is desirable to use gamma-sterilised disposable instruments for operating on nervous tissue including retina because risk of exposure to prions is high (Simpson & Slack, 2006 ). 2. Growth Conditions: Organisms that grow under nutrient-rich conditions are more resistant to sterilising and disinfecting agents. Resistance usually increases through the late logarithmic phase of microbial growth and declines erratically during the stationary phase. 3. Spore Formation: Bacterial spores are more resistant, as compared to fungal spores. In general, disinfection processes have little or no action against bacterial spores. 4. Micro-Environment: The presence of organic matter (blood, body fluids, pus, faeces, urine) reduces the effectiveness of chlorine-releasing agents (Simpson & Slack, 2006) . Presence of salt reduces effectiveness of ethylene oxide (Simpson & Slack, 2006) . Chemical disinfectants will inactivate at least 10 5 viruses within few minutes. With the exception of phenols, many chemical disinfectants are inactivated in the presence of organic matter. Hence thorough cleaning is necessary before disinfection (Simpson & Slack, 2006) . 5. Bioburden: Higher the initial bioburden (number of microorganisms) the lethal process must be more stringent and extensive to achieve high quality of sterility. 6. Time Factor: All microorganisms do not get killed instantly when exposed to physical agents or to chemical disinfectants because in any population of microorganisms, some will be more resistant than others (Collins & Grange, 1990) . Higher the bioburden, longer will be the time taken to destroy all of them (Simpson & Slack, 2006) .",

Drying can be achieved by exposing the object or article to strong sunlight, or by keeping the object/article in desiccators (Ananthanarayan & Paniker, 2000) . Vacuum drying is used to preserve the potency of vaccines and the nutritive value of foods. Adequate ventilation acts by drying and diluting the number of suspended organisms in the air. Delicate organisms such as meningococci are vulnerable to drying by air (Sathe & Sathe, 1991) . Dehydration is unreliable because many viruses and spores are not destroyed. Drying reduces the infectivity of the HIV. Hence, dried serum and blood are not highly infectious. Like other enveloped viruses, HIV must remain in moist state (or in solution) in order to be infectious. It is also susceptible to inactivation by physical and chemical agents in the moist state (Cunningham, 1997) .",

The waste may be merely scorched and the infected waste may escape with the smoke and pollute the atmosphere. The basic requirements in design of incinerators for hospital waste include: (a) easy attainability of high temperatures (at least 800\u00b0C) with the \"load\", and (b) presence of an \"afterburner\", i.e. a chamber, where smoke and other gaseous effluents are heated to similar or even higher temperatures (Collins & Grange, 1990) . It is essential to train incinerator operators on what type of materials can (or cannot) be burned and how to mix loads in order to ensure adequate combustion, with the minimum of toxic effluent. Even an intrinsically efficient incinerator may fail if it is improperly used (Collins & Grange, 1990) . During the process of incineration, the pathogens are destroyed along with the contaminated article/object. This method is recommended for disposal of low-value non-reusable articles like soiled dressings, swabs, dry waste, etc., and for incinerating animal carcasses and biomedical waste (Collins & Grange, 1990; Sathe & Sathe, 1991) .",

This type of steam behaves in a manner similar to hot air and is less penetrative. Mixture of steam at low temperature and formaldehyde gas combines the thermal effect of steam generated at subatmospheric pressure and chemical effect of formaldehyde gas to give effective sporicidal action. This method is useful for reprocessing heatsensitive instruments. However, safety requirements make the process unsuitable for routine hospital use (Simpson & Slack, 2006) .",

The lid, made of gunmetal, can be sealed with \"butterfly screws\". The autoclave has an outlet for steam, a safety valve, and a pressure gauge. In modern autoclaves, the process, temperature, and time are controlled automatically. Articles to be sterilised are kept on a perforated stage inside the autoclave cylinder. The water level is to be checked every time the autoclave is used and should be below this perforated stage. Gas burner or electricity may be used for heating. Autoclaving is a reliable method of sterilisation, which destroys all living entities (pathogenic as well as non-pathogenic microorganisms). Vegetative organisms are killed instantly and most spores within 2 minutes. Trained personnel are required for handling and maintenance. Articles are moist soon after they are removed from the autoclave. Sharp instruments lose their sharpness and hence cannot be autoclaved (Collins & Grange, 1990; Sathe & Sathe, 1991) . The autoclave is used in laboratories for sterilising all biochemical and bacteriological media, except those containing heat labile substances like blood, serum, or eggs (Sathe & Sathe, 1991) . In health care settings, autoclaves are used for sterilising linen, gloves, gowns, and surgical instruments (other than sharps). Needles and syringes may also be autoclaved in certain situations though use of disposable, gamma-sterilised needles and syringes is recommended (Collins & Grange, 1990; Sathe & Sathe, 1991) .",

A pressure of 15 pounds per square inch (PSI) is equivalent to one atmosphere pressure. Metric (SI) units are not used in autoclaving. When water is subjected to a pressure of 15 PSI above the atmospheric pressure, water will boil at a temperature of 121\u00b0C if air is completely expelled from the closed container. If air is not expelled, water will boil at a lower temperature. Pressure, per se, does not ensure effective sterilisation since microorganisms can withstand high pressures. Pressure acts by raising the temperature at which water boils, and increasing penetration of steam. The raised temperature is instrumental in ensuring sterilisation (Collins & Grange, 1990) . Latent Heat of Steam: For converting water into steam at the same temperature, an additional heat of 540 calories per gram has to be supplied. Conversely, when 1 g of steam condenses back to form water at the same temperature, this heat is instantly released without any change in temperature. Hence, this is called \"latent heat\" (latent = hidden). The latent heat is instantly delivered to the article on which the steam condenses resulting in instantaneous death of the microorganisms that may be present (Collins & Grange, 1990) .",

            "text": "Commonly, the pressure gauge is relied upon to check for the completeness of sterilisation. However, it is essential to have a thermometer fitted and to record the actual temperature attained, and the duration for which the temperature was maintained. Equipment with vacuum-assisted air removal cycle are fitted with air detectors. Temperature-sensitive probes (thermocouples) may be inserted into standard test packs (Simpson & Slack, 2006) . The Bowie-Dick test monitors the penetration of steam by a bubble of residual air in the pack (Simpson & Slack, 2006) . In the original test, an adhesive indicator tape is pasted on the surface of the articles or objects to be sterilised, before they are placed in the autoclave chamber. This indicator tape, usually green in colour, changes to black if the article has been exposed to the recommended temperature (Collins & Grange, 1990; Sathe & Sathe, 1991) . The change in colour should be uniform along the entire length of the indicator tape (Simpson & Slack, 2006) . Biological indicators comprise dried spore suspensions of a reference heatresistant thermophilic spore-bearing bacterium such as Bacillus stearothermophilus, Bacillus thuringensis, or Bacillus subtilis. Spores of one of these organisms are kept in a sealed glass ampoule and placed inside the autoclave chamber. After the process of autoclaving, the ampoule is sent to the laboratory where the spores are incubated to check for bacterial growth. Presence of growth indicates that the spores have remained viable. This procedure requires laboratory support, is expensive, and the results of the laboratory tests are not available immediately (Collins & Grange, 1990; Sathe & Sathe, 1991) . These biological indicators are no longer considered for routine testing. Spore indicators are essential in low-temperature gaseous processes like ethylene oxide, in which physical measurements are not reliable (Simpson & Slack, 2006) .",

Materials such as talcum powder cannot be penetrated by steam and should not be autoclaved. Before using the autoclave, water should be maintained at a level recommended by the manufacturer. Steam outlet and safety valve should be checked and cleaned if necessary. All articles should be wrapped in kraft paper or cloth and then placed in individual trays. The barrel and plunger of the syringes should be disassembled and wrapped in cloth or kraft paper. Linen should be wrapped in loose flat bundles since larger bundles would need longer time for sterilisation. The thermo-chemical indicator tape is stuck on the cloth covering each tray. It is important to ensure that all the air is expelled, since a mixture of air and steam will not have the same penetrative effect as saturated steam alone. The steam outlet is closed only after all the air in the cylinder is expelled and excess steam starts coming out from the steam outlet. The temperature, pressure, and the sterilisation time are recorded. The \"holding time\" is counted after the steam outlet is closed. It is safer to rely on the temperature attained and the time period for which this temperature is maintained. To ensure absolute sterility, a temperature of 135\u00b0C is to be attained. The autoclave should cool on its own. Autoclaved articles should be prevented from contamination during drying, transportation, and storage. For sterilising small quantities, a domestic pressure cooker may be used. The \"holding time\" is counted after the first \"whistle\" (expulsion of steam) from the steam outlet of the pressure cooker (Collins & Grange, 1990; Sathe & Sathe, 1991) .",

UV lamps produce effective UV radiation with wavelength of 240-280 nm. The UV rays with shortest wavelength that reach the earth's surface have a wavelength of 290 nm. UV lamps are used for sterilising closed areas, such as operation theatres, wards, neonatal intensive care units, and laboratory safety cabinets (Simpson & Slack, 2006) . Commercially available household water purifiers use UV radiation for sterilising small quantities of water for laboratory or household use.

Disinfectants that are used in health care settings should be monitored regularly (Chitnis, 1997) . A wide range of testing methods has been developed for medical and veterinary use. In Europe, standardisation of test methods include: (a) simple screening tests of rate of kill, (b) laboratory tests simulating in-use conditions (skin antisepsis and inanimate surface disinfection tests), and (c) in-use tests on equipment and samples of disinfectants (in \"in-use dilutions\"). These tests determine survival and multiplication of contaminating pathogens. In-use tests are used for monitoring effectiveness of the disinfectant or antiseptic and monitoring method of use. The Rideal Walker coefficient (RWC), also known as carbolic coefficient or phenol coefficient, compares the bactericidal power of a given disinfectant with that of phenol. A major limitation of this test is that it compares disinfectants, without the presence of organic matter such as pus, faecal matter, blood, or body fluids (Chitnis, 1997) . Chick Martin test compares the disinfecting action of two disinfectants in the presence of organic matter (Chitnis, 1997) . Capacity test of Kelsey and Sykes gives guidelines for the dilution of the disinfectant to be used (Kelsey & Sykes, 1969) . After a particular disinfectant is selected at the desired dilution using the capacity test of Kelsey and Sykes, routine monitoring should be done using the \"in use\" test of Maurer (Maurer, 1969) .",

It is added to fuchsin dye to prepare carbol fuchsin, which is used for staining acid-fast bacilli. Formerly, carbolic acid was used as 0.5 per cent solution in glycerine as mouthwash, ear drops, and topical antipruritic; as analgesic in dentistry; and as 5 per cent solution in almond oil for sclerosing haemorrhoids.",

A 2 per cent solution provides a high level of disinfection, which approximates sterilisation. It is the only disinfectant that can be reused. It is less toxic than formaldehyde and does not damage optical lenses and cementing material of endoscopes. However, glutaraldehyde has a strong odour and is expensive, as compared to formaldehyde. At alkaline pH (more than 8.5), glutaraldehyde gets polymerised, resulting in loss of antimicrobial activity. It is used for disinfecting sharp instruments, surfaces/instruments (which are destroyed by household bleach and sodium hypochlorite), face masks, catheters, endoscopes, endotracheal tubes, and respirators. An aqueous solution of 2 per cent is used topically for treatment of idiopathic hyperhidrosis of the palms and soles.

It is a cheap disinfectant, which kills all vegetative bacteria, most viruses, and fungal spores, while mycobacteria and bacterial spores are killed slowly. It does not damage metals or fabric, but is an irritant to the eyes and respiratory tract. It can damage optical lenses and cementing material used in endoscopes. Formaldehyde tablets (used for disinfection of equipment and nursery incubators) are not reliable and need to be subjected to quality control after use (Chitnis, 1997) . As aqueous solution (formalin), it is used for preserving biological specimens and cadavers, and for destroying anthrax spores in animal hair and woollen products. Woollen products are soaked in a 2 per cent solution of formalin at 40\u00b0C temperature for 2 minutes. Hair and bristles are soaked in a 2 per cent solution at 60\u00b0C temperature for 6 hours.

Transmission of HIV may be direct (contact with blood or body fluids) or through infected instruments. The major risk of transmission is through percutaneous exposure to infected blood or body fluids. Though infective doses of HIV are present in CSF, semen, blood, and cervico-vaginal secretions, HIV is present in different concentrations in almost all body fluids -amniotic, synovial, pleural, peritoneal, pericardial, sweat, faeces, nasal secretions, sputum, tears, urine, and breast milk of infected persons. Though CSF has the highest concentration of HIV, the likelihood of accidental occupational exposure to CSF is extremely low (CDC, 1988) . The risk of transmission of HIV through exchange of fluids (other than sexual fluids and blood) tends to be extremely low or insignificant unless there is visible contamination with blood (Gandakhedkar, 1999) . Lipophilic viruses such as HIV, HBV, and cytomegalovirus are highly sensitive to chemical disinfectants. In comparison, Mycobacteria, Pseudomonas, Staphy-lococci, spore-forming bacteria, fungi (Candida, Cryptococci), and hydrophilic viruses (polio virus, rhino virus) are not very susceptible to chemical disinfectants (Gangakhedkar, 1999) .",
