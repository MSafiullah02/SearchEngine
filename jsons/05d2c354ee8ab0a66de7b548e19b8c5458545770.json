            "text": "The most efficacious method to avoid infection with pathogenic viruses is immunization of individuals with prophylactic vaccines. However, for most viruses such vaccines are not available. Antiviral drugs that block replicating virus in infected individuals are therefore of great importance in the battle against virus infections. Ideally, these drugs should induce strong and specific inhibition of virus replication without affecting cellular processes. This type of drugs remained fiction until Zamecnik and Stephenson reported the sequence-specific inhibition of Rous sarcoma virus replication by antisense DNA oligonucleotides in 1978 (Zamecnik and Stephenson 1978) . This paper and subsequent reports on the sequence-specific knock-down of genes by antisense technology made a big impression on the scientific community that is comparable to the current RNAi boom. However, the development of antisense-based therapeutics stuttered and almost came to a stop because of problems with toxicity of the oligonucleotides, their instability in serum, and the problem of delivery to the right target cells. A new generation of nucleic acid-based antiviral compounds were subsequently developed, such as ribozymes, DNAzymes, and decoy RNAs, but they faced similar problems. Some of the problems could be solved using chemically modified nucleic acids instead of normal DNA/RNA oligonucleotides. For example, modifications such as phosphorothioate (PS) DNA or 2 -O-methyl-RNA (OMe) increased the affinity of the oligonucleotides for their target sequence and increased serum stability (see Fig. 1 ). New hope for nucleic acid-based therapeutics came in 2001 when Elbashir and coworkers showed that synthetic small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) induced sequence-specific knock-down of genes in mammalian cells without triggering the interferon response (Elbashir et al. 2001) . RNAi was immediately recognized as a potentially powerful new tool to combat a variety of viruses. Indeed, profound inhibition has been reported for many important human pathogenic viruses, and several potential antiviral siRNA compounds are currently being tested in clinical trials . Despite these promising data, it is becoming increasingly clear that some of the problems that were earlier encountered by antisense drugs also apply to RNAi-based therapeutics. Although RNAi-mediated silencing is highly sequence-specific, therapeutic siRNAs can cause unwanted silencing of cellular mRNAs Fedorov et al. 2006; Jackson et al. 2003; Kleinman et al. 2008 ). In addition, synthetic siRNAs are also subject to degradation in vivo by nuclease activity. Besides side effects and instability, the efficient and specific delivery of the RNAi inducers to the target cell still requires optimization.",

The PS modification, in which the oxygen atom in the DNA backbone is replaced by a sulfur atom, has been widely used. The advantage of the PS-modified oligonucleotides is that it allows RNase H cleavage of the target sequence. A disadvantage is that the PS modification introduces a negative charge that causes nonspecific interactions with other molecules, for example, cellular proteins. As a result, PS-modified oligonucleotides are notorious for inducing severe side effects that are toxic for cells. A well-known example of an antiviral PS-modified oligonucleotide is Vitravene for treatment of cytomegalovirus (CMV)-induced retinitis in AIDS patients. This is a 21-nucleotide that inhibits the expression of viral proteins from the major immediate-early transcriptional unit (Vitravene study group, 2002) . Until now, Vitravene is the only antisense-based drug that has received FDA approval and is used in the clinic. Although Vitravene provides a marked reduction of disease severity, the compound is currently not widely used mainly because AIDS patients on antiretroviral therapy rarely develop CMV-induced retinitis.",

For example, OMe and 2 -O-methoxy-ethyl (MOE) modifications ( Fig. 1) increase the stability of the oligonucleotide and the affinity for the target mRNA when compared to PS-modified oligonucleotides. In contrast to the PS modification, the OMe and MOE-modified oligonucleotides do not allow cleavage by RNase H, but they rather block translation via steric hindrance of the ribosome during translation. For optimal activity, the oligonucleotide has to be targeted to sequences that are at or near the translation initiation site. The OMe modification has also been used in combination with PS modifications in the so-called gap-mers, in which the central nucleotides carry the PS modification and the flanking nucleotides the OMe modification (Monia et al. 1993) . This approach combines the benefits of both the first and second generation modifications. An example of a second generation-modified antiviral oligonucleotide is GEM-92, which was developed by Hybridon (currently discontinued). GEM-92 is a gap-mer, with OMe modified flanks and PS modified central sequences (Turner et al. 2006) .",

These modifications provide further improved nuclease resistance and target affinity. In addition, the PNA and MF modifications allow enhanced cellular uptake. To combine all benefits, third generation modifications can be used in combination with unmodified residues in chimaeric gap-mers. LNA modifications are widely used in various applications. It introduces a 2 -O, 4 C-methylene bridge that locks the ribose in a C3 -endo conformation. This \"locked\" conformation results in a strong increase in the affinity for the target mRNA (Petersen and Wengel 2003) . LNA modifications were reported to cause less toxic side effects when compared to the first and second generation modifications (Wahlestedt et al. 2000) . However, LNA-modified oligonucleotides were recently shown to induce profound toxicity in hepatocytes in mice (Swayze et al. 2007) .",

The advantage of using extended antisense sequences is that multiple viral sites are targeted simultaneously (Levine et al. 2006) .

In most cases, these reactions are self-processing events that take place in a sequence-specific manner. It was found, however, that ribozymes can be designed to specifically cleave other RNA molecules in trans by modification of the substrate recognition domains. Because of their sequence specificity and multiple turnover or catalytic properties, such ribozymes have been extensively studied as potential therapeutics (Peracchi 2004) . Of the nine classes of ribozymes, the hammerhead and hairpin ribozymes have received a great deal of attention. These ribozymes are relatively small (50-100 nucleotides) and can direct cleavage of single-stranded target RNA. Many ribozymes that are used in therapeutic applications have been improved by in vitro selection procedures, in which the most active molecules were selected from partially randomized sequences. In vitro selection has also generated DNAzymes that structurally and functionally resemble ribozymes, but that have a DNA instead of RNA backbone (Santoro and Joyce 1997) . These DNAzymes can have a catalytic activity similar to that of ribozymes, but they are more stable in vivo.",

            "text": "Therapeutic ribozymes have been used both as synthetic RNA that is transfected into cells and as intracellularly expressed RNA. Because unmodified ribozymes are rapidly degraded in serum, synthetic ribozymes require chemical modification to extend the half life and to improve the therapeutic potential of ribozymes (Gonzalez- Carmona et al. 2006; Jakobsen et al. 2007 ). Antiviral ribozymes have been extensively tested in gene therapy settings ). In these studies, the ribozyme is placed under control of a suitable promoter and inserted in a vector to transduce the target cells. Anti-HIV-1 ribozymes have been studied in several clinical trials. Macpherson et al. have tested an anti-tat ribozyme in a phase I clinical trial (Macpherson et al. 2005) . In preclinical studies, this ribozyme was shown to decrease HIV-1 replication and virus-induced pathogenicity in T cell lines and peripheral blood T-lymphocytes. In the clinical trial, CD4 + T-lymphocytes were transduced ex vivo using a retroviral vector for expression of the ribozyme. The transduced cells were given back to the HIV-positive patients. This gene therapy was found to be safe and was shown to inhibit HIV-1 replication. Li and coworkers have used a ribozyme in combination with an siRNA and a decoy RNA to inhibit HIV-1 replication (Li et al. , 2005b . The ribozyme is targeted towards the mRNA for the cellular CCR5 protein, which functions as essential coreceptor for HIV-1 entry. The decoy is the viral TAR RNA hairpin structure, which is supposed to bind the viral Tat protein and cellular cofactors that are needed for viral gene expression. CD34 + hematopoietic progenitor cells were also transduced with a retroviral vector for the expression of the ribozyme. These cells differentiated normally into mature macrophages and showed significant resistance to viral infection. When the ribozyme was used in combination with the Tat/Rev siRNA and the TAR decoy, the transduced cells showed long-term viral resistance in vitro and the transduced hematopoietic stem cells developed normally into T cells in SCID-hu mice. These cells were able to resist HIV-1 infection ex vivo (Anderson et al. 2007 ).",

The interaction of the decoy with the target protein prevents it from being active and hence blocks virus replication (James 2007) . The HIV-1 TAR decoy described earlier is a well-known example. Another decoy RNA to inhibit HIV-1 corresponds to the Rev responsive element (RRE). Interaction of the RRE with the viral Rev protein is required for the transport of single and unspliced viral RNAs from the nucleus to the cytoplasm. Overexpression of an RRE decoy sequesters the Rev protein, thereby blocking nuclear export of viral RNAs and thus virus replication (Bahner et al. 1996) . This RRE decoy has earlier been tested in a phase I clinical trial in which CD34 + stem cells were transduced ex vivo with a retroviral vector for the expression of the RNA inhibitor (Kohn et al. 1999 ). There was no evidence that expression of the decoy affected cell function, but there were also no detectable changes in the subject's plasma HIV-1 level.",

These aptamers were identified in large randomized pools of sequences by repetitive rounds of selection for binding with the highest affinity to the target protein (James 2007) . The early targets for aptamer development were viral polymerases. For example, potent aptamers were selected that inhibit HIV-1 reverse transcriptase (RT) and HCV RNA polymerase (Bellecave et al. 2003; Burke et al. 1996; Tuerk et al. 1992 ). These aptamers are not similar to any viral sequences, indicating that the high affinity binding aptamers do not necessarily have to be analogues of natural substrates. It has been shown that HIV-1-specific RT aptamers can potently inhibit RT enzymes from multiple HIV-1 subtypes, suggesting that these aptamers can provide broad protection (Held et al. 2007 ). However, naturally resistant virus strains exist against some aptamers, which means that these antiviral should be used in combination with other HIV-1 inhibitors.",

            "text": "RNAi has only recently been added to the list of nucleic acid-based therapeutics. In eukaryotic cells, RNAi plays an important role in the regulation of gene expression via microRNAs (miRNA). These are small noncoding RNAs that are expressed as primary miRNAs (pri-miRNAs) and processed by the cellular proteins Drosha and Dicer into mature miRNA of 21-25 nucleotides (Fig. 2) . In mammals, miRNAs typically direct translational inhibition of cellular mRNAs bearing complementary sequences in the 3 UTR (Grimson et al. 2007 ). RNAi has also been proposed to play a role in the cellular defense against viruses and silencing of transposable elements by generation of virus-specific siRNAs (Bennasser et al. 2005; Soifer et al. 2005; Triboulet et al. 2007; Yang and Kazazian 2006 shRNA-mirs Dicer pri-miRNA Fig. 2 RNAi inducers used in antiviral strategies. In general, RNAi is induced either by transfection of synthetic siRNAs into cells, or by stable or transient intracellular expression of doublestranded siRNA precursors (shRNA, e-shRNA, lhRNA, or pri-miRNAs). After transcription in the nucleus shRNAs, lhRNAs and e-shRNAs are exported to the cytoplasm and subsequently diced into mature siRNAs. Pri-miRNAs modified to encode antiviral siRNAs first undergo cleavage by Drosha before they are exported to the cytoplasm. Here the antiviral pre-miRNAs (also called shRNA-miRs) are processed by Dicer into the mature miRNAs. After loading of the antisense strand of the siRNAs/miRNAs into RISC, the complex will target and cleave viral transcripts bearing the complementary sequences mechanisms involving small RNAs (Tam et al. 2008; Watanabe et al. 2008) . Both miRNAs and siRNAs are loaded into the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC) and target RNAs for, respectively, translational repression or destruction (Fig. 2) . Although the antiviral function of RNAi is well established in plants, insects, and nematodes, it is still debated whether RNAi has a similar role in mammals, but the circumstantial evidence is growing in support of this idea (Andersson et al. 2005; Bennasser et al. 2005; Cullen 2006; Grimson et al. 2007; Soifer et al. 2005; Tam et al. 2008; Voinnet 2005; Watanabe et al. 2006b Watanabe et al. , 2008 Yang and Kazazian 2006) .",

It also allowed the development of RNAi-based therapeutics for prevention of virus transmission or treatment of virus replication. An overview of therapeutic strategies used to induce antiviral RNAi responses is shown in Fig. 2 . Synthetic siRNA duplexes used to induce RNAi are generally 21 nucleotides long with 2-nucleotide 3 overhangs and are modeled after the natural Dicer cleavage products. Once the antisense strand (guide) of the antiviral siRNA is loaded into RISC, the complex will target the viral RNAs in a sequence-specific manner. Alternatively, transient transfection of plasmids that express antiviral shRNAs is also used to induce RNAi. These shRNAs are typically 19-29 base pairs long, with a small apical loop and a 3 -terminal UU overhang. The shRNAs are usually expressed in the nucleus under control of a polymerase III promoter (U6 or H1) and are translocated to the cytoplasm by Exportin-5. The shRNAs are processed in the cytoplasm by Dicer into functional siRNAs.",

The siRNA half life must be increased to be effective as antiviral therapeutic. This would allow treatment with infrequent administration of small amounts of siRNAs, which also increases the prophylactic potential of siRNAs. In case of influenza virus, individuals at risk could be treated with such stabilized antiviral siRNAs during the seasonal epidemic and thus avoid infection. Chemical modifications that were earlier used for antisense compounds have been successfully used to increase the half life of siRNAs in vivo while retaining their activity (Morrissey et al. 2005a, b; Rana 2007) . For example, introducing a PS-linkage at the 3 end renders siRNA resistant to 3 exonuclease activity, whereas OMe modification gives resistance to endonucleases. However, some of the modifications that increase the stability have a negative effect on the siRNA activity (Czauderna et al. 2003) . Modification of the 5 end resulted in loss of siRNA activity, emphasizing its importance. Modifications in the antisense (passenger) strand can stabilize the siRNA, without a negative effect on the activity of the sense (guide) strand. LNA modification dramatically increases the potency of siRNA in vitro and in vivo without toxicity (Elmen et al. 2005) .",

Lenti-, retro-, and adeno-associated virus (AAV) vectors can be used to stably transduce cells with constructs that express an antiviral shRNA, resulting in cellular resistance to the virus. Transduction of CD34 + hematopoietic stem cells with anti-HIV-1 RNAi constructs ex vivo and grafting these cells back into the patient will result in a resistant cell population that might reconstitute the patients' immune system (Berkhout 2005 ; see also Chapter 11).",

            "text": "Prolonged in vitro culturing of resistant cells with HIV-1 resulted in the emergence of viral escape variants that are no longer targeted by the siRNAs. These RNAi escape variants contain point mutations or deletions within the siRNA target sequences (Das et al. 2004 ). In addition, an escape virus was described with a mutation outside the target sequence. This mutation triggered escape by inducing a conformational change in the local RNA secondary structure that rendered the target sequence inaccessible for RISC (Westerhout et al. 2005) . Escape from RNAi has also been reported for poliovirus, hepatitis A virus, HBV, and HCV (Boden et al. 2003; Das et al. 2004; Gitlin et al. 2005; Kusov et al. 2006; Ter Brake and Berkhout 2005; von Eije et al. 2008; Westerhout et al. 2005; Wilson and Richardson 2005; Wu et al. 2005b ). These combined results show that a single siRNA therapy is not sufficient to obtain long-term inhibition of virus replication. Escape from RNAi is reminiscent of the evolution of drug resistant HIV-1 variants in patients on antiretroviral therapy. Only the combined use of multiple HIV-1 drugs (highly active antiretroviral therapy or HAART) can permanently block virus replication without the emergence of resistant variants. Similarly, the combined expression of multiple siRNAs would be required to persistently block virus replication. This combinatorial approach should ideally target viral sequences that are essential and well conserved among different virus strains. The emergence of HIV-1 escape variants was delayed in cells expressing two siRNAs when compared to cells expressing a single siRNA . In cells expressing four potent siRNAs, no viral escape was observed .",

For HIV-1, a well known example is the CCR5 coreceptor for HIV-1. This coreceptor is important for virus entry, yet mutation of the CCR5 gene does not affect the fitness of the host (Liu et al. 1996; Samson et al. 1996) . Recently, Brass et al.

Hepatitis an infection of the liver that is caused by a variety of RNA viruses (hepatitis A virus, hepatitis B virus, hepatitis C virus). RNAi has been used to inhibit HBV replication both in vitro and in vivo Ely et al. 2008; Hamasaki et al. 2003; Klein et al. 2003; Konishi et al. 2003; Weinberg et al. 2007; Ying et al. 2003) . HBV is a member of the Hepadnaviridae and its genome is a 3.2-kb double-stranded circular DNA. Synthetic siRNAs and shRNA expression constructs showed potent inhibition of HBV replication in mice (Chen et al. 2005 (Chen et al. , 2007 Giladi et al. 2003; McCaffrey et al. 2003; Morrissey et al. 2005b; Shin et al. 2006; Wu et al. 2005b; Xuan et al. 2006; Ying et al. 2007 ). The RNAi-based therapy needs to be provided for a long period because HBV causes a chronic infection of the liver. Transduction of the hepatocytes in vivo with a vector expressing anti-HBV shRNAs could provide such long-term protection. Chen et al. have indeed demonstrated long-term inhibition of HBV in mice transduced with an AAV vector to deliver the shRNA inhibitor. HBV DNA, mRNA, and protein levels were reduced in the liver of the transgenic mice, whereas the amount of circulating virus dropped by 2-3 logs. Virus inhibition was still apparent 120 days after vector administration (Chen et al. 2007 ). In addition, lhRNAs and shRNA-mirs could efficiently inhibit HBV replication in vitro and in mice (Ely et al. 2008; Weinberg et al. 2007 ).",

In fact, RSV was the first virus for which RNAimediated inhibition was demonstrated (Bitko and Barik 2001) and synthetic siRNAs are currently entering phase II clinical trials. RSV belongs to the paramyxoviridae and is an enveloped, nonsegmented, negative-strand RNA virus. RSV is a major cause of respiratory illness in both the upper and lower respiratory tract, typically leading to common cold-like symptoms that in some cases -especially in young children -lead to more serious illness such as bronchiolitis and pneumonia. In mice, replication of RSV and also human parainfluenza virus could be blocked by synthetic siRNAs (Bitko et al. 2005) . Synthetic siRNAs and intranasal administration of plasmids expressing shRNAs resulted in a significant decrease of the RSV load (Zhang et al. 2005) . Similar to siRNA-induced inhibition of influenza virus, the siRNAs against RSV were effective both before and after infection with RSV. Alnylam has presented the results of a phase I clinical trial with its leading siRNA drug candidate ALN-RSV01 (http://www.alnylam.com/). The drug was found to be safe and well tolerated when administered intranasally in two phase I clinical studies (DeVincenzo et al. 2008) . Phase II clinical trials in naturally infected RSV patients were initiated in April 2008. ALN-RSV01 is expected to advance into the pediatric patient population by the second half of 2008.",

Both siRNAs and plasmid-derived shRNAs were effective in blocking virus replication in cell culture infections (He et al. 2003; Lu et al. 2004; Ni et al. 2005; Pyrc et al. 2006; Wang et al. 2004; Wu et al. 2005a; Zhang et al. 2004) . Potent siRNA inhibitors against the SARS-coronavirus spike and pol mRNAs were also tested for efficacy and safety in a rhesus macaque SARS model. The siRNAs were administered intranasally as prophylactic, concurrent with viral challenge, or early post-exposure (Li et al. 2005a ). Similar to the mice studies with anti-influenza siRNAs and anti-RSV siRNAs, both prophylactic and therapeutic effects were observed. siRNA treatment caused a significant reduction in viral RNA levels, SARS-like symptoms, and lung histopathology. These combined findings suggest that low dosages of inhaled or intravenously administered siRNAs or shRNA plasmids may provide an easy and efficient basis for prophylaxis against respiratory viruses in certain situations -for example, a pandemic influenza threat -or antiviral therapy of already infected individuals.",

            "text": "RNAi is a highly specific tool for inducing gene knock-down. However, studies show that high expression of siRNA/shRNAs can induce interferon responses and other unwanted side effects (Bridge et al. 2003; Jackson and Linsley 2004) . Cellular transcripts containing partial complementarity with an siRNA can also be targeted for RNAi-mediated knock-down Fedorov et al. 2006; Jackson et al. 2003) . These off-target effects are of great concern in the development of safe RNAi-based antivirals, because they will have an impact on cell viability Jackson and Linsley 2004) . High concentrations of siRNA/shRNAs may also interfere with cellular miRNA processing and function. This problem is caused by the fact that shRNA processing uses the cellular pathway for miRNA processing. In particular, Exportin-5, which is required for nuclear export and stability of miRNAs, was found to be a limiting factor in the RNAi pathway that could be saturated by exogenous shRNAs. In extreme cases, such side effects can have severe consequences, as illustrated by the mice that died after treatment with an AAV vector for overexpression of shRNAs in the liver (Grimm et al. 2006 ). This study also showed that there is an shRNA-threshold for toxicity. Because of our limited knowledge on cellular miRNA function, we should not underestimate the impact of shRNAs on these processes. Moderate expression of highly active shRNAs is essential for the development of safe RNAi therapeutics, and candidate shRNA/siRNA inhibitors should be screened for off-target effects. Inducible promoters are useful to regulate shRNA expression to avoid off-target effects. To avoid toxic off-target effects of antiviral RNAi therapeutics, viruses should ideally be targeted transiently, locally, and with a low dosage. This could be realized for acute respiratory viral infections, but treatment of chronic viral infections may require a durable gene therapy approach. An elegant strategy to reduce potential off-target effects of the siRNA passenger strand is the use of so-called small internally segmented interfering RNAs (sisiRNA) (Bramsen et al. 2007 ). These sisiRNAs are composed of an intact antisense strand complemented with two shorter 10-12 nt sense strands. Because of its segmented nature the passenger strand is inactive, whereas the antisense strand can still efficiently induce a potent RNAi response.",
