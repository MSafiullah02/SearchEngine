            "text": "In Japan, the issue of brain-death and organ transplantation was highly influential to the development of bioethics (see Chap. 10.1007/978-981-15-3572-7_2). Beginning in the 1980s, nationwide debates began as to whether brain-death constituted human death, and whether organ transplantation from a brain-dead body should be permissible. These issues were discussed in medical circles, religious groups, political groups, the media, and among the general population. With the establishment of a commission on brain-death, and the 1997 enactment of the Organ Transplantation Law, organ transplantation from a brain-dead body was finally deemed permissible, with strict conditions. Specifically, the clear and written expression of the intent to donate from the organ donor (15 years or older) as well as the family\u2019s consent were both required. Politically, this marked a major milestone. Several positive outcomes were achieved, including discussion on the definition of death and Japanese views on life and death; this set a healthy tone for how bioethical arguments should be handled in Japan from that point forward.",

            "text": "At about the same time, the idea of informed consent began to emerge as an issue in clinical settings (see Chap. 10.1007/978-981-15-3572-7_3). Informed consent in the clinical context entails an act in which \u201cmedical caregivers provide sufficient explanation to those with sound judgment capacity and ensure that the patient understands, while the patient then offers consent of their own volition.\u201d Today this is considered common protocol, but such was not always the case in Japan. There was even extensive debate on how to translate the English term \u201cinformed consent\u201d into Japanese; today, the term \u201cinfo-mudo konsento\u201d is used, but is presented in katakana, the phonetic alphabet used for foreign terms and names. In the course of this discussion, those arguing to protect patient autonomy, basing their arguments on self-determination and the right to know, were in a dominant position. Others countered that argument, stating that prioritizing individual autonomy so heavily is unsuited for Japan. However, an explanation of the patient\u2019s condition has now been systematically added to the treatment plan at the time of hospital admission and discharge, such that it is covered by health insurance [4]. Informed consent is therefore a common theme that has been integrated into medical care. This flow of events necessitated a change in paternalism among physicians. It also led to the medical record disclosure system based on the Private Information Protection Law in 2003.",

            "text": "One other major event during Phase I was the 1991 Tokai University Euthanasia Incident. In this case, a physician, in response to a clear request from the patient\u2019s family, administered potassium chloride (KCl) to a terminal cancer patient [5]. He was found guilty of murder and given a suspended sentence by the Yokohama District Court in 1995. The trial was an unprecedented case in which a doctor performed euthanasia. As the court decision presented the conditions that would allow for active euthanasia in the obiter dictum, it was erroneously relayed to other countries that active euthanasia was legally permissible in Japan. Reports of physician-assisted suicide emerged from abroad, and terms such as euthanasia, mercy killing, and dying with dignity were used without clarity. Currently in Japan, the act of a medical caregiver administering muscle relaxants or KCl to a patient, leading to the latter\u2019s death, carries with it a high probability that the medical caregiver will be placed on trial for murder. Notably, unlike several other countries, Japan has not legalized active voluntary euthanasia. In addition, with the increased popularity of hospice or palliative care, fewer cases of \u201cwithholding treatment\u201d requested ahead of time by patients are legally problematic. However, the issue of \u201ctreatment withdrawal\u201d (removal of an artificial respirator) from a terminal patient has yet to be subject to legal resolution (see Chap. 10.1007/978-981-15-3572-7_4).",

            "text": "In the second phase, topics in medical ethics shifted to issues pertaining to the beginning of life. Among them, the heightened discussion surrounding the moral status of the human embryo became particularly significant. At this time, research on embryonic stem cells (hereafter, ESCs) had become widespread. Human ESCs have the capacity to differentiate into all kind of tissues and all cell types, and there was great hope for these cells in the field of regenerative medicine. However, in order to create human ESCs, one must destroy a fertilized egg (embryo) that has the capacity to become a human individual in the future. If one perceives that human life is present in an embryo, then this type of use of embryos cannot be approved. In 2004, the Council for Science and Technology Policy and the Experts Panel on Bioethics compiled the document \u201cBasic Principles Concerning the Handling of Human Embryos.\u201d This document stated that the human embryo is not a person per se, but it is also not an object. The document instead uses the phrase, \u201csprout of human life.\u201d The writers conclude that a human embryo is worthy of respect and requires careful handling (see Chap. 10.1007/978-981-15-3572-7_5). Fundamentally, \u201cThe Guidelines for Derivation and Utilization of Human Embryonic Stem Cells\u201d and \u201cThe Act on Regulation of Human Cloning Techniques\u201d take the same stance as \u201cThe Basic Principles Concerning the Handling of Human Embryos.\u201d Given that the moral status of the human embryo is a topic of deep religious and political debate in other countries, it seems that Japan has actually handled this issue with relative ease. However, it remains a mystery as to why abortion\u2014another debate that should be begging many questions about the moral status of an individual prior to birth\u2014did not gain as much momentum as that surrounding the human embryo.",

Many of these were drafted by governmental review boards or committees. These drafting sessions came to include medical and legal specialists as well as ethicists, and representatives from the general public such as journalists. By this time, a new framework had been put in place for policy-making in the fields of life sciences and medical care. This was a linear process that began with forming a public committee comprising specialists from many disciplines, drafting the guidelines, implementing the public comment system, and publishing the final results on the internet, followed by media reporting and revisions over several years. This framework reflected the nature and process of the debate surrounding organ transplantation from brain-dead donors.",

However, in 2000, the first graduate level Department of Biomedical Ethics was established at the Kyoto University Graduate School of Medicine, and several full-time faculty members were hired. In 2003, the University of Tokyo Graduate School of Medicine also created a Department of Biomedical Ethics.

This field has come to be known as \u201cneuroethics.\u201d Safire defines neuroethics as \u201cthe examination of what is right and wrong, good and bad about the treatment of, perfection of, or unwelcome invasion of and worrisome manipulation of the human brain\u201d [7]. Two major developments in neuroscience aided in creating momentum for neuroethics. First, the development of brain functional imaging technology such as PET and fMRI made it possible to observe the brain functions of a living human being. This new technology presents the possibility of obtaining an even more diverse array of information, such as lie detection and clarifying an individual\u2019s level of consciousness. However, it also opens up possibilities for mind-reading, or the ability to read the condition of another person\u2019s spirit. The second major technological development involves selective pharmacological and anatomical intervention/manipulation of neurological processes. For example, it is now possible to control tremors caused by Parkinson\u2019s disease with Deep Brain Stimulation. This technology could potentially be applied to patients with other diseases. Moreover, it could also be used for brain enhancement in healthy people. Brainwashing and mind control for military purposes have also come into the debate.",

This technology did not require the destruction of a human embryo, and thus generated much hope for cell transplantation medicine that does not involve ethical issues or rejection responses. It was a breakthrough in the field of life sciences as well as the ethical arena. Currently, iPS cell research has moved from the basic research stage to drug development and even clinical applications such as cell transplantation. The Japanese government is actively promoting iPS cell research. However, were the ethical problems truly and completely eliminated by iPS cell technology?

As such, returning a cloned embryo to the uterus was prohibited by the Act on Regulation of Human Cloning Techniques.

Another challenge is that of stem cell research, for which various uses can be imagined (for example, controlling the direction of differentiation, genetic recombination, and fusion with cells from other species).

However, my intent is not to criticize the government, but rather to bring the issues to light and describe them in their rawness through the lens of Japanese culture. If I do not do this, my concern is that international trust and confidence in Japan\u2019s research and medical care will deteriorate over time, and the value quality of Japan as a nation will decrease. This is not a lack of patriotism. As noted in the Introduction, the present book was written to achieve a global scale of bioethical dialogue; to this end, I cannot shy away from criticism of my own country\u2019s policies or cultures in this process when this is necessary.",
