            "text": "COVID-19, caused by the novel SARS-CoV-2 virus, started in China in late 2019, and soon became a global pandemic. With the help of thousands of viral genome sequences that have been accumulating, it has become possible to track the evolution of viral genome over time as it spread across the world. An important question that still needs to be answered is whether any of the common mutations affect the viral properties, and therefore the disease characteristics. Therefore, we sought to understand the effects of mutations in RNAdependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), particularly the common 14408C>T mutation, on mutation rate and viral spread. By focusing on mutations in the slowly evolving M or E genes, we aimed to minimize the effects of selective pressure. Our results indicate that 14408C>T mutation increases the mutation rate, while the third-most common RdRp mutation, 15324C>T, has the opposite effect. It is possible that 14408C>T mutation may have contributed to the dominance of its co-mutations in Europe and elsewhere.",

Importantly, natural selection acting on different levels and ways in different environments could potentially lead to faulty estimates of any change in the replicational mutation rate. Therefore, in order to minimize the effects of natural selection, we focused our attention on parts of the genome that may be under lower selective pressure.",

On the other hand, key proteins for virulence and transmissibility, such as the S protein, seem to be under high selective pressure, possibly as a result of novel host adaptation13. To identify how the RdRp mutations affect the mutation rate of the SARS-CoV-2 genome, we examined the relationships of the RdRp mutations with mutations found in M or E proteins (hereafter referred to as MoE), in terms of both time and location. In particular, we focused on the 10 most common mutations in the RdRp region, with the goal of identifying whether each variant is associated with increased or decreased non-selective mutation rates, and whether the geographical distribution of these variants might suggest the presence of multiple forms of virus with various mutability across the globe.",

The genomes were aligned against the reference genome sequence obtained from the NCBI Nucleotide database in the FASTA format, under the locus ID NC_045512.2 (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/NC_045512.2), after nonstandard unresolved base calls (sequence characters which are not one of A, C, G, T, N, or -) were changed into the standard unresolved sequence character N via the Unix sed command. The alignment was performed with the MAFFT multiple sequence alignment program, using the \"--auto -keeplength --addfragments isolate_genomes.fa reference_genome.fa > alignment.fa\" parameters. The sites differing from the reference sequence were extracted using snp-sites (https://github.com/sanger-pathogens/snp-sites), with the \"-v -o variants.vcf alignment.fa\" options. The resulting VCF file was modified for compatibility with the following steps using text editing and bcftools (http://www.htslib.org/download/), replacing the first column, indicating reference sequence name, with NC_045512v2, and separating different variants at the same nucleotide to individual lines, using the VCF processing guide available in the ANNOVAR documentation (https://docopenbio.readthedocs.io/projects/annovar/en/latest/articles/VCF/). The final VCF file was converted into an avinput file, using convert2annovar.pl found under ANNOVAR, with the parameters \"-format vcf4old variants.vcf > variants.avinput\". The custom ANNOVAR gene annotations for SARS-CoV-2 were obtained from ANNOVAR resources, decompressed, and placed in the sarscov2db directory. The variants were then annotated in terms of their relationships to gene loci and products, using the table_annovar.pl function of ANNOVAR, with the parameters \"-buildver NC_045512v2 variants.avinput sarscov2db/ -protocol avGene -operation g\".",

The sites mutated in at least two isolates had a mean of 26.25 mutated isolates, and a median of 3, To identify the distribution of common mutations by the number of isolates they are found in, we identified the top 50 mutated sites and the number of isolates with a non-reference resolved base in those sites (Fig. 1 ). Three nucleotides, 3037, 14408, and 23403, were found to be mutated in over 7000 isolates. Out of these three, 14408C>T was previously established as a mutation of interest for the RdRp gene. 23403A>G is a nonsynonymous mutation in the surface glycoprotein, while 3037 is a synonymous mutation in nsp3, a replication scaffolding protein15. Notably, only 26 of the top 50 sites were found in the Orf1ab coding region, despite it comprising 71% of the SARS-CoV-2 genome, with the percentage being 57%, 61%, and 65.3% when we consider top 100, top 200, and all mutated sites, respectively (data not shown). Other than 14408C>T, two of the top 50 mutations were also in the RdRP coding sequence, although both of them are synonymous mutations that do not presumably affect the protein structure. Two of the sites were found in the membrane glycoprotein coding region, with 26729T>C being a synonymous mutation, and 27046C>T being a nonsynonymous mutation causing a T175M mutation in the peptide sequence. None of the top 50 mutated sites were found in the envelope glycoprotein region, which has only 23 sites mutated in multiple isolates.",

Although location was another predictor of MoE, as expected, multivariate logistic regression analysis indicated that the association between RdRp mutations and mutational status of M or E genes was independent from location. explained by better adaptation of the viruses with a mutation that cause increased mutation rate to changing environments, it could as well be explained by founder effects, genetic drift, and other epidemiological factors. More data and particularly functional studies where mutant viruses can be compared side by side will be required to test this hypothesis. EPI_ISL_429089); and two more Chinese viral sequences that failed our quality control standards and therefore eliminated from the overall analysis. Despite weeks of existence, unless completely confined and eliminated, only after the appearance of the first Italian case with all four mutations on February 20, 23403A>G became the dominant form. If this form of SARS-CoV-2 is really more transmissible, the next question that needs to be answered is whether it is due to any one of the three mutations alone, or whether a combination of two or three are needed. Based on the lack of successful spreading of the virus in its absence and our results showing increased mutability in its presence, we speculate that 14408C>T could be cooperating with the other two mutations. Alternatively, altered mutation rate may be a byproduct and the RdRp mutations may act through speeding up or slowing down the replication process,which would in turn affect the viral load and virulence. Also, mutant RdRp may become more resistant to anti-viral drugs, such as the commonly used remdesivir.Such implications make RdRp mutations attractive targets for epidemiological and functional studies with direct therapeutic implications.Effects of different mutations on SARS-CoV-2 phenotypes (i.e. mutation rate, transmissibility, virulence, immune evasion etc.) are hot topics of research as there is an intense race worldwide to develop therapies and understand the viral biology. Some of these studies suggested that RdRp and Spike protein mutations could significantly affect the virus behavior and therefore the human health. Our study sheds light on the effects RdRp mutations, particularly 14408C>T mutation, on the mutability and possibly transmissibility of SARS-CoV-2. Further functional studies are required to test our findings.",
