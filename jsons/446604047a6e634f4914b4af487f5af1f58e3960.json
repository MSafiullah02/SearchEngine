We first build a simple word vector average for each document, and we use the similarities to alter this average representation. The document representations can help to solve many information retrieval tasks, such as recommendation, classification and clustering.

This information can be used to improve the accuracy of document representations. Several recent methods [11, 20] study the embedding of networks with textual attributes associated to the nodes. Most of them learn continuous representations for nodes independently of a word-vector representation. That is to say, documents and words do not lie in the same space. It is interesting to find a common space to represent documents and words when considering many tasks in information retrieval (query expansion) and document analysis (description of document clusters). Our approach allows to represent documents and words in the same semantic space. The method can be applied with word embedding learned on the data with any state-of-the art method [6, 12] , or with embeddings that were previously learned 1 to reduce the computation cost. Contrary to many existing methods that make use of deep and complex neural networks (see Sect. 2 for related works), our method is fast, and it has only one parameter to tune.",

TADW [20] is the first method that deals with this kind of data. It formulates network embedding [15] as a matrix tri-factorization problem to integrate textual information. Subsequent methods mainly adopt neural network based models: STNE [11] extends the seq2seq models, Graph2Gauss [3] learns both representations and variances via energy based learning, and VGAE [8] adopts a variational encoder. Even if these approaches yield good results, they require tuning a lot of hyperparameters. Two methods are based on factorization approaches: GVNR-t [4] , that extends GloVe [14] , and AANE [7] . None of these methods learn documents and words embedding in the same space. In [10] and [1] , authors represent them in a comparable space. Yet, they do not consider network information, as opposed to LDE [19] . Nonetheless, this last method requires labels associated with nodes, making it a supervised approach. Our method projects the documents and the words into the same space in an unsupervised fashion, with only one hyperparameter to tune. We will now present the formulation of this approach.",
