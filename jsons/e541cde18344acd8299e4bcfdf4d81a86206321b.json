However, it was recently discovered that IFITs can directly recognize viral RNA bearing a 59-triphosphate group (PPP-RNA), which is a molecular signature that distinguishes it from host RNA. Here we report crystal structures of human IFIT5, its complex with PPP-RNAs, and an amino-terminal fragment of IFIT1. The structures reveal a new helical domain that houses a positively charged cavity designed to specifically engage only single-stranded PPP-RNA, thus distinguishing it from the canonical cytosolic sensor of double-stranded viral PPP-RNA, retinoic acid-inducible gene I (RIG-I, also known as DDX58). Mutational analysis, proteolysis and gel-shift assays reveal that PPP-RNA is bound in a non-sequence-specific manner and requires a 59-overhang of approximately three nucleotides. Abrogation of PPP-RNA binding in IFIT1 and IFIT5 was found to cause a defect in the antiviral response by human embryonic kidney cells. These results demonstrate the mechanism by which IFIT proteins selectively recognize viral RNA, and lend insight into their downstream effector function.",

This is facilitated by a connecting 17-residue loop (L1) containing a highly conserved Cys-His-Phe-Thr-Trp pentapeptide motif that is invariant among nearly all of the IFIT proteins ( Supplementary Fig. 2 ), and forms a single turn of a helix that packs against the concave inner face of subdomain I ( Supplementary Fig. 4 ). This same arrangement of subdomain I is also found in the structure of nIFIT1 (root mean squared deviation, 1.4 \u00c5 ; Supplementary Fig. 3 ) and is probably a defining characteristic of all IFIT proteins given the high TPR and sequence conservation in subdomains I and II ( Supplementary Figs 1 and 2) .",

All of the structures were similar, and therefore we initially describe the general features of the IFIT5-oligo-C complex as it was the highest resolution structure. Difference Fourier maps revealed strong positive electron density within the central positively charged pocket from which the 59-triphosphate and the first four nucleotides of the RNA could be reliably modelled ( Fig. 2a and Supplementary Fig. 10a) . The 59-triphosphate group is nestled deep within the pocket and makes a multitude of electrostatic interactions with protein side chains from helix a2 (Glu 33, Thr 37 and Gln 41) located at the very base of the pocket, and residues from the concave inner surface of subdomain II (Lys 150, Tyr 250 and Arg 253) (Fig. 2c) . Arg 187 in IFIT1 was previously identified to be required for RNA interaction; the homologous residue in IFIT5 (Arg 186) makes a weak salt-bridge with the aand b-phosphates, and van der Waals contacts with the first ribose moiety. These RNA-interacting residues are for the most part conserved in sequence and structure between IFIT5 and IFIT1 ( Supplementary  Figs 2 and 7) , the only IFITs that have been shown to bind PPP-RNA with strong affinity 2 . One notable exception is Thr 37, which is replaced in IFIT1 by Arg 38, suggesting slight differences in RNA recognition between IFIT1 and IFIT5. Conversely, in IFIT3, which is known to not bind PPP-RNA 2 , Tyr 250 is substituted with a negatively charged residue, Asp 242, and Arg 186 with His 182 ( Supplementary  Fig. 2) , both of which would interfere directly with RNA binding.",

On the basis of ligand distances and geometry, the ion is probably Mg 21 from the in vitro transcription reactions, but could potentially also be Na 1 (a component of the crystallization buffer). It is unlikely that capped messenger RNA (mRNA) can be accommodated within this pocket owing to size constraints. In addition, given the critical interactions made with the c-phosphate and the metal ion, the pocket is unlikely to accept 59-monophosphorylated or 59-hydroxylated RNA with considerable affinity. Thus, the structure of the IFIT5 TPR domains have evolved to specifically engage PPP-RNA, and in doing so, distinguish between self and non-self nucleic acids.",

Notably, the first two bases do not make any specific hydrogen bonds with protein residues and there is ample space adjacent to the pyrimidine ring edges, suggesting that the larger purine bases can also be easily accommodated (Fig. 3) . The structure of the oligo-A complex confirms this notion and reveals that the adenine rings reach further out into the periphery making additional non-specific van der Waals contacts with Thr 371, His 374 and Phe 339, which were absent with the pyrimidine bases ( Fig. 3b-d) .",

These motions position several key residues from the different subdomains for optimal interaction with the RNA. Moreover, limited proteolysis of IFIT5 in the presence and absence of RNA supports the notion of compaction and stabilization of the protein in the RNA-bound form ( Fig. 4b and Supplementary Fig. 15 ).",

As a negative control we used IFIT3, which could not shift any species of RNA ( Fig. 5a and Supplementary  Fig. 16d) .

In doing so, one possible mechanism for IFIT function may be to latch onto the ends of viral RNA, preventing it from being properly replicated or packaged into progeny virions. Recent studies have suggested a role for IFIT proteins in sensing the 59-cap methylation status of some viral RNA (for example, West Nile virus, poxvirus and coronavirus) [22] [23] [24] . A 59-cap is present on positivesense virus genomes, but most viruses also have the ability to either hijack a cap from host mRNA or encode machinery to add a 59-cap structure to their mRNA, thereby potentially circumventing IFIT recognition 25 . Although a 59-cap cannot be accommodated within the RNA-binding pocket of IFIT5 identified here, we do not preclude the possibility that higher order complexes of IFITs may be able to recognize capped viral RNAs.",

Average percentage (6 s.d.) of influenza polymerase (flupol) activity as compared to control (ctrl) of four independent experiments done in duplicate measurements. ***P , 0.001 (one-way analysis of variance, Tukey's multiple comparison test).Figure 4 | IFIT5 undergoes a conformational change upon binding PPP-RNA. a, Comparison of IFIT5 bound to PPP-RNA (magenta) and the unbound form (green). Superimposed regions are coloured light grey. b, SDSpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of limited protease digestion of IFIT5 in the presence and absence of RNA taken from each experiment at the 15-min time point (see also Supplementary Fig. 15). Chymtryp, chymotrypsin. c, Summary of SAXS results. Measurements are the average from three concentrations, with the corresponding standard deviation.PPP-RNAs are found within the genome of negative-sense ssRNA viruses such as influenza and vesicular stomatitis virus. Other RNA viruses, such as positive-sense viruses which have 59-capped genomes, can also generate cytosolic PPP-RNAs as replicative intermediates during their life cycle. Hence, the evolution of a binding site to specifically recognize PPP-RNA allows IFITs to distinguish self from non-self RNAs, as cytosolic host ssRNAs bear a 59-monophosphate (on ribosomal RNA and transfer RNA)",
