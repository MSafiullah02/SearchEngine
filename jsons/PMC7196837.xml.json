The most common symptoms at disease onset were fever (7 of 10 patients), cough (eight cases), and shortness of breath (eight cases), while less common symptoms included sputum production (five cases), chest pain (two cases), diarrhea (two cases), nausea and vomiting (two cases), headache (one case), and sore throat (one case). Four patients had underlying chronic diseases, including cardiovascular and/or cerebrovascular diseases and essential hypertension. Nine patients received arbidol monotherapy or combination therapy with remdesivir (in one case not included in the current clinical trial), or ribavirin, or peramivir, while one patient received ribavirin monotherapy (Table 2). Antibacterial or antifungal treatment was used when patients had coinfection. Six patients received intravenous (i.v.) methylprednisolone (20 mg every 24 h).",

Recent studies on COVID-19 demonstrated that the lymphocyte counts in the peripheral blood were remarkably decreased and the levels of cytokines in the plasma from patients requiring intensive care unit (ICU) support, including IL-6, IL-10, TNF-\u0251, and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor, were significantly higher than in those who did not require ICU conditions (2, 18). CP, obtained from recovered COVID-19 patients who had established humoral immunity against the virus, contains a large quantity of neutralizing antibodies capable of neutralizing SARS-CoV-2 and eradicating the pathogen from blood circulation and pulmonary tissues (19). In the present study, all investigated patients achieved serum SARS-CoV-2 RNA negativity after CP transfusion, accompanied by an increase of oxygen saturation and lymphocyte counts, and the improvement of liver function and CRP. The results suggest that the inflammation and overreaction of the immune system were alleviated by antibodies contained in CP. The case fatality rates (CFRs) in the present study were 0% (0/10), which was comparable to the CFRs in SARS, which varied from 0% (0/10) to 12.5% (10/80) in four noncomparative studies using CP treatment (9, 20\u201322). Based on our preliminary results, CP therapy can be an easily accessible, promising, and safe rescue option for severe COVID-19 patients. It is, nevertheless, worth mentioning that the absorption of pulmonary lesions often lagged behind the improvement of clinical symptoms, as shown in patients 9 and 10 in this trial.",

A small sample study in MERS-CoV infection showed that the neutralizing antibody titer should exceed 1:80 to achieve effective CP therapy (12). To find eligible donors who have high levels of neutralizing antibody is a prerequisite. Cao et al. (23) showed that the level of specific neutralizing antibody to SARS-CoV decreased gradually 4 mo after the disease process, reaching undetectable levels in 25.6% (IgG) and 16.1% (neutralizing antibodies) of patients at 36 mo after disease status. A study from the MERS-CoV\u2212infected patients and the exposed healthcare workers showed that the prevalence of MERS-CoV IgG seroreactivity was very low (2.7%), and the antibodies titer decreased rapidly within 3 mo (24). These studies suggested that the neutralizing antibodies represented short-lasting humoral immune response, and plasma from recently recovered patients should be more effective. In the present study, recently recovered COVID-19 patients, who were infected by SARS-CoV-2 with neutralizing antibody titer above 1:640 and recruited from local hospitals, should be considered as suitable donors. The median age of donors was lower than that of recipients (42.0 y vs. 52.5 y). Among the nine cases investigated, the neutralizing antibody titers of five patients increased to 1:640 within 2 d, while four patients kept the same level. The antibody titers in CP in COVID-19 seem thus higher than those used in the treatment of MERS patient (1:80) (12).",

Consistent with previous research, all three patients receiving plasma transfusion given before 14 dpoi (patients 1, 2, and 9) in our study showed a rapid increase of lymphocyte counts and a decrease of CRP, with remarkable absorption of lung lesions in CT.

No specific virus was detected before transfusion. Transfusion-related acute lung injury was reported in an Ebola virus disease woman who received CP therapy (26). Although uncommon in the general population receiving plasma transfusion, this specific adverse reaction is worth noting, especially among critically ill patients experiencing significant pulmonary injury (27). Another rare risk worth mentioning during CP therapy is antibody-dependent infection enhancement, occurring at subneutralizing concentrations, which could suppress innate antiviral systems and thus could allow logarithmic intracellular growth of the virus (28). The special infection enhancement also could be found in SARS-CoV infection in vitro (29). No such pulmonary injury and infection enhancement were observed in our patients, probably owing to high levels of neutralizing antibodies, timely transfusion, and appropriate plasma volume.",

All patients received antiviral treatment despite the uncertainty of the efficacy of drugs used. As a result, the possibility that these antiviral agents could contribute to the recovery of patients, or synergize with the therapeutic effect of CP, could not be ruled out. Furthermore, some patients received glucocorticoid therapy, which might interfere with immune response and delay virus clearance. Second, the median time from onset of symptoms to CP transfusion was 16.5 d (IQR, 11.0 d to 19.3 d). Although the kinetics of viremia during natural history remains unclear, the relationship between SARS-CoV-2 RNA reduction and CP therapy, as well as the optimal concentration of neutralizing antibodies and treatment schedule, should be further clarified. Third, the dynamic changes of cytokines during treatment were not investigated. Nevertheless, the preliminary results of this trial seem promising, justifying a randomized controlled clinical trial in a larger patient cohort.",
