Before 2002, known human coronaviruses HCoV-229E, NL63, OC43, and HKU1 were known to cause only mild symptoms similar to the common cold in immunocompetent individuals (Corman et al., 2018). More severe disease such as pneumonia and bronchitis occur in infants, the elderly and the immunosuppressed (Zumla et al., 2016a, Zumla et al., 2016b, Zumla et al., 2016c). Over the past 17 years, three previously unknown zoonotic coronaviruses, the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) coronavirus (SARS-CoV), the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) coronavirus (MERS-CoV), and SARS coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) have focused global attention due to their epidemic potential and high mortality rates (WHO, 2019a, WHO, 2019b). SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV are listed in the 2019 WHO list of blueprint priority diseases since they are considered potential threats to global public health security (WHO, 2019c). In early 2020 the WHO declared SARS-CoV-2 had established a pandemic infection and was added to the WHO list of blueprint priority diseases. The rest of this article provide detailed information on SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, with SARS-CoV-2 discussed briefly (due to its novelty) at the end of the article.",

Retrospective analysis of a cluster of hospital cases dated back to Apr 2012 in Jordan also confirmed MERS-CoV as the etiology of the outbreak (Hijawi et al., 2013). MERS-CoV continues to circulate and remains endemic to the Middle East causing sporadic cases and occasional nosocomial and community outbreaks\u2014which are a hallmark of MERS-CoV infection (Hui et al., 2018). It has remained on the radar of global public health authorities (WHO, 2019b) because of recurrent nosocomial and community outbreaks, its association with severe disease and high mortality rates, and its epidemic potential (Hui et al., 2015). Intermittent sporadic cases, community clusters and nosocomial outbreaks of MERS-CoV continue to occur in Saudi Arabia (WHO, 2019b).",

The spread of SARS from the index case to other inpatients in the same medical ward of the PWH appeared consistent with airborne transmission (Yu et al., 2005). SARS-CoV has been detected in upper and lower respiratory tract secretions, feces, urine, and tears. SARS can also spread by airborne transmission as highlighted by a major community outbreak at Amoy Gardens, a private residential complex in Hong Kong. The outbreak also extended to nearby residential areas, thought to be by airborne transmission over a distance of 200 meters (Yu et al., 2014). In Toronto, Canada air samples from a SARS patient's room, and swab samples taken from room surfaces and a nurses\u2019 station were positive by SARS-CoV PCR (Booth et al., 2005).",

However it appears contact with an intermediary animal or contaminated source other than bats is involved. Several estimates of the time frame of the emergence of MERS-CoV in humans suggest the emergence of MERS-CoV in mid-2011. In a study of 1100 bat samples, only one fragment of MERS CoV related to human MERS-CoV was found in one Taphozous bat (Memish et al., 2013a, Memish et al., 2013b, Memish et al., 2013c). MERS-related CoV was identified from a Neoromicia capensis bat sampled in South Africa and a phylogenetic study supports the hypothesis that bats are the evolutionary source of MERS-CoV (Corman et al., 2014, Corman et al., 2018).",

Twelve probable cases of secondary transmission, and seven apparently healthy household contacts were MERS-CoV positive in their upper respiratory tract (Drosten et al., 2014a, Drosten et al., 2014b, Drosten et al., 2014c). Low levels of MERS-CoV RNA have been reported from asymptomatic subjects from MERS-CoV outbreaks in a Jeddah hospital indicating MERS-CoV carriage after exposure to infected patients (Oboho et al., 2015). A study of 79 extended family members after an MERS-CoV outbreak in Saudi Arabia in 2014, found that 19 (24%) were MERS-CoV positive; 11 were seriously ill and hospitalized, and 2 died (Arwady et al., 2016). Risk factors identified by the study for household transmission were: handling patient's excreta and respiratory secretions and sleeping in the index patient's room. Risk factors for MERS-CoV transmission are given in Table 1\n.",

They account for upto 40% of MERS cases reported worldwide (Hui et al., 2018; Choi et al., 2017). The largest nosocomial outbreaks have been reported from Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates, and the Republic of Korea. An outbreak of MERS-CoV infection in Al Hasa, Saudi Arabia in 2013 involved 23 patients in 3 different hospitals and arose due to poor infection control practices, aerosol-generating procedures, CPAP, and cardiopulmonary resuscitation (Assiri et al., 2013a, Assiri et al., 2013b). In early 2017, two unlinked clusters of MERS cases occurred at the same hospital in Wadi ad-Dawasir City, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia involving household contacts, HCWs and patients (Memish et al., 2013a, Memish et al., 2013b, Memish et al., 2013c, Memish et al., 2013d). In June 2017 an outbreak of 34 MERS-CoV cases occurred in a hospital in Riyadh City, Riyadh (Alenazi et al., 2017). The primary case was a 47-year-old male admitted to the ED for intubation who at that time was not identified as infected with MERS-CoV. Prior to diagnosis, 220 HCWs, patients and visitors had contact with this patient. Contact tracing, identified an additional 33 MERS cases during this outbreak. Fifty percent of the cases associated with this outbreak were HCWs. In 2017 a large outbreak in Riyadh involving 4 hospitals, 48 MERS cases were identified involving patients, HCWs, and family members. The outbreak was ignited by four separate patients in the four HCF who were severely ill and not recognized early enough which led to superspreading events (Amer et al., 2018).",

MERS also manifests with fever, cough, chills, sore throat, myalgia and arthralgia, followed by dyspnea. In contrast to SARS, the clinical course of MERS is more severe in a larger proportion of cases with respiratory failure that requires mechanical ventilation and support in an intensive care unit and the mortality rates are higher. MERS-CoV causes more severe disease in older people, the immunocompromised, and those with chronic co-morbid diseases such as renal disease, cancer, chronic lung disease, and diabetes (Arabi et al., 2017; Zumla et al., 2015a, Zumla et al., 2015b; Hui et al., 2014).",

Thus, distinguishing MERS from other viral respiratory illness such as influenza A and B respiratory syncytial virus, parainfluenza viruses, rhinoviruses, adenoviruses, enteroviruses, human metapneumovirus, and endemic human coronaviruses is almost impossible. Most nosocomial outbreaks of MERS-CoV infection have been associated with a delay in diagnosis and late incorporation of infection control procedures. Early and accurate diagnosis of MERS-CoV infection is important for the clinical management, instituting infection control and epidemiological control measures of MERS-CoV infections. A high degree of clinical awareness of the possibility of MERS-CoV infection is required in all healthcare settings so that an accurate diagnosis can be made and infection control measures instituted as soon as the diagnosis is entertained clinically. A history of travel to the Middle East is important for patients presenting in non-Middle Eastern countries, while in endemic countries the use of point of care MERS-CoV testing is appropriate.",

Both upper respiratory tract specimens (oropharyngeal or nasopharyngeal) and lower respiratory tract specimens (sputum, endotracheal aspirate or lavage) should be analyzed whenever possible. Lower respiratory specimens have a higher diagnostic value than upper respiratory tract specimens for detecting MERS-CoV infection. If patients do not have signs or symptoms of lower respiratory tract disease and the collection of lower tract specimens is not possible or clinically indicated, upper respiratory tract specimens such as a nasopharyngeal aspirate or combined nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swabs should be collected. When taking nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal specimens, dacron or rayon swabs specifically designed for collecting specimens for virology must be used. These swab kits should contain virus transport medium. A single negative test result does not exclude the diagnosis and repeat sampling and testing is strongly recommended (Alfaraj et al., 2017). A minimum of two samples are needed to exclude MERS-coV after initial assessment. To confirm clearance of the virus, respiratory samples should be collected sequentially (every 2\u20134 days) over ensuing days until there are two consecutive negative results in clinically recovered persons.",

They found that the 3-day, 30-day, and overall mortality as 13.8%, 28.3%, and 29.8% respectively. Patients over the age of 60 were more likely to die (45.2% mortality) from their infections than were younger patients (20%). Patients with pre-existing medical co-morbidities tend to have more severe disease and higher mortality rates. Other studies have also described other factors associated with severe disease or death in MERS patients. These include male gender, comorbid pre-existing illnesses such as obesity, diabetes mellitus, heart and lung disease, and immunocompromised states, low serum albumin, concomitant infections, positive plasma MERS-CoV RNA. DPP4 receptors are upregulated in the lungs of smokers and patients with COPD and this may explain why patients with comorbid lung diseases are prone to severe illness (Hui et al., 2018; Alfaraj et al., 2017).",

The main infection prevention and control measures for managing patients with MERS are well documented from the SARS epidemic and from experiences from managing MERS outbreaks. Early identification and isolation of suspected or confirmed cases and ongoing surveillance are key to preventing nosocomial spread. Droplet precaution (wearing a surgical mask within 1 m of the patient) and contact and droplet precautions (wearing gown, gloves, mask, eye protection on entering the room and removing them on leaving) when caring for patients with suspected MERS. Healthcare workers (HCWs) should implement airborne precautions and wear a fit-tested particulate respirator such as a US NIOSH-approved N95 filtering facepiece respirator [FFR] or a European EN-approved FFP2 or FFP3 filtering facepiece respirator) when performing aerosol-generating procedures for infected and potentially-infected patients. It is also prudent to use higher levels of protection for HCWs who extended close contact with MERS patients and those who are exposed to aerosols from high-risk procedures. Higher levels of ventilation (more air changes, higher air flow and velocity), greater effort to prevent air dispersion beyond the point of generation (enclosure, using capture ventilation) and higher levels of personal protective equipment (more coverage, more protective types of respiratory protection) are all necessary. To reduce room contamination in the hospital setting, the application of a minimum room ventilation rate of 12 air changes per hour in a single room or at least 160 liters/second/patient in facilities with natural ventilation is recommended when caring for patients receiving mechanical ventilation and during aerosol-generating procedures. Avoiding aerosolizing procedures in crowded hospital emergency or inpatient medical wards without adequate control measures may decrease MERS-CoV human-to-human spread and environmental contamination (Zumla and Hui, 2014).",

This followed the appearance in December 2019 of a case cluster of patients with pneumonia of unknown cause in Wuhan, Hubei province in China. The Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention (China CDC) linked its source to Wuhan's Seafood market (China CDC Weekly, 2020). A novel coronavirus was identified from patients\u2019 samples using whole-genome sequencing and was provisionally named 2019-nCoV, now renamed as SARS-CoV-2. The disease caused by SARS-CoV-2 is abbreviated as COVID-19 (Zumla and Niederman, 2020). The clinical and virologic features of SARS-CoV-2 have been defined (Guan et al., 2020), and although there are similarities to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, some differences have also been observed. COVID-19 appears to replicate efficiently in the upper respiratory tract and seems to cause less abrupt onset of symptoms, which are similar to conventional human coronaviruses that are a major cause of common colds and URTIs in the winter seasons. The time from exposure to onset of symptoms is between 2 and 14 days, and infected subjects can probably transmit the infection before developing symptoms. This combined with a relatively high infectivity means that SARS-C0V-2 readily establishes community transmission and spread rapidly across the globe. As with SARS and MERS, data for COVID-19 available to date indicate a wide spectrum of clinical disease is being seen from asymptomatic, subclinical, mild, and self-limiting disease to severe disease and ARDS among the elderly or those with other comorbid diseases such as diabetes, chronic respiratory disease, and hypertension. As of 8 April, 2020, there have been 1,279,722 confirmed cases of COVID-19 (with 72,614 deaths) reported to the WHO (2020b). This pandemic has to date caused considerable social, economic, and political disruption globally with many countries adapting unprecedented social distancing policies that have paralyzed economic activity. The eventual total global mortality from COVID-19 will be significant.",
