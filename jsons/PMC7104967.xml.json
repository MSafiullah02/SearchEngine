Therefore, when E. coli\u2013associated diarrhea is suspected, screening for specific toxins or genes (e.g., Shiga toxin,16 attaching and effacing A gene,14, 17 etc.) is mandatory.15 It was recently reported that granulomatous colitis in dogs is associated with the presence of an invasive and adherent strain of E. coli in the colonic mucosa.18 A diagnosis can be made by specific labeling of the bacteria in colonic biopsy samples by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH); the recommended treatment is fluorinated quinolones. Accurate diagnosis is important in these cases because inappropriate use of antibiotics may induce severe antibiotic resistance (including to fluorinated quinolones).19 The FISH test is commercially available at the Simpson Laboratory at Cornell University (http://www.vet.cornell.edu/labs/simpson/).",

Their specificity is very high, but a false positive can occur with recent vaccination (less than 3 weeks).

Therefore, nutritional deficiency is very unlikely, and even a strictly vegetarian diet with low cobalamin content does not cause a decrease in serum cobalamin in cats.29 Folate and cobalamin have specific GI metabolism and uptake. Dietary folates are absorbed in the jejunum after hydrolysis of the alimentary folate polyglutamates to folate monoglutamates by a jejunal conjugase. The folate monoglutamate is absorbed by a specific jejunal carrier. Because the concentration of folate is high in red blood cells, hemolysis can falsely increase serum folate concentration, but lipemia or hyperbilirubinemia have no effect on serum folate concentration.30 Dietary cobalamin is absorbed in the ileum by a specific carrier after receptor-mediated endocytosis. Briefly, dietary cobalamin is bound to proteins from which it is released by pepsinogen and hydrochloric acid in the stomach. Then, cobalamin binds to gastric and salivary R protein and is subsequently released in the proximal small intestine by pancreatic proteases. Cobalamin then forms a complex with intrinsic factor (which is excreted from the pancreas), and the complex is absorbed by a specific ileal carrier. Therefore, cobalamin intestinal metabolism is very dependent on normal exocrine pancreatic and intestinal functions. Serum cobalamin measurements are not affected by hemolysis, lipemia, or hyperbilirubinemia.30 Because folate and cobalamine are abundant in commercial diets, their serum concentrations should only be measured in fasted animals.",

Intestinal bacteria can synthesize folate and use cobalamin. In SIBO, serum folate can be increased and cobalamin decreased. In EPI, decreased excretion of intrinsic factor (which is necessary for cobalamin absorption) and secondary SIBO (a common complication of EPI) often leads to decreased serum concentrations of cobalamin. Bacteria of the distal small intestine and large intestine produce a lot of folate that is excreted in the feces30 and can be absorbed in coprophagic animals. Serum folate concentrations are often increased in EPI because of secondary SIBO and also coprophagia. In dogs with EPI, the prevalences of increased serum folate, decreased serum cobalamin, or the combination of both are 60%, 82%, and 47%, respectively.31 Severe hypocobalaminemia is reported in 36% of dogs with EPI and decreased folate in only 2% of dogs with EPI.31 In a recent study of cats with EPI, 10/10 cats were hypocobalaminemic and 4/10 had increased serum folate concentrations. None had decreased serum folate concentrations.32 Serum cobalamin concentrations should be documented in dogs and cats on diagnosis of EPI and should be monitored during treatment because cobalamin intestinal absorption does not normalize after oral supplementation of pancreatic extracts in dogs with experimentally induced EPI.33 Treatment with vitamin B12 injections is recommended for animals with EPI, as well as monitoring of its serum concentrations (especially if the clinical condition worsens or in the case of treatment failure).",

Because \u03b11-PI is a protease inhibitor, it is resistant to hydrolysis and can be recovered in feces. In normal animals, only trace amounts of \u03b11-PI are present in the feces.54 ELISAs have been developed and validated to measure \u03b11-PI in canine serum and feces54 and in feline serum.55 Fecal \u03b11-PI is not affected by long-term nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drug treatment with carprofen or meloxican in dogs.56 Fecal \u03b11-PI has been suggested as an early marker of GI protein loss in dogs that are prone to PLE such as Soft-coated Wheaten Terriers57, 58, 59 and also in dogs with IBD before the development of hypoalbuminemia.60 Increased fecal \u03b11-PI has been reported in cats with chronic GI disease and concurrent hypocobalaminemia.61 The test is available exclusively at the Gastrointestinal Laboratory at Texas A&M University (http://www.vetmed.tamu.edu/gilab/). The web site should be consulted for specific information about sampling before submission because specific sample preparation is necessary. This test is helpful in monitoring cases before they develop overt hypoalbuminemia in situations where PLE is strongly suspected such as in Soft-coated Wheaten Terriers. In other cases, the suspicion of PLE is mostly based on identifying hypoalbuminemia and ruling out proteinuria and hepatic insufficiency. The test can be helpful, however, in patients with renal and/or liver disease if concurrent PLE is suspected. It might confirm the presence of PLE and help in making a decision to perform intestinal biopsies.",

However, recent studies have shown that the total number of bacteria is very variable and can exceed those numbers from time to time even in healthy dogs or cats.66, 67, 68 Therefore, to make a diagnosis of bacterial overgrowth, bacterial counts of duodenal juice should be above 2.7 \u00d7 109 cfu/mL or 1.1 \u00d7 109 cfu/mL in dogs and cats, respectively.66 Moreover, aside from quantification of the total number of bacteria, imbalances between the different species of the intestinal bacterial populations are probably also important. It is likely that the use of advanced molecular techniques such as massive parallel pyrosequencing or FISH will change the analyses of bacterial populations in chronic intestinal diseases such as IBD.69, 70, 71 Therefore, except in situations where a specific pathogen is targeted, it is probably of very low diagnostic yield to submit duodenal juice for culture in the workup of an animal with chronic GI disease.",

In a normal pancreas, the physiological turnover of pancreatic acinar cells allows leakage of small amounts of trypsinogen into the blood. In an animal with EPI, the amount of trypsinogen synthesized in pancreatic acinar cells is drastically reduced and because trypsinogen is pancreas specific, the concentration of trypsinogen in the blood is also severely reduced. The test is species specific and has been validated for use in dogs73 and cats.74 The canine TLI test is available in several laboratories, but the feline TLI test (fTLI) is only available at the Gastrointestinal Laboratory at Texas A&M. Because the test recognizes either canine or feline trypsinogen, it is not affected by pancreatic enzyme extracts used for the treatment of EPI. Serum TLI is increased after feeding in dogs75 and cats,76 and measurement should be made only after 12 hours of fasting. The test is affected by lipemia but not hemolysis or hyperbilirubinemia.30 The sensitivity and specificity of the decrease serum TLI for the diagnosis of exocrine pancreatic insufficiency are almost 100% in dogs73 and are probably also very high in cats.32 Other than EPI, the only cause for a decreased TLI is extreme protein malnutrition. This is because there is an adaptative response of the pancreatic enzyme synthesis to low protein diet in dogs with a direct relationship between serum TLI and the protein content of the diet.77 As for many laboratory tests, there is a gray zone for TLI in the diagnosis of EPI (2.5-5.7 \u03bcg/L in dogs and 8-12.4 \u03bcg/L in cats for the reference range provided by the GI laboratory at Texas A&M University). Animals with a TLI measurement in this gray zone may or may not progress to having TLI results diagnostic of EPI, and it is recommended to retest them within 1 to 3 months. In one study that followed up on 44 dogs with inconclusive TLI results, 20/44 dogs had a normal TLI on the second sample.78 TLI became diagnostic of EPI in 11/44 dogs and remained in the gray zone for 13/44 dogs. These latter dogs underwent gross examination and biopsy of the pancreas, which showed a remarkable reduction in the amount of normal exocrine pancreatic tissue, but 8 dogs had no GI signs and 5 dogs had intermittent GI signs atypical for EPI.78 These dogs were diagnosed with subclinical exocrine pancreatic insufficiency. It is recommended to retest these dogs on a regular basis because they may develop overt EPI that requires enzyme supplementation.",

Several tests have been made available sequentially for the PLI measurement in dogs and cats: the original radioimmunoassay (RIA) based on polyclonal antibodies to native purified protein, Spec cPL and Spec fPL, which are commercial quantitative ELISAs based on monoclonal antibodies and recombinant antigen, and finally, SNAP cPL (IDEXX), a semiquantitative point-of-care ELISA based on monoclonal antibodies for the measurement of canine PL (cPL). The PLI RIA is not commercially available anymore. Analytical validation of the Spec cPL test has shown good precision and reproducibility and no interference of bilirubin, lipid, and hemoglobin on results.97 The SNAP cPL has 96% to 100% agreement with the Spec cPL in samples with normal PLI and 88% to 92% agreement in samples with elevated PLI.98 This means that in a case with a low to moderate index of suspicion of pancreatic damage, a positive SNAP cPL result should be confirmed with quantitative Spec cPL. As for TLI, PLI tests are species specific. PL is stable for 21 days at temperatures ranging from \u201380\u00b0C to 24\u00b0C and is not affected by long-term prednisolone treatment in dogs99 or by the fat content of the diet.75 However, there is a slight increase in canine PLI (cPLI)75 after eating, and therefore cPLI and feline PLI (fPLI) should be evaluated only in fasted animals. In normal dogs, pancreatic fine-needle aspiration or surgical biopsy had no effect on cPLI.100 Similarly, pancreatic laparoscopic biopsies had no effect on fPLI in healthy cats.101 However, because these studies were performed in healthy animals and the effect of fine-needle aspiration or biopsy in an abnormal pancreas is unknown, it is recommended to perform blood sampling for PLI before sampling of pancreatic tissue.",

TLI was above the reference range in 8/22 dogs.105 This study was limited to cases with mild or moderate pancreatitis based on histological evaluation, and it is likely that results could be different in more severe cases. A recent multi-institutional study yielded a sensitivity of 93% and specificity of 78% of Spec cPL for the diagnosis of canine acute pancreatitis. In this study, the diagnosis of acute pancreatitis was based on information from medical records and imaging findings that were evaluated by 5 different experts blinded to the results of Spec cPL.91 The negative and positive likelihood ratios were 0.029 and 1.3, i.e., Spec cPL within the reference range is better at rejecting the diagnosis than the opposite.91 This means that Spec cPL is currently the best diagnostic test for canine acute pancreatitis. However, as for any diagnostic test, there are false-positive and false-negative results and it is always advisable to make the diagnosis based on the combination of clinical signs, laboratory test results, and imaging studies.",

However, despite this very high variability, values measured in healthy dogs remained in the current reference range for Spec cPL. When using Spec PL for the diagnosis of pancreatitis, a cutoff has been fixed (> 5.4 \u03bcg/L in cats and > 400 \u03bcg/L in dogs) and there is a gray zone between the cutoff and the upper limit of the reference range (3.5 \u03bcg/L in cats and 200 \u03bcg/L in dogs).

Three independent clinical studies, which included cats with histologically confirmed acute and chronic pancreatitis, reported sensitivities and specificities of TLI ranging from 28% to 44.4% and from 70% to 90%, respectively, depending on the cutoff applied for the diagnosis of pancreatitis107, 111, 112 In dogs, sensitivities of canine TLI (cTLI) for the diagnosis of pancreatitis (acute or chronic) ranged from 38% to 45.5%.89, 105 Two dogs with renal failure, among a control group of 28 dogs with nonpancreatic diseases, had increased cTLI (specificity of 92%).89 In a recent study on a group of 14 dogs with chronic pancreatitis, the sensitivity of cTLI was 17%.92 Therefore, TLI is not sensitive but fairly specific (if renal failure is not present) for the diagnosis of pancreatitis in dogs or cats.

They should be envisioned as cytolytic enzymes, mirroring the approach that has been used for decades with liver-specific enzymes. They should be considered markers of acinar cell damage in conditions ranging from transient increase in plasma membrane permeability to complete necrosis (e.g., acute-necrotizing pancreatitis). They cannot be considered as markers of a specific pancreatic disease, namely pancreatitis. The diagnosis of pancreatitis is largely a diagnosis of exclusion. It should rely on a combination of a strong clinical suspicion, results of laboratory tests, imaging studies, and, whenever possible, cytological (Fig 2) or histopathological evidence of pancreatic inflammation. The clinical significance of mild pancreatic lesions observed in dogs and cats that have no clinical signs of pancreatitis is questionable. Considering the high prevalence of lesions suggestive of chronic pancreatitis in necropsy of dogs (34%)115 and cats (67%) presenting for other diseases, and in apparently healthy cats (45%),82 it is very important to keep in mind that the positive predictive value of any test improves substantially when performed in an animal that is likely to have the disease.
