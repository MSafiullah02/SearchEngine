However, China has rapidly organized experts to formulate additional relevant legislations for more efficient and effective actions, based on the Chinese Criminal Law. On February 6, China released the Judicial Interpretations on Punishing Legally the Crimes of Violating the Prevention of Novel Coronavirus Infected Pneumonia [8].",

According to Article 452, if a person committed the crime negligently, he shall be punished with imprisonment from one year to five years [10].
