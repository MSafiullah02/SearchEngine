Site A was a large, urban teaching hospital where all 3 forms of respiratory protection were in use during the study period. Sites B and D were suburban and urban community hospitals, respectively, where the primary form of respiratory protection was N95-FFR. Site C was a suburban rural-based community hospital, where the primary form of respiratory protection used was PAPR. Site E was a collection of urban ambulatory practices affiliated with site A, where the primary form of respiratory protection was EHFR. Each site had existing RPP policies and procedures for training and fit testing as needed that complied with the OSHA Respiratory Protection Standard (29 CFR 1910.134). The study was approved by the University of Maryland-Baltimore institutional review board.",

As the primary objective of the study was to compare attitudes and beliefs of EHFR users to N95-FFR users, HCWs from additional sites primarily using N95-FFRs were recruited, and EHFR users were oversampled.

This created an unfair advantage to participants at the other 4 sites in being able to complete the survey before the recruitment limit of 1,000 was reached.

Second, to formally compare differences between groups, 5-point Likert scale responses were analyzed as continuous variables, ranging from 1 (representing the most negative response) to 5 (representing the most positive response).

Then, multinomial logistic regression modeling was used to estimate the relative odds of preferring EHFR and PAPR (vs N95-FFR) between 2 increased threat-level scenarios versus the usual circumstances scenario. Generalized estimating equations were used for this analysis to account for intraindividual correlation of responses to the 3 threat scenario questionnaire items.",

We devised a strategy to: (1) identify a potentially critical set of covariates, (2) collapse categorical covariates where stratification was not critical, and (3) fit the regression models and reduce the number of covariate terms to a maximum of 12 (highest P values first), as long as there was a <10% change in the beta coefficients of interest (ie, for threat scenario). The a priori identified initial critical set of covariates were: age, sex, race (white or nonwhite), assigned respirator, employer (binary), primary unit (3 levels), job category (3 levels), percent of time wearing a respirator (3 levels), and years working in health care. The maximum change in the beta coefficients for threat level from covariate reduction in the 3 user group models was 1.4%",

First, the question, \u201cWhat respirator would you prefer to wear under usual circumstances, such as caring for a patient who is being ruled-out for TB?\u201d was asked. The risk scenario was then escalated to caring for a patient with known, active TB and finally to a setting of pandemic H1N1 or SARS. The majority of each user group preferred to stay with their current respirator type under usual circumstances (Table 3\n). As risk increased to exposure to active TB, however, the percentage staying with or switching to EHFR or PAPR increased in each user group. When exposure was to pandemic H1N1 or SARS, the propensity to stay with or switch to EHFR was not as strong as with exposure to active TB, but propensity to prefer PAPR was higher. For all user groups, reusable respirators were significantly more likely to be preferred over N95-FFRs in higher risk scenarios compared to usual circumstance scenarios (Table 4\n). Adjustment for covariates increased the odds of preferring either EHFR or PAPR compared to N95-FFR in all user groups and in each threat scenario compared to usual circumstances.",

First, there may be greater confidence in obtaining a reliable fit, given the more durable design of the EHFR. Further, the mask has a larger surface area in contact with the face, which may promote a better seal or even a perception of a better seal. Second, the EHFR users may wear their respirators more frequently than the N95-FFR users, yielding a greater familiarity with the mask and assessment of how well it protects. When adjusted for frequency of use, however, there was still a pattern of preference for EHFR. Another hypothesis was that this EHFR preference may have been driven by a dominant choice by a specific worker group (eg, nurses compared to doctors). When we adjusted for job category, however, there was still a statistically significant preference for EHFR under increasing threat levels. Finally, we explored whether having an increased perception of risk susceptibility might influence preference for respirator type. To understand underlying perceptions among different respirator users, this study queried whether routine EHFR users were influenced more by fear of the potential diseases they could encounter, compared to N95-FFR users. They were not. They rated the likelihood of contracting TB, SARS, or Ebola when not wearing a respirator similarly to N95-FFR users, suggesting that they view the diseases themselves similarly as other respirator users.",

In the current study's population of experienced EHFR users, the comfort ratings for these devices were not dramatically different from the ratings of N95-FFRs, and mean response values fell in the neutral or positive range.

The number of current EHFR users is smaller than that originally anticipated and on which power calculations were based. Some of this is owing to changes in respirator assignment surrounding the time of survey deployment.

Also, participants were asked what respirator they were most recently assigned to use and what respirator they usually use.
