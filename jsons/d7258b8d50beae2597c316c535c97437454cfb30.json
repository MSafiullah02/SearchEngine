To date, the impact of development of healthcare-associated infections (HAIs) in patients with COVID-19 or vice versa is uncertain. The situation gets even more difficult given the high rate of HAIs in the country as well as lack of effective antiviral therapy and absence of vaccines against this virus, what makes current treatments for this disease are mainly focused on symptomatic and respiratory support and of rigorous implementation of public health measures.",

Half of non-survivors (n = 27/54) experienced a secondary infection, and that all but one of them had been treated with antibiotics. Besides that, ventilator-associated pneumonia occurred in ten (31%) of 32 patients requiring invasive mechanical ventilation.
