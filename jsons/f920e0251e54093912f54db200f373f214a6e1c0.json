The study included 184 patients with 31 patients having a thrombotic complication. This adds up to an incidence of 16.8%, not 31%. Additionally, the authors report that 9.2% of the patients were on therapeutic anticoagulation upon admission. They do not report what percentage of those that made up the composite outcome were already on therapeutic anticoagulation upon enrollment in the study. This makes it plausible that the incidence of a true new thrombotic event was even lower than 16.8%. Finally, it is not clear if this study was prospective or retrospective, information that will help clinicians to weigh the validity of the results.",

A recently published study claimed that anticoagulant therapy for COVID-19 patients was associated with decreased mortality [3] . Careful review of this study elucidated that the patients received prophylactic, not therapeutic doses of anticoagulation and thus the conclusions drawn by the authors are inaccurate. Another study attempted to elucidate the prevalence of VTE and reported that 25% of 81 patients with COVID-19 had a DVT. Unfortunately, this study is not representative as none of the 81 patients received VTE chemical prophylaxis, making the true prevalence of VTE in these patients unclear [4] .",
