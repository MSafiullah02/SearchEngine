The increased life-time prevalence of SMI (Schizophrenia and other psychotic disorders 0.9%, Bipolar disorder 0.5%, Major depressive disorder 3.9%) was reported in China last year (Huang et al., 2019) . The majority of the patients with SMI are functionally disabled and overall less able to utilize/access mental health services (Li et al., 2013) . Patients with SMI appear to have been more vulnerable to the emerging infectious disease consistent with overall trends in risk for medical comorbidity; along with barriers to appropriate nutrition and exercise, polypharmacy, and sustained hospitalizations (Chiang et al., 2019; Zhu et al., 2020) . Moreover, the patients with SMI could be a potential source of infection for the emerging infectious viruses, such as COVID-19, because he/she was difficulty to be screened and quarantined (Sujita et al., 2020) .",
