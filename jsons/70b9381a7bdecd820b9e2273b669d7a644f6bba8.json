            "text": "Mismatched ABO solid organ transplantation is often employed due to the shortage of transplantable organs. Three different groups of ABO incompatibility can be found in transplantation: minor, major, and bidirectional. Complications arising from minor ABO-mismatched solid organ transplants include the passenger lymphocyte syndrome (PLS) [6] . Recipients of minor ABO-incompatible transplantation express ABO antigens that are not expressed in the donor and may result in a graft-versus-host (GvH) reaction, including delayed hemolysis of recipient red blood cells [7] . Passenger lymphocyte syndrome occurs when antibodies that are produced by the donor B-lymphocytes result in a primary or secondary immune response against the recipient's ABO and Rh antigens. The severity of hemolysis depends on the level of red cell isoagglutinins in the donor tissue that are passively transferred with the organ and the subsequent rise in antibodies in the transplant recipient that occurs 1-3 weeks posttransplant and usually resolves within 3 months posttransplant [7] . In rare instances, PLS can occur due to non-ABO/Rh antibodies if the organ had been previously sensitized to other red cell antigens in the setting of pregnancy or transfusion [8] [9] [10] [11] . PLS occurs more frequently in the heart and lung transplants and less frequently in liver and kidney transplants [7] .",

A number of immunosuppressants with various pharmacologic mechanisms of action are used to prolong graft and recipient survival. The immunosuppressants mycophenolate mofetil and tacrolimus have been shown to cause anemia in renal transplant recipients [12] . One-year posttransplant, renal transplant patients with anemia who are on mycophenolate mofetil have a lower rates of survival and higher rates of cardiovascular death [13] . Sirolimus, another immunosuppressant, may result in greater myelosuppression compared to mycophenolate mofetil [14] . Sirolimus and calcineurin inhibitors such as tacrolimus and cyclosporine have been shown in renal and lung transplant recipients to cause hemolytic anemia, thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura, and atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome [15] [16] [17] . The calcineurin inhibitors have been shown to cause anemia ranging from 1% to 5% in European trials to 38-47% in US trial [18] . The antimetabolite azathioprine, a purine-analog drug, can also cause cytopenias. Mycophenolate mofetil, tacrolimus, azathioprine, and anti-thymocyte globulin have all shown to cause pure red cell aplasia [19, 20] .",

Leukopenia is commonly seen after solid organ transplantation and can be caused by noninfectious and infectious etiologies. It can signal an underlying infection or disease process, such as posttransplant lymphoproliferative disorder (PTLD). It also increases the risk of developing further complications such as opportunistic infection and can require reduction of immunosuppression, increasing the risk of graft rejection. While there is no data to suggest a clear independent relationship between leukopenia and graft rejection, the complications of leukopenia mentioned above provide ample reason to investigate the etiology of the decreased white cell count. Solid organ transplant recipients are at risk for developing infections due to their medically induced immunodeficiency following transplant, required to prevent rejection of the transplanted organ.",

While this etiology is more often identified as a drug-related phenomenon, particularly due to the immunosuppressants required to prevent organ rejection (see next section), there have been multiple case reports associating CMV infection as a trigger of TMA in the posttransplant setting [53, 54] . This has been noted with particular frequency in the renal transplant literature, where both de novo and recurrent forms of aHUS were associated with CMV infection in renal transplant recipients. However, particularly in the patients with \"de novo\" disease, it is possible that CMV may be directly driving the thrombotic microangiopathy, rather than solely by the complementmediated events of aHUS. Mechanisms thought to be underlying CMV's endothelial effects include activation of CMV-specific cytotoxic immune responses and induction of primitive endothelial dysfunction as well as direct infection of endothelial cells by CMV [55, 56] .",

Thrombocytopenia was the main adverse effect of treatment, seen in 4.7%, but did not necessitate the cessation of therapy [68] . A second study in liver transplant patients treated with linezolid for VRE infec-tion showed a similar treatment efficacy and again reported no cases (0/46 patients) requiring cessation of therapy due to severe thrombocytopenia, and furthermore found no correlation between treatment duration and platelet counts [69] though other articles advise caution when using linezolid for extended time periods [70] .

            "text": "One study reported a case series of eight patients who developed ITP following orthotopic liver transplantation (OLT), with a mean time of presentation of ITP since OLT of 5.4 years [79] . These cases were all felt to be autoimmune cases, as there was no history of ITP in the donors. This case series also presented a review of the previous literature on ITP after OLT, and they noted two distinct time patterns of ITP presentation, early (within 3 months) or late (>3 months). The authors note that it has been proposed that the earlyonset presentation may be due to passive transfer of antibodies from the donor to the recipient. Those that developed late-onset ITP were felt to have developed the antibodies independently of their donors [79] .",

One case study described a case where a donor liver was obtained from a donor who had died after a cerebral hemorrhage secondary to ITP. The recipient developed ITP within 3 days of transplant and subsequently expired after developing portal vein thrombosis. The authors attributed the death to ITP in that they were unable to anticoagulate but were providing blood products that may have resulted in increased likelihood of thrombosis. It is also possible, however, that the donor was producing procoagulant antibodies, as approximately 20-25% of patients with ITP also have antiphospholipid antibodies [81, 82] . Based on this event, the authors recommended excluding cadaveric transplants from donors whose death is attributed to ITP [80] .",

Thrombocytopenia following liver transplant can also be attributed to residual portal hypertension or hypersplenism, if either of these conditions persist following transplant.
