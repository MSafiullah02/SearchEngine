[4] \u2022 The patient (infected/suspected infected) is usually relatively easy to deal with since there are guidelines for preventing spread of infection and treating the patient for the current disease; see isolation routines. \u2022 Contacts exposed to infection are often worse to handle since it may be larger numbers of people (travel company, etc.) and because fear of being infected itself creates uncertainty. Therefore, some imaginable scenarios are made that deal with infected contacts. \u2022 Transport by ambulance. All transport of infectious patients from the place of arrival to the hospital should take place in ambulances using the same infection control regime as for the individual infectious disease (contact infection, airborne infection, strict isolation); see isolation regimes; Chaps. 14 proper use of protective equipment is used when handling such patients. The Ebola outbreak in 3 African countries in 2014 showed that almost 30,000 were registered ill, more than 11,000 died, 800 health professionals became ill and more than half of them died. Lack of use of PPE and proper infection control led to escalation of the epidemic. The staff used only 1 m distance from the patient as a zone of infection, as recommended by the WHO and CDC, and lacked protection for the head, hair and neck when within the 1 m zone and used only ordinary masks [7] [8] [9] [10] . This occurred despite the fact that Ebola is defined as a high-risk, biosafety level 4 infection in which airborne infection could be relevant [11] [12] [13] [14] . The epidemic declined from 14 September 2014, following the introduction of more proper use of personal protection equipment and infection control routines [11, 12, 15] .",
