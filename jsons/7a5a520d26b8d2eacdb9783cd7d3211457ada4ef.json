A large part of COVID-19 patients in China experienced severe complications including acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) requiring admission to intensive care unit (ICU) (Chen et al, 2020 : Zhang et al., 2020 . ARDS is a devastating condition of severe respiratory failure with 40% mortality and for which novel therapies are urgently needed (Rezoagli, et al., 2017) . It is characterized by widespread inflammation of the lungs, where extrapulmonary infections are a key aetiology of ARDS onset (Laffey et al., 2016 ) . The inflammatory insult results in lung parenchyma injury and activation of the immune system with an up-regulation of pro-inflammatory cytokines (Laffey and Matthay, 2017) . The current international standard of intervention include ventilatory management and organ support (Bellani et al., 2016) . The innate immune system plays a pivotal role in the pathophysiology of ARDS (Capelozzi et al., 2017; Chousterman et al, 2020) .",

These were characterized using an in vitro lung injury model with a focus on profiling components associated with cytokine storm.

As 10mM of H 2 O 2 , reduced cell viability by 50%, it was selected as the injuring concentration for further experiments. Cells were simultaneously treated with \uf062-glucan samples. After 24 hours of incubation, cells were complexed with annexin-VFITC conjugated antibody at 1:1000 dilution for a further 10 minutes in the dark. Cells were washed in PBS three times and resuspended in flow buffer (Miltenyl Biotech). Cells were then automatically incubated with PI using the MACS Quant analyzer. Cells from each sample were then analyzed by MACSQUANT Analyzer 10 (Miltenyl Biotech). Data was analyzed using Flowlogic software(Miltenyl Biotech) with a guide to interpretation of findings represented in Table 1 . Figure 1 . Data shows both \uf062 and alpha glucan % w/w content. CL was shown to have a significantly higher alpha glucan content. IHL was shown to have a significantly higher \uf062-glucan content and were purer and cleaner in composition. Scanning electron microscopy paired with energy dispersive x-ray analysis was carried out to determine particle size and elemental content, with results displayed in Figure 2 and Figure 3 respectively. Figure 2 , a dimensional representation of particle size, shows that CL has a uniform particle dispersity. Conversely, IHL shows a more heterogenous particle mix. Figure 3 shows that IHL contains less elements compared to CL, as sulfur, silicon and chlorine were not present in IHL. These results, paired with Megazyme results, reaffirm that IHL is a cleaner preparation with fewer constituents. in-house Lentinan suggests significant differences between the products. The 1 H spectra of the compounds are shown in Figure 5 . Previous researchers have reported that variability in \uf062-glucan chain length, branching and composition can vary based principally on source (Kaur et al., 2020) . Extraction procedures will have an effect on structure and purity of the \uf062-glucan product, which may have an effect of its bioactivity. Thus there has been an obstacle in understanding biological activities and this has hindered potential therapeutic development (Zhang et al., 2011) . Scanning electron microscopy paired with energy dispersive x-ray analysis showed that the IHL had a diverse heterogenous particle composition in comparison to CL, which had a more uniform composition. IHL was also found to have less chemical elements (sulfur, silicon and chlorine) compared to CL. These results suggest that IHL is a purer \uf062-glucan product, compared to the commercially available sample. FTIR characterization of the samples shows that both samples contain the same \uf062-glucan compound (Figure 4 ). NMR analysis contradicts this and showed that there is a significant difference between both samples (refer to supporting information) . Bak and colleagues carried out a study to measure the glucan contents in the fruiting bodies of L. edodes mushroom from various cultivars which was found to be variable based on cultivar ( Bak et al., 2014) . Gil-Ramirez and co-authors found a variance between mushroom samples based on growth conditions, degree of fruiting body maturing body as well as a difference between fresh and fruiting bodies (Gil-Ramirez et al.,",

MTT assays were preforming to ensure that cell viability was not contributing to the anti-inflammatory effects observed. Results show that both extracts did not elicit any cytotoxic effects at all concentrations, despite a trend toward a decrease in viability that was seen at the highest dose tested (10 mg/mL), but was only evident for the CL group (p = 0.096) (Fig. 6) . No statistical differences were observed for multiple comparisons of singe p-values for MTT findings, which is attributed to the broad data variability represented by large standard deviation observed (Fig. 6) . Post-hoc multiple comparisons of increasing doses of CL and IHL versus test control (0 mg/mL) were used to ensure that MTT findings were not over-stated in the assessment of preclinical data to reduce risk of false discovery. Statistical analysis data of multiple comparisons for single p-values for MTT findings are also provided in supporting information. Macrophages and monocytes recognize \uf062-glucans by various receptors present on their membrane (Vaclav et al., 2013) . This recognition will result in the secretion of cytokines (Netea et al., 2008) . Therefore, the immunomodulatory activity of the \uf062-glucan samples was analyzed, in relation to their ability to influence the secretion of cytokines from macrophages. Results demonstrated that the samples induced/suppressed cytokine release at different concentrations. For example, IHL induced the secretion of IL-6 -conversely CL suppressed it. Lentinan analyzed by previous researchers was found to increase the release of TNF-\uf061 and IL-6 ( Morales et al., 2019) . This immunomodulatory effect was also analyzed by their ability to influence the phagocytic activity of macrophages. Both samples suppressed phagocytosis after LPS insult, but CL exclusively suppressed phagocytosis in the absence of injury. Dectin-1 receptor is assumed to be one of the main receptors responsible for the recognition of \uf062-glucans. Activation of dectin-1 with 1,3-1,6 \uf062-glucans can trigger cytokine release and phagocytosis Gordon, 2001, 2005; Willment et al., 2003; Herre et al., 2004) .",

Propidium iodide (PI) in conjunction with Annexin V was used to determine if THP-1 cells wereviable, apoptotic or necrotic. Cell status was assessed based on differences in plasma membrane integrity and permeability (Vermes, et al., 2000; Farrell et al., 2011) . The results from this experiment were variable and effects were source dependent. Both CL and IHL sources at both conditions tested had the ability to increase viability after injury. CL significantly reduced early apoptosis, and IHL showed a trend to reduce early apoptosis although not significantly. Our results are in line with the findings reported by Zi and colleagues who observed that Lentinan had the ability to alleviate oxidative stress (Zi et al., 2019) . Reduction in oxidative stress by use of Lentinan is relevant to COVID-19 intervention. The renin-angiotensin (RAS) signaling pathway, oxidative stress and cell death, cytokines storm and endothelial dysfunction are four major pathways involved in the pathogenesis of COVID-19 (Kouhpayeh et al., 2020) . Therapeutic candidates that inhibit RAS and quench oxidative stress would be relevant for COVID-19.",

In this study, we investigated the effect \uf062-glucan samples had on pro and anti-inflammatory cytokine expression. Inflammatory chemokines and cytokines measured included IL-8, IL-2 and TNF-\uf061. Pleiotropic cytokines included TGF-\uf0621 and IL-6. Anti-inflammatory cytokines included IL-10 and IL-22 (Figure 9 ). LPS (100ng/mL) was also tested as it is a known inducer of inflammatory cytokines in immune cells. IHL (1mg/mL) significantly induced the J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f secretion of IL-6 and CL decreased secretion. No differences in TGF-\uf0621 concentration were observed when IHL was administered, however CL significantly reduced secretion. To maintain functional bioactivity and to increase \uf062-glucan yield, less harmful extraction processes are required that includes cessation of enzyme and harsh chemical usage as adopted using this IHL approach. Findings from this timely study highlight the putative potential for use \uf062-glucan extractions from the edible mushroom Future research is also required to study putative relationship (if any) of variation in the extraction methods producing different \uf062-glucan preparations and cytokine storm associated with COVID-19. L. edodes may also have future potential in the treatment of lung tissue repair along with informing immunotherapies for addressing COVID-19 that rely on reducing cytokine storm.",

Initial experiments showed that a dose of 10ng/mL of IL-1\uf062 gave a IL-8 release response, indicative of NF-\u03baB activation. To further examine the effects of the \uf062-glucan samples on the NF-\u03baB pathway, A549 cells stably transfected with the NF-\u03baB luciferase reporter gene were used. IL-1\uf062 stimulation caused a 6-fold increase in luciferase expression. Both \uf062-glucan samples reduced this expression, with IHL inhibiting this increase at a dose of 1mg/mL (Figure 5B). CL was able to reduce IL-1\uf062 induced NF-\u03baB pathway activation at the higher concentrations (Figure 5A). This IL-1\uf062 pulmonary model finding is directly relevant to COVID-19 as IL-1\uf062 is a prominent part of the 'cytokine storm' response(Zhang et al., 2020). Hypercytokinaemia is considered a prominent mechanism of injury in COVID-19 patients. Furthermore, there are reports of the IL-1 Ra blocker Anakinra being effective for COVID-19, where Anakinra is being tested as a potential therapy for clinical trials. There are currently no treatments directed at halting the cytokine storm and acute lung injury to stop the progression from manageable hypoxia to frank respiratory failure and ARDS in patients with COVID-19 infection. Preventing progression from early acute hypoxia and cytokine release syndrome to frank hypoxic respiratory failure and ARDS could have a huge impact on the foreseeable overflow of the ICU units (https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04330638). The aforementioned reported that in ventilated patients, preventing the onset of ARDS, or shortening ICU stay could also be crucial in this regard. Furthermore, the clinical status after 15 days treatment was evaluated to measure the effectiveness of tocilizumab, tocilizumab and anakinra, siltuximab, siltuximab and anakinra and anakinra on restoring lung homeostasis, using single IV injection (siltuximab or tocilizumab) combined or not with daily subcutaneous injections of anakinra until 28 days or hospital discharge, whichever is first.

When compared to a commercial source of the same mushroom, the in-house Lentinan extract contained higher levels of \uf062-glucan and lower levels of \uf061-glucan. Both Lentinan products reduced inflammation in a lung epithelial model, and IHL achieved this effect at lower doses. Physicochemical found important differences in the composition of the Lentinan extracts, as determined by SEM, ATR-FTIR, and NMR, with the CL exhibiting higher amounts of alpha-glucans and correspondingly less \uf062-glucans. The two Lentinan extracts demonstrated varying immunomodulatory activities. Both Lentinan extracts reduced cytokine induced NF-\u03baB activation in human alveolar epithelial A549 cells, with the IHL extract proving more effective at lower doses. In contract, in activated THP-1 derived macrophages, the CL extract more effectively attenuated pro-inflammatory cytokine production (TNF-\uf061, IL-8, IL-2, IL-6, IL-22). The CL extract attenuated oxidative stress induced early apoptosis, while the IHL extract attenuated late apoptosis. Implications of these findings infers that defining a reliable and repeatable source of \uf062-glucan where processes can be tailored to control chain lengths may potentially reduce key cytokines involved in g cytokine storm experienced in severe cases of COVID-19. In the future, \uf062-glucans may be delivered as a tailored cocktail matched against critical time-points in the form of future nutraceutical-based intervention for tackling COVID-19. Such \uf062-glucans immunomodulatory cocktails may also have adjacent applications for addressing ARDS that is an important event seen with sepsis. These purified \uf062-glucan combinational cocktails may be produced on a large commercial scale using bioreactors for global deployment Tafuek et al., 2020).",
