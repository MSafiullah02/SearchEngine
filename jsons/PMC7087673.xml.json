            "text": "During an epidemic, there are several options available to private individuals interested in managing infectious disease risk. These include self-quarantine, vaccination, voluntary travel restrictions, contact reduction, prophylaxis, and preferential mixing (Philipson 1996; Geoffard and Philipson 1997; Philipson 2000; Taylor and Ampt 2003; Brownstein et al. 2006; Ferguson et al. 2006; Germann et al. 2006; Hunter 2007; Rao et al. 2009; Curtis et al. 2011; Fenichel et al. 2013). The choice of which measures to use frequently depends on costs\u2014the cost of illness and the cost of risk mitigation. The cost of illness is determined by the likelihood that people will become infected if they make contact with an infectious individual, together with the cost of treatment and loss of earnings if they do become infected. The cost of risk mitigation is the resources sacrificed to reduce risk by some amount. Diseases that are perceived to be highly infectious and life-threatening warrant greater private risk mitigation effort than diseases that are perceived to be only moderately infectious and with few symptoms (Sanchez 2001; Leroy et al. 2005; Team 2014). Diseases that are novel, and therefore uncertain in their effects, warrant greater private risk mitigation effort than diseases that are more familiar (Taylor et al. 2001; Presanis et al. 2009; Rubin et al. 2009). It follows that private risk mitigation efforts might be expected to evolve over the course of an epidemic as information improves. A number of studies have, for example, tracked changes in the efforts made by private individuals to reduce disease risk during the 2009 A/H1N1 epidemic (Fenichel et al. 2013; Bayham et al. 2015; Springborn et al. 2015).",

People vaccinating themselves against seasonal influenza, for example, reduce the likelihood that they will become infected, but also reduce the likelihood that they will become infectious. Vaccination, in such cases, is said to be an impure public good. It confers benefits on the individual, but also on those with whom the individual interacts (Sandler et al. 2002). On the other hand, people avoiding infection now by sequestering themselves may simply delay the moment at which they become infected and infectious and hence may unwittingly prolong an epidemic (Fenichel et al. 2011). Private disease-risk mitigation, in this case, is an impure public bad. In providing benefits to the individual, it imposes costs on society. Because people cannot capture any wider benefits they confer, and are not confronted by any wider costs they impose, they have little incentive to take those benefits and costs into account when making their decisions. The public good (bad) is therefore under-provided (over-provided).",

These are not, however, the only options available. Since private disease risk mitigation efforts reflect the costs of illness and illness avoidance, interventions that change those costs are also among the options available to public health authorities (Perrings et al. 2014). In this paper, we consider policy instruments that close the gap between the socially and privately optimal levels of disease risk mitigation. Such policy instruments align the socially and privately efficient solutions by aligning the social and private cost of disease-risk mitigation. We assume private disease-risk mitigation strategies similar to Morin et al. (2015) and consider a control that operates on the cost of illness. This has parallels with the health belief model originally developed in the 1950s, which supposes that private health-risk mitigation depends on beliefs about the likelihood and consequences of contracting disease, the efficacy and costs of the proposed action, and the decision makers\u2019 capacity to implement the action (Rosenstock 1974).",

The two most common approaches to the management of disease risk are mitigation and adaptation. Mitigation implies an action that reduces the probability that the individual will fall ill. Adaptation implies an action that has no effect on the probability that the individual will fall ill, but reduces the cost of illness. The probability that an infection will occur, c\u03b2P\nSI(\u03d5(t)), depends on three things: contact volume c, the probability that contact results in infection \u03b2, and the probability that contacts are with infectious individuals P\nSI(\u03d5(t)), a function of mitigation effort \u03d5(t). We treat the first two of these parametrically, although we acknowledge that they may be affected by, respectively, strategies to quarantine infectious individuals or to reduce activity levels (Fenichel et al. 2011), and strategies such as prophylaxis or vaccination (Weycker et al. 2005). We focus instead on the probability that contact will be made with infectious individuals. It was shown in Fenichel et al. (2013) that despite travel restrictions during the H1N1 swine flu outbreak, individuals did not cancel travel plans (reduce contact volume) so much as alter the timing of their travel. In previous work, we have shown the equivalence of private strategies targeting c or P\nSI (Morin et al. 2014) and have identified the social costs and benefits of private strategies that alter disease trajectories (Morin et al. 2015). In this paper, we study the impact of changes in the private cost of illness on mitigation effort, and show how diseases with the same R\n0 can trigger very different interventions, depending on which parameter drives the basic reproduction number.",

Individuals who believe themselves to be susceptible may include those in states S, E, and A. We further assume the motivation for selective mixing is the desire to avoid the costs of illness only.

(1), Table 3 The H\u2013J\u2013B equation identifies the problem solved by the representative individual in state i: to maximize the expected net value of current and future contacts by choosing the extent to which they mix with individuals in other health classes. Following Fenichel et al. (2011), we assume that individuals form their expectations adaptively. The value function V\ni(t, H(t)) is defined recursively as the sum of the current net benefits of contact in health state i given the information available at time t plus the discounted stream of expected net benefits over the remaining horizon. This expectation is conditional on the effects of disease risk mitigation decisions on the probability of transitioning between health states. More particularly, we assume individuals observe the state of an epidemic at time t and make a forecast for the epidemiological trajectory over the interval \u03c4. Their mixing strategies are then adapted over time as they make new observations on the state of the epidemic. We assume that individuals make the simplest forecast\u2014that all disease classes are constant over the interval \u03c4, but that they adapt to new data as it emerges.",

In models without risk mitigation, disease dynamics may be completely characterized from initial conditions.

            "text": "To solve the problem, we take a discrete time counterpart to Eq. (2) and solve numerically using techniques similar to those in Fenichel et al. (2011). Specifically, we solve the adaptive expectation problem using a method we call Cast-Recast. At each time, the individual solves the H\u2013J\u2013B equation using backwards induction from their time horizon (12 days) to the present, while supposing that there is no change to the state variables over the time horizon. Having determined the optimal mitigation effort, \u03d5\nij(t), the individual commits that effort until the next time step (day). That is, their mitigation effort is held constant for 1 time step. The ordinary differential equations describing the disease dynamics are advanced, and the process is repeated. Note that the private forecast used has little effect on the optimal outcomes so long as the forecast period, the time interval \u03c4, is short relative to the disease dynamics. If the epidemic evolves rapidly relative to the period over which the individual commits to a fixed level of risk mitigation, then the assumption that the disease states are constant may induce errors. In previous work using this method (Fenichel et al. 2011; Morin et al. 2013, 2014, 2015), we found a smooth response\u2014the decisions made by individuals were much the same from day to day. Since the epidemic evolves on a timescale of weeks, this gives us confidence in the Cast-Recast method for the private problem. In the discussion, we outline when the results from such a method may favor more rapid transmission of epidemiological state variables, and when individual behavior choices need to be more \u201cagile\u201d in order to match timescales with the disease spread.",

However, as was shown in Morin et al. (2015) this may well be publically suboptimal, depending on the social rate of discount or the social cost of illness. The social cost of illness is the sum of the costs borne by all infected and symptomatic individuals, together with the cost of disease avoidance by all others. In a real system, it would also include the infection risk borne by healthcare workers, but we do not address that here. Of the many intervention options open to public health authorities\u2014quarantine, social distancing measures such as school closures, vaccination campaigns and so on\u2014we focus on instruments that change risk mitigation by changing the private cost of illness. In doing this, we follow a literature that integrates epidemiology and economics to explore ways in which economic behavior affects disease spread (Perrings et al. 2014). This literature has concentrated on the economic causes and epidemiological consequences of peoples\u2019 contact decisions (Gersovitz and Hammer 2003, 2004; Barrett and Hoel 2007; Funk et al. 2009; Fenichel et al. 2010; Funk et al. 2010; Springborn et al. 2010).

This would be consistent with, for example, mandatory insurance cover for a specific proportion of potentially forgone earnings. Our baseline case assumes that the policy instrument is revenue neutral. If r\nD < 0 (illness is subsidized), the cost is met by a levy on all income from contacts. If r\nD > 0 (illness is taxed), the revenue is returned as a tax benefit on all income from contacts.

On the one hand, it unnecessarily increases the aggregate cost of mitigation since exposed individuals continue to mitigate, even though they there is no need. On the other hand, by driving up P\nSE and reducing P\nSI, exposed individuals reduce infection rates below those that would occur if only susceptible individuals mitigated risk. That is, the risk mitigation undertaken by exposed individuals confers an external benefit on society. The result is that public health authority intervention in the SEIR case increases private risk mitigation for all but the most severe diseases (i.e., for all R\n0 \u2264 3.25) (Fig. 4). We also note that the basic reproduction number for the SEIR model is identical to that for the SIR model and does not involve the latent period. Over reasonable latent periods from 3 to 14 days, we found an increase in the \u2018tax\u2019 rate applied by the public health authority, but no switching or nonlinearities in behavioral response.\n",

            "text": "The central proposition of this paper is that since disease-risk mitigation is a function of the private cost of disease, it can be managed through changes in the private cost of disease. Whether private disease-risk mitigation is above or below the socially optimal level of mitigation, there exist interventions that have the potential to align private choices with the interests of society. Our numerical results on the difference between the privately and socially optimal mitigation reflect the specific assumptions made about the relative cost of disease and disease avoidance. These were selected to illustrate the range of potential responses and the sensitivity of responses to disease characteristics. Given our cost assumptions, we find that for SIR diseases individuals confronted with highly infectious illnesses of long duration overreact to the associated risks. They mitigate more than is socially optimal. Conversely, individuals confronted with short illnesses of low infectiousness underreact. For SEIR diseases, on the other hand, the privately optimal level of disease-risk mitigation is less than the socially optimal level for almost all parameter values. The gap between privately and socially optimal investments in risk mitigation is partly due to the fact that private individuals base their risk mitigation decisions on the observed health state of others\u2014whether or not others are symptom-free. This is a source of error that is greater in some cases (SEIR, two-path SAIR) than others (SIR, one-path SAIR). It is also due to the epidemiological effects of actions that influence when a susceptible person becomes infected in the course of an epidemic. One of the main external effects of private disease-risk mitigation is the prolongation of epidemics and with it the cost of disease-risk mitigation.",

It can, by the way, be shown that subsidies or taxes on the cost of mitigation rather than the cost of illness have similar effects. For any adjustment to the cost of illness, there exists an adjustment to the cost of mitigation that produces the same private response. It does not follow, however, that the two instruments are equally efficient. Adjusting the cost of illness alters \u2018severity\u2019 in the language of the health belief model while adjusting the cost of mitigation alters \u2018barriers.\u2019 Which is the more cost-effective in any real application would depend on the effort needed to achieve the desired epidemiological effect and the relative cost of effort in each case.",

            "text": "Within the SIR model, each individual has perfect information on their infection state and all relevant information on others (infectious or not). The other three models each introduce error due to the existence of asymptomatic classes. They also introduce changes in disease dynamics that affect the socially optimal level of risk mitigation. Whether it is socially optimal to intervene in ways that increase or decrease private disease risk mitigation depends on the effect of mitigation on the time profile of infections. The point has already been made that mitigation reduces peak prevalence but also prolongs epidemics. When the additional cost of the longer (and potentially fatter) tail of an epidemic outweighs the benefits offered by a reduction in peak prevalence, the PHA will intervene to reduce private risk mitigation\u2014and vice versa (as shown in Fig. 5).\nThe advantages of instruments that operate on the cost of illness are that they can be put in place in advance of an outbreak and that they operate automatically. Disease-specific insurance or treatment costs, for example, can be established in advance but only influence private decisions when an outbreak occurs. We have not considered particular instruments in this paper and note only that the effect of each depends on how it would impact the relative costs and benefits of mitigation actions. There is a range of cost-based instruments that could be applied to diseases whose properties are well understood. The instruments that should be applied to specific diseases are those expected to cost effectively close the gap between socially and privately optimal disease risk mitigation. While we consider only policy instruments determined in advance of an epidemic\u2014i.e., that correspond to the known properties of known diseases\u2014we acknowledge that this would not be reasonable in the case of novel or emerging infectious diseases. There is less scope for the use of incentives of this type in such cases, but it would be worth considering how the choice of r\nD might evolve during the course of an epidemic in future work.",

It would make some people better off and some people worse off. We have abstracted from any distributional consequences in this paper by treating all individuals in each disease class as homogeneous, and by assuming that the payoff to contact is the same for everybody. Implementation of a policy instrument of this kind in a real system would, however, need to take account of the distributional goals of the society concerned. Infectious diseases are a comparatively small part of the burden of disease in high-income countries, but still the largest part of the disease burden in low-income countries. This is precisely where distributional issues are of greatest concern and where individuals are least able to bear the cost of disease-risk avoidance.",
