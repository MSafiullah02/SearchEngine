Specifically, total sleep time was reduced an average of 23 min/night and consolidated sleep was reduced by an average of 36 min/night during the active phase of the illness. It should be emphasized that while these reductions would not be considered substantial when experienced on an acute and intermittent basis, a significant sleep debt may accumulate following lengthy bouts of illness. Although no previous data are available regarding polysomnographically recorded sleep during cold illnesses, these results are in accord with previous findings that have demonstrated decreased psychomotor performance in individuals with experimentally induced colds [2], [8], [10], [14], [15].",

Although items specifically related to ease of falling asleep were not assessed in previous studies, total sleep time has been reported to increase during the active phase of the illness [10].

However, one study has shown that performance impairments can be present in subclinically infected individuals who are not experiencing significant symptoms [15]. This apparent incongruity in findings may be related to differences in task sensitivity as several of the performance measures in the present study were unaffected by the rhinovirus challenge. Specifically, lengthy monotonous tasks (i.e., simple reaction time, auditory vigilance) may be more sensitive to the effects of minor reductions in sleep duration while more complex tasks requiring multiple response modalities and increased cognitive effort may be less sensitive to these effects due to their inherent \u201cactivating\u201d nature. That is, certain tasks may themselves be activating and thereby \u201cmask\u201d sleepiness that may otherwise have been detected. In one study, impairment was detected in asymptomatic individuals on a five-choice reaction time task but not on a more complex detection task [15]. Similarly, in the present study, impairments were detected on a minimally complex vigilance task but not on a more complex divided attention task. Although it appears unlikely, it may be argued that an even more sensitive task may have enabled detection of impairments in asymptomatic individuals in the present study. Additional studies using a wider range of cognitive tasks are necessary before more definitive conclusions can be made.",

While previous findings of performance impairment were replicated, the effects on sleep were modest, and no effect on daytime sleepiness was found. Thus, while lack of sleep cannot be ruled out as a mediator of the performance impairment, it is unlikely given the absence of an effect on daytime sleepiness. The correlation between \u201ccough\u201d and MSLT latency suggests another possible explanation that the symptoms themselves may have inhibited sleep onset on the MSLT. While this is not likely given the lack of consistent relationships between sleep latency on the MSLT and symptomatology, the tendency for symptomatic individuals to report increased nocturnal sleep latencies suggests that this possibility cannot be eliminated. Longer studies that evaluate more severe viral infections may show effects on daytime sleepiness.",
