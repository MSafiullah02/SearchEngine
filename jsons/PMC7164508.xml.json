            "text": "The type III intermediate filament (IF) proteins vimentin and desmin are present in airway smooth muscle cells/tissues. However, vimentin is a predominant IF protein in airway smooth muscle; the protein ratio of vimentin to desmin is 6:1 [1]. Vimentin exists in the form of a filamentous structure emanating from the nucleus and connecting to the desmosome on the membrane. At the desmosome, vimentin filaments interact with the linker proteins such as plakoglobin, plakophilin, and desmoplakin, which in turn connects with the cytoplasmic tails of desmosomal cadherins (desmocollin and desmoglein). The extracellular domains of desmocollin and desmoglein connect with their counterparts in adjacent cells to form the cell\u2013cell junction (Fig. 1) [2]. Additionally, another end of vimentin filaments attaches to the cytoplasmic dense bodies to which actin filaments also connect. Thus, the vimentin network may facilitate intercellular and intracellular mechanical transmission. Furthermore, desmin is primarily localized in the peripheral of airway smooth muscle cells, which may strengthen the connection of vimentin filaments to the membrane [1,3,4]. In contrast, actin filaments of smooth muscle link to membrane-associated dense plaques, which include integrins and linker proteins, and engage with the extracellular matrix (ECM) (Fig. 1). A detailed structure of membrane-associated dense plaques (also called the integrin-associated complex) has been described elsewhere [5]. The membrane-associated dense plaques play a role in force transmission between the contractile units and the ECM [5\u20139].",

            "text": "Smooth muscle tension and contraction play an essential role in regulating functions of pulmonary and cardiovascular systems such as airway tone and blood pressure. There is an accumulating evidence to suggest an important role for vimentin filaments in controlling mechanical properties of smooth muscle. Vimentin knockout does not affect mouse viability and reproductivity; however, flow-induced dilation in mesenteric resistance arteries was reduced in vimentin knockout mice [10]. Moreover, vimentin depletion by antisense oligonucleotides inhibits smooth muscle contraction during agonist activation [4]. Vimentin-mediated contraction is not orchestrated by contractile protein activation because myosin light chain phosphorylation is not affected by vimentin depletion [1,3,4]. The structure of desmosomes is also disrupted in vimentin-deficient tissues as evidenced by the immunostaining of plakoglobin, a major component of desmosomes [1,3,4]. Thus, vimentin filaments facilitate smooth muscle contraction by stabilizing intercellular and intracellular mechanical transmission [1\u20133,11]. The vimentin network also affects the mechanical stability of nonmuscle cells. Fibroblasts from vimentin \u2013/\u2013 mice display reduced stiffness, mechanical stability, and contraction [12]. Disruption of the vimentin network by withaferin-A reduces stiffness of NK cells [13]. However, the information regarding the role of the vimentin network in other airway smooth muscle biophysical properties (e.g., stiffness and traction force) is lacking.",

Contractile activation induces vimentin phosphorylation at Ser-56 and reorientation of the vimentin framework in smooth muscle [1,3,15,16]. Vimentin phosphorylation at this residue influences the reorganization of the vimentin network. Introduction of a nonphosphorylatable S56A vimentin inhibits vimentin cytoskeletal remodeling and smooth muscle contraction [1,3,4,11,15]. Because vimentin filaments connect with the desmosome and dense bodies, reorganization of the vimentin network may strengthen the intercellular mechanical transmission and optimize arrangement of contractile elements, which may promote force development [1,11]. In addition, vimentin phosphorylation at Ser-56 regulates the endothelial barrier function, which is associated with cell contraction. Disruption of vimentin filaments by withaferin A or introduction of the nonphosphorylatable vimentin mutant S56A impairs the barrier function of endothelial cells [17].",

            "text": "The vimentin cytoskeleton also harbors certain signaling partners such as a p130 Crk-associated substrate (p130CAS) in smooth muscle [3,15,18]. p130CAS is an adapter protein that promotes actin dynamics and smooth muscle contraction by activating N-WASP [19,20] and profilin-1 [21]. Phosphorylation of vimentin at Ser-56 leads to the dissociation of p130CAS from the vimentin cytoskeleton during contractile activation [3,15]. Expression of S56A vimentin inhibits the dissociation of p130CAS from cytoskeletal vimentin [15]. Moreover, p21-activated kinase 1 (PAK1) can mediate vimentin phosphorylation at Ser-56 in smooth muscle [3,22] (see below). PAK1 depletion by antisense oligodeoxynucleotides attenuates the agonist-induced release of p130CAS from the vimentin cytoskeleton [1,3]. Thus, it has been proposed that the vimentin cytoskeleton regulates actin cytoskeleton reorganization by modulating vimentin phosphorylation-dependent p130CAS release; the released p130CAS translocates to the plasma membrane to facilitate cortical actin polymerization, which promotes the transmission of contractile force to the ECM as well as cadherin-medicated intercellular mechanical transmission and smooth muscle contraction [1,3,5,15,23].",

            "text": "The upstream molecules for activating PAK1 in smooth muscle have been also identified. They are Cdc42 (one of small GTPases), Cdc42GAP (GTPase activating protein), reactive oxygen species (ROS), and NAD(P)H oxidase. The small GTPase can bind to the p21-binding domain of PAK, which induces conformational changes and activates the kinase through autophosphorylation at Thr-423 [1,3,5,15,31]. Cdc42 is regulated by Cdc42GAP that specifically inhibits the activity of Cdc42 [22]. Contractile activation inhibits the activity of Cdc42GAP in smooth muscle. There is also evidence to suggest that ROS regulates the activity of Cdc42GAP. The addition of ROS inhibits the activation of Cdc42GAP in smooth muscle cells. Moreover, knockdown of p47phox (a regulatory subunit of NAD(P)H oxidase) by shRNA blocks ROS production and disinhibits the GAP protein. The disinhibition of Cdc42GAP can be rescued by the addition of hydrogen peroxide. Cdc42 activity, PAK1 phosphorylation, vimentin phosphorylation, and smooth muscle contraction were reduced by p47phox knockdown [5,6,22,32]. Together, these studies discover a novel pathway for the regulation of the vimentin network. Contractile activation increases the activity of NAD(P)H oxidase, which promotes the production of intracellular ROS. ROS can inhibit the activity of Cdc42GAP, which subsequently induces Cdc42, PAK1, and vimentin phosphorylation and reorganization [5,6,22,32] (Fig. 2).",

Knockdown of Plk1 by lentivirus-mediated shRNA inhibits vimentin phosphorylation and the contraction of human airway smooth muscle upon agonist stimulation [11]. Contractile stimulation enhances the phosphorylation and activation of Plk1 in airway smooth muscle, as evidenced by immunoblotting and a biosensor [11]. Furthermore, Plk1 phosphorylation is catalyzed by Ste20-like kinase (SLK). Thus, a new pathway for the regulation of vimentin phosphorylation has been proposed: Upon contractile stimulation, SLK activates Plk1 through phosphorylation at Thr-210. Activated Plk1 in turn phosphorylates vimentin at Ser-56 and causes intracellular/intercellular force transmission and smooth muscle contraction (Fig. 2).",

This raises the possibility that vimentin filaments may regulate focal adhesion dynamics directly and thus cell migration. The interaction of vimentin filaments with focal adhesions is regulated by its phosphorylation at Ser-56, which is coordinated by the miR-509-Plk1 pathway. Exposure of human airway smooth muscle cells to miR-509 reduces the expression of Plk1, which diminishes vimentin phosphorylation at Ser-56 and the connection of vimentin filaments with paxillin. Moreover, focal adhesion size and cell migration are reduced by miR-509. Thus, miR-509 modulates vimentin phosphorylation, vimentin framework reorganization, focal adhesion dynamics, and smooth muscle cell migration by controlling Plk1 expression. Physical connection of vimentin filaments with focal adhesions may promote the activation of focal adhesion kinase and focal adhesion dynamics [40]. Interestingly, the expression of miR-509 is reduced in asthmatic human airway smooth muscle cells. This is encouraging because lower miR-509 expression may contribute to increased airway smooth muscle cell migration, which is involved in airway remodeling in asthma [39].",

Vimentin phosphorylation at Ser-56 by PAK1 and Plk1 leads to its partial disassembly in smooth muscle, which results in the release of p130CAS from cytoskeletal vimentin. p130CAS translocates to the cell cortex and promotes the Arp2/3 complex-mediated actin polymerization and branching and lamellipodial formation [1,3,6,11,15,18,43,44]. In addition, caldesmon is a component of thin filaments in smooth muscle cells. Caldesmon interacts with intermediate filaments and polymerized actin and is required for maintaining the intermediate filament network and actin filaments in smooth muscle cells [45]. Caldesmon phosphorylation by the serine/threonine protein kinase PFTAIRE1 promotes its binding to F-actin and stress fiber formation in motile cells [30]. Furthermore, CARMIL2 (capping protein, Arp2/3, myosin-I linker 2) is a molecule that regulates the activity of capping protein. During migration, dynamic vimentin filaments target CARMIL2 to the cell cortex, where CARMIL2 modulates the capping protein activity and increases local actin filament assembly and protrusion formation [46].",
