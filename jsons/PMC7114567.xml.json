Unlike the enteric canine coronavirus (CCoV) belonging to the alphacoronavirus genus, CRCoV is associated with mild to severe respiratory signs and proposed as an etiological agent of canine infectious respiratory disease (CIRD) (Buonavoglia and Martella, 2007). CRCoV was first detected in 2003 by RT-PCR in the UK from dogs suffering from severe respiratory disease (Erles et al., 2003). Later, the CRCoV-4182 strain was successfully isolated from a dog with respiratory signs and was cultured in the HRT-18 cell line (Erles et al., 2007). To date, data have been made publicly available for only one complete genomic sequence (CRCoV-K37 strain), which was isolated from a South Korea dog (An et al., 2010, Lim et al., 2013).",

Meanwhile, HCoV-OC43 may have emerged after viral transmission from cattle to people (Vijgen et al., 2005). The high nucleotide identity between CRCoV and BCoV, HCoV-OC43 and HECoV indicated that the four viruses have a common ancestor (Erles and Brownlie, 2008), and demonstrated the occurrence of repeated host-species shifts (Vijgen et al., 2006). Although CRCoV strains are frequently circulating in farmed and pet dogs worldwide (Erles and Brownlie, 2005, Kaneshima et al., 2006, Priestnall et al., 2006, Priestnall et al., 2007, Yachi and Mochizuki, 2006), causing respiratory disease, little is known about their genomic evolution and recombination. In the present study, we sequenced and analyzed the first complete genome of CRCoV derived from China (CRCoV-BJ232 strain) and discuss its role in CRCoV evolution.",

The CRCoV-BJ232 genome isolated in China was found to have 30,868 nucleotides and showed a genomic organization that was highly similar to the Betacoronavirus 1species: 5\u2032-UTR(nt 1\u2013143),ORF1ab (nt 144\u201321427), ORF2 (nt 21437\u201322273), HE gene (nt 22285\u201323559), S gene (nt 23574\u201327665),E gene (nt 28355\u201328609), M gene (nt 28624\u201329316), N gene (nt 29326\u201330672), and 3\u2032-UTR (nt 30673\u201330868).

Moreover, the latter four viruses clustered together with high branch bootstrap values (Fig. 1B). To investigate the genetic relationships among the Betacoronavirus 1 species, we generated phylogenetic trees based on the sequences oforf1ab, S, M and N genes (Fig. 2\n). Phylogenetic analysis based on different genes consistently show that CRCoV BJ232 is most closely related to HCoV-OC43, forming a separate clade of CRCoV that split off early from other Betacoronavirus 1. However, CRCoV-K37 strain closely clustered with CRCoV-BJ232 strain in S gene, and was more related to BCoV strain Quebec (AF220295.1) in the region of orf1ab, M and N genes. The major genes of the CRCoV-BJ232 strain showed a consistent trend in the evolution, while the phylogenetic topology conflicted in the sub-regions of CRCoV strain K37, especially in the S and orf1ab genes. These findings are consistent with recombination, a phenomenon not uncommon in coronaviruses, implying that the CRCoV K37 strain may have arisen from genetic recombination.",
