Although determining cost effectiveness may be viewed as a somewhat \"heartless utilitarian\" process, it is essentially concerned with fair use of scarce resources. However, this can be hard to apply when rescuing people in emergency situations, which leads Appleby to raise the question \"does cost effectiveness even have a role when it comes to covid-19 \u2212 undeniably an emergency?\".",

To provide context, the total number of deaths in 2018 in the UK was 616 000.",

Economic as well as health and healthcare components will contribute to the costs, with opportunity costs including mortality and morbidity from non-COVID-19 conditions due to reduced or delayed health services. Indicative figures from the UK Office for National Statistics suggests there were 6082 more all-cause deaths in the week ending 3 April 2020 for England and Wales compared with the five-year average for this week, compared with 3475 deaths from COVID-19 in this period, although how many of the \"excess\" deaths are a result of COVID-19 interventions or changes in healthcare-seeking behaviour remains to be seen.",

            "text": "The US has early estimates suggesting a net benefit of isolation and social distancing compared with the negative impact on the economy, although these are largely uncertain. However, the balance of cost-benefit could change depending on multiple factors such as extra tests, more ventilators, increased personal protective equipment and vaccine development. Appleby concludes that for now, given the nature of the pandemic, \"we shouldn't base any decisions about doing something versus doing nothing on the results of inevitably imperfect and premature analysis of the costs and benefits\".",
