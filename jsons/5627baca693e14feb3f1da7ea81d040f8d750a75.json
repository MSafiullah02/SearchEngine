The control takes the form of a multiplicative reduction in the contact rate of infectious individuals. The control is allowed to be applied only over a finite time interval, while the objective is to minimize the total number of individuals infected in the long-time limit, subject to some cost function for the control. We first consider the nocost scenario and analytically determine the optimal control and solution. We then study solutions when a cost of intervention is included. Finally, we consider an objective based on flattening the curve in order to avoid overwhelming the available medical resources.",

Herein we assume a vaccine is unavailable, so that herd immunity can only be achieved through infection and recovery.

Optimal control in the SIR model with vaccination has been studied in [7] . Optimal control for an extended SIR model, based on quarantining and isolation of confirmed or suspected cases was studied in [13] . A review of work on optimal control in epidemiology is presented in [11] , along with the formulation of the optimal control solution (based on Pontryagin's maximum principle) for several extensions of the SIR model. The effect of quarantine or NPI can also be studied through more detailed compartmental models that include compartments for quarantined individuals, as has been done for instance in [10, 1] , or with sophisticated models incorporating spatial spread and human networks; see e.g. [2] .",

In order to understand the effects of NPIs imposed on an entire population, we stick to the simple model (3) rather than explicitly modeling quarantined individuals. Since such population-wide measures cannot be maintained indefinitely, we invoke the finite-time control assumption (4). This assumption is not new (see e.g. [3] ), but unlike previous works our objective function is still based on the long-term outcome (rather than the outcome at time T ). This drastically changes the nature of optimal solutions. In the last section of this work we also consider the goal of avoiding hospital overflow (through flattening the curve).",

First, observe that the optimal solutions obtained here, based on x \u221e , are drastically different than those that would be obtained if the objective were to maximize x(T ). In the latter case, an optimal strategy over short times is to apply very strong control from the outset. But the longterm outcome of such a strategy, if intervention cannot be maintained forever, is simply to delay the epidemic. This has been borne out in real epidemics. A study of the 1918 influenza pandemic found no statistically significant correlation between interventions and the eventual death toll in US cities [5] . In simple terms, flattening the curve also broadens the curve and may not have a substantial impact on the area under the curve. Real-world application of the strategies derived here would require precise knowledge of the disease parameters, the current state of the population, and the quantitative effect of specific NPIs, none of which are readily available (or indeed capable of being characterized by a single number). Nevertheless, the general results obtained here provide insight into what optimal intervention strategies and their consequences may look like.",
