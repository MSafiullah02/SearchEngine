Epidemiology is the study of the process of the origin and spread of transmissible (communicable) infectious diseases of man, and their control. The modern conception of epidemiology is broader in that it also includes non-infectious diseases (such as diabetes, heart attack, cardiovascular diseases and carcinomas) and variables that influence their distribution in the human population. In both the classical and modern conception of epidemiology, these factors include variables concerning the host (age, sex, nutrition, occupation), the agent (virulence, antigenic variability), and the environment (chemical factors, contamination, emissions, temperature, precipitation and humidity, illumination, ionising radiation, noise etc.). Epidemiological data are then analysed, and the results of these studies can then be used for the prevention and control of these human diseases. Epizootiology is characterized analogically but relates to animal diseases. In general, these two disciplines should not be differentiated; already Rudolf Virchow in the middle of nineteenth century wrote: \"Zwischen Tier-und Menschenarzneikunde ist oder sollte wissenschaftlich keine Scheidengrenze sein\". This is in line with the present approach called \"One Medicine, One Health Concept\" (including epidemiology). However, there are some additional characteristics specific for the \"epizootiology\", such as, for example, turnover of the animal population (herd), hygienic parameters of breeding, or methods of control of animal diseases including zoonoses (culling of groups or whole herds affected with dangerous diseases).",

According to qualified estimates, every year about half a billion birds migrate from Europe to Africa and back, and a part of them are infested with ticks. Hoogstraal and Kaiser examined 1826 birds during their northward migration in Egypt in the springs of 1960 and 1962: ixodid ticks were found on 10% individuals (about 90% of the ticks were the African subspecies Hyalomma marginatum rufipes). African ticks were also observed on birds in Bulgaria (Amblyomma variegatum, A. hebraeum) and in Azerbaijan (A. lepidum), and Hyalomma marginatum sporadically in Czechland and Finland. Imagoes of African ticks A. variegatum, A. hebraeum and A. gemma were detected on domestic animals in southern Europe (Italy, France, Bulgaria, Crimea) as a consequence of importation of their larval stages with birds. A majority of these exotic ticks cannot finish their developmental cycle under environmental conditions in Europe, but some of them could theoretically infect local vertebrate hosts and give an origin for new natural foci of infections. In addition to birds, also some bats migrate for longer distances (e.g., Miniopterus schreibersii). Further, even insect vectors can be imported with air currents under specific meteorological conditions (e.g. biting midges Culicoides infected with veterinary important arboviruses bluetongue or African horse sickness).",

The idea of this doctrine is based on the fact that the aetiological agents of a number of infectious diseases circulate among free-living vertebrates and blood-sucking arthropods in nature absolutely independently of man, being an integral component of particular ecosystems. Man can acquire the disease when entering the natural focus after contact with the host or the vector of the disease, but he/she is a \"dead end\" host of the enzootic cycle. The natural foci of many diseases are closely related to specific ecosystems or biomes. For instance, foci of TBE/RSSE and HFRS (bound to taiga, and mixed forests of the mild Eurasian zone), sandfly fever and Mediterranean tick typhus (macchia ecosystem), CCHF (xerothermic pastures), cutaneous leishmaniasis and tick recurrent fever (desert and semidesert ecosystems), KFD and scrub typhus (tropical rainforest). Diseases with natural focality are in fact endemic and enzootic zoonoses or sapronoses, and their study is a sort of landscape epidemiology/epizootiology.",

The final aim of epidemiological surveillance is the control (suppression) of the disease based on knowledge of those factors determining or modifying the epidemiological or epizootiological process.",

Ser. 682, 1982) , \"epidemiological surveillance is the process of collection, interpretation, and distribution of information on rates of occurrence of a particular disease to estimate the variation of incidence and prevalence in order to take appropriate action for the control or eradication of the disease\". In short, the outline of epidemiological surveillance could be expressed as \"collection \u2192 interpretation \u2192 distribution \u2192 action.\" Distribution here means feedback of information for medical workers in the field. The content of the surveillance is: (1) exact and rapid diagnosis of the disease (clinical, pathological and laboratory, including isolation and identification of the pathogenic agent from human, animal and vector samples -see Photos 5.53-5.62); (2) meaningful use of accessible means to control the disease. For instance in zoonoses, concentration on the animal reservoir or vector would be optimal: e.g., rat extermination, vector control, or the use of baited peroral vaccines for wild animals as foxes in the case of rabies.",

Data on overpopulation (very high population densities) of vectors and hosts (especially reservoir hosts: e.g. fox and rabies, rodents in tularaemia and hantaviruses like HFRS) are epidemiologically disturbing. The rapid international exchange of epidemiological information, based on WHO, FAO and express media such as ProMED-mail (a program of the International Society for Infectious Diseases) is always of great importance. This information exchange is a part of international \"early warning\" system and makes possible the \"rapid response\" activity of epidemiologists and other components. For this purpose, there is also International Classification of Diseases (including zoonoses and sapronoses), and a list of \"notifiable (reportable) diseases\" which, however, differs among countries, i.e. certain infectious diseases are to be reported only in certain countries. In addition to national epidemiological centres and national reference laboratories, there are international institutions such as WHO, CDC in USA, or ECDC in Europe, which have available a background of expert teams and reference laboratories. For instance, many programmes concerning epidemiological surveillance of zoonoses have been established and funded by European Commission during the last decade (ENIVD, EDEN, EpiSouth, EpiNorth), others include EpiZone, GeoSentinel, CaribVET or FoodNet.",

Bioterrorism is defined as a wilful use of microorganisms or toxins from living organisms with the aim to cause disease or death in humans, animals or plants which are essential for mankind. The danger of modern terrorist attacks with microbes were demonstrated in the USA in 2001 with anthrax spores in mail (22 cases, including five fatalities). Because a number of zoonotic and sapronotic pathogens could serve for the production of bio-weapons we cannot avoid this issue. Out of zoonoses, plague, tularaemia, brucellosis, glanders, Q fever, viral haemorrhagic fevers (Ebola, Marburg, Lassa), and viral encephalitides (VEE, WN, SLE, JE) present a potential danger, and out of sapronoses mainly anthrax, Clostridium botulinum (toxin), melioidosis, cholera or coccidioidomycosis. Every new outbreak with unclear epidemiological characteristics (unusual clinical cases, indeterminate aetiology or mass outbreak) should be considered also from this perspective. Most important is an established rapid response system acting from the low level -i.e., from an adequately dense and coordinated network of human and veterinary health centres (hospitals, outpatient clinics) and diagnostic laboratories -to the rapid dissemination of information and treatment.",

Environmentally-friendly techniques of reduction of invertebrate vectors should be preferred to insecticide application. For instance in mosquitoes, the use of larvicide microbial toxin -Bacillus thuringiensis israelensis (effective against members of the genus Aedes) or B. sphericus (effective especially against Culex spp.), but also management of water level in particular areas. It is necessary to note that there is a problem with growing resistance of mosquito populations to current adulticide and some larvicide preparations (organophosphates, carbamates, pyrethroids), particularly in Africa. By analogy, interventions against rodents (rodenticides of higher generations) and other vertebrates -hosts or reservoirs of zoonotic agents -should also be environmentally friendly.
