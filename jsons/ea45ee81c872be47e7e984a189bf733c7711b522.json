Measurements and Main Results: Within 2 weeks of conception of the Society of Critical Care Medicine Discovery Network Viral Infection and Respiratory Illness Universal Study, study leadership was convened, registry case report forms were designed, electronic data entry set up, and more than 250 centers had submitted the protocol for institutional review board approval, with more than 100 cases entered. Conclusions: The Society of Critical Care Medicine Discovery Network Viral Infection and Respiratory Illness Universal Study provides an example of a rapidly deployed, international, pandemic registry that seeks to provide near real-time analytics and information regarding intensive care treatments and outcomes for patients with coronavirus disease 2019. Key Words: coronavirus disease 2019; registry T he coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has introduced unprecedented challenges to healthcare systems worldwide. Due to the effects of COVID-19 on the respiratory system, geographic areas affected by the pandemic have experienced large surges in critically ill patients who require intensive care and multiple organ system support (1, 2) . In addition, case reports of medications hypothesized to reduce viral replication or systemic inflammation have spurred widespread off-label use without the usual level of evidence that has long been accepted in modern medicine, resulting in critical shortages of medications and frequently missing the opportunity to evaluate potential benefits as well as risks of such drugs (3) . Large-scale data that enables rapid communication of patient characteristics, treatment strategies, and outcomes during a pandemic response would support nimble organizational planning and evaluation of effective critical care practices. We describe a novel ICU database rapidly designed in response to the COVID-19 pandemic to allow for near real-time data collection, analysis, and display-the multicenter, international Society of Critical Care Medicine (SCCM) Discovery Network Viral Infection and Respiratory Illness Universal Study (VIRUS).",

Remarkably, the social media platform Twitter (4) (5); daily Twitter posts advertising the importance, availability, and purpose of the registry; and word of mouth. Within 14 days of the initial Twitter post bringing together the VIRUS Leadership Team, the Consortium ~250 sites across North America, South America, East, South, and Western Asia, Africa, and Europe had submitted institutional review board (IRB) applications for participation in the registry (Fig. 1) ; Table 1 shows the number of sites reaching different landmarks to study participation during the first 2 weeks after a call for sites was announced. By week 2 after announcing the formation of the registry, data from more than 100 cases had been uploaded. The rapid enrollment of sites in the absence of external funding or support for the project is indicative of nearly universal enthusiasm across the international critical care community to collaborate across borders and silos in order to quickly learn from accumulating experience with COVID-19.",

The case report forms were adapted from the World Health Organization templates data collection forms (6), with edits to focus on an ICUspecific context.

The SCCM VIRUS Discovery Network will have a four pillar open science approach to data reporting and sharing. First, all centers have open access to their data for internal quality assurance and pilot studies. Second, summary count data will be displayed on the SCCM VIRUS website (https://www.sccm.org/Research/Research/Discovery-Research-Network/VIRUS-COVID-19-Registry) as an interactive dashboard that will provide public reporting of real-time updates with regards to case counts, ICU resource use, and outcomes. Third, with appropriate data use agreements, investigators will be able apply to use the pooled multicenter data for independent research questions. Fourth, the SCCM COVID-19 research team will identify urgent questions of clinical effectiveness, submit study protocols for independent methodological peer review, and design rigorous observational causal inference approaches (e.g., appropriate missing data methods, target trial emulation, use of directed acyclic graphs for covariate selection, quantitative sensitivity analyses [7] ) paired with data visualizations that produce real-time results displayed on the Dashboard for immediate dissemination. We seek to facilitate a timely, democratized, and crowd-sourced discovery process, similar to ICU databases such as Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care (MIMIC-III) (8) . The SCCM VIRUS Discovery Network will encourage that all research projects using Consortium data post pre-prints in noncommercial archives, further facilitating rapid-reporting of research findings necessary for nimble response to a pandemic.",

Strategies that worked to facilitate rapid progress included a strong social media presence, open communications and data harmonization with other research networks (e.g., National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute Prevention and Early Treatment of Acute Lung Injury Network), responsive IRBs that identified the critical need for rapid approval of de-identified data collection in the setting of a pandemic, use of the established database infrastructure Research Electronic Data Capture (9) for construction of harmonized case report forms, as well as an academic-professional society partnership that facilitated rapid processing of data use agreements, and early set up of a central website for communication of study materials, frequently asked questions, and standard operating procedures. Early review of literature and comparative research (10) of previous outbreaks was helpful in preparing the research resources; early reports from sentinel countries guided targeting of relevant data fields. In addition, assembly of a multidisciplinary leadership team enabled multiple stakeholder engagement and shared responsibility and mentorship across training levels. Finally, a daily reminder to focus on the goals of the database-ICU practices, physiology, and outcomes for patients with COVID-19-helped to mitigate scope creep and allow for timely completion of the data infrastructure. Strategies that may have improved the process included the use of a central IRB, funding to support local data entry, and a preexisting team able to \"flip the switch\" on an existing infrastructure to immediately respond to a crisis.",
