On the other hand, mortality and morbidity for liver disease have increased significantly [2].",

            "text": "Consequently, treatment of chronic hepatitis C in co-infected patients has become mandatory. Interferon in combination with ribavirin was the gold standard for treatment of chronic hepatitis C in HIV-uninfected patients, inducing a 40% rate of sustained response [3]. However, a cumulative sustained virological response (SVR) was observed in only 22% (95% Confidence interval (CI), 14\u201330%) of 111 patients enrolled in four pilot uncontrolled studies aiming to assess the efficacy and tolerability of ribavirin plus interferon alfa1 administered thrice weekly in HIV/HCV co-infected patients [4], [5], [6], [7]. So there is an urgent need for new and more effective treatment schedules for hepatitis C in HIV co-infected patients. Among patients treated with interferon alfa three times weekly an intermittent increase of HCV viral load is observed on treatment-free days [8]. Daily administration of interferon could maintain a sustained antiviral effect on HCV; this schedule is expected to increase the efficacy of interferon alfa 2. Amantadine (1-aminoamantadan) is a tricyclic amine with antiviral activity against toga-, myxo-, arena-, flavi- and coronavirus [9]. A comparative study recently demonstrated a statistically significant advantage of the addition of amantadine to interferon and ribavirin combination in HIV-uninfected patients with chronic hepatitis C and non-responders to a previous cycle of interferon monotherapy [10]. Thus addition of amantadine and intensification of interferon schedule with daily administration could be expected to increase the efficacy of standard combination treatment with ribavirin and interferon administered thrice weekly. In order to test this hypothesis we designed a multicentre, randomized controlled trial to compare the efficacy and safety of a new treatment schedule for chronic hepatitis C including ribavirin, amantadine and daily interferon alfa administration with the standard combination treatment.",

These findings, together with the absence of an association between fibrosis score and CD4 counts and SVR, suggest that progression of both HCV and HIV infections does not decrease the response rate to interferon and ribavirin combination in patients without severe immune depletion. We can therefore hypothesize that in patients without a high probability of response and early stage of liver fibrosis a watchful waiting strategy would not reduce the potential efficacy of anti-HCV treatment. This hypothesis needs to be confirmed by larger studies or by a meta-analysis of multiple pilot studies.

Although all the included patients denied alcohol abuse, we cannot rule out that high GGT levels were due to undeclared excessive alcohol consumption. Body mass index was not significantly associated with treatment response. Only one of the SVRs showed high GGT at baseline; in this patient GGT normalized the third month after HCVRNA negativization. Evaluation of ART toxicity, careful assessment of alcohol intake and correction of alcohol abuse, diagnosis and treatment of altered lipid metabolism are factors to evaluate before starting treatment for chronic hepatitis C in patients co-infected with HIV.",
