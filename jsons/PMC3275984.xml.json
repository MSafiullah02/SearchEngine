The majority of cases of cold syndrome are acute infections of the upper respiratory tract, and its major cause is viral infection. From 30 to 50% of cases of cold syndrome are caused by rhinoviruses, and 10 to 15% are caused by coronaviruses [1]. Conventional methods of treatment use medications, such as analgesic agents and antihistamines, but these are only effective for the alleviation of symptoms, such as sneezing and runny nose [2]. Furthermore, antiviral agents, such as neuraminidase inhibitors, are believed to be effective; however, their application is currently limited to the influenza virus [1, 3\u20136]. Recently, Chinese medicine and dietary supplements have attracted attention as effective new methods for the treatment and prevention of cold syndrome [7]; for example, vitamin C; allysine, which is found in garlic; and the extract of the natural herb Echinacea [8\u201310]. However, there have also been reports indicating that the incidence of cold syndrome is unaffected by the above treatments [11, 12], and thus their effectiveness has yet to be clearly demonstrated.",

The subjects were randomly allocated into one of two groups using an allocation table: a group receiving placebo (P) and another group receiving cystine/theanine (CT). Both groups were studied at the same time. Before the test, we determined the number of subjects with allergy symptoms, the number of smokers, the number of subjects who caught a cold twice or more per year, and the number of subjects living with school-aged children, which are the family members most likely to catch a cold. When the subjects registered for the study, the investigator and the physician in charge provided the informed consent form, which was discussed and approved by the IRB. The content of the study was explained in detail, and the subjects provided their written voluntary consent.",

The symptoms recorded on the data sheets were converted to scores as follows: presence of symptoms (+) = 2, slight symptoms (\u00b1) = 1, and absence of symptoms (\u2212) = 0. The items were classified into four predominant symptoms: (1) stuffy nose/runny nose/sneezing as nasal symptoms, (2) cough/sputum/sore throat as throat symptoms, (3) chills and fever as febrile symptoms, and (4) headache/joint pain/pain in the skin as pain symptoms. If the score for the predominant symptom was more than 3 of 6 for nasal, throat, or pain symptoms, the predominant symptom was considered to be present. We considered febrile symptoms to be present if the score was more than 2 of 4. If 3 of 4 predominant symptoms were observed on the same day or if the body temperature was above 37.0\u00b0C and two or more common cold symptoms (stuffy nose/runny nose/sneezing, cough/sputum/sore throat/chills/headache/joint pain/pain in the skin/general malaise) displayed a score of 2, the subject was considered to have the common cold (Table 2). Based on this definition, the number of subjects with incidences of the common cold during the 5-week period of the study was counted, and the two groups were compared using Fisher's exact test. When there was another incidence of the common cold, according to the above definition, after 3 or more days of recovery from an earlier cold, this was counted as a separate incident. The number of affected days was also counted and was compared between the two groups using Poisson regression analysis. In addition, the average duration of the colds and the number of subjects that experienced a body temperature above 37.0\u00b0C were also determined and were compared between the two groups using the t-test and Fisher's exact test, respectively. The incidences of individual symptoms of the cold and adverse events in the evaluation of safety were counted if the score had reached 2 at least once during the 35-day period of the trial, and the number was compared between the two groups using Fisher's exact test. All statistical analyses were performed using the Statistical Analysis System (SAS) version 8.2 (SAS Institute, Inc., Cary, NC, USA), and the results were considered as significant at P < .05.",

Limited to those under physically stressed conditions, a meta-analysis of the effects of vitamin C indicated 50% suppression of the incidence of the common cold [17]. In addition, in the above-mentioned study by Predy et al., ingestion of the ginseng extract was shown to reduce the incidence of the common cold by approximately 56% [16]. Moreover, the extract of the natural herb Echinacea was reported to have a prophylactic efficacy of 55% or 58% on the incidence of common cold by two meta-analyses [18, 19]. By contrast, a study that employed continuous administration of N-acetylcysteine (NAC) indicated a 43% reduction in the incidence of influenza-like symptoms [20]. In the present study, the incidence of the common cold according to our definition was decreased by approximately 58% by CT ingestion. This result indicated that CT has a cold prevention effect with an efficacy similar to that of other nutrients that are considered to possess this effect. As previously mentioned, the majority of common colds are caused by viral infection, with rhinoviruses being the most common infectious agent [1]. These viruses are known to infect cells via intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1), which is a receptor on epithelial cells of the respiratory tract, and reduced GSH is known to inhibit the increased expression of ICAM-1 [21]. In our previous study in mice, we showed that the administration of CT significantly increases the amount of reduced GSH [13]. The above findings suggest that the increase in reduced GSH due to the ingestion of CT, which suppressed the expression of the virus receptor, led to prevention of the common cold and reduced the severity of cold symptoms.",

Riedel and Maulik reported that the increase in body temperature after lipopolysaccharide stimulation can be suppressed by administering a reducing agent, and they suggested the possibility that the increase in reduced GSH in response to the reducing agent suppressed fever [23]. NAC is known to show anti-inflammatory effects via GSH [24]. Reduced GSH is known to suppress the activation of NF-\u03baB, which is an inflammatory mediator at the time of rhinoviral infection [21]. These findings suggest that the suppression of individual symptoms of the common cold in the present study may have been due to the anti-inflammatory effect of increased GSH caused by CT ingestion. In this trial, there were some cases of observed symptoms but a lack of a cold during the trial. Consequently, we performed a Pearson correlation coefficient analysis between the incidence of colds during the trial and each symptom. The symptoms of chill (r = 0.694), fever (r = 0.663), and arthralgia (r = 0.610) showed strong correlations with the incidence of colds. In addition, the symptoms of cough (r = 0.467), runny nose (r = 0.458), and headache (r = 0.451) showed moderate correlations with the incidence of colds. These findings suggest that the definition of colds used in the present trial has a strong correlation with relatively severe symptoms.",

In a clinical study in humans, Miyagawa et al. reported that oral administration of CT improves antibody production in the elderly, with decreased immune function at the time of flu vaccination [25]. Moreover, Murakami et al. reported that CT ingestion by long-distance runners before a training camp suppressed the increase in blood neutrophil counts and the decrease in lymphocyte counts observed in control subjects after training [26]. Those results suggest that CT ingestion may improve the immunosuppression induced by aging in the elderly and by intense exercise in athletes. To determine whether this common cold inhibitory effect is due to the reinforcement of GSH synthesis and antibody production by CT ingestion, more detailed analyses are required using both animal and human subjects. The results of the present exploratory trial showed that CT is an effective and safe drug as a food ingredient to suppress the common cold, and we anticipate its use as a drug or food ingredient for cold prevention and symptom relief in the future.",
