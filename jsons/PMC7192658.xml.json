This time 17 years ago I had no idea that we were beginning a week that was going to irrevocably change, in just a few days, the way in which we practiced medicine.We had a big case planned for the Monday list. I was operating with the great Indian orthopaedic surgeon Professor Shekhar Kumta (\nFig. 1\n). This was one of the girdle tumors we wrote about in this journal some years back.\n1\n",

He had been in contact with several people, including a 29-year-old man who was admitted to the Prince of Wales Hospital on March 4. It is estimated that at least 99 hospital staff, including 17 medical students, became infected while treating that 29-year-old man. That week was like no other I have experienced. On March 12, 2003, World Health Organization (WHO) issued a global alert about a new infectious disease and thus the \u201csevere acute respiratory syndrome\u201d (SARS) was born. Immediate and urgent action had to be undertaken to protect both staff and patients. The Dean of the Faculty of medicine at The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Professor Sydney Chung, talked to the press (\nFig. 2\n).\n",

The mode of transmission was unclear, particularly when there was a community outbreak, which appeared to be related to wastewater drainage in a residential tower block. There is no doubt that there were early infections caused by respiratory patients who were having nebulizers to help their breathing. It was later that the need for specific infection control units with controlled airflow was appreciated (negative pressure as compared with the positive pressure in burns units). The mask that Professor Chung was using is the standard three-layer woven mask: this is used when we want to protect against \u201cdroplet\u201d infection. According to my microbiologist colleague, Professor Margaret Ip, these masks have the following specifications: they \u201cneed to pass the wet challenge of at least 95% bacterial filtration efficiency (BFE, standard testing using\nS. aureus\n, with 3 \u00b5m droplet size generated and at 28.3 L/mm, ASTM Level 1 masks), and preferably also pass the particulate filtration efficiency (PFE, which uses particles from 0.1 microns) assumingly suitable for virus filtration (ASTM Level 2).\u201d Basically, these masks are best worn to protect others from your droplets because they are not really good enough for health care workers because of the poor fitting of the masks. This is where the N95 mask comes in useful as it is a fitted mask designed to stop close quarter contamination.\n",

In\nFig. 3\nyou can see a complete halt in surgical activity for 10 days from March 15 while we worked out what to do. The problem was that our hospital was doing ultramajor surgery and for such cases a postoperative intensive care unit (ICU) bed was needed but all beds were being taken by medical cases ( NB this is why when a new hospital was built as few years later two separate ICUs were built on separate floors). Back in 2003 hospitals had to be designated as strictly elective or for all emergencies. In the elective hospitals we were soon able to transfer the big cases requiring microsurgical reconstruction, but triage was very important. Malignant cases were done but congenital and degenerative cases were postponed (\nFig. 4\n).\n",

Health care workers are at particular risk and must be protected.
