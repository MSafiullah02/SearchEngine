Selected regions of the fusion (F) gene were sequenced, analyzed and compared. The F gene of all isolates contained conserved motifs homologous to those described for other members of the family Paramyxoviridae including: signal peptide, transmembrane domain, furin cleavage site, fusion peptide, N-linked glycosylation sites, and two heptad repeats, the second of which (HRB-LZ) had the characteristics of a leucine zipper. Selected regions of the fusion gene of isolate Gono-GER85 were inserted into a prokaryotic expression system to generate three recombinant protein fragments of various sizes. The longest recombinant protein was cleaved by furin into two fragments of predicted length. Western blot analysis with virus-neutralizing rabbit-antiserum against this isolate demonstrated that only the longest construct reacted with the antiserum. This construct was unique in containing 30 additional C-terminal amino acids that included most of the HRB-LZ. These results indicate that the F genes of reptilian paramyxoviruses contain highly conserved motifs typical of other members of the family and suggest that the HRB-LZ domain of the reptilian paramyxovirus F protein contains a linear antigenic epitope.",

            "text": "Paramyxoviruses are recognized as important pathogens of reptiles [14, 20, 21, 37] . Beginning with the initial reports [10, 15] of the Fer-de-Lance virus (FDLV), reptilian paramyxoviruses have been isolated from outbreaks associated with severe sickness and mortality in collections of viperid-, colubrid-, boid-or elapid snakes and lizards held in venom farms, herpetariums and zoological parks in Europe and North America [17, 20] . Analysis of the full genome of the Fer-de-Lance virus (FDLV), the proposed type species virus for the group, suggests these viruses are bona fide members of the family Paramyxoviridae, but have unique properties including the presence of a novel gene not found in other members of the family [26] . Sequence analysis of a portion of the polymerase (L) and hemagglutinin-neuraminidase (HN) genes was used byAhne et al. [2] to assess the extent of genetic diversity among 16 isolates of reptilian paramyxoviruses. In that study, and in an additional analysis by Kindermann et al. [24] , most isolates fell into one of two distinct subgroups (genogroups), designated 'a' and 'b', that differed by more than 20% at the nucleotide level with a few isolates falling into 'intermediate' positions. A similar study of 18 reptilian paramyxovirus isolates by Franke et al. [16] confirmed these findings of genetic diversity and provided a preliminary characterization of portions of the fusion (F) gene.",

            "text": "Studies of mammalian and avian paramyxoviruses have shown that the fusion (F) protein of paramyxoviruses is a key determinant of virulence [25] . The F protein is synthesized as a biologically inactive precursor (F0) that is posttranslationally cleaved by cellular proteases into the disulfide-linked, fusiogenically active F1 and F2 subunits [39] . The newly released N-terminus of the F1 subunit contains a fusion peptide that aids insertion of the virus into the target membrane of the new host cell [5] . The carboxy-terminus anchors the viral transmembrane domain. The F protein motifs are highly conserved among paramyxoviruses [28] . However, activation of the F protein can be influenced by amino acid changes within several of the F protein motifs such as the cleavage site, the fusion peptide, heptad repeats A and B, or the leucine zipper [7, 8, 18, 22, 33, 36, 40] . In 2001, Junquiera de Azevedo et al. [23] reported a partial F gene sequence of a reptilian paramyxovirus, found as an expressed sequence tag clone from a wild-caught Fer-de-lance snake. In the same year, analysis of partial F gene sequences from 18 reptilian paramyxovirus isolates by Franke et al. [16] showed the presence of a predicted furin cleavage site having an amino acid sequence R-E-K-R within the F protein. This site was highly conserved among the isolates and homologous to the paramyxovirus consensus sequence Arg-X-Arg/Lys-Arg (R-X-R/K-R). Franke et al. [16] also compared the sequences for a 25-aminoacid region of the predicted fusion peptide and reported an 11 amino acid region (TSAQITAGIAL) was identical among the isolates and was homologous to the conserved domain described for certain genera of the subfamily Paramyxovirinae.",

Protein motifs such as signal peptides and transmembrane domains were predicted Prokaryotic expression of the F gene A prokaryotic expression system was used to create a set of recombinant proteins based upon the nucleotide sequence of isolate Gono-GER85 (AY725422). The two longest recombinant proteins were designed to contain either the entire F0 protein (residues 1-546, not shown) or a truncated form (residues 26-490) lacking much of the signal peptide and the entire transmembrane anchor and cytoplasmic domain (Fig. 1 ). Two shorter recombinant proteins were designed to be analogous to the F protein subunit F1, excluding the heptad B motif and the transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains (residues 111-460), and subunit F2, excluding most of the signal peptide (residues 26-110). To generate the expression constructs, RNA was amplified with fragment-specific primers ( Table 2 ) and the DNA fragments were cloned into the pET-30a (+) expression vector (Novagen, Madison, WI, USA). The vectors were propagated in the NovaBlue E. coli strain (Novagen) and expressed in Rosetta (DE3) E. coli strain (Novagen). As a positive control, the 120 kD \u03b2-galactosidase was expressed in E. coli strain BL21 (Novagen), and as negative control, E. coli was transfected with plain vector.

The predicted N-terminal hydrophobic domain at amino acids 1-33 is believed to represent the signal peptide (SP) while the C-terminal hydrophobic domain at amino acids 503-520 is believed to represent the transmembrane anchor (TM). A predicted furin cleavage site (CS) is located at residues 107-110 at the C-terminal end of the F2 subunit and adjacent to the predicted fusion peptide (FP) at residues 111-135. Cleavage at this predicted site would divide the F protein into the F1 and F2 subunits. Two heptad repeats (HR) were predicted at residues 145-186 (HRA) and at residues 461-502 (HRB). Each heptad unit consisted of seven amino acids (positions a, b, c, d, e, f, g) with conserved hydrophobic or mostly non-polar residues occurring at positions a and d. The heptad units in FDLV were found to repeat six times (Fig. 2a, b) . A helical wheel-model (Fig. 3 ) was used to illustrate the cross section of an alpha-helix into which the heptad repeats are believed to fold creating two opposing faces, a nonpolar-neutral face and a charged face. The HRB sequence also was predicted to encode a leucine zipper (LZ), with the hydrophobic amino acids leucine or isoleucine lining up in position a as shown in Fig. 3 . Three potential amino acid-linked glycosylation sites (N-G) were identified at the asparagine residues located at positions 102, 436 and 443 of the F protein (Fig. 1) ; however, it was not determined if any of these sites were actually glycosylated.

The first region included the CS, FP, and HRA motifs (Fig. 2a ) and the second region contained the HRB-LZ motif (Fig. 2b) . Comparisons among the 14 isolates showed a high degree of similarity, but not identity, in these regions. In general, isolates identified by Ahne et al. [2] as members of subgroup 'a' had a conserved sequence for each of the motifs while isolates identified as subgroup 'b' had a conserved sequence that differed slightly from that of subgroup 'a'. Those isolates identified as members 'intermediate' to the two subgroups showed inconsistent results, sometimes having the conserved sequence of subgroup 'a', sometimes subgroup 'b', or occasionally for certain motifs, differing from the sequence of members of either subgroup 'a' or 'b' (Fig. 2a, b) . The amino acid sequence of the predicted furin cleavage site of the 14 reptilian paramyxoviruses is shown in Fig. 2a . The conserved sequence, R-E-K-R was present in 13 of the isolates in agreement with the results reported by Franke et al. [16] , while one 'intermediate' isolate, Crot2-OH90, had the sequence R-G-K-R. All the sequences were consistent with the paramyxovirus consensus furin cleavage site, R-X-R/K-R [28] . In the 10-amino acid sequence upstream of the CS at residues 97-106, virus isolates of subgroup 'a' differed from those of subgroup 'b' by 60% (6 of 10 aa) and with the 'intermediate' isolates by 20-40% [2-4 of 10 aa; data not shown).",

For the entire F protein of FDLV (545 aa) the range of amino acid identity with representatives of other paramyxovirus genera was 22-32% [26] .",

The PCR amplicons from selected regions of the F gene of the Gono-GER85 isolate were used to produce various constructs of the F protein in a prokaryotic expression system. A construct designed to produce the full length F0 protein did not express detectable levels of recombinant protein and was not considered further. However, Fig. 4 . The left column shows the western blots using a monoclonal anti-His antibody (MAb Anti-His) and the right column shows the corresponding western blots using the virus-neutralizing polyclonal rabbit serum (PAb Anti-RPMV). The blots in section A contain complete bacterial proteins including the recombinant protein (rp), section B contains Hispurified rp, and section C contains His-purified, dialysed rp after digestion with furin.

Estimated molecular masses of the proteins are given on the sides of the blots as estimated from molecular weight standards (M 1 , M 2 ) three other constructs shown as recombinant protein 1, 2, and 3 in Fig. 1 were expressed at levels that were easily detectable on Western blots developed using a monoclonal antibody to the terminal His-Tag on each recombinant protein (Fig. 4) . The recombinant proteins were approximately 30 aa larger than the native partial proteins due to the His-Tag and the multiple cloning site derived from the expression vector. The largest of the three recombinant proteins (rp1) had an estimated molecular mass of 55 kD, the predicted size for the F0 protein without the signal peptide or the transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains. The recombinant protein designed to mimic the F2 subunit (rp2) had an estimated molecular mass of 14 kD, while the recombinant protein designed to mimic a truncated F1 subunit (rp3) had an estimated molecular mass of 42 kD.",

Those motifs represent key determinants for cell infection and virulence [25, 28] . Our results extend the presence of these conserved F protein motifs to paramyxoviruses of reptile hosts as well. The F protein cleavage site of the reptilian paramyxoviruses was identified by sequence homology at the C-terminal end of the F2 subunit next to the N-terminal end of the F1 subunit fusion peptide (Fig. 1) as reported for other paramyxovirus F proteins [28] . With the exception of a single isolate, the reptilian viruses exhibited the same multibasic furin recognition site (R-E-K-R) reported by Franke et al. [16] .

            "text": "Proteins inducing membrane fusion in the families Paramyxoviridae, Orthomyxoviridae, Retroviridae, and Filoviridae generally require cleavage modification to become biologically active [5, 22] . For the paramyxovirus, Newcastle disease virus (NDV), the nature of the CS was shown to be a major virulence factor [12, 33, 41] . Following conversion of the amino acid sequence of the CS of a low virulence (lentogenic) recombinant LaSota strain of NDV (G-G-R-Q-G-R L) to the multibasic (G-R-R-Q-R-R F) furin motif, the virus became highly pathogenic [33] . Also, passage of a lentogenic wild type strain of NDV in domestic chickens resulted in the emergence of a highly virulent (velogenic) pathogen. Sequence analysis of the strains showed the conversion of the cleavage site amino acid sequence, E-R-Q-E-R L, to K-R-Q-K-R F, the consensus motif for furin cleavage [41] . Furin occurs ubiquitously in the Golgi apparatus of host cells [47] and cleavage of the F0 protein by furin enables virus replication in a wide range of tissues and organs leading to fatal systemic infection and death [33, 42] . In contrast, tryptase Clara, a protease cleaving the lentogenic NDV strains and Sendai virus, is only secreted from epithelial cells present in respiratory and intestinal tracts [43] . The presence of a furin cleavage site is consistent with the ability of the reptilian paramyxoviruses to replicate in many tissues and to cause severe sickness and mortalities among infected snakes [14, 15, 17, [19] [20] [21] .",

To enable fusion with a host cell membrane, the hydrophobic fusion peptide also requires the previous attachment of the viral envelope to the host cell [34] . In the reptilian paramyxoviruses, as for most other members of the family, this may be provided by the presence of the HN protein [2, 26] .

            "text": "The F protein sequences of the reptilian paramyxoviruses revealed two heptad repeats which proved to be nearly identical among isolates. An F protein model of SV5 paramyxovirus shows the HR motifs are located in the F1 protein following the N-terminal FP (HRA) and before the C-terminal transmembrane anchor (HRB). The two motifs are located more than 250 residues apart [22, 28] , similar to the organization for FDLV as shown in Fig. 1 . An important attribute of a HR is to facilitate self-assembly into an alpha-helix. In the native form, the F protein is shaped as a hairpin with the HRA and HRB forming anti-parallel alpha-helices [6, 8] and alpha-helical coiled coils form the backbones of the viral glycoproteins of paramyxoviruses and other enveloped viruses such as HIV [5, 22] . Additionally, the HRB is a leucine zipper with the amino acid leucine or isoleucine in position a [7, 50] . The leucine zipper motif is present in all paramyxovirus F proteins, coronavirus spike proteins and many retrovirus envelope proteins [6] . The amino acids in the key positions a and d generate a hydrophobic face on the helix. Those faces enable proteins to oligomerize, which was shown to be essential for the paramyxoviral F protein [9] . This property allows several F protein monomers to form homo-oligomers [6, 13, 36] . Oligomer-formation is a characteristic described for fusion proteins of enveloped viruses such as member of the families Paramyxoviridae (SV5), Orthomyxoviridae (influenza virus), Retroviridae (HIV), and Filoviridae (Ebola virus) [5, 22] , and the oppositely charged faces of the helix as shown in Fig. 3 are consistent with the structure needed for self assembly of reptilian paramyxovirus F protein monomers into oligomers. Mutation analysis of the leucine zipper motif in the measles virus (MV) and NDV showed that substitution of leucine residues abolished the fusiogenic activity of the protein. However, protein expression, oligomerization, and cellular transport seemed to be unaffected [6, 36] . Young et al. [50] reported disruption of the secondary structure through replacement of leucine residues with non-polar alanine residues. For the HRB sequence of reptilian paramyxoviruses, leucine was found more often in position a and isoleucine in position d (Fig. 3) suggesting the oligomers are composed of a four-stranded assembly [11] .",

Adjacent to the TM anchor in the N-terminal direction was the HRB as described by Chambers et al. [8] for fusion glycoproteins. From an immunological standpoint, the highly exposed position of viral glycoproteins on the surface of infected cells makes them targets for the host immune response. Both linear and conformationdependent neutralizing epitopes have been identified on the F protein of several paramyxoviruses including human respiratory syncytial virus (HRSV), human parainfluenza virus 3, Sendai virus, and NDV [30, 32, 35, 44-46, 48, 49] . Sequence analysis of neutralization escape mutants selected by neutralizing MAbs showed the presence of unique epitopes on either the F1 or F2 subunits of the F protein as well as epitopes that mapped to both the F1 and F2 subunits [32, 38] indicating that, following cleavage, the two subunits are folded together and joined by disulfide linkages in a manner that gives rise to a number of complex, conformationdependent epitopes. These analyses also revealed that many of the neutralizing and fusion-inhibiting epitopes mapped to the cysteine-rich region (amino acids 300-420) of the paramyxovirus F1 subunit located between the two heptad repeats. Langedijk et al. [29] mapped a highly conserved neutralizing epitope of HRSV to a site within HRA.",

The reacting epitope was located within a 30 amino acid region of the HRB containing the leucine zipper motif, a domain located outside of the viral membrane and therefore exposed to the host immune system. Because the antiserum reacted with the recombinant protein in Western blots following SDS-PAGE, we assume it is a linear epitope; however, the antiserum also reacted with several other denatured proteins from purified virus (Fig. 4) . Thus, further studies will be needed to search for the presence of conformation-dependent epitopes and to determine if the linear epitope we identified on the F protein is associated with neutralization.",

Degenerate primers used to amplify and sequence the cleavage site, fusion peptide, HRA and HRB. Normal first round rt-PCR was performed with primers 1701/1718. Second round primers were also used as sequencing primers. To amplify the HRA and HRB regions of certain isolates, the annealing temperature was reduced from 50 \u2022 C to 35 \u2022 C during both rounds of amplification. Some isolates required other primer combinations: the HRB region of subgroup 'a' isolates required 1716/1718 in first round (35 \u2022 C), with 1799/1800 in second round (35 \u2022 C).
