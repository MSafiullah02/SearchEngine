Most effective of these are the mechanical barriers provided by skin and the mucosal surfaces, as well as the chemically hostile environment of the gut (Fig. 25.1\n). A number of common human viral pathogens enter through the gastrointestinal tract, including rotavirus, enteric adenoviruses, and hepatitis A virus (HAV). These are usually spread via person-to-person contact or contaminated food and water. Respiratory infections caused by influenza viruses, rhinoviruses, coronaviruses, measles virus, varicella-zoster virus (VZV), and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) are often spread by aerosol transmission, as well as person-to-person contact. Many of the herpes viruses target the skin or the mucosae, such as herpes simplex virus (HSV) and VZV. HSV, in particular, can infect the oral and genital mucosae, the eye, and skin through small cuts and abrasions. Other herpes viruses, such as Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) and cytomegalovirus (CMV), target mucosae. CMV can also spread vertically from mother to baby or rarely via blood transfusions. Human papillomavirus (HPV) targets skin and mucosae and causes warts and may transform cells, inducing cancers, such as cervical cancer. Some viruses, such as West Nile virus, Dengue virus, Semliki forest virus, and Zika virus, can enter through skin via insect vectors. HIV and hepatitis B virus (HBV) are commonly spread via sexual contact. HIV, HBV, and hepatitis C virus (HCV) can also infect humans by direct entry into the bloodstream via transfusions or contaminated needles.",

Many viruses use two receptors, such as the use of the CD4 coreceptor and the chemokine receptor CCR5 on T cells by HIV. After attachment to a cellular receptor, viruses may fuse with the cell membrane or be endocytosed and then gain entry into the cytoplasm or nucleus by fusing with the vesicular membrane (enveloped viruses, such as HSV and HIV), or translocate across the cell membrane or induce lysis of the endocytic vesicle once in the cytoplasm (nonenveloped viruses, such as Norwalk virus and poliovirus).1 Viruses then utilize host cell machinery and specialized virally encoded proteins to replicate rapidly within the cell. Once they have multiplied within the cell, many viruses induce cytolysis to facilitate release of new infectious virions (e.g., poxviruses, poliovirus, and herpes viruses). Other viruses are released from infected cells by budding through the cell membrane in the absence of cell death (e.g., HIV and influenza virus). Having entered the body, however, viruses encounter numerous innate defenses and activate the components of adaptive immunity. The latter usually assures that clinical disease, if not infection, will not become evident. Successful exploitation of these defenses through the use of vaccines (Chapter 90) remains a central challenge for many human viruses, particularly those that cause chronic infections, such as HIV and HCV.2\n",

Innate defenses come into play to block or inhibit initial infection, to protect cells from infection, or to eliminate virus-infected cells. Innate mechanisms occur well before the effectors of adaptive immunity become active, but they are critical for the initiation of adaptive immunity via the elicitation of inflammation that promotes immune cell activation. The innate immune defenses are initiated via pattern recognition receptors (PRRs), which recognize pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs)3 (Chapter 3). These include transmembrane receptors of the Toll-like receptor (TLR) family, two families of intracellular receptors including the NOD-like receptors (NLRs) and the RIG-I\u2013like helicases (RLHs), as well as the sensor molecule absent in melanoma-2 (AIM2). Additionally, the molecules cyclic guanosine monophosphate\u2013adenosine monophosphate (GMP-AMP) synthase (cGAS), DDX41, IFI16, and Z-DNA\u2013binding protein 1 (ZBP1) can sense cytosolic DNA (Table 25.2\n). These cellular sensors promote the expression of interleukin-1 (IL-1) and IL-18, type I (\u03b1/\u03b2) interferon (IFN-I), and a variety of IFN-stimulated genes and inflammatory cytokines, and chemokines. TLRs are cell surface or endosomal membrane\u2013bound proteins expressed by numerous cells, including dendritic cells (DCs), macrophages, lymphocytes, and parenchymal cells. Expression of TLRs is largely inducible in most cell types, although some (TLR7/8/9) are constitutively expressed at high levels by specialized plasmacytoid DCs for rapid IFN production. Different TLR molecules recognize specific viral products, such as single- and double-stranded RNA (TLR 3 and TLR7/8, respectively) or double-stranded DNA (TLR9).",

            "text": "The innate defense system consists of multiple cellular components and many specialized proteins. The longest known and best-studied antiviral proteins are the \u03b1/\u03b2 IFNs, which act by binding to the type I IFN receptor and result in the transcription of more than 100 IFN-stimulated genes. One consequence of this \u201cantiviral state\u201d is the inhibition of cell protein synthesis and the prevention of viral replication.5 Multiple leukocyte subsets are involved in innate defense, including macrophages, DCs, neutrophils, natural killer (NK) cells, natural killer T cells (NKT cells), and \u03b3\u03b4T cells. Furthermore, tissue cells, including fibroblasts, epithelial cells, and endothelial cells, express PRRs and respond to viral infection via the production of innate cytokines, including IFN-I and IL-1. IFN-I is a critical link between the innate and adaptive immune system, via activation of DCs and T cells, as well as protecting T cells from NK cell-mediated attack.6 IFN-Is can also activate NK cells and induce other cytokines that promote NK responses, such as IFN-\u03b3 and IL-12. NK cells produce proinflammatory cytokines; they can kill infected cells and interact with DCs, and are an important component of innate defense against viruses. NK cells can protect against some herpes viruses, which downregulate major histocompatibility complex (MHC) expression in the cells they infect. NK cells are also important in resistance to mouse and human CMV and possibly to HIV, influenza virus, and Ebola virus.7 NK cells have also recently been shown to possess traits of adaptive immunity and, like T and B cells, can form populations of memory cells.8 NK cells are regulated by an array of activating and inhibitory receptors, whose expression and function are just beginning to be understood. Uninfected cells are usually protected from NK cell cytolysis as they deliver negative signals, such as high expression of MHC molecules. In contrast, virus-infected cells are killed either because they deliver positive signals or because they lack adequate MHC-negative signals. NK cells may also control excessive immune responses to viruses by killing CD4+ T cells and indirectly regulating cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) responses. NKT cells may provide some antigen-specific innate immune protection against certain viruses, such as influenza virus.9\n",

            "text": "Several classes of innate host proteins function in antiviral defense. These include natural antibodies, which may play a role in defense against some viral infections, as well as pentraxins and complement proteins.10 Some viruses may be directly inactivated by complement activation or be destroyed by phagocytic cells that bind and ingest complement-bound virions. Several proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines induced by virus infection also play key roles in defense. Foremost among these is IL-1 and other members of the IL-1 family, including IL-18 and IL-33.11 These cytokines influence both innate and adaptive immune cells and play critical roles in antiviral defense. Other antiviral cytokines are produced early following infection, such as TNF-\u03b1, IFN-\u03b3, IL-12, IL-6, and chemokines, such as MIP-1\u03b1. In particular, IL-12 is a potent inducer of IFN-\u03b3 from NK cells. Inflammatory chemokines may also play an important role in innate antiviral defense by orchestrating macrophage, neutrophil, DC, and NK cell responses at the site of infection. Not only are these components of innate immunity involved in mediating initial protection against viruses; several components (e.g., the PRRs; the cytokines IFN-I, IL-I, IL-33, and IL-12; and phagocytes, including macrophages, monocytes, and DCs) serve to shape the nature and effectiveness of the subsequent adaptive response to viral pathogens. For instance, DCs require innate signals, such as IFN-I and IL-12, for maturation and optimal T-cell activation. Furthermore, CD8+ T cells responding to viruses need IFN-I and IL-33 signals for expansion and memory formation. Thus both the magnitude and the type of innate response induced by virus infection have a marked influence on the generation of adaptive immune responses.",

The two major divisions of adaptive immunity, antibody-mediated and T-cell\u2013mediated, are mainly directed at different targets. Antibodies usually function by binding to free viral particles and, in so doing, block infection of the host cell (Chapter 15). In contrast, T cells act principally by recognizing and destroying virus-infected cells or by orchestrating an inflammatory response that includes several antiviral components (Chapters 16, 17). As all viruses replicate within cells and many can spread directly between cells without reentering the extracellular environment, resolution of infection is reliant more on T-cell function than on antibody function. However, broadly neutralizing antiviral antibodies have the potential to be effective therapies against many different human infections, including HIV, influenza viruses, and Ebola virus. Recent advances have allowed researchers to isolate and identify human monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) against these and other pathogens,12 offering promise of new therapies as well as significant insight for vaccine design. Antiviral antibodies are also very important as an immunoprotective barrier against reinfection. It is the presence of antibodies at portals of entry\u2014most often mucosal surfaces\u2014that is of particular relevance to influenza, HSV, and HIV infections.13 Yet, how to generate vaccines that induce optimal antibody responses, including broadly neutralizing antibodies, remains an important unsolved problem.",

Specific CD8+ CTL precursors recognize antigen in the context of MHC class I\u2013peptide antigen complexes on DCs. The CD8+ T cells become activated, proliferate, and differentiate into effectors. Expansion of these na\u00efve antigen-specific precursors is considerable, often exceeding 10 000-fold, and results in an effector population that can account for 40% or more of a host's total CD8+ T-cell population (Fig. 25.2\n). Various factors, including antigen and APCs, costimulatory molecules (e.g., CD28 and 4\u20131BB), and inflammatory cytokines (e.g., IFN-I and IL-12) are required to program the development of functional effector lymphocytes. In some infections, CD4+ T-cell help is also important to prime robust CTL responses via signals, including CD40 that are delivered to DCs.18 Activated CTL effectors then exit lymphoid organs and access almost all body locations via the bloodstream. However, effectors do not stay activated for long once the virus is cleared, and approximately 95% die by a process termed activation-induced cell death. Following this contraction phase, the remaining cells differentiate into memory cells, which remain as a more or less stable population in the host for many years. They represent an expanded pool of CTL precursors that can be activated upon secondary encounter with antigen and provide enhanced protection upon reinfection with the same virus (see next section). Although much of our knowledge of T-cell responses to viruses has been obtained from murine studies, it is increasingly clear that the fundamental principles are the same or similar in humans.19\n",

Alternatively, CD8+ T cells also mediate defense through the release of various cytokines after antigen recognition. Some of the cytokines and chemokines most highly produced by CTLs include IFN-\u03b3, TNF-\u03b1, lymphotoxin-\u03b1, and RANTES (CCL5) (Chapters 9, 10).

Multiple functional subsets of CD4+ T cells are recognized based largely on the types of cytokines produced when they recognize antigen. CD4+ T cells are more broadly reactive than CD8+ T cells; they recognize larger peptides processed from viral proteins and are restricted by MHC class II. These CD4+ T cells participate in antiviral immunity in several ways. They can act as helper cells for the development of high-affinity antibody responses and for more functional CD8+ T-cell responses.16, 21 Additionally, CD4+ T cells act as effectors and orchestrate inflammatory reactions, which either serve a protective function or, in some cases, become prolonged causing chronic tissue damage (Chapter 16). The latter can happen in HCV-mediated hepatitis and HSV-mediated stromal keratitis. Occasionally, CD4+ T cells can mediate direct cytotoxicity, but they are less effective than CD8+ T cells. The principal subsets of CD4+ T cells involved in inflammatory reactions are T helper-1 (Th1) cells (producing mainly IFN-\u03b3, tumor necrosis factor [TNF]-\u03b1, IL-2) and Th17-producing cells (IL-17a and IL-22). A third effector subset, Th2 cells producing (IL-4, IL-5, and IL-13), also participates in inflammatory reactions, although in the case of viruses, these are usually more tissue damaging than protective. This situation can occur in responses to RSV infection. Regulatory T cells (Tregs) are a further subset of CD4+ T cells of particular importance, since these cells largely act to regulate the function of effector subsets and, in so doing, influence the severity and duration of inflammatory reactions22 (Chapter 18). Tregs produce antiinflammatory cytokines, such as IL-10 and TGF-\u03b2, and can be distinguished from other CD4+ subsets by their expression of a unique transcription factor FoxP3. The balance of CD4+ T-cell subset representation in response to a virus infection is critical. In situations where responses become overtly tissue damaging and chronic, the balance favors effector subsets. In such situations, changing the balance to favor Tregs can result in diminished lesions.",

Following infection with certain viruses, memory can be exceptionally long-lived, potentially for the life of the host (e.g., yellow fever and smallpox viruses).19, 23 Memory is defined by the persistence of specific lymphocytes and antibody-producing plasma cells rather than that of antigen to induce continuous lymphocyte activation. Humoral memory to viruses involves long-lived plasma cells in bone marrow, which provide a continuous low-level source of serum antibody. This maintenance of humoral immunity also involves a population of homeostatically maintained memory B cells, which may be required to maintain stable numbers of long-lived plasma cells over time. The pool of memory T cells is regulated by low-level homeostatic division controlled by the cytokines IL-7 and IL-15. For memory CD8+ T cells, IL-7 is primarily important for survival, whereas IL-15 is crucial for low-level proliferation to maintain the size of the memory T-cell pool.Image 3 Key Concepts: Principles of Antiviral Immunity\nMany human viral infections are successfully controlled by the immune system.Certain emerging viruses may overwhelm the immune system and cause severe morbidity and mortality.Other viruses have developed mechanisms to overwhelm or evade the immune system and persist.Individuals with defects in innate or adaptive immunity demonstrate more severe viral infections.T-cell immunity is more important for control than are antibodies in many viral infections.Antibodies are important to minimize reinfection, particularly at mucosal sites.Immune memory is often sufficient to prevent secondary disease, although not in all viral infections.Tissue-specific immune memory may be important to rapidly protect against reinfection at peripheral sites (e.g., skin and mucosae).\nAlt-text: Unlabelled box\n",

Such situations most commonly involve persistent viruses, which are themselves often mildly cytodestructive in the absence of an immune reaction. Chronic tissue damage initiated by viruses can also result in development of an autoreactive and an occasionally oncogenic response. For example, some autoimmune diseases may be initiated or exacerbated by viral infections, but no named virus has been regularly incriminated as a cause of human autoimmune disease.33 Circumstantial evidence exists for a virus link in multiple sclerosis (MS), insulin-dependent diabetes, and possibly systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). In MS, many viruses have been isolated from patients, although no specific one has been tied to the disease etiology.

The lesions were assumed to represent inflammatory reactions to tissue-entrapped immune complexes that activate complement. Similar immune complex\u2013mediated lesions occur in other infections, including lung lesions found in severe influenza, respiratory syncytial virus infection, viral hepatitis, and arthritis.

Neither lesion becomes evident if the CD8+ T-cell response is suppressed. CD8+ T cell\u2013mediated immunopathology can be a causative mechanism of chronic hepatitis associated with HCV and HBV infection, although the tissue damage also involves inflammatory CD4+ T cells. Additional viral immunopathology models where lesions result primarily from CD8+ T-cell involvement include myocarditis and insulin-dependent diabetes associated with coxsackie B virus infection. In both instances, CD8+ T cells mainly orchestrate events, but tissue damage may result from the bystander effects of cytokines and other molecules, such as lipid mediators, metalloproteinases, and components of the oxygen burst.

In both situations, CD4+ T cells that produce Th1 cytokines appear to serve as pathological mediators. Furthermore, in both models an increase in the involvement of myelin-derived autoantigens occurs as the disease progresses. Once again, such observations indicate the possible role of a virus in an autoimmune disease. With the Theiler virus model, the virus persists in the nervous system and chronically stimulates CD4+ T cells to secrete an array of cytokines. The demyelinating events appear to result from cytokine action on oligodendrocytes.

Recall responses induce a larger effector pool and reduced contraction further boosting the memory pool. (B) Effector and memory T-cell differentiation. Antigen stimulation expands effector cells, most of which die during the contraction phase. Effector memory T (TEM) cells that are formed gradually convert to central memory T (TCM) cells over time, with corresponding changes in surface marker expression. Some effector T cells develop into resident memory T (TRM) cells that persist in the tissues and do not reenter the circulation.",
