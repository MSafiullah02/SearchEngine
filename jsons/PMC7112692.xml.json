For the last 50 years, HRV has been thought to cause only mild respiratory infections. However, several recent findings are altering our understanding of HRVs. In 2007, a novel HRV was identified in infants with bronchiolitis.9 Other new strains were subsequently detected.10, 11, 12 These novel HRV strains are now designated as HRV-C, as recommended by the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV). Research teams from different countries have detected such HRV strains and have characterized their role in ARTIs around the globe.13, 14, 15, 16, 17\n",

Furthermore, our previous study indicated that HRVs have been responsible for the second most frequent ARTIs in China.21 However, the role and clinical characteristics of HRV-C infections in adult patients with ARTIs has yet to be delineated.",

The sampling was performed every day. Patients were from 14 to 97 years old (median age of 30 years, and average age of 35.62 years). The patient-recruitment criteria have been previously described.21 In brief, to include potential viral ARTIs and to exclude typical bacterial infections, patients enrolled in the study were randomly selected by physicians according to the following criteria: \u226514 years of age, with respiratory symptoms such as cough or wheezing, acute fever (body temperature \u226538 \u00b0C), and normal or low leukocyte count, with or without radiological pulmonary abnormalities. Nasal and throat swabs were collected from each patient, and the two swabs were pooled in one tube containing virus transport medium (VTM; Copan, Brescia, Italy). The samples were stored at \u221280 \u00b0C until use. Note that asthma patients who may potentially be infected by rhinovirus were not included in our study because asthma patients who do not exhibit fever are excluded from the Fever Clinic Department. The infections of multiple viruses, including human parainfluenza viruses (HPIV) 1\u20134, influenza viruses, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), enteroviruses, human coronaviruses (229E, NL63, HKU1, and OC43), metapneumovirus, adenoviruses, and bocavirus were also screened by multiplex RT-PCR or single RT-PCR or PCR assays.21\n",

Although HRV-B infection constituted a smaller fraction of the overall HRV infection, we did note a modest increase in HRV-B detection rate from July to October, in both 2006 and 2007.

            "text": "Capsid-coding sequencing is an ideal method for HRV detection and taxonomy.39 However, a single pair of primers is not sufficient to detect all HRV strains in clinical specimens due to the high variability of HRV genome\u2014even in cases where the primers target the conservative VP4 region. As such, single detection with VP4/VP2 primers may lead to false negative results. To overcome this barrier, we also assayed for the 5\u2032-UTR, not as a surrogate of capsid-coding sequence based typing, but as a supplemental tool for VP4/VP2 negative samples.13 The primers targeting 5\u2032-UTR can detect HRV in VP4/VP2 negative samples.19 Using this additional methodology, we identified more than half (146/271) of the HRVs in samples that were initially negative for VP4/VP2. Published studies have demonstrated the relative reliability of using 5\u2032-UTR in HRV detection despite some uncertainty.39 The 5\u2032-UTR contains both highly conserved sequences and variable sequences that exhibit 45%13\u201363% identity,25 making this assay an ideal candidate for typing strains that have eluded capsid gene amplification.37 Lee et al.13 and Kiang et al.25 found that all HRV prototype strains had unique genomic sequences in the 5\u2032-UTR, which allows the distinction of HRV from other picornavirus, i.e. enteroviruses, by using ECHO11 as an outgroup. Though differ from those of VP4/VP2, the phylogenetic tree constructed by 5\u2032-UTR can cluster HRV-C into several clades. Some HRV-C strains (HRV-QPM, C026, NAT001 are clustered as HRV-A2; C025 and NAT045 are clustered as GAC-1) are clustered within the HRV-A clade based on 5\u2032-UTR sequence. Piralla et al. have demonstrated that these strains are actually HRV-C strains by analysis of the VP4/VP2 region and the cre element.19 Hence, in this case, although some HRV-C strains are being clustered into the HRV-A clade based on their 5\u2032-UTR sequence, they still can be correctly typed by using the designated HRV-C strains as indicators in the phylogenetic tree. In our study, we used 5\u2032-UTR primers according to Lee et al.13 to improve the detection of HRV. In addition, we analyzed all the PCR products by phylogenetic analysis, including all available rhinovirus prototypes and some enterovirus strains to ensure that the positive result was true. Therefore, our results of HRV detection based on the 5\u2032-UTR approach appears sound. Given the complexity of HRV types and our limited detection, future detailed investigations on HRV typing could verify this matter.",

HRV is an important cause of asthma exacerbations in children43 and HRV-positive adults have more asthma symptoms than non-infected adults.44 As patients were recruited from the Fever Clinic Department and asthmatic patients without fever were not admitted to this department, asthma patients potentially infected by rhinovirus were not included in our study. Nicholson et al.41 reported that chronic ill health and smoking increases the likelihood of lower respiratory complications among HRV-infected elderly people (aged 60\u201390). In our investigation, the majority of patients aged 18\u201359 years and most of HRV-positive people were healthy before the respiratory tract infection event. Only five patients admitted to smoking in this study. In addition, most of our patients suffered from URTIs (96%), and hospitalized patients with LRTIs were not included in this study.

The scale shows evolutionary distances. All available HRV prototypes (\u0394), previously identified HRV-C strains (\u25cf), some enterovirus strains and HRV sequences detected in this study are included.

Each strain from this study is indicated by a specific identification code (PUMCH) followed by the patient number and the time of sampling. HRV-A, HRV-B and HRV-C are drawn in red, blue and green, respectively. Polioviruses-1, Polioviruses-2, Human coxsackieviruses-A1, Human coxsackieviruses-A6, Human echoviruses 11 and HRV87 prototypes are included as outgroups.",
