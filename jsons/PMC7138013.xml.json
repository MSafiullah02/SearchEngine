            "text": "It is almost universally acknowledged that another influenza pandemic is inevitable. Intervals between pandemics have varied from 11 to 42 years with no clear pattern, but since the most recent pandemic was 37 years ago in 1968, the upper limit of past experience is being fast approached. The outbreak of highly pathogenic avian influenza A/H5N1 in domestic birds in parts of Asia, which has recently spread to eastern Europe, has caused at least 135 human cases and 69 deaths,1 and raised fears that this virus will mutate into a form capable of causing pandemic influenza. During the influenza pandemic of 1918\u201319, between 20 and 50 million people died, more than during the preceding World War I. Similarly, the toll of human death and disease during a future pandemic is likely to far outweigh that of recent natural disasters, infectious disease outbreaks such as severe acute respiratory syndrome, or an act of bioterrorism. In addition, because the global economy is now far more interconnected than it has ever been, a future pandemic will have a devastating effect on world trade.",

Yet, despite the influenza virus first being isolated from human beings as long ago as 1933,2, 3 and all the advances of the past century in prevention, treatment, and diagnosis of infectious diseases, the world is ill-equipped to prevent the spread of the first wave of a future pandemic. An effective vaccine may not be available for the first 6 months of the pandemic and stocks of antiviral drugs are unlikely to be adequate to treat all those infected. Many questions remain to be answered to prepare adequately for pandemic influenza\u2014eg, what is the role of wild birds and domestic animals besides poultry in transmitting the disease and acting as \u201cmixing vessels\u201d for viral recombination; avian influenza has a high mortality rate in human beings, but will it become less virulent if it mutates into a form capable of human-to-human transmission; and what are the molecular mechanisms that permit human-to-human transmission?",
