Corticosteroid treatment effect on outcome was analyzed by multivariate logistic regression with adjustment for major variables (age, SpO2/FiO2, and lymphocytes) associated with mortality; individual propensity score was incorporated as a covariable to calculate the propensity-adjusted odds ratio (OR) [5]. PSM generated propensity score-matched pairs without replacement, and survival probability was compared by the Kaplan-Meier curve and analyzed with the log-rank test. Cox regression was used to estimate hazard ratio (HR) with 95% CI. For unadjusted comparisons, a two-sided P < 0.05 was considered statistically significant.",

All patients were given antiviral therapy (e.g., oseltamivir, arbidol, lopinavir/ritonavir, ganciclovir, interferon-\u03b1), and 151 (62%) were given adjuvant corticosteroid treatment (median hydrocortisone-equivalent dosage 200 [range 100\u2013800] mg/day). Five (5.4%) and 79 (52.3%) patients died in non-steroid and steroid groups, respectively. The median (IQR) administration duration of corticosteroid treatment was 8 (4\u201312) days. Multiple organ dysfunctions were more common in the steroid group than in the non-steroid group. Multivariate analysis that adjusted for major mortality-associated variables and propensity score indicated that corticosteroid treatment was independent from overall mortality (adjusted OR 1.05; 95% CI 0.15\u20137.46). One hundred forty-seven (60%) had dyspnea and 87 (36%) had ARDS, and subgroup analyses revealed corticosteroid treatment was not associated with 28-day mortality (both, P > 0.3). Sixty-two patients in 31 pairs were matched (Table 1), and 28-day mortality rate was 39% in case subjects and 16% in control subjects (P = 0.09). Likewise, addition of adjuvant corticosteroid therapy to standard antiviral treatment was not associated with 28-day mortality (P = 0.17; Fig. 1). However, increased corticosteroid dosage was significantly associated with elevated mortality risk after adjustment for administration duration (P = 0.003); every 10-mg increase in dosage was associated with additional 4% mortality risk (adjusted HR 1.04, 95% CI 1.01\u20131.07).\n",

Second, PSM is limited by adjusting for observed covariables only; randomized placebo-controlled trials are therefore warranted. Altogether, our investigation indicated limited effect of corticosteroid therapy could pose to overall survival of critically ill patients with COVID-19. Given the adverse effects, corticosteroid therapy must be commenced with caution, and prudent dosage should be promoted under certain circumstances.",
