However, their model-based calculations used the number of patients known on March 6, and the numbers of patients and deaths are continuously changing. Attempting to reach a more up-to-date estimate of the expected number of patients in Egypt, we used other assumptions according to real-life data.",

RT-PCR was done in nasopharyngeal swabs from symptomatic patients and contacts of confirmed cases traced in the preceding 2 weeks. In patients with a high rate of suspicion, the test was repeated after 48 h. Screening at airports included body temperature and clinical assessment and the use of a rapid diagnostic test for anti-severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 IgM and IgG. Deaths from influenza-like illness were also reviewed.",

To estimate the expected disease burden in Egypt, we used fatality rates in the USA and Germany, because they applied open screening, and in regional countries with conditions similar to those of Egypt (Algeria, Bahrain, Iran, Israel, Jordan, Saudi Arabia, Lebanon, Morocco, Palestine, Qatar, Tunisia, Turkey, and United Arab Emirates). On the basis of WHO's report on March 31,4 the fatality rate of all reported countries ranged from 0\u00b77% to 11\u00b78%. We deduced a factor by dividing our fatality rate by the global rate and those of the listed countries. This factor was then multiplied by our number of identified cases to estimate the expected total number (table\n).",
