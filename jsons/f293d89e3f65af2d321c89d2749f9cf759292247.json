We were fortunate to have Robin Spiller, an expert gastroenterologist with a focus on the pathophysiology of functional diseases and the role of infection and inflammation, to discuss etiology and non-operative management. Atypical diverticulitis was then addressed by Dieter Hahnloser, while Willem Bemelman emphasized the disruptive and progressive shift away from Hartmann's procedure in most emergency situations and the selective use of laparoscopic lavage, including purulent and fecal peritonitis. Broader adoption of primary resection and anastomosis, eventually associated with protective ileostomy, was thus supported in a talk thoroughly documented by an extensive literature review of the most recent trials [1] . Hartmann's procedure reversal can indeed lead to difficult operative situations and Roel Hompes detailed the technical options at hand. He underlined the improved outcomes of Des Winter speaks about the surgeon's personality-influence on decision-making, risk-taking, and outcomes minimally invasive approaches, in particular the benefit of a transanal approach when facing a short rectal stump, while he underlined the meticulous preoperative planning required in considering these options.",

These presentations echoed with this year's Lars P\u00e5hlman lecture concluding the second day of the congress. Herand Abcarian first broadcasted an interview with the late Lars P\u00e5hlman who discussed his genuine curiosity and passion for improving patients' lives and for rectal cancer surgery. Steve Wexner then gave an outstanding Lars P\u00e5hlman lecture (Fig. 5 ) and described the benefits and setting up of standardization and centralized accreditation of rectal cancer programs, along with the superior outcomes observed when using this approach in the United States [2] . Tuesday morning 3.12.2019 was dedicated to innovative approaches to complex oncologic situations. Amjad Parvaiz started off and compared the pros and cons of robotic rectal cancer surgery vs conventional laparoscopic surgery with unabated enthusiasm. Yet, the data available did not allow a firm conclusion, although ergonomic benefits for the surgeon were evident. Paris Tekkis then spoke about robotic multivisceral resections in locally advanced rectal cancer, which could expand the possibilities of minimally invasive resections in patients historically considered only for an open approach. Finally, Vic Verwaal, who has published randomized trials on cytoreductive surgery both in colorectal and ovarian cancers, summarized the lessons learned in two decades of practicing hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy.",

They revealed the early results of the FOxTROT randomized controlled trial, comparing neoadjuvant chemotherapy (6 weeks FOLFOX, surgery, then 18 weeks FOLFOX) to a standard approach (surgery followed by a 24 weeks FOLFOX protocol) for stages II-III colon cancer [3] . In 1\u2032052 patients, it resulted in histological downstaging and 50% reduction of incomplete resections, thus opening the way to a new approach in the armamentarium against advanced colon cancer. Of course, one of the main limitations of this approach is its non-applicability to obstructive colon cancer, which still accounts for a significant proportion of colon cancers. Discussing this clinical situation, Neil Mortensen's after lunch lecture-\"Rush to the OR or stent and dine?\"-showed that stents in obstructive colon cancer should be broadly considered, both as a bridge to curative surgery or as a palliative option with minimal impact on quality of life. With an obstruction relief rate of 82%, low complication and low stoma rates, and no oncological downsides, his thorough review advocates that surgeons to skip dinner less often.",

Innovative predictors of good surgical response were identified, such as microbiome modifications and response to the newest medical treatment. These variables impact the course of the disease and may be combined with established predictors into a decisional algorithm to individualize surgical approaches to Crohn's disease. Tailored care was also at the heart of the discussion on how to handle dysplasia in IBD, presented by Janindra Fig. 9 Festive evening of the #ECCStGalen 2019: there is more to remember-the chalet venue, live music, and a great ambiance made for a cheerful evening Warusavitarne, who devotes his practice exclusively to IBD patients. Justin Davies then gave a broad review of stateof-the-art practice in perianal Crohn's disease, emphasizing the importance of appropriate and immediate surgical care, including when necessary, a defunctionalizing stoma.

Through the prospective GOSAFE study [6] reporting 504 unselected elderly patients undergoing major oncologic surgery, he showed that one-third of these patients suffered functional decline 90 days after successful surgery. Functional decline correlated strongly with preoperative frailty evaluation, so that he advocated for a change in clinical practice, namely a systematic evaluation of frailty and a focus in the frail on quality of life improvement and functional recovery over classical oncologic outcomes.",

Picturing the great successes of this technology in medical diagnosis, he also underlined the challenges that artificial intelligence has to overcome in the specific field of surgery. The central limiting factor to date remains the difficulty gathering sufficient amount of high quality data in a field where every detail might count and have an impact on outcomes. Automated intraoperative data collection systems were presented that might solve this issue.",
