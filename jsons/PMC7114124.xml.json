Molecular mimicry (see Glossary) is a common and effective strategy, enabling a pathogen to usurp host protein function by resemblance 1, 2. Molecular mimicry varies over a continuum, from one extreme that includes sequence and structural similarity (i.e., orthologs) of entire proteins, to another extreme of chemical similarity at only a few localized sites, as is the case for short linear motifs (SLiMs). The growing body of literature on SLiMs indicates that some important virus\u2013host interactions can be attributed to a few well-chosen AAs 3, 4, 5, 6, 7. Rather than devote entire proteins to one function, SLiMs enable multifunctional viral proteins. Interactions between globular virus and host proteins have picomolar affinities, while SLiMs have micromolar binding affinities with globular host proteins [8]. Moderate binding affinity of SLiMs facilitates disruption of signaling interactions, rather than competing for stable formation of persistent protein complexes. Synthetic biology practitioners can benefit from an introduction to how SLiMs enable viral interference with host cell functions and computational resources available for SLiM analysis.",

            "text": "Viral SLiMs are potentially useful in synthetic biology, to provide a toolkit for new functions, for example, to modulate immune responses or to complement and interact with newly developed adjuvants in a synergistic manner [9]. Research efforts to develop broad-spectrum antiviral compounds or design broadly cross-protective vaccine immunogens benefit directly from knowledge of gene products, protein functions, and motifs involved with viral immune interference. N-linked glycosylation of the PNG sequon is a well-known example used by viral glycoproteins as camouflage against immune recognition 10, 11. The distribution of N-linked glycosylation sites has recently been recognized as essential for the design of immunogens to induce broadly cross-reactive immune protection against such challenging viruses as HIV-1 12, 13. Motifs associated with cellular trafficking (localization, transport, secretion, and sequestration) are readily edited to modify where expression products go, and change interaction profiles with other proteins [14]. In addition to motifs that stabilize the structure of immunogens, such as trimerization (\u2018foldon\u2019) 15, 16, 17, 18 and dimerization 19, 20\ndomains, motifs that interact with cellular processes for innate antiviral pathways could be used to enhance immunogenicity. While SLiMs in eukaryotic proteins have been discussed extensively, SLiM involvement in viral immunomodulation remains less thoroughly explored, and suggests new opportunities for use in engineered biotechnology applications.",

It may be necessary to evaluate risks of new functions by other means than taxonomy or even protein functional evaluations.

Different instances of a given SLiM can vary in sequence while maintaining the overall functional profile, that is, the regular expression for the sequence motif, where a few positions are invariant while other positions tolerate numerous substitutions. Thus, partial sequence matches are sufficient for transient binding interactions with target domains, for example, signal transduction proteins. This observation led to the proposal of ex nihilo SLiM evolution \u2013 the evolution of a novel SLiM \u2018from nothing\u2019 \u2013 the appearance of a new functional module from a previously nonfunctional region of protein sequence [24]. Because hosts\u2019 interaction networks are often conserved, SLiMs represent a significant vulnerability for opportunistic exploitation. These properties enable pathogens to acquire host-like SLiMs rapidly through ex nihilo convergent evolution, to rewire host interaction networks, and to acquire tropism and virulence traits needed for successful adaptation and propagation [25].

The cytoplasmic tail of this membrane-bound protein includes PxxPxP and PxQxT motifs that recruit signaling proteins (JAK3, that is, Janus kinase 3, and several TRAFs, tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factors, respectively) [5]. Together, the motifs mimic the cytoplasmic domain of CD40 to activate nuclear factor-\u03baB via intermediates, including a third motif YYD$ (where $ denotes the C terminus), the TRADD (tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated death domain) binding domain. The overall result is that LMP1 inhibits apoptosis and infected B cell proliferation, to confer viral persistence [5].

Protein function is captured broadly in such a framework, though the nuanced details of interactions with other molecules are not localized to domains or motifs.Box 1The ViralZone Ontology Outlines Viral Protein FunctionA bridge that links literature reports to GO term annotation, ViralZone is an online knowledge base that contains \u2018textbook\u2019 information about viral taxonomy, replication, genome organization, and virion structure, and provides links to viral sequence data 62, 63. Importantly, ViralZone staff collaborate with the GO Consortium to define entries for virus-specific molecular functions 63, 64, 65, 66. ViralZone cross-references its keywords with GO Consortium terms and UniProt [67] identifiers. This makes it possible to search for viral proteins by their functional role.ViralZone staff have developed GO concepts specifically for viruses, to represent the diversity of viral replication and processes involved with viral entry, replication, and egress [66]. ViralZone staff have also developed a detailed listing of virus\u2013host interactions, with entries for 65 functions and 57 GO terms 64, 65. Each entry (\u2018keyword\u2019) has a unique identifier. Unlike Enzyme Commission (EC) numbers [68], ViralZone IDs are arbitrary numbers and do not indicate position in the concept hierarchy. Instead, organization of the keyword hierarchy is provided online. The web address https://viralzone.expasy.org/886 is an entry point into the ViralZone concept space (Figure I).\nAlt-text: Box 1",

In [38], they discuss this issue in depth, and recommend a workflow for SLiM discovery that culminates in experimental validation, whether in vivo or in vitro.

            "text": "Searching arbitrary sequences for motif instances is computationally straightforward. Box 3\nprovides an example of motif searching with ELM, which might facilitate comparative analysis of two related proteins from different species of human herpesvirus (HSV). Resources such as InterPro and UniProt are able to perform similar assessments, but give broader, domain-level representations with less functional detail than the SLiM searches enabled by ELM. Reports in the primary literature take a different approach, by marking SLiMs in a protein alignment, which includes orthologues to mark conservation (e.g., Figure 3 in [39]). The ELM-generated report combines predicted SLiMs with information from annotated domains and local disorder predictions, for a perspective that complements the other approaches.Box 3Motif Searches Enable Comparison of Neurovirulence ProteinsHSV-1 and HSV-2 virulence factor ICP34.5 assists in viral immune evasion by molecular mimicry. HSV-1 neurovirulence protein ICP34.5, encoded by the \u03b334.5 gene, initiates immune interference by binding and sequestering cellular proteins that would stimulate autophagy, translational arrest, and type I interferon responses. HSV-1 ICP34.5 binds TANK-binding kinase 1 (TBK1) to prevent type I interferon induction [75], Beclin-1 to prevent autophagy [76], and both PP1\u03b1 and eIF2\u03b1 to overcome translational arrest [77]. HSV-2 \u03b334.5 contains an intron not present in HSV-1, and up to four isoforms of HSV-2 ICP34.5 are known [78]. Full-length HSV-2 ICP34.5 has conserved PP1\u03b1 and eIF2\u03b1-binding domains, but lacks TBK1 and Beclin-1 binding domains [79]. Additional HSV-1 motifs influence intracellular localization [80], virion maturation, and egress [81], not yet characterized in HSV-2. HSV-2 is recognized as more virulent than HSV-1, but both can cause neuropathology, including viral encephalitis and meningitis [82]. To attenuate virulence, ICP34.5 is routinely deleted or inactivated when making HSV-1 constructs for oncolytic therapy [82]. Both are the same length and share domain structures, and partially share SLiM compositions (Figure I). Identifying differences in SLiMs from each could provide clues for more detailed experimental investigations to understand ICP34.5 virulence determinants and host protein targets.Searching ELM for motif instances in HSV-2 ICP34.5 (UniProt P28283) gives 127 instances of 39 motif classes, before filtering to exclude globular domains and other likely false hits. Filtering leaves 97 instances, which cover almost all of this 261 AA protein except for a predicted globular domain of 73 AAs. A similar query for the HSV-1 protein (UniProt P08353) gives 158 instances of 42 distinct motifs, and 114 instances of 36 motifs when filtered. Most of the ELM motif hits are probably false positives, if only because the motif expressions overlap. The patterns (.RK)|(RR[\u02c6KR]), [KR]R., and R...[KR]R., RRGPRRR, MSRRR, and RR all match sites in the first tenAA positions of the HSV-2 query protein sequence, a low-complexity region dominated by positively charged AAs. The HSV-1 version contains a 30 amino acid ATP triplet repeat at sites 160\u2013190, not found in the HSV-2 protein. ELM matches four motifs here, only one of which (DOC_CKS1_1) is unique to HSV-1.\nAlt-text: Box 3",

A program called SLiMPrints works around this with a specialized approach to model substitutions [42]. SLiMPrints uses a statistical model of relative local conservation, which looks for clusters of overly constrained sites in a window of about 30 AAs, using IUPred scores (intrinsically unordered prediction; see later) to weigh sites in intrinsically disordered protein regions more heavily than sites in globular (ordered) regimes [42].",

An important caveat is that to assume such sequences are independent could yield spurious enrichment of shared patterns, so alignment-free methods need to compensate for evolutionary constraints at the domain level, rather than for full-length homologous proteins. The development of such corrections and their relative advantages are detailed in [40]. Some programs (e.g., SLiMDisc [43], SLiMFinder 44, 45, and DILIMOT 46, 47) produce regular expressions that compensate for phylogenetic relatedness, while others (MEME suite, GLAM2 [48], and NestedMICA 49, 50) produce probabilistic profiles.

Another widely used approach is to identify regions of local disorder, where protein structure is not clearly defined, making that region accessible to interact with other proteins. IUPred [54] is commonly used for this task, though the choice of parameter settings and how to interpret results varies. ELM results include an IUPred disorder score and a simple cutoff of 0.5 to define the disorder transition.

Restricting the sequence region that is used for permutation testing, such as by use of structural considerations, can further focus the search. Indeed, such a hybrid filtering approach was described recently and evaluated on the HIV-1 proteome [57]. Following methods described in an earlier study [58], Becerra et al. used IUPred with a modified, window-based scoring procedure to identify intrinsically disordered protein regions, and tested for statistical rarity below 1% of 1000 shuffled variants. The approach further considered conservation above 70% in a set of aligned sequences, though combining three filtering criteria was too stringent and excluded all motif candidates [57].",

LC3-interacting regions (LIR motifs) are SLiMs that mediate protein\u2013protein interactions involved in autophagy, as used by influenza A virus M2 protein to subvert autophagy and maintain virion stability [60]. Using curated text mining analysis and position-specific scoring matrices, iLIR@viral analyzed 16 609 reviewed viral sequences available from UniProt across 2569 individual viral species and found that 15 589 viral sequences contain LIR motifs.

Such knowledge is needed in an era where synthetic biology may introduce new risks for biological error and biological terror. Detecting and understanding SLiM variants can help to reduce such risks and identify newly emerging threats to global health and security because watch lists for harmful organisms to ensure public safety by preventing access to select known risks may be inadequate 21, 22, 23.",

            "text": "SLiMs in viral proteins can interact in many different ways with host proteins to modulate immune responses. A motif may be necessary but not sufficient for any inferred function. The simplest case is where a viral SLiM interacts directly with a host protein to yield an immunomodulated phenotype. More elaborate cases are known, such as the multifunctional proteins E1A (EBV), Nef (HIV-1), and ICP34.5 (HSV). Computational prediction of SLiM classes and new instances is a process, which involves experimental confirmation and validation. High-throughput methods for experimental assessment of protein interactions are useful to validate computational predictions 38, 61, and more assays are needed to evaluate functional and phenotypic effects of adding or deleting SLiMs.Outstanding QuestionsWhat incentives or community-based activities would best enable integration of specialized viral gene ontologies with databases of motif classes and instances? To validate new SLiMs, what are the needed procedures, which simultaneously minimize spurious results and make the most promising candidates available to use and discover new instances?How prevalent are immunomodulatory motifs in viruses, relative to the prevalence of entire viral proteins dedicated to this specialized function? To what extent can viral immunomodulatory function be localized to a motif or domain, or is the larger whole-protein context necessary for function?What types of motif interactions are most common and important for viral immune modulation? Are they accurately reflected in the current literature and databases, or do many new types of motifs still await discovery?Is there sound support for an enrichment (or scarcity) of particular motif types in certain viral classes (i.e., Baltimore classification)? If so, what does this reveal about commonalities among viral replication strategies and potential for broad-spectrum antiviral treatments?What host countermeasures are involved with overcoming viral immune interference, either in general against many viruses, or in particular, against specific taxa? Do these countermeasures explain some of the crosstalk among interactions in antiviral innate signaling pathways?The distribution of glycosylation sites on enveloped viruses can be extremely variable, even within one host. Such variation may impede bioengineering specific constructs. How are SLiMs influenced by dynamic evolutionary processes? What fitness costs are associated with SLiM evolution? What specific constraints limit SLiM evolvability?What strategies are most effective to advance knowledge of viral immunomodulatory SLiMs in the design of vaccines and therapies to promote global health? For example, can some viral peptides be useful as adjuvants?Alt-text: Outstanding Questions\n",
