Sputum is representative of the lower respiratory tract but is used rarely for viral testing. The aim of this study was to compare the detection rates of respiratory viruses from nasopharyngeal swabs and sputum using a multiplex real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Adults who were admitted or presented to the clinics of Gil Medical Center with acute respiratory symptoms were recruited from 1 November 2012 to 31 March 2013. Paired specimens of nasopharyngeal swabs and sputum were obtained from 154 subjects, and RNA was extracted and tested for 16 different respiratory viruses using the Anyplex II RV16 Detection kit (Seegene, Seoul, Korea). The positive rate was 53% (81/154) for nasopharyngeal swabs and 68% (105/154) for sputum (P < 0.001). One hundred thirty-four viruses were identified for 107 illnesses. Influenza A virus, RSV A, HRV, coronavirus OC43, and adenovirus were detected more frequently in sputum samples than in nasopharyngeal swabs (P < 0.001). Importantly, 12 of 44 (27%) influenza A infections and 11 of 27 (41%) RSV infections were positive in only sputum samples. The detection rates of respiratory viruses from sputum samples were significantly higher than those from nasopharyngeal swabs in adults using realtime multiplex RT-PCR. These findings suggest that sputum would benefit for the detection of respiratory viruses by nucleic acid amplification tests (NAATs) in patients who produce sputum. Further studies are needed to establish standardized RNA extraction methods from sputum samples.",

            "text": "Adequate specimen collection is important for the diagnosis of respiratory viral infections. A variety of upper respiratory samples, including nasal aspirates, nasal swabs, nasopharyngeal swabs, and oropharyngeal swabs, are used commonly for the detection of respiratory viruses. Early studies suggested that nasal aspirates were superior to swab specimens [Lieberman et al., 2009] ; however, this might not be true for all respiratory viruses and all detection methods. In addition, several studies have shown that respiratory viruses are an increasingly recognized cause of lower respiratory tract infections. In those cases, lower respiratory specimens should be collected for the detection of respiratory viruses.",

            "text": "Sputum is the representative of lower respiratory secretions and is the most widely accepted specimen for the diagnosis of bacterial respiratory infection. However, it is used rarely for the detection of respiratory viruses using traditional methods such as the viral antigen test or viral culture. With nucleic acid amplification tests (NAATs), sputum samples have been used for the detection of respiratory pathogens. Currently, few data comparing the diagnostic yields of nasopharyngeal swabs and sputum samples for respiratory virus detection have been published. The present study found that the overall detection rate from sputum samples in adults was significantly higher than from nasopharyngeal swabs using multiplex real-time RT-PCR. This finding is consistent with the result of a previous study that sputum samples showed higher diagnostic yields than nose-throat swabs in adults using RT-PCR [Falsey et al., 2012] . The detection rates of respiratory virus from sputum and nasopharyngeal swabs were 68% and 53%, respectively. Generally, it is hard to compare detection rates of respiratory viruses because of differences in testing methods, specimen types (upper or lower airways, swabs or washes, nose or throat, flocked or regular swabs), and types of transport media. Our results are still relatively high compared with those of other reports [Lieberman et al., 2009; Falsey et al., 2012; Yu et al., 2012] . These differences can be explained by several factors. First, the Anyplex II RV16 Detection kit is a multiplex real-time RT-PCR assay that can detect simultaneously 16 different types of viruses. This kit offers higher sensitivity in the detection of traditionally diagnosed respiratory viruses in addition to the ability to detect newly recognized viruses, such as HBoV, PIV 1, and HRV C. Second, nasopharyngeal samplings were obtained using flocked swabs in the present study, and it is known that flocked swabs can collect significantly more epithelial cells, thus providing higher positive rates than conventional swabs [Loens et al., 2009 ]. Third, this study was performed during an influenza A (H1N1) outbreak season in Korea.",

A prior study compared the yields of paired nose-throat swabs and endotracheal aspirates [Roa et al., 2012] . The current study also found that 32 of 44 (73%) influenza cases were detected in nasopharyngeal swabs, and 43 of 44 (98%) cases were detected in sputum samples. Similarly, 11 of 27 (41%) RSV A infections were positive in only sputum samples. These findings suggest that traditional nasopharyngeal diagnostic techniques can miss cases of lower respiratory tract infections. Multiple respiratory viruses have been detected in 10-30% of patients with positive viral detection, with higher rates in young children [Drews et al., 2008; Kim et al., 2009; Gharabaghi et al., 2011; Zhang et al., 2012] . In this study, co-infections in sputum samples were more common than those in nasopharyngeal swabs (19% vs. 6%). One unanticipated finding was that influenza A and RSV A were found frequently in mixed infections. These results are contrary to other reports that HBoV and coronavirus were most commonly associated with multiple-agent infections, while influenza virus and RSV were least often detected in the presence of another virus [Gharabaghi et al., 2011] . These differences can be explained, in part, by the differences in specimen types and applied methods. The clinical significance of co-infections is still unknown, and further evaluation is required.",

            "text": "Some problems are encountered when handling sputum for NAATs. First, the highly viscous nature of sputum can make nucleic acid extraction difficult. Therefore, pre-treatment of sputum samples is needed, but no standardized pre-treatment procedure is available for viral detection. Dithiothreitol or NALC (N-acetyl-L-cysteine)-NaOH, which are used generally for the digestion of sputum in mycobacterial laboratories, may cause substantial loss of RNA due to the repetitive washing and pipetting steps in the procedures [Desjardin et al., 1996; Xiang et al., 2001] . In this study, sputum samples were diluted with PBS and mixed by vortexing, and the volume and time depended on the sputum viscosity. This procedure was sufficient for sputum homogenization. Another problem is that NAAT inhibitors in respiratory specimens may affect the sensitivity of the assay or lead to false-negative results. Inhibition of the amplification of the internal control was noted in 15% of the sputum samples, which is a high proportion compared with that of nasopharyngeal swabs (3%). A widely applied method for the removal of PCR inhibitors is sample dilution, which may lead to decreased inhibitors. In the present study, samples that showed invalid PCR results were diluted with twice the initial volume of PBS and re-extracted manually. In the author's experience, thoroughly mixing and homogenization of sputum samples might be important to obtain valid results. However, further evaluations of nucleic acid extraction methods in automated systems for sputum samples are needed.",
