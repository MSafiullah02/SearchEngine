This paper employs computational multiphase fluid dynamics and heat transfer to investigate transport, dispersion, and evaporation of saliva particles arising from a human cough. An ejection process of saliva droplets in air was applied to mimic the real event of a human cough. We employ an advanced three-dimensional model based on fully coupled Eulerian-Lagrangian techniques that take into account the relative humidity, turbulent dispersion forces, droplet phase-change, evaporation, and breakup in addition to the droplet-droplet and droplet-air interactions. We computationally investigate the effect of wind speed on social distancing. For a mild human cough in air at 20 \u25cb C and 50% relative humidity, we found that human saliva-disease-carrier droplets may travel up to unexpected considerable distances depending on the wind speed. When the wind speed was approximately zero, the saliva droplets did not travel 2 m, which is within the social distancing recommendations. However, at wind speeds varying from 4 km/h to 15 km/h, we found that the saliva droplets can travel up to 6 m with a decrease in the concentration and liquid droplet size in the wind direction. Our findings imply that considering the environmental conditions, the 2 m social distance may not be sufficient. Further research is required to quantify the influence of parameters such as the environment's relative humidity and temperature among others.",

            "text": "When sneezing or coughing, larger droplets are formed by saliva and smaller droplets by the mucous coating of the lungs and vocal cords. The smaller droplets are often invisible to the naked eye. Past research has shown that most respiratory droplets do not travel independently on their trajectories. Instead, droplets in a continuum of sizes are trapped and carried forward within a moist, warm, turbulent cloud of gas. 1 In another study, it was shown that as people raise their voice, they emit more droplets, but the size distribution of the droplets remains the same. 2 Furthermore, researchers have shown that even breathing could release potentially infectious aerosols. 3 They have captured the large droplets produced when sneezing and coughing as well as the aerosol droplets produced when sneezing, coughing, breathing, and talking on different surfaces. Yan et al. 3 showed that the flu virus exists even in the tiny droplets resulting from breathing or talking alone. Although the mechanisms of transmission are still under debate, it is widely accepted that aerosol or respiratory droplet transmission is the critical factor for the rapid spread and continued circulation of influenza A virus in humans. 4 The National Academies Standing Committee on Emerging Infectious Diseases and 21st Century Health Threats has considered whether the SARS-CoV-2 virus could be spread through conversation, in addition to the transmission due to sneeze/cough droplets. 5 As Beans 6 reported, the team determined that the current evidence supports the possibility that SARS-CoV-2 could spread through aerosolized droplets released via patients' exhalations. 5 However,",

The size distribution adopted by the authors is shown in Fig. 1 . It corresponds to a fit law for the data obtained by Ref. 8, fitted by the Rosin-Rammler distribution law, 11 also known as Weibull distribution. 12 The Weibull distribution works well for distributing cloud droplets, 13 including water and water-like droplets. The theoretical background can be found. 14 Figure 1 (red curve) shows the Weibull's law of probability density function f. The fitting parameters are given by f = n dp \u239b \u239d dp dp",

The ground surface temperature (GST) of 15 \u25cb C is somehow arbitrary because, in winter/spring season, the ground surface temperature is lower than the air temperature and the opposite in the summer/autumn season. Therefore, we considered GST = Tair \u2212 5 \u25cb C. However, the 5 \u25cb C may vary from region to region and also depends on the soil properties. We aimed to approximate as much as possible a real situation in winter/spring seasons. Further investigation is required to quantify the effects of GST, 35 as well as relative humidity and ambient air temperature. Figure 7 shows the evolution of human saliva droplets, taking into account the dispersion, evaporation, breakup, and droplet settling. After 49 s, all droplets did not exceed a horizontal distance of 1 m away from the mouth. At the time of 49 s, some droplets appear at 0.77 m above the ground. At the time of 10 s, one can witness the circulation of the droplet cloud, which can be explained by its closeness to the body that plays the role of a stationary wall of no-slip like the ground surface. Also critical is that the droplets take about 15 s to fall below the human waist level, which is considered as a safe vertical distance. In the case of no wind, young children will be most vulnerable in the close vicinity of the falling droplet cloud.",

Complex phase change and transport phenomena such as evaporation and droplet breakup occur at different rates depending on the environmental conditions and on the intensity of the cough. After 5 s from the occurrence of cough, the droplet cloud loses mass, and minimum size reduces progressively until total disappearance at a critical time >5 s. Figure 8 (a) enlightens another interesting phenomenon, which is the vertical stretching of the droplet cloud while moving away from the mouth where some droplets nearly reach the ground at about t = 5 s. Moreover, at this low wind speed, we observe that the saliva droplet cloud remained below the horizontal line situated 1.63 m below the mouth. At the same environmental conditions, but with the wind speed increasing from \u22484 km/h to \u224815 km/h, we observe a different saliva droplet kinematics [ Fig. 8(b) ]. Under this wind speed of 15 km/h, the saliva droplets move away faster and reach 6 m in 1.6 s with an accelerating dispersion rate. Similarly, evaporation is accompanied by mass reduction in the saliva droplets, which we will discuss quantitatively in Sec. III C. Additionally, at a speed of 15 km/h, we observe that the droplet cloud is sheared and stretched along an axis, making an angle of about 45 \u25cb with the horizontal line situated at 1.63 m height. The results for 15 km/h reveal that saliva droplets exist above 1.63 m height due to dispersion for all times between approximately 0.4 s and 1.6 s. The droplet cloud [Figs. 8(a) and 8(b)] will affect both adults and children of different heights. The 1.63 m assumption leaves shorter adults and children at even higher risk.",

Different saliva droplet cloud kinematics may occur at different rates such as elongation, drifting, and rotation. The cloud kinematics is very complex and has several driving forces, which are the wind shearing rate, gravitational acceleration, turbulent dispersion, interaction forces manifested by breakup or coalescence, and stress forces manifested by a droplet's phase change or evaporation. At a low wind speed of 4 km/h [ Fig. 9(a) ], the saliva droplet cloud is advected in the wind direction with an increase in anticlockwise rotation between 0.1 s and 5 s. However, at a higher wind speed of 15 km/h [ Fig. 9(b) ], the saliva droplet cloud is advected in the wind direction with an increase in clockwise rotation between 0.1 s and 1.6 s and a 45 \u25cb angle with the horizontal line at z = 1.63. The above transport evolution is explained by a reversal of the competition between some of the force ratios, e.g., wind shearing, dispersion, and settling forces.

The evaporation process mainly causes the reduction in the D10 saliva droplet diameter but is also accompanied by droplet breakup and coalescence that may occur at different rates and as a function of the wind shearing intensity and the turbulent dispersion force. Nevertheless, the quantification of D10 does not constitute a critical parameter in terms of airborne virus disease transmission compared to the maximum saliva droplet size. Bigger droplets may carry smaller virus particles and thus constitute more danger or risk in terms of airborne disease transmission between humans. Thus, the maximum saliva droplet diameter was quantified and plotted in Fig. 11 as a function of time. The maximum saliva droplet diameter Dmax decreased with time from 111 \u03bcm to 82 \u03bcm at different rates. As the wind speed increases, the Dmax reduction is observed to be faster.

Thus, these droplets may not constitute a risk regarding facial contact of adults at this distance. 2. At wind speeds from 4 km/h to 15 km/h, we found that saliva droplets can travel to distances up to 6 m with a decrease in concentrations and liquid droplet size in the wind direction. Our findings imply that depending on the environmental conditions, the 2 m social distance may not suffice. Further research is required to quantify the influence of other parameters such as the environment relative humidity and temperature among others. 3. The droplet cloud will affect both adults and children of different heights. Shorter adults and children could be at higher risk if they are located within the trajectory of falling droplets. 4.

This finding indicates that at moderate wind speed, exposure to the droplet cloud can be longer, thus potentially increasing virus transmission risk. InFigs. 11 and 13, the last points are dropping from the distributions because the droplets have approached the outlet, which is the limit of the computational domain at 6 m. Similar data trends are observed in the literature when investigating evaporation of water droplets.36",
