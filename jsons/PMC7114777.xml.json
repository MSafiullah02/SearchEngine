Agronomic Se biofortification is another alternative, whereby the Se concentration of forages is increased through the use of Se-containing fertilizer amendments (Whelan, 1989; M\u00e4kel\u00e4 et al., 1993; Broadley et al., 2006; Hall et al., 2011). It has been previously demonstrated that agronomic Se biofortification is an effective strategy to improve immunity and performance in Se-replete weaned beef calves; weaned beef calves had increased J-5 Escherichia coli antibody titers, lower mortality, and greater slaughter weights with Se biofortification (Hall et al., 2013a,b). In newborn dairy calves, Hall et al. (2014) have shown that supranutritional maternal and colostral Se supplementation, albeit using Se yeast or sodium selenite, respectively, improves passive transfer of IgG and, ultimately, the health of newborn calves.",

The application rates were chosen based on a previous study (Hall et al., 2013a). Third-cutting alfalfa hay was harvested 40 d after Se application and then analyzed for nutrient and Se content (Table 1). Alfalfa yield was approximately 4.45 t/ha. A Penn State forage sampler was used to take 25 cores from random bales in each hay source (0, 45.0, or 89.9 g Se/ha). Samples were collected prior to beginning the feeding trial for each alfalfa hay source. Core samples were blended, and representative samples were selected for analysis. Alfalfa hay samples were submitted to commercial laboratories for analysis. Hay samples were prepared for Se analysis as described by Davis et al. (2012), and Se was determined using inductively coupled argon plasma emission spectroscopy (ELAN 6000; PerkinElmer Inc., Shelton, CT). Quantification of Se was performed by the standard addition method, using a 4-point standard curve. A quality-control sample (in a similar matrix) was analyzed after every 5 samples, and an analysis was considered acceptable if the Se concentration of the quality-control sample fell within \u00b15% of the standard/reference value for the quality control.",

Normal distribution was tested using the Shapiro\u2013Wilks test and graphical diagnostics of the Quantile-Quantile plot. The colostral IgG1 concentrations lacked homogeneity of variance and, therefore, were analyzed with a t test using the Satterthwaite approximation for heterogeneous variance. The linear response of the dependent variables (Se forage content, colostral or WB Se concentrations in beef cows, and WB Se concentrations in beef calves) to the independent variable (Se fertilization rate) were evaluated using univariate regression in PROC REG. Pearson and Spearman correlation coefficients were calculated to examine the associations among variables. The effect of Se-fortified alfalfa on cow and calf WB Se concentrations, colostral and calf serum IgG1 concentrations and J-5 E. coli antibody titers, and calf BW were measured using PROC GLM for 1-time measurements and PROC MIXED and an unstructured variance\u2013covariance structure for repeated measurements within animal. The unstructured variance\u2013covariance matrix provided the most parsimonious variance\u2013covariance matrix based on the lowest value by the Akaike information criterion. Fixed effects in the models were Se application rate (0, 45.0, and 89.9 g Se/ha) and, for repeated measurements, were time within animal and the time \u00d7 Se application rate interaction.

            "text": "In cattle, IgG1 is the predominant immunoglobulin isotype in colostrum and is derived from serum (Butler, 1983; Baumrucker et al., 2010). Calves are born with a digestive tract that facilitates absorption of colostral proteins instead of degrading them (Hardy, 1969). The level of proteolytic activity is low and further decreased by trypsin inhibitors in colostrum (Quigley et al., 1995). Small intestinal epithelial cells absorb colostral IgG1 via pinocytosis, and IgG1 proteins pass through enterocytes into lacteals (Patt, 1977; Weaver et al., 2000). From the lacteals, colostral proteins reach the systemic circulation, which allows newborn calves to receive maternal IgG1 by passive transfer (Patt, 1977; Weaver et al., 2000). The period during which the intestine is permeable to IgG1 varies but is highest immediately after birth, declines after 6 h, and drops to relatively low levels by 24 h, signaling gut closure to passive transport (Quigley and Drewry, 1998). Peak serum IgG1 concentrations are normally reached 32 h postpartum because of ongoing transport of immunoglobulins across the enterocytes (Stott et al., 1979). After absorption ceases, concentrations of passively acquired IgG1 begin to decline through normal turnover processes (Chappuis, 1998). Calves that fail to adequately suckle possess low concentrations of IgG1 in their serum. Failure of passive transfer predisposes calves to infection, sepsis, and death (Patt, 1977; Weaver et al., 2000).",

Previously, researchers have shown that feeding cows forage fertilized with sodium selenate (known as agronomic biofortification) elevates WB Se content (Hall et al., 2011; S\u00e9boussi et al., 2016), whereas dietary supplementation with sodium selenite alone does not yield as high of WB Se concentrations (Hall et al., 2011). Others have shown that supplementation of organic (Se yeast) or inorganic (sodium selenate) Se to late gestation and early lactation beef cows has no effect on cow performance, milk production, or reproductive efficiency (Muegge et al., 2016). Feeding supranutritional amounts of Se yeast increased colostral Se concentrations in ewes (Stewart et al., 2012) and in dairy cows (Hall et al., 2014). The findings with Se-biofortified alfalfa hay corroborate these earlier organic Se yeast studies, as cows receiving Se-biofortified alfalfa hay (89.9 g Se/ha) had 192% greater WB Se and 1,023% greater colostral Se concentrations compared with Control cows. Colostral Se concentrations were enriched in cows receiving Se biofortified hay, which indicates that supranutritional Se may be incorporated at increased rates into colostral proteins for potential Se storage. In addition, colostral Se concentrations were less in Control cows compared with their corresponding WB Se concentrations, which indicates that although Control cows were Se replete, additional Se was not incorporated into colostral proteins. Future studies are needed to evaluate the ratio of colostral Se to WB Se concentrations with regard to overall Se status of the animal.",

Weekly drenching of ewes with organic Se yeast at supranutritional amounts for 1 yr resulted in greater colostral Se concentrations and greater colostral IgG concentrations than ewes receiving the maximum U.S. Food and Drug Administration\u2013allowed concentration (Stewart et al., 2012, 2013).

Similarly, Swanson et al. (2008) showed that Se supplementation (organically bound Se containing pellets; adequate Se, <0.5 mg of Se/kg of DM fed at 9.5 \u00b5g/kg BW, vs. high Se, 60 mg of Se/kg of DM fed at 81.8 \u00b5g/kg BW) had no effect on colostral IgG concentrations in pregnant ewe lambs. It is likely that the Se status of the cows, the form of Se administered (organic vs. inorganic), and the rate of Se supplementation (duration of feeding and concentration of Se in forage) are all important in determining whether an effect on colostral IgG concentration is observed. Based on the current results, forage Se provides a linear dose vs. time supplementation strategy for increasing IgG concentrations in colostrum.",

(2007) found that direct addition of 3 mg of sodium selenite/kg colostrum increased serum concentrations of IgG in neonatal dairy calves by 42% at 48 h but that the concentrations did not differ at 14 d. Similarly, adding 3 mg of sodium selenite/kg to colostrum increased serum IgG concentrations in calves by 32% at 48 h and by 33% at 14 d, whereas feeding colostrum from Se yeast\u2013supplemented cows did not affect serum IgG concentrations in calves (Hall et al., 2014). A limitation of the current study is that serum concentrations of IgG1 and J-5 E. coli antibody concentrations at 14 d of age were not measured. Recent research shows that supranutritional Se supplementation has positive effects on the persistence of IgG1 in calf serum. Rodinova et al. (2008) found that Se supplementation (organically bound in the biomass of an alga; dosed at 180 \u00b5g Se/ewe daily) of pregnant ewes resulted in greater concentrations of serum IgG at 30 and 60 d of age compared with untreated controls. Hall et al. (2014) found that calves born to dairy cows receiving surpanutritional Se yeast supplementation during the last 8 wk of pregnancy had greater serum IgG concentrations at 48 h, 14 d, and 60 d of age. As such, Se may be more important for its long-term effects on maintaining IgG1 concentrations in calves vs. its short-term effects on maximizing passive transfer.",

If one were to feed pregnant cattle supranutritional concentrations of Se, their colostrum could be collected and administered to calves deemed too weak to suckle to minimize losses resulting from failure of passive transfer. Likewise, if a weak calf consumed only a small amount of colostrum from its mother, colostrum from a cow with high concentrations of IgG1 would be beneficial because increased IgG1 ingestion is the primary means to prevent failure of passive transfer.",

            "text": "In plants, Se is incorporated into methionine as selenomethionine, and when forage is consumed by livestock, Se from selenomethionine is converted into and then incorporated as selenocysteine into selenoproteins. The linear relationship between Se fertilizer application rate and forage Se concentration observed in this study is similar to what we have previously reported (Hall et al., 2009, 2013a). Plants, including alfalfa, absorb sodium selenate from the soil and synthesize selenoamino acids, with selenomethionine being the major selenocompound in forage legumes (Whanger, 2002). Plant species, chemical source of Se applied, and soil pH, sulfur, and iron content may alter Se availability for plant uptake as reviewed by the NRC (1983, 2007). These results suggest that Se content of soil, determined by Se application rate, is the primary determinant of Se content of common forage species. Future studies are needed to evaluate in greater detail the Se flow between fertilizer, soil, and plant. In the current experiment, there was a linear relationship between Se fertilizer application rate (g Se/ha) and forage Se concentration (mg Se/kg DM), which extends to cow WB, colostrum, and calf WB Se concentrations (ng/mL). Future experiments are needed to determine whether these mathematical relationships are consistent between experiments. Because of the linear relationship, another interesting finding was that cow WB Se concentrations were similar after 10 wk \u00b1 16 d in Med-Se cows (consuming 45.0 g Se/ha) compared with 4 wk in High-Se cows (consuming 89.9 g Se/ha) alfalfa hay. Therefore, it may be possible to predict desired WB Se concentrations based on forage Se content and duration of feed consumption.",
