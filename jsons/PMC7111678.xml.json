Outbreaks of IBV can cause significant economic loss, particularly for commercial egg producers (Cavanagh, 2007, Jackwood and de Wit, 2013).",

Many serotypes of IBV are known and cross-protection between serotypes is poor (Darbyshire, 1980, Hopkins, 1974, Sjaak de Wit et al., 2011). For this reason, poultry growers must match their vaccination program with circulating IBV strains in their area. In the United States, the most common serotype isolated in the field is the Arkansas (Ark)-type IBV (Jackwood et al., 2005). Currently, only ArkDPI (Arkansas Delmarva Poultry Industry) vaccine is commercially available against Ark-type IBV. The ArkDPI vaccine was originally attenuated by passage of the virus in embryonated eggs 100+ times (Gelb and Cloud, 1983). Experimental and field trials using ArkDPI vaccine have shown that ArkDPI does not provide adequate protection (Jackwood et al., 2009, Roh et al., 2013). One reason may be because ArkDPI vaccine virus does not replicate well in chicks when applied by hatchery spray cabinet (Roh et al., 2014). Moreover, it has been shown that the ArkDPI vaccine persists in the flock (Jackwood et al., 2009) causing a rolling reaction, wherein transmission of the vaccine virus continuously occurs between birds (McElreath et al., 2013).",

These are a change from tyrosine to histidine at position 43 (Y43H) and a deletion of an asparagine residue at position 344 (\u2206344) (McKinley et al., 2008, Ndegwa et al., 2012, Toro et al., 2012b, van Santen and Toro, 2008). We hypothesize that these amino acid changes provide the virus a selective advantage in the chicken host. We chose to study the Y43H and \u2206344 changes using recombinant S1 proteins, but it should be recognized that other amino acid changes in the S1 spike protein (eg. residue 213) found in many of the subpopulations from vaccinated chickens (van Santen and Toro, 2008), could also provide a selective advantage in the chicken host. Although the Y43H change and \u2206344 are both found in birds up to 13 days post-vaccination and \u2206344 can be found in contact exposed birds (one transmission event) up to 13 days post-exposure (McKinley et al., 2008), it is not clear if one or both are found after many transmission events from one bird to the next.",

Recombinant S1 spike protein with the Y43H change demonstrated differential binding to mature chicken tracheas and to embryonic chorioallantoic membrane tissue. Additionally, S1 spike protein with \u2206344 was unable to bind ArkDPI serotype-specific sera, demonstrating that \u2206344 alters antigenicity. Taken together, these results help to explain the selection of these polymorphisms in re-isolated ArkDPI vaccine viruses. It appears that the Y43H and \u2206344 changes offer selective advantages over the ArkDPI vaccine virus by enhancing binding to host tissue, thereby increasing infectivity (Y43H); and by evading the immune response by altering antigenicity of the spike (\u2206344).",

The primary ArkDPI vaccine spike (Y43/N344), the spike with \u2206344, and the spike with both sequence changes (Y43H and \u2206344) have considerably less binding to the mature tracheal tissue. It is interesting that the S1 spike protein containing both Y43H and \u2206344 had poor binding to trachea. This shows that while Y43H enhances binding to trachea, it cannot enhance binding in the presence of \u2206344 perhaps due to a conformational change associated with the deletion.

These polymorphisms enable a virus population either to bind robustly onto different host tissues, in the case of Y43H; or to evade neutralization by antibodies from the host, in the case of \u2206344. In this manner, these amino acid changes enhance the virus population's overall fitness in vaccinated chicks.

Digested DNAs were then electrophoresed in an agarose gel. Appropriate bands were excised and digested DNAs were purified using the GeneJet Gel Purification kit (Thermo Scientific). To ligate S1-GCN4 fusion genes into pEXPR-IBA42 vector, digested fragments were combined at a 1:3 (vector: insert) ratio and added to a ligation reaction mix containing T4 ligase (Thermo Scientific). Ligation products were incubated at 4 \u00b0C overnight and then transformed into chemically competent JM109 E. coli cells (Promega; Wisconsin, USA) using the heat shock method described by the manufacturer. The transformation reaction mix was plated on Luria-Bertani agar plates supplemented with 100 \u03bcg/mL carbenicillin. Overnight cultures were prepared from several bacterial colonies obtained and plasmid extraction was performed using the GeneJet plasmid miniprep kit (Thermo Scientific). To identify positive transformants, plasmid minipreps from each bacterial colony were subjected to digestion with NheI and subsequently, sequencing by Sanger method at the Georgia Genomics Facility (University of Georgia). A large batch of plasmids to be used for transformation of HEK 293 cells was prepared using the GeneJet Maxiprep kit (Thermo Scientific) following the manufacturer's recommended protocol.",

Culture media was harvested 6 days after transfection and centrifuged at 3000\u00d7g for 15 min at 4 \u00b0C to pellet any carried over cells. Supernatants were subjected to affinity chromatography with a StrepTactin-Sepharose column (IBA Life Sciences) using the manufacturer's recommended protocol. Presence of S1 fusion proteins was confirmed by performing Western blot using StrepTactin-HRP (IBA Life Sciences) following the manufacturer's recommended protocol. Samples for SDS-PAGE were prepared by adding purified S1 fusion proteins to urea-SDS Buffer (200 mM Tris, 8 M urea, 1.1 mM EDTA, 5% SDS, 0.03% bromophenol blue, 0.1 M DTT) at a 1:1 volume to volume ratio. Samples were then heated to 100 \u00b0C for 10 min before SDS-PAGE. Spike proteins were digested with PNGase F (New England Biolabs; Massachusetts, USA) to remove N-glycosylations and to accurately measure molecular weight in Western blot. Briefly, we denatured S1 fusion proteins in 1\u00d7 Glycoprotein denaturation buffer (New England Biolabs) at 100 \u00b0C for 10 min. Subsequently, PNGase F digestion was performed using 1 U PNGase F enzyme for a 20-\u03bcL reaction for 1 h at 37 \u00b0C. Samples were then analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blot. Purified S1 fusion proteins were quantified using a Nanodrop spectrophotometer (Thermo Scientific) (\nTable 1).",
