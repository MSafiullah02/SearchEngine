            "text": "Pathogenic influenza A virus (IAV) strains that arise frequently by mutation or re-assortment of the viral genome have persistently caused seasonal epidemics, regional zoonotic infections, and periodic global pandemics with high morbidity and mortality for centuries1, 2. IAV causes productive infection in airway epithelial cells enabling the spread of infection to the lower respiratory tract, disruption of surfactant metabolism, and loss of epithelial barrier integrity3\u20135; restrictive infection that primes activation of capillary endothelial cells6; and abortive infection in alveolar macrophages and dendritic cells that contributes to induction of innate and adaptive immunity7, 8. The variable life cycle and genetic and antigenic diversity of IAV strains may determine IAV pathogenicity in different host cells9. The respiratory illness caused by severe IAV infection is a poorly resolving post-viral pneumonitis that can progress to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and may be fatal depending on the extend of lung injury10, 11. Pathogenic IAV strains disrupt endothelial and epithelial tight junctions4, enhancing microvascular permeability and leakage of fluid into air sacs, and perturb surfactant lipid and protein metabolism3 by alveolar type II epithelial cells increasing surface tension at the air-liquid interface. In addition to functional disruption of the respiratory barrier, IAV infection elicits apoptosis and ER stress that may further aggravate tissue damage and inflammation12\u201314. The incipient edema, respiratory imbalance between air and fluid-filled alveoli, and the collateral immune response to the viral infection exacerbate respiratory injury that manifest as excessive production of inflammatory mediators, diffuse alveolar damage and hypoxia in terminal ARDS11. Thus, a better understanding of the host factors that contribute to IAV pathogenicity is crucial for the development of therapies that prevent pneumonia and intractable lung injury from IAV infection.",

BAR domains are involved in protein-protein dimerization, membrane binding, and curvature formation and sensing16. B2 dimerizes with its better known paralog endophilin B1(B1), which promotes mitochondrial apoptosis16, 17, autophagosome formation18, endocytic degradation of growth factor receptors19, and adipose tissue lipid metabolism and insulin resistance20. The B1/B2 heterodimer has been found to be indispensable for degradation of the inner mitochondrial membrane and mitophagy for autophagy-dependent clearance of damaged mitochondria21. Interestingly, B2 binding to plectin 1 modulates nuclear cytoskeletal positioning and mechano-transduction22, 23.",

These unstained tissues were washed several times and then immersed in DPBS. Multiphoton imaging operations were performed directly on these unstained tissue sections over at least three different alveolar regions. The lung alveolar wall matrix, specifically fibrillar collagens and elastin fibers, was identified in 3-dimentional space using second harmonic generation (SHG) and multiphoton excitation fluorescence (MPEF) as described in detail previously27, 28. A femtosecond infrared laser source can induce harmonic generation signals from fibrillar collagens, while the same laser source can induce endogenous fluorescence from elastin fibers, enabling direct visualization and quantitation of both fibrillar collagens and elastin structures without the use of exogenous probes, histological sectioning or staining. The immobilized whole lung cross-sections were imaged using Nikon A1 MP + Multi-Photon Microscope system (Nikon Instruments, New York)28, 29. The laser used for SHG as well as the fluorescence emission from elastin was a mode-locked femto-second Spectra-Physics InSight DS femtosecond single-box laser system with automated dispersion compensation tunable between 680\u20131300 nm (Spectra-Physics, Mountain View, CA). The power attenuated laser was directed to a Nikon scan head coupled with Nikon upright microscope system (Nikon Instruments, New York). The laser beam was then focused on the specimen through a high numerical aperture, low magnification, long working distance, dipping objective, CFI75 Apo Water 25X/1.1 LWD 2.0 mm WD specifically designed for deep tissue imaging and other ex vivo/in vivo/in vitro imaging. The backscattered emission from the sample was collected through the same objective lens. Nikon NIS Element Software was used for the image acquisition. Non-descanned detectors and spectral scanning mode both in the reflection geometry were used for capturing the 3D images as well as for the spectral signal measurements respectively. High-sensitivity GaAsP detectors were used for very efficient SHG and elastin signal collections. A 750 nm Dichroic was used to prevent the scattered IR laser radiation from reaching the detector. A 455 long pass dichroic beam splitter (455 DCXRU, Chroma Technology, USA) was used to separate SHG signal from the MPEF signal. A 593 nm long pass dichroic beam splitter (FF593-Di03-25 \u00d7 36, Semrock Inc, USA) was used to separate other endogenous fluorescence signal above 593 nm. SHG signal was captured using a 440/20 nm SHG band pass filter (MP 440/20, Chroma Technology). Spectral measurements to confirm the specificities of SHG and elastin signals in the lung tissues were performed using 32-channel Nikon Spectral Detector integrated with Nikon A1 MP + Multi-Photon Microscope system (Nikon Instruments, New York).",

The levels of surfactant protein A (Sftpa1), B (Sftpb), and C (Sftpc), and the surfactant lipid transporter Abca3 expressed by alveolar type II epithelial cells decreased and remained depressed by \u2265 50% in WT lungs while levels of surfactant protein D (Sftpd) were not affected (Fig. 2A\u2013E). Sftpa1, Sftpb, Sftpc, and Abca3 also declined to 50\u201375% below uninfected control while Sftpd levels were stable for the first 7 days after infection in the lungs of B2\u2212/\u2212 mice. In contrast to WT mice, however, there was robust recovery in expression of all five surfactant related genes between 7\u201314 days after infection in B2\u2212/\u2212 mice (Fig. 2A\u2013E). The alveolar type I epithelial cell selective podoplanin gene Pdpn (also known as T1\u03b1) (Fig. 2F) declined and remained depressed in WT mice, whereas Pdpn expression returned to pre-infection levels by 14 days in B2\u2212/\u2212 lungs (Fig. 2F). The protein transporter caveolin 1 (Cav1) gene, which is highly expressed in lung microvascular endothelial cells as well as alveolar type I epithelial cells was also depressed in WT, but increased almost 2-fold between 7 and 14 days after infection in B2\u2212/\u2212 lungs (Fig. 2G). Furthermore, expression of Csf2 (aka GM-CSF), a central paracrine mediator of alveolar macrophage differentiation and activation30 expressed by alveolar type II epithelial cells increased initially but then declined below uninfected controls in WT mice (Fig. 2H). In contrast, while Csf2 expression in B2\u2212/\u2212 mice exhibited similar kinetics as WT initially, it remained significantly elevated in B2\u2212/\u2212 lungs (Fig. 2H) compared to WT lungs after 7 days.\n",

The lungs of both WT (Fig. 4A) and B2\u2212/\u2212 mice (Fig. 4E) showed bronchopneumonic lesions consisting of interstitial fibrosis, squamous metaplasia, with disperse or focal lymphocytic infiltrates. Organized lymphocytic foci (Fig. 4E) were significantly more prominent in B2\u2212/\u2212 lungs as demostrated by blind scoring of H&E stained tissue sections (Supplementary Figure S2). Cryptogenic organizing pneumonia marked by fibroblastic alveolar buds was a striking presentation of WT lung pathology (Fig. 4B\u2013D) compared to B2 alveolar spaces that were either clear with small lesions (Fig. 4F) or infiltrated with lymphocytes (Fig. 4G). Quantitation of collagen deposition by optical birefringence showed lower deposition of collagen in broncho-alveolar septal lesions and pulmonary atria in lower airway of the B2\u2212/\u2212 lung 14 days after infection compared to WT mice, consistent with the better recovery from lung injury in B2\u2212/\u2212 mice (Fig. 4H and Supplementary Figures S3).\n",

Interestingly, the fibrillary collagen signal was statistically higher by 13% in B2\u2212/\u2212 lungs compared to WT mice (Fig. 5M), suggesting basal differences in arrangement of alveolar collagen fibers, although this difference did not result in obvious alterations in basal respiratory parameters (Supplementary Figure S4). The signal intensities for fibrillar collagen (Fig. 5M) and elastin (Fig. 5N) after IAV infection were 45\u201350% and 25% lower in WT mice compared to vehicle treated and IAV infected WT (Fig. 5M) as well as infected and uninfected B2\u2212/\u2212 lungs (Fig. 5N), indicating loss of alveolar structure in WT but not B2\u2212/\u2212 mice. The loss in alveolar structure observed 14 days after infection in WT lungs is evidenced at the physiological level by the higher static compliance (Cst) measured at the end of the inspiratory curve26 (Supplementary Figure S4C) and decreased elastic recoil as indicated by the higher slope K of the expiratory curve31 (Supplementary Figure S4D), consistent with development of chronic lower airway respiratory disease after infection in WT but not B2\u2212/\u2212 mice. Given these results, we assessed respiratory mechanics after methacholine challenge to assess disease manifestation in airway and alveolar compartments. Figure 5O shows that lack of B2 obviated obstructive disease in the distal airway as indicated by significantly lower respiratory elastance over several methacholine concentrations in B2\u2212/\u2212 mice 14 days after infection. The increase in airway resistance in response to methacholine, however, increased similarly in WT and B2\u2212/\u2212 mice at all but the highest concentration of methacholine (Fig. 5P), indicating similar bronchial airway disease. The vehicle treated WT and B2\u2212/\u2212 lungs had similar responsiveness to methacholine and both significantly less responsive than infected mice (Fig. 5O\u2013P).\n",

            "text": "To determine whether lack of B2 alters the inflammatory response to IAV infection, multicolor flow cytometry (Supplementary Figure S1) was used to monitor alveolar macrophages and the influx of inflammatory cells in lungs and BAL (Figs 6\u20138). Relevant to the findings shown above in Figs 4 and 5, it has been shown that the phenotype of alveolar macrophages is shaped by the lung\u2019s biomechanical environment32. Furthermore, extracellular matrix integrity influences homing and differentiation of lymphocytes in response to IAV infection33. Overall, the kinetics of neutrophils and Ly-6C+ monocytes was similar with some differences. The number of neutrophils in BAL of B2\u2212/\u2212 mice was significantly higher than WT at 3 days (Fig. 6B). A second wave of neutrophils in lungs was observed in WT mice at 12 days (Fig. 6A), suggesting ongoing inflammation. The kinetics and number of Ly-6C+ monocytes (Fig. 6C) was similar, although significantly higher in BAL 3 days after infection in B2\u2212/\u2212 mice compared to WTs (Fig. 6D). The number of eosinophils was not significantly different (Supplementary Figure S5), although also higher in B2\u2212/\u2212 mice. IAV infection, however, caused a precipitous decline in SIGLECF + alveolar macrophages (AMs) in both lung (Fig. 6D) and BAL (Fig. 6F) of WT and B2\u2212/\u2212 mice over the first 7 days, but AMs were then replenished in B2\u2212/\u2212 but not WT mice by day 12. Quantitation of Siglecf mRNA (Fig. 7A) was consistent with the depletion and then recovery of SIGLECF + AMs (Fig. 6E,F). The robust induction of ITGAX (aka CD11c) expression after 3 days in B2\u2212/\u2212 mice compared to WT (Fig. 7B) was consistent with differentiation and replenishment of AMs in keeping with the sustained expression of Csf2 (Fig. 2H). The myeloid activation/differentiation markers ITGAM (Fig. 7C) and Spi1 (aka PU.1) (Fig. 7D) increased transiently in both B2\u2212/\u2212 and WT mice. Interestingly, expression of Nos2 was significantly higher and remained elevated in B2\u2212/\u2212 lungs compared to WTs (Fig. 7F), while expression of arginase 1 (Arg1) was similar and transient in both mouse groups (Fig. 7E), suggesting increased nitric oxide antimicrobial activity and nitric oxide signaling in B2\u2212/\u2212 mice during recovery from IAV infection. In addition to changes in myeloid cells, disruption of B2 also altered the lymphocyte profile as indicated by the higher number of CD4 + CD8- T lymphocytes in both lungs and BAL after 7 days of infection with significant differences in CD4 + CD8- lymphocyte number measured on day 12 (Fig. 8A and B). A similar trend in the CD8 + CD4- population, however, was not statistically significant (Fig. 8C and D).\n\n\n",

IAV is capable of infecting multiple resident and incoming inflammatory cells3\u20138, 45, 46 that contribute to the complex pathogenesis of the infection. Here, we show that endophilin B2 plays a deleterious role in IAV infection by mediating persistent inhibition of surfactant protein, Abca3, Pdpn, and Cav1 genes, which are critical for normal respiratory gas exchange, surfactant and immune homeostasis, host defense, alveolar epithelial cell differentiation, formation of caveolae, and mechano-transduction during breathing47\u201352. The restoration of genes expressed by alveolar cells in B2\u2212/\u2212 mice reflects the increased recovery of lung cells in enzymatic digests 14 days after infection. Recovery from severe influenza infection, however, occurred despite similar transpulmonary flux of plasma proteins into the alveolar lumen. Plasma proteins can inhibit surface tension lowering properties of surfactant resulting in alveolar collapse, impaired gas exchange, and tissue injury driving development of ARDS53, 54. Lung protective ventilation is currently the only supportive intervention to limit the deleterious effects of edema on surfactant function55. It is thus plausible that correction of surfactant deficiency in B2\u2212/\u2212 mice neutralized inhibitory and injurious effects of plasma proteins on surfactant function. The protective response to infection in B2\u2212/\u2212 mice also was also associated with temporal deployment of CEBP transcription factors, continued expression of Csf2, and replenishment and differentiation of alveolar macrophages (AMs). CEBPs regulate surfactant protein gene expression and activation of macrophages and host responses to influenza infection41\u201343 while GM-CSF is critical for AM differentiation, surfactant homeostasis, and survival from lethal IAV infection56, 57. Furthermore, imaging and respiratory physiology studies suggest that IAV infection through B2 may alter the compartmental organization and mechanical properties of alveolar extracellular matrix in lung parenchyma. In this context, we recently reported that the ubiquitously expressed B2 delays lysosome acidification and endosomal trafficking of IAV in different cell types in vitro\n24. Taken together, the present findings indicate that IAV utilizes B2 to disconnect spatiotemporal gene interactions in response to IAV infection in the lung, culminating in the development of refractory immune and structural lung injury.",

Persistence of influenza antigen on alveolar epithelial cells exacerbates immunopathology by activated CD8+ lymphocytes58. The presence of COP suggests that B2 limits clearance of residual viral antigen in the lower airway. It has been shown that influenza antigen persists long after viral proliferation has been terminated in the lung59. COP sequelae are increasingly recognized manifestations of influenza-induced pneumonitis60\u201365. Our recent studies in vitro also showed that loss of B2 delays formation of auto-phagolysosmes24 and previous studies demonstrated that suppression of basal autophagy in alveolar type II epithelial cells enhances resistance to IAV infection66. It is possible that evasion of B2 enhances autophagy-mediated persistence of influenza antigens on epithelial cells driving development of pneumonitis by inflammatory lymphocytes.",

Our imaging and respiratory physiology findings suggest that B2 influences alveolar collagen and elastin extracellular matrix. In this regard, it is noteworthy that extracellular matrix is critical for the homing and differentiation of CD4+ tissue resident memory lymphocytes in response to IAV infection33, 67. Mechanical stretch during breathing is a physiological signal for surfactant secretion68. Abnormal stretch can damage membrane and initiate injury and inflammatory bio-trauma47, 69. It is thus possible that membrane wounding that occurs during viral entry and release of virions70, 71 impairs epithelial membrane repair initiating inflammatory responses to physiological stress. In this context, recent studies demonstrated that B2 interacts with the N-terminal domain of the cytolinker plectin 1. This interaction affects nuclear shape and positioning, cellular signaling and chromatin methylation, and mechano-transduction of intermediate filaments in myocytes and epithelial cells22, 23. Plectin 1 also controls the formation of distinct circular focal adhesions at the perinuclear membrane of alveolar epithelial cells in response to the lung\u2019s mechanical environment72, and regulates cell-matrix interaction and signaling through the mechano-receptor dystroglycan73. Taken together, IAV infection through B2 could disrupt mechanosensitive responses and remodeling of extracellular matrix causing irreparable structural injury and inflammation.",
