In most cases, symptoms consistent with a viral illness precede the development of the ulcers and the differential diagnosis includes infectious agents [2]. Several case reports and case series have associated these vulvar ulcers in non-sexually active females with viral infections such as Epstein\u2013Barr virus [3], cytomegalovirus (CMV), influenza A virus, mumps virus [4, 5], and in some cases with autoimmune disorders such as Beh\u00e7et\u2019s disease [6] or trauma [7]. Herpes simplex virus (HSV) has been associated with such ulcers, most commonly in sexually active patients. Mycoplasma pneumoniae has rarely been linked with these ulcers in the medical literature [8, 9].",
