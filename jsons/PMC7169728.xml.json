Management and prevention efforts against pneumonia in developing countries have traditionally focused on bacterial pathogens. The introduction of effective conjugate vaccines globally has led to decreasing trends in bacterial pneumonia and a subsequent increased interest in the role of virus\u2010associated ALRI. Recent advances in molecular diagnostics such as PCR have also led to the discovery of new viruses and viral species, highlighting the prominence of viruses in respiratory disease. Respiratory viruses are widely acknowledged to be the most common cause of both upper and lower respiratory tract infections in the developed world 2. However, advanced diagnostics are largely limited in the developing world, and studies including a comprehensive range of viral pathogens are scarce in many African countries. The majority of respiratory viral aetiological studies in Africa have relied on traditional cell culture and serological methods with PCR data only becoming available in recent years. Data beyond respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) are still scarce, and aetiological studies of ALRI in African children published as recently as 2013 did not screen for common respiratory viruses such as RV, coronavirus and bocavirus 3, or were unable to distinguish RV from enterovirus 4.",

The identification of RV\u2010C as the third RV species, first reported in 2006, led to several investigations on the prevalence of RV species, conducted predominantly in developed countries. The majority of these studies on children hospitalised with ALRI or asthma found that RV\u2010C was the most prevalent RV species and was often associated with more severe illness 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13. While there have been previous reports on the overall prevalence of RV in children with acute respiratory infections or pneumonia in Mozambique, none have specifically investigated RV species 14, 15. In the two Mozambican studies of respiratory viral prevalence, RV was the most commonly identified virus, identified in 26% of children with acute respiratory infections and in 24% with pneumonia. Only three other studies have investigated the prevalence of RV species in African children 16, 17, 18. While these studies confirmed the importance of RV in African children, they were inconclusive with respect to the role of RV species in ALRI in African children.",

Evidence suggests that HIV infection is now driving both the frequency and outcome of pneumonia and that pneumonia is the leading cause of morbidity and mortality in HIV\u2010infected children 19. A recent study from South Africa reported that a respiratory virus was identified in the majority of both HIV\u2010infected and HIV\u2010uninfected children, with RV being the most frequently identified virus 20.

A few studies from Africa and the Middle East found that RV\u2010C was associated with wheezing 12, 18. The clinical relevance of viral co\u2010infections is also not well established, and there is conflicting evidence regarding the association between multiple viral identifications and disease severity. Some studies have reported an association between viral co\u2010infections and disease severity 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, while others have reported no differences in disease severity between single and multiple viral infections 30, 31.",

Identification of common respiratory viruses (adenovirus, RSV, bocavirus, coronavirus, parainfluenza viruses, influenza viruses and metapneumovirus) was carried out using two independent multiplex RT\u2010PCR assays with primers specific for each virus and viral type. RV identification and genotyping were based on a published molecular method to determine RV genotypes and to differentiate closely related enteroviruses from RV 33. Viral RNA was first extracted from a 240 \u03bcl volume of NPAs using the QIAGEN QIAamp Viral RNA Mini Kit (Spin protocol) and reverse\u2010transcribed to cDNA. This was used for the PCR amplification of a 260\u2010bp variable sequence in the 5\u2032 non\u2010coding region of the RV genome using in\u2010house designed primers. PCR products were then sequenced commercially by the Australian Genome Research Facility. Genotypes were assigned based on comparisons of the 5\u2032 non\u2010coding region sequences with those of 101 classical serotypes as well as 52 newly identified genotypes using ClustalX software (Conway Institute, University College Dublin, Dublin, Ireland). Representative samples of each genotype have previously been sequenced at the VP4\u2010VP2 coding region to confirm the species assignment 34, 35.",

RV\u2010A was the most commonly identified RV species followed by RV\u2010C and RV\u2010B. Only three studies have investigated RV species in children with respiratory illness in Africa. Consistent with our findings, two studies of children with ALRI from Kenya and Burundi reported that RV\u2010A was the most common species identified, followed by RV\u2010C and RV\u2010B 17, 18. In contrast, a study from South Africa investigated acute wheezing illness in young children 16 and reported RV\u2010C as the most common RV species. Other studies of children hospitalised with asthma or wheezing, predominantly from developed countries, have also found RV\u2010C to be the most frequently identified species 10, 11, 12, 37. Several RV genotypes from each species were identified suggesting that a large number of genotypes are circulating in the community and that no single RV genotype predominates at any given time. Hence, our findings support the majority of African studies that report RV\u2010A to be more common than RV\u2010C in children with ALRI.",

However, comparable rates have been reported in paediatric populations outside Mozambique 40. Given the high rate of viral identifications in children hospitalised with ALRI, our findings support current literature on the importance of respiratory viruses in the pathogenesis of ALRI. However, like the majority of viral aetiology investigations, our study was limited by the use of NPAs to identify respiratory viruses, which may not be entirely representative of respiratory viruses in the lower airway. Further investigations using lower airway samples as well as the inclusion of a contemporaneous control group may facilitate better understanding of the role of viruses in clinical pneumonia.",

Thirty\u2010eight (13.7%) cases were HIV infected, of which 26 (68.4%) had at least one respiratory virus. Contrary to our hypothesis, respiratory virus (including RV species) identification was not more common among HIV\u2010infected than HIV\u2010uninfected children. However, previous studies from Africa have reported increased viral identification rates among HIV\u2010infected children 15, 41. Madhi et al. reported that viral identification among HIV\u2010infected children varied according to respiratory virus and was lowest for RSV 41. There are limited viral data on HIV\u2010infected children with ALRI, and, like ours, most of these studies were limited to relatively small sample sizes and were unable to draw conclusions about the role of HIV. Further investigations including a larger HIV\u2010positive cohort are needed.",

Other studies have reported that overall, RV identification in children with ALRI was associated with unique clinical characteristics such as wheeze 42 and atopic dermatitis 43. We also did not observe any differences in associated clinical features between the three RV species. However, this could be due to the small numbers within each RV species, particularly in the RV\u2010B group, or to our study population representing a moderate\u2010to\u2010severe subset of all respiratory infections. In concordance with our findings, Luchsinger et al. 44 did not observe any differences between RV species according to clinical features or severity of illness in infants in Chile with ALRI. We also investigated associations between respiratory viruses and clinical features. Of all other respiratory viruses, RSV was positively associated with the most number of clinical features including wheeze, oxygen saturation, lower chest wall indrawing, nasal flare and deep breathing. Although not significant, we observed that children identified only with RSV were slightly younger than those with RV (15.4 months vs. 22.6 months; P = 0.120), which may partly explain differences in clinical severity observed. Similarly, other studies have also reported that RSV was associated with more severe disease than RV 44, 45. However, these studies investigated children with bronchiolitis rather than pneumonia and may also be confounded by age.",

Although we observed slightly lower RV prevalence during the cool and dry season, particularly from June to August, this was not significant and possibly due to population size. Our findings are supported by previous investigations of RV species in Africa, which found no seasonality patterns for RV or RV species identification 3, 17. In contrast to RV, RSV did show clear seasonal patterns and was most prevalent during the warm and wet season. This finding has been supported by previous studies from Mozambique 48 and Ghana 3 that reported RSV epidemics during the rainy season.

This study also has a few limitations. Firstly, we identified respiratory viruses in NPAs. Although nasopharyngeal identification of viruses has been associated with lower respiratory tract infections, it also occurs among healthy, asymptomatic individuals. Because the mechanisms that lead to lower respiratory infection remain poorly understood, viral identification in the upper airway may not be entirely representative of that of the lower airway. Furthermore, as we are unable to differentiate asymptomatic infection from clinical (symptomatic) infection using molecular methods of detection, a virus\u2010positive NPA suggests but does not prove causation.",

Thirdly, our study did not include a contemporaneous control group to compare the prevalence of respiratory viruses between sick and healthy children.
