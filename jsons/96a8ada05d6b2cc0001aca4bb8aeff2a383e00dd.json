The WR321 mAb broadly neutralized CCR5-tropic strains of HIV-1 to prevent infection of the cells. The mAb also exhibited direct interaction with cells in the culture, resulting in secretion of chemokines that interfered with the interaction of HIV-1 virions with CCR5, the coreceptor for HIV-1 on the susceptible cells, leading to inhibition of infection by HIV-1. Phosphoinositides that are recognized by WR321 do not exist on the external surface of cells, but are concentrated on the inner surface (cytoplasmic leaflet) of the plasma membrane. Murine anti-phosphoinositide mAbs similar to WR321 have previously been directly microinjected into a variety of cultured cells, resulting in important changes in the functions of the cells. The present results suggest that binding of a mAb to phosphoinositides, resulting in secretion of b-chemokines into the culture medium and neutralization of infection by CCR5-tropic HIV-1 of nearby susceptible cells, occurred by uptake and binding of the mAb at an intracellular location in the cultured cells that then led to secretion of HIV-1-inhibitory b-chemokines.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Abstract"}], "body_text": [{"text": "Inhibition of HIV-1 infection of peripheral blood mononuclear cells by a monoclonal antibody that binds to phosphoinositides and induces secretion of b-chemokines 1 ", "cite_spans": [{"start": 163, "end": 164, "text": "1", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": ""}, {"text": "Antibody-based approaches to studies of the immunobiology of HIV-1, and to development of vaccines to HIV-1/AIDS, often rely on antibody-mediated inhibition (neutralization) of infection of susceptible cells.

In the course of examining the effects of monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) in the PBMC assay, we discovered that two murine IgM mAbs (PIP1 and PIP4, now known as WR301 and WR304) that were initially selected for the ability to bind to phosphatidylinositol-4phosphate (PIP), each neutralized HIV-1 [2, 3] .

It was thus concluded that although both 4E10 and WR304 could neutralize HIV-1 in the PBMC assay without binding to any HIV-1 proteins, it seemed likely that the mAbs could bind to one or more HIV-1 lipids, even if the exact lipid binding sites, whether phosphoinositides or other lipids, remained unclear because of very broad lipid binding specificities of the mAbs.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 227, "end": 230, "text": "[6]", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}, {"start": 623, "end": 626, "text": "[6]", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}, {"start": 860, "end": 866, "text": "10.124", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 950, "end": 953, "text": "[7]", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}, {"start": 1210, "end": 1213, "text": "[8]", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}, {"start": 1214, "end": 1217, "text": "[9]", "ref_id": "BIBREF8"}, {"start": 1218, "end": 1222, "text": "[10]", "ref_id": "BIBREF9"}, {"start": 1223, "end": 1227, "text": "[11]", "ref_id": "BIBREF10"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": ". Introduction"}, {"text": "Recently, a novel alternative neutralizing mechanism for antilipid mAbs has been proposed that does not require any direct binding of the anti-phospholipid antibodies to HIV-1. A neutralizing human mAb, CL1, was described as having binding capabilities for both cardiolipin and phosphatidylserine, but no binding to HIV-1 envelope protein, and it inhibited proliferation of CCR5-tropic, but not CXCR4-tropic HIV-1 strains in a PBMC assay [12] . In this case, release of several b-chemokines, including MIP-1a and MIP-1b, was observed in the PBMC culture fluid. b-Chemokines are believed to be effectors secreted by many cells, including CD4+ and CD8+ lymphocytes, NK cells, and monocytes in the PBMC that inhibit infection by binding to CCR5, thus blocking infection with HIV-1 strains that utilize CCR5, but not those that utilize CXCR4, as a co-receptor [13] . Based on binding of CL1 to cells in the PBMC culture, it was hypothesized that CL1 bound to plasma membrane phospholipid(s) and caused secretion of b-chemokines that interfered with binding of HIV-1 to CCR5-dependent, but not to CXCR4-dependent, viruses [12] . In the present study, we explore further the lipid binding specificities of CL1, including binding to phosphoinositides, and we describe a new murine neutralizing IgG mAb (WR321) which binds only to phosphoinositides PIP and PIP2 among 19 lipids tested, but which also causes release of HIV-1-inhibitory b-chemokines by PBMC even in the absence of HIV-1.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 438, "end": 442, "text": "[12]", "ref_id": "BIBREF11"}, {"start": 856, "end": 860, "text": "[13]", "ref_id": "BIBREF12"}, {"start": 1117, "end": 1121, "text": "[12]", "ref_id": "BIBREF11"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": ".
