Almost simultaneously, in 2000, 2 independent approaches searching for such ACE homologs revealed the existence of a close relative of the ACE gene designated ACEH2 or ACE2.3\nACEH was cloned from a human lymphoma cDNA library and the identical ACE2 from a human HF ventricular cDNA library, the latter emphasizing a potential role for ACE2 in cardiovascular pathologies. Expression of the ACE2 gene was initially established in the heart, kidney, and testis, but subsequent studies have shown a much broader distribution, including the upper airways, lungs, gut, and liver (Figure 2A). Sequence comparison of ACE and ACE2 strongly suggested that ACE2, like ACE, was an integral transmembrane protein (and ectoenzyme) with a transmembrane anchor close to the C-terminus (type I membrane protein). A close evolutionary relationship existed between the ACE and ACE2, genes and it was presumed that the 2 proteins would have similar substrate specificities and involvement in the RAS.",

            "text": "Unlike the ACE gene, which is located on human chromosome 17, the 40kb ACE2 gene is located on chromosome Xp22 and contains 18 exons, most of which resemble exons in the ACE gene. Whereas somatic ACE contains 2 active sites, ACE2 possesses only a single catalytic domain. Both ACE and ACE2 act as zinc metallopeptidases but of differing substrate specificities defining their distinct and counterbalancing roles in the RAS. Whereas ACE cleaves C-terminal dipeptide residues from susceptible substrates (a peptidyl dipeptidase), ACE2 acts as a simple carboxypeptidase able to hydrolyze Ang I, forming Ang 1\u20139 and Ang II to Ang 1\u20137 (Figure 2B). ACE2 does not cleave bradykinin, further distinguishing its specificity from that of ACE while it is also insensitive to conventional ACE inhibitors.2,28 The C-terminal domain of ACE2, which has no similarity with ACE, is a homolog of a renal protein, collectrin, which regulates the trafficking of amino acid transporters to the cell surface, endowing ACE2 with multiple and distinctive physiological functions. It is the multiplicity of physiological roles that ACE2 plays that has allowed it to be hijacked by SARS-CoV-2 as a receptor, resulting in the COVID-19 pandemic.15,16 Structural studies have revealed the structures of both the SARS-CoV and much more recently, the SARS-CoV-2 in complex with ACE2 (Figure 2B).31,32 In the case of SARS-CoV-2, the major spike glycoprotein (S1) binds to the N-terminal region of ACE2. The knowledge of the biology and physiology of ACE2 accumulated over the last 20 years since its discovery should provide a major stimulus to understanding some of the key steps in SARS-CoV-2 infection and its ultimate prevention.",

Since then, the outbreak has escalated to well over one million cases and caused over 60 000 deaths worldwide by the start of April 2020. However, before the emergence of SARS-CoV in 2002, coronaviruses were conventionally viewed as inconsequential pathogens circulating in nature throughout various host and intermediate species that occasionally infected humans causing only mild upper respiratory tract infections and symptoms of the common cold.33\u201335 As such, to better understand the severity of global health risks posed by SARS-CoV-2 and optimize treatment for infected patients, we must recognize the role of ACE2 in SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis. In addition to respiratory involvement, multiorgan dysfunction occurs in response to SARS-CoV-2 infections.36\u201338 While respiratory symptoms are predominant, acute cardiac and kidney injuries, arrhythmias, gut, and liver function abnormalities have all been documented in infected patients, suggesting myocardial, renal, enteric and hepatic damage in COVID-19. Similarly, SARS-CoV also resulted in systemic manifestations with damages to the heart, gastrointestinal, liver, kidney, and other tissues.39,40",

The binding affinity of SARS-CoV-2 with ACE2 seems stronger than SARS-CoV, with alterations in several amino acid residues allowing for enhanced hydrophobic interactions and salt bridge formations, which may explain the considerably larger global influence of COVID-19 than the initial SARS.16,42 Moreover, SARS-CoV-2 has evolved to utilize a wide array of host proteases including cathepsin L, cathepsin B, trypsin, factor X, elastase, furin, and TMPRSS2 (transmembrane protease serine 2) for S-protein priming and facilitating cell entry following receptor binding.43 So far, TMPRSS2 and cathepsin L/B mediates S-protein priming of SARS-CoV-2, and camostat mesylate, a serine protease inhibitor combined with cathepsin L/B inhibitor, E-64d blocked SARS-CoV-2 entry.44 The entry of both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 into cells is facilitated by the interaction between viral S-protein with extracellular domains of the transmembrane ACE2 proteins, followed by subsequent downregulation of surface ACE2 expression (Figure 3).5,15,29 In a cohort of 12 COVID-19 patients, circulating Ang II levels were markedly elevated compared with healthy controls (linearly correlated with viral load), providing a direct link between tissue ACE2 downregulation with systemic RAS imbalance, and facilitating the development of multiorgan damage from SARS-CoV-2 infections.4,45 Potential therapeutic strategies may include preventing the binding of human ACE2 and SARS-CoV-2 by blocking the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the viral S-protein. In addition to this receptor-binding domain blocking strategy, other possible treatment options may include localized use of ACE2-derived peptides, small molecule inhibitors, ACE2 antibody or single chain antibody fragment against ACE2.",

Additionally, bilateral pleural effusions were frequently observed during autopsy of SARS-CoV patients, further supporting the evidence of cardiac involvement.

Leaky gastrointestinal conditions in experimental models of human disease can be ameliorated and worsened with either the gain or loss of ACE2, respectively.8,11 Patients with COVID-19 also suffer from gastrointestinal discomfort and diarrhea, which may arise earlier than respiratory conditions concurrent with the detection of viral RNA in feces, as seen with previous coronavirus outbreaks.38,47,53\u201356 Moreover, common comorbidities of CVD, including diabetes mellitus and obesity, are known to affect the integrity of the gastrointestinal-blood barrier and result in gut dysbiosis, bacteremia, and systemic inflammation (Figure 4). Development of gastrointestinal leakage and gut dysbiosis have correspondingly been linked to the onset of PH through the gut-lung axis and is closely related to hyperactivation of the ACE/Ang II/AT1R (angiotensin II type 1 receptor) axis from ACE2 loss.20,57 Continued viral production by host enterocytes perpetuates this situation and deteriorates conditions in the gut-lung axis.54,55 Evidence supports that SARS-CoV-2 infection potentially leads to degeneration of the gut-blood barrier leading to systemic spread of bacteria, endotoxins, and microbial metabolites likely affecting the host\u2019s response to COVID-19 infection and cumulating in multisystem dysfunction and septic shock.37,38,47 Enteric involvement and associated worsening in patient outcomes were documented from the initial SARS-CoV outbreak in the early 2000s. Fecal viral RNA was detected in up to 70% of patients with viral shedding from the gastrointestinal tract associated with a more aggressive clinical course.54,55 In a separate study, SARS-CoV particles were detected within the cytoplasm and surface microvilli of apical enterocytes in the ileum and colon55 while in patients with COVID-19, SARS-CoV-2 was detected in feces suggesting fecal-oral transmission.58 As such, the gastrointestinal tract of SARS-CoV, and possibly SARS-CoV-2 patients, acts as a staging ground for sustained viral replication concurrent with disruption of the enteric ACE2 axis and adverse outcomes.39,47,54,55,59,60",

Ang II-dependent hypertension in animal models64 and humans is associated with gut dysbiosis, increased gut leakiness, and gut wall pathology.10,63,65,66 There is broad support for these observations in pulmonary diseases including PH, COPD, and asthma67,68 and in type 2 diabetes mellitus where dysbiosis characterized by decreased microbial richness and diversity, altered representation of bacterial metabolic pathways and modifications in the composition of Firmicutes (F) and Bacteroidetes (B).69\u201371 ACE2 disruption in biomedical models has shown us that gut dysbiosis is quite prevalent and that this change in microbial profiles can alter systemic pathways exacerbating diabetes mellitus and hypertension. We recently showed that ACE2 deficiency magnifies diabetes mellitus-induced dysbiosis11 characterized by an increase in peptidoglycan-producing bacteria and loss of gut barrier integrity in Ace2\u2212/y-Akita mice. We also identified a new role of bone marrow cells in the gut. In the Ace2\u2212/y-Akita or Akita mice, the disrupted gut barrier was associated with reduced levels of circulating angiogenic cells, hematopoietic cells with reparative function. Giving exogenous circulating angiogenic cells from wild-type mice corrected gut barrier dysfunction in Ace2\u2212/y-Akita or Akita mice. Thus, decreased enteric ACE2 expression from SARS-CoV-2 infection may similarly reduce circulating angiogenic cells and compromise the integrity of the endothelium and gut epithelium leading to dysbiosis. Further examination is required to validate this link and whether it is a direct or indirect effect of viral infection.11",

Interestingly, although HNL63-CoV also utilizes ACE2 as a receptor for cellular entry, it does not induce ADAM-17 activation and ACE2 ectodomain shedding.84,85 Therefore, this study elucidates the unique role of ADAM-17 mediated shedding of ACE2 in SARS-CoV infectivity and may inform the disparity in severity between coronavirus subtypes.

            "text": "Discovery of ACE2 resulted in a paradigm-changing concept in all aspects of the RAS. ACE2 is a monocarboxypeptidase that converts Ang I into a nonapeptide, Ang 1\u20139, and Ang II into a heptapeptide, Ang 1\u20137 (Figure 5A). This distinct enzymatic pathway for degradation of Ang I and Ang II negatively regulates RAS activation and mitigates the deleterious actions mediated by Ang II and AT1R.1 This is of particular significance in pathological conditions where the RAS is overstimulated. Ang 1\u20137 is a biologically active peptide whose vast array of effects are opposite to those attributed to Ang II.92\u201398 Furthermore, ACE2 can antagonize ACE-independent formation of Ang II, such as from mast cell chymase.13,99 In 2003, an endogenous orphan receptor, Mas receptor (MasR), was identified as the Ang 1\u20137 receptor, and A779, a MasR antagonist was shown to inhibit the majority of Ang 1\u20137 effects.94,100\u2013103 Ang 1\u20139 has also shown beneficial biological effects via the AT2R that result in cardioprotection.104\u2013107 Thus, the ACE2/Ang 1\u20137/MasR axis has emerged as a physiological antagonist that counter-regulates the activated RAS.93,108\u2013112 The cardioprotective effects of ACE2 taken together can be attributed to (1) degradation of Ang I to Ang 1\u20139, whereby limiting action of ACE on its substrate, (2) reducing Ang II detrimental effects through degradation of the peptide, and (3) formation of Ang 1\u20137 which exercises cardioprotective effects. Formation of Ang 1\u20137 is an important mechanism of ACE2 mediated protection, as antagonism of Ang 1\u20137 using A779 prevented beneficial effects of rhACE2 in murine model of systolic dysfunction.113 Diminished ACE2 activity results in activation of the Ang II/AT1R axis, contributing to the increased progression of CVD. Elevated ACE2 level and activity result in the formation of Ang 1\u20139 and Ang 1\u20137, leading to protection against CVD (Figure 5A).",

An increase in ACE2 and the vasoprotective axis of the RAS by ACE inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) clearly reinforces this view (see section Pharmacological Antagonists of the RAS and ACE2 Expression below). Furthermore, increased ACE2 expression protects against hypertension, while ACE2 deficiency exacerbates hypertension. Renal Ace2 expression is inversely related to blood pressure in experimental models of hypertension.25 In the spontaneously hypertensive rat and stroke-prone spontaneously hypertensive rat, renal Ace2 mRNA levels are reduced compared with normotensive Wistar-Kyoto rats.25 These studies support the essential role of ACE2 in maintaining healthy blood pressure. Lentiviral overexpression of ACE2 results in increased expression of antihypertensive components of the RAS and attenuates elevated blood pressure.146,147 Pretreatment with rhACE2 prevented hypertension induced by Ang II and decreased plasma Ang II while increasing plasma Ang 1\u20137 levels.148 ACE2 and ADAM17 were selectively knocked down from all neurons (AC-N), which revealed a reduction of inhibitory inputs to AC-N presympathetic neurons relevant for blood pressure regulation. Mice with ACE2 selectively knocked down from Sim1 neurons in mice exhibited a blunted blood pressure elevation and preserved ACE2 activity during the development of salt-sensitive hypertension.14 The metalloproteinase ADAM17 is responsible for mediating ACE2 shedding from the cell membrane-bound domain, which can be promoted by Ang II, and release of ACE2 as a soluble form in plasma14,77,149 impairing brain ACE2 compensatory activity and thus contributing to the development of neurogenic hypertension.150 Genetic Ace2 deficiency is associated with the upregulation of putative mediators of atherogenesis and enhances responsiveness to proinflammatory stimuli suggestive of a key role of ACE2 in suppressing vascular inflammation and atherosclerotic disease.151 In addition, ACE2 inhibition blocks neuropeptide catestatin-mediated protective effects in the development of atherosclerosis in ApoE\u2212/\u2212 mice fed a high-fat diet.152",

ACE2 is also involved in PH and fibrosis.19 Increasing ACE2 activity using rhACE2 reduced bleomycin-induced inflammation and fibrosis, resulting in improved lung function and exercise capacity,19 and the ACE2 activator, DIZE, protects animals from PH and fibrosis.177 Moreover, oral feeding of a bioencapsulated form of ACE2 protects and arrests the progression of PH.12 Validation of this protective effect comes from a small human study that showed that PH is characterized by reduced ACE2 activity and supplementation of these individuals with rhACE2 improved pulmonary hemodynamics and reduced oxidative and inflammatory markers.21 Collectively, these studies unequivocally establish the conceptual framework that ACE2 is a central player in normal pulmonary function, and its imbalance leads to pulmonary diseases.",

Blocking the ACE/Ang II/AT1R axis through limiting the formation and actions of Ang II potentiates the effects of ACE2 as the endogenous RAS counter-regulator. The ARBS consistently increased Ace2 mRNA expression, protein levels, and catalytic activities in the heart, kidneys, and thoracic aorta, but the translation to protein levels and activity differs between experimental models and tissues for ACE inhibitors (Table).77,178\u2013185 Combination of lisinopril and losartan treatment in normotensive Lewis rats abolished the increase in Ace2 mRNA levels observed individually but retained losartan induced rise in ACE2 activity in the heart.179 Moreover, lisinopril in normotensive Lewis rats increased Ace2 mRNA without affecting ACE2 activity in the heart, but the opposite was observed in the kidneys.179,180 These findings could be attributed to tissue-specific regulation of ACE2, as higher ACE2 protein levels were reported in the heart, but ACE2 activity was higher in the kidneys of Sprague-Dawley rats, adding to the complexity of the tissue RAS.186 In type 1 diabetic Akita angiotensinogen-transgenic mice, dual RAS blockade with perindopril and losartan normalized disease-mediated reduction in kidney Ace2 mRNA expression and protein levels.187 These findings suggest that the accumulation of Ang II in pathological conditions contributes to the modulatory effects of RAS blockade on ACE2.",

Pharmacological RAS blockade agents, ARBs, in particular, are capable of modulating both systemic and tissue RAS, and simultaneously increasing ACE2 expression and activity in experimental models. The direct implications of RAS inhibition in patients with COVID-19 with hypertension remain elusive, and clinical evidence is desperately needed to determine the relative benefits and risks associated with usage of these medications.197 Nonetheless, introducing ARBs to patients already infected by SARS-CoV-2 may be an effective therapeutic option in addressing the viral-mediated RAS imbalance and is currently under investigation in several clinical trials (www.ClinicalTrial.gov number NCT04312009, NCT04311177, and NCT04318418).198\u2013200",

ACE2 is a dominant mechanism for negative regulation of the RAS by metabolizing Ang II into the beneficial peptide Ang 1\u20137, and this important biochemical and physiological property is being harnessed as a potential therapy in patients with HF. The activation of the RAS axis due to binding of SARS-CoV-2 to ACE2, leading to direct loss of ACE2 and indirectly via proteolytic processing and shedding, partly drives the systemic manifestations of COVID-19. Careful targeting of the RAS axes is needed in these patients to optimize their clinical outcomes, including the use of AT1 receptor blockers (ARB).",

Renin was the first component of the RAS discovered following the finding that extracts from rabbit kidney produced pressor effects (Tigerstedt and Bergman, 1898). Constriction of the renal artery was then found to lead to hypertension (HTN), thus driving the discovery of hypertensin and angiotonin (and later termed angiotensin; Goldblatt et al27; Page and Helmer24). Ang (angiotensin) was subsequently purified, and 2 forms were resolved: Ang I and Ang II. Therefore, the existence of a converting enzyme was predicted (ACE) and subsequently isolated and characterized (Skeggs et al26). The counter-regulatory axis of RAS was then described, pioneered with the discovery of ACE2 by 2 independent research groups (Donoghue et al3; Tipnis et al2) and identification of the Ang1\u20137/Mas receptor axis (Santos et al101). The cardioprotective effects of ACE2 were discovered shortly after (Crackower et al25). Studies have identified the ACE2 protease domain as the receptor for severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus (SARS-CoV; Li et al5) and, more recently, as the SARS-CoV-2 receptor (Walls et al15; Yan et al16).",

Ang II (angiotensin II) levels elevate with increased activity of angiotensin 1 receptors (AT1R) at the cost of ACE2/Ang 1\u20137 driven pathways leading to adverse fibrosis, hypertrophy, increased reactive oxygen species (ROS), vasoconstriction, and gut dysbiosis. ADAM17 (a disintegrin and metalloproteinase 17)-mediated proteolytic cleavage of ACE2 is upregulated by endocytosed SARS-CoV-2 spike proteins. Activation of the AT1R by elevated Ang II levels also further increases ADAM17 activity. ADAM17 correspondingly also cleaves its primary substrate releasing soluble TNF-\u03b1 (tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1) into the extracellular region where it has auto- and paracrine functionality. TNF-\u03b1 activation of its tumor necrosis factor receptor (TNFR) represents a third pathway elevating ADAM17 activity.

Ang II can go on to affect the cardiovascular system predominantly through the angiotensin type 1 receptor (AT1R) or via the angiotensin type 2 receptor (AT2R). Alternatively, Ang II can be degraded by the carboxypeptidase ACE2 or the PCP (prolyl carboxypeptidase) into Ang 1\u20137 (angiotensin 1\u20137). Ang 1\u20137 mediates protective effects throughout tissues which host the Mas receptor (MasR). Ang 1\u20137 can be further formed through the activity of ACE2 on Ang I forming Ang 1-9 which is then cleaved by either ACE or NEP (neprilysin).
