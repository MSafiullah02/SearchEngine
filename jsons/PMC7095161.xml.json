            "text": "Research into acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) has provided new pathophysiological insights that have major clinical implications [1, 2]. For instance, evidence that ventilator-induced lung injury is a major contributor to ARDS [3, 4] prompted the development of new protective ventilation strategies and of new mechanical ventilation (MV) guidelines [5\u20137]. To date, no pharmacological treatments have been proven effective in ARDS. However, in addition to MV for acute respiratory failure, treatments must be given not only for the condition associated with the acute or subacute, direct or indirect lung insult that caused ARDS to develop [8], but also for any preexisting comorbid conditions. In some cases, chronic comorbidities, such as malignancies, contribute to the development of ARDS, whereas in others they may increase the patient\u2019s vulnerability to complications of ARDS or treatments [9]. In patients with ARDS, the presence of comorbidities is associated with increased mortality. A prospective study of 107 patients found that independent predictors of death included active malignancy, cirrhosis of the liver, HIV infection, and transplantation, in addition to age above 65 years [10]. However, since its publication in 1998, no other large study has investigated potential differences in ARDS outcomes according to the comorbidity profile. The findings from this study [10] led to the exclusion of patients with major comorbidities from subsequently performed clinical trials and epidemiological studies of mortality rates.",

Another concern is that the sickest patients may be deprived of potentially beneficial treatments if they are not included in trials [11]. Moreover, knowledge about the predictors of mortality in patients with ARDS and major comorbidities may help to identify targets for improvement in other patients [12\u201315]. For instance, the cause of ARDS is closely associated with mortality in patients with cancer [16\u201320] but not in the overall population of patients with ARDS [1], hampering generalizability of the findings in unselected patients. For instance, the 12.5% unexpected rate of invasive aspergillosis in autopsy studies of non-immunocompromised patients with ARDS may be related to a lack of knowledge transfer from the immunocompromised literature [20]. Similarly, the deleterious effects of non-invasive ventilation followed by delayed invasive mechanical ventilation in patients with severe hypoxemia were first noticed in immunocompromised patients [18, 21] before being documented in unselected patients [15, 22].",

These variables were entered into multivariable models. Five missing values were imputed for PCO2 [28]. All variables entered in multivariate models were collected at ICU admission. Colinearity between variables and pairwise interactions were tested. Multivariate Cox regression was performed with stepwise selection. Each comorbidity category was forced into the model.

To evaluate the effect of PaO2/FiO2 ratio on day-28 mortality, we built a multivariate Cox regression model stratified by center and adjusted on comorbidities, extra-respiratory SOFA score items, and worst PaCO2 on day 1. The Cox model was selected as it included time-dependent variables. A spline term on the PaO2/FiO2 ratio was used. ROC curve analysis was performed to assess how well the Berlin severity category on day 1 predicted day-28 mortality.",
