Consequently, the purity of the dialysate and the permeability of the membrane for dialysate impurities might give in part to the acute and long\u2010term complications that afflict hemodialysis patients. Hemodialysis filtration with online endogenous reinfusion (HFR treatment) is a dialytic technique, which uses a double stage filter. The first stage allows pure ultrafiltrate (UF; a plasmatic water rich in toxins) to flow through a sorbent resin cartridge (Selecta). The cartridge removes toxins but not albumin and other nutritive substances, then the blood and regenerated UF undergo traditional dialysis. We investigate if the resin contained in the Selecta cartridge is able to remove bacterial\u2010derived DNA fragments (BDNAs).",

DNA fragments are thought to be derived from microorganisms inhabiting hemodialysis water and fluid 1. Most of these microorganisms that include potential pathogens might subsist in a \u201cviable but not culturable\u201d state or may need specific culture media 2. Explaining the association between BDNAs and indicators of inflammation may simplify the development of effective treatment strategies for chronic inflammation in such patients. The primary aim of the present study was to develop two degenerated TaqMan real\u2010time quantitative\u2010PCRs (Q\u2010PCRs) for detection of a broad range of bacterial DNA that specifically detects 16S ribosomal DNA (rDNA) (862 and 241 bp) and evaluates the efficiency of the Bellco Selecta resin to capture the BDNAs in the dialysis fluid. For this purpose, we decided to compare measurements of unfragmented samples (9.8 \u00d7 105\nEscherichia coli genome) with artificially fragmented DNA samples. These two sizes should cover the whole sample as well as predominant BDNAs fractions.",

The regions with consensus sequence were chosen for designing of primer and probe. We accepted difference of one nucleotide with insertion of degeneration. The Primer Express Software provided by Life Technologies (Waltham, MA, USA) was of limited value in determining a universal primers set as the primary selection criterion of the software is the length of the amplicon (50 \u00b1 150 bp). As a result, the regions of identity within the 16S rDNA had to be assessed manually, with the Primer Express Software being limited to checking for melting temperature (Tm), primer dimer or internal hairpin configurations, and percentage G\u00ad\u2010C values within possible primer\u2010probe sets. The forward primer (all\u2010BACT F2) and universal probe used was previously report by Nadkarni et al. [5]. The final chosen set including the primers is reported in Table 1. The primers and probe set give two amplicons of 241 bp (fragment 1) and 862 bp (fragment 2), respectively, exceeding the 50\u2013150 bp that was recommended. The universal probe and primers were checked for possible cross\u2010hybridization with bacterial genes other than 16S rDNA as well as genes from Eucarya and Archaea using the database similarity search program blast (http://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast.cgi). However, the universal primers did not amplify the human DNA sample thus confirming the specificity of the probe and primers set for the 16S rDNA of the domain bacteria.",

Tubes with PCR master mix, water, and primers sufficient for (8\u201310) \u00d7 25 \u03bcL reactions were prepared using ART pipette tips (Molecular Bioproduct, Waltham, MA, USA) for decontamination. Amplification and detection of DNA by real\u2010time PCR were performed with the ABI 7500 (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA, USA) using optical\u2010grade 96\u2010well plates. DNA template preparation and addition to reaction mix in 96 well PCR microplates (Axygen, cat. no. PCR\u201096\u2010LC480\u2010W) was performed in a VFB1206 Class II Microbiological Safety Cabinet (clanLAF). Triplicate samples were routinely used for the determination of DNA by real\u2010time PCR, and mean values were calculated. For the optimization of the two real\u2010time TaqMan PCR protocols, different concentrations of primers and probe were tested: 2,000, 1,500, 900, 500, 200 nM for primers and 250, 200, and 150 for the probe. The conditions with greater performance in terms of Ct data were chosen. PCR 1 (241 bp) was performed in a total volume of 25 \u03bcL using the TaqMan Universal PCR Master Mix (Life Technologies), containing 500 nM of universal forward primer and 2,000 nM of reverse primers and 200 nM of the florigenic probe. PCR 2 (862 bp) was performed in a total volume of 25 \u03bcL using the TaqMan Universal PCR Master Mix (Life Technologies), containing 2,000 nM each of the universal forward and reverse primers and 200 nM of the florigenic probe. In the case of PCR 1, the Universal PCR Master Mix was 1/3 diluted and adjusted for dNTP and Taq gold tenor for reduction of MgCl2 concentration from 5 to 1.6 mM.

In addition, Navarro et al. have demonstrated that small fragments of bacterial DNA in vitro enhance cytokine production and promote the survival of inflammatory cells in patients with chronic kidney diseases, delaying apoptotic death of mononuclear cells, suggesting that this action may contribute to perpetuate inflammation in these patients 6, 7, 8. The aim of this study was to investigate the efficiency of the Bellco Selecta resin to capture the bacteria\u2010free DNA fragmented or unfragmented eventually presented in the dialysis fluid. For this purpose, we developed two PCRs for real\u2010time detection of all bacteria DNA, the first able to amplify a fragment of 241 bp and the second of 862 bp. Both PCRs were designed on 16S rDNA. Real\u2010time PCR assays are described as \u201cclosed\u201d systems, since no postamplification manipulation of the amplicon is required. The advantages of these systems, in comparison to conventional PCR, include a reduced turnaround time, minimizing of the potential for carryover contamination and the ability to analyze closely the assay performance. Real\u2010time PCR offers significant improvements to quantitation because of its wide dynamic range, which can accommodate at least eight log 10 copies of nucleic acid template. This is made possible because the data are chosen from the linear phase of amplification where conditions are optimal, rather than the end point where the final amount of amplicon may have been affected by inhibitors, poorly optimized reaction conditions, or saturation by inhibitory PCR by\u2010products and double\u2010stranded amplicon. The development of a noncommercial real\u2010time PCR assay [homemade] requires an analogous process applied to a marked and approved commercial kit for diagnostic use 9, 10. This is realized by the standardization and optimization of amplification protocol. The sensitivity of our two assays was found to be 102 copies/reaction with a linearity ranging from 109 to 102 copies/reaction, characterized by a good efficiency and repeatability (Fig. 1). Furthermore, the method was accurate, precise, and reproducible (Table 2) in accordance with Karlen et al. 11. Interexperiment biological variability will be specific to each experimental system. The true variability of the PCR assay (intraassay and biological interassay variability) is higher, typically with overall CV values ranging around 30%\u201350% 11. We obtained a maximum of 3.18% in the interassay test, so then we could say that our assay was reproducible. 16S rDNA detection has been successfully used for diagnosis of osteomyelitis 12, endometriosis 13, and bloodstream infections 14. In a previous report by Ogawa et al., a broad\u2010range real\u2010time PCR of the bacterial 16S rRNA gene was shown to be a useful tool for clinically diagnosing suspected bacterial endophthalmitis. Their broad\u2010range real\u2010time PCR assay targeting the bacterial 16S rRNA gene was a concentration of \u2265103 colony forming units (CFU) per PCR for detection of S. aureus and a concentration of \u2265102 CFU per PCR for detection of E. coli\n15. In addition, the minimum detection limits for S. aureus and E. coli were determined to be in the range 10\u2013103 CFU or CFU equivalents per PCR. This sensitivity was similar to our two real\u2010time PCRs developed in this paper.",

The limitations of this study are the size of the detectable bacteria\u2010free DNA. BDNA oligodeoxynucleotides of 6\u201320 nucleotides are able to bind to toll\u2010like receptors and are stimulatory on immune cells 16. They induce natural killer cell activity and interferon\u2010\u03b3 (IFN\u2010\u03b3), tumor necrosis factor\u2010\u03b1 (TNF\u2010\u03b1), and IL\u20106 release from mononuclear cells (1 [16\u201319]); they also display these same abilities when composed of five to six nucleotides 19. The assay performed up to 241 bp detection but not less. In conclusion, the present study shows that the development of two real\u2010time PCR systems able to detect bacteria\u2010free DNA and the use of this assay on the dialyzed fluid. Also, we assessed two broad\u2010range real\u2010time PCR targeting bacterial 16S rRNA genes for detection of fragmented and unfragmented bacterial DNA in the dialytic fluid and demonstrated that Bellco Selecta resin is capable of retaining these types of bacterial DNA. Future studies will need to develop an assay able to detect a small DNA fragment up to 20 bp such as stem\u2010loop PCR already developed for detection of microRNA 20.",
