Ideally, incidence and prevalence are determined by screening entire populations defined by specific geographic or political boundaries: community- or population-based studies.\n127 Estimates of prevalence based on populations identified by other methods, such as participants in a hospital clinic, do not reflect accurately the general population of an area, as cultural, economic, or other factors may influence case selection (selection bias).\n",

These individuals are observed over time, and the frequency of new disease in exposed and unexposed persons is determined. PD is an uncommon disorder beginning in late life. The latency from onset of neurodegeneration to onset of clinical signs is unknown. In such a situation, prospective cohort studies are problematic because a large number of unaffected individuals must be followed for decades. Cross-sectional methods, such as case-control studies, are faster and more economical. In case-control studies, individuals already affected with the disease of interest are compared to individuals without the illness, and exposures proposed to relate to the illness are compared. The retrospective nature of case-control studies makes them prone to recall bias, whereby cases have improved or altered recall of past exposures relative to controls, the result of heightened vigilance in association with the diagnosis of a chronic illness. Finally, in some cases (such as toxicant-induced parkinsonism), identification and intensive investigation of an unusually high incidence of disease, either in space or in time (a cluster), may provide important clues to disease etiology.",

The most reliable antemortem diagnostic method is expert neurologic examination. Although autopsy diagnosis is definitive, this long follow-up has not been possible in any published epidemiologic study of PD. Because differing diagnostic methods can result in differences in the persons studied, these methods should be reviewed critically in all epidemiologic studies of PD. For example, the level of expertise of the diagnosticians can affect diagnostic accuracy dramatically. In some communities, essential tremor accounted for 10% to 40% of the false-positive diagnoses of PD.94, 104 Conversely, bona fide PD may be misdiagnosed as depression or, in the very elderly, \u201cnormal\u201d aging.

In 1958, Kurland80 reported an estimated combined prevalence of 187 per 100,000 for postencephalitic, arteriosclerotic, and nonarteriosclerotic parkinsonism in the population of Rochester, Minnesota. Annual disease incidence was estimated to be 20 per 100,000 persons. Case identification was performed through the records linkage system of the Mayo Clinic. Those residents not seeking medical care would have been missed by this method. Because PD has significant associated disability, however, most cases were likely identified. In 1967, Gudmundsson55 identified PD cases in Iceland by physicians' reports and personal examination, estimating a combined annual incidence of 16 per 100,000 cases for arteriosclerotic and nonarteriosclerotic parkinsonism. Estimated prevalence for these two disorders was 162 per 100,000, an estimate similar to that for Rochester, Minnesota. Numerous subsequent surveys have used variations on these methods with a variety of available health care records (e.g., national health registries; pharmacy rosters; hospital and chronic care facility rosters; questionnaires directed to physicians, nurses, and social workers.) to identify persons with PD. *\nAll of these studies would have missed early cases and cases not receiving medical care.103, 129 Pharmacy drug-sale rosters have been shown to overestimate PD prevalence, especially in women.25 Diagnostic errors, therefore, could have caused increased or decreased inclusion of actual cases. Results from many of these are shown in Table 1\n.",

Changes in disease frequency over long periods, however, are very difficult to measure reliably because of changes in and inconsistent application of diagnostic criteria. Additionally, many studies rely on death record analysis for ascertaining cases, introducing great variability owing to the inconsistent reporting of PD as a cause of death. Their shortcomings acknowledged, these studies show consistent dramatic changes in PD-related mortality. During the past 2 to 3 decades, irrespective of geographic location, death rates have fallen for those younger than age 65 and increased in those older than age 75.24, 26, 64, 83, 146, 150 These observations are compatible with improved survival due to levodopa therapy, with mean age at death increasing approximately 5 years during the past 20 years.83, 149\n",

Other differences among the populations studied, however, such as underlying age distribution and use of medical care, also could cause such differences in prevalence. Exceptions to the above findings are two door-to-door studies\u2014one performed in Copiah County, Mississippi,130 and the other in a Parsi colony in Bombay, India.12 Prevalence in Copiah County was similar between whites and blacks, if cases were chosen using the least stringent diagnostic criteria (i.e., possible Parkinson's disease), although whites continued to have higher prevalence if more rigorous criteria (i.e., probable Parkinson's disease) were used to identify cases. In the Parsi community in Bombay, prevalence was similar to that found in Europe and North America. The Parsis are Persian descendants who migrated to India between the seventh and tenth centuries. They formed a closed community into which conversion is impossible. These facts may account for the high prevalence observed, despite their Asian residence.",

Examination-verified idiopathic PD indistinguishable from sporadic PD was found in 13 of 69 living first-degree relatives, leading the authors to propose an autosomal-dominant pattern of inheritance with reduced penetrance. Payami et al112 studied PD frequency in 586 first-degree relatives of 114 PD patients ascertained from a movement disorder clinic and in a similar number of controls. All affected relatives had been diagnosed by a community physician. Relatives of PD patients were 3.5 times more likely to have PD than relatives of controls, again suggesting an autosomal-dominant pattern. Notwithstanding their possible significance, it must be emphasized that neither of these studies used population-based methods, and it cannot be assumed that these findings are generalizable to the population at large. Additionally, these studies assess the probability of a positive family history of PD given that the proband has PD, when the real question regards the probability of PD given a positive family history.",

PD, however, is a disorder of late life. If onset age differs significantly between twins, and one twin dies before symptoms are apparent, genetically concordant twins may appear to be discordant. A recent positron emission tomography (PET) scan study by Burn et al18 supports this possibility. They looked at putamenal18 F-dopa uptake in twin pairs discordant for PD clinically and found that 30% to 40% of asymptomatic cotwins had significantly decreased uptake. Similar PET scan results were reported recently by Piccini et al.113 Concordance rates for decreased18 F-dopa uptake, however, did not differ for monozygotic and dizygotic twins, arguing against a classic Mendelian autosomal-dominant cause of this observation. Moreover, the relationship between this radiographic finding and subsequent clinically or pathologically diagnosed PD is unknown. Neither is the population prevalence of decreased putamenal18 F-dopa uptake well understood. Prospective observation of these and other cases will be useful in determining the significance of these interesting findings.",

This observation sparked a search for naturally occurring environmental factors that might be causally related to idiopathic PD. One key aspect to the search for environmental causes of PD, in contrast to MPTP, is that signs of idiopathic PD develop very gradually. Substances that are mildly toxic, or which ingress or accumulate in the brain slowly, are difficult to evaluate, and their significance could be missed.144\n",

A similar pattern of recall is seen in other neurologic diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease, in which prospectively collected information shows no association between head injury and disease, but retrospectively collected information typically suggests that head trauma is associated with Alzheimer's disease.21 It is most likely that the reported association between head trauma and PD reflects biased recall, rather than a cause/effect association.

Five studies, however, found no association between smoking and PD.14, 60, 99, 118, 140 Two of these studies, performed in China or Hong Kong, raise questions concerning any protective effect of cigarette smoking. Smoking is extremely rare among Chinese women but relatively common among men, but PD occurs in Chinese men nearly four times more often than in Chinese women.87, 140 If smoking exerted a true biologic protective effect, a higher prevalence of PD would be expected in the nonsmoking Chinese women than in men.",

Nonetheless, given the consistency and strength of the inverse association and the suggestion of a dose\u2013response relationship in a large prospective study, the bulk of epidemiologic evidence supports a potentially protective effect of cigarette smoking on PD risk.

Evidence increasingly suggests that, like many other chronic age-related diseases, PD is a multifactorial disorder, with both genes and environment contributing to risk. As the elderly population of the world grows, incidence and prevalence of PD will continue to increase, underscoring the importance of further delineating risk factors. The introduction of levodopa and other pharmacologic therapies over the last 2 decades has postponed disease morbidity and mortality, but morbidity and mortality still are increased markedly relative to unaffected individuals. The development of therapies that may slow disease progression makes early identification and treatment of PD particularly important. Investigations of early markers of PD, or markers of disease susceptibility, are critical areas for future research. These efforts all will be aided by careful collaboration between epidemiologists and laboratory scientists.",
