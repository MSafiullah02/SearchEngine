Most of them are junk DNA and do not have functions. If we fi nd evolutionary conservation, however, these conserved regions should have some function through purifying selection. From the initial stage of molecular evolutionary studies, protein noncoding regions were suspected to be involved in gene regulation (Zuckerkandl and Pauling 1965; Britten and Davidson 1971; King and Wilson 1975). Now it is becoming clear that at least some noncoding regions play important roles in gene regulation (e.g., Carroll 2005;[ 55 ]). The functional elements are expected to evolve more slowly than surrounding nonfunctional DNA, as they are under purifying selection. Therefore, conserved noncoding sequences (CNSs) are likely to be important from the functional point of view.Animal CNSs were discovered by comparison of human and fugu fi sh genome sequences byHow et al. (1996; [ 52 ]). CNS analyses have been proved to be powerful for detecting regulatory elements (e.g., Hardison 2000; [ 53 ], Levy et al. 2001; [ 54 ]). Bejarano et al.
