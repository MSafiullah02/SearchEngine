            "text": "The selectin family of lectins consists of three closely related cell-surface molecules with differential expression by leukocytes (L-selectin), platelets (P-selectin), and vascular endothelium (E-and P-selectin). Structural identity of a selectins resides in its unique domain composition (Chap. 26). E-, P-, and L-selectin are >60 % identical in their NH2 terminus of 120 amino acids, which represent the lectin domain (Chaps. 26, 27, and 28) . The ligands (counter structures) of selectins are sialylated and fucosylated carbohydrate molecules which, in most cases, decorate mucin-like glycoprotein membrane receptors. Their common structure consists of an N-terminal Ca 2+ -dependent lectin-type domain, an epidermal growth factor (EGF)-like domain, multiple short consensus repeat (SCR) domains similar to those found in complement regulatory proteins, a transmembrane region, and a short cytoplasmic C-terminal domain. Together this arrangement results in an elongated structure which projects from the cell surface, ideal for initiating interactions with circulating leucocytes. The lectin domain forms the main ligand binding site, interacting with a carbohydrate determinant typified by fucosylated, sialylated, and usually sulphated glycans such as sialyl Lewis X (s-Le X ). The EGF domain may also play a role in ligand recognition. The short consensus repeat (SCR) domains (two for L-selectin, six for E-selectin, and nine for P-selectin) probably act as spacer elements, ensuring optimum positioning of the lectin and EGF domains for ligand interaction. The EGF repeats have comparable sequence similarity. Each complement regulatory-like module is 60 amino acids in length and contains six cysteinyl residues capable of disulfide bond formation. This feature distinguishes the selectin modules from those found in complement binding proteins, such as complement receptors 1 and 2, which contain four cysteines (Chap. 26).",

Activation of endothelial cells (EC) with different stimuli induces the expression of E-and P-selectins, and other adhesion molecules (ICAM-1, VCAM-1), involved in their interaction with circulating cells. Lymphocytes home to peripheral lymph nodes (PLNs) via high endothelial venules (HEVs) in the subcortex and incrementally larger collecting venules in the medulla. HEVs express ligands for L-selectin, which mediates lymphocyte rolling (Horstman et al. 2004) . For structure and functions of selectins, the readers are advised to consult Chaps 26-28.

Atherosclerosis is a diffuse process that starts early in childhood and progresses asymptomatically through adult life. Later in life, it is clinically manifested as coronary artery disease (CAD), stroke, transient ischaemic attack (TIA), and peripheral arterial disease. From the clinical point of view, we should envision this disease as a single pathologic entity that affects different vascular territories. A suggestive analogy is that TIA and intermittent claudication are the unstable angina of the brain and lower limbs, respectively; and stroke and gangrene are the myocardial infarction. Circulating platelets display reversible interactions with atherosclerotic lesions. Atherosclerotic arterial disease is associated with an increased share of platelets unable to express P-selectin and an increased fraction of platelets that microaggregate in citrate anticoagulant. These platelet alterations are not completely explained by either focal arterial injury or abnormal rheology associated with arterial stenosis but appear to be an effect of the atherosclerotic process (McBane et al. 2004 ). The pathogenesis of arterial thrombotic disease involves multiple genetic and environmental factors related to atherosclerosis and thrombosis.",

The causes of injury include lipids, immune complexes, microorganisms, smoking, hypertension, aging, diabetes mellitus and trauma. The selectins are thought to be largely responsible for the initial attachment and rolling of leukocytes on stimulated vascular endothelium. Platelet activation is an important process in the pathogenesis of atherothrombosis. Platelet adhesion, activation, and aggregation at the sites of vascular endothelial disruption caused by atherosclerosis are key events in arterial thrombus formation. Platelet tethering and adhesion to the arterial wall, particularly under high shear forces, are achieved through multiple high-affinity interactions between platelet membrane receptors (integrins) and ligands within the exposed subendothelium, most notably collagen and von Willebrand factor (vWF) . Platelet adhesion to collagen occurs both indirectly, via binding of the platelet glycoprotein (GP) Ib-V-IX receptor to circulating vWF, which binds to exposed collagen, and directly, via interaction with platelet receptors GP VI and GP Ia/IIb. Platelet activation, initiated by exposed collagen and locally generated soluble platelet agonists (primarily thrombin, ADP, and thromboxane A2), provides the stimulus for the release of platelet-derived growth factors, adhesion molecules and coagulation factors, activation of adjacent platelets, and conformational changes in the platelet a(IIb)b3 integrin (GP IIb/IIIa receptor). Platelet aggregation, mediated primarily by interaction between the activated platelet GP IIb/IIIa receptor and its ligands, fibrinogen and vWF, results in the formation of a plateletrich thrombus (Steinhubl and Moliterno 2005) .",

            "text": "P-selectin expression in platelets is elevated in disorders associated with arterial thrombosis such as coronary artery disease, acute myocardial infarction, stroke, and peripheral artery disease. During thrombosis, P-selectin is expressed on the surface of activated endothelial cells and platelets. P-selectin mediates rolling of platelets and leukocytes on activated endothelial cells as well as interactions of platelets with leukocytes. Platelet P-selectin interacts with PSGL-1 on leukocytes to form platelet-leukocyte aggregates. Furthermore, this interaction of P-selectin with PSGL-1 induces the upregulation of tissue factor, several cytokines in leukocytes and the production of procoagulant microparticles, thereby contributing to a prothrombotic state. P-selectin is also involved in platelet-platelet interactions, i. e. platelet aggregation which is a major factor in arterial thrombosis. P-selectin interacts with platelet sulfatides, thereby stabilizing initial platelet aggregates formed by GPIIb/IIIa-fibrinogen bridges. Inhibtion of the P-selectin-sulfatide interaction leads to a reversal of platelet aggregation. Thus, P-selectin plays a significant role in platelet aggregation and platelet-leukocyte interactions, both important mechanisms in the development of arterial thrombosis. Following activation, P-selectin is rapidly translocated to the cell surface (Merten and Thiagarajan 2004; Wang et al. 2005 ).",

In addition, in patients with MS, there was no difference in the plasma levels of sP-selectin between the left and right atrial blood and between peripheral and atrial blood.

Though the inflammatory nature of atherosclerosis has been established, the initial events that trigger this response in the arterial intima remain obscure. Studies reveal a significant rate of genomic alterations in human atheromas. The accumulation of genomic rearrangements in vascular endothelium and smooth muscle cells are important for disease development. It is well accepted that the induction of EC adhesion molecules is a critical component in acute inflammatory responses as well as allogeneic interactions in vascularized allografts and, possibly, atherogenesis. Inflammation and genetics are both prominent mechanisms in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis and arterial thrombosis. Accordingly, population studies have explored the association of ischaemic heart disease with gene polymorphisms of the inflammatory molecules: tumor necrosis factors (TNF) a and b, transforming growth factors (TGF) b1 and 2, P and E selectins, and platelet endothelial cell adhesion molecule (PECAM) 1. The partly conflicting data provide some evidence that alterations in the genetics of the inflammatory system may modify the risk of ischaemic heart disease.",

            "text": "(ROS) as an Initial Event In recent years, reactive oxygen species (ROS) are considered as initial event in causing atherosclerosis. ROS are a family of molecules including molecular oxygen and its derivatives produced in all aerobic cells. Excessive production of ROS, outstripping endogenous antioxidant defense mechanisms, has been implicated in processes in which they oxidize biological macromolecules, such as DNA, protein, carbohydrates, and lipids. Many ROS possess unpaired electrons and thus are free radicals. These include molecules such as superoxide anion (O 2 \u00c0 ), hydroxyl radical (HO \u2022 ), nitric oxide (NO \u2022 ), and lipid radicals. Other reactive oxygen species, such as hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), peroxynitrite (ONOO \u00c0 ), and hypochlorous acid (HOCl), are not free radicals per se but have oxidizing effects that contribute to oxidant stress. The cellular production of one ROS may lead to the production of several others via radical chain reactions. For example, reactions between radicals and polyunsaturated fatty acids within cell membrane may result in a fatty acid peroxyl radical (R-COO \u2022 ) that can attack adjacent fatty acid side chains and initiate production of other lipid radicals. Lipid radicals produced in this chain reaction accumulate in the cell membrane and may have a myriad of effects on cellular function, including leakage of the plasmolemma and dysfunction of membrane-bound receptors. Of note, end products of lipid peroxidation, including unsaturated aldehydes and other metabolites, have cytotoxic and mutagenic properties. A decline in NO bioavailability may be caused by decreased expression of the endothelial cell NO synthase (eNOS), a lack of substrate or cofactors for eNOS (Fig. 44.1 and 44.2) .",

Significant genomic alterations were found on 1q22-q25 in Sel-L gene. The message indicated somatic DNA rearrangements, on loci associated to leukocyte adhesion, vascular smooth muscle cells growth, differentiation and migration, to atherosclerosis development as an inflammatory condition (Arvanitis et al. 2005) . Wenzel et al. (1999) and Yoshida et al. (2003) described an adenine to cytosine (A/C) substitution for cDNA position 561 resulting in an amino acid exchange from serine to arginine at position 128 (S/R or Ser 128 Arg) was detected in the epidermal growth factor (EGF) domain. A higher mutation frequency was observed in patients aged 50 years or less with proven severe atherosclerosis as well as in patients aged 40 years or less. If Ser 128 Arg substitution had an effect on the adhesion of blood cells to the endothelium, the polymorphism could be of interest with respect to association studies in a number of pathological conditions, such as cardiovascular diseases. The Ser 128 Arg polymorphism is associated with a higher risk for early severe atherosclerosis. Yoshida et al. (2003) suggested that the Eselectin Ser 128 Arg polymorphism could functionally alter leukocyte-endothelial interactions as well as biochemical and biological consequences, which may account for the pathogenesis of myocardial infarction .",

Miller et al. (2004b) suggested that the Thr 715 Pro C allele was rare in blacks (0.8 %) and intermediate in South Asians (3.0 %) compared to whites (11.2 %). sP-selectin levels were significantly lower in the individuals with the AC or CC compared to the AA genotype in both whites and South Asians. Thus, in whites and South Asians the C allele of the Thr 715 Pro P-selectin polymorphism is associated with (Hamilton et al. 2004) . Excessive production of ROS has been implicated in processes in which they oxidize biological macromolecules, such as DNA, protein, carbohydrates, and lipids. Many ROS possess unpaired electrons and thus are free radicals. These include molecules such as superoxide anion (O 2 \u00c0 ), hydroxyl racial (HO \u2022 ), nitric oxide (NO \u2022 ), and lipid radicals. The cellular production of one ROS may lead to the production of several others via radical chain reactions. A decline in NO bioavailability may be caused by decreased expression of the endothelial cell NO synthase (eNOS), a lack of substrate or cofactors required for eNOS action. Low-density lipoprotein (LDL) is oxidized to oxidized form of LDL (ox-LDL) and initiates the atherosclerotic process in the vessel wall (see Fig. 44 .2).

Though, the levels of sP-selectin, sE-selectin and sPECAM-1 did not differ significantly in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis, sP-selectin was substantially increased in patients with acute myocardial infarction (AMI). Yip et al. (2006) tested the hypothesis that platelet activity shown by CD62P is enhanced and predictive of both the extent of myocardial damage and 30-day clinical outcome in patients with ST-se AMI undergoing primary coronary stenting. Xu et al. (2006) suggested that activated-platelets play an important role in the process of myocardial ischemiareperfusion injury, and platelet-derived P-selectin is a critical mediator. P-selectin expression, along with CD40 ligand and tissue factor is significantly increased in infarcted rabbits with respect to controls. Clopidogrel administration reduced P-selectin expression and CD40 ligand (Molero et al. 2005) . Ox-LDL also augments expression of monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 (MCP-1) and macrophage colony stimulating factor (M-CSF). MCP-1 mediates the attraction of monocytes and leukocytes and their diapedesis through the endothelium into the intima. M-CSF plays an important role in the transformation of monocytes to macrophage foam cells. Macrophages express scavenger receptors, which internalize oxLDL in their transformation into foam cells. Migration of smooth muscle cells (SMCs) from the intima into the media is another early event initiating a sequence that leads to formation of a fibrous atheroma Hyperhomocysteinemia and Selecins in MI: Hyperhomocysteinemia is regarded as an independent risk factor for vascular diseases, and homocysteine is supposed to contribute to oxidative stress and endothelial damage. Hyperhomocysteinemia is significantly associated with MI in comparison with controls with an odd ratio of 6.26 (Khare et al. 2005) . Folic acid corrected and reduced hyperhomocysteinemia in a large majority of the cases. Although the levels of sP-selectin, sE-selectin and sPECAM-1 decrease after folic acid therapy, it was only sE-selectin which was significantly reduced.

The A 252 G polymorphism of lymphotoxin-a (LTA) gene, a member of the TNF family, is strongly related with the onset of AMI (Auer et al. 2003) . Quantitative real-time RT-PCR confirmed that LTA increased the expressions of E-Selectin and VCAM1 both in HUVEC and HCAEC, suggesting the roles of LTA in the development of atherosclerosis. Aminian et al. (2007) determined the possible role of Gly 241 Arg and Lys 469 Glu polymorphisms in development of CAD and acute or chronic MI. Although the frequency of Gly-Arg and Arg-Arg genotypes were higher in the control group compared to the CHD patients, no strong corelation was found between Gly 241 Arg and Lys 469 Glu polymorphisms and occurrence of CHD and MI in population from Iran.",

This suggests that in disorders such as ischemia/reperfusion injury, in which both complement and P-selectin have been shown to play a role, complement activation is a primary event and the effects of P-selectin are secondary. In mouse kidney model of I/R injury, results indicated that complement and P-selectin-mediated pathways of renal reperfusion injury are mutually independent (Farrar et al. 2004 ). Induction of circulating polymorphonuclear neutrophils (PMNs) might contribute to the superior outcome following stenting and early intervention compared to conventional balloon angioplasty (PTCA). A substantial increase in sE-selectin levels early after PTCA and stent implantation may predict development of restenosis (Heider et al. 2006; Kilickap et al. 2004) . After reperfusion of myocardial vessels, P-selectin expressed on majority of vessels (77 %) though the expression decreased during subsequent remaining duration of reperfusion (Chukwuemeka et al. 2005) . In rats, the mRNA expression for several genes was associated with inflammation after transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO). Gene expression increased in the injured hemisphere for IL-1b, IL-6 and ICAM-1. TNF-a mRNA was upregulated in the injured versus uninjured hemisphere, while E-selectin mRNA showed a significant increase from 6 to 24 h after MCAO (Berti et al. 2002) . Both P-selectin and LFA-1 may be important targets to control pathologic inflammation in I/R-induced tissue injury in the colon (Riaz et al. 2002) . The study in intestinal ischemia and reperfusion injury (IR/I) using murine models demonstrated the importance of P-selectin in warm and cold IR/I. The blockade of P-selectin using rPSGL1-lg or the absence of P-selectin KO mice confers a survival advantage and reduction in tissue injury. The mechanism appears to be independent of neutrophil infiltration (Carmody et al. 2004 ). Enterocyte apoptosis is increased following intestinal I/R injury. Hyperoxia following intestinal I/R in rat increased E-selectin expression in the jejunum and ileum and a concomitant increase in neutrophil recruitment in the ileum, accompanied by increased cell apoptosis (Braun et al. 2004; Sukhotnik et al. 2008) . Germ cell-specific apoptosis that occurs after I/R of murine testis is dependent on neutrophil recruitment to the testis and is dependent on E-selectin.",

P-and E-selectin mediate initial leukocyte adhesion, whereas beta 2-integrin/ICAM-1 and VLA-4/ VCAM-1 pathways mediate leukocyte arrest and transendothelial migration. Because VLA-4 expression is restricted to eosinophils and lymphocytes, VCAM-1 has been implicated in selective eosinophil recruitment characterizing allergic inflammation.

The cutaneous lymphocyte-associated antigen (CLA), which is expressed on peripheral skin-homing helper memory T cells in healthy persons, is at least partly the sialyl 6-sulfo Le x determinant (Ohmori et al. 2006 ) and a ligand for selectins. The differential polyadenylation of E-selectin transcripts may provide the molecular basis for the observed chronic expression of E-selectin in human dermal disorders. In atopic dermatitis, patients express ICAM-1 and ICAM-3, E-selectin and L-selectin (60 %) in the dermis, without expression of E-and L-selectins in the epidermis. A high expression of adhesion molecules in the skin lesions of atopic dermatitis patients may play an important role in the pathogenesis of atopic dermatitis (Lugovic et al. 2006) . The blood markers for atopic dermatitis, including soluble forms of Eselectin, VCAM-1 and ICAM-1 were reduced after treatment with cetiridine (Izu and Tokura 2005) . The extracts from dust mites, Dermatophagoides farinae, D. pteronyssinus and Euroglyphus maynei with and without endotoxin (LPS) stimulated endothelial cells to express ICAM-1, VCAM-1, and E-selectin and to secrete IL-6, IL-8, MCP-1, and GM-CSF. Serum levels of sE-selectin are higher in children with measles than in children with atopic dermatitis, atopic asthma and healthy controls. But it was not correlated with measles. There was no correlation between sE-selectin and TNF-a level (Park et al. 2008) . Pollinosis from Parietaria judaica is one of the main causes of allergy in the Mediterranean area. The treatment of endothelial cells with pollen extract causes an increase of E-selectin and VCAM-1 protein levels as well as an increase of IL-8 production. The stimulation of cell adhesion molecules was paralleled by an increase of adhesion of polymorphonuclear cells (PMNs) to HMVEC-L monolayer (Taverna et al. 2008 ).",

Eosinophil migration from blood stream to nasal polyps involves different molecules such as ICAM-1, VCAM-1, and L-, P-and Eselectins. Patients with nasal polyposis exhibit a higher expression of VCAM-1, E-selectin, and L-selectin compared to healthy controls .

Studies suggest that P-selectin has a substantial role in the pathogenesis of the lung injury induced by LPS (Ohnishi et al. 1999 ). In bleomycin-induced fibrosis in mice, the L-selectin and/or ICAM-1 deficiency inhibited skin and lung fibrosis with decreased Th2 and Th17 cytokines and increased Th1 cytokines. In contrast, P-selectin deficiency, E-selectin deficiency with or without P-selectin blockade, or PSGL-1 deficiency augmented the fibrosis in parallel with increased Th2 and Th17 cytokines and decreased Th1 cytokines. Yoshizaki et al. (2010) suggest that L-selectin and ICAM-1 regulate Th2 and Th17 cell accumulation in skin and the lung, leading to the development of fibrosis, and that P-selectin, E-selectin, and PSGL-1 regulate Th1 cell infiltration, resulting in the inhibition of fibrosis (Yoshizaki et al. 2010) . Adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) appears to develop as the acute lung injury in the course of many severe diseases, as the result of damage of alveolar-capillary barrier. Clinical observations suggest that analysis of E-, P-selectin and ICAM-1 concentrations in the serum of patients with ARDS may be helpful in monitoring the course and treatment of the disease (Skiba-Choi\u0144ska and Rogowski 1996). In the pathogenesis of paracoccidioidomycosis, Gonzalez et al. (2005) suggest that during early stages, up-regulation of ICAM-1, VCAM-1, CD18 and Mac-1 expression may participate in the inflammatory process.",

ICAM-1, VCAM-1, and E-selectin are newly synthesized prior to spontaneous asthma attacks, and their expression may play a key role in eosinophil infiltration into the airway (Ohkawara et al. 1995) . Crude extract of D. farinae induces ICAM-1 expression in EoL-1 cells through signaling pathways involving both NF-kB and JNK ). Kirchberger et al. (2006) demonstrated that signaling via ICAM-1 induces adhesiveness of mononuclear phagocytes, which critically involves PECAM-1 and is mediated via LFA-1/ICAM-3. The most common acute infection in humans, Human Rhinovirus (HRV) is a leading cause of exacerbations of asthma and chronic obstruction pulmonary disease. ICAM-1 is a critical target-docking molecule on epithelial cells for 90 % HRV serotypes. ICAM-1 regulates not only viral entry and replication but also signaling pathways that lead to inflammatory mediator production (Lau et al. 2008; Lee et al. 2008 ). The sICAM-1 but not sE-selectin from patients with asthma is significantly higher than healthy controls. Although serum levels of sICAM-1 are higher in asthmatics, it may be necessary to establish individual baseline values for serial estimation to evaluate their clinical relevance (Bijanzadeh et al. 2009 ). The serum levels of sICAM-1 were significantly higher in obese nonasthmatic and obese asthmatic children versus control and lean asthmatic children . P-selectin is an important controller of the inflammation by mediating selective eosinophil cell influx to the lung. It can be used as a sensitive marker in mild asthma (Sjosward et al. 2004 ).",

Increased adhesion molecule expression and avidity changes occurring with cellular activation are the principal methods regulating leukocyte adhesion. Although differences between specific autoimmune diseases exist, key interactions facilitating the development of autoimmune inflammation appear to include L-selectin/P-selectin/E-selectin, LFA-1/ ICAM-1, very late antigen-4 (VLA-4)/VCAM-1, and a4B7/ MadCAM or VCAM-1 adhesion. A vast array of adhesive interactions occurs between immunocompetent cells, endothelium, extracellular matrix, and target tissues during the evolution of an autoimmune disease. Dermatitis herpetiformis (DH) and bullous pemphigoid (BP), the autoimmune diseases, are characterized by destruction of the basement membrane zone (BMZ) and anchoring fibres by autoantibodies and infiltration. Skin biopsies from patients with DH, with BP, and from healthy subjects showed the expression of E and L selectins mainly in the skin leukocytes in all samples where as b1, b3 integrins was detected mainly in basal keratinocytes. Integrins and selectins seem to play an important role in the destruction of BMZ in DH and BP (Erkiert-Polguj et al. 2009 ). P-selectin levels were significantly higher than normal in RA and SSc, but not in SLE. In contrast, mean L-selectin levels were significantly higher than normal in SLE, but not in RA or SSc. Where as soluble IL-2 receptors in patients with active RA, SSc and SLE were almost double the normal level, showing a strong positive correlation only between L-selectin and sIL-2R, and only in patients with SLE. These findings indicated a distinct pattern of immune cell activation in chronic diseases that share an over-activation of T-lymphocytes (Sfikakis and Mavrikakis 1999).",

Diabetes mellitus type 1 (Type 1 diabetes or T1DM, also called insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus-IDDM, or, formerly, juvenile diabetes) is a form of diabetes mellitus that results from autoimmune destruction of insulin-producing b cells of the pancreas. The chronic hyperglycemic state in T1DM patients produces an aggression to vascular endothelium leading to a premature development of atherosclerosis. In both boys and girls, sEselectin is an early marker of endothelial dysfunction and a probable risk marker of atherosclerosis in children with T1DM (Carrizo et al. 2008) . The levels of C-reactive protein, E-selectin, and cytokines in association with severity index were significantly increased in T1DM and type 1 diabetic patients with microvascular complications (T1DM-MV patients) compared with control subjects (Devaraj et al. 2007 ). Nerve microvasculitis and ischemic injury appear to be the primary and important pathogenic alterations in lumbosacral radiculoplexus neuropathy (LRPN) of patients with diabetes mellitus (DLRPN) and without diabetes mellitus (LRPN). The up-regulation of inflammatory mediators target different cells at different disease stages and that these mediators may be sequentially involved in an immune-mediated inflammatory process that is shared by both DLRPN and LRPN (Kawamura et al. 2008) . Adhesion molecules are upregulated in endothelial cells of the placental bed in pregnancies complicated by T1DM in association with increased adherence of peripheral blood monocytes. The increase in monocyte adhesion to decidual endothelial cells from diabetic pregnancies was associated with increased endothelial cell expression of ICAM-1, but not VCAM-1. ICAM-1 expression in normal decidual endothelial cells was stimulated by pro-atherogenic and proinflammatory stimuli (Xie et al. 2008; Telejko et al. 2009 ).",

The current evidence supporting the role of inflammation in the early phases of clinical and experimental DN has been reviewed (Fornoni et al. 2008) . Inflammatory markers such as IL-18 and TNF-a are increased in the serum of patients with diabetes and DN. This occurs at an early stage of disease, and correlates with the degree of albuminuria.

Serum levels of ICAM-1, ICAM-3, VCAM-1, L-selectin, and E-selectin have been detemined in children with a variety of pediatric rheumatic diseases. A trend toward higher levels of sE-selectin was found in vasculitis vs other diagnoses. The sICAM-1 was higher in patients with active vs inactive disease across all diagnoses. Report suggests that (1) elevated E-selectin levels in vasculitis likely reflect the high degree of endothelial activation and possibly overt vascular damage in those conditions. (2) The correlation of sL-selectin with C4 in SLE may indicate that downregulation of shedding of cell surface L-selectin is involved in continued adherence of leukocytes to endothelium, possibly causing further damage and immune complex deposition in this condition. (3) The trend toward inverse correlation between sE-selectin and vWF:Ag in diabetes mellitus is interesting. (4) Levels of sICAM-I may be a useful marker of active vs quiescent disease in general in the pediatric rheumatic diseases, although lack of correlation with disease activity indices indicates that it is too insensitive to smaller differences in disease activity to be recommended for routine clinical use (Bloom et al. 2002) .",

            "text": "Considerable evidence indicates that patients with Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) are at greater risk of developing atherosclerosis and cardiovascular disease. Atherosclerotic cardiovascular mortality is increased in RA patients. The markers proposed for assessing RA activity include rheumatoid factor, anti-citrullinated protein/peptide antibodies, IgM anti-IgG advanced glycation end products, markers of bone/ cartilage metabolism, mannose-binding lectin, E-selectin, IL-6, and leptin. Various studies have investigated the correlation between some of these markers and other variables that might indicate disease activity, e.g., inflammatory activity tests and disease activity scores. However, there is as yet insufficient evidence that any of these markers, in isolation or in combination, are useful in the assessment of RA activity. Many numerous endothelial cells become positive for Eselectin and E-selectin mRNA in RA synovial membranes and the E-selectin expression appeared to correlate with inflammatory activity. P-selectin deficiency in mice resulted in accelerated onset of joint inflammation in the murine collagen-immunized arthritis model. Mice deficient either in E-selectin or in E-selectin and P-selectin (E/P-selectin mutant) also exhibit accelerated development of arthritis compared with wild type mice in CIA model. The strong vascular expression of E-selectin indicates an activation of endothelial cells in the recruitment of cells associated with the chronic inflammation of RA (Foster et al. 2009; da Mota et al. 2009 ). E-Selectin and ICAM-1 are upregulated on the synovial endothelium, while VCAM-1 plays an important role in synovial lining layer cells and within the synovial stroma. The expression of CAMs may be blocked by mAbs and modified by nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs. (Cobankara et al. 2004) . Serum soluble adhesion molecules concentrations are down-regulated following anti-TNF-a antibody therapy combined with methotrexate (MTX) (Klimiuk et al. 2004 (Klimiuk et al. , 2007 Lev\u20ac alampi et al. 2007; Bosello et al. 2008) .",

Results suggest that both the LFA-1/ICAM-1, ICAM-3 and VLA-4/VCAM-1 pathways could play a relevant role in autoimmune thyroid disorders (Marazuela et al. 1994 ). In patients with GD, the 721 G-A polymorphism was associated with an earlier age of GD onset (before age 40) and that the 1405A-G polymorphism could predispose to Graves ophthalmopathy. It was concluded that G241R and K469E amino acid substitutions in the ICAM1 molecule could influence the intensity/duration of the autoimmunity process and the infiltration of orbital tissues (Kretowski et al. 2003) .

E-selectin was expressed on vascular endothelium with weak intensity (Saito et al. 1993) . Pisella et al.

            "text": "CAMs mediate the extravasation of leukocytes and their accumulation in inflamed intestinal mucosa. Eosinophilic inflammation is a common feature of numerous eosinophilassociated gastrointestinal (EGID) diseases. Increased intestinal expression of E-selectin has been associated with multiple organ failure and an adverse outcome. VCAM-1 is not altered in in mucosa of patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) regardless of the activity of the inflammatory process. In contrast, E-selectin was not detected in normal colonic mucosa or in colonic mucosa of patients with IBD. However, high levels of E-selectin were consistently found on endothelial surfaces in association with active inflammation in affected areas of colonic mucosa in patients with either ulcerative colitis or Crohn's colitis. In addition, E-selectin appeared to be present within neutrophils which had migrated into crypt abscesses in affected mucosa. Thus E-selectin may play an important role in facilitating leukocyte migration into sites of active IBD involvement (Koizumi et al. 1992) ICAM-1 was expressed to a greater degree in ulcerative colitis (UC) specimens. Serum ICAM-1 levels in UC patients showed lower levels than those in the control group and were found to vary according to degree of clinical severity (Ogawa et al. 2008) . Characterization of integrin expression on colonic eosinophils revealed that colonic CC chemokine receptor 3 + eosinophils express ICAM-1 counter-receptor integrins aL, aM, and b2. It appears that b2-integrin/ICAM-1-dependent pathways are integral to eosinophil recruitment in colon during GI inflammation associated with colonic injury (Forbes et al. 2006) . McCafferty et al. (1999) examined the role of P-selectin in intestinal inflammation in P-selectin deficient mice alone or in combination with either ICAM-1 or E-selectin and suggested that anti-adhesion therapy might play only a limited, beneficial role and often a detrimental role in intestinal inflammation. The sE-selectin levels of Crohn's disease patients with active disease are higher than those with remission of the disease. L-selectin does not change in patients with active disease compared to those with remission. Thus, determination of sE-selectin in children with Crohn's disease is of significance in estimation of inflammation activity (Adamska et al. 2007 ). Khazen et al. (2009) investigated mutations in CAM genes in Tunisian patients, implicated in determining susceptibility to ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn's disease (CD). A significant increase in allele frequencies of 206 L of L-selectin and the associated genotype F/L was observed in patients with UC and CD compared with controls; the L206 allele and F/L206 genotype frequencies were significantly increased in UC patients with left-sided type; whereas, the F/L206 genotype was significant in CD patients with ileocolonic location. No significant differences in allele or genotype frequencies were observed for ICAM-1 K469E, E-selectin, and PECAM-1 polymorphisms between UC patients, CD patients, and controls. Khazen et al. (2009) suggest an association of inflammatory bowel disease with allele L206 of L-selectin gene, whereas genotype L/F was associated with a subgroup of UC (left-sided type) and CD patients with more extensive location of disease and stricturing behavior.",

Severe fibrosis and increased expression of profibrotic cytokines are important hallmarks in the gastric wall of patients with systemic sclerosis (SSc; scleroderma). The CD4 + /CD8 + T cell ratio is significantly increased in SSc specimens. T cells strongly express the activation markers VLA-4, LFA-1, and ICAM-1. Endothelial cells showed corresponding surface activation with strong expression of VCAM-1 and ICAM-1. These results provide the evidence that endothelial/lymphocyte activation leading to prominent CD4 + T cell infiltration may play a key pathogenetic role within the gastric wall of patients with SSc (Manetti et al. 2008) . In patients with SSc with and without pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH), serum sICAM-1, sVCAM-1, sP-selectin and sPECAM-1 levels were higher than in healthy donors (HD) at baseline and fell to normal values after 12 months of bosentan therapy. Endothelial activation occurs in SSc, and that changes in the T cell/endothelium interplay take place in SSc-associated PAH. Bosentan seems to be able to hamper these changes and restore T cell functions in these patients (Iannone et al. 2008 ).",

Patients with PBC, primary sclerosing cholangitis and chronic active hepatitis (autoimmune) show significant increase in sICAM-1 compared with normal healthy subjects. Significant elevation in sICAM-1 is also detected in patients with inactive alcoholic cirrhosis, suggesting that impaired liver may, in part, account for the increased serum level in patients with autoimmune liver disease. In contrast, sE-selectin did not differ significantly from healthy controls. Although, peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) may be a source of sICAM-1, Thomson et al. (1994) suggested that PBMC may not be a significant source of sICAM-1 in this disease.

Wu et al.

There was no difference in allele distribution of the G 98 T polymorphism.

An increased level of sE-selectin in patients susceptible to restenosis supports a role for white blood cell/endothelial interaction in restenosis after angioplasty (Sainani and Maru 2005) . The impairment of vascular endothelial function was obvious in uremic patients with maintaining hemodialysis (MHD). The changes of ICAM-1 and E-selectin could be accepted as biochemical criterions of vascular endothelial injury . Diuresis, serum creatinine, urea, and enzyme elimination are pathological among patients with acute renal failure (ARF). Higher elimination rates of sICAM-1 and higher values of sE-selectin compared to patients without ARF indicated additional parameters for early signs of kidney damage (Dehne et al. 2008) . Both circulating and urinary TNF-a levels are increased in inflammatory chronic renal diseases. TNF-a appeared to play a crucial role in the immunopathogenesis of nephritis by the induction of chemokine, ICAM-1 and VCAM-1 expression via the activation of the intracellular MAPK signaling pathway, which may contribute to macrophage and lymphocyte infiltration Li et al. 2008) .",

A case-control study, based on linkage disequilibrium among SNPs in selectin gene cluster on chromosome 1q24-25 revealed two SNPs in the E-selectin gene (SELE8 and SELE13) and six SNPs in the L-selectin gene (SELL1, SELL4, SELL5, SELL6, SELL10, and SELL11), that were significantly associated with IgAN in Japanese patients. SELE8 and SELL10 caused amino acid substitutions from His to Tyr and from Pro to Ser for His-to-Tyr substitutions; and SELL1 could affect promoter activity of the L-selectin gene. The TGT haplotype at these three loci was associated significantly with IgAN. These SNPs in selectin genes may be useful for screening populations susceptible to the IgAN phenotype. (Takei et al. 2002) Transplant Rejection: Soluble adhesion molecules are not valuable markers for stable kidney graft (STx) rejection reaction. However, patients with chronic renal failure showed increased levels of adhesion molecules, which could reflect an impaired elimination (Alcalde et al. 1995) . The expression levels of ICAM-1 and VCAM-1 show positive correlation with the severity of graft rejection and can provide evidence for early diagnosis and prevention of CR. Chronic allograft failure (CAF) is the major cause for late graft loss in renal transplantation. ICAM-1 polymorphisms may represent a predetermined genetic risk factor for CAF. This was substantiated by the polymorphism in exon 4 at the Mac-1 binding site and in exon 6 at fifth Ig-like domain (McLaren et al. 1999) . Khazen et al. (2007) found no evidence for an association of any polymorphism with acute rejection in E-and L-selectin. During kidney reperfusion, Eselectin, ICAM-1, and VCAM-1 concentrations correlated positively with hypoxanthine concentrations during reperfusion, whereas concentrations of ICAM-1 correlated negatively with xanthine concentrations, indicating metabolic changes in renal tissue (Domanski et al. 2009 ).",

Some circulating cancer cells have been shown to extravasate to a secondary site using a process similar to inflammatory cells. The most studied ligands for CAMs expressed on cancer cells, s-Lewis a and s-Lewis x antigens, are shown to be involved in adhesion to endothelial cells by binding to E-selectin. This process, shared by inflammatory cells and cancer cells, may partially explain the link between inflammation and tumorigenesis. The adhesion of colon cancer cells to E-selectin can be directly affected by changes in the expression level of sialosyl Le a antigen. The specific lack of expression of sialosyl Le a carbohydrate structure on the surface of colon cancer cells completely abolished their adhesion to E-selectin. It is proposed that glycoproteins as well as gangliosides carrying sialosyl Le a structures, when properly exposed and present in high density on surface of cancer cells, can effectively support the adhesion of cancer cells to E-selectin (Klopocki et al. 1998; Kobayashi et al. 2007 ). In addition to endogenous ligands for L-, P-, and E-selectins (Chap. 26, 27, and 28), several proteins are found in cancer cell lines or solid tumors that act as ligands for E, L, and P selectins.

GdA is expressed in ovarian cancer where it can act as an inhibitor of lymphocyte activation and/or adhesion (Jeschke et al. 2009 ); (2) The cysteine-rich fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGF-R) represents the main E-selectin ligand (ESL-1) on granulocytes. Hepatic stellate cells (HSC) are pericytes of liver sinusoidal endothelial cells, which are involved in the repair of liver tissue injury and angiogenesis of liver metastases. HSC express FGF-R together with FucT7 and exhibit a functional E-selectin binding activity on their cell surface (Antoine et al. 2009 ). (3) Although Bcell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia (BCP-ALL) cell lines do not express the ligand PSGL-1, a major proportion of carbohydrate selectin ligand was carried by another sialomucin, CD43, in NALL-1 cells. CD43 plays an important role in extravascular infiltration of NALL-1 cells and the degree of tissue engraftment of BCP-ALL cells may be controlled by manipulating CD43 expression (Nonomura et al. 2008 ). (4) Thomas et al. (2009a) identified podocalyxin-like protein (PCLP) as an alternative selectin ligand. PCLP on LS174T colon carcinoma cells possesses E-/L-, but not P-, selectin binding activity. PCLP functions as an alternative acceptor for selectin-binding glycans. The finding that PCLP is an E-/L-selectin ligand on carcinoma cells offers a unifying perspective on the apparent enhanced metastatic potential associated with tumor cell PCLP overexpression and the role of selectins in metastasis (Thomas et al. 2009b ). (5) E-selectin has been shown to play a pivotal role in mediating cell-cell interactions between breast cancer cells and endothelial monolayers during tumor cell metastasis. The counterreceptor for E-selectin was found as CD44v4. However, CD44 variant (CD44v) isoforms was functional P-, but not E-/L-selectin ligands on colon carcinoma cells. Furthermore, a~180-kDa sialofucosylated glycoprotein(s) mediated selectin binding in CD44-knockdown cells. This glycoprotein was identified as carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA). CEA serves as an auxiliary L-selectin ligand, which stabilizes L-selectin-dependent cell rolling against fluid shear (Thomas et al. 2009b ). Zen et al. (2008) identified a~170 kDa human CD44 variant 4 (CD44v4) as E-selectin ligand, which has a high affinity for E-selectin via sLe x moieties.",

Studies on capillary morphogenesis and angiogenesis in vitro have suggested a role for E-selectin in the process of differentiation into tube-like structures. Soluble E-selectin is a potent mediator of human dermal microvascular endothelial cell (HMVEC) chemotaxis, which is predominantly mediated through the Src and the phosphatidylinositiol 3-kinase (PI3K) pathways (Kumar et al. 2003) . Gastrin-17 (G17) has marked proangiogenic effects in vivo on experimental gliomas and in vitro on HUVECs and transiently decreased the expression of E-selectin, but not P-selectin, whereas IL-8 increased the expression of E-selectin. Specific antisense oligonucleotides against E-and P-selectin decreased HUVEC tubulogenesis processes in vitro. This showed that gastrin has marked proangiogenic effects in vivo on experimental gliomas and in vitro on HUVECs. This effect depends in part on the level of E-selectin activation, but not on IL-8 expression/release by HUVECs (Lefranc et al. 2004 ).",

A DNA microarry analysis indicated that E-selectin-mediated alterations were significantly more pronounced in metastatic CRC variants SW620 and KM12SM than in the corresponding non-metastatic local SW480 and KM12C variants. The number of genes altered by E-selectin in metastatic variants was 10-fold higher than the number of genes altered in the corresponding local variants. Analysis indicated that E-selectin down regulated (at least by 1.6folds) the expression of seven genes in a similar fashion, in both metastatic cells. Confocal microscopy indicated that Eselectin down-regulated the cellular expression of HMGB1 protein and enhanced the release of HMGB1 into the culture medium. The released HMGB1 in turn, activated endothelial cells to express E-selectin (Aychek et al. 2008) .",

Extravasation is initiated by the loose adhesion of cancer cells to endothelial cells via an interaction between endothelial selectins and selectin ligands expressed by the tumor cells. Metastatic spreading is a dreadful complication of neoplastic diseases that is responsible for most deaths due to cancer. It consists in the formation of secondary neoplasms from cancer cells that have detached from the primary site. Leukocytes and tumor cells use E-selectin binding ligands to attach to activated endothelial cells expressing E-selectin during inflammation or metastasis. The formation of these secondary sites is not random and several clinical observations indicate that the metastatic colonization exhibits organ selectivity. This organ tropism relies mostly on the complementary adhesive interactions between cancer cells and their microenvironment. E-selectin and sLewis antigens might play important role in breast tumor, lymph node and liver metastasis. High levels of sE-selectin have been reported in melanoma and some epithelial tumors, especially in colorectal carcinoma. But sE-selectin may not be used as a predictive marker of metastasis in colorectal carcinoma, though high levels of sE-selectin may support diagnosis of liver metastasis (Uner et al. 2004; Eichbaum et al. 2004) . It appeared that serum levels of sE-selectin are associated with the clinical course of liver metastases from breast cancer. Eichbaum et al.

Carbohydrate antigen sLe a (CA19-9) is the most frequently applied serum tumor marker for diagnosis of cancers in the digestive organs. The normal counterpart of the determinant, namely disialyl-Le a is predominantly expressed in non-malignant epithelial cells of the digestive organs. The disialyl-Le a determinant carries one extra sialic residue attached through a 2 ! 6 linkage to GlcNAc moiety compared to cancerassociated sLe a , which carries only one 2 ! 3 linked sialic acid residue (monosialyl Lewis A) (Fig. 44.3) . Disialyl-Le a in normal epithelial cells serves as a ligand for immunosuppressive receptors such as sialic acid binding Ig-like lectins (siglec-7 and -9) expressed on resident monocytes/ macrophages and maintains immunological homeostasis of mucosal membranes in digestive organs. Epigenetic silencing of a gene for a 2 ! 6 sialyl-transferase in the early stages of carcinogenesis results in impairment of 2 ! 6 sialylation, leading to incomplete synthesis and accumulation of sLe a , which lacks the 2 ! 6 linked sialic acid residue, in cancer cells. Simultaneous determination of serum levels of sLe a and disialyl-Le a , and calculation of the sLe a / disialyl-Le a ratio provides information useful for excluding a false-positive serum diagnosis. During cancer progression in locally advanced cancers, tumor hypoxia induces transcription of several glyco genes involved in sLe a synthesis. Expression of the determinant, consequently, is further accelerated in more malignant hypoxia-resistant cancer cell clones, which become predominant clones in advanced stage cancers and frequently develop hematogenous metastasis. sLe a , as well as its positional isomer sLe a , serves as a ligand for vascular E-selectin and facilitates hematogenous metastasis through mediating adhesion of circulating cancer cells to vascular endothelium. Patients having both strong sLe a expression on cancer cells and enhanced E-selectin expression on vascular beds are at a greater risk of developing distant hematogenous metastasis (Kannagi 2007) . In a human-mouse model, the selectin ligand s-Le a is involved in in vivo extravasation of colorectal carcinoma (CRC) cells. Highly metastatic CRC cells expressing high levels of s-Le a extravasate more efficiently than non-metastatic CRC cells expressing low levels of s-Le a . Down-regulating the expression of s-Le a in CRC cells by genetic manipulations, significantly reduced CRC extravasation. The arrest and adhesion of CRC cells, and possibly of other types of cancer cells as well, to endothelium depend on the expression of the selectin ligand sLe a by the tumor cells (Ben-David et al. 2008) . 3'-Sulfo-Le a is known to be the potent ligand of E-selectin which is important in cell adhesion and migration. The serum 3'-sulfo-Le a can provide important information in patients with primary gastric cancer, which might be useful as a predictive marker especially for the detection of tumor metastasis (Zheng et al. 2009 ).",

E-selectin combined with sLe x might play an important role in lymph node metastasis in invasive micropapillary carcinoma. The expression pattern of sLe x in invasive micropapillary carcinoma suggested that the reversal of cell polarity of invasive micropapillary carcinoma might be as an important factor for the morphogenesis and possibly the pathogenesis, especially their higher rates of lymph node metastasis (Wei et al. 2010) .

            "text": "Endothelial P-Selectin as a Target of Heparin Action: Metastasis can be effectively inhibited by the anticoagulant heparin in different tumor models. At the cellular level, many of the antimetastatic effects of heparin in vivo are due to its action on P-selectin-mediated binding. Ludwig et al. (2007) addressed the potential contribution of endothelial P-selectin expression to adhesive events between the microvasculature and melanoma cells in vivo. Heparin not only inhibits P-selectin-mediated melanoma cell rolling but also attenuates melanoma metastasis formation in vivo, supporting the concept that endothelial P-selectin expression may represent an additional target of heparin in experimental melanoma lung metastasis (Ludwig et al. 2007) . The low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) significantly improved colonic inflammation in rats with trinitrobenzene sulphonic acid (TNBS) induced colitis. The effect is possibly related to inhibition of proinflammatory cytokine IL-8, but not involved platelet surface P-selectin expression (Xia et al. 2004 ). The survival benefits in patients with cancer treated with LMWH may result from a LMWHmediated effect on the immune system or on the cross-talk between platelets and tumor cells. However, survival observed with LMWH in patients with cancer apparently cannot be explained by a LMWH effect on these circulating markers (Di Nisio et al. 2005) . Nonetheless, in vivo antimetastatic effects of heparins reflect their action on Pselectin-mediated binding. Therefore, these commonly used anticoagulants widely differ in their potential to interfere with P-selectin mediated cell binding. Importantly, the superior inhibitory capacity on P-selectin function of unfractionated heparin and LMWH nadroparin as opposed to LMWH enoxaparin and synthetic heparin pentasaccharide fondaparinux strongly correlated to the inhibitory potency of each in inhibiting experimental lung metastasis in vivo. Hence, P-selectin inhibition constitutes a valuable feature to identify anticoagulants that are suitable for anticancer therapy (Ludwig et al. 2006) . Stevenson et al. (2005) studied metastasis inhibition by clinically relevant levels of various heparins and investigated the structural basis for selectin inhibition differences. Five clinically approved heparins were evaluated for inhibition of P-selectin and L-selectin binding to carcinoma cells and showed differing abilities to inhibit selectins, likely explained by size distribution. It should be possible to size fractionate heparins and inhibit selectins at concentrations that do not have a large effect on coagulation. Gao et al. (2005) prepared periodate-oxidized, borohydride-reduced heparin (RO-heparin) and tested its anticoagulant and anti-inflammatory activities. Compared with heparin, RO-heparin had greatly reduced anticoagulant activity. Intravenous administration of this compound led to reduction in the peritoneal infiltration of neutrophils in a Fig. 44.3 Structures of three carbohydrate determinants, disialyl Lewis x (Le x ), sialyl Lewis a and Lewis a (Le a ). In panel, note that the only difference between the three determinants is the linkage of sialic acid residues. The a(2 ! 6) sialic acid residue in disialyl Le a is synthesized by a sialyltransferase ST6GalNAcVI, which shows a significant decrease in its mRNA level upon malignant transformation mouse acute inflammation model. In vitro studies showed that the effect of RO-heparin on inflammatory responses was mainly due to inhibiting the interaction of P-selectin with its ligands. These results indicate that RO-heparin may be a safer treatment for inflammation than heparin, especially when selectin is targeted.",

Cancer progression and metastasis are associated with enhanced expression of heparanase, which is inhibited efficiently by heparin. Heparin is also a potent inhibitor of selectinmediated interactions. P-and L-selectin were shown to contribute to the early stages of metastasis, which is associated with platelet-tumor cell thrombi formation. Low anticoagulant heparin preparations still inhibited metastasis efficiently indicating that anticoagulation is not a necessary component for heparin attenuation of metastasis. Modified heparins characterized for heparanase inhibitory activity are also potential inhibitors of selectins. Selectin inhibition is a clear component of heparin inhibition of metastasis. The contribution of selectin or heparanase inhibition by heparin can provide evidence about its antimetastatic activity (Borsig 2007) . One of the mechanisms by which heparin inhibits metastasis is by blocking the P-selectin-based interaction of platelets with tumor cell. The sulfate groups at C6/ N and especially C6, but not C2 and C3, of heparin play a critical role in P-selectin recognition and that 2-O,3-Odesulfated heparin can block P-selectin-mediated A375 human melanoma cell adhesion. Thus chemical modification of heparin, especially 2-O,3-O-desulfation, may result in a therapeutic agent that is anti-metastatic because it blocks unwanted P-selectin-dependent adhesion but that lacks dose-limiting anticoagulant effects .",

Many of the markers of hemostatic activation processes have been found to be at increased levels during acute phases of the HIT syndromes. Since the pathophysiology of HIT involves the activation of platelets, endothelium, and leukocytes, it is expected that activation products related to these hemostatic systems, including soluble selectins, will also be increased in circulating blood. These alterations may provide an index of the pathophysiologic process. Fareed et al.

With the availability of recombinant hirudin, it is now possible to provide alternate anticoagulants to HIT patients. However, Fareed et al.

Release of soluble endothelial markers into the circulation has been demonstrated together with elevated plasma levels of CAMs and has been reported in bacteraemic patients. It has been proposed that the infection of endothelial cells with Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus sanguis, or Staphylococcus epidermidis induces surface expression of ICAM-1 and VCAM-1 and monocyte adhesion. In general, leukocyte/endothelial cell interactions such as capture, rolling, and firm adhesion should be viewed as a series of overlapping synergistic interactions among adhesion molecules resulting in an adhesion cascade. These cascades thereby direct leukocyte migration, which is essential for the generation of effective inflammatory responses and the development of rapid immune responses (Golias et al. 2007) . Helicobacter pylori is a common bacterial pathogen that infects world's population up to 50 %. Carbohydrate components on H. pylori (sequences related to Le x or Le a antigens) are responsible for the persistent inflammation through interactions with leukocyte-endothelial adhesion molecules of the host. H. pylori isolates from patients with chronic gastritis, duodenal ulcer and gastric cancer interact with E-and L-selectins (Galustian et al. 2003) . Expression of E-selectin was specifically upregulated in H. pylori-induced gastritis but not in gastritis induced by acetylsalicylic acid or pouchitis. The upregulated E-selectin expression was localized to the gastric mucosa rather than being a systemic response to the infection (Svensson et al. 2009 ).",

These mice provide strong evidence for the functional importance of selectins in vivo (Bullard et al. 1996) . Anthrax lethal toxin (LT), a key virulence factor of Bacillus anthracis, enhanced VCAM-1 expression on primary human endothelial cells suggesting a causative link between dysregulated adhesion molecule expression and the poor immune response and vasculitis associated with anthrax. Results suggest that LT can differentially modulate NF-kB target genes and highlight the importance of VCAM-1 enhancement (Warfel and D'Agnillo 2008) . Vascular endothelium stimulation in vitro that lead to the upregulation of CAMs is known for the pathogenic spirochaetes, including rLIC10365 of Leptospira interrogans. The recombinant proteins of L. interrogans in E. coli as a host were capable to promote the upregulation of ICAM-1 and E-selectin on monolayers of HUVECS. In addition, pathogenic and non-pathogenic Leptospira are both capable to stimulate endothelium E-selectin and ICAM-1, but the pathogenic L. interrogans serovar Copenhageni strain promoted a higher activation than the non-pathogenic L. biflexa serovar Patoc (Atzingen et al. 2009; G\u00f3mez et al. 2008) .

(2003) suggested that while both soluble CD23 and ICAM1 promote resting cell HIV1 infection, productive infection of cycling cells requires soluble ICAM1. Swingler et al. (2003) noted that these results may explain in part the existence of a resting T-cell reservoir infected with HIV-1. Subjects with HIV disease have multiple risk factors for cardiovascular disease, including elevated levels of ICAM-1 and VCAM-1. Many of the variables associated with ICAM-1 and VCAM-1 levels can be related to their impact on inflammation (Melendez et al. 2008 ). The LFA-1, ICAM-1, and ICAM-3 are enriched at virological synapse (VS). The cognate adhesion molecule interactions at VS are important for HIV-1 spread between T cells (Jolly et al. 2007 ). Zuccarello et al. (2002) described a distinct form of familial chronic mucocutaneous candidiasis characterized by earlyonset infections by different species of Candida, restricted to the nails of the hands and feet and associated with low serum concentration of ICAM-1. Phan and Filler (2009) measured the effects of C. albicans on the endothelial cell production of E-selectin and TNF-a in vitro. During invasive pulmonary aspergillosis, A. fumigatus hyphae invade the abluminal endothelial cell surface, whereas they invade the luminal endothelial cell surface during haematogenous dissemination. Infection with hyphae stimulates endothelial cells to synthesize E-selectin, VCAM-1, IL-8, and TNF-a in vitro. In neutropenic mice infected with wild-type A. fumigatus, increased pulmonary expression of E-selectin and TNF-a occurred only when neutropenia had resolved. In nonneutropenic mice immunosuppressed with corticosteroids, A. fumigatus stimulated earlier pulmonary expression of Eselectin and VCAM-1, while expression of ICAM-1 and TNF-a was suppressed. In both mouse models, expression of E-selectin was associated with high pulmonary fungal burden, angioinvasion, and neutrophil adherence to endothelial cells (Chiang et al. 2008; Kamai et al. 2009 ).",

Trends of positive correlations were observed between sP-selectin or vWF and temperature (Matondo et al. 2008) . Evidence from autopsy and in vitro binding studies suggests that adhesion of erythrocytes infected with Plasmodium falciparum to the human host ICAM-1 receptor is important in the pathogenesis of severe malaria. Fernandez-Reyes et al.

Serum levels of ICAM-1 were significantly correlated with the disease severity (Esterre et al. 1998) . Studies in several models of inflammation have underscored the importance of P-and E-selectins in the migration of T cells to inflamed tissues. CD4 + T cells recruited to the cutaneous compartment during infection with Leishmania major express P-and E-selectin ligands. Results suggest that by blocking P-and E-selectins, the immune pathology associated with cutaneous leishmaniasis might be ameliorated without compromising immunity to infection (Zaph and Scott 2003) . Invasive amebiasis offers a new model that poses an inadequate immune response leading to a continuous and prolonged activation of endothelial cells (ECs) by amebas, amebic molecules and cytokines, leading to necrosis. Hyperactivated endothelial cells continuously express ICAM-1 and E-selectin, pro-coagulant molecules (tissue factor, vWF, and the plasminogen activator inhibitor), resulting in ever greater inflammation and thrombosis (Campos-Rodr\u00edguez et al. 2009) ",

Newborn infants with clinical diagnosis of sepsis demonstrated significantly higher plasma sE-selectin levels in infected infants. Infants with gram-negative sepsis had higher sE-selectin levels than did those with gram-positive sepsis. C-reactive protein was the best test for diagnosis of neonatal sepsis (Zaki and el-Sayed 2009). Hofer et al.

            "text": "CAMs play important roles in a critical step of tumor metastasis and arrest of tumor cells onto the venous or capillary bed of the target organ. In this process, IL-1b induces nuclear translocation of NF-kB in HUVE cells, followed by induction of cell surface expression of E-selectin, ICAM-1, and VAM-1, and subsequent adhesion of those cancer cells expressing sialyl Le X antigen, which is a ligand to E-selectin. The adhesion of tumor cells to IL-1b-treated HUVE cells can be inhibited by anti-NF-kB reagents such as N-acetyl L-cysteine, aspirin, or pentoxifylline. These observations indicate the involvement of NF-kB in cancer metastasis and the feasibility of using anti-NF-kB reagents in preventing metastasis (Tozawa et al. 1995) . Incubation of HUVEC with N,N,N-trimethylsphingosine (TMS) resulted in a dose-dependent inhibition of IL-1b-induced E-selectin expression. Sphingosine or N,N-dimethylsphingosine had no effects on the expression. This inhibitory effect of TMS on IL-1b-dependent endothelial cell activation may partly explain the known anti-inflammatory or anti-metastatic effect of TMS in vivo (Masamune et al. 1995) . Cimetidine inhibits the expression of E-selectin on vascular endothelial cells in gastric-and colorectal cancer patients, treated for chemotherapy (Kawase et al. 2005) . Since the expression of E-selectin and Mac-1 is regulated either directly or indirectly by NF-kB, studies provide in vivo evidence that tepoxalin is a potent inhibitor of NF-kB mediated events in animal models and this novel molecular mechanism clearly defines it as a new class of anti-inflammatory compounds. E-selectin transcription requires binding of transcription factors, NF-kB, ATF-2, and HMG-I(Y). HUVE cells treated with TNF-a showed E-selectin surface expression, which peaked at 4 h and then declined. However, ATF-2 binding was unchanged after stimulation with TNF-a. The termination of E-selectin expression is controlled at the level of transcription, with loss of protein-DNA interactions at only one of three NF-kB-binding sites in the E-selectin promoter (Boyle et al. 1999 ). E-selectin is synthesized following X-ray exposure to doses as low as 0.5 Gy. X-ray-induced expression of Eselectin and ICAM-1 has been proposed to contribute to radiation injury in normal tissues. E-selectin expression does not require cytokine synthesis, but involves NF-kB activation (Hallahan et al. 1995) . NFkB inhibition using NFkB inhibitors abrogates X-ray induced inflammatory mediators (Hallahan et al. 1998) . Andrographolide, the principal component of medicinal plant Andrographis paniculata, has been shown to inhibit NF-kB activity and may attenuate allergic asthma via inhibition of the NF-kB signaling pathway. Andrographolide attenuated OVAinduced lung tissue eosinophilia and airway mucus production, mRNA expression of E-selectin, and inducible NOS in lung tissues. Findings implicate a potential therapeutic value of andrographolide in the treatment of asthma Jiang et al. 2007 ).",

While TGF-b had no effect on the expression of VCAM-1 and ICAM-1, the effect was additive with IL-4 in inhibiting the expression of E-selectin. Thus, perivascular TGF-b appears to act as an inhibitor of inflammatory responses involving neutrophils and a subset of lymphocytes (Gamble et al. 1993) . IFN-g down-regulates the induction by a viral mimetic, polyinosinic-polycytidylic acid [poly-(I:C)], of E-selectin. The inhibitory effect of IFN-g on poly(I:C)induced E-selectin was specific for dsRNA.

Genes that are related to inflammation, cell adhesion and platelet aggregation include E-selectin, ICAM-1, and others (Azzi et al. 2004) . Retinoic acid and synthetic derivatives are known to exert anti-inflammatory effects in cutaneous diseases. Pretreatment with all-trans-retinoic acid (t-RA) specifically prevented TNFa-induced VCAM-1 expression, but not ICAM-1 and E-selectin induction (Gille et al. 1997) . The TNFa-mediated activation of the human VCAM-1 promoter was also inhibited after t-RA treatment, while the ICAM-1 promoter activation was unaffected, indicating that the selective inhibition of CAM expression is regulated in part at the level of gene transcription. Furthermore, the transcriptional inhibition by t-RA appears to be mediated by its effects upon the activation of NF-kB-dependent complex formation. The specific inhibition of cytokine-mediated VCAM-1 gene expression in vitro provides a potential basis by which retinoids exert their biological effects at sites of inflammation in vivo (Gille et al. 1997) . Radiationinduced expression of E-selectin was also blocked by t-RA, whereas 9-cis retinoic acid was ineffective. Application of statins and t-RA might have clinical impact in protecting against E-selectin-promoted metastasis, which might arise as an unwanted side effect from radiation treatment (Holler et al. 2009; Nubel et al. 2004 ).",

In intestine, MUC2 is the main mucin carrying s-Le x , which interacts with Eselectin. This interaction may contribute to the extravasation of tumor cells and thus to the metastases. In several colorectal carcinoma cell lines the methylation of the 5'-flanking region of MUC2 correlated with the suppression of the MUC2 gene. The increase in MUC2 expression after the inhibition of the methylation with 5-aza-2' deoxycytidine strongly supports the notion that the suppression of MUC2 gene is related to the methylation of the promoter (Riede et al. 1998 ).",

            "text": "The advances in the development of adhesion molecule blocking agents, as well as an insight into the potential of these molecules in cardiovascular therapy have been reviewed from time to time (Lutters et al. 2004 ). Prophylactic dosing of a recombinant P-selectin ligand decreases venous thrombosis in a dose-dependent fashion in both feline and nonhuman primate animal models. Additionally, treatment of 2-day iliac thrombi with a recombinant protein, P-selectin inhibitor, significantly improves vein reopening in nonhuman primates (Register 2009 ). It is interesting to note that P-selectin inhibition decreases thrombosis without adverse anticoagulation. Myers et al. (2005) evaluated an orally bioavailable inhibitor of P-selectin (PSI-697), which decreased thrombosis. Since, P-selectin is expressed on the surface of activated endothelial cells and platelets during thrombosis, targeting the plasminogen activator (PA) to Pselectin would enhance local thrombolysis and reduce bleeding risk. A urokinase (uPA)/anti-P-selectin antibody (HuSZ51) fusion protein is known to increase fibrinolysis in a hamster pulmonary embolism (Dong et al. 2004) Aspirin reduces risks of myocardial infarction, stroke and cardiovascular death (Serebruany et al. 2004 ). The impact of cyclooxygenase (COX)-2 antagonist treatment on acute coronary risk is controversial. Prolonged COX-2 inhibition attenuates CRP and IL-6, does not modify P-selectin and MMP-9, and has no deleterious effect on endothelial function in stable patients with a history of recurrent acute coronary events and raised C-reactive protein (CRP) (Bogaty et al. 2004) . Statins used in the control of hypercholesterolemia exert a protective effect on the endothelium reflected by a reduced level of circulating adhesion molecules. Statins exert a beneficial effects on endothelial function and atherosclerotic plaque, modulating oxidative stress and inflammation, with subsequent, well documented, primary and secondary prevention of CAD. Following statin treatment, sP-selectin, and ICAM-1 and highly sensitive CRP decreased compared to baseline levels. Other proteins (sVCAM-1, sE-selectin and platelet ECAM-1) did not show significant changes. In contrast to CRP, the reduction of sPselectin concentrations correlated directly with the lowering of total cholesterol and inversely with the progression of CAD (Marschang et al. 2006) ",

Salicylate blocked the TNF-ainduced increase in mRNA levels of adhesion molecules and gave a dose-dependent inhibition of TNF-a-induced surface expression of VCAM-1 and ICAM-1 with higher doses required to inhibit E-selectin expression. Ibuprofen appeared a potent inhibitor of IL-1a and TNF-a-induced surface expression of VCAM-1 and a less potent inhibitor of ICAM-1.

Access to synthetic carbohydrates is an urgent need for the development of carbohydrate-based drugs, vaccines, adjuvants as well as novel drug delivery systems. Besides traditional synthesis in solution, synthetic carbohydrates have been generated by chemoenzymatic methods as well as automated solid-phase synthesis. Synthetic oligosaccharides have proven to be useful for identifying ligands of carbohydrate-binding proteins such as C-type lectins and siglecs using glycan arrays. Furthermore, glyconanoparticles and glycodendrimers have been used for specific targeting of lectins of the immune system such as selectins, DC-SIGN, and CD22 (Lepenies et al. 2010) .",

STMC hexasaccharide is an effective inhibitor of P-selectin in vivo. P-selectin-specific STMC attenuated metastasis in animal models, indicating that inhibition of tumor cell interaction with the vascular endothelium is critical for cancer dissemination. The small size, the stability of the C-C bond, and the chemically defined structure of STMCs make them superior to heparin derivatives and signify STMCs as valuable candidates for further evaluation.",

Low-dose hydrocortisone is a new treatment of patients with septic shock, a state that is characterized by an endothelial injury. Treatment with glucocorticoids differently affected the pattern of evolution of sCAMs, with sE-selectin being decreased and sICAM-1 being increased. Expression of sP-selectin and sVCAM-1 was not affected (Leone et al. 2004) . Methotrexate (MTX) markedly reduces the expression of vascular E-selectin. A positive correlation between disease severity and the frequency of cutaneous lymphocyte-associated antigen (CLA)-positive T cells in the blood of untreated patients with psoriasis has been observed. It is suggested that MTX decreases the expression of CLA and E-selectin and that this may be a major mechanism for the therapeutic effect of MTX on psoriatic skin lesions (Sigmundsdottir et al. 2004) .",
