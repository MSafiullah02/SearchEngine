Among 646 subjects, 315 (48.8%) were tested positive for HEV. The VP4/VP2 gene were successfully amplified and sequenced for all 315 HEV-positive specimens. Phylogenetic analysis showed that 300 subjects (46.4%) were classified as HRV-positive, of whom 183 (61.0%) were infected with HRV-A, 31 (10.3%) with HRV-B and 86 (28.7%) with HRV-C (Fig. 1). The circulating HRV types determined by phylogenetic analysis were as follows: HRV-A21 (15/300, 5.0%), A31 and A47 (12/300, 4.0% each), A07 and C16 (10/300, 3.3% each), A96 (9/300, 3.0%), A20 (8/300, 2.7%), A15, A22 and A32 (7/300, 2.3% each), A13, A16, A49 and C42 (6/300, 2.0% each), A60, A80, B04, B79, C19 and C22 (5/300, 1.7% each), A40, A46, A89, B06, B48 and C01 (4/300, 1.3% each), A02, A23, A61, A101, B69, B72, C15, C34 and C35 (3/300, 1.0% each), A30, A33, A39, A43, A45, A53, A58, A59, A62, A81, A94, A100, B27, C06, C12, C13, C18, C25, C26, C27, C29, C37, C38, C44 and C45 (2/300, 0.7% each), and A10, A24, A34, A38, A44, A55, A57, A82, B26, B35, B70, B86, C02, C03, C05, C11, C30, C32, C36, C39, C46, C50, C51 and C54 (1/300, 0.3% each). In addition, HRV-A and HRV-C types that were not classified with any previously defined types were detected at 1.3% (4/300) and 2.0% (6/300), respectively. In total, 84 distinct HRV types were identified by phylogenetic analysis. In addition, 12 enterovirus D68 and three coxsackievirus A21 sequences were also detected.",

When evaluated using the EQA panel, the newly developed assay detected 9 out of 10 core and educational samples, producing a success rate of 90% (Table 1). The variability (expressed in coefficient of variation, CV) was studied by analysing EQA panel tested in triplicate. The results revealed that the intra- and inter-assay CV were 0.85% and 4.20%, respectively. The educational sample of HRV-A16, which was reported as \u201cinfrequently detected\u201d by QCMD, was not detected by the assay. The CT values recorded by the assay were largely similar to that of the panel recommended by QCMD.

Other studies however have shown contradictory findings, where no correlation between viral load and disease severity was observed2526. Although the use of real-time RT-PCR approach for HRV viral load quantification is common, a number of limitations that may result in inaccurate quantification continue to exist. To tackle these challenges, we developed a one-step real-time RT-PCR assay using specific primers and probe designed based on an updated and comprehensive list of reference sequences. The efficiency of the newly designed assay was estimated from a standard curve plotted using a serially diluted plasmid containing the HRV 5\u2032-UTR region. A constructed plot of the CT values versus the logarithm of the target concentrations is expected to be linear with a negative slope (\u22123.33 for a 10-fold dilution series) when the assay efficiency (E) is 100%27. In addition, the plot should also yield a Pearson correlation coefficient (R2) of greater than 0.9728. In our real-time RT-PCR, with an estimated E = 99.6%, R2 = 0.996 and a slope of \u22123.33 (Fig. 2A), the newly designed reagents and protocol are considered efficient and robust. In addition, its performance was further evaluated using the quality assessment panel that yielded a detection rate of 90%, of which one of the educational samples was not captured. PCR amplification of HRV VP4/VP2 gene from this sample also yielded a negative result, suggesting possible very low copy number or absence of HRV in the sample.",

Of the 315 HEV-positive nasopharyngeal swabs, HRV-A was predominantly detected, infecting over 60% of the subjects, followed by HRV-C, HRV-B and other enteroviruses. Remarkably, the assay yielded a 100% (315/315) success rate, detecting all HRV strains of different species (and types) as well as enterovirus D68 and coxsackievirus A21 (Table 1). In light of the recent enterovirus D68 outbreaks in various parts of the world29, the ability of the newly developed assay to quantify enterovirus D68 viral load in clinical specimens may be of additional value. When compared to the commercially available kit, the newly designed assay, which has a shorter turnaround time, was more robust with improved sensitivity in detecting and quantifying a broad array of HRV types in clinical nasopharyngeal specimens (Fig. 2B). In addition, due to its ability to detect other non-HRV enteroviruses, we went on to test the assay on a collection of archived specimens (collected between 1997 and 2013) of diverse non-polio enteroviruses that have been associated with various human diseases. Interestingly, the assay was able to detect and quantify these specimens, which consist of human enterovirus A71 (n = 9), coxsackieviruses (A6, A16, and B1\u2013B5) (n = 29), and echoviruses (E6, E7, E11, and E19) (n = 6), yielding a success rate of 100% (viral load data not shown). The expanded coverage beyond HRV clearly demonstrated the wide applicability of the assay on various enteroviruses, although a more comprehensive evaluation may be necessary.",

            "text": "Likewise, the availability of the improved quantification assay enables better understanding of HRV pathogenesis through the duration of viral shedding during acute respiratory infections. Previous study revealed that following a 2-day incubation period32, HRV sheds for approximately 10 days in the upper respiratory compartment following acute infection, of which the duration of respiratory tracts symptoms correlates with the duration of virus shedding33. Since 25 out of 32 of the study subjects had detectable viral load 14 days after the onset of symptoms (Fig. 3A), our data suggest that HRV could potentially shed in the respiratory tract of some individuals longer than previously reported, implying that viral transmission could still occur during the second week of infection. Therefore, optimized infection control measures as well as the course of treatment should be implemented and extended accordingly to minimize onward transmission of HRV during this period. However, since several HRV types can circulate simultaneously in the population, sequential or mixed infections by another HRV strain(s) following primary infection are not uncommon34, contributing to an increase in viral load. Nevertheless, the prolonged shedding of HRV viral load observed in this cohort should warrants further investigation especially among a larger study population. Lastly, our data revealed that HRV-C had a significantly higher viral load than HRV-A and -B, particularly during the 2\u20137 days after the onset of symptoms (Fig. 3B). This probably explains the increased disease severity attributed to HRV-C as compared to HRV-A and -B infection as recently reportedly elsewhere3536. However, such association between HRV species, viral load and the severity of respiratory illness remains debatable1024 unless a more comprehensive study involving a more in-depth sampling method spanning a longer recruitment period is conducted.",

To evaluate the effects of primers and probe mismatches on HRV quantification efficiency, 16 HRV 5\u2032-UTR that represent all 16 combinations of qR447f and R529 sequences were amplified, cloned into plasmid using pTOPO-TA cloning (Invitrogen, California, USA) and evaluated in triplicates. A standard curve of the cycle threshold (CT) values obtained from serial dilutions of the plasmid (3 \u00d7 100 to 3 \u00d7 108 copies/\u03bcl) was constructed, where the CT values of the unknown samples were plotted on the standard curve for viral load determination. The plasmid containing qR447f (5\u2032-GGCCCCTGAATGTGGCTAA-3\u2032) and R529 (5\u2032-ATGGGACCAACTACTTTG-3\u2032) sequences that covers the most HRV types was used to construct a standard curve of CT.

Briefly, the sample types correspond to the expected detection rate of the panel, in which the core samples are those commonly detected (95%) in routine testing, whereas the educational samples are samples with either low virus titre or contain new circulating strains that may be infrequently detected. In addition to the only negative control from EQA panel, three other negative controls with RNAse-free water were included in each batch of experiments.",
