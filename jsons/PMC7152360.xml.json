Work-related asthma has become the most common chronic occupational lung disease in developed countries, where occupational asthma (asthma caused by work) accounts for about 15% of all adult-onset asthma, and work-exacerbated asthma occurs in 25 to 52% of asthmatic workers. The occupational contribution of workplace dusts, fumes, and gases to chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is estimated at 15%.",

However, newer exposures that lead to silicosis include the textile industry's use of jet silica blasting of denim jeans, reported from Turkey. Newly recognized asbestos-related diseases continue to occur, owing to the long latency period between exposure and clinical disease, despite the declining exposure to asbestos in developed countries. Although annual deaths from asbestosis have now reached a plateau in North America and will likely decline, new cases of mesothelioma, which has a latency of up to 35 years or more, are not estimated to plateau until 2020.",

Once a patient has become sensitized and has developed asthma, even very small subsequent exposures can trigger asthma, sometimes including exposures that may be below the limit of measurable detection. Pulmonary function and histologic changes are similar to those in nonoccupational asthma (Chapter 87). Sensitizer-induced occupational asthma from a high-molecular-weight agent sensitizer typically causes a prompt asthmatic response within minutes after exposure with or without a late asthmatic response starting 4 to 6 hours after exposure. By comparison, responses to low-molecular-weight sensitizers typically start 4 to 6 hours after exposure.",

Supportive features include symptomatic improvement when away from work, such as weekends off work or holidays, but not necessarily in the evenings after a work shift, when symptoms from a late asthmatic response may occur. In patients who are exposed to high-molecular-weight sensitizers, allergic rhinitis or conjunctivitis associated with work frequently appears before the development of asthma. A detailed occupational history (Chapter 18) or review of material safety data sheets or occupational hygiene reports may reveal a known occupational sensitizer. However, more than 300 occupational respiratory sensitizers are currently known, and new agents or exposures are reported each year; as a result, the absence of a recognized sensitizer does not exclude occupational asthma.",

            "text": "Although the history can be very helpful, the evaluation should always include objective pulmonary function testing (Chapter 85) to confirm asthma, either when the patient has symptoms or within 24 hours of the typical suspected work exposure (Fig. 93-1\n). Allergy skin-prick tests, blood samples, or both should be obtained to test for specific IgE antibodies to any relevant sensitizer if feasible. Serial monitoring of peak expiratory flow rates, symptom diaries, or use of rescue inhalers can provide supportive information. The results of a methacholine challenge test (Chapter 87) toward the end of a typical work week can help when compared with results after 10 days or more without exposure. A comparison of eosinophil counts in induced sputum at work and after a period away from exposure, showing higher levels when exposed, provides supportive diagnostic information. If the diagnosis is still in doubt, a carefully controlled specific inhalation challenge with the suspected workplace sensitizer can be performed. Each investigation can be falsely positive or negative, so a combination of investigations is advised while the patient continues to work until the diagnosis is confirmed. Given the specialized nature of many of these studies, consultation with a specialist is recommended. The main differential diagnosis for patients with confirmed asthma is the coincidental onset of asthma with subsequent work-exacerbated asthma. Other conditions, such as vocal cord dysfunction, may explain symptoms or may coexist with asthma and confound the diagnosis.Treatment and Prevention The optimal management of patients with sensitizer-induced occupational asthma includes complete removal from further exposure to the sensitizer and cross-reacting agents combined with the usual pharmacologic approach to the treatment of asthma (Chapter 87) and advocacy for appropriate workers\u2019 compensation. Consideration of the other exposed workers typically includes communication with the workplace or public health officials, in the hope that measures may be instituted to protect other workers from similar exposures and symptoms. Recommendations for primary prevention have been to reduce exposures to occupational sensitizers as far as possible, removing unnecessary sensitizing agents (e.g., removing high-powdered and high-protein latex gloves) and limiting exposures to sensitizers with occupational hygiene measures. Ongoing medical surveillance measures in the workplace may also be of value.\n",

            "text": "Work-exacerbated asthma is defined as asthma that is not caused by work but is aggravated or exacerbated by work conditions. Asthma may have been present before starting employment or may begin coincidentally during employment, but it is not caused by work. Work exposures that commonly exacerbate asthma include extreme temperature or humidity, exertion, dusts, fumes, and gases. Patients may be exposed at work to common environmental allergens (e.g., fungal allergens in an office setting or dust mites or animals in domestic settings) that exacerbate asthma in patients who are sensitized to these allergens. Symptoms of work-exacerbated asthma may occur transiently with an unusual work exposure (e.g., during renovation in a work building) or may occur on a daily basis (e.g., daily exposure to fumes while performing physical exertion in an industrial setting).Diagnosis and Treatment Transient work-exacerbated asthma is commonly diagnosed on the basis of the history of work exposures and the associated increase in asthmatic symptoms, medication requirements, or unscheduled physician visits. The recommended evaluation of patients with daily or frequent work exacerbations of asthma is similar to that for patients with suspected occupational asthma. Work-related changes in serial peak flow recordings mimic those seen in occupational asthma, but sputum eosinophil counts typically show less of a work-related increase than is observed with occupational asthma. If the workplace exposure includes a potential work sensitizer, immunologic testing or a controlled challenge exposure may confirm whether respiratory sensitization has occurred.Management includes the same pharmacologic measures as for non-work-related exacerbations, including the optimization of pharmacologic asthma management (Chapter 87) and, when needed, adjusting the work exposures to avoid ongoing exacerbations. Occupational hygiene measures can reduce exposures, but some patients require a change in job description or work area. Workers\u2019 compensation may be available for some patients who miss work owing to work-exacerbation of asthma.\n",

Although the clinical manifestations can be dramatic, irritant-induced occupational asthma represents a relatively small proportion of all occupational asthma. The most definitive criteria for this condition are those applied to the term reactive airways dysfunction syndrome: the onset of asthma symptoms within 24 hours of the exposure, generally severe enough to lead to an unscheduled physician visit; exposure to a single high-level irritant; asthma symptoms that persist for at least 3 months; pulmonary function testing that confirms asthma with a significant beneficial response to bronchodilators or a bronchoconstrictor response to a methacholine challenge; and the lack of preexisting lung disease or other conditions to explain the symptoms. When these criteria are not completely met (e.g., symptoms start later than 24 hours after exposure or resolve within weeks after exposure), the term irritant-induced asthma is commonly applied, recognizing that this diagnosis is less certain than reactive airways dysfunction syndrome.",

If other findings are supportive of hypersensitivity pneumonitis, however, open biopsy and challenges usually are not needed.Treatment and Prognosis Treatment principles are the same as for nonoccupational hypersensitivity pneumonitis (Chapter 94). Removal from exposure to the causative agent is the primary treatment measure. As with occupational asthma from a sensitizer, the removal must be complete and often requires a change in work if the causative agent cannot be removed. Reduction of exposure by use of respiratory protective devices is generally not practical and not effective, with the exception of air-supplied helmet respirators for occasional short-term exposures. Patients with acute hypersensitivity pneumonitis may not require any medications in addition to removal from antigen exposure, but if acute episodes are severe, they may need supportive measures, including corticosteroids (e.g., 20 to 60 mg of prednisone orally per day), supplemental oxygen, and intensive care (Chapter 94). Chronic hypersensitivity pneumonitis may require additional oral corticosteroid treatment (e.g., 5 to 10 mg of prednisone orally per day) as for nonoccupational chronic hypersensitivity pneumonitis, and severe end-stage fibrosis may lead to need for lung transplantation. Prognosis is better with early diagnosis and complete removal from exposure to the causative agent.

Sensitization to beryllium can be detected by a beryllium lymphocyte proliferation test that demonstrates the presence of sensitized lymphocytes in blood or bronchoalveolar lavage fluid. This test also can detect sensitization to beryllium among asymptomatic exposed workers, who can then be evaluated to assess possible chronic beryllium disease and provided with advice for reducing or eliminating further work exposures.After disease develops, removal from exposure is advised, but the disease may still worsen. Progressive deterioration in lung function is treated similarly to sarcoidosis (Chapter 95), with oral corticosteroids and supportive measures.\n",

If extensive, it may be difficult to exclude intrapulmonary opacities except by CT scan. Pleural plaques are a marker of asbestos exposure but do not occur in all workers with significant asbestos exposure. They generally do not cause significant changes in lung function, except diffuse pleural thickening may result in exertional dyspnea and extrapulmonary restrictive lung disease. Pleural thickening may cause rounded atelectasis (Chapter 90) when encasement of a portion of the peripheral lung tissue by thickened pleura causes an apparent lung nodule, typically with a \u201ccomet sign\u201d showing the thickened pleura. Benign pleural effusion can develop, typically about 10 to 15 years after asbestos exposure. It requires further investigation because the differential diagnosis includes malignant pleural effusion (Chapter 99).",

Physical examination usually reveals digital clubbing and basal crackles on lung auscultation. Chest imaging shows basal interstitial lung disease, with or without additional pleural changes as described earlier. Pulmonary function testing shows restrictive lung disease (Chapter 85), and histologic findings are the same as in usual interstitial pneumonia (Chapter 92). Findings supporting the diagnosis of asbestosis rather than usual interstitial pneumonia include a significant duration and level of exposure to asbestos, an appropriate latency of usually 20 to 40 years after first exposure, and the finding of ferruginous asbestos bodies in sputum or lung tissue (Fig. 93-3\n). Unfortunately, pharmacologic treatment is not effective, and the lung disease may progress to end-stage fibrosis. Management is supportive, including supplemental oxygen and consideration for lung transplantation (Chapter 101). As with the other diseases of long latency, preventing exposure is paramount.",

Radiographs show pleural thickening, and a pleural effusion may be present. Mesothelioma often is difficult to distinguish from benign pleural thickening without a biopsy. No treatment has proved effective (Chapter 197), so routine screening to detect mesothelioma in exposed persons is not currently recommended. The risk of lung cancer (Chapter 197) increases after significant exposure to asbestos, with a usual latency period of 20 to 30 years.
