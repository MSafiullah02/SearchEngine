Parasites The host response to these parasites includes eosinophilia, acute containing larvae located in several sites such as the brain (neurocysticercosis causes seizures), eye, as well as muscles and subcutaneous tissue (causes painful nodules). These cysts may cause eosinophilia, an inflammatory reaction and eventually they may calcify. Echinococcus. Infection from the accidental ingestion of food or drink contaminated with tapeworm eggs results in hydatid disease, also known as echinococcosis. The larval cysts that develop can be found in virtually any site, grow slowly, and persist for many years until they cause symptoms or are discovered incidentally. Disruption of a cyst containing highly antigenic fluid may result in anaphylactic shock, and for this reason it has been recommended that they should not be biopsied. However, on the basis of published data adverse reactions are rare. Use of a fine gauge needle by a skilled operator is important to prevent fluid leakage during aspiration. (Table 4 .7), but those likely to be seen in cytology specimens are Enterobius vermicularis, Strongyloides stercoralis, and the microfilariae. E. vermicularis (pinworm, also known as the threadworm in the United Kingdom) causes intestinal infestation (enterobiasis). The adult female worm migrates out onto the perianal area at night, and once exposed to oxygen she lays her eggs. This causes perianal pruritis and possibly vaginitis. Occasionally subcutaneous perineal nodules may develop. In such cases, Pap tests may contain an adult worm and/or eggs. The worm has a characteristic pointed tail (Fig. 4.23) . Their eggs are colorless, oval, thin walled, and flattened on one side, S. stercoralis. This worm causes strongyloidiasis. After penetrating the skin, infective larvae pass through the lung (Loeffler syndrome). They are then coughed or swallowed and infest the duodenum. Here new autoinfective larvae may develop (autoinfection) leading to chronic infection. In immunocompromised patients, larvae may penetrate the intestinal wall and the pattern of nuclei in their tail are the main features used to distinguish the various species. Occult filariasis has been diagnosed by many bloody FNA procedures containing microfilariae, worms, or even eggs. Filarial morphology is best appreciated with a Giemsa stain.

Chlamydiae are obligate intracellular Gram negative bacteria. They are classified taxonomically into a separate order (Chlamydia) because of their unique life cycle.
