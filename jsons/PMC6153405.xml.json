These structures included two sets of \u03b2\u2010\u03b1\u2010\u03b2\u2010\u03b1\u2010\u03b2 units (321456 topology), forming a single parallel sheet flanked of a three layer \u03b1/\u03b2/\u03b1 sandwich.4 An important structural feature of this fold includes a crossover observed between strands 3 and 4. This crossover creates a natural cavity that participates in the binding of the nucleotide ring.5 We can therefore define a minimal Rossmann\u2010like motif as a three\u2010layer \u03b1/\u03b2/\u03b1 sandwich with at least three parallel \u03b2\u2010strands and a crossover between the second and third strands. In fact, protein structures containing this minimal defined unit constitute 22% of the Protein Data Bank (see \u201cMaterials and methods\u201d). Rossmann domains are linked to a great variety of different catalytic domains and metabolic enzymes and can be found in different viruses.6\n",

Previous studies showed that in marine, soil, and animal\u2010associated environments, the number of virus particles is typically 10\u2013100 times greater than the number of cells.7 This so\u2010called \u201cvirosphere\u201d is probably inclusive of every environment on the Earth, from the atmosphere to the deep biosphere.8 The viromes of the three domains of cellular life (bacteria, archea, and eukaryotes) are fundamentally different. In prokaryotes, most have double\u2010stranded DNA genomes, with a substantial minority of single\u2010stranded DNA viruses and only limited presence of RNA viruses. On the other hand, in eukaryotes, RNA viruses account for the majority of the virome diversity, although ssDNA and dsDNA viruses are common as well.9 Although several families of dsDNA viruses are represented in both bacteria and archea, no viruses are known to be shared by eukaryotes with any of the other two cellular domains, even at the family or order level.10 However, structural analyses of virion architecture and coat protein topology have revealed unexpected similarities, not visible in sequence comparisons, suggesting a common origin for viruses that infect hosts residing in different domains of life.11 Given the prevalence of Rossmann\u2010like folds in nature, their analysis in the viral structure proteome could provide an understanding of viral biology and evolution as well as could propose possible targets for antiviral therapy.",

The rising tide of antibiotic resistance coupled with the low rate of antibiotic discovery has revived interest in phages as antibacterial agents.14 Phages have been used not only to treat and prevent human bacterial infections but also to control plant diseases, detect pathogens, and assess food safety. E.coli bacteriophages are the most popular objects for these purposes,14 which perhaps explains their relative abundance of structures (Fig. 1). Our analysis detected 14 different bacterial virus structure topology types defined by ECOD T\u2010groups that contain a Rossmann\u2010like fold (Fig. 2, 12 topology groups shown). The largest \u201cRossmann\u2010related\u201d homology group (2003.1) adopts a classical Rossmann\u2010like topology with additional \u03b2\u2010strands at the C\u2010terminal end for several families [Fig. 2(A,B)]. The tubulin family [Fig. 2(B)] of this homology group has a sheet topology 321456 representing a canonical GTP\u2010binding domain. Pseudomonas phiKZ\u2010like bacteriophages encode a group of related tubulin/FtsZ\u2010like proteins believed to be essential for the correct centering of replicated bacteriophage virions within the bacterial host.15 This phage protein classifies together with bacterial and archeal FtsZ proteins as well as eukaryotic tubulin alpha, beta, and gamma chains.

Given the idea that PMVK enzymes arose from nonorthologous gene displacement early in animal evolution,16 perhaps the phage system T4 deoxynucleotide kinases played a role in their alternate evolutionary origins. Another family member of this H\u2010group, the ATPase P4 from bacteriophage phi12 [NTPase_P4, Fig. 2(D)] contains motor proteins involved in the packaging of Pseudomonas phage phi\u201012 genome into preformed capsids using ATP to drive translocation.17 The central P4 structure core, together with part of the C\u2010terminal region, forms a Rossmann\u2010type domain containing a twisted, eight\u2010stranded \u03b2\u2010sheet of mixed parallel and antiparallel topology flanked by five helices.

The role of glycosylation in protecting the infecting viral DNA from host restriction enzymes has been reviewed.25 Comparison of the glucosyltransferase family fold to other families showed that it is completely embedded in the structure of glycogen phosphorylase. All nine \u03b1\u2010helices and 13 \u03b2\u2010strands of \u03b2\u2010glucosyltransferase match elements of glycogen phosphorylase in sequential order.26 The significance of the match is further supported by the fact that the first and second domains of the common core are architecturally distinct despite topographical similarity to the classical nucleotide\u2010binding fold. It appears paradoxical that the architecture of T4 \u03b2\u2010glucosyltransferase is simpler and therefore appears more primitive than that of glycogen phosphorylase, which is the older enzyme by phylogenetic arguments.26 The paradox may be resolved by either of two evolutionary models that differ in the point of divergence between glycogen phosphorylase and T4 \u03b2\u2010glucosyltransferase. The first model postulates that the gene for T4 \u03b2\u2010glucosyltransferase diverged rather recently from a fully evolved glycogen phosphorylase and evolution in T4 rapidly simplified the structure of the protein down to the essential catalytic core. In the second model, both descend along separate lineages from a very ancient common ancestor.",

In addition to these archea\u2010specific viruses, all types of dsDNA viruses known to infect bacteria can replicate in archea, including head\u2010tailed viruses (families Myoviridae, Siphoviridae, and Podoviridae), icosahedral viruses with internal lipid envelopes (families Sphaerolipoviridae and Turriviridae in archea; Tectiviridae and Corticoviridae in bacteria), and pleomorphic viruses (families Pleolipoviridae in archea and Plasmaviridae in bacteria).34 One example of an archeal\u2010infecting viral protein is the B116 protein (DUF1874 family) of Sulfolobus turreted icosahedral virus (STIV).35 While the 37 STIV open reading frames (ORFs) generally lack sequence similarity to other genes ORF B116 is common to the genomes of three additional hyperthermophilic Archeal viral families, the Rudiviridae, the Lipothrixviridae and the Bicaudaviridae.

Interestingly, an intramolecular disulfide bond, contributed by Cys33 and Cys62, is also observed. This covalent link between the \u03b11 and \u03b12 helices is likely to enhance the thermostability of the B116 fold. Two copies of the B116 polypeptide are found in the asymmetric unit, giving rise to the homodimer and forming a larger 10\u2010stranded unclosed barrel, giving rise to a saddle shaped protein.

The glucose\u2010methanol\u2010choline oxidoreductase family, represented by the R135 protein, contains an N\u2010terminal FAD binding Rossmann\u2010related domain followed by a C\u2010terminal substrate recognition domain.

TyrRS shares 30% identity over 340 residues with the TyrRS of the hyperthermophilic Euryarchaeota Pyrococcus horikoshii, its closest known structural homologue. tRNA synthetases are pivotal in determining how the genetic code is translated in amino acids and in providing the substrate for protein synthesis. The discovery of four aminoacyl\u2010tRNA synthetases encoded in the genome of mimivirus together with a full set of translation initiation, elongation, and termination factors appeared to blur what was once a clear frontier between the cellular and viral world.42\n",

            "text": "Given the relatively high number of viral protein families that contain a Rossmann\u2010like fold (81 families), we sought to examine their evolutionary distributions among folds from the three major host kingdoms. Figure 4 highlights the protein family counts from bacteria (blue bar), archea (red bar), and eukaryota (green bar)\u2014infecting viruses that fall within all distinct minimum Rossmann fold types. Importantly, each fold type includes protein families related by a common ancestor (ECOD H\u2010group). The fold types represented by more than one host kingdom tend to display relatively high family counts. These well\u2010populated folds include P\u2010loop domains\u2010related (2004.1), Rossmann\u2010related (2003.1), and UDP\u2010glycosyltransferase/glycogen phosphorylase (2111.1). Most of the other fold types include only one family representative, with 8 from eukaryotic hosts, 6 from bacterial hosts, and one from archeal hosts. The fold type nucleotide\u2010diphospho\u2010sugar transferases (2111.6) contains two families from eukaryote and one from archea, while the fold type SGNH hydrolase (2007.5) contains one family from bacteria and one from archea. This almost biphasic distribution, with one well\u2010populated universal fold set and one less populated unique fold set, suggests that despite the fundamental differences in the viriomes from the three domains of cellular life, they survive using a common set of folds. Furthermore, these well\u2010populated folds extend across all life forms, perhaps suggesting an ancient origin. Accordingly, the P\u2010loop domains\u2010like fold, whose nucleotide metabolic enzyme components are thought to form the origin of the protein world,52 also represent the most populated fold among viral genomes. Such examples of ancient viral proteins should be useful for understanding evolutionary relationships among members of this unique domain of life. Alternately, the unique fold types likely drive some of the differences observed in virus infecting different cellular forms of life. For example, the cystovirus bacteriophage phi12 encodes a unique P7 protein with a minimal Rossmann fold. Phi12 P7 is classified as its own unique X\u2010group in ECOD, implying a lack of evidence for homology to existing folds. P7 serves as a putative virion assembly cofactor thought to bind the unique three\u2010segmented double\u2010stranded cystovirus RNA genome.53 The avian coronavirus that infects chickens encodes another example (IBV Nsp2a) of a unique Rossmann\u2010like fold domain. The N\u2010terminal domain of Nsp2a adopts a Rossmann\u2010like sheet topology (2314), with \u03b2\u2010strand 2 being an insert to the core that is antiparallel to the rest. Although the function of Nsp2a is unknown, its lack of sequence/structure similarity to other proteins has suggested a role in host specificity.54\n",

Viral methyltransferase domains tend to function in mRNA 5' cap biosynthesis. One viral methyltransferase example that has not rapidly diverged from its FtsJ counterparts in other kingdoms (i.e., \u201cABVE\u201d) illustrates a typical methyltransferase fold bound to AdoMet substrate and cap [Fig. 6(A)]. Alternately, a fast evolving structure of the vaccinia virus protein VP39 highlights the typical methyltransferase binding sites for AdoMet substrate [Fig. 6(B), black stick] with diversity arising from extensions at the termini, a replacement of the C\u2010terminal helix with a strand, and a unique cap binding pocket [Fig. 6(B), magenta stick] that allows for sensing substrate methylation status.62 Evolution of viral methyltransferases has been discussed, with the unique sequence features arising from their invention of alternate capping pathways, their intimate interactions with additional viral enzymes functioning in the process, and their inactivation as methyltransferases.63 Such inactive domains have transformed into RNA\u2010binding modules64 displaying significant deterioration surrounding the AdoMet binding site [Fig. 6(C)] or allosteric modulators of RNA processing65 that function together with a duplicated methyltransferase domain [Fig. 6(D,E), respectively].

The IBV Nsp2a N\u2010terminus contains a minimal Rossmann\u2010like motif with an \u03b1/\u03b2 insertion following the first helix that forms an antiparallel interaction with the crossover strand 2 [Fig. 7(A)]. While NSP2 is one of the first proteins to be translated and processed in the IBV life cycle, its function remains unknown. Zika virus NS1 also adopts a minimal Rossmann\u2010like fold. However, NS1 replaces the C\u2010terminal helix addition with an N\u2010terminal helix addition. It also has an insertion in the same position as Nsp2a, but the \u03b2\u2010strand forms a parallel interaction with strand 2 [Fig. 7(B)]. The function of Zika virus NS1 remains unclear. The unique properties of these apparent viral\u2010specific proteins, which could have arisen from degradation of more complete Rossmann domains, preclude functional inference from their structure.",

Resolvases or recombinases are proteins that cause conserved DNA rearrangements, interact with short sequences in the DNA, bring two sites together in a synapse and then catalyze strand exchange so that the DNA is cleaved and religated to opposite partners.70 There are several known types of recombinases but only serine recombinases or resolvase/invertase family proteins contain a Rossmann fold motif. This family has emerged from studies of phages, prophages, and transposons from predominantly Gram\u2010positive bacteria and consists of three groups. The structural and evolutionary differences imply that an ancestral catalytic domain has fused to unrelated sequences to result in a family of structurally and functionally diverse proteins. Thus, the modular nature of the serine recombinases resembles that in other recombination enzymes, such as the tyrosine integrases and the DDE superfamily of transposases.71 Interestingly, serine recombinases have significant sequence similarity to the poxvirus F16 protein whose function is still unclear, but it is proposed that this protein may affect signaling functions of the nucleoli and it is unlikely to have serine recombinase activity.72 Thus, the most parsimonious evolutionary scenario of these orthologs involves acquisition of a serine recombinase gene by the ancestor of poxviruses from a transposon or a bacteriophage.72\n",
