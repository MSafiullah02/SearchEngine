Following reports of MERS-CoV infections from the Arabian Peninsula, cases were likewise reported from travelers visiting other continents [2]. Dromedary camels, in which the virus does not cause disease, are believed to be the major host reservoir [3,4]. The virus can spread from dromedary camels to humans through direct or indirect contact, causing significant morbidity and mortality [4]. The clinical spectrum ranges from asymptomatic illness to septic shock, multi-organ failure and death in severe cases [5]. Evidence suggests that the average incubation period in an infected human host is 5.5\u20136.5 days with a maximum of 10\u201314 days [6].",

Larger outbreaks have been reported in healthcare settings, which have led to multiple chains of limited transmission, as a result of contact with index cases or inadequate infection prevention and control measures causing excessive morbidity and mortality in several countries [2,[5], [6], [7], [8], [9], [10], [11]].

The information collected included baseline demographic characteristics (time, place, gender, age, residency and nationality), risk factors including history of previous exposure to camels, co-morbidities, laboratory investigations, clinical management and outcomes including mortality rates. A comprehensive investigation of close contacts, including health care personnel who may have been exposed to patients infected with MERS-CoV was conducted. Close contacts were defined as any person who provided care for the patient, including a healthcare worker or family member, or had another similarly close physical contact, for example, someone with whom the patient had resided or visited [26]. Close contacts of confirmed or probable cases were identified and monitored for the appearance of respiratory symptoms for 14 days after their last exposure to the confirmed or suspected case, while the index case remained symptomatic. Any contact that became ill during that period of time was tested for MERS-CoV using real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) [27] to detect viral RNA from patient blood samples. RT-PCR was also used to test the camels, starting with RNA extracted from nasal and conjunctive swabs. The ethical approval was obtained based on Ministry of Health regulation.",

Firstly, the cases reported from the North Al Batinah cluster were household contacts, indicating that for the first time in the country human-to-human transmission occurred at the household level. Similar family clusters were reported in Saudi Arabia [14,15,17,[34], [35], [36], [37], [38], [39]], Tunisia [40] and the UK [39]. Secondly, the epidemiological characteristics of these 13 cases are different from what has been observed in cases reported from other countries [5,10,11,39,40]. The age is skewed towards younger age groups while the reported global median age of MERS-CoV cases acquired through community transmission is 55 and above [5,10,11,39,40]. Thirdly, most of the cases are females (69%) and not males, as reported elsewhere [2,32]. The reason for the strong female predominance of the outbreak remains unexplained.",

Therefore, it is ideal to wait 21 days from the day the index case was reported to be sure that anti-MERS-CoV IgG is not missed in the serum of the contact cases as many mild or asymptomatic cases of MERS-CoV do not seroconvert.",

We should focus on the primary source of MERS-CoV infections, which remains unclear, as does the transmission pattern from dromedary camels to humans. Special attention should be particularly paid to the types of behaviour or exposure that result in human infections, even asymptomatic infections that elicit immune responses.",
