The most common respiratory viruses are Influenza A virus (FLUAV), Influenza B virus (FLUBV), Human parainfluenzavirus 1\u20134 (PIV\u20101\u20104), Human respiratory syncitial virus (RSV), Human metapneumovirus (hMPV), Enteroviruses (EV), Rhinoviruses (RV), Human coronaviruses (HCoV), Human bocaviruses (HBoV), and Human adenoviruses (AdV).

Numerous tests have been developed using multiplex PCR to detect several viruses, including those that are not detected either by VC or by immunoassays. Although PCR\u2010based techniques were initially limited by the few types of viruses that could be detected in a single test [Liolios et al., 2001; Coiras et al., 2004; Bellau\u2010Pujol et al., 2005; Freymuth et al., 2006], numerous multiplex PCR tests have been developed, allowing more than 10 viruses to be detected in a single assay. Amplicon detection can be performed by hybridization using microarrays [Henrickson et al., 2007; Raymond et al., 2009; Cannon et al., 2010; Renois et al., 2010; Frobert et al., 2011; Culebras et al., 2013; Pillet et al., 2013] or semiconductor\u2010based DNA microspheres [Mahony et al., 2007]. Several respiratory virus panels (RVP) have been commercialized, such as xTAG\u00ae RVP from Luminex\u00ae [Mahony et al., 2007; Pabbaraju et al., 2008; Gadsby et al., 2010; Balada\u2010Llasat et al., 2011; Kim et al., 2013; Pillet et al., 2013], Multicode PLx RVP from Eragen [Balada\u2010Llasat et al., 2011], and Resplex\u00ae II from Qiagen [Li et al., 2007; Balada\u2010Llasat et al., 2011; Pillet et al., 2013]. Other NAATs are the multiplex ligation\u2010dependent probe amplification system (MLPA) [Reijans et al., 2008; Bruijnesteijn van Coppenraet et al., 2010; Pillet et al., 2013] and the dual priming oligonucleotide (DPO) system [Roh et al., 2008; Bruijnesteijn van Coppenraet et al., 2010; Zhang et al., 2012; Cho et al., 2013; Kim et al., 2013; Pillet et al., 2013]. PCR\u2010based systems generate a diagnostic result within only one working day, but implementation in a laboratory routine may not be cost\u2010effective.",

Covering a broad range of etiological agents, these quick techniques may be especially useful in immunosupressed or critically ill patients although their clinical impact is not yet well established [Garbino et al., 2009; Schnell et al., 2012]. However, as NAATs detect viral nucleic acids regardless of the presence of viral antigens or infective viruses [Pagarolas and Sune, 2014], a positive result can reflect either a present infection or a past infection [Elnifro et al., 2000; Mahony, 2008; Ginocchio and McAdam, 2011; Jansen et al., 2011]. Although the viral load may be useful to predict the correlation of a virus and an infectious process it is not well\u2010established for respiratory viral infections [Kuypers et al., 2006; Debiaggi et al., 2012].",

Some viruses, such as RSV, are usually associated with clinical illness and should be considered as the etiological agent in a patient with respiratory symptoms. In contrast, viruses such as RV, HCoV, and HBoV seem to be frequently found in asymptomatic children [Debiaggi et al., 2012; Meriluoto et al., 2012] although more studies on this issue are required.",

NAATs are faster than culture, which requires two days minimum; both NAATs tested had a turn around time of six and nine hours. However, most NAATs are not faster than IF or immunochromatography. Rapid antigen detection tests of certain respiratory viruses provide a result with very high specificity within 15\u201330 min [Mandell et al., 2007]. In the epidemic situation, the use of these techniques as the first step to detect viruses such as influenza virus or RSV may accelerate results and bring simplicity to the laboratory. Only the negative results would require further analysis [Buller, 2013]. Another important point is that NAATs and antigen detection techniques only detect the specific viruses under investigation; other viruses that may be related to the clinical process will not be detected.",

NAATs are particularly useful in detecting new viruses and in giving a quick result. However, the interpretation of a molecular test is not always straightforward. The clinical virologist must consider the pros and cons of the technique used and the clinical impact of the result.",
