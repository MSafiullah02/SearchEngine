COVID-19 group had a higher rate of contact with epidemic area within 14 days and clustering onset than other groups. Fever was the most common symptom in these patients. The ratio of fever and the highest temperature were higher in Flu A virus infection patients than in COVID-19 patients. COVID-19 patients had lower white blood cell count and neutrophil count than Flu A virus and RSV infection group, but higher lymphocyte count than Flu A and B virus infection groups. COVID-19 group (83.33%) had higher rate of pneumonia in chest CT scan than Flu A and B virus infection groups. Conclusions Page 3 of 18 J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f 3 Influenza viruses accounted for a large proportion of respiratory virus infection even during the epidemic of COVID-19 in Beijing. No single symptom or laboratory finding was suggestive of specific respiratory virus, however, epidemic history was important for screening of COVID-19.",

In this study, the ratio of fever and the highest temperature were higher in Flu A virus infection patients than in COVID-19 patients. Given to the absence of fever and low grade fever in COVID-19 patients and its high risk [10, 11] , it was feasible to ask fever free patients with respiratory symptoms to screen as it was previously recommended [11] . Even though the rate of pharyngalgia, headache, myalgia and fatigue were relatively higher in influenza infection groups, it could not be said that presence of these symptoms was Page 10 of 18 J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f 10 meaningful for excluding COVID-19 because they were not specific symptoms in different respiratory virus infection.

The ratio of male and female was 1:1.31. 72 (52.94%) of them were diagnosed as Flu A virus infection. 32 (23.53%) of the patients were diagnosed as Flu B virus infection. 18 (13.24%) and 14 (10.29%) of the patients were diagnosed as COVID-19 and RSV infection respectively.

Also, Flu A (P=0.019 and 0.027 respectively) and Flu B (P=0.001 and 0.005 respectively) virus infection groups had lower WBC and neutrophil count than RSV infection group. Lymphocyte count was lower in Flu A and B virus infection groups than in COVID-19 group (P=0.001 and 0.005 respectively) and RSV infection group (P=0.015 and 0.038 respectively).

Totally, 77 (56.62%) patients underwent chest CT scan, and 41 (53.25%) of them were diagnosed with viral pneumonia by chest CT scan. The distribution of patients underwent chest CT scan and the image features were shown in Table 2. COVID-19 group (83.33%) had a higher rate of pneumonia in chest CT scan than Flu A (48.39%, P=0.018) and Flu B (14.29%, P<0.001) virus infection group, but had no difference with RSV infection group (64.29%, P=0.252). Patients with Flu B infection were more likely to have normal chest CT scan compared with other virus infection (P<0.05). Most of pneumonia patients had multiple ground-glass opacity in chest CT scan, and there were no differences among the 4 groups (P>0.05). Discussion In this study, even though under the spreading of 2019-nCoV, more than half of the patients with positive etiology were Flu A virus infection in Beijing. Less common was Flu B virus infection. It was similar to that of previously reported [8]. Only 11.94% and 10.45% of the patients were COVID-19 and RSV infection respectively. COVID-19 should be taken seriously, but other respiratory virus infection especially influenza virus infection should not been ignored. To distinguish COVID-19 from other respiratory virus infection, epidemic history was one of the most important identifications because COVID-19 group had a higher rate of contact with epidemic area within 14 days and clustering onset than other groups.",

Second, most of the patients, especially the COVID-19 patients, were mild cases at visit. They were not presentative to all respiratory virus infection of different severity. Third, no follow up data was available in this study. It was impossible to analyze the whole clinical course of different virus infection. Conclusions Influenza viruses accounted for a large proportion of respiratory virus infection even during the epidemic of 2019-nCoV in Beijing. No single symptom or laboratory finding was suggestive of a specific respiratory virus, however, epidemic history was important to the screening of COVID-19. Combination of epidemic history, symptoms, laboratory findings and chest CT scan and finally pathogenic examination was essential for the diagnosis of respiratory virus infection.
