The problem with classifying calf diarrhoea as a disease is the subsequent inclination of the vet or farmer towards a pathogen-oriented clinical approach. By considering diarrhoea as an indicator of altered gastrointestinal function, the clinician is more likely to adopt a systematic approach to diagnostics, therapeutics and prophylaxis, and is more apt to recognize the contribution of non-infectious factors to the clinical problem. This is not to say that enteric pathogens are irrelevant in neonatal gastrointestinal disease. In the US, neonatal enteric disease has been associated with approximately 50% of the mortality observed in preweaned dairy heifer calves (Barrington et al., 2002) , and enteric pathogens have been implicated in the death of 25% of the annual calf crop (Barrington et al., 2002) . It is clear from epidemiological studies that the risk of neonatal enteric disease is not restricted to any one particular husbandry system or to a specific environment. This means that a 'one size fits all' approach to farms with neonatal enteric disease is unlikely to be successful. The aim of this paper is to furnish the shrewd clinician with an appreciation of the enteric disease causality web along with an awareness of gastrointestinal pathophysiology. In combination, these broad concepts can be used to structure a systematic approach to the investigation and management of any bovine neonatal enteric disease outbreak.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 816, "end": 841, "text": "(Barrington et al., 2002)", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}, {"start": 931, "end": 956, "text": "(Barrington et al., 2002)", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "INTRODUCTION"}, {"text": "Neonatal gastroenteric disease is associated with a complex interaction of multiple factors.

This step involves constructing a graphic representation of the clinical disease across the farm enterprise and, as discussed in a previous paper (Potter & Aldridge, 2010) , is best achieved using a composite scoring system.

One of the most common novice errors in preventative medicine is the temptation to coerce farmers into a husbandry system based on our general knowledge of disease epidemiology.

Examples of indicators that could help identify and differentiate between impaired mucosal health and immunity and disruption of biosecurity and biocontainment are shown in Table 2 . Since most recognized pathogens are endemic on the great majority of farms (e.g. coronavirus in adult cow faeces), biocontainment is the more appropriate risk term. In some instances it may not be possible to differentiate MHI or biosecurity disturbances from one another, and on occasion one may mimic the other.

Factors affecting the calf consist mainly of hazards that impact MHI, such as maternal nutrition during pregnancy, the acquisition of maternal immunity through colostrums and nutritional management. Failure of passive transfer (FPT) is usually associated with low immunoglobulin concentration in dairy calves and late ingestion in beef calves (Barrington et al., 2002) . Nutritional practices such as the quality and composition and quality of milk replacer and feeding practices that effect ruminal development are also important in mucosal health. Risk factors impinging on contribution of the pathogen include virulence factors, pathogen load and the presence of other microbes. Pathogen load can be affected both qualitatively and quantitatively by the source of origin (e.g. markets) and by on farm practices such as injudicious antimicrobial administration.

Similarly, if colostral immunity is an important predisposing factor then the calves with clinical signs should have low serum immunoglobulin levels. It is important not to overlook the importance of this step of the investigation. If you cannot substantiate causality, your intervention measures will be speculative and therefore at risk of failing.

There is also an increasing interest in patient-side, point of care diagnostics to optimize the speed and cost effectiveness of pathogen identification. In view of the importance of microbes in bovine neonatal gastroenteric disease, knowledge of the pathogens involved in the disease outbreak is an essential aspect of the investigation. However, there are several principles that should inform our selection of diagnostic tests: G most neonatal enteric pathogens are ubiquitous on UK dairy and beef farms G the 'iceberg principle' in which the ratio between clinically infected and sub-clinically infected calves is commonly between 1:5 to 1:20 G a number of enteric pathogens are present in normal adult cow faeces G most enteric agents survive well in the environmental conditions present on UK farms.
