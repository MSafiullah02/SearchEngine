Existing approaches for this task substantially rely on complex clustering-like architectures, and they usually assume the number of clusters is known beforehand or predict the number by applying another model, which involve increasingly complex and time-consuming architectures. In this paper, we combine simple neural networks with two sets of heuristic rules to explore strong baselines for the author name disambiguation problem without any priori knowledge or estimation about cluster size, which frees the model from unnecessary complexity. On a popular benchmark dataset AMiner, our solution significantly outperforms several state-of-the-art methods both in performance and efficiency, and it still achieves comparable performance with many complex models when only using a group of rules. Experimental results also indicate that gains from sophisticated deep learning techniques are quite modest in the author name disambiguation problem.",

With the fast growth of scientific literature, the disambiguation problem has become an imminent issue since numerous downstream applications are affected by its preferences, such as information retrieval and bibliographic data analysis [5, 13] . But unfortunately, AND is not an elementary problem because distinct authors may share the same name, which is quite common for Asians, especially Chinese researchers [9] , since different Chinese names will be the same when mapped to English (e.g., and share the same English name Wei Wang). The problem of disambiguating who is who dates back at least few decades, and it is typically viewed as a clustering problem and solved by various clustering models, such models have to answer two questions inevitably, that is how to quantify the similarity and how to determine cluster size [8] . Many existing literatures mainly focus on answering the first question, such as feature-based methods [12, 13] and graph-based methods [3, 16, 20] . Actually, quite a few of them involve increasingly complex and time-consuming architectures that yield progressively smaller gains over the previous state-of-the-art. When it comes to the second question, most previous approaches assume the number of clusters is known beforehand or predict the number by applying another model [25] . However, there is no doubt that the former is unrealistic in real situations and the latter may lead to error propagation.",

Furthermore, the hierarchical agglomerative clustering (HAC) algorithm is adopted as the guiding ideology to cluster publications. On the benchmark dataset AMiner [25] , we find that our proposed solution achieves significantly better performance than several stateof-the-art methods. Experiments on another public dataset show that such rules conform to the natural law and are applicable to the whole author name disambiguation task rather than just the AMiner dataset. Experimental results also suggest that while complex models do indeed contribute to meaningful advances towards this problem, some of them exhibit unnecessary complexity and rules play a role that cannot be ignored in this task.",

For ease of exposition, we take author name as an example here (i.e., x = n) to describe the process of cluster-to-cluster stage. To calculate the numerator of overlap ratio O n (C i , C j ), we consider names that appear in the intersection of two name sets S n (C i ), S n (C j ), and calculate the total occurrence number of such names in these two clusters. In addition, the minimum of total occurrence number of all author names in S n (C i ) and S n (C j ) is defined as the denominator.

Table 1 shows the performances of different methods on the AMiner dataset. Following previous settings [25] , we utilize pairwise Precision, Recall, and F1score to evaluate all methods. Meanwhile, a macro averaged score of each metric is calculated according to all test names. Louppe et al. [13] use some manual features to learn a pairwise similarity function and achieve competitive performance. Similarly, we hold the view that in the era of deep learning, the feature engineering methods may not be certainly worse than some exquisite neural networks, especially in this task. Moreover, some features can be further abstracted into rules and be used universally in the whole author name disambiguation problem, rather than limited to this dataset, we will discuss this phenomenon in Sect. 5.2. However, the results of Basic Rules are disappointing and contrary to ours. Since there is no implementation details, we speculate that it might be because the merging rules are too loose. By incorporating both rules and neural networks to model co-authorships, affiliations and titles explicitly, our PNP model outperforms all baselines in terms of F1score (+3.54% over Zhang et al. [25] , +11.75% over Zhang and Al Hasan [24] , +11.23% over Louppe et al. [13] and +39.74% over Fan et al. [3] relatively). In the bottom half part of Table 1 , some incremental results of our method are presented. Specifically, PMS outperforms most baselines, which indicates the effectiveness of heuristic rules. PMS+SNN with optimal reject threshold (0.8) yields better performance than PMS (+1.78% in terms of F1-score), which suggests the advantage of SNN. PNP outperforms PMS+SNN by +4.12% in terms of F1-score and +4.09% in terms of precision which verifies the incorporation of PBS can greatly enhance the performance. Overall, we attribute these successes to the comprehensive consideration of rules and semantics based on the inherent characteristics of the author name disambiguation problem.",

It is worthy to mention that the results of OPEDAC 2018 in Fig. 3 should not be compared with other competitors in the leaderboard. The reason is that OPEDAC 2018 suffers from the problem of noise in the author list. Actually, when combined with other denoising strategy, our PNP method finally ranks top 3% without any ensemble tricks in the competition.",

Experimental results show that the precision is just about 95%. When facing the remaining 5%, even humans have no certain confidence to deal with them correctly. In this case, after removing these indistinguishable samples, our pre-merging strategy attains 86% precision, which is quite acceptable for the unsupervised heuristic rules.",

On the whole, state-of-the-art solutions for the task can be divided into two categories: feature-based and graph-based. Feature-based methods leverage pairwise distance function to measure documents. Huang et al. [7] first uses blocking technique to group candidate documents with similar names together and employs DBSCAN to cluster documents. Louppe el al. [13] uses a classifier to learn pairwise similarity and performs semi-supervised hierarchical clustering to generate results. Graph-based methods utilize graph topology and aggregate information from neighbors. Fan et al. [3] builds document graph for each name by co-authorship, and uses carefully-designed similarity function and affinity propagation algorithm to generate clustering results. Tang el al. [20] employs Hidden Markov Random Fields to model node and edge features in a unified probabilistic framework. Zhang and Al Hasan [24] learns graph embedding from three constructed graphs based on document similarity and co-authorship. Moreover, Zhang et al. [25] combines the advantages of above two methods by learning a global embedding using supervised metric learning and refining the embedding using local linkage structures. In this push towards complexity, we do not believe that all researchers have adequately explored baseline methods, and thus it is unclear how much various fussy techniques actually help.",

Experimental results verify the advantage of our method over state-of-the-art methods, and demonstrate the proposed model is highly efficient and rules can be extended to other datasets, in which many conclusions are consistent with some sociological phenomena. Beyond that, we further explore the upper bound of disambiguation precision and analyze the possible reasons, which will be leaved as our future work. To conclude, we offer all data mining researchers a point of reflection like some previous work [15] : The most important thing is to consider baselines that do not involve complex architectures, simple methods might lead to unexpected performances.",
