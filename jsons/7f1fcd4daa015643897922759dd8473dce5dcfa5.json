The impact of infection with respiratory viruses and the subsequent development of severe lower respiratory tract disease has been increasingly appreciated as respiratory viruses become more readily detectable. Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and human metapneumovirus (hMPV) are among the best-documented respiratory viruses causing a wide range of respiratory disease in transplant recipients, ranging from asymptomatic shedding to fatal respiratory failure. Understanding the epidemiology and clinical characteristics of RSV and hMPV permits clinicians to intervene pretransplant, provide appropriate infection control and prevention measures, potentially treat patients, and manage immunosuppressive therapy.",

In the later twentieth century, episodes of acute upper respiratory infection (URI) and LRTI without an identifi ed etiology were often considered to be \"idiopathic\" pneumonia or attributed to regimen-related toxicity or acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). In the classic 1982 study of 215 non-bacterial, non-fungal pneumonias in 525 allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) recipients, 44% of the episodes of pneumonia remained undiagnosed. The overall mortality rate associated with idiopathic pneumonia in these HSCT recipients was 60%, a strikingly high fi gure [ 1 ] . The potential morbidity of RSV infections was fi rst recognized in immunocompromised children in the 1970s, more than a decade earlier than in immunocompromised adults [ 2 -6 ] . The recognition of respiratory viruses as an important clinical problem likely refl ects the increasing number of severely immunodefi cient patients, more aggressive attempts to identify the cause of respiratory illness in high-risk patients, and the increasing ability of clinical virology and pathology laboratories to identify respiratory viruses in clinical specimens.",

            "text": "RSV was fi rst identifi ed in 1956 and became appreciated as a major cause of epidemic bronchiolitis and pneumonia in young children in the 1960s [ 18 , 19 ] . HMPV was fi rst identifi ed in 2001 by molecular techniques in symptomatic children by van den Hoogen et al. as a paramyxovirus causing bronchiolitis and URI in children [ 20 ] . Both viruses are classifi ed within the Pneumovirinae subfamily of the Paramyxoviridae family of non-segmented, negative-strand, enveloped RNA viruses [ 21 ] . HMPV belongs to the Metapneumovirus genus whereas RSV is a member of the Pneumovirus genus. Both viruses are highly pleomorphic and their sizes vary from 150 to 600 nm. The RSV and hMPV genomes are approximately 13-15 kb in length and closely resemble each other, excluding a few differences in the order of the genes and the absence of the non-structural genes (NS1 and NS2) from hMPV genome. The remaining eight genes code for nine proteins present in both viruses: the nucleoprotein (N protein), the phosphoprotein (P protein), the matrix protein (M protein), the fusion glycoprotein (F protein), the putative transcription factor (M2-1 protein), the RNA synthesis regulatory factor (the M2-2 protein), the small hydrophobic glycoprotein (SH protein), the attachment glycoprotein (G protein) and the viral polymerase (L protein). The RNA core of the virion is associated with P, N, L, M2-1, M2-2 proteins, surrounded by M protein and covered by a lipid envelope. F is the most highly conserved of the envelope glycoproteins within each virus and between RSV and hMPV. The fusion glycoprotein is essential in promoting attachment and fusion of the virus with the cell membrane during viral entry. The fusion protein is the target of many vaccines under development as well as that of monoclonal antibodies such as palivizumab, which is used to prevent RSV disease in preterm infants. By contrast, the G gene is the most variable. Whole genome analysis of both RSV and hMPV has shown the existence of two genotypes, A and B. In hMPV, those two major genetic groups are further divided into subgroups A1, A2, B1, B2 based upon the sequence variability of the G and F genes. Subgroup A2 is again divided into A2a and A2b.",

For example, nylon fl ocked swabs and foam swabs increase cell capture within the swab and then release into the transport media, increasing viral recovery [ 29 , 30 ] . Nasal wash or aspiration methods are superior for isolation of viruses by culture and increase the sensitivity of culture, antigenic assays and quantitative molecular assays [ 31 ] . Nasal washes are well tolerated in cooperative adults and offer the advantage of visualizing the quality of the specimen. Bronchoalveolar lavage remains the specimen of choice to diagnose lower respiratory tract infections because of the ability to simultaneously test for potential co-pathogens such as fungi, Pneumocystis jiroveci , and bacteria, as well as to document viral infection in the lower airways. Discordance in viral detection between upper and lower respiratory tract samples have been described with both viruses; negative upper tract and positive lower tract specimens in immunocompromised patients are possible but more discordance has been noted for hMPV compared with RSV.",

However, results can be reasonably fast, the method is relatively inexpensive, and importantly, this method also confi rms that an appropriate specimen has been properly obtained by looking at ciliated epithelial cells. Sensitivity of IFA when performed by an experienced laboratory is as high as 70-90% of the samples positive by PCR-at least in children [ 34 ] .

Nonetheless, early studies from large transplant centers reported serious sequelae in small numbers of patients who developed pneumonia where RSV was detected [ 5 , 9 , 13 ] . At the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center (Hutch), a prospective surveillance study conducted in 1987 documented respiratory viral infections in 15 (19%) of 78 immunocompromised patients who were followed until hospital discharge [ 13 ] ; fi ve (33%) patients developed pneumonia and two (13%) patients died (one with RSV, the other with adenovirus). A subsequent prospective surveillance study described 127 viral infections and revealed an overall frequency of viral infections of approximately 4% [ 11 ] ; 49% of RSV isolates were from BAL.

At the Huddinge University Hospital, Stockholm, a prospective surveillance study conducted among HSCT recipients between 1989 and 1996 detected 39 (7.1%) respiratory viral infections in 545 patients, including RSV in 21% [ 14 ] . At M.D. Anderson Cancer Center (MDACC), prospective surveillance conducted using culture techniques among hospitalized adult HSCT recipients during two 6-month winter periods detected 67 (31%) respiratory viral infections in 217 hospitalized patients with acute respiratory symptom. Nearly half of these were due to RSV (33 patients, 49%). The impact of these illnesses was considerable: 20 (61%) patients had RSV infection progressing to pneumonia, and 12 patients with RSV pneumonia died. During the winter period when community viruses were frequent and nosocomial transmission was high, the frequency and mortality of respiratory viral-associated pneumonias was more than four times as high as CMV-associated pneumonia. Recent prospective studies conducted in transplant centers worldwide continue to demonstrate the importance of RSV and report incidence of infections and risk factors for fatal disease (Table 31 -2 ). A 2005 study from Barcelona, Spain, described the 2-year incidence of symptomatic respiratory viral infections in over 400 patients followed for up to several years posttransplant. Altogether, 29% of allogeneic HSCT recipients and 14% of autologous HSCT recipients had respiratory viruses detected, with 19 patients (4.6%) receiving either autologous or allogeneic transplants having symptomatic RSV disease [ 55 ] . Risk factors associated with having a respiratory virus identifi ed included close household contacts with children under the age of 12 years and chronic graft versus host disease. Lymphopenia was identifi ed as a major risk for URI progression. Similar rates have been demonstrated in other centers in the USA [ 15 ] , South America [ 56 ] , and Europe [ 57 ] .",

RSV infections in HSCT recipients typically follow the same clinical sequence as RSV infections in previously healthy children: signs and symptoms of a URI such as rhinorrhea, sinus congestion, sore throat, or otitis media frequently precede signs of lower respiratory tract disease including cough, wheezing, hypoxia, and pneumonia [ 5 , 6 , 9 ] (Tables 31-3 and 31-4 ). The presence of wheezing with respiratory symptoms during the respiratory virus season may provide the clue that RSV may be present. Progression of URI to LRI has been associated with patients who are early (<1 month) posttransplant, Risk factors for the progression of RSV upper respiratory disease to lower tract disease or pneumonia and factors relating to fatal disease have been evaluated. The most common risk factor described in multiple centers using different methods of case ascertainment and viral detection remains lymphopenia. In a prospective multicenter study carried out by the European Group for Blood and Marrow Transplantation, lymphopenia but not neutropenia significantly increased the risk for lower respiratory tract disease [ 80 ] . Older age and donor status are also signifi cant risk factors in some studies, whereas CMV serostatus, acute graft versus host disease, time relative to engraftment, and preemptive aerosolized ribavirin at a low dose of 2 h daily were not signifi cant [ 81 ] . Investigators from MDACC have demonstrated that season of year, relapse of malignancy, presence of graft versus host disease, increasing age, and lack of engraftment are inpatient risk factors for the development of RSV pneumonia [ 9 , 12 , 22 , 82 ] . Recently, large retrospective studies have identifi ed graft source including cord or marrow (adjusted hazard ratio (HR), 4.1, 95% CI 1.8-9.0) and oxygen requirement (adjusted HR 3.3, 98% CI, 15-6.7) to be independently associated with death due to respiratory failure in HSCT recipients [ 83 ] . Smoking history, conditioning with high-dose total body irradiation, and an absolute lymphocyte count < 100/mm 3 at the time of URI onset are also signifi cantly associated with disease progression [ 84 ] .",

Hospitalbased oubreaks of RSV infection in HSCT recipients can occur through introduction of circulating community strains as well as transmission of identical viral strains among patients [ 42 , 44 ] .

In one study, 15 patients were diagnosed with hMPV within 7 weeks in a tertiary care cancer unit [ 92 ] .

            "text": "Current options for the antiviral therapy of RSV disease in immunocompromised hosts are limited. Large, controlled, therapeutic trials for RSV pneumonia or lower tract disease in immunocompromised patients have not been conducted. Aerosolized ribavirin, licensed in the USA for the therapy of RSV bronchiolitis and pneumonia in infants and young children in 1986, is the antiviral agent currently utilized for the treatment of RSV disease in immunocompromised patients. In general, ribavirin is given as an inhaled aerosolized solution via a face mask in a protective environment, such as a \"scavenging tent,\" to protect health care workers from potential drug contamination. Ribavirin was initially licensed for use when given for 12-18 h/day, but the use of intermittent aerosolized ribavirin given over 2 h, three times daily, was found to have similar effectiveness to 12-16 h/day continuous infusion ribavirin in healthy children [ 93 -95 ] and has been utilized in adults because of ease of administration and enhanced tolerability. A randomized trial in HSCT patients at risk for LRTI evaluated intermittent dosing of ribavirin given over 2 h three times daily versus continuous ribavirin administration using an adaptive randomized trial design in 50 HSCT patients, with the authors concluding that the intermittent schedule was preferable because of ease of administration and evidence of higher effi cacy [ 96 ] . Only one randomized, controlled, multicenter clinical trial of aerosolized ribavirin for the prevention of RSV disease progression to LRI has been conducted in HSCT recipients early posttransplant, and despite an enrollment period of several years, only 15 patients were enrolled [ 97 ] . None of the ten patients randomized to high dose, short duration aerosolized ribavirin (administered as 2 g/100 ml water given over 2 h three times daily) had disease progression compared to 2/5 control patients, a trend that was not statistically significant ( P = 0.08). Viral loads appeared to be reduced during the ribavirin treatment, but did rebound after cessation of therapy. Data demonstrating effectiveness of ribavirin is mainly retrospective. In an open trial in adult HSCT recipients with \"RSV-induced acute lung injury,\" monotherapy with aerosolized ribavirin was reported to be of benefi t if initiated prior to the development of radiographic infi ltrates [ 6 ] . In another open trial in adult HSCT recipients with radiographically proven RSV pneumonia, combination therapy with aerosolized ribavirin and high RSV-titered IVIG was reported to be of benefi t only if initiated prior to the onset of respiratory failure [ 8 , 98 ] . A retrospective MDACC study of confi rmed RSV infections in 280 allogeneic HSCT recipients from 1996 to 2009 utilized multivariable logistic regression to demonstrate that lack of ribavirin aerosol therapy at the upper respiratory tract disease stage was an important risk factor associated with RSV LRTI and all-cause mortality [ 99 ] . In a retrospective study of HSCT recipients with confi rmed lower respiratory tract RSV infection based on analysis of bronchoalveolar lavage fl uid at the Hutch, viral RNA detection in the blood was detected in 30% of 92 patients at a median of 2 days following diagnosis of lower respiratory tract disease [ 37 ] . Neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, and mechanical ventilation increased the risk of RSV RNA detection in the plasma or serum but lymphopenia and steroid use did not. The detection of RSV RNA in the serum or plasma increased the risk of overall mortality with an adjusted hazard ratio (AHR) of 2.09 ( P = 0.02).",

An effective strategy is based on understanding the potential seriousness of these infections in transplant recipients, knowledge of the viruses circulating in the community, and ongoing surveillance in high-risk patients. Continuing education of patients, family members, visitors, and staff regarding the potential seriousness of these infections must be repeatedly emphasized. Frequent and routine clinical screening of high-risk patients for acute upper and/or lower respiratory tract illness or fl u-like illness must be conducted, with sampling of respiratory secretions from symptomatic high-risk patients routinely performed both pretransplant and posttransplant. Each health care-acquired infection should be viewed as a sentinel event warranting an investigation and reaffi rmation or modifi cation of the preventative strategy. Infection control strategies should be designed to prevent spread by multiple modes of transmission [ 90 , 91 ] . Multiple respiratory viruses may circulate in the community concurrently and can be spread by different means. Infection control measures may need to be intensifi ed during community or hospital outbreaks, and the intensity and duration of infection control measures should be tailored to the risk of serious disease in different subsets of transplant recipients, and to what works in the \"real world.\" Guidelines for the prevention of opportunistic infections among HSCT recipients have been issued by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the Infectious Diseases Society of America, and European and American Societies for Blood and Marrow Transplantation.

The effectiveness of infection control interventions has also been demonstrated by the dramatic decline in the frequency of nosocomial CRV infections among HSCT recipients cared for in this transplant unit after the implementation of an aggressive, multifaceted infection control strategy [ 118 ] . Although this intensive multifaceted approach has been effective, modifi ed versions of this strategy have also been effective. For instance, the Seattle Cancer Care Alliance (SCCA ) adult inpatient transplant unit uses a similar strategy with the exception that health care workers and other visitors do not wear masks when entering the patient room [ 91 ] . However, these workers are intensively screened for signs and symptoms of respiratory illnesses prior to entering the unit, and restricted from entering the unit if they are symptomatic. Similarly, HSCT recipients with respiratory symptoms are not transferred to other units, but are cared for on the transplant unit using modifi ed droplet precautions with all persons entering the room wear gloves, gown, and mask, and the door to the room is kept closed. It may not be feasible to so intensively protect patients for the duration of increased susceptibility to respiratory viral diseases. Protective strategies are costly and cumbersome, and pose unpleasant restrictions on the freedom and quality of life of the patient and their families. This problem is further compounded by the growing trend to discharge patients early from the hospital and to perform outpatient HSCT or posttransplant care. Transplant recipients residing in the community and followed frequently in the outpatient setting are another group in which infection control practices must become priority [ 91 ] .",

Examples of protective measures for outpatients include washing hands frequently and thoroughly, avoiding close contact with individuals suffering from respiratory illnesses, and encouraging close contacts to vigorously practice respiratory hygiene. In many cases, such as individuals living with children, such efforts may be nearly impossible. Consideration of removing day care exposures for young children or decreasing exposure to transplant recipients to children (including siblings), can and should be discussed with families. The rigor and duration of prophylactic measures need to be individualized based on the immunologic status of the patient and the risk for serious disease, the needs of the patient, and quality-of-life issues.",

Similar interventions have been utilized to attempt to decrease the morbidity of serious RSV disease in HSCT recipients but direct proof of effectiveness has not yet been demonstrated [ 115 ] . For example, passive immunoprophylaxis in immunocompromised patients has been evaluated in an open trial conducted [ 122 ] using high-titered human RSVIG. In this adult study, signifi cant antibody titer increases to other respiratory viruses were extremely variable, although the subset of patients with the lowest titers appeared to receive the greatest increase in viral-specifi c antibody. The cost of this potential therapy remains quite high. The monoclonal RSV antibody palivizumab (Synagis) has been studied in an open label study in adult HSCT recipients [ 123 ] .

However, the assessment of viral shedding or infection in symptomatic transplant candidates prior to transplant is recommended. Delay of transplant based on detection of RSV or hMPV may be warranted depending on the evaluation of the risk and benefi ts of continuing on with transplantation. Consequences of postponing transplantation should be considered, including progression of underlying malignancy, logistical issues regarding the donor availability, and accessibility of services for the patient. An early study of RSV diagnosed prior to HSCT demonstrated that delaying transplant reduced the risk of pneumonia following transplant [ 23 ] . More recently, a large prospective study conducted in 458 patients at the Hutch demonstrated that nearly 25% of subjects had respiratory viruses detected pretransplant [ 24 ] . Overall, patients with a virus detected prior to transplant had fewer days alive and lower survival at day 100 (AHR 2.4; 95% CI 1.3-4.5) compared with patients who did not have viruses. In HSCT recipients who had respiratory symptoms and a virus detected prior to transplant (mainly adults), an increased overall mortality was seen compared with patients without respiratory viruses detected. Higher rates of pretransplant infection and sequelae of infection were seen in pediatric patients. Detection of respiratory viruses in asymptomatic patients was not associated with increased mortality. This data strengthens current guidelines that recommend patients with respiratory symptoms prior to transplant should be tested for respiratory viruses and transplant delayed, when feasible. However, this study was performed chiefl y in adults. The higher rates of respiratory viruses documented in children pretransplant make routine screening of pediatric patients worthy of further investigation.",

He was diagnosed with hMPV infection on day #5 posttransplant, with clinical fi ndings of mild respiratory distress with cough and abnormal chest radiograph showing interstitial infi ltrates. Aerosolized ribavirin and IVIG therapy was initiated. ( c ) Posttransplant day #9: He required intubation due to respiratory failure and acute respiratory distress syndrome, with left sided pneumonia and increasing pleural effusion. He required mechanical ventilation and 5 0% FiO 2 . ( d ) Post Tx day #11: Worsening of left lower basilar consolidation with small left pleural effusion, but oxygen requirement down to 35% FiO 2 ; not yet engrafted and continued on ribavirin. ( e ) Day #16: Now engrafted and ribavirin discontinued. He was able to be extubated and relatively quickly weaned to room air. ( f ) Patient with improvement post engraftment on day #16 posttransplant.Chest CT shows interval improvement in bilateral patchy groundglass opacities and in left lower lobe consolidation. He received supportive care and 10 days of aerosolized ribavirin therapy, which did not substantially impact viral load, but he improved clinically concomitant with engraftment. He was subsequently extubated and discharged several weeks later.",
