The colloquial meaning of complex/complexity as \u201cdifficult to understand\u201d or \u201ccomplicated\u201d must be distinguished from the scientific meaning of \u201cthe property arising from the interconnected behaviour of agents\u201d\u201cComplexity sciences\u201d defines a worldview that no longer sees the world as mechanistic, linear, and predictable. Rather it sees the world as interconnected. The interactions between elements being nonlinear make the behaviour of complex systems unpredictable (Fig. 2.1)Paul Cilliers outlined the philosophical foundations of complexity sciences, parts of which are quoted in more detail in Addendum 2The \u201ccomplexity science framework\u201d, like any other scientific framework, provides a mental mind model ABOUT the world, i.e. The truth of a theory is in your mind, not in your eyes\u2014Albert Einstein [1]Mental models (or worldviews) necessarily have to reduce the real complexity of any phenomenon being described [2, 3]. Useful models, as Box [3] stated,1 are those that describe the observed causal relationships in the real world2 [4]\u201cComplexity\u201d in its scientific understanding refers to \u201cthe nature of the problem\nnot [emphasis added] the degree of difficulty\u201d [5]. The systems theorist David Krakauer illustrates this aspect in relation to Ebola and is quoted in detail in Addendum 3\u201cComplexity\u201d exists at every scale, be it at the laboratory or the whole of society levelThe way we look at \u201cthings\u201d determines what we see and how we understand. Understanding \u201cthings\u201d at the small scale results in greater certainty BUT loss of context, whereas understanding \u201cthings\u201d at the large scale results in greater uncertainty AND loss of detail (Fig. 2.2)\n\n\n",
