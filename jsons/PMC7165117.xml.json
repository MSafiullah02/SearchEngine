It is also important to acknowledge that while hygiene measures are a vital part of infection prevention, addressing the rising threat of AMR requires a holistic approach which includes reducing the use of antibiotics in agriculture, introducing tighter regulations of over the counter sales and improving access to clean water and sanitation.13\n",

In a follow up study,31 hands, chopping board and cloth samples yielded Most Probable Number (MPN) counts of >100 and >1000 Salmonella per sample from 13.3 and 8% respectively. For Campylobacter, counts of >100 and >1000 were isolated from 5 and 1.7% respectively. This is a concern, since it is estimated that 80% of Salmonella infections originate in the home,32 and a UK study detected Campylobacter spp. in 56% of chilled retail chickens, with 7% of samples containing >1000 colony forming units (CFU)/g of skin.33 The infectious dose of Campylobacter is estimated at <500 CFU.34 Chaidez et al.35 demonstrated that the risk of Salmonella transmission from cleaning cloths via hands to mouth was far higher than the guideline levels for acceptable risk.",

However, a study conducted in Culiacan, Mexico, detected Salmonella in 173/180 (96%) kitchen cleaning cloths taken from domestic homes, with an average MPN Salmonella count of 661.35 Although further investigation is required, this suggests that Salmonella may be multiplying in the cloths to form a permanent reservoir.",

However, according to a recent literature review of 29 studies assessing behavior change interventions designed to increase hand-hygiene and environmental disinfecting in settings likely to include children, in order to widely implement such approaches and see better infection outcomes, significant hygiene behavior change is still needed for communities.101\n",

The major differences are that there are more risk factors for infection, including drug-resistant infections in the community in LMICs as a result of sub-optimal environmental sanitation, lack of environmental regulations, high-density housing, and inadequate access to clean water due to contamination during collection, transportation, storage, and use.116 These issues can lead to situations such as those found in India, where unregulated over-the-counter sales of antibiotics, poor sanitation and environmental antibiotic pollution, alongside other behavioral, cultural and social factors, have created ideal conditions for a rapid rise in MDR infections.117\n,\n118\n",
