Fat maldigestion and steatorrhea may also result from deficiencies in bile salt secretion (e.g., intra- or extrahepatic cholestasis) or abnormalities in the enterohepatic recirculation of bile salts (e.g., portosystemic vascular shunts).",

            "text": "Atrophy of the villous absorptive surface area occurs with many pathologic processes. Atrophy is caused by accelerated loss of enterocytes or decreased production of enterocytes by stem cells in the crypts. Stem cells retain the ability to reconstitute the overlying mucosa, but regeneration may take days to weeks depending upon the pathologic process. Viral infections (e.g., parvovirus, coronavirus, rotavirus) are the most important causes of damage to villus enterocytes in dogs and cats. Viral enteritides are usually acute, self-limiting infections that resolve over a matter of a few days to 1 to 2 weeks. Villous atrophy may result from immune-mediated processes such as gluten-sensitive enteropathy in the Irish Setter dog,3 or as a consequence of food sensitivity reactions in both dogs and cats.4 Food sensitivity reactions are increasingly recognized as an important cause of villous atrophy, malassimilation, and diarrhea in companion animals. Immunosuppressive drugs (e.g., glucocorticoids, vincristine, azathioprine, cyclophosphamide) may also cause severe villous atrophy. Glucocorticoids are frequently prescribed in the management of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Antiinflammatory doses of glucocorticoids appear to have minimal effect on epithelial cell turnover, but immunosuppressive doses may abolish epithelial cell renewal. These effects are usually reversible with discontinuation of therapy.",

Cellular components (T and B lymphocytes, plasma cells, macrophages) and molecular elements (prostaglandins, leukotrienes, complement, platelet-activating factor, nitric oxide, and oxygen-derived free radicals) contribute to the mucosal inflammatory response. The clinical signs of IBD (diarrhea, vomiting, anorexia) are somewhat related to the severity of the mucosal cellular infiltrates and inflammatory mediators.11, 12 (Functional abnormalities, e.g., changes in the permeability or motility of the gut, may contribute to the clinical signs in many animals.)",

In the absence of pancreatic enzyme secretion, undigested protein, lipid, or carbohydrate cannot be further absorbed. Affected animals develop diarrhea, steatorrhea, and severe protein-calorie malnutrition. These same animals develop SIBO, gastric acid\u2013induced injury to the intestinal mucosa, cobalamin malabsorption, and hypersecretion of fluid and electrolytes. It is for these reasons that pancreatic insufficient animals may have incomplete response with pancreatic enzyme replacement therapy. Bacterial infection is another example of a diarrheal disorder with multiple pathophysiologic mechanisms. The heat-stable enterotoxin of enteropathogenic Escherichia coli stimulates guanylate cyclase production of cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) and activation of cGMP-dependent protein kinases, culminating in secretory-type diarrhea. At the same time, platelet-activating factor, prostaglandins, and leukotrienes produced during bacterial infection may contribute to the malabsorption and disordered motility of E. coli infections.",

The Gram-positive commensal lactic acid bacteria (e.g., lactobacilli) have many beneficial health effects, including enhanced lymphocyte proliferation, innate and acquired immunity, and anti-inflammatory cytokine production. Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG, a bacterium used in the production of yogurt, is effective in preventing and treating diarrhea, recurrent Clostridium difficile infection, primary rotavirus infection, and atopic dermatitis in humans.18\nL. rhamnosus GG has been safely colonized in the canine gastrointestinal tract, although probiotic effects in the canine intestine have not been firmly established.19 The probiotic organism, Enterococcus faecium (SF68), has been safely colonized in the canine gastrointestinal tract, and it has been shown to increase fecal immunoglobulin A content and circulating mature B (CD21+/major histocompatibility complex class II+) cells in young puppies.20 It has been suggested that this probiotic may be useful in the prevention or treatment of canine gastrointestinal disease. This organism may, however, enhance Campylobacter jejuni adhesion and colonization of the dog intestine, perhaps conferring carrier status on colonized dogs.21\nLactobacillus acidophilus has also been shown to safely colonize the canine gastrointestinal tract.",

Following oral dosing, most of the sulfasalazine is transported to the distal gastrointestinal tract where cecal and colonic bacteria metabolize the drug to its component parts. Sulfapyridine is largely absorbed by the colonic mucosa, but much of the 5-aminosalicylate remains in the colonic lumen where it inhibits mucosal lipoxygenase and the inflammatory cascade. Sulfasalazine has been recommended for the treatment of canine large bowel IBD at doses of 10 to 30 mg/kg PO q8-12h for 4 to 6 weeks. With resolution of clinical signs, sulfasalazine dosages are gradually decreased by 25% at 2-week intervals and eventually discontinued while maintaining dietary management. Salicylates are readily absorbed and induce toxicity in cats, therefore this drug classification should be used with great caution in cats.22 If used in cats, some authors have recommended using half of the recommended dog dose (i.e., 10 to 30 mg/kg PO q8-24h). Sulfasalazine usage has been associated with the development of keratoconjunctivitis sicca in the dog, so tear production should be assessed subjectively (by the pet owner) and objectively (by the veterinarian) during usage.23, 24\n",
