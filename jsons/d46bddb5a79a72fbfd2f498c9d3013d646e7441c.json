The first test with direct 1 laryngoscopy showed a large amount of dye on the laryngoscopist's faceshield, gown, arms, 2 glove, neck and hair. The second test with the videolaryngoscopy technique showed significantly 3 lower amount of dye on the laryngoscopist in similar locations, visually less than half the 4 quantity compared to direct laryngoscopy. The third test with videolaryngoscopy and the box 5 showed dye only on the gloves and forearms within the box; no dye was visible on any part of 6 the laryngoscopist located outside the box including gown, face shield, neck and hair (Fig. 1) . 7 8 Our simulation method is one of the few simulation to show both large and small droplet 9",

Out of the 10 three methods, videolaryngoscopy, as compared to direct laryngoscopy, was the preferred 11 method of tracheal intubation given the significant decrease in the amount of aerosolized 12 droplets on the laryngoscopist. The box offered an additional physical barrier as compared to 13 videolaryngoscopy. However, we believe that with proper personal protection equipment, there 14 is minimal additional benefit in terms of droplet protection. Our technique measured droplet 15 spread primarily, and my be less sensitive to fine aerosols. A potential disadvantage of the box is 16 the restriction to movement and adapting to a new way of intubation. In the event that the airway 17 proves to be difficult, the box should be immediately abandoned. 18",
