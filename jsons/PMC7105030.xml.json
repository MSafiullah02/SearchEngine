            "text": "Membrane-bound cell organelles are typically considered to have rather spherical topology, delineated by one phospholipid-bilayer membrane that separates the interior from the exterior. However, this simplification of organelle topology is a rule not a law, and it is well known that a large number of membrane structures exists in Nature with more complex 3D morphologies. Indeed, the topology of membrane-bound organelles is a rather unexplored area of research. This might be due to difficulties in obtaining information about topological parameters from living or fixed cells, and the interpretation of these parameters in the cellular context. Nevertheless, the importance of topology considerations, for example, subcellular compartmentalization, transport phenomena, and sorting events that involve membrane trafficking processes is evident. Cell membrane morphology, controlled by the principles of self-assembly and/or self-organization, is likely to adopt an optimally organized structure under the influence of selective conditions. This is a dynamic process, perhaps restricted to sub-membrane domains, and short-lived, and is dependent on the lipid as well as protein components of the membrane.",

Indeed, higher order membrane topologies identified by transmission electron microscopy (TEM), are frequently reported in the literature, yet due to their very heterogeneous representations, common features are difficult to comprehend. Among these nonlamellar cell membranes, especially cubic membrane organizations attract great attention (Almsherqi et al., 2006, Hyde et al., 1996, Landh, 1995, Landh, 1996) because of their unique feature of 3D periodicity in TEM micrographs and great similarity to the bicontinuous lipidic cubic phases (Bouligand, 1990, Larsson, 1989, Larsson et al., 1980, Luzzati, 1997). Cubic membranes (Figure 6.1, Figure 6.2\n) have therefore often been compared to self-assembled cubic lipidic phases in aqueous dispersions that are well characterized in vitro, with several applications. Indeed, the efforts toward understanding formation and functional roles of cubic membranes in biological systems have been paralleled by the efforts in investigating cubic phases formation and their behavior in lipid\u2013water systems.",

            "text": "Biological membranes may exhibit point or line symmetry. A membrane is symmetrical if it can be nontrivially rotated, inverted, mirrored, and translated such that it is indistinguishable from its initial appearance. Symmetry of biological membranes is mainly described by rotations. Several sets of membrane arrangements exhibit symmetry such as parallel membranes and hexagonal packing of tubes. In contrast, a cubic membrane exhibits distinct morphological patterns when projected which may even be translated into unique signatures in many directions (Fig. 6.3\n). The patterned membrane organization of cubic membranes consists of a network arranged in a nonrandom order and is evenly spaced. Therefore, through an overall inspection of TEM micrographs, cubic membranes are recognized via perceptual cues of the patterned membrane organization (Almsherqi et al., 2006, Landh, 1996). This unique appearance of cubic membranes in TEM micrographs frequently allows for the differentiation of cubic membrane organization from other membrane arrangements such as tubulo-reticular structures (TRS) and annulate lamellae (AL) (Figure 6.4, Figure 6.5\n).",

Both the latter surface descriptions are approximative descriptions of surfaces parallel to the minimal or nonzero level surface (Landh, 1996). Cubic membranes have been detected without any obvious restrictions or preferences in all kingdoms of life, both under physiological or pathological conditions (Table 6.1\n). They appear not to be limited to certain types of cells, although they may occur more frequently in some cell types. Furthermore, cubic membranes are not strictly associated with any particular organelle and can apparently evolve from almost any cytomembrane: plasma membrane, endoplasmic reticulum (ER), nuclear envelope (NE, both inner (INE) and outer (ONE)), inner mitochondrial membrane, and the Golgi complex. The smooth ER, however, seems to be the organelle most frequently associated with cubic membrane formation. So far, three surface families have been identified to exist, and these three types of cubic membranes are schematically shown in Fig. 6.2. They are designated according to their corresponding triply periodic minimal (or level) surfaces as gyroid (G), double diamond (D), and primitive (P) surfaces.",

            "text": "Cubic membranes often coexist with other \u201cunusual\u201d membrane arrangements, such as TRS, which are irregularly arranged tubes that bifurcate and reanastomose. In many cases, these tubes show a preferential orientation. The main difference of TRS to cubic membranes is that TRS symmetry is usually nematic, since the layers do not show obvious periodic distribution (Fig. 6.4D). The preferential alignment along a direction may be due to an elongation process, perhaps in association with the cytoskeleton, and is not necessarily the result of a spontaneous membrane alignment. However, there are many cases in which the periphery of a perfectly preserved cubic morphology shows TRS appearance, which, therefore, may be introduced by the fixation method (Landh, 1995). Membranes of true cubic morphology are often mis-labeled as TRS in the literature, due to the convoluted image projections observed for both structures. Many of the examples listed in Table 6.1 have been designated as TRS, despite the presence of a distinct cubic symmetry (Almsherqi et al., 2005, Landh, 1996). TRS have attracted biomedical interest due to their potential use as an ultrastructural marker for pathological conditions: they occur in virus-infected and in cancer cells and have been, therefore, often regarded as an indicator of infection or transformation. For example, TRS have been observed in cells infected with SARS (Almsherqi et al., 2005) and HIV (Kostianovsky et al., 1987).",

            "text": "In addition to TRS, annulate lamellae (AL) are another type of convoluted 3D membrane structure, and their appearance is also often correlated with that of cubic membranes. AL are frequently observed in differentiating gamates, namely in vertebrate oocytes and in spermatogonia, and appear to occur in close association with the cell nucleus (see Table 6.1). Tangential TEM sections of AL most often exhibit a hexagonal arrangement (Kessel, 1983), whereas perpendicular sections do not reveal any obvious symmetrical arrangement, even though they always exhibit an astonishingly regular organization, indicating an underlying periodic structure. Based on the apparent morphological similarities between AL and the NE, it has been suggested that AL represent a cytoplasmic NE extension that functions as a reservoir for both ER membrane components and nuclear pores (Kessel, 1983, Kessel, 1992). In favor of such speculations is the fact that AL have been observed in direct continuity with the outer nuclear membrane, and that they also have been suggested to contain nuclear pore complexes (Landh, 1996). AL are assembled of superimposed pairs of membrane bilayers, which join along the pores whose distribution may vary (hexagonal, quadratic, or random). The pores present in AL are either facing each other if the membrane symmetry is hexagonal (Fig. 6.4B) or the appearance of pores alternates in a quadratic membrane arrangement (Fig. 6.4A).",

However, Snapp et al.

This observation might explain phenomena such as (a) the heterogeneity of ER membrane structures, (b) the high rate of (reversible) lamellar to cubic membrane transition, and (c) the technical difficulties and limitations in isolating intact cubic membranes from biological samples.",

With respect to bilayer arrangements, the geometries of cubic membranes are similar to those of the cubic phases, however, two major differences exist: (i) the unit cell size and (ii) the water activity. It has been argued that the latter must control the topology of the cubic membrane (Bouligand, 1990) and hence that the cubic membrane structures must be of the inverted type rather than \u201cnormal\u201d type (type I). All known lipid\u2013water and lipid\u2013protein\u2013water systems that exhibit phases in equilibrium with excess water are of the inverted type (type II).

Inverted cubic phases have been observed with very high water activity (70\u201390%), in the mixtures of lipids, in lipid\u2013protein systems, in lipid\u2013polymer systems (Landh, 1994), and in lipid and lipopolysaccharide mixtures (Brandenburg et al., 1990, Brandenburg et al., 1992).",

As a consequence, membrane ultrastructures derived from TEM images are frequently misinterpreted, in particular for the highly folded and interconnected 3D morphologies resembling cubic membranes. TEM relies on 70\u201390 nm thick sections through the specimens and the 2D image obtained is the result of a projection of a 3D structure. Therefore, nonlamellar biological membranes, such as inverted hexagonal or cubic structures, may yield very heterogeneous projection patterns by TEM, dependent on the orientation of the section relative to the structural axes (Fig. 6.3). Interpretation of TEM membrane patterns is further complicated if the lattice size of the observed structure is considerably smaller than that of the section thickness.",

More elaborate electron tomography (ET) has contributed a great deal of resolution to understanding cubic membrane organizations and their continuity with and relations to the neighbor structures (Deng et al., 1999). In ET, rather thick sections (400 nm) are imaged in multiple tilted angles (up to \u00b160\u00b0), yielding a large number of projections; these images are reconstructed by computational image analysis into a 3D representation of the object, which allows the 3D reconstruction of cellular structures with a resolution of 5 nm, that is, approaching the level or larger molecular assemblies (for a review see Lucic et al., 2005). EM tomography has previously been successfully applied to determine cubic membrane transition of the inner mitochondrial membrane morphology in the amoeba C. carolinense upon starvation (Deng et al., 1999). Cryo-ET from specimens in vitreous ice further improves sample preservation and membrane resolution, but obviously is not yet routinely established. Cryo-ET avoids common artifacts of conventional EM preparation techniques and is also suited for high-resolution analyses of membrane-bound organelles (Hsieh et al., 2006, Lucic et al., 2005).",

Therefore, alternative methods have to be applied to reconstruct\u2014potential\u20143D membrane morphologies from single TEM sections. Indeed, based on well-defined mathematical models of cubic membrane arrangements, projections can be calculated that simulate various section orientations and thicknesses (Fig. 6.3). Such a \u201cdirect template correlative\u201d (DTC) matching method (Almsherqi et al., 2005, Almsherqi et al., 2006, Deng and Mieczkowski, 1998, Landh, 1995, Landh, 1996) has been developed based on pattern and symmetry recognition. Through the DTC method, the electron density of the TEM image is correlated to a library of computer-simulated 2D projection maps that allows to unequivocally deduce the nature of the cubic membrane arrangement. An application of the DTC method to identify cubic membrane organization in TEM micrographs is shown in Fig. 6.7\n. In brief, the 2D projections (Fig. 6.7C) calculated from a mathematical 3D model (Fig. 6.7B) are matched with a selected TEM micrograph (Fig. 6.7A); consequently, a successful pattern match defines the nature of the membrane arrangement in 3D (Deng and Mieczkowski, 1998, Landh, 1995, Landh, 1996). The DTC method simplifies the experimental requirements for recording cubic membranes in biological samples, and can also be applied to examine published TEM micrographs in retrospect.

Table 6.1 summarizes a survey of the literature of the past six decades on cubic membrane morphologies identified in organelles, from protozoan to human cells. The occurrence of cubic membranes is listed by genera and, if applicable, the type and lattice size of the cubic membrane extracted from the published TEM images are presented (see also Hyde et al., 1996, Landh, 1996). Not surprisingly, due to the absence of a clear understanding of the 3D structure of the depicted membranes, many of the examples have been considered as novelties with little or no reflection on the wealth of related contributions in the literature. Hence, these morphologies appear under a large variety of nicknames, some of which are also listed in Table 6.1. Furthermore, the examples have been chosen to best represent the structural characteristics of cubic membranes, and an effort has been made to leave out those perhaps less recognizable structures such as \u201cmembraneous tubular\u201d, \u201ccisternal systems\u201d, \u201ctubular inclusions\u201d, or \u201ccisternal convolutions\u201d etc. In many cases where we have chosen not to classify the cubic membrane it is mainly due to the lack of discernible details in the TEM micrographs. Interestingly, many of these undetermined cubic membrane morphologies are reported in pathological conditions in hominoidae.",

Overexpression of this enzyme in UT-1 (Chin et al., 1982) or Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) cells (Jingami et al., 1987, Roitelman et al., 1992) induces formation of crystalloid ER, which houses most of the HMG-CoA reductase enzyme (Anderson et al., 1983, Orci et al., 1984).

Possibly the best-characterized cubic membrane transition was observed in the mitochondrial inner membranes of the free-living giant amoeba, C. carolinense (Deng and Mieczkowski, 1998). In this organism, mitochondrial inner membranes undergo dramatic changes in 3D organization upon food depletion, providing an attractive, reversible model system to investigate induced membrane reorganization. Within one day of starvation, 70% of mitochondria undergo this morphological transition, which is observed in virtually all mitochondria after 7 days of starvation (Daniels and Breyer, 1968). This structural alteration of mitochondria in C. carolinense has been identified by a number of laboratories; however, in several reports the inner mitochondrial membranes take the appearance of tubular-like configurations that may appear in conjunction with well defined cubic membranes (Borysko and Roslansky, 1959, Brandt and Pappas, 1959, Daniels and Breyer, 1968, Sedar and Rudzinska, 1956). Indeed, by EM tomography, we have unambiguously demonstrated that inner mitochondrial membranes in C. carolinense cells adopt cubic morphology under starvation conditions (Deng et al., 1999). This induced transition is accompanied by alterations in cellular oxidative stress response, which led us to speculate that cubic membrane formation may be associated with oxidative stress (Deng et al., 2002) (see also discussion below). Intriguingly, formation of cubic membranes in amoeba Chaos is fully reversible to wild-type tubular morphology, upon refeeding (Deng and Mieczkowski, 1998).",

Paramecium cells are able to maintain an almost constant intracellular osmolarity regardless of the environmental osmolarity. The complex regulation of the cell volume and osmotic gradient is primarily established by the smooth spongiome, which exhibits cubic membrane organization. Therefore, cubic membranes have been suggested to play roles in water segregation and intracellular volume and osmolarity control (Landh, 1996).",

Despite the elegant study of Ishikawa (1968), the 3D structure of these \u201choneycombs\u201d was resolved only 30 years after their first discovery (Landh, 1996) and unambiguously demonstrated to be of cubic membrane morphology of the gyroid (G) subtype.",

Intranuclear cubic or tubular membrane organizations usually develop in fast replicating neoplastic (tumor) cells (Babai et al., 1969, Karasaki, 1970) or non\u2010neoplastic cells such as oocytes (Kessel and Beams, 1968, Miller, 1966). Their presence might play a role in mitotic activity or in facilitating nuclear-cytoplasmic communication. In human cells, intranuclear tubular (hexagonal or cubic) membrane organization was demonstrated in the endometrium during the secretory phase of the menstrual cycle (Bourgeois and Hubert, 1988, Ghadially, 1988). Progesterone and medroxyprogesterone can induce tubular structure formation in human endometrium (Kohorn et al., 1972), which suggests a role of an extrinsic hormonal factor in cell membrane organization.",

Deletion of two of the seven membrane spanning regions or a truncated protein did not result in crystalloid ER formation, and the protein localized to disordered sheets rather than packed membrane tubules under these conditions. High expression levels of the soluble fragment of HMG-CoA reductase did not induce any crystalloid ER, again indicating that it is the transmembrane domain of HMG-CoA reductase that plays an important role in determining the structure of crystalloid ER (Jingami et al., 1987, Yamamoto et al., 1996).",

Notably, despite the presence of elevated levels of HMG-CoA reductase, which is the key enzyme of sterol biosynthesis, the membrane of the crystalloid ER appears to have very little cholesterol. Upon addition of cholesterol to UT-1 cells, which intercalates into the ER membrane, HMG-CoA reductase was subsequently degraded and the crystalloid ER disappeared (Jingami et. al., 1987); sterol supplementation drastically reduced the rate of HMG-CoA reductase synthesis and also prevented the formation of new crystalloid ER. It was therefore speculated that the cubic membrane is an alteration in the feedback control of cholesterol synthesis, for the production of sterols and the biogenesis of smooth ER. Interestingly, administration of compactin, which is an HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor, also leads to HMG-CoA reductase overexpression, and induces the formation of stacked and aggregated structures, which were termed \u201ckarmellae\u201d in yeast (Wright et al., 1988).",

It was proposed that the biogenesis of OSER structures involves weak homotypic interactions between cytoplasmic domains of proteins and may underlie the formation of other stacked membrane structures within the cells as well. Time-lapse imaging of OSER biogenesis revealed that these structures formed rather quickly once a threshold level of OSER-inducing proteins was exceeded; OSER-formation also involved gross remodeling of surrounding tubular ER. In this system, the attachment to the cytoplasmic domain of different ER-resident membrane proteins of green fluorescent protein (GFP) that is capable of low affinity, head-to-tail dimerization was sufficient to induce OSER formation upon overexpression in living cells. Homotypic low affinity interactions between cytoplasmic domains of proteins thus can differentiate tubular ER into stacked lamellae or crystalloid structures; such a mechanism may underlie the reorganization of other organelles into stacked structures as well (Snapp et al., 2003), and provides an intriguing model system to investigate the cellular and molecular requirements for cubic membrane formation.",

Mitofilin, F1F0-ATPsynthase, and fission-fusion proteins may induce tubular or stacked lamellar and whorl-type membrane structures upon experimental overexpression. F1F0-ATPsynthase is an essential enzymatic complex of the mitochondrial inner membrane, which couples the proton electrochemical gradient generated by the respiratory chain to ATP synthesis. Various studies have shown that this complex is strongly implicated in the curvature of the inner mitochondrial membrane (reviewed by Voeltz and Prinz, 2007). Dimerization of the complex drives tubulation of the cristae (Dudkina et al., 2005, Strauss et al., 2008), while further oligomerization of these dimers is responsible for the formation and/or stabilization of inner membrane tubules. Mitofilin is a mitochondrial inner membrane protein, which assembles into a large multimeric protein complex. siRNA knockdown of mitofilin in HeLa cells yielded mitochondria with disorganized mitochondrial inner membranes: they failed to form tubular or vesicular cristae and appeared as intermittently fused, closely packed stacks of membrane sheets, resulting in a complex maze of membraneous networks (John et al., 2005). Mitofilin thus appears to be a key organizer of mitochondrial cristae morphology (John et al., 2005). The role of mitochondrial proteins in cubic membrane formation in starved amoeba Chaos, which is a suitable model for analyzing reversible cubic membrane formation, is currently under investigation in the authors' laboratories.",

These proteins are highly enriched in the tubular portions of the ER and virtually excluded from other regions. The study by Voeltz and coworkers (2006) illustrated the role of Rtn4a/NogoA, a member of the ubiquitous reticulon protein family that share a conserved C-terminal reticulon domain. Over-expression of Rtn4a/NogoA in mammalian cells, promoted the formation of ER tubules; membrane tubule formation in vitro, on the other hand, was prevented by anti-Rtn4a/NogoA antibodies. Similar results were observed in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, in which overexpression of Rtn1 (the yeast ortholog of Rtn4a/NogoA in mammals) also enhanced tubular ER formation. Yeast mutants lacking both Yop1 (an Rtn1 paralog) and Rtn1 showed a disrupted tubular ER, underscoring the important function of these proteins in shaping membrane structures. Reticulons contain long, hydrophobic domains that are inserted into the outer leaflet of the lipid bilayer. Since the hydrophobic domains are longer than required for spanning a bilayer membrane, it is believed that they promote a hairpin-like insertion into the lipid bilayer and give the overall appearance of a wedge-like protein. Thus, a local concentration of reticulons might induce and stabilize a high, positive membrane curvature.",

One exception to the rule is the observation of a t-tubular system in skeletal muscles (Ishikawa, 1968), in which cubic membrane organization has been associated with caveolin-3 expression (Parton et al., 1997). Caveolin is synthesized in the ER but mostly resides in certain domains of the plasma membrane. Caveolins are known to play a role in inducing and maintaining membrane curvature. Individual caveolin molecules are cotranslationally integrated into the bilayer of the ER. Similar to reticulons, caveolins form a hairpin-loop within the bilayer, and tend to form hexa- or heptamers. These oligomers may leave from the ER and are transported via the Golgi apparatus to the plasma membrane, where, by a yet unknown mechanism, they induce localized sites of membrane curvature, known as caveolae (Bauer and Pelkmans, 2006, Voeltz and Prinz, 2007).",

Detailed lipid analysis of amoeba Chaos exhibiting cubic membrane organization in their mitochondria, revealed an unusually high concentration of highly polyunsaturated fatty acids (C22:5; docosapentaenoic acid, DPA). Three predominant lipid species, namely plasmalogen PE (C16:0p/C22:5), plasmalogen PC (C16:0p/C22:5), and diacyl-PI (C22:5/C22:5), were identified in amoeba Chaos lipid extracts (Fig. 6.9\n), and their relative amounts increased up to 2.5-fold under starvation stress conditions (Deng et al., submitted). A rich body of data (for review see Nagan and Zoeller, 2001) suggests that plasmalogens\u2014which are also present in mammalian cell membranes\u2014may serve as mediators of membrane dynamics due to their high propensity to form inverted hexagonal structures. This property has also suggested a potential role for plasmalogens in facilitating membrane fusion processes (for review see Brites et al., 2004). Biophysical studies have also shown that the presence of plasmalogen PE lowers the lamellar to hexagonal-phase transition temperature (Lohner, 1996). Interestingly, CHO cells, which display massive membrane rearrangements upon HMG-CoA reductase overexpression (Fig. 6.5), are also rich in plasmalogen lipids (up to 11% of their total phospholipids), especially plasmalogen PE (Nagan et al., 1998).",

As a consequence of altered electrostatic interactions at the membrane interface, induced either by the increase in surface charge density of the membrane or by a decrease in salt concentration, the lipid membrane phase may change from the lamellar to the cubic phase. Such cubic phases may not only form to adopt the altered membrane proteins or charge distribution, but may also provide the means to rapidly adjust cellular physiology to the changing environmental conditions, such as fluctuations of (local) intracellular Ca2+ levels. The \u201cbreathing\u201d of cubic membranes, that is, the changes in lattice size as demonstrated in vitro (de Campo et al., 2004), may represent an immediate biophysical response, which may allow for a rapid adaptation to the water content and ion concentration or charge distribution in a given membrane compartment also in vivo.",

Some evidence suggests that virus infection and deregulation of HMG-CoA reductase are mechanistically linked, resulting in similar membrane phenotypes. For example, West Nile Virus infection is associated with local cholesterol alterations of the plasma membrane of the host cell that leads to a sequestration of membraneous sites of viral replication (Mackenzie et al., 2007). Depletion of cholesterol in the plasma membrane triggers HMG-CoA reductase upregulation and consequently leads to the formation of a crystalloid (cubic or hexagonal) ER membrane. The virus-induced convoluted membrane was reported to be essential for viral replication and survival: administration of cholesterol that reverses the HMG-CoA reducase-induced convoluted membrane formation in the infected cells significantly suppresses viral replication (Mackenzie et al., 2007). A recent study has also shown that virus-induced membrane complexes might provide partial protection against the host immune response (Hoenen et al., 2007) and hence offer a site for efficient viral replication (Mackenzie et al., 2007) or facilitate nucleo-cytoplasmic transport of genetic material (Almsherqi et al., 2008).",

TRS appear to be nonspecific to tumor differentiation or malignancy as they develop in highly replicative undifferentiated cells as well as in differentiated tumor cells.

T-tubular morphological membrane transformation has been described in denervated muscles (Gori, 1972, Madarame et al., 1986, Miledi and Slater, 1969, Pellegrino and Franzini, 1963), in the muscles with induced experimental myopathy (Macdonald and Engel, 1970), bupivacaine-induced myonecrosis (Huxley and Taylor, 1958), and in tenotomized muscles of the rat (Andreev and Wassilev, 1994). They have also been observed in various human muscles as a consequence of muscular diseases (Borg et al., 1989, Cornog and Gonatas, 1967, Engel and Dale, 1968, Engel and Macdonald, 1970, Gori, 1972, Iorio di et al., 1989, Miike et al., 1984). The fact that cubic membrane organization appears under pathological conditions of myopathy support the notion that they may be formed in response to stress conditions, such as a decrease in cell volume in the case of muscular dystrophy. Thus, it could be speculated that the potential function of cubic membrane structures is to maintain cellular integrity by regulating the volume of the cell (organelle) and/or to accommodate stress-induced membrane-resident proteins. Interestingly, induced formation of honeycomb t-tubules may also be part of a developmental program as these membrane structures are also observed in tadpole tail muscles that spontaneously degenerate during metamorphosis (Sasaki et al., 1985). Frequent transformation of t-tubules into G-type cubic membrane (honeycomb) organization in regenerating muscle fibers post pathological or experimentally induced muscular dystrophy may reflect the adaptive reorganization of the membrane system in the regenerating cell.",

By definition, a multimembraneous structure consisting of (n) membranes, partitions space into (n + 1) physically distinct, intertwined, but separate subspaces. The identity of each space itself is not a consequence of the existence of a cubic membrane; rather it is an effect of a topologically invariant membrane morphogenesis. Although an intracellular space maintains its identity as long as membrane continuity is preserved, it is only by means of a hyperbolic membrane structure that such spatial relations can be rigorously defined.

To what extent intracellular trafficking depends on or can be optimized through specific types of membrane organization, for example, as continuous 3D space partitioners or networks, is unknown. In the three dimensions of a cell, the partitioning of the intracellular space into subvolumes\u2014leading to an interpenetrated pipeline system\u2014could in principle be orchestrated by membrane organization, which ultimately controls spatio-temporal activities, including intracellular trafficking and transportation, and fast response to physiological alterations such as changing temperature, osmolarity or pH. Recognition of the existence of topologically distinct spaces through the formation of cubic membranes implies that cell space is restricted and predetermined to maintain distinct but interconnected subcellular domains. Cubic membranes may induce enrichment\u2014or exclusion\u2014of certain lipids and proteins, as a prerequisite for vesicle-mediated subcellular trafficking. They may also function as partitioners within a membrane, to create subdomains of specific molecular composition and function. It has been repeatedly noted that the stage of cell division and differentiation has a strong influence on the formation of cubic membranes. Cells that undergo rapid cell division and differentiation, such as the differentiating sieve elements, cells during spermatogenesis, or tumor cells are well over-represented in the collection of cubic-membrane forming cells (Table 6.1). Obviously, during cell division and differentiation events, there is a greater need for regulated spatio-temporal transport, as well as cellular communication, which is particularly well illustrated during spermatogenesis (Table 6.1). In the case of differentiating sieve elements, cubic membranes might have a particular role in the assimilated transport process. Finally, it is of interest to note that aggregates of \u201csynaptic vesicles\u201d often resemble cubic membranes. This can be taken as an indication of a possible on-off mechanism of membrane continuity, which might account for a regulative capacity for the controlled release of transmitter substances.",

In particular, a cubic bilayer arrangement could serve as a regulator of chemical or physical potentials across the membrane surface. This is indicated in several cases in which cubic membranes have been found to be sensitive to the growth medium. An osmo-regulative capacity of a plasma membrane-associated cubic membrane can be envisioned, which might serve to allow rapid adjustment to osmotic changes. Such a function is, for instance, consistent with the presence of cubic membranes in a variety of epithelial cells (Table 6.1). Cubic membranes may also be involved in curvature-controlled activation and regulation of membrane enzyme activities. For instance, diacylglycerols, which may function as second messengers to activate protein kinase C (PKC), display a strong propensity to form negatively curved membrane structures. The activity of PKC, however, is not specifically dependent on lipids that induce reverse hexagonal phases (Senisterra and Epand, 1993), and thus, reversed cubic phases. In view of the ubiquitous occurrence of cubic membranes it would be of interest to investigate the influence of PKC on cubic phases, and vice versa, to eventually correlate the geometry of the environment to protein activity.",

A physical role has been proposed for the selection of D-surface geometry (Guo et al., 1995), based on theoretical considerations on how the geometry of crystals controls the emission or absorption of certain wavelengths of light through the existence of photonic band-gaps (Babin et al., 2002). Although the D-surface is isotropic, its geometry is such that it may potentially trap photons. The absorbed energy could then be used by certain molecules that are positioned along a particular lattice direction, and, for instance, trigger conformational changes to revert PLB into an active thylakoid membrane geometry. A similar structural role can be considered for the selection of different subtypes of cubic membrane architecture (photosome) in bioluminescent scaleworms (Bassot, 1964, Bassot, 1966). Interestingly, the photosome membrane organization has a D subtype cubic membrane in the resting (unstimulated) state, however, upon electrical or optical stimulation the membrane configuration changes and acquires P subtype. Do different cubic membrane subtypes manipulate different wavelengths? Does the function of the cubic membrane change with the specific alteration of its geometrical configuration? The answers to these questions clearly deserve further investigations. In addition, several other photoactive cell types exist that contain cubic membranes. Mitochondria in the retinal cone of the tree shrew (Tupaia glis) (Foelix et al., 1987) may adopt an isotropic membrane structure that allows efficient capture of the incoming light; in an alternative model, this multilayer G-surface cubic arrangement of the mitochondrial membrane (Fig. 6.7) may preferentially reflect UV light before reaching the outer segment of the retina, thus representing a specialized optical filter system.",

Indeed, isolated mitochondria with cubic membrane organization from starved amoeba cells (see above) have recently been shown to incorporate and retain short oligonucleotides (ODN) with high efficiency (Fig. 6.11\n) (Almsherqi et al., 2008). Although the molecular basis for the high affinity of ODN to cubic membranes has not been uncovered yet, it is reasonable to assume that it is strongly promoted by electrostatic interactions with the highly curved and extended membrane surface. Furthermore, delivery of ODN-cubic membrane complexes to mammalian cells in culture appears to be very effective and might, therefore, provide an attractive alternative to currently employed cationic lipoplexes and promises high efficacy and reduced cytotoxicity. Use of cubic membranes of biological origin as a carrier for DNA transfection or delivery of other nucleic acids, such as small interfering RNA and/or short hairpin RNA is currently under active investigation (Almsherqi et al., 2008).",

In general, the lattice size of the photonic crystal has to be of the same magnitude as the wavelength range it controls. Photonic crystals based on triply periodic surfaces with the largest photonic band gaps known are of type D and G cubic morphology (Babin et al., 2002). Similar G-surfaces describe the cubic membrane organization of the inner mitochondrial membranes (Fig. 6.7) in the tree shrew's (Tupaia belangeri) retina (Foelix et al., 1987) and photosynthesis-related membranes in prolamellar bodies of higher plants and chloroplasts of the green algae Zygnema (Fig. 6.6) (Deng, 1998, Deng and Landh, 1995). Based on these similar cubic geometries and relevant lattice sizes, it is tempting to speculate that perhaps Tupaia mitochondrial membranes and cubic membranes in Zygnema chloroplasts and PLB of higher plants may function as photonic crystals. The 12-layered cubic membrane organization of the mitochondria in retinal cones of tree shrew Tupaia and multilayer grana of photosynthetic membranes may thus enable these membranes to amplify, refract, or absorb certain wavelengths of light. Whether such an elaborate membrane arrangement is a protective response or whether it provides a specialized reaction center for embedded proteins awaits detailed analysis.",

The extensive generation of membrane surfaces to facilitate exchange reactions between two (or more) sub-volumes, or the sequestration of specific lipids or proteins into membrane domains of nonlamellar morphology may provide a physiological advantage to cope with various stress phenomena. Current analyses of nonlamellar membrane arrangements are largely restricted to the descriptive level; the identification of inducible membrane systems, such as in virus-infected cells or the reversible transition of mitochondrial inner membranes of amoeba Chaos to cubic morphology upon starvation, however, opens new avenues for understanding the molecular mechanisms and cellular requirements underlying these membrane arrangements.
