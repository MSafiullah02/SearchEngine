Vaccinia virus as a vector for the full-length IBV cDNA has the advantage that modifi cations can be introduced into the IBV cDNA using homologous recombination, a method frequently used to insert and delete sequences from the vaccinia virus genome. Here, we describe the use of transient dominant selection as a method for introducing modifi cations into the IBV cDNA; that has been successfully used for the substitution of specifi c nucleotides, deletion of genomic regions, and the exchange of complete genes. Infectious recombinant IBVs are generated in situ following the transfection of vaccinia virus DNA, containing the modifi ed IBV cDNA, into cells infected with a recombinant fowlpox virus expressing T7 DNA dependant RNA polymerase.",

IBV replicates primarily in the respiratory tract but also in many other epithelial surfaces including oviducts, enteric surfaces and kidneys [ 2 -5 ] . Following infection with IBV, egg production and quality may be impaired in layers and weight gain in broilers is reduced [ 6 ] . Infected birds are predisposed to secondary bacterial infections such as colibaccilosis and mortality in young chicks is not uncommon. Fecal excretion of the virus is a consequence of replication in the intestinal tract; however, this does not normally result in clinical disease.",

In a report, commissioned by Defra in 2005 [ 10 ] , IBV was indicated as a major cause of ill health amongst chickens and was implicated as being responsible for more economic loss in the UK poultry industry than any other disease [ 11 , 12 ] ; IBV was estimated to cost the UK economy nearly \u00a319 million per year, mainly due to loss of egg production, with serious implications for animal welfare.

Coronavirus genomes consist of single stranded positive sense RNA, and are the largest of all the RNA viruses ranging from approximately 27 to 32 kb; the genome of IBV is 27.6 kb. Molecular analysis of the role of individual genes in the pathogenesis of RNA viruses has been advanced by the availability of fulllength cDNAs, for the generation of infectious RNA transcripts that can replicate and result in infectious viruses. The assembly of full-length coronavirus cDNAs was hampered due to regions from the replicase gene being unstable in bacteria. We therefore devised a reverse genetics strategy for IBV involving the insertion of a fulllength cDNA copy of the IBV genome, under the control of a T7 RNA promoter, into the vaccinia virus genome in place of the thymidine kinase (TK) gene. A hepatitis \u03b4 ribozyme (H\u03b4R) is located downstream of the coronavirus poly(A) tail followed by a T7 termination sequence. IBV infectious RNA is generated from the T7 promoter immediately adjacent to the 5\u2032 end of the IBV cDNA using T7 RNA polymerase and terminates at the T7 termination sequence downstream of the H\u03b4R sequence, which autocleaves itself and the T7-termination sequence at the end of the poly(A) sequence, resulting in an authentic IBV genomic RNA copy. Infectious IBV is recovered in situ in cells both transfected with vaccinia virus DNA and infected with a recombinant fowlpox virus expressing T7 RNA polymerase [ 13 ] .",

A second and equally important advantage is the ability to modify the IBV cDNA within the vaccinia virus vector through transient dominant selection ( TDS ), a method taking advantage of recombinant events between homologous sequences [ 15 , 16 ] . The TDS method relies on a three-step procedure. In the fi rst step, the modifi ed IBV cDNA is inserted into a plasmid containing a selective marker under the control of a vaccinia virus promoter. In our case we use a plasmid, pGPTNEB193 ( Fig. 1 ; [ 17 ] ), which contains a dominant selective marker gene, Escherichia coli guanine phosphoribosyltransferase ( Ecogpt ; [ 18 ] ), under the control of the vaccinia virus P7.5K early/late promoter.",

            "text": "In the second step, this complete plasmid sequence is integrated into the IBV sequence within the vaccinia virus genome (Fig. 2 ) . This occurs as a result of a single crossover event involving homologous recombination between the IBV cDNA in the plasmid and the IBV cDNA sequence in the vaccinia virus genome. The resulting recombinant vaccinia viruses (rVV) are highly unstable due to the presence of duplicate sequences and are only maintained by the selective pressure of the Ecogpt gene, which confers resistance to mycophenolic acid (MPA) in the presence of xanthine and hypoxanthine [ 15 ] . In the third step, the MPA-resistant rVVs are grown in the absence of MPA selection, resulting in the loss of the Ecogpt gene due to a second single homologous recombination event between the duplicated sequences (Fig. 3 ) . During this third step two recombination events can occur; one event will result in the generation of the original (unmodifi ed) IBV sequence and the other in the generation of an IBV cDNA containing the desired modifi cation (i.e., the modifi cation within the plasmid sequence). In theory these two events will occur at equal frequency however in practice this is not necessarily the case.

Plasmid pGPTNEB193 contains the Ecogpt selection gene under the control of the vaccinia virus early/late P 7.5K promoter, a multiple cloning region for the insertion of the sequence to be incorporated into the vaccinia virus genome and the bla gene (not shown) for ampicillin selection of the plasmid in E. coli . For modifi cation of the IBV genome, a sequence corresponding to the region being modifi ed, plus fl anking regions of 500-800 nucleotides for recombination purposes is inserted into the multiple cloning sites using an appropriate restriction endonuclease.

In addition, a plasmid, pCi-Nuc [ 13 , 20 ] , expressing the IBV nucleoprotein (N), under the control of both the cytomegalovirus (CMV) RNA polymerase II promoter and the T7 RNA promoter, is co-transfected into the CK cells. Expression of T7 RNA polymerase in the presence of the IBV N protein and the rVV DNA, containing the full-length IBV cDNA under the control of a T7 promoter, results in the generation of infectious IBV RNA, which in turn results in the production of infectious rIBVs (Fig. 4 ) . Primary CK cells are refractory for growth of most IBV isolates; therefore rIBVs expressing S glycoproteins from such isolates cannot be recovered using CK cells. In order to recover genes. The IBV gene 3 and 5 gene clusters that express three and two gene products, respectively, are also indicated. In the example shown a modifi ed region of the S gene is being introduced into the IBV genome such rIBVs, the supernatants from the transfected CK cells are used to infect 10-day-old embryonated hen's eggs. Allantoic fl uid is collected and any potential virus passed a further three times in 10-day-old embryos. RNA is extracted from the allantoic fl uid of infected eggs and RT-PCR followed by sequencing is used to confi rm the identity of the rIBV. The overall procedure is a multi-step process which can be divided into two parts; the generation of an rVV containing the modifi ed IBV cDNA (Fig. 5 ) and the recovery of infectious rIBV from the rVV vector (Fig. 4 ) . The generation of the Ecogpt plasmids, based on pGPTNEB193, containing the modifi ed IBV cDNA, is by standard E. coli cloning methods [ 21 , 22 ] The media is fi ltered through a 0.22 \u03bcm fi lter to remove any FPV-T7 virus.

It is therefore important to pick a number of plaques from the fi rst round of plaque purifi cation in presence of GPT selection agents and take a variety of them forward. The following two rounds of plaque purifi cation in the presence of GPT selection agents ensure a single virus population and also that no carry through of the input receiver/wild type vaccinia virus has occurred. 9. Previous chapters and protocols have instructed during plaque purifi cation in the absence of GPT selection agents to plate 10 \u22121 rVV dilution in the presence of GPT selection medium and rVV dilutions 10 \u22122 and 10 \u22123 in the absence. When there are no plaques in the 10 \u22121 dilution, it means that the rVV has lost the GPT gene and the plaques are ready to amplify and check for the presence of mutations.",

Vaccinia virus DNA is a very large molecule that is very easy to shear, therefore when working with the DNA be gentle and use wide bore tips or cut the ends off ordinary pipette tips. In addition always store vaccinia virus DNA at 4 \u00b0C; do not freeze as this leads to degradation. However, there is an exception to this if the vaccinia virus DNA has been extracted using the Qiagen QlAamp DNA mini kit, as this DNA will have already been sheared (the kit only purifi es intact DNA fragments up to 50 bp). This DNA can be stored at \u221220 \u00b0C but it is only suitable for analysis of the rVV genome by PCR and is not suitable for the infection and transfection of CK cells for the recovery of rIBV.",

The second single-step recombination event is induced in the absence of MPA; loss of selection allows the unstable intermediate to lose one of the tandem repeat sequences including the Ecogpt gene. The second step recombination event can result in either (I) the original sequence of the input vaccinia virus IBV cDNA sequence, in this case shown as a recombination event between the two copies of the 3\u2032 end of the replicase gene which results in loss of the modifi ed S gene sequence along with Ecogpt gene; or (II) retention of the modifi ed S gene sequence and loss of the original S gene sequence and Ecogpt gene as a result of a potential recombination event between the two copies of the 5\u2032 end of the S gene sequence.
