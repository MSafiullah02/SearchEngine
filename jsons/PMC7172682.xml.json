            "text": "Over what is now a 40-year career, I have enjoyed a sustained interest in acute respiratory disease and specifically in rhinovirus. I graduated from the University of Virginia School of Medicine in 1956. That same year, Dr William Mogabgab, working at the Great Lakes Naval Training Station, reported the discovery of the first rhinovirus strain, 2060, later numbered as rhinovirus type 1A. (Pelon et al., 1957) Earlier, there had been important epidemiologic studies into colds conducted in England by Drs Christopher Andrewes and David Tyrrell and in the US, but these studies were seriously hampered by a lack of virology (Frost and Gover, 1932, Andrewes, 1965, Dingle et al., 1964). The discovery of rhinovirus added greatly to the ability of investigators to study colds and also became an important influence on my career. Following a residency in Internal Medicine at Case Western Reserve University, I entered the US Army Medical Corps in 1960 and was stationed at Fort Dix, NJ where I was responsible for the care of many hundreds of recruits with adenovirus ARD. There I observed the research that was being conducted on ARD by Drs Harry Rose of Columbia University and Edward Busher of Walter Reed Army Institute of Research using the new and exciting technique of tissue culture. In 1962, I returned to the University of Virginia to join Dr William Jordan, an author of the highly regarded Cleveland Family Study of Minor Illnesses in the Home. Dr. Jordan had moved to Charlottesville to Chair the Department of Preventive Medicine and was continuing to conduct research on the common cold. During this period, Dr Leonard Hayflick of the Wistar Institute developed the WI 26 strain of human embryonic lung cells which were found to grow rhinovirus very efficiently and were ideal for epidemiologic studies (Hayflick and Moorehead, 1961).",

            "text": "Dr Jordan and I began a study of acute respiratory disease in the approximately 500 employees of the Eastern Regional Office of the State Farm Insurance Company. This work was supported by the Commission on Acute Respiratory Disease of the Armed Forces Epidemiology Board and the Vaccine Development Branch of the National Institutes of Allergy and Infectious Diseases. The insurance employees maintained daily symptom records and supplied specimens for viral culture and serology. The study eventually continued for 15 years. A nurse monitored the employees on a weekly schedule to ensure accurate recording of data. In this study, which employed cell culture for viral identification, rhinovirus accounted for 25% of colds, giving a rate of 0.77 rhinovirus colds per person per year (Gwaltney et al., 1966). This attack rate was consistent with that of an earlier study of young adults conducted in Chicago by Dr Dorothy Hamre (Hamre et al., 1966). The age-specific rates of infection were higher in children than in adults. A seasonal variation in rhinovirus attack rates was also observed in the Charlottesville population which resulted in a consistent large fall peak of illness associated with rhinovirus. Of interest, this yearly rhinovirus outbreak coincided in time with a recurrent peak of respiratory illness identified 20 years earlier by Dr Wade Hampton Frost, a graduate of the University of Virginia and the first Dean of the School of Public Health at Johns Hopkins University. Details of the daily symptom patterns of rhinovirus colds were also obtained from the insurance company data (Gwaltney et al., 1967).",

Because early plastic microtiter plates were toxic to cells, a system was developed that used the bottoms of small glass tubes to provide wells for growing the cell cultures (Gwaltney, 1966). Rhinovirus serotyping was eventually done using 10 serum pools put together in a combinatorial system and new serotypes were identified in Charlottesville (Gwaltney et al., 1968). Epidemiologic studies in the US and England lead to the discovery of many new rhinovirus serotypes, the number eventually reaching 100 (Kapikian et al., 1967, Kapikian et al., 1971, Hamparian et al., 1987).",

With the availability of viral serotyping, an earlier attempt had been made to trace the spread of individual virus types through the insurance company population. It became clear that the different strains did not typically spread among people who were working together in the same area of the office. This suggested that the employees were becoming infected at home. As a result, we turned our attention to rhinovirus spread among families of employees in their homes (Hendley et al., 1969). This work led to the finding that children were usually the first to develop rhinovirus colds in the family as a result of exposure at school. The sick child then transmitted the infection to other family members. Also, serologic findings from this study when combined with data from a study of experimentally infected volunteers revealed the levels of neutralizing antibody that were necessary to protect against infection following natural exposure (Hendley et al., 1972).",

The first evidence bearing on rhinovirus transmission came about through serendipity. While conducting an earlier study on the appearance of the nasal mucosa in infected and uninfected subjects using a dissecting microscope to view the nose, I observed that infection had accidentally spread to control subjects by way of contaminated nasal specula. This focused attention on the possible mechanisms for accidental introduction of virus directly into the nose by the types of intimate activities that take place among family members. It was discovered that cold patients with rhinovirus in their nasal secretions also frequently had virus on their fingers (Hendley et al., 1973). When these same patients sneezed or coughed onto petri dishes containing viral collecting broth which was then cultured, virus was infrequently recovered. This directed attention away from viral spread by large and small particle aerosol and to the importance of contaminated hands. We then conducted experiments in which subjects\u2019 hands were intentionally contaminated with rhinovirus, following which it was observed that virus could be efficiently transferred to the hands of other subjects by brief hand-to-hand contact. Rhinovirus on the skin of the fingers was shown to be readily transferred to the mucous membranes of the nose or the eye by means of finger contact with these sites. Rhinovirus was also found to survive well on human skin and environmental surfaces. Finally, the number of finger-to-nose and finger-to-eye contacts which occurred naturally in routine activities such as medical grand rounds and Sunday school class were recorded.",

In this work, subjects (donors) were experimentally infected with rhinovirus and then exposed to other susceptible volunteers (recipients) by one of three types of exposure. In the first type of exposure, the donors and recipients had brief hand-to-hand contact following which the donors touched their nasal and conjunctival mucosa. In the second type of exposure, recipients were exposed to donors across a small table while the donors coughed, talked loudly and sang in an effort to create a large particle aerosol. In the third type of exposure, the donors and recipients were housed continuously for 3 days in the same room, separated by a double wire partition that allowed transmission of small particle aerosols throughout the room. Eleven of 15, 1 of 12, and none of 10 recipients in the respective types of exposure became infected. These findings demonstrated that under the controlled conditions of the experiment, small and large particle aerosols were considerably less efficient in the spread of rhinovirus than exposure by the hand-contact/self-inoculation route.",

Solutions with low concentrations of elemental iodine were found to be the most effective and were able to keep hands sterile for up to 4 h (Carter et al., 1980). Using iodine hand treatment as a method of prevention, a controlled blinded contact prophylaxis study was then done in which mothers of families were instructed to use iodine to treat their hands on a regular basis when a family member was recognized as having a new cold (Hendley and Gwaltney, 1988). A control group of mothers treated their hands with a solution containing brown food dye with a small non-virucidal amount of iodine. Approximately 50 families were studied each year from 1979 through 1982. Four of 58 (7%) of mothers in the iodine hand treatment group compared to 16 of 79 (20%) of those in the placebo group developed colds after exposure to an index case of the common cold. None of 11 of the iodine treated patients compared to 5 of 16 (31%) of placebo patients became infected with the rhinovirus type that was introduced into the home by the index case. By interrupting viral transmission by treating the hands, it was demonstrated that the hand contact/self-inoculation route of rhinovirus transmission was not only feasible but occurred under natural conditions (Gwaltney et al., 1978). Thus, it appeared that accidental rhinovirus introduction into the nose could be prevented by hand washing and avoidance of finger-to-nose and finger-to-eye contact and was probably of practical value in avoiding colds.",

It was well known that rhinovirus resulted in an obvious cytopathic effect in cells in cell culture, and it was assumed that similar changes occurred in the human nasal mucosa of persons with colds, although pathogenic events in humans had received little attention. In 1970, Dr Gordon Douglas had made the important discovery that the amount of rhinovirus required to infect a human was very small. One human infectious dose 50 of rhinovirus could be as little as one tissue culture infectious dose 50 (Douglas and Couch, 1969). Another important finding to emerge from the rhinovirus challenge experiments in Charlottesville and elsewhere was that in susceptible (antibody-free) people, the nose has virtually no protection against the virus once it was deposited on the nasal mucosa. For example, in Charlottesville, an infection occurred in 95% of 243 antibody-free subjects who were challenged intranasally with rhinovirus (Gwaltney and Hayden, 1992). Of interest, only 74% of the infected subjects developed symptoms of a cold. A similar rate of inapparent infection had been observed with natural rhinovirus infection (Gwaltney, 1997).",

            "text": "As work on rhinovirus pathogenesis progressed, it was determined that the initial step of virus introduction into the nose or the eye (from where it goes down the lacrimal duct into the nose) was followed by transport of the virus to the posterior pharynx (adenoid) by the ciliary epithelium of the nasal mucus membrane (Winther et al., 1986). Dr Birgit Winther, who had joined the Charlottesville group, and Dr Niels Mygind of Copenhagen were lead investigators in this work. Infection then appeared to be initiated in the posterior pharynx in the lymphoepithelial cells which are present in the crypts of adenoidal tissue. These cells were shown to be rich in ICAM-1, the major cellular receptor for rhinovirus (Winther et al., 1997). In another experiment designed to investigate the time sequence of rhinovirus infection, production of new virus in the upper airway was shown to occur rapidly after viral inoculation into the nose with new virus being recognized within 8\u201310 h after intranasal inoculation (Harris and Gwaltney, 1996). Symptoms were also observed to begin early, within 10\u201312 h after viral inoculation. These findings indicated that to achieve optimum benefit from treatment for rhinovirus colds, dosing should be started as early as possible after the onset of symptoms is recognized by the affected person. Recent work by Dr Eurico Arruda and associates has shown that most persons can accurately determine they have contracted a cold within 16 h after the first symptoms appear (Arruda et al., 1997).",

Examination of nasal biopsies showed that it was difficult, if not impossible, to detect histologic change in nasal mucosa taken from subjects with rhinovirus colds. This finding suggested that the pathogenesis of rhinovirus colds was, in large part, associated with the activation of various inflammatory events in the immune system of infected persons. Over the past decade, the role of inflammatory mediators in the pathogenesis of rhinovirus colds has received increasing attention. The investigative approach to this problem has included the measurement of mediators in the nasal fluid of persons with colds, observations on the occurrence of the different cold symptoms in volunteers after intranasal challenge with known inflammatory compounds, and attempted blockade of symptoms in infected subjects by the use of anti-inflammatory compounds with known mechanisms of action. This work has led to the discovery of multiple inflammatory events which may have a role in rhinovirus pathogenesis (Gwaltney and Rueckert, 1997). These include the inflammatory mechanisms associated with the release of histamine, kinins, prostaglandins and interleukins, and the activity of the parasympathetic nervous system.",

The alpha adrenergic activity of oral and topical decongestants shrinks the mucosal swelling of the nasal turbinate which is the cause of nasal obstruction. First generation antihistamines work through their H1 blocking and anticholinergic activity to reduce the seromucous gland secretion that contributes to rhinorrhea and to suppress the sneeze reflex, (Gwaltney et al., 1996, Turner et al., 1997, Gwaltney and Druce, 1997) the latter effect possibly occurs at a central location (Muether and Gwaltney, 2001). Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs reduce sore throat, suppress cough, (Sperber et al., 1992, Insel, 1996, Nozhat et al., 1990, Fogari et al., 1992) and reduce systemic complaints such as malaise. The suppressive effect on cough may be due to anti-prostaglandin activity since some prostaglandins are potent stimulators of cough (Doyle et al., 1990).",

In 1978, I had been fortunate to recruit Dr Frederick Hayden to join the Charlottesville group. Dr Hayden had a particular interest in antiviral compounds to treat respiratory infections. We and others have tested several of these compounds in humans, going back to an unpublished clinical trial I conducted for SmithKline and French Laboratories with a triazinoindole compound in 1972 (Gwaltney, 1970, Hayden and Gwaltney, 1984, Hayden and Gwaltney, 1982, Turner et al., 1999). However, the results of the clinical trials have been disappointing because of the modest therapeutic effects that the antivirals have provided. For that reason and because of the recognized role of inflammatory events in the pathogenesis of rhinovirus colds, I turned my attention to cold treatments which combine an antiviral compound with one or more anti-inflammatory compounds. This approach showed promise in a proof of concept study and is currently my major interest (Gwaltney, 1992). A trial was recently completed in the rhinovirus challenge model using a combination treatment composed of intranasal interferons plus oral chlorpheniramine and ibuprofen (Gwaltney et al., submitted for publication). This combination was effective in lowering the severity of total and individual symptom scores and in reducing the amount of nasal mucus production and nasal tissue use. The short course of intranasal interferon used in the treatment avoided the nasal irritation which occurs with prolonged interferon administration.",

This shows that colds are a viral rhinosinusitis not just a viral rhinitis. In a recent follow-up study to these findings, it was shown that nose blowing propels nasal fluid from the middle meatus into the sinuses and probably accounts, at least in part, for the sinus abnormalities observed in colds (Gwaltney et al., 2000b).

It has been an exciting story to follow and a privilege to have worked in a field from its very inception to the time when it has reached maturity. This by no means implies that the story is over. Work in the field is being continued by a small but talented and dedicated group of investigators, many of whom are also personal friends. That is the advantage of a small family. These investigators are actively adding to the findings that have been reviewed here. I believe that before long, an answer can be given to that tiresome old question, \u2018Why can't you cure the common cold?\u2019 And the answer will be, \u2018we did.\u2019",

Over the last decade, it has also become clear that RSV is also an important pathogen in other age groups and our thinking about treatment and prevention needs to include the infant and young child, those with compromised cardiac, immune, and respiratory systems of any age, and the elderly. Unfortunately efforts to develop RSV vaccines have not yet been successful, and sporadic prevention of RSV disease is limited currently to RSV immune globulin or a humanized murine monoclonal antibody as prophylaxis for serious RSV disease in the premature infant and the infant with chronic lung disease. In the US, RSV causes yearly outbreaks that usually begin in late fall or winter and last until late winter or spring. These outbreaks occur as community and not regional or national outbreaks as illustrated by variation in timing of outbreaks in communities and differences in outbreaks strains between communities. RSV outbreaks are consistently associated with substantial increases in hospitalizations for bronchiolitis and pneumonia in children <1 year of age. Using national hospital discharge diagnosis data and death certificate data, we estimate that RSV is associated with 73 000\u2013126 000 bronchiolitis and pneumonia hospitalizations and 171\u2013510 deaths in children <1 year of age each year. Community RSV outbreaks also bring a risk for nosocomial outbreaks that can be of substantial concern for hospitalized persons of all ages but especially in patients with compromised immune systems. Recipients of bone marrow transplant have been reported to have mortality rates over 50% with RSV pneumonia. Molecular epidemiologic studies have demonstrated that RSV nosocomial outbreaks often result from multiple introductions of distinct strains from the community.",

A recent study using improved diagnostic methods, i.e. RT-PCR, supports the concept that RSV cause \u223c50% of amount of disease that influenza does in adult patients (Zambon et al., 2001b).

Cell culture showed an agent with slow replication in tMK cells and very poor growth in Vero and A549 cells. MDCK and CEF cells did not appear to support replication. Replication was trypsin-dependent and RSV-like cytopathic effect could be seen after 10\u201321 days of incubation. Paramyxovirus-like particles were seen on electron micrographs. No hemagglutination of turkey, chicken, or guinea pig erythrocytes could be demonstrated. As a result, the particles were screened by random priming polymerase chain reactions (PCRs) to clone and sequence the virus. Ten clones were recovered and indicated the virus to have similar genetic organization to avian pneumoviruses. Once sequencing of the first virus was complete, it was evident that the new virus was different from the avian pneumovirus. The virus would not replicate in the chickens, but did in the inoculated macaques. Two of four of the macaques had mild respiratory symptoms, predominately rhinitis. Microscopic examination of respiratory tissue found viral infection of the nose, lung, and alveoli 5 days after infection. Based on these findings, the new virus was named the hMPV.",

A collection of sera originally taken in 1958 was tested by immunofluorescence and virus neutralization assays. Antibodies were found in all the sera tested. Clinical data from samples collected prospectively during the 2000 winter season suggested that hMPV was associated with respiratory tract illness, particularly in young children and with a winter season predominance. Symptoms were similar to those caused by RSV with a range of illness from mild respiratory symptoms to severe bronchiolitis and pneumonia. Ten percent of children with a respiratory tract illness screened during this season had hMPV isolated without evidence of co-infection with other respiratory pathogens. Human MPV vRNA could not be detected in throat swabs from healthy children. Two genetic clusters of hMPV isolates were found in the Netherlands and may represent different serotypes of hMPV (clusters 99-1 and 00-1). The virus likely has a world-wide distribution and may have more significant impact in the very young and very old, in addition to patients with compromised immunity or underlying medical conditions.

The map-making methods were also applied to genetic data producing a visualization of the genetic evolution of the 200 antigens in the merged HI data table, allowing a comparison of the antigenic and genetic evolution of influenza H3.

PCR has improved the detection of virus, aided in infection control, and assisted in appropriate prescribing. Unfortunately, it is an expensive technique that has also resulted in less culturing of virus with resultant loss of the antigenic information which is available only from viable virus. Several recent studies have shown a much higher rate of detection of respiratory viruses by PCR as compared to culture (Stockton et al., 1998, Carman et al., 2000, Fan et al., 1998). Parallel testing, such as is done with multiplex methods, is more efficient for detecting respiratory viruses rather than sequential serial testing for individual viruses, and ultimately labs will be running several different multiplex tests to complete a respiratory virus screen. PCR technology also allows for quantitation of virus (van Elden et al., 2001) as well as studies of molecular epidemiology. Increased sensitivity of diagnosis is particularly important in adults who shed less virus (e.g. RSV) and early in the infection, and it may also assist in surveillance (Zambon et al., 2001b). As a result of improved surveillance and sensitivity of molecular diagnosis, it has become clear that different respiratory viruses may co-circulate and there are occasions when acute respiratory infections during peak winter seasons are caused by more than one pathogen (dual infections). The clinical implications of co-circulation are still under investigation.",

In field studies, this rapid diagnostic also performed less well than in did in the manufacturer's results (70\u201380% sensitivity vs. 40% sensitivity vs. PCR to 60% vs. culture). Taken together, these two results indicate the sensitivity limits of current technology for antigen antibody complexes. This simple method which involves detection of nucleic acid may be required to deliver the kind of sensitivity and specificity required for such tests to be truly useful for individual patient management. Along the same lines, methods to stabilize RNA, such as guanidinium in the transport media or swabs streaked onto filter paper imbedded with anti-degradation compounds, will enhance detection of viral genomes in clinical samples by PCR and enable easier and more broadly based sampling.

The term \u2018averted\u2019 was used since it was not known if the highly pathogenic A/H5N1/97 virus occurred elsewhere in the region or if viruses that may have been its precursor did, too. The last human case was recognized the day before the slaughter commenced. It is a matter of speculation whether there would have been more human cases had the poultry not been slaughtered.",

The precursor H5N1 virus from geese, i.e. Goose/Guangdong/96 (Go/Gd), acquired its replicating complex from a quail H9N2 virus, while the H6N1 virus, also from quail, provided the N gene encoding the NA with a characteristic amino acid deletion in its stalk. This information engendered a precautionary principle which enabled Hong Kong to monitor poultry in various settings in order to limit the risk of an H5N1/97-like virus reemerging or regenerating locally, not only as an economic threat to the poultry industry but, more importantly, as a potential global health threat to humans (Shortridge, 2001).",

During 1999, the H5N1 Go/Gd virus was isolated from geese and in mid-2000, it was detected in ducks. Later in 2000, the virus was found to have undergone re-assortment with an unknown avian influenza virus from waterfowl infecting ducks and geese in the wholesale market. By April 2001, five genotypes of precursor Go/Gd H5N1 were isolated from apparently healthy chickens in retail markets. On genetic grounds, it was predicted that they would be highly pathogenic for chicken, which was confirmed in experimental pathogenicity studies (R.G. Webster, personal communication). To address the impending threat, the Government's Expert Working Group met to develop unified strategies to deal with the markets, media and public relations in the event that chicken were to die in the retail markets. Indeed, in mid-May 2001, chicken infected with the Go/Gd H5N1 genotypes began to die. Soon after, the decision was made to slaughter all poultry across the SAR, except for chickens on certain farms in the New Territories over a defined age. This decision was taken to minimize the risk of the five genotypes in chicken re-assorting with the H9N2 and the H6N1 viruses present in quail in the live retail markets to produce a virulent H5N1/97-like virus. The slaughter was carried out in a phased operation, and no human case was recognized.",

            "text": "Hong Kong, then, is an influenza sentinel post for the wider region (Shortridge et al., 2001). While Hong Kong may be able to react quickly to an influenza incident, it cannot react for areas beyond its geographic confines. Based on surveillance studies on poultry, the viral genes and their hosts are still present in the immediate area and could allow a H5N1/97-like virus to reappear or, alternatively, some other re-assortant of it to appear. The five Go/Gd H5N1-like viruses of 2001 probably represent an \u2018intermediate\u2019 or \u2018transitional\u2019 virus not detected in 1997. Pre-emptive slaughter in 2001 probably prevented its progression to a virulent human pathogen beyond this hypothetical stage. Duck raising practices similar to those in southern China are carried out in many parts of East Asia, which suggests the possibility that an H5N1/97-like virus could arise elsewhere within this wide region. In chicken, an H5N1 virus could be introduced into a new setting or area under cover of the heterosubtypic immunity afforded by a previous H9N2 infection (O'Neill et al., 2001). However, while H9N2 viruses may occur in the region, the occurrence of the H5N1 Go/Gd-like virus and the H6N1 virus with the characteristic NA in poultry is unknown. Moreover, unless the H5N1 Go/Gd virus occurs beyond east Asia, it is presently hard to imagine the pathogenic form arising in other regions. The H9N2 virus in its own right is a cause for concern as the genes of its replicating complex are similar to those of the H5N1/97 virus, (Guan et al., 1999) and one lineage of the virus has already been isolated from two young children with influenza-like illness in Hong Kong (Peiris et al., 1999, Lin et al., 2000) and another from pigs imported into Hong Kong (Peiris et al., 2001). The H9N2 virus has now been recognized in poultry beyond East Asia in the Middle East, Europe, and Southern Africa and could be a cause for concern both inside and outside the epicenter (Alexander, 2001, Cameron et al., 2000).",

It is now clear that the virus can replicate successfully at 37 \u00b0C and that certain strains may grow better at body temperature, as would be found in the lungs, than at cooler temperatures found in the upper respiratory tract (Papadopoulos et al., 1999). Additionally, rhinoviruses replicate in vitro in primary bronchial epithelial cell cultures as evidenced by increasing viral titers, increasing viral RNA, new viral protein synthesis, and visible cytopathic effect (Papadopoulos et al., 2001). In clinical samples from experimentally infected volunteers, in situ hybridization of biopsy specimens detected rhinovirus genomic and replicative RNA strands at the same detection rate (50%) as found in upper respiratory tracts samples (Papadopoulos et al., 1999). Infection of these cells in vitro also causes the release of proinflammatory mediators like RANTES, (Schroth et al., 1999) IL-6, IL-8, IL-16, (Papadopoulos et al., 1999) and upregulation of cell surface markers like major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I and B7.2, (Papi et al., 2000) ICAM-1, (Papi and Johnston, 1999b\n) and VCAM-1 (Papi and Johnston, 1999a). Natural and experimental infections are also associated with evidence of inflammation as shown by increases in mucosal T cells, eosinophils, (Fraenkel et al., 1995) mucosal mast cells, macrophages, and in sputum eosinophilic cationic protein, IL-6, IL-8, (Grunberg et al., 2002) and ICAM-1 (Grunberg et al., 1997). There is also emerging evidence that leukotriene levels and the leukotriene and prostanoid synthetic enzymes 5-lipoxygenase, FLAP and cyclooxygenase (COX)-2, are elevated after rhinoviral infection and the degree of elevation correlates with severity of symptoms (Seymour et al., in press). Finally, there is evidence of cellular damage with elevated levels of sputum LDH in patients with asthma exacerbations secondary to RSV, influenza, and rhinoviruses. The degree of LDH elevation also appears to be a major predictor of length of hospital stay and therefore likely is a marker of severity of infection (Wark et al., in press).",

RSV has been of particular interest in relationship to asthmatic disease because it causes obstructive airway disease with wheezing that is clinically similar to asthma. In addition, RSV lower respiratory tract disease in infancy has been associated with childhood asthmatic disease possibly because underlying asthmatic disease predisposes to RSV disease or possibly because RSV infection predisposes to asthmatic disease. This link between RSV disease and asthma raises the possibility of parallels in the pathogenesis of the two diseases. RSV is the single most important cause of serious lower respiratory tract illness in infants and young children and causes repeated infections throughout life that can be associated with serious LRI especially in patients with compromised cardiac, respiratory or immune systems and the elderly. The similarities between the clinical and some pathogenic features of RSV and asthmatic disease suggest that lessons learned from one may provide clues to pathogenesis of the other.",

The F protein is most effective in inducing protective immunity. The G protein induces some degree of protective immunity but also appears to participate in the disease process. We have recently identified two factors that contribute to the biology of RSV infection and probably pathogenesis of disease, and both are associated with the G protein. These two factors could also participate in the pathogenesis of asthmatic disease. First, the RSV G protein contains a chemokine motif, CX3C, and the G protein has properties similar to the corresponding CX3C chemokine, fractalkine (Fkn). Second, RSV, possibly through the G protein, induces the neurokinin, substance P (SP), and induction of SP is associated with an increased inflammatory response in the lung of RSV-infected mice.",

The G protein also has functional properties similar to Fkn. It binds to the CX3C chemokine receptor, CX3CR1, as shown in binding and binding inhibition studies using 293 cells transfected with the CX3CR1 (293-CX3CR1). The percent of cells positive for G protein binding increase from \u223c15% in 293 cells to \u223c80% in 293-CX3CR1 transfected cells, and this increased binding was inhibited by G protein monoclonal antibodies, Fkn, anti-CX3CR1 antibodies, and a G protein peptide containing the CX3CR motif. G also blocked Fkn binding to 293 CX3CR1 cells. Interestingly, RSV binding to CX3CR1 facilitates infection of cells as indicated by plaque reduction assays. Since RSV also uses HBDs to infect cells, we first blocked the HBDs with heparin. Heparin gave a 66% reduction in plaques but the addition of G protein, G protein peptide with the CX3C motif (and not peptides without the CX3C motif), Fkn, or anti-CX3CR1 antibodies increased the reduction in RSV plaques to >90%. Finally, G protein, through the CX3C motif, induces leukocyte chemotaxis in a fashion similar to Fkn. We used modified Boyden chambers to study leukocyte chemotaxis and found that \u223c4-fold more cells migrated toward the G protein or Fkn than the media control. Fkn, anti-G but not anti-F protein monoclonal antibodies, and anti-CX3CR1 antibodies inhibited cell migration toward G. In addition, cloned expressed G protein that contained the CX3C motif induced leukocyte migration but G protein that lacked this motif did not induce leukocyte chemotaxis. Thus, the CX3C motif in the G protein appears to be important to the biology of RSV infection and possibly pathogenesis of disease. This region of the G protein could be important to development of both vaccines and anti-viral drugs.",

            "text": "The CX3C motif on G may also participate in asthmatic-like aspects of RSV disease as suggested by the ability of Fkn to induce SP. SP is a neurokinin that has linked to both asthmatic disease and RSV disease. SP is an 11 amino acid tachykinin that has a range of effects that include induction of vasodilation, increased vascular permeability, mucus secretion, and induction of immune and inflammatory responses. RSV infection increases levels of SP in bronchial alveolar lavage (BAL) specimens in mice and addition of SP to immune activated lymphocytes increases proliferation. When we inhibited the action of SP with anti-SP antibodies, the inflammatory response to RSV infection was decreased. This is particularly evident in studies of mice immunized with formalin-inactivated (FI) RSV vaccine. FI-RSV immunized mice mount an enhanced inflammatory response to RSV challenge. Treatment of FI-RSV-immunized mice with anti-SP antibodies blocked much of this enhanced inflammatory response as exemplified by the decrease in percent of eosinophils from \u223c30% to \u223c10% and polymorphonuclear cells from \u223c18% to <1% at 2 days post challenge in BAL samples. The ability of anti-SP antibodies to decrease the inflammatory response to RSV infection suggests that these antibodies might be useful as an adjunct to antiviral treatment. The fact that anti-viral drugs and neutralizing antibodies or monoclonal antibodies are effective at decreasing viral titer but relatively ineffective at decreasing disease, raises that possibility that a substantial proportion of RSV disease results from virus-induced immune and inflammatory responses. Steroids have been considered as a means to decrease the RSV-associated inflammatory response but steriods also delay virus clearance. We found that addition of anti-SP antibodies to treatment with an RSV neutralizing F protein antibody before 2 or 6 days after RSV challenge markedly decreased the inflammatory response and did not delay virus clearance. For example, the total number of cells was decreased \u223c2-fold within one day of administration of anti-SP antibodies. Anti-SP antibodies (or other means to block SP activity) could be an effective adjunct to anti-RSV drug or immune therapy.",

When mixed with a nine amino acid second matrix protein peptide (M2 62-91) and given intranasally, it is capable of inducing \u2018protective\u2019 cytotoxic T cells (CTL) which reduce lung virus. Unfortunately, such CTL did not ameliorate disease, and in fact made it worse.

To give a second example, we have tested anti-TNF treatment in mice with \u2018shock lung\u2019 induced by CTL or Th1 cells and the eosinophilic disease induced by Th2 cells; in either case, it was beneficial (Hussell et al., 2001).

Although data from a few studies performed mainly during influenza or RSV outbreaks demonstrated isolation of viruses from the MEE, (Yoshie, 1955, Berglund et al., 1966, Berglund et al., 1967) the overall detection rate of viruses during the 1950s and 1960s remained lower than 5%. Since the 1980s, the improved viral culture techniques and the development of viral antigen detection methods have allowed demonstration of viruses or viral antigens in approximately 20% of children with AOM (Chonmaitree and Heikkinen, 1997). In about two-thirds of cases when virus has been found in MEE, bacteria have also been isolated, indicating a mixed infection. With the use of viral culture and antigen detection methods, virus as the only pathogen in MEE has been detected in 6% of AOM cases.",

Influenza and RSV infections have been identified as major risk factors for COPD exacerbations (Walsh et al., 1999, Greenberg et al., 2000, Glezen et al., 2000, Falsey and Walsh, 2000). MHC class I-restricted CD8+ cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) activity is thought to play a major role in the recovery from influenza and RSV infections and disease (McMichael et al., 1983, McMichael, 1999).",

Peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBL) were obtained from elderly COPD subjects and a control cohort matched for sex, age and other parameters during four respiratory virus epidemic periods (1991\u20131995). Pre-season (September\u2013October), in-season (November\u2013January) and post-season (March\u2013May) PBL samples were cryopreserved and stored in liquid N2. Virological and serological tests identified a total of 33 subjects (mean age, 68\u00b12) as being infected with influenza A/H3N2, A/H1N1, influenza B or RSV. Nine of these were COPD patients while 24 were control subjects. Cells were thawed and stimulated in vitro with RSV, influenza A/Taiwan/1/86 (H1N1), A/Beijing/353/89 (H3N2) and influenza B Panama virus. The level of CD8+ CTL lysis of autologous target cells infected with RSV or influenza virus was determined in a 4-h 51chromium release assay. The levels of IFN-\u03b3 and IL-4 in CTL culture supernatants were measured using ELISA. Cryopreserved cells from 6 healthy adults (mean age, 34\u00b15 years) were included as controls during each assay run (2\u20137 different occasions). Elderly study subjects exhibited significantly lower CTL responses to influenza A/H3N2, A/H1N1, influenza B and RSV than young adult controls. CTL responses to influenza A/H1N1 and A/H3N2 viruses were somewhat higher among COPD than non-COPD individuals infected with the same viruses. Also, a slightly lower RSV-specific CTL response was displayed by subjects with COPD than normals. IFN-\u03b3, a surrogate marker for CD8+ CTL activity, and IL-4, a CTL antagonist, were produced at similar levels by COPD and normal subjects. In contrast, elderly persons produced significantly lower IFN-\u03b3 and somewhat higher levels of IL-4 compared to young persons.",

Many have hypothesized that there are environmental exposures that predispose to these conditions. Since there is an increased risk of developing schizophrenia and autism in the offspring of mothers who were exposed to viral infections during pregnancy, a study was conducted to assess the hypothesis that intranasal infection of day 9 pregnant C57Bl/6 mice to H1N1 A/NWS/33 would cause structural abnormalities in the exposed progeny. Neonatal brains from day 1, 14, 35, and 56 were analyzed for reelin, SNAP-25, neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS), and GRAP by immunohistochemistry and western blot. Brains were also microscopically reviewed for morphometric analysis and cell counts. Reelin is an extracellular protein has been described to be deficient in patients with schizophrenia, bipolar affective disorder, depression, lissencephaly, and autism. It was found in lower levels in neonatal mice of infected mothers at day 1 as compared to offspring of unexposed mothers (Fatemi, 2001, Fatemi et al., 2000b, Fatemi et al., 2000c, Fatemi et al., 2001b). SNAP-25, a presynaptic membrane protein, is decreased in the hippocampus of schizophrenic patients. In the mice, it was found to be higher at day 1 in offspring born to infected compared to uninfected mothers (Fatemi et al., 2001a). nNOS expression is abnormal in schizophrenic brains. In the neonatal mice, there was increase activity in the rostral areas of the brain at day 14 and 35 with decreased activity at day 56 in the exposed vs. unexposed mice (Fatemi et al., 2000a). GFAP, a filamentous protein of the astrocyte, is a marker of cellular injury and was found to be elevated at days 1, 14, and 35 in offspring of infected mice. Morphologically, there was thinning of the hippocampus and neocortex in day 1 exposed neonates. Pyramidal cell density increased while non-pyramidal cell density decreased at day 1, although both densities were elevated by 14 weeks in exposed brains. There was persistent pyramidal cell atrophy from birth to adulthood and evidence of macrocephaly and decreased ventricle size in adult exposed mice. Finally, there was no evidence of viral protein within the brains of the neonatal mice (Fatemi et al., in press). Whether any of these findings are specific for influenza infection of the pregnant mothers are unclear.",

This response was dramatically accentuated in the mice born to infected mothers, suggesting an abnormal dopamine system. In the converse experiment, ketamine, a glutamate receptor blocking, psychomimetic drug, which exacerbates psychotic symptoms in schizophrenic patients, was given to the mice as well. As expected, PPI in the control mice was diminished by ketamine. In the mice born to infected mothers, however, ketamine enhanced PPI, suggesting an abnormality in the glutamate transmitter pathways.

The difference in pain and tenderness between the vaccine and control groups was only statistically different at 48 and 72 h. Systemic adverse events were uncommon and more frequent in the alum-placebo arm.

A Phase I clinical trial recently was completed to evaluate infectivity, tolerability and immunogenicity of live-attenuated PIV3 and RSV candidate vaccine strains when administered simultaneously in a single intranasal dose. The cp45 strain of PIV3 was derived by Belshe and Hissom by serially passaging a human isolate at reduced temperatures, yielding a cold-adapted (ca), temperature sensitive (ts) virus with a reduced replicative capacity in the lower respiratory tract of non-human primates (Belshe and Hisson, 1982, Hall et al., 1993). Multiple mutations in N, C, M, F, HN and L proteins and in the 3\u2032N region contribute to these phenotypic changes from the wild type parent (Skiadoupolos et al., 1999). In several clinical trials, in infants as young as 1 month, the strain was well tolerated and immunogenic and, in a two dose regimen, the first dose provided protection against \u2018challenge\u2019 from the second dose, as reflected in reduced nasal viral shedding (100% shedding after first dose vs. 29% shedding after second dose) (Karron et al., 1995).",

Viral shedding patterns were followed by infectivity titrations of serial nasal washes and clinical symptoms were followed with diary cards and clinical examinations. Viral shedding of RSV 248/404 after administration in monovalent or combination formats was similar to the pattern observed in previous trials, with a mean duration of 14 days and mean peak titer of approximately 102.8\u20133.4 pfu/ml between days 8\u201310. Shedding of PIV3 cp45 after its administration alone also conformed with previous experience, with shedding over 14 days, peaking at 103.8 pfu/ml on day 7. In the combination group, however, the proportion of vaccinees who shed PIV3 cp45, the mean peak titer of shedding, and days of viral shedding all were reduced compared to the monovalent group, although only the last was significantly different. A preliminary analysis of serum immune responses to vaccination shows a similar trend, with an equal proportion of monovalent and combination subjects responding with antibody rises to RSV, while a smaller proportion of combination vaccine recipients had antibody rises to PIV3. Wild type RSV and PIV3 and other viruses circulating in the community infected some subjects, as demonstrated by antibody rises in vaccine and placebo recipients and by viral isolation, even though the trials were confined to weeks when surveillance did not detect epidemic RSV transmission. Respiratory symptoms and fever were common and similar in frequency in all groups and no LRIs or serious adverse events were observed. Contrary to previous experience with the RSV248/404 strain, one third of the recipients of monovalent vaccine developed otitis media; however, the contribution of frequent nasal washes in this trial (5 in the first week) in promoting this adverse event cannot be ruled out. Other clinical studies to evaluate the safety of PIV3 cp45 are underway, including a 392 subject study to measure the occurrence of otitis media and other safety events after vaccination; safety among wheeze-prone children; and vaccine strain transmission and stability.",

            "text": "Healthy, younger adults benefit from influenza vaccination, although in a different way than the elderly. Vaccination results in 29% relative and 5% absolute risk reduction of clinical illness and 65% reduction of serologically confirmed influenza infection. The reduction in clinical and serologic infections is greater when there is a good match with the circulating strains of influenza than with poor match (Demicheli et al., 2000). Influenza vaccination is also effective in reducing physician visits for influenza-like illness by 34\u201344%, reducing antibiotic use by 32\u201345%, and by reducing sick leave by 25% (Ahmed et al., 2001). Despite all of these benefits, the economics implications of influenza vaccination in this population have been unclear, with some individual studies finding net savings and others finding net costs (Nichol et al., 1995, Bridges et al., 2000). The reasons for these broad differences include wide variations in the observed work loss reductions seen with vaccination. Studies relying on economic modeling can provide additional insights into the economic implications of influenza vaccination among healthy adults. A cost\u2013utility analysis from the 1980's demonstrated that vaccination could be highly cost effective with costs of $260 per year of healthy life gained (YHL) for age 25\u201344 and $95 per YHL for ages 45\u201364 for influenza vaccination, expressed in 1999 dollars (Riddiough et al., 1983). A recent cost\u2013benefit analysis suggests that vaccination may be cost saving. This analysis took the societal perspective and used nationally representative estimates to accommodate year-to-year variability of influenza and vaccine effectiveness and to incorporate plausible ranges in other clinical and cost variables. The model, which used Monte Carlo simulation and included sensitivity analyses, incorporated the direct and indirect costs of the vaccine, its administration, and its side effects as well as such averted costs as doctor visits, hospitalizations, work loss avoided, reduced effectivenss avoided, and preserved future earnings. The estimated mean costs incurred per person vaccinated were $16.69 while the mean costs prevented were $30.34, resulting in a net savings of $13.66 ($0\u201328.99 5th to 95th percentiles) (Nichol, 2001).",

Recently, the NS1 protein has been identified as a virulence factor for influenza viruses. When the protein is absent, the virus is highly attenuated as the protein is responsible for interferon antagonist activity. When grown in culture systems or in Stat-1 knock-out mice, which are unable to produce interferon, the NS1 deficient influenza virus regains wild-type virulence (Garcia-Sastre et al., 1998). As a result of these findings, several influenza virus constructs were developed with truncated NS1 genes in a PR8 influenza virus. An experiment was conducted in which mice were immunized with viruses containing either wild-type or altered NS1 genes. The mice were then challenged with wild type virus 4 weeks after immunization. Mice that were challenged after immunization with mutant virus survived (Talon et al., 2000). Protection was not seen in mice immunized with low doses of a virus lacking the NS1 gene (3.3\u00d7104 pfu vs. 1\u00d7106).

Prevention of this virulent agent could best be accomplished by vaccination. A recent study was conducted to establish the utility of a novel MF59 adjuvanted vaccine. The vaccine is prepared as a MF59 oil-in-water emulsion solublized with squalene and polysorbate 80 with H5N3 surface antigen soluablized with sorbitan trioleate and citrate buffered sterile water. An observer blinded, randomized, dose-ranging study was conducted in 60 healthy young adults (Nicholson et al., 2001). Patients received 2 intramuscular doses, 3 weeks apart, of either 7.5, 15, or 30 \u03bcg HA content of the MF59 adjuvanted or plain vaccine. Microneutralisation (MN) was tested against the H5N3 A/Duck/Singapore/97, hemagglutination inhibition was tested against A/Beijing/262/97 (H1N1), A/Sydney/5/97 (H3N2) and A/Duck/Singapore/97 (H5N3), and single radial hemolysis (SRH) was tested against the A/Duck/Singapore/97 (H5N3) and A/Hong Kong/489/97 (H5N1) viruses. These studies demonstrated that HI is insensitive for the detection of H5 antibody compared to MN and SRH. MF59 adjuvanted vaccine was well tolerated and had a greater antibody response at day 21 and 42 than unadjuvanted vaccine. A follow-up study was conducted to determine the durability of response and residual immunity at 12 months and to assess the effect of a single additional H5N3 vaccination on immune responses in the primed group. The follow-up study was unblinded and the patients received the same dosage and vaccine as they received in the initial study. MF59 adjuvanted vaccine was again well tolerated. Fifteen months after receiving the first two vaccines, there was no detectable immunity by HI or MN method, although there was a small detectable residual antibody level by SRH (greatest in the 30 \u03bcg group) in the MF59 adjuvant vaccine group only. Twenty-one days after a booster dose of vaccine, there was minimal response by HI and modest by SRH in the non-adjuvanted arm. The response was far more robust in the MF59 adjuvanted arm, with a maximum geometric mean titer of 1:32 by HI and 130 mm2 by SRH to the H5N3. The SRH for H5N1 was nearly 90 mm2. The degree of response, irrespective of the method used, was higher with the booster dose at month 15 than it was after the second dose in the initial series. Finally, the number of patients who seroconverted by HI was 9/15 and 0/11 21 days after booster vaccination in the MF59 and plain vaccine groups respectively; seroconversion by SRH against H5N3 and H5N1 was 15/15 and 8/11, respectively. These two studies were able to demonstrate that the MF59 adjuvanted vaccine resulted in a greater response than the unadjuvanted vaccine and that re-vaccination at 15 months was very successful in boosting the immune response, particularly in the MF59 adjuvanted group. This data also suggests that HI responses generally underestimate the antibody response as compared to MN and SRH.",

An initial study administered this chitosan-influenza vaccine formulation to healthy adult volunteers aged from 18 to 60 years. Studies in both animals and humans indicate that the mucoadhesive properties of chitosan can enhance the bioavailability of proteins following intranasal administration. Chitosan has been shown to be safe in humans, with no nasal toxicity and no adverse effects on mucociliary clearance. The study, carried out in 1999, used the commercial subunit influenza vaccine which contained H3N2 (A/Sydney/97), H1N1 (A/Beijing/95) and influenza B (B/Yamanashi/98) antigens, and this was mixed, at two concentration levels, with 10 mg/ml of chitosan. Both full-strength (15 \u03bcg) and half strength (7.5 \u03bcg) amounts of each of the viral antigens was used in the experimental vaccine. In addition the commercial influenza vaccine, containing 15 \u03bcg of each of the viral antigens, without chitosan, was employed as a \u2018gold\u2019 standard.",

Advantage can be taken of these differences in developing clinical predictors of the specific viral etiology of respiratory infections. These predictors can be used in a number of ways. Currently, a principal one is to determine situations in which influenza antivirals should be used for treatment. At least two studies have shown that cough and fever are the most important predictors of type A and B influenza (Monto et al., 2000a, Monto and Ohmit, 1996). Of note, the degree of temperature elevation appears to increase the likelihood of influenza in addition to correlating with the time to relief of symptoms (Monto et al., 2000b). However, when the data again came from physician-based surveillance of all respiratory illness over periods of high and low influenza virus activity, the positive predictive value (PPV) of cough and fever was at most 40% (Carrat et al., 1999). In contrast, demonstration that influenza transmission was occurring in the community was a prerequisite for enrollment in studies of antiviral treatment of influenza. Thus, influenza infection frequency was higher than when the entire winter season was followed. When data from the zanamivir studies were examined, it was found that the PPV of cough and fever for influenza positivity was 79%. The higher the fever, the better the predictive value. Of note, these are also the patients who benefit most from antiviral treatment. In a Canadian study similarly conducted during a period of influenza virus transmission, the PPV of cough with fever greater than 38 \u00b0C was 87%. In part, the high PPV is a result of high prevalence of influenza infection (Boivin et al., 2000).",

            "text": "Over the past several decades, healthcare costs have increased substantially as a result of many factors including new treatments for previously untreatable conditions, new evidence to supporting broader application of existing treatments, an overall increase in the cost of treatments with greater development in areas such as biologics that are more expensive, increased intensity of treatments, quality improvement measures, and increased demand from a better educated public. These enormous growths in cost have led to renewed interest in cost containment. Increasing interest in cost containment is derived from an aging population who, as a result of anti-egalitarian trends, are paying higher co-payments for their healthcare. In addition, we observe an increasing gap between what medicines can do and what is affordable. Hand-in-hand with the increased interest has come a wider use of evidence-based medicine and technology assessment to better assess which costly interventions produce the greatest benefit. Cost containment currently focuses on price reduction, through increased competition and price controls; on demand reduction, through reimbursement limits and managed care; and on budgeting, through global healthcare budgets and, in some countries, certificates of need for drug approval.",

It is also clear that there is a specific benefit from the use of antivirals, especially the NA inhibitors. The antivirals directly reduce costs by reducing the number of follow-up consultations and antibiotics used and reduce the incidence of complications and their resultant hospitalizations. These direct costs are estimated to average $3.7 billion in Europe and $1.9 billion in the US annually. Indirectly, anti-influenza treatment can improve productivity which contributes to their cost-effectiveness. Indirect costs of influenza amount to $18 billion in Europe and $9.5 billion in the US annually. The incremental cost-effectiveness of zanamivir per symptoms-free gained day by several estimates ranges from $7.25\u201322.58 based on December 28, 2001 conversion data (Griffin et al., 2001, Mauskopf et al., 2000). Unfortunately, there are no cost-effectiveness analyses that have head-to-head comparability of different therapeutic options, and none have been done with reference to quality adjusted life years (QALYs). As a result, the UK National Institute for Clinical Excellence (NICE) initially decided not to recommend the widespread use of zanamivir in 1999. It changed its stance in 2000, recommending zanamivir for use in at-risk adults when influenza was circulating in the community and in patients who present within 36 h of onset of illness. The potential impact of this decision, if used for all 97 000\u2013487 000 at-risk individuals, would have yielded a cost of between \u00a32.3\u201311.7 million. This reversal of positions was brought about by two cost-effectiveness studies which were referenced to QALYs. In the first, conducted by NICE, estimates of \u00a338 000/QALY for all adults when influenza is circulating and \u00a39300\u201331 500/QALY for at-risk adults when influenza is circulating were based on the assessment of clinical effectiveness estimates of the drug, costs of additional physician visits, and the costs of hospitalizations (NICE Technology Appraisal No. 15). Additional evidence from the NAI3008 study in at-risk patients, that assumed a 6% reduction of mortality, from a baseline of 28/100 000 influenza infected individuals, was added to the first model and resulted in a \u00a321 000/QALY estimate.",

This pricing is based on mandated pharmacoeconomic analysis for which nearly every country has an agency that has provided economic guidelines (Celibera CIPE n 109, 1997).

At the point of licensing such drugs it is not known what the impact, if any, that resistance to NI drugs will have on treatment of infection or evolution of the virus, particularly with regard to antigenicity. As a result, the establishment of a resistance monitoring group was a component of the licensing approval of both of the clinically available NI drugs. The Neuraminidase Inhibitor Susceptibility Network (NISN) was established to fulfil this goal (Zambon and Hayden, 2001a). The NISN, which is currently funded by Roche Pharmaceuticals and GlaxoSmithKline, is composed of a core voting membership composed of the WHO collaborating centers (Alan Hay, Alan Hampson, Alexander Klimov, and Masato Toshiro) and members of the academic and public health community (Jenny McKimm-Breschkin, Robert Webster, Arnold Monto, Michelle Aymard, Catherine Macken, Frederick Hayden, and Maria Zambon) as well as observers from the sponsoring pharmaceutical companies and the World Health Organization. Currently the NISN has established a link between the WHO and the two sponsoring companies, validated assays for phenotypic resistance by comparing resistance assay performance against panels of viruses and in mixing experiments with wild type and known resistant mutants. It has also collected and analysed the NA 50% inhibitory concentration (IC50) of influenza isolates collected worldwide prior to the introduction of NI drugs, and selected isolates which are outliers on phenotypic screening for sequencing, to an attempt to correlate phenotypic and genotypic data.",

Mixing experiments comparing fluorometric and chemiluminescent NI methods indicate that the shape of the resistance curve is more dependent on the mutant than on the method used, and that similar IC50 values are obtained between different methods. To date, 1054 samples from 1995\u20131998 collected before introduction of the NIs and have been studied. Using these samples, the NISN has shown that the IC50 derived from fluorometic analysis is comparable to chemiluminescent methods. Chemiluminescence has been selected as the primary method for screening samples for resistance as it allows the highest throughput with the lowest variability.

Initial testing of the dimers, trimers, and tetramers was conducted to screen for potential drugs for further development. Screening for in vitro activity against six influenza A and four influenza B viruses revealed that some dimers were extremely potent with a median EC50 approaching 0.01 \u03bcg/ml in cell culture. Next the number of linker atoms between the two zanamivir molecules were varied and activity assessed against A/Sydney/5/97 and B/Harbin/7/95 viruses. Preliminary experiments showed that the greatest activity was found with linkers of 13\u201318 atoms with substantially lower activity for shorter linkers and evidence of reduced activity for longer linkers. For example, a dimer with a 14 carbon alkyl linker had an EC50 of 0.14 ng/ml for A/Sydney/97 and 0.32 ng/mL for B/Harbin/95 in cytopathic effect assays.",

Data was collected as part of a compassionate use program for the management of influenza outbreaks in residential long term care facilities (LTCF) for the elderly in Ontario, Canada during the 1999\u20132000 influenza season. Over 90% of the residents and staff of the facilities had received influenza vaccination in the fall of 1999. Oseltamivir was offered to residents of 10 facilities during 11 outbreaks of influenza, all due to A/Sydney/5/97 (H3N2). In five outbreaks, transmission of influenza occurred despite amantadine prophylaxis, and oseltamivir was offered to residents for treatment and prophylaxis. In the remaining six, residents were offered their choice of amantadine or oseltamivir when the outbreak was recognized. Data were collected daily or every other day on the status of the outbreak. A retrospective chart review was done to identify antibiotic use, influenza complications, hospitalizations, and deaths. Patients who developed influenza while receiving amantadine prophylaxis were offered oseltamivir 75 mg twice daily for 5 days. Ill residents who had not taken amantadine previously, were offered either amantadine (100 mg QD\u00d75 days, dose adjusted for creatinine clearance) or oseltamivir as above. All patients were comparable with regard to age, severity of illness, baseline ADL capacity, and vaccination status. There were 23 patients with influenza-like illness (few patients had culture or PCR documented influenza) who received no therapy, 60 who received amantadine more than 48 h after symptom onset, 23 who received oseltamivir more than 48 h after the onset of symptoms, 50 who received oseltamivir within 48 h, and 14 who had symptom onset while receiving oseltamivir prophylaxis and who continued on oseltamivir therapy. Patients who started oseltamivir less than 48 h after the onset of symptoms or were on oseltamivir prophylaxis had significantly few complications, hospitalizations, and deaths relative to those who received no therapy, amantadine or delayed oseltamivir. Fewer antibiotics were prescribed for those residents who received early, specific influenza therapy (Table 2\n). Oseltamivir was well tolerated; overall 3 of 87 residents had adverse events (one each with confusion, dizziness, and headache). Treatment of influenza with antivirals during outbreaks in LTCFs is associated with a reduced rate of antibiotic use.

A cost-effectiveness model was developed to examine the cost and outcomes of a management strategy of oseltamivir PEP compared with amantadine PEP and no prophylaxis from a Canadian government perspective in a vaccinated elderly LTCF population, over 30 days. Prophylaxis was initiated following a confirmed influenza A outbreak in the LTCF. Events modeled were drug related adverse events, emergence of ILI while on prophylaxis, use of antibiotics, ILI complications, all cause mortality and resistance to amantadine. We estimated that 40% (31\u201364%) of LTCF to would have an influenza A outbreak and in those facilities, 17% (2\u201343%) of patients would develop ILI without prophylaxis. Without prophylaxis, 20% (17\u201348%) of patients with ILI develop a serious complication and 11% (2\u201322%) die. Probabilities were determined from randomized controlled trials and observational studies. Based on the available literature, in LTCFs without identified amantadine resistance, amantadine PEP reduced the risk of developing ILI by 60% and oseltamivir PEP by 63%. Costs for drugs, labs, physician visits, and acute hospital days were included based on Canadian government sources and published literature. We assumed all patients receiving amantadine had dose adjustment according to creatinine clearance at a cost of $16.52 (2002 CDN) per patient for laboratory studies, but the cost of pharmacist and nursing time for dose calculation was not included. Results showed that compared to no prophylaxis, oseltamivir saved $3357 per 100 patients and prevented 4.2 ILI cases per 100 patients. Compared to amantadine, oseltamivir saved $1348 per 100 patients and prevented 1.4 ILI cases per 100 patients. The cost of amantadine dose adjustment was a significant cost in the amantadine PEP strategy. Compared to no prophylaxis in this analysis, PEP strategies save overall health care costs despite additional drug acquisition cost. Based on these results, prophylaxis with oseltamivir is a cost-effective influenza prevention strategy in the LTCF environment.",

Prophylactic intranasal zanamivir in adults infected experimentally with influenza is effective in preventing an abnormal tympanogram (15 vs. 61% of placebo treated patients) (Walker et al., 1997).

Influenza vaccination in children enrolled in daycare appears to reduce the diagnosis of AOM by 33\u201336% (Heikkinen et al., 1991a, Clements et al., 1995a). Oseltamivir treatment of influenza in children 1\u201312 years of age appears to be able to reduce the risk of AOM by 40% during the first 28 days of illness (RR 0.60, 95% CI 0.4-0.95).

The pathogenesis of AOM in influenza could be the result of viral infection of the middle ear, infection of the eustachian tube with resultant occlusion, or infection of the nasopharynx with resultant inflammation which produces eustachian tube dysfunction.

VP14637 inhibits the early fusion event, as documented by time of drug addition studies, by interacting with a conserved pneumoviral target on the fusion protein (Zhao et al., 2000) VP14637 is highly potent against RSV-A and B strains with an EC50 of 0.0005 \u03bcM in viral CPE assays. VP14637 is specific for RSV and does not inhibit the replication of other common viral respiratory pathogens. Clinical isolates of RSV collected over the past 10 years from North America and Europe were inhibited at VP14637 concentrations of 0.0001\u20130.08 \u03bcM. It markedly inhibits both virus yields and RSV antigen expression in cell culture. The compound is also efficacious in vivo in the cotton rat model of RSV infection when delivered by small particle aerosol. Escape mutant analysis has identified the conserved fusion protein as the target for VP14637 inhibition. Initial clinical studies with VP14637 are progressing. Several other RSV fusion inhibitors are currently being developed by Wyeth-Ayerst, Janssen Pharmaceuticals, Trimeris and Bristol Meyers Squibb.",

The drug intercalates into the hydrophobic pocket of the VP1 protein and inhibits attachment and/or uncoating of the virus. The absolute bioavailability is unclear, but oral pleconaril shows dose-proportionality with increasing plasma concentrations with increasing oral dosing (Abdel-Rahman and Kearns, 1998). Ingestion with food significantly increases oral absorption compared to the fasted state. High fat meals appear to increase the C\nmax and AUC 3-fold, while non-fatty meals appear to increase levels to a lesser extent. Pharmacokinetic studies (Abdel-Rahman and Kearns, 1999, Kearns et al., 1999) have shown the drug to achieve its maximum plasma level in 3 h (range 2\u20135 h) and have a maximum concentration of 2.2\u00b10.5 \u03bcg/ml. The drug is extensively protein bound (>99%) and exhibits a large volume of distribution (60 l/kg) as the result of its high membrane permeability and lipophilic characteristics (Rhodes and Liu, 2001b). It is metabolized extensively with over 30 metabolites excreted in urine and feces. None of the metabolites appear to have significant antiviral activity. Pleconaril exhibits a bimodal elimination pattern with a short (2\u20134 h) initial T1/2 accounting for most drug and a prolonged (mean, 180 h) terminal T1/2 for the remainder. There is no significant alterations in pleconaril pharmacokinetics with increasing age or gender (Rhodes and Liu, 2001a). There are minimal interactions with the CYP450 isoenzymes in in vitro studies (Rhodes et al., 2001) and no drug interactions have been documented with theophylline (Hincks et al., 2001).",

The first two studies (Hayden et al., 2000, Hayden et al., 1999) enrolled patients over the age of 14 with at least one respiratory symptom and 1 systemic symptom who presented within 36 h of onset of VRI symptoms. As fever was allowed and colds were not specifically sought in these studies, picornavirus PCR was positive in only 42\u201343% of patients. Patients received pleconaril 400 mg TID for 7 days. The study medication was well tolerated with the most common side effects of diarrhea, nausea, abdominal pain, and headache being only slightly more common in the treated patients than the placebo group. Retrospective analysis of the picornavirus-infected enrollees (N=527) from the two phase 2 studies found that early pleconaril therapy was associated with a statistically significant reduction of illness duration, total symptoms score, number of tissues used, and percent of nights of disturbed sleep. There was a 1.5 day reduction in time to alleviation of symptoms (8.5 vs. 10 days, P=0.029). The two phase 3 studies (Hayden et al., 2001) enrolled patients (n=1052 and 1044) older than 18 years old with symptom duration of less than 24 h who felt they had a cold on the day of presentation, had moderate to severe rhinorrhea plus at least one other respiratory symptom, and did not have a fever. Patients also received pleconaril 400 mg TID for 5 days or placebo. Percentage of patients positive for picornaviruses (62\u201369%) was substantially higher in these studies. In the intent-to-treat-infected population, the aggregate median time to alleviation of illness was 1 day shorter in the treated patients (6.3 vs. 7.3 days, P<0.001) for the two studies. Improvement was noted within 24 h of starting treatment and in all monitored symptoms (rhinorrhea, cough, sore throat, nasal congestion, malaise, and myalgias). As with the first study, pleconaril was well tolerated with slightly more headache, nausea, and vomiting than placebo. Also of note, there was a small increase in total cholesterol (+5 mg/dl for pleconaril vs. \u22124 mg/dl for placebo) and platelet counts (+15\u00d7103/mm3 vs. +7\u00d7103/mm3) in the treated arm at the end of treatment compared to baseline.",

The introduction of novel strains of influenza from the region around Hong Kong are concerning and may result in a future pandemic. Influenza vaccine has been proven to be cost-effective in most patient populations. Several studies how shown that respiratory viral infections can be differentiated by clinical presentation and that rapid diagnostic tests are aiding in the diagnostic process. Respiratory viruses have clearly been implicated in the pathogenesis and frequency of AOM. The hMPV has recently been discovered and appears to be a common pathogen in man.
