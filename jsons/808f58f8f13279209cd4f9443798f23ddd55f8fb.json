This disease is rapidly transmitting to more than 200 countries, and has become a pandemic. Geographically, Hong Kong is located proximally to Wuhan-the epicenter. With the rapid transmission of the COVID-19, Hong Kong has been confronted by the increasing number of confirmed and suspected cases daily, now exceeding 1,000 at the time of reporting. Hong Kong people are beyond doubt in a state of anxiety, fear and helplessness. The latest evidence indicates that face mask helps prevent the transmission of human coronaviruses and influenza viruses from symptomatic individuals [1] and thus, an increasing number of healthcare authorities have recommended the use of face mask in public spheres for self-protection and others [1] [2] [3] . Consequently, Hong Kong people started a mass surge of surgical masks locally and nationally. This gives a golden opportunity to thousands of fake masks and protective gears flocking in markets ever since the pandemic [4, 5] . However, there is rare empirical data to unfold this condition regarding severity and prevalence.",

Illegal fake mask and protective gears manufacturing may disrupt the infection prevention and control towards the COVID-19 outbreak in clinical and community settings. Failure to curb the rapid disease transmission may transform the infectious pandemic into a new hybrid disaster (natural and man-made events). Thus, there is a pressing need for the Food and Drugs Authority (FDA) to impose stringent guidelines on proper face mask production, materials to be used, quality control, commodity labelling, distribution and recommended price range. Local and international governing bodies should strictly enact and enforce legal guidelines to forbid fake mask/ protective gears manufacturing with a serious penalty to deter those profiteers. The local government should educate the general public to distinguish between good quality masks with those fake face masks via social media. Vulnerable subpopulation should also have heightened awareness to counterfeit / face masks to avoid falling into the profiteers' net.",
