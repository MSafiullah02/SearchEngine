            "text": "Heart transplantation has revolutionized the outcome of patients with terminal chronic heart failure. Worldwide, about 5,000 heart transplantations are performed annually (Stehlik et al. 2011) . Survival after heart transplant is continuously increasing due to advances in drug-induced immunosuppression, improvement of surgical procedures, optimal pretransplant risk assessment, and close patient monitoring (Stehlik et al. 2011; Gavalda et al. 2014a ). Soon after the first heart transplantations were performed in the late 1960s, infection appeared to be a major complication and a significant cause of mortality. Indeed, infectious events are responsible for 30 % of deaths, with a significant weight between 30 days and 1 year posttransplant (Stehlik et al. 2011) . Beyond morbidity and mortality, infectious complications are also associated with a high economic burden due to higher length of hospital stay, increased graft losses, and costs related to indirect effects such as virus-induced malignancies (Gavalda et al. 2014a; Menzin et al. 2011) . Beyond this direct burden, microorganisms are also involved in indirect transplant-related complications. For instance, it has been repeatedly shown that the \"microbially determined immune modulation (MDIM)\" could increase the risk of allograft injury or rejection, atherogenesis, malignancies (such as PTLD), and other opportunistic pathogens (Gavalda et al. 2014a ). Therefore, preventive measures are cornerstone for the management of heart-transplanted patients (Fishman 2014) .",

Therefore, a high number of bacterial, viral, fungal, and parasitic agents may be causative in heart transplant recipients. Second, the use of immunosuppressive agents may modify the clinical presentations associated with infectious events (Fishman 2014) .

Among these infections should be included surgical site and wound infections and catheter-related or urinary tract infections. The frequent use of antibiotics before or after surgery increases the risk of C. difficile-associated diarrhea (Fishman 2014) . Lastly, donor-derived infections can be revealed early after heart transplantation if donor had an active viral, bacterial, or fungal infection or in case of graft contamination (Fishman 2014; Wright and Fishman 2014 ). \u2022 Between 1 and 6 months, co-trimoxazole prophylaxis significantly reduces the risk of major opportunistic infections such as P. jirovecii pneumonia, T. gondii encephalitis, or listeriosis and may also reduce the risk of urinary tract infections. Most of febrile episodes are caused by viruses and graft rejection at that time (Fishman 2014) . Depending on the level of immunosuppression, a broad spectrum of pathogens can occur such as Aspergillus spp., Cryptococcus spp., or Nocardia spp. \u2022 More than 6 months after transplantation, drug-induced immunosuppression is tapered for most of patients. Thus, opportunistic pathogens are less common (Fishman 2014) .

Of note, noninfectious causes such as metabolic disorders, drug-induced side effects, and primary brain lymphoma should be considered. Early CNS infections (during phase 1) are rare, unless the patient experiences a massive microbial exposure or exhibits an anatomic underlying factor (Wright and Fishman 2014) . Furthermore, donor-derived infections may occur in this time period, such as lymphocytic choriomeningitis, West Nile virus or herpes simplex virus (HSV) encephalitis, or, in case of graft contamination, cryptococcosis, even if the latter case is rare. CNS opportunistic infections mainly occur during phases 2 and 3. Fungal infections (Aspergillus, C. neoformans, Histoplasma, Coccidioides), nocardiosis, toxoplasmosis (if the chosen prophylaxis is not active against T. gondii), and tuberculosis should be considered (Wright and Fishman 2014; Lebeaux et al. 2014a ). Viral infections are also possible at that phase (such as HSV or VZV encephalitis). After 6 months, even if the patient may experience infection caused by community-acquired pathogens (S. pneumoniae), the risk of opportunistic pathogens can be increased as prophylaxis is usually interrupted at that stage: herpesviruses, nocardiosis, invasive molds, tuberculosis, and cryptococcosis can be encountered.",

Due to the strong impact of CMV infection on clinical outcomes, a preventive strategy should be used for both CMV-positive recipients (R+) and CMVnegative recipients with a positive donor (D+/R-). Two preventive strategies are currently available: universal prophylaxis (i.e., administration of antiviral therapy in the first months after transplantation) and preemptive therapy (i.e., repeated realizations of laboratory assays such as (ideally) quantitative nucleic acid amplification testing or pp65 antigenemia \u00b1 administration of antiviral therapy once an early viral replication has been diagnosed). Their roles are summarized in Table 19 .3. If universal prophylaxis is selected, routine viral load monitoring should not be encouraged in asymptomatic patients as this strategy is not cost-benefit. For CMV prophylaxis, oral valganciclovir (900 mg once daily) and intravenous ganciclovir (5 mg/kg once daily) have proven their efficacy. Both valganciclovir and ganciclovir dosages should be adjusted to renal function.

Mainly because of poor interhospital correlation of PCR assays until the recent creation of an international World Health Organization (WHO) standard, no consensual cutoff value has been determined to initiate antiviral therapy in patients with isolated replication without identified disease. While a low threshold should most likely be used in D+/R-couples to initiate antiviral therapy and prevent direct and indirect effects of CMV infection, it is unclear when to initiate therapy in CMV seropositive heart transplant recipients. Kinetics of DNAemia may offer additional information. The role of CMV detection by PCR in bronchoalveolar lavage is still a matter of debate.

A common illustration is that of digestive CMV disease which may be seen with undetectable or low viral load values in blood samples.",

In seropositive transplant patients, herpes zoster (also known as shingles or zona) may present as dermatomal herpes zoster or as varicella-like skin lesions. In most cases, a clinical diagnosis can be made. Contact with infected subjects may be a clue to diagnosis. Unlike CMV, asymptomatic replication is not observed after solid organ transplantation. As a consequence, identification of VZV (e.g., by PCR) from lesions or plasma is a highly valuable tool. Aggressive therapy is needed once the diagnosis of VZV disease has been made in an immunocompromised patient. Intravenous aciclovir should be used at a dose of 10 mg/kg every 8 h.

After transplantation, the use of immunosuppressive agents imbalance the relation established between EBV-infected B-cells and the host's cytotoxic T lymphocyte response. As a consequence, it may lead to a wide range of presentations ranging from asymptomatic viremia to posttransplantation lymphoproliferative disorder (PTLD). EBV serological testing should be realized for risk stratification before transplant for both donor and recipient. EBV-negative recipients of EBV-positive heart transplants (D+/ R-) have the highest risk of PTLD. In this highrisk population, EBV-positive PTLD typically occurs within 1 year after transplantation. Because increased EBV viral load is linked to aberrant EBV-induced B-cell proliferation, the question of viral load monitoring is of interest. However, such strategies of monitoring are imperfectly correlated with the risk of developing EBV-positive PTLD, especially due to a lowpositive predictive value. Moreover, this tool has no utility for predicting EBV-negative PTLD. In patients who are at high risk for PTLD (such as EBV D+/R\u2212 patients and/or recipients with chronic EBV viremia), preemptive reduction in immune suppression appears to be an effective first-line strategy. The role of adjunctive therapies such as rituximab is an ongoing debate in solid organ transplant recipients. Apart from PTLD, uncommon events such as infections of the central nervous system and aplastic anemia have been associated with EBV in transplant recipients.",

            "text": "Toxoplasmosis This life-threatening opportunistic infection is caused by T. gondii, a parasite able to encyst in several organs, such as the heart. In transplant recipients, toxoplasmosis can result from the transmission of the parasite with the graft (D+) to a seronegative recipient (R-) or from a reactivation of a pretransplant latent infection in a seropositive recipient (R+) (Derouin et al. 2008) . In the first case, clinical signs usually occur in the first 3 months after heart transplantation (sometimes earlier, within 2 weeks) with febrile myocarditis, encephalitis, or pneumonia. Without prophylaxis, incidence of disseminated toxoplasmosis in case of mismatch (D+/R-) may reach 75 %, but trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole prophylaxis efficiently prevents this complication. The second option (reactivation of a latent infection R+ patient) is less frequent. Even if serological reactivation (defined by a rise in IgG antibody titers, with a high avidity index) occurs in \u22485 % of R+ patients, a clinical toxoplasmosis is exceptional (Derouin et al. 2008) . The diagnosis of disseminated toxoplasmosis relies on the identification of the parasite or its DNA (through PCR testing) in any involved organ or in the blood. Serologic diagnostic might be useful but does not have enough sensitivity or specificity. Even if trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole is highly effective in preventing toxoplasmosis, the risk might appear after cessation of the drug or if it is replaced by aerosolized pentamidine prophylaxis against PcP. Beside trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, pyrimethamine alone or atovaquone can also be used as prophylaxis.",

Strongyloides can complete an entire life cycle through an autoinfection pattern, allowing a prolonged survival within the host, up to several decades (Roxby et al. 2009 ). The immunodepression induced after transplantation may lead to hyperinfection, through a massive increase in the reproductive cycle of the larvae (Roxby et al. 2009 ). After a proliferation step in the duodenum, larvae may reach the bloodstream, the lungs, and then the gut. Thus, hyperinfection syndrome usually associates respiratory symptoms leading to acute respiratory distress syndrome, gastrointestinal symptoms (from abdominal pain to gastrointestinal bleedings or occlusion), and neurological involvement. A frequent complication is the occurrence of a bloodstream coinfection or meningitis cause by Gram-negative enteric bacteria. Due to its severity, hyperinfection syndrome should be prevented in patients awaiting heart transplantation who lived or stayed in area of endemicity (South America, Africa, Southeast Asia), even decades ago. The prevention relies on the treatment of chronic intestinal strongyloidosis with ivermectin before starting chemical immunosuppression (Roxby et al. 2009 ).",

Nocardiosis is a rare opportunistic infection caused by Nocardia spp., an ubiquitous aerobic actinomycete that is commonly found in a wide range of environments such as decaying vegetation, soil, and water. In recent reports, incidence after heart transplantation ranges between 0.65 and 2.5 % (Lebeaux et al. 2014a) . Nocardiosis during the first month after SOT is uncommon and about 2/3 of cases occur during the first year after transplantation. Main risk factors are high-dose corticosteroids, cytomegalovirus (CMV) disease in the preceding 6 months, and a high median calcineurin inhibitor serum level in the preceding 30 days. Invasive nocardiosis accounts for 80-90 % of cases and is caused by bacterial inhalation, therefore leading to pneumonia in most cases. CT scan discloses lung infiltrates with consolidation ( Fig. 19.7) , nodules, excavations, or pleural effusion. Bacteria may then reach the bloodstream and disseminate to all organs: the CNS (with brain abscess), skin, soft tissue, eyes, liver, bone, heart valve, joint, muscle, and testis ( Fig. 19.7) . Overall mortality is \u224830 % but may reach 50 % in case of brain abscess. Strikingly, coinfections are possible with viral, bacterial, or fungal pathogens and are associated with a worst outcome. Primary cutaneous or subcutaneous nocardiosis is also possible in case of direct bacterial inoculation after a penetrating skin trauma. First-line treatment relies on trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, amikacin, third-generation cephalosporin, imipenem, or linezolid, depending on initial severity and dissemination (Lebeaux et al. 2014a ). To reduce the risk of relapse, treatment is usually administered for 6 months in case of lung infection or 12 months in case of brain abscess.",

An extensive clinical and radiological work-up is mandatory due to diagnostic pitfalls in these patients. \u2022 Early infections (within 4 weeks) after heart transplantation suggest surgical site and wound infections or grafttransmitted disease. \u2022 Clinical and radiological aspects have low predictive values to predict the causative microbial pathogen involved. Bronchoalveolar lavage and biopsy of any involved organ play an important role due to the broad spectrum of causative pathogens. \u2022 Antimicrobial resistance is a matter of concern in heart transplant recipients. Useless antimicrobial therapies should be avoided, and catheters and other devices should be removed when no longer essential.

As a consequence, all transplant candidates and living donors should ideally be screened for latent tuberculosis with a tuberculin skin test (lecture at 48-72 h, positive if induration \u22655 mm). However, due to a reduced sensitivity and false positiveness of tuberculin skin test after vaccination, interferon gamma release assay (IGRA) should be done when possible, independently of the tuberculin skin test result. In case of positive tuberculin skin test or IGRA test, active TB should be investigated. Active TB can be confirmed only by culturing M. tuberculosis or detecting nucleic acid sequence from a clinical specimen. In case of lung infection, if sputum is negative, BAL, transbronchial biopsy, or mediastinoscopy should be considered. For extrapulmonary TB, any involved site might be sampled",
