Cerebellar ataxia is caused by a disruption in transmission of sensory impulses from the vestibular system, cerebral cortex, and spinal cord via the cerebellum. Because the cerebellum does not initiate motor activity but rather coordinates it, affected patients will demonstrate abnormal rate, range, or force of movement with intact strength. Paresis is not present with cerebellar dysfunction. Vestibular ataxia occurs when damage or disease affects the vestibular system within the inner ear. Motor activity is not initiated but is refined and coordinated via the vestibular system by controlling muscles used to maintain head position, eye movement, and equilibrium. Dysfunction results in loss of balance; animals often list or fall to one side and may have head tilt. Proprioceptive ataxia is caused by spinal disease, which will result in proprioceptive deficits that can be localized to the affected region of the spinal column. Trauma, intervertebral disk disease, and tumors arising within or compressing the spinal cord or nerves should be considered.35\n",

Other potential causes of seizures include toxin ingestion; CNS infection, inflammation, trauma, or neoplasia; and metabolic disturbances such as hepatic or renal failure.

Depending on location, these tumors may be amenable to surgical resection; however, the one reported case of recurrence and metastasis of a chordoma in a ferret was that of a cervical chordoma that had been surgically excised.51 In the tail, chordomas appear as lobulated, firm, nonencapsulated, ulcerated masses at or near the last caudal vertebra.

Confirm the diagnosis antemortem with skeletal muscle biopsy from a hind limb. For necropsy diagnosis, be sure to include esophageal samples among those to be examined histologically. Treatment is often unrewarding, although some authors have reported success with aggressive supportive care along with the use of immunosuppressive doses of prednisolone (1 mg/kg PO q12h for 3 months or longer) and cyclophosphamide (10 mg/kg on days 1 and 14, then every 4 weeks for 3 months or longer) along with chloramphenicol (50 mg/kg PO q12h for 6-8 weeks). Aggressive supportive care can be prolonged (several weeks) and must include fluid therapy and nutritional supplementation; it should also include GI protectants and fever control.40 The author (NA) has treated some ferrets successfully with this protocol.",

The clinical presentation included episodic hind limb weakness, flaccid paraparesis that progressed to tetraparesis, and mild megaesophagus. Diagnosis was made by nerve conduction velocity, which was diminished in the hind limbs; positive serologic testing for antiacetylcholine receptor antibodies; and response to neostigmine methylsulfate. Response to edrophonium hydrochloride can also be used in diagnostic testing. Treatment with pyridostigmine bromine (1 mg/kg PO q12h) initially produced a return to normal, but clinical signs progressed within 1 month, leading to euthanasia.6 Prednisolone at immunosuppressive doses is commonly used concurrently with pyridostigmine bromine in the treatment of myasthenia gravis and should be considered in the treatment of this disease.
