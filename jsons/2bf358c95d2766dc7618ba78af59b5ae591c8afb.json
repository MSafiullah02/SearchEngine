            "text": "Anecdotally, cryptosporidiosis seems to be becoming more commonly seen as a cause of diarrhoea in calves. However substantiating this with hard fact is difficult. The VIDA figures (which are based on samples submitted to the SAC and the VLA) show that the actual number of diagnoses has fallen over the last decade with 1746 diagnoses of cryptosporidiosis in 1995 and only 1232 in 2006. Some of this reduction may be due to the fall in submissions to the veterinary laboratories over this period. However if this is taken into account there appears to have been no real change in the percentage of digestive disease in cattle caused by cryptosporidiosis over the period between 1995 and 2006. The number of cryptosporidiosis diagnoses as a percentage of all submissions for digestive diseases has varied between 4.5 and 6% over that period. Nevertheless, the relative importance of cryptosporidiosis compared to the other major causes of calf scour, coccidiosis, E. coli K99, coronavirus and rotavirus does appear to have increased over that period (Fig. 1) . In both 2005 and 2006, cryptosporidiosis was the most commonly diagnosed cause of diarrhoea in calves. The VIDA data show a significant seasonality in the increase in isolations in the period from of March to May (Fig. 2 ).",

It has been shown that there is an increased predilection for cells in mitosis due to the dependence of the organism on host cell metabolites. Unusually the sporozoites develop intracellularly but extracytoplasmically into Type 1 meronts, which in turn produce 6-8 merozoites. These invade other epithelial cells and proliferate rapidly through several cycles of asexual reproduction. With the production of type 2 meronts, containing 4 merozoites, gametocytes (macrogametes and microgametes) are generated during the sexual stage completing the lifecycle by the production of oocysts. Not all the oocysts are shed in the faeces. 20% of the oocysts produced are thin-walled oocysts, which encyst in the gut lumen to release sporozoites, which directly reinfect the host. This autoinfection is an important part of the lifecycle and is one of the main differences from coccidiosis.",

Infection with one agent may not in itself cause sufficient damage to cause scouring. This is also important for control and prevention. Controlling one pathogen effectively may prevent clinical disease even when two or more pathogens are involved.
