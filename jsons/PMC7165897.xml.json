This region, known locally as the altiplano or puna, with its salt flats, dried lakes, paleosols, glacial deposits, and archaeological sites, provides a number of crucial archives from which to tease out this complex interrelationship. Paleoenvironmental studies performed on several puna wetland areas have stimulated debate on climatic variability during this period. Some suggest that middle Holocene environmental conditions were dry, changing to more humid conditions\u2014similar to those of modern times\u2014toward the late Holocene (e.g., Veit, 1996; Grosjean et al., 1997, 2003, 2007; Valero\u2010Garc\u00e9s et al., 2000; Abbott et al., 2003; Tapia et al., 2003; Morales, 2011; Tchilinguirian & Morales, 2013). Contrariwise, others have noted a predominance of humid environmental conditions during the middle Holocene before a drier spell during the late Holocene (e.g., Betancourt et al., 2000; Latorre et al., 2002). These disparities may relate to local geography (e.g., latitude, longitude and altitude), resolution scales, sensitivity of the analyzed proxy, chronological problems (e.g., 14C reservoir effect; see Geyh et al., 1999), differential preservation, and, finally, environmental heterogeneity and its complexity in relation to climate (Garreaud & Aceituno, 2001; Grosjean et al., 2003). Consequently, the chronology, intensity, and duration of these environmental shifts in different parts of the Andean highlands of northern Chile, northern Argentina, southern Peru, and southern Bolivia highlight a more complex paleoenvironmental picture, and therefore the need to generate regional and local environmental models (Grosjean, 2001; Yacobaccio & Morales, 2005; Nu\u00f1ez, Cartajena, & Grosjean, 2013; Tchilinguirian & Morales, 2013).",

            "text": "Middle\u2010to\u2010late Holocene climate change influenced human settlement, adaptation, and culture change in the south\u2010central Andes. Archaeological research on middle Holocene sites associated with puna wetlands indicates a series of highly complex social responses to existing environmental conditions. For instance, in the Salar de Atacama, the extreme aridity postulated for this area during the middle\u2013to\u2010late Holocene transition would have provoked a decline and/or hiatus in human occupation, a period traditionally referred to as the \u201carchaeological silence\u201d (N\u00fa\u00f1ez, Cartajena, & Grosjean, 2013). However, patches/enclaves with more stable hydrological resources persisted during this time in places, such as the Puripica Gorge (Chile) or in Susques (Argentina). These areas served as ecological refugia exploited by hunter\u2010gatherers, providing localized higher floral and faunal concentrations within the broader desert environment (Yacobaccio & Morales, 2005; N\u00fa\u00f1ez, Cartajena, & Grosjean, 2013). In time, the intensive management of some of these enclaves engendered significant cultural change associated with increased social complexity, in effect laying the basis for the transition from hunter\u2010gatherer to agropastoral societies in the late Holocene (Grosjean et al., 1997; Nu\u00f1ez, Grosjean, & Cartajena, 2010). Thus, a thorough understanding concerning the development of these varied socioeconomic changes during the middle Holocene and transition to the late Holocene requires a detailed study of the cultural processes involved and the environmental history that underlies specific areas. Taking an interdisciplinary perspective, here we focus on a combination of paleoenvironmental and archaeological data to elucidate the impact of local environmental changes on hunter\u2010gatherer procurement strategies and their transition to food\u2010producing societies in Antofagasta de la Sierra (southern argentine puna), during ca. 7000\u20133000 cal. yr B.P.",

Our reconstruction of streamflow history for these two rivers is based on cross\u2010correlations between geomorphological, sedimentological, and diatomological proxy data. We focus on these two rivers given that there has been intense archaeological research in this area. This past research shows that archaeological sites dating to the period addressed here are mainly associated with the paleowetlands of these two rivers. Additionally, other archaeological data, such as rock art (Aschero, 2010) and lithic assemblages (Hocsman, 2014), reveal cultural differences between the human occupations along these two rivers. We believe that a comparative analysis combining paleohydrology and archaeological evidence from these two river basins is relevant to our understanding the role of extreme, for example, arid and high altitude, environments in the process of sociocultural change.",

The Miriguaca and Las Pitas river basins lack evidence of glacial action. However, the upper reaches of the basins contain certain periglacial features such as debris flow and solifluction lobes that cover the side slopes. Also, the flood plains of both rivers above 4800 m asl contain wetlands with soil mounds resulting from soil frost and riparian flora. Along the middle reaches of the two basins (4800\u20134000 m asl), the rivers have downcut into the ignimbrite plateau forming canyons 80\u2013120 m deep with sheer vertical sides susceptible to rockslides. Finally, along the lower reaches (4000\u20133200 m asl), both rivers end in broad valleys inset 20\u201330 m into Pleistocene conglomerates that form a veneer over pediments. Five Late Pleistocene to Holocene fluvial terraces are evident along both rivers, along with an active flood plain occupied by wetlands (vegas).",

            "text": "Despite the arid environment, both rivers are permanent due to greater precipitation in the higher parts of their basins. Orographic precipitation infiltrates into fractured volcanic rocks located above 4500 m asl and supports baseflow. The high elevation watershed for the Las Pitas River covers an area of ca. 100 km2 and contains a greater number of springs compared to the Miriguaca River, whose high elevation watershed is restricted to ca. 60 km2 (Figure 1). Variations in upland seasonal flooding is minimal, and water tables lie less than 0.5 m from the surface, allowing for the development of organic soils and riparian vegetation (cushion peat land) (Squeo et al, 2006). Streamflow slightly increases during the winter due to lower atmospheric temperatures and reduced evapotranspiration rates (Salminci, Tchilinguirian, & Lane, 2014). Seasonal streamflow variability increases in the lower basin, probably as a consequence of water loss due to infiltration and higher evapotranspiration rates compared to the higher basin. Furthermore, irrigation activities are another factor reducing streamflow in the lower basin (Tchilinguirian, 2009).",

Human occupation in the area began during the early Holocene (Figure 2) with hunter\u2010gatherer settlement recorded in the lower stratigraphic level of the Pe\u00f1as de las Trampas site that dates to ca. 10,190 cal. yr B.P. (Martinez, 2014). During the period between 8000\u20134000 cal. yr B.P., we have evidence in the Southern Andes highlands for sporadic occupation of hunter\u2010gatherer sites. In some areas, such as northern Chile and Argentina, the evidence suggests that certain areas that had been occupied during the early Holocene were abandoned (N\u00fa\u00f1ez et al., 1999). However, the archaeology from Antofagasta de la Sierra shows greater habitation stability during this period (Mondini et al., 2013). In fact, between ca. 8500 and 6000 cal. yr B.P. there is evidence of considerable residential activity in areas above 3600 m asl that had high potential resource productivity (Mondini et al., 2013). These hunter\u2010gatherer groups undertook mobility strategies that entailed regular visits to certain sites where they engaged in the intensive exploitation of guanaco (Lama guanicoe) and vicu\u00f1a (Vicugna vicugna), thereby maximizing use of wild resources (Aschero and Martinez, 2001).",

This transition is characterized by a progressive reduction in residential mobility framed within increasing sedentism (Hocsman, 2002, 2006; Aschero & Hocsman, 2011). Crucially, important socioeconomic changes occur during this period such as the domestication of camelids as evidenced by osteometric changes (Aschero, Izeta, & Hocsman, 2014; Grant Lett\u2010Brown, 2014; Urquiza & Aschero, 2014), and the use of a large variety of domesticated plants such as Chenopodium sp. aff. quinoa, Oxalis tuberosa, Solanum tuberosum, and Zea mays (Babot, 2011).",

We interpret these as fill terraces (sensu Bull, 1991) formed by episodic downcutting and backfilling. Terrace VI contains alluvial gravels and sands with peats interbedded with diatomaceous silts. The peats date to between 6730 and 3500 cal. yr B.P. along the Las Pitas River, and ca. 6630 to 1400 cal. yr B.P. along the Miriguaca River (see below). Closer to the modern river channels are unpaired Terraces VI, VII, and VIII. Terraces VII and VIII are located 2 and 1 m above the channel, respectively, and composed of sands and gravel that post\u2010date 1400 cal. yr B.P.

Both the Las Pitas and Miriguaca Rivers share some geomorphic attributes, for example, their flood plains have shallow hydrogeological basements (<10 m) and Quaternary gravel substrates. Likewise, the stream valleys have similar stream gradients and lithologies and lack visible evidence of neotectonics or dams caused by tributary Holocene debris flows. The main difference between these two river basins lie in the size of their high altitude catchment areas: the Las Pitas River has a high altitude catchment, that is, 20% larger and has more springs providing for greater baseflow (Figure 1). There are also local differences between the Las Pitas River and Miriguaca stratigraphic localities. Although both localities are downstream from major tributaries within their hydrological basins, the Las Pitas River locality is situated within a bedrock canyon with a more confined flood plain compared to the Miriguaca River locality, the latter located on the piedmont (Figures 3 and 4). Geomorphic differences between these two closely spaced rivers are likely to result in somewhat different fluvial responses to possible climatic forcing.",

Beginning at ca. 6700 cal. yr B.P., periodic debris flows separated by episodes of marsh formation are recorded. Major sedimentary facies (FA1, FA2, and to a lesser degree FA3) and diatom evidence indicate a fluvial system with more stable paleohydrological conditions as compared to the Miriguaca River. Las Pitas streamflow during this phase is associated with thick gravel layers, suggesting a higher streamflow capacity than the Miriguaca River. On the other hand, the large dominance of adnate diatom taxa also depicts a riparian zone with strong abrasion events generated by rapid water velocities. These taxa produce and grow on large quantities of mucilage and are highly resistant to fluvial abrasion (Hill, 1996).

The beginning of this more humid phase is diachronic. Along the Las Pitas River, it starts after ca. 4890 cal. yr B.P. with the deposition of extensive lenses associated with Facies FA3. As opposed to the previous phase, PII is represented by laminated deposits with abundant diatoms and organic matter that alternate with bar and swale stratified gravels. These gravels are thicker and more laterally extensive than in the previous PI. Common red iron mottles in alluvial sands and gravels indicate a shallow phreatic table favoring localized pools (2\u201310 m2) with greater organic and diatom sedimentation. Diatoms assemblages indicate areas marginal to the channel that are susceptible to frequent inundation (B2P). Toward ca. 4800 cal. yr B.P., deposits suggest greater surface stability, possibly vegetated (B3P), and later dominated by tychoplanktonic species, indicating rising water table levels and more humidity (B4P) until ca. 3800 cal. yr B.P. Diatom composition coincides with facies interpreted as high\u2010energy channels across the flood plain, but with areas of high biological productivity (FA4 and FA3). Increases in effective moisture are also recorded between ca. 4270 cal. yr B.P. and 4100 cal. yr B.P. at Laguna Colorada, representing short pulses of moisture during an otherwise arid period in Antofagasta de la Sierra (Tchilinguirian, 2009; Grana, 2013). Finally, after 3600 cal. yr B.P., the Las Pitas River downcuts and creates a 5 m deep incised channel, resulting in a drop of the local base level (Tchilinguirian, 2009).",

The quantity, energy, and seasonality of runoff depend on the dimensions, altitude, soils, vegetation, and geology of the catchment areas as well as local geomorphic controls (Schumm, 1991). The geology, vegetation, climate, and soils of the two adjacent hydrological basins are similar, differing primarily in the greater catchment area, elevation, and number of springs in the Las Pitas watershed. The lower reaches of the Las Pitas and Miraguaca rivers both contain shallow alluvial fill over bedrock. However, the Las Pitas River is more entrenched and confined (Figure 4d). The two rivers\u2019 hydrological response to climate change may differ due to a combination of local geomorphological controls and contrasting size and morphometry of their watersheds. The higher altitude Las Pitas catchment area, exceeding 4500 m asl along its eastern perimeter, experiences greater orographic rainfall. Thus, the effects of increased moisture during the local humid events of PI were likely greater for the Las Pitas River than for the Miriguaca River. Upland precipitation supplies the high mountain aquifers that discharge into lower elevation springs and subsequently into wetlands, favoring elevated water tables. The confined nature of the Las Pitas flood plain reduces the effect of evapotranspiration facilitating a more stable baseflow. Consequently, the development of more stable wetlands (cushion peats) mitigated the overall aridity of the region. For the Miriguaca River, however, and its lower elevation upper basin, the hydrological input was smaller resulting in shallower and/or more unstable water tables. Also, the open and wide flood plain of the lower Miriguaca River permits a more spatially dynamic and exposed alluvial reach, facilitating greater evaporation losses compared to the confined canyon of Las Pitas. Consequently, the lower Miriguaca River contained poorly developed wetlands during PI, marked by ephemeral streamflow.",

Thus, increasing aridity during the late Holocene gave rise to diminished baseflow and greater seasonal discharge variability for the Miriguaca River.

This likely led to a territorial demarcation at the familial group or lineage level in and between rivers, as evidenced in the access to specific lithic resources and in the characteristics of both art and projectile point design that follow distinctive styles/features specific to certain areas along both rivers (Aschero & Hocsman, 2011).",

In the long\u2010term, these spaces may have functioned as a catalyst for land\u2010use intensification processes, stimulating sedentism. Hence, hydrological variability facilitated the development of new sociocultural contexts, in this case animal/plant domestication and the development of increasing social complexity. This social complexity set the basis for later agropastoral societies in this area of the southeastern Atacama puna. These results highlight the importance of interdisciplinary studies in defining environmental changes at local/regional scales (sensu Dincauze, 2000) that in turn help us to better understand the complex interrelation between environment and humans in desert areas.",
