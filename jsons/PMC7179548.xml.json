            "text": "Between the end of 2002 and June 2003, the severe epidemic disease called severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) broke out in China and more than 30 other countries. It was known that SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV) is a novel human coronavirus and responsible for SARS infection [1, 2, 3, 4]. SARS-CoV is an enveloped positive-stranded RNA virus, and its genome is composed of about 29,700 nucleotides [5, 6]. The SARS genome encodes 23 putative proteins that are typical of coronavirus such as 5\u2032-replicase (rep), spike (S), membrane (M), envelope (E), and nucleocapsid (N)-3\u2032 [7]. The N protein of SARS-CoV is 422 amino acids long, sharing only 20-30% homology with the N proteins of other coronaviruses [5, 6]. Previous studies indicated that the N proteins of other coronaviruses have a variety of functional activities [8], including participation in transcription of the viral genome, the formation of viral core, and packaging viral RNA [9, 10]. However, no similar functional roles of SARS-CoV have been reported except that SARS-CoV N may selectively activate AP-1 pathway [11]. Furthermore, SARS-CoV N protein is capable of self-association through a C-terminal 209-amino-acid interaction domain [12, 13]. The E protein is another important structural protein of SARS-CoV. More recently, it was shown to play a major role in coronavirus assembly [14, 15].",

Ever since synthetic 21-23 nucleotide short interfering RNA (siRNA) was shown to induce efficient RNAi in mammalian cells, siRNA has been routinely used in gene silencing by transfection of chemically synthesized siRNA. Specific inhibition of cellular mRNA by RNAi can be triggered in mammalian cells by the introduction of siRNA. Currently, RNAi technology is reported as an ideal tool to inhibit infectious virus replication in host cells, including poliovirus [20], HIV-1 [21, 22], flock house virus, Rous sarcoma virus [23], dengue virus [24], hepatitis C virus [25] replicons, influenza virus [26]. hepatitis B virus [27, 28] and SARS-CoV [29, 30].",

COS-7 cells were infected with each shRNA-expressing adenovirus at the multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 30. To investigate whether the adenovirus-delivered small hairpin RNA can enhance the effectiveness of shRNA, we chose shRNAN3 that had the weakest effect in the inhibition of the N gene expression among the four shRNAs. ADN3 were transduced at the MOI of 10, 30, and 80 to test the dose-dependent delivery efficiency. Cells were harvested day 3 postinfection. Luciferase activity was determined from those transfected cells (fig. 2c, d). Transduction of the shRNA-expressing adenoviruses dose-dependently reduced the expression of their target genes. The target mRNAs and proteins were analyzed by RT-PCR (fig. 3e, f) and Western blot analysis (fig. 4e, f) in parallel, results indicated that further reduction was observed after transduction of shRNA-expressing adenoviruses comparing to that transfection of shRNA-expressing plasmids.",

And because of the high sequence specificity of siRNA-mediated RNA degradation, antiviral efficacy of siRNA directed to viral genome will be largely limited by emergence of escape variants resistant to siRNA due to high mutation rates of virus, especially RNA viruses such as poliovirus, hepatitis C virus and SARS-CoV. The problem can be circumvented by targeting multiple essential genes of the viruses and increasing the delivery efficiency of siRNAs. Among all the approaches the most perhaps desirable one is choosing the adenoviral vector expression system. Our results have demonstrated that inhibition of SARS-CoV genes can be achieved by adenovirus-delivered siRNAs.",

Since many cell types can be efficiently infected by adenovirus, recombinant adenoviruses could serve as an alternative powerful tool for delivery of shRNA and for gene suppression, especially when the targeted cells are resistant to transfection by DNA or RNA. In addition, our findings also provide solid evidence for development of an anti-SARS-CoV therapy using adenovirus-delivered small hairpin RNA, which may enhance anti-SARS-CoV efficacy and overcome drug resistance. With availability of high titers of adenoviruses and uniform and rapid infection, this technology will have a foreseeable wide application both in experimental biology and molecular medicine.",
