Although most of the COVID-19 patients have mild or moderate course, up to 5-10% can have severe , potentially life threatening course, there is an urgent need for effective drugs [1]. Optimized supportive care remains the mainstay of therapy. As new data regarding clinical characteristics, treatment options, and outcomes for COVID-19 emerges approximately every hour, physicians who are in the care of patients should keep themselves up to date on this issue. There have been more than 300 clinical trials going on, and some of them will be published in the next couple of months.

With such a large number of therapeutic interventions given to affected patients, the goal was to determine which was efficacious against Ebola. Ultimately, none proved to be efficacious or safe, just because of virtually all studies were single-group interventions without concurrent controls, which led to no definitive conclusion related to efficacy or safety.

            "text": "Chloroquine (CQ) and hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) are aminoquinolines, which have been used to treat malaria and autoimmune diseases for over 50 years. Besides their antimalarial effects, these two drugs possess immunomodulatory effects allowing them to use for the treatment of autoimmune conditions such as systemic lupus erythematosus and rheumatoid arthritis. Hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine can inhibit certain cellular functions and molecular pathways involved in immune activation [Inhibition of MHC class II expression, antigen presentation and immune activation (reducing CD154 expression by T cells); inhibition of production of various proinflammatory cytokines, such as IL-1, IFN\u03b1 and TNF, which can protect against cytokine-mediated cartilage resorption; interference with Toll-like receptor 7 (TLR7) and TLR9 signaling pathways; interference with cyclic GMP-AMP (cGAMP) synthase (cGAS) activity] partly by accumulating in lysosomes and auto phagosomes of phagocytic cells and changing local pH concentrations [6]. Chloroquine analogs are weak diprotic bases (can accept more two protons) and they can penetrate and concentrate within acidic organelles such as endosomes and lysosomes which leads to elevated intra-vesicular pH resulting in prevention of endosome trafficking and prevents viral fusion into the cell. This mechanism has translated to the potential role of these drugs in the treatment of COVID-19. Additionally, studies also revealed that these drugs interfers with the glycosylation of ACE-2 receptor which prevents SARS-CoV-2 receptor binding and subsequent infection. Recent in vitro studies reported CQ and HCQ effective against SARS-CoV-2 at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 0.01 with a 50% effective concentration (EC50) of 2.71 \u00b5M and 4.51 \u00b5M in Vero E6 cells, respectively. At all MOIs (0.01, 0.02, 0.2, and 0.8), EC50 for CQ (2.71, 3.81, 7.14, and 7.36 \u03bcM) was lower than that of HCQ (4.51, 4.06, 17.31, and 12.96 \u03bcM) [7\u20139]. In another in vitro analysis, HCQ was found to be more potent than CQ at inhibiting SARS-CoV-2 and HCQ sulfate 400 mg given twice daily for 1 day, followed by 200 mg twice daily for 4 more days is recommended to treat SARS-CoV-2 infection [10,11].

Favipiravir undergoes an intracellular phosphoribosylation to be an active form, favipiravir ribofuranosyl-5B-triphosphate (favipiravir-RTP), which is recognized as a substrate by RdRp, and inhibits the RNA polymerase activity. Since the catalytic domain of RdRp is conserved among various types of RNA viruses, this mechanism of action may underpins a broader spectrum of antiviral activities of favipiravir. Favipiravir-RTP inhibits RdRp of the influenza virus with an IC50 of0.022 \u00b5g/mL, but does not affect the human DNA polymerases \u03b1, \u03b2, \u03b3 subunits at up to 100 \u00b5g/mL. In addition to the inhibition of influenza virus, favipiravir shows inhibitory effects on a wide range of RNA viruses, such as arena-, bunya-, flavi- and filoviruses causing hemorrhagic fevers [18, 19]. It has been shown to be effective in the treatment of influenza and in some extent Ebola virus disease [19\u201321]. Genome sequencing of the 2019-nCoV identified the virus as a single-stranded RNA beta-coronavirus with the RdRp gene similar to those of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. Therefore, favipiravir is considered as one of the potential candidates for COVID-19, though confirmed in vitro and preclinical animal studies are not available yet. In an in-vitro study, SARS-CoV-2 was inhibited by favipiravir in Vero E6 cells with an EC50 of 61.88 \u00b5Mol [14].

Remdesivir is a prodrug of a nucleotide analog that is intracellularly metabolized to an analog of adenosine triphosphate that inhibits viral RNA polymerases. Remdesivir has broadspectrum activity against members of several virus families, including filoviruses (e.g., Ebola) and coronaviruses [e.g., SARS-CoV and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERSCoV)] and has shown prophylactic and therapeutic efficacy in nonclinical models of these coronaviruses. In vitro testing has also shown that remdesivir has activity against SARS-CoV-2 with an EC50 value of 1.76 \u03bcM in Vero E6 cells suggesting its working concentration is likely to be achieved in nonhuman primate models [8]. Treatment with intravenous remdesivir showed significant improvement for the first COVID-19 case in US [24] and then a trial has been initiated quickly to assess the efficacy and safety of remdesivir in patients hospitalized with 2019-nCoV infection. In a cohort of patients hospitalized for severe Covid-19 who were treated with compassionate use remdesivir, clinical improvement was observed in 36 of 53 patients (68%) [25]. As there was no placebo or active comparator in this study, it is hard to draw any concrete conclusions and measurement of efficacy will require results of ongoing randomized, placebo-controlled trials of remdesivir therapy. There are 4 clinical trials currently enrolling patients in the United States and, two additional trials recruiting only in China have been registered on ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT04257656 (severe disease) and NCT04252664 (mild-moderate disease) [2].",

There was a trend towards decreased mortality with LPV/r (19 versus 25 percent), and the numerical difference in mortality was greater among those who were randomized within 12 days of symptom onset, but neither difference was statistically significant. The rate of SARS-CoV-2 decline was similar in the group that received LPV/r and the group that did not. LPV/r was stopped early in 14 percent because of adverse effects. The patients recruited for the study were late in infection and already had considerable tissue damage (as evidenced by compromised lung function and 25% mortality in the control group). Even highly active antibacterial agents have limited efficacy in advanced bacterial pneumonia [33]. Accelerated clinical recovery (16.0 days vs. 17.0 days) and reduced mortality (19.0% vs. 27.1%) were observed in a post hoc subgroup of those treated within 12 days after the onset of symptoms, but not in those treated later [48, 49]. Also in another study of 280 COVID-19 patients, time from illness onset to antiviral was found to be a risk factor for severe disease. Patients in the mild group experienced earlier initiation of antiviral treatment (1.19 \u00b1 0.45 vs. 2.65 \u00b1 1.06 days in the severe group, P < 0.001) [34].

Nitazoxanideupregulates the innate antiviral mechanisms by broadly amplifying cytoplasmic RNA sensing and type I IFN pathways. Nitazoxanide interferes with the viral infection by upregulating the precise host mechanisms that viruses target to bypass host cellular defenses [36]. Due to its broad-spectrum antiviral activity, nitazoxanide is being investigated in clinical trials including randomized controlled ones for the management of influenza and other acute respiratory infections, although results are not encouraging or unavailable yet. Although the in vitro activity of nitazoxanide against SARS-CoV-2 is encouraging, more data are clearly needed to determine its role in the management of COVID-19 [26]1616Padmanabhan S (2020).

Originally identified as an inhibitor of the interaction between the human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1) integraseprotein and the importin (IMP) 1 heterodimer responsible for integrase protein nuclear import, ivermectin has since been confirmed to inhibit integrase protein nuclear import and HIV-1 replication. Other actions of ivermectin have been reported, but ivermectin has been shown to inhibit the nuclear import of host and viral proteins. It has been demonstrated to limit infection by some RNA viruses including influenza, dengue and West Nile viruses. Ivermectin has similarly been shown to be effective against the DNA virus pseudorabies virus (PRV) both in vitro and in vivo, with ivermectin treatment shown to increase survival in PRV-infected mice [37]. Efficacy was not observed for ivermectin against Zikavirus in mice, but the authors acknowledged that study limitations justified the reevaluation of ivermectin\u2019s anti-Zika virus activity [38]. Finally, ivermectin was the focus of a phase III clinical trial in Thailand in 2014\u20132017, against dengue virus infection, in which a single daily oral dose was observed to be safe and resulted in a significant reduction in serum levels of viral NS1 protein, but no change in viremia or clinical benefit was observed1717Yamasmith E, Avirutnan P, Mairiang D, Tanrumluk S, Suputtamongkol Y et al.
