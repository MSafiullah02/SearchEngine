For more than a century, preparations from P. reniforme Curtis and/or P. sidoides DC. have also been used in European herbal medicine particularly for the therapy of tuberculosis and airway infections. A proprietary extract from the roots of P. sidoides (EPs\u00ae 7630) has been developed and registered with a full marketing authorization for the indication \u201cacute bronchitis\u201d by the German Federal Institute for Drugs and Medical Devices in 2005 (Brendler 2008). Therapeutic efficacy in this and related indications such as common cold, rhinosinusitis, tonsillopharyngitis, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease has been evaluated in numerous randomized, double-blind and placebo-controlled trials as well as observational clinical study in patients from an age of one year upwards (Moyo and Van Staden, 2014, Matthys et al., 2014). Safety and tolerability of EPs\u00ae 7630 has been demonstrated in 29 clinical trials and post-marketing surveillance studies involving more than 10,000 adults and children (Matthys et al. 2013).",

In vitro evaluation of pharmacological activities revealed among others mild to moderate direct antibacterial and antiviral properties, inhibition of bacterial adhesion on host cells as well as activation of the innate immune defense. This later action is mediated by stimulation of release of tumor necrosis factor-alpha, nitric oxide, and interferon-beta, which are accompanied by an enhanced natural killer cell activity and an improved phagocytosis, oxidative burst and intracellular killing by human peripheral blood phagocytes. Besides, cytoprotective capabilities and an increase of ciliary beat frequency of nasal respiratory cells have been reported (Kolodziej 2011).",

In accordance with the EPs\u00ae 7630 standard dose of 60 mg/day for adolescents and adults (body weight 15\u201360 kg), equivalent doses on the basis of allometric means in mice, rats and guinea pigs would be about 15\u201336, 7\u201319 and 6\u201315 mg/kg/day, respectively. Based on this calculation, for the animal experiments doses which approximately correspond to once, twice or three times the average human equivalent dose for an adolescent person were chosen. Hence, the following doses were applied to mice (20, 40, 120 mg/kg/day); rats (15, 30, 60 mg/kg/day) and guinea pigs (10, 20, 45 mg/kg/day). All treatments were performed by gavage.

Other symptoms include sore throat, runny nose, headache, growing pains, fatigue, and possibly fever. The transition from a common cold to an acute bronchitis is fluent. In the early stages of the inflammatory reaction patients are particularly afflicted by a dry cough. Following the release of inflammatory mediators or damage of the airway epithelium sensory nerves are activated which initializes the cough reflex. Although cough is normally a defensive reflex that keeps the respiratory tract free of obstructions and harmful substances it is non-productive at this stage as mucus secretion is not yet increased. Due to its pure force coughing bouts further irritate the already affected mucous membranes and induce a vicious circle. Thus, antitussive therapy is indicated at this phase of acute airway infections (Holzinger et al., 2014, Reynolds et al., 2004).",

Measurement of secretolytic activity was evaluated by measuring the excretion of phenol red into respiratory tract (Coppi and Gatti 1989). Indeed, the extract was found to dose-dependently increased elimination of the dye via the respiratory tract with statistically significant effects at doses of 40 and 120 mg/kg. Thus, secretolytic activity could also contribute to the cough inhibiting action of EPs\u00ae 7630 by dilution and accelerated removal of the chemical stimuli whereby the later effect may be enhanced by the previously reported increase of ciliary beat frequency in the presence of the extract (Neugebauer et al. 2005).",

These pathological changes were dose-dependently reduced around the tracheae of treated animals when compared with the model control group while a significant effect on bronchial histopathology was only seen at a dose of 30 mg/kg.
