Study design: Four assays were designed to quantify a 296 bp region located within the 5 untranslated region (UTR) of RV-C types. These assays were based on in silico analysis of available RV-C sequences. Probes were designed to provide 100% homology to the corresponding RV-C genotypes. Results: The linear dynamic range of each of the four assays spanned eight orders of magnitude (10 4 -10 11 copies/mL). The limit of detection for assays 1-4 was estimated to be 1147 copies/mL, 765 copies/mL, 1138 copies/mL and 1470 copies/mL respectively. Each assay demonstrated a strong linear relationship (r 2 = >0.995) and amplification efficiency greater than 95%. Repeatability and reproducibility of the method were shown to be high, with coefficients of variations lower than 8% and 15% respectively.",

The spectrum of disease associated with this group of viruses can range from asymptomatic infection, mild upper respiratory tract infection (common cold) to severe lower respiratory tract infections which may include bronchiolitis or pneumonia (Choi et al., 2015; Iwane et al., 2011; Luchsinger et al., 2014) . RV has been identified as an important contributor to acute asthma (Bizzintino et al., 2011) and wheezing illness in young children is an important risk factor in the development of asthma later in life (Jackson et al., 2008) . Further, RV exacerbates pre-existing airway diseases such as asthma, cystic fibrosis and chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases (Camargo et al., 2012; Kennedy et al., 2014; Luchsinger et al., 2014) .",

RV-C is the most recently described species and to date there are 55 recognised genotypes. Clinical significance of RV-C is still debated as some studies report that RV-C causes more severe disease than the other two species (Bizzintino et al., 2011; Cox et al., 2013; Miller et al., 2009 ) but others have not found this association (Iwane et al., 2011; Linsuwanon et al., 2009) . Inaccurate quantitative methods complicate the evaluation of viral factors that may contribute to disease severity (Schibler et al., 2012) . Viral load studies of other viruses have shown that the amount of replicating virus is an important contributor to disease severity (Franz et al., 2010; Jansen et al., 2010) , thus an accurate and reliable method of quantifying RV-C load may be an important tool in understanding the contribution of RV-C to disease pathogenesis, disease progression and clinical management.",

Each RV-C transcript was prepared at seven different concentrations ranging from 10 7 to 10 1 copies/L with the calculated copy numbers (means of three experiments) for each transcript expressed as percentages of the copy number obtained with the perfectly matched RV-C transcript-1. At concentrations between 10 7 and 10 2 copies/L there was minimal (<15%) difference in copy number yield between transcript-1 and transcript-2. However, at the lowest copy number (10 1 ), a single nucleotide mismatch (near the 5'end) in the probe target region (Fig. 1 ) resulted in an inaccurate viral load determination (Table 2) . Multiple mismatches between the probe and target (transcript-3 and-4) resulted in substantial inaccuracy in RV-C load measurement across the concentration range (Table 2) .",

Similar to other acute viral respiratory tract infections where a correlation exists between viral load and disease severity (DeVincenzo et al., 2010; Li et al., 2010; Roussy et al., 2014; To et al., 2010) , it is suspected that RV-C load may also drive disease severity. Inaccurate quantitative methods complicate the evaluation of viral factors that may contribute to disease severity (Schibler et al., 2012) . Previously published quantitative assays have tried to address the genetic heterogeneity of RV-C by either using an intercalating dye in place of a specific hydrolysis probe or adding degenerate bases in either the primer or probe sequence (Bochkov et al., 2011; Granados et al., 2012) . However, accuracy maybe impaired since these techniques may lead to non-specific amplification and reduced amplification efficiencies of the assays (Chemidlin Prevost-Boure et al., 2011; Schibler et al., 2012) .",

All assays demonstrated a broad dynamic range, high sensitivity, efficiency and performance in RV-C viral load determination with both clinical samples and in vitro RNA transcripts. Viral load in our respiratory samples were within the 1 \u00d7 10 3 and 1 \u00d7 10 12 copies/mL range which is in concordance with previous publications Roussy et al., 2014; Schibler et al., 2012) . All assays demonstrated high repeatability and reproducibility with CV of below 8% and 15% respectively. All assays were nonreactive with a range of other potential respiratory pathogens but crossreactivity with other picornavirus species requires sequencing of the 5 UTR to confirm RV-C identification prior to quantification.

Indeed, previously published studies have shown that the positioning of the mismatch is a crucial determinant of probe binding affinity (Benovoy et al., 2008; Letowski et al., 2004) which may in turn impact upon the accuracy of the calculated viral load. Mismatches throughout or near the middle of the probe target region destabilize hybridization more than those near the ends (Letowski et al., 2004) . Another recent study demonstrated that multiple mismatches in the probe target region may have a greater impact on accuracy than a single mismatch (Randhawa et al., 2011) . This is consistent with our findings which showed that at most dilutions a single probe mismatch between assay probe and transcript material had minimal impact on accuracy but when multiple mismatches were present there was a substantial effect on viral load measurement across the dilution range. Together, these findings demonstrate the need for multiple qRT-PCR assays to achieve accurate RV-C loads for the different genotypes. However, we were able to show that this could be achieved with a small number of assays, requiring only four different probes to cover the 34 genotypes with known 5 UTR sequences. It is anticipated that these four assays will cover more of the RV-C genotypes, but that awaits further sequence data.",
