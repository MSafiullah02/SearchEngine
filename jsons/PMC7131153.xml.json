Previously Anand et al. reported on progress in designing specific anti-SARS drugs, i.e., inhibitors of Corona virus proteinase [2]. We postulate that proteinase-mediated damage of mitochondria, and consequently of human cellular energy generation, is an essential element in acute (e.g., influenza) and chronic (e.g., hepatitis B) intracellular infections.",

Protein breakdown can occur both inside and outside the cell. Intracellular proteinases are located inside proteolytic bodies, the proteasomes [3], and thus, intracellular damage of relevant proteins is prevented. Redundant, often old and degenerated, proteins inside the cell are labelled with ubiquitin molecules for recognition by the proteasomes [3]. This does not apply to pancreatic and microbial proteinases. Pancreatic proteinases are excreted into the gut to depolymerise nutritional proteins. Bacteria and fungi produce extracellular proteinases since they need aminoacids for optimal reproduction. This also occurs inside host cells. Viral proteinases are produced during propagation inside host cells to supply amino acids for rapid synthesis of viral proteins, and/or to split poly-protein molecules into single protein molecules, e.g., capside, and matrix and/or envelope proteins. For adequate propagation of intracellular pathogens during infection, proteinases have to be freely present inside host cells.",

Although the proteinases are not thought to invade and destroy mitochondria and essential intra-mitochondrial structures involved in energy generation, they can destroy non-mitochondrial encoded mitochondrial proteins during transport to the mitochondria [4], i.e., before incorporation inside the mitochondria in intra-mitochondrial structures, e.g., in cytochrome oxidase.",

In this process the energy generation is limited to glycolysis, which frees only 2 mol ATP from 1 mol of glucose (with simultaneous production of 2 mol lactic acid). Thus, large amounts of sugars are needed for little energy, while simultaneously large amounts of lactic acid are produced that must be excreted into blood and finally spread throughout the whole body.",

Some severe intracellular infections are caused by bacteria, e.g., meningococci, Yersinia pestis, Salmonella typhi and Legionella pneumophila; they excrete proteinases into the host cell cytoplasm. The proteolytic effect does not essentially differ from that of viral proteinases. The same applies for parasites, e.g., Leishmania spp., Toxoplasma gondii and Plasmodium spp. that are present inside cells. Thus, proteinase-mediated intracellular effects of plasmodia are limited to the hepatic schizogony, i.e., asexual multiplication inside hepatic cells.",

Intracellular inhibition of viral proteinase prevents direct production of viral proteins from polyproteins and/or indirect production from host proteins. Consequently, the production of intact virulent virions and viral spread is limited or even prevented. Intracellular inhibition of the proteinases of bacteria or parasites may slow down multiplication of these organisms in a similar way and thus reduce the spread and infectivity. We suggest that specific proteinase inhibitors, other than proteasome inhibitors [6], may become important antimicrobial agents to be used against intracellular pathogens, especially viruses [1].",
