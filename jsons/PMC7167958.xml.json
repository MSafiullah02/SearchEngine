The process uses electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESI\u2010MS) and base composition analysis of PCR amplification products from highly conserved genomic regions to identify and determine the relative quantity of pathogenic bacteria, viruses, fungi, or protozoa present in a sample. The fundamental distinction between this PCR/ESI\u2010MS strategy and traditional (specific) nucleic acid tests is the nature of the question being answered. Traditional nucleic acid tests answer the question: \u201cIs infectious organism X in my sample?\u201d The PCR/ESI\u2010MS method answers the question: \u201cWhat infectious organisms are in my sample?\u201d In effect, this is equivalent to running many thousands of specific nucleic acid tests because the identity of the infectious organism being detected does not need to be anticipated. The premise of this technology is that it can provide rapid, sensitive, and cost\u2010effective detection of a broad range of \u201cnormal\u201d pathogenic organisms and simultaneously identify unexpected or emerging infectious organisms.

Parallel detection of infectious agents takes advantage of highly conserved regions within genes that flank highly variable regions. These conserved genomic features serve as anchors for broad\u2010range PCR priming to amplify, without prejudice, nucleic acids from most microorganisms in a sample. Such broad\u2010range PCR reactions targeted across the broadest possible grouping of organisms typically result in a mixture of amplicons, reflecting the complexity of the starting sample. With no further separation, this mixture of PCR amplicons is desalted and analyzed by ESI\u2010MS for accurate mass measurement, enabling us to determine the base composition (numbers of A, G, C, and T nucleotides) of the PCR amplicons.\n23\n, \n25\n, \n26\n Amplification relies on highly conserved regions, but the variability in sequence between the two primer sites, reflected in the base composition, allows us to distinguish between organisms.",

While no single PCR target region might give definitive species resolution for all microbes, species can be clearly identified and differentiated from one another using the triangulation strategy across multiple loci. A database of expected base compositions for each primer region for all known organisms was generated using an in silico PCR search algorithm (electronic PCR or ePCR). An existing ribonucleic acid (RNA) structure search algorithm has been modified to include PCR parameters, such as hybridization conditions, mismatches, and thermodynamic calculations.\n27\n This also provides information on primer specificity of the selected primer pairs. The regions are selected so that the nucleic acid composition of the resulting amplicons has sufficient variability to maximally resolve the target organisms. Thus, the measured base compositions from strategically selected locations of the genome are used as a signature to identify and distinguish the organisms present in the original sample.",

This allows for the simultaneous presence of an accurately quantified amount of a known calibrant deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) with similar amplification properties to the target sequence during the PCR cycle. Further, this serves as an internal positive control for every PCR reaction. The relative abundances of the end products (as measured by the mass peak heights) can be used in conjunction with the starting concentration of the calibrant to accurately estimate the amount of target sequence in the starting sample (\nfig. 2).

Based upon the analysis of multiple influenza sequence alignments, pan\u2010influenza virus PCR primer sets have been developed that are capable of amplifying all three influenza virus species (A, B, and C) and subtypes (HxNy) from different animal hosts (human, avian, swine, etc.) and to distinguish their essential molecular features using base composition signatures (Sampath et al., Personal Observation). To measure the breadth of coverage and resolution offered by this panel we tested 50 different influenza virus isolates, including 22 avian isolates (representing 20 different H/N types, collected from 9 different species of wild birds), 18 human influenza A isolates (8 H1N1, 10 H3N2), 4 swine isolates (including 1 novel type), 1 equine isolate, and 6 human influenza B isolates. The avian influenza samples represented a variety of host species, influenza virus types, geographic locations, and dates of isolation. Despite the diversity of this sample set, the broad\u2010range primers generated amplicons from all isolates, while the base composition signatures from amplicons obtained with these primers distinguished the isolates (Sampath et al., manuscript submitted). The assay is high throughput (\u223c300 samples/24 h) and rapid (sample to answer in <6 h). In silico analysis of >1,400 influenza virus sequences from the GenBank database showed that the primer panel would detect all known influenza viruses and distinguish >90% of all species, with 100% resolution between avian H5N1 and any human isolate.
