Through this study, we tried to analyze the patient flow system by assessing the arrival and waiting time distribution of patients in the Emergency Out Patient Department (EOPD). This study will inform the hospital administrators and policy makers in effectively design a system so as to reduce waiting times and hence overcrowding in ED. This will in-turn benefit the patient by increasing their satisfaction rate.What does this study attempt to show? This study attempted to understand patient flow in emergency department. The waiting times at different service stations in EOPD has been analysed. The paper provides insight to some of operational factors and solutions, which are easily replicated across other countries.What are the key findings?\nArrival time pattern of patients in the EOPD was highly random with peak hour of presentation was 10.01-11.00 with 11% of the total presentationsThe primary waiting areas of patients included patients \u201cunder observation\u201d (29.6%); \u201cwaiting for routine diagnostic tests\u201d (16.4%) and waiting \u201cfor discharge\u201d (14.6%). Around 71% patients were waiting due to reasons within Emergency Complex.\nHow is patient care impacted? Overcrowding resulting from poor patient flow and excess waits can result in delayed treatment, long patient waiting time and stay, overburdened working staff, patient elopement, high medical error rate, low throughput and poor patient outcomes.\n",
