            "text": "The 2020 update position paper on secondary prevention and cardiovascular rehabilitation from the Secondary Prevention and Rehabilitation Section of the European Association of Preventive Cardiology is welcome. However, the paper is wanting for the lack of a firm recommendation for home-based cardiac rehabilitation especially as these programmes are highly relevant in the era of coronavirus disease 2019-COVID-19. 1 Traditionally, the majority of patients receive cardiac rehabilitation in supervised, group-based classes conducted in hospital outpatient departments or community centres, ranging in frequency, intensity and duration of exercise and self-help guidance over several weeks. Participation rates in centre-based cardiac rehabilitation programmes remain suboptimal, despite current national and international recommendations. 2 Over the last decade, there have been calls for new strategies to improve participation in cardiac rehabilitation; homeor web-based options have been suggested, several have been trialled and tested, 2,3 and some of these approaches have been reiterated in the position paper. 1 The American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association recently endorsed home-based rehabilitation, 4 and the updated UK National Institute for Health and Care Excellence 2018 guidance on chronic heart failure also stated that 'delivery of home-based rehabilitation may increase access and uptake'. 5 The flexibility and better adherence of engaging in homebased cardiac rehabilitation are given as reasons for potential benefit. 4 There is a surprise omission from the position paper, 1 however, of a UK multicentre trial of home-based rehabilitation in heart failure. The findings of the Rehabilitation Enablement in Chronic Heart Failure (REACH-HF) study have demonstrated clinical effectiveness and cost effectiveness and have been published in this journal. 6, 7 The British Heart Foundation has just awarded a grant to co-develop a digital version of REACH HF to improve access to rehabilitation to patients with heart failure in the UK.",
