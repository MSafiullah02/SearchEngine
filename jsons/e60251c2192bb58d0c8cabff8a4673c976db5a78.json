Our analysis concludes that the situation is not yet compatible with a plateau trend and allows us to predict the trend in the number of deaths in the Lombardy region. We therefore conclude that the containment measures put in place by the government on March 11 th will allow a reduction in deaths from around 8000 to just over 6500 for March 27 th .",
