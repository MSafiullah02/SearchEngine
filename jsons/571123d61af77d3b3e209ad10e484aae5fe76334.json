            "text": "Human bocavirus (HBoV) infection is reported worldwide and may cause severe respiratory tract infections. The aim of the present study was to assess the prevalence of HBoV, and other respiratory viral pathogens, in a 2-year retrospective study of children admitted to hospital, and to investigate whether viral loads of HBoV DNA were associated with severity of infection. Between April 2007 and March 2009, 891 respiratory samples from 760 children admitted to hospital with acute respiratory tract infection were tested for the presence of respiratory viruses by real-time PCR or direct immunofluorescence testing. HBoV DNA was detected by using internally controlled real-time quantitative PCR assay and 25 samples selected at random were sequenced. The virus detected most frequently was rhinovirus, followed by respiratory syncytial virus, HBoV, and human metapneumovirus. HBoV DNA was detected in 18.4% of children admitted to hospital. HBoV was the only viral pathogen detected in 66/164 (40.2%) of HBoV DNA-positive children and in 7.4% of all 891 samples. Ninety-seven percent (64/66) of children with an HBoV single infection were diagnosed as having lower respiratory tract infection. Median HBoV DNA viral load was significantly higher in children when HBoV was detected as a single pathogen. Higher HBoV DNA viral loads were associated with prematurity and age. HBoV seems to be an important and frequent pathogen in respiratory tract infections in children, and it is likely that the severity of illness is comparable to the severity of RSV illness.",

            "text": "Human bocavirus (HBoV) was discovered in 2005 in nasopharyngeal aspirates of Swedish children with lower respiratory tract infection [Allander et al., 2005] . Respiratory infection with HBoV occurs worldwide with frequencies ranging from 1.5% to 19.3% in respiratory samples of children [Bastien et al., 2006; Weissbrich et al., 2006; Neske et al., 2007; Bonzel et al., 2008; Brieu et al., 2008; von Linstow et al., 2008; Albuquerque et al., 2009; Fabbiani et al., 2009; Calvo et al., 2010; Kaida et al., 2010; Moriyama et al., 2010; Midulla et al., 2010; Miron et al., 2010; Song et al., 2010] . HBoV was also detected in stool specimens of children admitted to hospital for acute gastroenteritis [Albuquerque et al., 2007; Lee et al., 2007; Chieochansin et al., 2008; Kapoor et al., 2009 Kapoor et al., , 2010 Szomor et al., 2009; Chow et al., 2010] . Infections are known in children and adults, but children younger than 2 years appear to be most at risk of HBoV infection. HBoV was found recently in children with lower respiratory tract infection, and several studies show an association between HBoV and acute respiratory symptoms, which is consistent with a causal role [Allander et al., 2005; Kesebir et al., 2006; Manning et al., 2006; Fry et al., 2007; Maggi et al., 2007] . Most studies confirmed a high rate of coinfections, where HBoV occurs simultaneously with other respiratory viruses, thereby making the association of HBoV with disease more complex [Allander, 2008; Schildgen et al., 2008] . There are also a few reports of the persistence of HBoV DNA in respiratory and blood samples, or prolonged shedding of HBoV in infected patients [Allander et al., 2007; von Linstow et al., 2008; Martin et al., 2010] .",

Clinical features of HBoV infections were compared with infections with other frequently detected respiratory viruses, such as respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), human rhinoviruses (hRV), human metapneumoviruses (hMPV), and human coronaviruses (hCoV). Of 891 respiratory samples, 94% were nasopharyngeal swabs, 4% were throat swabs, and 2% were tracheal aspirates and bronchoalveolar lavages. Flocked swabs were transported in 2 ml of liquid viral transport medium (Copan Italia S.p.A., Brescia, Italy).
