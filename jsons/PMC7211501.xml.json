            "text": "Waterborne diarrheal diseases account for approximately 4 billion cases annually, resulting in 2 million deaths, most of which occur in children under five (WHO, 2010). A significant proportion of these illnesses are caused by enteric viral infections (Ramani and Kang, 2009). Enteric viruses are transmitted via the faecal-oral route and the most important route of transmission is direct contact with infected individuals (Katayama and Vinje, 2017). Nonetheless, most enteric viruses are persistent in environments affected by domestic wastewater discharge and are often associated with waterborne outbreaks (Gibson, 2014; Kauppinen et al., 2018; Sekwadi et al., 2018). Wastewater often receives treatment prior to release into the environment, although traditional wastewater treatment methods can be relatively ineffective at removing enteric viruses (Kitajima et al., 2014; Qiu et al., 2015; Sidhu et al., 2017b). In developing countries, many areas lack adequate sanitary infrastructure and wastewater treatment facilities and hence faecal matter contaminates the environment and drinking water sources (Bain et al., 2014). Furthermore, large volumes of untreated wastewater may also be discharged via combined sewer overflows (CSOs) during heavy rainfall events and via dry water overflows for example during snowmelt, tidal infiltration or system failures and blockages (Ahmed et al., 2020). These events enable the direct entry of enteric pathogens into the environment (Fong et al., 2010), where people in direct or indirect contact with contaminated waters may be at risk of acquiring viral infections (Sinclair et al., 2009). Enteric viruses are readily transported in environmental waters and can adsorb to solid matter present in the water column or accumulate in sediment (Hassard et al., 2016). Subsequently, they may also be taken up by filter feeding aquatic animals such as bivalve shellfish that are harvested for human consumption (Landry et al., 1983; Lowther et al., 2012). Furthermore, wastewater is often used for irrigation in countries experiencing freshwater shortage, and hence, enteric viruses may directly contaminate fruit and salad vegetables and result in foodborne outbreaks (Bosch et al., 2016; Chatziprodromidou et al., 2018; Jasim et al., 2016).",

            "text": "Enteric viruses usually cause gastroenteritis lasting for 2\u20135 days. In some cases, the infection results in respiratory, neural or epidermal symptoms, or remains asymptomatic (Table 1\n). The viruses most often associated with gastroenteritis are members of the Picornaviridae, Caliciviridae, Reoviridae and Adenoviridae families (Table 1). For example, noroviruses (family Caliciviridae) are responsible for a high proportion of gastroenteritis infections globally, with 685 million cases and approximately 200,000 deaths (CDC, 2016; Katayama and Vinje, 2017), resulting in a total direct cost of US$4.2 billion to the healthcare system and US$60.3 billion in associated societal costs per year (Bartsch et al., 2016). Rotaviruses (family Reoviridae) and group F mastadenoviruses (AdVs) (family Adenoviridae) are the main causative agents of gastroenteritis amongst infants and young children (Desselberger and Gray, 2009; Jiang, 2006). Noroviruses, hepatitis A virus (family Picornaviridae) and AdVs are the most common viral pathogens associated with waterborne and water-associated foodborne outbreaks and infection may result in serious illness, e.g. acute hepatitis (Bellou et al., 2013; Harris et al., 2006; Jiang, 2006; Parshionikar et al., 2003; Sinclair et al., 2009).",

In addition, several viral gastroenteritis outbreaks linked to sewage-contaminated drinking water containing AdV, noro-sapo-, astro-, rota-, and enteroviruses have been reported (Kauppinen et al., 2019; Maunula et al., 2009; Rasanen et al., 2010). The largest viral waterborne outbreak affecting approximately 80,000 people in Kanpur, India was associated with hepatitis E virus (Naik et al., 1992). The surveillance of enteric viral illnesses can be challenging, as many of the enteric viral outbreaks are unreported as the symptoms are often subclinical (Cortez et al., 2017; Koff, 1992; Li et al., 2017; Matson et al., 1993; Sakai et al., 2001; Zaoutis and Klein, 1998).",

Some PyVs, including BKPyV, WUPyV, KIPyV, MCPyV and JCPyV have been detected at high concentrations (up to 108 genome copies (gc)/l) in wastewater, river and seawater and sediment, in swimming pools and in tap water (Di Bonito et al., 2017; Dias et al., 2018a, Dias et al., 2018b; Farkas et al., 2018a; Fratini et al., 2014; Hamza and Hamza, 2018; Rachmadi et al., 2016).

They have since been found in untreated and treated wastewater at concentrations of 103-105 genome copies (gc)/l (Hamza et al., 2017; Iaconelli et al., 2016; Myrmel et al., 2015), however, their prevalence in environmental water has not been explored. The torque teno virus (family Anelloviridae), which causes gastroenteritis has also been found in wastewater and in polluted river waters. Similar to bocaviruses, torque teno virus concentrations are considerably lower (up to 106 gc/l) than the concentrations of other, more common enteric viruses (104-109 gc/l) (Hamza et al., 2011; Haramoto et al., 2008). Human picobirnaviruses (family Picobirnaviridae) have also been detected in wastewater (concentration range: 103\u2013106 gc/l) and in contaminated rivers with variable prevalence (Adriaenssens et al., 2018; Hamza et al., 2011; Symonds et al., 2009). In addition, recent comparative genomics analysis has suggested that picobirnaviruses are bacteriophages, likely associated with mammalian gut bacteria (Krishnamurthy and Wang, 2018). Genomes or partial genomes of circoviruses (family Circoviridae) and cardioviruses (family Picornaviridae) along with enveloped viruses (coronaviruses, influenza virus) have also been found in wastewater (Bibby and Peccia, 2013; Blinkova et al., 2009; Ng et al., 2012). Enveloped viruses degrade in water rapidly (Gundy et al., 2009; Lebarbenchon et al., 2011), hence, human infections from waterborne corona- and influenza viruses (e.g. SARS-CoV-2) are unlikely.",

Due to the diversity of human pathogenic viruses in the environment, surrogates and indicators are often used to investigate the fate and transport of pathogenic strains in the environment. An indicator may be suitable for a broad assessment of wastewater and drinking water treatment efficiency and for studying pathogen abundance, persistence, adsorption and transport in the aquatic environment. Furthermore, quantitative monitoring of viral indicators can provide useful data for microbial source tracking, transport modelling and risk assessment. Traditionally, faecal indicator bacteria (FIB; including coliform bacteria, Escherichia coli, Enterococcus and Streptococcus spp.) have been used to determine levels of faecal contamination in water. However, it has been shown that bacteria are significantly less resistant to wastewater treatment and less persistent in the environment than enteric viruses (Fong et al., 2005; Kim et al., 2009; Lin and Ganesh, 2013; Prez et al., 2015; Sidhu et al., 2017a; Staley et al., 2012). Consequently, FIB are poor indicators of viral infection risk and this suggests that current water quality monitoring programmes based solely on FIB are inadequate.",

            "text": "Ideally, a good viral indicator for wastewater-contamination assessment should have similar inactivation and retention to the target pathogens and should be present in wastewater and in wastewater-contaminated environments throughout the year. That would enable continuous monitoring and inform on the level of contamination and the probability of pathogen presence. Furthermore, an indicator with constant levels in wastewater may serve as a proxy for population size when wastewater-based epidemiology is used to estimate the proportion of infected people during a viral outbreak or pandemic, e.g. COVID-19 (Xagoraraki and O'Brien, 2020). Additionally, it should be source-specific to distinguish between animal- and human-derived pollution (Scott et al., 2002). Some enteric viruses associated with wastewater (as listed in Table 1) have potential to be used as indicators, however, not all of those viruses fulfil these requirements. Influenza viruses, coronaviruses, circoviruses and papillomaviruses have been detected at high concentrations in wastewater but not in polluted environments, which may be due to their rapid decay in water. Furthermore, some enteric viruses (e.g. astrovirus, rotavirus, torque teno virus and hepatitis E virus; Table 1) may be zoonotic, hence their presence in the environment may be a result of e.g. agricultural activities instead of human waste. Hepatitis A and E viruses are abundant in less economically developed countries, however, they are only responsible for sporadic outbreaks in more developed regions (Bosch et al., 2016). Further, enteroviruses, noroviruses and sapoviruses show clear seasonality with peaks either in the summer (enteroviruses) or during the winter (noroviruses and sapoviruses) in temperate climates. Hence, these viruses are not found in wastewater and in the contaminated environment at all times of the year (Farkas et al., 2018a; Nino Khetsuriani et al., 2006; Pons-salort et al., 2018; Prevost et al., 2015). Human AdVs, PyVs and AiVs are frequently found in wastewater and in polluted environments without any distinct seasonality, hence their utility as effective faecal indicators have been suggested (Kitajima and Gerba, 2015; Rachmadi et al., 2016; Rames et al., 2016).",

Somatic coliphages (phages infecting E. coli) and F-specific RNA bacteriophages (FRNAP; phages infecting bacteria through the F-pili) are commonly used to assess wastewater contamination. However, as not all strains exclusively associate with human bacteria, they should be used with caution. Bacteriophages infecting Bacteroides spp. also have the potential to indicate wastewater contamination. Amongst these phages are a newly discovered group of viruses called crass-like phages. The type genome, crAssphage sensu stricto (metagenome-assembled genome), belongs to the normal gut virome, having co-evolved with humans (Dutilh et al., 2014; Edwards et al., 2019). Since the discovery of the first crAssphage genome, more crass-like sequences have been found and one phage has been isolated. However, their genomic diversity is large and the crAssphage sensu stricto and the isolated crass-like phage do not belong to the same genus (Shkoporov et al., 2018). As the taxonomy of crass-like phages remains to be established, we refer to crAssphage as a group of viruses with nucleotide similarity to the crAssphage sensu stricto described by Dutilh et al. (2014) and quantified by Stachler et al. (2017).",

We considered enteric viruses, (human AdVs, PyVs and AiVs), PMMoV and human gut bacteria-associated bacteriophages, including FRNAP infecting E. coli (specifically genogroups II and III), and bacteriophages of human gut commensal Bacteroides spp. (including crAssphage).

Many of the emerging approaches show great potential to detect low concentrations of viruses in difficult matrices (Dhar and Lee, 2018; Farkas et al., 2020; Gyawali et al., 2019b), however, to date they have not been implemented in the monitoring of viral contamination in the aquatic environment.",

For instance, targeting different regions of the hexon capsid protein gene, all human AdVs or only enteric AdVs (AdV genogroup F) can be quantified (Tables S1 and S8). qPCR can be easily multiplexed, enabling the simultaneous detection of 2\u20135 viral targets (Ahmed et al., 2019a; Farkas et al., 2017b; Jiang et al., 2014; Lee et al., 2016; Montazeri et al., 2015). Hence, it is widely used for the analysis of the level and spread of viral contamination in the aquatic environment (Staggemeier et al., 2017). More recently, digital PCR approaches, enabling absolute quantification without relying on standards, have also been used for the estimation of viral counts in wastewater and in environmental waters (Ishii et al., 2014; Jumat et al., 2017; Kishida et al., 2014; Sedji et al., 2018). These methods are also efficient, sensitive and often provide more accurate results that qPCR (Ishii et al., 2014; Kishida et al., 2014).",

Therefore, the use of DNA viruses as indicators (e.g. AdV, PyV, crAssphage) for wastewater-derived viral contamination may be more feasible than the use of RNA viruses (AiV, PMMoV, FRNAP) due to the more robust molecular detection of DNA targets (Farkas et al., 2017a; Hata et al., 2011). A major disadvantage of all PCR-based viral detection approaches is that they do not give any indication on the infectivity of the target, and hence often overestimate viral concentration and human health risks (Knight et al., 2013). Detecting segments of indicator genes is helpful for the evaluation of the magnitude of faecal contamination and source tracking, nonetheless, an ideal indicator should be capable of being cultured in vitro to enable the direct assessment of viral infectivity and decay in wastewater and in the aquatic environment.",

            "text": "In the studies subject to this review, enteric viruses, crAssphage and PMMoV were predominantly detected and quantified using qPCR-based assays. However, in a few studies plaque assay or integrated cell culture-qPCR (ICC-qPCR) were used for AdV detection (Table S1). The combination of cell culture and qPCR detection of viral replication enabled the detection of infectious viruses, which grew slowly and/or failed to produce cytopathic effects. Using this approach, the time required for infectivity analysis has been reduced from one week to two days, enabling rapid detection. Overall, qPCR/dPCR gave 1\u20135 log10 higher AdV concentrations than plaque assay and ICC-qPCR due to the presence of damaged virus particles and free viral DNA derived from degraded viruses in the environmental samples (Fongaro et al., 2015, 2013; Hamza et al., 2011; Hewitt et al., 2011; Rigotto et al., 2010; Rodr\u00edguez et al., 2013; Sassoubre et al., 2012; Sedji et al., 2018). The higher concentrations detected using ICC-qPCR compared to the traditional culturing assays suggest that using qPCR-based quantification of cultured viruses is more sensitive and hence more reliable in environmental settings (Fongaro et al., 2013; Sedji et al., 2018). PyVs and AiV are also culturable, however, the propagation process is time consuming (2\u20134 and 4\u20136 weeks, respectively) and often inconclusive (Reuter et al., 2011; Seehafer et al., 1978), hence, these approaches have not been adapted to environmental studies. ICC-qPCR-based approaches may be suitable for assessing the infectivity of these viruses in the environment, however, to date no ICC-qPCR assays have been developed for these targets. The disadvantage of any culturing-based assay for enteric virus detection is the need for specific equipment (e.g. CO2 incubator), environment (BSL2 or BSL3) and staff for the maintenance of specific cell lines, which may not be available in routine monitoring laboratories.",

However, this method will produce plaques of a range of different strains that cannot be differentiated based on morphology. Therefore, to identify and quantify specific FRNAP genogroups, it is necessary to use genogroup-specific molecular detection methods.

Using these viruses and their corresponding animal associated strains, the source of contamination (e.g. human vs wildlife, livestock, etc.) can be assessed. For example, Staggemeier et al. (2015) used SYBR Green qPCR for the detection and quantification of AdVs in water and sediment samples by distinguishing human, bovine, porcine, canine and avian AdV genome sequences based on their melting temperature. Human and porcine AdVs, bovine PyV and porcine circovirus have also been used to assess the level of agriculture-related and human sewage-associated contamination in recreational, groundwater and drinking water (Fongaro et al., 2015; Garcia et al., 2012; Rusi\u00f1ol et al., 2014). In the studies evaluated in this review, the AdV qPCR assays targeted all human AdV groups (A-G), the most common groups (A-F) or specific groups (C and F; Table S1). All of these groups are human-specific, demonstrating that waterborne infections of AdV F (predominantly type 41) are the most prevalent in wastewater and in the aquatic environment (Bofill-Mas et al., 2010; Chigor and Okoh, 2012; Fong et al., 2010; Fumian et al., 2013; Haramoto et al., 2007; Hewitt et al., 2011; Iaconelli et al., 2017; Ibrahim et al., 2018; Lun et al., 2019; Myrmel et al., 2015; Ogorzaly et al., 2015; Shih et al., 2017).

All known human AiV (group A and B) have been found in human wastewater (Table S3). These viruses are highly human-specific and have not been found to associate with animal diseases.

Nonetheless, the primary source of the virus are bell and chilli peppers, with the suggestion that it should not be used as a faecal indicator nearby to commercial pepper plant production areas. qPCR assays targeting PMMoV show high sensitivity, however, the viruses were also detected in avian, bovine and dog faeces at low concentrations (Gyawali et al., 2019a; Hamza et al., 2011; Rosario et al., 2009) suggesting that animals may also access pepper as a food source. Furthermore, it has been suggested that PMMoV is more abundant in faeces and in wastewater where more pepper products are consumed (Symonds et al., 2018), therefore the prevalence of PMMoV should be further investigated.",

For this reason, several studies have used methods (described in Section 3.1) to distinguish between FRNAP genogroups to determine faecal sources. However, while there does appear to be a general association between genogroups and faecal sources, the bacterial host (E. coli expressing F-pili) is not source-specific and there is often overlap between source types for each genogroup (Cole et al., 2003; Harwood et al., 2013).",

The most commonly used strains, which are phages that infect Bacteroides BG-124 (BacBG124P), RYC-2056 (BacRYC 2056P), GA-17 (BacGA17P) and ARABA-84 (BacARABA84P), were shown to be human specific. However, one study detected BacRYC 2056P in wastewater samples derived from abattoirs, suggesting animal association (Wicki et al., 2015). qPCR based assays targeting crAssphage have shown good human specificity. While some cross-reactivity has been shown with dog, gull, poultry, pig and cattle faeces (Ahmed et al., 2018a; Garc\u00eda-Aljaro et al., 2017; Stachler et al., 2017), the levels of crAssphage found in these non-human sources were several orders of magnitude lower than that of human sources. The highest crAssphage concentrations in animal sources were found by Garc\u00eda-Aljaro et al. (2017) which may be attributed to pooled samples and/or the use of a different qPCR assay. Garc\u00eda-Aljaro et al. (2017) also found that by normalising crAssphage levels against a general faecal indicator (E. coli), it was still possible to distinguish between human and non-human sources. Nevertheless, the cross-reactions of the qPCR with animal excreta should be further investigated to assess human specificity.",

Similar peak concentrations (108 gc/l) were observed when AdV groups A-G were targeted in Germany (Hamza et al., 2009a) and in Queensland, Australia (Sidhu et al., 2017b). The highest concentrations of AdVF (108-1010 gc/l) were observed in the US (Michigan) (Simmons et al., 2011) and in Giza, Egypt (Elmahdy et al., 2019) further verifying that this group of AdV is highly prevalent.",

BKV and MCV are probably less abundant in wastewater than JCV with concentration ranges of 103-107 gc/l and 104-105 gc/l, however, limited surveillance has been done on these viruses in wastewater. AiV has only been sought in untreated wastewater in the USA (Arizona), Vietnam and Nepal (Haramoto and Kitajima, 2017; Kitajima et al., 2014; Kuroda et al., 2015; Schmitz et al., 2016) with concentrations between 104 and 106 gc/l, and shown to be less prevalent than the other indicators. The detection rate and concentration of AdV, PyV, AiV, FRNAP-II, crAssphage and PMMoV usually exceeded the concentration of noroviruses, sapovirus, enterovirus, astrovirus, rotavirus and hepatitis E virus (Farkas et al., 2019, 2018a; 2018b; Flannery et al., 2013; Fumian et al., 2013; Gr\u00f8ndahl-Rosado et al., 2014a; Hata et al., 2014; Kitajima et al., 2014, 2013; Masclaux et al., 2013; Prevost et al., 2015; Qiu et al., 2015; Simmons et al., 2011).

            "text": "All potential indicator viruses showed high (>90%) detection rates in untreated wastewater, except BacRYC 2056P, which was found only in 82% and 38% of the analysed samples. AdVs and PyVs were frequently detected in wastewater from large and small wastewater treatment plants in the Americas, Europe, Asia and Australia (Fig. 1; Table 2; Tables S1 and S2). Prevalence and concentration information for AiV was only reported for untreated wastewater samples from large wastewater treatment plants in the USA (Arizona) and Vietnam (Kitajima et al., 2018a, 2014; 2013; Kuroda et al., 2015; Schmitz et al., 2016). The PMMoV titre was assessed in wastewater samples derived from the USA, Germany, New Zealand and Vietnam (Hamza et al., 2011; Kitajima et al., 2014; Kuroda et al., 2015; Rosario et al., 2009; Schmitz et al., 2016; Symonds et al., 2016). FRNAP-II prevalence in wastewater was only assessed in Japan and Ireland (Flannery et al., 2013; Haramoto et al., 2015, 2012; Lee et al., 2018), while FRNAP-III prevalence in wastewater was only assessed in Japan (Haramoto et al., 2015, 2012; Lee et al., 2018; Setiyawan et al., 2014, 2013). In wastewater, the concentrations of phages associated with Bacteroides BG-124 were assessed in the US, Brazil, the UK (England) and Switzerland (E. Dias et al., 2018a; McMinn et al., 2014; Prado et al., 2018; Purnell et al., 2015; Stefanakis et al., 2019; Wicki et al., 2015), BacRYC 2056P were investigated in Colombia, the UK, Spain, France, Cyprus, Sweden, Switzerland and Thailand (Cost\u00e1n-Longares et al., 2008; Gomila et al., 2008; Payan et al., 2005; Venegas et al., 2015; Wangkahad et al., 2017; Wicki et al., 2015, 2011), BacGA17P were found in Colombia and several European countries (Casanovas-Massana et al., 2015; Cost\u00e1n-Longares et al., 2008; Gomila et al., 2008; Mayer et al., 2016; Payan et al., 2005; Venegas et al., 2015; Wicki et al., 2015) and BacARABA84P was identified in Switzerland (Wicki et al., 2015, 2011). CrAssphage concentrations were only determined in wastewater in the UK (Wales), Australia and the USA (Florida) (Ahmed et al., 2019a, 2018b; Farkas et al., 2018a). Due to the limited number of studies (Table 2), further testing is necessary to evaluate the prevalence and distribution of AiV, FRNAP-II, FRNAP-III, culturable phages infecting Bacteroides, crAssphage and PMMoV in untreated wastewater to assess their usefulness as indicators of wastewater pollution. Current data suggest that all assessed viral indicators, are present in untreated wastewater at high concentration and hence they are potentially good indicators for wastewater contamination.",

Fifteen of these studies exclusively used qPCR and RT-qPCR for the quantitative analysis of viral concentrations. As discussed in Section 3.1, these molecular techniques give no indication on the infectivity state of the viruses and hence may overestimate infective viral titres in untreated and treated wastewater and other environmental samples. This was demonstrated by Flannery et al. (2013) whose data showed that while infectious FRNAP-II in UV-treated effluent was approximately 2.3 log10 less than influent, only a 0.54 log10 reduction was found when using RT-qPCR alone. Most of this reduction in FRNAP-II infectivity occurred during the secondary treatment stage (1.69 log10 reduction), but the type of secondary treatment used in that study was not specified. In a study by Lee et al. (2018), an activated sludge process (a form of secondary treatment) resulted in 2.1 and 3.1 log10 reductions of infectious FRNAP-II and FRNAP-III, respectively. RT-qPCR analysis of the same samples showed log10 reductions of 1.6 and 2.5 for FRNAP-II and FRNAP-III, respectively. The differences between infectious virus and genome removal were not significant. These studies therefore reached conflicting conclusions with the former showing that infectivity studies are vital and the latter showing that they are unnecessary. It is possible that the activated sludge process used by Lee et al. (2018) resulted in physical removal of viruses, while the process used by Flannery et al. (2013) inactivated the viruses without physically removing them from the treated water. This highlights the importance of including the specific mechanisms used within a sewage treatment process when reporting such data, as it is not clear whether the secondary treatment processes in the two studies shared any mechanistic similarities.",

Tertiary treatment processes resulted in an additional 1\u20133.5 log10 removal of AdV and PyV with membrane bioreactors coupled with additional chlorination, filtration and UV treatment being the most efficient method for viral removal (Qiu et al., 2018; Rusi\u00f1ol et al., 2015; Simmons et al., 2011). Furthermore, AdVs have been shown to be more resistant to UV treatment than poliovirus, rotavirus, caliciviruses and hepatitis A virus (Hijnen et al., 2006). However, laboratory-scale studies suggest that AdVs are more susceptible to chlorine treatment than enteroviruses and caliciviruses (Cromeans et al., 2010; Kahler et al., 2010; Thurston-Enriquez et al., 2005, 2003). Interestingly, significant differences were found for the removal of PyV strains. MCV was found to be the most resistant to treatment followed by JCV and BKV (Rusi\u00f1ol et al., 2015).",

The removal of crAssphage was also in the range of 1.0\u20131.2 log10 during secondary wastewater treatment (Farkas et al., 2019), however, crAssphage removal has not been assessed during tertiary treatment yet. The current data suggests that PMMoV is stable during secondary treatment and chlorination, which results in <2 log reduction (Symonds et al., 2018). Larger PMMoV removal (>4 log) was only observed using electrocoagulation and Bardenpho (aerobic/anaerobic multi-reactor) technologies (Schmitz et al., 2016; Symonds et al., 2015). Further research is needed to evaluate the reduction of PMMoV during UV treatment and other wastewater treatment procedures to evaluate its usefulness as an indicator. The major advantage of crAssphage and PMMoV is that their concentrations are usually high in wastewater, and hence the efficiency of their removal can be easily monitored. Nonetheless, their infectivity and decay have not been investigated due to the current lack of in vitro culturing-based methods.",

Furthermore, a meta-analysis on the efficiency of secondary wastewater processes showed that activated sludge treatment resulted in 0.20\u20132.18 log10 reduction of rotavirus, and norovirus GI and GII, whereas biofiltration resulted in higher removal (1.52\u20134.30 log10) of norovirus GII and enteroviruses (Sano et al., 2016). These removal rates are higher than the removal rates determined for the indicators reviewed here suggesting that the indicators can represent the removal of the most resistant viruses. However, three studies showed higher removal rates of BKV and JCV than norovirus, sapovirus, enterovirus and rotavirus (Farkas et al., 2018a; Fumian et al., 2013; Schmitz et al., 2016) suggesting that PyVs are less resistant than the pathogenic viruses and hence should be used with caution as an indicator. Current data shows that AdV, AiV, FRNAPII/III, crAssphage and PMMoV may be suitable for the assessment of wastewater treatment processes.",

            "text": "Most research has focused on the occurrence and survival of indicator viruses in surface water. When quantified in surface freshwater bodies (lakes, rivers, streams, etc.) by qPCR, these viral indicators (e.g. AiV, AdV, JCV, PMMoV) are typically detected at up to 4 log10 higher concentrations than common enteric pathogenic viruses, e.g. norovirus, enterovirus and rotavirus (Hata et al., 2014; Jurzik et al., 2010; Rusi\u00f1ol et al., 2015; Sassi et al., 2018). All indicator concentrations in river water correlated with the distance of sampling point from the source of contamination (wastewater treatment plant), with significantly higher concentrations occurring near the wastewater treatment plant than further downstream or upstream (Ebdon et al., 2007; Farkas et al., 2018a; Prevost et al., 2015; Rusi\u00f1ol et al., 2015; Sassi et al., 2018; Sibanda and Okoh, 2012; Tandukar et al., 2018; Venegas et al., 2015; Wangkahad et al., 2017). Comparative studies showed that PMMoV occurred at higher concentration than AdV, AiV and PyV in surface water bodies in the USA (Arizona: 103-106 gc/l and Colorado: 104-105 gc/l), Germany (104-105 gc/l) and Vietnam (104-106 gc/l) (Betancourt et al., 2014; Hamza et al., 2011; Kuroda et al., 2015; Sassi et al., 2018). The concentration of AdV and AiV (up to 104 gc/l) were similar in river water collected in the USA (Colorado) and Japan (Betancourt et al., 2014; Hata et al., 2014; Sassi et al., 2018), whereas AdV was more prevalent than PyV in river water samples collected in Spain (76% vs 48% detection rates), the UK (Wales: 88% vs 65%), Japan (61% vs 11%) and Germany (79% vs 59%) (Albinana-Gimenez et al., 2009; Farkas et al., 2018a; Haramoto et al., 2010; Jurzik et al., 2010; Rusi\u00f1ol et al., 2015). However, detection rates and concentrations of AdV and JCV were similar in highly polluted rivers close to the wastewater discharge points near Barcelona, Spain (100%, 103-104 gc/l) and Rio de Janeiro, Brazil (100%, 102-105 gc/l) (Calgua et al., 2013). Taken together, our analysis shows that these indicator viruses are present in wastewater-polluted surface freshwater at high concentrations, which enables the accurate detection of the viruses and the comparative analysis of the rate of pollution (Crank et al., 2019; Zhang et al., 2019).",

FRNAP-II concentrations correlated with AdV concentrations in river water in France (Ogorzaly et al., 2009) and with AdV, norovirus, astrovirus and rotavirus in tropical freshwater samples in Singapore (Vergara et al., 2015). To date, no comparative studies have been done to compare enteric viruses and phages infecting Bacteroides spp. in surface freshwater. More research is essential on the prevalence of culturable human gut associated phages to assess their usefulness as indicators.",

AdV also had higher concentrations than PyV in seawater collected at Rio de Janeiro and Santa Caterina, Brazil (102-105 gc/l vs 101-103 gc/l), Florianopolis, Brazil (103-107 gc/l vs < 10 gc/l), North Wales (102-104 gc/l vs 102-103 gc/l), and Catalonia, Spain (101-105 gc/l vs 100-102 gc/l) (Dias et al., 2018a, Dias et al., 2018b; Farkas et al., 2018b; Moresco et al., 2012; Rusi\u00f1ol et al., 2015).

BacGB124P, BacRYC 2056P and BacGA17P were also found in seawater at concentrations up to 104 pfu/l (Olalemi et al., 2016), however, these concentrations were not compared with enteric viruses.

In general, FRNAP-I has been found to be the most persistent followed by FRNAP-II, FRNAP-III and then FRNAP-IV. Using simulated sunlight, Flannery et al. (2013) studied the effect of solar radiation on the persistence of FRNAP-II and norovirus in seawater. The reductions in RT-qPCR detectable viruses was similar for norovirus and FRNAP-II under both summer and winter sunlight conditions. However, it took between 81% and 88% longer for a 90% reduction in RT-qPCR detectable FRNAP-II than for infectious FRNAP-II. This highlights again the need to consider infectivity when studying viral persistence in the environment. Brion et al. (2002) also studied the survival of different FRNAP genogroups in surface water. Environmental isolates of FRNAP-II had the highest variability in survival between isolates, while FRNAP-III had the lowest variability in survival between isolates. They concluded that FRNAP-III is suited to determining whether there had been recent contamination to a water body by human faeces. In contrast, FRNAP-II was more suited to indicating contamination by distant or sporadic human source contamination.",

AdVs have shown 1\u20132 log10 reduction in infectivity in raw and sterilised groundwater and surface water over 120\u2013180 days (Ogorzaly et al., 2010; Rigotto et al., 2011). In seawater, the decrease of viral infectivity was more rapid than in groundwater, with 1.2\u20131.4 log10 AdV reductions in 28 days (Enriquez et al., 1995) and sunlight significantly enhancing degradation at a rate of at least 2 log10 reduction per day (Liang et al., 2017). AdVs were more stable in groundwater and surface water than poliovirus, rotavirus and hepatitis A virus (El-Senousy et al., 2014; Enriquez et al., 1995). Ogorzaly et al. (2010) showed that AdV persists for longer in ground water than both MS2 (FRNAP-I) and GA phages (FRNAP-II). This difference in survival and persistence was greatly increased with an increase in temperature from 4 \u00b0C to 20 \u00b0C. These studies highlight the stability of AdV compared to other viruses, however, these studies were conducted in laboratory experiments and the viral stability may differ in field conditions.",

In contrast, crAssphage proved to be as persistent as AdV and PyV in coastal bathing water (Ahmed et al., 2019b). The temporal decay of AiV, PMMoV and culturable bacteriophages infecting Bacteroides is not yet known and should be investigated and compared with AdV decay to determine their usefulness as indicators.

AiV and PMMoV also showed stable titres in treated and untreated wastewater over a year (Iaconelli et al., 2016; Kitajima et al., 2014; Myrmel et al., 2015; Schmitz et al., 2016), however, peak concentrations for AiV were noted in wastewater in Japan during winter and spring (Kitajima et al., 2013). PMMoV showed no seasonality in river water either (Haramoto et al., 2013; Rosario et al., 2009). Higher AdV concentrations were observed in treated wastewater collected in Wales during summer than in winter and spring, which was most likely due to dry weather and a transient increase in population due to tourism in the summer months (Farkas et al., 2018b). Furthermore, higher AdV concentrations were detected in untreated wastewater in Norway during January\u2013March compared to the concentrations observed during April\u2013December (Myrmel et al., 2015). The prevalence of AdV was also higher during autumn-winter than during the spring-summer in wastewater collected in Egypt (Elmahdy et al., 2019). Similarly, AdVs were detected at low concentrations during the summer and autumn months in river water samples collected in Japan and in Germany, respectively (Hamza et al., 2009b; Kishida et al., 2012), probably due to dry weather conditions. Overall, these findings suggest that the indicators are detectable and quantifiable throughout the year, which enables the continuous evaluation of wastewater contamination. The current data imply that precipitation has more effect on viral loads than temporal changes in the number of infections. Nonetheless, this should be further investigated by comparing epidemiological data, viral loads in wastewater and precipitation over several years.",

The major advantage of enteric viral indicators (AdV, PyV, AiV) is that they are human specific, hence their use as indicators enables us to track human-derived contamination exclusively. In addition, crAssphages and other phages, which infect commensal bacteria associated with human gut, and PMMoV, which is a plant virus accumulating in the human gut due to the consumption of infected plant-derived food, are also associated primarily with domestic wastewater contamination. A major advantage of phages and PMMoV is that they are not infectious to humans and hence their detection and culturing in the laboratory pose no risk of infection to the operators. FRNAP-II and FRNAP-III have also been shown to be useful in determining human sources of viral contamination due to their prevalence in human waste. However, due to the non-specific nature of their natural E. coli hosts, it is not certain what the reason is for the specific prevalence in human waste relative to FRNAP-I and FRNAP-IV. As such, it is unclear how well these can be applied globally and indeed how stable that relationship is.",

The infectivity of FRNAP can be easily studied using a simple and rapid plaque assay. Furthermore, the infectivity state of AdV can also be monitored using ICC-qPCR. Infectivity assays are also available for PyV, AiV and crAssphage, however, the usefulness of those assays in environmental setting have not been critically evaluated. Furthermore, there are emerging technologies, such as isothermal amplification, biosensors and microfluidics approaches, which may be useful for the routine monitoring of viruses in the environment (Farkas et al., 2020). In some cases, these may offer the potential for near real-time reporting of viral concentrations in water, however, their applicability still needs to be critically evaluated from a scientific, practical and economic perspective. This is particularly the case for in situ devices where biofouling, cross-reactivity and sensor drift represent major problems when translating technologies developed in the laboratory to the field (Lin and Li, 2020).",
