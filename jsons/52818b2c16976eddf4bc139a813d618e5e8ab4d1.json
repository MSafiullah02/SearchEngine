This task will become increasingly monumental as the virus rapidly multiplies within communities. It will be critical for health care organizations to use a standardized, robust, and clear communication strategy to notify and guide patients in the ambulatory setting. Each organization will need to identify a disclosure team with the capacity to respond rapidly to clinical questions about symptoms and prognosis; to instruct patients on containment strategies; to provide supportive responses to emotional distress; to help patients and their families connect with resources they need to adhere to recommendations such as wearing masks, self-quarantine, and diagnostic testing; and to systematically track and notify at-risk patients and those proximally associated with them.",

As a first step, a system for tracking exposed patients and family members should be created and staff should be assigned to investigate the details of the actual exposure. These details should then be entered into the tracker to facilitate a smooth disclosure process. Key elements to include regarding the exposed patient or family member are their name, phone number, date of birth, medical record number, demographic information, preferred language, contact information, history of prior covid-19 exposure, and documented or reported covid-19 testing and results. For the source of the exposure, elements to include are the individual's title/role and the date they were identified as positive. Information should be tracked regarding the location and the date of the exposure event and the last day of the incubation period. Finally, all aspects of the outreach process should be tracked and then documented in the electronic health record, from the time of first outreach, to the modality used (e.g., email, phone), to the final outcome. At our institution, to avoid further exposure and facilitate rapid disclosure (i.e., within 24 hours of the exposure), phone calls are the preferred means of communication. Use of interpreters, notification of the patients' primary care doctor, activation of social work, and any other interactions with other services should also be noted.",
