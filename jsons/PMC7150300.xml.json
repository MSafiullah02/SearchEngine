Suddenly, the efforts and time that man had spent in hunting and gathering food were no longer necessary as domestic animals provided a continuous source of food supply. The process of domestication spread across Asia, Europe, and North Africa during the Neolithic \u2018agricultural revolution\u2019. This was a significant breakthrough in human history and played a fundamental role in the development of most modern societies. Today, domestic animals represent one of the major sources of proteins for a significant portion of the world\u2019s population.",

However, in general, domestic animal species are raised in relatively small (and usually confined) spaces at a higher density than their feral counterparts. This is particularly true today in the industrialized countries where modern intensive farming brings, in some cases, thousands of animals together in the same location. Thus, domestication has given plenty of opportunities to pathogens, such as bacteria and viruses, to emerge and establish themselves in new populations. Moreover, national and international trade of farm animals amplifies the spread of infectious diseases.",

For example, the estimated direct cost to agriculture and the food industry of the 2001 foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) outbreak in Great Britain was around \u00a33 billion (British pounds; approximately US$6 billion), but the indirect costs to other businesses such as tourism were estimated to be another \u00a33 billion.",

Soon afterward it was clear that not all diseases were caused by bacteria and the existence of a new class of submicroscopic microorganisms appeared in the scientific arena. In 1898 Friedrich Loeffler and Paul Frosch, two former students of Robert Koch, first demonstrated that an animal disease could be caused by \u2018ultrafilterable agents\u2019. Working on FMD, Loeffler and Frost collected fluid from vesicular lesions of affected animals and filtered it through bacteria-proof filter candles, hoping that the infectious agent would be retained in the filter. To their surprise, calves inoculated with the filtrate developed FMD lesions. Subsequent studies allowed them to rule out the possibility of a bacterial etiology, and thus foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV) became the first virus of vertebrates to be discovered (tobacco mosaic virus of plants had been discovered by Ivanovski in 1892). These landmark studies were published between 1897 and 1898. It should be noted that at the end of the nineteenth century, FMD was causing a large number of outbreaks in Germany and the magnitude of the problem was such that in 1893 the Prussian Ministry of Agriculture offered a prize of 3000 reichmarks for the person who could identify the cause of the disease. After 2 years of fruitless efforts by a number of different applicants, a research commission was established to systematically investigate FMD. About 55 000 reichmarks were invested in this venture and soon paid off with the results obtained by Loeffler and Frosch. Because of the highly contagious nature of the disease, in 1909 Loeffler had to move to an island in the Baltic Sea, Insel Reims, in order to continue studying FMD. Thus, despite the recent FMD incidents in the United Kingdom, the awareness of biosecurity against devastating animal diseases was already well developed a century ago.",

Cattle plague (or rinderpest) is a disease that devastated livestock for hundreds of years in Europe until the nineteenth century. In the previous century, the consequences of cattle plague were so serious that Pope Clement XI instructed his physician, Giovanni Maria Lancisi, to develop measures to control the disease. Lancisi\u2019s recommendations included the destruction of all ill and suspect animals followed by their burial in lime. The first veterinary school was opened in Lyon specifically to teach Lancisi\u2019s principles. Today, we apply sanitary measures remarkably similar to those devised by Lancisi to avoid the spread of transmissible diseases: quarantine, animal movement restrictions, and culling of affected animals. The effectiveness of these measures is illustrated by the fact that rinderpest was eliminated from Europe prior to the discovery of its causative agent. Thus, Lancisi is correctly recognized as the first hygienist in history.\n",

            "text": "Some historical diseases are indirectly linked to domestic animals, although only directly affecting humans. Smallpox has been one of the greatest scourges of humankind. The origins of variola virus (VARV), the etiologic agent of smallpox, are uncertain but it is speculated that VARV derives from an ancestral poxvirus that affected animals during the early agricultural settlements in Asia or Africa. Interestingly, the closest relative of VARV is camelpox virus (CMLV). Despite its long history of terrifying lethality, smallpox is the first (and so far only) viral disease that has been globally eradicated, thanks to a very effective vaccine campaign. The basis of this achievement can be traced back to the end of the eighteenth century when Edward Jenner (1749\u20131823) laid the foundations of modern vaccinology. In Jenner\u2019s time, it was a popular belief that cowpox protected against smallpox, since dairymaids were immune to the disease. A physician himself, Jenner combined folk knowledge, comparative medicine (cowpox lesions in cattle were similar to those in people affected by smallpox), and hypothesis-driven research to carry out one of the most significant experiments in microbiology: he inoculated a number of people with material from cowpox lesions and further challenged them by variolation (a procedure that consisted in blowing dried smallpox scabs into the nose of an individual). Variolated individuals usually contracted a mild form of the disease, but the group treated by Jenner did not show any reaction, demonstrating that cowpox infection was protective against smallpox. This procedure marked the beginning of a new era in medicine. Despite initial resistance to Jenner\u2019s methods, vaccination as a strategy to prevent smallpox and later other infectious diseases was rapidly accepted. Pasteur developed the first attenuated vaccine against a disease of chickens (chicken cholera caused by Pasteurella multocida) and also produced vaccines against two lethal zoonoses: anthrax and rabies. Linked to the success of the smallpox vaccination was the development of a vaccine against tuberculosis. Bovine tuberculosis (Figure 1(a)) was first recognized in 1854 and Robert Koch subsequently determined that Mycobacterium bovis, the cause of bovine tuberculosis, could be differentiated from Mycobacterium tuberculosis, the cause of human tuberculosis. This led to the speculation that a successful vaccine for human tuberculosis (TB) could be generated by employing the same strategy that was successful for smallpox. However, early attempts at using freshly isolated M. bovis strains were unsuccessful as these were as virulent as M. tuberculosis. The veterinary influence in producing an effective vaccine against TB was evident in the work of Camille Gu\u00e9rin, a veterinarian, and Albert Calmette, a physician, who together produced the M. bovis BCG (Bacille Calmette\u2013Gu\u00e9rin) vaccine strain. This was a highly passaged strain with negligible virulence, which took over 13 years to develop and was finally ready for use in 1921. To this day, over 200 years after Jenner\u2019s pioneer studies, vaccination constitutes our best tool to fight infectious diseases of both domestic animals and man.",

In those pioneer studies, tumors were transmitted to animals by means of cell-free filtrates. Vilhelm Ellerman and Olaf Bang discovered that a virus caused erythroleukemia in chickens (1908), while Peyton Rous showed that sarcomas in chickens also had a viral etiology (1911). At the time, unfortunately, those studies did not receive the credit they deserved, as leukemias were not regarded as cancer and chickens were not considered a relevant animal model for the study of human diseases. In the 1950s Howard Temin and Harry Rubin developed an assay (focus assay) to quantify Rous sarcoma virus (RSV, the virus discovered by Rous) in tissue culture (Figure 1(b)). This assay revolutionized the study of RSV because it demonstrated the link between the biological activity of a single infectious viral particle and a single cell. Later, RSV was found to contain a cell-derived gene (\u2018oncogene\u2019) that was sufficient to induce cell transformation. This was a major discovery as it highlighted that the DNA of the cells held the \u2018secret\u2019 of cancer. Thus, the genetic origin of cancer was discovered by studying chicken viruses. The RSV oncogene, v-src, was both the first oncogene and the first tyrosine kinase to be discovered and this had enormous repercussions, contributing to the foundation of entire disciplines such as signal transduction.",

Bj\u00f6rn Sigurdsson, an Icelandic physician, coined the term \u2018slow diseases\u2019 after studying a group of diseases of sheep that affected the Icelandic flocks in the 1930s\u201340s. In 1933 Iceland introduced a small number of rams from Germany to improve their genetic stock. Despite observing quarantine measures, the imported rams introduced at least three different diseases onto the island: ovine pulmonary adenocarcinoma (OPA), paratuberculosis, and Maedi-visna. Another disease of sheep, scrapie, was also included in this group of diseases although it was probably imported to the island before 1933. The geographical and epidemiological circumstances of the outbreaks allowed Sigurdsson to develop the concept that an infectious agent can cause disease after a very long incubation period that can last from several months to years (slow diseases). This concept has had enormous influence on the study and control of infectious diseases.",

This group of diseases, named after the typical \u2018spongious\u2019 appearance of the neurons of affected animals, includes human Kuru, TSE of mink, and chronic wasting disease of deer represented a fascinating biological enigma that led to the postulation of the prion theory. Stanley Prusiner hypothesized that an infectious protein, devoid of nucleic acid, was the cause of TSEs and was awarded the Nobel Prize in 1997 for his studies. In humans, Kuru was initially described by Carleton Gajdusek and Vincent Zigas, who were working in Papua Guinea with the Fore tribe. Gajdusek was the first to link the occurrence of the disease with the cannibalistic rituals of the tribe, in particular with the consumption of the brains of affected people. Although scrapie had been known for a long time before the first description of Kuru, the initial connection between these two diseases was made by a veterinarian, William Hadlow, who recognized that the lesions observed in neurons of individuals affected by Kuru were strikingly similar to those of sheep affected by scrapie.",

Wild aquatic birds are considered the primary hosts of influenza virus A, the causative agent of flu. Influenza virus usually replicates in the intestinal tract of these birds, causes no disease, and is transmitted by fecal contamination of water. Occasionally, such viruses establish stable lineages in land-based birds and a limited number of mammalian species including swine, horses, dogs, and humans. The H5N1 subtype of avian flu currently poses a pandemic threat: it has caused large outbreaks of the disease among bird populations in Southeast Asia, and the number of human cases reached almost 400 at the beginning of 2008.",

ASFV possesses two distinct lipid membranes: an external one, obtained from the cellular membrane during budding, and an internal one that surrounds the inner core of the particle and is likely derived from the endoplasmic reticulum of the infected cell. Depending on environmental factors, ASF displays two distinct epidemiological patterns: a sylvatic and a domestic cycle. The former takes place in southern and eastern Africa and consists of the infections of wild pigs and soft ticks. Infection is likely to occur in the burrows used by these animals. It is estimated that up to 25% of the soft tick population in southern and eastern Africa is infected with ASFV. Ticks become infected after a blood meal on an infected wild pig. Infected ticks can transmit virus to other ticks and to their offspring, as well as to wild pigs at each blood meal. This cycle can take place multiple times along the lifespan of a tick as they can live for several years. In warthogs, seroepidemiological studies have shown that ASF is widely distributed.

In domestic swine, the incubation period ranges from 5 to 15 days, and the clinical features of ASF include fever (41\u201342 \u00b0C for about 4 days), diarrhea, inappetence, incoordination, prostration, coma, and death. Vomiting, nasal and conjunctival discharge, dyspnea, and anal and nasal hemorrhages can also be observed in some animals. Abortion is common in affected sows. In regions where the disease is exotic, mortality rates often reach 100% with an average survival time between 2 and 9 days. In endemic areas, ASF cases can be predominantly subclinical and persistent. Pathological findings are typically observed in the lymphatic and vascular systems and include widespread hemorrhages in spleen, lymph nodes, kidneys, and the gastrointestinal and respiratory tracts (Figure 3). Leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, B and T cell lymphopenia, together with apoptosis of mononuclear cells and lymphocytes, is also common. Death probably occurs as a result of extensive necrosis in conjunction with hemostatic and hemodynamic changes. In subacute forms of the disease, hemorrhages are not as prominent as in acute cases and typical symptoms include loss of condition, swelling of the joints, as well as respiratory and cardiac signs. In chronic cases lesions include cutaneous ulcers, pericarditis, pneumonia, arthritis, and pleuritis. Animals that survive the infection develop protective immunity. Because ASF clinical signs are similar to other swine diseases, in particular to CSF, laboratory diagnosis is essential. Viral isolation and antigen detection can be readily done on samples from spleen, visceral lymph nodes, and blood.\n",

Countries that are free of the disease maintain such status by banning the importation of pigs or pig-derived products from endemic countries. Introduction of ASF in an uninfected country requires rapid and effective measures of control, such as slaughter of affected and in-contact animals, control of swine movement within and across affected regions, prohibition of feeding with waste food, and fumigation of infested facilities if soft ticks are prevalent in the affected area. Currently, there is no available vaccine. Measures to control the disease include quarantine and slaughter of affected animals.",

In countries where the disease is enzootic, indigenous breeds seem to be more resistant to the infection than exotic ones. The presence of sheeppox and goatpox in a region affects animal trading, and hence their economical importance. After an incubation period of 4\u20138 days, infected animals show a variety of clinical signs that include high body temperature, nasal discharge, hypersensitivity, and arched back. Appearance of typical pox lesions (Figure 4) such as macules and papules takes place a couple of days after the onset of the initial signs and can cover the entire body. Notably, nodular lesions in a variety of organs such as abomasum, trachea, and lungs are common. In the skin, SPV infection results in marked changes in the epidermis, hypodermis, and dermis. Both diseases are clinically comparable; they are serologically indistinguishable from one another and highly contagious. Transmission occurs by direct contact between infected and susceptible animals. Transmission via aerosol, insect vectors, and contaminated objects is also suspected. Virus is present in milk and nasal secretions, and it can also be recovered from lung, skin, liver, and lymph nodes. In endemic countries, live attenuated and inactivated vaccines are commonly used.\n",

The disease is classified into four forms of different severity: the horse sickness fever, the subacute (or cardiac) form, the cardio-pulmonary form, and the peracute (or pulmonary) form. Susceptible horses most often display the cardio-pulmonary or the peracute form of AHS with a very high mortality rate, while donkeys usually display the milder clinical forms of the disease. Histopathological and clinical signs are the result of an increased permeability of the capillary walls and vasculitis of both small and medium-sized blood vessels. Diagnosis of AHS is traditionally based on virus isolation and virus neutralization for serotyping.

In contrast, infection with lentogenic viruses results in subclinical infections or at most a mild respiratory presentation. Mesogenic NDV exhibits an intermediate phenotype, with moderate respiratory disease and occasionally neurological signs. Although clinical signs depend on the age and the immune status of infected animals, symptoms such as dyspnea, clonic muscular gasping, and cyanosis of comb and wattles are suggestive of the disease and usually appear after an incubation period of around 5 days. Other signs include weakness, loss of appetite, and somnolence. When the nervous system is involved, typical symptoms include paralysis of wings or legs (or both), ataxia, torticollis, clonic spasms, and abnormal movements of the head. Signs of infection by viscerotropic NDV are foamy mucus in the pharynx, crop dilatation, and diarrhea. Egg production is immediately affected and eggs from infected animals exhibit a decrease in the quality of albumen together with loss or depigmentation of the shell. Given the relatively nonspecific clinical signs and the epidemiological importance of NDV, viral isolation (usually from brains, spleen, or lungs) and serological assays are required for diagnosis.\n",

Avirulent strains exhibit minimal basic residues at the cleavage sites, and hence only proteases present in the respiratory or intestinal tract can cleave them.
