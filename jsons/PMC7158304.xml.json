The human testis continuously produces highly differentiated sperm derived from a pool of spermatogonial stem cells at a level of productivity and complexity matched only by the hematopoietic system. In contrast to the hematopoietic tissues, however, differentiated sperm first appear at the time of sexual maturation, long after the maturation of the immune system and the establishment of systemic immune tolerance (Figure 19.1\n).1 In humans, the period between the editing of the lymphocyte repertoire and the first appearance of significant numbers of the earliest premeiotic germ cell (the spermatocytes) is generally more than 10 years. As a consequence, spermatogenic cells express many cell-specific proteins and other molecules that have the potential to be seen as \u201cforeign\u201d or \u201cnonself\u201d by the immune system.",

            "text": "We know that the immune system tends to view spermatogenic cells as foreign because of the relatively high incidence of autoimmune infertility among human populations. Even in developed countries with modern health care, sperm autoantibodies represent 5\u201310% of all male infertility,2., 3. while testicular biopsies from infertile men frequently display evidence of asymptomatic inflammatory reactions.4., 5. In other forms of autoimmune disease, such as type 1 diabetes or gastritis, the development of autoimmunity is due to disruption of the normal regulatory controls of the immune system, leading to reactions against antigens that normally are ignored. Only a limited number of antigens are involved and a specific dominant autoantigen usually has been identified.6 In the case of the male reproductive tract, by contrast, autoimmunity generally involves antigens that would not be edited out of the self-reactive repertoire in the first place. Hence, autoimmune infertility generally involves multiple antigens as well as different antigens from one individual to another.7., 8., 9. Moreover, infertility is not the only urological problem with an immunological basis. Chronic pelvic inflammatory disease in men, which may be accompanied by recurrent and even debilitating perineal or scrotal pain, is a serious and frequently intractable condition.10., 11., 12. Infections may represent the initial cause of the majority of such cases, but the underlying mechanisms almost certainly involve an autoimmune component.10\n",

In most respects, the immune system within the male reproductive tract appears relatively normal, with effective lymphatic drainage and relatively free access of immune cells.13., 14. Certainly, there are some unique structural characteristics of the male reproductive tract that may contribute. For example, the male gametes are held at a substantially lower temperature than the rest of the body in species with scrotal testes and epididymides. There also exists a very effective blood\u2013testis barrier that sequesters most of the spermatogenic cells in the testis.15., 16., 17., 18. Nonetheless, these physical elements cannot account for all the manifestations of immunological protection in the male reproductive tract.",

There are communication and regulatory networks that are common to both male reproduction and the immune system, providing many striking overlaps between the control of spermatogenesis and the processes of inflammation and immune activation. Part of this network includes local immunoregulatory and immunosuppressive mechanisms, which exist to provide protection for the endogenous antigens of spermatogenesis, protection that also extends to antigens expressed by foreign grafts inserted into the testis environment.19 Immune cells that enter the environment of the male reproductive tract become functionally modified to restrict their proinflammatory activity and provide an immunologically constrained environment where antigen-specific immune responses are closely controlled. Balanced against this, of course, is the question of how the male reproductive tract is able to protect itself from recurrent infections and tumor development under these circumstances.",

Many systemic illnesses are accompanied by a reduction in both serum androgen levels and sperm output, indicating that male sexual function and general well-being maintain a reciprocal relationship. It has been suggested that this represents a physiologically important mechanism, having evolved to limit reproductive activity during periods of illness. The possibility that acute inflammatory dysregulation of male reproductive function can lead to more permanent problems, such as autoimmune infertility or chronic inflammatory disease, also must be considered. It may even be the case that pre-existing hypogonadism predisposes men to inflammatory disease. At a fundamental level, the ability of the immune system and the male reproductive system to co-exist is no less essential to male reproductive success than the normal operation of the hypothalamic-pituitary unit or the critical interactions between somatic cells and spermatogenic cells. The use of the term immunophysiology in this context highlights the fact that the immunology and basic physiology of male reproduction cannot actually be separated.",

Inflammation of the testis and its association with mumps parotitis was known in ancient times, having been described in the writings of Hippocrates (c. 460\u2013377 BC). Studies on the transplantation of testes in domestic chickens, generally considered to be the earliest studies in the field of endocrinology, were undertaken in the eighteenth century by Hunter and by Michaelis (cited by Setchell, 1990),25 although the first systematic experiments actually were reported by Berthold in 1849.26 \u201cSuccessful\u201d transplants of mammalian testes had to wait until some time later.27., 28., 29. In the early part of the last century prior to the discovery of the male sex hormone, testosterone, transplantation of male gonads, including transplants of animal gonads into humans, was undertaken by charlatans and serious researchers alike in the search for treatments to increase male health and virility.30., 31. It was quickly noted that, although the function of the interstitial tissue appeared to continue in these transplant experiments, tubule function was not preserved.32 While there is no doubt that temperature and revascularization issues were important limitations, it is now obvious that many of these experiments faced a crucial immunological impediment. Even today, grafts of testicular tissue generally are more successful in an immunologically compatible or immunocompromised host.33 The concept of immunoregulation entered the story with the discovery that allogeneic testicular grafts could be made to survive much more successfully if tolerance had been induced by injection of the donor allogeneic cells at the time of birth in the donor,34 or when transferred into the anterior chamber of the eye.35., 36. Sometime later, Billingham and others conducted a series of investigations into so-called immunologically privileged sites that led to recognition of the testis as a tissue that was particularly favorable for graft survival.37\n",

Further experimental evidence confirming the possibility of autoimmune reactions against the sperm led to a general acceptance that these are an important cause of infertility in men.2., 45. In time, this led to the broader concept that the testis environment must provide protection for the spermatogenic cells through specific regulatory mechanisms.",

Gender differences in health and the greater prevalence, earlier onset, and severity of autoimmune diseases, such as systemic lupus erythematosus and rheumatoid arthritis, among women had been recognized long before a real understanding of autoimmunity existed.46., 47. A specific effect of the testes on the immune system was reported as early as 1898 by Calzolari,48 when he found that castration of rabbits prior to puberty led to an increase or maintenance of the size of the thymus. This effect has been repeatedly confirmed and extended to include cell-mediated immunity and graft survival.49., 50. Many studies have shown that various immunological processes have gender-specific differences or can be affected by castration and/or sex steroid replacement. These data clearly established that products of the testis, and sex steroids in particular, regulate the immune system either directly or indirectly, setting the stage for the modern era of male reproductive immunophysiology.",

The testis is enclosed by a fibrous capsule, but there is considerable species variation in the connective tissue of the testicular parenchyma. In the human, the testis is physically partitioned by connective tissue septa into discrete lobules containing the loops of the seminiferous tubules, which connect at both ends to the rete testis located along one pole of the testis.51 The products of the seminiferous tubules are collected by the rete testis and transferred to the adjacent epididymis, which is connected to the rete testis via a series of efferent ducts. The testes of rodent species, such as rat and mouse, comprise only very loose connective tissue with no distinct septa separating the seminiferous tubules.52 The interstitial tissue completely surrounds the seminiferous tubules (Figure 19.2\n), and contains the vasculature, lymphatic vessels, and nerves of the testis. The testicular blood supply arises from the abdominal aorta, and this produces a comparatively long and highly coiled spermatic artery that is particularly susceptible to physical insult and torsion in species with scrotal testes. The arterioles, capillaries, and venules of the testis thoroughly permeate the interstitial tissue surrounding the seminiferous tubules and rete testis. Consequently, these structures are close to an effective blood supply at all times in spite of the completely avascular nature of the spermatogenic compartment.",

Immune cells are occasionally seen within this boundary layer.71 The Sertoli cell provides the structural framework for the organization of the seminiferous epithelium, but also plays a crucial role in supporting and directing the development of the spermatogenic cells. Adjacent Sertoli cells and spermatogenic cells maintain intimate contact at all times, with junctional and membrane specializations providing physical contact and communication.72 At the time of puberty, cohorts of mitotically dividing spermatogonia begin to enter meiosis at regular intervals, moving away from the periphery of the tubule and becoming spermatocytes. Meiosis produces haploid round spermatids, which subsequently undergo considerable structural differentiation to become mature or elongated spermatids. Once these cells are released by the Sertoli cell into the tubule lumen they are called spermatozoa and fluid secreted by the Sertoli cells sweeps the released spermatozoa toward the rete testis.",

Pregnenolone diffuses out of the mitochondrion to the smooth endoplasmic reticulum, where it may be converted to progesterone by 3\u03b2-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase/\u03944-\u03945 isomerase (HSD3\u03b2). Pregnenolone and progesterone are first metabolized to their 17\u03b1-hydroxy forms and then to the weak androgens, dehydroepiandrosterone and androstenedione, respectively, by the action of steroid 17\u03b1-hydroxylase/17,20 lyase (CYP17A). Finally, androstenedione is converted to testosterone by the action of hydroxysteroid (17\u03b2) dehydrogenase (HSD17\u03b2), and dehydroepiandrosterone is converted to androstenediol and then testosterone, by the sequential actions of HSD17\u03b2 and HSD3\u03b2. Testosterone is secreted from the Leydig cell and serves as the principal androgen in both the testis and circulation.",

Consequently, spermatogenesis can tolerate even relatively large declines in testicular androgen production with relatively minor losses of efficiency. In contrast, peripheral levels of androgens are critical; even small reductions can have profound effects on many androgen-dependent functions, including accessory gland function, secondary sex characteristics, and libido.81 Peripheral androgen levels are dependent upon both Leydig cell production and testicular vascular function, so that interference with the vasculature of the testis can alter circulating testosterone levels quite significantly.82 Conversion of testosterone and androstenedione to estrogens by the cytochrome P450 enzyme aromatase (CYP19A) in the Leydig cell and Sertoli cell is also required for normal development and function of the efferent ducts and epididymis.83\n",

Neither system operates in isolation and many of the cellular and molecular mechanisms overlap (Figure 19.4\n).

These receptors are functionally related to the interleukin-1 (IL1) receptor (IL1R), with which they share a conserved cytoplasmic domain called the Toll/IL1R (TIR) domain.106., 112. Activation of the TLRs involves receptor dimerization and interaction of the TIR domain with an intracellular TIR domain-containing adaptor protein (Figure 19.5\n). In the case of all the TLRs, except TLR3, the adaptor protein is myeloid differentiation primary-response protein 88 (MYD88), which signals via IL1 receptor-associated kinase (IRAK) and tumor necrosis factor (TNF) receptor-associated factor 6 (TRAF6). This leads to activation of the p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK14) and Jun N-terminal kinase (MAPK8), and nuclear translocation of the transcription factors, nuclear factor kappa B (NF\u03baB), and activated protein-1 (AP-1).113., 114. This, in turn, induces expression of genes encoding the key pro-inflammatory cytokines and mediators, including both IL1\u03b1 and \u03b2 forms (IL1\u03b1 and IL1\u03b2), TNF, IL6, IL8 (C-X-C motif ligand 8; CXCL8), IL12, inducible nitric oxide synthase (NOS2) and prostaglandin-endoperoxide synthase 2 (PTGS2; cyclooxygenase 2; Table 19.2\n).115., 116. In addition, TLR3 and TLR4 interact with the adaptor protein, TIR domain-containing adaptor molecule 1 (TICAM1), to activate TRAF3 and the transcription factor, interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF3), resulting in production of the type 1 interferons (IFN\u03b1 and IFN\u03b2).115 Some of the NLRs, which detect various bacterial PAMPs within the cytosol, likewise exert their actions via activation of NF\u03baB and the MAP kinases, but a subset of the NLRs work by induction of the cysteine protease, caspase-1 (CASP1; interleukin-1\u03b2 converting enzyme), through assembly of a large intracellular protein complex called the inflammasome.117., 118. Inflammasomes are generically composed of a pattern-recognition domain-containing protein, an adaptor molecule bearing a caspase activation and recruitment domain (CARD), and CASP1 itself, which activates the key pro-inflammatory cytokines, IL1\u03b2 and IL18, by processing their inactive precursors (Figure 19.5).118 These complexes are activated by various PAMPs and DAMPs, including bacterial toxins, viral RNA, and particulates, such as silica and uric acid crystals. Activation of the pattern-recognition receptors leads to functional activation of immune cells and sets the inflammatory response in train.",

On B cells, these receptors are surface-bound immunoglobulins, from which are derived the circulating antibodies. The core proteins of the T-cell receptor (TCR) are structurally related to the immunoglobulins, but the TCR itself is a complex of interacting surface proteins.127 The diversity of these receptors involves extensive rearrangements of the basic immunoglobulin and TCR gene regions, which produce randomly reassembled genes encoding proteins, each with a very specific and unique topography.128., 129. Each precursor T cell and B cell expresses a surface receptor that is specific for a unique antigenic determinant and all their offspring (clones) will express the same receptor and specificity. B cells interact more or less directly with the antigenic molecule in situ. However, more precise regulation of the immune response involving T cells is determined by proteins of the highly polymorphic major histocompatibility complex (MHC), expressed on the surface of antigen-presenting cells.130 Almost all cells in the body can act as antigen-presenting cells by proteolytically converting intracellular proteins, of either endogenous or infectious (e.g. viral) origin, into short antigenic peptides, which are then incorporated into a structural groove on the extracellular surface of the MHC protein complex during its assembly in the endoplasmic reticulum.131 Some antigen-presenting cells (dendritic cells and macrophages) are able to phagocytose exogenous proteins, typically proteins of pathogenic origin, but also proteins derived from endogenous sources including the spermatogenic cells, and process these proteins for antigen-MHC complex formation. The TCR subsequently binds to the antigen-MHC complex on the surface of the antigen-presenting cell leading to the activation and proliferation of the T cell (Figure 19.6\n).",

Activation of the T cell requires physical interaction between co-stimulatory ligand-receptor pairs, particularly CD28:B7 (CD80/CD86) and CD40:CD40 ligand (CD40LG), and production of either type 1 cytokines [IL2, IL12 and interferon-\u03b3 (IFN\u03b3)] or type 2 cytokines (IL4, IL5, IL10 and IL13; Figure 19.6).134., 135.

They can be activated by pro-inflammatory cytokines, notably IL12 and antiviral type 1 interferons.145 They interact with their targets via a complex of stimulatory and inhibitory surface receptors, which allow them to recognize ligands uniquely expressed by transformed cells and to detect the lack of MHC class I expression, a characteristic of transformed cells.144., 146. Accordingly, NK cells are able to rapidly mobilize against pathogenic challenges long before T- and B-cell responses can develop. However, activated NK cells also participate in the adaptive immune response. They possess antigen-specific receptors, similar to cytotoxic CD8+ T cells, and have been shown to regulate dendritic cell responses in a positive or negative manner, for example, by inducing dendritic cell death through contact-mediated lysis or by producing immunoregulatory cytokines, such as IFN\u03b3, IL4, and TGF\u03b2.144., 147.\n",

Central tolerance occurs primarily in the thymus, during normal development, when expression of antigens by the thymic epithelium leads to functional deletion of self-reactive T cells by inactivation and apoptosis.1 A similar mechanism mediates B-cell editing in the bone marrow.151 It is now recognized that this process involves the promiscuous expression of many tissue-specific antigens in the thymic epithelium induced by the transcription factor, autoimmune regulator (AIRE).152 Even sperm-specific antigens have been found to be expressed in the thymus under this mechanism.153 However, this mechanism is not completely efficacious because autoreactive lymphocytes persist and may expand or become activated later in life, resulting in autoimmune disease.154., 155.\n",

Peripheral tolerance involves functional deletion of autoreactive lymphocytes in the peripheral (secondary) lymphoid tissues due to weak antigen-stimulation in the absence of appropriate co-stimulation, production of blocking and anti-idiotypic antibodies, and development of antigen-specific regulatory and suppressor lymphocytes.139., 156. This involves an ongoing process of low-dose exposure of these cells to their antigen, accompanied by either modified co-stimulatory or specific immunoregulatory signals from antigen-presenting cells, regulatory lymphocytes, or other cell types in the vicinity.157 This means, for example, that engagement of the peptide-MHC class II complex with the TCR in the absence of linkage of CD80/CD86 to CD28, in the presence of immunoregulatory cytokines, such as IL10 or TGF\u03b2, or engagement by CD80/86 of the inhibitory T cell receptor, CTLA4, in place of CD28, leads to T-cell deletion by inactivation or apoptosis, and/or induction of regulatory/suppressor T-cell activity (Figure 19.6).140., 158. The best characterized, and arguably the most important, of these regulatory lymphocytes is the CD4+CD25+ regulatory T cell (Treg) subset, which expresses the transcription factor, FOXP3.140 These cells can be induced by TGF\u03b2 and IL2, and selectively produce immunoregulatory TGF\u03b2 and IL10, but also appear to act via direct contact with antigen-presenting cells and other T cell subsets.159., 160. Both NK cells and NK T cells are also capable of antigen-recognition and immunosuppressive activity. Other T cell subsets implicated in immunosuppression through their ability to produce TGF\u03b2 and IL10 include Th3 cells, Tr1 (T regulatory 1) cells and \u03b3\u03b4 T cells.161., 162., 163.\n",

The extensive polymorphism of the MHC, which is also called the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) complex in the human, is a major contributor to the allogeneic rejection response. Rejection responses typically involve the classical MHC class 1a (HLA-A, HLA-B and HLA-C) and MHC class II (HLA-D) antigens responsible for antigen presentation during T-cell activation.131 On the other hand, nonclassical MHC antigens that are able to inhibit T cell and NK cell activity, such as HLA-G and HLA-E, are associated with suppression of the adaptive immune response and maintaining peripheral tolerance.169 Consequently, both classical and nonclassical MHC are involved in regulating autoimmune responses, including autoimmunity in the male reproductive tract.",

Generally, immunologists do not consider that primary immune activation can occur within nonlymphoid tissues or assume that any response generated there is likely to be vigorous enough to lead to full participation by the immune system. However, there is some evidence that primary activation can occur outside the lymphoid tissues, especially during graft rejection.171., 172.\n",

The immune cells themselves produce other anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive molecules, including prostaglandins D and J and lipoxins.178., 179.

The mechanisms of mucosal tolerance involve clonal T-cell deletion or anergy and active suppression by regulatory/suppressor T cells.183 Although CD8+ T cells predominate in the mucosal epithelium, it is the CD4+ T cells that are responsible for mucosal tolerance, producing IL4 and IL10 (Th2 cells), and TGF\u03b2 (Th3 cells).162., 183., 184.

            "text": "The male reproductive system exerts a profound inhibitory effect on the development and function of the immune system. Compared with females, males have lower serum immunoglobulin levels, reduced cellular immunity and less effective responses to antigenic challenge, while the incidence of autoimmune diseases are generally far less common and less severe in males than in females.193 This can be attributed, in part, to genetic and epigenetic differences between the sexes, as indicated by studies in sex-reversed mice, which established that XX-bearing mice displayed greater susceptibility to autoimmune disease than XY-bearing mice, independent of gonad type or hormones.194 However, testis ablation and male sex steroid replacement studies have also established a critical role for products secreted by the testis in this divergence. Such studies demonstrated that androgens inhibit many immune parameters, particularly the size of the thymus and other immune tissues, lymphocyte number and activity, and antibody production, but also graft rejection, autoimmune responses, and resistance to infection.195., 196., 197. These findings have been supported in more recent years by studies in transgenic animals lacking the androgen receptor,198., 199. and by clinical data from hypogonadotropic men.200., 201. Studies on macrophages and other androgen-responsive cell types in vitro have indicated that androgens are able to inhibit NF\u03baB and expression of inflammatory genes, such as TLR4, IL1, and TNF.202., 203., 204. On the other hand, androgens appear to stimulate neutrophil proliferation growth and function through activation of the extracellular signal-regulated (ERK) kinases (mitogen-activated kinase 3/mitogen-activated protein kinase 1; MAPK3/MAPK1) and production of the neutrophil growth factor, granulocyte colony stimulating factor.198., 205.\n",

In fact, the expression and relative importance of the classical androgen receptor on lymphocytes remains somewhat equivocal.209., 210. However, it is now clear that steroids can also interact with membrane-bound G protein-coupled receptors to trigger nongenomic responses in target cells.211., 212. Studies have shown that androgens can alter [Ca] fluxes in lymphocytes and macrophages via such membrane-mediated interactions,213., 214. and that this signaling affects gene expression and function in the target cells.215\n",

These cells are almost entirely confined to the interstitial tissue under normal (noninflamed) conditions. In the boar, which has a relatively sparse testicular interstitial connective tissue and very large numbers of Leydig cells, macrophages appear to represent a smaller proportion of total interstitial cells.254 Curiously, the ram testis appears to possess only small numbers of recognizable macrophages, in spite of the general similarity of the testicular interstitial tissue and lymphatic organization in this species with that of the bull or human.52., 68. Testicular macrophages have been most intensively studied in the rat, with less extensive investigation in the mouse, and relatively limited investigations in other species. It generally has been assumed that the rat testicular macrophages are representative, but data suggest that there are significant functional differences even between rat and mouse testis macrophages. Further study on the macrophages of other species, particularly the human and primates, is clearly necessary, and discussion of this complex cell type in the testis necessarily reflects the rather narrow available knowledge base.",

Ultrastructural studies have established the existence of highly-specialized cytoplasmic interdigitations linking the two cell types, indicating the potential for direct exchange of information and material,60., 240., 244., 255. while macrophages and Leydig cells undergo parallel alterations in morphology and cytoplasmic volume in experimental models of cryptorchidism and vasectomy in the adult rat.256., 257. During aging, testicular macrophages retain their morphological association with Leydig cells, but the cytoplasmic interdigitations are lost.258 Aging testicular macrophages also acquire lipofuscin granules similar to those observed in aged Leydig cells.258 Most surprising, however, was the discovery that macrophages play an essential role in normal Leydig cell development and in maintaining Leydig cell steroidogenic function in the adult.208., 259., 260., 261., 262., 263., 264., 265. It appears that the testicular macrophages have an integral role in testicular biology that goes beyond the typical functions of tissue-fixed macrophages in phagocytosis of cellular debris, connective tissue remodeling, maintenance of innate immunity, and regulation of adaptive immunity.",

Although several studies have shown that the majority of rat macrophages express MHC class II molecules under normal conditions, indicating a capacity for antigen-presentation to helper and regulatory T cell subsets,68., 246., 266. Tung and colleagues reported that strong class II expression in the normal mouse testis was restricted to cells located around the rete testis and was only upregulated in the interstitial tissue following immunization with testicular antigens in the presence of adjuvant.267., 268. This seems to indicate a fundamental difference in baseline activation status and antigen-presenting activity between the testicular macrophages of the rat and mouse. Human testicular macrophages appear to be more like those of the rat, with significant MHC class II expression found throughout interstitial tissue samples from normal men.67., 230. Studies of the ability of rat testicular macrophages to provide help for T cell activation in vitro indicate that these cells are deficient in co-stimulatory activity.269., 270. In the mouse testis, a lack of expression of the essential co-stimulatory molecules for T cell activation, CD80 and CD86, has been reported,271 but this does not appear to be true for the rat.272 With respect to inflammation, selective depletion of testicular macrophages in the rat with a macrophage-specific toxin exacerbated the testicular inflammatory response induced by hyperstimulation of the Leydig cells with pathological doses of the LH agonist, human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG).273 Significantly, rat testicular macrophages display relatively poor expression of critical proinflammatory genes and proteins, including IL1\u03b2, TNF, IL6, IL12, NOS2, and macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF), in response to activation by bacterial LPS or regulatory cytokines269., 274., 275., 276., 277., 278.; however, these cells express constitutively high levels of the anti-inflammatory/immunosuppressive cytokine, IL10.270 Examination of murine testicular macrophages indicates a similarly reduced pro-inflammatory capacity (Hedger MP and Winnall WR, unpublished data).",

The majority of testicular macrophages in the rat express a molecule that is specific to tissue-fixed macrophages in most nonlymphoid tissues, recognized by the monoclonal antibody, ED2.280 This molecule has been identified as CD163, a member of the group B scavenger receptor cysteine-rich protein superfamily.281 It has been implicated in the stimulation of IL10 production by monocytes and macrophages following the endocytosis of hemoglobin:haptoglobin complexes, and is highly expressed by M2 macrophages.282., 283. However, a significant subset of testicular macrophages in the rat (about 15\u201320% of the total) do not express this marker. These macrophages can be identified by expression of the lysosomal antigen, CD68, recognized by antibody ED1, which suggests they may be recently recruited or even transient macrophages.69., 268., 276., 284. Moreover, about half of the CD163+ subset appears to have lost CD68 expression. These data indicate the existence of several populations of macrophages in the normal rat testis, putatively representing different stages of development and/or functional states (Figure 19.9\n).284\n",

Compared with CD68\u2212 macrophages, CD68+ testicular macrophages possesses a distinctly smaller nuclear diameter and displayed overall higher levels of expression of NOS2 and CCL2 in normal and LPS-stimulated rats, based on immunohistochemical studies.276., 285. Expression of IL1\u03b2 protein after LPS treatment appears to be confined to a relatively small subset of testicular macrophages.274 Since the CD68+CD163\u2212 macrophage subset increases in number in the testis after LPS treatment, it may be assumed that this subpopulation represents newly-arrived pro-inflammatory macrophages. However, when macrophages were isolated from noninflamed rat testes on the basis of CD163 expression by flow cytometery, the CD163\u2212 subpopulation displayed very poor production of either proinflammatory cytokines or IL10 in response to LPS in vitro.270 Altogether, these data suggest that the CD68+CD163\u2212 subpopulation present in the normal testis comprises recently recruited or transient macrophages, and it is functionally distinct from the proinflammatory CD68+CD163\u2212 macrophages that invade the rat testis following an LPS challenge in vivo.276., 286.\n",

Dendritic cells are found throughout the interstitium, but they are much less prominent than the testicular macrophages. In spite of the common lineage, dendritic cells lack the efficient phagocytic and cell-killing capabilities of macrophages, although they are much more effective as antigen-presenting cells.133 Crucially, dendritic cells are able to promote either cell-mediated immunity or tolerance to specific antigens, depending upon their maturity and activation status.156 These cells are involved in directing immune responses within the testis and adjacent lymph nodes, and studies suggest that immature dendritic cells play a role in regulating tolerance in the normal testis.271., 272., 292.\n",

Indeed, the development of both the testicular macrophage and the adult Leydig cell populations appears to be interdependent. There is considerable evidence that macrophages are required for adult Leydig cell development and function.208., 259., 261., 262., 264. Conversely, studies from a number of groups have shown that the accumulation of macrophages during testicular development and maintenance of their numbers in the adult are dependent upon the action of pituitary LH and, more specifically, the Leydig cells themselves (Figure 19.9).69., 226., 293., 294., 295., 296., 297. Depletion of the Leydig cells or suppression of their activity in the adult testis by various means causes a progressive decline in the number of testicular macrophages.69., 226., 294., 295., 296., 297., 298. Although there is evidence that macrophages in the testis possess LH receptors,299., 300. the balance of the data suggest that the Leydig cell is responsible, rather than a direct action of LH itself. Testicular macrophage depletion occurs in models in which serum LH is increased (e.g. following treatment with the Leydig cell toxin, ethane dimethane sulfonate (EDS))69 or decreased (e.g. hypophysectomy, GnRH immunization, suppression of endogenous androgen with subcutaneous testosterone implants).294., 295., 296., 297., 298.\n",

Studies have clearly indicated that normal development of the testicular macrophage population, as in other tissues, involves the macrophage growth factor, colony stimulating factor-1 (CSF1).247., 264., 285., 301. The chemoattractant cytokine, MIF, which is constitutively expressed by the Leydig cells, likewise may be involved.226., 278., 302. Furthermore, intratesticular production of the chemokines, chemokine (C-X3-C motif) ligand 1 (CX3CL1; fractalkine) and CCL2, is implicated in the recruitment of circulating monocytes under normal conditions and during inflammation, respectively.285., 286., 303.\n",

The significant population of macrophages expressing CD68, but not CD163, in the normal testis suggests that there may be constant recruitment of these cells from the monocyte pool.284 On the other hand, there is evidence that testicular resident macrophages may undergo active proliferation by mitosis, at least under certain circumstances: during the early inflammatory phase following destruction of the Leydig cells by EDS305 and during testis development in rats and mice.293., 306. Consequently, it is not absolutely clear whether the resident macrophage population of the testis, once established, is maintained by recruitment of new monocytes or by local proliferation. In fact, it is most likely that both processes are involved. Based on the extended persistence of radionuclides in rodent, canine, and human testicular macrophages, on the other hand, it would appear that most resident macrophages do not escape the testis alive.237., 238.\n",

It appears that, while Leydig cells are responsible for recruiting and maintaining the testicular macrophage population, the Sertoli cell may play a role in directing at least some of the testis-specific functions of these cells (Figure 19.9).

It is worth noting that considerable differences may exist among different strains of animals and between animals raised under different degrees of exposure to environmental pathogens, as lymphocyte populations are very sensitive to differences in genetic background and past immunological events. Functional characterization of these cells has received relatively little attention: T cells and NK cells, but not B cells, have been described in the normal rat, mouse and human testis.65., 67., 68., 69., 70., 227.

The phenotype of the majority of the T cells of the rat testis is certainly consistent with activated or memory T cells.70 There is clear evidence that lymphocyte numbers increase in the testes of men with infertility and sperm autoimmunity,66., 232. and lymphocyte numbers in the rat testis appear to gradually increase with age while macrophage numbers remain relatively constant (Hedger MP, unpublished data). These data suggest that at least some of the T cells in the testis are specific for testicular autoantigens. Alternatively, some of these cells may represent T cells that have been exposed to exogenous antigens within the testis environs during past infections.",

In addition, CD4+CD25+FOXP3+ Treg cells are present in both rodent species, but are considerably more prominent in the mouse testis than in the rat. Immunohistochemistry has recently localized Treg cells to the human testis, as well.310 The T cells and NK T cells from the rat testis were found to produce IL10 under both unstimulated and PMA/ionomycin-stimulated conditions, although the T cells displayed a very high proportion of anergic and apoptotic cells compared with T cells from other tissues (Hedger MP and Aridi DZ, unpublished data). These observations indicate that the lymphocytes found in the normal testis comprise cells involved in cell-killing and innate immunity, that immunoregulatory subsets (NK, NK T and Treg cells) are highly represented, and that intratesticular T-cell responses to activation are significantly abrogated.",

In contrast, mast cells are found throughout the interstitial tissue in equine and human testes,62., 71., 317. while both mast cells and eosinophils are relatively abundant in porcine species.62 The functional significance of these cells in the testis is not known, but it is reasonable to assume that they play a role in local innate immunity and possibly a role in the fine control of testicular blood flow. In humans, testicular mast cell numbers decline with advancing age.317 However, increased numbers of intratesticular mast cells and increased mast cell expression of PTGS2 are associated with various forms of testicular failure, and they have been found to correlate with the severity of damage and increased NOS2 expression in the Leydig cells.22., 318., 319., 320.

The species distribution of mast cells and eosinophils suggests some relationship with the level of aromatase activity of the Leydig cells,326., 327. and neonatal estrogen treatment increases mast cell numbers in the rat testis.325., 328. Stem cell factor (SCF), which is growth factor for both mast cells and Leydig cells that is produced by the Sertoli cell, also may be involved.329., 330.

Published immune cell subset data for the epididymis have been complicated by the fact that some studies have not clearly differentiated between lymphocytes and macrophages because the CD4 and CD8 antigens are also expressed by rat and human monocytes and macrophages.335., 336. Studies in the mouse, where these antigens are more restricted to lymphocyte subsets, indicate that macrophages are the major epididymal leukocytes, located chiefly in the interstitial and peritubular regions, and that there appears to be a slight preponderance of MHC class II restricted CD4+ T cells (helper and regulatory T cell subsets) over the CD8+ T cell subset in the interstitial tissue, typical of blood and most other tissues.95., 96., 99. Conversely, the intraepithelial lymphocytes are predominantly CD8+ T cells, which is a common feature of mucosal epithelia.65., 96., 98., 334. This distribution of T cell subsets is consistent with the observation that the interstitial tissue macrophages express MHC class II antigens, whereas macrophages within the epididymal epithelium mostly do not.96., 99. As in the testis, development of the epididymal macrophages is dependent upon CSF1.337 Studies have suggested that the basal cells, located adjacent to the basal lamina of the epididymis, exhibit structural and antigenic properties typical of macrophages.94., 338. The numbers of the basal cells expressing macrophage-specific markers in the mouse are increased by the presence of damaged sperm, and it has been speculated that these cells are actually a type of resident macrophages, which could play a role in regulating immunity in the epididymis.338., 339.\n",

In fact, it has been speculated that the macrophages within the epididymal duct may even be responsible for phagocytosis of senescent and excess sperm, although the evidence for this is equivocal.333., 343., 344., 345. The immunophysiological functions of the macrophages and lymphocytes within the epididymis are only just being uncovered, and they represent a fertile area for future research.",

Approximately 70% of all vasectomized men develop sperm antibodies; in many of these men, the antibodies are persistent, thereby frustrating later attempts to restore fertility.346., 347. Sperm antibodies are likewise associated with obstructive azoospermia and congenital absence of the vas (CAV) in men,348 and similar antibody responses occur in experimental animal models.332., 349., 350., 351., 352.

They are synthesized as 31\u201333 kDa precursor proteins that are cleaved enzymatically to active 17-kDa forms (Figure 19.10\n). Both the precursor and mature forms of IL1\u03b1 are biologically active, but the IL1\u03b2 precursor is inactive. Consequently, production of active IL1\u03b2 is a two-step process involving NF\u03baB-induced transcription and translation of the IL1\u03b2 precursor gene, followed by cleavage of the precursor to the mature cytokine by CASP1.117., 118. This processing of IL1\u03b2 is linked to its secretion into the extracellular space. Conversion of IL1\u03b1 does not involve CASP1, but the precursor can be cleaved by calcium-dependent membrane-associated cysteine proteases, or calpains, and extracellular proteases.371 In contrast to IL1\u03b2, the majority of IL1\u03b1 tends to remain within the cell or associated with the cell membrane, although it may be found in secretions as well.370 It is generally believed to act as an autocrine growth factor or as a mediator of direct cell-to-cell communication, but the mechanisms involved are poorly defined. Both IL1\u03b1 and IL1\u03b2 differ from most cytokines in that they lack a signal sequence and their mechanisms of secretion remains to be elucidated.",

Adult rat seminiferous tubule extracts also contain an immunoreactive 45-kDa IL1\u03b1 protein that has yet to be fully characterized, but may be another variant of the precursor mRNA with one or more introns retained. These testis-specific transcripts are biologically active, although less potent than mature 17-kDa IL1\u03b1.377., 380. There is some evidence that rat spermatocytes and spermatids also express IL1\u03b1 constitutively.381\n",

Curiously, the majority of this secreted testicular IL1\u03b2 is present as the precursor protein.274 Studies have shown that Leydig cells express the mRNA for both IL1\u03b1 and IL1\u03b2 in vitro in response to stimulation by LPS or exogenous IL1,390., 391., 392. and whole testes and isolated macrophages collected from LPS-treated rats or mice express IL1\u03b2 mRNA,393., 394., 395. and the immunoreactive protein.396 Thus, while IL1\u03b2 expression in the normal testis is relatively low, it increases during inflammation, possibly due to production by interstitial cells rather than by the Sertoli cells. The response of testicular IL1\u03b1 to inflammation in vivo is less clear: although production by the Sertoli cell is upregulated by inflammatory stimuli in vitro, recent in vivo studies report either no response or reduction during systemic inflammation.396., 397.\n",

Moreover, IL1 is able to activate other signaling pathways through induction of phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate 3-kinase (PIK3)/Akt protein kinase (AKT) and tyrosine-protein kinase Src (SRC), hydrolysis of GTP, phosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylserine or phosphatidylethanolamine, release of ceramide by neutral sphingomyelinase, and release of arachidonic acid by phospholipase A2 (PLA2).370., 398. There is an IL1 type II receptor (IL1R2), which lacks a TIR domain and can act as a decoy or inhibitory receptor.399\n",

            "text": "A review of the literature dealing with the direct effects of IL1 on testosterone production by mature Leydig cells in vitro reveals reports of stimulation, inhibition or even of no effect.395., 402., 403., 404., 405., 406. Presumably, these apparent discrepancies arise from differences in the experimental conditions or methodologies employed. On balance, studies suggest that IL1 is either stimulatory or has no effect on basal testosterone production by adult Leydig cells,406., 407., 408. and there is general agreement that IL1 inhibits LH/hCG and/or cAMP stimulated testosterone production.395., 402., 403., 406., 407., 409. In the mouse, the major site of inhibition is at the level of CYP17A expression (Figure 19.3).403., 410. In the rat, IL1 appears to regulate Leydig cell steroidogenesis at the level of CYP11A, while STAR gene expression and protein synthesis are unaffected.404., 411. The effects of testicular IL1\u03b1 on Leydig cell steroidogenesis may be dependent on both the variant of IL1\u03b1 involved and on the stage of development of the Leydig cell. The 32-kDa IL1\u03b1 precursor and the 17-kDa mature IL1\u03b1 are both inhibitory to gonadotropin-stimulated or cAMP-stimulated steroidogenesis in mature Leydig cells, whereas the testis-specific 24-kDa IL1\u03b1 splice variant has no effect.380 In contrast, all three forms of IL1\u03b1 stimulated testosterone production by immature rat Leydig cells. When IL1\u03b2 was injected into the immature rat testis, Leydig cell steroidogenesis and serum testosterone levels were stimulated within 24 h, although Leydig cell activity had declined several days later.412 No similar effect was observed in the adult testis. The signaling mechanisms mediating IL1 effects on the Leydig cells involve PTGS2 enzyme expression and PGE2 acting as an intermediate.402., 413. Studies using Leydig cells from immature rats have also implicated the MAP kinases, MAPK14 and MAPK3/MAPK1, in the regulation of STAR and cholesterol mobilization.380., 414.\n",

In vitro, IL1 stimulates proliferation of prepubertal Sertoli cells417 and regulates a number of activities of more mature Sertoli cell that support or control spermatogenesis, including aromatase activity,418 production of glucose transporters, lactate and transferrin,419., 420., 421. and production of IL1\u03b1, IL6 and the IL1 receptor.375., 385. IL1 also regulates production by the Sertoli cell of the inhibin B heterodimer and the homologous \u03b2-subunit homodimer, activin A, in an inverse relationship with FSH.389., 422. Considered more broadly, IL1 opposes the mostly stimulatory effects of FSH on Sertoli cell activity. Moreover, IL1 regulates the ability of the Sertoli cell to maintain contact with other Sertoli cells and developing spermatogenic cells, by altering the Sertoli cell cytoskeleton, and stimulates opening of the occluding junctions that make up the blood\u2013testis barrier.423 Regulation of Sertoli cell function by exogenous IL1 has been found to involve multiple pathway intermediates, including MAPK14, MAPK8 and MAPK3/MAPK1, PIK3/AKT, PTGS2/PGE2 and NOS2/NO, although the more predictable participation of MYD88 and NF\u03baB still awaits investigation.417., 424., 425., 426., 427.\n",

When highly purified LPS was used, rat Sertoli cells were more than 10-fold less sensitive to LPS than testicular macrophages, but they expressed similar levels of IL1\u03b1 and IL6 and much greater levels of activin A when maximally stimulated.388 These Sertoli cells also responded to the synthetic lipopeptide Pam3Cys (a specific TLR2 ligand) with a more prolonged pattern of gene expression. The need for relatively high doses of LPS to stimulate the Sertoli cell is probably related to the relatively low level of expression of the accessory protein, CD14, which serves to amplify the response to LPS in macrophages.110 These data indicate that Sertoli cells respond to bacterial ligands acting through both TLR2 and TLR4, although they are less sensitive to these ligands in comparison with local macrophages and display a Sertoli cell-specific pattern of gene expression in response.",

The canonical member of this family, TNF is a 17-kDa glycosylated polypeptide that is secreted principally by activated monocytes and macrophages, and binds to receptors that are present on most cells in the body.458 This cytokine plays a central role in the initiation of the inflammatory response, and can exert pro-inflammatory or cytotoxic effects depending upon the receptor subtype engaged and the expression of specific adaptor proteins within the target cells (Figure 19.5). There are two families of TNF receptors (TNFR).459., 460. The TNFR type 1 family of receptors induce cell death through a motif in their cytoplasmic regions called the death domain (DD), and includes TNFR1, FAS and the death receptors (DR)3-6. When TNF binds to TNFR1, there is recruitment to the DD of the intracellular adaptor proteins TRADD (TNFR-associated death domain) and FADD (Fas-associated death domain), leading to activation of the cell death caspase pathway. However, the binding of TRADD can also lead to recruitment of the cellular inhibitor of apoptosis (baculoviral IAP repeat containing; BIRC) protein or receptor interacting serine\u2013threonine kinase (RIPK), enabling the binding of TRAF2. This complex mediates activation of the NF\u03baB pathway and the MAP kinases, MAPK14 and MAPK8. The TNFR type 2 receptors, which include TNFR2, TNFR superfamily member 8 (TNFRSF8, CD30) and 5 (TNFRSF5, CD40), and the lymphotoxin receptor, do not contain a DD in their intracellular domains, and instead associate with TRAFs leading to the activation of cell signaling events.",

In situ hybridization studies in mice first identified the presence of TNF mRNA in round spermatids, pachytene spermatocytes, and testicular interstitial macrophages.461 Bioactive TNF was produced by the round spermatids in vitro and mRNA for the corresponding receptor was located on Sertoli and Leydig cells. Similarly, in the seminiferous epithelium of the rat, TNF has been localized to the spermatogenic cell compartment, and TNF receptors primarily localized to the Sertoli cells.462 Treatment of isolated rat or mouse testicular macrophages with LPS also induces TNF secretion.463., 464.\n",

Inhibition of LH/hCG binding, STAR expression, and cholesterol mobilization has been observed,466., 471. but these studies also indicate that inhibition by TNF occurs downstream of cAMP production at the level of steroidogenic gene expression (Figure 19.3). In cultured mouse Leydig cells, TNF had no effect on basal expression of CYP11A, but it suppressed basal expression of HSD3\u03b2 and the expression of CYP11A, CYP17A, and HSD3\u03b2 induced by analogs of cAMP.410., 468. The inhibitory effect of TNF on CYP17A gene expression was found to be mediated through protein kinase C, possibly by activation of MAPK8, MAPK3/MAPK1, and the transcription factors, NF\u03baB and AP-1.467., 470., 472. Several other studies have implicated the sphingomyelin/ceramide-dependent pathway in TNF-mediated inhibition of Leydig cell testosterone secretion.466., 469. Although the levels of testosterone and the mRNA levels of steroidogenesis-related genes were significantly lower after puberty in TNF knockout mouse testes than in wild-type testes, this may be attributed to increased levels of anti-M\u00fcllerian hormone in these animals.473\n",

Many of the effects of TNF have been shown to involve the activation of NF\u03baB and MAP kinases in the Sertoli cell.453., 474., 475., 476., 477., 478. Similar to IL1, TNF stimulates basal lactate production by cultured Sertoli cells, but generally antagonizes the actions of FSH on Sertoli cell function, including the stimulation of lactate production, aromatase activity and inhibin.479., 480., 481. Nevertheless, TNF receptor subunit protein expression has been shown to be stimulated by FSH in porcine Sertoli cells.482 TNF stimulates the expression of inflammatory cytokines, chemokines, and leukocyte adhesion molecules expression in both Sertoli cells and peritubular cells.303., 387., 477., 478. Furthermore, TNF stimulates plasminogen activator inhibitor expression in rat testicular peritubular cells, indicating that it plays a key role in controlling testicular protease activity.483 In Sertoli cell monolayer cultures, TNF disrupts inter-Sertoli cell tight-junction assembly by inhibiting production of the junction protein, occludin, and by regulating matrix metalloprotease and protease inhibitor activity.484 Delfino and colleagues have shown that TNF stimulates androgen receptor expression in Sertoli cells via upregulation of NF\u03baB, which binds to several enhancer motifs in the androgen receptor promoter.453\n",

Studies intended to localize FASL in the testis under normal conditions have produced conflicting results, which may be attributed to differences in detection methods, limitations of the reagents employed, and the fact that these molecules are readily inducible.491., 492. Thus, FASL has been described as being present in rat, mouse, porcine, and human Sertoli cells, and absent in most germ cells,489., 490., 493., 494. but others have reported that FASL expression in the rat seminiferous epithelium is confined to the germ cells.492., 495.

In the late inflammatory phase, it stimulates the acute-phase response and promotes fibrosis. Outside the immune system, IL6 plays crucial roles in hematopoiesis, liver and neuronal function, energy metabolism, and cancer. Cytokines of the IL6 type, which include leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) and IL11, exert their action via binding to specific receptors that can form complexes with a common, ubiquitously-expressed membrane signal transducer, glycoprotein 130 (interleukin-6 signal transducer; IL6ST).501 In lymphocytes and hepatocytes, IL6 binds to its specific membrane-bound receptor (IL6R; CD126), which has no intrinsic kinase activity and dimerization with IL6ST leads to activation of the Janus kinase (JAK)/signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) and MAP kinase signaling pathways (classic IL6 signaling). However, all cells that express IL6ST are able to respond to IL6 bound to soluble IL6R, which may be produced from an alternatively-spliced mRNA transcript or released by proteolytic cleavage of membrane-bound IL6R, a process called trans-signaling.",

As is the case for TGF\u03b2, postreceptor signaling occurs via SMAD2/3/4, and several alternative signaling pathways, including inflammatory pathways involving MAPK14, MAPK8, and MAPK3/MAPK1.512., 513., 541. Inhibin acts as a competitive inhibitor of activin because it can bind to the type II activin receptors but cannot bring about receptor subunit multimerization: this interaction of inhibin with the activin receptor is facilitated by a specific co-receptor protein called TGF\u03b2 receptor type III (TGFBR3), or betaglycan.542 Activin C is a dimer of the structurally-related \u03b2C-subunit, which does not appear to dimerize with the inhibin \u03b1-subunit and is unable to facilitate activin receptor signaling.543., 544. It is most highly expressed in the liver but is present in the testis.545 Homodimers and heterodimers comprising the \u03b2B- and \u03b2C-subunits appear to act as weak competitive agonists or antagonists of activin A.533., 544., 546., 547. Moreover, activin bioactivity can be effectively neutralized in the circulation and in tissues by an endogenous, high-affinity activin binding protein, follistatin.548\n",

Multiple AP-1 and AP-2 sites have been identified in the promoter of the \u03b2B-subunit, suggesting that activin B may be, at least in part, regulated in a similar manner to that of activin A.552., 553.

            "text": "A large body of evidence suggests that activin A acts to promote inflammation and activation of macrophages and dendritic cells during the initial phase of the immune response, but suppresses immune responses once inflammation is established and activin A concentrations increase.531 In cells of the monocyte/macrophage lineage that had not been activated, activin A induced nuclear translocation of NF\u03baB, and production of pro-inflammatory mediators, such as IL1\u03b2, TNF, IL6, NO, and prostanoids.555., 556. However, in activated monocyte/macrophages, activin A inhibited processing of the IL1\u03b2 precursor and production of TLR4, CD14, and pro-inflammatory mediators and increased production of IL1RN.557., 558. Similarly, activin A stimulated the recruitment and development of monocyte-derived dendritic cells,559., 560. but inhibited the ability of dendritic cells to mature and stimulate T cell activation.561., 562. Inhibitory effects of activin A on the antigen-presenting activity of macrophages have been observed as well,563 and activin A stimulates the development of antigen-specific Treg cells.564 Furthermore, activin A inhibits many of the actions regulated by IL1, IL6, and IFN\u03b3, including T-cell and B-cell proliferation, monocyte phagocytosis, and production of acute-phase proteins.557., 565., 566., 567. Together with the fact that activin A is produced by Th2 cells and has been implicated in promoting various Th2-regulated immune responses, such as asthma and atopy,568 mast cell recruitment, maturation, and activity,569 and B cell immunoglobulin production,555., 570. these observations suggest that activin A may be a crucial Th2 cytokine. Likewise, the effects of activin A on macrophage inflammatory responses indicate an ability to switch pro-inflammatory M1 macrophages to an alternatively-activated, anti-inflammatory M2 phenotype. Finally, activin A has been shown to be both a fundamental regulator and an important intermediary in the process leading from inflammation to fibrosis, which is also associated with the M2 macrophage phenotype.279., 571.\n",

In the adult rat, intratesticular fluid levels of activin A are 5\u201310 times higher than normal circulating concentrations.274 In cultured Sertoli cells, activin A is stimulated by IL1 and TLR ligands (Figure 19.10), and inhibited by FSH and the cAMP/protein kinase A signaling pathway.379., 388., 389., 422., 481., 573. Immediately following spermiation, there is a spike in activin A production by the Sertoli cells, possibly driven by the surge of IL\u03b1 produced by the Sertoli cell at this time.572., 573. Testicular macrophages, Leydig cells, and Sertoli cells respond to LPS by increasing \u03b2A-subunit expression in vitro, although the Sertoli cells display a much more robust response and higher basal levels of production.224., 388. However, the actual role of activin A in testicular inflammation remains to be determined because the high intratesticular levels of activin A in the adult rat were not acutely affected by LPS treatment in vivo.274 Significant production of activin B in the testis has yet to be confirmed: the \u03b2B-subunit is produced by the Sertoli cell, but it is not clear whether any of this goes to form activin B homodimers, as inhibin B heterodimers are by far the major form of inhibin in the testes of most species, including the human.422., 574. The activin \u03b2C-subunit has been immunolocalized to Sertoli cells, peritubular cells and Leydig cells, as well as spermatogonia, primary spermatocytes, and elongating spermatids.545., 575.\n",

In mice, deletion of the \u03b2C-subunit had no overt effect on testis function,587 but overexpression of the \u03b2C-subunit resulted in progressive hypospermatogenesis, which was proposed to be due to antagonism of activin A (and possibly activin B) in the testis.547 Like TGF\u03b2, activin is expected to be involved in controlling inflammation and immunity in the testis, by regulation of the maturation and activity of the intratesticular macrophages and lymphocytes.",

The type I interferons (IFN\u03b1 and \u03b2) are produced by a broad range of cell types: typically, multiple forms of IFN\u03b1 are produced by monocytes and macrophages, while two forms of IFN\u03b2 are produced by fibroblasts and epithelial cells, but they all exert their antiviral and antiproliferative effects via the IFN\u03b1 receptor (IFNAR). The single type II interferon, IFN\u03b3, is produced by NK and NK T cells, activated T cells and, under certain conditions, by macrophages and dendritic cells.589., 590. It acts through the IFN\u03b3 receptor (IFNGR), and regulates the activity of antigen-presenting cells as part of the adaptive immune response, in addition to its antiviral functions. In other words, IFN\u03b3 is a type II interferon, but a type 1 (Th1) cytokine. Production of type I interferons is normally stimulated through TLR3, which detects double-stranded viral RNA, and through TLR4, the receptor for bacterial LPS.115 These TLRs upregulate the interferon-inducing transcription factor, IRF3, by engagement of the TICAM1 adaptor protein and interaction with TRAF3 (Figure 19.5).106., 115. Induction of IFN\u03b3 involves IL12 and IL18, type 1 interferons, JAK/STAT signaling, and the transcription factors, NF\u03baB and AP-1, in a cell-specific manner.589., 590.\n",

Both IFN\u03b1 and IFN\u03b3 can inhibit testosterone production in primary cultures of porcine Leydig cells, and studies indicated that IFN\u03b3 inhibits cholesterol transport into the mitochondria, and inhibits expression of the STAR protein, CYP11A, and CYP17A (Figure 19.3).599., 600. In other experimental studies, human and murine IFN\u03b1 inhibited steroidogenesis in rat Leydig cells.601 These data indicate that interferons may contribute to the overall decline in steroidogenic function that is commonly observed in viral infections.21., 602., 603. However, Dejucq and colleagues592 have shown that Sertoli and Leydig cells in the rat testis strongly expressed IFN\u03b1 and IFN\u03b3 during infection with Sendai virus, and that elevation in expression was associated with an increase in testosterone production by Leydig cells infected with Sendai virus in vitro. This result highlights the fact that responses to some infections may exert a stimulatory effect on steroidogenesis within the testis, even though factors that are inhibitory to steroidogenesis are induced.604\n",

These lipids are signaling molecules, fundamentally involved in physiological processes, including inflammation and immunity. They arise from hydrolysis of arachidonic acid from membrane glycerophospholipids, through the action of phospholipase A2 (PLA2).605 The rate-limiting step in the conversion of arachidonic acid to the prostanoids is cyclooxygenation, catalyzed by one of two closely related enzymes, PTGS1 and PTGS2 (Table 19.2). While PTGS1 is constitutively expressed, PTGS2 expression is inducible during inflammation, through the IL1/TLR and TNF signaling pathways.606 Production of the specific prostanoid classes, however, requires the subsequent actions of specific prostaglandin synthases and thromboxane synthase.607 In turn, the prostaglandins and thromboxanes interact with their respective membrane-bound G protein-coupled receptors to regulate cell growth, vascular smooth muscle tone, vascular permeability, and immune cell activity.608 Prostanoids exert both pro-inflammatory and immunosuppressive actions through these receptor interactions, or through metabolism to other active immunoregulatory metabolites, such as the immunosuppressive ligand for peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-\u03b3 (PPAR\u03b3), 15deoxy-PGJ2.609., 610.

In the normal rat testis, PTGS2 is responsible for the majority of prostaglandin production, and chronic treatment with a specific PTGS2 inhibitor, celecoxib, considerably reduces intratesticular PGE2 levels.615., 619. On the other hand, intratesticular PGE2 levels are barely affected by acute LPS treatment.615 This may be due to the fact that macrophages in the rat testis express PTGS2 at very low levels, relative to other testicular cells, but they are the only testis cell type to respond to an inflammatory stimulus with a significant increase in PTGS2 activity.615 These data indicate a maintenance role for the so-called inducible PTGS2 enzyme in testicular function.",

However, the actual importance of prostanoids in regulating testicular function remains uncertain: male mice lacking either PTGS2 or PTGS1 are considered to be fertile,622 and studies on the effects of prostaglandins or various PTGS inhibitors on spermatogenesis and fertility have produced conflicting outcomes.618., 619., 623., 624. Products of the lipoxygenase pathway, most notably LTB4, have been implicated in the regulation of Leydig cell steroidogenesis by LH.625., 626. Furthermore, production of PGE2 and PGF2\u03b1 induced by PTGS2 mediates the effects of IL1 on protein and lipid regulation by the Sertoli cell involved in supporting spermatogenesis and inflammation in the testis.424., 425. A relationship between expression levels of IL1\u03b2 and PTGS2 in the testes of infertile men also has been reported.627 These observations suggest that PTGS2 and prostanoid production mediate at least some of the effects of inflammation on testicular function.",

These molecules may play a role in facilitating communication between cells of the seminiferous epithelium\u2014the Sertoli cells, peritubular cells and spermatogenic cells\u2014and the Leydig cell. Such paracrine actions have long been associated with local control of steroidogenesis, as a mechanism for modulating the response of the Leydig cell to stimulation by LH, in response to changing requirements of the seminiferous epithelium.61., 661. Moreover, since Leydig cells themselves produce these inflammatory regulators, they could be involved in autocrine regulation of steroidogenesis as well. Certainly, production of NO and other ROS, either by the Leydig cell itself or through its close physical relationship with the resident macrophages, is implicated in Leydig cell desensitization to stimulation by LH.394., 409., 629., 630. In terms of pathology, increased levels of inflammatory regulators, arising from either the circulation or the testis, during infection and inflammation, should similarly impact upon steroidogenesis.",

            "text": "Studies in the rat and mouse indicate that certain cytokines and inflammatory mediators are expressed in a dynamic manner throughout the spermatogenic process, in the complete absence of external drivers of inflammation. Specifically, there is a surge of production of IL\u03b1, IL6 and activin A by the Sertoli cell at the time of the release of mature spermatids from the seminiferous epithelium (spermiation), which is reflected in a concomitant increase in nuclear translocation of NF\u03baB and production of TNF and NOS2 in the meiotic and postmeiotic spermatogenic cells.373., 375., 384., 452., 461., 509., 572., 573., 641. This is a time when a number of critical physiological events occur within the seminiferous epithelium, including the phagocytosis of spermatid residual cytoplasm by the Sertoli cells, an increase in DNA synthesis associated with spermatogonial mitosis and the entry of preleptotene spermatocytes into meiosis, and the transition of these early spermatocytes through the tight junctions that normally constitute the blood\u2013testis barrier.18 The coincidence of these events is particularly significant because it has been established that IL\u03b1, IL6, and activin A are regulators of spermatogonial proliferation and differentiation,382., 383., 384., 416., 509., 579., 580., 581. while IL1\u03b1, activin A, TNF, and NO have all been shown to stimulate the opening of the blood\u2013testis barrier by modifying the Sertoli cell cytoskeleton, inhibiting production of proteins involved in Sertoli\u2013Sertoli and Sertoli-spermatogenic cell junctions and/or regulating protease and protease inhibitor activity.423., 484., 583., 640.\n",

This may be attributable to ongoing contact between the spermatogenic cells and Sertoli cell, mediated by pattern-recognition receptors on the cell surface, and/or by phagocytosis of degenerating cells, since many spermatogenic cells do not survive to complete spermatogenesis and are lost through apoptosis.490., 666. In support of this possibility, Zhang and colleagues have recently reported that damaged spermatogenic cells induce inflammatory gene expression, including IL1\u03b2, TNF, and IL6, in mouse Sertoli cells through activation of TLR2 and 4.667 Such interactions may be driving other cyclical functions of the Sertoli cell, including the responsiveness of the Sertoli cell to FSH and androgen,668., 669. and the expression of regulators of cytokine activity, such as follistatin.572., 670.\n",

Firstly, because the mediators of inflammation and their signaling pathways are exquisitely sensitive to stimulation by microbial contamination, stress, or even the very act of cell isolation, it should not be assumed that expression levels are always indicative of a role in normal physiology. Many early studies of these processes may have been compromised by failure to eliminate endotoxin (endogenous LPS) contamination from the experiments, or the extreme sensitivity and nonquantitative nature of the detection methods used, such as RT-PCR. It is only when molecules have been repeatedly shown to be constitutively and substantially expressed in the absence of exogenous inflammatory stimuli, and to have consistent and coherent effects on reproductive function in diverse studies, that we may assume that these molecules play a role over and above the usual response to infection or other immune activation events.",

However, this assessment may fail to take into account the fact that the reproductive phenotype is subtle, or even enhances fertility, as occurs in the NOS2-deficient mouse.647., 650. Sometimes, more careful examination of the reproductive tract and fertility reveals reproductive defects in male mice that are, nonetheless, capable of producing offspring.264., 435. Moreover, given the extraordinary complexity, diversity and redundancy of the immune system, effects may only manifest after compound deletions of multiple functions, or on certain genetic backgrounds. Some effects may not be evident under normal animal husbandry conditions, and may only become evident in older animals or in animals living in the wild exposed to environmental stresses, dietary deficiency or specific pathogens. Some effects may only become evident when other physiological processes are also compromised, such as occurs in male mice infected with Taenia crassiceps.672 Wild-type mice with this infection display increased IL6 expression and become feminized due to excessive aromatase activity. This steroidogenic deviation is completely prevented in IL6 deficient mice, which otherwise have similar reproductive functions to those of wild-type mice. This observation is consistent with studies implicating IL6 as a regulator of aromatase activity,675 but also provides an example of a reproductive knockout phenotype that only manifests itself following specific immunological events.",

Moreover, medium collected from supposedly unstimulated testicular macrophages in culture have been shown to both stimulate677., 678. and inhibit405., 408., 678. Leydig cell steroidogenesis in vitro. Similar discrepancies were observed in Leydig-macrophage co-cultures. The most likely explanation for these differences is that partial activation of the macrophages during isolation, or possibly endotoxin contamination, may have affected the results. Neuroendocrine influences also may be important; for example, studies of the bank vole revealed that testosterone production by Leydig cells from long photoperiod animals was more sensitive to stimulation by testicular macrophage conditioned medium and more sensitive to IL1\u03b1-mediated inhibition in comparison with short photoperiod animals.679 On balance, however, the published data seem to indicate that resting testicular macrophages have a positive or trophic effect on Leydig cell steroidogenesis.",

There have been distinct differences reported in the dynamics and severity of this inhibition, from study to study and between different species. Responses in mice generally appear to be more rapid, larger, and more prolonged than those of rats, which showed a biphasic response at approximately 6 and 24 h after treatment with a brief recovery period in between.322., 393., 689., 690., 692. Serum testosterone levels actually appear to rise in the boar following endotoxin treatment, as a result of increases in pulsatile LH secretion.693., 694., 695.

Furthermore, the data indicated that the early phase of suppression of testosterone was due primarily to direct inhibition of Leydig cell steroidogenesis, whereas the later phase involved extratesticular mechanisms, including glucocorticoid-induced inhibition.322., 393.\n",

The increase in LH concentrations was followed by a transient decrease in serum testosterone levels after 4 h.

            "text": "Most evidence suggests that the effects of LPS-induced inflammation on the Leydig cell itself are mediated through exposure to increased levels of pro-inflammatory molecules that inhibit steroidogenesis, most notably IL1, TNF, NO, and other ROS, and PGE2, as outlined earlier (Figure 19.3). Although isolated Leydig cells express the LPS receptor subunits at relatively low levels,388 and there is evidence that they respond to LPS by increased expression of inflammatory cytokines, including IL1\u03b2 and TNF,431., 450. it is extremely difficult to completely eliminate macrophages from Leydig cell preparations. Consequently, it remains unclear whether LPS can regulate Leydig cell steroidogenesis by direct action. Regardless of this uncertainty, there are several significant sources of pro-inflammatory molecules within the testis. The testicular macrophages produce IL1, TNF, NO, and other ROS, and PGE2 when stimulated by LPS, although their production capacity is reduced compared with macrophages from other sites.243., 269., 270., 274., 276., 277., 394., 395., 464., 615., 645., 702. Sertoli cells, peritubular cells, and spermatogenic cells are also potential sources of these pro-inflammatory molecules.369., 381., 461., 615., 641. The role of NO and other ROS may be particularly important: treatment of adult mice with LPS causes oxidative damage to Leydig cells, which manifests as a marked reduction of the mitochondrial electrochemical gradient, decreased STAR and HSD3\u03b2 protein levels, and a fall in serum testosterone, similar to the effects of oxidation by hydrogen peroxide in cultured Leydig cells.652., 653., 654. Moreover, treatment of rodents with NOS inhibitors counteracts the decrease in serum testosterone levels caused by stress and sepsis.657., 658. Curiously, pretreatment of adult rats with the PTGS2 inhibitor, celecoxib, reduced endogenous intratesticular PGE2 levels, and partially reversed the inhibition of testosterone in response to LPS, without blocking the increased expression of IL1\u03b2, TNF, or NOS2 in the testis.619\n",

Several studies have shown that LPS, IL1, IL6, and TNF can inhibit GnRH release and/or LH secretion at the level of the hypothalamus and pituitary,711., 712., 713., 714. although NO appears to have the opposite effect.715., 716. Furthermore, the observation that IL1 administered intracerebrally can reduce Leydig cell testosterone responses in the absence of decreased LH secretion, for example, in rats pretreated with a GnRH antagonist and therefore lacking LH secretion, led Rivier and colleagues to postulate that there is a direct neuronal connection between the brain and the testis that is activated by cytokines and other stressors within the central nervous system.717., 718. Injection of pseudorabies virus, a transganglionic retrograde tracer, into the testes labeled the spinal cord, the brain stem, and the hypothalamus, while spinal cord injury significantly reduced this staining, and abolished the ability of either IL1\u03b2 or CRH administered centrally to inhibit testosterone responses to hCG.719., 720. Studies indicate that these agents stimulate a neural pathway within the brain, possibly involving central catecholamine pathways and NO, which suppresses Leydig cell function by inhibiting cholesterol transport protein levels, independent of effects on the pituitary.720., 721.\n",

Local increases in reactive oxygen and nitrogen species are also implicated in the suppression of Leydig cell steroidogenesis in this model.648., 729., 730.

In the adult rat, administration of a single dose of LPS across a very broad range of sublethal concentrations inhibited the formation of testicular interstitial fluid and suppressed intratesticular and circulating levels of testosterone, by inhibiting LH secretion from the anterior pituitary and reducing the capacity of the Leydig cells to produce testosterone in response to stimulation.24., 322., 393., 696. At the highest doses of LPS, this was followed by apoptosis of spermatogonia and spermatocytes, and premature release of spermatocytes and early round spermatids from the epithelium several days later.322 Detailed stereological analysis established that the effects on spermatogenesis were quite specific.696 At 24 h after treatment, there was a significant delay of spermatocyte development at the leptotene/zygotene phase of meiosis, followed within 6 days by premature release of these cells and the adjacent, but more luminally located, generation of round spermatids. There was also an increase in apoptosis of nearby spermatocytes and spermatids within the same timeframe.696 These effects occurred more rapidly and were quite different from the effects of androgen withdrawal, which inhibits the release of mature spermatids into the tubule lumen and the integrity of the junctions between the Sertoli cells and midphase round spermatids.734., 735. In fact, lower doses of LPS caused a similar degree of inhibition of intratesticular testosterone levels to that caused by high dose LPS, without causing significant spermatogenic damage.24., 322. Moreover, even very high doses of LPS did not reduce intratesticular levels of testosterone in the rat much below 30% of control, well above the threshold necessary to sustain spermatogenesis in this species.79., 80., 734.\n",

Administration of LPS did appear to alter blood flow through the rat testis, possibly as a result of vasodilation of the testicular arteries due to increased testicular NOS2 expression,322., 641. but there was no evidence of ischemia or ischemic damage.276., 322.

            "text": "A primary cause of damage to spermatogenesis in LPS-induced inflammation could be the action of pro-inflammatory regulators on the seminiferous epithelium itself. This might be the result of increased levels of circulating molecules as well as their local production by intratesticular immune cells and somatic cells. In addition to the resident macrophage population, LPS stimulates an increase in intratesticular monocytes in the rat,276., 285. and neutrophils in the boar testis interstitium.694., 695. In vivo, LPS treatment upregulates testicular expression of pro-inflammatory genes, including CCL2, IL1\u03b2, TNF, IL6, and NOS2.274., 276., 285., 322., 393., 396., 619., 641., 691., 737., 738., 739. These molecules are constitutively produced by testicular macrophages, Sertoli cells, peritubular cells, Leydig cells, and/or spermatogenic cells, and their production can be stimulated by LPS in most, if not all, of these cells in vitro. Most importantly, these molecules are involved in normal spermatogenic function, with direct and complex effects on spermatogonial and spermatocyte development, the tight junctions of the blood\u2013testis barrier, and local immune cell activity, mediated via inflammatory signaling pathways within the seminiferous epithelium (Figure 19.14). Moreover, FAS and FASL, which have been implicated in regulating spermatogenic cell apoptosis under normal and pathological conditions, are also increased in the seminiferous epithelium of the LPS-treated mouse.499 Overexpression of these regulators and universal activation of inflammatory signaling pathways in the testis, induced by LPS, would disrupt the normal regulatory processes underlying spermatogenesis. Critically, as most of the normal functions of the seminiferous epithelium are dependent upon androgen support, these effects of inflammatory disturbances could be exacerbated by the concomitant reduction in testosterone levels within the testis.",

In some studies in rats, high doses of LPS are associated with rapid and pronounced epithelial damage, and focal spermatogonial/spermatocyte apoptosis, within 3 days after LPS administration.24., 322. Studies have demonstrated an association between these earlier, more severe, damage events and testicular oxidative stress responses,691., 740. and anti-oxidants can have a protective effect on testicular damage responses to LPS in vitro and in vivo.738., 741., 742. Responses include the induction of the stress proteins, heat shock protein 60 (HSP-60), HMGB1 and HMGB2, as well as increased lipid peroxidation, reduced antioxidant activities, mitochondrial dysfunction and spermatogenic cell apoptosis. Several of these induced molecules can activate TLR signaling as well,24., 108. potentially mediating additional damage.",

            "text": "In summary, the damaging effects of LPS-induced inflammation on spermatogenesis involve multiple mechanisms related to the severity of the stimulus and inflammatory response. These can include direct or indirect inhibition of Leydig cell function, vascular disruption and oxidative stress, as well as interference with the endogenous inflammatory pathways involved in normal regulation of the seminiferous epithelium (Figure 19.14). Differences in damage susceptibility may be attributable to actual differences in sensitivity to LPS at the cellular level, or the probability that circulating LPS may have variable access to the various compartments of the testis. For example, Sertoli cells are much less sensitive to stimulation by LPS than are testicular macrophages, possibly due to differences in expression of the TLR4 accessory protein, CD14.388 Moreover, higher concentrations may be required to permit sufficient LPS to traverse the vascular and lymphatic endothelium of the interstitial tissue as well as the peritubular basement membrane and cell layers to directly affect seminiferous epithelial function. As would be expected, direct injection of LPS into the mouse seminiferous tubules, via the efferent ducts, caused extensive spermatogenic disruption,743 but there have been no quantitative, comparative studies of the effects of systemic and intratesticular routes of administration to date.",

Damage is proportional to the duration of ischemia and, when the procedure is performed unilaterally, the contralateral testis is also affected, which has been attributed to an autoimmune response or to reflex vasoconstriction via neural pathways.746., 747., 748., 749., 750. Although Leydig cell function is compromised, this is not the primary cause of damage in this model.82 Intratesticular inflammation and oxidative stress are implicated, however, because there is activation of NF\u03baB, increased MAP kinase activity and production of IL1\u03b2 and TNF in the affected testis, together with increased local ROS production and an increase in intratesticular immune cells.457., 727., 729., 751., 752. Accordingly, treatment with antioxidants and anti-inflammatories can reduce the resulting spermatogenic damage.753., 754. The role of NO is less clear, because this molecule has both protective and damaging effects in ischemia-reperfusion injury models, and its impact on the testis may depend on the severity of the ischemic insult.648., 649., 755. The most characteristic feature of experimental ischemia-reperfusion injury is a large increase in neutrophils in the testicular subcapsular venules of both the treated and untreated testis, and testicular damage can be reduced or prevented by blocking neutrophil recruitment or activity.727., 729., 756., 757., 758. Thus, ischemia-reperfusion injury to spermatogenesis is an inflammatory event mediated primarily by infiltrating neutrophils, with altered blood flow and oxidative stress leading to apoptosis of early spermatogenic cells, in particular.",

            "text": "Administration of high doses of hCG is used in the treatment of delayed testicular descent in young boys and its impact on testicular function has been extensively studied in adult rats.655 This treatment causes a hyperstimulation syndrome comprising a transient decrease in testicular blood flow, immediately followed by increased testicular blood flow and pressure, opening of the vascular endothelial cell junctions, and an increase in testicular interstitial fluid volume some 16\u201324 h later.765 The syndrome is accompanied by accumulation of intravascular and interstitial neutrophils in the testis,766., 767. an increase in intratesticular expression of IL1\u03b2 and other pro-inflammatory cytokines,768 failure of mature sperm release, vacuolation of the seminiferous epithelium and apoptosis, and loss of spermatogonia and primary spermatocytes.676., 769. In rats, the response to hCG can be eliminated by depletion of the Leydig cells with EDS,770 or depletion of neutrophils with a specific antiserum,766 and exogenous IL1\u03b2 is able to replicate most of the effects of hCG.391., 771. These observations suggest that this is an inflammatory response, possibly mediated via IL1\u03b2 secreted by the Leydig cells. Interestingly, the vascular response is quite different to that of LPS-induced inflammation, which causes a massive reduction in interstitial fluid volume in the testis,322 although some of the germ cell damage seen is similar in both models. It is significant that disruption of the seminiferous epithelium in both the hCG-hyperstimulation rat model and the ischemia-reperfusion model appear to be dependent upon recruitment of neutrophils to the testicular vasculature or interstitial tissue. Equally significant is the observation that both depletion of the testicular macrophages using liposome-encapsulated dichloromethylene diphosphonate273 or stimulation of the macrophages with latex beads676 exacerbate the effects of hCG on the testis, suggesting that the resident macrophages normally play a role in limiting the inflammatory response.",

            "text": "In general, there is a close relationship between vascular disturbance in the testis and inflammation, production of NO, and oxidative stress, leading to spermatogenic damage. These same processes are also implicated in other models of testicular damage, such as the response to heat or cryptorchidism, irradiation, and posttesticular obstruction events.646., 651., 772., 773. While Leydig cell function is frequently compromised in models of testicular inflammation, reduction of androgens is not the primary cause of spermatogenic failure. It is clear that inflammation has direct inhibitory effects on one or more stages of spermatogenic cell development. It also should be pointed out that, as in most other tissues, inflammatory responses in the testis do not appear to automatically produce autoimmune complications. However, inflammation can lead to increased fibrosis in the testis, presumably through increased production of pro-fibrotic cytokines, such as TNF, TGF\u03b2 and activin A, and increased testicular fibrosis is associated with spermatogenic failure and infertility.318., 774., 775.\n",

The epithelium of the caput epididymis comprises numerous functionally active immune cells, particularly dendritic cells and macrophages, but also CD8+ T cells.96., 97., 98., 102. This is consistent with the relatively high expression of TLRs in this region of the epididymis. In the regions of the epididymis closest to the testis, moreover, epithelial cell apoptosis is inhibited by repression of NF\u03baB and STAT signaling and activation of the MAPK3/MAPK1 pathway, under the control of androgens, cytokines, or other secretions from the testis.787., 788. These pathways are normally regulated by pathways involved in TLR signaling, and the relationship between the TLRs and testicular factors in their control requires elucidation. Recently, it was discovered that activin A is highly expressed in the epithelium of the caput epididymis.789., 790., 791. This expression is likely to be driven by TLR signaling, and because activin A is a critical regulator of macrophage, dendritic cell and T cell functions, one can assume that this cytokine influences immune cell activity and inflammation in the proximal epididymis. However, other functions of activin A also may be anticipated. In transgenic mice that overexpress the activin-binding protein, follistatin, fluid resorption and sperm transport in the efferent ducts and proximal epididymis is impaired, suggesting a role for endogenous activin in the control of fluid dynamics.792 Furthermore, activin A has been shown to induce SRD5\u03b1 in genital fibroblasts,793 and the caput epididymis is the site of highest expression of this enzyme, indicating that activin A may regulate androgen activity in the epididymis.",

Activin A production progressively declines, while local production of follistatin increases to the point where follistatin expression levels are higher in the murine vas deferens than in any other tissue examined.537., 789., 791., 794. These observations suggest that controlling activin activity in the distal epididymis and vas deferens is functionally important. Significantly, the progressive reduction in activin bioactivity parallels the reduction in immune cell number and activity in the epithelium. Expression of TGF\u03b21 also appears to be greatest in the caput of the marmoset and mouse,794., 795. but displays a more distal distribution in the rat.794., 796., 797. Furthermore, TGF\u03b23 was most highly expressed in the corpus of the rat epididymis, but TGF\u03b22 was not detected.797 Removal of the testis or inhibition of SRD5\u03b1 activity increased expression of both TGF\u03b21 and TGF\u03b23, particularly in the caput.796., 798. These studies indicate species-specific differences in TGF\u03b2 expression that are, most likely, androgen-regulated. Functional roles for TGF\u03b2 in the epididymis or vas deferens have yet to be established, but a potential role for TGF\u03b21 in regulating tight junction formation between epithelial cells from the vas deferens has been demonstrated.799 In direct contrast with activin A and TGF\u03b2, NOS enzyme activity and PTGS2 expression are much greater in the cauda epididymis and vas deferens than in the more proximal regions of the epididymis.614., 616., 800., 801.\n",

More invasive procedures such as biopsies are rarely performed, produce limited and selective samples, and have the potential to cause inflammatory reactions themselves. Much is made, therefore, of the relationship between measurements of leukocytes, antibodies and cytokines in seminal plasma, and fertility. However, while there is little doubt that sperm antibodies contribute to infertility, and that elevated cytokines are an indicator of ongoing infection, inflammation or other immune events, the diagnostic significance of cytokines and, especially, leukocytes in the semen is a subject of ongoing debate.",

This is not particularly surprising because these cytokines are present in most biological fluids and are modulated by the general health status of the individual. Elevated cytokine concentrations, both pro- and anti-inflammatory, in seminal plasma are commonly associated with inflammation, infection and increased leukocyte numbers in the male tract, but specific positive and negative associations with infertility of a noninflammatory nature have proven less consistent.819., 820., 821. In a recent evaluation of the extensive literature on this topic, Pilatz and colleagues concluded that, while seminal cytokine profiles might be useful for diagnosis and monitoring of urogenital infections and inflammation, there was no obvious evidence for any associations with poor semen quality or infertility.822 However, a relationship has been reported between NO levels and oxidative stress in seminal plasma and infertility due to varicocele and other vascular anomalies, or prostatic inflammation/autoimmunity.823., 824.\n",

It is fair to say that the role of leukocytes in semen is more complicated than might be expected, and many questions still remain.358., 364., 833.\n",

There is a definite relationship between sperm antibodies and the existence of other autoantibodies, suggesting an important role for genetic factors in predisposition to sperm antibody formation.841., 842.

Although antibody levels in seminal plasma or even blood are frequently quantified, it has been suggested that only antibodies that are actually bound to the sperm, and more specifically the anterior portion of the sperm, should be considered to be of real significance, and then only when a majority of the sperm are affected.2., 835., 848., 849. Hence, studies that use tests that detect sperm bound antibodies (e.g. agglutination and immunobead binding tests) are most likely to provide reliable results.834., 850., 851. Although IgG can cross the reproductive tract epithelium at sites such as the rete testis to bind to sperm,852 it also has been argued that only IgA antibodies are evidence of a specific mucosal immune response and should be considered of greater prognostic value in semen samples. The most rigorous approach to this issue involves confirmation that the antibody binding has functional consequences using a sperm function test, such as the mucus penetration assay, before accepting the pathological significance of the antibodies.2., 835., 849.\n",

This may be due in part to genetic differences in susceptibility to antibody formation, although the prevalence of reproductive tract infections in the population and a lack of suitable treatment options are probably a stronger determinant. In developed nations, the incidence of sperm antibodies is around 5\u201310% of all infertility cases.2., 3. On the other hand, in parts of central Africa where treatment for reproductive tract infection is limited, or there is a reliance on self-medication and alternative therapies, the incidence of sperm antibodies among infertile populations is much higher.853 In considering these figures, it also should be borne in mind that sperm antibodies may be present in the semen or blood of men of proven normal fertility.854 Moreover, in the absence of any other underlying cause being evident, the presence of sperm antibodies tends to be assumed to be the cause of the infertility. It is quite possible that the incidence of infertility due primarily to sperm antibody reactions is lower than these values might suggest. While treatment with high dose corticosteroids has been used with limited success in the past to treat sperm antibodies, sperm washing coupled with intrauterine insemination, in vitro fertilization or intracytoplasmic sperm injection are the current methods of choice.834., 837.\n",

Nonviral causes include mycobacteria (e.g. Mycobacterium leprae and M. tuberculosis) and parasites, such as Filariasis and Malaria. Bacterial orchitis is usually caused by retrograde ascent of urethral pathogens, such as E. coli, Chlamydia trachomatis, and Neisseria gonorrhoeae, and is almost invariably associated with inflammation of the epididymis (epididymo-orchitis). In both clinical and experimental models of infectious orchitis,313., 603., 864. the immunological response to the infection may cause collateral damage to testicular cells, causing obstruction, fibrosis, and displacement or ischemia, and increases the risk of subsequent autoimmune reactions against testicular antigens. Autoimmune orchitis may also develop as a consequence of neoplasia, in response to an external antigenic challenge (e.g. vasectomy or active immunization), or may arise spontaneously, in the sense that no obvious cause can be discerned.859., 860., 865. Whereas infectious orchitis resolves once the infection has been cleared, autoimmunity may lead to chronic inflammatory disease. In contrast with the incidence of sperm autoantibodies, however, autoimmune reactions against spermatogenic cells within the testis appear to be comparatively rare among most human populations.",

There is evidence for immune complex formation in the basement membrane of the seminiferous epithelium,869., 870., 871. and a high prevalence of asymptomatic testicular inflammatory lesions,4., 5. among infertile men. The problem lies in establishing whether these lesions are evidence of a past autoimmune reaction or secondary to inflammation from other causes. The testis is one of the organs that is affected in PGA syndromes, which are caused by failure of normal mechanisms of tolerance,166., 167., 872. suggesting that other genetic causes for autoimmune orchitis may exist. There is some evidence of an association of orchitis with other autoimmune inflammatory diseases, particularly vasculitis (inflammation of the blood vessels) in men.873 A genetic predisposition for development of autoimmunity may require a secondary trigger, in the form of a precipitating infection, physical trauma to the reproductive tract or other inflammatory event, in order to proceed to actual autoimmune orchitis.",

Most of these models involve immunization with testicular antigens, including spermatogenic cell, somatic cell, and extracellular matrix antigens, using complete adjuvants (containing active or inactivated microbial agents), or adoptive transfer of lymphocytes from animals with on-going autoimmune orchitis. However, at least one model of induced orchitis involving subcutaneous injection of syngeneic (genetically identical) spermatogenic cells into a susceptible strain of mice has been described.876., 877. A particularly interesting model of orchitis development occurs subsequent to vasectomy in some animals. Whereas vasectomy leads to sperm antibody formation alone in most strains of rats and mice, vasectomy results in a rapid progression to full-blown orchitis in the Lewis rat,349., 350., 351. and SWR/J mouse.878 Similar responses to vasectomy or epididymal obstruction have been observed in the rabbit,879 guinea pig,880 and rhesus monkey.881 Finally, removal of the thymus gland around postnatal day three in mice causes polyglandular autoimmunity, which can include autoimmune orchitis similar to that found in humans,155., 874., 875. indicating that immunoregulation by T cells is involved in the normal protection of at least some testis-specific antigens. These models have been crucial to the development of our concepts of the control of immune responses in the testis.",

            "text": "Although the models of experimental autoimmune orchitis differ in respect of the method of induction, there are common features in the progression of disease, which are summarized here. The onset of autoimmune orchitis in animals generally involves the appearance of testicular antibodies and immune complexes, followed by infiltration and activation of macrophages, dendritic cells and effector lymphocytes, invasion of the seminiferous tubules, sloughing of germ cells and focal necrosis, accumulation of neutrophils and/or eosinophils, and finally aspermatogenesis.311., 314., 331., 885., 886., 887. The epididymis and vas deferens are frequently involved. In adoptive transfer studies in mice, it was shown that CD4+ T cells, but not antibody, can transfer orchitis from one animal to another, clearly implicating a cellular rather than humorally-mediated mechanism of disease development.267., 268., 864. In adoptive transfer, moreover, the early disease almost invariably occurs in the region where the seminiferous tubules connect to the rete testis,267., 268. consistent with the fact that this is where access to the antigens of spermatogenesis is likely to be greatest,64., 73., 267. and there is a greater concentration of MHC class II positive macrophages.267., 268., 314., 331., 888. In the adjuvant-free model of induced orchitis, a similar pattern of disease initiation has been observed in this region.889 Active immunization protocols using adjuvant, on the other hand, cause a more widespread induction of disease throughout the testis.267., 311.\n",

Several immunodominant antigens have been identified in the rat, and include antigens that are not specific to the testis.291 The pro-inflammatory cytokines, TNF and IFN\u03b3, FAS and FASL, and NOS2 have been identified as potential causative factors in the development of orchitis, principally by stimulating antigen-presentation activity and spermatogenic cell apoptosis.595., 890., 891., 892., 893., 894. Although IL6 production by testicular macrophages increased during experimental autoimmune orchitis in rats,895 and was implicated in the disruption of the inter-Sertoli cell tight junctions,896 administration of IL6 has been shown to inhibit the progression of orchitis in LPS-resistant mice.897 The progression of orchitis may also be inhibited by IL10 and by androgens.898., 899.

Epididymitis also may have noninfectious origins in various medical procedures, the arrhythmia drug amiodarone, trauma, physical stress, vasectomy, urinary reflux, neoplasia, postinfectious and systemic inflammation, vasculitis, and systemic autoimmunity.11., 12., 860., 910., 911. Vasitis is relatively rare and is usually caused by injury, bacterial infection, and following surgical manipulation, postvasectomy or following prostatectomy.912 It may present as pain or be asymptomatic. If the inflammatory response in the epididymis or vas deferens is severe enough, this can lead to damage to the mucosal epithelium and/or obstructive lesions that may inhibit fertility. Prostatitis and vesiculitis are most commonly caused by bacterial infections, although antibiotic-resistant chronic prostatitis/chronic pelvic pain has suspected inflammatory, probably autoimmune, origins.10., 860., 910., 911.\n",

            "text": "Experimentally, epididymitis can be induced by retrograde inoculation with bacteria, such as E. coli, via the vas deferens, which leads to epididymitis, vasitis and orchitis, but is complicated by the presence of the bacteria itself.95., 809., 916., 917., 918. Noninfectious models of epididymitis involve active immunization, neonatal thymectomy, and vasectomy. Epididymitis (actually epididymo-orchitis) and vasitis can occur following active immunization with testicular extracts in the presence of suitable adjuvants in rats, mice and guinea-pigs.267., 314., 331. Passive transfer of T cells from mice immunized in this manner also leads to epididymitis, with testicular involvement initially confined to the region around the rete testis and the efferent ducts.267., 268., 890. Subcutaneous injection of syngeneic testicular spermatogenic cells into mice in the absence of adjuvant causes orchitis without epididymitis,876 but passive transfer of the lymphocytes from these mice after stimulation in vitro, favors the induction of epididymitis.919., 920. In other words, the transfer of T cells activated specifically against spermatogenic antigens selectively induces epididymitis in nonimmunized mice.889 Removal of the thymus at 3 days of age in mice, which abrogates peripheral tolerance mediated by regulatory T cells,921 initially causes epididymovasitis in the postpubertal period, followed by an increasing, but always smaller, incidence of orchitis many weeks later.874., 922. Likewise, mice with a targeted deletion of the immunoregulatory AIRE transcription factor developed sperm antibodies and leukocytic infiltrates in the epididymis, without orchitis.923 Vasectomized A/J mice that have been immunized with syngeneic testicular spermatogenic cells develop epididymitis independent of orchitis,924., 925. suggesting that the epididymis can be the primary site of immune reactions following vasectomy, as well. The epididymis is also more susceptible than the testis to spermatic granuloma formation in humans and in experimental mice.926., 927. Taken altogether, these observations highlight a greater susceptibility of the epididymis to inflammation, relative to the testis, when responses to spermatogenic antigens occur. Accordingly, detailed studies in mice have established that the immunogenetics underlying susceptibility to autoimmune orchitis and epididymitis are quite distinct.906\n",

Similar responses in the vas deferens and accessory glands may interfere with seminal fluid production and sperm transport. As in the testis, these disruptions of function may be due to the actions of the activated immune cells, but may also be due to altered epithelial cell or stromal cell function, through the activation of TLR signaling pathways, pro-inflammatory cytokines and other inflammatory mediators.

Studies have shown that spermatogenic cell autoantigens are not confined behind the Sertoli cell tight junctions, and are expressed by spermatogonia and the early spermatocytes.934 Moreover, there is clear evidence that the barrier is incomplete in the epithelium of the rete testis. Significantly, orchitis can be passively transferred to na\u00efve mice by lymphocytes from mice with active autoimmune orchitis.267., 268., 919. In many seasonally breeding species, annual regression of both the later spermatogenic cells and blood\u2013testis barrier occurs without inducing overt inflammation or autoimmunity.72., 866. Finally, the blood\u2013testis barrier cannot explain the enhanced survival of grafts within the interstitial tissue.14., 266. On balance, the data lead to the conclusion that the blood\u2013testis barrier does not prevent exposure of germ cell antigens to the immune system, indeed antibodies and lymphocytes specific for spermatogenic antigens may be a normal feature of the circulating immune repertoire.854 Although the sequestration of a large proportion of the antigenic burden behind the blood\u2013testis barrier no doubt plays a role in this process, it cannot be the primary explanation for functional immune privilege in the testis.",

This enhanced survival is not simply due to the reduced ambient temperature of the testis, as grafts to the equally hypothermic skin of the ear are not preserved,266 while grafts continue to survive in testes that have been translocated to the abdominal cavity.266., 936., 937. Moreover, the efferent lymphatics of the testis do not show any evidence of functional deficiency.13 However, intratesticular parathyroid allografts fail to survive in rats sensitized against the donor antigens, while long-established intratesticular allografts are rapidly rejected following active immunization of the recipient with donor tissue.14 These observations led to the hypothesis that local immunoregulation mechanisms are responsible for graft survival, and, more specifically, that the inductive phase of the immune response is suppressed within the testis and/or its draining lymph nodes. In other words, the immune system may be unable to recognize and/or respond to foreign antigens within the testicular environment.",

However, just as intratesticular grafts produce different outcomes in different studies, studies on transplantation of testicular tissue have met with variable degrees of success. Early observations were that fetal and postnatal testis tissues are viable as grafts under the kidney capsule of outbred rats, but that adult testis tissue is quickly rejected.941., 942. Perhaps surprisingly, transplantation of fragments of intact testicular tissue from numerous species under the skin of immunodeficient mice tends to be extremely successful, with vascularization, normal steroidogenesis and even complete spermatogenesis becoming established, although there is no exit for the spermatozoa that are produced.943 The ability of spermatogenesis to occur in such grafts is probably related to the reduced temperature of the skin, but immunocompromised recipient animals are generally required to avoid rejection responses. On the other hand, adult testis allografts have been observed to survive under the kidney capsule in immunocompetent mice,489 and allogeneic transplantation of spermatogenic cells, which were subsequently able to undergo normal spermatogenic development, have been successfully performed in several domestic species with intact immune systems.944., 945., 946. Kimmel and colleagues observed that human testis xenografts to the murine kidney failed to survive in intact mice, but survival was possible in recipient mice with an inactivating deletion of MHC class II expression, thereby implicating a CD4+ T cell-mediated rejection process.947 Discovering the reasons why different models produce such widely different outcomes may provide a better understanding of the fundamental requirements for immunological privilege in the testis.",

In this study, FAS-FASL interaction was implicated in the prevention of antigen-specific responses within the testis, and subsequently, in other immune-privileged or immune-deficient sites.958 It was proposed that T cells entering the testis and becoming activated by exposure to their respective antigen are immediately killed by interaction between FAS on their surface and FASL, either expressed on, or secreted by, the Sertoli cells. While this was an attractive hypothesis, a number of concerns regarding the FASL expression hypothesis as an overarching explanation for immune privilege arose. Several groups found that expression of FASL did not confer immunoprotection in their own studies in the testis or in other tissues, and in fact caused quite virulent inflammatory reactions in some cases.959., 960. FASL also appeared to be expressed at relatively high levels in epithelia of human tissues not generally thought of as immunologically privileged, such as the esophagus and lung.961 Finally, Kimmel and colleagues reported being unable to detect FASL expression at all in normal human testes which had been flushed of all peripheral blood cell contamination prior to collection of RNA.947\n",

In the rat and human, testicular macrophages and dendritic cells express MHC class II throughout the interstitium,239., 246., 266., 965. but studies on the mouse testis indicate that expression of MHC class II is concentrated on cells in regions adjacent to the rete testis.267., 268. A greatly reduced number of MHC class II positive cells in the ram testis is consistent with the relatively low number of resident macrophages in this species.68 In light of all the observations, however, it appears unlikely that a lack of MHC class II-positive antigen-presenting cells is a contributing factor in testicular immune privilege. Differences in the distribution of such cells, however, may be reflected in differences in susceptibility and development of autoimmune reactions between species, or possibly even between different strains. During the development of experimental autoimmune orchitis, which requires overcoming peripheral tolerance to intratesticular antigens, MHC class II expression and the cells bearing these molecules\u2014dendritic cells and macrophages\u2014are increased within the testis and in the draining lymph nodes.292., 887.\n",

Obviously, the MHC class II-expressing antigen-presenting cells of the testis must play a crucial role in this process, by creating a tolerogenic environment. The balance of data suggest that the majority of dendritic cells and macrophages in the mouse display reduced expression of MHC class II molecule and the regulatory CD80/CD86 co-receptors,267., 271. suggesting that they may be more likely to promote tolerance, but this does not appear to be true for the rat.266., 272. However, expression of other co-regulatory ligands and receptors, for example CD40LG or inhibitory variants of CD80/CD86,975 have yet to be investigated in these cells. On the other hand, it is well-established that the macrophages of the rat and mouse display the anti-inflammatory/immunosuppressive M2 phenotype, manifesting as preferential production of immunosuppressive cytokines, such as IL10, and a reduced capacity for T cell activation.269., 270., 275., 287., 288. This suggests that the predominantly immunosuppressive phenotype of the testicular macrophages is a critical element in maintaining testicular immune privilege, and that deviation of the macrophage and dendritic cell phenotype toward support of cell-mediated immunity is an essential event leading to autoimmune orchitis.272., 292., 887., 893.\n",

This model of tolerance in the testis is consistent with the presence in the testicular interstitial tissue of Treg cells,310., 885. but also of NK and NK T cells (Hedger MP and Aridi DZ, unpublished data).70 Cells of the NK lineage are able to modulate dendritic cell activity to control adaptive immune responses.976., 977., 978. These cells play a key role in promoting graft survival,149., 168. and have been implicated in the generation of CD8+ regulatory/suppressor T cells in another immune privileged site, the anterior chamber of the eye.150., 979., 980. Consequently, it is anticipated that intratesticular NK and NK T cells are involved in production of regulatory/suppressor T cells specific to the testis. Finally, a role for \u03b3\u03b4 T cells, a minor subset of T cells that possess an alternate TCR structure, has been invoked in suppressing autoimmune reactions in bacterial-induced autoimmune orchitis in the mouse, in part through production of IL10 and TGF\u03b2.313., 903. This lymphocyte subset also appears to be involved in maintaining immune privilege in the eye.981\n",

Such procedures have even been used for protection of islet transplants in humans, with some success and controversy.991 Although the immunoprotective properties of the Sertoli cells appear to be dependent upon their number and ability to form intercellular tight junctions and tubule-like structures, survival of co-transplanted cells adjacent to, but outside, these structures indicates that the protective mechanism does not require the creation of a physical barrier.992 Protection appears to be an inherent property of the Sertoli cell, involving factors expressed on the surface or secreted from the cell (Figure 19.17\n).",

Mouse Sertoli cells increase expression of PD-L1, but not positive co-stimulatory molecules, in response to IFN\u03b3 in vitro.594 Human Sertoli cells were found to suppress MHC class II and inflammatory gene expression in human endothelial cell cultures stimulated with INF\u03b3 or TNF, and to inhibit the ability of these cells to stimulate spleen lymphocyte proliferation.995 Finally, Sertoli cells are similar to macrophages in that they possess an enormous capacity for phagocytosis of senescent cells, cell debris, and other potentially antigenic complexes. Together with the inherent ability of the Sertoli cell to provide a highly supportive environment for cell growth and differentiation,996 these characteristics no doubt all contribute to the unique graft-protecting abilities of the Sertoli cell.",

Production of TGF\u03b21 by co-transplanted Sertoli cells has been implicated in protection of syngeneic transplants of pancreatic islets in streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats and nonobese diabetic mice.990., 1000. There is evidence that FASL expression on the Sertoli cell may enhance graft survival, as well.988., 1000., 1001. Sertoli cells produce several complement inhibitors, as well as inhibitors of granzyme B, which is a lytic molecule produced by cytotoxic lymphocytes.1002., 1003., 1004. Furthermore, IL6, which is secreted by the Sertoli cell under hormonal control, has a number of immunoregulatory properties, stimulating the production of anti-inflammatory cytokines by T cells,125 and inhibiting the maturation of dendritic cells from circulating monocytes.234 Cultured murine Sertoli cells progressively produce indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO), an enzyme which catalyzes the metabolism of tryptophan, and which has been shown to stimulate dendritic cell-initiated tolerance,1005 and to stimulate the development of Treg cells in tumors and in pregnancy.1006., 1007. Silencing of IDO with si-mRNA inhibited the ability of these cells to reduce diabetes in non-obese diabetic mice.1006 Finally, mice with a Sertoli cell-specific deletion of the androgen receptor have a defective blood\u2013testis barrier, the testis becomes infiltrated by macrophages, neutrophils, plasma cells, and eosinophils, and they develop antibodies against spermatogenic cells.1008 This suggests that loss of androgen regulation in the Sertoli cell leads to a loss of testicular immune privilege.",

            "text": "It seems likely that Leydig cells actually promote inflammation-related responses of the testis, as these cells produce several inflammatory mediators constitutively (MIF, NOS2) or in response to inflammatory stimuli (IL1, IL6, and CCL2).226., 276., 278., 285., 390., 391., 392., 503., 504., 641., 1009. These cells also play a central role in the regulation of interstitial fluid formation in both hCG-hyperstimulation and LPS-induced inflammation through control of endothelial cell permeability.397., 1010., 1011. Conversely, early studies established that mouse Leydig cells, but not other testicular cells, bound to lymphocytes, macrophages and eosinophils specifically in vitro,1012., 1013. and that the presence of rat or mouse Leydig cells could inhibit lymphocyte proliferation responses in vitro.982 This binding may have been due, at least in part, to a variant of VCAM1 expressed on the Leydig cell surface,1014 while inhibition of lymphocytes by Leydig cells in vitro appears to involve both direct contact and secretion of soluble inhibitory factors.1015 The Leydig cell-secreted cytokine, MIF, is a potent inhibitor of cytotoxic T cell and NK cell activity,1016., 1017., 1018. and it may be that a function of this cytokine in the testis is to restrain cell killing in the absence of an overt immunological challenge. However, the most significant role of the Leydig cells in mediating immune control of the testis may lie in their ability to facilitate recruitment of resident macrophages in the testis (Figure 19.17).69., 226., 293., 296. Junctional specializations between Leydig cells and resident macrophages mediate close physical attachment of these cells in the normal testis,240., 244. and the immunoregulatory significance of these interactions has yet to be explored in any detail.",

A more general effect of androgens on the Th1/Th2 cytokine balance was demonstrated by the fact that administration of testosterone to hypogonadal men stimulated baseline IL10 levels and inhibited IL1\u03b2 and TNF levels in serum.1019 However, in vivo evidence for local immunoregulation by androgens in the testis is conflicting. Androgens do not appear to directly regulate macrophage or lymphocyte numbers,226., 227., 295. and manipulation of Leydig cell function and androgen production by a number of methods had no effect on survival of parathyroid or pancreatic cell allografts in the rat testis.935., 936., 986., 1020. On the other hand, treatment with exogenous testosterone suppressed the progression of autoimmune orchitis in rats, by reducing the intratesticular accumulation of macrophages and CD4+ T cells, and pro-inflammatory/Th1 cytokine expression, while increasing the number of Treg cells.899\n",

Estrogens regulate dendritic cell differentiation and activity,217., 218. and overexpression of CYP19A, leading to an elevated estrogen-to-androgen ratio causes progressively severe inflammation in the mouse testis, with massive proliferation and activation of intratesticular macrophages and testicular damage.1021 Overall, it remains difficult to say what important role androgens and estrogens may play in regulating immune responses in the testis. Moreover, it should be noted that in addition to steroids, Leydig cells produce several other factors with lymphocyte regulating activity. These include the antiproliferative pro-opiomelanocortin peptides,223., 1022. and MIF, which notwithstanding its pro-inflammatory functions, inhibits the cell killing activity of cytotoxic T cells and NK cells.1016., 1017., 1018.\n",

However, it has been demonstrated that these lyso-GPCs are specific ligands for CD1D-restricted T cells, suggesting a role for these molecules in controlling NK T-cell responses and activity in the testis.1032 Other lysophospholipds, such as lysophosphatidic acid and sphingosine-1-phosphate, for which G protein-coupled receptors are already known, have been implicated in regulating spermatogenesis and spermatogenic cell survival.1033 The production, regulation, and activity of these molecules within the testis certainly deserve further study.",

Studies by Kern and colleagues confirmed that the addition of the broad PTGS inhibitor, indomethacin, to cultures of rat testicular macrophages stimulated their production of IL1\u03b2, IL6 and TNF in response to LPS-stimulation and blocked their inhibitory effect on peripheral blood lymphocyte proliferation in vitro.269., 277. It was suggested that PGE2 might be responsible for the testicular macrophage phenotype that favors immune privilege. Working against this hypothesis, testicular macrophages produce little PGE2 under normal conditions, and blocking PTGS2 activity in vivo or in vitro did not affect the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines in the testis in response to LPS.276., 615., 619. However, chronic inhibition of PTGS2 did inhibit interstitial fluid formation in rat normal testes, even though this treatment ameliorated the loss of fluid that usually occurs during LPS-induced inflammation.619 These data indicate that prostanoids are involved in control of vascular tone in the normal and inflamed testis. This suggests that the use of anti-inflammatories by men with marginal fertility might need to be considered as a factor when undertaking assisted reproductive therapies.",

Transplantation of rat spermatogenic stem cells into immunocompetent mice, producing epididymal spermatozoa in a small number of animals, has also been reported.1053 A characteristic feature of transplantation in immunologically intact animals appears to be an increase in peritubular macrophages and macrophage invasion into the seminiferous epithelium and tubule lumen.1054., 1055. Whether these cells may be serving an immunoprotective function, or are simply responding to an inflammatory stimulus from degenerating spermatogenic cells, is unclear. In a limited study of the immunological parameters affecting spermatogonial transplantation,33 Kanatsu-Shinohara and colleagues found that allogeneic transplantation of mouse spermatogonia was only partially successful, with arrest at the round spermatid stage in highly disorganized tubules, mononuclear cell infiltration in the interstitial tissue and eventual rejection after several months. Mature spermatozoa and successful natural mating was able to be achieved by the use of donor stem cells from immature testes and treatment of the recipient animal with anti-CD4 and anti-CD8 antibodies or the immunosuppressive agent, rapamycin, to inhibit T cell activity.",

This appears comparable to the variable success experienced in studies on engraftment into the interstitial tissue. It is not yet clear what the critical factors may be, but it should be noted that the spermatogonial cells normally are injected via the rete testis or efferent ducts, and into testes that lack mature germ cells. The rete testis is the most susceptible region of the testis for initiation of autoimmune reactions.267., 268., 888. It is possible that the cytotoxic treatments used to deplete the endogenous spermatogenic cells may increase the risk of graft failure and rejection, or that the lack of endogenous spermatogenic cells may contribute to an absence or failure of tolerance to these cells, or alterations in the local immunoprotective environment. Possibly the most important factor that requires investigation is the composition of the spermatogonial cell preparation itself, and the degree to which it might be \u201ccontaminated\u201d with resident testicular macrophages or Sertoli cells, as these have potent immunoregulatory properties.\n",

The existence of multiple mechanisms may help to explain why orchitis and testicular autoimmunity affects only a minor subset of patients with PGA syndromes, and are not universally induced by day 3 postthymectomy in rats and mice. Moreover, based on the evidence from transplantation studies, it would appear that the ability of antigens within the testis to evade the immune system is not an absolute property of the testis or its draining lymph nodes, but is provisional upon certain criteria being met, such as the absence of testicular damage or other precipitating events. Tissues traditionally identified as being immunologically privileged, such as the testis and anterior chamber of the eye, may simply lie at one extreme of a range, as many of the mechanisms implicated in testicular immune privilege also exist to a more or lesser extent in most tissues. It might be most appropriate to think of immune privilege as simply a manifestation of a particularly effective immunoregulatory environment. The need for enhanced immunoregulation in tissues such as the testis or the eye may be related to the burden of the autoantigens present, and/or the need to prevent active inflammation causing damage to particularly susceptible tissues. While it is debatable whether autoimmunity to spermatogenic cells is more catastrophic to the organism than autoimmune gastritis, diabetes or thyroiditis, there must have been considerable evolutionary selection pressure applied to ensure that the immune system was restrained from attacking the post-meiotic germ cells the moment that they appeared during sexual maturation.",

It is evident that the epithelial tight junctions of the epididymis and vas deferens are not as elaborate or effective as those of the blood\u2013testis barrier.72., 86., 91., 92., 93. Moreover, leukocytes\u2014dendritic cells, macrophages and CD8+ T cells, in particular\u2014are commonly found within the epithelium of these tissues and appear to be able to have contact with the luminal contents.65., 96., 98., 102., 334.

Expression of inflammatory and immunoregulatory molecules and the distribution of immune cells in the epididymis and vas deferens is highly regionalized. Specifically, there is a much greater number of dendritic cells, macrophages and T cells in the proximal epididymis, than in the more distal epididymis and vas deferens, and the dendritic cells appear to be more active.96., 98., 102. Recently, it has been discovered that the immunoregulatory enzyme, IDO, is highly expressed in this region of the epididymis, and pro-inflammatory cytokine expression is higher than normal in the caput epididymis of IDO-deficient mice.1060., 1061. Moreover, IDO is regulated through the SMAD2/3/4 signaling pathway that is activated by activin A,1005 and activin A levels are also highest in this region of the epididymis.789 It can be proposed that activin A may drive IDO expression in the proximal epididymis, and together these immunoregulatory proteins induce a tolerogenic program in the intraepithelial dendritic cell and T cell populations. Although this hypothesis still remains to be confirmed, this would provide an effective mechanism for promoting tolerance to sperm antigens as they emerge from the immune privileged environment of the testis. The activity of Treg cells has been shown to control the pattern and severity of autoimmune responses to vasectomy in mice.957\n",

Moreover, epithelial cells of the epididymis and vas deferens express the glycosylphosphatidylinositol\u2013anchored protein, CD52,1067 which is a co-stimulatory molecule for Treg cell development,1068 but may also play a role in protecting sperm against complement-mediated damage.1069., 1070. Consequently, removal of defective sperm from the epididymal lumen by the principal cells and presentation of their antigens to the intraepithelial lymphocytes might present an additional mechanism for controlling sperm autoimmunity in the epididymis, and possibly the vas deferens as well.",

Significantly, NK cells are able to recognize and destroy infected or transformed cells without prior immunization, and so can act independently of the adaptive immune response. In addition to the testicular macrophages, both the Sertoli cell and Leydig cell are able to recognize and respond to bacterial pathogens directly,376., 386., 387., 390., 392., 994. through expression of specific TLRs on their surface. The importance of the TLRs in protecting against infection in the male reproductive tract is indicated by the fact that pathogens can increase their virulence by subverting the function of these molecules, for example, in the case of uropathogenic strains of E. coli.275., 436. Suppression of TLR expression throughout the male reproductive tract also appears to be a strategy utilized by HIV to evade immunity.784\n",

Although vaccines against gonadotropins actually have been trialed,1128 it is unlikely that such an approach would be readily applicable to contraception in men. Other contraceptive vaccine studies have concentrated on antigens involved in critical sperm functions.1129., 1130. Such approaches raise concerns related to safety, efficacy and reversibility, but progress has been impeded largely by the issue of variability of immune responses after vaccination.1131 Genetic differences in immune response genes in the human population and the complexity of the immune system itself might make it difficult to develop a single vaccine that works effectively enough in all men to compete with currently available hormone-based approaches to contraception. Another concern would be the risk of inducing more widespread autoimmune disease, since there is an established relationship between sperm autoimmunity and autoimmunity in general.841., 842. Furthermore, it may be difficult to develop a contraceptive vaccine that is entirely reversible. Nonetheless, the targeting of critical reproductive antigens to control fertility is a very attractive idea, which will most likely continue to engage reproductive immunologists. Most benefit from such studies may come from the identification and characterization of molecules with crucial functions in fertility which might be used as molecular targets for other drug agents that are not nonimmunologically-based.",

If there are immunoregulatory mechanisms that are more or less unique to the testis, for example, where extended graft survival has already been shown to be feasible, then elucidation of these mechanisms has the potential to lead to entirely novel methods of reducing graft rejection in general. The current methods used in transplantation medicine involve broad spectrum immunosuppressives, principally cyclic peptides of fungal origin that interfere with T cell signaling and prevent proliferation of these immune cells in a nonselective manner.1132., 1133. These drugs have considerable harmful side-effects, such as generalized immune suppression, nephrotoxicity and inherent tumorigenicity,1134., 1135. and require close monitoring and adjustment for the remainder of life. They also have damaging effects on testicular steroidogenesis and spermatogenesis.1136., 1137. Real alternatives or adjuncts to these agents, based on more physiological regulatory principles, would definitely be desirable. In particular, the unique immunological properties of the Sertoli cell raise hopes of an exciting new therapeutic opportunity in cell-based gene therapy.989., 1138. Such applications could include, not only the use of ectopic Sertoli cells to support pancreatic islet engraftment, for example, but also the employment of genetically-engineered Sertoli cell lines for delivery of therapeutic proteins. Time will tell if such a cell-based gene therapy approach is clinically viable.",

Chronic pelvic and perineal pain is normally associated with epididymo-orchitis, vasitis and/or prostatitis.10., 11., 12., 860., 910., 912. These conditions are usually due to infection or physical damage, but the ongoing production of endogenous ligands and danger signals, autoimmunity or alterations in regulatory signaling may cause inflammation to persist long after the infection has cleared or the trauma has been repaired.10., 12., 1139. Prostatic hyperplasia and tumors also may be a cause, and inflammation may arise spontaneously in a susceptible subpopulation of patients. These chronic inflammatory pain conditions are poorly understood, and frequently difficult to treat.12 Treatment alternatives are limited to standard anti-inflammatory and pain-alleviating measures, and the actual mechanisms involved are not well-characterized. Several prostanoids, including PGE2 and PGI2, have pain-inducing properties,1140 and there is an association between chronic pelvic pain and production of the pro-inflammatory cytokines, IL1\u03b2, TNF, IL8 and IFN\u03b3, in particular,1139., 1141. but research in this area is still in need of a rational hypothetical background. Given that these conditions are so poorly understood, extremely debilitating and frequently untreatable, they provide a real opportunity for effective future investigations.",

Spermatogenic cells are susceptible to immunological responses and activation of immunity against sperm or other elements of the reproductive tract can lead to androgen insufficiency, infertility or chronic inflammation. Inflammation and immune activation directly inhibit the hypothalamic-pituitary-Leydig cell axis at several levels, interfere with essential interactions between the Sertoli cells and spermatogenic cells and increase the potential for sperm antibody formation, a major cause of infertility in men. Nonetheless, spermatogenic cells normally are ignored by the immune system, as are grafts of foreign tissue placed within the testicular capsule. Traditional explanations for the protection of these cells, based on \u2018immune privilege\u2019 of the testis maintained by the blood\u2013testis barrier or by exclusion of immune cells, are not consistent with either the histological organization of the reproductive tract or modern concepts of immunoregulation. A more realistic understanding of the control of immune responses in the male reproductive tract encompasses the activity of immunoregulatory macrophages and lymphocytes and peripheral tolerance, as well as active suppression of antigen-specific immunity by somatic cells involving regulatory cytokines, androgenic steroids and other anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive factors. Dysregulation of this normal environment caused by infection, local or systemic inflammation, toxic insult, active immunization or deletion of regulatory T cells may activate the circulating immune cells, leading to a range of effects from temporary disturbance of spermatogenesis and steroidogenesis, all the way through to the creation of testis-reactive T cells and autoimmunity. Equally important for maintaining fertility, it appears that the restraints on antigen-specific immunity in the male reproductive tract are counterbalanced by enhanced local innate immune mechanisms and conventional mucosal immunity. In fact, it is increasingly evident that inflammatory signaling pathways are fundamental to the control of normal functions of the seminiferous epithelium, and possibly other functions throughout the male reproductive tract. Studies also suggest that establishment of male reproductive function is linked to the normal development of the local immune environment.",

Signaling via MYD88 occurs through the IL1 receptor-associated kinase (IRAK) and TNFR-associated factor 6 (TRAF6), leading to degradation of the NF\u03baB repressor protein I\u03baB, and activation of mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK8 and MAPK14).

These hypothalamic peptides stimulate secretion of the gonadotropins (LH and FSH) and adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), respectively. LH acts directly on the Leydig cells to stimulate steroidogenesis, while FSH controls the development and activity of the Sertoli cells. ACTH stimulates secretion of corticosteroids by the adrenals, which generally exert direct inhibitory effects on Leydig cell steroidogenic activity. Activation of macrophage function by an inflammatory stimulus triggers a cascade of events and secretions, which interact with the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis at all levels, inhibiting gonadotropin secretion and steroidogenesis and stimulating the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis. There is evidence that inhibitory regulation of steroidogenesis in response to inflammation also involves direct neural pathways from the CNS.

            "text": "FIGURE 19.17: Intercompartmental interactions regulating steroidogenesis, spermatogenesis and immune responses in the adult testis. Within the seminiferous epithelium, the Sertoli cell supports and regulates spermatogenesis, through production of cytokines, including interleukin-1\u03b1 (IL1\u03b1), IL6, and activin. Production of these cytokines is stimulated by the presence of the spermatogenic cells. Spermatogenic cells also produce tumor necrosis factor (TNF) and NO, which regulate Sertoli cell functions, such as the maintenance of the blood\u2013testis barrier. Sertoli cells possess a number of immunosuppressive activities, which include expression of indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO), HLA-G, programmed death-1 ligand-1 (PD-L1), and FAS ligand (FASL). Spermatogenic antigens released from the seminiferous epithelium, together with local production of immunoregulatory molecules, including IL10, transforming growth factor-\u03b2 (TGF\u03b2), activin, prostaglandins/leukotrienes (PG/LT), and lyso-glycerophosphatidylcholines (lyso-GPCs), create an environment that promotes tolerogenic responses (alternatively activated resident macrophages, Treg cells) and innate immunity (NK cells, cytotoxic T cell), while inhibiting cell-mediated immunity (helper T cells). Leydig cells are responsible for recruiting macrophages into the testis and may have further immunomodulatory actions through production of androgens, and other molecules with immunoregulatory actions, such as prostaglandins (PGs). DC, dendritic cells; NK, NK cells: CTL, cytotoxic lymphocytes; Th, helper T cells; Treg, regulatory T cells.",
