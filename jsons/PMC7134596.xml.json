Among various open reading frames identified, the replicase gene encodes two overlapping polyproteins, pp1a and pp1ab, and comprises approximately two\u2010thirds of the genome. Since the viral polyproteins are largely processed by the main protease (Mpro), and based on the successful development of efficacious antiviral agents targeting 3C\u2010like proteases in other viruses, this \u201cessential\u201d protease is considered as a prime target for anti\u2010SARS drug development [7, 8].

A total of 104 compounds protected permissive Vero cells (African green monkey kidney cells) from SARS\u2010CoV infection. Identification of inhibitors of SARS\u2010CoV Mpro from this pool of compounds using conventional HPLC\u2010based assays is labor\u2010intensive and time consuming. Here, we report the enzymatic characterization of a recombinant SARS\u2010CoV Mpro with authentic SARS\u2010CoV Mpro amino acid sequence and the employment of a continuous fluorescence\u2010based assay to identify novel small molecule inhibitors of SARS\u2010CoV Mpro. The efficacies of the 2 selected inhibitors have also been evaluated in cell\u2010based antiviral assays. Our study has defined the kinetic parameters of SARS\u2010CoV Mpro in HPLC\u2010based and continuous fluorescence\u2010based assays and validated the usefulness of the fluorescence\u2010based assay in HTS.

Since the additional amino acid sequence present in recombinant Mpro resulting from cloning procedures might have undesirable properties in in vitro or in vivo assaying systems, we engineered the recombinant SARS\u2010CoV Mpro in a way that the final purified recombinant SARS\u2010CoV Mpro will have amino acid sequence identical to that of the authentic SARS\u2010CoV Mpro. After successive purifications employing affinity chromatography, factor Xa cleavage, anion\u2010exchange chromatography, and size\u2010exclusion chromatography, we obtained a purified SARS\u2010CoV Mpro with a k\ncat/K\nm value=2.4 \u00d7 103 M\u22121s\u22121 using synthetic substrate SP1 and a k\ncat/K\nm value=2.9 \u00d7 104 M\u22121\ns\u22121 using fluorogenic substrate SP2. The kinetic parameters obtained were comparable to that of other viral 3C\u2010like proteases reported [16, 17]. We noticed that the k\ncat/K\nm value (calculated to be 1.8 \u00d7 102 M\u22121\ns\u22121) published by Lai's group on a synthetic peptide substrate (H2N\u2010TSAVLQSGFRK\u2010COOH) [18, 19] is about 10\u2010fold lower than the one we obtained with our synthetic peptide substrate SP1 (H2N\u2010TSAVLQSGFRKW\u2010COOH; k\ncat/K\nm value=2.4 \u00d7 103 M\u22121\ns\u22121). Aside from differences in purification procedures and assaying conditions, and slight difference in amino acid sequence between the two peptides, we do not have an explanation for the apparent discrepancy between the results obtained by the two groups.",

As little as 6.5 nM of the SARS\u2010CoV Mpro could be detected in the assaying system we employed (data not shown). This ultra\u2010sensitive substrate, however, could not be used at concentrations higher than 10 \u03bcM due to its internal quenching effects [15]; this property rendered SP2 unsuitable for the determination of K\nm of the assay system. Nevertheless, SP2 has been demonstrated to be an excellent substrate for HTS purposes and for evaluation of inhibitor potencies.",

The fact that they inhibited the SARS\u2010CoV Mpro with K\ni values around 10 \u03bcM protected Vero cells from viral infection at comparable concentrations and exhibited low cytotoxicity towards Vero cells makes them promising leads for anti\u2010SARS drug development. Further investigations using analogues (CB5751 and CB5173) of these two SARS\u2010CoV Mpro inhibitors suggested that the position of the nitro group in both inhibitors contributes substantially to their inhibitory activities; changing the 2\u2010nitro group to 3\u2010nitro group (Fig. 4C, D) readily reduced the compounds' ability to inhibit the SARS\u2010CoV Mpro (Fig. 6\n). We speculate that the 2\u2010nitro group may be involved in forming productive bonding in the inhibitor\u2010enzyme complex. Further structure\u2010activity relationship studies employing more analogues of the identified compounds and site\u2010directed mutagenesis with the SARS\u2010CoV Mpro will help us to elucidate the mode of actions of these two novel inhibitors. While this manuscript is in preparation, a number of groups reported the cloning and production of different versions of the SARS\u2010CoV Mpro [20, 21]. Others described the development of in vitro assays for screening SARS\u2010CoV Mpro inhibitors [22, 23]. We report here the detailed kinetic analysis of a recombinant SARS\u2010CoV Mpro with amino acid sequence identical to that of the authentic SARS\u2010CoV Mpro and the successful identification of potent small molecule inhibitors of the Mpro with demonstrated anti\u2010SARS\u2010CoV activities in cellular models. With the establishment of assaying systems to examine the in vitro cleavage and the cellular anti\u2010SARS\u2010CoV activities, we can now start lead optimization by using focused combinatorial chemical libraries to understand the structure\u2010activities relationship of the two leads and to yield compounds with far superior antiviral activities.",
