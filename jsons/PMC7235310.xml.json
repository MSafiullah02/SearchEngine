Websites were vetted to ascertain that they contained relevant content written in English. The sample was comprised of information from the first 100 websites that met the inclusion criteria resulting from the search. Articles were included if they were written in the English language, contained material relevant to COVID-19, and had a distinct URL leading to an article as opposed to a \u201csplash\u201d or menu page. Articles were excluded if they were derived from a sponsored website.",

Each test measures the same construct, readability, but does so in slightly different ways.6 CLI is based on the average sentence length and an average of the number of letters for every 100 words.6 The GFI assesses the frequency of words that are polysyllabic in conjunction with an average of the length of sentences.6 The SMOG test also assesses the frequency of words that are polysyllabic but does so in a sample of sentences.6 The FKGL and FRE tests both involve determining the mean number of syllables per word and the mean sentence length.6\n",

Only 4 websites were scored as \u201ceasy, <6th grade\u201d (GFI). The mean reading level for nearly all noncommercial and commercial websites was at or above the 10th grade reading level with the exception of commercial URLs scored with the FKGL (9.9; SD 1.7) (Table 2). Only when using the CLI measure was a difference between website type detected with noncommercial scored at the 12.2 grade level versus commercial at 11.5 (P = 0.04). When evaluating noncommercial and commercial websites by easy, average, and difficult readability categories, the SMOG detected a borderline significant difference with 60.4% of noncommercial sites coded as difficult versus 78.7% of commercial (P = 0.048); no differences were detected with the other 4 measures.",

Given that negative emotional states may function as an obstacle to the readability of messages, materials written at higher than recommended levels can further compound the issue. Following the announcement of a crisis, such as the outbreak of a pandemic-type illness, anxiety would be expected to rapidly rise in the general public.7 Anxiety is known as the \u201cfight or flight\u201d syndrome and, as such, is meant to gear the mind and body up for action.8 The body becomes energized to cope with threat, and attention becomes narrowly focused on threat-related information, sometimes to the detriment of accurate interpretation or assimilation of information. Thus, anxiety acts both as a catalyst for information seeking and an obstacle to the ability to read and interpret written messages,9 particularly when prior knowledge of the subject is limited.10 Thus, anxiety fuels the quest for disambiguating information in poorly understood emergency situations, and when none is found or when the message itself is difficult to comprehend, anxiety is likely to rise.11\n",

Furthermore, the limitation to information in English only does not offer insight beyond 1 language.
