To achieve this, the copying mechanism increases the probability of including the words in the source document. A copying mechanism can be seen as an extension of the pointer-network [19] , which only copies words in the input and does not output words other than in the input. Gu et al. [5] , Gulcehre et al. [6] , and Miao et al. [12] extended the pointer-network to copying mechanisms by using a function to balance copying and generation. See et al. [17] and Chen and Lapata [2] applied the copying mechanism to single-document summarization tasks without a query. We came up with an idea of using copying mechanisms to include the overlapping words in the summary. However, the copying mechanisms were originally designed for the settings without the query information, and it is not necessarily clear how we can integrate the mechanisms into a query-biased summarizer.",
