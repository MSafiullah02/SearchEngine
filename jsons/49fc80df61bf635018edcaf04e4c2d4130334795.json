Since being first identified in Wuhan, China [2] , it has rapidly spread around the world, with more than 4,000,000 reported cases to date [3] . SARS-CoV-2 is very similar in structure and infection mechanism to other known coronaviruses, such as the SARS-CoV and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) [4, 5] . The respiratory system is the most commonly affected, but numerous experimental studies and case reports on these viruses have shown their potential neurotropism. According to observational studies, SARS-CoV-2 patients have presented with complaints of headache, nausea, vomiting, myalgia, dizziness [5] , hypogeusia, hyposmia and impaired consciousness [6] , symptoms that suggest involvement of the nervous system.",

The increased expression of ACE2 in the epithelial cells in the lower respiratory tract facilitates viral entry by fusion with the cell membrane [12, 13] . The expression of the ACE2 receptors likely explains the involvement of medullary structures by SARS-CoV-2, but is less likely to be an explanation for the involvement of the temporolimbic structures by the virus. ACE2 is strongly expressed in the ventrolateral medulla and the nucleus of the tractus solitarius, two areas that are closely involved in the regulation of the respiratory cycle [14, 15] (Table 1) . However, the affinity of the virus for the olfactory bulb is likely mediated by a different, yet unidentified mechanism. In rodents, transnasal exposure to SARS-CoV resulted in the rapid detection of the virus in the piriform and infralimbic cortex, basal ganglia and the midbrain, all of which have direct neuronal connections with the olfactory bulb [8] . Once the virus was established in the brain, there was evidence of dissemination along the neurotransmitter pathways, such as the serotonergic dorsal raphe system or hematogenously through the Virchow-Robin spaces. Prior studies have shown that both SARS-CoV and MERS [10] directly induced neuronal death in the respiratory center in the medulla through an upregulation of IL-1, IL-6 and TNF alpha cytokine response, possibly through either an inflammatory response or autophagy [8, 16] . However, these observations were conducted with SARS, and further studies will be needed to determine whether they are also applicable to the novel SARS-CoV-2 virus.",

In an observational study of 41 patients with COVID-19, headache was found in 8% of patients and myalgia was found in 12 % [17] . In most of these cases, headaches appeared to be a non-specific symptom, without features suggestive of meningeal irritation. The occurrence of isolated headaches in the absence of other neurological-type symptoms suggests the mechanism was more likely due to the systemic illness rather than a primary invasion of the CNS by the virus. An observational report of 138 patients with COVID-19 showed that fatigue was present in 69.6 % of patients, myalgia was reported in 34.8 % and headache in 6.5 % on admission [5] . Similarly, an observational study of 99 patients with COVID-19 showed confusion in 9% of patients and headache in 8% of patients [18] . In another observational study in Wuhan, headaches were reported by 34 % of COVID-19 positive patients [19] (Table 2 ).",

Another observational study showed that 4 out of 21 specimens from a white matter plaque, normal-appearing white matter, gray matter and cervical cord tissue of MS patients tested for HCV-229E nucleic acid, consistently gave positive results while none of the 11 control brain specimens did so. A similar study reported the detection of murine like coronaviruses in 12 of 22 MS brains [26] . This association is also supported by the observation of coronavirus-like particles in the perivascular cuffing of an MS plaque intrathecal synthesis of antibodies to HCV-229E and HCV-OC43 in a proportion of MS patients, in addition to the isolation of HCV from MS patients' brains [27] .",

Data showed that patients with severe systemic presentation and cardiovascular risk factors were more likely to have acute cerebrovascular diseases [6] . In a retrospective study, 4 elderly patients with multiple cardiovascular risk factors diagnosed with COVID-19 developed stroke. Large vessel disease was documented as the mechanism of vascular damage in all of them [54] . Similarly, 5 cases of stroke in the context of COVID-19 were reported more recently. Three of these younger patients, had vascular risk factors including diabetes, dyslipidemia and hypertension. Evidence of occlusion of large vessels, treated with endovascular therapy was documented in all of them.",

There is ample evidence that the severity of COVID-19 infection in humans is directly related to the presence of cardiovascular co-morbidities, such as hypertension (HTN), diabetes mellitus (DM) and elderly status predisposing to large vessel disease [55] . A recent metaanalysis of 8 studies from China, including 46,248 infected patients, showed the most prevalent comorbidities were HTN (17 %) and DM (8%), followed by cardiovascular diseases (5%) [57, 58] . In those few reported cases, of patients without vascular risk factors, the SARS-CoV-2 induced hypercoagulability may be the most important mechanism of the cerebrovascular disease [54, 56] .",

In an observational study of 138 hospitalized patients with COVID-19, shock was observed in 8.7 % of infected patients, acute cardiac injury was present in 7.2 %, and arrhythmia in 16.7 % [5] . Recently, another observational study of 191 patients in China showed that 23 % were complicated with heart failure, 20 % with septic shock, 19 % with coagulopathy, and 17 % with acute cardiac injury [58] . All of which are factors potentially predisposing patients to stroke [60] . The presence of specific viral factors directly causing hypercoagulability, arteritis, and endothelial dysfunction, which can lead to ischemic stroke or brain bleeding, need to be clarified in further research.",

Despite its most characteristic symptom of respiratory distress, patients with COVID-19 have also shown neurologic manifestations. An increasing number of reports of COVID-19 patients with neurological issues, in addition to emergent experimental models evidencing neuroinvasion, brings a reasonable concern of SARS-CoV-2 being a new neuropathogenic that remains underdiagnosed. How it may cause acute and chronic neurologic issues and whether possible targeting of the medullary cardiorespiratory center is contributing to the poor outcomes observed remains unclear. Exploring the neurologic manifestations of COVID-19 is a step towards better understanding the virus, preventing further spread and treating patients affected by this pandemic.",
