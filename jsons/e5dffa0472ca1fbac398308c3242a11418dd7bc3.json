Even if microbiology is positive, they still remain unclassified according to 2008-EORTC/MSG. Quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) provides new mycological documentation of IA. This retrospective study assessed Aspergillus fumigatus real time qPCR (MycoGENIE R ) in BAL to diagnose IA and identify azole-resistant strains. Clinical, radiological, and microbiological data from 114 hematology patients (69% HSCT recipients; 29% on mould active agents) from years 2012-2017 were collected; and 123 BAL samples were tested with qPCR (cutoff: Ct < 40) and galactomannan (GM, Platelia R , cutoff: 0.5 ODI). Patients were classified as proven/probable, possible, and no-IA. \"Atypical-IA\" referred to patients with lesions other than typical according to 2008-EORTC/MSG and positive mycology. Proven IA was diagnosed in two cases (1.6%), probable in 28 (22.8%), possible in 27 (22%), atypical in 14 (11.4%). qPCR was positive in 39 samples (31.7%). Sensitivity and specificity of qPCR for proven/probable IA (vs no-IA; atypical-IA excluded) were 40% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 23-59) and 69% (95%CI: 55-81), respectively. Sensitivity of qPCR was higher when combined with GM (83%, 95%CI: 65-94) and in those receiving mould-active agents at BAL (61%, 95%CI: 32-86). One sample had TR34/L98H mutation. In conclusion, in high-risk hematology patients with various lung lesions, A. fumigatus qPCR in BAL contributes to diagnosing IA, particularly if combined with GM and in patients receiving mould-active agents might allow detecting azole-resistant mutations in culture negative samples.

[1] [2] [3] IA in this setting is associated with high morbidity and mortality, particularly when not promptly diagnosed and treated. 4 Unfortunately, the diagnosis of IA in hematology patients is challenging because of nonspecific clinical manifestations, low yield of fungal cultures, and difficulty in performing invasive diagnostic procedures due to thrombocytopenia or poor general conditions. In addition, azole resistant A. fumigatus strains have been increasingly frequent in several geographical regions, and given low rate of positive cultures, these cases risk to remain undetected, compromising the outcome of IA. 5 Diagnostic criteria for IFD in the immunocompromised patients have been developed by EORTC/MSG in 2002 and subsequently revised in 2008. 6 They established three levels of certainty of diagnosis: proven, probable, and possible. In particular, for probable IA, a combination of a host factor (presence of a predisposing condition) plus a clinical criterion plus a mycological criterion are required. Clinical criteria in cases of pulmonary IA include one of the following typical radiological lesions in lung computed tomography (CT) scan: (1) dense, well-circumscribed lesions(s) with or without a halo sign, (2) air-crescent sign, or (3) cavity. Mycological criteria for pulmonary aspergillosis are detection of galactomannan (GM) in serum or bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BAL) or direct tests positive in sputum or BAL. 6 Possible IA is diagnosed in the presence of host and clinical criteria but in the absence of mycological documentation.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 282, "end": 285, "text": "[1]", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}, {"start": 286, "end": 289, "text": "[2]", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}, {"start": 290, "end": 293, "text": "[3]", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 416, "end": 417, "text": "4", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 908, "end": 909, "text": "5", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 1047, "end": 1048, "text": "6", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}, {"start": 1732, "end": 1733, "text": "6", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Introduction"}, {"text": "Although these criteria revolutionized the clinical research and epidemiological studies in IA, they do not cover numerous possible clinical situations. 7 Among them, the most frequent is the presence of host criteria with positive mycological criteria and lung lesions, which are different from the aforementioned typical ones.

Moreover, 12% of them had lung lesions atypical according to EORTC/MSG criteria and positive mycological results. These patients are \"unclassified\" according to EORTC, and they are usually considered as having IA and treated. 8 Therefore, they could not be included as controls for the assessment of diagnostic performance. However, even patients included in the control group (with non-typical lesions and negative mycology), belonged to a high risk population, and the positivity of PCR cannot be easily interpreted as false positive results. Indeed, 50% of patients in this group with a positive PCR did receive empirically mould active agents, so only in remaining 50% of them, positive PCR could be confidently considered as false positive results or colonisation. Moreover, even the presence of an alternative diagnosis should not serve a criterion for the absence of IA, since fungal and bacterial or viral co-infections are frequent in this setting. 15 Good diagnostic performances have reported in metaanalyses, which included mainly studies of in-house methods, with sensitivity and specificity reported of >75% and >93%, respectively. 16 However, in some recent studies, the sensitivity was markedly lower (approximately 30%). 11, 17 The commercial assays allow standardization, high reproducibility and have a validated quality control. However, they do not contain a control of DNA extraction, which may differ for hyphae and for free DNA, and quality control for the BAL itself. Additionally, their performance depends on the assay used and the clinical setting. The low value obtained in our study is not comparable with most of the performances described to date in the literature using MycoGenie R . However, most other studies included patients with high rate of culture-positive respiratory samples. Indeed, the sensitivity was 92.9% in a cohort with 59 of 88 respiratory samples positive in culture for Aspergillus, 14 71% in 31 cases of probable IA with 45% of positive BAL culture rate, 18 and 77.4% in case of fungal rhinosinusitis in which a high concentration of fungus DNA is present. 19 Also a recent study comparing various diagnostic methods, which reported the sensitivity of MycoGenie R of 73.7% in 38 patients with proven/probable IA, had a very high (22/38, 58%) rate of positivity of culture for Aspergillus. 12 In addition, in that cohort, the sensitivity was lower in 41 hematological patients than in those from intensive care unit (ICU) suggesting a lower fungal burden sufficient to cause IFD in highly immunocompromised hosts. 12 Indeed, also the low yield of fungal cultures and rather low median BAL GM ODI confirm the low burden of viable moulds in this study. Therefore, the performance of MycoGenie R in a cohort of with low fungal burden remains to be established.

[21] [22] [23] Also in our study, the rate of qPCR positivity in GM positive BAL samples was higher form patients receiving mould active drugs compared to those not treated.

Although in case of fungi other than Aspergillus co-infection might be present, it is unlikely based on negative BAL GM. On the contrary, cases of cross-reactivity of the method with strains of A. flavus have already been described in the literature, 23 and such a false positive result might be particularly likely in case of high fungal burden, as demonstrated in our two cases. From the clinical point of view, a qPCR should detect all species of Aspergilllus, since species other than A. fumigatus might be more prevalent, particularity in some geographical zones, for example, A. flavus in Mediterranean. 24 Although triazole-resistant strains of A. fumigatus are increasing in several geographical regions, fortunately in our cohort only one patient had the TR34/L98H mutation, accounting for 2.6% rate among PCR positive samples. Such a low incidence is in line with what reported for Italy; 25 however, it should be considered with caution given overall poor sensitivity of this qPCR assay. Although molecular methods are important tools, in addition to culture, to monitor the changes in resistance patters, also in this case, detection of more than one resistance mutation might be useful.
