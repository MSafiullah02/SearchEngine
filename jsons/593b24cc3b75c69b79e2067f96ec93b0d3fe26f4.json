            "text": "The global pandemic of the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 represents one of the greatest infectious challenges to human health in recent history [1] . At the current time over 2.5 million people have been infected and this has proved fatal in over 175,000 cases. Patients who are immune suppressed, from underlying disease or iatrogenic intervention, are believed to be at increased risk of severe clinical outcome and this is undergoing careful monitoring [2] . B cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia/small lymphocytic lymphoma (CLL/SLL) is the most common lymphoid malignancy in many countries and is seen primarily in older people. CLL is associated with significant immune suppression and patients show impaired humoral and cellular immune responses to infectious challenge and vaccination [3] . The clinical complications of SARS-CoV-2 infection are complex and their pathophysiology is uncertain. It currently unclear if patients with severe outcomes develop inadequate virus-specific immune responses or if immunopathology from exaggerated adaptive immunity may contribute to symptoms. As such, the clinical impact of infection on patients with CLL is currently unclear and may relate to stage of disease management [4] . It is likely that patients who undergo immuno-chemotherapy as part of disease management will be at increased risk of clinical complications following SARS-CoV-2 infection. In contrast, Bruton tyrosine kinase inhibitors, such as ibrutinib and acalabrutinib, may actually have some protective effect and this is being explored in clinical studies [5] . However, most patients who receive a diagnosis of CLL do not receive treatment until disease progression. This \"watch and wait\" policy means that very large numbers of patients live with untreated CLL and generally it is regarded that their risk from infection is lower than those who have undergone therapeutic intervention, although still higher than age-matched controls. As such, the clinical outcome of SARS-CoV-2 infection in patients with therapy-naive CLL is an area of considerable importance. In this report we document four patients with untreated CLL who contracted SARS-CoV-2 infection confirmed by PCR on throat swab at admission. Their clinical course was severe with a high rate of mortality. In addition, an increase in the lymphocyte count, a phenomenon we term 'Covid-Induced Lymphocytosis', was observed in all cases with an average three-fold increase during Covid disease. These findings suggest that SARS-CoV-2 infection in patients with therapy-naive CLL may be associated with considerably greater clinical risk than seen in the general population and argue for strict enforcement of quarantine conditions.",

            "text": "There is currently considerable concern regarding the potential impact of SARS-CoV-2 infection in patients with malignant disease. In this report we discuss the clinical outcomes in four patients with untreated CLL following infection with the novel coronavirus. A striking feature was the clinical severity of infection with fatal outcome in three patients and severe disease in the fourth. At this time it is not possible to say that this definitively represents a more severe outcome than would be expected for patients within this age group. Three patients were aged over 75 years of age where the case fatality ratio from Covid-19 exceeds 8% [6] . In addition, these patients had some form of underlying health disorder including diabetes, hypertension or heart disease. Nevertheless, we were somewhat surprised to identify four patients with severe COVID-19 infection in this first wave of disease. Approximately 200 therapy-na\u00efve CLL patients are seen locally and therefore this represents a case fatality of 1.5% to date. However, given that less than 5% of the UK population is believed to have become infected with the virus to date, these findings could represent a high degree of disease severity within CLL patients that do become infected. This will need to be examined in the large epidemiological studies which are now underway. A second novel finding was the development of increased lymphocytosis in all patients at the time of acute SARS-CoV-2 infection. This is particularly surprising given that lymphopenia is an established correlate of severe and fatal Covid-19 disease in the general population [6] [7] [8] . Indeed, the average peak lymphocytosis in all 4 patients was 3-fold higher during SARS-CoV-2 compared to the most recent outpatient appointment (Figure 2 ). This was particularly marked in patient 1 who displayed a 5-fold increase in the peripheral lymphocyte count and flow cytometry revealed that over 90% of these cells were from the original CLL tumour. This 'Covid-induced lymphocytosis (CIL)' is similar to that observed in patients who are treated with Prednisolone or inhibitors of Bruton tyrosine kinase although it was noteworthy that the CIL effect resolved within a few days. These drugs are believed to release CLL tumours cells from the bone marrow and secondary lymphoid tissue into the systemic circulation. At this stage the mechanism that underlies Covid-induced lymphocytosis is unclear. It may result from very high levels of endogenous steroids during intense inflammation, but additional mechanisms may be in operation and deserve further investigation. Clinically, it is important to recognise that this is a feature of acute SARS-CoV-2 infection in patients with CLL and that the lymphocytosis can resolve quickly. It is noteworthy that the severe outcomes observed were all in patients with untreated CLL, a group which typically is believed to be at somewhat lower risk of infectious complications compared to those with more advanced disease. However, it is well established that therapyna\u00efve patients do still have considerably increased infection risk compared to the general population [9] . Given the potential importance of immunopathological complications in severe COVID-19 disease it may be speculated that the relative residual immune-competence in untreated patients may place them at higher risk of severe disease, potentially even more so than those who are taking B cell receptor-targeting drugs. Patients on \"watch and wait\" management represent a large percentage of CLL patients and these observations suggest that these groups should be very carefully monitored during the ongoing SARS-CoV-2 pandemic and encouraged to continue self-isolating to limit exposure to viral infection.",
