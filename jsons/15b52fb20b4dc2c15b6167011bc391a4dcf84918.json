A total of 28 children (\u2264 15 years old) were admitted to our facility for fever and hypoxia (pulse oxygen saturation <93% in room air) between September 16, 2009, and November 30, 2009 . All 28 patients were suspected of having S-OIV infection and had already been diagnosed as having pneumonia based on initial radiography or clinical symptoms. We performed CT examinations in all 28 patients for two reasons: First, the fi rst patient who was admitted in our facility as having S-OIV pneumonia presented with severe respiratory failure and needed mechanical ventilation. Therefore, we performed chest CT in all patients for close evaluation of pneumonia and to detect pneumonia at an early stage, which is diffi cult to detect by radiography. Second, because the common clinical courses of S-OIV in children and the factors of aggravation were unknown in the autumn of 2009, an unknown clinical course for this patient cohort became a concern.",

Several patients received corticosteroids for asthmatic symptoms. The average hospitalization time was 6.4 days (range 4-9 days), and all patients recuperated from S-OIV infection without sequela. One patient presented with status epilepticus on admission, but none of the patients showed evidence of infl uenza encephalopathy. Imaging fi ndings are summarized in Table 2 . Eleven cases (69%) showed consolidation plus GGO (Fig. 1 ); of these, 10 cases (63%) were consolidation-dominant and only one case (6%) was GGO-dominant. Consolidation only was found in 3 of 16 cases (19%). In addition to these fi ndings, segmental or lobar consolidation was found in seven patients (44%). Of these seven patients, fi ve (31%) had widespread consolidation with volume loss (as evidenced by atelectasis) (Fig. 2) , and two (13%) had widespread consolidation without volume loss (Fig.  3) . Abnormal opacities were predominantly found in the central zone of the lung (8/16, 50%), especially in the peribronchovascular area; fewer patients had abnormalities in the peripheral zone (3/16, 19%) . The remaining patients (5/16, 31%) had no tendency in distribution. Lung abnormalities were unilateral in 6 of the 16 patients (38%) and bilateral in 10 patients (63%). With respect to the extent of opacities, abnormal fi ndings were multifocal in 15 of the 16 patients (94%) and focal in 1 patient Lobar consolidation of the right middle lobe with volume loss was observed (partial atelectasis). Abnormal opacities were observed only in the right lung; the left lung was intact apart from bronchial wall thickening. Motion artifacts are present on CT BVBT was observed in 9 of the 12 patients (75%) in whom interpretation was possible. The number of lobes affected by abnormal parenchymal opacities is shown in Table 3 . The mean number of affected lobes was 2.6 (range 1-4). Right lobes were predominantly affected (26 right lobes vs. 16 left lobes). One patient had negative chest radiography but positive CT fi ndings.",

            "text": "In the present study, the predominant pattern of abnormality was multifocal consolidation regardless of the presence of GGO. These abnormal opacities were primarily distributed in the central lung zone. Although to the best of our knowledge eight studies on CT fi ndings in S-OIV infection have been published, there are only two consecutive-patients studies on CT fi ndings in children with S-OIV. [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] In particular, Mori et al. 11 and Zhao et al. 12 Infl uenza viruses are divided into three types (A, B, C), based on internal-membrane and nucleoprotein antigens. Of the three, types A and B infl uenza viruses can cause viral pneumonia. 15, 16 The CT features of pneumonia caused by seasonal infl uenza include centrilobular nodules, representing alveolar hemorrhage, and GGO or consolidation with lobular distribution predominantly in the central lung zone. 15, 17 There were few cases of centrilobular nodules in either of the previous studies on S-OIV infection or in the present study. GGO is frequently observed with viral pneumonia caused by seasonal infl uenza, whereas there were few GGO-dominant cases in the present study. 17 Additionally, widespread consolidations (segmental or lobar) were observed in 7 of 16 cases in the present study. These fi ndings are uncommon in seasonal infl uenza; rather, they resemble the radiological features of avian H5N1 infl uenza infection in which segmental consolidation in chest CT was reported by Qureshi et al. 18 In addition, it was reported that S-OIV shows increased ex vivo replication in human bronchial epithelium and lung tissues as well as increased replication and pathological changes in the lung of nonhuman primates. 3, 19 Therefore, we suggest that widespread consolidations are related to the high pathogenicity of S-OIV, although the possibility of bacterial superinfection cannot be ruled out.",

The existence of pneumomediastinum may be considered indirect evidence of hyperinfl ation, suggesting severe infl ammation of the small airways or bronchioles. Bronchovascular bundle thickening was observed in three-fourths of patients in whom interpretation was possible. This fi nding is compatible with the study by Lee et al., who reported prominent peribronchial markings as important fi ndings on chest radiography of children with S-OIV. 14 Although the interpretation of BVBT was difficult in four cases because of motion artifacts, BVBT was one of the common fi ndings in the present study.",

Because our institution does not have a neonatal or a pediatric intensive care unit, treatment of severely ill patients, such as those needing percutaneous cardiopulmonary support, is diffi cult. Second, there was the possibility of bacterial co-infection. Another study demonstrated bacterial coinfection by bronchoalveolar lavage. 5 However, because the current study population comprised children, an invasive examination was avoided. According to reports by Flood et al. 28 and Ruuskanen et al., 29 bacterial pneumonia is suggested when the C-reactive protein (CRP) level is >40 mg/l 28 or >60 mg/l 29 or the white blood cell count (WBC) is >15 000/ml, 29 respectively. In the present study, the peak CRP level was 31 mg/l, and the WBC was 10 500/ml. That is why we thought that pneumonia in our patients might be induced by the S-OIV alone. Nevertheless, because antibiotics were administered empirically to all patients, the possibility of bacterial co-infection cannot completely be excluded. Third, because the study population consisted of children, several patients could not hold their breath and were moving during the CT examinations. Therefore, motion artifacts made it diffi cult to evaluate minute fi ndings such as BVBT and mediastinal lymphadenopathy. Finally, no information on the relation between CT and histopathology could be obtained because none of the patients underwent lung biopsy or autopsy.",
