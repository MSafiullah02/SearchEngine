Consequently, the body\u2019s respiratory mucosal surfaces contain a complex array of immune regulatory mechanisms that ensures, at least in healthy individuals, a quiescent and non\u2010inflammatory environment that maintains optimal tissue function (1, 2, 3). However, once a pathogen establishes an infection or the regulatory mechanisms fail, a rapid cascade of event leads to the production of inflammatory cytokines that recruit immune cells in an attempt to eradicate the ensuing pathogen/antigenic stimuli while minimizing the impact on physiological function of the tissue. However, this ideal conclusion often does not occur, as many human pathogens have evolved virulence and immune modulatory mechanisms that circumvent and disrupt mucosal immune responses resulting in tissue pathology, clinical disease, and possible long\u2010term sequelae.",

Yet, despite the continued success and widespread use of respiratory pathogen vaccines, Mycobacterium tuberculosis (TB) and a multitude of respiratory viral infections continue to cause significant morbidity and result in millions of futile deaths each year (7, 8, 9) [World Health Organization (WHO) 2004 Global Burden of Disease]. Influenza virus alone causes seasonal epidemics that can affect 10\u201320% of the global population (10). Recent estimates suggest that seasonal influenza viral infections are responsible for 250,000\u2013500,000 deaths annually, which can increase during pandemics caused by the emergence of a novel reassortment viral strain (WHO 2004 Global Burden of Disease). Furthermore, the increasing number of deaths attributed to human transmission of highly pathogenic avian influenza strains (H5N1) will elevate influenza virus associated morbidity and mortality (11). In addition to influenza virus, parainfluenza virus, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), meta\u2010pneumonia virus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS\u2010CoV), rhinovirus, measles, and adenovirus are endemic within the human population and can establish acute respiratory tract infection (11, 12, 13, 14). With a few exceptions, existing approaches have failed to develop effective vaccines against these viral pathogens. Ominously, the public health impact of respiratory infections is likely to increase in the near future due to aging global populations, increasing antibiotic resistance (in the case of TB and pneumococcus) and altering social attitudes toward vaccination (14, 15, 16). Moreover, the continuing emergence of novel respiratory viruses (through antigenic recombination events and zoonosis), such as the 2009 H1N1 influenza A virus strain, highly pathogenic avian influenza viruses, SARS coronavirus and human cases of monkeypox (11, 17, 18), taken together with the continued concern of bioterrorism (anthrax and smallpox) (19, 20) adds to the urgent need to better understand the pathogenesis of respiratory viruses and mechanisms of protection.",

The argument will be made that applying this knowledge will be critical in future success of CD8+ T\u2010cell vaccines.

            "text": "Most if not all of today\u2019s licensed vaccines work by promoting a robust and long\u2010lived immunoglobulin response that prevents initial pathogen infection and ensuing replication, resulting in pathogen clearance before the onset of any clinical symptoms. Apparently, this straightforward approach of safely generating neutralizing immunoglobulin via the injection of killed, subunit, or highly attenuated agents has resulted in many successful vaccines that confer life\u2010long protective immunity (6). However, in the context of highly pathogenic or rapidly mutating viruses that target mucosal surfaces such as the respiratory tract, this approach has proven far less successful (6, 21). The limitations of generating solely immunoglobulin\u2010mediated protection are highlighted by the necessity to annually develop a seasonal influenza vaccine. The protective mechanism of current subunit or inactivated influenza vaccines is through the generation of neutralizing immunoglobulins against hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA), two integral membrane viral proteins essential for infectivity. Although immunoglobulins against these surface proteins are long\u2010lived, their functional relevance diminishes rapidly due to antigenic drift in both the HA and NA surface glycoproteins (22, 23). This continual antigen drift or evolution also explains, in part, the difficulty in developing an effective vaccine against other intracellular pathogens, such as human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and malaria (6). Both of these pathogens continually mutate, in the case of HIV, or alter, in the case of the plasmodium parasite, key surface antigens resulting in immunological escape from any induced\u2010specific immunoglobulin response. This continued dilemma has led to the general acceptance that to develop effective vaccines against these types of intracellular pathogens, a combination of immunoglobulin and a long\u2010lasting memory CD8+ T\u2010cell response must be generated (24, 25, 26). This approach has the added benefit of producing cross\u2010protective immunity mediated by CD8+ T cells that recognize conserved internal components of the specific pathogens, therefore conferring heterosubtypic immunity (27). This would be an ideal strategy in the context of a virus that rapidly mutated its external antigens while maintaining more conserved internal antigens. Strictly speaking, CD8+ T cells cannot afford protection against infection per se, but can mediate faster viral clearance and provide a substantial degree of protection against challenge with a lethal dose of virus (14). Toward this end, the scientific community has focused enormous efforts on the development of prophylactic and therapeutic vaccines that can promote CD8+ T\u2010cell responses with the assumption that such a strategy will enhance immunological protection through providing additional support to existing antiviral immunoglobulin response. To date, however, the development of effective T\u2010cell vaccines against many respiratory viruses remains elusive. In the past 10 years, immunologists have provided vaccinologists with valuable information on the regulatory mechanisms that govern not only the efficient generation of CD8+ T\u2010cell responses in the lung but also how different memory CD8+ T\u2010cell subsets are maintained over time. The current challenge is to apply this knowledge in our endeavors to develop safe and effective CD8+ T\u2010cell vaccines.",

Consequently, the respiratory epithelium contains an array of virus detection systems, such as Toll\u2010like receptors (TLRs), Nod\u2010like receptors (NLRs), and the cytosolic RNA helicase family members, retinoic acid\u2010inducible gene I (RIG I) and melanoma differentiation associated gene 5 (MDA5), that act in concert to rapidly detect the presence of an invading virus (14, 28, 29). Upon viral recognition, a complex interplay between these distinct detection systems results in the activation of an array of transcription factors that culminates in the production of antiviral cytokines and inflammatory mediators (14, 28). In addition to establishing a localized inflammatory environment and recruiting innate effector cells, this initial antiviral inflammatory program is important for the activation and differentiation of lung\u2010resident antigen\u2010presenting cells (APCs), namely dendritic cells (DCs) and macrophages (30).",

            "text": "Much of our current understanding of CD8+ T\u2010cell immunity stems from studying small rodent influenza and parainfluenza infection models (14, 31, 32). These models have shown the crucial role CD8+ T cells play in controlling viral titers during primary infection and generating protection against subsequent infection. \nFig. 1\n depicts the events occurring in the lung parenchyma, airways, and draining lymph nodes (LNs) during the initial stages of a sublethal intranasal infection with influenza virus. Within a couple of days after infection, viral titers in the lung increase rapidly culminating in acute weight loss and cachexia. Subsequently, antigen\u2010loaded or infected respiratory DCs migrate to the mediastinal LNs (MLNS) within 6 h, reaching maximal numbers by 18 h postinfection (33). Intravital LN microscopy studies suggest that antigen\u2010bearing DCs migrate to and localize in the vicinity of the high\u2010endothelial venules (HEVs) (34, 35, 36, 37). This HEV localization event facilitates the DC interaction with naive antigen\u2010specific T cells entering the LN from peripheral circulation. The relatively rare antigen\u2010specific T cells are subsequently selected through T\u2010cell receptor (TCR)/major histocompatibility complex class I (MHC I) engagement and undergo 11\u201315 rounds of clonal expansion, resulting in a large population of antigen\u2010specific effector CD8+ T cells observed during the peak of the primary response (14, 38). During this expansion phase, CD8+ T cells simultaneously differentiate into functionally distinct effector populations based on their cytokine secretion profiles. These include T cytotoxic 1 (TC1), TC2, and TC17 cell populations, which correspond to the better described CD4+ T\u2010helper 1 (Th1), Th2, and Th17 cell populations. Homeostatic CD8+ T\u2010cell clone frequency, specific antigenic peptide abundance, and presentation kinetics can collectively influence the development and relative frequency of dominant and subdominant CD8+ T\u2010cell populations (39).",

The migration of CD8+ T cells to the lung tissue and airways does not appear to be dependent on antigen, although infiltrating CD8+ T cells must acquire a sufficient level of activation to downregulate LN homing receptors and acquire lung\u2010homing chemokine receptors (40). Following their arrival in the lung, protective virus\u2010specific CD8+ T\u2010cell responses require additional antigen\u2010dependent interactions with respiratory DCs (30, 41, 42, 43). Respiratory DCs critically contribute to the sustained survival of virus\u2010specific effector CD8+ T cells by trans\u2010presentation of interleukin\u201015 (IL\u201015) (30, 41, 42, 43). Recent data also suggest that IL\u201015 mediates the migration of effector CD8+ T cells to the lung airways (44). Together, these data support a two\u2010hit model for promoting effective CD8+ T\u2010cell responses: a first hit in the lymph node that primes T\u2010cell proliferation and migration to the site of infection, and a second hit that provides a survival signal to the effector T cell (42). The influx of virus\u2010specific CD8+ T cells into the respiratory tract coincides with decreasing viral titers, recovery of body mass and ultimately viral clearance by day eight to 10 postinfection. After viral clearance the majority of virus\u2010specific effector CD8+ T cells die through apoptosis, while a small population of surviving effector CD8+ T cells persist and seed a long\u2010lived memory pool (14). A cardinal feature of memory T cells is their ability to mediate faster, stronger, and more effective responses to secondary virus challenge than naive T cells. In the case of CD8+ T cells, increased numbers, higher activation status, more rapid induction of effector functions, and altered homing patterns contribute to their enhanced recall responses (14, 32).",

            "text": "In recent years, accumulating data has highlighted that memory CD8+ T cells are extremely heterogeneous in terms of their phenotype, function, and anatomical distribution (32, 45). Two major subtypes of memory CD8+ T cells have been defined based on the expression of CD62L (also known as l\u2010selectin), a \u2018homing receptor\u2019 for leukocytes to enter secondary lymphoid tissues via HEVs, and CCR7, a chemokine receptor that supports trafficking through secondary lymphoid tissue (46) (\nFig. 2\n). Central memory T cells (TCM) are CD62Lhi/CCR7hi cells that tend to localize in secondary lymphoid tissues, whereas effector memory T cells (TEM) are CD62Llo/CCR7lo cells that localize or traffic through peripheral tissues such as the lung. Considerable interest has been focused on elucidating functional differences between these memory T\u2010cell subsets and their capacity to confer protection against secondary infection (24, 32, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52). After secondary encounter with antigen, TEM cells can be stimulated by respiratory DCs without the requirement for further division and can demonstrate rapid cytokine production and lytic activity. In contrast, resting TCM cells that reside in the LNs require migratory DCs for their reactivation, resulting in de novo proliferation and a \u2018new\u2019 wave of secondary effector T cells that migrate to the lung parenchyma and airways. Based on these observations, it has been proposed that TEM cells participate directly in the initiation of protective memory responses by rapidly producing effector molecules (perforin, granzyme and antiviral cytokines) at the site of antigen encounter, while TCM cells contribute to the maintenance and/or amplification of the overall secondary T\u2010cell response. Therefore, the specific subset of memory CD8+ T cells generated by vaccination may critically determine the ultimate effectiveness of vaccine induced\u2010immune protection against a natural respiratory viral infection.",

Similarly, in animal models of influenza and Sendai virus infection the efficacy of protection against secondary challenge wanes rapidly within 3\u20136 months after a primary infection (60, 61, 62). This decline in protective T\u2010cell immunity occurs despite the fact that the number of virus\u2010specific memory CD8+ T cells in the lymphoid tissues (TCM cells) remains relatively high for the life span of animal (61, 62). These studies suggest that in the context of a respiratory viral infection, TCM cells may not respond, expand, or relocate (to the lung) sufficiently quickly to provide immediate protection against disease caused by reinfection (or live\u2010pathogen challenge postvaccination).",

Interestingly, this decline and stabilization in the number of memory CD8+ T cells in the lung directly correlates with a progressive decline in T cell\u2010mediated protection from a secondary challenge. Thus, developing strategies that elicit a sufficiently large number of long\u2010lived TEM cells that are not only cytolytic but also polyfunctional (defined as being able to produce high levels of antiviral cytokines IFN\u2010\u03b3, TNF, and IL\u20102) represents a key challenge for next generation vaccines that are able to confer protection against respiratory viruses. In this regard, it is becoming increasingly evident that the strength and duration of antigenic stimulation play important roles in determining both the frequency and long\u2010term persistence of TEM cells.

This phenomenon has been well studied in a number of infectious mouse models including influenza virus where between five and 10% of the CD8+ T\u2010cells elicited during the peak of immune response transition into memory T cells (63). The primary determinant of effector CD8+ T\u2010cell size appears to be a function of the initial amount of antigen present during T\u2010cell priming. It has been shown that brief periods of antigenic stimulation or antigen availability during priming favor the enrichment of TCM cells, whereas prolonged periods support TEM cell generation (\nFig. 2\n) (24, 46). This has important implications for vaccine development against respiratory viruses; for example, the level and time of antigen exposure that can be provided by attenuated vaccines, non\u2010replicating vectors, DNA vaccines, or protein subunit vaccines might be significantly less than those provided by live\u2010replicating vaccines. This is likely to be linked to the capacity of replicating vaccines to divide multiple times and disseminate faster, thus increasing the amount and the duration of antigen exposure. As will be discussed in more detail below, one of the key questions in inducing large effector\u2010cell burst size for new vaccines will be to define the precise mechanisms that regulate the formation of effector T cells in the context of high or persisting antigen load.",

Initial data from mouse models suggested that T\u2010cell memory was short lived in the absence of periodic exposure to antigen (64). However, more recent evidence has challenged this idea and suggested that the number of TCM cells can be sustained in the absence of both specific antigen and MHC molecules (65, 66, 67). Further experimental evidence now suggests that a TCM memory pool is maintained, at least in part, through periodic slow cell division and continuous replacement of cells, a process commonly referred to as homeostatic proliferation (68, 69). This turnover of a memory TCM pool is achieved through tonic stimulation by cytokines, such as IL\u20107, and IL\u201015.

Initial studies suggested that TEM cell populations in the lung airways are maintained in an antigen\u2010independent manner by continual recruitment of new cells from the circulation (40, 70). The rate of memory cell recruitment was shown to be extremely rapid, resulting in replacement of 90% of the population every 10 days and that this can be maintained for periods over 1 year following viral clearance (70). More recent studies extended these observations by demonstrating that antigen can persist in the lung draining LNs for several weeks after influenza virus clearance and that this residual antigen contributes to the maintenance of TEM cells in the lung airways (71, 72). However, a small number of circulating memory CD8+ T\u2010cells generated after influenza virus infection can migrate to the airways in the absence of cognate antigen (73). Therefore, memory T\u2010cell recruitment to the lung airways is controlled by both antigen\u2010independent and antigen\u2010dependent mechanisms immediately following virus clearance. As residual antigen is cleared and the number of memory CD8+ T\u2010cells localized within the lung airways stabilizes at a low level, antigen\u2010independent processes are required to maintain this population over time (73). Thus, it is clear that the role of persisting antigen after vaccination is a crucial point that has to be addressed during an effective T\u2010cell vaccine design against respiratory viruses. This evidence clearly demonstrates that the use of conventional non\u2010replicating attenuated vaccine strains will fail to induce a robust and long\u2010lived TEM population and therefore have limited application in the design of future vaccines. This explains the need to increase the vaccine dose and/or number of booster immunizations when highly attenuated viral vaccines are utilized. However, these approaches have obvious logistical and economic limitations. Thus, to fully realize the potential benefits of attenuated vaccines or simple protein/peptide immunizations it will be of great interest to identify specific molecules and/or pathways that can be targeted to safely lower the activation threshold for antigen.",

(77) demonstrated that generation, maintenance, and function of memory CD8+ T cells after respiratory influenza infection is independent of IL\u201015\u2010mediated survival signals. In contrast, systemically (i.v)\u2010induced memory T cells were dependent on IL\u201015 for their long\u2010term survival. Thus, CD8+ T\u2010cells primed at a mucosal site require distinct signals for their long\u2010term maintenance. Shiki Takamura et al. (78) extended these results by showing that intranasally primed memory CD8+ T cells possess a unique ability to be reactivated by residual antigen in the MLN compared with intraperitoneally primed CD8+ T cells, resulting in the preferential recruitment and maintenance of intranasally primed memory CD8+ T cells in the lung airways. Furthermore, they demonstrated that the inability of intraperitoneally primed memory CD8+ T cells to access residual antigen could be corrected by a subsequent intranasal virus infection (78). Thus, initial CD8+ T\u2010cell priming in the MLN and prolonged presentation of residual antigen in the MLN are required to maintain large numbers of virus\u2010specific memory CD8+ T cells in the lung airways (78). Clearly, these findings have to be considered for the rational design of CD8+ T\u2010cell vaccines against respiratory pathogens.",

They are also unique in that they encode their own transcription machinery enabling poxviruses to replicate in the cytoplasm of an infected cell (82, 83). The concept of utilizing live\u2010attenuated poxviruses as an immunizing agent against respiratory viruses can be traced back to the global\u2010smallpox eradication program (82, 83). The strategy for this program involved mass vaccination with VACV, an antigenically similar virus to Variola major, the etiological agent of smallpox disease. Many live\u2010attenuated VACV strains (first generation vaccines) were used in different parts of the world (83): Lister or Lister/Elstree strain was the most widely used vaccine globally; New York City Board of Health (NYCBOH; later produced by Wyeth Laboratories as Dryvax) strain was used in the Americas and West Africa; Copenhagen strain (Denmark), and the Ankara strain (Turkey) were also widely used. These VACV variants are known to differ in the expression of several virulence factors that determine their replicative capacity and safety profiles (83, 84). It was the ability of these VACV strains to induce robust humoral and cell\u2010mediated immunity (82, 83, 85) that led to the World Health Organization declaring the eradication of smallpox in 1980 and shortly thereafter routine vaccination with VACV could be discontinued in most countries.",

This allows for the insertion of multiple genes and the creation of multivalent vaccines. Furthermore, poxviruses have the potential to be administered by different routes, such as intradermal, intramuscular, oral, intranasal, intravaginal, and intrarectal routes to generate immunoglobulin and T\u2010cell responses. Over the last 30 years, a growing number of reports have described the utility of recombinant vaccinia viruses (rVACVs) expressing relevant antigens from multiple viral, bacterial, and parasitic pathogens to confer protection to immunized animals (81, 88, 89, 90, 91, 92, 93).",

Furthermore, these novel vaccine vectors have been increasingly used, again with varying degrees of success, in the development of therapeutic vaccines against several common cancer antigens (81, 100). The large number of clinical trials has produced a complicated picture with regards to using these vaccine vectors to generate a robust CD8+ T\u2010cell response. Despite a small number of clinical trials providing promising preliminary evidence for CD8+ T\u2010cell induction (101, 102), unfortunately, many trials demonstrate a limited induction of antigen\u2010specific CD8+ T cell against the infectious disease or cancer target of interest. For example, the immunogenicity of an attenuated ALVAC HIV\u20101 vaccine in humans was shown to be low, eliciting HIV\u20101\u2010specific CD8+ T\u2010cell responses in less than 25% of normal volunteers (103, 104, 105, 106). Similarly, the immunogenicity of MVA expressing the GAG protein (consensus of HIV\u20101 clade A) and several immunodominant CD8+ T\u2010cell epitopes was also shown to be unsatisfactory (17% response) (107). A smaller study using the same vaccines at a higher dose showed enhanced immunogenicity (40% response), but the T\u2010cell responses induced were exclusively CD4+ T\u2010cell driven (108). With regards to respiratory viruses, a small phase I clinical trial in healthy adults investigating a novel MVA\u2010based heterosubtypic influenza A vaccine (MVA \u2013 NP + M1) demonstrated that all volunteers had a significant increase in the number of IFN\u2010\u03b3 producing CD8+ T cells in their blood at weeks one, three and eight after intradermal or intramuscular vaccination (109). This response, however, rapidly declined over time, reaching prevaccination levels by week 52 postvaccination (109). This is consistent with an earlier preclinical study that demonstrated MVA\u2010induced T cell responses are followed several weeks later by a dramatic (20\u2010 to 40\u2010fold) contraction, a phenomenon that also occurred with DNA\u2010poxvirus regimens in which NYVAC and ALVAC were used for boosting (110). Another interesting characteristic of MVA vaccines was revealed by Pillai et al. 2011, in which MVA\u2010primed HIV\u20101 Gag\u2010specific memory cells were found to be predominantly of the TCM phenotype (CD62L and IL\u20102 positive) (111). Similarly, after a single immunization with MVA vector expressing pre\u2010erythrocytic malaria antigens, Reyes\u2010Sandoval et al. (112) found that MVA\u2010induced accelerated TCM rather than TEM generation and consequently failed to protect against malaria. These studies suggests that MVA in its current form may not be the most effective poxvirus vector for induction of strong and long\u2010lasting protective CD8+ T\u2010cell responses in peripheral tissues, such as the lung.",

In the interim, we have gained a number of important insights, which must be considered in our pursuit of safe and effective poxvirus\u2010based T\u2010cell vaccines. First, replication\u2010competent or highly virulent poxviruses, in general, promote a more potent primary and memory CD8+ T\u2010cell response compared with that of replication\u2010defective or highly attenuated vaccine strains. Second, replication\u2010defective poxviruses predominantly drive the induction of TCM cells over TEM cells. Third, in many instances, multiple dosing, or higher dosing (107\u2013109 pfu), with replication\u2010defective or highly attenuated poxvirus\u2010vaccine strains are necessary to achieve comparable levels of CD8+ T cells to those produced by live poxvirus\u2010vaccine strains. Finally, while attenuated poxvirus strains provide good short term T\u2010cell protection, they are not effective at conferring long term T\u2010cell\u2010mediated protection. As discussed previously, these limitations are logically related to antigen load, antigen persistence and the ability to effectively stimulate CD8+ T\u2010cell responses. Thus, a convincing argument can be made that a key challenge in utilizing attenuated poxvirus vectors to develop efficacious T\u2010cell vaccines is to define the molecular mechanisms that link virulence and immunogenicity. Toward this end, several recent studies have indicated that key events during initial T\u2010cell priming, including inflammatory stimuli (24, 54), co\u2010stimulation (114), CD4+ T\u2010cell help (115), and the cytokine mileu (54), have long\u2010lasting programing effects on the quantity, phenotype, and quality of the memory T cells generated in response to a live viral infection. In the following sections, we will discuss the importance of T\u2010cell costimulatory receptors, specifically, we will focus on the importance of TNF/TNFR family members, OX40 and OX40L, in eliciting protective T\u2010cell memory and their potential use as immunological adjuvants to enhance poxvirus\u2010based CD8+ T\u2010cell vaccines.",

            "text": "It has been hypothesized that the coevolution of pathogens and their hosts has been a major driving force behind the development of a highly sophisticated and extremely adaptable vertebrate immune system. This coevolution is clearly demonstrated by the fact that many large DNA viruses, such as poxviruses and herpesviruses, possess multiple homologues of cytokines, chemokines, or the associated receptors of these molecules, which can neutralize or modulate host immunity to favor the virus (116, 117, 118, 119). It is assumed that the main goal of these immune modulatory strategies is to enhance viral replication and survival; however, it is highly plausible that there exists unknown consequences of viral immune evasion strategies that may impact the host\u2019s immune response. Could it be possible that certain molecular pathways that regulate alternative immune responses, such as those involved in autoimmunity, allergic or even anti\u2010tumor responses, might have evolved or be differentially utilized as a consequence of viral evasion tactics. An obvious example is the large number of costimulatory receptors, especially in the immunoglobulin (Ig) and TNF/TNFR superfamilies that are expressed on T cells, and known to be critical for their activity. CD28\u2010B7, ICOS\u2010ICOSL, and CD2\u2010LFA\u20103 typify costimulatory molecules of the Ig superfamily (120, 121), whereas TNFR/TNF family members are typified by, but are not exclusive to, OX40\u2010OX40L, 4\u20101BB\u20104\u20101BBL, CD27\u2010CD70, GITR\u2010GITRL, CD30\u2010CD30L, and HVEM\u2010LIGHT (114, 122, 123, 124). Members of the TNF/TNFR superfamily are recognized for their ability to stimulate T cells and provide signals to promote sustained T\u2010cell clonal expansion and long\u2010term survival (114, 122, 123, 124). This is achieved through the selective targeting of intracellular signaling molecules that promote effector cytokine production, cell division and suppress apoptosis (114, 122, 123). Interestingly, there are a number of receptor\u2010ligand pairs within the TNF/TNFR superfamily that are not constitutively expressed, but are induced during specific inflammatory scenarios. They are thought to provide \u2018late\u2019 signals that subtly regulate T\u2010cell responses in both a quantitative and qualitative manner (114, 120, 122). Why so many costimulatory molecules exist, with often apparently similar and overlapping functional attributes, remains to be determined. Several pox and herpes viruses encode TNFR superfamily homologues (TNFR itself, CD30, and HVEM) that act as decoy receptors to modulate host immune responses to favor viral replication and persistence (125, 126, 127, 128). It is of interest, that recent analysis of the teleost genome, an organism in which the first fully functional adaptive immune system was thought to have developed, has revealed the presence of many human TNF superfamily orthologs. This provides evidence to suggest that many of the TNF superfamily members co\u2010emerged around the same time as did antigen receptors (129). Interestingly, however, four ligands were not found to exist within the teleost genome, namely OX40L, CD70 (the ligand for CD27), GITRL, and CD30L (129). As briefly discussed above, these are important regulators of the later phases of T\u2010cell expansion and survival, leading to the hypothesis that these ligands may have arisen more recently to allow immune adaptation, plasticity and effective development of protective immunity against pathogens. To test this hypothesis, we recently utilized several poxvirus infection models and investigated the use and role of select TNF/TNFR and Ig family members in initiating and sustaining protective CD8+ T\u2010cell responses.",

Consequently, we found that after intranasal or intraperitoneal infection only the WR VACV strain replicated rapidly, reaching high titers across multiple tissues (76 and Salek\u2010Ardakani unpublished observations), and resulting in severe and sustained inflammation.

Similar differences were observed at the peak (days seven and eight) of the initial effector CD8+ T\u2010cell response, implying that altered molecular regulation at this phase of the response could explain the difference in size of the memory pool generated. To highlight the importance of CD8+ T cells in protecting against subsequent viral encounter, MHC class\u2010II\u2010deficient mice (MHC II\u2212/\u2212), that lack CD4+ T cells and therefore can not generate VACV\u2010specific humoral immunity, were vaccinated with WR, Lister, and NYCBOH and challenged 70 days later with a lethal intranasal dose of VACV\u2010WR (76). All mice vaccinated with the WR strain, the most virulent virus, survived the lethal infection and presented mild disease symptoms. In contrast, no protection was evident in mice vaccinated with either attenuated strain (Lister or NYCBOH), resulting in comparable mortality and disease severity to that observed in na\u00efve (unvaccinated) mice. This demonstrated that a VACV strain capable of replicating to greater titers, in multiple tissues and over a longer period of time promotes greater number of persisting antigen\u2010reactive CD8+ T cells that afford protection against a highly lethal respiratory virus challenge. In humans, immunization with live\u2010attenuated VACV (Lister or NYCBOH) elicits what was previously thought to be a good memory CD8+ T\u2010cell response (85, 131, 132). The VACV\u2010specific memory CD8+ T\u2010cell pool has been shown to persist for many years in the majority of vaccine recipients; however, recent observations have highlighted a rapid decline in memory CD8+ T\u2010cell numbers does occur in a significant group of individuals over time (133, 134, 135). This raised concerns as to whether optimal long\u2010lived CD8+ T\u2010cell immunity can in fact be generated using first generation VACV strains. Our data provides considerable evidence to warrant these concerns as vaccination using the virulent VACV\u2010WR promoted far superior numbers of protective memory CD8+ T\u2010cells. This result raised the question as to whether a specific molecular mechanism exists that is engaged during an infection with the virulent WR strain, but not the attenuated Lister or NYCBOH VACV strains. If alternate molecular control mechanisms are evident, they could potentially be harnessed to enhance CD8+ T\u2010cell responses generated by attenuated poxvirus vaccines.",

Maximal expression is typically observed between two and five days following T\u2010cell activation after which OX40 is downregulated, implying a delayed mode of action in primary immune responses (114, 122, 124). Consistent with this, we recently reported that OX40 was seen on a proportion of VACV\u2010specific CD8+ T cells as early as day four and peaked on day five postinfection with VACV\u2010WR (136). In our initial studies, we found that the development of high numbers of effector CD8+ T cells capable of producing both IFN\u03b3 and TNF\u03b1 was strongly impaired when OX40 was lacking on a CD8+ T\u2010cell responding to VACV (124, 136). Analysis of the main immunodominant CD8+ T\u2010cell populations (B8R, A3L, A8R, A23R, and B2R), which account for close to 70% of the whole VACV\u2010specific response, demonstrated a global impairment in CD8+ T\u2010cell priming in the absence of OX40 such that the response was reduced by between 70% and 80% (136). We further demonstrated that the engagement and activity of OX40 during a virulent viral infection ensured the generation of a high frequency of persisting and functional memory CD8+ T cells that located to the lung (136).

CD28\u2010deficient mice exhibited defective memory CD8+ T\u2010cell generation in response to Lister and NYCBOH, but not interestingly to WR, even though CD28 was required for an optimal effector response to this virus (76). This indicates that in response to VACV\u2010WR infection, there exists a CD28\u2010dependent phase of CD8+ T\u2010cell priming followed by a CD28\u2010independent phase. CD27 signaling has previously been shown to prolong CD8+ T\u2010cell survival beyond the effector phase of the immune response and thus serves to increase the number of memory cells by inhibiting effector T\u2010cell death (124, 142, 143, 144). Consistent with these results, blocking the CD27 and CD70 interactions in CD28\u2010deficient mice late in the primary response (between five and eight days) completely abrogated the CD28\u2010independent CD8+ T\u2010cell responses to VACV\u2010WR (76). These results support a model in which a temporal sequence of events is necessary for optimal virus\u2010specific CD8+ T\u2010cell proliferation, survival and memory generation, brought about by a specific sequential engagement of costimulatory molecules CD28, OX40, and CD27.",

Initial studies on OX40\u2212/\u2212 and OX40L\u2212/\u2212 mice independently infected with lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV), vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV), Theiler\u2019s murine encephalomyelitis (TMEV), and influenza virus demonstrated no defect in control of viral replication or the generation of effector CD8+ T\u2010cell populations (124, 145, 146, 147, 148).

It should be stressed that prevention of weight loss during the first seven days of infection is extremely difficult to achieve, especially with such high\u2010challenge doses (x 300 LD50) that were used in our experiments, and therefore an important demonstration of the utility of agonistically targeting OX40 in antiviral protection. More interestingly, targeting OX40 induced almost complete protection in mice immunized with a low dose of B8R20\u201027 that alone was ineffective at preventing lethality. This was reflected in both minimal loss of weight and mortality, as well as lung immunopathology (161). As before, the extent of protection directly correlated with the number of IFN\u2010\u03b3 producing B8R\u2010specific memory CD8+ T\u2010cells that were generated in the lung after OX40 engagement, and the number that accumulated after intranasal infection.
