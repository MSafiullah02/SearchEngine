Myocardial injury and heart failure presented before death may be attributed to other reasons, like severe hypoxia induced myocardial ischemia, management of mechanical ventilation or ECMO, multiple organ failure requiring kidney or liver replacement therapies, severe water and electrolyte unbalance or irreversible metabolic acidosis and coagulation dysfunction, which would cause severe systemic disorders in patients with COVID-19. All these conditions may have influences on the heart and cause secondary myocardial injury and heart failure. Though this was not the presence of the novel coronavirus directly attacking the heart, the elevation in cardiac markers should be considered as a warning sign, highly suggesting for recent adverse clinical outcomes of patients with COVID-19.

For all the patients who died during hospitalization, cardiac markers were elevated before death (Supplementary Fig. 1) and cardiac troponin I was peaked within a week preceding death with the median time of 2 days (IQR: 0.0-5.5; range: 0.0-7.0 days).", "latex": null, "type": "figure"}, "FIGREF2": {"text": "Our findings will facilitate understanding of COVID-19 and improve clinical strategies and management against the disease. From the clinical standpoint and front-line data analysis in our study, though there was evidence of myocardial injury and 12.5% COVID-19 patients had cardiac abnormalities similar to myocarditis, the characteristic changes of cardiac troponin I over time and the absence of typical signs on echocardiography and ECG have suggested that myocardial injury is more likely related to systemic consequences rather than direct damage by the 2019 novel coronavirus. The elevation in cardiac markers was probably due to secondary and systemic causes and can be considered as the warning sign for recent adverse clinical outcomes of the patients. ] Z. Xu, L. Shi, Y.
