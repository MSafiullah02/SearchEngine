It is estimated to cause 50\u2013100 million symptomatic infections annually [1]. The complex interactions between the virus and the human population have resulted in an unpredictable disease evolution and variable clinical outcomes associated with the infection. The majority of infections are mild and self-limiting, but a small number progress to severe clinical manifestations, which can lead to severe organ complications and even death [2\u20134]. Dengue virus (DENV) is a Flavivirus from the Flaviviridae family. Its RNA genome is approximately 11-kb long and contains an open reading frame, which codes for three structural and five non-structural proteins. The virus has four distinct antigenic serotypes and several genotypes, which produce different outcomes during outbreaks [5\u20137].",

Countries in Southeast Asia (SE Asia) are generally more urban and have high population densities, while the Pacific Island countries (PICTs) are rural, and their populations are scattered across many islands. Previous DF outbreaks in the PICTs were caused by a single serotype, which occurred every 5 to 10 years [8]. On the other hand, in SE Asia all four DENV serotypes are circulating, and a 3-year wave-like outbreak pattern, in which the disease emanates from a central metropolitan city, is seen. There have been very few quality descriptive studies of DF conducted in the PICTs, resulting in a paucity of information about the magnitudes and drivers of DF epidemics in this region. The available studies were mostly based in a clinic setting or involved specific groups like a blood donor population [9, 10]. The principal vectors of DF, Aedes aegypti (Linnaeus, 1762) and Aedes albopictus (Skuse, 1894), are present in both SE Asia and the PICTs.",

A 10-year inter-epidemic cyclic pattern was observed until 2008, when DENV-4 first started to circulate the region [12]. A subsequent outbreak in 2013 was more severe, resulting in the first reported deaths [13]. This outbreak was unique, as it lasted longer than usual, i.e., previous outbreaks lasted 2 years, but the 2013 outbreak lasted until early 2016. This, in addition to the global expansion and reported occurrence of Zika virus (ZIKV) and chikungunya virus (CHKV) infections in the region [14, 15], prompted us to carry out this study.",

The cDNA samples were stored at \u2212 20 \u00b0C, before being used for various molecular tests. The qPCR screening used previously described DENV serotype-specific and ZIKV-specific primers (Table 1) with some modifications [17\u201319].

The qPCR setup involved an initial temperature of 95 \u00b0C for 30 s, followed by 40 cycles of 15 s at 95 \u00b0C, and 30 s at 57 \u00b0C. To detect CHKV, the primers listed in Table 1 were designed based on the conserved region of the envelope gene, which was based on an alignment that included the Papua New Guinea (PNG) sequence (MF773569). The primer was first characterized by making 10-fold serial dilutions of 9.6 \u00d7 105 copies of the E1 gene using the qPCR conditions described above. The amplification curve and Tm peak value were analyzed to calculate the correlation coefficient and consensus peak values of the primer. Sequence confirmation of 10% of the qPCR products was then performed to further validate the primer.\n",

The PCR products were then cycle-sequenced using the BigDye Terminator cycle sequencing kit (version 3.1), before being sequenced on the ABI3130xl automated sequence analyzer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.). The final 1485-bp sequence for DENV-2 and the final 1479-bp sequence for DENV-3 were obtained by manually assembling the overlapping sequences in BioEdit (version 7.19) [21]. Our study sequences were uploaded to the DNA Data Bank of Japan (DDBJ) under accession numbers LC440471 to LC440484. These sequences were combined with those circulating SE Asia, Australia, and PICTs (from GenBank) to construct a phylogenetic tree using the maximum likelihood (ML) method in the software MEGA (version 7) [22]. Multiple full-envelope nucleotide sequences were aligned using Clustal W, which is integrated into the MEGA software, while evolutionary distances were computed using the recommended Tamura-Nei + G model. The reliability of the ML analysis was evaluated via a bootstrap test of 3000 replications. A different genotype from that of the interest group was set as an outgroup in each of the dengue trees.",

The 2016 sentinel data represented 45% of all DLI syndromic cases, as reported previously [16].

It was therefore not ideal for investigating the ZIKV or CHKV, which have low prevalence rates. As the clinical study was initially only planned to involve molecular virological surveillance, it lacks demographic and clinical information. This also explains why the April 2016 samples were not subjected to serological testing.

The displacement of a single serotype (DENV-3) by a newly introduced one (DENV-2) was the predominant cause of the 2016 DLI outbreak, but there was evidence of ZIKV and CHKV co-circulating. The outbreak pattern suggests that natural population immunity is still the main control mechanism and that the population will always be vulnerable to vector-borne diseases. There is a need to step up vector-control activities and community mobilization to reduce the threat of such diseases in Solomon Islands. We recommend that Solomon Islands needs to increase its capacity for disease surveillance to include molecular screening of different arboviruses and some capacity to perform regular sequencing of the envelope genes of viral isolates. We also recommend the surveillance of disease vectors and their insecticide-resistance status. The communication of this information within the region will enable each country/territory to prepare as best as they can for the next outbreak.",
