The MERS-CoV animal model experiments and protocols were discussed explicitly and extensively among the staff members of the Department of Pathogen Biology. These discussions were followed by additional discussions with biosafety officers and facility managers at the ILAS of PUMC, as well as with numerous specialists from the SARS-CoV and general infectious disease fields throughout China. All research procedures were approved by the ILAS Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee and Laboratory Safety Committee (LSC). The committee recommended that the number of animals be reduced to comply with the 3R (reduction, replacement, refinement) principles; we therefore designed the experiments to include 6 animals to test the animal model of MERS-CoV, 4 monkeys infected with virus and 2 uninfected monkeys as controls. The approved registration number is ILAS-PC-2013-004.",

Chest X-rays were performed before inoculation and 3 and 5 days postinoculation (d.p.i.) with MERS-CoV. Two infected monkeys and a control monkey were sacrificed at 3 d.p.i.

All complementary DNA (cDNA) samples were stored at \u221220\u00b0C until use in the polymerase chain reaction (PCR). For most experimental samples and the positive control (hCoV-EMC), duplicate cDNA samples were obtained from each total RNA sample. The primers used for hCoV-EMC were described previously [20] and are specific for the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) gene. The sequences of the primers used for PCR detection were as follows: RdRpSeq-Fwd (TGCTATWAGTGCTAAGAATAGRGC; R = A/G, W = A/T) and RdRpSeq-Rev (GCATWGCNCWGTCACACTTAGG; W = A/T, N = A/C/T/G).

For cases in which no amplification products were obtained with the PCR assay, a 50-\u00b5L second-round reaction was set up containing 2 \u00b5L of the reaction mixture from the first round, the primer RdRpSeq-Fwd (the same as that used in the first round), and RdRpSeq-Rnest (CACTTAGGRTARTCCCAWCCCA).

The body weight of each monkey was also recorded prior to viral infection, but no significant change in mean weight was observed. Virus replication was detected in the lungs of the infected animals. However, we did not detect virus RNA or measurable titers in the nasal turbinate or oropharyngeal samples, suggesting that the monkeys did not shed virus in the upper-respiratory tract.

The pathological presentation of pneumonia was also observed in the infected monkeys (Figure 3); however, no extrapulmonary lesions were found. These findings are consistent with the report by Vincent et al, who reported similar findings of acute localized-to-widespread pneumonia that resulted in mild-to-moderate clinical disease [15]. In humans, renal failure is a major symptom of MERS; however, we observed no pathological changes in the kidneys. The reasons for this discrepancy are not clear and deserve further study. It is possible that dissemination of the virus may not yet have occurred and the virus was limited to the lung, as we did not detect the virus in the blood.",
