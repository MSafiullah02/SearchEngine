Although she did not possess the scientific knowledge of asepsis, she conducted research into hospital sanitation. The results of her research made her a believer in pure air, pure water, efficient drainage, cleanliness, and light. In her writings she often described the putrid conditions she found in hospitals. She once stated, \u201cIt may seem a strange principle to enunciate as the very first requirement in a hospital that it should do the sick no harm.\u201d1 Her beliefs in prevention led to a standard of structured cleanliness and sanitation in hospitals and the military. Florence Nightingale understood that failure to apply infection control measures favors the spread of pathogens and that health care settings can act as amplifiers of disease during outbreaks, with an impact on both hospital and community health.",

HAIs may be caused by any infectious agent, including bacteria, fungi, and viruses, as well as other less common types of pathogens. They are among the leading causes of preventable deaths in the United States and are associated with a substantial increase in health care costs each year. HAIs affect 5% to 10% of hospitalized patients in the US each year. HAIs lead to extended hospital stays, contribute to increased medical costs, and are a significant cause of morbidity and mortality. Approximately 1.7 million HAIs occur in US hospitals annually, resulting in 99,000 deaths and an estimated $20 billion in health care costs.2\n",
