Previous studies have described potentially pathogenic infections of Babesia vesperuginis in insectivorous bats in Europe, the Americas and Asia. To date, no babesial infections have been documented in the bats of Madagascar, or in any frugivorous bat species worldwide. Results: We used standard microscopy and conventional PCR to identify babesiae in blood from the endemic Madagascan flying fox (Pteropus rufus). Out of 203 P. rufus individuals captured between November 2013 and January 2016 and screened for erythrocytic parasites, nine adult males (4.43%) were infected with babesiae. Phylogenetic analysis of sequences obtained from positive samples indicates that they cluster in the Babesia microti clade, which typically infect felids, rodents, primates, and canids, but are distinct from B. vesperuginis previously described in bats. Statistical analysis of ecological trends in the data suggests that infections were most commonly observed in the rainy season and in older-age individuals. No pathological effects of infection on the host were documented; age-prevalence patterns indicated susceptible-infectious (SI) transmission dynamics characteristic of a non-immunizing persistent infection.",

Much like parasites of their sister order, Haemosporida (the causative agents of malaria), babesiae can induce disease, including anemia and haemoglobinuria, when replicating in the red blood cells of mammalian hosts [2] . Among these hosts, insectivorous bats infected with Babesia vesperuginis display elevated reticulocyte and white blood cell counts, lowered haemoglobin levels, and splenomegaly, as compared with uninfected individuals [3, 4] . Such reports are intriguing, given widespread debate in the literature as to the extent to which bats -the purportedly tolerant reservoirs for virulent zoonoses, such as Ebola, Nipah, and SARS [5] -experience pathology from any microparasitic infections [6] . Admittedly, most discussions of bat pathogen tolerance have been limited to Old World fruit bats [7, 8] , distinct from the insectivorous bat hosts of B. vesperuginis. Babesia vesperuginis has been identified in bats across Europe [9] [10] [11] , the Americas [12] and China [13, 14] ; such widespread host and geographical ranges suggest, contrary to popular dogma, that infection-associated pathology is unlikely to be severe.",

Typically, babesiae are vectored by ixodid ticks, which acquire and transmit the piroplasmid during blood meals [1] , though some have speculated (without confirmation) that the bat-specific soft tick, Argas vespertilionis, could act as a B. vesperuginis vector [3] . Studies of babesial infections in captive baboon populations suggest between-host transmission in the absence of available tick vectors, indicating that direct horizontal and/or vertical transmission may also be possible [16] .",

Previous work on the island of Madagascar has documented insectivorous bat infections with microfilaria and with several hemoprotozoa (leucocytozoans, haemosporidians, and trypanosoma), but authors noted the absence of any blood parasites in two endemic Madagascan fruit bats (Eidolon dupreanum and Rousettus madagascariensis) [20, 21] .

Initial tree(s) for the heuristic search were obtained automatically by applying Neighbor-Join and BioNJ algorithms to a matrix of pairwise distances estimated using the Maximum Composite Likelihood (MCL) approach, and then selecting the topology with superior log likelihood value.

No noticeable enlargement of infected red blood cells and no hemozoin pigments were observed in any infection. We successfully estimated parasitemia for five of nine positive blood smears, though only 133 microscope fields were observable in a partially-damaged blood smear recovered from bat ID: AMBK_046 (in contrast to the standard 200 fields observed in the other four slides, see 'Methods'). In the four smears which were not assessed, parasites were only found in the thick layer of the smear, making estimation of parasite load impossible. Of the five counted, we recovered the highest parasitemia (0.3%) in one sample from Moramanga (ID: AMBK_047); all other observed samples yielded parasitemias of less than 0.1%.",

Sequences showed 936/966 bp (97.89%) identity to a baboon Babesia sp. from a captive colony in the USA (GQ225744.1; [40] ) and 935/970 bp (96.39%) identity to a Babesia leo-like species recovered from a domestic cat in South Africa (KC790444.1).

Phylogenetic analysis (Fig. 3) suggests that observed Madagascan flying fox Babesia spp. fall within the monophyletic clade encompassing small-sized feline, rodent, primate and canid babesiae (the so-called 'Microti Group' [1, 26, 27, 41] ), distinct from B. vesperuginis sequences which, by contrast, clustered with Babesia spp. of the 'Duncani Group, ' or 'Western clade' [42] . Because only partial sequences of the 18S rRNA gene are currently available for B. vesperuginis, as well as for P. rufus genotypes and their closest matches in GenBank, phylogenetic inference across all clades was limited to a 573 bp fragment only (Fig. 3) .",

Specifically, we describe infection of novel Babesia spp. genotypes in blood from the Madagascan flying fox Pteropus rufus. Notably, these new Babesia spp. cluster phylogenetically within the B. microti clade, aligning most closely with a Babesia sp. lineage reported from Madagascan lemurs [39] , rather than with the bat-specific B. vesperuginis [10] . We documented slight genetic variation among our recovered sequences, though no compelling evidence of clearly distinct genotypes. Mixed infections of multiple species within a single host are common in piroplasmids generally [43, 44] but were not identified here. Classically, Babesia spp. have been subdivided morphologically into small and large groups [45, 46] , although more recent analyses have relied on molecular methods to reclassify Babesia spp. in four-to-six major phylogenetic subclades, including the 'Microti Clade' highlighted here [1, 26, 27, 41] . Morphological observations of P. rufus babesiae further support their placement in the 'Microti Clade' , in which the typical trophozoite appears rounded, with a diameter of 1-2.5 \u03bcm [2] and with chromatins in a variety of single, double and multiple dot forms that multiply as the trophozoite advances in life stage [47] . The tetrad replication structure ('Maltese cross') observed in P. rufus babesiae is a characteristic feature of 'Microti Clade' infections [2] . Sequences derived from previously described bat-infecting B. vesperuginis appear to cluster within a whole different piroplasmid clade entirely (the 'Duncani Group') from that recovered for P. rufus babesiae. Two previous phylogenetic analyses, based on a small sequence fragment (624 bp) of the 18S rRNA gene only [9, 10] , instead placed B. vesperuginis in the 'true Babesia' subclade, though more recent inference based on phylogenies of both 18S rRNA and cox1 genes, supports our results [48] . Ultimately, amplification of a more significant region of the 18S rRNA gene for B. vesperuginis and accompanying morphological studies will be needed to clarify its placement. Regardless, it appears to be significantly different from the Madagascan flying fox Babesia spp. described here.",

Pteropus rufus roost in trees that overlap lemur habitat [50] , presenting opportunities for potential cross-species transmission by blood-feeding arthropods. Nonetheless, in 15 months of sampling, our field team failed to recover any ectoparasites from 203 captured P. rufus, a b c d despite successful collection of bat flies and fleas from other frugivorous bats sampled during this same period [38] . The arboreal lifestyle of P. rufus may subject the bats to environmental fluctuations and climatic instabilities that limit the extent of ectoparasite infestation, and it is possible that low prevalence ectoparasite infestations were simply missed. Ticks are known to switch among vertebrate hosts as they mature across advancing life stages [51] , and their presence on any given species can be seasonal and brief. Previous studies of closely-related babesial infections in captive baboons also indicate that transmission and maintenance of these parasites may also be possible via horizontal or vertical mechanisms in the absence of available arthropod vectors [16] .",

Our findings recapitulate much classic Babesia epidemiology from other systems. In particular, we uncovered evidence of seasonality in Babesia prevalence, with infection peaking during the wet season, a pattern consistent with the established literature [39, 52] . Additionally, we found that all bats identified as positive for babesial infection in our system were males, a sex-biased pattern also consistent with Babesia prevalence patterns reported in some other host systems [52] [53] [54] . This disparity may simply reflect a surface area effect in that larger-bodied individuals in this sexually size-dimorphic species [39, 55] have an elevated probability of ectoparasite infestation and corresponding infection risk, but could, likewise, result from true sex differences in immune function. Previous work has demonstrated that testosterone impairs both innate and acquired resistance to tick infestations in rodents and supports higher parasitemia and longer duration infections of B. microti in rodent hosts [56, 57] .",

Our identification of the second-known lineage of bat-infecting babesiae therefore raises the question of its impact on bat health. The low infection rate recovered from our study precludes any sweeping inferences in this regard, though the nine babesiae-positive bats identified in our analysis appeared no less ostensibly 'healthy' than uninfected counterparts -and in fact, demonstrated higher average body mass for their size than did babesiae-negative individuals. As with male-biased infection, such results may simply reflect a surface area effect of higher probability of ectoparasite infestation and corresponding babesial infection in larger animals, but these findings could also indicate parasite preference for hosts better equipped to provide rich resource subsidies. In keeping with the lack of ostensible pathology, we observed no statistically significant differences in relative white blood cell counts between infected and uninfected hosts, although further sampling is needed to clarify whether babesial infection induces leukocytosis in P. rufus. The low number of infection-positive individuals recovered limited our inference in this regard. All told, categorical assessment of bat health was incomplete in our study, as no physiological assays were performed and no necropsies carried out on any sampled individuals (all bats were live-released following capture).",

Age-prevalence data were best fit by a compartmental transmission model incorporating susceptible-infectious (SI) transmission dynamics, by which hosts are born susceptible, then subjected to a constant (albeit low) force of infection across the duration of their lifespans. As with body condition, our inference must be tempered by the rarity of positive samples recovered in our dataset; however, these patterns support our other observations of the lack of any pathological effect of infection on host health. Such findings are consistent with reports of persistent, low parasitemia babesial infections which can establish for years in other hosts, including mice [58, 59] , cattle [60] , and even humans [61, 62] -but counter to the established dogma of pathology associated with B. vesperuginis infections in insectivorous bats [3] . Further research will be needed to clarify the true extent of pathogenicity for these parasites and determine whether these discrepancies, if genuine, reflect differences in the two different babesiae, their hosts (i.e. fruit bats versus insectivorous bats), or the timing of the parasite life-cycle during which sampling took place. In babesial infections of other hosts, long-term persistent infections can establish after control and survival of acute pathology [2, 63] , meaning that sampling during only part of the parasite life-cycle could yield biased interpretations of virulence.",

Comparisons of the 18S rRNA gene of parasites recovered from this study indicate that the new Babesia spp. sequences are distinct from previously identified bat-infecting B. vesperuginis, instead aligning most closely with sequences derived from Madagascan lemurs and other parasites in the B. microti clade. Our findings offer unique insights into the landscape of microparasitic infection for fruit bat reservoirs for emerging infectious disease.",
