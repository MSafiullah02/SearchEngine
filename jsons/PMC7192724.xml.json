The IB virus (IBV), which is a\ncausative agent of IB, primarily infects the respiratory tract and some variants or several\nfield isolates affect the kidney and reproductive system, and subsequently induces various\ndisorders to the host. The pathogenicity of IBV is very complex and constantly alters in the\nfield strain, making it difficult to take control and protection measures for IB.",

The IBV genome encodes the non-structural protein, accessory protein, and four\nstructural proteins. Of the structural proteins, the spike (S) glycoprotein is processed into\ntwo subunits, S1 and S2, by post-translational cleavage. The S1 glycoprotein is serologically\nessential as the target of the neutralization antibody against IBV [5, 12]. Hence, it has been focused on\nthe sequence of the S1 gene to analyze the molecular characterization of IBV. In Japan, Mase\net al. initially identified the five genotypes (JP-I, JP-II, JP-III, Mass\nand Gray) based on the S1 sequence of IBV isolated since 1950 [17]. Subsequently, the existence of another genotype (4/91 and JP-IV) was reported\n[18, 19]. The\n7 genotypes have been identified in Japan so far.",

Therefore, it appeared that the two genotypes\nhave been predominant in Kagoshima prefecture since 2008. The JP-I is indigenous to Japan\n[17], and it was speculated that the JP-I has\noriginally evolved for a long time also in Kagoshima prefecture. On the other hand, the origin\nof JP-III is unclear. The phylogenetic analysis of present and previous studies suggests that\nthe JP-III is closely related to the isolate in China [1, 17]. It has been believed that the IBV has a\nwide host range and infects not only poultry but also wild birds such as a duck [6, 15]. Mase\net al. inferred the possibility of involvement of wild birds regarding the\ndissemination of IBV into Japan [17]. In Kagoshima\nprefecture, there is a large plain (called \u201cIzumi plain\u201d) as an overwintering site for wild\nmigrant birds including a duck that infects with a virus such as avian influenza virus and\nthat migrates among neighboring countries including China [21]. The predominance of JP-III in Kagoshima prefecture might not be irrelevant to\nthe existence of a \u201cportal site\u201d, such as Izumi plain, for viruses derived from neighboring\ncountries.",

The 3 samples were collected from 3 different cases (Case 2, 8 and 11 in Table 1) and the earliest detection case was in\nJanuary 2009 in a broiler farm (Case 2 in Table\n1). On the other hand, the JP-IV was initially reported as a novel genotype of IBV in\nJapan, which was identified from the samples collected in September 2009 in a layer farm\nlocated at Ibaraki prefecture [19], more than 1,000 km\nfar away from Kagoshima prefecture. Although the JP-IV was found in the farms located at\nIbaraki and Kagoshima prefecture almost during the corresponding period, there was no\ngeographic and epidemiological relationship between the two farms. Hence, it appeared that\nJP-IV has widely disseminated into Japan since at least 2009. In addition, the virulence of\nJP-IV was believed to be low in the previous study [19]. However, the both of respiratory and renal lesions were histopathologically\nconfirmed in 2 of 3 cases (Case 8 and 11, Table 1)\nthat the JP-IV was detected, and the JP-IV alone was detected in Case 11 (Table 1). The 2 cases suggest the altered pathogenicity of JP-IV\nstrain in Japan although the virulence to affected chickens in the cases might not necessarily\nbe due to the IBV alone because of the complications such as Coccidiosis and Colibacillosis.\nMoreover, the antigenicity of JP-IV differs from others detected in Japan [19]. Therefore, the JP-IV strain could be a great threat to\nall of the chicken farms in Japan. Further studies regarding the pathogenicity and the\nprevalent status of JP-IV strain in Japan would be needed for the prevention of IB caused by\nJP-IV strain.",
