Active M pro is a homodimer containing two protomers. The CoV M pro features a noncanonical Cys-His dyad located in the cleft between domains I and II (17) (18) (19) . M pro is conserved among CoVs and several common features are shared among the substrates of M pro in different CoVs. The amino acids in substrates from the N terminus to C terminus are numbered as fellows (-P4-P3-P2-P1\u2193P1\u2032-P2\u2032-P3\u2032-), and the cleavage site is between the P1 and P1\u2032. In particular, a Gln residue is almost always required in the P1 position of the substrates. There is no human homolog of M pro which makes it an ideal antiviral target (20) (21) (22) .",

By analyzing the substrate-binding pocket of SARS-CoV M pro (PDB ID: 2H2Z), novel inhibitors targeting the SARS-CoV-2 M pro were designed and synthesized (Fig. 1) . The thiol of a cysteine residue in the S1\u2032 sites anchors inhibitors by a covalent linkage that is important for the inhibitors to maintain antiviral activity. In our design of new inhibitors, an aldehyde was selected as a new warhead in P1 in order to form a covalent bond with cysteine. The reported SARS-CoV M pro inhibitors often have an (S)-\u03b3lactam ring that occupies the S1 site of M pro , and this ring was expected to be a good choice in P1 (23) . Furthermore, the S2 site of coronavirus M pro is usually large enough to accommodate the bigger P2 fragment. To test the importance of different ring systems, a cyclohexyl or 3fluorophenyl were introduced in P2, with the fluorine expected to enhance activity. An indole group was introduced into P3 in order to form new hydrogen bonds with S4 and improve drug-like properties.",

Details of the interaction are shown in Fig. 3 , B and C. The electron density shows that the C of the aldehyde group of 11a and the catalytic site Cys145 of SARS-CoV-2 M pro form a standard 1.8-\u00c5 C-S covalent bond. The oxygen atom of the aldehyde group also plays a crucial role in stabilizing the conformations of the inhibitor by forming a 2.9-\u00c5 hydrogen bond with the backbone of residues Cys145 in the S1\u2032 site. The (S)-\u03b3-lactam ring of 11a at P1 fits well into the S1 site. The oxygen of the (S)-\u03b3-lactam group forms a 2.7-\u00c5 hydrogen bond with the side chain of His163. The main chain of Phe140 and side chain of Glu166 also participate in stabilizing the (S)-\u03b3-lactam ring by forming 3.2-\u00c5 and 3.0-\u00c5 hydrogen bonds with its NH group, respectively. In addition, the amide bonds on the chain of 11a are hydrogen-bonded with the main chains of His164 (3.2 \u00c5) and Glu166 (2.8 \u00c5), respectively. The cyclohexyl moiety of 11a at P2 deeply inserts into the S2 site, stacking with the imidazole ring of His41. The cyclohexyl group is also surrounded by the side chains of Met49, Tyr54, Met165, Asp187 and Arg188, producing extensive hydrophobic interactions. The indole group of 11a at P3 is exposed to solvent (S4 site) and is stabilized by Glu166 through a 2.6-\u00c5 hydrogen bond. The side chains of residues Pro168 and Gln189 interact with the indole group of 11a through hydrophobic interactions. Interestingly, multiple water molecules (named W1-W6) play an important role in binding 11a. W1 interacts with the amide bonds of 11a through a 2.9-\u00c5 hydrogen bond, whereas W2-6 form a number of hydrogen bonds with the aldehyde group of 11a and the residues of Asn142, Gly143, Thr26, Thr25, His41 and Cys44, which contributes to stabilizing 11a in the binding pocket.",

The side chains of residues His41, Met49, Met165, Val186, Asp187 and Arg188 interact with this aryl group through hydrophobic interactions and the side chain of Gln189 stabilizes the 3-fluorophenyl group with an additional 3.0-\u00c5 hydrogen bond (Fig. 3 , E and F).

As shown in table S2, compound 11a given intraperitoneally (5 mg/kg) and intravenously (5 mg/kg) displayed a half-life (T1/2) of 4.27 hours and 4.41 hours, respectively, and a high maximal concentration (C max = 2394 ng/mL) and a good bioavailability of 87.8% were observed when the compound 11a was given intraperitoneally. Metabolic stability of 11a in mice was also good (Clearance (CL) = 17.4 mL/min/mg). When administered intraperitoneally (20 mg/kg), subcutaneously (5 mg/kg) and intravenously (5 mg/kg), compound 11b also showed good PK properties (the bioavailability of intraperitoneally and subcutaneously are more than 80%, and a longer T1/2 of 5.21 hours when 11b was given intraperitoneally). Considering the danger of COVID-19, we selected the intravenous drip administration to further study for the reason that value of the area under the curve (AUC) is high and the effect is rapid. Compared with 11a administrated intravenously, the T 1/2 (1.65h) of 11b is shorter and the clearance rate is faster (CL = 20.6 mL/min/mg). Compound 11a was selected for further investigation with intravenous drip dosing in Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats and Beagle dogs. The results showed (table S3) that 11a exhibited long T 1/2 (SD rat, 7.6 hours and Beagle dog, 5.5h), low clearance rate (rat, 4.01 mL/min/kg and dog, 5.8 mL/min/kg) and high AUC value (rat, 41500 hours*ng/mL and dog, 14900 hours*ng/mL)). Those above PK results indicate that compound 11a is worth to warrant further study.",

No SD rats died after receiving 40 mg/kg by intravenous drip administration. When the dosage was raised to 60 mg/kg, one of four SD rats died. The dose range toxicity study of 11a was conducted for seven days at dosing levels of 2, 6, and 18 mg/kg on SD rats and at 10-40 mg/kg on Beagle dogs. All animals received once daily dosing (QD), by intravenous drip, and all animals were clinically observed at least once a day. No obvious toxicity was observed in either group. These above data indicated that 11a is good candidate for further clinical studies. (Page numbers not final at time of first release) 6 The cytotoxicity of these compounds in Vero E6 cells was also determined by using CCK8 assays.
