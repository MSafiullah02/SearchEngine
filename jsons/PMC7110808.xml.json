A substantial contributor to this is the largely unknown etiology of most pneumoniae, with both viral and bacterial origin.

Identification of low incidence seasons would provide a target window for vaccination, with the hope of maximizing population immunity before the onset of the influenza season. Similarly, when respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) vaccination becomes available, knowledge of its seasonality will be useful to maximize benefit (Drysdale et al., 2016, Anderson et al., 2013), and in the potential administration of passive immunoprophylaxis with palivizumab to reduce the number of severe outcomes associated with RSV infection among high-risk infants (Committee on Infectious Diseases, 2009). Finally, knowledge of seasonal patterns of virus circulation can inform the clinical use of antibiotics, again limiting use when viral circulation is traditionally high to minimize antibiotic resistance (Van Nguyen et al., 2013, Laxminarayan et al., 2013, Laxminarayan et al., 2016, Van Boeckel et al., 2014).",

Information on viral transmission dynamics across seasons in Vietnam is relatively under-explored. Do et al. found seasonality of RSV infections and slight seasonality of HMPV infections in Ho Chi Minh City, but no seasonality of influenza (Do et al., 2011). Several studies have similarly found high variability in Influenza A & B incidence over the year (Nguyen et al., 2007, Le et al., 2015, Thai et al., 2015). Yoshida et al. found RSV occurring in the hot months, influenza A in the cool months, and year-round detection of HRV in Nha Trang (Yoshida et al., 2010). Few other studies have examined seasonality of these common viruses across South East Asia.",

The hospital based enhanced surveillance of childhood ARI is ongoing. We analyze data from January 29, 2007 to April 26, 2012 at Khanh Hoa General Hospital (KHGH) which is the only tertiary care facility located in Khanh Hoa Province. According to the field site census survey in July 2006, the study catchment area encompassing the 16 non-touristic of the 27 communes in Nha Trang city, had 198,729 residents including 13,952 children less than 5 years of age. An ARI case was defined as any child presenting to KHGH with cough or/and difficulty in breathing. Before study enrollment, informed consent was obtained from parents of children who presented with ARI and lived in the study catchment area. Clinical and demographic information, chest radiographs (CXR), laboratory data, and nasopharyngeal (NP) samples were collected from all enrolled patients. KHGH is the only hospital in Nha Trang, Khanh Hoa province and the only one accessible for residents of the catchment area. Hence for incidence calculations we assume that all children with ARI are eligible to be hospitalized and enrolled into the study and use the population of the catchment area as denominator. Acute respiratory infection patients with normal CXR were categorized as upper respiratory tract infection (URTI). Patients with abnormal CXR were categorized as lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI).",

The outcome was monthly aggregate cases, with resulting coefficients as incidence rate ratios as compared to January. We excluded hospitalizations with more than one virus detected in the nasopharynx to adjust for a potential bias through inclusion of cases who by virtue of being co-infected may otherwise have been asymptomatic (Althouse and Scarpino, 2015). This approach underestimates the true incidence of NP carriage among ARI cases but allows estimation of seasonal patterns that are not biased by other circulating viruses; although co-circulation of bacteria was not accounted for. We assessed the numbers and variety of viruses in ARI hospitalizations using binomial proportion tests for each virus.",

The cross-wavelet transform identifies regions of high power in phase-space and identifies the relative phases of each time series, i.e., in-phase or out-of-phase (Grinsted et al., 2004). The wavelet transform can be thought of a Fourier transformation over time that can identify what is the dominant frequency composing a time series as the signal changes in time. The cross-wavelet transform allows us to compare how two time signals co-vary: we can identify if the presence of a particular frequency at a given time in the time series of hospitalizations corresponds to the presence of that same frequency at the same time in a weather covariate (Chaves and Pascual, 2006). Additionally, we can identify the magnitude by which weather precedes or follows hospitalizations through the phase angle of the two time series. Finally, we can identify the statistical significance of the identified constituent frequencies over time by comparing the observed frequencies to a red-noise process.",

First, while we have nearly 6 years of data, this is still a relatively short period to assess long-term seasonal trends, or to increase confidence in the estimates of seasonal patterns. However, the length of the analyzed time series is similar to other studies examining seasonal trends in viral respiratory pathogens in the tropics (Chew et al., 1998, Hall, 2001), and gives indications for areas of future study. Second, we excluded individuals with more than one virus detected. Examination of changes in the seasonality of other viruses and coinfection over this period is worthy of study and is outside the scope of this paper. Third, this study used hospital-based surveillance, necessarily presenting the most ill children. We take as an assumption that hospitalizations are a fraction of all transmission and severity of illness is not related to weather. Finally, this study examines the influence of weather on viral hospitalizations and does not address other drivers of seasonal patterns of transmission, such as school closures (Fine and Clarkson, 1982), differences in other social behavior such as contact rates (Cook et al., 1990, Dushoff et al., 2004), susceptible recruitment through births (Metcalf et al., 2012), or possible seasonal changes in host immune responses (Dowell et al., 2003). Future work examining these drivers in this setting is necessary.",

For example the timing of influenza peaks in the mid-spring months (April, May, June) would indicate routine vaccination in the winter months would be of biggest impact. Similarly, knowing RSV peaks in the late summer/early fall when RCP is at its lowest may help in limiting unnecessary antibiotic (Laxminarayan and Malani, 2007) or antiviral use (Tanaka et al., 2014). In Vietnam and most of Asia, most antibiotics are acquired from a pharmacist without a formal prescription (Van Nguyen et al., 2013). This fact makes results like those presented here of high importance to public health decision-makers to inform pharmacists of seasonality of respiratory infection etiologies and urge judicious prescribing practices.",
