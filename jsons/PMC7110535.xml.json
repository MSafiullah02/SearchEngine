The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that 1.9 million children die each year as a result of the complications of acute RTIs, mainly pneumonia,1 and 70% of RTI deaths occur in Africa and southeast Asia.2 The major viral agents of RTI include influenza A, B, and C viruses (Flu), respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), parainfluenza virus (PIV), adenovirus (ADV), human metapneumovirus (hMPV), human coronavirus (HCoV), and the newly discovered human bocavirus (HBoV). Flu, RSV, and PIV are often associated with pneumonia, especially in children under 5 years of age and those living in developing countries.3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 In one study of hospitalized children, RSV was identified in 15\u201340% of cases, PIV in 6.8\u20137%, and Flu in 3%.9 ADV, HCoV, and HBoV are associated with a substantial proportion of RTI in infants and young children;7, 10, 11, 12 hMPV has been detected in up to 10% of respiratory specimens.13 RSV and PIV may also contribute substantially to mortality among the elderly, and the annual outbreaks and recurrent infections suggest that RSV and PIV may contribute to the burden of disease throughout life.14, 15\n",

These variations may be due to cultural and socioeconomic factors, geographical or climatic differences, or variations in health care systems. A clear understanding of the local epidemiology of RTI and the identification of risk factors is critical to the successful implementation of a prevention and control program. Southern China is believed to be the origin of some important respiratory viruses, such as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV)16 and influenza virus.17 Southern China has large populations of humans and domestic and wild animals, as well as a large transient population that includes laborers and business people from different provinces of China and from other countries. The mixing of these large regional populations may favor the transmission of respiratory viruses.",

In the present study, among the 180 HBoV-positive specimens, there were 66 (36.67%) co-infections with at least one other respiratory virus. Elderly people have also been reported to be susceptible to HBoV. A single lineage of HBoV was detected among a wide age distribution of patients with acute RTI.

The epidemiology of respiratory viral infection was found to vary tremendously by geographical region. In temperate climates, the prevalence of these viruses is well documented as a cause of yearly winter epidemics of acute lower RTIs.40 This study clearly showed evidence of seven viruses throughout the 3-year study period. The highest rate of infection was in spring, with a peak in February (48.03%), and the lowest rates of infection were in winter, with a nadir in October (23.14%), which may be attributed to the fact that February is the coldest month in southern China. The detection rates for summer and autumn were similar and this is likely due to high humidity and a lack of significant delimitation between summer and autumn.",

The effect may depend upon which viruses co-infect.44 In the present study, 3.39% of specimens had multiple or dual infections, with a predominance of Flu compared to the other co-viruses. However, in the positive specimens, the co-infection rates for HCoV and HBoV were higher than those of other respiratory viruses. The co-infection rates were higher in male patients, inpatients, and patients aged \u226414 years. The rates of co-infection were higher during spring and summer than during autumn and winter. The rates of co-infection were lowest during winter, which corresponded with the overall low detection rates in winter.",
