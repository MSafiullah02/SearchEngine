This implies that tweets containing this word were retrieved, as well as the posts including its hashtag version (#Coronavirus). The 8.98M were gathered from January 21 to February 12, 2020, i.e. 23 days. We selected those dates since, in the first one (21-Feb-2020), there was a boom around the topic on Twitter, where several hashtags related to the coronavirus and the outbreak in China were trending topics [1]. Then, the data collection was closed (12-February-2020) when the World Health Organization (WHO) changed the official name of this disease from \u201cCoronavirus\u201d to \u201cCOVID-19\u201d (link to the official communication).",

When we started to see the quantity of information on Twitter, the code was run as much as possible. This way, the trend in Fig. 1 shows that there was increasing attention on the topic on Twitter.",

If you have further questions about the dataset in Table 1 or you need more information about the raw variable, please contact us.

Tw, this was used for original tweets, when the post did not include any mention; 2. MT, this was created when the user mentioned other users within the tweet; 3. RT: Retweets, this category was used for those tweets which retweet one post and; 4. Re: Replies, this type of tweets were created when one user replied to another one.",

The other databases and analyses provided in this paper are based on the differentiation of tweets by their \u201cType\u201d. By including this variable in different databases (see Table 1), we want to prove that these categories influence a lot the interaction dynamics on Twitter.

The collection process comprised from January 21 to February 12, 2020, i.e. 23 days. We searched for the term \u201cCoronavirus\u201d which included the word itself and its hashtag version (#Coronavirus). It is worth mentioning that the procedure to search tweets only returns data from the past 6-9 days, and it typically can return up to 18,000 Twitter statuses in a single call (see this link). Based on this, we run the process several times, creating a total of 424 files, which summed 17,974,805 records. We eliminated the duplicated ones, and the final number of retained tweets was 8,982,694, which are unique. All the collected data is multilingual since we did not use any kind of restriction about it. The most used languages on the tweets were English (en=56.8%), Spanish (es=19.4%), Portuguese (pt=5.1%), French (fr=4.7%) and, Italian (it=2.19); but in total, the tweets were written up in 65 different languages (Table 2\n).",

In the case of media, we conversely found that a considerable proportion (79%) of the tweets did not contain any kind of media (pictures, gifs, video, etc.). Twitter posts with media were more used in type 1. Tw (Fig. 4\n). Further information can be found in this database, which includes: the number of retweets received in each tweet; in this case, 75.7% of the 3,928,380 tweets did not receive any retweet.
