            "text": "Most viral infections of the nervous system represent serious and potentially life-threatening complications of systemic viral infections. With the possible exception of rabies, viruses are not neurotropic in the literal sense of having a specific affinity for the nervous system. Some viruses frequently invade the nervous system yet seldom cause serious disease; for example, mumps virus may cause meningitis but, even during uncomplicated mumps parotitis, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) changes in over 50% of patients indicate probable nervous system infection. Other viruses, such as herpes simplex virus, rarely infect the central nervous system (CNS), but when they do, they often cause fatal disease. Thus, both mumps and herpes simplex viruses are regarded as neurotropic; mumps is highly neuroinvasive but has limited neurovirulence; herpes simplex has low neuroinvasiveness but is highly neurovirulent. Such variations are dependent on the structural and functional determinates of nervous system invasion, on the particular neural cells that specific viruses infect, on the effect of this infection on the host cells, and on the immune response or immunopathologic responses to the infection. Several terms are defined as follows:\u2022Neurotropic: able to infect neural cells.\u2022Neuronotropic: able to infect neurons in contrast to other nervous system cells.\u2022Neuroinvasive: able to enter the nervous system.\u2022Neurovirulent: able to cause neurologic disease.\n",

The blood\u2013brain barrier and the compact structure of the brain and cord pose formidable barriers to the entry or dissemination of viruses within the nervous system. Yet, the multitude of dense dendritic connections among neurons provide a unique environment for cell-to-cell spread of pathogens. Furthermore, neurons are unique cells with high metabolic rates, intense membrane specialization, and no regenerative capacity. The same barriers that exclude viruses also limit access of immunocompetent cells and antibodies, and the nervous system lacks an intrinsic lymphatic system and has a paucity of phagocytic cells. Thus, the barriers that inhibit virus invasion also deter viral clearance. Therefore, many persistent infections involve the CNS.",

In the choroid plexus, the blood\u2013CSF barrier is structurally different. The capillaries of the plexus are fenestrated, lack a basement membrane, and are surrounded by a loose stroma. Dyes and particles readily pass into the choroid plexus but are prevented from entering the CSF by tight junctions located at the apices of the secretory epithelial cells of the choroid plexus.

The first experimental studies of viral invasion employed rabies, herpes simplex, or polioviruses, all of which, under experimental circumstances, can penetrate the nervous system along peripheral nerves. The precise mechanisms of neural spread remained a mystery for many years, since it was thought that the axoplasm slowly oozed in an anterograde direction. It was proposed that virus might move in perivascular lymphatics, by ascending infection of the supportive cells within the peripheral nerve, or even by replication in axons, a speculation that is now untenable because of the observed lack of ribosomes or protein synthesis within axons. In the 1960s active anterograde and retrograde axon transport systems were found. Viruses or other particles can be taken up in vesicles at the nerve terminals and transported to the cell body of the sensory or motor neuron (Figure 1\n). This neural route of entry is important in primary viral infections such as rabies and possibly poliomyelitis. Retrograde transport also moves herpes simplex and varicella-zoster viruses from mucous membranes or skin into sensory ganglia at the time of primary infection. Subsequently, anterograde transport carries the reactivated virus from the ganglia to the periphery during exacerbations. Anterograde transport of herpes simplex virus by nerves innervating the dura from the trigeminal ganglia may explain the unique temporal lobe localization of herpes simplex virus encephalitis.",

In the olfactory mucosa, neural fibers provide a unique pathway; the apical processes of receptor cells extend beyond the free surface of the epithelium as olfactory rods and the central processes synapse in the olfactory bulb. These are the only nerve cells with processes that link the CNS and ambient environment. Indeed, some colloidal particles placed on the olfactory mucosa can be found in the olfactory bulbs within 1 h. Experimental studies show that viruses can enter through this route, and this may occur in some aerosol infections in humans such as laboratory accidents or rabies virus infections in bat-infested caves. Also, the olfactory pathway has been postulated as a possible route of herpes simplex virus entry into the nervous system as an alternative explanation for the orbital\u2013frontal and medial\u2013temporal lobe localization of herpetic encephalitis. Nevertheless, despite the apparent ease of spread along this route, it appears to be a rare route of natural infection.",

This belief was based in part on the fact that viruses experimentally inoculated directly into brain cause disease after a brief inoculation period, whereas the incubation period after intravenous inoculation is longer and comparable to that following cutaneous or peritoneal inoculation. The reason for this delay in infection is that virus in the blood is rapidly removed by the reticuloendothelial system; therefore, intravenous inoculation is, in fact, an inoculation primarily of the Kupffer cells of the liver and other reticuloendothelial cells. Therefore, virus must establish a nidus of peripheral replication that can effectively seed a viremia of sufficient magnitude and duration to allow invasion across the blood\u2013brain barrier (Figure 2\n). Thus, some viruses grow in lymphatics and seed into the blood directly via the thoracic duct, others grow in vascular epithelial cells, and others replicate in highly vascular tissue such as muscle.",

Entry in infected leukocytes is a theoretical possibility but leukocyte traffic into the nervous system is limited, although trauma or inflammation due to other causes may predispose the nervous system to infection with viruses that infect white blood cells. Although there are areas of increased blood\u2013brain barrier permeability, no viral infection has been shown to infect these areas selectively. Other viruses, such as mumps virus, grow in choroid plexus epithelium and seed into CSF. Thus, the clearance of particles by the reticuloendothelial system, barriers of nonsusceptible extraneural cells, production of interferon and other nonspecific inhibitors, and the physical barriers of the nervous system itself probably explain why viral infections of the brain are rare, even though systemic infections with the potential pathogens are very common.",

Conversely, the compact neuropil may facilitate the contiguous cell-to-cell spread of viruses.

A presumed autoimmune disorder occasionally causes a demyelinating peripheral neuropathy (Guillian\u2013Barre syndrome); acute meningitis is occasionally seen at the time of seroconversion or during early asymptomatic infection. An asymptomatic pleocytosis is often found. Therefore, the virus is, at this stage, not highly neurovirulent.

The pathogenesis of these complications is unknown, but they are thought to be due to some viral protein or lymphokine incited by the virus because of the relative paucity of the virus in the nervous system and its localization to the microglial and macrophage populations.",

            "text": "Tropical spastic paraparesis complicating human T-cell leukemia virus type 1 infections is a recently recognized slow nervous system infection. Less than 1% of the patients infected with this virus develop either acute T-cell leukemia or neurological disease. Since many of those infected are infected by breast milk and the onset of tropical spastic paraparesis is usually in the fourth or fifth decade of life, the incubation period is extraordinarily long. A subacute disease develops with progressive paralysis of the lower extremities associated with impotence, incontinence, and sensory symptoms, but usually minimal sensory findings. Disease progresses slowly until the patients are wheelchair bound, but the disorder remains primarily at the level of the thoracic spinal cord. The involvement of the upper extremities is minimal with hyperreflexia but usually good function, and there is usually little, if any, indication of cerebral involvement. Early pathology found in a biopsy of the spinal cord in a single case showed vasculitis. In late cases, hyalinization of vessels with necrosis and demyelination of spinal cord is found, and findings are most prominent in the thoracic cord. Whether virus replicates in any cells other than T lymphocytes is unknown. These observations lead to the questions of why less than 1:100 who are infected develop disease; why the incubation period is as long as 40 years; why the disease localizes to the thoracic spinal cord; and why over years the disease becomes relatively quiescent despite the fact that there is ongoing high levels of intrathecal antibody synthesis, suggesting that there is still antigenic stimulation by virus within the nervous system.",
