Influenza virus has only one species in it, which is called influenza A virus. These influenza viruses occur naturally among birds. Wild birds worldwide carry these viruses in their intestine but usually do not get sick from them. However, avian influenza is very contagious among birds and can make some domesticated birds including chickens, ducks and turkeys very sick and kill them [20], [24], [30], [43]. Infected birds shed influenza viruses from their saliva, nasal secretions, etc. Susceptible birds become infected when they come in contact with the contaminated surfaces. Domesticated birds may become infected with avian influenza viruses through direct contact with infected waterfowl or other infected poultry [24], [28], [38] or through contact with surfaces (such as dirt or cages) or materials (such as water or food) that have been contaminated with the virus [1], [15], [39], [45], [49].",

Between April and June 2005, a large number of wild water birds at Qinghai Lake in western China perished after being infected by the virus. During, July\u2013August 2005, outbreaks involving the virus were reported from Mongolia, Siberia and Kazakhstan. The virus reached Turkey, Croatia, Romania and Greece by October 2005. Ukraine reported outbreaks in November 2005. The virus was infecting chicken and humans in northern Iraq by January 2006. In early February 2006, Nigeria became the first African nation to report the bird flu virus, with an outbreak at a large commercial poultry farm. In February 2006, many European countries, Egypt and Iran found wild birds infected with H5N1 virus [12], [14], [15], [23], [26], [40], [42].",

Similar case again happened in Hong Kong in 1997\u20131998 [12], [15], [38], [39], [42]. Therefore rapid and effective measures must be taken to stop the spread of epidemics. The most effective measures to prevent the transmission of bird flu are rapid destruction of all infected or exposed birds, proper disposal of carcasses and excrement, the quarantining and rigorous disinfectioning of farms and timely use of vaccine [4], [25], [35], [36], [50].

Influenza virus type A is the most significant epidemiologically and the most interesting from an ecological and evolutionary stand point, because it is found in a wide variety of bird and mammal species [9], [41] and can undergo major shifts in immunological properties. Type B is largely confined to humans and very little is known about type C. Type A virus is responsible for causing bird flu, which was first found in Italy in 1878. Type A virus is further divided into subtypes based on differences in membrane proteins HA and NA, which are the most important targets for the immune system. The notation HhNn is used to refer to the subtype comprising the hth discovered HA proteins and the nth discovered NA protein. The subtype H5N1 virus of type A virus is the main cause of the bird flu [12], [15], [23], [31], [42]. Subtype is further divided into strains; each genetically distinct virus isolated is usually considered to be a separate strain [11], [33].",

Contaminated equipments, vehicles, food, cages and clothing like shoes can carry the viruses from farm to farm. Some evidence suggests that flies can also act as mechanical vectors [18]. Wet markets where live birds are sold under crowded and sometimes unsanitary conditions can be another source of spread. These constitute the main cause of the former transmission. Export and import of poultry products are the main cause of the latter transmission, since they can carry the viruses for long distances freely when artificial factors are prevented. Migratory birds can also be a cause of transmission between the countries [5], [27]. Efforts have been made on the study of avian influenza and most of the recent papers focus on topics such as the route of transmission, physiological and biological properties, etc. The bird flu virus of low pathogenicity can mutate into highly pathogenic one after a short time; the virus is sensitive to temperature change (it was found that the virus survives for shorter time at a higher temperature). This kind of influenza is able to transmit to humans under some circumstances (http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs277/en/) [6], [7], [21], [44], [47], [52]; however, no sufficient and clear evidences of human-to-human transmission have been found up to now [21].",

On the second day bird flu hit four nations of Southeast Asia, Central Asia and Europe namely Indonesia, Iran, Austria and Germany. On the third day, outbreaks took place in two European countries, Hungary and Italy. On Thursday, new cases of bird flu were found in three European and African countries, Switzerland, Denmark and Egypt.

Other social and natural factors also play an important role in the transmission of infection, for example, the control measures and the change in temperature. The source of infection that led to the outbreak is not clear. In some researcher's view migratory birds are thought to be carrying the virus [5], [27]. If migratory birds had brought the virus one would have expected outbreaks well before February as bird's migrations were over by around November. So we consider in our problem the source of outbreaks of bird flu to be the transportation of infected poultry as globalization has turned the chicken into the world's number one migratory bird species. We have assumed that it is mainly the human activities of commerce and trade that this epidemic has spread. For implementing this we have considered the concerns expressed by scientists from Max Plank Institute for Dynamics and Self Organization, Germany [19]. They have recognized the statistical characteristics of human travel independent of the means of transportation people use for the modeling of the spread of epidemics as published in the article [19].",

            "text": "In this section, we have discussed the methodology that we have used for simulation experiments. We first discuss, one by one the various parameters taken in our model. Also we explain, how we have computed these parameters and finally how we have given the methodology used to predict a new outbreak with the help of a flowchart suggested by Li et al. [21].\u2022In our model, we have used the random float number R which we have generated in our program by using random number generator. Why do we need R in our model? As we know the outbreak of bird flu is a probabilistic instance and not a deterministic one, even though f(r), D(n), N(n) contribute much to P(n,r), we cannot definitely assure that there will be a certain outbreak of bird flu in a region but can only say that there is enormous possibility or danger for an outbreak to take place. So an additional random parameter R is introduced to reflect the uncertainty.\u2022\nD(n) denotes the lifetime of the virus of bird flu on the nth day. As a matter of fact we only have the data of survival duration of the virus obtained from the website (http://www.who.int/asr/don/2004_02_18/en/). The H5N1 virus can survive at cool temperatures in contaminated manure for at least three months; in water, the virus can survive for up to 30 days at 0\u2218C; about four days at 22\u2218C; about 3 hours at 56\u2218C and only 30 min at 60\u2218C\n[21]. By means of fitting the above data by curve fitting method, we obtained an approximate formula as follows:(2)D(t)=e3.4-0.0915t1.1,where t represents the air temperature.In our simulation, we studied the epidemic for one week till it reached India, that is for a short duration. Hence the temperature change may be taken as a linear approximation regarding the epidemic duration, that is, (3)t(n)=t1+t2n,in which t1 and t2 are two constants that can be determined by fitting the average temperature of the various countries through which the virus reached India. In this model t1=0.2 and t2=2.2286 (started on February 13, 2006). So the relation between the lifetime of the virus and the epidemic duration shall be a compound form of (2) and (3) as(4)D(n)=e3.4-0.0915(0.2+2.2286n)1.1.\n\u2022\nI(n) stands for the resistibility of poultry on the nth day. Obviously the resistibility will increase with the artificial interventions and the control measures. We assume the increase abides by law similar to Sigmoid function 1/(1+e-x). Thus I(n) assumes the following form:(5)I(n)=B1+(B-1)e-n/C.\n\n Apparently, this is a modified sigmoid form. When n=0, I(0)=1, and when n=\u221e, I(n)=B; which indicates the resistibility is impossible to approach a very big number [21].\u2022\nf(r) is the distribution of the probability that infected poultry products are transported a distance r. The basic idea for taking the above mentioned form of f(r) stems from Howlett [19]. The researchers at Max Planck Institute for Dynamics and Self Organization have used the dispersal of dollar bills within the United States as a proxy measurement of human movement (since people cannot be tracked while banknotes travel with the people).\n They analyzed the data on the peregrinations of more than half-a-million US dollar bills recorded over a five-year period on an online bill-backing system (http://www.wheresgeorge.com) and give a simple model that only depends upon two parameters. Since the poultry products are also imported and exported very frequently, to various countries, we can assume its transport to be very similar to the human movement. So the probability that f(r)=r-(1+\u03b2)infected poultry product is transported from the farm may assume a distance r, for r larger than 10 km with \u03b2 close to 0.6.This distribution behaves like a power law. This function decreases as r grows larger, meaning that transportation of poultry over a long distance is less common than short ones. However, it does not decrease as fast as other common probability distributions, which means that transportation over long distances are still common enough to have a significant effect. Poultry products make many short journeys, but the occasional long haul ensures that they disperse widely.\u2022A threshold value S is necessary which acts as a criterion: when P(n,r) is greater than S there will be an outbreak; otherwise not. However, how to determine the possible number of outbreaks per day denoted by K(n)? Intuitively, K(n) shall be in direct proportion to N(n); however, since only the nearest several outbreaks have notable contribution to the probability of a new outbreak a number of distant outbreaks contribute little, so dependent relation of K(n) upon N(n) is of the form [21]\n(6)K(n)=AN(n)b,where A\u2a7e1 and 0<b\u2aa11, that is, K(n) increases slowly with the augment of N(n).\n",

Parameter A controls the initial possible number of outbreaks the epidemic may abort if A is too small and overflow if A is large. So there shall be a proper intermediate value for A. b denotes the general trend of the outbreaks, the total number of outbreaks will grow too rapidly to be practical if b is a big number and may be too flat if b is too small. B determines the ultimate resistibility, which reflects the final degree of stringency of artificial interventions; the greater B is the more stringent the interventions are.
