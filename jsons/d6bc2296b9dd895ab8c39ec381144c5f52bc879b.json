This study examines effects of geriatric-specific variables on postoperative outcomes in patients undergoing elective major abdominal operations. Methods Patients included in the ACS NSQIP pilot Geriatric Surgery Research File program who underwent elective pancreatic, liver, and colorectal operations between 2014 and 2016 were examined. Multivariable analyses were performed to evaluate associations between patient-specific geriatric variables and risk of death, morbidity, readmission, and discharge destination. Results A total of 4165 patients were included. Patients C85 years were more likely to die, experience postoperative morbidity, and be discharged to a facility (all p B 0.039) than younger patients. Preoperatively, patients C85 years were more likely to use a mobility aid, have a prior fall, have consent signed by a surrogate, and to live alone at home prior to operation (all p \\ 0.001). After adjustment for ACS NSQIP-estimated probabilities of morbidity or mortality, no geriatric-specific preoperative risk factors were significantly associated with increased risk of death or complications in any age group (all p [ 0.055). Patients 75-84 and C85 years were more likely to be discharged to facility (OR 2.33 and 4.75, respectively, both p \\ 0.001) compared to patients 65-74 years. All geriatric-specific variables: use of mobility aid, living alone, consent signed by a surrogate, and fall history, were significantly associated with discharge to a facility (all p B 0.001). Conclusions After adjusting for comorbid conditions, geriatric-specific variables are not associated with postoperative mortality and morbidity among elderly patients; however, geriatric-specific variables are significantly associated with discharge to a facility.",

The complexity of these tools which include multiple components to each assessment system limits their clinical applicability and ability to translate into daily practice [2, 5] . Age has been independently associated with operative morbidity and mortality in elderly patients [3, 6] . Frailty has also been associated with perioperative fitness, outcomes, and likely discharge destination [4, 5, 8] . However, many accepted measurements of frailty are also complex [9] . Other proposed variables associated with outcomes in the elderly include do-not-resuscitate status, sarcopenia, and preoperative hemoglobin [4, 5] .",

Though frailty as a global concept has emerged as a useful predictor of perioperative complications, the most appropriate variables for geriatricspecific risk stratification remain unclear [2, 4, 8] . In 2014, the ACS NSQIP Geriatric Surgery Pilot program began collecting geriatric-specific risk factors, such as cognition, decision making, function, and mobility. Collecting and analyzing data within these new categories allows for targeted investigation of unique risks and outcomes among elderly patients [11] . In this study, we aim to examine the association between patient-specific geriatric variables on short-term postoperative outcomes including mortality, morbidity, readmission, and the impact on discharge destination among patients selected for elective major abdominal operations.",

Four separate multivariable models were developed to test the associations between a priori determined relevant covariates and primary and secondary outcome measures.

Patients who died were excluded from the readmission and discharge destination multivariable models. All four geriatricspecific GSFR variables were included in each of the multivariable models.

ACS NSQIP probabilities of mortality and morbidity were the only statistically significant variables associated with postoperative death and complications. These probabilities were calculated from the clinically meaningful comorbid factors included in the ACS NSQIP calculator and available for preoperative risk estimation for any individual patient. The specific number and type of variables included fluctuate year to year and differ between probability of morbidity and probability of mortality variables. For example, the 2015 mortality model was derived from 404,564 patient records (1.15% 30-day NSQIP-defined mortality) and [14] . While some variables differ by year, such as mortality and morbidity estimates, the ACS NSQIP surgical risk calculator includes well-known variables such as age, procedure CPT, ASA class, preoperative functional status, body mass index, ascites, albumin, creatinine, and others enumerated in risk calculator and defined in ACS NSQIP Semiannual Reports. As such, these estimated probabilities already account for clinically significant and statistically appropriate patient-specific comorbid conditions in the entire ACS NSQIP patient cohort. After adjusting for these clinically relevant covariates, the four additional GSFR geriatricspecific variables were not associated with postoperative outcomes with exception of discharge destination. Importantly, patient's functional status (defined in ACS NSQIP as independent, partially dependent, and totally dependent) is already included in the ACS NSQIP-estimated probability of mortality and estimated probability of morbidity variables. At baseline condition, the estimated probabilities adjust for patients underlying functional status, arguably one of the global summary estimates for increasing age and frailty [15] [16] [17] .",
