Epidemiological data from the laboratory can be used for prescribing prophylactic treatments for at risk patients [6,7], or for alerting to new or seasonal spread of pathogens [2].",

These two Influenza A equivocal samples were considered to be positive by FA-RP. All the \u201cequivocal\u201d samples had Ct-values of >30.

Among the FDA-approved platforms, the performance of the FA-RP, Luminex xTAG RVP, Luminex xTAG RVP fast, and eSensor RVP have been investigated [3]. Sensitivities ranged from 84.4% (Luminex xTAG RVP fast) to 98.3% (eSensor RVP), while specificities were high for all assays (>99%) [3]. FA-RP had an overall sensitivity of 84.5%, with substantially lower sensitivity noted for detection of adenovirus [3].There are comparatively fewer evaluations of AnyplexII RV16, but in a comparative study in 2013, the assay was reported to have an overall sensitivity of 95.2% [12].",

In a comparison study between AnyplexII RV16, Seeplex RV15 (Seegene), and xTAG RVP, the overall sensitivity of RV16 was better than that of xTAG RVP [12]. However, improvement of the sensitivity for rhinovirus was required [12]. In this study, FA-RP and AnyplexII RV16 had the same sensitivity (96.2%) for rhinovirus/enterovirus, better than that for Argene (92.6%). Hence, the lack of sensitivity towards rhinovirus previously reported was not observed in this study. The sensitivity of FA-RP to adenovirus had been a concern because the original version (v1.6) of this kit was not able to detect several ADV serotypes [13]. In the modified version (v1.7), the sensitivity improved from 66.6% to 90.5% in retrospective studies, and 42.7% to 83.3% in prospective studies [13]. However, there was still one serotype (serotype 31) that remained undetected in v1.7 and the performance for adenovirus testing was still lower when compared to an in-house assay [14]. In this study, the sensitivity of FA-RP (v1.7) for ADV was 92.3%, comparable to that reported earlier [13].",

In contrast, respiratory aspirates were considered acceptable samples for Argene and AnyplexII RV16, both of which are CE-IVD. Two previous studies evaluating the FA-RP on a large number of bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) specimens supported the utility of respiratory aspirates for FA-RP [15,16]. In this study, there was no final run-QC failure associated with the use of respiratory aspirates on the FA-RP. Furthermore, there was no significant difference in the percentage of matches (comparing FA-RP with composite gold standard) between UTM and ETT sample types. Hence, this and earlier studies suggest that respiratory aspirates are acceptable sample types for FA-RP.",

Similarly, more Influenza A \u201cequivocal\u201d and \u201cno-subtype\u201d samples will be desirable. Similarly, most of the respiratory aspirates were ETT, while sputum and BAL were poorly represented or not represented at all. There were only one each of PIV4, Coronavirus 229E, and 3-targets positive samples. Hence, these categories were not well represented. Another shortcoming was the use of \u201cpositive by at least two platforms\u201d as the reference result for calculating sensitivity and specificity. Hence, an assay with greater sensitivity than all other assays tested would result in reduced specificity. Finally, all the platforms compared herein were multiplexed assays. The Argene duplex-assays were the closest to conventional qPCR assays. Ideally, each target should be compared with individual qPCR assays, but this was not practical due to the lack of laboratory developed tests (LDTs) for every target, as well as financial constraints.",

AnyplexII and Argene are thus of higher throughput and geared towards batched testing, while the low complexity Filmarray is more suited for on-demand analysis and requires minimum hands-on time. Since the FilmArray performed comparably to AnyplexII, the laboratory\u2019s required turnover and workflow considerations would be major determinants in the selection of a platform for screening respiratory agents. It should also be noted that the FilmArray also had the highest reagent costs among these automated platforms [3].",
