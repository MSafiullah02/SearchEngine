Thus, it is often not feasible to decontaminate respirators after each use. Rather, potentially contaminated N95 respirators may be reused multiple times with once daily or even less frequent decontamination.",

Short cycles of ultraviolet-C (UV-C) light could be used, but efficacy may be limited against organisms associated with irregular, soft surfaces such as respirators. 3 Steam treatment also has the potential to rapidly reduce non-spore-forming organisms. 1, 4 We previously reported that a 13-15 minute steam treatment was effective for decontamination of face masks and N95 respirators. 4 Here, we investigated the efficacy of shorter steam treatments that could potentially allow decontamination between each use.",

[3] [4] Ten-\u03bcL aliquots containing ~10 6 colony-forming units (CFU) or plaque-forming units (PFU) of the test organisms suspended in 8% simulated mucus were inoculated onto 1-cm 2 areas on both the outer or inner surfaces of the respirators and face masks. [3] [4] The inoculated masks and respirators were subjected to 100\u2103 steam treatments of 2, 10, or 30 seconds by placing them inside a steamer (Aroma; San Diego, CA) for the specified time during the steam cycle. After treatment, the inoculated sections were cut out and processed to quantify viable organisms. [3] [4] All tests were performed in triplicate. Log 10 reductions were calculated in comparison to untreated controls. A reduction of 3-log 10 or greater was considered effective for decontamination. [3] [4] [5] To assess the impact on respirator performance, qualitative and quantitative (Portacount Respirator Fit Tester, TSI Incorporated, Shoreview, MN) fit testing was performed before and after N95 respirators were subjected to 20 30-second steam treatments.",

After steam treatment, the respirators were slightly damp to touch, but this resolved within 5 minutes at room temperature or within 2 minutes when placed in a dry oven at 70\u00baC. 4 All 30 used medical procedure masks cultured were contaminated with bacteria with an average of 2.4 log 10 CFU recovered, predominantly Streptococcus species and coagulasenegative staphylococci.

The reductions in bacteriophage MS2 met the current FDA Enforcement Policy for Face Masks and Respirators of a >3 log 10 reduction of viruses, but the requirement for a >6 log 10 inactivation of bacterial spores was not met. 5 Nevertheless, steam treatment deserves further investigation because the short treatment cycles and ease of use could allow for rapid decontamination of respirators or face masks at the point-of-care between each use. Twenty cycles of steam treatment did not adversely affect fit testing performance, consistent with previous reports that short cycles of steam treatment may have minimal effect on N95 filtration and fit performance. 1,4 Further work is needed to assess the impact of short cycles of steam treatment on filtration efficiency and to develop technologies that could provide steam treatments for respirators and face masks in healthcare settings.",
