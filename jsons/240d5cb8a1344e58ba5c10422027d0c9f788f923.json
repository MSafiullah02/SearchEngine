The assay uses a recombinant strain of Escherichia coli exp~ing both the protease and a tetracycline resistance-conferring protein modified to contain the minimal protease cleavage site. Cultures growing in microtiter plates containing tetracycline are treated with potential inhibitors and simultaneously monitored for change in growth over time using an oxygen probe. Most of the cultures, not containing an inhibitor of the 3C protease, show reduced growth due to cleavage of the essential gene product; normal growth is seen only in the infrequent culture that contains an inhibitor. In the present example, we have used the tetA gene of plasmid pACYC184 as the modified gene. The system has been validated using inhibitors of protease 3C, and has been used to identify three new inhibitors of the enzyme, active in the micromolar range.",

However, since growth under the conditions used quickly becomes oxygen-limited, growth rate was determined by measuring the change in fluorescence emission of an oxygenquenched ruthenium complex' 6 applied to the floor of the microtiter wells. As oxygen in the medium is depleted by growing cells, fluorescence increases to a maximum level determined by the concentration of the indicator. The addition of arabinose caused protease induction and reduced cellular oxygen uptake due to the intracellular accumulation of inhibitory levels of tetracycline. Since the microtiter trays are incubated unsealed, a reduction in oxygen uptake allows air to diffuse into the growth medium and quench the fluorescence probe causing the gradual decrease in fluorescence (closed triangles, Fig. 4 ). The growth (respiration) of uninduced strain OM86 (DH5adpOM98, pOM99) caused an increase in fluorescence by rapidly depleting available oxygen during the first hour of growth (open squares, Fig. 5 ). In the presence of arabinose, however, the growth rate was decreased, reflected by a much slower depletion of oxygen from the culture medium (closed symbols, Fig. 5 ). Under these conditions, the protease 3C synthesized is apparently able to cleave the tetracycline resistance protein, resulting in inhibition of growth by the antibiotic. Addition of the target oligopeptide (EVLFQGPVY) to the growth medium reversed the growth inhibition , presumably by competing with the target protein for proteolysis (triangles, F ig. 5). A control peptide of similar size (eight residues) had no effect on growth (data not shown). Oligopeptide added at O and 90 minutes produced a burst of growth followed by a decline during subsequent 30 minute periods. Thus the peptide can readily compete with the TetA 3 c protein allowing growth in tetracycline-containing medium. As the intracellular pool of the target peptide diminishes, however, \u2022 hydrolysis ofTetA 3 c increases and the cells again become sensitive to tetracycline.",

The addition of arabinose to the growth medium induces expression of the 3C protease, which results in the inactivation of cellular TetA 3 c protein, rendering the cells sensitive to tetracycline. Adding a protease inhibitor to the growth medium will reestablish tetracycline resistance and pennit growth if ( l) the inhibitor has sufficient activity against protease 3C that TetA:,c cleavage will be blocked, (2) a sufficient amount can traverse the cytoplasmic membrane, and (3) it is not itself toxic to the cell. Cells growing in the presence of tetracycline therefore die following the addition of arabinose, unless rescued by the presence of an inhibitor of the 3C protease. In addition to the obvious need for a protease inhibitor to have a high level of activity against its target, it must also possess many other characteristics to be therapeutically useful. Chief among these are the ability to reach the target molecule within the cell and a lack of cellular toxicity. Since bacterial and human cells share many features, we reason that any candidate compound that is either unable to traverse a cell membrane, or shows initial toxicity, should be eliminated in a first screen. Although porin mutants of E. coli are available wherein the cell membrane presents less of a barrier than in wild-type cells, such strains were less favored, along with the naturally more penneable Gram positive species, due to an excessive rate of positive sample presentation (data not shown).",

Cells were incubated in microtiter trays coated with the Ollygen responsive indicator 4,7-diphenyl-1,10-phenanthroline ruthenium (II) chloride . The oxygen-quenched fluorescence probe was synthesized from phenanthroline and ruthenium chloride by heating under reflul\\ for 48 hrs.

Samples were tested at approximately 0 .1 \u00b5.g / well (0.5 \u00b5g/ml) and positives were obtained at a rate of 0.1 % .
