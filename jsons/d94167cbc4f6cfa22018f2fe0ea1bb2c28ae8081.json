Previous studies have found that inactivation at 56\u00b0C for 30 min could result in a decreased detectable amount and increased Ct values. In particular, diluted weak positive samples may become false negatives in SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR detection [17] . However, our study has shown that the virus loads measured in the heat-inactivated samples were consistent with those in the unheat-inactivated ones, with sufficient amounts of RNA preserved for downstream rRT-PCR testing, which concurs with the conclusions of Wilber Sabiiti et al. and Boris Pastori et al [16] [17] [18] . The RNA preservation may be due to the preservation solution, which contains guanidine isothiocyanate, sodium dodecylsarcosine, and dithiothreitol. This suggested that the presence of the preservation solution can effectively protect the integrity of the viral nucleic acid, thereby increasing the proportion of detectable nucleic acids. And It may also be that we used the original samples rather than the diluted samples.",

In fact, studies have suggested that the sample cells shall die and rupture in the event of relatively high temperature and long durations, leading to the release of a large number of cell nucleases, and then a large amount of RNA degradation, which may contribute to false negatives in nucleic acid detection. We hypothesize that heating at 100\u2103 for 30 min or 60 min lyse a large number of cells, and expose RNA to RNases present in the samples, and the duration is also a key factor.",

As shown in table 1, The Ct values of ORF1a/b from 14 nasopharyngeal swab samples were 25.63-34.86, and the Ct values of the heat inactivated samples were similar to the non-inactivated samples. The average Ct values difference between inactivated samples at 56\u2103 for 30min and noninactivated samples is -0.7175 to 1.947, 0.102 to 2.806 between inactivated samples at 56\u2103 for 60min and non-inactivated samples, 0.0145 to 2.0435 between inactivated samples at 60\u2103 for 30min and non-inactivated samples, -0.3735 to 2.489, between inactivated samples at 60\u2103 for 60min and non-inactivated samples, -1.321 to 2.254 between inactivated samples at 100\u2103 for 10min and non-inactivated samples. On basis of which, only the Ct values of sample 2 and 4 were less than the non-inactivated ones, while others were more than the non-inactivated ones, i.e, all Ct values of samples at 56\u2103 for 60mins and 60\u2103 for 30mins were more than the non-inactivated ones. Notwithstanding the foregoing, all heat inactivated samples were tested positive. As shown in table 2, The Ct values of N of 14 nasopharyngeal swab samples were 24.46-35.43, and the Ct values of the heat-inactivated samples were approximate to the non-inactivated samples. The average Ct values difference between the inactivated samples at 56\u2103 for 30min and the non-inactivated samples is -0.359 to 2.019, -0.3385 to 2.088 between the inactivated samples at 56\u2103 for 60min and the noninactivated samples, -0.646 to 1.7505 between the inactivated samples at 60\u2103 for All rights reserved.
