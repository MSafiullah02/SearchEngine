Although there was no licenced Ebola vaccine available, approximately fifteen different vaccines were in preclinical development, including DNA vaccines, virus-like particles and viral vector [3]. Levine et al. [4] described how these candidates had largely been developed as part of the bioterrorism preparedness programme, BioShield, in the United States. Due to the relatively low geographic prevalence of infection there was a limited market and thus a poor case for industry to develop a vaccine for commercial purposes. However, concerns over the potential use of Ebolavirus as a bioterrorism agent resulted in a number of stockpiled sources that had undergone testing in animal models [4].",

Several vaccines were deployed as part of the international response [5] although this outbreak also served to highlight the necessity of effective public health systems and infrastructure, and community engagement in order to mitigate disease spread through cultural or social practices [6]. In the case of Ebola, it was fortuitous that several candidate vaccines were already in development and immense global efforts made the vaccine available. However, this also conspicuously highlighted that nations around the world need to be better prepared for outbreaks of all infectious diseases, particularly those with the potential for high levels of morbidity and mortality, and that other measures to control infection spread should also be implemented [7].",

The group created a visual process mapping tool to better understand the potentially rate-limiting bottlenecks associated in moving a vaccine candidate from discovery through to development and early Phase clinical trials; then into clinical manufacture and Phase 3 trials. The primary purpose of the tool was to act as a visual aid for early discovery and development scientists, highlighting the major steps required to fully develop any experimental vaccine. The secondary, and crucial purpose of the tool, was to identify any generic bottlenecks that may slow down development. Identifying such strategic limitations may identify corrective actions, that may in turn help to overcome potential delays or setbacks when expediting vaccine development during epidemics. Actions could be taken by policy makers to correct for limitations in regulation, funders to identify limits in scientific knowledge that could be corrected with appropriate investment, and for government and trans-national organisations to consider local and global response. Though the genesis of this tool was considered in the context of epidemic preparedness, the tool itself is sufficiently far-reaching that it can be utilized by the wider vaccine community. Considering the global nature of vaccines, it is important to understand the interdependencies that exist between discovery, development and manufacture. This tool gives scientists vision of the considerations that will need to be made along the development process. In taking a much more holistic approach to vaccine development it is hoped that this can support other international such as the Global Vaccine Action Plan [8], which relies on the continued supply of vaccines to meet immunization targets. Thus, the tool serves multiple users and purposes, and we report on its main findings in this paper.",

Several subgroups were convened to discuss these areas; membership was drawn from the UKVN, a core group of specialists that made up WG3 and further expertise consulted according to need. Process schematics were made, and members undertook interactive discussions to add in, remove, and reorganise steps. The UKVN Secretariat led on organising a series of iterative workshops that repeated this process several times; each time a skills gap analysis was carried out to ensure appropriate expertise was representing different disease/vaccine interests, and from across the vaccine sector from academic and industry discovery, development, regulation, manufacturing and clinical trials. The repeated process of interactive mapping, refinement of core documents, and presentation of progress back to the subgroups stimulated dialogue on the map as a whole.

WG3 agreed that the significance of the TPP and the relevance to even the earliest exploratory basic science work, should not be underestimated, therefore prominently placing the TPP, aimed to engage early discovery scientists to consider what the end product is, and how the choices made during pre-clinical discovery and development influence them. The consensus opinion within the working group was that the TPP should be seen as a strategic planning document that should be utilised as a benchmark as data emerges. During normal development, this is a tool for novel vaccine creation. However, in an outbreak situation, the TPP acts as an essential checklist under accelerated timescales. It is worth noting that that the importance of TPPs is widely shared and recent work by the WHO and CEPI includes creating standard TPPs for priority pathogens.",

At this stage manufacturers must address if the vaccine can in fact be manufactured in a scalable process. There is no generic manufacturing process for vaccines, thus almost all processes are designed from the bottom up, which adds costs and delays to any future intervention plan. Platform manufacturing technologies are a method to overcome this issue by streamlining manufacturing with generic operations into which your selected antigen(s) can be introduced. Viral vectors are one such platform technology that was effectively employed during the Ebola outbreak [9], [10]. Looking more broadly, recombinant sub-unit vaccine technologies are another platform technology that could be used in other epidemics and has been successfully demonstrated in context of influenza vaccines [11]. Other advances in nucleic acid based vaccines, such as DNA and RNA, offer a future, though as yet unrealised potential, for generic manufacturing and release testing of vaccines. The determination of the range of physical, chemical, biological, or microbiological properties that ensure the quality of the desired product, is described as \u2018Critical Quality Attributes\u2019 (CQA) and requires well-defined analytics which in the long term can reduce Quality Control (QC) costs. Finding suitable analytics that can resolve complex antigen structure, increase understanding of degradation pathways and formulation needs is a continuing bottleneck.

Consequently, this may involve obtaining separate approvals, modifications to the trial site, modified procedures for sterilising, administering and disposing, separate storage facilities and special training of staff to handle GMOs. Overall, this whole area would benefit a revision of regulations and derogating the use of common vaccine vectors in separate regulations from the currently applicable GMO guidance would have a substantial beneficial impact in speeding up approvals.",

Antigen identification bottlenecks are also overcome, through straightforward selection of the spike protein (the major external antigen of coronaviruses) which elicits neutralising antibodies to the receptor binding domain [15]. The bottlenecks that remains relevant from the generic tool are: basic understanding of human/livestock host immunology; using an appropriate animal challenge model (camels would be suitable, but few places have facilities for such a large model); and the three main bottlenecks in clinical development of obtaining ethical and regulatory approval, working with vaccines classified as GMOs, as the viral vector platform has been altered genetically from its original form, and the availability of overseas trial sites.",

At the time of the UKVN formation, Zika was little heard of, and had only modest investment as a potential emerging virus in UK research funding portfolios. As the work of the UKVN progressed, the Zika outbreak unfolded, and funders in the UK and internationally were mobilised to increase investments. The UKVN immediately added Zika to the priority pathogen list, and contributed to a number of funding streams to support vaccine R&D. Applying the process mapping tool to such an emerging pathogen, allowed the visualisation of the significant number of unknowns and challenges when dealing with a little-known emerging disease without platform approaches (Fig. 3). In the earliest pre-clinical discovery stage, pathogen biology and host immunology were both rate limiting, particularly in identifying regions of the virus that could be used as a possible antigen. In vitro studies and deploying an in vivo challenge model were also rate limiting as the generation of reagents and the appropriate assays need to be established. Without a robust set of assays and generation of some antigen in the early discovery phase, the bottleneck would be overcome however identification of the surrogate/correlate of protection in the appropriate challenge models will be important. It should be noted that many vaccines have launched without the establishment of correlates of protection and will depend on the licensure sought and the severity of the disease and its outbreak.",
