            "text": "As infection with the Gram\u2010negative bacterium Helicobacter pylori causes the most common gastroduodenal human diseases, antibiotic therapy is used to eradicate H. pylori infection (Crespo & Suh, 2001; Czinn, 2004). However, current therapeutic regimens have produced unsatisfactory results due to the emergence of antibiotic resistance of H. pylori and a high reinfection rate after successful eradication (Zendehdel et al., 2005). This has led to a requirement to develop a vaccination method to prevent infection by H. pylori. In this context, several cellular components of H. pylori, including the cytotoxin\u2010associated gene A (CagA) (Prinz et al., 2003), adhesin (Xu et al., 2005), urease (Lee et al., 2001), vacuolating cytotoxin A (Liu et al., 2004), neutrophil\u2010activating protein (Satin et al., 2000), catalase (Chen et al., 2003), and Cag12 (Kim et al., 2006b), have been selected as putative antigens for the vaccination against H. pylori. Among these putative antigens, CagA and Cag12 are known to be the protein components of the type IV secretion system (T4SS) that builds a needle\u2010like structure on the H. pylori. Significant advances in our understanding of the pathogenic role of the cag pathogenicity island (cag\u2010PAI) in H. pylori have revealed that the type 1 H. pylori strains, which are mainly associated with several severe forms of gastric diseases, can be distinguished from type II strains by the presence of cag\u2010PAI (2008, 2003). The cag\u2010PAI consists of 32 genes and encodes the T4SS. Helicobacter pylori uses T4SS to inject the CagA protein and possibly other factors into gastric epithelial cells, in a manner similar to T4SS of Agrobacterium tumefaciens, which transfers oncogenic DNA and effector proteins to host cells during infection (2004, 2003). Although the protein components of H. pylori T4SS, as well as the precise mechanisms by which T4SS mediates its diverse effects on host cells, remain obscure, it has been shown by microscopic techniques that the VirB10\u2010homologous protein HP0527 (Cag7) covers a central hollow needle region of T4SS of H. pylori as a major component of T4SS\u2010associated needle\u2010like structure surface filament (Rohde et al., 2003). Helicobacter pylori Cag7 likely has the potential to be used as a vaccine antigen, in that Cag7 is localized on the surface of T4SS, which is detected in all strains of type I H. pylori in association with their pathogenicity. However, Cag7 of the T4SS has not been tested as a vaccine antigen that induces protective immunity against H. pylori.",

Although L. lactis lacks the ability to colonize in vivo, this bacterium has been shown to deliver heterologous antigens to the mucosal and systemic immune system via mucosal routes (Steidler et al., 2000). Lactococcus lactis has approximately the same size as biodegradable microparticles that can be taken up by M cells in gut\u2010associated immune tissues, thus supporting the capability of L. lactis to act as an effective oral vaccine vehicle. Furthermore, the phosphopolysaccharide produced by L. lactis is nontoxic but can function as a B\u2010cell mitogen (Kitazawa et al., 1996). Recently, several research groups have reported that L. lactis can be genetically engineered to express bacterial or viral antigens, including the HIV Env antigen (Xin et al., 2003), Brucella abortus L7/L12 antigen (Ribeiro et al., 2002), human papillomavirus Type 16 E7 antigen (Bermudez\u2010Humaran et al., 2002), Plasmodium falciparum merozoite surface protein MSP3 antigen (Theisen et al., 2004), Erysipelothrix rhusiopathiae SpaA antigen (Cheun et al., 2004), severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus nucleocapsid antigen (Pei et al., 2005), and tetanus toxin fragment C (Robinson et al., 2004).",

The 1152 bp of the 3\u2032\u2010region (3874\u20135025 nt) of the cag7 (HP0527) gene of H. pylori, which encodes the C\u2010terminal 383 amino acid (ct383 aa, 41.4 kDa) of Cag7 protein, including the VirB10\u2010homology region (VHR, 373 aa) and an additional 10 aa of the 3\u2032\u2010conserved region (TCR), appeared to be highly conserved among these three strains. It was therefore expressed in the live delivery vehicle L. lactis using the Escherichia coli\u2013L. lactis shuttle vector (pMG36e). Sequentially, the L. lactis transformant expressing the Cag7\u2010ct383 protein was orally delivered into mice to examine whether it could elicit a systemic humoral immune response against Cag7 protein of H. pylori.",

Under these conditions, the majority of GST\u2010Cag7\u2010ct383 fusion protein produced in the E. coli transformant appeared to remain in a soluble form without secretion (data not shown). Subsequently, the soluble form of the GST\u2010Cag7\u2010ct383 fusion protein contained in the cell lysate of the E. coli transformant was purified using Glutathione\u2010Sepharose 4B. As shown in Fig. 2a, the synthesis of the GST\u2010Cag7\u2010ct383 fusion protein with a molecular mass of 67.4 kDa was detected on 10% SDS\u2010PAGE. Approximately 120 \u03bcg of GST\u2010Cag7\u2010ct383 fusion protein was obtained from 60 mL of culture fluid under the above purification conditions. To raise a rat polyclonal antibody against the Cag7 of H. pylori 51, the purified GST\u2010Cag7\u2010ct383 fusion protein (30 \u03bcg) was mixed with Freund's complete or incomplete adjuvant and injected intramuscularly into the rat. To evaluate generation of the anti\u2010Cag7 antibody by Western blot analysis, the rat was bled 7 days after quaternary immunization. The antiserum, in 10 000\u2010fold dilution, appeared to detect the GST\u2010Cag7\u2010ct383 fusion protein (67.4 kDa) in the cell lysate as well as the purified protein that was used as the antigen (Fig. 2b). In addition, the antiserum was able to recognize specifically the individual intact Cag7 proteins (\u223c219 kDa) derived from the three H. pylori strains (26695, J99, and 51) (Fig. 2c). Under these conditions, the rat preimmune serum failed to recognize the GST\u2010Cag7\u2010ct383 or the intact Cag7 protein (data not shown). It is worth noting that the antiserum could detect a minor protein band with a molecular mass of 61 kDa. As this additional protein band was predicted to be a cleaved or truncated GST\u2010Cag7\u2010ct383 protein, the membrane was stripped and reprobed with anti\u2010GST antibody to examine this prediction. As shown in Fig. 2d, the 61\u2010kDa protein band detected by the rat antiserum was also recognized by anti\u2010GST antibody, confirming that it was a truncated or cleaved GST\u2010Cag7 fusion protein. These results indicated that the rat antiserum, raised against the GST\u2010Cag7\u2010ct383 fusion protein, could specifically recognize the Cag7 protein. In addition, these results demonstrated that the ct383 aa of Cag7, including the VHR (373 aa), was able to stimulate a humoral immunity to generate anti\u2010Cag7 antibody.",

Bleeding was carried out 4 days after the final oral administration. Thereafter, the immune response to the 41.4\u2010kDa Cag7\u2010ct383, the purified GST\u2010ct383 fusion protein (67.4 kDa), or the intact Cag7 protein (\u223c219 kDa) was evaluated by Western blot analysis using the antisera of the individual mice.

Recently, in relation to the pathogenicity of H. pylori, the cag pathogenicity island (cag\u2010PAI), which is \u223c40 kb in length, has been investigated (2008, 2003). The 32 genes, encoding components of the T4SS that builds a needle\u2010like structure on the H. pylori surface, are known to span the cag\u2010PAI. The Cag7 protein encoded by the cag7 gene located in the cag\u2010PAI is known to cover the surface of T4SS of H. pylori. In the present study, the ct383 aa region (\u223c41.4 kDa) of H. pylori Cag7 has been selected as the putative vaccine antigen and is expressed in L. lactis, which can deliver heterologous proteins to mucosal as well as systemic immune systems via mucosal routes. The Cag7 protein used in this study is thought to fulfill the criteria that are important for a vaccine antigen, i.e. it is a cell surface molecule as a component of the T4SS by which H. pylori injects virulence factors, including the CagA protein, into gastric epithelial cells (2004, 2003). Furthermore, comparison of the deduced amino acid sequence of Cag7 of H. pylori 51 with those of H. pylori 26695 and J99 counterparts revealed that the FCR, the TCR, and the VHR of Cag\u20107 protein possessed a high degree of identity (>95.5%) among these three strains. This highly conserved nature in the amino acid sequence of Cag7 protein among different H. pylori isolates also supports the potential of the Cag7 protein as a vaccine antigen against H. pylori. Several studies have revealed that the B\u2010cell epitopes on native antigen proteins are predominantly composed of hydrophilic amino acids rather than hydrophobic amino acids, because protruding regions on the surface of the antigen protein are generally recognized as the epitopes (2006, 2008). On the other hand, the immunodominant sites for helper T cells tend to be regions that can be folded as \u03b1\u2010helices and helices that are amphipathic, possessing a hydrophobic side and a hydrophilic side separated in space (1988, 1987). These two sides may serve to interact with the major histocompatibility molecule on the antigen\u2010presenting cell and with the T\u2010cell receptor, respectively. As hydrophobicity analysis revealed that the ct383 aa region of H. pylori Cag7 protein had a hydrophobic part between both hydrophilic ends in its primary structure, a decision was made to choose the Cag7\u2010ct383 aa region as the vaccination antigen.",

The vector plasmid pMG36e contains a promoter, a ribosomal binding site, the start of an ORF, and a transcriptional terminator, and is known to be a constitutive expression vector for the inserted gene in L. lactis (Van De Guchte et al., 1989). When the expression level of the Cag7\u2010ct383 protein in the L. lactis transformant was compared by Western blot analysis during the culture period for 120 h, the expression level of the Cag7\u2010ct383 protein (41.4 kDa) exhibited no significant variation between the early log phase and the late log phase, with the maximum level expression occurring at the early stationary phase, thus demonstrating its constitutive expression regardless of the population growth phases. In our previous studies, the expression level of the H. pylori HpaA protein by the vector plasmid pMG36e in the L. lactis transformant remained constant irrespective of the population growth phases (Kim et al., 2006a), whereas the expression level of the Cag12 protein appeared to vary during the growth phases in the L. lactis transformant, reaching a maximum level at the early log phase and decreasing to the basal level at the stationary phase (Kim et al., 2006b). As the vector plasmid pMG36e is a constitutive expression vector, these previous and current results suggest that the Cag12 protein, but not HpaA and Cag7\u2010ct383, produced in L. lactis may be unstable during the stationary phase. The oral administration of the L. lactis transformant expressing the Cag7\u2010ct383 protein into mice generated the anti\u2010Cag7 antibody in the serum of five of five mice, demonstrating that the systemic humoral immune response was successfully induced against the Cag7\u2010ct383 protein delivered by L. lactis via the mucosal route.
