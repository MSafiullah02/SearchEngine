Granuloma formation is most likely to be observed in the media. Although the presence of multinucleated giant cells inspired the name of the disease, they are often absent, and the mononuclear infiltrates lack a complex organization. If present, giant cells lie in close proximity to the fragmented internal elastic lamina. Their presence correlates with increased risk for ischemic complications. GCA can also present with perivascular cuffing of vasa vasorum or T cell\u2013macrophage infiltrates in the adventitia, sometimes arranged along the external elastic lamina. This finding is consistent with recent studies suggesting that the adventitia is a critical site in the disease process.\n\n",

Although the vessel lumen may become critically narrowed, thrombosis is not the central event. Hyperplasia of the intimal layer with scarring in the media and fragmentation of the elastic lamina are irreversible changes that persist beyond the stages of active arterial inflammation.",

T cells and macrophages in the arterial wall do not live and function in isolation, but rather closely interact with stromal components of the blood vessel in a bidirectional pattern (7). The major vascular abnormality leading to clinical disease is a nonthrombotic luminal occlusion, caused by rapid and concentric growth of the intima. These structural alterations result from the response to injury elicited in arterial cells (Figure 21A-2). Intimal hyperplasia is generated by the mobilization of smooth muscle cells, their directed migration towards the lumen, and their proliferation and matrix deposition. This process is under the control of growth factors. Platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF), a factor with the capability of supporting the outgrowth of the hyperplastic intima, is present in inflamed arteries. PDGF derives from macrophages and multinucleated giant cells. Patients with low PDGF production have no or minimal lumen-occlusive intimal proliferation. In contrast, those with excessive PDGF production are at a risk for ischemic complications (8).\n\n",

The media and intima of normal arteries are avascular, but intense neoangiogenesis is induced in GCA (9). Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is critical in driving the generation of neovessels in the media and intima. VEGF, like PDGF, originates from macrophages and multinucleated giant cells. The arterial response pattern initiated by the production of PDGF and VEGF leads to profound structural arterial abnormalities with subsequent stenosis and tissue ischemia, emphasizing that the immune system coerces the artery toward a counterproductive pattern of reaction. However, the inflammation also leads to the induction of protective response patterns that are aimed at healing and tissue repair. An example is the upregulation of the enzyme, aldose reductase (10), which metabolizes and detoxifies end products of oxidative damage.",

Further evidence for this systemic component is the activation in GCA patients of circulating monocytes, which produce IL-1 and IL-6. Elevated levels of IL-6, a potent inducer of acute phase responses, are characteristic of GCA. In this model, GCA is a systemic inflammatory disease, with vasculitis of medium and large arteries as a consequence of the disease process.",

No other environmental risk factors, including a variety of infectious agents, have been demonstrated convincingly to play important roles in this disease. The high incidence rates of GCA in all geographical regions settled by people of Scandinavian ethnicity strongly suggest inherited risk factors (1). The best available information is for human leukocyte antigen (HLA) genes. HLA-DR4 haplotypes are associated with increased disease risk. Several allelic variants of HLA-DR4 are enriched among patients. Selective binding of antigenic peptides has been proposed as the mechanism underlying this genetic association. In contrast to other HLA-DR4\u2013associated diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis, HLA polymorphisms do not correlate with clinical phenotypes and disease severity.

The glucocorticoid requirements may differ quite markedly among patients. Two thirds of patients can be expected to respond with remission of pain and stiffness when started on 20 mg/day or less prednisone (25). Some patients will need doses as high as 40 mg/day for complete clinical control. Such patients may be at higher risk of full-blown GCA. Patients initially controlled on 20 mg/day of prednisone can usually taper the dose by 2.5 mg every 10 to 14 days. More protracted tapering may be necessary once daily doses of 7 to 8 mg prednisone are attained. Dose adjustments should be based mainly on clinical evaluation, not exclusively on laboratory abnormalities. In many patients, PMR can go into long-term remission, and prednisone can be discontinued. Occasionally, successful suppression of recurrent myalgias and stiffness may only be achieved by giving very low doses of prednisone over an extended period. Patients should be warned about the potential of PMR progressing to GCA and should be monitored for vascular complications, particularly when discontinuing glucocorticoid therapy.",

Recommendations of initial doses have varied, but 40 to 60 mg of prednisone may be necessary to control vascular as well as systemic inflammation. Monitoring of acute phase reactants (ESR, CRP) is only helpful in a subset of patients.

Prednisone doses are tapered as clinically indicated and tolerated, usually by 5 mg/day every 2 weeks until a maintenance dose of 10 mg/day is reached. Further dose reductions must be tailored to the individual patient. Low-dose aspirin or other antiplatelet agents should complement glucocorticoid therapy. Methotrexate, given in weekly doses of up to 25 mg, has shown promise in improving remission rates and sparing glucocorticoids (35), but has never been tested in a randomized trial (the same is true for all other potential steroid-sparing agents). Azathioprine, mycophenolate mofetil, cyclosporine, and TNF-alpha blockers have been used with reported success in individual patients, but controlled studies are required.

ANCAs produce tissue damage via interactions with primed neutrophils and endothelial cells. The hypothesis, supported strongly by in vitro evidence, is that the antibodies induce a necrotizing vasculitis by inciting a respiratory burst and degranulation of leukocytes (neutrophils and monocytes), leading to endothelial injury. The initial events in the process require the priming of leukocytes by cytokines and perhaps other stimuli, leading to the expression of PR3 and MPO on the cell surface. The effects of ANCAs are determined by the state of neutrophil activation.

Moreover, most patients with AAVs produce isotype-switched IgG ANCA, implying a secondary immune response driven by T cells. Growing evidence, particularly data from clinical studies (18), now also implicates B cells as important participants in the inflammation of AAV. As the precursors of plasma cells (which produce ANCA), B cells now seem a logical therapeutic target in AAV. In addition to disrupting ANCA production, however, interference with B-cell function may also ameliorate AAV by disabling critical B cell/T cell interactions, by removing the antigen presenting function of B cells, and perhaps other mechanisms.

Distinguishing the AAVs from other forms of vasculitis is often more critical because the specific treatments differ according to diagnosis. In addition, the AAVs must be distinguished from a host of other disorders associated with inflammation and multiorgan system dysfunction. The differential diagnosis of AAV is shown in Table 21C-5.\n\n",

Serial procedures are often required. If severe subglottic stenosis precludes a safe dilatation procedure, a patent airway should first be secured by a tracheostomy. WG often leads to chronic nasosinus dysfunction.

First, a strong clue to the presence of mixed cryoglobulinemia is an extremely low (to almost undetectable) level of C4. For reasons that are not entirely clear, C4 levels are lowered out of proportion to the decrease observed in C3. Second, the monoclonal component of type II cryoglobulins almost invariably has rheumatoid factor activity (i.e., binds to the Fc portion of IgG). Thus, essentially all patients with type II cryoglobulinemia are rheumatoid factor-positive\u2014usually strikingly so. In many cases, rheumatoid factor tests are a more reliable screening test for type II cryoglobulinemia than are assays for cryoglobulins themselves. Although rheumatoid factor titers correlate with immunoglobulin burden in such patients and can be used in longitudinal follow-up in a manner similar to the cryocrit, the level of clinical symptomatology often correlates poorly with both rheumatoid factor level and cryocrit. Once patients have achieved a state of disease quiescence following treatment, both rheumatoid factor levels and cryocrit often remain elevated. Neither should be used as a gauge of therapy for most patients. Finally, acute-phase reactants such as the erythrocyte sedimentation rate and the C-reactive protein are elevated in many patients with cryoglobulinemia. In patients with type I cryoglobulinemia, for example, the erythrocyte sedimentation rate may be even higher than anticipated because of the excess circulating immunoglobulin.",

Anterior uveitis that is not treated promptly with a mydriatic agent may result in synechiae formation between the iris and the lens and permanent papillary distortion. The ocular manifestations of Beh\u00e7et\u2019s disease may also include a panuveitis, however, with posterior chamber involvement and retinal vasculitis, the complications of which may extend to visual loss. Retinal vasculitis, which leads to episodes of retinal occlusion and areas of ischemia, may be followed by neovascularization, vitreous hemorrhage and contraction, glaucoma, and retinal detachment. The earliest findings of retinal vasculitis may be detected with fluorescein angiography. Isolated optic disk edema in BD suggests cerebral venous thrombosis rather than ocular disease, but papillitis may occur with ocular inflammation and central nervous system disease. Cranial nerve palsies may result from brain stem lesions, and visual field defects may also be caused by intracranial disease involving the optic pathways.\n\n",

The findings of narrowing are, however, highly nonspecific, and can be caused by a host of nonvasculitic causes. Angiographic findings compatible with vasculitis are commonly encountered in conditions such as vasospasm, central nervous system infection, cerebral arterial emboli, intravascular lymphomatosis, and atherosclerosis. Furthermore, the sensitivity of angiography is limited if small vessels beyond its resolution are primarily involved. Cerebral angiography has been normal in some biopsy-proven cases.\n\n",

Presenting manifestations include sudden hearing loss, M\u00e9ni\u00e8re\u2019s-like vertigo and tinnitus, and ocular inflammation, alone or in any combination (22). Other features of the disease, if not present initially, usually follow within several months. Hearing loss is bilateral, shows a downsloping pattern on audiograms, and is often progressive and profound. Vestibular testing shows bilateral cochlear dysfunction, helping to distinguish this disorder from M\u00e9ni\u00e8re\u2019s syndrome. In comparison to M\u00e9ni\u00e8re\u2019s syndrome, the damage to hearing from Cogan\u2019s syndrome is typically more unremitting. Scleritis, uveitis, or other inflammatory conditions of the eye (Figure 21E-7) may be present initially but often patients will subsequently develop interstitial keratitis if not present initially. Systemic manifestations include headache, fever, arthralgia, and vasculitis, with or without aortitis.
