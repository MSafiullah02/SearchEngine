The sample size was small, and the calculation was based on a single outcome of the ICU stay. Other vital outcomes were mentioned as secondary outcomes. Despite the orientation of all surgical teams with both approaches, several surgeons still preferred a traditional FS, so there might have been some selection bias as allocation was according to surgeons\u2019 preference. The unequal number of groups was another issue. However, the groups were almost matched demographically. Despite the FS group had of higher BMI, we included cases with morbid obesity in the mini-sternotomy group up to 158 kg/BMI 60.2 kg/m2 without impact on postoperative outcomes. The study might be underpowered to detect significance in the difference in low-frequency events. This may or may not have affected some of the important outcomes such as pulmonary or neurological complications but not the ICU stay. Although we incorporated fast recovery protocols in our ICU, the duration of endotracheal intubation and length of postoperative stay was decided by the individual surgeon. No conversions were recorded.",
