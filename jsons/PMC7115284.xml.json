Ambulatory patients could stay in the RFCS and have their history taken and undergo physical examination, sputum induction, and nasopharyngeal or throat swab and receive oseltamivir treatment if indicated. Usually, the RFCS ran 24 hours per day and was staffed with 1 physician and 2 nurses. During day shifts (09:00-18:00), the RFCS was staffed with rotating physicians from all clinical departments. During night shifts, emergency physicians (EP) took over the work. Additional physicians were called to the RFCS from the department of internal medicine when the ED was overcrowded, and EPs could be freed from their clinical duties to manage ED patients.",

Furthermore, our telephone interviews only covered positive influenza cases; the lack of interviews for negative influenza cases limited the reliability of our RFCS satisfaction surveys. The lack of patients with neuropsychiatric adverse effects in our study is probably due to the low response rate for questionnaires. During our study period, no obvious neuropsychiatric adverse effects were reported to our hospital\u2019s drug adverse effect system nor were they reported from phone interviews (even though nearly 56% of cases enrolled in this study were young patients). Many patients did not answer their phones after ED visits, even though those patients provided telephone numbers to receive notifications of their influenza test results. Those patients who answered our phone survey might only reflect part of the status results from oseltamivir administration. Whether or not oseltamivir only causes neuropsychiatric adverse effects in the Japanese population still needs further studies.",
