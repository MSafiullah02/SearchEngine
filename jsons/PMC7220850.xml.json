Neutrophil dysfunction, reduced T cell response and disordered humoral immunity are contributory [7], and bacterial and viral respiratory tract infections are particularly common [8]. Diabetes is associated with increased morbidity and mortality risk from pneumonia [9], and hyperglycaemia on admission for pneumonia (>11 mmol/l) predicts poor outcome [9]. During the SARS epidemic in 2002/2003, diabetes was an independent predictor of mortality risk (OR 3.0; 95% CI 1.4, 6.3; p = 0.005) [10]. The presence of comorbidities, including diabetes, also increased mortality risk (independent of age) during the Middle East respiratory syndrome-coronavirus (MERS-CoV) epidemic in 2012 (adjusted HR 3.74; 95% CI 2.57, 5.67) [11]. In another study, diabetes had the strongest impact on mortality risk among MERS-CoV patients [12]. Similarly, among young patients with novel influenza A (H1N1) in 2009, diabetes increased the risk of intensive care unit (ICU) admissions (adjusted OR 4.72; 95% CI 1.81, 12.3) [13].",

This may indicate secondary bacterial infection exacerbating COVID-19. Increased serum ferritin, in particular, might suggest a severe secondary bacterial infection among these patients, thereby making it useful as a cost-effective prognostic marker [23, 24]. Lymphopaenia was also associated with very severe disease [23, 24]. Raised D-dimer levels were observed in severe illness, suggesting a possible consumptive coagulopathy [25], while anticoagulation was linked to decreased mortality rate in COVID-19 patients [26].",

However, people with diabetes in this study were older and had higher prevalence of cardiovascular disease. It is noteworthy that diabetes itself is a proinflammatory and prothrombotic state [28]. The data indicate that COVID-19, at least in its severe forms, is a state of severe inflammation and thrombotic tendency, so those with diabetes may be predisposed to such intense immune dysfunction resulting in severe late disease. This is further supported by the observation that renal and cardiovascular comorbidities, which add to the proinflammatory state, further worsen the outcome [27].",

ACE2 converts angiotensin I and II to angiotensin-(1\u20139) and angiotensin-(1\u20137), respectively (Fig. 1). The latter acts as a vasodilator and has anti-inflammatory and cardioprotective effects. According to animal studies, expression of ACE2 in lung tissues is low under normal conditions [31], but is upregulated during lung injury [32]. In fact, some animal studies [33] and pilot studies in humans [34] have suggested a potential therapeutic role of ACE2 against inflammatory acute lung injury. Furthermore, SARS-CoV (the virus responsible for the 2002/2003 SARS epidemic) appears to downregulate ACE2 expression in infected cells, and this is thought to perpetuate the inflammatory injury [35].",

Furthermore, ACE2 gene polymorphism has been linked to increased risk of diabetes and cardiovascular disease and this may also predict susceptibility to severe CoV infection [39]. By contrast, upregulated ACE2 may increase levels of angiotensin-(1\u20137), mounting an anti-inflammatory effect. However, low angiotensin II levels (due to ACEI inhibition) may mitigate this benefit. Thus it is still unclear what the balance between benefit and risk might be in continuing or stopping ACE inhibition [32].",

Patients should adhere to the \u2018sick day rules\u2019 for people with diabetes [50], and frequent monitoring of capillary glucose is important. Patients who develop severe illness are likely to need treatment modifications.

There are specific concerns in relation to glucose-lowering agents when used in patients with COVID-19 (Table 1).

Glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist (GLP-1RA) therapy should probably be temporarily discontinued in patients with haemodynamic instability (which compromises absorption from subcutaneous sites), renal dysfunction, and gastrointestinal dysfunction (which prevents adequate oral intake). Treatment with GLP-1RAs may cause gastrointestinal side effects, predisposing to volume depletion and aspiration [54]. Dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP4) inhibitors are associated with low risk of hypoglycaemia and are relatively safe across a wide range of renal functions. DPP4 inhibitors added to basal insulin improve glycaemic control without increasing the risk of hypoglycaemia, even among hospitalised patients [55]. However, these agents are likely to be of less therapeutic benefit in patients with severe COVID-19. While patients with mild symptoms could continue DPP4 inhibitors, these should be omitted in acute severe illness and replaced with insulin if this becomes necessary. During a severe illness, fine control of blood glucose is difficult when using sulfonylureas. In such patients, sulfonylureas should be replaced with insulin. Caution with sulfonylureas also needs to be exercised if chloroquine is considered, because of risk of hypoglycaemia with both. Thiazolidinediones (e.g. pioglitazone) are a less favourable option for in-hospital management of acutely ill patients, because of fluid retention and oedema. They are contraindicated in patients with haemodynamic instability, or hepatic or cardiac dysfunction, which may be seen in severe COVID-19 infection [56].",

For non-critically ill hospitalised patients, subcutaneous insulin therapy with basal or intermediate-acting insulin given once or twice a day, along with mealtime boluses of short- or rapid-acting insulin, is the preferred strategy for glycaemic management [57]. Sliding scale therapy should probably not be practiced as this results in greater fluctuations and poor overall control [58]. For critically ill patients, insulin therapy should be initiated with a glycaemic target of 7.8\u201310 mmol/l (140\u2013180 mg/dl) [59]. Less stringent glycaemic control with target glucose concentrations >10 mmol/l (180 mg/dl) may be acceptable in terminally ill patients, in patients with severe comorbidities, and in patient care settings where frequent glucose monitoring or close nursing supervision is not feasible. Less aggressive insulin regimens aimed at simply minimising glucosuria, dehydration and electrolyte disturbances may be justifiable in such patients. Although there are no strict guidelines regarding the insulin regimen for glycaemic control in critically ill patients, intravenous insulin infusions and short or rapid-acting insulin boluses may be used. Disease severity, nutritional status, concomitant medications and trend of glycaemic fluctuations should be considered in determining insulin dosage [60].",

ACE2 converts angiotensin I and angiotensin II to angiotensin-(1\u20139) and angiotensin-(1\u20137), respectively. ACE2 is also expressed in the lung, kidney, heart and pancreas and acts as a facilitator for CoV entry into cells. Use of ACEI/ARBs increases angiotensin I levels and upregulates ACE2 gene expression. This facilitates excess viral entry into host cells causing organ injury and insulin deficiency, contributing to hyperglycaemia. Upregulated ACE2 may convert angiotensin II to angiotensin-(1\u20137). The latter acts on the Mas1 receptor to trigger anti-inflammatory effects and inhibits the AT1 receptor to cause vasodilation. However, at least in ACEI users, angiotensin II levels will be low and the net benefit of ACE2 upregulation is uncertain. CoV infection downregulates ACE2 expression, thereby reducing angiotensin-(1\u20137) levels, which reduces its anti-inflammatory effects and potentially worsens organ vulnerability to infection.
