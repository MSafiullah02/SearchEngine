This is predominantly considered a function of rapid, innate NK-cell killing of virus-infected cells. However, NK cells also prime other immune cells through the release of interferon gamma (IFN-g) and other cytokines. Additionally, NK cells share features with long-lived adaptive immune cells and can impact disease pathogenesis through the inhibition of adaptive immune responses by virus-specific T and B cells. The relative contributions of these diverse and conflicting functions of NK cells in humans are poorly defined and likely context-dependent, thereby complicating the development of therapeutic interventions. Here we focus on the contributions of NK cells to disease in diverse virus infections germane to human health.",

Natural killer (NK) cells are a type of innate lymphoid cell (ILC) that unquestionably play an important role in immune defense against infection in both mice and humans. The contribution of NK cells to cytolytic killing of virusinfected cells is well-established and prominently featured in immunology textbooks. Likewise, the importance of early and potent production of pro-inflammatory cytokines like interferon gamma (IFN-g) by NK cells is widely accepted. More recently, there is increasing evidence that NK cells play a key regulatory role in shaping adaptive immune responses to control infection [1] . In this capacity, NK cells have been shown to kill both antigen-presenting cells [2,3] and virus-specific T cells [4,5 ,6,7 ,8 ,9,10] , and can produce anti-inflammatory cytokines like interleukin-10 (IL-10) to suppress immunity [11] [12] [13] . NK cells can also play a beneficial regulatory role in stimulating adaptive immunity [14] . Finally, a series of recent intriguing studies have questioned the 'innate' nature of NK cells by advancing the concept of long-lived memory NK cells that can contribute to viral control during latent infections or following re-infection [15] [16] [17] .",

This uncertainty is almost undoubtedly compounded by the context-dependence of NK cell activity in different virus infections. In order to complement more in-depth summaries of the regulatory [1], antiviral [19] , and memory functions [20] of NK cells, this review focuses on highlighting what is presently known about the potential involvement of NK cells in different types of virus infections relevant to human disease.",

This is paralleled by the increased susceptibility of mice lacking NK cells or particular NK-cell receptors to murine CMV (MCMV) infection [22, 23] , wherein infected cells are targets of NK-cell cytolytic attack and the antiviral effects of IFN-g [24] . Notably, several herpesviruses encode genes that promote evasion of NK-cell antiviral function [25] .

Additionally, there is some speculation that severe T cell-mediated pathology in the absence of cytotoxic function in hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis patients, who suffer severe pathology during uncontrolled virus infections, arises as a consequence of both loss of cytotoxic-mediated elimination of virus infected cells and NK cell-mediated cytotoxic regulation of adaptive immunity [35] .

However, NK cells can also kill virus-specific CD8T cells in a TRAIL-dependent manner in chronically infected individuals [5 ], thereby suppressing the ability of antiviral T cells to control infection. Moreover, the killing of infected hepatocytes by NK cells also contributes to liver damage and development of disease, whereas NK-cell killing of activated stellate cells in HBV-infected individuals may prevent the development of fibrosis [56,57].

NK cells are potently activated by the inflammatory cytokine milieu (e.g. type I IFN) during LCMV infection, resulting in suppression of virus-specific CD4 and CD8T cell responses as well as antigenpresenting cell function [4,9,59,60,61 ]. Ironically, type I IFN is also critical for protecting antiviral T cells from NK-cell mediated cytolysis [7 ,8 ] . Importantly, NK cell inhibition of antiviral T and B cells could prevent fatal immunopathology [4] and facilitate viral persistence during chronic LCMV infection [4,9,60,61 ]. Similar regulatory functions of NK cells during acute LCMV infection contributed to diminished virus-specific memory T-cell and B-cell responses [62 ] . Whether NK cells play a similar role in determining disease outcome during infections of humans with Lassa, Machupo, and other arenaviruses remains to be explored.

In the case of infection with human T-cell leukemia virus type 1 (HTLV-1), the sum of available evidence suggests that NK cells are not involved in control of HTLV-1 infection or disease outcome [78] . By contrast, genetic studies have revealed an association between the presence of NK cell receptors (e.g. KIRs) and slower progression toward AIDS disease [79] . This is most likely due to NK cell-mediated killing of infected cells, since the protective KIR alleles are associated with enhanced NK cell cytolysis in vitro [80] and HIV appears to mutate in order to escape NK cell-mediated KIR-facilitated immune pressure [81] . HIV also exerts multiple effects on infected cells in order to subvert NK cell-mediated killing [82] [83] [84] [85] . Nevertheless, the activation of NK cells or the lack of certain inhibitory NK cell receptors has been positively correlated with AIDS progression [86] , suggesting that these cells may promote disease while trying to combat the infection. Other studies have highlighted an inverse relationship between NK cells and antiviral T cells [87] , which suggests an element of NK-cell regulation of adaptive immunity at play in the determination of pathogenesis of HIV infection. In fact, NK-cell mediated suppression of adaptive immunity has been observed at distinct stages of Friend retrovirus infection of mice, whereas other time points reveal NK cell control of retrovirus replication that was recently shown to be suppressed by regulatory T cells [88, 89] . These studies highlight the potentially complex relationship between NK cells and virus in disease pathogenesis.",

This function can be detrimental when NK cells cause immunopathology or when NK cells are too effective at eliminating viral vectors in oncotherapy and gene therapy trials. There are also defined instances of long-lived memory NK cells that may contribute to immunity and health in ways that are not currently apparent. Importantly, the regulatory function of human NK cells cannot be overlooked in the interpretation of experimental results and evaluation of factors contributing to disease. However, current clinical practices must largely favor strategies to stimulate or induce only the antiviral functions of NK cells. The value of activating NK cells in chronic infection has been realized during therapeutic vaccination of SIVinfected macaques [106 ] , restoration of HIV-specific T cell responses in human HIV infection [107 ] , ribavirin/ interferon therapy of chronic hepatitis C virus infection in human patients [108] , IL-15-based potentiation of anti-HIV immune responses in humanized mice [109] , and probiotic enhancement of control of influenza virus infection in mice [110] . Nevertheless, there are also reports that subversion of NK cell function can enhance adaptive immune responses that facilitate better control of virus replication in chronic infection [5 ,36,111 ] . Moreover, attempts to subvert the regulatory function in order to enhance adaptive immunity may have detrimental consequences for NK cell-mediated host resistance against latent herpesviruses and other viral pathogens present in most healthy adults. Continued evaluation of the specific context-dependent roles of NK cells in human virus infection will be necessary to guide attempts to modulate NK cells in therapy or prevention of infection. ",
