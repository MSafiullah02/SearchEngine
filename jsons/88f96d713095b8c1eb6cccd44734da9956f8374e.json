Moreover, testing has often been targeted to specific subgroups, such as individuals who were symptomatic or who were previously exposed to the virus, whose infection probability differs from that in the overall population [6, 7] . 1 Given this sample selection bias, it is impossible to infer overall disease prevalence from the share of positive cases among the tested individuals.",

Large differences in testing rates also exist at the subnational level. For example, per capita testing in the state of New York was nearly two times higher than in neighboring New Jersey [8] . Because the severity of sample selection bias depends on the extent of testing, these disparities create large uncertainty regarding the relative disease prevalence across jurisdictions, and may contribute to the wide differences in estimated case fatality rates [10, 11] .",

Second, because our analysis focuses on high frequency day-to-day changes in outcomes, there is limited scope for large evolution in underlying disease prevalence. Finally, in robustness exercises, we augmented the basic model to include state fixed effects, thereby allowing for state-specific exponential growth in underlying disease prevalence from one day to the next.

Our approach builds on a standard econometric technique that have been used to address sample selection bias in a variety of different settings. Our estimation strategy offers several advantages over existing methods. First, the analysis has minimal data requirements. The three variables used for estimation -daily infections, daily number of tests, and total population -are widely reported across a large number of countries and subnational districts. Second, the model identification is transparent and depends only on a simple exclusion restriction assumption that daily changes in the number of conducted tests must be uncorrelated with underlying changes in population disease prevalence.

Meanwhile, Germany's 0.7% infection rate would rank in the lowest tercile of prevalence among U.S. states.

To the extent that decisions regarding who to test, conditional on the number of available tests, diverged across states or changed within states over the sample period, our model may be misspecified. Finally, our analysis depends on the quality of diagnostic testing, and systematic false negative test results may affect the population disease prevalence estimates [34] [35] [36] . 4 As countries continue to struggle against the ongoing coronavirus pandemic, informed policymaking will depend crucially on timely information on infection rates across different regions. Randomized population-based testing can provide this information, however, given the constraints on supplies, this approach has largely been eschewed in favor of targeted testing towards high risk groups. In this paper, we developed a new approach to estimate population disease prevalence when testing is non-random. The estimation procedure is straightforward, has few data requirements, and can be used to estimate disease prevalence at various jurisdictional levels.",
