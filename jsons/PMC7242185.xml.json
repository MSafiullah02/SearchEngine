After the first confirmed case reported on February 20th 2020 in Codogno, a small town near Milan, the rapid diffusion of the infection prompted the Italian Government to proclaim a national lockdown on 9th March 2020, forcing the entire population to severe restrictive isolation measures. These measures, certainly helpful in reducing the diffusion of SARS-CoV-2 infection, significantly modified the patients\u2019 response to non-SARS-CoV-2 medical conditions, including acute coronary syndrome (ACS) (2). Since ACS is a life-threatening condition with outcome strictly dependent on prompt recognition and treatment, under- or misdiagnosis and late or missed treatment might be deleterious. In the current study we report data from high-volume hospitals from three variably affected regions Piedmont, Marche and Tuscany in order to evaluate changes in ACS-hospitalization rate during the first month of the SARS-CoV-2 Italian outbreak.",

            "text": "The SARS-CoV-2 epidemic was associated with a significant decrease in ACS-hospitalization rate, a reduction not justified by a possible biological explanation. Viral infections and ACS share the development of a peak during winter as clearly shown by epidemiological studies and meta-analyses that suggest a significant increase in ACS-STEMI in patients affected by seasonal flu when compared with the remaining population (3, 4). SARS-CoV-2 infection shares many similarities with other coronaviruses infection such as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, both responsible for increase in acute cardiovascular events rate in infected patients (5). Patients with SARS-CoV-2 infections also develop a general pro-inflammatory and hypercoagulative status explaining the frequent acute coronary events observed in-hospital (2). The opposite phenomenon of a paradoxical reduction observed can have several possible explanations. Firstly, the fear of risking a close contact with infected SARS-CoV-2 patients might have discouraged the access to the emergency room in case of mild symptoms of chest pain or breathlessness. Secondly, the insistence on isolation at home may have deterred patients to seek consultations with their general practitioner or undergo examinations such as ECG or echocardiography. Mild clinical ACS-symptoms such as dyspnea, chest tightness associated with increased myocardial enzymes and without clear ECG changes could have been dismissed as a consequence of widespread viral organ involvement and the overstress suffered by the National Health Service might have impacted at least for the most crucial days of mid-March on the timing of transportation and hospital admission. Unfortunately, underdiagnosis and late or missed treatment might be deleterious for ACS-patients, a life-threatening condition with outcome closely related to prompted recognition and treatment. Untreated ACS might result in both acute and long-term complications such as cardiac rupture, pericardial tamponade, mitral regurgitation, aneurysmal dilatation and marked reduction in LVEF resulting in immediate cardiogenic shock and late chronic heart failure. Numbers were too small and follow-up too short to show a survival difference at discharge or in the first month. The higher release of cardiac enzymes, more severe LVEF impairment and more frequent GRACE scores in the group with predicted higher 6-month mortality suggest high likelihood of a worse outcome at late follow-up. The time delay in the door-to-balloon of 10 extra minutes, probably explained by the need to carefully wear personal protective equipment was sufficient to be statistically significant compared with 2019 but unlikely to cause a clinically relevant worsening in prognosis. We have applied in these patients the same aggressive approach recommended in the current ESC-Guidelines. In Sichuan Provincial People\u2019s Hospital, a conservative approach with frequent use of thrombolysis was applied in most ACS-STEMI/NSTEMI syndromes certainly a suboptimal treatment in the urgent/primary PCI era. Possibly the fact that dedicated COVID-hospitals were created led to a dedicated path of treatment that made it difficult to retransfer patients already in a COVID-area into hospitals with PCI facilities, a problem not present in any of the three hospitals recruiting for this study (2). The marked reduction of ACS-complications observed in the last decades are certainly justified by the widespread diffusion of an emergency network allowing most of our population to an early reperfusion therapy. If our findings will be confirmed in large scale registries, we might expect to face an increase of serious myocardial impairment that will represent a new challenge for the entire cardiological community.",

The correct antiplatelet/anticoagulant therapy in the prothrombotic state related to COVID infection remain a matter of concern; in our study the use of GP IIb/IIIa was low in both groups while Cangrelor infusions were used more often in the 2020-group. A larger sample size including more hospitals and multiple inter-year and intra-year control periods would have certainly improved the statistical power of our findings, but the reduction of ACS-hospitalization during the first three months of the Italian lockdown has been confirmed by our recently published large North Italian registry (1)",
