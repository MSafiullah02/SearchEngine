Numerous countries have publicly available national-level plans, although many of these plans were published prior to the most recent 2009 influenza A (H1N1) pandemic and have not been updated since (WHO, 2018c) . This is of importance, as WHO influenza pandemic preparedness guidance has shifted over time. The 2005 WHO Global Influenza Preparedness Plan provides a framework for many of the aforementioned plans and orients preparedness efforts around the six WHO pandemic phases. This guidance details five national objective categories for each phase: (i) planning and coordination, (ii) situation monitoring and assessment, (iii) prevention and containment, (iv) health system response, and .

First, inputs and knowledge are required across a wide range of fields. The WHO checklist, and by extension our tool, requires considering aspects such as legal and policy issues, points of entry, disease surveillance, clinical management. At a minimum, these require extensive knowledge from a diverse suite of fields including law, government, public health, medicine, and the sciences. A methodology that relies on the judgment of individuals assumes sufficient knowledge of these important considerations. Should an individual not possess this knowledge, a national-level plan may be inaccurately assessed. This speaks to the importance of including multiple individuals in the assessment process. Conversely, if too many individuals are involved in the assessment, it may prove difficult to reach the consensus required for the assessment procedure. Ensuring appropriate individuals are assessing plans is of great importance.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "Second, this tool does not address any real or perceived limitations of the WHO guidance itself. For instance, the WHO guidance does not address areas such as One Health-the intersection of human, environmental, and animal health-that is central to pandemic preparedness. Planning efforts that want to incorporate these approaches must incorporate resources beyond the WHO checklist and our tool.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "Third, given the scope of the capacities now required to be included in national-level plans, many may be detailed in other national-level or subnational guidance documents. For example, business continuity guidance may be detailed in other documents. However, the tool presented is only designed to evaluate national-level influenza plans. This challenge may be overcome by agreeing to include these additional documents in the assessment if they are explicitly mentioned. At a minimum, if this guidance does exist elsewhere, an effort should be made to incorporate it into revised national-level influenza plans.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "Throughout our piloting of the tool, there were interpretive differences in assessment methodology. This most often occurred when a plan referenced a capacity or discussed a capacity in detail. For example, when evaluating the required essential medicines list, a discrepancy could arise if a plan referenced the existence of a list versus detailing the list in the plan itself. Differences in interpretation also arose from linguistic barriers. For example, \"mapping\" used in the context of \"mapping of existing public and private healthcare facilities\" was not intuitive to non-English speakers. An inherent limitation of the tool is that the assessment will often rely on the scorer's interpretation of phrases and wording. To help overcome this, scorers should agree on an approach prior to evaluating plans and provide a brief justification of their scores to facilitate the discussion required to reach a consensus score.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "Preparedness for pandemic influenza represents a top concern for global health security in today's globalized and interconnected world. However, health policy does not reflect this. Should an influenza pandemic occur tomorrow, the world's response would be dated and lack key considerations. The updated WHO guidance provides a policy window to address these gaps by developing or revising national-level guidance to improve preparedness for pandemic influenza.
