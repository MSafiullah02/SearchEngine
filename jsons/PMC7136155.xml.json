When the RT-PCR test for swab was negative at early stage, the chest image would play an important role in diagnosis [5\u20137]. Therefore, we need to strengthen the recognition of image changes to help clinicians to diagnose quickly and accurately. It is difficult to distinguish COVID-19 pneumonia from other viral pneumonia on CT findings alone; however, high-resolution CT (HRCT) of the chest is critical for early detection and improvement of diagnostic confidence for patient with COVID-19 amid possible negative RT-PCR period.",
