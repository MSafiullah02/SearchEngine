Diabetic foot complications are a major cause of concern for diabetic patients as it affects mobility and quality of life. At present, any patient suffering from diabetes for five or more years in the case of type 1 diabetes and patients diagnosed with type 2 should undergo foot evaluation to prevent any foot complication such as ulcer or peripheral neuropathy. This requires the patient to visit the foot evaluation clinic in regular periods usually 3 months in the case of at risk patients, 6 months with patients involving other diabetic complications and peripheral arterial disease and 1 year for regular foot evaluation. This is cumbersome looking at the money and time involved. Many patients avoid or ignore the visit. This later converts to foot or toe amputation which can be avoided if computer aided diagnosis system is available at home as an app in mobile or for telemedicine purposes. For such a system, image processing has to be done automatically and abnormality has to be detected immediately that suggests treatment or visiting the clinic. This is where machine learning comes into play as image processing for the extraction of abnormal regions, grading the level of complication and for decision making to suggest further action such as suggesting the patient to visit the foot evaluation clinic and get the treatment done or later for telemedicine. Hence we studied the surface temperature distribution (STD) patterns in the plantar foot of both diabetic and healthy subjects to establish the differences in temperature capable to early diagnosis of the complication and we are looking forward to building a diagnostic system to detect and assess diabetic foot complications early to prevent amputation.",

Features extracted from medical images are very subjective. As features are not hand crafted and learning happens in an unsupervised manner, it is very suitable to avoid any bias in reading the temperature values. Also, the ability to learn new features automatically enhances the accuracy of classification.",

For such small datasets, it is still possible to use Deep Convolutional Neural Networks which was pretrained on large datasets using natural images. The power of CNNs can be leveraged to small datasets using the concept of transfer learning as pointed out in Ref. [31]. We have explored the use of pretrained deep learning convolutional neural network (CNN) model called the Mobilenet model [32] to classify the foot images as healthy, diabetic without complications and diabetic with complications. Training a deep learning model from scratch will take days. But a pretrained model can be retrained for our own problem in few hours. It took just few seconds for our problem on a 1060 GPU. The evaluation/classification time taken on the machine for a single image is 0.05 s on an average. We have used the Tensorflow library and the mobilenet architecture for the same. This is a preliminary study to evaluate and understand the applicability of CNN model to thermal infrared images and it has shown promising results. Fig. 11\nshows the steps involved in the using the pretrained model for our classification problem. Fig. 12\nshows the three classes of images that the model is trained on: the diabetic with complications, diabetic without complications and healthy subjects without diabetes.",

In this paper, authors have analyzed three different setups for acquiring thermal images of the foot and have discussed the influence of these on the accuracy of segmentation. The results show that acquisition protocol influences the result of image processing and hence has a pivotal role to play when it comes to efficient use of infrared thermography in medical image analysis.

With the special characteristics and advantages of thermal imaging, computer aided diagnosis systems are becoming more and more accurate and effective. The advancements in image processing, feature extraction and selection and soft computing techniques like deep learning in combination with improvements in parallel computing architectures have paved way for more interest and importance to research in this imaging modality. The soft computing techniques used mostly are artificial neural networks, SVM and genetic algorithm with texture based features for most of the classification task. But the most effective ones are the mean temperature difference and correlation. With more computing power and capability of the recent systems and the reappraisal of thermography in medicine, we shall see more advances in deep learning in the years to come. Thermography is being recognized as an adjunct tool for detecting abnormality in the temperature profile of patients to uncover an underlying disease or inflammation. The advantage of being noncontact and noninvasive makes it a safe diagnostic imaging technique. This chapter emphasizes the use of existing soft computing techniques coupled with the specific characteristics of infrared thermography making it more efficient and safe. The authors\u2019 current work on automated foot thermal image analysis for diabetic foot assessment is also discussed and future research directions are also given.",
