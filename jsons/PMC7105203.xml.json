            "text": "Cystic fibrosis (CF) affects over 60,000 patients worldwide. Bacterial infections are the main cause of recurrent pulmonary exacerbations leading to progressive lung damage with less known about the role of viral respiratory tract infections [1], [2], [3]. The true impact of respiratory viruses in CF may have been previously underestimated as the majority of previous studies [4], [5] used viral culture and/or immunofluorescence techniques which are relatively insensitive and restricted in breadth for viral detection [1], [2]. To date, published reports of respiratory viral infections in children with CF have primarily focused on the proportion of pulmonary exacerbations associated with viruses [1], [4], [5], [6], [7], [8]. The relationship between severity of these exacerbations and infection status with respiratory viruses has not been assessed. The extent to which these complications are mediated by direct viral effects or via potentiation of bacterial colonization and infection is unclear [5]. The pulmonary manifestations of CF involve both neutrophil-dominated airway inflammation and chronic bacterial infection. Although the temporal relationship between infection and inflammation remains unclear in early disease, later in disease there is a self-perpetuating cycle of airway obstruction, chronic bacterial infection and vigorous inflammation resulting in structural damage to the airway [9], [10], [11]. Less is currently known about the contribution from viral infections. A better understanding of the host inflammatory response following respiratory viral infections may minimize the use of prolonged antibiotic therapy.",

Informed consent (and assent from child as appropriate) was obtained from all participants and ethics approval was obtained from the Research Ethics Board at The Hospital for Sick Children. Exclusion criteria included lack of consent and insufficient command of English or absence of translator.",

The Cystic Fibrosis Questionnaire-Revised (CFQ-R ) [12] and the Cystic Fibrosis Clinical Score (CFCS) [13] were prospectively administered to participants through standardized interviews and physical assessments. The CFCS is an acute clinical score, based on signs and symptoms. It was chosen as a severity scale because of its reliability and its ease of use [13]. Body mass index (BMI) percentile was calculated for children \u2265 2 years of age and weight-for-recumbent length percentile for those under the age of 2 [14]. Mid-turbinate flocked swabs (Copan Diagnostics, Murrietta, CA), collected from all enrolled patients, were placed into in 3 mL of Universal Transport Medium (UTM-RT COPAN Diagnostics, Murrieta, CA). In addition, children old enough to produce sputum provided sputum samples while FLOQ COPAN throat swabs (inoculated in UTM) were obtained from those unable to produce sputum (refer to Fig. 1\nfor sample collection and testing).",

We also applied the ResPlex II v2.0 panel to FLOQ COPAN throat swabs and Sputolysin (10.14 mg/ml, CALBIOCHEM)-treated sputum sample after ensuring that Sputolysin would not affect the performance of the assay (Fig. 1). To evaluate the potential interference of Sputolysin with the efficiency of nucleic acid extraction and performance of the assay, we randomly chose four known positive mid-turbinate samples (RSV B, PIV 1, HRV/INFA and RSVA) from another study and divided them each into two equal aliquots. The potential interference of Sputolysin was tested on mid-turbinate swabs instead of sputum samples as non Sputolysin-treated sputum samples would not enable appropriate nucleic acid extraction because of the sputum viscosity. We mixed one aliquot with an equal volume of 10% Sputolysin in PBS (phosphate buffered saline) and the other with an equal volume of PBS alone. After incubation for 10 min at room temperature, we extracted total nucleic acids from both aliquots with the NucliSENS easyMAG (bioMerieux, St Laurent, QC, Canada ) followed by amplification with the Resplex II v2.0 assay [15]. A patient was classified as being virus-positive if a respiratory virus was detected in the mid-turbinate or throat or sputum sample by any one of the three assays used (DFA, Resplex II v2.0 or RT-PCR).",

Our study reported a higher rate of viral detection with mid-turbinate swabs than with sputum samples in contrast with another recent study which reported higher concordance rates (87% for rhinoviruses detection and 92% for other virus types) [24]. The difference in timing of sampling between this study (23% of samples collected during exacerbation) and ours (100% during exacerbation) might have contributed to these observed differences. A larger study comparing test performance characteristics of paired upper airway and sputum samples collected during exacerbations would provide insights into the above findings.",

Despite the central importance of pulmonary exacerbations as an outcome measure in CF clinical trials, no standardized definition of pulmonary exacerbation that includes children under the age of 6 has been validated. In using a broader definition of pulmonary exacerbation which includes children managed as outpatients, our sample may have included more patients with mild exacerbations than other studies. However, the proportion of hospitalized patients with viral infection in our study (64%) was similar to that of outpatients (58%). Likewise, there are no generally accepted severity scores for pulmonary exacerbations that apply to younger children, including the CFQ-R, a validated and widely used patient-reported outcome. Despite its validation against PFTs as the gold standard, the CFCS has been infrequently used in clinical trials. This highlights the need for further evaluation of its applicability in clinical studies. Our small sample size did not permit subgroup analyses according to individual viruses. Finally, we did not have data on viral infection status in CF children not experiencing an exacerbation as a comparator to strengthen the association between the exacerbation and viral infections. Compared to other viruses such as RSV, rhinoviruses can shed for a prolonged period (> 3 weeks vs < 1 week) [25] and may have been acquired before the exacerbation. However, virus-positive subjects were more likely to present with fever upon exacerbation.",

Systematic detection of respiratory viruses by molecular techniques using mid-turbinate swabs should occur in the setting of a pulmonary exacerbation. The relative contribution of repeated respiratory viral infections in young children to pulmonary inflammation and continuing decline in lung function seen from an early age is not known. A longitudinal study which documents the decline in FEV1 over time and comprehensively evaluates patients for both viral and bacterial infections during exacerbations might help to clarify the contribution of respiratory viruses to progressive lung damage.",
