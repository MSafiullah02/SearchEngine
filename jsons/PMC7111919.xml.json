            "text": "Transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) is the causative agent of transmissible gastroenteritis (TGE), a highly contagious enteric disease in swine. The typical clinical symptoms of TGE consist of vomiting, acute diarrhea, and dehydration. Older animals usually recover, but in newborn piglets mortality rates may reach 100% (Saif and Wesley, 1992, Laude et al., 1993, Schwegmann-Wessels et al., 2002, Ren et al., 2008). TGE prevalence causes enormous economic losses in pig industry. TGEV is an enveloped, single-stranded, positive-sense RNA virus that belongs to the family Coronaviridae and order Nidovirales (Enjuanes et al., 2000, Yin et al., 2010). They own the largest RNA viral genome, about 30 kb. TGEV produces at least eight subgenomic mRNAs during viral replication and each mRNA consists of 3\u2032 co-terminal nested sets (Laude et al., 1993, Vaughn et al., 1995).",

The M protein is an abundant component of coronaviruses (Rottier, 1995, Ren et al., 2010b). The M protein as the major interferon inducing component has been proposed to play a role in innate immune response to coronaviruses (Charley and Laude, 1988, Laude et al., 1992). Roughly one-third of TGEV M protein assumes a topology in which part of the endodomain constitutes a fourth transmembrane segment, thereby positioning the carboxy terminus of the molecule on the exterior of the virion (Masters, 2006, Risco et al., 1995). TGEV N phosphoprotein complexes with the genomic RNA in a beads-on-a-string fashion to form the nucleocapsid (Su\u00f1\u00e9 et al., 1990, Cavanagh and The Coronaviridae Study Group of the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses, 1994). The S protein of coronaviruses is a large transmembrane protein with the amino terminus exposed to the virus surface and the carboxy terminus inside the virus particle and it assembles into trimers to form the distinctive viral surface spikes (Delmas and Laude, 1990). Coronavirus S protein plays an important role in inducing neutralizing antibodies (Garwes et al., 1978, Jim\u00e9nez et al., 1986, Laude et al., 1987, Su\u00f1\u00e9 et al., 1990) and it is also related to host cell tropism (Jacobs et al., 1986, Schwegmann-Wessels et al., 2003, Schwegmann-wessels et al., 2009, Ren et al., 2006), pathogenicity (Siddell, 1995, Krempl et al., 1997), fusion (Collins et al., 1982, Spaan et al., 1988), hemagglutination activity (Krempl et al., 2000, Krempl and Herrler, 2001) and interaction with its cellular receptors such as porcine aminopeptidase N (pAPN) (Delmas et al., 1992, Liu et al., 2009, Ren et al., 2010a).",

            "text": "APN, also called CD13 in human is a type II transmembrane ectopeptidase of 150 kDa that contains a zinc-binding motif (HEIAH) and forms a noncovalently bound homodimer on the cellular membrane (Liu et al., 2009). APN was extensively expressed on various cell lines such as hematopoietic cells of myeloid origin, fibroblasts, brain cells, and epithelial cells of the liver, kidney, and intestine, etc. (Tsukamoto et al., 2008, Zhang et al., 2008). It is reported that aminopeptidase N (pAPN) is a cellular receptor for most of group 1 coronaviruses including human coronavirus 229E (HCoV-229E), TGEV, feline coronavirus (FCoV) and canine coronavirus (CCoV) (Delmas et al., 1992, Tresnan et al., 1996, Yeager et al., 1992). Generally, APN as receptors for many coronaviruses are species-specific (Delmas et al., 1994, Kolb et al., 1997), although the feline APN (fAPN) can also serve as a receptor for canine coronavirus, TGEV and human coronavirus 229E in addition to feline infectious peritonitis virus (Tresnan et al., 1996). The pAPN consists of several identified regions, which include the initiator methionine, cytoplasmic topological domain, transmembrane region, cytosolic Ser/Thr-rich junction region, metalloprotease region, and TGEV spike glycoprotein-interacting region, respectively (Fig. 1\n).",

In this study, we aimed at using this protein as target protein for identifying its ligands and investigating the role of the small molecules. The prokaryotic system is an optimal choice for achieving a high-level expression of heterologous protein (Yin et al., 2007). In our previous studies, we expressed the same protein in Escherichia coli by cloning the gene into a different vector, pGEX 6p-1 (Liu et al., 2009). The fused protein has a glutathione-S-transferase (GST) tag with high molecular weight of 26 kDa which might have cross-reaction with other unrelated proteins. Therefore, we cloned the truncated pAPN gene into another prokaryotic vector pET-30a that owns T7 lac promoter and has a small tag (6*Histidine) protein. Rosetta host strain used in this study is designed to enhance the expression of eukaryotic proteins that contain rare codons. It supplies tRNAs for AGG, AGA, AUA, CUA, CCC, and GGA codons on a compatible chloramphenicol-resistant plasmid named pRARE, which makes the Rosetta strain a \u201cuniversal\u201d translation where translation would otherwise be limited by the codon usage of E. coli (Novy et al., 2001). Many heterologous proteins have been expressed in this system (Li et al., 2010a, Li et al., 2010b, Meng et al., 2010, Ren et al., 2010a, Ren et al., 2010d). In our study, the high level expression of pAPN was achieved again in this expression system. The pAPN is a glycoprotein and its biological activity is the main concern due to the inability of modification post-translation in E. coli. Previously, we generated an anti-pAPN antibody deriving from a rabbit immunized with pGEX-pAPN. In this study, the bacterially expressed pET-apn protein was detected in Western blot by using the anti-pAPN antibody. At the same time, we confirmed that an antibody against pET-apn protein reacted with transiently expressed pAPN on the eukaryotic cells in immunofluorescence assays and pre-incubation of the antibody with cells significantly decreased cell infection by TGEV (data not shown). Taken together, the data indicate that the pAPN used in this study is biologically active. Interestingly, the expression of pAPN was achieved only if the transmembrane domain located at its N-terminus was deleted. The hydrophilicity and antigen index were analyzed using DNASTAR software, and the results showed that the first 35 amino acids in the N terminus of pAPN are a strong hydrophilicity region and low antigen index (data not shown). The results suggest that the transmembrane domain in the pAPN may affect subsequent translation of pAPN in E. coli.",

            "text": "The application of vaccines is still the major prevention measure for TGEV infection, although pAPN has been identified as a cellular receptor for TGEV (Delmas et al., 1992). The importance of effective peptides in the drug discovery has been noticed due to their apparent ability to \u201chome in\u201d on active or biological sites on target proteins (Yi et al., 2003). It has been found that phage-displayed peptides selected from combinatorial libraries that interacting with viral proteins or receptors were capable of blocking infection by hepatitis B virus (Dyson and Murray, 1995), adenovirus type 2 (Ad2) (Hong and Boulanger, 1995), Andes Virus (ANDV) (Hall et al., 2009), Sin Nombre Virus and Hantaan Virus (Larson et al., 2005). In our study, the immobilized pAPN was used as a target for incubation with the phages from the 12-mer phage display library. The binding phages were eluted after four rounds of panning. The increased binding ability between the phages and the pAPN was indicated by the gradually increased phage titration following each panning. Three peptide sequences were obtained from the ten selected phages. The binding of the peptides to the pAPN protein was somewhat lower than the binding between the pAPN and TGEV, although it was much higher than the control, indicating that there are more epitopes on TGEV necessary for interaction between virion and pAPN. Since the peptides did not react with IBV S protein expressed in the same system, the phages do not have cross-reaction with the His-tag protein. Plaque assays showed that the infectivity of TGEV on the native pAPN-expressing ST cells was decreased by the pre-treatment of the individual peptides. There was a slight difference in the abilities of the peptides to inhibit TGEV infection. Interestingly, the antiviral ability of each of the three peptides was positively correlated with their binding ability to pAPN. In our study, MTT assays confirmed the inhibitory effect of the peptides on TGEV infection. Nonetheless, the proliferation rate of the infected cells was lower than the mock-infected cell, although it was improved by pre-treatment of the peptides. The discrepant results between plaque assays and MTT assays may be partially attributed to: 1) the latter is often used to determine the mitochondrial dehydrogenase activities of cells, which cannot reflect the inhibition of cell death or cell respiration totally; 2) cell apoptosis induced by TGEV may interfere with the MTT results to a certain extent (Eleouet et al., 1998).",

            "text": "It has been documented that four major antigenic sites of TGEV are located in the N-terminal half of the S protein (designated S1) (Delmas et al., 1990). In our study, sequence alignment between the peptides and TGEV S protein indicated that the three peptides have the most homology identity in different regions in the S1 protein. We suppose that the peptide sequences or the counterparts in the S protein should be important receptor binding domains (RBDs) that may interact with its cellular receptor of pAPN. The binding of TGEV S protein to pAPN is required for the initial stage of infection (Delmas et al., 1992). The interaction between the peptides and pAPN was investigated using ELISA and virus plaque assays. Interestingly, the peptides showed an effective binding to pAPN and inhibition to TGEV infection, although their sequences are not completely identical to the homologous regions in the S1 protein. The results confirm that short peptides from combinatorial libraries can act as \u2018surrogate\u2019 ligands of proteins that interact with other proteins if they possess the required critical residues (Geysen et al., 1985, Ruoslahti and Pierschbacher, 1986, Wells, 1996). The peptides can be used as lead compounds for further optimization and consequent enhancement of antiviral activity. In addition to binding to pAPN, TGEV virions treated with neuraminidase can bind via the S protein to N-acetyl neuraminic acid or N-glycolyl neuraminic acid moieties on the cell surface (Krempl et al., 2000, Schultze et al., 1995). It has been proposed that binding to a surface sialoglycoprotein is required for TGEV as a primary attachment site to initiate infection of intestinal cells (Schwegmann-Wessels et al., 2002). Therefore, it would be interesting to screen the ligands of sialoglycoprotein and analyze their roles in the context of TGEV infection. There are no structural data and only limited functional information regarding the spike glycoproteins of coronaviruses in serogroup 1, which includes HCoV-229E, TGEV, FCoV, and CCoV, although they all use APN as a receptor to enter cells (Benbacer et al., 1997, Bonavia et al., 2003, Delmas et al., 1992, Hegyi and Kolb, 1998, Yeager et al., 1992). Therefore, the peptides identified in this study or the high homologous regions in the S proteins could be major RBDs of viral S proteins. The peptides are also expected to be viable alternatives or peptide-based drugs to antibodies in prevention of TGEV infection. In addition, the binding domain of the S protein on its receptor has been mapped starting at amino acid 506 and shown to correspond to the domain recognized by neutralizing antibodies (Godet et al., 1994). In our study, we identified a TxxF by phage display and four TxxF motifs were found in the domain. Interestingly, three such motifs also existed in the other part of the S protein. Further work will be done to analyze the biological role of the identified motif in the S protein.",

S is the only protein that induces antibodies that neutralize in the absence of complement (Godet et al., 1991, Jim\u00e9nez et al., 1986, Pulford and Britton, 1991, Su\u00f1\u00e9 et al., 1990). Investigations of its antigenic structure have led to the identification of four to five major groups of B-cell dependent epitopes, all located in the S1 part of the polypeptide chain (Correa et al., 1990, Delmas et al., 1986, Delmas et al., 1990, Gebauer et al., 1991, Enjuanes et al., 1992, Godet et al., 1994). Another significant achievement of this work is the demonstration that the identified phages bearing the specific peptides in their N-terminal region of major coat protein PVIII may induce specific humoral immune responses and an enhanced cell-medicated immunity. The serum antibody of the immunized mice can react with TGE virions, indicating that the phage displaying specific peptides can mimic the natural epitopes of the S protein. In this study, we included the mixed phages from a 12-mer phage library as control for immunizing the mice. In our binding assays, a relative high background was observed between TGEV and the unrelevant phages. On one hand, we speculate that there are TGEV ligands in the library that we did not identify. On the other hand, the heterologous genes were expressed in the PVIII of the phages. It might be possible that other components of the phages may have binding activity to TGEV. More work is needed to confirm our hypotheses.",

Since the global abundance of phages and our increasing ability to exploit them, further elucidation of mechanisms of phage-mediated immunization may facilitate the rational design of novel phage-based vaccines.

Since many coronaviruses in group I use APN as receptor, the peptides selected in this study may be candidates for their molecule inhibitors.
