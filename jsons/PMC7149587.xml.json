Their teeth and bone structure allow them to gouge tree bark to eat edible plant exudates including gum, sap, and latex [8]. This gouging behavior not only exposes the sappy interior but also stimulates the plant to produce gum, thus resulting in a long-term food source [9], [10]. To better digest the gums, marmosets have a large cecum for their body size, which enables efficient fermentation. They may also be able to preferentially retain liquids (i.e., gums) in the cecum while sending solid food to the colon, and their cecum has extensive folds and pockets that may allow for retention of bacteria to repopulate the upper colon when needed [11].",

Due to limitations in caging and diet formulation, the diet fed to captive marmosets likely does not recapitulate their natural diet, which can lead to nutrient deficiencies, secondary metabolic disorders, or inflammatory disease of the GI system. Care should be taken to avoid feeding diets high in simple sugars, such as glucose. While palatable, these diets can lead to secondary clinical problems, as noted below. While it was historically common to feed mouse pups to marmosets, this should be avoided due to the risk of disease transmission.",

Every investigation should begin with a thorough cageside examination to better understand the animal's temperament, activity level, and overall appearance. From there, a physical examination should be performed and include evaluation of the oral cavity and abdominal palpation. Veterinary staff should become familiar with the normal characteristics of marmosets including the thickness of the gut loops, liver size, and mesenteric lymph node size. Given their small size, it may be possible to perform a basic examination on awake, restrained animals. However, sedation enhances the ease through which abnormalities can be detected on abdominal palpation and reduces the risk of injuries to staff or animals.",

In this form of IBD lymphocytic infiltrates comprising CD3/CD56- positive cells efface the normal architecture resulting in fusion and blunting of villous tips accompanied by crypt hyperplasia. Intense lymphocytic infiltration of the epithelium is observed consistent with an immune-mediated response to environmental or potentially host antigens [41]. Treatment with prednisone and dietary withdrawal of gluten had no effect on the clinical disease. Elimination of Giardia within the colony was associated with a marked reduction in incidence of the disease, suggesting that environmental triggers may initiate a self-perpetuating immune-mediated disease.",
