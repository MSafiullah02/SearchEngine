The first group (control) corresponds to academic years 2017/2018 and 2018/2019. The second group (experimental) corresponds to students from 2019/2020, which is the group of students that interrupted their face-to-face activities because of the confinement. The results show that there is a significant positive effect of the COVID-19 confinement on students' performance. This effect is also significative in activities that did not change their format when performed after the confinement. We find that this effect is significative both in subjects that increased the number of assessment activities and subjects that did not change the workload of students. Additionally, an analysis of students' learning strategies before confinement shows that students did not study in a continuous basis. Based on these results, we conclude that COVID-19 confinement changed students' learning strategies to a more continuous habit, improving their efficiency. For these reasons, better scores in students' assessment are expected due to COVID-19 confinement that can be explained by an improvement in their learning performance.",

Even courses that include all the contents online such as Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) [6 -7] have been also become popular. The inclusion of e-Learning tools in higher education implies that a greater amount of information can be analyzed, improving teaching quality [8 -9 -10] . In recent years, many studies have been performed analyzing the advantages and challenges of massive data analysis in higher education [11] . For example, a study of Gasevic et al [12] indicates that time management tactics had significative correlations with academic performance. Jovanovic et al also demonstrated that assisting students in their management of learning resources is critical for a correct management of their learning strategies in terms of regularity [13] .",

            "text": "Linear tests, which require all students to take the same assessment in terms of the number and order of items during a test session, are among the most common tools used in computer-based testing. Computer adaptive test (CAT), based on item response theory, was formally proposed by Lord in 1980 [24 -25 -26 ] to overcome the shortfalls of the 4 linear test. CAT allows dynamic changes for each test item based on previous answers of the student [27] . More advanced CAT platforms use personalization to individual learner\u00b4s characteristics by adapting questions and providing tailored feedback [28] . Research contains numerous examples of assessment tools that can guide students [29 -30 -31 ] and many advances have been also developed in the theoretical background of CAT [32] . In this aspect, advantages offered by CAT go beyond simply providing a snapshot score [33] , as is the case with linear testing. Some platforms couple the advantages of CAT-specific feedback with multistage adaptive testing [34] . The use of CAT is also increasingly being promoted in clinical practice to improve patient quality of life. Over decades, different systems and approaches based on CAT have been used in the educational space to enhance the learning process [35 -36] . Considering the usage of CAT as a learning tool, establishing the knowledge of the learner is crucial for personalizing subsequent question difficulty. CAT does have some negative aspects such as continued test item exposure, which allows learners to memorize the test answers and share them with their peers [37 -38] . As a solution to limit test item exposure, a large question bank has been suggested. This solution is unfeasible in most cases, since majority of the CAT models already require more items than comparable linear testing [39] .",

The final evaluation is performed by OA-T. In the case of numerical problems, both learning and evaluation use OA-T.

Those tests have been included in the figure as a part of student's autonomous work and must be considered as time of learning; however, will be excluded from score data analysis. There are some effects in the figure that must be considered. First, there are certain scores more repeated than others (2.5, 5 and 7.5), which correspond to a jump in the level (L) (level 1: 0-2.5, level 2: 2.5-5, level 3: 5-7.5 and, level 4: 7.5-10), meaning that students are not able to answer more difficult questions yet. Another effect that can be easily seen in the figure is a region where a huge number of tests had a score -1 (between 600 and 700 approximately). This effect appears because, in those days, teachers asked students to find the most difficult questions in the test. For that reason, students interrupted the tests when they found those questions.",

It is interesting to note that, during stage 3, six more students utilized the system than in stage 2; however, the total attempts reduced between the 2 stages from 123 to 102. This translates to a 23% increase in the average use of the application over time from 1.9 days in stage 2 to 2.4 days in stage 3 combined with a reduction of attempts per student from 9.5 in stage 2, to 5.4 in stage 3. In the earlier stage, fewer students used the application intensively by making multiple attempts a day. Students who logged in at the later stage were more likely to use the application once or twice a day over several days because of the reward related to this behavior. Out of a total sample of 19 students who used the tool in in stage 3, 5 were eliminated by the test as they accessed the tests the same number of days in both stages. Then, for the use of application by the remaining 14 students the W-value was of 15.5, with the critical value of W=25 at p.0.05. Therefore, the result is significant.",

As it can be observed in Fig 8a, the scores obtained by the students in the different activities along the course were consistently similar in both years of the control group, with the only exception of the second activity where there was a slightly decrease in year 2018/2019 (p<0.05). Similarly, the proportion of students with a score\u22655 was very similar in the control group (p>0.05) (Fig 8b) . Therefore, students' performance in the previous 2 years (control group) were not significantly different, allowing us to compare with them the results from 2019/2020. Scores obtained by the students in 2019/2020 academic year before confinement were similar to those obtained by students from the control group, although some differences were found at the beginning of the course (activities number 2, 3 and 4, p<0.05). We think that this could be due to the adaptation of the students to the course and the new assessment methodology, being afterwards similar again. However, after the end of face-to-face teaching and beginning of confinement, students' scores were significantly higher than in the previous academic years (Fig 8a) . Moreover, we also found higher scores and an increase in students that pass the activity number 9, which is a test (Figs 8a and 8b ). In the present academic course (2019/2020), this test has been performed by the students confined at their homes, in contrast to previous years where it was performed in the classroom under the supervision of the tutor. In addition, we have analysed the proportion of students that perform the activities in the different courses (Fig 8c) , finding that this proportion is very similar, with only a difference in one activity.

In both subjects, students work hard only the last days before the final exams. In one subject, we have found that more than 33% of the autonomous work were done the previous 5 days to the final exam. In the other subject, students only used the e-Learning material the last 2 days before the final exam, even when they were provided three weeks in advance. In this study, we have also found that students easily change their learning behavior and study continuously when a reward is offered. This extra motivation dramatically changed their learning strategy and students worked in a much wider time window, increasing their performance. An increasing in the students' performance due to an adequate time management in the learning is well-stablished in the literature [12 -13] .",

First, the confinement is a new scenario that has never been faced by the students. For these reasons, students do not have any previous experience to use as a reference in their learning process. Without any previous reference, students should be confident that they are following the course correctly and therefore, work continuously to be sure that they do not miss any important content. Another interpretation is that they are afraid of missing the academic year because of the COVID-19 confinement and they work harder to overcome any difficulty. Finally, students may be motivated by their intrinsic responsibility in a very confused situation and work hard to contribute as much as they can",

It is worth noting that the 14 academic year for this subject ended in May 21 (final exam). In Fig 4b we show the distribution of attempts betweenFebruary and May. We found 62 in February, which is a low but reasonable number since students do not have yet enough knowledge to face tests properly. They usually start using it at the middle of the month. In March, there is an increase in the number of attempts followed by a slight decrease in April. This difference can be justified by the Easter holidays (one week) in April. The number of attempts strongly increase on May. Even when counting only the first two weeks of the month, we have more attempts than in previous months (292 from May 1-15). In the period of May 16-21, we have recorded 396 attempts (469 if we count the attempts in the final exam). In the inset ofFig 4b weshow the distribution in the last period (May 16-21). As we can see, students used the platform 127 times the day before the exam and 173 times the day of the final exam (95 of studying and 78 in the exam itself). More than 33% of tests were performed the last 6 days before the final exam (and more that 50% of those tests were performed the day before the exam).",

We indicate in the figure the period of the COVID-19 confinement during the 2019/2020 course (from March 11 to March 30). For clarity, we also indicate the equivalent period in the two previous years. As we can see in the figure, the number of tests performed before confinement were similar (225 and 246) in the two previous years (control group), but there is a remarkable increment in the number of tests (328) performed in the experimental group. These differences can be easily explained normalizing these numbers to the number of students each year (97, 73 and 91 respectively). By doing that, we obtain 2.31, 3.37 and 3.6 test/student, respectively. Thus, differences between courses 2018/2019 and 2019/2020 are reduced, although there is still some difference with respect students from course 2017/2018, that can be explained by the fact that some of these students were retaking the subject and, therefore, did not use the e-valUAM application often until the contents were more difficult. If we count the number of tests finished until the end of the academic year in the courses 2017/2018 and 2018/2019, we find 1345 and 1175 tests",
