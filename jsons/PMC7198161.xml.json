Respiratory diseases are known to be one of the leading causes of death worldwide, accounting for more than 10% of all disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) \u2013 an estimate of the amount of active life lost due to a disease [1]. Common respiratory disorders can be grouped into allergic inflammation (e.g. asthma), destructive pathologies, such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and acute lower respiratory infections. Among the chronic respiratory pathological conditions, COPD, asthma and pulmonary fibrosis still lack efficient treatment. Moreover, despite the availability of vaccines and antibiotics, acute lower respiratory tract infections are still the sixth leading cause of death among all diseases, and the first cause of death in children under the age of five [2]. Therefore, understanding the pathophysiology of these respiratory tract diseases is crucial for the development of new therapeutic strategies to decrease or prevent disease burden.",

On the other hand, the overactivation or the excessive recruitment of granulocytes in the lungs could lead to severe injury that may exacerbate the disease or worsen its prognosis (Fig. 1\n). In this regard, several pharmacological approaches targeting the recruitment and/or the function of granulocytes have been suggested and, in many cases, implemented in the management of respiratory diseases.",

The granular content of mature neutrophils include a number of antimicrobial peptides, myeloperoxidase (MPO), the serine proteases proteinase 3 (PR3), cathepsin G, neutrophil elastase (NE), the enzymatic inactive protease cationic antimicrobial protein of 37 kd (CAP37, aka azurocidin) and the neutrophil serine protease 4 (NSP4), cysteine proteases, lactoferrin, lipocalin, metalloproteinases and gelatinase [22]. In health, circulating neutrophils infiltrate the lungs, in a diurnal pattern coordinating physiological surveillance responses [10] and regulating the numbers of alveolar macrophages [19].",

Neutrophil inflammatory chemokine receptors are classically CXCR1 and CXCR2 [24], however, infiltrating neutrophils can increase expression of other receptors such as CCR1, CCR2, CCR3, CCR5, CXCR3, and CXCR4 [25]. Gradients of proinflammatory mediators increase neutrophil stiffness and expression of adhesion molecules, leading to their consequent retention in pulmonary capillary beds and subsequent transmigration to the sites of infection/injury in the lungs [26]. Activated neutrophils degranulate and release antimicrobial peptides and other preformed mediators that mediate pathogen clearance at the site of infection. Additionally, neutrophils can kill potential pathogens by the extrusion of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) and by phagocytosis [20]. Therefore, neutrophils are considered the first line of defence against infections in the lungs [23]. Besides their classical described functions, neutrophils were recently shown to mediate tissue repair [27] and anti-tumour responses [28].",

The granular content of eosinophils includes cationic proteins such as eosinophil cationic protein (ECP, aka RNase3), eosinophil-derived neurotoxin (EDN, also known as RNase2), major basic protein (MBP), eosinophil peroxidase (EPO), hydrolytic enzymes and a diverse repertoire of preformed cytokines, chemokines, and growth factors [36]. Eosinophils are recruited into the lungs mostly in response to IL-5, eotaxin or histamine production [37,38]. Moreover, IL-5 is crucial for the production, maturation and survival of eosinophils [39]. Among the inflammatory chemokine receptors, CCR1 and CCR3 are highly expressed in eosinophils [24]. Historically, eosinophils are thought to promote defences against parasitic infections, through the release of their cytoplasmic granular content. However, some studies have shown that eosinophils can also enhance antiviral responses [40,41] and have immunomodulatory functions [42].",

Eosinophil recruitment and activation in the lungs are associated with asthma severity and, therefore, are targets for the development of therapeutic strategies [43]. Because of the contrasting roles of eosinophils in homeostasis and disease, it has been suggested that different phenotypes are associated to distinct contexts. Indeed, the lungs contain a morphological and functional distinct population of resident eosinophils that are important regulators of the T helper (Th) 2 responses during asthma, in contrast to the inflammatory recruited eosinophils [6]. Thus, new eosinophil-directed therapies are expected to consider targeting selected eosinophil phenotypes that are associated with disease development, rather than with their protective functions.",

Basic pigments such as methylene and toluidine blue stain basophil granules dark purple, in contrast to the blue colour seen with mast cells granules [44]. Basophils constitute a relatively rare population in the bloodstream, thus making them difficult to isolate and study [45]. As such, the immunological roles of basophils have been neglected in comparison to other leukocytes. Basophil recruitment is mainly associated with the activation of CCR2 and CCR3 by inflammatory CCL chemokines (CCL2, CCL5, CCL7, CCL8, CCL11 CCL12, CCL13) [24]. Based on their granular content, basophils share some functions with mast cells. Histamine, chondroitin sulphate, proteolytic enzymes, cysteinyl leukotrienes (cysLTs), PAF and cytokines are released upon basophil activation, and similarly to mast cells, they are related to the pathophysiology of allergies and asthma [46,47]. Moreover, basophils can act as antigen presenting cells and may induce Th2 responses, thus contributing to both the host defence against helminth parasites and chronic allergic inflammation [48].",

While the physiological actions of basophils are poorly described, their contribution to airway diseases, such as asthma, has been relatively more widely explored. Together with mast cells, activated basophils contribute to type 2 inflammation by secretion of cytokines such as IL-5, IL4, IL-13 and thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP), among others [44]. However, basophils can be distinguished from mast cells by not only their morphological characteristics, but also by their tissue distribution, lifespan and ontogeny. In contrast to mast cells, basophils complete their maturation in the bone marrow and are short-lived cells in the circulation (2-3 days), being recruited to the lungs during inflammation [44]. Yet, new approaches of cell isolation and signalling mapping are required in order to shed light on the function of basophils in both health and disease.",

Once expanded in the bone marrow, these progenitors circulate in the bloodstream to become tissue resident cells. In the tissues mast cell progenitors mature under the influence of cytokines, especially by stem cell factor (SCF), the high affinity ligand of the cKit [49]. Mast cells are mostly known to be activated by the immunoglobulin (Ig) E-dependent pathway. However, they can also be stimulated by several IgE-independent triggers that activate different surface receptors, such as toll-like receptors (TLR), G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), complement receptors, lectin receptors and the recently identified human Mas-related G-protein coupled receptor member X2 (MGRX2) [50]. Mast cell chemokine receptors such as CXCR1\u20134, CX3CR1, CCR1, CCR3\u20135 are important for mast cell activation [51]. Upon activation, mast cells degranulate and release highly bioactive mediators that are grouped into three main categories: the granule-associated pre-formed mediators, such as tryptase, chymase, histamine, heparin and TNF-\u03b1; the de-novo synthesized lipid mediators such as LTC4, D4, E4 and B4, platelet activating factor (PAF) and prostaglandin (PG)D2; and last but not least, an array of cytokines and chemokines, including IL-6, IL-8, IL-4, IL-5, IL-10 and eotaxin, among others [52]. While preformed and the lipid mediators are released within minutes, cytokines and chemokines are released several hours after mast cell activation, during the late phase of the response. Notably, depending on a specific stimulus, mast cells can release all kinds of mediator, or they may differentially release certain kinds of mediators [53].",

In addition, there is strong evidence of further mast cell heterogeneity with respect to their receptors, mediators and their consequent functional tissue specificity. For instance, lung mast cells express high levels of TLRs, while skin mast cells exhibit low levels of this class of receptors [54]. Moreover, anti-IgE-mediated activation was recently shown to cause higher release of LTC4 and PGD2 from isolated lung mast cells, compared to their skin, heart and synovial cavity counterparts [55]. On the other hand, substance P, a MRGPRX2 agonist, failed to induce lipid mediator production from lung mast cells and caused no histamine and tryptase release from both lung and heart mast cells, whereas it induced a significant concentration-dependent release of these mediators from skin mast cells [55]. In the lungs, the main population of mast cells is of the MCT type, which is located mainly in the bronchial and bronchiolar lamina propria [54,56]. Mast cells have also been shown to be activated by several respiratory pathogens, such as Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Mycoplasma pneumonia, influenza virus and the respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) [57,58] and were recently shown to act as antigen presenting cells [59]. Thus, in the lungs, mast cells play a dual role: hey contribute to allergic asthma when activated mainly by IgE-mechanisms, and they also seem to be sentinel cells against different lung pathogens.",

Granulocytes play a major role in the development of asthma, and distinct granulocyte populations seem to be associated with particular phenotypes and endotypes. Thus, the inflammatory and immune processes in the allergic phenotype are linked to the recruitment of eosinophils into the airways, a cardinal feature of the Th2 response in the lung [64]. On the other hand, there is a sub-population of asthmatic patients that are considered as non-Th2 immunologic responsive, where neutrophils are the main inflammatory cells involved in the pathogenesis. Additional phenotypes/endotypes of asthma include Th1 skewed responses, Th17-high inflammation, obesity\u2013 and smoking-associated asthma, exercise-induced bronchoconstriction, and the very late-onset asthma that is associated with the decreased function of the ageing lung [44,63].",

            "text": "Allergic asthma is commonly initiated by an inappropriate immune response towards inhaled allergens [65], such as house dust mite, spores, pollens, animal dander, etc. [66]. The exposure of allergens in the airways can activate receptors on the airway epithelium, such as TLRs and PRRs, to initiate allergic responses [67]. This results in the capture and processing of these antigens by dendritic cells in the basement membrane of the airway epithelium, where they mature and migrate to lymph nodes to present the processed antigen to na\u00efve CD4+ T cells [68,69]. The presence of IL-4 drives the differentiation of na\u00efve CD4+ T cells into Th2 cells. Transmigration of eosinophils into the airway involves a cascade of signaling pathways, where the priming and activation of Th2 cells releases cytokines, including IL-5. Besides mediating eosinophil maturation, migration and survival [39], IL-5, in combination with chemokines like eotaxin, adhesion molecules, such as ICAM-1, VCAM-1, E-selectin and the integrin VLA-4, induces eosinophilia in the airways [70,71]. In fact, the pivotal role of IL-5 in asthma has been evidenced in earlier studies in IL-5-deficient mice showing reduced eosinophil trafficking into the airways and decreased AHR [72]. When activated, eosinophils secrete cytotoxic granule proteins like MBP and EPO, which result in the damage of airway epithelial cells and induce histamine release from mast cells and basophils [73]. Besides eliciting damage to the airways directly through the production of granular proteins, studies have shown that eosinophils are the source of LTC4, which, following conversion to LTD4 and LTE4, is involved in the AHR, mucus hypersecretion and bronchoconstriction in asthma [74].",

            "text": "Mast cells and basophils are also involved in the pathogenesis of asthma [48]. The cytokines IL-4 and IL-13, generated mostly from Th2 cells, induce B cells to undergo isotype class switching from IgM to IgE [75]. The interaction between Th2 and B cells (through CD40 \u2013 CD40 L signaling) activates B cells to produce IgE antibodies into the bloodstream, which bind to the high affinity IgE receptors (Fc\u03b5RI) on the surface of mast cells and basophils [76]. When the lungs are re-exposed to the allergen, the resulting IgE-allergen complexes lead to Fc\u03b5RI cross-linking, thus triggering mast cell activation and degranulation [76]. The release of pre-formed histamine and TNF-\u03b1 and the newly-formed arachidonic acid metabolites are largely responsible for the early symptoms of the asthmatic reaction including bronchoconstriction [5,77]. Mast cells also have an active role in the late phase reaction that is mediated via the release of cytokines and chemokines [78]. Another type of histamine-producing cell would be the basophil, although it is not as prominent as mast cells in the IgE-driven responses that is characteristic of allergic asthma [79]. Basophils produce cytokines IL-4 and IL-13 that contribute to the shift towards Th2 inflammation in asthma [80]. While there is evidence showing that the lifespan of basophil can be extended by the binding of IgE to the Fc\u03b5RI [81], the full extent of basophil contribution to innate immunity and asthma remains to be elucidated.",

Neutrophils can attract eosinophils through IL-8 (or via CXCL1/2 in mice), and induce eosinophil degranulation by secreting neutrophilic lactoferrin and elastase [84]. In addition, augmented levels of IL-17 were shown to correlate with increased neutrophil recruitment and disease severity in asthma patients [85]. Matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-9 is primarily produced by neutrophils and also promotes eosinophil migration and airway remodeling [86].

They are effective bronchodilators, but they are unable to suppress the ongoing airway inflammation. Short-acting \u03b22-agonists (SABA) provide short-term relief (onset of action in 5 min, duration 4-6 h), while long-acting \u03b22-agonists (LABA) deliver a longer (more than 12 h) bronchodilation [62]. The reduction of AHR by LABA without abating the airway inflammation, leads to false perception of controlling the disease, and result in uncontrolled progression of the inflammatory process [95].",

ICS reduce inflammation-associated leukocyte infiltration into the airways and suppress airway inflammation, thus leading to asthma relief and more effective management of the disease [62,96]. Although ICS suppress airway inflammation, they do not cure the disease. Another major drawback is the development of resistance against ICS in a subset of patients, which necessitates the use of higher doses, and, eventually, oral CS administration is needed to systemically suppress the uncontrolled inflammation [62,97,98]. Prolonged oral CS treatment is not ideal due to their numerous side effects, including water retention, lipid and cortisol metabolism dysfunction, cataracts, glaucoma, osteoporosis and increased risk of opportunistic infections [62,96]. It is of note that approximately 10% of the asthmatic patients respond poorly or do not respond to CS at all, accounting for about 50% of the total healthcare cost in managing asthma [99].",

While CysLT1 receptor antagonists display clinical improvements in asthmatic symptoms and lung function, they are less effective than ICS. However, they are still in use, as they are orally effective, have less unwanted side effects than CS, and provide an alternative treatment for patients who are resistant to CS [101]. Furthermore, it was recently shown that the activation of the epithelial P2Y receptors can induce bronchoconstriction, whereas montelukast acts as an antagonist for the P2Y6 receptor, suggesting an additional potential action of montelukast in asthma [102].",

Both antibodies neutralize circulating IL-5 and inhibit its binding to the IL-5 receptor (IL-5R), thus resulting in decreased blood eosinophils to be trafficked to the lungs. They were initially shown to be ineffective in clinical trials of unselected asthma patients but they proved effective against placebo when patients with severe eosinophilic asthma were selected [104,105]. Both drugs were approved by the FDA and EMA in 2015 and 2016, respectively. In addition, instead of targeting IL-5 itself, benralizumab is a humanized mAb that binds to the IL-5R\u03b1 subunit on human eosinophils and basophils and blocks ligand-independent IL-5R signaling. It also acts via antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC) and consequently depletes IL-5R\u03b1-expressing cells [106]. Several Phase IIb and III clinical trials had shown the clinical efficacy of benralizumab in reducing exacerbations and controlling severe asthma [107,108], prior to its approval by the FDA in 2017 and by the EMA in 2018 for the treatment of patients with severe eosinophilic asthma.",

It was hypothesized that targeting IL-4 and/or IL-13 would benefit the downregulation of type 2 inflammation, eosinophils trafficking, and AHR [109,110].While both IL-4 and IL-13 can activate the heterodimeric IL-4R complexes, IL-4 preferentially binds to the IL-4R\u03b1 subunit and regulates Th2 function and IgE class switching, whereas IL-13 induces chemokines for the recruitment of eosinophils into the lungs [76,93]. The anti-IL-4 mAb pascolizumab showed some promise in preclinical studies [111], but it was not further developed due to lack of clinical benefit in a pilot study in patients with symptomatic steroid-naive asthma (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT00024544). In addition, pitrakinra (Aerovant) is a recombinant human IL-4 variant that binds to the IL-4R\u03b1 subunit and acts as a dual IL-4/IL-13 antagonist, it was initially reported to lack efficacy in a clinical trial that recruited not fully controlled asthmatic patients with ICS and LABA (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT00801853). Yet, further analysis revealed that pitrakinra was able to reduce asthma exacerbations in selected trial participants with eosinophilic asthma (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT00801853). Similarly, the fully human anti-IL-4R\u03b1 mAb AMG 317 also failed to demonstrate clinical efficacy across the entire group of patients with moderate to severe asthma in a Phase II clinical trial [112]. On the other hand, dupilumab, a human mAb targeting the IL-4R\u03b1 subunit, blocking both IL-4 and IL-13 pathways, and approved since 2017 for the treatment of moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis, has been shown to reduce exacerbations and to improve lung function in patients with uncontrolled asthma [113]. Being effective in asthmatic patients that had withdrawn ICS and LABA [114], dupilumab was approved by FDA and EMA in 2018 and 2019, respectively as add-on maintenance therapy for patients with severe uncontrolled asthma characterized by raised blood eosinophils.",

Interestingly, patients with higher serum levels of the matricellular protein periostin that may be implicated in asthma pathophysiology, responded better to lebrikizumab than the patients with low periostin levels [115]. The drug was eventually discontinued when another phase III trial displayed lack of efficacy in reducing asthma exacerbations in patients. Lebrikizumab was repositioned by being granted Fast Track designation by the FDA in 2019 for the treatment of atopic dermatitis.

Of note, eosinophils, neutrophils, mast cells and lung epithelial cells express SPM receptors being able to produce and respond to these molecules [120]. A proper resolution of inflammation assures the reduction of secretion of pro-inflammatory mediators and recruitment of granulocytes while increases clearance of apoptotic cells and induces tissue repair responses [119]. Severity of asthma has been correlated with reduction in the levels of SPMs in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid of patients [121] and treatment strategies that induce resolution have been protective in several preclinical studies by decreasing eosinophil counts in the lungs and preventing degranulation of mast cells [[121], [122], [123]].",

COPD continues to be a leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide, with an estimated prevalence of 328 million people already being the third leading cause of death worldwide [125]. Neutrophils are the major contributor to the pathogenesis of COPD in which heightened airway neutrophilia is observed in patients, correlating very well with disease severity [32]. This could in part be due to the proteases released by neutrophils that can cause host damage and lead to emphysema [126]. Smoking can release both GM-CSF and granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) from epithelial cells and macrophages, which can stimulate granulocyte production, release and survival [127]. Neutrophils in the peripheral blood bind to endothelial cells via E-selectin and are drawn to the airway by neutrophil chemoattractants, such as CXC ligand-1 (CXCL1), CXCL5, CXCL8 and LTB4 [124]. Secreted granule proteins and serine proteases from neutrophils contribute towards alveolar destruction, inflammation and oxidative stress. Cathepsin G, NE and PR3 have also been reported to contribute towards mucus hypersecretion [128,129]. NETs secreted by activated neutrophils, contain histones, NE and MPO, and are found to be excessive in COPD patients, contributing to disease progression [130].",

This was further validated in mice nebulized with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and immediately given Tyrphostin AG825 via i.p., in which Tyrphostin AG825 increased percentage of neutrophil apoptosis [131]. Matrine, a bioactive component of Sophora flavescens Ait (Kushen), was administered daily via gavage in mice exposed to 4 days of cigarette smoke. Matrine was observed to reduce lung neutrophilia and NE activity, mainly through the apoptosis of neutrophils [132]. AZD8999, a novel muscarinic acetylcholine receptor antagonist and \u03b22-adrenoceptor agonist (MABA), was shown to inhibit IL-8, IL-1\u03b2 and MMP-9 release from human peripheral blood neutrophils stimulated with LPS [133]. AZD5069, a chemokine (C-X-C motif) receptor 2 (CXCR2) antagonist, was shown to reduce NET formation and levels of IL-8/CXCL-8 in sputum and blood neutrophils isolated from COPD patients [134]. Galectin (Gal)-9, a beta-galactoside lectin protein, was able to reduce the number of neutrophils and the levels of MMP-2 and MMP-9 in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) in a porcine pancreatic elastase (PPE)-induced emphysema model.

According to the Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study (GBD), pneumonia and bronchiolitis are considered as LTRI, which caused nearly 2.38 million deaths in 2016 [1]. The broad spectrum of pathogens that can cause LTRI \u2013bacteria, viruses and/or fungi- in addition to the crescent antibiotic resistance rates, create challenges for the diagnosis, prevention and treatment of these diseases [147]. Moreover, the pathogenesis of respiratory infections involves a complex interplay between pathogen virulence factors and the host defense responses. Treatment guidelines for LRTI vary among countries, but in general, the recommendation is the use of different pharmacological classes of antimicrobial agents depending on the etiology and severity [147]. Of note, in severe cases of LRTI, antibiotic therapy does not reduce mortality as the exuberant inflammatory responses triggered in the lungs, rather than pathogen proliferation, lead to severe lung injury and respiratory failure [148]. Therefore, the immune responses triggered by infection must be efficient, yet regulated, to assure proper pathogen clearance and minimum tissue damage.",

Potential pathogens that evade the physical barriers of the respiratory tract and reach the lungs, will be detected by immune and non-immune resident cells via PRRs that bind to microbial associated molecular patterns (MAMPs) [149]. Different families of PRRs, such as TLRs, nucleotide-binding and oligomerization-domain proteins, and caspase-recruitment domain helicases recognize several MAMPs of any one microbe. Activation of signaling pathways by PRRs converge to the transcription of several pro-inflammatory genes as adhesion molecules, chemokines and other cytokines. The production of pro-phlogistic mediators culminates with the recruitment of leukocytes into the airways, specially neutrophils [150]. The recruitment of these cells into the airways occurs rapidly, and is mediated by the chemokine gradient produced by activated lung epithelial cells, macrophages and dendritic cells [33]. At the site of infection, neutrophils mediate important host defense functions such as phagocytosis of microorganisms, production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), antimicrobial peptides and proteases, and extrusion of NETs. The crucial role of neutrophils is evidenced by the higher susceptibility of patients to lung infections with deficits in neutrophil quantity (neutropenia) or defects in function (chronic granulomatous disease) [151,152]. Furthermore, neutrophils were shown to be important for the development of adaptive immune responses following viral lung infections [153].",

In other viral lung infections, such as the one caused by RSV, neutrophils are related to severe bronchiolitis, tissue injury and correlated with disease severity [157,158]. On the other hand, the depletion of neutrophils before or during the early-stages of an ongoing viral infection, leads to increased proliferation of the virus which contributes to higher morbidity and mortality [159]. The complex, often contrasting functions of neutrophils during respiratory viral infections are also highlighted by their putative dual contribution in the pulmonary inflammatory responses in rats infected with the rat coronavirus (rCoV)[160], as well as by the identification of the high ratio of neutrophils to lymphocytes as an independent risk factor for severe pneumonia during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic [161,162].

Similarly, bacterial and fungal pulmonary infections are often associated with a pronounced recruitment of neutrophils. The accumulation and over activation of these cells impair the gaseous exchange in the lungs and increase cell wall disruption [165]. Interestingly, the unregulated inflammatory responses in the lungs can result in bacteria overgrowth and dissemination [166,167].

However, associative and clinical studies evaluating the impact of these drugs are not consistent, as larger number of patients is required for clearer results. Based on their pleiotropic anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory effects, HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors were tested as potential therapies for severe pneumonia [172,173]. In experimental models of pulmonary infection, statins were shown to diminish lung injury, neutrophilic inflammation and improve survival, with greater response when combined with antibiotics [174]. However, numerous retrospective clinical studies have obtained conflicting results while evaluating the impact of statins on respiratory tract infections. While most of these studies observed some beneficial effects of statins on pneumonia severity [[175], [176], [177], [178]], others found no significant disease improvement in the treated group against placebo [179]. Of note, while the reduced recruitment of neutrophils into the lungs after treatment with statins might decrease post-infection lung injury [180], changes in neutrophil function, rather than numbers, were shown to be crucial for the beneficial role of statins during pneumonia. A recent clinical trial showed that treatment of pneumonia patients with HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors was protective by improving neutrophil function and chemotaxis [181]. Unfortunately, it is unclear whether the protective effects observed would be seen in other populations (such as young adults, or patients taking statins chronically). In addition, the treatment schedules, route of administrations and the potential interactions of drugs used to treat pneumonia (such as clarithromycin) are of concern [182].",

Preclinical studies have shown that inhibition of CXCR2 during influenza infection reduced neutrophil numbers in the airways, and prevented lung injury and mortality, with additive effects when combined with antiviral drugs [191,192]. Phase II clinical studies were recently completed, and safety was not compromised since the viral clearance was not impaired.

Targeting specific neutrophil functions, rather than completely blocking their recruitment, might yield some benefit. In this regard, inhibiting NET release [194] or neutrophil serine proteases [195] have been shown to attenuate the deleterious role of inflammation during pneumonia. In addition, induction of resolution of inflammation has been pointed as a remarkably interesting strategy to reduce disease severity during pneumonia [119]. One pivotal feature of immunoresolvents is enhancing antimicrobial responses while modulating neutrophilic inflammation, therefore, the harmful immunosuppression caused by anti-inflammatory drugs is prevented [196]. Annexin A1 and SPMs such as lipoxins and resolvins have been shown to be protective during viral and bacterial pneumonia reducing neutrophil recruitment and activation while preventing lung damage [[197], [198], [199], [200]]. Of interest, part of the immunomodulatory effects of statins might be related to SPM induction [201]. In order to effectively translate these findings to new therapeutics development, proof of concept studies in humans are necessary.",

The heightened eosinophilia observed in the lungs of RSV infected patients is correlated with both airway obstructions and severity of the disease. In this aspect, therapies targeting eosinophils are proposed to control airway hyperresponsiveness post-RSV infection [210]. Such strategies intend to control asthma symptoms that may arise after infection and were discussed before.

Mast cells express several PRRs that enable their activation following viral or bacterial infections in the lungs [145]. The antimicrobial peptides of mast cells granules enhanced the killing of Klebsiella pneumoniae [212] and Streptococcus pneumoniae [213]. Interestingly, mast cells can indirectly execute phagocytosis of bacteria by secreting cytokines such as TNF-\u03b1 and IL-6, which recruit neutrophils and macrophages during pulmonary infections [145]. Moreover, human peripheral blood-derived mast cells have been shown to be activated to release type 1 interferons by several viruses including the influenza virus [214]. Conversely, it was also shown that activation of mast cells may be linked to the immunopathology observed during IAV infection [215]. Considering the limited information of mast cells involvement in LTRI, more studies that assess mast cells role in severe pulmonary infections are needed.",

The different granule content of these immune cells is strongly related to their diverse role in host defense processes, where proteases, histamine and antimicrobial agents are released after activation of granulocytes; mediators that are important in killing the potential pathogens and induce repair mechanisms at the site of injury. However, exaggerated recruitment or activation of these granulocytes, and their consequent degranulation, leads to amplification of the inflammatory response and bystander tissue injury (Fig. 2). Therefore, the knowledge gathered regarding the role of granulocytes in health and disease has led to the development of therapeutic strategies that target specific features of granulocyte biology.",

Allergens, pollutants, or potential pathogens are recognized by the resident pulmonary cells (e.g. epithelial cells and macrophages) and can initiate a significant inflammatory response that, if uncontrolled, leads to tissue damage and respiratory failure. Therapeutics targeting granulocyte recruitment and function are powerful strategies in controlling different respiratory diseases (Table 1\n). It is important to account the unique aspects of the pathophysiology of each respiratory disease during drug development. Of note, the immunosuppression of patients when treated with CSs increases susceptibility to secondary infections and impair tissue repair [217,218], but may be protective in some specific contexts [219,220]. There are different phenotypes of granulocytes that might be related to distinct pathological conditions or may not even be associated to the induction of disease. Thus, the effectiveness of any drug might rely on the responses of a given phenotype to that particular intervention and does not guarantee the same results in other inflammatory diseases.",
