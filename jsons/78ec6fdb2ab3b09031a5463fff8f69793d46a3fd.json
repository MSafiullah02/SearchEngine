In view of the global character of mRNA modification, RNA epigenetics arose as a new field of molecular biology.

Because mRNA accounts for only a minor proportion of total cell RNA, m 6 A detection in mRNA is rather problematic. By 2005, specific adenosine methylation sites were found only in two RNAs, the bovine prolactin (bPRL) mRNA [15, 16] and Rous sarcoma virus (RSV) RNA [17] . In the bPRL mRNA, methylation sites cluster in the 3' untranslated region (3' UTR) and in the vicin ity of the polyadenylation site. The m 6 A occurrence in the methylation sites is only ~20%. More than ten methylation sites were identified in the RSV RNA. Like with the bPRL mRNA, methylation of the RSV RNA is incomplete, varying from 20 to 90%. A muta tion analysis of the adenosine methylation sites in vitro and in vivo established the specific site sequence, RRm 6 ACH (where R is adenosine or guanosine and H is adenosine, uridine, or cytidine) [18] . Statistically, the sequence can be found in every 85 nt, so that approximately 30 adenosine methylation sites may occur in mRNA on average. Because m 6 A was not detected in all of the potential sites in the bPRL mRNA and RSV RNA, their adenosine methylation was not assumed to proceed quantitatively.",

In 2012, m 6 A seq [1] and MeRIP seq [2] were developed to detect m 6 A in RNA with a high sensitiv ity. The gist of the method is as follows (Fig. 1b) . Poly adenylated RNAs are chemically cleaved into frag ments of approximately 50-100 nt. Fragmented RNA is divided into two portions. One is used for immuno precipitation with anti m 6 A antibodies to obtain a modification enriched fraction, and the other serves as a reference. Both of the portions are subject to deep sequencing. The m 6 A positions are identified by com paring the sequencing results for the two portions. Many RNAs proved to contain m 6 A in the well known context [18] . Generally, m 6 A is found mostly around the stop codon of the mRNA coding region. The sig nificance of this arrangement remains unclear. The m 6 A distribution differs among different tissues and in tissues exposed to stress. A virtually unique adenosine methylation profile is therefore characteristic of each cell type.",

RNA from cells with the inactivated gene for methyltransferase responsible for adenosine modifica tion (which is impossible with mammalian cells because a METTL3 knockdown leads to apoptosis) and several RNAs synthesized in vitro were used as negative controls.

A comparison of the differential melting curves for the control modification free duplex and a test sample reports whether m 6 A occurs in the given RNA site. The method can be used, for example, to identify the genes for methyltransferase that modifies a certain nucleotide. In the case of eukaryotic mRNAs, the method is suitable for probing the adenosine methylation status in a particular site of a particular RNA in various cell growth conditions. A method known as site specific cleavage and radioactive labeling followed by ligation assisted extrac tion and thin layer chromatography (SCARLET) [23] makes it possible to establish whether adenosine is methylated in a given position of a given molecule and to estimate the proportion of modified and unmodi fied nucleotides (Fig. 2) . In this method, a specific chimeric 2' O Me/2' H oligonucleotide is con structed and hybridized to the polyadenylated RNA fraction. The target RNA site is cleaved with RNase H to produce two RNA fragments so that the target ade nosine is at the 5' end of one of the fragments. The remaining RNA is phosphorylated to add [ 32 P] to the 5' ends of RNA fragments, and the fragment of interest is ligated to a long single stranded oligodeox yribonucleotide. The mixture is digested with RNases A and T1, which together cleave ssRNA after C, U, and G. The oligodeoxyribonucleotide with 32 P A/m 6 A, which remains intact, is purified by denaturing electrophore sis and digested with nuclease P1, which cleaves ssDNA and RNA to 5' monophosphates. The result ing sample is assayed for [ 32 P]A and [ 32 P] m 6 A by thin layer chromatography. The method is rather laborious and requires a radioactive label to be used.",

YTHDF2 binding with m 6 A containing oligori bonucleotides is ~15 times more efficient than with nonmodified oligonucleotides in vitro. YTHDF3 and YTHDF1 similarly bind the modified nucleotide in vitro with a 5 to 20 fold higher efficiency. More than 3000 YTHDF2 targets were found in human cell lines, and the majority of the targets occur in mRNA. YTHDF2 competes with ribosomes for mRNA bind ing in the cytoplasm. YTHDF2 bound mRNA is committed to degradation. Thus, YTHDF2 acts as a sorter of m 6 A containing mRNAs. When free ribo somes are available, mRNA binds with them and is translated; otherwise, YTHDF2 binds with mRNA and relocates it to a degradation site.",

Mettl3 and Mettl14 knockdowns reduce the m 6 A content in embryonic stem cells, thus decreasing their proliferative activity and inducing a loss of pluripotency markers; i.e., the effect is promot ing stem cell differentiation [40] . It is possible that methylation of the mRNAs coding for differentiation regulators facilitates their degradation in control stem cells. In contrast, a more recent study showed that complete Mettl3 silencing in mouse stem cells increased their self renewal potential and blocked their differentiation into cardiomyocytes and neurons [43] . Similar results were obtained when Mettl3 was inactivated via a Mettl3 knockdown rather than RNA interference [44] . Mettl3 knockout stem cells were via ble and proliferated normally, but their differentiation was distorted. When differentiation was induced, the cells still expressed genes characteristic of pluripotent stem cells. The effect was associated with stabilization of the mRNAs coding for pluripotency markers. Thus, it is commonly accepted that methylation destabilizes mRNA, but it remains unclear what mRNAs are more prone to methylation and destabilization in early development.",

The Aza IP method is based on a covalent bond ing of a cytosine analog (5 azacytosine) incorporated in nascent RNA with m 5 C methyltransferase (Fig. 4a) . 5 Azacytidine is not methylated, and the methyltrans ferase cysteine residues remains linked to the hetero cycle. The crosslinking is followed by immunoprecip itation and high throughput sequencing [54] . With this method, many tRNAs and noncoding RNAs were identified as NSUN2 substrates. A high frequency of the C \u2192 G transition was observed for presumably methylated C residues, helping to recognize specifi cally methylated cytidines in RNA targets. It is thought that C is incorporated in place of G during replication or reverse transcription because of cycle opening [58] (Figs. 4b, 4c ).",

After methylation, NSUN2 Cys271 plays a role in cleaving the enzyme-RNA covalent bond. The C271A muta tion of NSUN2 stabilizes the covalent RNA-protein intermediate, and a method taking advantage of this circumstance was used in place of iCLIP to identify the NSUN2 targets at a single nucleotide resolution. With this method, NSUN2 was found to methylate tRNAs, mRNAs, and noncoding RNAs [49, 52] . The two methods will find application in studying m 5 C methyltransferases.",

Bisulfite sequencing of the HeLa cell transcriptome showed that m 5 C accumulates in untranslated regions and that mRNA cytidine methy lation sites occur in the vicinity of binding sites for Argonaute, a major component of the miRNA/RISC complex [3] . The finding implicates m 5 C in miRNA mediated RNA degradation. The hypothesis is at vari ance with the fact that mRNAs identified as NSUN2 targets by miCLIP do not change in expression in the absence of NSUN2 [49, 52] ; i.e., an effect of m 5 C on mRNA stability is still unproven. It is of interest that noncoding vault RNA (vtRNA) is methylated by NSUN2 according to miCLIP data. When its m 5 C is lost, vtRNA is abnormally processed to small vtRNAs (svRNAs), which act as miRNAs to affect expression of several genes [49, 52] . Two long noncoding RNAs, HOTAIR and XIST, were found to contain m 5 C in the functional regions responsible for interactions with a complex of chromatin associated proteins or in the vicinity of these regions. There is evidence that m 5 C is capable of disrupting certain protein-protein interac tions in vitro [63] . PSEUDOURIDINE Pseudouridine (\u03a8), which is also termed the \"fifth nucleotide,\" was the first modified nucleotide discov ered in RNA almost 60 years ago [64] . Pseudouridine is found in many cell RNAs, from tRNAs and rRNAs to various small nuclear RNAs [65] . Such a broad dis tribution in RNAs indicates that pseudouridine is important for the cell function.",

The \u03a8 proportion in yeast mRNA considerably increases in heat shock [5, 6] . A total of 265 new pseudouridylation sites were identified, and the majority of them proved to be mod ified in heat shock by PUS7 pseudouridine synthase, like \u03a8 residues in the U2 snRNA [5] . The pseudou ridylation level is approximately doubled in nutrient defi ciency [4] . The majority of nucleotides subject to regu lated isomerization are isomerized only in the presence of active PUS1 and PUS7. Apart from PUS family pro teins, CBF5 is responsible for pseudouridylation of certain uridine residues, and its activity is stress inde pendent [5] . Pseudouridine synthases were found not only in yeast, but also in human cells, and transcrip tome wide mapping of pseudouridine residues in RNA was carried out for human cells growing in nor mal conditions [4, 5] . A total of 353 pseudouridylation sites were detected in mRNA, and the majority of them were DKC1 dependent. As for mRNA, 68 sites were observed in normal conditions and 92 sites, after 24 h serum starvation [4] .",
