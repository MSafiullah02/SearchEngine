High replication efficiency, broad tissue tropism and systemic replication seem to determine the pathogenicity of H5N1 viruses in animals3,4,5. To examine the relevance of these viral properties in the context of human disease, we carried out virological analyses in respiratory and non-respiratory specimens of 18 previously healthy individuals with influenza H5N1 who were admitted to referral hospitals in Ho Chi Minh City during the years 2004 and 2005, of whom 13 died. (Table 1). For comparison, we studied eight patients who were hospitalized during the same period with human influenza H3N2 or H1N1. These patients presented earlier in the course of illness (Table 1), which may be explained by their origin from Ho Chi Minh City or neighboring provinces, in contrast with H5N1 patients who were mostly from more distant provinces.",

            "text": "Despite their presentation late in the course of illness, we were able to isolate virus from pharyngeal specimens of 12 of 16 H5N1-infected individuals (Table 2). Genetic characterization and phylogenetic analysis revealed that all viral strains were of the genotype Z, H5N1 sublineage of viruses prevalent in Vietnam, Cambodia and Thailand, as previously reported10. Pairwise comparison of all gene segments of viruses isolated from eight fatal and four surviving cases did not reveal unique amino acid changes in either group. No viruses contained Glu92 in the NS1 protein, which is associated with increased virulence of H5N1 viruses6, but all contained the recently reported PDZ-domain ligand ESEV11. An E627K substitution in the viral polymerase basic protein 2 (PB2), which is associated with adaptation and virulence of H5N1 viruses in mammals12, was present in five of eight isolates from fatal cases and in three of four isolates from patients who survived. There was no association between the presence of Lys627 and clinical outcome (data not shown). Notably, three of four viruses without this substitution, but none of the viruses containing Lys627, contained an D701N substitution in PB2 that has been associated with adaptation of H7N7 viruses to mammalian cells13. This suggests that the D701N substitution may compensate for the absence of Lys627 in conferring enhanced viral polymerase activity and virulence in the mammalian host. Other amino-acid residues in the viral polymerase complex implicated in mammalian adaptation13, including Pro13 in polymerase basic protein 1 (PB1) and Arg615 in polymerase acidic protein (PA), were present in all viruses. These observations are in agreement with recent studies demonstrating the importance of the viral polymerase complex for H5N1 virulence in mammals14.",

Tracheal aspirates obtained from two patients during the course of illness showed more prolonged detection of viral RNA and at substantially higher levels as compared with corresponding nasopharyngeal swabs (Supplementary Fig. 2 online). Particularly in the pharynx, viral RNA levels were higher in H5N1-infected individuals than in individuals infected with human influenza H3N2 or H1N1, despite presentation later in the course of the illness (Table 2 and Supplementary Fig. 1). The highest viral RNA levels occurred in H5N1-infected individuals who died (Table 2), suggesting that the level of viral replication influences outcome. Viral RNA could also be detected in blood specimens from 9 of 16 H5N1-infected individuals and in the rectal swabs from 5 of 7 of these individuals (Table 2). It remains unclear whether the detection of virus in rectal specimens reflects genuine gastrointestinal infection. However, symptoms of diarrhea frequently occur during influenza H5N1 (refs. 1,2,15) and were present in three of the five individuals with detectable viral RNA in the rectum. No viral RNA was present in the blood of surviving H5N1-infected individuals or in those with human influenza. Individuals with detectable H5N1 RNA in blood also had higher pharyngeal viral loads (median 7.4 log10 copies per ml; range 5.1\u20137.4) than those without evidence of H5N1 RNA (6.0 log10 copies per ml; range 4.3\u20137.0; P = 0.021), suggesting that the presence of viral RNA in blood reflects an overall high viral burden.",

The failure to isolate virus from remaining non-respiratory specimens (Table 2) could suggest that the viral RNA does not necessarily reflect replicating virus, but may also reflect relatively low viral loads, loss of replication-competent virus during storage and limitations in the sensitivity of viral culture. The recent isolation of H5N1 virus from the plasma of a patient from Thailand17 confirmed that viremia can occur. Although viremia indicates the potential of the H5N1 virus to disseminate systemically, it remains unclear whether virus replication commonly occurs in non-respiratory organs. Postmortem examinations have not shown evidence of extrapulmonary infection, but revealed reactive hemophagocytosis (which is believed to be a cytokine-driven condition) as the most prominent feature18,19. In vitro and animal experiments also implicate cytokine dysregulation in H5N1 pathogenesis, as characterized by evasion of the antiviral effects of interferons and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-\u03b16, in addition to induction of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines by H5N1 viruses7,8,9.",

Measurement of peripheral blood lymphocyte counts in a subset of our subjects showed low total and CD3+ lymphocyte counts and inverted ratios of CD4+ to CD8+ cells in H5N1-infected individuals, particularly in those who died (Supplementary Table 1 online). Total and CD3+ lymphocyte numbers in H5N1-infected individuals correlated inversely with pharyngeal viral RNA load (Fig. 1a,b), suggesting an association between lymphopenia and the level of viral replication. In addition to decreased production of lymphocytes (as suggested by bone marrow hypoplasia reported in one individual18), or increased destruction through apoptosis (as suggested by in vitro and mouse experiments with H5N1 viruses20,21), peripheral blood lymphopenia may result from trafficking of lymphocytes to infected tissue. However, postmortem studies in H5N1-infected individuals have not shown a predominance of lymphocytes, but instead of macrophages, in pulmonary infiltrates19. The latter observation is in agreement with the chemokine profile that was measured in peripheral blood of the individuals in this study (Table 3): levels of IP-10, MIG and MCP-1 (chemoattractants of monocytes and macrophages that are produced in bronchial epithelial cells and alveolar macrophages9,22,23) were elevated in patients with avian and human subtypes of influenza, but were higher in H5N1-infected individuals and particularly high in those who died (Table 3). Levels of the neutrophil chemoattractant interleukin (IL)-8 were also elevated in H5N1-infected individuals, particularly in those who died (Table 3). This chemokine is produced by bronchial epithelial cells and may function in the pathogenesis of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS)24, which may be particularly relevant to H5N1 influenza, as progression to respiratory failure is associated with development of ARDS15.",

Although levels of cytokines in lung tissue may be more relevant to pathogenesis than levels in blood25, it is likely that blood cytokine levels reflect the events in the highly vascular lung. In vitro infection of bronchial epithelial cells and macrophages with H5N1 viruses is associated with hyperinduction of chemokines and cytokines, suggesting that intrinsic viral properties may contribute to the increased levels and to pathogenesis. However, plasma levels of IP10, MCP-1, IL-8, IL-6 and IL-10 in our subjects correlated with pharyngeal H5N1 load (Fig. 1c\u2013g), which indicates that the observed hypercytokinemia and hyperchemokinemia reflect, at least partly, increased viral replication.",

The seemingly limited clinical efficacy of antiviral treatment of H5N1 influenza may be due to the inability of antivirals to interfere with the sequence of events leading to the observed hypercytokinemia, and associated complications, when treatment is started late in the course of illness. Although immunomodulatory treatment has potential benefits at this stage, the focus of clinical management should be on preventing the intense cytokine response by early diagnosis and effective antiviral treatment.",

We sequenced all gene segments from all viruses completely, with the exception of PA of Vietnam/CL2/04 and PB2 of Vietnam/CL17/04 (owing to technical difficulties). From the latter we obtained a partial sequence encompassing residue 627. Sequence fragments were assembled and edited with Lasergene (version 6.0; DNASTAR). Alignments and residue analyses were performed in BioEdit version 7. MrModeltest 2.2 was used to determine the appropriate DNA substitution model for constructing neighbor-joining trees in PAUP* 4.0. The sequences of all eight gene segments were compared pairwise between viruses isolated from patients who died and those who survived.",
