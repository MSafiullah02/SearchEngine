            "text": "Intramuscular (IM) immunization is generally considered incapable of generating a protective mucosal immune response. In the swine industry, attempts to develop a safe and protective vaccine for controlling porcine epidemic diarrhea (PED) via an IM route of administration have been unsuccessful. In the present study, porcine chemokine ligand proteins CCL25, 27, and 28 were constructed and stably expressed in the mammalian expression system. IM co-administration of inactivated PEDV (iPEDV) particles with different CC chemokines and Freund's adjuvants resulted in recruiting CCR9+ and/or CCR10+ inflammatory cells to the injection site, thereby inducing superior systemic PEDV specific IgG, fecal IgA, and viral neutralizing antibodies in pigs. Moreover, pigs immunized with iPEDV in combination with CCL25 and CCL28 elicited substantial protection against a virulent PEDV challenge. We show that the porcine CC chemokines could be novel adjuvants for developing IM vaccines for modulating mucosal immune responses against mucosal transmissible pathogens in pigs.",

On the other hand, the CCL25/TECK expressed by mucosal epithelial cells can chemo-attract CCR9+ cells and support CCR9 expression leukocytes to migrate to the small intestine [30, 31] . The application of CCL27 and CCL25 as an adjuvant in DNA vaccines was proven to enhance systemic and/or mucosal immune responses following IM injection in mice or macaques [32, 33] . Therefore, the incorporation of these CC chemokines as immune trafficking signals could be a potential strategy for the development of effective parenteral PEDV vaccine regimens.",

PEDV strains cause porcine epidemic diarrhea (PED), characterized by vomiting, severe diarrhea, and dehydration in seronegative pigs at all ages, with high mortality in suckling pigs [3] . Many attempts have been made to develop a safe and protective vaccine for controlling PED [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] . However, similar to studies on most enterotropic and mucosal transmissible viral diseases [11] [12] [13] [14] , using intramuscular (IM) administration of inactive or subunit vaccines combined with commercial adjuvants, such as multiple emulsions of water/oil/water or a B subunit of Escherichia coli heat-labile enterotoxin (LTB) induced production of systemic IgG and neutralizing antibodies but failed to elicit a mucosal IgA response and efficient protection [6, 7, [15] [16] [17] . Furthermore, poor efficacies of currently commercialized vaccines have been reported [18] [19] [20] . Since parenteral administration of vaccines is the most convenient method of vaccine application in the swine industry, strategies like improving delivery techniques [21, 22] or the use of molecular adjuvants could be employed to modulate mucosal immunity [23, 24] .",

These pigs were randomly separated into five groups, including the mock group (n = 3), the iPEDV group (n = 3), the iPEDV + CCL25/28 group (n = 3), the iPEDV + CCL25/27 group (n = 3), and the iPEDV + CCL25/27/28 group (n = 3). All 5-week-old pigs received two IM injections into the biceps femoris muscles of their left leg, and primed and boosted with the same immunization program at 5 and 7 weeks old, as previously described (Table 1 ). The injected biceps femoris muscles were excised at one week following the second immunization, fixed in 10% neutral-buffered formalin, and paraffin-embedded muscles were serially sectioned into sections 5 \u00b5m thin, stained with hematoxylin and eosin for examining the existence of locally extensive inflammatory infiltrates, and then analyzed by immunohistochemistry (IHC) to visualize inflammatory cells expressing their specific receptors, CCR9 (the receptor of CCL25) and CCR10 (the receptor of both CCL27 and CCL28). The animal experimental procedure was reviewed and approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) of the National Taiwan University (Taipei, Taiwan) with approval No. NTU107-EL-00105.",

However, IM administration is the most popular and convenient route for vaccinations in pig herds [6, [15] [16] [17] 36, 37] . In the present study, we have demonstrated that IM co-administration of iPEDV with CC chemokines as adjuvants could induce superior systemic antigen-specific IgG, mucosal antigen-specific IgA, and recruitment of CCR9+ and/or CCR10+ inflammatory cells at the injection site of the experimental pigs as compared to control piglets. Strikingly, pigs intramuscularly immunized with iPEDV in combination with chemokines CCL25 and CCL28 were almost fully protected from the virulent PEDV challenge. Taken together, our results suggest that the application of porcine CC chemokines as the iPEDV IM vaccine adjuvants could successfully augment vaccine immune responses at the mucosal sites.",

In the HIV-1 DNA vaccine, IM co-administration of HIV antigens adjuvanted with CCL27 plasmid in both mice and macaques has been demonstrated to successfully magnify the HIVspecific IgA titers at mucosal areas [32] . In the case of HIV-1 VLPs co-immunized with CCL28 plasmid, HIV-specific IgA, as well as gastro-intestinal mucosal IgA-secreting plasma cells were significantly augmented in mice [41] .

However, IM administration is the most popular and convenient route for vaccinations in pig herds [6, [15] [16] [17] 36, 37] . In the present study, we have demonstrated that IM co-administration of iPEDV with CC chemokines as adjuvants could induce superior systemic antigen-specific IgG, mucosal antigen-specific IgA, and recruitment of CCR9+ and/or CCR10+ inflammatory cells at the injection site of the experimental pigs as compared to control piglets. Strikingly, pigs intramuscularly immunized with iPEDV in combination with chemokines CCL25 and CCL28 were almost fully protected from the virulent PEDV challenge. Taken together, our results suggest that the application of porcine CC chemokines as the iPEDV IM vaccine adjuvants could successfully augment vaccine immune responses at the mucosal sites.",

Both CCL27 and CCL28 have been demonstrated as being able to recruit CLA-positive cells expressing the cognate receptor CCR10 and its ligands in the chemo-trafficking of antigen-specific IgA secreting plasmablasts and memory CD4+ T lymphocytes to mucosal sites of pathogenic exposure [25, 28, [38] [39] [40] . These functions had been applied in the development of vaccines for HIV-1 DNA and virus-like particles (VLP). In the HIV-1 DNA vaccine, IM co-administration of HIV antigens adjuvanted with CCL27 plasmid in both mice and macaques has been demonstrated to successfully magnify the HIV-specific IgA titers at mucosal areas [32] . In the case of HIV-1 VLPs co-immunized with CCL28 plasmid, HIV-specific IgA, as well as gastro-intestinal mucosal IgA-secreting plasma cells were significantly augmented in mice [41] . On the other hand, co-administration of CCL25 plasmid with the HIV DNA vaccine showed the elevation of both systemic HIV-specific IgG and mucosal HIV-specific IgA immune responses in mice following IM immunization [33] .",

As compared to pigs vaccinated with iPEDV in combination with CCL25/27 and CCL25/28, pigs vaccinated with iPEDV in combination with CCL28 alone or CCL25, CCL27, and CCL28 showed minimal protection against the virulent PEDV challenge. Concerning in vivo functions of CC chemokines, the findings unveiled that the iPEDV + CCL25/28 group also showed superior in vivo chemotaxis of CCR9+ cells compared to the iPEDV + CCL25/27/28 group. These results may help to explain that the co-existence of CCL25 and CCR9+ cells attracting chemokines is necessary for the IM iPEDV vaccine to mount effective immune protection against PEDV. Furthermore, the less effective CCL25, CCL27, and CCL28 triple-adjuvanted iPEDV vaccine, which contained 20 \u00b5g of each chemokine per shot, suggested that the amount of each chemokine should be at least 30 \u00b5g per shot to reach similar efficacy of disease protection, such as in the CCL25/CCL28 or CCL25/CCL27 double-adjuvanted groups.",

Co-administration of both CCL25 and CCL28, or both CCL25 and CCL27 has been demonstrated not only to recruit and home CCR9+ and CCR10+ cells to mucosal sites, but also enhance mucosal antigen-specific CD8+ T cells and the secretion of IFN-\u03b3, TNF-\u03b1 and IL-2 [32, 33, 41, [44] [45] [46] [47] [48] . It has also been shown that both CD4+ and CD8+ T cell responses and interferons (IFNs) might be critical interfering factors against PEDV [18, 37, 47, 48] besides the antigen-specific IgA. Further investigations for disclosing the exact immune-protective mechanism of CC chemokines-adjuvanted iPEDV vaccines, such as functional assays for determining antibody secreting cells, chemotaxis studies for attracting CCR-expressing cells, and ELISpots for studying the PEDV specific cellular responses in the mucosal site, are necessary.",

The combinations of CCR10 and CCR9 attracting chemokines have been demonstrated to be potential novel mucosal adjuvants for an inactivated G2b PEDV vaccine. This novel invention and combination allows us to develop an IM iPEDV vaccine capable of eliciting PEDV-specific systemic and mucosal immune responses, relieving clinical signs, and reducing viral shedding. Moreover, our porcine CC chemokines might be applied to the development of other porcine vaccines against mucosal transmissible pathogens, such as the porcine deltacoronavirus (PDCoV) and porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV). Future research should concentrate on whether co-immunization with CC chemokines and iPEDV provides lactogenic immunity and similar protective efficacy for suckling piglets against PEDV.",
