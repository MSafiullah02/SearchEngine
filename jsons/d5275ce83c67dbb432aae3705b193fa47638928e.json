Their unique genetic constitution, high virulence and wide host range set them apart from other paramyxoviruses. These characteristics have led to their classification into the new genus Henpavirus within the family Paramyxoviridae and to their designation as Biosafety Level 4 pathogens. The fusion protein, an enveloped glycoprotein essential for viral entry, belongs to the family of class I fusion proteins and is characterized by the presence of two heptad repeat (HR) regions, HR1 and HR2. These two regions associate to form a fusion-active hairpin conformation that juxtaposes the viral and cellular membranes to facilitate membrane fusion and enable subsequent viral entry. The Hendra and Nipah virus fusion core proteins were crystallized and their structures determined to 2.2 \u00c5 resolution. The Nipah and Hendra fusion core structures are six-helix bundles with three HR2 helices packed against the hydrophobic grooves on the surface of a central coiled coil formed by three parallel HR1 helices in an oblique antiparallel manner. Because of the high level of conservation in core regions, it is proposed that the Nipah and Hendra virus fusion cores can provide a model for membrane fusion in all paramyxoviruses.

These glycoproteins play a crucial role in the conformational changes during the virus-mediated membrane fusion process [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] . They are all initially synthesized as a single-chain precursor, termed F0 in paramyxovirus, which is then cleaved into two subunits (F1 and F2 in paramyxovirus) by a furin-like enzyme derived from the host cell [7] . F1 and F2 are covalently linked by a disulfide bond, and the complex forms a trimer on the virus envelope. The fusion peptide at the N-terminus of F1 is highly hydrophobic and is considered to be responsible for direct insertion of the F protein into the cellular lipid bilayer [15, 16, 22] . The highly conserved heptad repeat (HR) regions in F1, HR1 and HR2, seemingly act as scaffolding modules. HR1 and HR2 will interact with each other to form a so-called 'trimer of hairpins', 'six-helix bundle' or 'fusion core' in the membrane fusion process.

Lou et al. fusion loop, which inserts into the cellular membrane, is accepted to have the distinct conformational states proposed for the NiV F protein fusion core, including the native state, the prehairpin intermediate, and the fusion-active hairpin state. Several biological and inhibition studies have also provided good evidence that the fusion core in the crystal structure presented here is the final, stable form of the protein, which is the fusion-active state following one or more conformational changes. First, gel filtration and chemical crosslinking results demonstrated that the oligomeric state of the two-helix protein was a trimer. Even at high concentrations of the crosslinker, the monomer \u2044 dimer bands could be observed [31] . Second, NiV and HeV infection in vitro can be potently blocked by peptides corresponding to the C-terminal HR (HR2) of the HeV fusion envelope glycoprotein 39.

In the case of HIV-1, several strategies to block hairpin formation have been successfully developed to identify viral entry inhibitors that bind to the hydrophobic pocket and grooves on the surface of the central coiled coil consisting of HIV-1 gp41 N peptides. These useful viral entry inhibitors include D peptides, five-helix, and synthetic peptides derived from N or C peptides [40] [41] [42] . Successful viral entry inhibitors have also been identified for other viruses, such as T20 for HIV-1 and GP610 for Ebola virus. Analogous strategies could also be used for the design of NiV \u2044 HeV fusion inhibitors. In 2005, several reports showed that NiV \u2044 HeV infection in vitro can be potently blocked by specific HR2 peptides. The improved second-generation HR2 peptides, which use poly(ethylene glycol) to facilitate peptide synthesis and increase solubility, also show good IC50 values in in vitro assays. The applied chemical modifications are also predicted to increase the serum half-life in vivo and should increase the chances of success in the development of an effective antiviral therapy [50] . The well-defined hydrophobic grooves on the surface of the central coiled coil of the NiV F protein fusion core identified from our structure can offer a reasonable explanation for the inhibition of NiV and HeV infection.
