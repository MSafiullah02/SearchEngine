In the United States, outpatient visit rates for CAP between 1994\u20131995 and 2002\u20132003 were defined using International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM) diagnosis codes and reported in the National Ambulatory Medical Care Survey and the National Hospital Ambulatory Medical Care Survey and identified rates ranging from 74 to 92 per 1000 children <2 years old to 35\u201352 per 1000 children 3\u20136 years old [8]. In 2006, the rate of hospitalization for CAP in children through age 18 years, using data from the Healthcare Cost Utilization Project\u2019s Kids\u2019 Inpatient Database, also based on ICD-9-CM discharge diagnosis codes, was 201.1 per 100 000 [9]. Infants <1 year old had the highest rate of hospitalization (912.9 per 100 000) whereas children 13\u201318 years had the lowest rate (62.8 per 100 000) [9]. Data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) document that in 2006, 525 infants and children <15 years old died in the United States as a result of pneumonia and other lower respiratory tract infections [10]. The reported incidence of pneumonia in children, both pathogen specific and as a general diagnosis, varies across published studies based on definitions used, tests performed, and the goals of the investigators. CAP in children in the United States, the focus of these guidelines, is defined simply as the presence of signs and symptoms of pneumonia in a previously healthy child caused by an infection that has been acquired outside of the hospital [11, 12]. However, pneumonia definitions can also be designed to be very sensitive for epidemiologic considerations (eg, fever and cough) or very specific, as defined by government regulatory agencies for approval of antimicrobials to treat pneumonia (eg, clinical symptoms and signs in combination with radiologic documentation or microbiologic confirmation) [13]. Pneumonia, broadly defined as a lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI), may also be defined in a way that is clinically oriented, to assist practitioners with diagnosis and management.",

Investigators have used a variety of laboratory tests to establish a microbial etiology of CAP. For example, diagnosis of pneumococcal pneumonia has been based on positive cultures of blood, antibody responses, antigen detection, and nucleic acid detection. Each test has different sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values that are dependent on the prevalence of the pathogen at the time of testing. Therefore, comparing etiologies of pneumonia between published studies is challenging. More recent investigations have used a variety of sensitive molecular techniques including nucleic acid detection, particularly for viral identification. In many children with LRTI, diagnostic testing may identify 2 or 3 pathogens, including combinations of both viruses and bacteria, making it difficult to determine the significance of any single pathogen [19\u201321]. Furthermore, unique to pediatrics, the developing immune system and age-related exposures result in infection caused by different bacterial and viral pathogens, requiring that the incidence of CAP and potential pathogens be defined separately for each age group [7].",

Hypoxemia is well established as a risk factor for poor outcome in children and infants with any type of disease, especially respiratory diseases. The use of pulse oximetry to detect hypoxemia has confirmed this relationship such that guidelines and clinical decision rules usually recommend pulse oximetry in any patient with pneumonia. In the developing world, for pediatric patients with nonsevere pneumonia (as defined by WHO), a pulse oximetric SpO2 measurement of <90% at the initial visit has been documented to be predictive of failure of outpatient oral amoxicillin treatment [45]. In adults, hypoxemia is an indicator for respiratory failure requiring ICU admission in patients with pneumonia [46, 47] and has also been independently associated with short-term mortality [32, 48]. Widespread agreement exists that admission is indicated in a previously healthy child with CAP and an oxygen saturation in room air (at sea level) of <90%, although some would hospitalize children who have oxygen saturations as high as 93% [49]. At higher altitudes, lower oxygen saturations may be more appropriate to define respiratory failure, as demonstrated in Bolivia [50].",

Although tachypnea in infants with pneumonia may correlate with presence of hypoxemia, tachypnea may also be caused by fever, dehydration, or a concurrent metabolic acidosis [55]. In a study from a pediatric emergency department in Boston of children <5 years old undergoing chest radiography for possible pneumonia, the respiratory rates for those with documented pneumonia did not differ significantly from those for children without pneumonia.

Children with a comorbid condition and influenza infection are more likely to require hospitalization than otherwise healthy children [23, 63, 64].

Furthermore, infants and young children tend to have more severe pneumonia with a greater need for hospitalization and a higher risk of respiratory failure. One independent risk factor for death in children hospitalized for acute respiratory tract infections in the Central African Republic was age between 2 and 11 months [52]. However, malnutrition may also contribute to severity of disease in the developing world, tempering conclusions about mortality in this age group from respiratory tract disease alone [68]. A clinical tool designed to predict which child with severe pneumonia would have failure of oral antimicrobial therapy in the developing world found that the age of the child was one of the most important clinical predictors (highly significant for those <6 months of age) [54]. In the developed world, prospectively collected data have not been published documenting a cutoff age below which hospitalization is necessary for improved outcomes. In the United States, very young infants (up to 3 months of age) with CAP are generally admitted to the hospital for initial management. Given the increased risk of morbidity, the admission of infants up to 6 months of age with suspected bacterial CAP is also prudent [29, 69].",

Other signs of respiratory distress and potential respiratory insufficiency include increased work of breathing (as evidenced by retractions [suprasternal, subcostal, or intercostals]), nasal flaring, and use of accessory muscles), recurrent apnea, or grunting. Grunting, when present, is a sign of severe disease and impending respiratory failure [71]. Oxygen saturation by pulse oximetry is usually monitored continuously for a child with increased work of breathing or significant distress, particularly if he or she has a decreased level of activity or agitation [51].",

However, investigators in Utah, using stringent criteria for bacterial CAP, reported that 11.4% of blood cultures were positive in patients requiring hospitalization for CAP [89] with half of the organisms identified as S. pneumoniae, serotype 1, a serotype not included in PCV7 but present in the 13-valent formulation (PVC13). Blood cultures were not routinely performed in all children hospitalized with CAP in prior studies [74, 78, 88, 89]. It is likely that blood cultures were performed disproportionately in children with greater illness severity; thus, these prior studies may overestimate the true rate of bacteremia in children hospitalized with uncomplicated CAP. Among patients with pneumonia complicated by parapneumonic effusion, rates of bacteremia also vary, ranging from 13.0% to 26.5% [80, 89\u201393]. The prevalence of bacteremia was 7.8% (95% confidence interval, 2.2%\u201318.9%) among children with any pneumonia-associated complication, including sepsis and organ dysfunction [80].",

Culture-directed antimicrobial selection may be associated with improved clinical outcomes in only a minority of pediatric cases, as has been shown in studies of adults with CAP [94\u201396]. In contrast to adults with CAP, in whom positive blood cultures infrequently affect clinical management [97], positive blood cultures did result in narrowing or broadening of therapy in 5 of 6 patients with positive cultures, among 291 children from whom blood cultures were obtained [80]. However, the overall impact of blood cultures on clinical management may be small because of the low prevalence of bacteremia. In addition, it is worth noting that epidemiologic data derived from blood culture results have been essential in creating an evidence-based pneumococcal vaccination policy in the United States [98, 99].",

In children, urine antigen tests were positive in 47 of 62 (76%) with lobar pneumonia [102]; however, because the etiology of pneumonia could not be confirmed, the relevance of this finding is not clear. Of even greater concern, positive results occurred in 15% of febrile children without evidence of invasive pneumococcal disease; it was not clear whether these were false-positive results attributable to pneumococcal nasopharyngeal colonization or true-positive results in the context of early pulmonary disease that did not produce characteristic radiographic findings or whether they were associated with spontaneously resolved pneumococcal infection [102]. Dowell et al found no significant difference in the proportion of positive pneumococcal urinary antigen results (\u223c35%) in children with pneumonia compared with children with dermatitis or diarrhea; however, a positive result was strongly associated with pneumococcal colonization [103]. Other studies also suggest that positive results can be attributed to nasopharyngeal colonization with S. pneumoniae in >15% of children [104, 105]. Positive results of pneumococcal urinary antigen tests do not reliably distinguish children with pneumococcal pneumonia from those who are merely colonized. In the absence of a true reference standard, there is insufficient information on the negative predictive value of this test to recommend its use for excluding pneumococcal disease.",

Rapid influenza tests were performed on nasopharyngeal specimens for all patients, with 52% positive for influenza. Patients were then randomized so that the treating physician was either provided or not provided with the results of influenza testing. Antibiotics were prescribed to 7.3% of patients for whom the physician was aware of a positive influenza test result, compared with 24.5% of patients for whom the physician was not aware of the results. Similar reductions were noted in the performance of chest radiography and other ancillary tests. No patient had lobar pneumonia [106]. Esposito et al [107] randomized 957 children who presented to their clinic with influenzalike illness to rapid influenza testing or no testing, with 43 (8.9%) children testing positive. Antibiotics were prescribed to 32.6% of influenza-positive compared with 64.8% of influenza-negative patients; of those who were randomized to no testing, 61.8% were given antibiotics. No significant difference was noted in the performance of chest radiographs between groups. In a retrospective cohort study of hospitalized adults with laboratory-confirmed influenza infection, a positive rapid influenza test result was associated with 6-fold higher odds to discontinue or withhold antibiotic therapy compared with influenza-positive patients whose diagnosis was delayed because positive PCR results were not readily available [112].",

For influenza, the sensitivity of each type of test varies by both method and sampling technique, and for the rapid tests, may also vary by the strains of influenza circulating in any given year. For example, the sensitivity of rapid influenza tests during 2009 pandemic H1N1 was poor compared with the performance of tests for seasonal influenza [114]. For children with influenzalike illness in a community with documented influenza virus circulation, a negative rapid influenza virus test in a child with CAP and symptoms compatible with influenza may reflect inaccuracies of the test, rather than reliably excluding influenza virus as a pathogen. For children with influenza, particularly those who require mechanical ventilation, initial results of nasopharyngeal testing for influenza may be negative, even with reverse-transcriptase PCR techniques, because of many factors, including poor-quality specimens, sampling of the upper rather than lower respiratory tract, and prolonged duration from illness onset to specimen collection. Multiple specimens on multiple days may be required for diagnosis. Because early influenza antiviral therapy provides the greatest benefit to the child, a clinician should not wait to start empiric antiviral therapy until after obtaining respiratory tract samples for diagnosis [115, 116].",

For younger children in particular, decisions regarding testing are made more difficult by uncertainty regarding the extent to which treatment of confirmed M. pneumoniae infections improves clinical outcomes in this population (see Evidence Summary for Recommendation 44). For treatment of CAP in children, it is important to minimize unnecessary prescribing of macrolide therapy, which may be inadequate for treatment of S. pneumoniae, while offering the best care for children with CAP caused by M. pneumoniae. Testing for M. pneumoniae may be most useful when the pretest probability for M. pneumoniae infection is intermediate or high. The age at which one should begin to strongly consider M. pneumoniae as the cause of CAP is not well defined. M. pneumoniae is increasingly being diagnosed serologically as a cause of LRTI in young children [15, 17, 18, 118\u2013122]. Testing may not be necessary in children with a low likelihood of M. pneumoniae infection (eg, younger children with symptoms more compatible with a primary viral upper respiratory tract infection), in whom the positive predictive value of a positive test may only be modest (ie, false-positive results will occur). Testing may be most useful in guiding decisions regarding empiric antibiotic therapy in school-aged children and adolescents who have findings consistent with but not classic for M. pneumoniae infection. In these situations, a positive test result for M. pneumoniae may warrant treatment, whereas a negative result makes the diagnosis of M. pneumoniae pneumonia unlikely. Epidemiologic aspects of M. pneumoniae infection and commonly available tests are summarized below.",

The complex nutritional requirements and slow growth of M. pneumoniae on culture media make its identification impractical for most laboratories; additionally, results from culture for M. pneumoniae are not available in a clinically relevant time frame. The presence of cold-reacting antibodies against red blood cells in the serum of patients with primary atypical pneumonia is well known [123]. Cold agglutinin titers >1:64 are present at the time of acute illness in \u223c75% of adults with pneumonia due to M. pneumoniae. Because the test is less well studied in children, its accuracy in detecting respiratory infection due to M. pneumoniae is not known. The specificity of a titer <1:64 is low because a variety of other respiratory tract pathogens provoke modest increases in cold agglutinins. Performance of the cold agglutinin test at the bedside lacks the rigorous standards of high sensitivity and specificity and reproducibility currently expected of medical diagnostics and is not recommended in any setting.",

Enzyme assays are less time consuming and have thus largely replaced complement fixation tests in the laboratory setting for detection of immunoglobulin (Ig) M. Rapid serologic tests typically have results available within 10 min. The ImmunoCard rapid IgM test (Meridian Bioscience) has been compared with other serology tests but not with PCR. Alexander et al studied 896 specimens submitted to clinical laboratories for M. pneumoniae serologic testing. When compared with 2 M. pneumoniae IgM-specific assays (IFA and ELISA) and a standard complement fixation procedure, the ImmunoCard had sensitivities ranging from 74% (compared with ELISA) to 96% (compared with complement fixation), with inconsistent results resolved using IFA as the reference standard [124]. ImmunoCard specificities ranged from 85% (compared with IgM-specific ELISA) to 98% (compared with IgM-specific IFA), with inconsistencies resolved using medical record review [124]. Results were similar in a subsequent study of 145 children referred for M. pneumoniae testing [125]. However, the specificity of IgM detection described during an outbreak of M. pneumoniae pneumonia was only 43% for children 10\u201318 years of age and 82% for those \u226519 years of age, compared with a case definition reference standard for diagnosis [126]. A combined IgG-IgM assay (Remel; Thermo Fisher Scientific) assessed during this outbreak had a higher specificity in children 10\u201318 years of age (74%) but a lower sensitivity (52%) compared with IgM detection (89%) [126]. An IgM assay (Platelia IgM capture; Sanofi Diagnostics) appears to be as sensitive as PCR for detection of M. pneumoniae in CAP in children [127]. Direct comparison of studies using PCR is difficult because specimens were obtained from different sites (eg, nasal wash, nasopharyngeal swab, throat, sputum) using different primer sets and amplification techniques [128\u2013132], but PCR-based testing is neither readily available nor practical in office, emergency department, or community hospital settings using currently available test systems. In summary, we believe that testing for Mycoplasma infection is important to optimize use of macrolides in children. However, no single currently available test offers the sensitivity and specificity desired in a clinically relevant time frame. Therefore, the clinician should be knowledgeable regarding the performance characteristics of the tests offered by local laboratories.",

Recommendations for standardized approaches to culture, PCR testing, serology, and immunohistochemistry were published in 2001 by the CDC and the Canadian Laboratory Centres for Disease Control (LCDC) [133]. Serology has been the primary means of clinical diagnostic testing for C. pneumoniae because of its widespread availability and relative simplicity. However, many of the available assays, including complement fixation, whole inclusion fluorescence, and various enzyme immunoassays, perform poorly or have not been adequately validated; microimmunofluorescence testing remains the only endorsed approach [133]. During primary infection, IgM antibody appears 2\u20133 weeks after illness onset. IgG antibody may not reach a diagnostically high titer until 6\u20138 weeks after the onset of illness. Therefore, confirmation of primary acute infection requires documenting an IgM titer of 1:16 or greater or a 4-fold rise in IgG titer between acute and convalescent serum specimens. In case of reinfection, IgM antibody may not appear, and the level of IgG antibody titer may rise quickly within 1\u20132 weeks of infection [133]. IgG titers of 1:16 or greater are consistent with previous exposure and are seen in approximately half of adults. Therefore, a single elevated IgG titer does not confirm the diagnosis of C. pneumoniae infection. The organism or its DNA can be directly identified by means of culture or PCR testing in specimens from nasopharyngeal or throat swabs, sputum, blood, or tissue. Few published PCR assays met the validation criteria proposed by the CDC and LCDC [133]. In summary, no widely available and timely test exists for the diagnosis of C. pneumoniae infection.",

Korppi et al found that the WBC count, CRP, and ESR were significantly higher in children with pneumococcal pneumonia than in those with viral or atypical pneumonia [138]. However, the number of patients with pneumococcal disease, diagnosed most often by serology, was relatively small (n = 29), there was considerable overlap in values between the 2 groups, and the sensitivity and positive predictive value for their specified WBC count criteria for pneumonia were low. The sensitivities for a CRP >6.0 mg/dL or an ESR >35 mm/h were 26% and 25%, respectively, but increased when the 2 results were combined. The positive predictive value for a CRP >6.0 mg/dL or an ESR >35 mm/h was 43% and 38%, respectively [138]. Other Finnish investigators found wide variation in WBC count, CRP, and ESR values between children with CAP attributable to bacteria and viruses; the values did not differ significantly between the 2 groups [142]. Procalcitonin, although promising as a sensitive marker of serious bacterial infection, has limited value in distinguishing nonserious bacterial from viral pneumonia in children because the values are widely distributed. Elevated procalcitonin concentrations in children with documented viral infections raise the possibility that some children identified as having viral pneumonia may actually have a viral-bacterial coinfection [143\u2013148]. However, low values may be helpful in distinguishing viral pneumonia from bacterial pneumonia associated with bacteremia [149]. Acute-phase reactants can also be measured at baseline for patients requiring hospitalization. Declining values of CRP or procalcitonin may correlate with improvement in clinical symptoms and thus have the potential to serve as objective measures of disease resolution.",

Therefore, chest radiographs do not have a substantial impact on clinical outcomes [150\u2013152]. In addition, it may be impractical to obtain chest radiographs, especially in the office setting. Studies have documented that chest radiographs performed in children with suspected acute LRTI led to changes in the diagnosis or the use of antibiotics in \u223c25% of children evaluated in a clinic or emergency department setting but rarely affected decisions regarding hospitalization [153, 154]. Chest radiographs in these studies were least useful when information from history and clinical examination were consistent with the diagnosis of pneumonia, suggesting that chest radiographs are not necessary in outpatients in whom the diagnosis of CAP is strongly suspected on the basis of clinical findings. In a study of the utility of chest radiographs, Alario and colleagues studied 102 children between 1 month and 18 years of age with fever or respiratory symptoms for whom a resident ordered a chest radiograph in an outpatient setting [153]. Before the chest radiograph was obtained, clinical assessments were performed, and management plans were recorded by an experienced attending physician. For the experienced physician, the chest radiographs supported the diagnosis of pneumonia in 11 of 12 patients (92%) with a preradiograph diagnosis of pneumonia [153]. The diagnosis of viral or bacterial pneumonia was made in an another 6 of 40 patients (15%) with a preradiograph diagnosis of \u201cno LRTI\u201d [153]. Data from a developing country also suggest that the changes in management resulting from chest radiographs in the outpatient setting are not typically associated with improved clinical outcomes [151, 155].",

There is greater consensus regarding the presence of alveolar consolidation compared with other radiographic features of pneumonia [159, 164, 165]. The WHO Vaccine Trial Investigators\u2019 Radiology Working Group has proposed standards for interpretation of pediatric chest radiographs for the diagnosis of pneumonia [166]. These standards include reporting of film quality, classification of specific findings, and explicit statements regarding radiograph interpretation. High agreement in identifying radiographically confirmed pneumonia was achieved using standardized definitions and training; the kappa index was >0.6 for 19 of 20 radiologists and clinicians in a review of 92 chest radiographs [166]. Identification of an infiltrate on chest radiograph by attending clinicians compared with radiologists does not consistently lead to meaningful differences in clinical management or outcomes [167].

Persistent abnormalities are more likely in patients with signs or symptoms of pneumonia at the time of follow-up radiography (up to 50% in one study) [168]; however, these abnormalities rarely alter clinical management. Few studies have systematically followed up children with radiographic abnormalities for extended periods of time. Radiographs performed 3\u20137 weeks after an episode of radiographically confirmed CAP revealed residual or new changes in 59 (30%) of 196 children; persistence of interstitial infiltrates and the interval development of atelectasis were the most commonly noted findings [169]. Long-term follow-up 8\u201310 years later did not reveal any illnesses attributable to the initial episode of CAP [169]. In a prospective study of adults hospitalized with severe CAP, chest radiographs were repeated 7 and 28 days after admission [173]. At day 7 and day 28, 75% and 47% of patients, respectively, still had abnormal findings. Delayed resolution of radiographic abnormalities was associated with multilobar disease, dullness to percussion at examination, higher CRP levels, and documented pneumococcal infection. However, delayed resolution of radiographic abnormalities did not portend failure of antimicrobial therapy or a worse clinical outcome.

These investigators found that 50% of children had antimicrobial treatment changed as a consequence of the culture results from bronchoscopy. In a study of BAL in children with a variety of respiratory diagnoses, Tang and Chen found that a positive or negative culture resulted in a treatment change in 23.4% of their patients [177].",

The majority of complications were minor and transitory, though 2 significant adverse events were reported (pneumothorax requiring a chest tube, and increased intracranial pressure) [181]. A similar technique, used in infants as young as 7 days, involves blindly inserting a double-sheathed protected specimen brush, to a point just beyond the endotracheal tube tip. The inner catheter is then extended 1 cm further and the protective plug expelled, allowing the brush to be advanced another 1-2 cm, and then retracted into the sheath and removed [182].",

However, with clear limitations on the ability to absorb orally administered penicillin and its salts from the gastrointestinal tract, there has been no change in interpretation of MIC values for pneumococci treated with oral therapy: penicillin-susceptible strains remain defined as having MICs < 0.06 \u03bcg/mL, intermediately susceptible strains having MICs between 0.12 and 1.0 \u03bcg/mL, and resistant strains as having MICs \u22652.0 \u03bcg/mL.

With the development of widespread pneumococcal resistance to penicillin in the 1990s, high-dosage amoxicillin (90 mg/kg/day) was studied in an attempt to overcome resistance in pneumococcus and found to be successful for acute otitis media when given twice daily [190]. The half-life of amoxicillin in middle ear fluid was documented to be 4\u20136 hours, compared with 1 hour in serum, providing supporting evidence for twice-daily dosing for acute otitis media. Similar prospective, comparative data supporting a recommendation for twice-daily dosing have not been collected for documented pneumococcal pneumonia in children [191]. To achieve the appropriate amoxicillin exposure in lung infected by relatively resistant pneumococci (MICs of 2.0 \u03bcg/mL), a high total daily dose (90 mg/kg/day) in 3 equally divided portions is predicted to achieve a clinical and microbiologic cure in about 90% of children treated, compared with only 65% of children treated with the same total daily dose divided into 2 equal doses [192]. However, for fully susceptible strains, a dosage of 90 mg/kg/day in 2 divided portions, as indicated for otitis media, is likely to be successful [193]. With the success of the 7-valent pneumococcal vaccine in decreasing invasive pneumococcal infection, a decrease in the degree of penicillin resistance in circulating strains has been documented [194], suggesting that the appropriate dosage of amoxicillin may decrease to that recommended in the prevaccine era. However, with the emergence of antibiotic-resistant serotype 19A strains of pneumococcus, most experts believe that, when pneumococcal pneumonia is suspected and oral therapy is appropriate, high-dosage amoxicillin is still preferred. Although serotype 19A is included in the newer 13-valent pneumococcal vaccine, it is too soon to evaluate the impact of this intervention on invasive disease or on the emergence of antibiotic resistance to non-PCV13 serotypes.",

Microbiologic failures of ceftriaxone have not been reported in children for pneumococcal pneumonia for organisms demonstrating a ceftriaxone MIC <4.0 \u03bcg/mL; published data in adults support the use of ceftriaxone for organisms with MICs for ceftriaxone of up to 4 \u03bcg/mL [198].

The majority of strains of influenza A virus isolated since the 2005\u20132006 season have been adamantine resistant; resistance to adamantanes is intrinsic to all influenza B strains. The WHO and CDC track and report resistance as strains are analyzed during the influenza season. Dosages of antiviral agents that are currently recommended for seasonal influenza were developed for fully susceptible strains and were evaluated in clinical trials that mandated treatment within 48 hours of onset of symptoms. Although earlier treatment will result in the most benefit [213], patients with serious illness or those with ongoing clinical deterioration after 48 hours of symptoms are still likely to benefit from therapy [214\u2013217].

Short-course (3-day) therapy has been studied in the developing world, but the clinical, laboratory, and radiographic description of these study patients is less definitive than in developed countries, and documentation of a bacterial pathogen is infrequent [223]. Similar prospective, comparative studies of short-course therapy with intensive investigation for etiology of pneumonia have not been performed in the developed world. Although the total course of therapy is often 10 days, transition to oral therapy has been often used to allow discharge from an inpatient setting, providing decreased risks from intravenous administration of therapy and exposure to nosocomial pathogens. Although no data from prospective, controlled studies are available, retrospective reviews suggest that this practice is effective. Transition from intravenous to daily intramuscular therapy with long-acting antibiotics, particularly \u03b2-lactams such as ceftriaxone or ertapenem, may provide another option for hospital discharge for the child who no longer requires supplemental oxygen and skilled nursing care but may still require parenteral therapy. In areas with skilled pediatric outpatient nursing resources, for children who may require longer duration of parenteral therapy, outpatient intravenous therapy through an indwelling central catheter, with daily skilled pediatric home nursing visits, provides another option for out-of-hospital care [224].",

Physical examination may reveal signs of pleural fluid, including dullness to percussion, diminished breath sounds, and a change in the quality of breath sounds and transmitted speech over the effusion. Chest radiography, including lateral decubitus views, should be used to confirm the presence of pleural fluid in children with CAP. If there is still a question of pleural fluid versus parenchymal opacification, then further imaging with chest ultrasound or CT scan is warranted.

If there is doubt about the infectious etiology of the effusion or if malignancy is suspected, thoracentesis may be performed for cytologic examination. When an empyema is present, drainage of purulent material is usually required for adequate treatment of the infection. Drainage of infected pleural fluid may result in decreased fever, inflammation, and hospital stay [240, 241]. Finally, the size of the effusion and the degree of respiratory compromise are important factors to be considered when determining the management plan. Small effusions (see Table 8) often respond well to antibiotic therapy and usually require no further intervention. Moderate to large effusions are more likely to cause respiratory compromise, not resolve quickly and benefit from drainage, as outlined in Figure 1.",

Small effusions (<10 mm rim of fluid on lateral decubitus or less than one-fourth of the hemithorax opacified on an upright chest radiograph) are likely to resolve on their own and usually do not require drainage. Reporting their 12-year, single-institution, retrospective experience with pneumonia and parapneumonic effusions, Carter et al noted that no small pleural effusion required drainage; all patients with small effusions recovered uneventfully with antibiotic therapy alone [245]. In the absence of mediastinal shift, only 27% of patients (23 of 84) with moderate pleural effusions required drainage. Carter et al also noted that of 94 children with large effusions (more than half of the hemithorax opacified), 62 (66%) ultimately required pleural drainage. In adults, Ferguson et al noted that simple aspiration and drainage were likely to fail in effusions occupying >40% of the hemithorax [246]. This was also the consensus in the British Thoracic Society guidelines for children [241] and the adult-based American College of Chest Physicians consensus statement [243]. There are few data concerning moderate effusions, although Carter et al noted that the majority of children with moderate effusions were successfully managed without pleural drainage; only 1 child treated initially with antibiotics alone required readmission for pleural fluid drainage [245]. However, further prospective studies are needed in this area.",

The imaging study of choice to assess for pleural fluid loculations is chest ultrasound, although lateral decubitus radiography and CT of the chest can also be used. There is some evidence that loculated parapneumonic effusions are associated with more complicated hospital courses. Ramnath et al found that children with loculated parapneumonic effusions treated with antibiotics alone, either with or without chest tube placement, had longer lengths of stay and more complicated courses than those with simple (nonloculated) effusions that were treated similarly [247].

Using nucleic acid or antigen detection methods, several studies in the United States and Europe have demonstrated that culture-negative empyema is caused primarily by S. pneumoniae, often nonvaccine serotypes that are susceptible to penicillin [226, 249, 250, 255\u2013258]. These methods have greater sensitivity than traditional culture-based methods, identifying bacterial pathogens in 42%\u201380% of samples, especially in patients pretreated with antibiotics [226, 259, 260] Antigen and nucleic acid assays for the diagnosis of pathogens responsible for parapneumonic empyema, including S. pneumoniae and S. aureus, are still in development, but these tests may be helpful in centers where they are available.

In children, pH values <7.2 have been associated with need for pleural fluid drainage [262].

            "text": "The choice of drainage procedure depends on local or regional expertise and experience. In patients with pleural fluid that is not loculated, initial drainage with a chest tube alone is an option, though proceeding directly to adjunctive therapy is also reasonable. Loculated effusions cannot be drained with a chest tube alone and thus require adjunctive therapy. Both chest tube drainage with the instillation of fibrinolytic agents, including urokinase or tissue plasminogen activator, and VATS have been advocated as effective treatment measures for pediatric parapneumonic effusions [92, 266\u2013269]. Either chest tube drainage with fibrinolysis or VATS is preferred (over chest tube drainage alone) for complicated, loculated effusions; currently available data are not adequate to determine that one procedure is clearly preferred over the other. See Table 9 for fibrinolytic regimens used with children [92, 266, 267]. Both interventions have been reported to have improved patient outcomes, including resolution of infection and decreased length of hospital stay, when compared with conservative treatment with chest tube drainage and antibiotics [92, 266\u2013268, 270]. Two single-center randomized controlled trials compared fibrinolytic therapy with VATS. Although different strategies for fibrinolysis were used by Sonnappa et al (30 patients treated with urokinase, 30 with VATS) and St Peter et al (18 patients treated with alteplase, 18 treated with VATS), both studies demonstrated similar patient outcomes, including length of hospital stay, and both also demonstrated a decreased cost for treatment of parapneumonic empyema with fibrinolytic agents compared with VATS [92, 267]. A randomized trial by Kurt et al (10 patients treated with VATS, 8 treated with conventional tube thoracostomy with reteplase fibrinolysis solely as rescue therapy) documented shorter length of stay among patients undergoing initial VATS [271]. Based on the currently available data, both chest tube with fibrinolysis and VATS are considered acceptable initial drainage strategies.",

The bacterial pathogens responsible for CAP and for parapneumonic effusion or empyema are also similar, with S. pneumoniae the most commonly isolated pathogen in most studies [236, 237, 242\u2013246], though S. aureus remains an important cause of empyema but a less common cause of uncomplicated CAP. Whenever possible, antibiotic therapy should be pathogen directed, based on results of bacterial culture of either blood or pleural fluid. Unfortunately, pleural fluid cultures are often negative owing to the high frequency of antibiotic treatment initiated before fluid is obtained for culture. In these circumstances, treatment is based on regional epidemiology and selected to provide coverage for the most common pathogens (see Evidence Summary for Recommendations 46\u201349). When molecular testing is used, culture-negative empyema is most often found to be due to S. pneumoniae that had been partially treated before bacterial cultures were obtained and has rarely been found to be due to S. aureus [226, 250, 256\u2013258]. Empyema caused by S. aureus, especially CA-MRSA, results in positive bacterial culture more often than empyema caused by pneumococcus. In a single-center study of 63 pleural fluid specimens tested by bacterial culture and PCR, all cases of CA-MRSA were demonstrated by both culture and PCR. No cases of MRSA were demonstrated by PCR in culture negative pleural fluid [226], although this finding should be verified in settings with higher incidences of CA-MRSA.",

In the United States, pneumococcal conjugate and H. influenzae type b conjugate vaccines have been recommended for infants and children as part of the routine infant immunization schedule and have reduced rates of morbidity and mortality from pneumococcal and H. influenzae type b pneumonia [306\u2013308]. In 2010, the US Food and Drug Administration approved the 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine, and the CDC Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices has issued guidelines for the use of this immunization in children [98, 309]. The 13-valent vaccine (PCV13) contains antigen for the 7 serotypes in the PCV7 vaccine (serotypes 4, 6B, 9V, 14, 18C, 19F, and 23F) and for 6 additional serotypes (1, 3, 5, 6A, 7F, and 19A).

Additional outcomes that can be measured to assess the effectiveness of interventions include the requirement for hospitalization, length of hospitalization, readmission after discharge, and costs of care. Few of these outcomes have been considered in studies of childhood CAP. Several, such as the requirement for hospitalization and length of hospitalization, are subjective and may be related to important nonclinical factors, including psychosocial or behavioral considerations, socioeconomic considerations, potential for nonadherence to prescribed therapy, and barriers to follow-up medical care. Others, such as persistence of clinical symptoms, may be related to nonbacterial causes of pneumonia.",

This decision is important, because it directly affects the intensity of subsequent testing and therapy. The wide variation in CAP-related admission rates between neighboring geographic regions [333] suggests that physicians do not use consistent criteria to make site-of-care decisions. Unnecessary hospitalization has disadvantages, including nosocomial infection, exposure to ionizing radiation, and increased healthcare costs. However, outpatient management of high-risk patients may increase CAP-associated morbidity rates. As is the case for CAP in adults [32\u201335, 38], triage decisions might be facilitated by the creation of clinical prediction rules that identify patients at high or low risk of clinical deterioration and pneumonia-associated complications.",

Contributing to the family burden are parental days of work loss, ranging from 2 days for CAP treated in the ambulatory setting to 4 days for CAP requiring hospitalization, and family stress, leading to repercussions for parents\u2019 health and family morale [336]. Cost is not considered a primary outcome for childhood pneumonia. However, cost may be in important factor in choosing among therapies with similar efficacy. Therefore, studies examining the comparative effectiveness of different treatment strategies for uncomplicated pneumonia and severe pneumonia complicated by parapneumonic effusions, empyema, abscesses or necrosis should examine cost as a secondary outcome measure. Cost analyses may also include nonmedical costs, such as lost parental income.",

Several longitudinal studies suggest that children with LRTIs in childhood are at higher risk of subsequently developing obstructive lung disease; most of these studies, however, did not confirm the diagnosis of pneumonia with chest radiography, and whether the respiratory tract infection was the cause or consequence of airway hyperreactivity is unclear. Among children with pneumonia complicated by parapneumonic effusion or empyema, scoliosis, though uncommon, may occur but is usually transient. Abnormalities in lung function are common, but no consistent pattern of abnormalities exists, and the sample sizes are too small to enable meaningful comparisons between drainage procedure and lung function abnormalities. Furthermore, because these children were not evaluated for lung function before the diagnosis of pneumonia, it also possible that premorbid conditions involving lung function existed before pneumonia but were assumed by investigators to be the result of pneumonia. Among 36 children with complicated pneumonia evaluated by Kohn et al [337], 19% had mild restrictive lung disease and 16% had mild obstructive lung disease. Among 10 patients studied by McLaughlin et al [338], 26 years ago, 5 patients had a total lung capacity \u22651 standard deviation below the mean for age; 1 of these patients was considered to have mild restrictive lung disease (defined as a total lung capacity \u22652 standard deviations below the mean for age). In contrast, 7 of the 15 patients studied by Redding et al [339] 20 years ago had evidence of only mild obstructive lung disease, whereas no lung function abnormalities were reported among 13 patients studied by Satish et al [340] just 7 years ago. The impact of the improved quality of care provided by pediatric hospital medicine specialists and pediatric critical care specialists during the past 3 decades is likely to be substantial but remains poorly defined.",
