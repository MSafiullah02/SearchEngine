One was a lung tissue sample from the patient, and the other was a brain tissue sample from an H5N1 virus\u2013infected black-headed gull. In addition, in a previous study of the same placenta by our group [1], we observed H5N1 virus\u2013infected macrophages and trophoblastic cells. Therefore, cells from the same placenta were used as additional internal positive control samples when we attempted to determine whether the neutrophils were infected in the same tissue sections [1]. Three H5N1 virus\u2013uninfected placental samples were used as negative control samples. This investigation was performed in accordance with the Helsinki Declaration, and the procedures were approved by the Research Administrative Committee of Peking University (Beijing, China).",

There is no known case of neutrophil infection with virus in human influenza in vivo, and the result of our study represents, to our knowledge, the first observation of neutrophil infection due to H5N1 virus in a patient with human avian influenza. In our study, we found that H5N1 viral proteins and nucleotide sequences localized in placental neutrophils and that H5 sequences localized in leukocytes among placenta villi from an H5N1 virus\u2013infected patient. Positive signals were present in both the cytoplasm and the nucleus. NP- and HA-immunopositive neutrophils observed in the spleen indicate that this phenomenon probably occurs throughout the circulation.",

Viral hepatitis DNA was detected in neutrophils [10\u201312], and other viruses could be phagocytized by neutrophils [13\u201315]. Therefore, H5N1 virus might enter neutrophils via phagocytosis in a similar manner. Recently, we reported the presence of avian influenza receptors on the surface of a number of human cell types, including neutrophils [16]; therefore, the H5N1 virus might enter neutrophils via receptor-mediated endocytosis. Several viruses, including cytomegalovirus and Epstein-Barr virus, were reported to replicate in neutrophils [17\u201319]. The nuclear localization of viral protein in our study suggests that H5N1 virus might also be capable of replicating in neutrophils.",

These cells may serve as a viral carrier in systemic circulation and may cause multiple organ infection, as was reported elsewhere [1]. It was reported that H5N1 virus could replicate in dendritic cells and reduce their survival rate [20]. In addition, it was observed that numerous leukocytes were apoptotic in the lungs of an H5N1 virus\u2013infected patient [21]. Therefore, H5N1 virus may accelerate the destruction of neutrophils by direct killing or apoptosis and may cause the neutropenia that is frequently observed in H5N1 virus infection. Because our study is derived from examination of a unique case of pregnancy, the universality of this discovery warrants further investigation.",
