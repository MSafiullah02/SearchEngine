The CDC defines risk assessment as the process by which the appropriate selection of practices and safe guards respective of the agents are implemented to prevent laboratory-associated infections. Risk assessment is bound by two main categories: agent hazards and laboratory procedure hazards. Similarly, the main determinants of biosafety levels are dependent on the work performed in the laboratory as well as the agents used. Mainly, the following parameters are considered during the risk assessment process:Infectivity\u2014the ability of a pathogen to establish an infection or a pathogen\u2019s capacity for horizontal transmission,Transmissibility, andNature of work conducted.",

The installation of seamless, sealed, resilient floors should be considered.The entire laboratory must be decontaminated in case there are major renovations, maintenance, shut downs, or any other significant changes to the laboratory space.All vacuum lines must be protected with HEPA filters in addition to liquid disinfectant in the traps.BSL3 laboratories must have ducted air ventilation systems. This system provides sustained directional airflow by drawing air from clean areas into the laboratory and moving it toward potentially contaminated areas. The space should be designed such that under conditions of failure, the airflow will not be reversed. Some pointers to remember about the ventilation system are:Laboratory personnel should be able to easily identify the direction of airflow.A visual monitoring device indicating the directional airflow should be placed at the entrance of the laboratory. Audible alarms to notify airflow disruption are preferred. Laboratory air exhaust should not recirculate to any other areas of the buildingHEPA filter housing should have gas-tight isolation dampers, decontamination ports and/or bag-in/bag-out capability (with the appropriate decontamination procedures). The filters and the housing should allow for leak testing of each filter and should be tested and certified annually.HEPA filtered exhaust air from a Class II BSC can be safely recirculated into the laboratory environment only if they are recertified and tested annually and used under manufacturer\u2019s recommendations. BSCs can be directly exhausted outside through a hard connection or connected to the laboratory\u2019s exhaust system.Class III BSCs must be hard connected to the cabinet\u2019s second exhaust HEPA filter.Supply air for BSCs must be maintained so that negative pressurization of the cabinet is maintained.Containment devices that contain HEPA filtration (i.e., BSCs) will serve as primary barrier devices for equipment that have the potential to produce infectious aerosols. HEPA filters must be tested and replaced annually.Laboratory enhancements may be required based on risk assessment of the BSL3 laboratory. Such enhancements may include: an anteroom for clean storage of equipment, supplies and dress-in, shower-out capabilities; gas tight dampers for laboratory isolation; final HEPA filtration of laboratory exhaust air in addition to HEPA filters already installed on containment devices; laboratory effluent decontamination; and advanced access control devices (i.e., biometrics).Facility design, operational procedures and parameters must be documented prior to full operation of BSL3 laboratory.
