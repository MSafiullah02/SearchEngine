The oral cavity can act as a gateway to infection and lead to the development of ageusia/dysgeusia. 8 Given the lack of access to diagnostic tests for COVID-19, particularly in the developing world, the utility of distinctive clinical features (such as ageusia/dysgeusia) in identifying patients with suspected COVID-19 is of paramount significance.",

Only one study by B\u00e9n\u00e9zit et al. compared the prevalence of altered taste in COVID-19 positive and negative patients who underwent testing based on suspicion. 2 A significantly increased proportion of patients reported ageusia/dysgeusia (62% vs. 11%, OR: 7.4, p <0.01) in COVID-19 positive arm. 2 There was also a lack of studies reporting an association of ageusia/dysgeusia with severe COVID-19. Mao et al. also compared the presence of altered taste sensations in severe and non-severe COVID-19 cases. A somewhat lower prevalence of ageusia/dysgeusia was seen in severe cases and was not statistically significant (p = 0.24). 5 Second, the inclusion of observational studies can undoubtedly lead to several biases, including but not limited to selection bias, information bias, recall bias, and confounding bias. Third, no study reported the association of acute respiratory distress syndrome, mortality, ICU admission, need for a ventilator, and length of ICU stay with ageusia/dysgeusia. Significant heterogeneity was noted in our analysis of prevalence. This is likely due to the reason mentioned above, i.e., the observational nature of the study.",
