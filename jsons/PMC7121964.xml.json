Many of these networks exhibit the \u201csmall-world\u201d phenomenon, i.e., any two vertices in the network is often connected by a small number of intermediate vertices (the shortest-path distance is small). The small-world phenomenon in the real populations was first discovered by Milgram [12]. In his study, the average distance between two Americans is around 6. Several recent studies [7, 10, 13] offer significant evidence to support similar observations in the online social networks and Internet itself. In addition, the power-law degree distribution (or scale-free property) which many of these networks also directly lead to the small average distance [1]. Clearly, the small-world property can help facilitate the communication and speed up the diffusion process and information spreading in a large network.",

When a system is benefited from the efficient communication and fast information diffusion, it also makes itself more vulnerable to various attacks: diseases, (computer) virus, spams, and misinformation, etc. For instance, it has been shown that a small-world graph can have much faster disease propagation than a regular lattice or a random graph [14]. Indeed, the six degrees of separation may suggest that a highly infectious disease could spread to all six billion people living in the earth about size incubation periods of the diseases [14]. The small-word property of Internet and WWW not only enables the computer virus and spams to be much easier to spread, but also makes them hard to stop. More recently, the misinformation problem in the social networks has made several public outcry [3]. These small-world online social network potentially facilitate the spread of misinformation to reach a large number of audience in short time, which may cause public panic and have other disruptive effects.",

Several studies have focused on modeling the disease epidemics on the small-world and/or scale-free networks [14\u201316]; in [11], Leskovec et al. study how to deploy sensors cost-effectively in a network system (sensors are assigned to vertices) to detect an outbreak; in [3], Budak et al. consider how to limit the misinformation by identifying a set of individuals that are needed to adopt the \u201cgood\u201d information (being immune in epidemics) in order to minimize those being affected by the \u201cbad\u201d information (being infected in epidemics). In addition, we note that from a different angle (viral marketing), there have been a list of studies on the influence maximization problem [8, 17], which aim to discover a set of most influential seeds to maximize the information spreading in the network. From the disease epidemics perspective, those seeds (assuming being selected using contagious model) may need particular protection to prevent an outbreak.",

Different from the pure quarantine approach, here individuals can still perform in the network system, though some contact relationships are forbidden. In other words, instead of removing vertices (individuals) form a network as in the quarantine approach, this strategy focuses on removing edges so that the (potential) outbreaks can be slowed down. Intuitively, if an individual contacts less number of other individuals, the chance for him or her to spread or being infected from the disease (misinformation) becomes less. From the network viewpoint, the edge-removal strategy essentially make the underlying (social) network less small-world, or simply \u201cde-small-world\u201d, i.e., the distances between individuals increase to delay the spreading process. In many situations, such a strategy is often easily and even voluntarily adopted. For instance, during the SARS epidemic in Beijing, 2004, there are much less people appearing in the public places. This approach can also be deployed in complement to the quarantine approach.",

            "text": "Our Contribution. Even though the edge-removal or de-small-world approach seems to be conceptually easy to understand, its mathematical foundation is still lack of study. Clearly, different edges (interactions) in the network are not being equivalent in terms of slowing down any potential outbreak: for a given individual, a link to an individual of high degree connection can be more dangerous than a link to another one with low degree connection. The edge importance (in terms of distance) especially coincides with Kleighnberg\u2019s theoretical model [9] which utilizes the long-range edges on top of an underlying grid for explaining the small-world phenomenon. In this model, the long-range edges are the main factors which help connect the otherwise long-distance pairs with a smaller number of edges. However, there are no direct studies in fitting such a model to the real world graph to discover those long-range edges. In the mean time, additional constraint, such as the number of edges can be removed from the network, may exist because removing an edge can associate with certain cost. These factors and requirements give arise to the following fundamental research problem: how can we maximally de-small-world a graph (making a graph to be less small-world) by removing a fixed number of edges?",

Note that the typical average distance for measuring the small-world effects cannot uniformly treat the connected and disconnected networks; neither does it fit well with the spreading process. We also reformulate the de-small-world as the local-reachable pair cut problem.We prove the NP-hardness of the general reachable pair cut problem and propose a greedy edge betweenness based approach as the benchmark in selecting the candidate edges for solving the de-small-world network. We transform the de-small-world network problem and express it as a OR-AND Boolean function maximization problem, which is also an NP-hard problem.We develop a numerical relaxation approach to solve the de-small-world problem using its OR-AND boolean format. Our approach can find a local minimum based on the iterative gradient optimization procedure. In addition, we further generalize the betweenness measure and introduces the short betweenness, which measures the edge importance in terms of all the paths with distance no greater than a certain threshold. Using this measure, we can speed up the numerical relaxation approach by selecting a small set of candidate edges for removal.We perform a detailed experimental evaluation, which demonstrates the effectiveness and efficiency of proposed approaches.\n",
