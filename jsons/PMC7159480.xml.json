In vitro systems have most frequently been based upon continuous cell lines of bronchial epithelial origin, such as the BEAS\u20102B, A549, 16HBE and others (6). Cultures of human primary bronchial epithelial cells, obtained by bronchoscopy either by brushing or from biopsies, are preferable to continuous cell lines as they more closely represent in vivo conditions (7); more recently, differentiated primary epithelial cells, grown at an air\u2013liquid interface, have been proposed to represent an optimal model for RV infection (8). Lung fibroblasts, either primary or continuous cell lines of embryonic origin (e.g. WI38) have also been popular, as fibroblasts support viral replication. Occasionally, smooth muscle cells, peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC), monocytes, macrophages and eosinophils have been used either to assess viral replication or to model the antiviral immune response.",

Unfortunately, no practical small animal model of RV infection exists; thus for many years experimental RV infection in humans has been the model used to study RV infections. Over the past two decades several experimental studies have been carried out in both asthmatic and normal volunteers, with a good safety record. This approach offers a number of important advantages over studies of natural virus\u2010induced asthma exacerbations, such as the ability to study subjects at baseline before infection; the selection of subjects according to specific criteria such as atopy, asthma severity and medication use; knowledge of the virus type and dose; accurate timing of investigations relative to the timing of infection; and the ability to carry out invasive investigations before, during and after infection, including bronchoscopy for sampling of the lower airway.",

These are accompanied by objective measures of increased airflow obstruction such as reduced peak expiratory flow (PEF) and forced expiratory volume (FEV)1 and enhanced sensitivity to histamine (9, 11, 12). Few experimental infection studies have compared RV infection in asthmatic and normal subjects; however, to date it has not been demonstrated that experimental RV infection in asthmatics is associated with greater changes in lung function than in normals (9, 10), as is the case in naturally acquired infections in adults (13) and infants (14). The lack of a clear difference may be because of the inclusion of subjects with mild asthma only and the small number of subjects studied. Furthermore, the clinical, physiological and inflammatory responses to experimental RV infection in asthmatics are relatively mild compared with exacerbations induced by naturally acquired colds. This may be because of more complex interactions such as concomitant airway inflammation occurring in naturally acquired infections and leading to exacerbations.",

In addition, following a viral infection the response to allergen exposure may be exaggerated, as shown using bronchial provocations with allergen (24, 25). It has been suggested that the defective epithelial repair cycle, characteristic of asthma and strongly correlating with AHR, is amplified by exposure to Th2 cytokines (26). The duration of postviral AHR is around 7 weeks in children with intermittent asthma, comparable with studies prospectively evaluating postviral AHR in experimental animals (27, 28). Although the duration of AHR after a single cold is not affected by the atopic status of the patient, an increased number of symptomatic colds may cumulatively lead to prolonged AHR in atopic children (Fig. 2; 28). Taking into account that the degree of airway responsiveness is indicative of asthma severity and an indirect marker of airway inflammation (29), prolongation of virus\u2010induced AHR may reflect persistent airway inflammation after multiple viral insults (30).",

Although RV in particular was considered in the past as an upper respiratory pathogen only, studies using polymerase chain reaction and in situ hybridization have conclusively shown that RV can also replicate in the lower airways (7, 14). The extent of epithelial cell destruction varies according to the type of virus. Influenza virus may cause extensive epithelial necrosis, whereas RV usually causes little or only patchy epithelial damage; in vitro, RV becomes cytotoxic under specific conditions (31). Death/damage of epithelial cells is likely to result in both an increase in epithelial permeability and an exposure of sensory nerve fibres to irritants and allergens. These effects may contribute to the increased AHR induced by respiratory viral infection. Dead epithelial cells, in addition to other inflammatory cells, dropping into the lumen may also contribute to airway obstruction (32).",

Viral infections upregulate the epithelial expression of ICAM\u20101 both in vivo and in vitro, supporting leucocyte infiltration, while potentially facilitating RV attachment and entry in host cells (33). A similar role could be attributed to vascular adhesion molecule\u20101 (VCAM\u20101; CD106), which is also upregulated by viral infection and selectively recruits eosinophils (34).",

The imbalance between cell death and proliferation is considered crucial in the pathophysiology and pathology of the disease (37). Viruses may cause or interfere with such imbalance. For example, RV infection is able to delay epithelial repair (Fig. 3; 31). The degree of viral cytotoxicity not only depends upon the type of viral pathogen, but is also affected by the host epithelial cells. RV becomes highly cytotoxic only in sparsely cultured cells, a condition that may resemble the already disrupted epithelium occurring in asthma (31). When epithelial cells from patients with asthma were infected with RV in vitro, they were found to be resistant to early apoptosis, an effect caused by lack of the pro\u2010apoptotic interferon (IFN)\u2010\u03b2 (38). Reduced apoptosis was associated with increased viral proliferation within the epithelial cells, resulting into increased cytotoxicity (38). Similar effects were observed when an epithelial cell line was conditioned by exposure to PBMC supernatants: immune cells deriving from atopic asthmatic individuals were unable to protect epithelial cells from RV\u2010induced cytotoxicity (M. Xatzipsalti, unpublished data). Type I IFNs limit virus spread and prime neighbouring cells to an antiviral state.

Submucosal gland (SMG) hypertrophy and mucus metaplasia with increased expression of the MUC5AC gene are seen in the asthmatic airways. Human SMG cells infected with RV produce IL\u20108, contributing to neutrophil inflammation and also augment eosinophil transmigration across the airway epithelium through the secretion of eosinophil chemotactic factors (RANTES, GM\u2010CSF; 41).

Virus\u2010infected cells secrete increased amounts of fibroblast growth factor (FGF)\u20102 (44, 45) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF; 46, 47). RV\u2010induced VEGF was able to augment angiogenesis in an in vitro model (47). Furthermore, imbalance of matrix metalloproteinases regulating the deposition of collagen may also affect remodelling. Virus\u2010induced proinflammatory cytokines stimulate the production and release of matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)\u20109 and MMP\u20102 by epithelial cells (48).

In a recent longitudinal study RV infections were similarly common in healthy and asthmatics; however, the degree of lower respiratory tract symptoms induced by the infection was more severe and prolonged in the asthmatic group (13). It had previously been suggested that the degree of antibody\u2010mediated protection from RV infection is suboptimal in atopic subjects (143). Interestingly, the degree of worsening of asthma seems to be more pronounced in children with high IgE levels vs those with lower (144). Moreover, the odds ratio for wheezing is greater in children with RSV infection if they have evidence of atopy, supporting the theory of detrimental interaction between viruses and an allergic status in the infected patient (145). Nevertheless, it is now clear that the atopic/asthmatic condition may influence the outcome of viral infections independent of the presence of allergen (4, 85). On the other hand, epidemiological studies have shown that sensitized allergic patients suffering from a viral infection have a very pronounced risk of developing a severe asthma worsening if they were concomitantly exposed to the relevant allergen, with an odds ratio of over 8 in adults (146) and almost 20 in children (147; Fig. 6). It is well established that when patients with mild rhinitis and/or asthma are experimentally infected with RV, a concomitant allergen challenge causes greater recruitment of eosinophils, more pronounced histamine release, enhanced bronchial hyperresponsiveness as well as increased risk of developing late asthmatic responses (25). Interestingly, when patients were exposed to RV after allergen exposure, no additive or synergistic effect on several inflammatory parameters was observed (148, 149). It seems therefore that timing of exposure may be important in a synergistic outcome, supported by recent in vitro (150) and animal findings (151).",

A recent study in Kenya monitoring exposure to indoor air pollution and health status of individuals showed a relationship between indoor pollution by biomass combustion and acute respiratory infections in adults and children (152). NO2 has received attention, as it can be emitted from both gas cooking appliances and motor vehicle exhausts, thus representing both an indoor and an outdoor pollutant. The Air Pollution on Health: European Approach (APHEA) project with data from 15 European cities has shown that an increase of 50 \u03bcg/m3 NO2 for 1 h was associated with a 2.6% increase in asthma admissions (153). Children exposed to increased levels of NO2 in school and home showed a significant increase in sore throat, colds and absences from school (154). When personal NO2 exposure and virus presence were assessed in a cohort of asthmatic children, high NO2 exposure was associated with higher infection rates and increased severity of virus\u2010induced asthma symptoms (155). Furthermore, diesel particle exposure increases susceptibility to RSV infection (156) and upregulate RV receptors ICAM\u20101 and LDL (157).",

Detailed studies of the molecular pathways that underlie virus\u2010induced inflammation may help identify new therapeutic targets. While information on different aspects of the antiviral response is increasing, integration of the diverse elements and their interactions into a global model is still missing. In this respect, the role of neural elements in humans requires further attention. Further studies are also needed in order to differentiate between the response of normal and asthmatic individuals to viruses and to clarify the mechanisms that lead to increased severity and/or preclude resolution of infection in the latter. Furthermore, differentiation between atopic and nonatopic responses in asthma is still required, as the majority of studies have focused on atopic asthma. Finally, interactions between multiple triggers and their mechanisms, as well as the impact of virus\u2010induced inflammation on subsequent tissue remodelling are only starting to be unravelled.",
