Conservative estimates put diarrhea in the top five causes of deaths worldwide with 3.5 to 5 million deaths every year and most occurring in young children in nonindustrialized countries (Guerrant et al. 1990). According to the World Health Organization (WHO), diarrheal diseases account for 4.1 % of the total DALY global burden of disease of which 88 % is attributable to unsafe water supply, sanitation, and hygiene. Several waterborne outbreaks of viral gastroenteritis have been reported throughout the world, which may be of particular importance since these outbreaks have the potential to involve large numbers of people and wide geographic areas and, perhaps, to introduce new variants to an area. Here, we have briefly described the viral causes of diarrhea.",

Runoff water after heavy rainfall may contaminate surface water sources (Hedberg and Osterholm 1993). Human fecal wastes contain the viruses, and their numbers and distribution in sewage-polluted waters depend both on the burden of viral disease in the population and on the availability of municipal sewage treatment processing like filtration or chlorination of water supply.",

In 1973, rotavirus was identified in the duodenal mucosa of children with diarrhea by Bishop et al. using electron microscopy. Later, in 1975, astroviruses were described by Madeley and Cosgrove in the stools of infants hospitalized with diarrhea and in outbreaks of gastroenteritis in newborn nurseries (Madeley and Cosgrove 1975). Adenoviruses were first isolated from civilians and army recruits who had respiratory disease (Jones et al. 2005); the enteric adenoviruses were later implicated as a cause of acute diarrhea in children.",

Group specificity of rotaviruses is determined by the internal structural protein, viral protein 6 (VP6) which is the target of commercial immunoassays (Tang et al. 1997). Within each group, rotaviruses are classified into serotypes on the basis of two outer capsid proteins, VP7 (G-protein/glycoprotein) and VP4 (P-protein/protease-sensitive protein) which induce neutralizing antibodies, on the basis of which a binary serotyping system has been developed. Till date, 15 VP7 or G serotypes have been identified. VP4 is a protease-cleaved protein, and serotypes determined by this protein are termed P serotypes. Due to a lack of readily available typing serum or monoclonal antibodies to different VP4 types, 26 different genotypes of VP4 have been identified based on sequence analysis of VP4. These genotypes correlate well with known serotypes, so the genotypes are mentioned in brackets (e.g., P1A[8]) (Estates and Kapikian 2007).",

The intestinal trypsin enzyme cleaves the rotavirus spike protein VP4 into an amino-terminal fragment, VP8, and a carboxy-terminal fragment, VP5. The VP8 fragment contains a hemagglutination domain, and the VP5 fragment contains a membrane interaction domain. Rotavirus enters the cells using several cell surface receptors. When intracellular calcium concentrations fall, rotavirus virions uncoat, forming double-layered subviral particle (DLP). DLPs are transcriptionally active particles composed of genome, VP1, VP3, and the inner two protein layers, which are assembled in viral factories termed viroplasms. The dsRNA transcribes mRNA, the newly transcribed rotavirus mRNA enters two pools, mRNA that remains sequestered within viroplasms is replicated to produce negative-strand RNA which remains associated with the positive strand, while mRNA that escapes viroplasms is translated. The dsRNA segments formed within nascent subviral particles mature by budding through the membrane of the endoplasmic reticulum, when particles acquire their outer capsid proteins (Mendez et al. 1999) (Fig. 4.2).\n",

In developing countries, the incidence of rotavirus diarrhea has varied between 0.07 and 0.8 episodes per child per year (Bresee et al. 1999). The incidence is similar in developed countries, implying that this infection cannot be effectively controlled by improvement in sanitation and hygiene. Incidence of disease peaks among children 4 to 23 months of age, but illness in adults is also known. Neonatal infections are often asymptomatic because of protection from maternal immunity, while infections after 3 months of age are more likely to be symptomatic. Reinfections of rotavirus are common, but disease severity decreases with each repeat infection. Therefore, depending on the epidemiologic setting, the proportion of children with rotavirus diarrhea varies, for example, a median of 8 % of all cases of diarrhea in the community, 28 % of outpatient visits, and 34 % of hospitalizations are accounted for by rotavirus infections (Bresee et al. 1999).",

The four predominant P\u2013G combinations, P[8]G1, P[4]G2, P[8]G3, and P[8]G4, comprise 88.5 % of the strains worldwide (Santos and Hoshino 2005).

The different vaccines available/under development for rotaviruses are as under:\nVaccines based on animal rotaviruses: Considered to be naturally attenuated for humans, the Jennerian vaccines. Three monovalent animal rotavirus vaccines, two bovine rotavirus strains, RIT 4237 (P6[1]G6) and WC3 (P7[5]G6), and a simian (rhesus) rotavirus reassortant vaccine (RRV) strain (P[3]G3) have been studied. Variable efficacy was seen in field trials with these vaccines. China introduced live attenuated oral LLR vaccine that was derived from a lamb strain of rotavirus, the efficacy of which is not known (Dennehy 2008).Human\u2013rhesus RRV (RotaShield): This was the first multivalent live oral reassortant vaccine (a rhesus rotavirus tetravalent [RRV-TV] vaccine), which contained a mixture of four most common G serotypes, G1 to G4: three rhesus\u2013human monoreassortant strains containing the VP7 genes of human serotypes G1, G2, and G4 strains were substituted for the VP7 gene of the parent RRV, and the fourth strain comprised serotype G3 of rhesus RRV (Kapikian 1996). This vaccine was licensed for use in the United States but was then withdrawn from the market because it was causally linked with intussusceptions with an estimated frequency of 1 in 10,000 vaccinated infants.Currently licensed vaccines: Currently, two vaccines have been licensed for human use. First is a pentavalent human-bovine (WC3) reassortant live attenuated oral vaccine (RotaTeq) developed by Merck Research Co. Another is a live attenuated human rotavirus vaccine, strain 89-12, that was originally developed from P1A[8]G1 by tissue culture passage of a wild-type human rotavirus isolate. GlaxoSmithKline Biologicals further modified the vaccine by cloning and tissue culture passaging of the parent 89-12 vaccine strain to develop the resulting vaccine, RIX4414 (Rotarix). Salient features of these two vaccines are shown in Table 4.4.\nCandidate Vaccines: The National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) has developed a tetravalent human-bovine rotavirus reassortant vaccine candidate, which incorporates four reassortants with VP7 specificity for G1, G2, G3, and G4 human serotype and 10 genes from the bovine rotavirus UK strain (P[7]G6). This vaccine showed safety and efficacy in a clinical trial at Finland (Midthun et al. 1985).\n",

But the agent could not be grown in cell culture and organ culture (Blacklow et al. 1972). In 1972, Kapikian et al.

Also, convalescent-phase serum was collected from a volunteer who became ill following inoculation with the fecal filtrate. Using an antigen\u2013antibody reaction, the virus particles were precipitated and the complexes were visualized with an electron microscope.",

Family Caliciviridae is now divided into four genera\u2014Norovirus, Sapovirus, Lagovirus, and Vesivirus. Within each genus, species have been defined based on genetic relatedness. For species Norwalk virus (genus Norovirus) and species Sapporo virus (genus Sapovirus), based on relatedness of VP1, capsid protein genogroups have been proposed which are further classified into genotypes (Atmar and Estes 2001) (Table 4.5). The noroviruses have been subdivided into at least five genogroups designated GI\u2013GV (Lew et al. 1994), most common strains implicated in human disease fall into genogroups GI and GII (Patel et al. 2009). The GI genogroup includes the Norwalk virus, whereas the Snow Mountain and Hawaii viruses belong to genogroup GII.

Because other particles in stool specimens (e.g., cellular membranes) can have similar morphology to coronaviruses, electron microscopic detection of coronavirus particles in stools is not diagnostic of infection.",
