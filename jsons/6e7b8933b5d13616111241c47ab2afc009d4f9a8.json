RFS may provoke seizures and acute encephalopathy and can be considered an internal severe neurotrauma in need of specific treatment. The objective was to describe course of disease, treatment and, for the first time, multimodal monitoring output in a comatose patient suffering RFS. After gastric-banding and severe weight loss, the patient initiated self-starving and was transferred to our intensive care unit (ICU) following rapid refeeding. At arrival, seizures, decrease in consciousness (GCS 7) and suspected acute encephalitis was presented. Serum albumin was 8 g/l. Intracranial pressure (ICP), invasive blood pressure and electrocardiography (ECG) were monitored. Pressure reactivity (PR x ) and compliance (RAP) were calculated. The patient developed congestive heart failure, anuria and general oedema despite maximal neuro-and general ICU treatment. Global cerebral oedema and hypoperfusion areas with established ischemia were seen. ECG revealed massive cardiac arrhythmia and disturbed autonomic regulation. PR x indicated intact autoregulation (\u22120.06 \u00b1 0.18, mean \u00b1 SD) and relatively normal compliance (RAP = 0.23 \u00b1 0.13). After 15 days the clinical state was improved, and the patient returned to the primary hospital. RFS was associated with serious deviations in homeostasis, high ICP levels, ECG abnormalities, kidney and lung affections. It is of utmost importance to recognize this rare syndrome and to treat appropriately. Despite the severe clinical state, cerebral autoregulation and compensatory reserve were generally normal, questioning the applicability of indirect measurements such as PR x and RAP during neuro-intensive care treatment of RFS patients with cerebral engagement.",

RFS is a potentially fatal complex condition, where fluid and electrolyte shifts occur in severely malnourished patients when incautious nutrition is undertaken [2] . When oral, enteral or parenteral nutrition is introduced, glycemia leads to an increase in insulin production and a reduction in glucagon secretion. The increased insulin level stimulates the synthesis of protein, fat and glycogen which results in reduced serum levels of phosphate, potassium and magnesium since these are necessary components in the synthesis process [3] . Additionally, sodium and fluid balance disorders are common [3] . The incidence of RFS is unknown, and there are no clear definitions of this condition [4, 5] .",

However, another factor also found to be significantly associated with the risk of RFS is chronic weight loss following obesity surgery [6] [7] [8] . The incidence of RFS following gastric-banding and other weight reducing surgical procedures is unknown, and although it has been found that RFS might affect the physiological functions of e.g. the cardiac and neurological systems, and even lead to sudden death [5] , the reports and descriptions in scientific literature is scares. Since encephalopathy is a known complication following RFS, though rarely described, this patient was monitored multimodally in our intensive care unit (ICU). The objective of this study was to describe course of disease, treatment and, for the first time, state and changes of the cardiovascular and cerebrovascular systems during ICU care of a severely ill patient suffering from RFS.",

Seven days prior to admission to the local hospital the patient terminated oral intake and was brought to the hospital by relatives. Body weight at admission was 145 kg, the patient was considered severely malnutritioned and was admitted to a surgical ward due to abdominal pain. Bilateral leg swelling was present, and s-albumin was 8 mg/L. Parenteral nutrition as well as enteral nutrition was started with 1800 kcal/day, and albumin was administrated. After three days the patient developed a stiff neck and decreased consciousness. Lumbar puncture was performed with no abnormal findings. Due to suspected septicemia antibiotics was started. The patient's consciousness continued to decrease and intubation was necessary, hence the patient was referred to the local ICU. Caloric intake was reduced, and phosphate was administered. The next day the patient developed fasciculations in left hand, left part of the face, and anisocoria. A computed tomography (CT) scan was performed which revealed cerebral edema (Fig. 1) .

Cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP) was calculated as the difference between mean MAP and ICP. At arrival in the ICU, initial arterial blood gas (ABG) revealed severe acidosis with pH 7.09, base excess \u2212 19.3 mEq/L, standard bicarbonate 9.9 mmol/L and lactate 8.4 mmol/L. The patient was circulatory unstable with need of high doses of norepinephrine, and the oxygen demand was 70%. A cardiac echo examination revealed a dilated right ventricle and severe tricuspid leakage. To optimize contractility, and reduce afterload due to right ventricle failure, intravenous levosimendan and inhalation of sildenafil was initiated. Abdominal echo examination showed ascites but no portal thrombosis. Due to severe acidosis and anuria, hemodialysis was started. Shortly after this the patient developed atrial fibrillation, which was electrically cardioverted to sinus rhythm with frequent bursts of ventricular extrasystolic beats. Laboratory findings are presented in Table 1 . Blood chemistry was analysed in the ISO 15189 accredited laboratory at Ume\u00e5 University hospital.

Therefore, the Figure 5 shows changes in heart rate, as represented by the mean RR interval, and the frequency of arrhythmic heart beats during day 2 to 10 in the ICU. Figure 6 shows the HRV power spectrum over the same time period, where the mean power spectrum was calculated for the same 4 h periods as for ICP, MAP and CPP. During some time periods the distance between density lines in the spectrum is larger than 4 h, indicating that there were not enough 2-minute intervals without arrhythmias to obtain a proper 4 h estimate of the spectral density. From the start of high frequency data recording (day 2 in the ICU) and until day 6 HRV was nearly absent. From approximately day 6 to day 8 there was a successive increase of the power in the very low-frequency region (VLF) near 0.05 Hz. A notable peak in the low-frequency region (LF, around 0.10 Hz) became present from day 8 until the end of recording on day 10. Finally, from day 2 to day 8 there was a small high frequency (HF) component around 0.3 Hz, which corresponded to the ventilator frequency.

Even so parenteral nutrition was initially initiated without reduction of calories or substitution of phosphate. In two recent studies, calorie restriction improved survival RFS [12, 13] , and calorie restriction has been recommended for patients at risk for RFS, or patients with established RFS [6] . The patient developed symptoms of RFS after 3 days, which is consistent with previous studies of symptom onset [14] . The condition described can be compared to an internal severe neurotrauma. Cerebral oedema in RFS is not previously described to our knowledge, even though encephalopathy is reported as a possible consequence [3, 5, 15, 16] . One may speculate that the brain edema and cerebral ischemia would have been less substantial if initial treatment had followed the NICE guidelines.

It may be assessed using the pressure reactivity index (PR x ) [9] , in which MAP is correlated against ICP to indicate an active or passive vasoconstriction in response to changes in MAP. However, some studies also indicate that PR x may be affected by many other factors apart from pressure reactivity, such as alterations in temperature [23] , arterial glucose concentration [24] and red blood cell transfusion [25] . Generally, negative PR x values reflect preserved pressure reactivity while the more positive PR x is, the more disturbed the autoregulation is considered to be. Critical values of PR x have been described, where a threshold of 0.25 has been shown to maximize the prediction of survival, whereas a threshold of 0.05 predict favorable outcome with the highest probability [26] . One may speculate that in a seriously ill patient with cerebral edema, high ICP and low CPP, the cerebrovascular autoregulation is likely to be affected. This should be reflected in parameters applied to assess autoregulation, but according to PR x (Fig. 3a) this patient had an intact cerebrovascular pressure reactivity from day 2 to 8 when treated in the ICU. On day 9 and start of day 10, PR x increased considerably, indicating a disturbed cerebrovascular autoregulation. This was not in line with the patient's clinical progression, and this finding is most likely related to the reduced sedation at this point. When looking at PR x in more detail (Fig. 3b) , a reduced pressure reactivity could be seen during a few 4-hour periods when the index was close to or higher than 0.2. A PR x > 0.2 for a period of six hours or more has been found to be a strong indicator for mortality [27] . In our patient, even though PR x corresponded to a compromised pressure reactivity a few times, most of the time, and as a mean over the whole monitoring period, PR x indicated an intact autoregulation (-0.06 \u00b1 0.18, mean \u00b1 SD). Considering the severe state of this patient these results are conflicting, and it puts the suitability of indirect measurements of cerebral autoregulation based on the PR x index in question regarding RFS patients with cerebral engagement.",

A RAP index close to zero while still having a low ICP corresponds to a preserved intracranial compliance, since there is no correlation between a change in ICP pulse wave amplitude and mean ICP, while a RAP index approaching + 1 or negative values indicates a compromised compliance and an exhausted compensatory reserve respectively [29] . In our patient the RAP index varied between zero and 0.5 with a mean of 0.23. This could be compared to a study investigating the effect of decompressive craniectomy on ICP and cerebrospinal compensation following TBI, where the median (interquartile) RAP index of 27 patients with TBI was 0.4 (0.33;0.68) prior to, and 0.14 (0.12; 0.22) after decompressive craniectomy [31] . Additionally, in a study investigating 358 patients with moderate-to-severe TBI, the mean RAP was 0.638 \u00b1 0.208 [32] . Thus, this severely ill RFS patient seemed to have a compensatory reserve varying within the interval from normal to low throughout the entire monitoring time, without signs of complete exhaustion, and the overall trend in RAP, from day 2 to day 10, was decreasing. Since ICP also decreased during the same time period this implies that the compensatory reserve improved slightly during the treatment period.",

Our patient was initially hemodynamically unstable, but was stabilized when the HRV recording started on day 2. The lack of HRV during day 2 to day 6 in the ICU could reflect a disturbed autonomic regulation. However, a loss of HRV has also been reported during general anesthesia [36] , when the sympatheticnervous activity is markedly reduced. In our patient, there were nearly parallel changes in HRV and sedation level. From day 6 and on, the sedation level was gradually reduced, which was also when the activity in the VLF component started to increase. On approximately day 8, an LF component appeared and the HF component increased in magnitude. This was also the day when extra sedation was given due to increased alertness resulting in increased ICP and MAP. From day 9 and on, the sedation was stopped and HRV was also markedly increased. Since no HRV was recorded afterday 10, we could not evaluate the parasympathetic/sympathetic balance when the patient was without sedation. Note that the changes in HRV were not due to cardiac arrhythmias, since there were a substantial number of 2-min periods without arrhythmias throughout the recording. Thus, we speculate that the changes seen in the HRV were related to the level of sedation as well as autonomous recovery.",

Since multiple organ failure may occur, the initial treatment including correcting electrolyte disturbances and reduction of calorie intake is crucial. Serious deviations in homeostasis, high ICP levels, marked ECG abnormalities, as well as kidney and lung affections were observed. The generally normal manifestation of this patient's cerebral autoregulation and compensatory reserve are difficult to explain due to the prevailing severe clinical state. It is therefore questionable if indirect measurements such as PR x and RAP can be reliably applied during the neurointensive care treatment of RFS patients with cerebral engagement.",
