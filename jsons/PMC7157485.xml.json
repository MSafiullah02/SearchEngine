The advantage of creating patient-sharing networks is that they are quite precise. However, the data of electronic medical claims are personal and private [32], [33], and the data are generally not directly available to the public.

There are three methods for address matching: (1) by street address, (2) by ZIP code, and (3) by boundary information [34], [35], [36]. In this paper, we employed the second approach by using the ZIP code of the providers. The centroid coordinates based on ZIP code were converted into longitude and latitude and then represented by nodes on the map (Fig. 2). The size of each node is the weight added according to the number of different medical services provided by the providers. The greater the number is, the greater the weight, and the larger the point (Fig. 3).",

The epidemic quickly disseminated from Wuhan, and as of 12 February 2020, 45,179 cases have been confirmed in 25 countries, including 1116 deaths [53]. As of March 1, 2020, it has spread to 58 other countries [54]. Recognizing the Wuhan-focused and nationwide outbreak responses in China, the WHO has encouraged countries with heavy air travel exchanges with Wuhan to take precautionary public health measures and, if there is an imported infection, to undertake activities that could lead to the elimination of the virus in human populations, as occurred during the 2003 SARS outbreak [55]. Rapid and effective collaboration between the clinicians (e.g., the general practitioners attending the cases, emergency hotline clinicians, and infectious diseases specialists), the National Reference Centre and the regional and national health authorities has played a crucial role in the systemic capacity to quickly detect, isolate and investigate cases to implement adequate control measures [56], [57].",

First, we constructed a provider-interacting network by employing the publicly available information on the locations and types of healthcare service of providers. Second, we ranked the nodes in the generated provider-interacting network on the basis of four nodal influence metrics. Third, we evaluated the impact of those top-ranked influential nodes in the provider-interacting network by comparing three network indicators. The proposed method is demonstrated by employing the dataset of Physician and Other Supplier Data CY 2017, and can be applied to other similar datasets to help make decisions for healthcare system management, such as the optimization of healthcare resources in the response to public health emergencies.",
