AST, ALT, GLDH, and AP enzyme concentrations in the serum of outbred ICR and C57BL/6 mice were measured in individual mice on day 7 after infection with LCMV-WE or LCMV-Armstrong (Table I) . Enzyme concentrations varied considerably from one mouse to the next in both infected groups, and the uninfected group of mice . The means of the values obtained, or the values determined in pools of serum samples from two to four mice (e.g., Tables II and 111) usually showed great differences between infected and uninfected groups, dependent upon the enzyme measured and various other parameters. Mice infected with LCMV-Armstrong had AST, ALT, GLDH, and AP values that were within normal ranges or were only slightly increased . In contrast, mice infected with LCMV-WE showed serum enzyme values (means of values from pooled sera) that were 10-15 times greater than normal for AST, 10-25 times greater for ALT, and 10-12 times higher for GLDH . AP values were not different from controls on day 7. These increased values signalled severe liver cell damage triggered by LCMV-WE. Dose Dependence . Changes in serum enzyme concentrations depended upon the dose of LCMV-WE injected i.v . (Fig . 1 ) . The increase of serum enzyme levels correlated positively with the increased amount of LCMV injected ; with doses <103 PFU, increases of serum values were small and very variable .",

Characterization of Effector T Cells. The effector cells causing the increase in serum enzyme concentrations were identified as T cells by the following criteria : they were nylon wool nonadherent (Table III) , and they were susceptible to treatment with anti-Thy-1 .2 plus C and anti-Lyt-2 plus C, but resistant to anti-L3T4 plus C treatment (Table I1I) . LCMV-specific cytotoxic activity of 8-d immune spleen cells treated with the various antibodies plus C was as expected ; anti-Lyt-2 plus C treatment abrogated cytolysis by >95%, whereas anti-L3T4 plus C treatment enriched for cytolysic effector T cell function when compared with C treatment alone (Table III) . Cytotoxic activity measured in vitro correlated with the capacity of the same cell populations to cause increases of serum enzyme concentrations. Anti-Lyt-2 plus C-treated cells failed to induce substantial increases, whereas anti-L3T4 plus C-treated cells caused^-10-fold increases of ALT and GLDH concentrations in serum of recipient mice .",

The H-2 restriction of effector T cells causing liver cell destruction was assessed by adoptive transfer (Table IV) tible to LCMV-WE hepatitis ; however, no influence of the murine major histocompatibility gene complex H-2 on susceptibility to LCMV-hepatitis has been found so far. A further crucial factor is the immunocompetence of the host, since euthymic mice do, while nude mice do not develop hepatitis; B cells and antibodies are not significantly involved, whereas activity of cytotoxic T cells parallels histological abnormalities in liver and changes of enzyme (AST, ALT, GLDH) concentrations in serum. Most symptoms of hepatitis fade in parallel with the clearance of virus and the rapid decrease of T cell activities. Mononuclear cells with cytotoxic T cell activity, but lacking NK activity, can be isolated from livers during the period of most florid hepatitis; when compared on a cellfor-cell basis, cytotoxic mononuclear cells from livers were relatively more active than spleen cells. The presented results extend the classical studies on LCM disease describing clinical symptoms of systemic LCMV infections in mice, such as LCMV-induced wasting disease (1, 2) or hematological disorders (8) . In nearly all instances, immune mechanisms mediated by T cells were shown to be responsible for the pathology; in few examples has a direct effect of LCMV on selected cellular functions been demonstrated (27) . However, only in the case of LCMV-induced choriomeningitis have cytotoxic T cells been implicated directly (3, 4, 28, 44) . Our analysis of LCMV-induced hepatitis illustrates that, here also, T celldependent and/or -mediated cell and tissue damage is responsible for disease rather than the virus itself. This is in contrast to other murine hepatitis forms caused by ectromelia virus (mousepox [29] ) and probably also by murine hepatitis virus (MHV) (30) infections, which are mainly caused by the direct cytopathic effect of the virus itself. The model disease described here resembles in some aspects acute hepatitis B virus infections in humans (11) (12) (13) , but differs in others . Hepatitis B virus and LCMV are poorly or noncytopathic (1, 2, 31), may be transmitted from mother to offspring (1, 2, 32) and may establish a virus carrier status in either newborn or adult individuals without causing clinical symptoms (11, 12) . Also, in both infections, liver cell damage does not correlate with virus titers in liver or blood, but rather with the T cell immune response in mice and the presumably T cell-dependent IgG anti-hepatitis B surface antigen response in humans (11, 12, (50) (51) (52) (53) (54) .",

Indirect evidence is provided by the finding that susceptibility to some forms of hepatitis B is weakly linked to major transplantation antigens (38) . Furthermore, immunosuppression with lymphocytotoxic drugs may, dependent upon the particular equilibrium established in a patient between virus spread and immune response, temporarily improve signs of aggressive hepatitis (39) or alternatively, may induce or reactivate it (40) . Also, transfer of HLA nonmatched hepatitis B-immune white blood cells to hepatitis B virus carriers has been shown in one study (41) to cause a rapid but only temporary increase of several liver enzymes in the blood of the recipient .",

The incubation time in hepatitis B seems to be dose dependent and is usually long (weeks to months) . After i.v. infection of LCMV, the incubation period of hepatitis in mice is 6-9 d, and this incubation time is influenced only marginally by the dose of virus used . Another clinically important feature of hepatitis B not found in LCMV hepatitis of ICR or C57BL/6 mice is the form of chronic, aggressive hepatitis; the established model of LCMV-hepatitis corresponds more to an acute form of hepatitis B. It will be of great interest to evaluate in this murine model both viral and host factors that may influence the balance between LCMV spread and immune response, and which may cause more chronic forms of hepatitis.",

When infected with the hepatotropic LCMV-WE isolate, a great number of host cells, including liver cells, are infected and therefore can serve as target cells in vivo for adoptively transferred LCMV-specific effector T cells. Since liver cells store a number of characteristic enzymes, which are released,upon cytolysis, enzyme release could be used as an indication for cell death (44) . Because of the potentially great number of available infected liver target cells, the resulting signal was great enough to be measurable within a relatively short time after adoptive transfer of cells to LCMV-infected immunosuppressed recipient mice . Adoptive transfer of nylon wool-nonadherent, Thy-1, + and Lyt-2,' L3T4, -class I-but not class II-MHC-restricted, and virus-specific cytotoxic T cells to irradiated and preinfected recipients led to a cell dose-and time-dependent linear increase of these enzymes in the serum. The linear time dependence of the serum enzyme changes after transfer suggests that effector T cells destroy infected liver cells in vivo in the same way as T cells lyse \"Cr-labelled infected target cells in vitro (21) . Both types of label releases follow a single-hit kinetics, signalling target cell destruction by cell contact rather than by soluble mediators (45) (46) (47) .",

Antiviral protection measured by virus titer reduction or prevention of titer increases may be interpreted to reflect direct host cell destruction during the eclipse phase of virus infection. This correlation was demonstrated in vitro by the finding that the \"Cr-release from acutely infected target cells paralleled blocking of generation of virus progeny (20, 49) . Tumor cell destruction by cytotoxic T cells was shown by labelling tumor cells and then examining the excretion of the radioactive label (50) . Cytotoxic T cells could be shown to cause rapid radiolabel excretion when both tumor cells and T cells were given i.p. When tumor cells were given i.p. and T cells i.v., label excretion was considerably slower and more difficult to measure accurately during the first 24-48 h, because of the background release of the label and because of the relatively smaller signal . Both of these technical problems have been considerably reduced in this study by using infected liver cells as target cells. In this physiological model, the background was low and stable, and many infected target cells were available and accessible to recirculating effector T cells.",

(d) The general genetic background of the murine host; of the strains tested, Swiss mice and A-strain mice were more susceptible than C57BL or CBA mice ; BALB/c and DBA/2 mice were least susceptible. (e) The degree of immunocompetence of the murine host ; T cell deficient nu/nu mice never developed hepatitis, whereas nu/+ or +/+ mice always did.

This increase was caused by adoptive transfer of lymphocytes if immune cell donors and recipient mice shared class I, but not when they shared class II histocompatibility antigens. The donor cell dosedependent increase of these enzymes was first measurable 6-18 h after transfer with 2 X 108 cells or 3 X 106 cells, respectively . The time-dependent increase caused by the adoptive transfer of 1-2 X 108 cells was strictly linear during a period of up to 25-40 h.
