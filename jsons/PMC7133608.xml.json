We learned that nurses want quick, convenient access to current information and that they learn effectively when they can discuss real-life situations. Accordingly, we developed the course with the following features: Information (presented as text and graphics) on the 5 CTAS levels, course modules, interactive case studies, an online discussion area, an online tutorial, and a workplace project. The course took 6 weeks to complete, and participants typically spent about 4 hours a week online. The cost of the course was paid for by the nurses' hospitals.",

One nurse commented, \u201cIt's made me change my whole approach. I think I'm more efficient and thorough with my assessments.\u201d Another remarked, \u201cLast night someone had something in his eye, a couple of babies came in, and a respiratory problem came in. They all arrived at the same time. Having a rationale now for prioritizing the patient makes things easier.\u201d When in doubt about a patient's status, they were \u201ctriaging up,\u201d that is, erring on the side of patient safety. Nurses reported that the online discussion area provided them with an opportunity to really explore the rationale for assigning patients to a particular triage level. The forum also gave nurses the opportunity to hear about other nurses' experiences and to network, sometimes with nurses working in hospitals more than 3000 miles away.",
