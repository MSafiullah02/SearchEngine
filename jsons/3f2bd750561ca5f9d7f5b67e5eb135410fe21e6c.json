[6] reported that 40 patients (98%) had bilateral involvement. Another study of 99 patients, Chen et al. [5] reported that 74 patients (75%) had bilateral pneumonia, with just 25 (25%) having unilateral pneumonia. In this case series, ground-glass opacities and consolidation were predominant in the peripheral zone and involved the left upper and lower lobes for all three patients. Taking into consideration the predominance of ground-glass opacities, chest CT is more sensitive and findings can be missed on radiographs. Of note, confirmed cases also can have normal chest CTs [7] .",
