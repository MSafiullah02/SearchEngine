Developed at Emory University in 2004 by Professor Negi, CBCT\u00ae is based on techniques from the Indo-Tibetan Buddhist tradition. As a secularized protocol, however, CBCT\u00ae is independent from and supportive of any faith or belief system. The course is typically taught in weekly meetings supplemented by daily guided meditation recordings. Group meetings for this study were structured approximately as follows: welcome agenda setting (5 min), homework review (15 min), participants\u2019 summary of past week\u2019s material (10 min), didactics (20 min), mindfulness exercise incorporating new concepts (15 min), meditation incorporating new concepts (15 min), homework assignment, and question/answer session (10 min). Participants were provided with a written manual to facilitate their understanding of the material. Homework involved daily meditation practice, which gradually increased from 6 min per day at the beginning to 15 min per day at the end. CBCT\u00ae includes tools with the explicit aim of expanding compassion to be more inclusive, broadening the sense of in-group, and dampening out-group bias.",

Participants begin by recalling a time or place in which they were safe and taken care of by another to prime a sense of safety and security to sustain this positive affect and increase the awareness of the value of compassion in their own lives. Next, participants take part in an attention-training practice\u2014following the sensations of the breath as they unfold\u2014to promote attentional stability and mental clarity; a key objective of this is to learn to notice and release (\u201ccatch and release\u201d) distractions as they arise. This increased mental stability then supports present-moment awareness, sometimes called open monitoring. Here, the attentional focus shifts to how mental experiences unfold from moment to moment, as the practitioners attempt to neither push away such experiences nor become overly involved in them. This practice improves calmness of mind and provides insight into habitual mental patterns.",

Humans are fundamentally social creatures; relating constructively and positively with others is central to anyone\u2019s well-being. Thus, the participant goes on to examine how all people, despite many differences, share a fundamental desire for being well, flourishing and avoiding distress and dissatisfaction. This practice leads to a greater capacity to see others as like oneself at a basic level, setting the stage for greater empathic response and more inclusive compassion. Next, participants spend time reflecting on how their own well-being is dependent on the efforts of others, thus cultivating an appreciation for the received kindness of others, intended or unintended. These teachings are meant to generate authentic gratitude, moderate unrealistic attitudes of independence and isolation, and generate a deepening affection, even for those outside one\u2019s social group.",

Here, the participant embraces others as deserving of understanding and care because everyone\u2014including loved ones, but also strangers and even difficult people\u2014has inherent value and the equal right to pursue freedom from suffering. By focusing on the difficulties and distress experienced by so many, a deeper empathic response is evoked, and when supported by the inner strength developed earlier in the practice, this empathy is transformed to become an engaged and motivated sense of caring for others and lead to more spontaneous and consistent prosocial thoughts and behaviors.",

Initial modification was aimed at increasing military/Veteran relevance and facilitating use by individuals with psychopathology. The guided meditations encourage emotional experiences and thus could be difficult for individuals with PTSD to tolerate. The therapist spent time in session talking about this possibility and how to handle it and made herself available between sessions as needed. Veterans were provided with strategies for managing flashbacks or strong emotions that are consistent with the practice, e.g., taking a deep breath and reseating oneself, then returning attention to the breath. Similarly, difficulty focusing could be handled by placing hands on one\u2019s belly (to get a physical reminder of breathing) and breathing until the experience passed.",

Education in the science of compassion, including brief videos to illustrate difficult concepts, supplemented straightforward didactic materials that were provided in the participants\u2019 manuals. In addition, we believed that it was important that Veterans apply meditation practices to PTSD-relevant experiences, so homework was designed to encourage and help trouble-shoot that process. The language from the original CBCT\u00ae guided meditations was retained to the extent possible to maintain consistency of the intervention, although adaptations to reflect an 8th grade reading level and Veteran-relevant terminology were important to foster accessibility of the material. In addition, group discussion was used to enhance understanding and application of the material.",

            "text": "Finally, we were concerned that the group nature of the intervention, which is the standard for instruction in meditation, could create a barrier to individuals who typically prefer one-on-one therapy. On one hand, compassion is often enhanced by exposure to experiences of others shared in the class and Veterans can help each other through the struggles and joys of learning meditation. On the other hand, individuals who have experienced trauma are frequently uncomfortable with discussing symptoms or traumatic experiences in a group setting. To manage this concern, potential participants were helped to understand that the focus of the class was learning meditation rather than discussing traumatic events. It is our aspiration, however, that the skills developed in the group will facilitate one\u2019s ability to discuss and cope with distressing experiences, such as during trauma-focused psychotherapy. To the extent that traumatic events were brought up by group members, the group leader gently redirected the discussion from trauma specifics to expressing the ways in which they were cognitively or emotionally impacted while meditating. Participants were encouraged to remain after class to discuss specific concerns that might not be central to the group\u2019s current work, and referrals to additional services were provided as needed.",

The changes, which were evaluated based on subsequent participant feedback, were as follows. The groups were reduced from 120 to 90 min to reflect participant comments about the group seeming too long. Veterans requested more time for group discussion and cohesion-building, so classes were reviewed to balance presenting material and exercises with group process. Meditation exercises also were reconfigured to involve paired work or group interaction to foster a feeling of group cohesion while maintaining the integrity of the intervention\u2019s goals. To address perceived deficits in conceptual understanding of the intervention that we identified in the qualitative interviews, Veterans were asked to \u201cteach\u201d previously presented concepts to other group members with others being encouraged to chime in if there were other items that might facilitate learning. The class was extended from 8 sessions to 10 to make up for the change in session length and to allow time for discussion and review/skill consolidation. One concern that may be unique to this population was that tinnitus was experienced as louder when there were silences in the recorded guided meditations. These participants were reminded that this experience was common for them throughout their lives, that this was their \u201cnew silence,\u201d and that if distracted by the ringing, they could bring their attention back to the breath. Finally, some Veterans had difficulty accessing the guided meditations because of unfamiliarity with technology. To manage this, study staff took a more active role in providing support. Table 1 presents the final intervention outline.",

Qualitative interviews were conducted by an experienced qualitative interviewer (SH) with the aim of learning about the understandability, applicability, and efficacy of CM for this group. Interviews were conducted by phone within 2 weeks of the conclusion of the last session attended to give participants an opportunity to reflect on their experience and learning. Each interview lasted approximately 30 min. The interviews were recorded and notes were taken by the interviewer to capture participant responses. The semi-structured interview guide posed nine reflective questions that focused around the (a) experience of practicing CM, (b) potential changes noted from skills they had learned at each intervention session, and (c) personal changes that participants perceived in managing both pleasant and unpleasant situations in their life because of their CM training.",

Although there are differences in terms of content and therapy time within the groups, we believe that the aggregated data are informative in terms of our goals of evaluating the feasibility and clinical impact of CBCT-Vet as the fundamental intervention (CBCT\u00ae) remained the same. A flowchart was generated to capture the flow of subjects throughout the study (refer to Fig. 1). Descriptive statistics were used to characterize the participants before treatment. The collection of qualitative data was useful to explore details about participant perceptions of the intervention. Specifically, the qualitative data provided a contextual understanding of differences in participants\u2019 reactions and how that influenced their adaptability to the dynamics of the intervention, as well as ways in which they negotiated the practice of CM for stressful life situations. Descriptive statistics were used to characterize the sample. Mixed effects models were applied to measures that were captured weekly, and repeated measures analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used for pre-post change. Effect sizes (partial eta squared) were calculated based on the first and last completion of each clinical measure.",

Many mentioned that it was at least 3\u20134 weeks before people felt comfortable in the group, and they worried that because of the time needed to adjust, they had lost time in adequately learning the initial materials, which were built upon in subsequent later sessions. On the other hand, some felt that it was challenging to give everyone a chance to talk during informal discussions, particularly after the group became comfortable. Finally, most participants stated that different learning levels in the class might have been better supported by providing more practice time with new material during the sessions to make some of the homework easier to absorb.

Weekly symptom assessment is standard for PTSD treatment; nonetheless, the frequency of use of these tools may influence participant responding. Future studies should include alternative measures before and after treatment.
