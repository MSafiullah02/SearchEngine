            "text": "Like other known coronaviruses, SARS-CoV is an enveloped, plus-strand RNA virus that features the largest RNA genomes currently known. The SARS viral genome comprises approximately 30,000 nucleotides, which are organized into 14 functional open reading frames (ORFs) (Rota et al., 2003, Thiel et al., 2003). Analysis of the nucleotide sequence of this novel coronavirus revealed a similar pattern of gene organization typical of coronaviruses (Marra et al., 2003, Rota et al., 2003). Two large, 5\u2032-terminal overlapping ORFs, 1a and 1b of the replicase gene encode two polyproteins, pp1a and pp1ab (Fig. 1\n) (Rota et al., 2003, Thiel et al., 2003). Like other coronaviruses, the nascent SARS-CoV replicase polyproteins are processed by virus-encoded proteinases, and in this case, two proteinases have been identified: a 3C-like proteinase (3CLpro) and a papain-like proteinase (PLP) (Denison et al., 1992, Snijder et al., 2003, Ziebuhr, 2004). The processed end products of pp1a are designated nonstructural proteins (nsp) 1 to nsp11 and those of pp1ab are designated nsp1 to nsp16. Cleavage by the viral main protease, 3CLpro results in generating the nsp8 protein which is currently of undesignated function. The nsp8 protein has been shown to associate with several other nsps and to colocalize with these nsps in cytoplasmic complexes that are important for viral RNA synthesis (Prentice et al., 2004a, Prentice et al., 2004b, Sutton et al., 2004, Zhai et al., 2005). The +RNA coronavirus usually encode a non-structural protein (nsp12 for SARS-CoV) that includes an RdRp domain, conserved in all RNA viruses. The SARS-CoV uniquely encodes a second RdRp residing in nsp8, responsible for initiation of the synthesis of complementary oligonucleotides smaller than 6 residues long, at relatively low fidelity. These nsp8 RdRp produced primers are postulated to be utilized by the primer-dependent nsp12 RdRp for replication (Imbert et al., 2006).",

These accessory proteins are postulated to be non-essential in tissue culture but may provide a selective advantage in the infected host. The ORF3a protein has been studied to some details (Tan et al., 2006) and has been shown to be expressed in infected cells (Tan et al., 2004c, Yu et al., 2004, Zeng et al., 2004). ORF3a protein has been shown to bind the spike protein (Zeng et al., 2004, Tan et al., 2004c) and recent work demonstrated that it is a novel structural protein (Ito et al., 2005). The ORF7a protein was also detected in infected cells and has been found to localize in the ER-Golgi intermediate compartments where coronaviruses are known to assemble (Fielding et al., 2004, Nelson et al., 2005). In addition, ORF3a, ORF3b and ORF7a proteins have been shown to induce apoptosis (Tan et al., 2004a, Law et al., 2005, Yuan et al., 2005). Two recent papers on the ORF6 accessory protein also demonstrated its expression during infection and have showed that it may be important for viral pathogenesis (Geng et al., 2005, Pewe et al., 2005). Most recently the ORF6 protein has been shown to accelerate replication of a related mouse virus, a property that may contribute towards its increased in vivo virulence (Tangudu et al., 2007).",

Similarly the ORF6 protein was PCR cloned and expressed in yeast two-hybrid vectors resulting in an N-terminal in-frame fusion protein with the GAL4 DNA binding domain (BD). In order to check for correct reading-frame constructs, the final plasmids were sequenced and checked for in-vitro protein expression. Saccharomyces cerevisiae AH109 cells were transformed with single plasmids, or co-transformed with the GAL4 BD- and AD-vectors containing SARS Co-V ORF6 and/or nsp8, respectively. The AH109 host strain containing pAS2-N and pACT2-N were used as positive controls (Surjit et al., 2004). AH109 contains integrated copies of both HIS3 and lacZ reporter genes under the control of GAL4 binding sites. The results of the two-hybrid assay are shown in Fig. 2A. Single transformants used in this assay were yeast (AH109) cells containing BD-ORF6, and host cells containing AD-nsp8, also yeast cells containing only the BD- and only the AD-vectors, were also used as negative controls. All these transformants and co-transformants grew well on the unrestricted YPD plate (non-selective media). Also, the untransformed host cells were plated as a negative control. Single transformants containing the BD-by itself or as a fusion with the ORF6 protein, showed growth on the synthetic dextrose Trp\u2212 plate (SDTrp\u2212). Correspondingly, single transformants containing the AD- by itself or as a fusion with nsp8 showed growth on the synthetic dextrose Leu\u2212 plate (SDLeu\u2212). The co-transformants were similarly plated on YPD and synthetic dextrose medium lacking Trp or Leu or Trp, Leu and upon positive growth on these was subsequently plated on His\u2212 medium (SD Trp\u2212Leu\u2212His\u2212) to test for His prototrophy. Growth of the co-transformants, containing the BD-ORF6 and AD-nsp8 constructs, in both SDTrp\u2212 and SDLeu\u2212 plates simply showed that both plasmids were present in the transformed cells. Growth of these clones on the SD Trp\u2212Leu\u2212His\u2212 media showed that the transcription of the HIS3 gene was turned on by the reconstitution of the GAL4 transactivator due to a specific ORF6\u2013nsp8 interaction. Colonies were transferred on to nitrocellulose filters and a \u03b2-galactosidase filter assay was performed as described in methods. The co-transformants containing both the BD-ORF6 and AD-nsp8 constructs along with all positive and negative controls were used in this assay. Results obtained from the \u03b2-galactosidase filter assay were in agreement with the results obtained from the SDHis\u2212 growth experiments.",

Negative controls (host untransformed cells) showed almost no liquid \u03b2-galactosidase activity. BD-SNF1/AD-SNF4 was the positive control whereas the clones containing BD-ORF6/AD-nsp8 were the test samples in this experiment (Fig. 2B). Relative enzymatic activity was determined in five independent transformants from each group. Our results from this assay indicate a moderate strength protein\u2013protein interaction between the AD-nsp8 and BD-ORF6 proteins. This observation was further confirmed by the use of a 3-AT gradient on which the His+ phenotype was tested (Fig. 2C). 3-AT is known to be a competitive inhibitor of HIS3 protein, thus enhancing the stringency of selection, it reduces the background signal by inhibiting the product of the HIS3 reporter. This result clearly showed that the interaction of nsp8 with ORF6 was not as strong as the N\u2013N dimerization positive control interaction. On plates with increasing concentrations of 3-AT, the growth ability of the His+ colonies diminished and was almost undetectable at 5 mM 3-AT concentrations.",

For detection of the expressed proteins, the lysates were immunoprecipitated using the respective antibodies i.e. anti-His antibody was used for detection of the nsp8 protein and anti-myc antibody was used for the detection of the ORF6 protein. When the two cell lysates were mixed in equal proportions, one of the two antibodies was added and subsequently pulled out using Protein A Sepharose beads, we observed the interacting protein to be present in the gel as well. This procedure was repeated conversely to show the other corresponding antibody pull out the interacting protein partner as well (Fig. 3B). When anti-His antibody was used to pull out the nsp8 protein from the mixture of proteins, it also pulled out the ORF6 protein. Similarly, when anti-myc antibody was used to pull out the ORF6 protein, the nsp8 protein was also observed to be pulled out as an interaction partner of ORF6. In a control experiment we observed no ORF6 protein binding directly to the anti-His antibody Sepharose-A complex and similarly observed no binding of the nsp8 protein to the anti-myc antibody Separose-A complex (Fig. 3C). These results clearly showed that the two proteins nsp8 and ORF6 interacted with each other.",

The cells were harvested at 0 or 24 h post-infection (h.p.i.) and the lysates were subjected to Western blot analysis to determine the expression of nsp8 and ORF6 proteins (Fig. 5\n).

The protein that migrated at \u223c 24 kDa matched the predicted molecular mass of nsp8 while the slower migrating protein (\u223c 65 kDa) may be an aggregated form of nsp8. As expected, the ORF6 protein was also detected at 24 h.p.i. and not at 0 h.p.i. (lower panel, lanes 1 and 2). Cell lysates obtained at 24 h.p.i. were then subjected to immunoprecipitation with either an irrelevant antibody (rabbit anti-Flag polyclonal antibody, lane 3) or rabbit anti-ORF6 polyclonal antibody (lane 4) and protein-A agarose beads. Western blot analyses showed that nsp8 protein (\u223c 24 kDa) was co-immunoprecipitated when anti-ORF6 antibody was used but not when an irrelevant antibody was used, indicating that the nsp8 interacts specifically with ORF6 in SARS-CoV infected cells (upper panel, lanes 3 and 4).",

Most of the ORF6 protein seen in infected cells were observed in a punctate staining pattern consistent with a vesicle-associated intracellular distribution. Using the rabbit polyclonal antibody against ORF6 (Abgent) and purified supernatant from hybridomas producing monoclonal antibodies against the nsp8 protein (see Materials and methods), cells infected with an isolate of SARS-CoV (strain HKU39849) were examined by indirect immunofluorescence to determine if the two proteins colocalized, as their interaction would suggest. The extent of colocalization seen between the two proteins was significant, both localizing to the same set of punctate structures (Fig. 6, middle panel, D). The punctate distribution of nsp8 has been previously described (Prentice et al., 2004a) and the colocalization of ORF6 protein with nsp8 suggests that ORF6 could be associated with the SARS-CoV replicase complex, localized to a subset of the vesicular trafficking complex in mammalian cells. These ORF6-containing vesicular structures did not colocalize with AP-1 and LAMP-2 (data not shown), which are present in early and late endosomes respectively. However, the ORF6 protein does colocalize with LAMP-1 (Fig. 7\n), which is a lysosomal marker. LAMP-1 has been used as a marker for characteristic double-membrane vesicles seen in infections by other viruses (Jackson et al., 2005) and it has been shown that at least one other coronavirus induces these double-membrane vesicles, presumably as a site for the assembly of virus replication complexes (Prentice et al., 2004b). Given this, the ORF6 protein might localize to these vesicles which have been suggested to be derived from the cellular autophagosomal machinery, but further study will be required. A recent structural study of the nsp8 protein has suggested a role for the nsp8\u2013nsp7 hexadecamer in binding dsRNA intermediates in the viral replication cycle (Zhai et al., 2005), further lending impetus to such a study.",

We demonstrated the strength and specificity of this interaction by three independent methods, i.e. by yeast-2-hybrid, co-immunoprecipitation using in-vitro translated proteins in a cell-free system and co-immunoprecipitation using lysates from Vero E6 cells. Interestingly, two previous publications on ORF6 have shed some light on its possible function in viral pathogenesis. Geng and co-workers detected ORF6 protein in lung and intestine of SARS patients and showed that it could stimulate cellular DNA synthesis when overexpressed (Geng et al., 2005). Pewe et al. (2005) showed that when SARS-CoV ORF gene was introduced into an attenuated murine coronavirus, the recombinant virus grew faster in cell culture and also exhibited enhanced lethality of infection in mice. In contrast, Yount and co-workers reported that the SARS-CoV virus with ORF6 deleted has the same viral replication kinetics as the wild-type virus in cell-culture and mice (Yount et al., 2005). Hence, ORF6 is non-essential for viral replication in these models although it cannot rule out that ORF6 (and/or the other accessory proteins of SARS-CoV) contributes to the virulence and pathogenesis of SARS coronavirus infection in its natural host. Further experiments in more robust animal models, like non-human primates that demonstrate clinical disease upon SARS-CoV infection, will be needed to determine the actual function of ORF6 during SARS infection in vivo. Since our data shows that ORF6 interacts with nsp8 which is part of the replicase complex (Prentice et al., 2004a, Prentice et al., 2004b), it will be important in future studies to determine if the interaction between ORF6 and nsp8 can modulate the viral synthesis process and to determine how ORF6 modulates viral pathogenesis in these animal models.",

The full-length nsp8 and ORF6 genes of the SARS coronavirus (Tor2 isolate) were PCR-amplified from a genomic construct of clone NC_004718 (Fig. 1), and cloned into the pCR-XL-TOPO vector (Invitrogen). The full-length nsp8 and ORF6 genes were subjected to DNA sequencing and the inserts were verified against the corresponding region of the SARS coronavirus complete genome NC_004718. The nsp8 gene was excised from the pCR-XL-TOPO-nsp8 construct using the restriction enzymes NcoI and EcoRI, and ligated into the yeast two-hybrid Activation Domain vector, pACT2 to generate an N-terminal in-frame fusion with the GAL4 activation domain (AD). The ORF6 gene was excised from the pCR-XL-TOPO-ORF6 construct using the restriction enzymes EcoRI and PstI, and cloned into the yeast two-hybrid DNA Binding Domain (BD) vector pGBKT7 in fusion with the GAL4 DNA-binding domain to express an N-terminal fusion protein. Similarly the NcoI and EcoRI sites were used to clone the nsp8 gene into the pRSET vector to give the construct pRSET-nsp8. All DNA manipulations were performed as described by Sambrook et al. (1989). All constructs were verified by restriction digestion and DNA sequencing.",

The host strain containing the Nucleocapsid protein (N) of SARS virus fusion constructs pACT2-N and pAS2-N, shown previously to form a homodimer (Surjit et al., 2004) was used as a positive control. The AH109 host contains integrated copies of both HIS3 and lacZ reporter genes under the control of GAL4 binding sites. The AH109 yeast strain was transformed with the appropriate plasmids, using the lithium acetate procedure and grown on SD plates in the absence of Trptophane (Trp) and Leucine (Leu); (SDTrp\u2212 and SDLeu\u2212). Protein interaction was tested on SD plates without Leu, Trp and Histidine (SDLeu\u2212 Trp\u2212 His\u2212). After 3 days at 30 \u00b0C, individual colonies were streaked out and tested for liquid and filter-lift \u03b2-galactosidase activity, 5 mM 3-amino-1,2,3-trizole assay (3AT) and the liquid \u03b2-galactosidase assay (Ober et al., 2002, Peiris et al., 2003, Pewe et al., 2005). The filter \u03b2-galactosidase assay, a parameter directly reflecting the strength of protein\u2013protein interactions, was performed by streaking doubly transformed yeast colonies onto filter paper and allowing them to grow for 2 days on selection medium. Yeast was permeabilized by freezing yeast-impregnated filters in liquid nitrogen, and thawing at room temperature. This filter was placed over a second filter that was pre-soaked in Z buffer (pH 7.0) containing 10 mg/ml 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-\u03b2-d-galactopyranoside (X-gal) and 0.27% \u03b2-mercaptoethanol. Filters were left for 18 h to develop a blue color, which indicated a positive protein\u2013protein interaction. The liquid \u03b2-galactosidase activity was determined using the substrate CPRG as described previously (Tyagi et al., 2001, Tyagi et al., 2002). Relative enzymatic activity was determined in five independent transformants. Data for quantitative assays were collected for yeast cell number and are the mean \u00b1 S.E.M. of triplicate assays. Appropriate positive/negative controls and buffer blanks were used. The yeast Y187 host strain containing BD-1111 and AD-1112 were used as positive controls for these assays.",

The vector, cell-lines and viruses used here were kind gifts from Baxter Vaccine. ORF6 was amplified from cDNA prepared from SARS-CoV infected cells as previously described (Tan et al., 2004b) and the pair of primers used is ORF6_forward (5\u2032-GCAAGCTTATGTTTCATCTTGTTGA-3\u2032) and ORF6_reverse (5\u2032-CCGGCGGCCGCTTATGGATAATCTAACACC-3\u2032). The amplicon was digested with HindIII and NotI and cloned into the compatible sites of the pDD4-mh5 vector to create plasmid pDD4-mh5/ORF6. The pDD4-mh5 vector can be used to generate growth-competent recombinants expressing foreign genes in the D4 locus via a rescue method as previously described (Holzer and Falkner, 1997). Essentially, the parental virus lacking the D4 gene is replication negative in the usual permissive host lines and only the reintegration of D4 into the virus genome allows for growth in these lines. This is in contrast to classical drug-based screening approaches which have previously been well established in the generation of vaccinia recombinants.",

The supernatant was removed, replaced with 2 ml DMEM containing no FBS or antibiotics and cells were transfected with 5 \u03bcg pDD4-mh5/ORF6 using lipofectamine reagent (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA), according to the manufacturer's protocol. After 3 days, advanced cytopathic effect was evident and the cells were harvested and subjected to Western blot analysis (see below) for determining ORF6 expression. Alternatively, the cells and culture supernatant were harvested together and then subjected to three rounds of freeze-thawing and clarified by centrifugation at 1500 rpm for 5 min. The supernatant, which constitute the P1 viral stock, was used to infect fresh CV-1 cells after which the P2 viral stock was harvested in the same manner and stored at \u2212 80 \u00b0C before use. The P2 viral stock was titered in CV-1 cells. This approach of dominant host range selection provides a stringent and time-saving method for obtaining vaccinia recombinants carrying foreign genes and has been described previously (Holzer et al., 1998). The recombinant vaccinia virus expressing the SARS-CoV S protein was previously generated using the same methods (Lip et al., 2006).",

The anti-GAL4TA antibody was purchased from Santa Cruz. Monoclonal antibody against the nsp8 protein was prepared as follows: bacterially expressed glutathione S-transferase (GST)-nsp8 fusion protein was used to immunize BALB/c mice as previously described (Fielding et al., 2004). The spleen was excised from a mouse that showed strong antibody response and hybridoma fusion was performed to generate hybridomas producing monoclonal anti-nsp8 antibodies as previously described (Lip et al., 2006). All procedures on the use of laboratory animals were performed by trained personnel in accordance with the regulations and guidelines of the National Advisory Committee for Laboratory Animal Research (NACLAR), Singapore. The culture supernatants from several of these hybridoma clones were pooled and purified using a HiTrap protein G HP column (Amersham) and verified by immunofluoresence assay to be specific to the nsp8 protein.",

(B) Liquid \u03b2-galactosidase assay results of the nsp8\u2013ORF6 protein\u2013protein interactions. Single transformants and co-transformants were analyzed in a liquid \u03b2-galactosidase assay and compared with each other. Values given are in arbitrary units.

(A) The His6-tagged nsp8 and myc-tagged ORF6 proteins were produced by coupled transcription\u2013translation in the presence of 35S-Met and detected using their corresponding antibodies (Anti-His and anti-myc, respectively). Both nsp8 and ORF6 proteins were visible and corresponded to their correct molecular sizes on 12% and 20% SDS-PAGE, respectively. (B) The 35S-Met-His-nsp8 and 35S-Met-myc-ORF6 proteins were detected by autoradiography. The nsp8\u2013ORF6 complex was detected by both anti-His and anti-myc antibodies on 16% SDS-PAGE. When nsp8 was probed for using anti-His antibody, the ORF6 protein was visible and when ORF6 protein was probed using myc antibody, the nsp8 protein was visible. (C) In a control reaction, the 35S-Met-His6-nsp8 and 35S-Met-myc-ORF6 proteins showed no cross-reactivity with the other antibody used in the pull-down experiments. Also this control experiment shows that the proteins do not non-specifically bind to the beads used in the results shown in panel B. Lane 1 shows the nsp8 protein immunoprecipitated by anti-His, lane 2 does not show nsp8 protein band when immunoprecipitated by anti-myc.
