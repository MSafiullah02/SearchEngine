            "text": "More than 20 years, sepsis was defined as symptoms associated with the response to microorganism infection, which was more specifically called systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS). With the evidence of organ failure, it was called severe sepsis, and this could lead to hypotension (septic shock) [1]. However, with the deep understanding of the pathophysiology of sepsis, sepsis has been known as both inflammatory and anti-inflammatory. Additionally, the classic use of SIRS could lead to overestimation of sepsis. For example, usual common cold could be identified as sepsis in classic definition [2]. With this background, new sepsis definition, Sepsis 3, was introduced with expert consensus, literature review, and finally big data analysis. Sepsis was defined as a \u201clife-threatening organ dysfunction caused by a dysregulated host response to infection.\u201d They recommended the use of sequential organ failure assessment (SOFA) score as clinical criteria for sepsis in ICU encounters. More specifically, increase in SOFA score of two points or more should be used. In non-ICU encounters, quick SOFA score was recommended as screening tool, and qSOFA score of two or more was set to identify high-risk patients. The concept of classical severe sepsis was eliminated. Septic shock was newly defined as sepsis with fluid-unresponsive hypotension, serum lactate level greater than 2 mmol/L, and need for vasopressors to maintain mean arterial pressure of 65 mmHg or greater (Fig. 5.1) [3, 4].\n",

Immune cells not only are able to recognize invading organisms and their products so they can destroy them but also release a series of mediators that can activate other cells. Toll-like receptors, among cell membrane receptors, are implicated in the recognition of pathogenic agents. Cellular stimulation activates intracellular signaling and results largely in the activation of transcriptional factors (including nuclear factor kappa B), which initiate proinflammatory reactions in turn. A number of cytokines, mainly tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-\u03b1) and interleukin (IL)-1, are released by macrophages and other cells. TNF-\u03b1 and IL-1 are particularly important proinflammatory cytokines that can reproduce all features of septic shock including hypotension and development of multiple-organ failure (MOF) in animal studies. Anti-inflammatory mediators including IL-4 and IL-10 are also released during the sepsis response, which limit the effects of proinflammatory mediators and can lead to a state of relative immunosuppression sometimes called immunoparalysis [7]. When sepsis is diagnosed, many patients are already immunosuppressed [8].",

Briefly, the activation of tissue factor on the surface of various cells, particularly monocytes and endothelial cells, initiates the coagulation system [13]. Endotoxin, TNF-\u03b1, and IL-1 are the key mediators. The plasma levels of natural anticoagulants such as protein C, protein S, and antithrombin are significantly reduced in sepsis by reducing their synthesis and increasing their consumption and clearance. In early sepsis, thrombolysis is also stimulated with an increase in the levels of plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1). The net result is a balance in favor of procoagulant processes, often leading to DIC and participating in the microcirculatory disorder that leads to MOF in many patients with sepsis. This sequence of events leads to consumption of coagulation factors and the fibrinolytic system is suppressed in late sepsis and that promotes capillary leakage, bleeding, and third-space fluid shift (Fig. 5.2).",

Although PLR induces an increase in cardiac preload with its maximum effect at approximately 1 min, the effect is not sustained and vanishes completely when the legs are returned to the horizontal position. Thus, the hemodynamic effects of PLR must be assessed during a time frame of 30\u201390 s with a fast-responding method. No difference in diagnostic performance of PLR was seen in spontaneously breathing patients compared with controlled mechanically ventilated patients. Therefore, PLR has been proposed as an attractive way to predict fluid responsiveness and showed good diagnostic accuracy in meta-analysis [35]. The pooled sensitivity and specificity of PLR-induced changes in cardiac output were 89.4% (84.1\u201393.4%) and 91.4% (85.9\u201395.2%), respectively.",

Procalcitonin-guided therapy is defined as initiation of antibiotic treatment using PCT measurements, usually using a suggested treatment algorithm based on the height of the PCT measurement. Many studies used a cutoff of 0.25 ng/mL to suggest or encourage the initiation of antibiotics [51]. Multiple studies have investigated whether a PCT-guided algorithm can optimize the therapeutic approach in sepsis patients, mainly by monitoring PCT kinetics and stopping antibiotics once PCT has dropped to levels <0.5 ng/mL or by at least 80\u201390% of the peak in combination with clinical improvement. A meta-analysis including 1075 patients with sepsis or septic shock found overall reduced antibiotic treatment courses (6 days vs. 8 days) when PCT was used to guide therapy compared to routine care. There was no increase in 28-day or in-hospital mortality or in length of stay in the ICU or the hospital. The authors do stress that there was heterogeneity in PCT protocols across trials with regard to different cutoff values or different algorithms for medical or surgical patients [52]. A large RCT evaluated the use of PCT to de-escalate and stop antibiotics in critically ill patients who had received antibiotics <24 h before inclusion in the study for an assumed or a proven infection. The study found that the PCT-guided protocol shortened length of antibiotic treatment (5 days vs. 7 days in the first 28 days of admission) and lowered 28-day mortality from 25% to 19.6% [53].",

Several retrospective studies have suggested that obtaining cultures prior to antimicrobial therapy is associated with improved outcome [54]. However, the identification of an organism in culture in a patient with suspected sepsis is highly supportive of the diagnosis but is not necessary. The rationale behind its lack of inclusion in the diagnostic criteria for sepsis is that a culprit organism is frequently not identified in up to 50% of patients who present with sepsis nor is a positive culture required to make a decision regarding treatment with empiric antibiotics. Therefore, the desire to obtain cultures prior to initiating antimicrobial therapy should be balanced against the mortality risk of delaying a definitive therapy in patients with suspected sepsis or septic shock who are at significant risk of death [55].",

            "text": "\nBasal conceptTo optimize tissue perfusion within 6 h post-diagnosisTo acquire the balance between the oxygen consumption (VO2) and the oxygen delivery (DO2) within 6 h post-diagnosis, but there have been no methods to estimate VO2 during the acute phase of sepsis [27]. Therefore, the acute management of sepsis should be focused to increase DO2 [58]. The formula to calculate DO2 is as follows:DO2 \u2248 CO \u00d7 1.34 \u00d7 [Hb] \u00d7 SaO2\n\nTo increase DO2, cardiac output, hemoglobin concentration, and arterial oxygen saturation should be increased [59]. When adequate oxygen is provided, an increase in cardiac output can be a primary target for an increase in DO2.Cardiac output is calculated by stroke volume multiplied by heart rate. And the three components which contribute to make a stroke volume are preload, afterload, and myocardial contractility. Therefore, the basal concept of initial management to acquire optimal cardiac output is to maintain optimal preload, afterload, and contractility with an appropriate range of heart rate within 6 h post-diagnosis [23].\nFirst Preload OptimizationThe definition of preload for shock management is the end-diastolic volume of left ventricle. Preload is affected by venous pressure and venous return [60].To increase venous return, first of all, adequate hydration (30 mL/kg of crystalloid) should be provided within 3 h [27].To estimate volume status, many parameters are monitored. Because the direct measurement of left ventricular volume is impossible, most of the parameters monitor pressure. Commonly used parameters are static pressures which reflect left ventricle end-diastolic pressure. If the pulmonary circulation system would be intact, central venous pressure (CVP) is well correlated with pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (PCWP) and left ventricular end-diastolic pressure [61]. Because of the ease of accessibility and safety, CVP is the most commonly used parameter for static volume status in clinical setting [62]. However, many of the critically ill patients have structural or functional problems in pulmonary circulation system; CVP plays a limited role in the estimation of acute-phase volume status in patients with septic shock [63, 64]. And thus, alternative parameters including the diameter and/or collapsibility of inferior vena cava (IVC) are tested [65, 66].Initial hydration is the most important process to optimize preload and acquire appropriate tissue perfusion. But overhydration which induces fluid overload resulting in tissue edema and additional microcirculatory dysfunction should be avoided [67, 68]. Previous studies reported that fluid overload contributed to an increase in the mortality of patients with septic shock [69]. Therefore, the repeated measurements of dynamic fluid responsiveness should be combined with the measurement of static volume status.The parameters monitoring static volume status have another limitation. They cannot reflect dynamic fluid responsiveness during initial resuscitation [61]. Therefore, adjunctive methods to predict dynamic fluid responsiveness, such as pulse pressure variation (PPV > 13%), stroke volume variation (SVV > 12%), passive leg raising (PLR), and mini-fluid challenge (stroke volume index >6% after 100 mL of fluid challenge), have been developed and applied [70\u201376]. Among them, PPV and SVV should be measured in patients with full sedation and positive pressure ventilation and without dysrhythmia, and the use of them in emergency department is limited [71\u201374].The estimation of volume status and fluid responsiveness during fluid resuscitation is not easy in clinical setting. The combination of various monitoring parameters using all of the presently available devices may be helpful to estimate volume status more accurately and to optimize preload in patients with septic shock.\nSecond After OptimizationThe definition of afterload for shock management is the pressure in the wall of the left ventricle during ejection. If aortic valvular function is maintained a systemic vascular resistance contributes to afterload to maintain blood flow to peripheral tissues.To maintain systemic vascular resistance, the infusion of vasopressors is recommended.Vasopressor should be infused after the optimization of preload. Previous studies showed that when vasopressors were infused before optimal hydration, the risk of patients\u2019 mortality increased [77\u201379].To estimate afterload, mean arterial pressure (MAP) is commonly used. To measure more reliable MAP values, a routine intra-arterial catheterization in radial artery is recommended in patients with septic shock [27].\nThird consider myocardial contractility augmentation with an appropriate range of heart rateMyocardial contractility is the innate ability of the myocardium and an energy-consuming process. Furthermore, tachycardia also aggravates the energy-consuming process in myocardium. These energy-consuming processes need high oxygen supply to maintain the balance between VO2 and DO2.In the current guideline, the routine use of inotropic agents is not recommended. Recent large clinical studies have shown that the routine use of inotropic agents does not contribute to the survival improvement of septic shock patients [24, 25, 80].However, in patients who have acquired optimal preload and afterload but still have low cardiac output, the use of inotropic agents may be considered under the monitoring of stepwise changes in tissue perfusion with inotropic agents and heart rate [27].\nHemoglobinTo transport oxygen to peripheral tissues, adequate hemoglobin level should be maintained. There have been controversies about the optimal target hemoglobin level. When hemoglobin concentration is 15.0 g/dL, only a half of circulating hemoglobin participates in oxygen transport [81]. Furthermore, recent large clinical studies have shown that a transfusion threshold of the hemoglobin level of 7.0 g/dL was not different from 9.0 g/dL in the mortality of patients with septic shock [25, 82].Therefore, the current guideline recommends an erythrocyte transfusion threshold of 7.0 g/dL in patients with septic shock in the absence of myocardial infarction, severe hypoxemia, or acute hemorrhage [27, 83].\n\n",

Many previous studies reported that the use of colloid during initial resuscitation induces acute kidney injury and increases the mortality in patients with septic shock [33, 85].The current guideline recommends the use of crystalloid, both the 0.9% saline and the balanced crystalloids, such as Ringer\u2019s lactate solution and Plasma-Lyte. However, some studies showed that because of hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis, balanced crystalloids may be better than 0.9% saline for initial resuscitation (Table 5.2) [86, 87].To optimize preload, adequate fluid therapy should be provided. However, a sustained positive fluid balance after initial resuscitation has been reported to be harmful [88, 89]. Therefore, after preload optimization, fluid therapy should be cautiously performed with various monitoring devices to estimate the present volume status of patients.Although there have been no data supporting the amount of fluid volume after the 30 mL/kg of initial fluid resuscitation in patients with septic shock, the 30 mL/kg of initial fluid resuscitation, check volume status, additional fluid challenge (500 mL q 30 min) till CVP reaches \u22658 mmHg, recheck volume status with 100 mL of mini-fluid challenge, 150 mL of fluid infusion, and repeating the 100 mL of mini-fluid challenge and 150 mL of fluid infusion may be helpful to acquire optimal volume status.Recent clinical studies have shown the benefits of 5% albumin administration [32, 90]. Albumin administration can reduce fluid balance in septic shock patients who require substantial amounts of crystalloids. However, in patients with severe pneumonia or brain pathologies, the routine use of albumin should be avoided because the leakage of albumin can induce edema in lung or brain resulting in clinical deterioration [32].\n\n",

The commonly used vasoactive agents and their properties are described in Table 5.3 [91].The current guideline recommends to use norepinephrine as the first-choice vasopressor [27]. In previous studies, dopamine might induce tachyarrhythmia and deteriorated clinical outcomes in critically ill patients [92\u201394]. Therefore, dopamine can be considered for highly selected patients with low risk of tachyarrhythmia and absolute or relative bradycardia.If with the maximal dose of norepinephrine MAP failed to reach >65 mmHg, low doses of vasopressin or epinephrine can be added to norepinephrine [95, 96]. Vasopressin acts not to \u03b1-receptor but to V-receptor, and the deficiency of vasopressin may contribute to the vasodilation of septic shock [97]. The use of vasopressin can be helpful to decrease norepinephrine dosage.The use of dobutamine may be considered only in patients with persistent hypoperfusion despite adequate administrations of fluids and vasopressors [24, 25, 80].\n\n",

And thus, blood culture should be done within 45 min after presenting symptoms and signs of septic shock so as NOT TO delay antibiotics administration [27].Accelerating appropriate antimicrobial therapy may cause a delay in the start of antibiotic therapy [100]. The combination therapy of two or more of broad-spectrum antibiotics should be provided as an empiric antimicrobial therapy. Then, according to the identified pathogens and clinical improvement, the empiric antimicrobial therapy should be de-escalated.Imaging studies should be considered to find infection source, and if indicated invasive source control including radiologic interventions and/or surgery should be performed as soon as possible (within 12 h presenting symptoms and signs of septic shock).\n\n",

Usually, mouse has been used to see the effects of drugs or pathway of sepsis, and although many pathways are same in both rodents and humans there are different pathways or their significances between rodents and humans, which could make little translation into clinical outcome [106]. Also, the design of preclinical study should be mentioned. For example, lipopolysaccharide (LPS) model has little chance to be translated into human study [107]. No patients visit to the emergency department with LPS injection. With this background, recently the cecal ligation and puncture model has gained popularity. However, the diverse method used in this model could affect the translation, and efforts to standardize the method are under progress (Minimum Quality Threshold in Pre-clinical Sepsis Studies, MQTiPSS). Considering cecal ligation and puncture model, the animals usually get the fluid and antibiotics [107]. In real clinical situation, however, we perform source control and administer vasopressor, or ventilator care, if necessary as well as just one-shot antibiotics and fluid [108]. These affect clinical course dramatically. In these days, a few research centers run mouse or rat ICU, and this might help translation of preclinical research to clinical practice.",

Vasopressin in sepsis should be more investigated in two aspects. One is in less severe septic shock, and another is to use vasopressin as hormone, not just as vasopressor. Vasopressin showed bimodal secretion in many stressful situations, such as shock [125]. Vasopressin has many functions depending on the type of receptors. Sepsis is a stressful condition, and the role of vasopressin as stress hormone could have more effects than only as vasopressor. Regarding this, the strategy to use the continuous constant use of vasopressin as hormone and optimizing norepinephrine as vasopressor could be beneficial in sepsis.",
