Bovine rotavirus is a major cause of calf diarrhea, usually occurring in calves at 1\u20133 weeks of age [6], [7]. In addition to clinical rotavirus infections, subclinical infections are also common in calves [6], [7]. Coronavirus, Cryptosporidium and enterotoxigenic E. coli (ETEC) are together with rotavirus the four major enteropathogens associated with neonatal calf diarrhea worldwide. These organisms are responsible for the vast majority (75 to 95%) of enteric infections in neonatal calves worldwide [8]. Moreover, Salmonella spp. may be particularly important in dairy calves [9], [10], [11]. Most studies carried out in different countries have found rotavirus and Cryptosporidium to be the most commonly detected agents in calves with diarrhea. In some reports rotavirus was the most prevalent [10], [12], [13], [14], [15], [16], while in other studies Cryptosporidium was the agent most frequently detected [17], [18], [19], [20]. In microbiological surveys of diarrheic calves, the detection rate of mixed infections with two or more of the main enteropathogens ranged between 5% and 20% and in most of them rotavirus was involved [9], [10], [12], [13], [14], [18], [21].",

The diagnosis of diarrhea was made by veterinarians. Faecal samples were collected directly from the rectum in sterile plastic bottles and submitted on the day of sampling to the laboratory by express mail. Submitted samples were accompanied by a record sheet containing information on the size of herd, number of scouring calves and number of calves less than 30 days in the herd at sampling time and age of each sampled calf. Only fecal samples obtained within 48 h of onset of clinical signs from non-treated calves up to 30 d of age were included in this study. Samples were processed within 24 h of reception.",

For electrophoresis, 40 \u03bcl of the clear supernatant were mixed with 10 \u03bcl of the blue marker (25% sucrose containing 0.1% bromophenol blue) and loaded onto a discontinuous polyacrylamide gel (3% concentration for the stacking gel and 7.5% for the running gel). The gels were assembled using a mini-Protean II cell (BioRad) and run with a 50 mA running current and constant voltage for 1.5 h using a 200/2.0 model power supply (BioRad). After that, gels were fixed, developed and silver-stained. A positive rotavirus A control sample was included in each gel for comparison of the segmented viral RNA migration pattern.

            "text": "All the faecal samples positive to rotavirus were tested for the presence of coronavirus, Cryptosporidium and F5+\nE. coli by a commercial ELISA kit (Tetravalent). The ELISA test was performed according to the manufacturer's instructions. Moreover, Cryptosporidium infection was also diagnosed in fresh faecal smears. For oocysts detection smears were made from non-concentrated faecal samples on glass slides and oocysts were detected microscopically using extemporaneous fuchsin staining method [25]. A modified Ziehl-Neelsen's acid-fast method [26] was also used to confirm Heine-stain negative results. Faecal samples were also tested for the presence of F5+\nE. coli by bacterial culture as follows. The faeces samples were plated on MacConkey agar. After overnight incubation, 4 colonies with the typical appearance of E. coli from each sample were randomly chosen. E. coli strains were identified by biochemical tests. The strains were tested for F5 fimbriae by the slide agglutination method with live bacteria grown on Minca-Isovitalex solid media. The production of absorbed antiserum used to detect this fimbrial antigen has been described [27], [28]. Salmonella species were isolated by enrichment of faeces in selective broths. Approximately 1 g of faeces was added both to 9 ml of tetrathionate broth and to 7.5 ml of selenite broth. After 24 h of incubation at 37\u00b0C, samples were plated out on brilliant green agar and incubated for 24 h at 37\u00b0C. Lactose-negative colonies were tested on triple sugar iron, urea and o-nitrophenyl-\u03b2-d-galactopyranoside media. Those that had Salmonella-type reactions were tested for agglutination, using commercial polyvalent O antisera (Salmonella antiserum, Difco).",

A significant age-associated decrease in the detection rate of mixed infections (p<0.01) was found. That is in accordance with the age-dependent susceptibility of calves to the other enteropathogens considered except Salmonella. The pathogenic significance of concurrent infections in diarrheic calves, however, is not yet clear. Synergistic interaction has only been demonstrated experimentally between concomitant rotavirus and enterotoxigenic E. coli (ETEC) infections [32], [33], [34], [35]. This combination was detected in 10 calves in this survey and in 8 of these calves Cryptosporidium was also present (Table 1). Whether additive or synergistic interactions, that give rise to clinical effect or increase the severity of disease, occur in calves infected with rotavirus and any other agent except ETEC, or whether other agents extend the risk period for clinical presentation in calves infected with rotavirus remain to be proved experimentally. Thus, the concurrent infection rotavirus\u2013Cryptosporidium, the most common by far mixed infection in calves, has not yet been investigated experimentally. Nevertheless, in microbiological surveys of diarrheic and healthy neonatal calves, mixed infections were much more commonly detected in diarrheic than in healthy calves [10], [36]. Reynolds et al. [10] suggested that the presence of more than one enteropathogen may be one of the factors determining whether an infection results in a clinical or subclinical effect. Moreover, mixed infections have been associated with more severe disease [36].",
