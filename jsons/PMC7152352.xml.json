They believed that cleanliness would lead to good health and made links between causes of disease and methods of prevention. For example, during this time an association was made between the increased death rate of persons living near swamps and sewage, and as a result the Roman Empire began working on two major public health projects in sanitation control: the building of aqueducts to supply clean water to the city and a sewage system to eliminate waste from the streets. Today, the benefits of public health infrastructure in the United States and abroad continue to strengthen the well-being of society. The impact of interventions has been great. In the past century (1900\u20131999), the 10 greatest public health achievements have been documented as the following1:1.Vaccination programs, meaning the eradication of smallpox; elimination of poliomyelitis in the Americas; and control of measles, rubella, tetanus, diphtheria, and other diseases around the world2.Motor-vehicle safety3.Safer workplaces4.Control of infectious diseases5.Decline in deaths from coronary heart disease and stroke6.Safer and healthier foods7.Healthier mothers and babies8.Family planning9.Fluoridation of drinking water10.Recognition of tobacco use as a health hazard\n",

Public health programs and services emphasize the prevention of disease and administration of health needs to the population as an entity, versus the study and treatment of a single patient, as is found in the discipline of medicine. Today, public health is defined as \u201cthe science and the art of preventing disease, prolonging life, and promoting physical health and mental health and efficiency through organized community efforts \u2026 and the development of the social machinery to ensure to every individual in the community a standard of living adequate for the maintenance of health.\u201d2 The mission of public health is to fulfill society's desire to create conditions so that people can be healthy. Public health is divided into the staple pillars of assessment, policy development, and assurance.3 All three of these pillars are interdependent and cyclical. Two functions address the issues of assessment: (1) monitor health and (2) diagnose and investigate. Under policy development are the functions (1) inform, educate, empower; (2) mobilize community partnerships; and (3) develop policies. The following functions define assurance: (1) link to and/or provide care, (2) ensure a competent workforce, and (3) evaluate.3\n",

Public health seeks to mitigate hazards such as explosions, chemical exposures, natural disasters like floods and earthquakes, and infectious disease, as well as reducing vulnerabilities of the infrastructure such as weak assets, resources, personnel, and science. One form of mitigation may be hardening structures against blast, but also can be the placement of surveillance systems to increase early detection of infectious diseases in a hospital setting, for example. Today, these systems, as well as reporting parameters, are being put into place across the country to both recognize and protect populations from a bioterrorism event. Early warning offers the benefit of a rapid response and reduction in morbidity and mortality.",

Furthermore, recovery efforts comprise several components, some of which are Search and Rescue (SAR) in the case of an earthquake, bombing, or landslide; reinstitution of medical services if clinics and hospitals are destroyed; and establishment of corrupted lifelines like sanitation, electricity, and water. Those affected by the horrendous Tsunami disaster\u2014that killed hundreds of thousands in Indonesia, Thailand, India, and so many other nations\u2014demonstrated the international public health relief operation: an extreme example of multilateral, global relief spanning commercial and government sectors.

Within 90 minutes, both 110-story towers had collapsed. The New York State Department of Health (NYS DOH) had pre-established Emergency Operations Center committees that came together and began working within 30 minutes of the attack. NYS DOH nursing staff assisted in triaging and treating injured persons at an emergency triage center. In collaboration with the American Red Cross, the DOH also provided nursing staff for emergency shelters that housed displaced residents. Within the disaster site and surrounding community, DOH performed environmental monitoring. With losses in power and water as well as having tons of airborne contaminants in the area, DOH had its hands full with monitoring both the general public and emergency responders in addition to performing its daily activities. The DOH regularly sent faxes, e-mail alerts, and press releases containing urgent public health information and/or concerns to local hospitals and physicians. The DOH designed and implemented a rescue and recovery worker-safety plan. Additionally, the DOH initiated four disease and injury surveillance systems after the disaster, with assistance from the CDC.\n",

Locally, only the governor of a state or his or her appointee can declare a federal disaster through coordination with the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) regional director through the Federal Response Plan (FRP), under the Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act.7 The FRP under the Stafford Act is an interagency plan that outlines the delivery of federal resources to state and local governments when a disaster overwhelms the region's ability to respond self-sufficiently. When state or local resources are insufficient to respond to and recover from a disaster, the presidential declaration sets forth long-term federal disaster recovery programs.7 The Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistant Act's definition of a major disaster is stated in the following7:Any natural catastrophe (including any hurricane, tornado, storm, high water, wind-driven water, tidal wave, tsunami, earthquake, volcanic eruption, landslide, mudslide, snowstorm, or drought), or, regardless of cause, any fire, flood, or explosion in any part of the United States, which in the determination of the President causes damage of sufficient severity and magnitude to warrant major disaster assistance under this Act to supplement the efforts and available resources of states, local governments, and disaster relief organizations in alleviating the damage, loss, hardship, or suffering caused thereby.\n",

Physicians should be prepared to treat hundreds of trauma patients, which may be complicated by loss of utilities, difficulty in reaching hospitals, or possible damage to hospital facilities.23 The physically injured from high-energy disasters, such as earthquakes, tornadoes, or explosions, will most likely be treated at regional trauma centers for severe injuries. In the United States, there are 600 regional trauma centers.24 They coordinate EMS, including paramedics and air medical transport. A regional trauma center is composed of paramedics and emergency medical technicians (EMTs) who transport injured victims to trauma teams that include a trauma surgeon, emergency physician, several trauma nurses, and specialized personnel.

To characterize unusual levels of activity, the attack rate for the disease in question is compared against that of previous years to measure deviation from the norm. The outbreak can then be characterized in terms of time, place, and person, lending crucial data to determine the origin of the disease.39 By analyzing data of cases over time, an epidemic curve can be calculated that will allow for differentiation between an outbreak and normal pattern of disease.39 However, if an intentional release of a biological agent is suspected, time is of the essence, and as previously emphasized, early detection is key. Therefore, the development of surveillance systems, including syndromic surveillance systems and real-time computer models, are being developed. Surveillance \u201cconcentrates on the incidence, prevalence, and severity of illness or injury due to ecological changes, changes in endemic levels of disease, population displacement, loss of usual source of health care, overcrowding, breakdowns in sanitation, disruption of public utilities, monitors increases in communicable diseases, including vector-borne, waterborne, and person-to-person transmission\u201d and ultimately helps one to determine an association between exposure and outcome, whether that outcome includes specific injuries, illnesses, or death.20 In setting up a surveillance system, managers should consider using existing systems, such as those used to track reportable diseases, or developing temporary systems to track specific injuries and illnesses before, during, or after the disaster.20 Primary and secondary sources of data need to be identified and can vary from patient medical records (primary) to victim surveys and interviews (secondary). Primary data collection methods are direct observations or surveys, and secondary methods are interviews with key informants or review of existing records.20\n",

Next, case definitions need to be developed for uniformity of reporting outcomes. Finally, appropriate analytical methods should be used and can include descriptive measures, geographical analysis of spread, rates of disease or death, or an analysis over time measuring total numbers of cases and rates of appearance.20 It is also important to remember that in a disaster situation, rigorous epidemiological approaches may not be time-conducive and that there will be an immediate need to quickly collect key, important data that may be perishable as time goes on and populations change in exposure and impact to the hazard. As a result, disaster situations invoke the use of \u201cquick and dirty\u201d data collection, \u201cquick\u201d being simple and flexible and \u201cdirty\u201d being that some quantitative data are rough estimates gathered to answer immediate questions.18\n",

For the first two weeks, epidemic intelligence service officers (EISOs) staffed 15 hospitals for 24 hours and then provided 18-hour coverage at 12 hospitals for the remaining 30-day surveillance period. The teams entered data on-site and reported data to the New York City departments of Health and Mental Health each morning and followed up on significant cases. Between Sept. 13 and Oct. 12, 68,546 emergency department visits were recorded, with trauma as the highest syndrome-to-none-ratio (SNR) found (18.6%), followed by exacerbation of a chronic respiratory condition (7.6%). Diarrhea/gastroenteritis (4.4%) and upper and lower respiratory infections (4.2%) were also reported. Children younger than 15 years presented most often with respiratory syndrome complaints (67%) and rash syndromes (59%). Those between 25 and 64 years old made up 80% of inhalational visits and 75% of anxiety visits. Analyses were also specifically conducted for home postal codes within a two-mile radius of the World Trade Center and revealed that persons in the two-mile radius were no more likely to have a syndrome of bioterrorism interest than those who were outside of that proximity. However, the study found that people in close proximity to the towers on Sept. 11 were 61.5 times more likely to visit the emergency department for smoke/dust inhalation complaints than people from other areas. Overall, no health data to support a bioterrorist release were found.41\n\n",
