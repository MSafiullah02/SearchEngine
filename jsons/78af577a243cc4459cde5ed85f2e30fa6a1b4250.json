COVID-19 disease was first described in Wuhan, China in December 2019 and is now a global pandemic. As of the 12th of April 2020, there were 1,696,588 confirmed COVID-19 cases worldwide, 10-15% of which have severe disease and over 105,952 deaths reported [1] . Most of those affected have milder illness (80%), 15% are severely ill (require oxygen) and 5% will require admission to the intensive care unit (ICU). The Clinical Blood Sciences Laboratory (CBSL) plays a key role in supporting the monitoring and management of COVID-19 disease. Routine CBSL tests recommended to support medical decision-making and prognostication based on the current literature are detailed in Table 1 [2] . Recent evidence suggests that patients with severe COVID-19 are at risk for cytokine storm syndrome [3] and that where possible, Interleukin 6 (IL-6) should be u s e d t o a s s e s s t h e s e p a t i e n t s f o r s u s p e c t e d hyperinflammation [3, 4] . Furthermore, elevated concentrations of procalcitonin (a peptide precursor of the hormone calcitonin) in the circulation is associated with 5-fold higher risk of developing the severe form of the disease [5] .",

Ironically, hyperinduction of proinflammatory cytokine production (cytokine storm syndrome) can put a patient at risk for complications associated with COVID-19. Early recognition of this possibility is required to inform management and treatment decisions. This is important as potential treatments with existing approved therapies with proven safety profiles such as tocilizumab (an IL-6 receptor blocker) and Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitors have been mooted to address the rising mortality in patients with COVID-19 pneumonia and elevated IL-6 [3] . Identifying patients to direct these specific treatments is aided by measuring C-reactive protein (CRP), interleukin 6 (IL-6), ferritin and procalcitonin. IL-6 drives CRP and is an earlier marker of the status of a patients' inflammatory status. Elevated IL-6 concentrations together with the velocity of an increasing result portend an impending deterioration in clinical status.",

Human tissue studies have determined that ACE2 is expressed in some 15 organs, including the heart, kidneys and lung [11] . ACE2 is a key counterregulatory enzyme of the renin-angiotensinaldosterone system (RAAS) that degrades angiotensin II to angiotensin-(1-7) reducing its effects on vasoconstriction, sodium retention and blood pressure. SARS-CoV-2 has a predilection for type II epithelial cells of the alveoli, with the lower airways being the dominant site of injury in COVID-19 [12] . The spectrum of COVID-19 lung illness spans asymptomatic infection and mild upper respiratory tract illness to severe viral pneumonia with respiratory failure and even death [13] .

While increased concentrations of bilirubin, prothrombin (a vitamin K-dependent coagulation factor) and fibrinogen (a 340-kDa glycoprotein) synthesised in the liver are indicative of liver dysfunction. Prothrombin is proteolytically cleaved to form thrombin which converts fibrinogen to fibrin and then to a fibrin-based blood clot to occlude blood vessels and arrest bleeding. A D-dimer is a fibrin degradation product present in the blood after a blood clot is degraded by fibrinolysis. In acute sepsis, the coagulation system becomes diffusely activated with consumption of multiple clotting factors resulting in disseminated intravascular coagulopathy (DIC) [16] . Pathogenesis is driven by an upregulation of procoagulant mechanisms and simultaneous downregulation of natural anticoagulants. The prevention of DIC in COVID-19 patients is critical to prevent multiorgan failure and efforts should centre on stratifying patients at high risk for DIC. The prothrombin test (PT) (which measures the time it takes blood to clot (Normally: 11-12.5 s)), fibrinogen, D-dimers and the platelet count are significant predictors of disease severity as test abnormalities herald the onset of DIC. Klok et al. report a 31% incidence of thrombotic complications in ICU patients with COVID-19 and reinforce the recommendation for strict adherence to thrombosis prophylaxis [17] .",

The speculated mechanism is that severe systemic inflammation leads to atherosclerotic plaque instability and rupture. P < 0.001) when compared to those without cardiac injury [21] . Further, that in this cohort, higher concentrations of high-sensitivity cardiac troponin were associated with higher Other organ failure (SOFA) and ICU admission SpO 2 peripheral capillary oxygen saturation (estimate of the amount of oxygen in blood), PaO 2 partial pressure of oxygen in arterial blood, FIO 2 : fraction of inspired oxygen, MAP mean arterial pressure (60-65 mmHg), SOFA sequential organ failure assessment mortality [21] . Ruan et al. also reported that patients with CVD infected with SARS-CoV-2 had a significantly increased risk of death [4] . These authors determined that some of their patients with SARS-CoV-2 died of fulminant myocarditis. Direct viral infection of the vascular epithelium and myocardium has been promulgated based on the unique affinity of SARS-CoV-2 for the host ACE2 receptor [22] . Hence, raising the possibility of myocarditis occurring in some COVID-19 patients irrespective of existing or pre-existing CVD [20, 21, 23] . Patients with heart failure are prone to haemodynamic decompensation and an unfavourable course when infected with SARS-CoV-2 [24] . Recent insights have been provided by Guo et al. demonstrating that cardiac troponin levels are significantly associated with C-reactive protein (CRP) and Btype natriuretic peptide, linking myocardial injury to severity of inflammation during hospitalisation in patients who follow a deteriorating clinical course toward death [25] . Patients with myocardial injury also have evidence of elevated leukocyte counts, CRP, procalcitonin (PCT) and creatinine phosphokinase (CPK).",
