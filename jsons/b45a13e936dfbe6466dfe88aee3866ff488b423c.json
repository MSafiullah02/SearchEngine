The A frequency of respiratory infections is high in young children and appears to decline with advancing age.' However, the impact on the elderly host may be of greater consequence due to an aging respiratory tract, a declining immune system, and multiple medical problems.' Residents of long-term-care facilities represent a debilitated subgroup of the elderly population and thus are particularly prone to excess morbidity with respiratory infections. However, with the exception of influenza, comprehensive studies on viral respiratory infections in the institutionalized elderly are lacking. This is despite the fact that each year many residents of nursing homes become ill with respiratory infections not proven to be influenza, either by culture or serology.
