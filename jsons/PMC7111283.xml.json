Thus, how to prevent the extensive outbreaks of epidemics has become a challenging topic in the field of public health [4], [5], [6]. Meanwhile, the difference of population distribution, religious belief and regional differences may greatly affect the spread of infectious diseases, for example, Refs. [7], [8], [9], [10] explore the impact of various topological structures within the population on the infectious diseases spread, and it is convincingly found that heterogeneous networks may quicken the disease spreading within the population, even lead to the absence of epidemic threshold [11].",

One of the most striking cases regarding the outbreaks was H1N1 pandemic in 2009 [12], which induced around 15, 000 deaths. During the outbreaks of H1N1, the suppression of epidemic processes can not only be attributed to the public measures, but also through personal and uncoordinated responses, that is, the human behavior has noticeably interfered with the epidemic spreading. In the long run, human behavior has been intricately correlated with the contagion of infectious diseases. In medieval ages, the deadly bubonic plague rendered many people to avoid and flee away from the sick and their close contacts so that their own immunity can be secured [13]. Similarly, the villagers of Yorkshire in Eyam tried to voluntarily quarantine themselves to stop the spread of the plague from that village [14]. In 2003, during the outbreak of SARS, many citizens spontaneously wear the face masks, some schools are temporarily closed and the students are imperatively required to stay at home so as to avoid the further epidemic infection as much as possible [15]. In addition, protective behavior when confronting the epidemics has also been observed in many other contexts, such as Measles-Mumps-Rubella(MMR) [16], tuberculosis(TB) [17] and HIV [18] etc.",

At present, mathematical models have been put forward to study the role of human behavior in the context of social population, such as escape panic [19], pedestrian trails [20], but efforts to quantitatively explore the role of human behavior in the large-scale epidemics generally focus on assessing the effectiveness of various public health measures including the social distancing, school closure etc. In the recent years, there are many fields and methods to help us to study infectious disease [21], [22], [23], [24], [25], [26], [27], [28], [29], [30], [31], [32], however, there is an increasing attention about the effect of spontaneous individual action or response strategy on the progression of an infectious disease, in which this kind of spontaneous actions may highly restrain from the further diffusion of epidemics and even change the fate of outbreaks. Thus, it is of great significance to fully understand the interacting mechanisms between the human behavior and disease dynamics within the specified population. It is worth mentioning that Funk et al. [33] systematically summarized the related works and provided a taxonomy framework of behavior-disease models. On the one hand, they classify these models according to source and type of information that individuals base their neighbors on, in which source of information may be local or global and the type of information that individuals change their behaviors are prevalence-based or belief-based; On the other hand, they classify the previous works based on the impact of individual behavior changes on the disease dynamics, which include the following three aspects: (i) the disease state; (ii) model parameters (infection or recovering rate); and (iii) the network contact structure relevant for the spread of epidemics.",

Meanwhile, these vaccinators may indirectly protect their nearest neighbors with whom they contact, and then these neighbors may choose not to vaccinate again (that is, free-ride the vaccinators) so as to avoid the necessary vaccine fees or other potential risk and side effects. Henceforth, the vaccination behavior may dominate the evolutionary process of vaccine preventable diseases. Among them, Bauch and Earn [34] seminally utilized the game theory to model the dilemmatic situation for an individual facing with the epidemics, and they proposed a class of vaccination game to denote the individual decision making and found that, for the well-mixed population, the Nash equilibrium is never to vaccinate if the vaccination cost is higher than that of being infected; but there exists a Nash equilibrium yielding a suboptimal vaccinated fraction if the vaccine cost is lower than that of being infected.",

            "text": "As a further step, complex networks, beyond the well-mixed topology, provide a unified platform to characterize the topology of real-world populations, where the nodes represent individuals and links mimic the contacts among them [35]. Thus, under framework of game theory, many works are devoted to exploring the interplay between contact patterns, behavioral responses and disease dynamics. As an example, Fu et al. [36] found that heterogeneous networks, such as scale-free ones, can induce a broad range of vaccinating actions of many individuals since high-degree hubs with many neighbors become voluntary vaccinators more probably in order to reduce the risk of being infected. After that, Zhang et al. [37] demonstrated that the hubs may largely inhibit the outbreaks of infectious diseases under the voluntary vaccination policy. In the meantime, various subsidy policies on controlling the epidemic spreading have been determined from the socioeconomic perspectives within the well-mixed and networked population [38], [39], [40], [41], [42], [43]. Furthermore, most previous works [44], [45], [46], [47], [48], [49], [50], [51], [52] often assume that the vaccine has a perfect efficacy, which will endow the complete immunity for the inoculated individuals, but an interesting topic is on how the epidemic spreads when the vaccine is not fully effective for the disease (i.e., 100% efficacy)? Besides, in the vaccination game, whether an individual decides to vaccinate the vaccine or not will be often determined by the estimated payoff, and the vaccinating decision may be transferred from one player to another one inside the population according to a specific role model during the outbreaks. Nevertheless, under some real-world scenarios, some individuals are not willing to imitate the behaviors of others as a result of special belief, religion, opinion and even awareness of a disease.",

Generally, inoculating the vaccine is considered as an effective measure, but the vaccine may fail as result of invalid storage, transportation and usage, and then rendered that the vaccinated individuals may confront the risk of being infected. Henceforth, some individuals make a decision to vaccinate just judge by themselves and don\u2019t consider their neighbors. Thus, in order to deeply analyze the role of vaccine efficacy and spontaneous individual decision mechanism in the outbreak of vaccine preventable diseases, we propose a vaccination game model to explore the impact of imperfect vaccine efficacy and myopic update rule in the spatially structure and heterogeneous populations. The rest of this paper is structured as follows. Firstly, we depict the new vaccination game model in Section 2 in detail. Then, Section 3 provides extensive numerical simulation results, which are obtained in the regular lattice and heterogeneous scale-free networks, respectively. Lastly, in Section 4, we end this paper with some conclusions and point out the potential works in the future.",

Thus, in the current model, all individuals have no chances to vaccinate at the initial time step (t=0). After that, each time step (t \u2265 1) is divided into two elementary sub-steps: one step is for the decision of inoculating the vaccine; the other one is used to model the process of epidemic spreading. Among them, for the epidemic sub-steps including t=0, we leverage the frequently used susceptible-infective-recovery (SIR) compartment model to characterize the evolution of epidemics, where each individual may lie in the susceptible (S), infective (I) or recovery (R) state. During the vaccination decision sub-steps, each susceptible individual needs to assess the risk of being infected, and then make the decision whether he will vaccinate or not.",

Hence, the probability that the susceptible player i without inoculating the vaccine will be infected by all possible infective neighbors can be written as follows,(1)\u03bbi=1\u2212(1\u2212\u03b2)kinfi,where kinfi denotes the total number of infected neighbors of the focal player i.

Without loss of generality, we fix the infection cost CI=1, while the vaccine cost is usually lower than CI and then its relative cost can be re-scaled as 0<c=CV/CI<1. In order to quantitatively perform the decision, by borrowing from the terms in game theory, we assume that the decision process is based on the comparison between the perceived payoffs of vaccination \u03a0Vi and the perceived payoffs of being infected \u03a0NVi if he is not vaccinated, which can be expressed as follows, respectively,(2)\u03a0Vi=\u2212CV=\u2212c,\n(3)\u03a0NVi=\u2212\u03bbiCI=\u2212\u03bbi,where \u03bbi denotes the potential infection probability that can be calculated according to Eq. (1). Then, the susceptible agent i will independently decide to inoculate the vaccine with the following Fermi-like probability,(4)pVac=11+e\u2212(\u03a0Vi\u2212\u03a0NVi)K,where K represents the impact of the noise or its reverse 1/K means the strength of strategy selection, which reflects the uncertainty of vaccination strategy adoption. Here, we term this vaccination decision as the myopic update rule just based on one player\u2019s own perception, which is different from imitating the vaccination strategy of others in many previous works [37], [38], [43], [44], [45], [46], [47]. When K \u2192 0, agent i is totally rational and whether he will vaccinate or not is fully determined by comparing \u03a0Vi and \u03a0NVi, that is, agent i will vaccinate if \u03a0Vi\u2265\u03a0NVi and not vaccinate if \u03a0Vi<\u03a0NVi; On the contrary, when K \u2192 \u221e, agent i will randomly perform the vaccination choice.",

At t=0 step, the system starts the evolution according to the SIR model. After that, from t=1, each susceptible agent has the opportunity to receive the vaccination and then the system carries out the evolution of epidemics based on the above-mentioned two elementary steps. The system continuously evolves until there are no infective individuals. In addition, the current results are averaged over 1000 independent runs so that the large fluctuations can be removed. In all the numerical simulations, the population size is fixed to be N=10000. In the homogenous topology, we use the regular lattice satisfying the periodic boundary with the size L=100 as the underlying networks, and each individual has 4 nearest neighbors (that is, the von-Neumann neighborhood).

Fig. 2\nplots the fraction of vaccinated (upper panel) and recovered (bottom panel) in as a function of relative cost c for three different vaccine failure rates \u03b8. In each panel, we consider the impact of three different vaccine failure rates \u03b8=0.04(red square),0.05(blue circle), 0.06 (yellow triangle), respectively. On the one hand, for a specific vaccine failure rate \u03b8, \u03c1V declines with the increase of the relative vaccination cost c, while \u03c1R increases as c augments, which means that the vaccination cost will markedly affect the willingness of individuals to inoculate the vaccine. As an example, when c \u2264 0.5, \u03c1V and \u03c1R can almost keep the similar vaccination level as c increases; However, c > 0.5 leads to the substantial reduction of \u03c1V and the continuous rising of \u03c1R since the vaccination cost is comparable to the infection cost; In particular, \u03c1V will be dramatically reduced when c is up to 0.95, even tends to zero as the vaccination cost is too high, especially for c=0.95. On the other hand, under the same vaccination cost c, \u03c1V decreases as the vaccine failure rate becomes higher, for instance, the fraction of adopting the vaccination strategy under c=0.06 is much less than that with c=0.05, which implies that the vaccinated fraction within the whole population will be a little more sensitive to the vaccine failure rate.",

Likewise, it can be clearly shown that \u03c1V declines and \u03c1R increases slowly when the relative cost of vaccination c lies between 0 and 0.4. Afterwards, when the relative cost of vaccination c is more than 0.5, the greater the noise selection strength, the more rapidly the varying trend of \u03c1V and \u03c1R. In fact, as the strength of selection increases, individuals become much more rational and will not tend to take the vaccination strategy since they will take their own economic cost and the related interests, say, free-riding behavior, into account. In particular, the relative cost c is beyond 0.5, or the vaccine loss rate is higher (i.e., \u03b8=0.06), the un-vaccination behavior of rational individuals become much more prominent, and thus it is unable to prevent the outbreaks of epidemics, which can be observed from the larger \u03c1R as c > 0.5 or \u03b8=0.06.",

It is clearly indicated that at the lower vaccine failure rates (say, \u03b8 < 0.04), the fraction of vaccinated individuals is often more than half of the total population, even if relative cost of vaccination c is large (e.g., 0.9); Meanwhile, a plethora of vaccinated individuals further prevent the outbreak of epidemics so that the percentage of recovered individuals is very low within the population. On the contrary, at the high vaccine failure rates (\u03b8 > 0.06), \u03c1V is very slow and it indicates that there are few healthy individuals to choose the vaccination strategy after performing the infection risk assessment, which further leads to the potential outbreak of epidemics. In particular, when the vaccine failure rate is beyond 0.09 (i.e., \u03b8 \u2265 0.09), the whole population is almost recovered regardless of the value of c, which means the real outbreak of epidemics. The current results strongly demonstrate that the vaccine failure \u03b8 dramatically affect the evolution of vaccination behavior in our model, the equilibrium fraction vaccinated and recovered individuals is almost dominated by the vaccine failure rate, while the impact of the vaccine cost c can play an important role just under the intermediate value of vaccine failure rate (say, \u03b8=0.04\u22120.06).

Among them, the upper eight panels denote the snapshots under \u03b8=0.03 and c=0.3, while the lower eight panels represent the ones for \u03b8=0.08 and c=0.8. At time step t=0, there are no vaccinated individuals on the lattice and only I0=10 randomly infected seeds, and then the epidemic starts to propagate at this time. After that (t \u2265 1), the susceptible individuals have the opportunity to determine whether they will inoculate the vaccine or not. It is clearly observed that most individuals choose to vaccinate under these two cases when epidemic begins to spread. However, when \u03b8=0.03 is lower, there is fewer vaccinated individuals to become susceptible, and then most of vaccinated individuals are immunized, in which the epidemic is hard to spread and finally tends to be extinct. Reversely, for the higher vaccine failure rate (i.e., \u03b8=0.08), the vaccine is easy to be invalid, many vaccinated individuals become susceptible due to the loss of vaccine efficacy. Therefore, the epidemic can be pandemic and then most of individuals enter the recovered state in the end. All these results again demonstrate that the vaccine efficacy plays the significant role in the evolution of vaccination behavior of epidemic outbreaks within the structured population.",

In all panels, the red, blue and yellow lines denote the evolution of susceptible, recovered and vaccinated individuals, respectively. It can be found that the vaccinated individuals increase rapidly in a very short time, and then reach a peak. Vaccinated individuals are rarely become susceptible because of the vaccine failure \u03b8 is lower (as shown in Fig. 6a,c) so that the number of recovered ones increases a little and arrives at the equilibrium quickly, which states clearly that the epidemic is eliminated and has not become pandemic. Due to the vaccine failure rate, the fraction of vaccinated individuals goes down and then tends to be zero after reaching the peak. However, when the value of vaccine failure rate \u03b8 is raised (as shown in Fig. 6b,d), even though the vaccinated individuals increase rapidly, they become susceptible quickly due to the high vaccine failure rate \u03b8, it can\u2019t prevent the epidemic spread so that the number of recovered individuals increases. Additionally, we found that for the value of vaccine failure rate \u03b8=0.03, whatever the values of relative cost of vaccination c, the number of recovered agents is the same as that at the equilibrium. Generally, when the epidemic starts to spread, many susceptibles take the vaccine in the population at a short due to the perception of infection risk. Also, this vaccination behavior is almost widespread regardless of the values of relative cost of vaccination c and vaccine failure rate \u03b8. At the lower vaccine failure rate, vaccinated individuals are hard to become susceptible, which leads to the disease propagates difficultly and be eliminated as soon as possible. These results are also consistent with the work of Zhang et al. [37], since the hub nodes are often vaccinated immediately after the disease starts to spread. But for the higher vaccine failure rate, the vaccinated individuals become susceptible quickly, the disease can outbreak.",

We present different strategies: one is random vaccination (RAND), and the other one is the hub vaccination (HUB). Here, only several highest degree nodes have a chance to vaccinate in the HUB scheme; However, we randomly select unvaccinated susceptible ones to inoculate the vaccine at each time step in the RAND one. Fig. 7\n(HUB) and Fig. 8\n(RAND) plot the fraction of vaccinated (upper panel) and recovered (bottom panel) ones as a function of relative cost c for three different vaccine failure rates \u03b8, respectively. According to Fig. 6, we can find that the vaccinated individuals increase rapidly in a short time when the epidemic starts to spread, which leads to the elimination of epidemics quickly. In Figs. 7 and 8, from left to right, the vaccinated proportion is set to be 0.1, 0.2, 0.3 at each time step, receptively. As the vaccinated proportion enhances, \u03c1V increases while \u03c1R declines whatever the way of vaccination is. It is natural that when the vaccinated proportion grows, there are more unvaccinated susceptible individuals, who can choose to vaccinate and obtain the immunity so that the epidemic can not spread. We can find that under the HUB scheme, when the vaccinating proportion increases, the value of vaccine failure \u03b8=0.008 and the values of relative cost of vaccination c < 0.6, the fraction of vaccinated individuals increases. As the value of vaccine failure is raised, the vaccinated individuals become susceptible more easily and the epidemic can outbreak, the risk of infection of unvaccinated susceptible ones also grows, which renders that the payoffs of being infected \u03a0NVi are increased. Thus, even the value of relative cost of vaccination c rises, unvaccinated susceptible individuals are more likely to choose the vaccination strategy, which is different from results on regular lattices. When the value of relative cost of vaccination c > 0.6, due to the higher cost, unvaccinated susceptible individuals are unwilling to choose the vaccination, and then the number of vaccinated individuals declines. The \u03c1R under the RAND is enhanced with the increase of the relative vaccination cost c, but is different from those under the HUB, which is related to the variation of \u03c1V. As the relative cost of vaccination c and vaccine failure rates \u03b8 increases, the \u03c1V declines rapidly under the RAND at each propagating time step. Meanwhile, the vaccine failure rate \u03b8 has little effect on the \u03c1R regardless of the vaccination scheme.",

Extensive numerical simulations show that most unvaccinated susceptible individuals are willing to inoculate the vaccine under the myopic update rule, whatever the type of network is, in particular for the lower vaccine cost (c \u2264 0.5) and failure rate (\u03b8 \u2264 0.06). After the epidemic starts to propagate, and most of individuals change their strategies to adopt the vaccine in a short time since the individual can estimate the infection risk at the early stage, which leads the epidemics to be hard to spread within the population. However, due to the failure of vaccine or the free-riding behavior of susceptible individuals, vaccinated individuals become susceptible again and then confront the risk of being infected, which creates the potential epidemics situation.",

For example, the value of vaccine failure rate \u03b8 is usually assumed to be no more than 10%, or else most vaccinated individuals become re-susceptible again. At a fixed \u03b8, the fraction of vaccinated individuals almost keep unchanged when the relative vaccine cost is not beyond c=0.5, but this value will become lower and lower after c is more than 0.5, which is basically consistent with the reality of vaccine usage. On the contrary, on the scale-free networks, the number of vaccinated individuals is more sensitive to the effect on vaccine failure rate \u03b8. Hub nodes have a stronger inclination to adopt the vaccine under the myopic update rule, which can effectively prevent the diffusion of epidemics. Hence, the disease will be eliminated quickly in heterogeneous topology. However, when the values of vaccine failure rate increase a little bit, hub nodes become susceptible and cannot prevent the epidemic spread, which leads to the epidemic outbreak. Meanwhile, when the relative cost of vaccination c increases, unvaccinated susceptible individuals are not willing to choose the vaccination strategy, which can not stop the outbreak of infectious diseases. When the vaccine failure rate further increases, such as 0.03, the number of vaccinated individuals decays to zero before the epidemic is eliminated, which is almost equivalent with the classic SIR model. Anyway, current results are conducive to better understanding the individual vaccination behaviors when confronting the real epidemics.",
