            "text": "A lockdown is a social distancing intervention that aims to minimise physical contact between individuals and groups in order to reduce transmission of a communicable disease [1] . Social distancing measures are typically introduced in an attempt to reduce and/or delay the peak of an epidemic/pandemic, to minimise the potential for surges in health care utilisation and to protect vulnerable groups. In the context of COVID-19, the World Health Organization has encouraged use of the term 'physical distancing' instead of social distancing to highlight that the aim of this intervention is only to reduce physical contact, not social contact which is often still possible through telephone and video calls, and social media [2] . There are a range of physical distancing measures, which can be broadly categorised as operating at the individual (eg, to support self-isolation of confirmed or suspected cases) or population levels (eg, closing of schools or workplaces) [1] .",

            "text": "The lack of any effective pharmaceutical interventions for COVID-19 or vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 and the resulting failure to contain the virus has led to widespread adoption of physical distancing measures [3] . For example, according to the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO), 188 (96%) countries have by April 2020 implemented nationwide closure of schools [4] . Estimating compliance of policies encouraging physical distancing is crucial to assess their effectiveness and for accurate modelling of the future course of the pandemic. This viewpoint highlights three novel approaches that are now being deployed in some countries to assess compliance with physical distancing measures in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. It is our hope that, by drawing attention to these measures, other parts of the world may also consider, where feasible and appropriate, deploying similar approaches.",

            "text": "CONCLUSION COVID-19 has resulted in the introduction of lockdowns on an unprecedented scale in an attempt to modify the course of the pandemic and mitigate its effects. Measuring compliance with physical distancing is crucial to inform modelling deliberations and enable evidence-based policy making. We have summarised three key approaches that are currently being used to help estimate compliance with lockdowns in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. Although currently used in a small minority of countries, there is substantial opportunity to scale up use of these approaches globally.Funding: AzS is supported by Health Data Research UK.Authorship contributions: AsS and ZS jointly drafted the manuscript. AzS conceived this paper and commented critically on several drafts of the manuscript. All authors approved the final test of the manuscript.",
