The SARS\u2010CoV, which is a novel coronavirus, was identified as the causative agent of SARS. It is an enveloped, positive\u2010stranded RNA virus with a genome of approximately 30 kb, encompassing five major open reading frames (ORFs) which encode the replicase polyproteins, the spike (S), envelope (E), membrane (M), and nucleocapsid (N) proteins. Besides these major proteins, SARS\u2010CoV genome also encodes five to eight putative accessory proteins that share little homology with any known proteins of other coronaviruses [2, 3].",

For instance, group\u2010specific ORFs of murine coronavirus were found to be non\u2010essential for viral replication, yet their deletions were attenuating in natural hosts [5]. Recent research on the SARS\u2010CoV have also indicated that accessory proteins SARS 3a, 3b and 7a could induce apoptosis [6, 7, 8]. On the other hand, coronavirus infection in the early stages had been reported to stimulate epithelial cells, causing cellular proliferation and squamous metaplasia in the lungs [9]. Interestingly, SARS 6 has been shown to increase DNA synthesis in mammalian cells of epithelium origins [10].",

Evolutionary studies of zoonotic and human SARS\u2010CoV have indicated that in the early phase of the SARS epidemic, ORF8 was encoded as a single ORF while isolates of human SARS\u2010CoV at a later stage of the epidemic contained a 29\u2010nucleotide deletion which resulted in two ORFs designated as ORF8a and ORF8b [11]. This deletion might be associated with transmission of the virus during the epidemic [12]. In this study, the cellular localization and functional roles of SARS 8b were examined.",

The expression of the EGFP and SARS 8b\u2010EGFP proteins in both cell types were detected by Western blotting using anti\u2010GFP primary antibodies (Fig. 1\n). The expected bands of EGFP (\u223c27 kDa) and SARS8b\u2010EGFP (\u223c36.6 kDa) were observed, indicating the proteins were expressed in the cells. Interestingly, a smaller band with size of about 30 kDa was observed in both transfected Vero E6 and CHO cells (Fig. 1, lanes 2 and 5). This band was speculated to be a truncated form of the SARS 8b\u2010EGFP protein due to proteolytic cleavages, which are common processing steps of viral proteins. For instance, Ito et al. reported that the 3a protein of SARS\u2010CoV might undergo specific proteolytic processing [14]. Studies have also shown that the multiple cleavages of the precore protein of the hepatitis B virus resulted in different sizes of smaller proteins which could be translocated from the cytosol to other compartments of the cell [15]. SARS 8b may possibly employ similar mechanism as the 3a or the precore protein and the smaller band might be a processed form of the protein. However, further investigation is required to verify this hypothesis.",

Although the ability of SARS 8b in cell proliferation may seem counterintuitive to the apoptotic characteristics of SARS 3a, 3b and 7a [6, 7, 8], past examples have shown that accessory proteins produced by a virus can be multifunctional and sometimes elicit counteracting effects. For instance, p12I, one of the accessory proteins of the human T\u2010cell lymphotropic virus type 1 (HTLV\u20101) which localizes at the ER and cis\u2010Golgi compartments, is able to promote T\u2010lymphocytes proliferation and enhances the effectiveness of viral transmission during the early stage of infection [20, 21, 22]. Interestingly, HTLV\u20101 p13II, which is another accessory protein of HTLV\u20101 that localizes in the inner membranes of mitochondria, displays apoptotic effect on both animal model and human Jurkat T\u2010cells [23, 24]. Therefore, it is possible that SARS 8b work in a similar fashion as the HTLV\u20101 p12I, causing cell proliferation that helps in viral transmission in the early stage of the infection. In fact, the cell proliferative effect of SARS 8b in epithelial cell lines used in this study is consistent to the pathology of epithelial proliferation observed in SARS patients [9].",

            "text": "Although viral accessory proteins are often not involved in viral replication, their roles in viral pathogenesis should not be overlooked. For example, the HIV accessory protein Vpr is essential for inducing cell cycle arrest and apoptosis [25]. Studies have also shown that SARS 3a, 3b and 7a could cause apoptosis in mammalian cells [6, 7, 8]. In this study, we examined the effects of SARS 8b on DNA synthesis in the context of mammalian cell lines as a prelude. The possibility that in the context of the complete SARS\u2010CoV genome, the function of the SARS 8b may not be related to an increase in DNA synthesis cannot not be excluded. For instance, a combination of SARS\u2010CoV 8b and some other accessory proteins may function to shut off host macromolecular synthesis. Further analyses will be required to verify the significance of the cell proliferative function of SARS 8b in the context of SARS\u2010CoV infection and the whole viral genome. Nevertheless, consistent with the previous report of the presence of SARS 6 and SARS 8b mRNA associated with SARS\u2010CoV infection [26], the results in this study further substantiate the compatible co\u2010expression of the two viral proteins in the cells. The distribution of SARS 8b throughout the cell suggests its potential to interact with multiple cellular partners as well as the products of the SARS\u2010CoV genome located both in the cytoplasm and nucleus which may in turn modify cellular function, i.e. DNA synthesis.",
