Despite this heavy burden of disease, no concise studies have been published on the global research landscape so far. Methods We used the New Quality and Quantity Indices in Science platform to analyze global NSI research (n = 2987 articles) over the past 115 years using the Web of Science and parameters such as global versus country-specific research activities, semi-qualitative issues, and socioeconomic figures. Results Density-equalizing mapping showed that although a total of n = 106 countries participated in NSI research, large parts of Africa and South America were almost invisible regarding global participation in NSI research. Average citation rate (cr) analysis indicated a high rate for Switzerland (cr = 25.1), Italy (cr = 23.5), and Japan (cr = 19.2). Socioeconomic analysis revealed that the UK had the highest quotient Q GDP of 0.13 NSI-specific publications per bill. US-$ gross domestic product (GDP), followed by South Africa (Q GDP = 0.12). Temporal analysis of HIV versus hepatitis research indicated that NSI-HIV research culminated in the early 1990s, whereas NSI-hepatitis research increased over the observed period from the 1980s until the last decade. Conclusion Albeit NSI research activity is generally increasing, the growth is asymmetrical from a global viewpoint. International strategies should be followed that put a focus on NSI in non-industrialized areas of the world.",

            "text": "NSIs are omnipresent around the globe and endanger the health and life of hundreds of thousands of health-care workers. As stated before, they generate a large amount of indirect, direct, potential, and intangible costs, which Why? Probably, because NSIs are not just a single entity such as a disease or a pathogen, but an accident, resulting from a series of failures, which can be analyzed from different perspectives: determinants, characteristics, distribution, consequences, prevention of accidents, and prevention of consequences. Therefore, the present results need to be interpreted with caution. Our approach aimed to visualize global research activities in the field of NSI and related areas of science. To approach this aim, metadata were used from the Web of Science between 1900 and 2014 and 2,987 publications were identified which were specifically related to NSI. Interestingly, almost all NSI-related articles (99.2%) were published between the years 1975 and 2014, indicating only a very minimal activity in the decades before. The reason for this increase after 1975 is based upon two findings: observations that (a) hepatitis B (first articles appearing in 1975-80), and then (b) HIV (first documented case in literature in 1984) could be acquired through a needlestick. One might argue that due to the minimal activities more than three decades ago, the analysis should have been limited to, i.e., the past decades. However, including a time span The USA plays a dominant role in country-specific analyses with the highest number of articles published, the largest number of institutions of higher education as well as the highest modified h-Index. Furthermore, the USA possesses the most national and international collaborations among all nations. How can these data be interpreted? First of all, it is important to discuss these results with regard to the overall global research performance and general trends. To achieve this, the presently observed increase in NSI research activities needs to be related to the increase in global research activities, in specific, biomedical research activities. It is wrong to take the growth of databases such as the presently used Web of Science as a precise tool for increase in research activities (since no existing database captures everything) (Noorden 2014). However, it may serve as a proxy (Bornmann and Mutz 2014) . By analyzing more than 755 million cited references in 38 million publications from 1980 to 2012, Bornmann and Mutz estimated the growth of research for 2012 between 8 to 9% (Bornmann and Mutz 2014) . Although only restricted to WoS data, our analysis shows for NSI a growth rate which is not constantly increasing, but varying between years, especially in the 1990s to the 2000s. This is an uncommon picture, because usually the growth is more or less linear, as previously demonstrated (Noorden 2014; Bornmann and Mutz 2014) .",

Is this a common picture-yes, there is a multitude of other bibliometric studies that demonstrated a unique leading role of the USA in almost every area of science. But how is the pattern of leading countries apart from the USA? Does this ranking follow any previously known pattern? Our ranking with the UK at position 2, followed by Canada (n = 138), Australia (n = 132), Germany (n = 131) and France (n = 113) shows a global architecture that is similar to those of many other fields of biomedicine. But is this pattern specific for research conducted in the area of viral diseases?",

Other countries, such as Japan, with a significant prevalence of HCV in the general population, observed cases of hepatitis C linked to NSIs after the identification of a specific antibody test to detect seroconversion in the early 1990s, and this is why papers appear in gastroenterology and hepatology journals. This is visualized by our NSI research area analysis in which Japan is very prominent in the field of gastroenterology and hepatology.
