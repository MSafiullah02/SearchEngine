            "text": "More than a hundred years back, Einstein proposed his theory of general relativity (GR) which revolutionized our idea of gravity. It provided us a theory that could act as a powerful tool in our quest to know the universe. With the passage of time and with extensive research glitches in the theory started showing up. The major blow came at the turn of the last century when the discovery of the accelerated expansion of the universe [1], [2] left GR inconsistent at cosmological distances. Since then we have resorted to the alternative techniques of modified gravity and dark energy to incorporate this accelerated expansion in our theory of gravity. While the former deals with the geometry of spacetime, the latter is concerned with the matter content of the universe. Extensive reviews in modified gravity can be found in the Refs. [3], [4], [5].",

Choosing a suitable function for f(R), one can explore the non-linear effects of the scalar curvature on the evolution of the universe. Extensive reviews in f(R) gravity can be found in the Refs. [6], [7]. Viability of f(R) dark energy models have been studied in ref. [8], where the f(R) models with a power law of R has been ruled out. Author of Ref. [9] studied the interplay between f(R) theories and scalar-tensor theories via the Palatini formalism. Formation of large scale structure in f(R) gravity was studied in Ref. [10]. A reconstruction scheme for f(R) theories was explored in Ref. [11]. Various other studies related to f(R) gravity can be found in Refs. [12], [13], [14], [15].",

Such a theory is termed as the Theory of Everything (TOE). It is understood that this would eventually boil down to a theory of quantum gravity where GR will be reconciled to the theory of quantum mechanics (QM). Till now there have been a few proposals for such a theory namely, Loop quantum theory [16], [17], String theory [18], [19], Horava-Lifshitz (HL) gravity [20], [21], etc. The UV completion of GR in the limit that GR is recovered in IR limit has eventually led to the development of the Horava-Lifshitz gravity. An alternative mechanism of UV completion of GR was proposed by Magueijo and Smolin in the Ref. [22] where the geometry of spacetime depends on the energy of the test particle. This theory is termed as Gravity's Rainbow. Although the conceptual basis of HL gravity and gravity's rainbow are quite different yet they aim to pursue similar ideas. Both the theories resorts to the modification of the usual energy-momentum dispersion relations of the special theory of relativity in the UV limit, such that in the IR limit the usual relations are retrieved. Following this, the authors in Ref. [23] tried to bridge the two theories from the conceptual background.",

            "text": "We know that in GR the usual energy-momentum relations are governed by the Lorentz symmetry and so any modifications to these in the UV limit will directly imply the violation of the symmetry. In fact different quantum gravity approaches have shown that at high energy scales (UV limit) Lorentz symmetry breaks down [24], [25], [26], [27]. This breakdown is expected to occur in models like string field theory [28], discrete spacetime [29], spacetime foam [30], non-commutative geometry [31], spin network in Loop quantum gravity [32], etc. Magueijo and Smolin in the Ref. [33] proposed the theory of Doubly Special Relativity (DSR), where Einstein's Special Theory of Relativity (STR) is generalized for spacetimes with high energy, i.e. energies compared to Planck energy (EP=1019GeV). In this theory Planck energy joins the speed of light as an invariant quantity. Nevertheless this formulation was achieved at the cost of the violation of the Lorentz symmetry. The modifications to the field theory also suggested corresponding modification to the equivalence principle which determines how DSR can be embedded in GR. Introducing non-zero curvature in DSR, we get what can be called the Doubly General Relativity (DGR) or Gravity's Rainbow. In this theory the modifications to the usual energy-momentum dispersion relations (E2\u2212p2=m2) as discussed above is introduced via energy dependent rainbow functions F(E) and G(E) as given below,(1)E2F2(E)\u2212p2G2(E)=m2 Here E=Es/EP, where Es is the maximum energy that a probe in the spacetime can support, and EP is the Planck energy. From the conceptual background of the theory it is obvious that Es cannot exceed EP. The choice of the rainbow functions should be such that they respect the correspondence principle, i.e. at the IR limit we should be able to recover the usual energy-momentum dispersion relations of classical GR from the Eqn. (1). This means that the rainbow functions are required to satisfy the relations,(2)limEs/EP\u21920\u2061F(E)=1,limEs/EP\u21920\u2061G(E)=1. In the above relations the limit ES/EP\u21920 corresponds to a spacetime with low energy where GR becomes dominant. It is expected that as Es\u2192EP, effects of GR gradually fades away and quantum gravity effects become more and more dominant. The rainbow functions are motivated from various theoretical and phenomenological considerations in literature. Using the results from loop quantum gravity and \u03ba-Minkowski noncommutative spacetime these functions have been proposed as [34], [35],(3)F(Es/EP)=1,G(Es/EP)=1\u2212\u03b7EsEP where \u03b7 is a constant. The modified dispersion from constant velocity of light motivates the following rainbow functions [33]\n(4)F(Es/EP)=G(Es/EP)=11\u2212a1EsEP where a1 is a constant. Moreover the observations of the hard spectra from gamma ray bursters have been used motivate the rainbow functions [30],(5)F(Es/EP)=ea2Es/EP\u22121a2Es/EP,G(Es/EP)=1 where a2 is a constant. In this study it makes sense to use the rainbow functions given by eqn. (3) because the choice is motivated from a theory of quantum gravity (loop quantum gravity).",

For this reason gravitational collapse has been a field of interest for astrophysicists over the years. It all started with Oppenheimer and Snyder who studied the collapse of a dust cloud with a static Schwarzschild exterior and Friedmann like interior [44]. Subsequently the collapse of spherically symmetric inhomogeneous distribution of dust was studied by Tolman [45] and Bondi [46]. In 1969, Roger Penrose in a phenomenal paper [47] argued that any types of cosmological singularity is bound to be shrouded by an event horizon thus making it a Black Hole (BH). This proposal is popularly known in literature as the Cosmic Censorship Hypothesis (CCH). But this idea has subsequently been questioned in the absence of any form of rigorous proof or observational evidence. This naturally led people to search for collapsing models that can yield singularities which are uncensored, commonly known as Naked Singularities (NS) [48], [49], [50], [51], [52], [53], [54]. Such an uncensored singularity will be really interesting to study because it will leak information that is generally hidden behind the event horizon of a BH. Not only the solution of information paradox but a proper knowledge of NS will eventually help us understand the gravity quanta thus allowing us to formulate the illusive satisfactory theory of quantum gravity.",

This is a generalization of the Schwarzschild solution for non-static mass. Schwarzschild's external solution can represent the gravitational field of a cold dark body with a constant mass. So it is obvious that the application of this solution to describe the sun's gravitational field should only be considered as approximate. Vaidya's metric precisely solved this problem by successfully describing the spacetime of Sun. In fact it can represent the spacetime of any radiating mass, such as a star. This is why it is sometimes called the radiating or shining Schwarzschild metric. It should be mentioned here that this metric, if expressed in radiation coordinates, differs from the Schwarzschild metric only in that the constant mass parameter m is replaced by a function of retarded time. Notable studies using gravity's rainbow in Vaidya's metric can be found in [56], [57], [58]. Other important studies on Vaidya spacetime can be found in [59], [60], [61], [62], [63].",

This can be achieved by introducing rainbow deformations in the Vaidya spacetime in the background of a gravity theory. f(R) gravity being the simplest and most obvious theory of modified gravity at least at the mathematical level, we are inclined to consider it in the background of our model. It is expected that the radiating star represented by Vaidya spacetime will yield very interesting results in the quantum limit. The model will be investigated via a study of gravitational collapse, which is a very important astrophysical phenomenon. The study will be eventually complimented by a thermodynamical study in the said model. The search for the illusive theory of quantum gravity is a motivation for the present work and we hope that our investigation will be a step towards the better understanding of the nature of gravity quanta. The paper is organized as follows. In Sec. 2, the field equations for the rainbow deformed Vaidya spacetime in f(R) gravity are derived and a solution is obtained. Sec. 3 is dedicated to the study of gravitational collapse in the system. In Sec. 4 we have studied the thermodynamical properties of the system in detail. Finally the paper is concluded with a conclusion and discussion in Sec. 5.",

So the parameter a can also be written in the form a=1/M2, where mass becomes the free parameter of the gravity theory. It can easily be seen that GR can be retrieved from the theory for a=0. Using eqns.

Hence it is not surprising that it will reduce to Starobinsky's model for some physical restrictions. But it should be mentioned here that one should be cautious in using a generic form of power law model because for all values of the exponent the model may not remain cosmologically viable or for all values the model may not satisfy the standard observational tests. Amendola et al. [8] points out such a discrepancy and rules out some basic models of f(R) theory. There are other examples as well. In the light of these results any unhindered and free use of the power law model will be worrying. However here our concern is to keep our study as generic as possible and not bother about observational compliances.

So in principle they should be obtained from suitable initial or boundary conditions and physically should represent the mass of the system. Obviously these initial and boundary conditions will correspond to some particular physically viable cases of the generic mathematical solutions. Therefore we should consider those particular cases which are compatible with the present study of gravitational collapse. Our choice for these functions should be guided by the fact that for some suitable transformations we should be able to retrieve those chosen functions as initial or boundary conditions for our system. We further mention that we will only consider self similar expressions for these functions to suit our analysis. Non self similar expressions can also be considered with consequences.

Unable to get a general solution by the known algebraic methods, we have resorted to numerical techniques to get an idea of the nature of X0, which in turn determines the nature of singularity formed. In Fig. 1, Fig. 2 we have generated contour plots for X0 against \u03b41 for different values of \u03b31 and \u03be1 respectively. From Fig. 1 we see that for \u03b41<0, X0 remains in the negative level for different values of \u03b31, thus favouring the formation of a BH. But for \u03b41>0, we see trajectories of X0 both in the negative and positive levels. This indicates that there is a realistic chance of formation of NS for this range. In Fig. 2, we have almost a similar result as in Fig. 1. In the both the figures we see that the tendency of formation of NS increases with the increase in the value of the parameter. So the dependencies of collapsing procedure on \u03b31 and \u03be1 are almost of the identical nature.",

Only around \u03be1\u22658, we see that there is a transition and the possibility of the formation of an event horizon brightens. It should also be mentioned here that an increase in the value of \u03b41 decreases the chance of formation of NS. A near similar trend is obtained in Fig. 4 where we see that the tendency of formation of NS increases with the increase in \u03b31. Moreover the transition from NS to BH starts at an earlier stage around \u03be1=3 as compared to Fig. 3. The study would lose its significance if we cannot understand the role played by gravity's rainbow in the collapsing scenario. This is shown in Fig. 5, where we clearly see the trajectories for different rainbow functions and can also compare with that of general relativity. It can be seen that gravity's rainbow has a tendency to push the trajectories towards the positive level thus indicating greater affinity towards the formation of NS.",

The thermalization temperature of a system is defined as the temperature at which the system attains thermal equilibrium. The relation for thermalization temperature is given by,(70)T=14\u03c0ddrf(t,r)|r=rh For the Starobinsky's model the expression for thermalization temperature becomes,(71)T=14F2(E)\u03c0r3[\u2212rf1(t)+2f2(t)+r4(2f3(t)+3rf4(t))] The entropy of the system is given by,(72)S=\u03c02rh2 where we consider \u03c0G=1.

In this section we have used the rainbow functions given by eqn. (4). In the thermodynamic parameters it is seen that the rainbow function present is F(E). So if we use the rainbow functions given by eqn. (3) as used in the collapse study, the results would correspond to that of GR (since F(E)=1). This is the reason why we choose a different set of values for the rainbow functions for the thermodynamic study. Moreover by using different values of F(E) we can understand the effect of gravity's rainbow on the thermodynamics of the system and also compare with the results of GR by taking F(E)=1. From Fig. 11 it is seen that the range of thermalization temperature T increases with the increase in the value of \u03b41. On the contrary in Fig. 12 it is seen that the range of Internal Energy U decreases with increase in the value of \u03b41. In Fig. 13 the trend for Helmholtz free energy F1 is obtained against r. From the figure it is evident that with the increase in \u03b41, there is a decrease in the value of F1. In Fig. 14 a plot for the specific heat at constant volume C is obtained against r. From the figure we see that the curves are discontinuous and each of them have two branches. We see that C increases with the increase in \u03b41. Finally Fig. 15\nshows the effect of gravity's rainbow on the thermodynamic parameter T.",

Rainbow modifications to Vaidya geometry was considered, thus making the spacetime energy dependent in nature. As discussed earlier the rainbow modifications to a metric is significant only in the quantum regime, i.e. when the energy of the particle probed is comparable to the Planck energy (EP\u22481019GeV) and the length scale tends to the Planck length (LP\u224810\u221233cm). Under such a scenario the quantum fluctuations will be at play, and will have far reaching effect on the dynamics of the system.

In this work we considered the famous inflationary Starobinsky's model and the Power law model of f(R) gravity with suitable motivations. Solutions for each of these models were obtained separately which gave the mass of the collapsing system as a function of both the radial and temporal coordinates. Using them in the metric we obtained the geometries for each of the models. Here it should be mentioned that in the process of solving the system we have used the (11) component of the field equations given by eqn. (25). This has been done purely due to the simplicity of the equation compared to the others with no other bias. This choice helped us to reduce our computational efforts considerably, but in doing so we have missed out on a very important parameter, namely the density parameter \u03c1 of the matter content of the system. This is solely because \u03c1 did not feature in the (11) component of the field equations and hence remained absent in the subsequent analysis. So in our analysis dependence of the collapsing procedure on the matter content of the system could not be studied, which in turn restricted us from mapping our results to various cosmological eras.",

The study was aimed at enquiring the nature of singularity resulting from the collapse. A singularity censored by an event horizon will be a BH, but any singularity devoid of such horizon will be a naked one and easily accessible from the outside. So the loss of information and other problems posed by a BH will cease to exist for such type of singularities. This motivated us to initiate such a study. However the complexity of the systems provoked us to use numerical analysis in our study. In this context we mention here that our choice for the functions fi(t), i=1,2,3...12 seems to be self similar in nature. This has been done in accordance with the definition of X0 in eqn. (42), such that the gradient t/r can be formed without much complications. However, naturally the question arises that what would happen if we consider non self-similar terms? From the mathematical framework we see that under the limit r\u21920,t\u21920 non self-similar terms will result in the deletion of crucial terms or in the creation of mathematically undefined terms, both of which are undesirable. Deletion of important terms will result in loss of information about the system while undefined terms will make further mathematical computations next to impossible. From the study it is seen that NS is quite a possibility along with BH for the collapsing models. Fine tuning the initial conditions we may get NS or BH for different ranges of the parameters involved. It should be mentioned that this is a significant counter-example of the cosmic censorship hypothesis. Moreover it is seen that the naked singularity formed can be globally naked for certain scenarios.",

The deviations produced by the presence of rainbow functions favours the formation of NS. This is a very interesting finding given the renewed interest of scientists in NS. It is admitted that the result obtained depends on the initial data, which is expected from previous works like [54], [84]. Over the years it has been seen that the role of initial data is central to any study of gravitational collapse. We know that we have not been able to detect a NS till date. In the light of such a comment it seems that our work loses some significance. But on the contrary we would like to emphasize on the fact that our work should generate widespread motivations for the search of NS. This is more so because for quite sometime it is strongly believed that with the failure of cosmic censorship we would come face to face with the laws of quantum gravity, whenever gravitational collapse of a distant star results in a NS. Thus a complete Theory Of Everything (TOE) needs a proper knowledge of NS, which can act as a laboratory for quantum gravity.",

Finally we have concluded our analysis with a thermodynamical study of the system. Expressions for various thermodynamical parameters like the thermalization temperature, Internal energy, etc. have been deduced for the models and their nature have been analyzed via various plots. In a classical set-up it is expected that the thermalization temperature (T) should decrease with distance from the core of the star or with an increase in the size of the star. From the definition of the Internal energy (U) it is clear that its value should increase with the size of the star for a given T. Similarly the Helmholtz free energy F1 should also increase with an increase in r, given its definition and relative trends of T and U. Our results show deviations from the above expected results. Such deviations can be attributed to the quantum fluctuations of our model. Our study reveals information that characterizes a quantum evolution of the universe. So we are hopeful on the fact that these results will be useful in any future attempts towards the formulation of a successful theory of quantum gravity.",
