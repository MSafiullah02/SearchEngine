On day 8 he was anuric and required hemodialysis and received the first plasma exchange. A treatment with ritonavir/lopinavir and dexamethasone (55 milligrams in 6 days) was given. He received a total of 7 plasma exchanges. The patient was still under intermittent hemodialysis and nephrotic syndrome was unchanged 21 days after the first symptoms of COVID-19. Renal histology showed a collapsing glomerulopathy with acute tubular necrosis (Figure 1). Electron microscopy revealed severe podocyte changes including diffuse foot processes effacement and marked cytoplasmic vacuolization. No characteristic viral particles were seen. Furthermore, there were diffuse signs of endothelial injury, in both peritubular and glomerular capillaries, including swelling of endothelial cells. Interestingly, glomerular endothelial cells contained numerous tubuloreticular inclusions (also known as \"interferon footprints\") as shown on Figure 1B. Tubuloreticular inclusions can be observed during lupus nephritis, interferon treatment, and various viral infections, especially HIV. These findings suggest a systemic response to SARS-Cov-2 with enhanced type 1 interferon expression, which may be responsible for the glomerular and endothelial lesions.",
