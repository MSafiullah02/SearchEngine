The ODC and definitions for identification of overdose cases are described elsewhere. 2 Persons who died prior to December 31, 2017 were excluded. Risk factors for serious COVID-19-related illness were identified from the literature: 1) chronic pulmonary disease (including asthma, COPD), 2) diabetes, 3) hypertension, 4) coronary heart disease, 5) over 50 years of age, 6) male sex, and 7) Elixhauser Comorbidity Index (ECI) of 2+. 3, 4 To be recorded as having risk factors 1-4, persons must have had two physician billing records or one hospitalization record in a one year period from 2015-2017. 5,6 Demographic information were extracted from the Client Roster for the year 2017. 7 The ECI was calculated using hospitalization data for all chronic diseases excluding respiratory illness, drug abuse, diabetes, hypertension, and coronary heart disease. Chi-square tests were used to compare risk factors by overdose history.",
