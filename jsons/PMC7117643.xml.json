            "text": "Human coronaviruses (HCoV) were first described in the mid-1960s. HCoV is an enveloped RNA virus with a single chain and positive polarity. The name \u201ccorona\u201d comes from the crown-like spikes on the surface of the virus. Four major subgroups are known as follows: alpha, beta, gamma and delta. Subtypes of coronaviruses circulating in humans (HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-NL63 and HKU1-CoV) are mostly viruses that cause colds. Coronaviruses are zoonotic viruses that infect many mammals and birds [1]. There are many coronaviruses that have not been transmitted to humans yet but are detected in animals. Before the virus (most likely a bat virus) gained the ability to infect humans, it jumps an intermediate host as occurred in previous outbreaks. It has been revealed that for emerge of SARS-CoV (Severe acute respiratory syndrome), civet cats played an imported role for transmission of disease to humans, whereas one-humped camels played an intermediate host for MERS-CoV (Middle East Respiratory Syndrome) [2]. SARS-CoV was first defined in February 2003 in Asia (Guandong, China) and has spread to more than two dozen countries in North and South America, Europe and Asia. In about eight months, 8098 people are infected, and 774 people died. Since 2004, to our knowledge, there have been no new cases reported in the world. MERS- CoV also causes a severe respiratory disease with symptoms of fever, cough and shortness of breath. The disease was seen for the first time in September 2012 in Saudi Arabia, and all the patients with MERS- CoV had a history of travel or residence in the Arabian Peninsula and nearby countries. Outside the Arabian Peninsula, the disease was seen in the Republic of Korea in 2015. Again, the outbreak was associated with a traveler returning from the Arabian Peninsula. To date, 2494 people have been infected, and there 858 related deaths were reported related to MERS [2, 3].",

Findings compatible with fever, dyspnea and bilateral lung pneumonic infiltration were detected in most cases. Fatal cases were reported so far have generally been older individuals or individuals with concomitant systemic disease [6\u20138]. The first imported case is a 61-year-old Chinese woman reported from Thailand on January 13, 2020. On January 14, 2020, a male patient in his 30s was reported by the Ministry of Health of Japan as the second imported case. The two imported cases were reported from Thailand and Japan, who have a travel history to Wuhan province, with no history of visiting the seafood market where the first cluster was identified. The virus was defined by authorities as coronaviruses on January 7, 2020, and refined down the total number of the cases. As the number of cases has increased, Chinese authorities have quarantined the city of Wuhan and many other cities, suspended travel in and out in Hubei province [6\u20138].",

            "text": "At the end of January 2020, 2019-nCoV declared as global health emergency by the World Health Organization. The researchers tried to estimate the size of the epidemic in Wuhan and predict the risk for local and global dimensions. The mean incubation period was found to be 5.2 days (4.1 to 7), the basic reproductive number was estimated to be 2.2 (95% CI, 1.4 to 3.9). The researchers calculated the number of infected patients as 75.800 for January 2020 (about 10 times that reported) using travel data. They found doubling time as 6.4 days and R0 as 2.68. The researchers were assumed that the outbreak would peak in April and if necessary measures are taken and the growth rate of the epidemics slows down, the transmission of the virus can be reduced by 25%. Thus, the total number of cases can be decreased by 50%. The fatality rate of disease was reported as 2% by early February [10]. Non-survivors that have been reported so far are generally older or have concomitant systemic disease. Systemic symptoms, lymphopenia and thrombocytopenia were found more common and radiological involvement was more severe among people over 60. High CRP and LDH levels were also reported more frequently among older patients. A study found that the median age of patients died as 75 (48\u201389). On the other hand, children were less susceptible to viruses or had a mild infection as compared with adults [7, 11]. Studies calculated a basic reproduction number (R0) of the disease to foresee how far the virus spread. A study of 425 patients found a basic reproduction number as 2.2% (95% CI, 1,4 to 3.9) [12]. The WHO (World Health Organization) estimated that each individual infected with 2019-nCoV transmitted the virus to an average of 1.4 to 2.5 others for the earlier phase of the outbreak. That means 2019-nCoV less contagious than SARS, which had an R0 of 3, but more contagious than seasonal flu.",

Health checks to identify sick passengers who may come from risky areas were performed at all entry points of the country, such as airports and sea entry points. Early warning systems activated in all borders of the country. Specific actions were taken in case of the determination of any suspicion of illness. Infection control measures primarily hand hygiene and the proper use of personal protective equipment (such as medical mask, N95/FFP2, face shields, gloves) were promoted by health authorities. A guideline for health care professionals was established immediately, including the definition of suspected and definite cases, also preventive and control measures for transmission of disease in all healthcare facilities. The guideline included algorithms for healthcare workers for how to manage the disease, transport and referral criteria of patients and clearly defined the duties and responsibilities of facilities. The guideline also included information for people coming from or going to countries where disease experienced.
