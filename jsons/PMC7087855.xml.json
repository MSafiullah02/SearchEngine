            "text": "Aldosterone is known to exert both classical and non-classical actions. The classical actions on the kidney are mainly observed in collecting duct cells, where it induces potassium secretion and sodium reabsorption. Aldosterone\u2019s non-classical actions cause tissue injury in various organs, including the heart, arteries, and kidney [1]. Both the classical and the non-classical actions of aldosterone are mediated by a specific mineralocorticoid receptor and are inhibited by its antagonists, spironolactone and eplerenone. In collecting duct cells, it has been reported that nuclear factor \u03baB (NF\u03baB), which plays pivotal roles in inflammation mediated by various cytokines, is activated by aldosterone and that its activation plays a key role in the regulation of electrolyte transporters in collecting duct cells [2, 3]. It has also been reported that NF\u03baB is activated in cardiomyocytes [4] and cultured mesangial cells [5] and mediates the pro-inflammatory and fibrotic actions of aldosterone. It has been suggested that aldosterone activates AP-1 as well as NF\u03baB in cultured renal fibroblasts [6] and induces osteopontin expression, which in turn increases expression of collagen types 1, 3, and 5. In contrast to the findings in these studies, aldosterone has been found to prevent NF\u03baB-induced tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-\u03b1 production in neutrophils [7], suggesting that the relationship between aldosterone and NF\u03baB activation may vary with the tissue and cell type. In the present study we investigated whether the pro-inflammatory actions and fibrotic actions of aldosterone are mediated by NF\u03baB activation in in-vivo experiments, and changes in expression of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), which is known to act as protective factor in various kidney injuries, were also determined in the aldosterone-infused rats.",

Total RNA was purified by using an RNeasy Fibrous Tissue Mini Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. The RNA concentration was determined by spectrometry with a NanoDrop 1000 spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA). First-strand cDNA was generated from 1 \u03bcg of total RNA by using random hexamer and a SuperScript III First-Strand Synthesis Kit (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA). Quantitative real-time PCR assays were performed by Taqman Gene Expression assays using Taqman universal PCR master mix (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA). A 10-ng sample of total RNA from each sample (0.1 ng for 18 s rRNA) was used in a 25-\u03bcl reaction mixture.

To determine whether the brush-border membrane itself was injured by aldosterone, we performed double staining of the kidney with anti-ACE2 and anti-megalin antibodies.

In diabetic and various renal injuries, it has been reported that NF\u03baB activation was observed not only in experimental animals [14, 15] but also in patients with kidney diseases [16]. In addition, our previous study [10] clearly showed that albumin-overload-induced tissue injury is mediated by NF\u03baB activation. The results of studies regarding the relationship between aldosterone and NF\u03baB activation have shown that the relationship between them depends on the cell type. In cultured renal fibroblasts [6] and freshly isolated cortical collecting duct (CCD) cells [2, 3], aldosterone was shown to activate the NF\u03baB pathway, whereas it was found to directly antagonize the action of interleukin (IL)-8 and granulocyte colony stimulating factor (GCSF)-induced NF\u03baB activation in neutrophils [7], and also induced NF\u03baB activation in cultured mesangial cells [5]. Consistent with the results of these in-vitro experiments, the results of the present study showed that aldosterone activates NF\u03baB and that systemic inhibition of NF\u03baB by a specific inhibitor, IMD-1041, mitigated the kidney injury and the increase in mRNA expression of pro-inflammatory and fibrotic cytokines under in-vivo conditions, although the effects of IMD-1041 were partial in these changes of mRNA expression, probably due to at least two mechanisms. The effects of aldosterone are known to be mediated by the AP-1 pathway as well as by NF\u03baB activation [6], and presumably the AP-1 pathway was still active and capable of inducing tissue injury in our experiment. The other possibility for the limited effects of IMD-1041 is that hypertension remained unchanged. The blood pressure levels of the aldosterone-infused rats were not significantly changed by IMD-1041, and high blood pressure could induce kidney injury and changes in mRNA expression of pro-inflammatory and fibrotic cytokines. Despite this limitation, the NF\u03baB inhibitor IMD-1041 may be a good candidate drug for the treatment of diabetic nephropathy and various kidney diseases.",

In the immunofluorescence studies, ACE2 staining was mainly seen on the brush-border membranes of the PCT. Co-localization of ACE2 and megalin, a PCT marker protein, confirmed this localization of ACE2. The previous studies consistently demonstrated that ACE2 staining in the rat kidney is in the PCT, whereas the results for glomerular staining with anti-ACE2 antibody have varied [18\u201322]. No glomerular staining of ACE2 was seen in the present study, and the staining was mainly seen on the brush-border membranes.

            "text": "The results of the present study showed that aldosterone down-regulates ACE2 via the NF\u03baB pathway, and the decrease in ACE2 did not appear to have been caused by destruction of the brush-border membrane, because megalin staining, a marker of the brush-border membrane, was unchanged in the aldosterone group. ACE2 has recently been cloned, and its physiological and pathophysiological roles have been characterized in the lung, kidney, and cardiovascular system [23]. In addition to its role as receptor protein for the SARS virus, ACE2 acts as a protective factor against tissue injury by angiotensin II. Indeed, changes in ACE2 expression and activity have been reported in various kidney injury models. ACE2 expression in the tubules of rats with streptozotocin-induced diabetes has been found to be decreased [21], and kidney biopsy specimens from diabetic patients have shown decreased expression of tubular and glomerular ACE2 [24]. Spontaneously hypertensive rats also show decreased tubular ACE2 expression when they develop hypertension, whereas glomerular expression of ACE2 increased after birth and after the development of hypertension [19]. Our previous study revealed that protein overload induced a decrease in ACE2 expression via NF\u03baB activation [11]. ACE2 expression in cultured neonatal rat cardiomyocytes was significantly decreased by aldosterone, and the specific mineralocorticoid receptor inhibitor eplerenone completely abolished this effect of aldosterone [25], consistent with the results of the present study in the kidney. Furthermore, the results of the present study clearly showed that the decrease in ACE2 protein expression by aldosterone was mitigated by NF\u03baB inhibition. Combining our previous results [11] and the present data, it was suggested that ACE2 expression was down-regulated by NF\u03baB activation. It is possible, however, that the down-regulation of ACE2 by NF\u03baB in this study was induced by the indirect effect of systemic inhibition of NF\u03baB, since IMD-1041 was orally administered. In addition, it was not determined which cells in the kidney were involved in the effects of IMD-1041, for the same reason. Previous reports on tissue injury by aldosterone have clearly shown that inflammation plays important roles in the remodeling of the heart, vasculature, and kidney [26, 27]. Furthermore, emerging evidence suggests that aldosterone receptors are present in various types of cells, including endothelial cells, macrophages, vascular smooth cells, cardiac cells, and renal tubular and glomerular cells, and that activation of the aldosterone receptor on these cells could induce inflammation in the organs [26, 27]. Therefore, it is possible that NFkB was activated by aldosterone and induced inflammation not only in tubular and mesangial cells but also in various intrarenal and extrarenal cells, such as macrophages and endothelial cells, and that the beneficial effects of IMD-1041 treatment, amelioration of kidney injury and the increase in ACE2, were exerted by inhibition of NFkB activity in all of these cell types. On the other hand, in this present study, we did not examine the entire intrarenal renin\u2013angiotensin system, which includes local renin production, ACE activity, and angiotensin metabolism. The determination of the changes in the intrarenal renin\u2013angiotensin system should shed light on the exact role of ACE2 in aldosterone-induced kidney injury and should be performed in future studies.",
