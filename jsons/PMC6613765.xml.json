Coronaviruses (CoVs) represent a group of enveloped, positive-sense, single-stranded viruses with large genomes (27 to 33 kb) and capable of causing respiratory, enteric, hepatic, and neurological diseases of differing severities in diverse animal species, including humans. All CoVs have a similar genome organization: approximately two-thirds of the 5\u2032-proximal genome contains the ORF1a/b replicase gene, and the remainder encodes the spike, envelope, membrane, and nucleocapsid structural proteins along with several accessory proteins. CoVs belong to the family Coronaviridae in the order Nidovirales (1) and are divided into four genera: alpha-, beta-, gamma-, and delta-CoVs. Only alpha- and beta-CoVs can infect humans, with four CoVs currently known to be prevalent: human CoV 229E (HCoV-229E), HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1, and HCoV-NL63. Severe acute respiratory syndrome CoV (SARS-CoV) and Middle East respiratory syndrome CoV (MERS-CoV) (2, 3) are considered the most emergent CoVs.",

            "text": "CoV infections are difficult to prevent and cure. Although CoV replication machinery exhibits substantial proofreading activity, estimates of the nucleotide mutation rate in CoVs are moderate to high relative to that of other single-stranded RNA viruses. Additionally, the large RNA genome in CoVs allows for extra plasticity in genome modification by recombination (4\u20136). Moreover, many animal CoVs cause long-term or persistent enzootic infections, which increase the probability of infecting a new host species. SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV are recent examples of newly emergent CoVs that cause severe human diseases (7, 8). Several drugs, such as ribavirin, lopinavir-ritonavir, interferon, and corticosteroids, have been used to treat patients infected with SARS-CoV or MERS-CoV (9\u201312). However, contradictory findings on their efficacy and concerns over tolerability and clinical benefit have limited the use of antiviral therapeutics for CoVs. Although substantial effort has focused on identifying antivirals for CoV treatment, no approved therapeutic (drug or biological agent) is currently available for the prophylaxis or treatment of CoV-related disease. Treatments for emerging CoV diseases rely upon supportive care and the judicious use of limited quantities of experimental therapeutics (13). Moreover, the lack of effective drugs, the high morbidity and mortality rates caused by the virus, and the potential of epidemic spread highlight the need for new broad-spectrum anti-CoV drugs, especially given the likelihood of infection by novel CoVs (13).",

            "text": "Several recent studies highlighted potential broad-spectrum inhibitors against CoVs (13\u201317). de Wilde et al. (14) identified numerous potent MERS-CoV inhibitors through screening of a U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved drug library. Interestingly, all of the screened compounds were also capable of inhibiting the replication of SARS-CoV and HCoV-229E. Dyall et al. (15) also screened 27 compounds with activity against both MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV from a 290-compound library; however, the half-maximal effective concentration (EC50) values of most of these drugs were relatively high in vitro but were not assessed in vivo, making their clinical utility questionable. M\u00fcller et al. (16) found that silvestrol was a potent and nontoxic inhibitor of cap-dependent viral mRNA translation in CoV-infected human primary cells, with EC50 values of 1.3 nM and 3 nM for MERS-CoV and HCoV-229E, respectively. Notably, Sheahan et al. (17) showed that a nucleotide prodrug (GS-5734) could inhibit SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV replication in multiple in vitro systems at submicromolar half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) values. Furthermore, the prophylactic and early therapeutic administration of GS-5734 significantly reduced the lung viral load and improved clinical signs of disease, as well as respiratory function, in a mouse model of SARS-CoV pathogenesis, further supporting the development of GS-5734 as a broad-spectrum therapeutic to protect against CoVs.",

We recently reported that a genetically engineered CoV strain (HCoV-OC43) expressing Renilla luciferase (Rluc; rOC43-ns2Del-Rluc) facilitates high-throughput screening (HTS) for broad-spectrum anti-CoV agents and quantitative analysis of CoV replication (18). In the present study, we performed HTS of a 2,000-compound library containing FDA-approved drugs and pharmacologically active compounds and assessed broad-spectrum anti-CoV activity in vitro and in vivo in an experimental infection mouse model. This comprehensive screening and assessment provided new candidate inhibitors to effectively treat infections by existing CoVs, as well as those by emergent strains in the future.",

Moreover, we newly identified nine compounds (phenazopyridine, lycorine, pyrvinium pamoate, monensin sodium, cetylpyridinium chloride, oligomycin, loperamide, harmine, and conessine) as exhibiting antiviral activity against severe CoV (MERS-CoV) (Table 1). Interestingly, the following seven compounds inhibited the replication of all CoVs with EC50 values of <5 \u03bcM: lycorine, emetine, phenazopyridine, mycophenolic acid, mycophenolate mofetil, pyrvinium pamoate, and monensin sodium (Table 1, compounds indicated in bold).",

Lycorine, an active alkaloid from the common folk medicine Lycoris radiata (Amaryllidaceae) has been investigated for its multifunctional biological effects, including anticancer, antimalarial, antiviral, antibacterial, and anti-inflammatory activities (19\u201323). Lycorine showed potent anti-CoV activity, with EC50 values ranging from 0.15 \u03bcM to 1.63 \u03bcM. Moreover, the selective index (SI) of lycorine for HCoV-OC43 was calculated at 29.13, indicating its potent anti-HCoV-OC43 activity (Fig. 2A). Emetine is an active principal of ipecac and inhibits the replication of both DNA and RNA viruses. Additionally, emetine displayed potent anti-CoV activity and the strongest anti-MERS-CoV activity among the top seven inhibitors, with an EC50 value of 0.34 \u03bcM and an SI of 9.06 (Fig. 2B). Mycophenolic acid (an immunosuppressant) exerted a significant inhibitory effect on HCoV-OC43 replication, with an EC50 of 1.95 \u03bcM, and showed stronger anti-HCoV-NL63 activity than the others (EC50 of 0.18 \u03bcM and SI of 19.11) (Fig. 2E). Mycophenolate mofetil, a derivative of mycophenolic acid, showed an antiviral effect on the four CoVs similar to that of mycophenolic acid, suggesting that the two drugs might harbor similar core structures and antiviral mechanisms (Fig. 2C and E). Moreover, phenazopyridine, a widely used urinary analgesic, also displayed strong broad-spectrum anti-CoV activity for the first time, especially against MHV-A59 (EC50 of 0.77 \u03bcM and SI of >25.97) (Fig. 2D). Pyrvinium pamoate is an FDA-approved anthelminthic drug and a potent inhibitor of WNT signaling, suggested to occur through direct activation of protein kinase CK1\u03b1 (24). Pyrvinium pamoate inhibited the replication of all CoVs and displayed low toxicity (50% cytotoxic concentration [CC50], >19 \u03bcM) (Fig. 2F). Finally, monensin sodium, previously shown to inhibit the formation of gamma-CoV infectious bronchitis virus (IBV), inhibited all CoVs at low EC50 values and displayed low toxicity (Fig. 2G). Although the specific antiviral mechanisms of these seven inhibitors against CoVs are unknown, they showed potential as new antivirals for the treatment of infections caused by a range of CoVs.",

Moreover, this model was convenient based on the lack of need for three biological facilities, in contrast to experiments involving SARS-CoV or MERS-CoV. Therefore, we used this model to evaluate the in vivo antiviral activity of the seven inhibitors. Intracerebral or intranasal inoculation of HCoV-OC43 results in acute-onset severe neurological illness and causes death, with high levels of viral replication in the brain (titer, >106 50% tissue culture infective doses [TCID50]/ml) at 3 to 5 days after infection (26\u201329). Briefly, female BALB/c mice (12 days old) were inoculated via the intranasal route with 100 TCID50 of HCoV-OC43-WT and treated with the seven inhibitors for 14 days, and their survival was monitored for up to 20 days. The inhibitor doses and regimens were selected based on acute-toxicity assessments. Emetine was used at 5 mg/kg, and chloroquine was used as the positive control, which showed antiviral activity at 30 mg/kg. All mice in the phosphate-buffered saline (PBS)-DMSO-treated group died within 6 days after HCoV-OC43-WT challenge (Fig. 5A). In contrast, 83.3% of mice in the lycorine-treated group were still alive at 20 days postinoculation (P < 0.001), similar to the survival rate of the chloroquine-treated group (Fig. 5A). Additionally, viral loads in the brain and spinal cord were under the limit of detection in the lycorine-treated group (Fig. 5B), and immunohistochemistry (IHC) of mouse brain coronal sections showed that HCoV-OC43 nucleocapsid protein was present only in the PBS-DMSO-treated group, not in the lycorine-treated group (Fig. 5C).",

Indeed, no specific antiviral agent or vaccine is currently available for human or zoonotic CoV infections, despite the extensive research efforts triggered by the SARS outbreak (30\u201332). Several FDA-approved drugs (ritonavir, lopinavir, nelfinavir, mycophenolic acid, and ribavirin) inhibit the entry and/or replication of MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV, or other human CoVs in multiple cell lines; however, their antiviral efficacy in vivo remains unknown (16, 32\u201337). To date, few small molecules have demonstrated anti-CoV activity in animal models of CoV infection (17, 38, 39), and most of the available anti-CoV drugs that target structural proteins might not be effective against other CoVs. For example, the human monoclonal antibodies and antiviral peptides that block virus-host cell binding typically have a limited breadth of protection due to the antigenic diversity in the CoV spike glycoprotein (40, 41). It is worth mentioning that combining antiviral peptides with beta interferon (IFN-\u03b2) (40) or combination therapy with different humanized or human monoclonal antibodies targeting non-cross-resistant epitopes (42) can enhance antiviral therapeutic effects. There are also several reports of the enhanced therapeutic effects of combinations of other antiviral agents for the treatment of MERS-CoV. These results indicate that the combined use of different antiviral agents might be synergistic in their treatment of CoV infection.",

            "text": "The criteria for the inhibition rate associated with the signals in the antiviral HTS assay ranged from \u223c30% to \u223c90% according to different references, with more primary hits but fewer efficacy hits screened when the inhibition rate was set to the lower threshold. In our experiment, we focused on screening hits with higher potency and, therefore, so established the inhibition threshold at 70%. Furthermore, we identified several effective hits with a high degree of cytotoxicity under 10 \u03bcM in our primary screening, which was why the cytotoxicity value was set to 80%. Finally, we identified 36 compounds exhibiting anti-HCoV-OC43 activity from a library of compounds, two of which (chloroquine and loperamide) were previously reported as exhibiting broad-spectrum anti-CoV activity. Nine compounds (phenazopyridine, lycorine, pyrvinium pamoate, monensin sodium, cetylpyridinium chloride, oligomycin, loperamide, harmine, and conessine) have not previously been demonstrated as exhibiting antiviral activity against MERS-CoV, thereby offering new therapeutic possibilities for this severe CoV. Furthermore, seven compounds (lycorine, emetine, monensin sodium, mycophenolate mofetil, mycophenolic acid, phenazopyridine, and pyrvinium pamoate) showed inhibitory activity against multiple genetically distinct CoVs in vitro at low-micromolar concentrations (EC50 values ranging from 0.12 to 3.81 \u03bcM). Among these, lycorine is an alkaloid isolated from Amaryllidaceae plants and reportedly exhibits anticancer, antiplasmodial, antitrypanosomal, anti-inflammatory, analgesic, and emetic activities (43\u201345). Lycorine inhibits the replication of poliomyelitis virus, herpes simplex virus 1, Bunyamwera virus, West Nile virus, dengue virus, and SARS-CoV in vitro, although the mechanism remains to be elucidated (46\u201349). Liu et al. (50) demonstrated the ability of lycorine to reduce the mortality of human enterovirus 71-infected mice by inhibiting viral replication. Furthermore, Guo et al. (51) evaluated a total of 32 lycorine derivatives, demonstrating that 1-acetyllycorine suppressed enterovirus 71 and hepatitis C virus replication in various cells. Moreover, drug resistance analysis revealed that 1-acetyllycorine targeted a phenylalanine (F76) in the viral proteases. Lycorine also exhibits strong activities against influenza A virus H5H1 in vitro and delays the export of nucleoprotein from the nucleus to the cytoplasm during replication (52). However, the potential mechanism of lycorine against CoVs requires further exploration, and its potential selection for drug-resistant strains must be assessed. We found no reports concerning whether its use in combination enhances the antiviral efficacy of lycorine. Additionally, emetine is a drug used mainly as both an antiprotozoal and an emetic (53), with a number of groups recently reporting new antiviral roles for emetine. Emetine is reportedly a potent inhibitor that suppresses the replication of several RNA viruses (dengue virus and HIV) without generating drug-resistant variant viruses (54\u201356). We noted that emetine inhibits human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) replication by disrupting the HCMV-induced interaction between p53 and the E3-ubiquitin ligase MDM2 (57). Moreover, a recent study revealed emetine as an inhibitory modulator of rabies virus axonal transport via a mechanism independent of protein synthesis inhibition (58). Furthermore, Yang et al. (59) demonstrated that emetine inhibits Zika virus (ZIKV) replication via inhibition of ZIKV NS5 polymerase activity and disruption of lysosomal function. In the present study, our preliminary result indicated that emetine inhibited MERS-CoV entry. Interestingly, the immunosuppressant mycophenolic acid and its derivative mycophenolate mofetil, which suppress MERS-CoV replication (33), also inhibited HCoV-OC43 replication (EC50 values of 1.95 and 1.58 \u03bcM, respectively). However, a previous study showed that MERS-CoV-infected common marmosets treated with mycophenolate mofetil had more severe forms of disease and higher lung viral loads than did untreated animals, and renal transplant recipients on maintenance mycophenolate mofetil therapy reportedly developed severe or fatal MERS (60). Therefore, these two inhibitors are unlikely to be useful against CoV infections. Monensin sodium, which affects IBV and MHV-A59 assembly (61, 62), was also identified as an inhibitor of other CoVs (MERS-CoV, HCoV-OC43, and HCov-NL63) in this study.",

However, most of the data and conclusions concerning the antiviral effects of the inhibitors were derived only from one cell line and should be tested in different CoV replication cell lines in order to exclude the influence of host cell factors, especially for MERS-CoV, for which there are a larger number of susceptible cell lines (e.g., Huh 7 or Calu3/2B4 cells). Therefore, further in vitro and in vivo studies are warranted to determine the potential antiviral mechanisms associated with the seven compounds, as well as their clinical efficacy.
