Although there are variations across countries in regulations, societal norms, and business relationships, legitimacy building has been largely overlooked as a specific driver of industry development. In a similar vein of institutional theory, stakeholder theory assumes that a firm has a target stakeholder group for the intended behavior (Husted and Allen, 2006; Yang and Rivers, 2009). The leading platform firms in East Asia, such as Alibaba, GMarket, and Rakuten, are the central entities in the national e-commerce industry. Leveraging their positions in the industry, they have been creating different patterns of interactions within current institutional environments and thereby have benefitted from legitimacy successfully established in the environmental context. The buyers (consumers), sellers, suppliers, and government have been important in this context, as they are major stakeholders that affect the future growth of the e-commerce platform leaders.",

In this study, therefore, we focus on legitimacy building and examine its link to development of an e-commerce platform. Legitimacy is \u201ca generalized perception or assumption that the actions of an entity are desirable, proper, or appropriate within some socially constructed system of norms, values, beliefs, and definitions\u201d (Suchman, 1995: 574). Because a firm is a socio-economic entity, it feels pressure to gain legitimacy from stakeholders for its broad acceptance (Bergek et al., 2008). Hence, it is reasonable to assume that firms in the e-commerce platform industry try to build legitimacy in the given institutional environment, which in turn facilitates political, technical, and social acceptance and, further, leads to industrial development.",

In order to address the questions, we choose the e-commerce platform business in China and conduct an exploratory study. This research setting attracts us particularly because, most of all, China is growing quickly and is now the largest e-commerce market, showing 120% of compounded annual growth during 2003\u20132013 (McKinsey and Company, 2013). The high market concentration ratio almost characterizes China as an oligopolistic structure for e-commerce. This fact subsequently leads to the question of how the market-leading firm has built legitimacy, that is, how the e-commerce platform firms have justified their presence to stakeholders or society. This issue is very important in the future of China's e-commerce industry because the industry is now rapidly experiencing a global transformation.",

Legitimation goes through a social validation process that consists of the recognition of a distinctive competency possessed or role played by the organization in providing a good or service (Dacin et al., 2007). The social validation process occurs differently for each firm, and, thus, the level of legitimacy differs among firms. Legitimacy is distinct from reputation, which is based on an emotional reaction (Fombrun, 1996: 37), and it also differs from organizational prestige, which is a favorable public image regarding competencies (Perrow, 1961: 335).",

Firms engage in organizational actions out of their motivations to be socially and normatively recognized by stakeholders, which include shareholders, customers, governments, suppliers, and alliance partners. Institutional theory has proposed that a firm's action cannot be detached from the social context because it creates inter-dependence with the stakeholders (Amburgey et al., 1996). According to this view, even the most strategic choice is a deliberate attempt to create legitimacy in a society. Consequently, the institutional environment emerges as crucial, as it imposes pressure on firms to increase legitimacy by driving them into conforming to institutional rules, regulations, norms, and expectations (Dacin, 1997; Dacin et al., 2007; Scott, 1995).",

When firms want to increase their presence in the market or enter a new business field, they need recognition in the market and from the important stakeholders. Researchers propose that market legitimacy is especially pertinent and de facto required when governmental authority over business is substantial and government endorsement is essential for existence in a particular market (Peng, 2000; Yiu and Makino, 2002). For example, the Chinese government mandated a market-technology swap policy as a condition for foreign firms' entrance in China and wanted multinational enterprises to contribute to the local technological capability. Although GM was a later entrant, it established a joint R&D institute with a local automobile manufacturer and successfully demonstrated market legitimacy to the Chinese government (Lee et al., 2012).",

Constituents of the stakeholders vary, and key stakeholders differ depending upon the business context. However, what is common across contexts is to send all stakeholders a strong signal that the firm is worthy to do business with. The importance of perceived worthiness becomes even greater as globalization accelerates and increases the presence of international stakeholders in a firm's web of relationships (Bresser, 1988; Kanter, 1989). Relational legitimacy helps firms overcome the liability of foreignness and enhances trust and reliability (Zaheer, 1995). Inter-firm resources and expertise help deal with difficult situations, reduce risks, and enhance firm performance (Child and Faulkner, 1998). Therefore, the need for relational legitimacy is essential for firms that have to deal with a large number of stakeholders. Relational legitimacy enables firms to obtain trust and reliability from stakeholders, and, by so doing, the firms can have a wider range of partner choices in relationship formation (Dacin et al., 2007). For example, in the e-commerce industry, platform firms must deal with many sellers and buyers. The enhancement of relational legitimacy ensures buyer trust and, at the same time, can better attract qualified sellers.",

In China, where the government stands central in industrial development, managing a good relationship with the government is perceived as a state endorsement to society. The Chinese government firmly supported the Alipay launch in 2004 despite the strong opposition from state-owned banks. At a glance, the success of Alibaba appears to be attributed purely to the favorable treatment from the government. However, the relationship between Alibaba and the Chinese government has actually been complementary and mutually beneficent, not just unilateral patronage from the government. A previous manager at Alibaba told us that:\u201cA few years ago when Alibaba was about to open the G2C platform, the WTO (World Trade Organization) required China to make a free trade agreement as a condition of its membership. The Chinese government was ready and determined to join the WTO after simulating the potential benefits and losses for a long time. However, China traditionally allowed unofficial trade channels, so there were many imports that China's Customs could not figure out, whereas US Customs tightly controlled cross-border trade. This issue raised diplomatic conflicts with the US when China was about to sign with the US. At that, Alibaba argued that, given the corporate rule that only ID-checked customers could purchase overseas goods through Alibaba's global platform (G2C), it had all transaction information, including amounts and customer IDs for the imported goods, through its platform. The transactions via Alibaba became officially approved and encouraged by the Chinese government, particularly regarding cross-border purchases. Launching G2C led to a win-win situation in that the Chinese government welcomed Alibaba's new launch of the G2C platform as a complementary function to the current government.\u201d\n",

Alibaba has tried to build relational legitimacy by systemizing the communications between sellers and buyers (the key stakeholders for relational legitimacy) as well as among buyers in a more transparent and reliable way, which provides accurate and effective information. Alibaba has also taken more care of consumers, who have traditionally borne the risks of business transactions. Although Alibaba is a private firm that assumes profit seeking as its main goal, it has also been considerate to the seller firms and consumers on its platform. It has never placed its own financial gains on top but rather has tried to develop the business environment as friendly and facilitating as possible to everybody. The fact that other firms continue to imitate the Alibaba business model, along with Alibaba's commitment to provide a leading business model for other followers, help Alibaba firmly establish its relationship legitimacy.",

The Rural China Program, Taobao Village, and the Cainiao initiative have represented the efforts of Alibaba in building social legitimacy. The key stakeholders until recently were the lower-income classes in China. In our interviews, Alibaba made it clear that those who had higher demands for e-commerce were not the rich people but lower-income classes or rural residents. As the relevant infrastructure and logistics industry improved, however, Alibaba subsequently included upper-income society into the stakeholder group.",

Relatedly, Alibaba's current success is attributed reasonably to by its extensive and inclusive search for legitimacy. China's has several firms in the e-commerce platform business and, in fact, some have shown a good business performance. However, no firm was as challenging (seen from introduction of Alipay despite resistance of state-owned banks: market legitimacy), charity-oriented (seen from Taobao village establishment: social legitimacy), and partner-centered (based on the no-fee policy) as Alibaba. Most failed or became out of the business.",

As for the social legitimacy, Tencent did not consider e-commerce as its core business, so that its movements to attract merchants into the platform were very limited. Paipai made some efforts to establish supporting system for the advertisement or the online shop design to the merchants, but the efforts were not salient.

Our study implies that such social acceptance must be accompanied with a high level of legitimacy. Although technology standardization is usually in the realm of government, sometimes any standard endorsed by the government fails to be accepted in society. This research explains why some standards survive in the market and others do not when there are multiple standards in competition. The Alibaba experience clearly demonstrates that standards, even with government endorsement, should not condescend to the social aspects. Without acceptance in society, standardization would remain nothing but unnecessary state intervention. In this sense, our research, by illustrating how a business model became a de facto standard that greatly changed people's lives, demonstrates that any technology standard should be socially legitimate in order to be successful (that is, acceptance from people) and thereby contributes to the standard-related literature.",

Alibaba adopts its low platform fee strategy to attract and nurture sellers as compared with other leading international e-commerce platform companies. In terms of social legitimacy, the company could develop through embedding in the niche market and then expanding to the mainstream market.
