For this purpose, Huh-7 cells were transfected with the minigenomic construct p1b-1b, plasmid encoding a polyprotein encompassing NS3 to NS5B under the control of T7 RNA polymerase promoter, pAM8-1 plasmid expressing T7 RNA polymerase [14], and pGL3-Control vector. The cells were harvested at 3 days posttransfection, protein expression was verified by Western blot analysis (Fig. 2\n) and the replication of minigenome was determined by luciferase assay and Northern blot analysis. The firefly luciferase activity from cotransfected pGL3-Control vector was simultaneously measured to normalize the transfection efficiency. As shown in Fig. 3\nA, only background level of Renilla luciferase (Rluc) activity was detected in cells transfected with the empty vector. Cotransfection of the plasmid encoding the polyprotein NS3 to NS5B (pNS3-51b) resulted in significant Renilla luciferase expression. Omission of pAM8-1 in the transfection mixture completely abrogated Renilla luciferase activity, largely ruling out the possibility that the minus-strand RNA used here as the mRNA for reporter gene expression was synthesized as a consequence of the transcription by a cryptic promoter. Consistent with the results reported previously [13], Renilla luciferase activity was also detected in Huh\u2013NNRZ cells stably replicating the HCV subgenomic replicon, although it was lower than that in cells trans-expressing the polyprotein. The fact that the replicase complex reconstituted by trans-expressed polyprotein could support more efficient replication of the minigenome may be attributable to the higher expression level of plasmid-encoded protein on a per-transfected-cell basis. Alternatively, the recruitment of the replication complex to the minigenome may be competed by the subgenomic replicon, because both of these share the replication machinery in replicon cells.",

As shown in Fig. 3C, the deletion of GDD motif significantly attenuated the ability of NS proteins to support minigenome replication, and transduction with AdsiNS5B resulted in a substantial and dose-dependent reduction in luciferase expression.

For this purpose, HCV minigenome from distantly related genotype 2a (Fig. 1B, p2a-2a), minigenomes with 5\u2032-end deleted (Fig. 1C and D, pnu-1b and pnu-2a), and chimeric minigenomes whose 5\u2032- or 3\u2032-end was replaced by the respective region of the heterologous virus (Fig. 1E and F, p1b-2a and p2a-1b) were constructed. Huh-7 cells were transfected with these minigenomes together with the plasmid expressing HCV 1b- or 2a-derived NS proteins, pAM8-1, and Renilla luciferase activities were measured as fore-mentioned. Consistent with the results described above, replicase of HCV 1b and 2a accepted its respective minigenome as the template for synthesis of minus-strand RNA, and exchange of NS proteins between HCV1b- and 2a-derived minigenome systems also led to reporter gene expression (Fig. 4\n), implying that the replication complex is not strictly specific for the homologous RNA template. Deletion of the 5\u2032-end region in the minigenome fully abrogated its replication, both NS proteins from HCV 1b and 2a, however, could support the replication of chimeric minigenomes, suggesting that both RNA\u2013protein interaction between replicase and viral genome and long range RNA\u2013RNA interaction between 5\u2032- and 3\u2032-terminal sequence involved in HCV minus-strand RNA synthesis are functionally conserved between genotype 1b and 2a. Additionally, in all tested minigenomes, the NS proteins originated from HCV 1b constantly yielded higher levels of luciferase expression than that from 2a, suggesting that intrinsic differences in the replication capabilities of the replicase complex from different strains may exist. More likely, the superior capability of pNS3-51b in supporting the minigenomes replication may be attributable to the fact that the coding sequence in pNS3-51b was amplified from the replicon which harbors the adaptive mutations due to long-term culture, whereas the coding region in pNS3-52a was directly amplified from HCV 2a-infected serum.",

The rescue of synthetic minigenomes was achieved either through helper virus infection of minigenome-transfected cells with virus particles or through co-transfection of plasmids expressing viral proteins. For viruses of Flaviviridae family, however, a little has been reported in the development of similar approach except an in vitro replication system which utilizes cytoplasmic extracts from viral-infected cells and exogenous RNA template containing 5\u2032- and 3\u2032-terminal regions was described for dengue virus [17]. Together with those reported previously [13], the data shown here represent the first example of minigenome system for HCV, indicating that both the replicase complex supplied from replicating subgenomic replicon and that reconstituted by plasmid-encoded NS proteins are capable of supporting the replication of HCV minigenome.",

In addition to homologous minigenome, both HCV 1b- and 2a-derived replicase were able to accept the heterologous and chimeric minigenomes as the templates for synthesis of minus-strand RNA, indicating that the replicase-catalyzed RNA synthesis is not strictly strain- or genotype-specific.",

Our data presented here indicate that replication of the minigenome can be supported by trans-expressed NS proteins. One scenario may make these two different findings compatible: the cis-expressed, lethally mutated NS proteins may exert dominant negative effect in reconstituting replication complex, and thus interfere with the incorporation of trans-supplied NS proteins into a functional replication complex, which may account for the failure of NS proteins (other than NS5A) to trans-complement HCV RNA replication; however, such a dominant negative effect does not exist in the minigenome system described here because there is no NS protein expressed in cis, and trans-expressed NS proteins might be able to reconstitute the functional replication complex to support minigenome replication. Further experiments are now in progress to substantiate this assumption.",

The negative strand intermediates are postulated to exist as a dsRNA form. However, there is no direct evidence demonstrating this postulation in HCV, and whether there is free HCV-specific RNA of negative polarity in infected cells is still an issue to be elucidated. On the other hand, increasing evidence showed that the RNA in native replication intermediates of some positive strand RNA viruses is single-stranded. For example, in polio virus-infected cells, a careful electron microscope analysis using a membrane-permeable cross-linking reagent demonstrated that the native replication intermediate in vivo has a predominantly single-stranded backbone attached to several nascent RNA chains with few or no regions of extensive base-pairing, although deproteined (phenol-extracted) replication intermediate has a backbone mostly double-stranded [22]. More recently, Fujimura et al., reported that native replication intermediates of 20 S RNA virus have a single-stranded RNA backbone [23]. After completion of product-strand elongation, both the product and template strands are released from the replication complex as single-stranded RNA. The data presented here indicate that the minus strand RNA could serve as the mRNA for transgene expression, implying a similar scenario may also occur in HCV replication and minus strand RNA may be dissociated and present as a free single-strand form after RNA synthesis is completed.",

Recently, differential effect of a point mutation in the replicase gene on genome and minigenome replication was reported in coronavirus, emphasizing the need to use full-length genome to validate the replication signals obtained from minigenome system [24]. Nonetheless, the HCV minigenome system described here represents a useful tool for identification of cis- and trans-acting factors involved in viral replication while eliminating biosafety constraints required for work with infectious systems. Additionally, it will be of interest to explore whether the HCV minigenome can be packaged by additional provision of the viral structural protein in trans, and its success will not only further broaden the application of the HCV minigenome, but also facilitate the development of HCV-based gene delivery system.",
