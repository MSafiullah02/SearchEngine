This was demonstrated in 2003 by the epidemic of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in which 128 subjects were infected by a SARS patient who sat in the emergency department of a community hospital awaiting assignment to a hospital bed [1]. A simulated study showed that, due to the length of contact, the cross infection risk between health workers is greater than between patients or between patients and health workers [2]. To make matters worse, a hospital environment is widely contaminated by multidrug resistant organisms [3,4]. Therefore, it is critical to disinfect hospital environments to control cross infection.",
