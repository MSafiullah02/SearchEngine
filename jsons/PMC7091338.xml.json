Unlike classical reverse-genetics approaches such as the production of gene knockouts, RNAi-mediated cleavage of specific cellular RNAs permits loss-of-function experiments to be conducted for virtually any target on time-scales and at costs typically associated with standard cellular biology experiments. Increasingly, large libraries of chemically synthesized, double-stranded small-interfering RNAs (siRNAs) or transcribed short-hairpin RNAs (shRNAs) are employed in cellular models to interrogate relationships between each target in the library and the phenotypes in question, and such approaches are very likely to yield insights leading to the identification of novel therapeutic targets or modulators of key cellular processes [2]. RNAi has also been used extensively to confirm the activity of targeted gene products at the level of single genes and is now a commonly deployed research tool for precision biology.",

An area of active use of RNAi both for target discovery and potential therapeutic application involves attempts to block key steps in viral infection or pathogenesis, notably for RSV and HIV. Initial conventional therapeutic strategies focused on identifying viral factors that could be effectively targeted with small molecules [8, 9]. The low fidelity of viral replication has evidently resulted in rapid mutation of viral genome however, permitting viruses rapidly to develop drug-resistant mutants [10]. Therefore, increasing potential cellular target list beyond classically drugable targets through the use of RNAi-based therapeutics likely represents a new avenue for target selection.",

While most early studies had chosen viral targets for RNA interference, recent efforts have increasingly focused on RNAi-mediated inhibition of host cellular proteins required for viral infection due to the realization that a variety of viral responses substantially minimize siRNA effects. With the application of siRNA approaching, many new cellular targets relevant to HIV infection have been identified (Table 1). These newly identified cellular proteins offer great potential in the development of both siRNA and other types of drugs in the treatment of HIV infection. Several recent review papers provide comprehensive information regarding the potential of viral targets of siRNAs in inhibiting viral infections [9\u201312]. This article focuses on the therapeutic potential of RNAi against cellular targets of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, initially describing the disadvantages of viral targets and then introducing some of the cellular proteins that have been studied using siRNA approaches to combat viral infections.\n\n",

Early studies employing siRNA against viral infections mainly focused on viral genes. Nevertheless, the realization that there are divergent mechanisms for developing viral immunization from RNA interference led instead to the evaluation of cellular targets of viral infections. The identification of the physiological and pathological roles of cellular proteins that facilitate viral infections not only directly provides candidate targets for RNA interference, but also offers drug development targets for strategies such as antisense RNA, antibody, or other small molecules. As listed in Table 1, a large assortment of cellular proteins involved in viral entry into cells, viral RNA integration into the human genome, viral replication, viral packaging, and viral release, have been tested as potential targets for efficiently inhibiting HIV infection by siRNA technology (Fig. 1).\n\n",

In addition to confirming the involvement of furin in HIV replication, this screen revealed two novel cellular targets, Pak1 and Pak3. Overexpression of constitutively active Pak1 enhanced HIV IIIb infectivity while the knockdown of both targets decreased the amount of integrated HIV provirus.

By encoding silencing suppressors such as B2, NS1, VA1 RNA, and E3L, certain viruses can efficiently inhibit key components of the RNA silencing pathways [31\u201335]. Some suppressors can also regulate host gene expression. The second mechanism is silencing evasion. Silencing evasion could result from silencing-related ribonucleases that help to keep the viral genome away from siRNAs [36]. Another possibility for silencing evasion might be related to some viral genomes becoming intrinsically resistant to RNA degradation [37]. In contrast to the previous two mechanisms, the third mechanism called silencing immunizations requires a relatively short time adaptation and results in a rapid and widespread resistance mechanism against RNA interference. Although siRNA may be effective at the beginning, its effect can be progressively dampened by viral mutation at the target site. Alternatively, if a target site mutation is not tolerable for viral function the neighboring sequences can be mutated to change the secondary structure of the target region and thereby enable it to escape siRNA-triggered degradation [38\u201341].",

These mechanisms include the suppression of RNA interference, evasion of RNA silencing, and immunity from or resistance to RNA silencing. Either the expression of certain viral genes or mutation of the silencing targets can enable viruses to replicate under RNA silencing pressure. The recognition of viral resistance to RNAi prompted strategies in evaluation of cellular co-factors required for HIV infection. In contrast to viral targets, RNAi against cellular targets may provide a more persistent inhibition to viral infection. In order to overcome the high mutation rate of HIV, recent efforts in screening new cellular targets of RNA interference show promises in viral replication. At the in vitro cultured cell level, many promising cellular targets pertinent to HIV infection have been validated. Further evaluation of these cellular targets by knockdown technologies may pave a new avenue for viral therapy as well as provide leads for the development of other small molecule therapeutic agents. Finally, RNA interference can be used to quickly screen the potential synergistic effect of knockdown of more than one cellular target in inhibiting HIV replication. This is important as it may substantially minimize cellular toxicity and enhance its effects against HIV replication. In addition to different host genes in CD4 cells, targeting to different cellular genes at different cells may be of importance. For example, simultaneous knockdown of DCs express the DC-specific intercellular adhesion molecule 3-grabbing nonintegrin (DC-SIGN) receptor in immature dendritic cells (DCs) and CCR5 is expected to work synergistically.",

Martinez et al. demonstrated that the inhibitory effects of RNAi directed against CXCR4 was detectable 48 h after transfection of CXCR4 positive U87-CD4 positive cells [46]. Similar observations from Ji et al. [47], Lee et al. [48], and Anderson and Akkina [49] also confirmed that RNAi may be used to block HIV entry and replication. In addition to targeting CXCR4 and CCR5 separately, dual specific short-hairpin siRNA constructs containing an 8-nucleotide intervening spacer, targeted against either CXCR4 and CD4 or CCR5 and CXCR4 were also evaluated. Cleavage of the bispecific constructs to yield monospecific siRNAs was shown to occur in cell extracts [50].",

DCs express the DC-specific intercellular adhesion molecule 3-grabbing nonintegrin (DC-SIGN) receptor and the T-cell suppressing factor indolamine-2,3-dioxygenase (IDO). These factors capture small amounts of HIV-1 found on mucosal surfaces and spread the viral infection to CD4(+) T cells. Arrighi et al. developed shRNA-expressing lentiviral vectors capable of conditionally suppressing DC-SIGN expression [51]. As expected, suppression of DC-SIGN expression inhibited the attachment of the HIV-1 gp120 envelope glycoprotein to DC-SIGN transfectants, as well as transfer of HIV-1 to target cells in trans. Epidemiological evidence has demonstrated the high risk of cocaine abuse and HIV infection. Recent experimental data show that cocaine up-regulates DC-SIGN among other genes, further supporting the therapeutic value of targeting DC-SIGN to inhibit HIV infection [52]. Moreover, DC-SIGN has already been employed in the development of other types of therapeutic agents (Table 1).",

However, a similar study reported by Zielske and Stevenson concluded that importin 7 might be dispensable for infection in natural, non-dividing targets of HIV-1 and simian immunodeficiency virus such as primary macrophage and Hela cells [56]. Although many cellular proteins are crucial for HIV nuclear import, the co-factor effect of importin 7 is not conclusively validated.

Although single-cycle infection analysis in cell lines led to questions about the overall importance of p75 in the viral life cycle [4, 8, 10\u201313], Llano et al. in a study with intensified RNA interference and dominant-negative protein approaches revealed an essential role for LEDGF/p75 in HIV integration [58].

HIV assembly can be inhibited by blocking Rab9, a cellular protein with its effectors in facilitating vesicular transport by tethering donor vesicles to their respective target membranes. Using siRNA to silence Rab9 expression before viral infection, Murray et al. examined the role of Rab9 in the life cycles of HIV and several unrelated viruses [73]. They observed a wide spectrum of viral replication inhibition by silencing Rab9 expression including the enveloped Ebola, Marburg, and measles viruses in addition to HIV.

Selective knockdown of hSpt5 led to significant decreases in Tat transactivation and concomitant inhibition of HIV-1 replication, indicating that hSpt5 was required for mediating Tat transactivation and HIV-1 replication. A similar phenomenon was observed with human positive transcription elongation factor, P-TEFb, a factor composed of two subunits, cyclin T1 (hCycT1) and Cdk9, that is involved in transcriptional regulation of cellular genes as well as HIV-1 mRNA. Chiu et al. showed that RNAi-mediated gene silencing of P-TEFb in HeLa cells was not lethal and inhibited Tat transactivation to activate elongation of RNA polymerase II and HIV-1 replication in host cells, suggesting that there is a critical threshold concentration of activated P-TEFb required for cell viability and HIV replication [80].

Although no siRNA-based drug has yet been FDA approved, Vitvarene, an antisense drug against CMV retinitis, has been FDA-approved and successfully marketed. It is reasonable to speculate that many more RNA drugs treating human disease including viral infection, either antisense RNA or siRNA-based, will be approved in the future. Presently, there are only a limited number of drugs or leads under clinical trials, however, RNAi is so far the most powerful tool in identifying viral or cellular targets possessing therapeutic potentials. These targets help to better understand the biology of HIV replication within human cells, and provide therapeutic targets for the development of chemically synthesized small molecular drugs. The latter allows maximization of the advantages of chemical synthesized small drugs: easy to deliver and longer in vivo half-life. Therefore, significant shortening of target identification by RNA interference has great impact in the fight against HIV infection. Another major advantage of using siRNA/shRNA to treat viral infections such as HIV infection is the relative ease of design for the candidate leads, rapid evaluation for in vitro testing, and most importantly the large collection of siRNA/shRNA libraries for high throughput screening of novel targets as shown in Table 2. siRNA/shRNA has precious value in fighting HIV infection as RNA interference facilitates the understanding of the biology of HIV replication, offers efficient identification of therapeutic targets, and can be drug leads themselves. Among these multiple impacts, host genes required for HIV replication may play a crucial role in the efforts of obtaining an optional control for HIV infection, such as the combination of drugs of several cellular targets or the combination of siRNA/shRNA drugs together with other drugs against cellular or cellular and viral targets.",

            "text": "The recognition of RNA interference has caused a revolutionary change in genetic research and in drug target screening. The utility of RNAi for target discovery has been well established both at transcriptional and post-transcriptional levels. For example, there is no difficulty in applying RNA interference to the screening of some particular targets such as proteins lacking small molecule binding activities or non-coding RNAs. As discussed earlier, one of the immediate biomedical benefits of using siRNA/shRNA is the significant shortening of time required for drug target screening. However, for siRNA/shRNA to be therapeutic agents in treating viral infection, much has been done to overcome the aforementioned restraints, particularly the inefficient delivery of nucleotide-derived agents in vivo. Substantial progress in improving the efficiency of siRNA/shRNA delivery will also benefit other nucleotide-based agents such as ribozyme and antisense oligonucleotides.",
