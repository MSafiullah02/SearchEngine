Located in southern China, this province has\nbeen the site of a number of outbreaks of novel human infections,\nincluding Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and highly pathogenic\navian H5N1 influenza A virus, leading some scientists to refer to this\nregion as an epicenter of pandemic influenza viruses (Shortridge et al., 2003).\nIn recent years, a variety of novel avian and swine influenza viruses\nhave been detected in poultry and pigs in Guangdong (Kong et al., 2011a, Su et al., 2012b, Su et al., 2012c). An avian-like H7N9 influenza strain,\nfirst detected in March 2013 (Gao et al., 2013), has silently spread among poultry\nflocks in at least ten of China\u2019s provinces and causes rapidly\nprogressive lower respiratory tract infections in humans. As of January\n19, 2015 this novel reassortant avian influenza A virus H7N9 had affected\n500 patients with a case-fatality rate of over 30% (as reported by the\nNational Health and Family Planning Commission of the People's Republic\nof China).",

Occupational exposure was defined as working at more than\n5 h per day in close proximity (less than\n1 m) to pigs, poultry, or dogs. Only individuals\nwith animal exposure for more than 3 months (90 days) were included in\nthe exposure groups. 264 volunteers with no occupational animal\nexposure, no house pets were selected from healthy individuals\nvisiting the Third Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-Sen University in\nGuangdong for a physical examination during the same time period in\nwhich exposed individuals were enrolled were chosen as control group.\nAll participants never got flu vaccine and provided written informed\nconsent.",

Among the avian viruses,\nA/duck/Anhui/1/2006(H5N1) (AV/H5N1) belongs to the 2.3.4 clade which\ncirculated in mainland of China in recent years (Jiang et al., 2010, Li et al., 2010, Smith et al., 2009b).\nA/Chicken/Shanghai/10/2001(H9N2) (AV/H9N2),\nA/Chicken/Beijing/1/1994-like strain is one of the most prevalent\ninfluenza viruses circulating among poultry in southern China today\n(Choi et al., 2004, Chu et al., 2011, Xu et al., 2007, Zhou et al., 2015). The\ngenome of A/pigeon/Shanghai/S1421/2013(H7N9) (AV/H7N9) is similar to\nthe virus which caused the fatal human infection in eastern China at\nthe beginning of 2013, and into 2014 (Zhang et al., 2013). Among the swine\nviruses, A/swine/Guangdong/L6/2009(H1N1) (CS/H1N1) is a wholly classic\nswine H1N1 virus, representative of the overall phylogenetic lineage\nof viruses that have circulated among pigs in south China at least 10\nyears (Chen et al., 2013, Kong et al., 2011b).\nA/swine/Guangdong/SS1/2012(H1N1) (EA/H1N1) is a Eurasian avian-like\nswine influenza A virus H1N1 swine virus representative of the viruses\nthat have recently appeared among swine in south China (Chen et al., 2013).\nA/swine/Guangxi/13/2006(H1N2)(CS/H1N2) is a H1N2 swine influenza virus\nisolated from lung tissue of a pig in Guangxi province, China\n(Chen et al.,\n2008). Genes from A/Guangdong/1057/2010(H1N1)\n(Pdm09/H1N1) are very similar to the influenza A (H1N1)/pdm09 virus\nlineage which is representative of A/California/7/2009(H1N1) (data\nunpublished). A/New Caledonia/20/99(H1N1), an antigenic variant of\nBeijing/262/95, was first reported in New Caledonia in the Southern\nPacific (Daum et al.,\n2002). A/Brisbane/10/2007(H3N2), another seasonal\ninfluenza H3N2 virus was first found in Brisbane. The canine virus,\nA/canine/Guangdong/2/2011(H3N2) (CAN/H3N2) is a virus which is\ngenetically similar to the avian influenza virus subtype H3N2 found\nrecently circulating in dogs and cats in Guangdong province\n(Su et al.,\n2012a). All the avian influenza virus reference\nstrains were inactivated and kindly supplied by the Harbin Veterinary\nResearch Institute (Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Harbin,\nChina) (as indicated in Table 1). The swine influenza virus reference\nstrains (CS/H1N1, EA/H1N1), human (Pdm09/H1N1) influenza virus and\ncanine (CAN/H3N2) influenza virus were isolated and kept by the\nCollege of Veterinary Medicine, South China Agricultural University\n(as indicated in Table\n1).",

Secondly, all participants reported no receipt of human influenza\nvaccination. Including some vaccinated individuals would allow for\nadditional statistical analyses. Additional serological tests would also\nstrengthen the detection of antibodies to specific viruses. As we assay\nmainly detected antibodies against the hemagglutinin receptor, without\nassessing reactivity to neuraminidase, we cannot exclude the possibility\nthat participants were seroreactive to other viruses with identical\nhemagglutinins. Also, wider inclusion of reference virus strains would\nexpand our serological search for zoonotic influenza virus\nsubtypes.",

Frequent use of disinfectants\nwithin LPM and as delivery trucks enter and exit the facilities could\nreduce transmission of influenza viruses. Our results further underline\nthe risk persons with occupational animal exposure are at, and we thus\nrecommend expanding utilization of personal protective equipment and\nannual influenza vaccination in this population.
