The detection of specific DNA sequences, DNA damage and DNA\u2010anticancer drug interactions have been the hot topics of all times since they are directly related to human health 1, 2, 3, 4. They have found many applications in medicine, pharmacy, molecular biology, environmental monitoring and food safety. In particular, detection of specific DNA sequences is great importance for the diagnosis of diseases, genomic sequencing and pathogen identification 5, 6, 7, 8. There are several ways of detecting DNA and monitoring DNA\u2010related studies, such as polymerase chain reaction (PCR)\u2010based, spectroscopy\u2010based or biosensor\u2010based 9, 10, 11, 12, 13. Among these techniques, DNA biosensors constitute an important place due to their advantage of recognizing base pairs efficiently in shorter time values compared to laborious classical methods. Biosensors that use electrochemical transducers have been used commonly in order to construct sensitive, selective, inexpensive, rapid, simple and miniaturized biosensing platforms 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19.",

In this context, Prof. Joseph Wang's group have made significant contributions to the electrochemical DNA biosensors. For example, Wang et al. have used electrochemical stripping detection of colloidal gold tag for DNA hybridization at single\u2010use thick film carbon electrodes 20. In their study, magnetic bead\u2010linked oligonucleotide probe and target hybridization have been followed by binding of streptavidin\u2010coated metal nanoparticles to the captured DNA and dissolution of gold. Another remarkable study has been performed using a ternary monolayer involving hexanedithiol (HDT) co\u2010immobilized with a thiolated capture probe on gold surfaces by Campuzano et al. 21. 6\u2010mercapto\u20101\u2010hexanol (MCH) has been used as the diluent of the ternary monolayer. This ternary monolayer has presented a quantification of target DNA down to 7 pM and 17 pM in untreated serum and urine samples, respectively. Then, Kuralay et al. have used this ternary monolayer approach at screen\u2010printed gold electrodes (Au/SPEs) 22. A quantification of target DNA down to 25 pM and 100 pM in untreated serum and urine samples have been obtained, respectively.",

            "text": "Electroactive polymers (or electropolymerized films) can be effectively used in various areas, such as nanotechnology and biotechnology. They have attracted great attention in DNA sensing because of their availability of forming roboust, uniform and biocompatible surfaces having charges or their own functional groups which make them very convenient for biomolecule immobilization 23, 24, 25, 26. Besides these advantages, many of them have good conductivities, porous structures and high electroactive surface areas. Their easy preparation is commonly rely on the electrochemical oxidation of their monomers in the presence of a dopant molecule 27, 28, 29, 30. Gu et al. have fabricated polyaniline/polyacrylate (PANI/PAA)\u2010modified boron\u2010doped diamond electrode for electrochemical impedance sensing of DNA hydridization 31. The electrode has presented a detection limit of 2\u00d710\u22128 M. Another DNA biosensor with polyethylene glycolylated (PEGylated) PANI has been constructed by Hui et al. 32. The biosensor has exhibited a response to breast cancer susceptibility gene (BRCA1) with a linear range from 0.01 pM to 1 nM. Prof. Joseph Wang's group have electropolymerized polypyrrole (PPy) in the presence of nucleic acid probes as the dopant molecules. The probes have served as the sole counter anion during the electropolymerization and maintained their hybridization activity 33. Jiang and Wang have also demonstrated a genoelectronic route for discriminating between short oligonucleotides and chromosomal DNA. This route has been depended on the electropolymeric growth of PPy. The response of system has found proportional to the concentration of the oligonucleotide dopant 34. Peptide modified poly(3,4\u2010ethylenedioxythiophene) (PEDOT) coated glassy carbon electrode (GCE) has been used for BRCA1 detection and a detection limit of 0.03 fM has been found. The biosensor has exhibited a satisfying accuracy and low fouling in 5 % (v/v) human plasma 35.",

            "text": "In the present work, we describe the preparation of poly\u2010L\u2010lysine coated pencil graphite electrodes (PLL/PGEs) and use of them for ultrasensitive DNA hybridization detection. PLL is an attractive surface for biosensing applications due to its biocompability and positively/negatively charged groups 36, 37. For example, Shan et al. have been used graphene sheets functionalized with poly\u2010L\u2010lysine for the detection of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) 38. There have been few attempts on DNA sensing based on PLL. Jiang et al. have been presented an electrochemical biosensor with poly\u2010L\u2010lysine/single walled carbon nanotubes for EIS detection of PAT gene fragment and PCR amplification of NOS gene 39. Carboxylic group\u2010functionalized single\u2010walled carbon nanotubes (SWNTs) have been dropped onto the carbon paste electrode (CPE) and then PLL films have been electropolymerized by cyclic voltammetry (CV). The detection limit has been 3.1\u00d710\u221213 M using electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). Another DNA biosensor based on functionalized graphene oxide and poly\u2010L\u2010lysine modified glassy carbon electrode (GCE) has been constructed by Sun et al. for the detection of tlh gene sequence related to vibrio parahaemolyticus 40. PLL films have been electropolymerized by cyclic voltammetry (CV) and functionalized graphene modification has been performed subsequently by dropping onto the coated electrode. Hybridization event has been monitored with methylene blue. The detection limit has been found as 1.69\u00d710\u221213 M. A genesensor to detect severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) virus has been prepared on poly\u2010L\u2010ysine modified screen\u2010printed carbon electrodes (SPCEs) 41. Enzyme catalyzed hydrolysis of the 3\u2010indoxyl phosphate (3\u2010IP) to indigo has been monitored by cyclic voltammetry. In the second part, the target has been labeled using an Au (I) complex. The detection limits have been found as 8 pM and 0.5 nM, respectively. In our study, we present a simple protocol based on the electropolymerization of L\u2010lysine onto disposable pencil graphite electrodes (PLL/PGEs) by cyclic voltammetry. PLL/PGEs were prepared using various cyclic scans (5, 10 and 15 cycles) in order to investigate the effect of polymeric film thickness on the electrochemical response of the coated electrode. The response of the coated surface was also compared with the response of the uncoated electrode for double\u2010stranded DNA (dsDNA) detection. Improved results were obtained with the coated one. Thus, we used the coated electrode in DNA hybridization sensing in 1 : 1 diluted serum samples. According to our knowledge, this is the first to fabricate PLL coated pencil graphite surfaces and to present their application as DNA biosensor in serum samples. The hybridization step didn't require any indicator step and oxidation signals of guanine (G) was used, directly. The prepared electrode presented a sensitive and selective response towards label\u2010free DNA detection. Besides this, herein we fabricated poly\u2010L\u2010lysine/graphene (PLL/GN) and poly\u2010L\u2010lysine/multi\u2010walled carbon nanotubes (PLL/MWCNTs) nanocomposites coated PGEs. The electroactive polymer/nanomaterials\u2010based nanocomposites coated surfaces have attracted great attention for different applications 4. This is the first to demonstrate one\u2010pot, rapid, robust and easy fabrication of polyamino acids/nanomaterials composites coated disposable surfaces in the literature. Electrochemical polymerization was performed with L\u2010lysine monomer in the presence of graphene or multi\u2010walled carbon nanotubes onto the PGEs. Electrochemical characterization was performed and also the response of the coated electrodes for DNA biosensing was compared.",

Electrochemical polymerization was performed with L\u2010lysine monomer in the presence of graphene (GN) or multi\u2010walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) onto the PGEs using 5 cyclic scans. Figure 5a\u2010d present the electrochemical behaviors of PLL/GN/PGE, PLL/MWCNTs/PGE, PLL/PGE and bare PGE in 0.1 M KCl solution containing 5 mM Fe(CN)6\n3\u2212/4, respectively. As seen from these cyclic voltammetric behaviors all coated electrodes exhibited very good electrochemical responses compared to the bare electrode. In addition, SI Table 2 summarizes the anodic/cathodic peak potentials (Epa/Epc) and the anodic/cathodic peak currents (Ipa/Ipc). According to these results, the reversibility of the electrodes were better in the presence of graphene or multi\u2010walled carbon nanotubes as expected. The best performance was obtained with the PLL/GN/PGE. The results emphasized the catalytical effect of nanomaterials on the electrode material.

The outer layer of the electrode serves as a positively/negatively charged surface in order to bind DNA electrostatically. The electropolymerization condition was kept as 5 cycles of polymerization since the PLL coated electrode showed the best electrochemical response at this working condition. Firstly, the advantage of the coated electrodes was presented by using them in 100 mg L\u22121 dsDNA solution. In Figure 6A\u2010a to d, differential pulse voltammograms (DPVs) of PLL/GN/PGE, PLL/MWCNTs/PGE, PPL/PGE and uncoated PGE in dsDNA solution prepared in acetate buffer (pH 4.8) were overlaid. As seen from these DPVs, electroactive 4 DNA bases (guanine (G), adenine (A), thymine (T), cytosine (C), respectively) were able to be differentiated in a good seperation in the same current scale by using PLL/GN/PGE, PLL/MWCNTs/PGE and PLL/PGE. PLL/GN/PGE, PLL/MWCNTs/PGE and PLL/PGE exhibited almost the same behavior. The separations of adenine (A) and thymine (T) were slightly more sensitive by using the PLL/GN/PGE and there was also a catalytic effect in parallel to our cyclic voltammetric results with the PLL/GN/PGE and PLL/MWCNTs/PGE. However, there was no clear seperation of the DNA bases using uncoated PGE and the peak currents were in a lower current values compared to the ones obtained with PLL\u2010based electrodes. These results signified the use of PLL\u2010based surfaces for DNA biosensing. Then, the usability of PLL/PGE electrode was presented in human serum which was diluted with acetate buffer (pH 4.8) in 1 : 1 ratio. The experiments for %100 serum sample for the differentiation of DNA bases was also performed. However, the sensitivity was poor in these results. Figure 6B\u2010a illustrates the DPV of PLL/PGE in 100 mg L\u22121 dsDNA solution prepared in acetate buffer (pH 4.8) and Figure 6B\u2010b illustrates the DPV of PLL/PGE in 100 mg L\u22121 dsDNA solution prepared in serum. The results were in a good aggrement to prove the usability of PLL/PGE in real samples. Thus, the PLL/PGEs can be good candidates for further clinical applications.\n",
