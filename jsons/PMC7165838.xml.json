Such weather factors may be possible elements in the prediction of infectious disease transmission, including mosquito and rodent\u2010borne diseases, respiratory infections,\n5\n, \n6\n, \n7\n, \n8\n, \n9\n and more recently, SARS transmission.\n10\n, \n11\n, \n12\n, \n13\n In developing emergency plans to contain the spread, transmission and resurgence as well as to prevent further international spread of new communicable diseases including SARS, it is important to set up early warning systems, using practical indices as markers for infectious disease transmission dynamics. These indices include pathogen infectivity, contact degree and frequency, population immunity and environmental factors. The use of weather variables may provide an additional potential tool for such projection. Given the need to remain vigilant about SARS worldwide, and the resurgence of the disease in late May 2003 in Toronto\n14\n and 2004 in Beijing,\n15\n the study of the association of weather to SARS transmission is timely. This paper quantifies the relationship between weather variables and the number of cases of SARS occurring on a daily basis in the epidemic of 2003 in Beijing and Hong Kong.",

Therefore, transmission may be heterogeneous.

The cluster of SARS cases in Toronto health\u2010care workers after the intubation of a patient,\n22\n as well as other reported super\u2010spreader events, suggest the possibility of limited airborne transmission under certain circumstances.\n23\n These circumstances may be enhanced by weather conditions.",

However, weather may play an important role in SARS transmission as an environmental factor at the first stage, that is, transmission in the community. Therefore, it would be ideal to distinguish nosocomial infections from non\u2010nosocomial infections and to study the correlations with weather and non\u2010nosocomial infections alone.
