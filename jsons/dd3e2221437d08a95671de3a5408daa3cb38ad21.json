Figure 6.2 shows some consequences of indiscriminate biomedical waste generation. The hazardous nature of the biomedical waste is due to the following: (1) infection, (2) genotoxicity (deleterious action on genetic material of cell affecting its integrity), (3) toxicity, (4) exposure to radioactivity, (5) injury.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Significance"}, {"text": "In many countries a number of contaminated waste materials like cotton, syringes, sharps re-enter the market either in the same or an altered form. Infected cotton may be used for making ear buds and toys. Syringes from waste are often repacked and sold as new packs. 1, 6.2, 6.3 and 6.4 give examples of pathogens that are present in some typical biomedical wastes. Presence of the pathogens in substantial quantities would spread disease through air, water, food, vectors, rodents, touching, etc. Needle injury will result in sero-conversion (development of specific antibodies to microbes in the blood serum due to infection or immunization) with respect to Hepatitis C (HCV) and Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Substitute products with less or non-hazardous materials or using technologies that generate less toxic/volume of waste (like precapsulated amalgam, non-hazardous biodegradable detergents, digital radiography, mercury free restorations, steam sterilization, X-ray system cleaners without chromium, etc.) would definitely help degradation of environment. Materials such as zinc, mercury, silver from amalgam and X-ray fixer and lead from film backing can be reclaimed/ recycled using appropriate method. Figure 6 .3 shows a schematic diagram depicting a infection cycle with respect to biomedical waste. Many studies have proven that virus can survive in water for 9-10 months at 8\u00b0C (Anthony and Elizabeth 1981) . In fact pathogen life span varies widely. For example, Feline influenza (cat influenza) caused by Herpes Virus can stay in the environment for a day whereas Calici virus can stay alive for 8-10 days in the environment. Parvovirus which is responsible for Feline infectious enteritis can live on for 12 months in the environment. Fline leukaemea virus and Feline immunodeficiency virus die within hours once they are outside the host. Fline infectious peritonis can live up to seven days in cat litter (WFC 2011). (Findhauser 2003) . Nearly 40 % of these deaths were due to respiratory infections and diarrhoeal diseases. Existing drugs and vaccines, as well as providing access to good food and water, could have prevented much of these deaths. The number of emerging pathogens has increased over the last 40 years. Six viral pathogens, were discovered in the 1970s, and in the 1980s, this number rose to seven, which included HIV. In the 1990s, the number rose to 20 which included hepatitis E, F and G, as well as the West Nile encephalitis virus (Desselberger 2003) .
