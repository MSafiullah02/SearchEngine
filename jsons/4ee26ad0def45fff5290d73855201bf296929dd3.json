We performed a monocentric cross-sectional study describing the clinical course of COVID-19 in a cohort of patients from northern Italy treated with calcineurin-inhibitors for organ transplantation or rheumatic diseases. Data were collected by phone call and clinical chart review between March 27 th -31 st 2020. COVID-19 related symptoms, rynopharingeal swab, therapeutic changes and outcome were assessed in 384 consecutive patients (57% males; median age 61 years, IQR 48-69). 331 patients (86%) received solid organ transplantation (kidney n=140, 36%, heart n=100, 26%, lung n=91, 24%) and 53 (14%) had a rheumatic disease. Calcineurin inhibitors were the only immunosuppressant administered in 46 patients (12%). 14 patients developed a \"confirmed COVID-19\" (swab positivity) and 14 a \"clinical COVID-19\" (only typical symptoms). Fever (75%) and diarrhoea (50%) were the most common symptoms. Fourteen patients were hospitalized and 11 have already been dismissed. No patient required start/changes of the O2 therapy or developed superinfection. Only one patient, with metastatic lung cancer, died. In conclusion, COVID-19 showed a mild course in our cohort, with low mortality. Calcineurin inhibitor-based immunosuppressive regimens appear safe in this context and should not be discontinued.",

            "text": "Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) has been first reported in China in 2019 and it is related to a new strain of coronavirus, called \"Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2\" (SARS-CoV-2)(1). Similarly to 2003 SARS-CoV and \"Middle-East Respiratory Syndrome\" coronavirus (MERS) (2), SARS-CoV-2 severely affects the lungs and COVID-19 patients are at increased risk of developing an acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) which is often fatal (3) . In February 2020, the COVID-19 affected Northern Italy regions, determining a high number of hospitalization and intensive care unit admission (4) . The two Italian Regions with the highest prevalence are Lombardy and Emilia-Romagna. According to data released by our National Istituto Superiore di Sanit\u00e0, on 03.31.2020 the incidence of COVID-19 infection in these two regions was higher than 100 symptomatic cases/100.000 inhabitants. At that time point, 54.036 confirmed cases had already been reported in Lombardy and Emilia Romagna. Furthermore, among the reported symptomatic cases, the 21.3% had a severe presentation of the disease and 3% of patients required intensive cares for respiratory impairment. However, testing and/or reporting strategies varied among Italian regions and this might have led to an underestimation of pauci-symptomatic patients and therefore of the real incidence of COVID-19 infection (5). After the outbreak began, the medical community started having concerns about an increased potential risk of infection in patients on immunosuppressive therapy, even if some preliminary case reports showed a mild disease course in this category of patients (6) (7) (8) (9) . On the other hand, immunosuppressive treatments are being studied as possible therapeutic options in the hyperinflammatory phase of the COVID-19 (10) . Among the immunosuppressants (ISs), calcineurin inhibitors (CNIs) such as cyclosporine (Cys) and tacrolimus (TAC), which are currently used in the setting of transplantation (11) and Rheumatic Disorders (RMDs) (12) , are supposed to exert also an antiviral activity.",

Patients referred to the Units of Rheumatology, Respiratory diseases, Nephrology and Cardiac surgery of our Hospital. We selected patients from Northern Italian regions first interested by SARS-CoV-2 infection (Lombardy, Emilia-Romagna, Piedmont and Veneto). The included patients were followed up for RMDs such as antisynthetase syndrome (ASSD), idiopathic inflammatory myopathies (IIMS), systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), Adult onset Still disease (AOSD) and for Solid Organ transplantation (eg heart, lung and kidney). All patients agreed to participate in this interview and provided the informed consent as approved by our IRB. We carried-out a pre-established phone survey aimed at investigating the occurrence of symptoms and laboratory/radiology findings possibly related to SARS-CoV-2 infection during the 30 days preceding the contact and at identifying patients diagnosed with COVID-19. Data collection for the patients admitted to our Hospital was performed by direct interview and clinical chart review. We assessed the following variables: fever (higher than 37.5 \u00b0 C), persistent rhinorrhoea, ageusia, anosmia, headache, nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, dyspnoea, cough, sore throat, fatigue, arthromyalgias, current treatments, contact with diagnosed COVID-19 cases and, if available, laboratory (C-reactive protein, Lactate dehydrogenase, hypocalcemia, lymphopenia) and chest X-rays results. We retrieved also the most recent CNIs blood basal levels, the time passed from symptoms onset, the occurrence of hospitalizations, with related clinical files, and the final-outcome, defined as: full-recovery, improvement (partial relief from symptoms), not improvement (symptoms unchanged), worsening (onset of new symptoms or worsening of existing ones), death. Data regarding ongoing treatments and changes in the immunosuppressive regimen were also acquired. In patients admitted at our Hospital with SARS-CoV-2 related lung involvement, we assessed serum interleukin-6 (IL-6) by ELISA, high sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) by ADVIA Chemistry XPT system and collected all clinical files. Patients were diagnosed with \"confirmed COVID-19\" in case of rhinopharyngeal swab positivity for SARS-CoV-2. In the absence of rhinopharyngeal swab, we considered a diagnosis of \"clinical COVID-19\" if: 1) at least 4 typical clinical/laboratory/radiology findings were present; All rights reserved.

Most patients enclosed received a solid organ transplantation (kidney n=140, 36%, heart n=100, 26%, lung n=91, 24%), while 53 patients (14%) suffered from RMDs: 42 patients had ASSD with interstitial lung disease (ILD) (11%), 2 had IIMs (4%) , 6 had SLE (12%) and 3 had AOSD (6%). Overall characteristics of the patients enrolled in the study are reported in table 1, while geographic area of referral of the cohort and of the control group is reported in figure 1. All patients followed the national rules about isolation established by our Government since late February 2020 and subsequent updates.

In fact, although hs-CRP levels were similar between confirmed COVID-19 with and without immunosuppression, IL-6 levels were much lower in the immunosuppressed group, in line with this hypothesis. 3) we cannot exclude a direct antiviral activity of some of the ISs used. Both Cys and TAC inhibit viral replication in a number of strains of CoV, including SARS-CoV, through the inhibition of peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerases, such as cyclophilin A and FK506-binding proteins, that are cellular interaction partners of CoV non-structural protein 1 (Nsp1) (13) (14) (15) . If we hypothesize that Cys and TAC exert antiviral activity also towards SARS-CoV-2, we may suppose an added value of CNIs with respect to pure ISs, because theoretically able to reduce the viral load or the risk of viral load increase. On this basis, it is reasonable to add also CNIs in the list of ISs possible therapeutic options for COVID-19 (18) .",

Indeed, we cannot exclude that some of the contacted asymptomatic patients could develop the disease in the next days or weeks or that some of the patients could worsen or die subsequently. Second, we assessed most patients only by a phone-call, without a direct visit due to the established quarantine and only a few patients had recent blood tests available, which probably resulted in missing some asymptomatic cases. Third, the definition of clinical COVID19 may be matter of discussion.",

Indeed, during the period of our observation, no immunosuppressed COVID-19 patients had generally been admitted to our Hospital with a more compromised respiratory picture compared to our cohort. The reason is that all admitted patients belonging to our cohort were solid organ transplanted and admitted mainly for fever and diarrhoea, and not for respiratory symptoms.",

Furthermore, it is important to underline that no patient developed infectious complication. Substantially, CNIs based chronic immunosuppressive regimens do not increase the risk of a more severe course of COVID-19 or complications. Our result indicates the need of a careful discussion on the effect of immunosuppression on COVID-19. The substantial lack of ARDS in our cohort may also suggest a protective action of immunosuppression in these patients, at least for one of the most dreadful complications of the disease. This might be especially true in the case of CNIs, which, besides their action on immune system, could also exert an antiviral action on coronavirus.",
