The cellular chymotrypsin-like enzymes invariantly employ a canonical catalytic Ser-His-Asp triad (Hedstrom, 2002; Polgar, 2005) and have evolved, by duplication and diversification, a large spectrum of substrate specificities facilitating their diverse roles in many biological processes. Likewise, RNA viruses with single-stranded RNA genomes of positive polarity (ssRNA + viruses) often employ chymotrypsin-like enzymes to control genome expression and remodel host cell functions by targeting different proteins.",

In contrast to cellular and other viral homologs, these enzymes uniquely diversified the principal catalytic nucleophile residue to employ either the canonical Ser or an unconventional Cys (depending on the virus lineage) (Bazan and Fletterick, 1988; Gorbalenya et al., 1986, 1989a; Malcolm, 1995), while (somewhat counterintuitively) sharing a conserved narrow substrate specificity. In those proteases that employ Cys as the principal nucleophile, the catalytic Asp may be replaced with another residue, either another acidic residue (Glu) (Matthews et al., 1994; Mosimann et al., 1997) or a residue with a side chain that has little or no similarity to that of Asp, further reflecting the pronounced sequence divergence of many ssRNA + virus proteases from their cellular homologs (Gorbalenya and Snijder, 1996). Probably, these replacements have evolved due to the exceptionally large mutation space that RNA viruses of this lineage explored in the course of their evolution (Lauber et al., 2013) and have been fixed to meet the distinct requirements for Ser and Cys residues in mediating the nucleophilic attack during catalysis (McGrath et al., 1989).",

These substrate residues are accommodated in a protease substrate pocket that generally includes a highly conserved His residue (which differs from the catalytic His) and another residue, often Ser or Thr, which together define the S1 subsite homologous to that of cellular chymotrypsin-like proteases (Bazan and Fletterick, 1988; Gorbalenya et al., 1989a).

The individual proteins are released by the 3C/3CLpro in both cis- and trans-cleavage reactions, thereby regulating the formation of viral replication complexes in a timely coordinated manner. In addition, some 3C/3CLpros may mediate the processing of capsid polyproteins to generate the proteins required for virus particle formation as well as cleaving cellular proteins to facilitate virus reproduction. Viruses encoding 3C/3CLpros belong to two large monophyletic orders, the Picornavirales (which infect uni- and multicellular eukaryotes) and the Nidovirales (which infect vertebrates and invertebrates), but also include several other virus families or groups, such as the plant Potyviridae and Sobemovirus, and the vertebrate Caliciviridae and Astroviridae, displaying more distant affinities to one of these two virus orders. Over the past years, our appreciation of the natural 3C/3CLpro diversity and conservation of specific residues has been steadily improved by comparative genomics, while our understanding of the roles and properties of these proteases in viral replication was largely based on just a few viruses of the above taxa, with a strong focus on viruses that (may) infect humans. Specifically, the structural characterization of 3C/3CLpros remained limited to those encoded by several mammalian viruses and one avian virus of the Picornaviridae, Coronaviridae, Arteriviridae, Caliciviridae, and Astroviridae, and plant Potyviridae and Sobemovirus (Matthews et al., 1994; Banerjee et al., 2018; Phan et al., 2002; Nunn et al., 2005; Speroni et al., 2009; Gayathri et al., 2006; Damalanka et al., 2018; Weerawarna et al., 2016; Galasiti Kankanamalage et al., 2017; Takahashi et al., 2013; Kim et al., 2012; Muhaxhiri et al., 2013; Allaire et al., 1994; Anand et al., 2002, 2003; Bergmann et al., 1997; Xue et al., 2008; Yang et al., 2003; Barrette-Ng et al., 2002). All these proteases have substrate specificities that are critically determined by the P1 position.",

            "text": "In this study, we sought to address these knowledge gaps by determining the structure of a 3CLpro encoded by Cavally virus, an invertebrate nidovirus. The protease of this virus represents family C107 in the PA(C) subclan of chymotrypsin-like proteases in the MEROPS database (Rawlings et al., 2012) and displays a substrate specificity that is mainly directed toward the P2 position of the substrate (Blanck et al., 2014; Blanck and Ziebuhr, 2016). Cavally virus (CavV) is a member of the genus Alphamesonivirus in the family Mesoniviridae which, together with the families Arteriviridae, Coronaviridae, and Roniviridae as well as five others just approved by ICTV (Siddell et al., 2019), forms the order Nidovirales (Fig. 1\n). A distinct feature of previously characterized proteases from this virus order is the presence of an extra C-terminal domain with regulator function. This domain was shown to adopt different folds in arteri- and coronavirus enzymes (representing protease families S32 and C30, respectively) (Anand et al., 2002; Barrette-Ng et al., 2002) while there is currently no structural information on other nidovirus 3CLpros, such as those of roni-, toro- and bafiniviruses, all of which representing distinct protease families in the MEROPS database (C62, S65, and S75, respectively); toro- and bafiniviruses belong to distinct subfamilies of the newly established family Tobaniviridae.",

The protein structure comprises a two-\u03b2-barrel fold that is linked to a large C-terminal helical domain of >100 residues. The structure analysis identifies critical residues involved in substrate binding and suggests that mesonivirus 3CLpros employ a catalytic system that depends on (i) Cys153 (principal nucleophile), (ii) His48 (general base), and (iii) a water molecule mediating a polar contact between (iv) Asp216 and the catalytic His48. A strikingly similar arrangement was previously reported for coronavirus 3CLpro structures, which share very low sequence identity (<10%) with 3CLpro orthologs from other nidovirus families, further supporting the universal key roles of these residues in the respective enzymes (Fig. 2\n).",

The N\u03b4 of catalytic His48 makes also contact to the carboxylate side chain of Asp216 through water molecule 558 with distances of 2.7 \u00c5 and 2.9 \u00c5, respectively, forming an angle of 118.9\u00b0 (chain B).

The structure of CavV 3CLpro in complex with Bz-YYNQ-H, a peptide aldehyde inhibitor representing the P1\u2013P4 residues of the C-terminal CavV 3CLpro autoprocessing site, contains four rather than two molecules in the asymmetric unit. The molecules form a tetramer (a dimer of dimers) with RMSDs of 0.53 \u00c5 (for dimer A-B) and 0.65 \u00c5 (for dimer C-D), respectively. RMSD values of all four monomers are low and range between 0.33 and 0.56 \u00c5, suggesting that the four monomers adopt the same fold. The total contact areas between monomers A and B and between C and D were calculated to be 1770 \u00c52 and 1640 \u00c52, respectively. Dimer A/B is stabilized by four salt bridges and 29 hydrogen bonds whereas, in the contact surface of C/D, three salt bridges and 24 hydrogen bonds are present as determined by PDBePISA (Krissinel and Henrick, 2007). With only 494 \u00c52, the contact area between the two dimers is significantly smaller and involves three salt bridges and eight hydrogen bonds. In both monomers A and C, Arg28 was found to reach into the substrate-binding pocket of another molecule (C and A, respectively), resulting in different interactions between enzyme and ligand in those cases (see below). (In monomer C, the side chain of Arg28 was omitted due to missing electron density, but it would interact with molecule A if present.) As expected, the ligand Bz-YYNQ-H has reacted with the sulfhydryl moiety of the catalytic Cys153 and the resulting thiohemiacetal is clearly detectable in the active site with well-defined density in the 2mFo-DFc map for monomers A, B, and C (Fig. 5\nA). Also for monomer D, the Fo-Fc map indicates that the ligand is bound but, in this case, the electron density is relatively poor. We therefore omitted the ligand from the final model. The binding mode of the ligand to the three subsites S1, S2, and S3 is nearly identical for monomers A, B, and C, while slight variations exist among the three monomers with respect to the S4 subsite (Fig. 5B).",

The oxyanion hole that stabilizes the noncovalent Michaelis complex (Otto and Schirmeister, 1997) and the transition state includes the amide nitrogens of Gly151 (2.9 \u00c5 to the oxygen of the thiohemiacetal) and Cys153 (3.1 \u00c5 to the oxygen of the thiohemiacetal) in molecule A. Similar distances are observed in molecule C for the oxygen atom of the thiohemiacetal (2.8 \u00c5 to Gly151 and 2.9 \u00c5 to Cys153), while the distances in molecule B are much longer (4.4 \u00c5 to Gly 151 and 4.5 \u00c5 to Cys153) due to R-configuration. The ligand is suitably positioned to facilitate the nucleophilic attack of the sulfhydryl moiety at the prochiral carbonyl carbon, resulting in the formation of the (S)-configured thiohemiacetal in molecules A and C. Overall, the binding pockets of the monomers have a similar shape, except for two flexible regions, Tyr215-Val222 and a small region around the oxyanion hole (Phe150-Cys153).",

The structure supports and extends previous studies suggesting that nidovirus 3C-like main proteases share a three-domain domain organization involving a chymotrypsin-like fold (domains I and II) and a C-terminal domain III (Anand et al., 2002; Barrette-Ng et al., 2002; Blanck et al., 2014; Blanck and Ziebuhr, 2016; Lauber et al., 2012; Nga et al., 2011; Zirkel et al., 2011, 2013). Domain III is absent (or much smaller) in the related 3C/3CLpros of other RNA + viruses, while the N-terminal chymotrypsin-like fold (Birktoft and Blow, 1972; Matthews et al., 1967) is conserved in all these enzymes (Matthews et al., 1994; Mosimann et al., 1997; Muhaxhiri et al., 2013; Allaire et al., 1994). Despite their conserved structural organization, nidovirus 3CLpros are remarkably diverse with respect to their catalytic residues, again illustrating the profoundly divergent evolution of the various subfamilies of the order Nidovirales. Thus for example, arterivirus, torovirus and bafinivirus 3CLpros employ a canonical Ser-His-Asp triad (Barrette-Ng et al., 2002; Smits et al., 2006; Ulferts et al., 2011), while coronavirus, mesonivirus, and ronivirus 3CLpros use a Cys-His catalatic dyad that, as shown previously for coronavirus (Anand et al., 2002) and, in this study, for mesonivirus 3CLpro, is assisted by a water molecule interacting with an Asp residue located in a noncanonical position in the primary structure, C-proximal of the catalytic Cys (see below and Fig. 2).",

Each monomer of the two dimers of the CavV 3CLpro structure reaches into the other, with its N-terminus (residues 1\u201316) interacting with residues of the dimer mate, forming 6 hydrogen bonds (A2-B147, A5-B136, A5-B136, A7-B147, A10-B134 (2x)) and 1 salt bridge (A1-B296) in the case of monomer A. For the entire A/B dimer, 20 hydrogen bonds and 5 salt bridges are formed. The large contact interfaces observed for dimers A/B (1764 \u00c52) and C/D (1640 \u00c52) suggest that CavV 3CLpro dimer formation is of functional relevance which remains to be confirmed in further studies, such as those performed for coronavirus 3CLpros, in which the role of dimerization for trans-cleavage activity was confirmed and characterized in significant detail (for a review, see (Xia and Kang, 2011)). In contrast to the A/B and C/D dimers described above, the formation of the tetramer A/B\u2013C/D with an interface area of 494 \u00c52 (involving three salt bridges and eight hydrogen bonds between monomers A and C) likely represents a crystallographic artifact.",

            "text": "\nSubstrate-binding pocket. The S1 pockets of CavV 3CLpro and coronavirus 3CLpros are similar and can accommodate a Gln residue as shown here for a peptide aldehyde corresponding to the P1-to-P4 residues of the C-terminal CavV 3CLpro autoprocessing site. The structure shows that, in addition to His168, a conserved Thr residue (Thr148) is located in the S1 subsite and suitably positioned to establish interactions with Gln (or Glu), both of which are common in the P1 position of mesonivirus (including CavV) 3CLpro substrates (Blanck and Ziebuhr, 2016). Interactions between the equivalent Thr/His residues conserved in other viral 3C/3CLpros, including arterivirus nsp4 (Barrette-Ng et al., 2002; Snijder et al., 1996), and the side chains of P1 Glu/Gln residues have been shown previously to be critically involved in the binding of Gln and Glu residues, respectively. Interestingly, mesonivirus 3CLpros do not appear to have a strong preference for Gln in the P1 position of substrates (which is a typical feature in coronavirus 3CLpros) nor do they have a preference for Glu over Gln as shown for arterivirus nsp4 enzymes (Ziebuhr et al., 2000). A possible explanation for this less pronounced specificity for Gln or Glu in mesonivirus 3CLpros may be that His and Thr do not establish the same type of interactions with nearby located residues that appear to be required for fine-tuning the P1 specificity for Gln and Glu, respectively (Mosimann et al., 1997; Anand et al., 2002; Bergmann et al., 1997). Thus, for example, the equivalent His residue in the S1 subsite of coronavirus 3CLpros was reported to establish interactions with two other residues (Phe and Tyr) (Anand et al., 2002). These latter interactions are thought to keep the His residue over a wide pH range in the neutral state required for interacting with the P1 Gln side chain. Compared to other viral 3C/3CLpros, mesonivirus 3CLpros have a less pronounced specificity toward the P1 residue and tolerate a range of different residues in this position. In addition to Gln and Glu, Lys and several other residues are found at the P1 position of predicted cleavage sites in the replicase polyprotein of CavV and several other mesonivirus 3CLpros (Blanck and Ziebuhr, 2016). Interestingly, a replacement of His168 with Ala in a bacterial fusion protein construct containing the CavV 3CLpro was previously shown to have differential effects on the cleavage of the N- and C-terminal 3CLpro autoprocessing sites (Blanck et al., 2014). While cleavage at the N-terminal autoprocessing site was retained, cleavage of the C-terminal processing site was abolished in a CavV 3CLpro H168A mutant. As the N-terminal autoprocessing site contains a Lys residue in the P1 position, while the C-terminal autoprocessing site contains Gln in this position, it is tempting to speculate that His168 is required for the cleavage of substrates containing Gln (and, likely, Glu) in the P1 position, while this His residue may be (largely) dispensable for the cleavage of substrates containing Lys in the P1 position. To test this hypothesis and, more generally, establish the structural details of substrate binding for 3CLpro substrates with other residues at the P1 (and other) position(s), additional studies of enzyme/inhibitor complexes with suitable peptidic inhibitors should be performed. Also, it may be worth testing if (and to what extent) specific P1 and other residues flanking the scissile bond affect the cleavage efficiency at specific polyprotein cleavage sites, thereby possibly contributing to the timely coordinated release of specific processing products from the viral replicase polyproteins. As indicated above, the P1 Gln of molecules A and C was found to (also) interact with the backbone carbonyl oxygen of Arg28 from a molecule of the other dimer. We however consider this a crystallographic artifact and, therefore, will not discuss this further.",

In CavV and most other members of the genus Alphamesonivirus, the P2 position of putative 3CLpro substrates is predominantly occupied by Asn. The crystal structure of the 3CLpro/inhibitor complex shows that the Asn side chain fits perfectly into the S2 subpocket, with its carboxamide functionality acting as hydrogen bond donor and acceptor in interactions with the main chain carbonyl oxygen of Asp216 and the O\u03b3 atom of Ser52, respectively. The position of the strictly conserved Asp216 is stabilized by a salt bridge with the conserved Arg47 residue, suggesting that Asp216 has a dual functional role: besides its involvement in the coordination of the water molecule that interacts with the catalytic His48 residue, it is part of the S2 pocket, where it interacts with the carboxamide moiety of the Asn side chain. In addition to its specificity for Asn, the CavV 3CLpro S2 pocket would be suitable (and large enough) to accommodate other residues, such as Thr, which is found at the P2 position of one (out of 12) predicted CavV 3CLpro cleavage sites. In contrast, the P2 position of 3CLpro cleavage sites is either predominantly occupied by a Leu residue (in coronaviruses) or varies considerably (in arteriviruses).",

Also, no major differences are observed between the structures of the free enzyme and the enzyme/inhibitor complex. The superposition of 293 C\u03b1 atoms of 5LAC (chain B) and 5LAK (chain A) revealed an RMSD of 0.76 \u00c5. The only major difference observed upon complex formation is a peptide flip of Phe150 enabling a hydrogen bond between the carbonyl oxygen of the inhibitor (Gln5) and the amide backbone of residue Gly151 (2.9 \u00c5).",

            "text": "As reported previously, the primary structures of 3C-like cysteine proteases encoded by Coronavirinae, Roniviridae, and Mesoniviridae are poorly conserved except for two strictly conserved sequence signatures, RH and GxCG, that include the catalytic His and Cys residues (underlined) (Blanck et al., 2014; Nga et al., 2011; Zirkel et al., 2011, 2013; Ziebuhr et al., 2003). Our study suggests that this list of highly conserved residues may be extended by an Asp residue, Asp187 in the SARS-CoV-3CLpro and Asp216 in the CavV 3CLpro, that is shown to be conserved among the 3CLpros of all known coronavirus and mesonivirus 3CLpros in a similar position of the sequence (Fig. 2). Furthermore, previous comparative sequence analyses revealed that an equivalent Asp residue may also be conserved in ronivirus 3CLpros (Ziebuhr et al., 2003), suggesting a key function for this residue. In the first crystal structure reported for a coronavirus 3CLpro, this Asp (Asp186 in the TGEV 3CLpro sequence) was found to form a hydrogen bond to a water molecule located in a position that, in chymotrypsin and related serine proteases, is occupied by the side chain of the third member of the catalytic triad (typically Asp) (Anand et al., 2002). Asp186 was observed to form a salt bridge with Arg40. The strict conservation of the Asp and Arg residues in coronavirus 3CLpros was suggested to indicate an important role of Asp (and Arg) in maintaining the active-site geometry including the substrate-binding site, while a direct role for Asp186 in catalysis was considered unlikely. Our database searches revealed the presence of a water molecule that mediates a contact between the conserved Asp and the catalytic His residue in 70 out of 80 coronavirus 3CLpro structures available in the Protein Data Bank. In the remaining 10 structures, this water molecule is not visible, most likely because of insufficient resolution of the respective structure. The angle between Asp, the conserved water molecule and the catalytic His ranged between 119\u00b0 and 145\u00b0 (mean 130.3\u00b0) in the coronavirus 3CLpro structures and between 122.8\u00b0 and 128.4\u00b0 in the CavV 3CLpro/inhibitor complex structure (chains A-C) and 118.9\u00b0 in the structure of the free enzyme (chain B), thus representing a nearly perfect angle for a hydrogen-bonded water bridge.",

The two MSAs were aligned by MUSCLE v3.8.31 in the profile mode (Edgar, 2004). The resulting MSA was manually adjusted to improve regional sequence and structure similarity, mostly in the C-terminal domain. This refinement took into account another structure-based alignment of the same enzymes which was generated using the protein structure comparison service PDBeFold at the European Bioinformatics Institute (Krissinel and Henrick, 2004) which superimposes multiple structures simultaneously (Krissinel et al., 2005). Secondary structures were retrieved from the DSSP database (Hekkelman and Vriend, 2005; Touw et al., 2015).

Wild type CavV 3CLpro was produced as described before (Blanck and Ziebuhr, 2016) using a slightly modified purification protocol. Briefly, a fusion protein, in which the maltose-binding protein (MBP) sequence was fused to the complete 3CLpro coding sequence (corresponding to the CavV pp1a/pp1ab residues 1387 to 1700, GenBank NC_015668), was produced in E. coli and purified by amylose affinity chromatography. Following cleavage with factor Xa, MBP and 3CLpro (the latter containing no extra residues) were separated by anion-exchange chromatography. Pooled peak fractions containing CavV 3CLpro were further purified by size-exclusion chromatography in buffer containing 20 mM Tris (pH 8.0), 150 mM NaCl, 0.1 mM EDTA, and 1 mM DTT and using an \u00c4ktaPURIFIER 10 chromatography system equipped with a HiLoad 16/60 Superdex 75 column (GE Healthcare). CavV 3CLpro eluted as a single peak after 60 mL. Following adjustment of the protein concentration to 7 mg/mL using Amicon\u00ae Ultra Filters (10 kDa NMWL), the protein was immediately used for crystallization experiments.",
