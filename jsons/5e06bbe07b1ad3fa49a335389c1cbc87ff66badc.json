A total of 50 cassava fields distributed among 18 municipalities were visited and intensity of anthracnose evaluated. The highest disease incidence (DI) (83.3%) was in samples collected in S\u00e3o F\u00e9lix, and the lowest (34.4%), in Varzedo. Municipalities that presented the highest values for DI were located within the 'Af' K\u00f6ppen-Geiger eco-zone, also presenting the highest values for the estimated McKinney disease index. Based on previous studies of multilocus phylogeny, seven different species of Colletotrichum were identified (Colletotrichum fructicola, Colletotrichum tropicale, Colletotrichum gloeosporioides s.s, Colletotrichum theobromicola, Colletotrichum siamense, Colletotrichum brevisporum and Colletotrichum plurivorum) and a new approach based on ERIC-PCR was used aiming to group the 82 isolates according to these findings. The highest percentage of genetic variance (> 78%) was among isolates within fields. Based on the survey and genetic analysis, C. fructicola is probably the main causal agent of cassava anthracnose in the Rec\u00f4ncavo Region, since this species was present with highest incidence in all eco-zones, 47.61, 42.86 and 57.14% for Af (tropical rainforest climate), As (tropical dry savanna climate) and Aw (tropical wet savanna climate), respectively. This study is the first report of C. fructicola lineages as the most likely pathogen causing anthracnose disease of cassava in Brazil, and these findings may be used to guide the selection of resistant varieties.",

            "text": "Cassava is one of the most important food resources and major staple food for humans and animals worldwide (Suppakul et al. 2013 ). However, its production is strongly limited by many pests where cassava anthracnose disease (CAD), caused by Colletotrichum spp., is considered one of the most destructive cassava leaf diseases especially in main cassava producing countries worldwide (William et al. 2012; Sangpueak et al. 2018) CAD is characterized by cankers on stems, branches, fruits, leaf spots, and diebacks on aerial parts of diseased plants (Kunkeaw et al. 2010; Silva et al. 2018) . Despite the recent reports of different Colletotrichum species associated with cassava antracnose in Brazil Oliveira et al. 2016 Oliveira et al. , 2018 Silva et al. 2019) , little is known about its distribution, incidence, prevalence and disease severity across different production regions. Furthermore, there are no data regarding the relationship of CAD incidence and severity and agroecological practices and/or climatic zones in Brazilian conditions. From a practical point of view, this information could drive the adoption of disease management strategies prior to the occurrence of pandemic events decreasing the need of curative interventions (Plantegenest et al. 2007 ).",
