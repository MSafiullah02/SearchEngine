In Italy, the devised forecasts have been mostly based on a pure data-driven approach, by fitting and extrapolating open data on the epidemic evolution collected by the Italian Civil Protection Center. In this respect, SIR epidemiological models, which start from the description of the nonlinear interactions between population compartments, would be a much more desirable approach to understand and predict the collective emergent response. The present contribution addresses the fundamental question whether a SIR epidemiological model, suitably enriched with asymptomatic and dead individual compartments, could be able to provide reliable predictions on the epidemic evolution. To this aim, a machine learning approach based on particle swarm optimization (PSO) is proposed to automatically identify the model parameters based on a training set of data of progressive increasing size, considering Lombardy in Italy as a case study. The analysis of the scatter in the forecasts shows that model predictions are quite sensitive to the size of the dataset used for training, and that further data are still required to achieve convergentand therefore reliable-predictions. ____________________________________________________________________________",

Just to mention few instances, it is useful to recall that in the Hubei region, epicenter of the Covid-19 pandemic, extreme isolation measures were taken to rapidly reduce the spread of new infections. Lockdown measures with increasing severity over time were taken also in Italy, to reduce the peak of individuals requiring intensive healthcare treatment. Tracking the movement of infected people and their contact using smartphones was considered as a possible solution to extreme social distancing in South Korea. As a different strategy, policymakers in the UK initially decided to protect only the category of old people, which experienced the higher mortality rate, allow the spread of Covid-19 in the population, aiming at reaching the so-called herd-immunity. Later, they considered the need of stricter social distancing measures as well.",

In addition to the total number of infected, recovered and dead individuals reported by John Hopkins University, the Italian Civil Protection Center collected regional and national open data including also the actual number of infected people, those requiring intensive healthcare, and the number of individuals treated at home [2] . Thanks to such public resources, one has seen a proliferation of contributions in newspapers and social media from experts and non-experts, with an unprecedented mass participation to the knowledge of the evolution of Covid-19 pandemic. As a positive effect of such a knowledge share, well-known Italian scientists spotted the exponential growth at the beginning of epidemic, timely invoking urgent lockdown measures [3] [4] [5] . Later, the deviation from the exponential growth towards a logistic trend, as usually occurs for an epidemic, was highlighted [6] . Proliferation of forecasts have been noticed as well, mostly based on best-fitting of the open data using exponential or logistic regression curves, and then extrapolating trends in the future. As far as one could ascertain from newspapers [7] , Regione Toscana made forecasts by multiplying the number of infected individuals by the basic reproduction number, whose value has been presumably estimated based on an exponential fit of the daily trend of the observed infectious individuals. In many other cases, analogies between Italy and Hubei, supported by the similar population size involved in the two regions, have been put forward. In general, official forecasts seem to be underestimating the actual contagion [8] .",

However, if on one side increasing the number of compartments makes the model more realistic, on the other hand the number of model parameters to be estimated substantially increases and their identification is an issue. In the case of Covid-19 epidemic, the ratio between symptomatic and asymptomatic individuals is indeed the most difficult parameter to be identified, since there are no clear data to rely on [11] .

The 8 th of March, Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte announced the expansion of the quarantine zone to cover much of northern Italy. With that decree, the initial \"red zone\" was also abolished, though the municipalities were still within the quarantined area.",

Conte announced on 11 March that the lockdown would be tightened, with all commercial and retail businesses except those providing essential services, like grocery stores, food stores, and pharmacies, closed down. Such lockdown measures have been prolongated so far till the 13 th of May. Therefore, due to the above sequence of lockdown measures with increasing severity, the identified parameters of the A-SIR model considering the whole time frame available from the 24 th of February 2020 till the 12 th of April 2020 have to be considered as effective parameters, descriptive of the epidemic dynamics so far as a whole emergent phenomenon.",

Such predictions are shown in Fig. 2 (solid lines) , while the available observed data are shown with black dots.

This is evident from Fig. 2f , where the predicted final number of dead and recovered individuals at the end of epidemic is increasing with the day of forecast. After the 42 nd day, such an increase is reduced, which could be an indicator of approaching the peak in the actual infectious individuals, which could lead to a convergence in the model predictions. Therefore, further observed data are still required to draw reliable conclusions and judge about the reliability of model forecasts based on the present A-SIR epidemiological model. ",
