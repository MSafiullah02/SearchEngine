Nations and states were compared on new cases, hospitalizations, recoveries and deaths. National and international data were presented on interactive maps with circle sizes illustrating the spread of the covid-19 virus. A concept key to understanding how to interpret data is sampling.",

The target population consists of all the individuals who meet the sampling criteria. For example, a researcher may use a target population of all perianesthesia nurses for a study on resilience during a pandemic. But a study of the target population may not be feasible or affordable. The accessible population is the portion of the target population that the researcher can access, such as membership in ASPAN. Members who go on to provide data for the study are considered the sample. When reporting the number of subjects participating in a study, the researcher must be careful to provide a denominator.",

For example, your mother bakes a cake and cuts it into 10 pieces. Two pieces are eaten by your sister and brother; eight of ten pieces remain. Mathematically, ten represents the whole, or the population of cake pieces, the denominator; eight represents the sample of pieces remaining. If the researcher only states that eight pieces of cake are available, the reader does not know how large or small the cake was before it was sampled by your sister and brother.",

Such information is frequently provided in the methodology section of a report under a heading of 'Sampling'. A target population of patients in the perianesthesia unit could be estimated by the number of patients cared for each year, or the number of surgeries per month, or even the number of admissions per week. In this issue of the Journal, Andersson and colleagues collected anxiety data on 37 post-operative orthopedic patients. The reader can infer that the target population was 120 patients over a 4 week period, thus the sample represented 31% (37/120) of the population. While the authors provided a target population denominator, the small percentage of the population included in the sample limits the applicability of the findings. Repeated studies are needed.",

Prevalence is the number of cases in a particular population at a given time. The denominator is the population. For example, on April 14, there were 1,020 positive cases of covid-19 in New Hampshire and 752 cases in Vermont. It is tempting to say that the New Hampshire population was more infected. If the denominator is the number of tests performed the infection rate is 8.7% and 7.1% respectively. However, when the denominator is the total population, the rate is .075 and .12 respectively. Thus from this data snapshot, on April 14, Vermont had a greater disease prevalence.",
