These receptors are located in the lower respiratory tract and serve as the entry point for SARS-CoV-2 [3]. Histologic analysis demonstrates diffuse lymphocytic infiltrates, hyaline membrane development and abnormal pneumocytes [5].

Their administration has little influence on hemodynamics, with the most common effect being bradycardia secondary to sympathetic blunting. However, at larger doses, opioids have the potential to depress myocardium, and morphine can result in hypotension from histamine release [10]. Histamine release can also cause bronchospasm and large doses can lead to chest wall muscle rigidity, both of which could impair adequate ventilation and oxygenation [11].

However, ketamine can directly depress myocardial function, especially in states of catecholamine depletion and at larger doses necessary for induction of anesthesia [10]. Ketamine does have many benefits as an induction agent. Its sympathomimetic effect induces bronchodilation, which can improve lung compliance and reduce airway resistance [11]. In addition, Ketamine does not suppress respiratory drive. An animal study demonstrated that ketamine attenuated renal inflammation seen with hypoxia [13]. In sepsis or septic shock, ketamine can be protective against inflammation, reduce nitric oxide production, and decrease cardiac dysfunction, all of which prevent hemodynamic instability [12]. Ketamine could be a good agent for COVID-19 patient inductions; however, the anesthesiologist must be wary of cardiac failure with induction doses, especially if there is any preexisting history of cardiac disease or concern for viral cardiomyopathy.",

Etomidate has minimal respiratory side effects; however, coughing can occur, potentially increasing viral aerosolization [11]. Regarding the renal system, an animal study showed etomidate was less protective against tubular injury [13]. Etomidate can be considered for induction in COVID-19 patients because of its safer cardiac profile; however, hemodynamic instability due to catecholamine depletion and adrenal suppression are important considerations in these patients [12].",

By the time patients require intubation, many had progressed to the septic phase of COVID-19. We noted the need for significantly decreased anesthetic to successfully intubate these patients while maintaining hemodynamic stability. Rapid sequence strategies utilizing benzodiazepines with rocuronium resulted in a smooth and hemodynamically stable intubation. Midazolam doses commonly used were between 4-6 mg, approximately 0.05 mg/kg and rocuronium doses of 1.2 mg/kg. Analgesia was not a concern as most patients had no tachycardic response to intubation. Propofol and etomidate usage was noted to have greater hemodynamic instability, possibly due to catecholamine depletion consistent with severe sepsis. Rocuronium was preferred over succinylcholine because COVID-19 patients have long ventilatory courses and ventilator synchrony improves oxygenation and ventilation. Succinylcholine was also avoided because many patients had AKI and elevated potassium levels. Cisatracurium is a theoretically ideal agent in renal injury patients, but, as the timeline to consider extubation is a long one, the use of Cisatracurium may not be warranted. As the most common hemodynamic derangement was hypotension, phenylephrine was commonly administered with induction in doses of 100-200 micrograms. If additional hemodynamic support was anticipated, proper monitoring and access was established prior to airway management. If additional hemodynamic support is required, norepinephrine, a first-line agent in septic shock, is recommended [12].

Rather than removal and replacement, confirmation through visualization from video laryngoscope, end-tidal carbon dioxide along with bilateral chest rise should be utilized to confirm ETT placement.
