The SARS coronavirus that caused a worldwide epidemic in 2002\u20132004 either represents a novel group of coronaviruses or is a group II coronavirus (Drosten et al., 2003). In 2004, van der Hoek et al. (2004) reported the discovery of a new group I coronavirus designated HCoV-NL63. Using molecular probes that target conserved regions of the coronavirus genome, we found evidence of HCoV-NL63 (designated the \u201cNew Haven coronavirus\u201d in our initial description) in respiratory secretions obtained from children with respiratory tract disease (Esper et al., 2005). Several reports have demonstrated that HCoV-NL63 is a common virus and is associated with both upper and lower respiratory tract disease (Bastien et al., 2005, Chiu et al., 2005, Choi et al., 2006, Ebihara et al., 2005, Esper et al., 2005, Vabret et al., 2005, van der Hoek et al., 2005).",

First, use of whole virus or infected cell lysates as antigens would require efficient replication of these viruses in vitro. HCoV-NL63 replicates poorly in cell culture and this would limit the ability to screen a large number of serum specimens. Second, whole virus or infected cell lysates may detect cross-reactivity antibody, complicating the use of these materials for seroepidemiology. Indeed, portions of the nucleocapsid of HCoV-NL63 were detected by a goat anti-HCoV-229E suggesting that cross-reactive antibody to the two group I human coronaviruses may be elicited after infection with these viruses.

The most likely explanation for this is the exposure and infection with these viruses in the first year of life. Our cross-sectional study revealed that the percentage of seropositive individuals 2 years of age was much greater for HCoV-229E as compared to HCoV-NL63 suggesting that HCoV-229E was more prevalent in the 1\u20132 years prior to the acquisition of the serum for these children. Our findings are similar to that of Hofmann et al. who found, with the use of pseudotype virus expressing the S protein, that most sera from adults had HCoV-NL63-neutralizing antibodies (Hofmann et al., 2005). Indeed, the youngest children who had detectable HCoV-NL63-specific antibodies were \u223c1.5 years old and by age 8 years, the sera from most of the children screened had HCoV-NL63-specific antibodies, which are consistent with our findings.
