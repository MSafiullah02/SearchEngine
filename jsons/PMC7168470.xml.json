In previous reviews on \u201cstories on antiviral drug discovery,\u201d I have reviewed various subjects in which I was personally involved.1, 2, 3, 4, 5 In this review, hopefully the first of a new series, I will address \u201chot topics\u201d in areas of antiviral research in which over the past few years significant progress has been made requiring due attention. Most of the compounds covered are still in the preclinical stage. Compounds that have successfully completed phase II and III clinical trials and progressing to approval (or have already been approved) are not subject of this review. Instead, this article is based on compounds in the pipeline that offer attractive perspectives as future antiviral drugs. In this sense, the present survey is a little arbitrary in the selection of the topics, which depends at least in part on my own prejudices and a number of other factors, not at least my own acquaintance with the subject.",

Unfortunately, I could not attend the Conference, but guided by a certain devotion, I went through the Abstract Issue and spotted a number of interesting leads which I would like to reflect on in the present article: (i) nucleoside analogues, targeted at hepatitis C virus (HCV) NS5B RNA polymerase, such as PSI\u2010352938;6 (ii) cyclopropavir for the treatment of human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) infections;7 (iii) North\u2010methanocarbathymidine (N\u2010MCT) for the treatment of \u03b1\u2010herpesvirus [herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV\u20101) and type 2 (HSV\u20102)] and \u03b3\u2010herpesvirus [Epstein\u2010Barr virus (EBV) and Kaposi's sarcoma\u2010associated herpesvirus (KSHV) infection];8 (iv) CMX001 (1\u2010O\u2010hexadecyloxypropyl cidofovir) for the treatment of a broad variety of DNA virus infections;9 (v) favipiravir (T\u2010705) for the treatment of influenza virus infections and various other RNA virus infections;10 (vi) the increasing number of compounds found effective against arenaviruses;10, 11 (vii) new picornavirus (i.e., rhinovirus) inhibitors;12, 13 (viii) natural products with antiviral activity such as aglycoristocetin derivatives14 and tricin (4\u2032,5,7\u2010trihydroxy\u20103\u2032,5\u2032\u2010dimethoxyflavone);15 (ix) mitogen extracellular kinase (MEK) inhibitors, such as U0126, acting at a cellular target, and effective against influenza and other viruses;16 and (x) two unique sets of compounds which should be effective against virtually all enveloped DNA and RNA viruses.17\n",
