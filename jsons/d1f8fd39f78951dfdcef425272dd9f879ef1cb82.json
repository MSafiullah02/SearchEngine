As examples, trace determinations of Cr VI and silica in water samples were achieved after online ion exchange chromatography, where the dehydration product of CrO 4 2\u00c0 and NTA (m/z 290) and that of SiO 4 4\u00c0 and IDA (m/z 192) were measured. The limits of detection of the respective methods were 17 nM (0.83 ng Cr/ml) for Cr VI and 0.17 \u03bcM (4.8 ng Si/mL) for SiO 4 4\u00c0 .",

            "text": "The determination of inorganic ions remains one of the oldest research themes in analytical chemistry. The current state of the art for such analyses is based on inductively coupled plasma (ICP) emission and mass spectrometry (MS) for metal ions and ion chromatography for anions. Although these techniques deliver impressive analytical performance, researchers in this field continue to seek improvements in sensitivity, selectivity and convenience. For instance, electrospray ionization MS (ESIMS) has attracted a wide interest as testified in a number of recent studies. [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] Electrospray ionization MS is one of the most powerful analytical techniques for identification and quantitation of inorganic and organic species in various fields because of attractive features such as direct sampling of solution samples, soft ionization, high sensitivity and selectivity. A key disadvantage, however, is the susceptibility to sample matrix effects, which impacts adversely on quantitative analysis. For the determination of inorganic ions, therefore, ESIMS has often been combined with a pre-separation step, whereby the analytes are first separated from the sample matrix using liquid chromatography (LC) and/or extraction techniques. The ion chromatography (IC)-ESIMS system has been applied to determine various inorganic ions by a number of researchers as summarized in recent reviews. [1] [2] [3] The use of ESIMS and complexation-extraction techniques for sample pretreatments has been extensively developed by Minakata et al. for trace analysis. [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] For trace determination of metal ions using ESIMS, a number of studies have been reported since the pioneering experiments of Horlick's group in the 1990s. [13, 14] However, few studies, until recently, have been applied to real samples, probably reflecting the issue of sample matrix effects. Minakata et al. used diethyldithiocarbamate (DDC) and pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate (PDC) to ligate metal and metalloid ions and to extract the complexes into the organic phase. Methods were described for determinations of cobalt, [4] platinum, [5] molybdenum, ruthenium, [6] hexavalent chromium, [7] copper, silver and gold [8] based on DDC and for determinations of arsenic(III) and arsenic(V) [9] in clinical samples using PDC. A novel method was also proposed for trace metal analyses based on negative ion mode ESIMS, where metalaminopolycarboxylate (metal-APC) complexes, particularly those of trans-1,2-diaminocyclohexane-N,N,N\u2032,N\u2032-tetraacetic acid (CyDTA), were measured after online separation of the complexes from sample matrices with a size exclusion column. This approach was used for determination of heavy metals in environmental samples. [15] [16] [17] The group of Armstrong has devised more sensitive analytical methods for trace analysis using positive ion mode ESIMS (or ESIMS/MS) where the ion-pair formation of negatively charged metal-APC complexes and dicationic ion-pairing reagents were utilized. These approaches realized sensitivities for some metal ions that were comparable with ICP-MS. [18, 19] In the case of anions, methods for the determination of perchlorate and perbromate ions in environmental samples by IC-ESIMS, as reported by Dasgupta and co-workers, are noteworthy because of their importance in environmental chemistry. A key feature of these methods is the formation of ion pairs of organic dications and perchlorate ion (or other inorganic anions), which are measured. [20] [21] [22] Minakata et al. described the formation of gold(I) complexes followed by ion-pair extraction into an organic phase for determination of cyanide, [10] thiocyanate [11] and iodide [12] in clinical samples. The concept of ternary complex formation for determination of halide and cyanide ions has been proposed by the authors, whereby the ternary complexes of group (III) elements with nitrilotriacetic acid (NTA) and halides and that of copper(II), 4-(2pyridylazo)-resorcinol and cyanide permitted determinations of halides and cyanide, respectively. [15, 17, 23] In particular, ultra-trace amounts of fluoride were determined using [AlF(NTA)] \u00c0 . [15] For differential measurement of Cr species, HCrO 4 \u00c0 (m/z 117) was directly monitored by ESIMS for Cr VI , while Cr III was detected as the Cr III -CyDTA complex. [24] The limits of detection (LODs) wer\u1ebd 13 nmol/dm 3 for Cr VI and 56 nmol/dm 3 for Cr III . The proposed methods, applied to the measurement of chromate and trivalent chromium in conversion coatings on steel samples, gave results that were consistent with those by the diphenylcarbazide spectrophotometric method for Cr VI and ICP-atomic emission spectroscopy (AES) for total Cr. During this study, it was noted that chromate ions reacted with various APCs at the electrospray (ES) interface to produce dehydrated products, which gave prominent MS signals. Also, the MS response was found to be linear with the Cr VI concentration. The oxyanions, molybdate and orthosilicate were then tested, and it was noted that they also underwent dehydration reaction with APCs. Thus, the idea to use this dehydration reaction as a general reaction scheme for determination of oxyanions by ESIMS was conceived.",

The selective determination of trace amounts of inorganic oxyanions is generally difficult, and ESIMS is a good candidate for such a purpose. However, its application has been limited to specific oxyanions such as halogen species [20] [21] [22] and phosphate. [29] Also, it was found that a previous approach for measurement of Cr VI was not appropriate for some oxyanions that have a low acidity. [24] Moreover, this latter approach was unique in applying the gasphase reaction at the ES interface to derivatize the oxyanions, which then makes it possible to perform trace analysis. Finally, methods for the determination of chromate and orthosilicate in waters based on the combination of IC and ESIMS were demonstrated.",

            "text": "In the context of method development and for direct measurement of HCrO 4 \u00c0 (m/z 117) by ESIMS, it was found that chromate ion reacted with various APCs as well as some organic acids at the ES interface to produce dehydrated products, giving prominent MS signals ( Table 1) . As shown in the table, chromate and all the carboxylic acids tested gave intense signals due to the 1:1 dehydration products (\u00c0H 2 O), although the signal for HCrO 4 \u00c0 (m/z 117) was always observed, showing that chromate did not react completely with the carboxylic acids. The ratio of the signal of the dehydration product with NTA to that of HCrO 4 \u00c0 (m/z 117) was highest, suggesting that the reaction efficiency of NTA with chromate was the highest for the combinations of chromate and carboxylic acids tested. Figure 1 shows the mass spectrum of a solution containing 100 \u03bcM of K 2 Cr 2 O 7 , 500 \u03bcM of NTA and 40 \u03bcM of Co III -EDTA, where the signal for the dehydration product was observed at m/z 290. A possible reaction scheme for NTA with chromate is shown in Scheme 1. As mentioned in the introduction, O'Hair's group observed similar reactions at the interface, where group VI oxyanions ([MO 3 (OH)] \u00c0 and [M 2 O 6 (OH)] \u00c0 , M = Mo, W) acted as catalysts in a two-step gas-phase catalytic cycle for the dehydration of acetic acid to ketene, although they reported that chromate hardly reacted with acetic acid. [26] Our observations were clearly different from that of O'Hair et al. Moreover, other organic acids, i.e. citric acid, malic acid and oxalic acid, were also found to react with chromate as shown in Table 1 , although signal intensities were lower than those of the APCs. To study the effect of the acidity of the carboxylic acid on the efficiency of the dehydration reaction, acetic acid and five halogenoacetic acids were examined. First, a solution containing 25 \u03bcM of chromate and 200 \u03bcM of acetic acid (pK a 4.75), monochloroacetic acid (MCA) (pK a 2.88), dichloroacetic acid (DCA) (pK a 1.48) or trichloroacetic acid (TCA) (pK a 0.7) was tested. The order for the intensities of the signals for the dehydration products was acetic acid < MCA < DCA < TCA. Moreover, when a solution containing the three halogenoacetic acids (200 \u03bcM each) and chromate (25 \u03bcM) was tested, only the dehydration product of TCA gave a strong MS signal (m/z 261). Thus, it seemed that the higher the acidity of the carboxylic acid, the more reactive the acid was. This result was consistent with that of O'Hair's group; i.e. the order of the reactivity with [Mo 2 O 6 (OH)]was acetic acid > CF 3 -CH 2 OH > CH 3 OH, depending on their acidities. [25] They also proposed the mechanism of the dehydration reaction of [V 2 O 5 (OH)]and methanol based on their theoretical calculation study, which said that the reaction begins by the formation of an ion-molecule complex between [V 2 O 5 (OH)]and methanol; then, it is followed by the formation of a bridging oxo ligand deprotonating methanol with concomitant opening of the VO 2 V ring (transition state). [28] That is, the deprotonation process is one of the most important ones; thus, the acidities of carboxylic acids may affect their reactivities greatly. In contrast, different results were obtained with trifluoroacetic acid (pK a \u00c00.3), TCA and tribromoacetic acid (TBA) (pK a 0.8) where almost the same intensities were noted for the three acids. Moreover, when a solution containing all three halogenoacetic acids (200 \u03bcM each) and chromate (25 \u03bcM) was tested, only the dehydration product of TBA gave a strong MS signal (m/z 395). These findings suggested that there was an optimum acidity of the carboxylic acid for this reaction, which should be quite low, probably around a pK a value of 1; the exact reason for this is not yet known. Although the gas-phase acidities of these acids might have some effects, we were not able to evaluate them because of lack of data on them. This may be one of the reasons why APCs gave higher intensities than other organic acids that did not contain a N atom.",

            "text": "As the dehydration reaction seemed not to be limited to chromate ion, dehydration reactions of 16 oxyanions with several APCs, i.e. IDA, NTA, CyDTA and triethylenetetramine-N,N,N\u2032,N\u2033,N\u2032\u2033,N\u2032\u2033hexaacetic acid, were next investigated. The test solutions contained 0-100 \u03bcM of each oxyanion, 500 \u03bcM of each APC and 40 \u03bcM of Co III -EDTA as an internal standard. The internal standard did not affect the formation of dehydration products and was effective in compensating for the daily changes in instrument sensitivity. As for the pH of the test solutions, the pH values for solutions containing IDA wer\u1ebd 4, and the others were~9. Table 2 summarizes the occurrences of the dehydration reaction for each test solution and specifies the LOD for the oxyanion (3\u03c3 of blank sample) when the reaction was used for the determination of the oxyanion. Moreover, the chemical forms of the supposed dehydration products of some oxyanions with IDA are shown in Fig. 2 as examples. It should be noted that the optimization of the measurement conditions for each combination was not performed; thus, the LOD would be improved, if reaction conditions were optimized. In fact, some of the combinations, i.e. chromate and NTA, orthosilicate and IDA, and molybdate and NTA, gave very high sensitivities. It is possible to classify the 16 oxyanions into three groups, i.e. group 1, metal elements; group 2, metalloid elements; and group 3, non-metal elements as follows: Group 1 VO 3 \u00c0 , CrO 4 2\u00c0 , MoO 4 2\u00c0 and WO 4 2\u00c0 . All of the oxyanions in this group gave prominent MS signals for the dehydration products for all of the APCs tested. In particular, MoO 4 2\u00c0 and WO 4 2\u00c0 formed dehydration products that had lost two water molecules. Although O'Hair's group reported that CrO 4 2\u00c0 did not react with acetic acid, [26] this was not the case in this study, the dehydration product giving a strong MS signal as mentioned earlier. Moreover, although O'Hair's group reported the formation of the dehydration products with binuclear oxyanions ([M 2 O 6 (OH)] \u00c0 , M = Mo, W, and [V 2 O 5 (OH)] \u00c0 ), we did not observe such products, probably because of differences in the respective measurement conditions. The MS signals of the dehydration products were sufficiently intense to be suitable for trace analyses. In this work, the dehydration product of NTA and CrO 4 2\u00c0 was used for trace determination of Cr VI in water samples (see below). Group 2 BO 3 3\u00c0 , SiO 3 2\u00c0 , SiO 4 4\u00c0 , AsO 4 3\u00c0 , AsO 2 \u00c0 , SeO 4 2\u00c0 and SeO 3 2\u00c0 . Although oxyanions of this group still formed dehydration products that may be useful for trace determinations, their reactivities seemed to be lower than those of group 1. Some of the APCs did not form dehydration products with some oxyanions, e.g. those of BO 3 3\u00c0 , AsO 4 3\u00c0 , AsO 2 \u00c0 , SeO 4 2\u00c0 and SeO 3 2\u00c0 . It is speculated that complex formation involving the oxyanion and APC in the gas phase may occur prior to the dehydration reaction, and this step may be responsible for differences between the APCs. As shown in Table 2 , direct measurement of some oxyanions of group 2 such as BO 3 3\u00c0 , SiO 3 2\u00c0 , SiO 4 4\u00c0 and AsO 2 \u00c0 was not possible because of low acidity; nevertheless, the dehydration products did give high sensitivities. Thus, the use of these dehydration reactions for trace analysis may be important given that there are few alternative methods. There are two forms of oxyanions for Si, i.e. metasilicate (SiO 3 2\u00c0 ) and orthosilicate (SiO 4 4\u00c0 ). The dehydration product of metasilicate from which one water molecule is lost has the same m/z as that of orthosilicate from which two water molecules are lost, as shown in Table 2 and in Si-1 and Si-2 of Fig. 2 . Thus, there was difficulty in differentiating between the two forms, which seemed to show only slight differences in sensitivities. In careful experiments using an ionexclusion chromatography (IEC)-ESIMS system (see below), however, metasilicate and orthosilicate gave the same sensitivity where IDA was used as a carboxylic acid. This suggests that both silicates gave the same dehydration product, i.e. Si-1 or Si-2 in Fig. 2 . Given that the main chemical form of silica in natural water is monomeric orthosilicate, [30, 31] the dehydration product of orthosilicate has mainly been studied in this paper, and an analytical method for silica in natural waters was developed as outlined later. In the case of the oxyanions of As and Se, there are two predominant species for each element, where the valencies of the central atoms are different from each other, i.e. AsO 4 3\u00c0 and AsO 2 \u00c0 and SeO 4 2\u00c0 and SeO 3 2\u00c0 . In these cases, the dehydration products give different m/z values; thus, we can distinguish them from each other, as shown in Table 2 and Fig. 2 (As-1 to As-4 and Se-1 and Se-2, respectively). In both cases, the oxyanions of the lower-valency species, i.e. arsenite (AsO 2 \u00c0 ) and selenite (SeO 3 2\u00c0 ), gave much higher sensitivities than those with higher valency, i.e. arsenate (AsO 4 3\u00c0 ) and selenate (SeO 4 2\u00c0 ), respectively. The higher valency of the central atom of the oxyanion species may cause a higher acidity (Table S2 ), in other words, a lower gas-phase basicity, therefore resulting in lower ability to accept proton from carboxylic acids (see above). [28] Nevertheless, the dehydration products of arsenite (AsO 2 \u00c0 ) and arsenate (AsO 4 3\u00c0 ) with IDA gave high sensitivities; particularly, the 1:2 product of arsenite and IDA (m/z 337) from which two water molecules were lost (As-2 in Fig. 2 ) resulted in a very low LOD of 0.69nM (0.052 ng As/mL) ( Table 2) . Accordingly, the development of speciation methods for arsenite and arsenate is planned. Group 3 NO 3 \u00c0 , NO 2 \u00c0 , PO 4 3\u00c0 , SO 4 2\u00c0 and ClO 4 \u00c0 . Oxyanions of this group did not react with APCs except for the combination of NO 2 \u00c0 and IDA. Thus, the dehydration reaction may not be useful for the trace determination of these oxyanions except in the case of NO 2 \u00c0 . These results may be due to the higher valencies of the central atom (M), which results in too low gas-phase basicity for reaction with carboxylic acids as discussed earlier for group 2 species. Although PO 4 3\u00c0 did react with CyDTA at the highest temperature conditions of CDL, the MS signal was very weak. Thus, other measurement strategies such as direct measurement of the oxyanions [29] or the application of ion-pair formation [20] [21] [22] may be more effective for trace analysis. The possibility does, however, remain to exploit the dehydration reaction for trace determination of NO 2. Determination of Cr VI by post-column IC-ESIMS using dehydration reaction of chromate with NTA A post-column IC-ESIMS system, which exploited the dehydration reaction of chromate ion with NTA, was used for the trace determination of Cr VI , as shown in Fig. 3 . For the post-column reaction, the optimized concentration of 500 \u03bcM NTA solution (flow rate, 0.3 ml/min) was added to the eluate (35 mM NH 4 HCO 3 solution), and the dehydration product was monitored at m/z 290 in selected ion monitoring (SIM) mode. An anion exchange column (AG4A-SC Dionex) was used to separate chromate ion from other anion and cation species. An example of a river water analysis is shown in Fig. 4 , where sulfate ion was separated from chromate ion. Linear calibration for chromate was maintained up to 10 \u03bcM. At higher concentrations, the graph deviated slightly from linearity (Fig. S2) . The LOD for chromate was 17 nM, whereas it was 62 nM when HCrO 4 \u00c0 (m/z 117) was measured directly. The method was used for analysis of river samples (Kiryu River near the university), and although Cr VI was not detected in the samples, analyte recoveries were 97 \u00b1 3.5% and 98 \u00b1 3.9% for spike additions of 5 and 10 \u03bcM of Cr VI , respectively. These results demonstrated the potential of the present method for trace determinations of Cr VI in real samples.",

            "text": "Determination of silica in water samples by ESIMS using the dehydration reaction of silica with IDA As shown in Table 2 and Fig. 5 , orthosilicate ion and IDA formed the dehydration product (m/z 192), from which two water molecules were lost, to give very high sensitivity for orthosilicate ion. Thus, this reaction was utilized to determine silica in water samples. Moreover, the dehydration product of the dimer of orthosilicate (H 6 Si 2 O 7 ) and IDA (m/z 270), from which two water molecules were lost, was also observed as shown in Fig. 5 . This dimer probably does not exist in sample solutions but may form at the CDL, because the signal became very weak compared with the monomer product (m/z 192) when the CDL temperature was lower. Moreover, the monomer and the dimer gave the same retention time in IEC (see below). The measurement conditions were as follows: a water methanol (v/v) ratio of 3:7 was found to be most suitable (Fig. 6a) ; the CDL temperature was the most important instrumental parameter, and the signal intensity increased with an increase in temperature (Fig. 6b) . This result suggested that the dehydration reaction occurred mainly at the CDL, although the dissociation processes may also occur in the heater block region. A linear calibration curve for orthosilicate was obtained up to 1 \u03bcM; at higher concentrations, the graph showed a curvature. The LOD for orthosilicate was 11 nM (0.31 ng Si/ml). Direct analyses of bottled mineral water samples were attempted, but we were not able to obtain reproducible results presumably because of the presence of matrix effects. Thus, IEC was used to separate silica from the sample matrix constituents, [32, 33] according to the procedure of Ikedo et al. [32] The instrumental setup was basically the same as that of Fig. 3 . The separation column was a polymethacrylate-based weakly acidic cation-exchange resin in the H + form, Tosoh TSKgel SuperIC-A/C (6.0-mm inner diameter \u00d7 15 cm) with a guard column (TSKgel guard column SuperIC-A/C, 4.6-mm inner diameter \u00d7 2 cm). The eluate was pure water (flow rate, 0.3 ml/min). [32] A methanolwater (80:20 w/w) solution containing the optimized concentration of 100 \u03bcM IDA (flow rate, 0.3 ml/min) was used as a post-column solution. The dehydration product of silicate and IDA was monitored at m/z 192 in SIM mode. Figure S3 shows effective in removing the matrix interferences present in the sample. The LOD was 0.17 \u03bcM for orthosilicate (4.8 ng Si/ml), and the calibration curve was linear up to 10 \u03bcM. This LOD was slightly higher than that of the literature (1.0 ng Si/ml) where a molybdenum blue method was used for post-column detection. [33] However, the sensitivity of the present method should be high enough to determine silica in natural waters except for seawater samples. To analyze seawater samples, desalination may be necessary, and the development of such a system is now in progress. The present method was applied to the analysis of bottled mineral water samples and a river water sample, and, as shown in Table 3 , the results were in good agreement with those of ICP-AES and the molybdenum yellow method.",

            "text": "To confirm that the dehydration reactions occur not only in the present instrument (Shimadzu LCMS2010) but also in other ESIMS systems, the dehydration reaction between orthosilicate and IDA was examined (any other system was not examined) using three further ESIMS systems, i.e. Nano Frontier from Hitachi High-Technologies Co., Japan; Model 6120 from Agilent Technologies, USA; and QTRAP 3200 from AB Sciex, USA. Although instrument optimizations were not attempted, prominent MS signals for the dehydration product (m/z 192) were realized in the three instruments. Thus, the proposed methods have generic potential, and trace measurement of oxyanions may be undertaken on various ESIMS platforms. the ES interface to produce dehydration products that gave intense ion responses. We assume that these dehydration reactions should take place in the gas phase, considering the works of O'Hair's group. [25] [26] [27] [28] However, it should be noted that we do not have any evidence to eliminate the possibility that the dehydration reactions take place in the liquid phase, and further studies should be necessary to clarify the mechanism of these reactions. Signal strength was sufficient to permit trace measurement of the oxyanions. In particular, the measurement of species that have relatively high pK a values such as BO 3 3\u00c0 , SiO 4 4\u00c0 , AsO 2 \u00c0 and NO 2 \u00c0 would be significant given that direct measurement of these oxyanions by ESIMS is not possible. Moreover, simultaneous determination of several oxyanions should be possible by this method, as IDA, for example, reacts with various oxyanions as mentioned earlier. Methods for the determination of Cr VI and silica in water samples were developed in combination with IC, where the dehydration products of CrO 4 2\u00c0 and NTA (m/z 290) and SiO 4 4\u00c0 and IDA (m/z 192) were measured, respectively. The LODs were 17 nM for Cr VI and 0.17 \u03bcM for SiO 4 4\u00c0 . There remain two outstanding problems with the present methodology. First, there is a need to improve method sensitivity. The optimization of chelating agent chemistry as well as the use of state-of-the-art instrumentation may result in sensitivity enhancement. Also, there is a need to improve the performance of the online matrix removal system. In this respect, we are developing an online electrodialysis system, which may make it possible to realize a more efficient and higher-throughput system compared with the present IC-based system.",
