            "text": "A 6-month-old castrated male Persian-mix cat was presented with a complaint of weakness when jumping. General physical examination revealed no remarkable findings. At 7 months of age, the cat showed dropped hocks in the pelvic limbs and mild muscle atrophy in the thighs. At 8 months of age, notable muscle atrophy in all four limbs and gait difficulty were evident. The cat was able to move by turning its body axis, but could not stand. Mental status, behaviour, proprioception, spinal reflexes, cranial nerves and sensation were all normal. At 1 year of age, joint contracture and marked muscle atrophy were observed in all four limbs. The dorsolumbar area also showed marked muscle atrophy. The cat was recumbent and was unable to move its body, but head and neck motion was relatively well preserved, despite limited movement of the temporomandibular joint. Food often spilled from the cat's mouth, and drinking of water was difficult. However, neither intravenous fluid administration nor force-feeding was required, as the cat managed to feed itself adequately, and dehydration was avoided by the addition of water to its food. As the cat tended to retain urine, manual bladder expression was required. Tension and contraction of the bladder appeared normal on palpation. After about 1 year of age, the rate of deterioration of the cat's condition slowed (\nFig 1). The cat's voice faded and was lost at about 3 years of age. Thereafter, there was little further deterioration until the cat died due to acute respiratory insufficiency at 5 years and 3 months of age. The cat ate well and maintained a normal weight and mentation throughout its life, with no clinical or observed evidence of pain.",

Tissue samples of the sartorius and biceps muscles of the thigh were fixed in 10% formalin and processed routinely for paraffin sections. Histopathological examination of the specimens revealed severe muscle atrophy and diffuse perimysial infiltration by fatty tissue. The atrophic changes showed a diffuse distribution within the examined biopsy tissues, and the atrophic muscle fibres were angular in shape. The muscle fibres were markedly reduced in number with mild infiltration by mononuclear cells, which appeared to be macrophages or histiocytes. At 2 years and 8 months of age, a second muscle biopsy was performed to search for dystrophin. Fresh tissue samples of the sartorius and biceps muscles of the thigh were frozen in dry ice, and cryostat sections were made. However, the results of immunohistochemical staining with monoclonal anti-human dystrophin antibody (Novocastra, Newcastle, UK) were normal.",

Severe muscle atrophy characterised by marked reduction in both the size and number of the muscle fibres and diffuse infiltration by fatty tissue, especially in the limbs, was observed. Within the muscle lesions, the intramuscular nerve branches and muscle spindles were well preserved (\nFig 2). The remaining muscle fibres varied in size and showed several types of degenerative change, including endomysial fibrosis and increased numbers of nuclei with occasional central nuclei. Similar changes were also observed in the longissimus and masseter muscles and the diaphragm, although these lesions were less prominent than those in the limbs. In the heart, changes were characterised by irregular arrangement, disarray and vacuolar changes of cardiac muscle fibres, and were consistent with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. In the lungs, there was diffuse thickening of the alveolar walls, as well as focal crystalline deposits of cholesterol and accumulation of foamy macrophages and lymphocytes. These changes were consistent with lipid pneumonia. In the nervous tissues, including the brain and spinal cord, nerve roots, ganglia and peripheral nerves, no significant pathological changes were visualised in paraffin sections stained with haematoxylin and eosin and Luxol fast blue. In the urinary bladder and the other viscera, there were no remarkable histological lesions.",

Monoclonal antibodies (1F9 and 5H2) (provided by Eva Engvall, Burnham Institute for Medical Research, La Jolla, CA, USA), which had been characterised previously, were used for laminin \u03b12-immunostaining (Leivo and Engvall, 1988, O'Brien et al., 2001). Commercially available antibodies were used to assess other muscle proteins. The results of immunohistochemistry with these antibodies, except laminin \u03b12, were equally positive in both this cat and the control cats. However, the muscle basement membrane from this cat was unreactive with both 1F9 and 5H2 antibodies against laminin \u03b12, whereas those of the control cats were intensely immunoreactive with both antibodies (\nTable 1,\nFig 3). These results indicated an absence of laminin \u03b12 in the skeletal muscles of this cat.",

            "text": "In human medicine, muscular dystrophies are described according to whether they are inherited conditions characterised by varying degrees of muscle weakness that are not neurogenic (Emery 2001a). Then whether they are associated with specific defects in proteins, which are normally expressed at least in the skeletal muscles (Emery 2001a). Finally, mitochondrial myopathies, as well as myopathies associated with characteristic pathological lesions such as central cores or nemaline rods, are excluded (Emery 2001a). Recently, muscular dystrophies have been classified into more than 30 different forms, according to whether they are due to defects in muscle proteins such as dystrophin, laminin \u03b12, \u03b17 integrin, dysferlin, caveolin-3, sarcoglycans, telethonin, myotilin, calpain-3, poly-A binding protein, emerin and laminin A/C (Emery 2001a). Laminins are glycoproteins which are major components of the basement membrane and consist of \u03b1, \u03b2 and \u03b3 subunits (Wewer and Engvall, 1996, Hayashi and Arahata, 1997). Laminin \u03b12 is one of the five subclasses of laminin \u03b1 chains (Wewer and Engvall, 1996, Hayashi and Arahata, 1997). Laminins which include the laminin \u03b12 chain have been called merosin and are found in the basement membranes of skeletal and cardiac muscles, Schwann cells and the placenta (Leivo and Engvall, 1988, Hayashi and Arahata, 1997). Muscular dystrophy caused by laminin \u03b12 deficiency is called merosin-deficient congenital muscular dystrophy, and shows autosomal recessive inheritance in humans (Tome et al., 1994, Helbling-Leclerc et al., 1995, Hayashi and Arahata, 1997, Emery, 2001b).",

The muscular dystrophies whose causes have been identified are dystrophinopathy and laminin \u03b12 deficiency in dogs and cats, and sarcoglycanopathies in dogs (Cooper et al., 1988, Kornegay et al., 1988, Valentine et al., 1988, Carpenter et al., 1989, Gaschen et al., 1992, Gaschen and Burgunder, 2001, O'Brien et al., 2001, Shelton et al., 2001, Poncelet et al., 2003, Shelton and Engvall, 2005). Muscular dystrophy with dystrophinopathy in cats, which is similar to Duchenne muscular dystrophy in humans, generally occurs in males as an X chromosome-linked disorder (Carpenter et al., 1989, Gaschen et al., 1992, Gaschen and Burgunder, 2001). It is characterised by systemic muscle hypertrophy and is known as hypertrophic feline muscular dystrophy (Gaschen et al., 1992, Gaschen and Burgunder, 2001, Gaschen et al., 2004). Muscular dystrophy with laminin \u03b12 deficiency in cats has been reported in three females, and the disease was not familial (O'Brien et al., 2001, Poncelet et al., 2003).",

These two signs were evident in the present cat. It is considered that muscle atrophy and joint contracture are characteristic clinical features of the disease, differing from those of hypertrophic feline muscular dystrophy. Although the present cat showed no evident neurological abnormality, peripheral nerve involvement has been described in three cats with laminin \u03b12-deficient muscular dystrophy and also in merosin-deficient congenital muscular dystrophy in humans (Shorer et al., 1995, O'Brien et al., 2001, Poncelet et al., 2003). In the present case pathological examinations of the nervous system were performed using only paraffin sections, and further specific investigations including ultrastructural studies would be needed to evaluate the morphological changes in the peripheral nerves. Cardiac changes similar to those of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy were recognised in the present cat. The relationship between the cardiac lesions and laminin \u03b12 deficiency remains unclear, as the cardiac changes have not been described in previously reported cats with laminin \u03b12-deficient muscular dystrophy (O'Brien et al., 2001, Poncelet et al., 2003). Although the present cat showed a tendency for urine retention, no pathological changes which could have caused dysuria were identified.",
