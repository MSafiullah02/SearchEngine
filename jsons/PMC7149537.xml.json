SARS-CoV has been repeatedly isolated from the nasopharynx, respiratory secretions, feces, and blood of patients with SARS, and seroconversion has been consistently demonstrated in survivors.2, 3, 4 Individuals with potential exposure to SARS cases, but who do not develop the clinical syndrome, generally do not show evidence of seroconversion.5 Direct evidence of causation is provided by the observation that experimental infection of cynomolgus macaques with SARS-CoV results in a similar clinical and histologic respiratory disease to that observed in humans.6 The causative link between the SARS-CoV and SARS has therefore been well established; however, the pathophysiologic mechanisms by which this syndrome occurs are less clear.",

Bronchial epithelial denudation, loss of cilia, and squamous metaplasia occur early.7 In lung tissue, an early phase of hyaline membrane formation, edema, and pneumocyte proliferation is followed by diffuse alveolar damage characterized by an exudative and proliferative phase.7,\n8 Although these features appear similar to findings in acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), characteristics such as predominant macrophage proliferation in consolidated areas and the presence of multinucleate giant cells are more specific for SARS and may suggest an important role for proinflammatory cytokines in the pathogenesis of SARS.7 Some data suggest that the viral load in the respiratory secretions of patients with SARS is characterized by a peak occurring around the 10th day of illness followed by a decrease in viral load, concomitant with the appearance of an antibody response to the virus.9 However, in most patients, clinical deterioration occurs progressively during the second week of illness despite a stable or decreasing viral load. This time course supports the suggestion that part of the lung damage may be immunopathologic.8,\n9 Serum cytokine levels in patients with SARS have been measured. Observational data suggest that proinflammatory cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor and interleukin (IL)-6, IL-8, and IL-16 are increased and peak during the 8th to 14th day following illness onset.10\n",

The common presenting features (see later), many of which are similar to other viral infections, may be the consequence of viral replication, proinflammatory mediator production, or other as yet undiscovered mechanisms. The severe and largely isolated respiratory system manifestations typical of SARS are associated with evidence of both viral replication and proinflammatory mediator release, but exact pathophysiologic mechanisms are unknown. As has now been demonstrated in other infective conditions, it is also possible that genetic predisposition may play a role in determining the progression and ultimate severity of illness in individuals, but no published data as yet support this hypothesis.",

Patients demonstrating the clinical features of a temperature higher than 38\u00b0C and one or more clinical findings of respiratory illness (e.g., cough, shortness of breath, difficulty breathing, or hypoxia), as well as the epidemiologic features of travel within 10 days of onset of symptoms to an area with current suspected community transmission of SARS, or close contact within 10 days of onset of symptoms with a person known or suspected to have SARS, were considered suspect cases. Probable cases were defined as those having the foregoing features, as well as evidence of pneumonia on a chest radiograph or computed tomography scan. Because of the variable performance of laboratory testing for SARS at this time, case classification did not rely on laboratory criteria.",

Only specific epidemiologic criteria, such as a history of laboratory exposure to the SARS virus, remain important. The current laboratory diagnostic criteria from the CDC are therefore important and stringent. They require the detection of antibody to SARS-CoV in a serum sample, or the detection of SARS-CoV RNA by reverse transcriptase\u2013polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) in two samples, or the isolation of SARS-CoV with confirmation by a PCR assay or the isolation of SARS-CoV.22 Findings must be verified in an appropriate WHO-certified laboratory. The use of RT-PCR is problematic, however, because interpretation requires some understanding of test parameters. Peiris and colleagues found that the sensitivity of RT-PCR assay is highly dependent on the type of specimen tested and the time of collection of specimens with respect to the day of onset of symptoms.9 In particular, the viral load as detected by RT-PCR seems to follow a triphasic pattern with a peak on day 10. Sensitivity for respiratory specimens collected at presentation is low (32%), but it increases to approximately 70% during the second week. Yam and associates found that the sensitivities of RT-PCR performed on nasopharyngeal specimens and throat swabs collected between day 1 and day 5 after admission were 61% to 68% and 65% to 72%, respectively.23 However, repeated testing on respiratory specimens increases sensitivity to 75% to 79%. The sensitivities on urine and fecal specimens collected between day 5 and day 10 after admission are lower (50% to 60%). The optimal strategy in using RT-PCR assay remains to be defined.",
