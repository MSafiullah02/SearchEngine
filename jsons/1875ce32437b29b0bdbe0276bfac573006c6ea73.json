Mass testing, with or without symptoms, offers a method of controlling the spread of infection and provides epidemiologists with valuable information about viral hot spots.",

However, major differences exist between the US, South Korea and Iceland that makes mass testing an impracticable solution for countries with large population densities 5, 6, 7 . Rapid testing of ~15% of the US population is less feasible and comes at an exponentially higher cost. Still, actions are being taken to expand the diagnostic supplies needed to improve overall testing in the US 8 .",

The differences may be due to early testing, starting before their first outbreak 10 . The US did not start testing until a month after the first reported case 11, 12 . The delay may play a role in the even higher fatality rate observed in Washington state (4.7%), as the outbreak in late February could have been detected via testing 12 .( Figure 1&2B) A delay in testing could be compounded by increased spread and skyrocketing healthcare demand. New York increased their testing capacity 13 . But as the percentage of individuals testing positive continues to increase (Figure 2A) , the case-fatality rate is increasing, suggesting that additional fatalities are persisting . This could be due in part to the lack of hospital resources experienced by New York and other states ( Figure 3 ).",

Attempts to control the spread come with J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f significant impacts on the economy. Invoking widespread testing for surveillance has the potential to determine changes in prevalence that warrant the start or end of distancing measures and success. Now that the genomes of COVID-19 have been released, a molecular assay can be manufactured for the US that can determine who is infected 16 . Moreover, a potential drawback of the current Coronavirus tests is the time it takes to receive results. If this diagnostic device could bypass remote laboratories, many people could be tested and provide it more costeffectively. Applying tele-medicine and GPS-enabled functionality to this device could track the infected patient who leaves isolation, alert people who may have been exposed. Improved early surveillance testing will be significant for those who are asymptomatic and at high risk for infection, particularly high risks groups 17, 18, 19 . In this way, a method of continuous targeted surveillance testing and identified hot spots is obtained, to track the spread of infection, apply interventions, and offer points of interception.",

It is crucial that we make active efforts of contact tracing, active ongoing surveillance and quarantine if we are to prevent further mass outbreaks. Let us learn from our current experiences of waiting until the pandemic is knocking at our front door to intervene and work together to build a new future that is more than a life spent in social distancing.
