In this work, molecular modeling studies were performed to develop a predictive Common Pharmacophore Hypothesis (CPH) and use it for alignment in 3D-QSAR studies using CoMFA and CoMSIA. A total of 30 compounds containing an amide fragment as the key linker, consisting of 17 of our previously discovered CypA inhibitors and 13 other inhibitors reported in the literature, were selected for pharmacophore refinement and 3D-QSAR studies. The best pharmacophore hypothesis AADR, which had two hydrogen bond acceptors, a hydrogen bond donor, and an aromatic ring, was obtained and used for the alignment of molecules in CoMFA and CoMSIA model development. The models showed a good r 2 value of 0.992 and 0.949 for CoMFA and CoMSIA, respectively. The contour maps of the models were analyzed to give structural insight for activity improvement of future novel CypA inhibitors. The CPH can also provide a powerful template for virtual screening and design of new CypA inhibitors.",

In addition to binding the target of Cyclosporin A (CsA), an immunosuppressive drug used to prevent allograft rejection [2] , CypA plays a critical role in a variety of biological processes, including enhancing the rate of folding/unfolding of proteins via its Peptidyl-Prolyl Isomerase (PPIase) activity [3, 4] , and binding to the HIV-1 Gag polyprotein for facilitating viral replication [5] . Recently, it was discovered that the nucleocapsid (N) protein of SARS Coronavirus (SARS-CoV) can bind to CypA, which may be associated with SARS-CoV infection [6, 7] .

These inhibitors possess different scaffolds from our discovered CypA inhibitors. It is widely accepted that pharmacophore model is a well-behaved approach to quantitatively explore common chemical characteristics among a considerable number of structures with were combined to construct a novel pharmacophore model and 3D-QSAR studies here. In the present paper, pharmacophore models and 3D-QSAR studies were carried out based on 30 currently available inhibitors containing an amide fragment as the key linker [14, 16] (Tables 1A -C) , which includes 17 of our previously discovered CypA inhibitors [14 -17] (Tables 1A and B) , and 13 other inhibitors reported by Guichou et al. (Table 1C ) [19] . The compounds were carefully selected with great diversity in both molecular structure and bioactivity. The same assay (standard chymotrypsin-coupled assay) was used to test the inhibitory activity of 30 compounds. The substrates are all Suc-Ala-Ala-cis-Pro-Phe-pNA. However, different substrate concentrations were used. We ran the assay with 76 mM of substrate while Guichou used 32 mM. But the systematic deviation of pIC50 values, from different substrate concentrations used, amounts to only 0.2 log units. Pharmacophore modeling was performed by a novel technique, using Pharmacophare Alignment and Scoring Engine (PHASE) [20] . Following the pharmacophore results, 3D-QSAR models were constructed by using Comparative Molecular Field Analysis (CoMFA) and Comparative Molecular Similarity Analysis (CoMSIA). The purpose of this study is to offer some beneficial clues in structural modifications for designing new inhibitors with much higher in-hibitory activities against CypA, and a predictive model for evaluating novel synthetic candidates.",

All of these molecules have activity range spans of three orders of magnitude, and CypA PPIase activities were achieved by the same assay method using the standard chymotrypsin-coupled assay. The same peptide substrate (Suc-Ala-Ala-cis-Pro-Phe-pNA) and similar substrate concentrations were used in enzymatic activity assay, so the activity data are of good uni- formity.

By GOLD3.1 program [22] , the 30 molecules were docked into the enzyme (CypA) against the X-ray crystal structure 1YND [23] . Then the structures with reasonable active conformations obtained from the docking results were imported into the project table of the \"Develop Pharmacophore Hypothesis\" panel within PHASE. For the diversities of these compounds, five compounds which have highest bioactivities were set as \"active compounds,\" and the three compounds which possess lowest bioactivities were set as \"inactive compounds.\" The active set was used for developing common pharmacophore hypotheses. The inactive compounds were used to eliminate the hypotheses that cannot provide a good explanation of activity on the basis of pharmacophores alone. Any scoring of inactives depends on the assumption that just a pharmacophoric deficiency causes weak affinity. Choosing weak binders as \"inactives\" then possibly increases the chances of considering information from molecules that contain some, but not all, of the essential pharmacophore features in the correct spatial arrangement [20] . Thus, an adjusted score based on the alignment of the chosen inactives could be calculated. The score is adjusted by subtracting a multiple of the survival score of the inactives from the survival score of the actives [20, 24] .",

The final size of pharmacophore box was 1 , which governs the tolerance on matching; the smaller the box size, the more closely pharmacophores must match. Hypotheses were generated by a systematic variation of the number of sites (Nsites) and the number of matching active compounds (Nact). Nsites was varied from 7 to 3 until at least one hypothesis was found and scored successfully. Scoring with respect to active compounds was conducted using default parameters for site, vector, and volume terms.

This grid divides space into uniformly sized cubes, typically 1 on each side, which are occupied by the atoms or pharmacophore sites that define each molecule. A given atom or site is deemed to occupy a cube if the center of that cube falls within the radius of the corresponding sphere. A single cube may be occupied by more than one atom or site, and that occupation may come from the same molecule or from different molecules. Each occupied cube gives rise to one or more volume bits, where a separate bit is allocated for each different category of atom/site that occupies the cube [20] . The total number of volume bits assigned to a given cube is based on occupations from all training set molecules. A molecule may thus be represented by a string of zeros and ones, according to the cubes it occupies, and the different types of atoms/sites that reside in those cubes. Since the bit string is simply a collection of binary valued 3-D descriptors, it is possible to treat the bits as a pool of independent variables for purposes of QSAR model development. Because the number of bits is typically much larger than the number of training set molecules, PHASE QSAR models are created by applying Partial Least Squares (PLS) regression to this pool of binary-valued independent variables [20] . The PLS procedure ultimately results in the assignment of a regression coefficient to each bit, which facilitates the identification of specific chemical features that tend to increase or decrease the estimated activity. In 3D-QSAR building, chemical features of ligand structures are mapped to a cubic 3-D grid [20] . The accuracy of the models is improved with an increase in the number of PLS factors until overfitting starts to occur.",

The molecules in the training set were aligned on these CPHs and evaluated by PLS analysis described in PHASE with three PLS factors. The predictivity of each hypothesis was analyzed by the com-pounds in the test set. The summary of statistical data of the best two types CPHs is listed in Table 2 . The hypothesis named AADR.2 showed better statistical significance than the one called AARR.21. Thus, the hypothesis AADR.2, which comprises two hydrogen bond acceptors, a hydrogen bond donor, and an aromatic ring, was selected for the following CoMFA and CoMSIA analyses. The hypothesis AADR.2 ( Figure 1 ) indicated the active molecular skeleton of the three classes of inhibitors. The putative binding mode of the hypothesis is shown in Figure 1c . The hydrogen bond acceptor A3 and the hydrogen bond donor D7 were very important for activity because the sites could form two hydrogen bond interactions with the residues Gln63 and Asn102 around the \"saddle\" between the two active pockets of CypA [14, 16] . The sites, which occupied with the hydrogen bond acceptor A1 and the aromatic ring R12, could form other noncovalent interactions like hydrophobic interactions with the residues in the active pockets of CypA, such as Lys82, Thr73, and Thr107. The distances and the angles between the four features are shown in Table 3 .

Three sites could form hydrogen bonds with CypA and the ring could form hydrophobic interaction with CypA. All of the four sites are very important for CypA inhibitory activity. The CPH can provide a powerful template for virtual screening and design of new CypA inhibitors.
