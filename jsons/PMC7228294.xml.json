            "text": "In December 2019, 41 cases of unexplained pneumonia were clustered in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China. Most of the infected people were confirmed to be related to the South China Seafood Market. On 7 January 2020, the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention isolated and confirmed this pathogen as a novel type of coronavirus through a throat swab. This coronavirus was then named 2019\u2010nCoV by the World Health Organization (WHO).\n1\n The origin of the virus remains unknown, and the virus\u2010host is suspected to be a species of bat.\n2\n On 25 January 2020, the WHO confirmed that the virus was spread via human\u2010to\u2010human transmission and family\u2010aggregated infections and is less contagious to healthcare professionals, unlike severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS\u2010CoV) and the Middle East respiratory syndrome\u2010related coronavirus.\n3\n On 31 January 2020, the WHO characterized the outbreak as a public health emergency of international concern.\n4\n At the close of day (on 18 February 2020 at 24:00:00), the cumulative number of infected people worldwide was 73 332, and the cumulative number of infected people in China was 72 528. The virus had spread to 25 other countries globally, with 1873 deaths worldwide.\n5\n At present, the mortality rate in China is about 2.58%, and the number of infected and dead people continues to increase. On 11 February 2020, the WHO officially named infection due to the virus as coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID\u201019)\n5\n and the Coronavirus Study Group of the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses named 2019\u2010nCoV severe acute respiratory syndrome\u2010related coronavirus 2, or SARS\u2010CoV\u20102.\n6\n At present, COVID\u201019 poses a huge threat to China and the world. COVID\u201019 is highly infectious and transmitted mainly through respiratory droplets and contact with infected persons. The possibility of feco\u2010oral and aerosol transmission remains to be further studied.\n7\n In 2004, some researchers found that the tears of SARS patients tested positive for viral nucleic acid, some patients only showed positive results with tear samples,\n8\n and the chromosome of SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 was 82% similar to that of SARS\u2010CoV.\n9\n A previous study reported the case of a clinician who was infected while working with only his eyes unprotected.\n10\n Lu et al\n11\n reported that the disease can be transmitted through the mucous membranes, including the conjunctiva. There have been many case reports in which many ophthalmologists were found to be infected through routine diagnosis and treatment.\n11\n Considering that the virus is present in the body fluids of patients, tear fluid is a type of body fluid, and SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 is similar to SARS\u2010CoV, it is speculated that there may be a risk of tear and conjunctival transmission. Therefore, this is a focus of the current research to understand whether COVID\u201019 is transmitted via other routes and reduce further spread of the epidemic.",

Some patients have no obvious fever or respiratory manifestations, or even obvious symptoms in the early stages of the disease.\n13\n During clinical diagnosis and treatment, particularly at the outpatient clinic, it is difficult to quickly screen patients with early\u2010stage disease or carriers of the virus. According to recent reports, a large number of ophthalmologists involved in the diagnosis and treatment of the disease on a daily basis accidentally acquired NCP. Thus, many doctors suspect that it is related to contact with tears or conjunctival secretions of patients.\n11\n In the study of this small sample, we used conjunctival test paper to obtain tears and conjunctival secretions of 30 patients for standard RT\u2010PCR assay. Only one patient with conjunctivitis found viral RNA in his tear fluid and conjunctival secretion twice. The conjunctivitis was characterized by viral conjunctivitis with conjunctival congestion and aqueous secretion. The patient had no severe fever or respiratory symptoms when we collected his specimens. And the course of disease was in the early stage for only 3 days.",

While taking the tear fluid sample for testing, we obtained sputum samples from patients as control samples; 55 of the 60 sputum samples yielded positive results. This, to some extent, indicated that the tear and conjunctival secretions of patients without conjunctivitis were not an infectious route for SARS\u2010CoV\u20102. At present, the transmission route of the novel coronavirus remains unclear, and many scholars believe that it may be transmitted through aerosols.\n14\n However, the most commonly used noncontact tonometer for ophthalmologic examination sprays a gas during the examination, which produces a large amount of aerosol in the local area. Moreover, aerosols may be concentrated in the local air for a long time, and general alcohol wipe disinfection is ineffective, causing great panic in the field of ophthalmology.\n15\n According to the results of this study, no virus particles were detected in tear and conjunctival secretions in patients without conjunctivitis. Therefore, current routine disinfection can prevent the spread of the virus; noncontact tonometer, ultrasound biomicroscopy, corneal confocal microscope, and others do not theoretically cause cross\u2010infection. The low abundance of the virus in tear and conjunctival secretions does not eliminate the risk of transmission through conjunctival tissue. As ophthalmologists come into contact with patients at a close\u2010range during the examination, the saliva of infected patients may still cause infection among medical staff through conjunctival tissue; thus, goggles are still necessary protective measures.",

Some scholars have found that RT\u2010PCR is effective for diagnosing novel coronavirus through meta\u2010analysis, is significantly better than smear\u2010dyeing inspection and culture identification, and it has become the gold standard for the diagnosis of coronavirus infections. However, there are inevitably many false positive and false negative results, which are often caused by sample contamination and damage to genetic material.\n18\n In 2003, some studies reported on the detection of virus particles in conjunctival secretions among SARS patients.\n19\n Researchers in Hong Kong obtained conjunctival secretions and conjunctival cells from 17 confirmed cases and tested them via viral RT\u2010PCR; the results were all negative. Researchers in Singapore also tested conjunctival secretions obtained from 34 highly suspected cases via RT\u2010PCR assay and found that three of the patients had positive results, although their pharyngeal secretions yielded negative results. Of course, the Singaporean researchers also mentioned the possibility of sample contamination during sampling, but due to the shortcomings of RT\u2010PCR technology, the existence of false negatives could not be ruled out.\n8\n On the basis of the results of our research, we collected tear and conjunctival secretions twice at an interval of 2 to 3 days and the results showed good consistency. Therefore, we were sure that SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 existed in tears and conjunctival secretions in NCP patients with conjunctivitis. For patients without conjunctivitis, we detected no virus in tears and conjunctival secretions indicating that it is not a common route of its transmission.

The results showed that the virus existed in the patients' tears and conjunctival secretions with conjunctivitis and there was no virus in the patients' conjunctival sac without conjunctivitis. However, this study had several limitations. First, the included sample size was relatively small. Simultaneously, although the samples were collected by the professional ophthalmologist (JHX), the collected tear and conjunctival secretions were limited, so sample concentration might be insufficient for RT\u2010PCR detection of the virus. Therefore, the possibility of virus particles in tear and conjunctival secretions in NCP patients without conjunctivitis cannot be completely ruled out. Second, only one patient enrolled got conjunctivitis and the virus was detected from his conjunctival secretion. However, the virus was not successfully isolated and cultured in the conjunctival secretion of the patient. We cannot tell whether all NCP patients with viral conjunctivitis exist with the virus in their conjunctival sac and whether the virus causes conjunctivitis. In addition, most patients in this study received antiviral treatment before sampling. Although sputum samples were also tested for comparison, the effect of drug treatment on the results could not be excluded. Therefore, further large\u2010sample and more comprehensive studies are needed to evaluate the role of novel coronaviruses in the eyes.",
