Neutralization of IL-17A, however in this model, augmented the allergic response, while recombinant IL-17A administration reduced pulmonary eosinophil recruitment and bronchial hyperreactivity. Recombinant IL-17A reduced eosinophil-chemokine eotaxin (CCL11) and thymus- and activation-regulated chemokine (TARC/CCL17) in lungs in vivo, and antigen uptake by dendritic cells and IL-5 and IL-13 production in regional lymph nodes were also reduced by recombinant IL-17A [8]. These findings demonstrated a novel negative regulatory role of IL-17A. A beneficial role of IL-17A has been confirmed in the model of chronic fungal-induced asthma. In this model, the protective role of TLR6 was dependent on IL-23 and the production of IL-17A. TLR6 deficient mice showed reduced IL-23 and IL-17A expression and an exacerbated Th2 response, which was normalized by addition of recombinant IL-23 which recovered the IL-17A production [15]. Furthermore, Murdoch and Lloyd provide evidence in the model of acute allergen-induced response that the \u03b3\u03b4T cell-dependent normalization of lung function and resolution of inflammation was dependent on the production of IL-17 [16]. Therefore, endogenous IL-17A has a dual role. While it is essential during antigen sensitization to establish allergic Th2 response, in sensitized mice IL-17A attenuates the Th2 response.",

However, as shown most recently, stimulation of the myelin-reactive T cells with TGF\u03b2 plus IL-6, instead of IL-23, completely abrogated their pathogenic function despite upregulation of IL-17A production [28]. These regulatory Th17 cells failed to upregulate the proinflammatory chemokines crucial for central nervous system inflammation. In contrast, the regulatory Th17 cells produced IL-10, which had potent anti-inflammatory activities. This study by Cua\u2019s group [28] did not show whether IL-17A directly conveyed negative regulation of inflammation, which was rather due to co-expressed IL-10 in EAE. Several experimental approaches listed below have indeed demonstrated direct inhibitory functions of recombinant and endogenously produced IL-17A in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore, an IL-17A-induced expression of the anti-inflammatory IL-10 has been demonstrated in macrophages, yet IL-17A has moderate effects on monocytes and macrophages [29].",

Second, administration of recombinant IL-17A ameliorated and negatively regulated the late phase of experimental autoimmune neuritis (EAN), a model of peripheral nerve demyelination [31]. Third, in vitro studies provided possible mechanisms of how IL-17A acts as a suppressor. IL-17A inhibited the chemokines RANTES (CCL5), Fractalkine (CX3CL1), and CTACK (CCL27) [32\u201334] and the mononuclear leukocyte adhesion molecule VCAM-1 in TNF-activated mesenchymal cells [35]. Fractalkine, CTACK, RANTES, and VCAM-1 are involved in inflammatory responses of both Th1 and Th2 types. RANTES and VCAM-1 are essential in the recruitment of mononuclear cells, and VCAM-1 is involved in the formation of germinal centers (present in autoimmunity). Therefore, existence of the novel negative regulatory role of IL-17A needs to be revisited in multiple inflammatory and immune disorders.",

Indeed, in initial experiments IL-17A was described as a Treg cytokine in cell cultures, inhibiting vast T cell responses [36, 39]. Furthermore, Treg cells and TGF\u03b2 promote under proinflammatory conditions the development of Th17 cells and production of IL-17A [40].

Third, local IL-22 gene delivery led to rapid amelioration of intestinal inflammation in a mouse model of ulcerative colitis, and conversely, inhibition of IL-22 activity by local overexpression of its antagonist, IL-22 binding protein, prevented recovery and goblet cell restitution in acute colitis (DSS) [44].

This dual effect of IL-17A in human cell cultures predicted a reduced mechanism of mononuclear cell recruitment in vivo. CC-type chemokines RANTES (CCL5), TARC (CCL17) and eotaxin (CCL11) were induced by antigen OVA in vivo. TARC primarily attracts CCR4-positive Th2 cells. IL-17A reduced TARC production, which correlated with reduced lymphocyte counts and Th2-derived IL-5 concentrations in lung tissues. The expression of the major eosinophil attractant, eotaxin, was also reduced by IL-17A and accompanied by reduced eosinophil infiltration in the airways. Indeed, reductions or absence of these CC chemokines reportedly ablates allergic asthma [56\u201358].

IL-6 elevations inhibited aeroallergen-induced Th2 inflammation [59, 60]. PGE2 elevations reduced pulmonary allergy specifically via the E3 receptor [61]. Therefore, while IL-17A may upregulate negative regulators IL-6 and PGE2, it has a direct inhibitory effect on the local production of Th2 cytokines IL-4, IL-13, and IL-5 in the lung and regional lymph nodes [8]. Mechanistically, IL-17A inhibits dendritic cell activation and antigen uptake, which leads to reduced activation of T cells and reduced IL-4, IL-13, and IL-5 production, resulting in reduced allergic response.",

These findings were supported by the following cell culture data [35]. IL-17A inhibited TNF-induced chemokine RANTES expression in human synovial fibroblasts and mouse lung fibroblasts. This inhibitory activity of IL-17A was sixfold more potent than its stimulatory activity on TNF-\u03b1-induced IL-6 or IL-8 secretion (IC50 = 0.2 ng/ml vs. ED50 = 1.2 ng/ml), measured in the same cells. Furthermore, neutralization of the human IL-17A receptor (IL-17R) by antibodies competitively reversed the IL-17A-induced IL-6 upregulation. However, anti-IL-17R antibody only partially neutralized the inhibitions of RANTES production by IL-17A. Yet, IL-17R was essential for the RANTES inhibition, as assessed in IL-17R-deficient cells. Therefore, inhibitory and stimulatory functions of IL-17A involve receptor IL-17R but show distinct dose responses and in turn different sensitivities to an IL-17R antagonizing antibody. These findings suggest a higher efficiency of the inhibitory over the stimulatory IL-17A functions and may explain why a net negative regulatory effect of IL-17A manifests in chronic inflammation in vivo where IL-17A production is low.",

It has been shown that inhibitor I\u03baB-\u03b1 is of importance for the transient inactivation of NF-\u03baB, whereas I\u03baB-\u03b2 as part of a multimeric complex is involved in the persistent inactivation of NF-\u03baB [63, 64].

IL-17A neutralization inhibits experimental murine arthritis [20] and is a potential alternative therapy to TNF neutralization in rheumatoid arthritis. The novel negative regulatory function of IL-17A indicates, however, that such a therapy bears the potential risk of exacerbating allergic asthma. Therefore, an anti-IL-17A treatment in chronic inflammatory disorders seems very promising, inhibiting neutrophil recruitment in inflamed lungs and joints, while the exacerbating Th2 response in experimental allergic response by anti-IL-17A antibodies may exclude respective groups at risk from such a therapeutic anti-IL-17A treatment.",

However, inhibiting IL-17A or IL-22 may bear the potential risk of opportunistic infections. IL-22 together with TNF-\u03b1 was found to be important to keep the epidermal integrity during infection with Candida albicans [72]. Mutations in STAT3 in animal models and humans confer a defect in IL-17 function, resulting in increased susceptibility to respiratory infections with bacteria and fungi [70, 73, 74]. Neutralization of IL-22 resulted in exacerbation of bacterial infections, suggesting a protective role in mucosal/epithelial host defense [75]. And IL-22 was protective during the development of lung fibrosis induced by chronic exposure to Bacillus subtilis [76].",
