Besides humbly admitting this to be, first of all, the work of doctors, nurses, virologists, biologists and epidemiologists, not to mention the engineers who design medical and life-saving devices, each of us wonders what technical tools among ours might either help the fight, or at least teach something about how the pandemic appears to work. I wrote down these thoughts when I went through the paper [1] , in which the authors perform a deep investigation of the behaviour with time of the \"total number C (t) of people who have been infected so far\", for the Chinese Province of Hubei, the other Chinese Provinces, and few other countries undergoing the outbreak of COVID-19, i.e. South Korea, Japan, Iran and Italy. It is important to stress that [1] appeared on March 12, 2020, so the data those authors could use were just the ones available at that stage of the epidemics: all the reasonings about their finding should be understood to describe the contagion dynamics up to that time.",

The Ordinary Differential Equation (ODE) (2) has been largely and succesfully employed in epidemiology, so there is no real surprise in its applicability to the COVID-19 outbreak. However, the question here is which \"first principle meaning\" should be given to those powers p and \u03b1 in (2) . In the literature, those parameters are determined empirically, so to fit the experimental curve C (t) a posteriori, once the epidemic is completely developed. Some study noticeably put the (p, \u03b1) values in relationship with the \"microscopic contagion dynamics\" [3] : it is shown that these constants depend on the geography of contagion (whether the epidemic develops in regions with clusters of population and communications, like towns of various size, or not) and on the sociology of contagion (in the case of HIV, for instance, whether this takes place via sexual intercourse, or via needle sharing); these \"microscopic conditions\" appear to be what gives the contagion network a different topology. Recently, the specific study [4] on the COVID-19 outbreak argued how the scale-free complex clusterization of contagion events could motivate a fractional kinetics for C (t), as in classical dynamics of systems with complex structures in phase space. I am myself involved, together with Giuseppe Consolini, in a study searching for an ODE possibly solved by the best fit of the COVID-19 curve in Italy [5] : indeed, the effects of dynamics with finite waiting time (possibly encoding a complex phase space topology) appear to be relevant.",

This, roughly, gives rise to integer powers of population variables in the ODEs.

The answer suggested here in inspired by the Trophic Web Theory (TWT), where the dynamics of interacting populations in ecosystems are represented via coupled ODEs. In TWT a form of segregation may take place, namely herd behaviour : this assumption, that represents a topological correction to the mass hypothesis, leads the population variables to appear in equations with non-integer powers, exactly as in the GRM, so popular in epidemiology, and that the authors of [1] claim to fit the curves of the COVID-19 epidemic. Here the suggestion is that the \"abstract geometrical locus of contagion events\" may have a fractal dimension, under the assumption that the network of human contacts giving contagion may be a scale-free network, with clusters of links on many scales, just reflecting those geographical and sociological aspects evoked by the authors of [3] (it may be of some use to stress that the term \"herd behaviour\" here has nothing to do with the expression \"herd immunity\" of epidemiology. Moreover, no obvious relationship between the two \"herd things\" appear).",

The right hypothesis is, then, not that each prey is attacked by each predator, but that just the X \u2202 prey units along the group border will be. So, in the place of X in\u1e8a Y (X, Y ), one has to put the number of prey units really involved in this predation, the X \u2202 ones sitting on the group border. Because the scene is 2-dimensional, under the hypothesis of homogeneos surface density (a necessary one, in order to discuss space-implicit models, describing everything via ODEs), comparing the number of individuals along the border of a geometrical figure with that of all the ones all over the figure is just as comparing the length of the perimeter with the measure of the surface.

As argued before, the exponents p and \u03b1 depend on the physical distribution of people, on their behaviour and on their relationship network: under this point of view, one has to hope that the lockdown meaures taken by many Governments are acting in the direction of diminishing p, and increasing \u03b4 in (12), so to render less effective the \"spreading\" term rC p and more and more important the \"liming\" term \u2212\u2206 eff (C) C 2p .",
