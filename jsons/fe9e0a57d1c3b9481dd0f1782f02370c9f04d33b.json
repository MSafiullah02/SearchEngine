It is a tropical and subtropical fruit tree which is native to Fujian and Guangdong regions of China and is cultivated as an important commercial fruit crop in many parts of the world. It is famous for its fragrant and sugary flavour. After China, India is at the second position in the production of lychee in the world. The varieties with large pulp, small seeds and noteworthy flavour are of great interest among the consumers and farmers. Lychee fruit took tremendous attention of scientists as it contains ample amounts of anti-oxidants, vitamins and fibre. Moreover, the plant parts possess considerable anti-pyretic, anti-inflammatory, anti-cancer, antidiabetic, anti-tumour and anti-oxidant properties. Propagation of lychee from seeds is difficult and not practicable because of longer juvenile period and nonviable, abortive and genetically diverse nature of the seedlings. However, the techniques such as cell, tissue and organ culture (micropropagation) can overcome the difficulties of lychee propagation. Very limited efforts have been made in its varietal improvement through hybridization and modern breeding techniques. In a nutshell, lychee is an important commercial fruit crop, and there is a need to develop technical research so as to sustain and enhance its yield, postharvest management, medicinal value and marketing.

The species belongs to the family Sapindaceae, which comprises about 2000 species of tropical and subtropical trees, shrubs and vines that have been classified into 140 genera (Chapman 1984) . Lychee has been shown to possess variable diploid chromosome numbers where 2n = 28, 30, 32. The variation in chromosome number is thought to be because the modern species had more than one wild progenitor. Lychee cultivation was reported since 1500 BC by the people of Malayan descent and has been growing for thousands of years in southern Guangdong province of China. The first reference to this fruit is available in the literature of the Han dynasty (140 BC to 86 BC). It is sure that lychee is native of South China, but, according to Blume, Cochin-China and the Philippine islands are the lands of its origin (Popenoe 1920) . It is also reported to have originated in China's Kwangtung and Fukien provinces and have been cultivated in China for about forty centuries (Ochse et al. 1961) . A monograph written by Tsai Hsiang in 1059 AD is considered to be the first publication in the world devoted to this fruit. However, according to Walter T. Swingle, the first published work of fruit culture was written by a Chinese scholar in 1056 AD, on the varieties of lychee. From China it reached Burma (Myanmar) by the end of the seventeenth century and was introduced in India about 100 years later. Lychee reached Madagascar and Mauritius around 1870 and was introduced in Hawaii in 1873 by a Chinese trader. It arrived in Florida, from India, between 1870 and 1880 and was introduced in California in 1897. Lychee was reported to be brought to Australia by Chinese migrants in 1954 and arrived in Israel sometime between 1930 and 1940. Presently, lychee is grown in Central and South America, parts of Africa and throughout Asia. China, India, South Africa, Australia, Mauritius, Madagascar and Thailand are now the major lychee-producing countries in the world.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 284, "end": 298, "text": "(Chapman 1984)", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}, {"start": 916, "end": 930, "text": "(Popenoe 1920)", "ref_id": "BIBREF78"}, {"start": 1074, "end": 1093, "text": "(Ochse et al. 1961)", "ref_id": "BIBREF65"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Origin and History"}, {"text": "Lychee plantation requires a warm subtropical to tropical climate (Rivera-Lo'pez et al. 1999) .

Bedana and China have very thick skin, whereas Rose Scented and Shahi have thin skin. Skin surface at maturity also varies being smooth, swelling and sharp pointed. Protuberances of pericarp (skin) can be smooth as in Bedana or sharply pointed as in China. The presence and absence of seed as well as structure and size of seeds also vary from cultivar to cultivar, but it is also influenced by the environmental conditions. In Rose Scented and Bedana, a high proportion of chicken-tongued seeds is observed, while China has bold seeds. The harvest season lasts 5-10 weeks for a range of cultivars in any one location. Lychee cultivars can be broadly classified as early, mid or late maturing, although the order varies from year to year, depending on seasonal conditions. Table 5 .1 enlists the lychee cultivars grown in different countries. According to the Indian Horticulture Database (2014), Indian lychee is exported to China (87 MT), Thailand (19 MT) and Mauritius (1MT). Leaves The leaves are alternative and compound, with two to five leaflets. The leaflets are oblong and 5-15 cm long. The foliage comprises 2-4 pairs of leaflets, which are 3-6 in. long, coriaceous, elliptic-oblong to lanceolate, shortly acute, glabrous and shining above and glaucescent beneath.

There are usually two stages of male flowering overlapping with the female cycle: a true male flower first and then a functionally male flower that opens towards the end of the flowering period. The second male flower has a rudimentary bicarpellate pistil. This is absent in the first stage. Functionally, female flowers have 6-10 staminodes and a functional, bicarpellate pistil ( Fig. 5 .2). The last stage of male flowering generally supplies most of the pollen used to fertilize the female flowers. The ovary is bilobed, compressed and silky; usually only one lobe develops into a fruit. The stigma is bilobed. According to their hermaphrodite nature, flowers are classified into three classes, viz. type I, type II and type III. Type I and type III flowers are male, while type II flowers function as a fruit-bearing female. Most of the flowers are of type III and only 20 % of the flowers are of fruit producing type II females.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [{"start": 651, "end": 657, "text": "Fig. 5", "ref_id": "FIGREF3"}], "section": "Classification of Major Lychee Cultivars"}, {"text": "Fruit Fruits are highly variable, depending on the cultivar (Fig. 5 .3). They can be round, ovoid or heart shaped and from 2.0 to 3.5 cm in diameter. The skin can be smooth or rough with distinct protuberances, thick or thin and pink red, bright red or purple red. The flesh or aril is an outgrowth of the outer cells of the seed coat (outer integument), and in good cultivars may comprise 80% of fruit weight. The aril is generally translucent white, juicy or firm and sweet and aromatic in better cultivars. Many cultivars can be distinguished by their flavour and aroma. The fruit contains a single dark brown seed 6-12 mm wide and 10-23 mm long. Some cultivars have a high proportion of aborted seeds and thus a high flesh recovery. They are popular in the marketplace, especially in Asia. There are a few cultivars that produce nearly seedless fruit, although the fruit usually weighs less than 10 g. The fruit shape of some cultivars is very distinctive. The round fruit of Kwai May Pink distinguishes it from the egg shape of Tai So or the heart shape of Haak Yip. The shoulders of the fruit can be smooth or flat as in Wai Chee and Kwai May Pink or uneven as in Souey Tung and Bengal. The apex or tip of the fruit can be round as in Kwai May Pink and Wai Chee, obtuse or blunt as in Souey Tung and Brewster or pointed as in Bengal.

Lychee is mainly consumed fresh, but different products like canned lychee, squash, cordial, syrup, jam, jelly and juice are also manufactured and marketed. It can be dried or dehydrated (lychee nuts) or used in ice creams and sorbets (Hui, 2008; Salunke and Desai 1984) . Dried lychee is very popular among the Chinese. In China, various other products such as pickles and wine are also made from lychee. The food value of lychee mainly lies in its sugar content which varies from variety to variety. Depending upon the variety and climate, the fruit contains 60% juice, 8% rag, 19% seed and 13% skin. Apart from proteins, fats, carbohydrates, minerals, fibrous matter, calcium, phosphorus, iron and carotene, the fruit is also rich in vitamin B1, riboflavin and vitamin C (Table 5 .3). Lychee is also an excellent source of anti-oxidants which protects the body from harmful free radicals. Lychee flesh is loaded with nutritional and functional compounds. According to the data released by USDA, 100 g of lychee flesh contains 16.5 g sugars, 276 kilojoule energy, 0.83 g protein, 0.44 g fat, 0.44 g ash, 1.3 g edible (Wall 2006) . Apart from nutritional value, lychee flesh improves digestion and blood circulation, moistens skin and alleviates symptom of anaemia (Chi et al. 2005) . However, active compounds and mechanisms of these functions are unknown. Anti-oxidant activity of lychee flesh is well documented. In addition to vitamin C and E, lychee flesh contains anti-oxidant polysaccharides (Wu et al. 2004 ) and flavonoids including procyanidin A2 and leucocyanidin (Rooyen and Redelinghuys 1983) . Polysaccharides in lychee flesh are effective to eradicate O 2 and reported to significantly suppress lipid peroxidation in rat liver (Wu et al. 2004 ). However, based on Chinese traditional medicine, lychee flesh is a typical 'heating' food.

Two flavonoids in lychee skin especially anthocyanins and procyanidins contribute to the major part of its anti-oxidant activity (Luximon-Ramma et al. 2003) . Zhao et al. (2006) found procyanidin B2 was stronger in scavenging hydroxyl free radical and superoxgen anion than procyanidin B4 and epicatechin, while epicatechin is more active in eradicating DPPH than the other two flavonoids. Lychee fruit development is accompanied by changes in chemical compositions including phenolic substances (Huang and Wu 2006) . Hence, anti-oxidant activity in the skin at different maturity differs. Zheng et al. (2003) found skin of immature fruit had a much stronger anti-oxidant activity than that of mature fruit.
