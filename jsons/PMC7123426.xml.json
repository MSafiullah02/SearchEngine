The country was formerly administered by a huge, bureaucratic, communist politburo. It has undergone a post-Mao era\u2019s reform in 1978 to incorporate economic growth within its own fragmented, authoritarian polity (McGregor 2011; Zhao 2008). As a consequence, at the start of Deng Xiaoping\u2019s economic reform and openness policy, the industrialized China lifted around 500 million of its 1.3 billion citizens out of poverty (World Bank 2015; French and Crabbe 2010, p. XXIV). However, China maintains its system of authoritarianism, notwithstanding regular cries for \u201cWestern style democracy\u201d by Chinese students and citizens such as those of the Tiananmen Square protest in April 1989 (Leslie 2014) or demands for direct election of the Hong Kong governor by the citizens of Hong Kong during the so-called umbrella movement in the Fall of 2014 (So and Ngo 2014).",

Hong Kong, according to Economic and Trade Information, is the world\u2019s eighth largest trading economy and the tenth largest exporter of commercial services. It has the most services-oriented economy, with service sectors accounting for more than 90 percent of its GDP. It is the second largest recipient of foreign direct investment (FDI) in Asia, after mainland China, and the third largest source of FDI in Asia, after Japan and mainland China (Hong Kong Trade Development Council 2015).",

The emergence of communicable diseases has been well documented in good case studies, such as those of bubonic plague in the nineteenth century (Pryor 1975, pp. 61\u201370) and the epidemics or pandemics in the contemporary globalization period of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), bird flu or H5N1, HIV/AIDS, or even persistent tuberculosis and malaria.

According to Hopkins (2002), globalization is a new term that denotes ongoing historical processes from before the 1500s up to the present day. According to Lie (2003, pp. 101\u2013116), globalization can be understood as a flow of cultural products from one location to another. The location can be nations, communities, institutions, or individuals. Unfortunately, the global flows cannot be smooth because of nation states\u2019 boundaries, geo-cultural boundaries, such as East and West, and geo-economic boundaries, such as the North\u2013South divide (Powell and Steel 2011). Globalization makes some regions become centers of economic growth while others are outliers or closer to the periphery. This affects the life of the people in those regions a great deal. Harris and Seid (2004) explain that the transition from agrarian to industrial societies in most developing countries has been slower and more problematic than that in the developed nations as there are many people who did not benefit from the developments.",

Social determinants that can be considered as negative consequences of globalization contributing to NCDs among populations include migration of the population from traditional means of subsistence, urbanization without provision of standard housing and employment, and large unregulated marketing of tobacco products and alcoholic beverages (Harris and Seid 2004, p. 16; Yacht and Beaglehole 2004, pp. 214\u2013215). The globalized world\u2014equipped with high-speed transportation\u2014has resulted in mobility and migration being deemed responsible for the emergence of new patterns of infectious diseases and speeding up the transmission rate of those diseases. Major infectious diseases have killed large populations: small pox (500 million people), measles (200 million), Spanish flu (80 million), Bubonic plague (75 million), AIDS (40 million), and typhus (4 million) (WHO 2015). Although the incidence of infectious diseases dropped from 40 percent to 17.5 percent between 1990 and 2010, new diseases have emerged at the rate of one or more per year since the 1970s. According to the World Health Organization (2015), several new infectious diseases are, for instance, the Severe acute respiratory associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV), henipaviruses (hendra and nipah), avian influenza virus, and the H1N1 virus (swine influenza). There are also historic, infectious diseases that are re-emerging, such as West Nile fever, human monkey pox, dengue, TB, and malaria.",

Mainland China and Hong Kong have evolved in many phases of globalization, and that seems to be a mixed blessing as the positive aspects of globalization, in terms of the social and political reach of the economic reform, have enhanced the life expectancy at birth of an average mainlander from 69 years in 1990 to 75.2 years in 2012, and stagnated the mortality at birth of mainland Chinese infants (World Health Organization 2014, p. 60). Life expectancy at birth of a Hong Kongers is 80.7 years for males and 86.4 years for females. Also, the infant mortality rates of Hong Kong ranked sixth lowest in the world (Pearson Education 2013) thanks to the advances in public health and medical technology. However, inequalities in income, global environmental changes, and changes in lifestyle as well as communications that come with globalization take tolls on public health. Specifically in China, health can be examined through five pathways, as suggested by Harris and Seid (2004, p. 11): (a) economic growth, income distribution, and poverty; (b) democracy and governance; (c) health services; (d) nutrition and food security; and (e) other risk or mitigating factors.",

The more affluent Hong Kongers witness excess weight and obesity among 48.3 percent of males and 31.4 percent of females. Obesity among children in both mainland China and in Hong Kong is on the rise. It is also worth noticing that 6.9 percent of male Chinese children are obese, which is twice the percentage of the male adults (The Economist 2014), and one out of every five children in Hong Kong is obese (South China Morning Post 2015). It is also worth noting that obesity is expanding more in the rural areas than in the cities, as many farmers have sold their landholdings for development and moved to more sedentary lifestyles (The Economist 2014). The cause of obesity in cities in China is due to the lack of public spaces for exercise, and the changes in eating patterns as people consume more meat, potatoes, cow\u2019s milk, beers, fast food/deep-fried foods than in the past; hence, oils and fats (especially transfat or hydrogenated fat used for producing margarine), monosodium glutamate, sugar, and salt are on the increase while not enough grains are being consumed (French and Crabbe 2010, pp. 49\u201373, 107).

Although the government executed the plan to battle the plague efficiently, this approach earned distrust and resistance from the local residents. Ng (2014, p. 149) describes how Chinese families were known to hide the sick and even dead bodies in their homes to evade forced removal and mass burial, and many of them migrated to China. This incident emphasized that the policymakers have to ensure a good two-way communication and understand the local culture to gain acceptance and cooperation by the locals for the health policy to be successful.",

At the same time, a structural intervention approach to public health was implemented when the housing authority resettled the slum dwellers to standard residential areas. Hong Kong also collaborated with international organizations like WHO to create outreach services. It also limited the number of migrants from mainland China. The health communication strategy\u2014combining social marketing of vaccinations with behavioral change interventions\u2014came up with promotional activities such as giving away gifts to the children who had been vaccinated. This strategy was used to battle cholera and hepatitis infections (MacPherson 2008, pp. 23\u201324).

The health communication policy in this period was top-down, authoritarian, and relied on one-way communication. Mao dictated the public health policy in the \u2018anti-schistosomiasis campaign\u2019 in 1958, and came up with his own form of pest control which included sparrows as pests.

(2014, pp. 267\u2013284) studied the Chinese newspapers\u2019 coverage of HIV transmissions over a decade (2000\u201310) and came up with the finding that HIV stigmatization in Chinese newspaper was high. The media labeled and stereotyped PLWHA and their relatives. Zhang (2010, pp. 177\u2013194) studied the source of HIV-related stigma and discrimination in China. These, according to him, can be traced to ideas and metaphors associated with the attitudes of government agencies, news media, and health professionals; stigma is exacerbating the HIV/AIDS epidemic as the infected people will not disclose their status, not even to their intimate partners, for fear of being outcast and losing income. Thus, health communication regarding HIV/AIDS in China is pretty negative and impedes the progress of public health. Shi and Chen (2014, p. 295) conducted a quantitative content analysis about PLWHA on Weibo, the Chinese social networking application equivalent to Twitter, and found that more than half of the messages in the HIV/AIDS Weibo Group were about social support, either informational or emotional.",

Huang (2010, pp. 47, 60) conducted ethnographic studies among female sex workers in China from 1996\u20132008 and contended that health knowledge alone will not be sufficient to change HIV risk-taking behavior. Promoting condom use among sex workers often failed to consider the complex power relations between new sex workers from poor areas, their handlers, and the customers who wanted unprotected sex (Huang 2010, pp. 59\u201360), and the government policy which used condoms as legal evidence to arrest and fine a sex worker before 2001. The nationwide condom use in local hotels was launched in 2004 and in entertainment areas in 2006 (Huang 2010, p. 62). This is a structural change intervention in the fight against HIV/AIDS. In 2003, the Chinese government launched the \u201cfour frees, one care\u201d program consisting of free voluntary HIV testing and counseling; free anti-retroviral drugs for the poor, free medication for all pregnant PLWH, and free schooling for the orphans of people who have died of AIDS (Huang 2010, p. 94). The government also provides screening to prevent bloodborne infections, and a needle exchange program (Huang 2010, p. 94). This has been a biomedical intervention. The government launched a nationwide awareness and safe sex campaign, which was a social marketing communication strategy. From the above mentioned stigmatization studies, there is a need for more in-depth content analyses of the messages the government sent out to assess their relevance and impact.",

The political and economic environments influence the public health policy. Public health during outbreaks should be transparent and timely. Thanks to advances in epidemiological and microbiological research, which form a pivotal part of biomedical intervention, disease control and prevention are possible. However, the examples of disease outbreaks in China show that exclusively top-down command and lack of coherent communication between and among the responsible authorities can aggravate the situation. From the analyses of the public health policies of China, one can see that the civic organizations were not encouraged in China to check and balance the information from the authorities and help monitor the outbreaks. Participation is thus lacking in the health communication process in China. Advocacy-communication can be seen from the social networking sites such as Weibo and in microblogging. Mostly, behavior change interventions and school-based interventions took place for introduction of vaccination and promoting a hygienic environment. Capacity building, domestically in China and with Hong Kong Special Administrative Region or with other nations in times of a health crisis, have always proven to be effective. Law enforcement should be strengthened. Moral ethics should be on the agenda of media advocacy to make the citizens and government officials realize that one cannot make profits at the cost of other people\u2019s lives, and that one should not discriminate or victimize others (Malikhao 2016). Public ethics and vigilance on any issue that affects people\u2019s wellness and well-being should be on the top agenda of communication and public health to ensure a good environment and food safety as well as a public space for recreation and well-being.",
