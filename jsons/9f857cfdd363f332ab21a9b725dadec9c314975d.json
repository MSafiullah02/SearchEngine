The Sars-CoV-2 cluster in the North of Italy was not yet identified. Two days later, after reports of patients with COVID-19 from the local area, bronchoalveolar lavage was sent for SARS-CoV-2 testing and was found to be positive. Since then, our 10-bed intensive care unit (ICU) has been transformed in a COVID unit. The other ICU patients were tested for SARS-CoV-2 and were found negative, thus they were transferred to an alternative \"clean\" ICU. After one month, we have treated a total of 25 patients with SARS-Cov-2 in our ICU. Meanwhile, four other COVID-ICUs were created in the hospital.",

            "text": "This NAS increase may be due to several clinical and environmental factors. First of all, we used prone positioning (PP) in all COVID-19 patients. This technique requires at least five health-care workers to be performed safely (Lucchini et al., 2019b) . In this period, with COVID-19 patients, we managed up to seven patients simultaneously in the prone position. For mechanically ventilated adults with moderate to severe ARDS due toCOVID-19, guidelines suggest prone positioning sessions of 12 to 16 hours (Alhazzani et al., 2020) Furthermore, with COVID-19 patients, health-care workers have an elevated risk of exposure and the use of personal protective equipment (PPE) is mandatory. Negative pressure rooms are recommended for performing aerosol-generating procedures on ICU patients with COVID-19 (Alhazzani et al., 2020) . Unfortunately, our ICU does not feature negative pressure rooms. For this reason, the whole ICU clinical area (bed unit, nurses' station, meeting area, etc.) has been considered as a \"contaminated area\". Two separate areas have been created for donning (putting on) and doffing (taking off) heath care workers' PPE. The need for PPE dramatically increases nursing workload and fatigue. Use of protective devices increases body temperature and is tolerable only for a few hours. Thus, we re-organised shifts to allow resting for one nurse at a time outside the \"contaminated area\", in order to guarantee a rotation every 2-3 hours for operators dedicated to isolated patients.",

More complex procedures, as intubation, haemofiltration and Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) were managed only by a team of Critical Care Nurses, while the nurses from the operating theatre managed stable patients with lower nursing complexity. In order to guarantee a safe PP procedure, at least three experienced operators (critical care nurses and/or Intensivist physicians) were present during each prone position manoeuvre. Finally, some activities related to the humanisation of care in ICU, have been maintained, even in these dramatic conditions. The Italian Government has banned relatives from COVID-19 intensive care units. For this reason, we implemented video calls between patients and relatives to restore a visual contact. Furthermore, our experience with the use of an ICU diary, was interrupted in the first two weeks. In the last days of March, we reactivated this project in digital format (Scruth et al., 2017) , so we could send an ICU diary, without infectious risks, to the patient and his family upon discharge from the hospital. In this phase all the diary notes were written only by nurses and physicians.",

The ideal nurse-to-patient ratio for these patients should be around 1:1.5. Unfortunately, the need to provide an enormous amount of new ICU beds makes it impossible to guarantee this nurse-to-patient ratio. Therefore, we suggest to colleagues worldwide to make an effort to increase the ICU nursing staff, starting to train registered nurses from general wards to perform basic ICU procedures and to dedicate intensive care nurses to manage more complex procedures, in order to be prepared to face the epidemic.
