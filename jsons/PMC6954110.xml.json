            "text": "Influenza A viruses, which belong to the family Orthomyxoviridae, have a single-stranded negative-sense RNA genome consisting of eight segments.1 They are important zoonotic pathogens, with high morbidity in pigs, horses, poultry, and humans.2 Influenza A viruses have two envelope glycoproteins (GPs), hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA), and are divided into subtypes based on antigenicity. Subtypes H1-16 HA and N1-9 NA have been isolated from water birds, the natural reservoir of influenza A viruses.3,4 Until 1997, avian influenza A viruses were considered unlikely to be transmitted directly to humans because they do not bind the human sialic acid-\u03b12,6-galactose (SA\u03b12,6Gal) receptor with high affinity.5 However, highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) viruses can be transmitted from wild birds upon close contact causing sporadic outbreaks in domestic poultry. This happened for the first time in 1997 in Hong Kong when 18 human cases of respiratory illness, including six fatalities, were caused by HPAI subtype H5N1 viruses.6\u20138 Since then, 860 human cases, with 454 deaths (~53% case fatality rate), have been reported by the World Health Organization.9 Furthermore, some reassortant H5 viruses with different NA subtypes (e.g. H5N2, H5N8, and H5N6) originated from the same ancestral H5N1 virus, and have recently emerged in China and spread to other countries in Eurasia and North America.10\u201315 Since some HPAI viruses are resistant to the currently available treatment options for influenza A virus infections namely oseltamivir, amantadine, and interferon (IFN),16,17 the development of vaccines is an ongoing effort of high priority for public health to be prepared for a potential epidemic or pandemic of HPAI.",

Mice were vaccinated with a single dose or prime/boost regimen of the different vaccine candidates and challenged with a lethal dose of homologous H5N1 virus.

This sHAzip antigen has previously been shown to be protective in chickens as a subunit vaccine.34 We also generated a VSV vector expressing the H5N1 HAfl alone without the EBOV GP (VSV-HAfl; Fig. 1a)36 in order to control for the contribution of the EBOV GP to vaccine efficacy. Expression of the different H5 antigens from the VSV vectors was confirmed by subjecting the supernatant of infected cells to SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting (Fig. 1b, Supplementary Fig. 1). First, we showed the presence of VSV particles by detecting the VSV matrix (M) protein in the supernatant of infected cells (Fig. 1b, Supplementary Fig. 1). The incorporation of EBOV GP into VSV particles differed among the vectors and was, as expected, highest for VSV-EBOV for which it is the only surface protein and antigen encoded by this vector (Fig. 1b, Supplementary Fig. 1). Expression of sHAzip was verified by detecting the non-cleaved sHA0 precursor likely secreted from infected cells. HAfl expression was demonstrated by detecting the furin-cleaved fragment HA1 in mature spikes on VSV particles. As expected, the incorporation of HAfl into recombinant VSV particles was much stronger for VSV-HAfl compared to VSV-EBOV-HAfl, likely because it is the only surface GP and encoded antigen in the VSV vector.",

For this, we used the day 0 mouse serum samples and a panel of nine attenuated candidate vaccine influenza viruses encoding HAs belonging to different H5 clades that were isolated from geographically distinct locations (Supplementary Table 1). We found that prime/boost vaccination with VSV-EBOV-HAfl or VSV-HAfl elicited cross-neutralizing antibodies against all tested clades (Table 1). Cross-neutralizing antibodies were also detected in the single-dose vaccination group of these two vaccines; however, and similar to the total HA-specific IgG, levels were lower and cross-neutralization was not detected for all clades (Table 1). In contrast, all other vaccines expressing the sHA/sHAzip antigen revealed no cross-neutralizing activities after administration of a single-dose and limited cross-neutralizing activity after the prime/boost. These results demonstrated that the VSV-based vaccines expressing HAfl induce more potent cross-neutralizing antibodies than the sHA/sHAzip antigens.",

Despite promising results from previous studies in chickens showing that adjuvanted subunit vaccines consisting of the trimeric H5 sHA (sHAzip) induced high levels of cross-neutralizing antibodies (clade 1 and 2.3.4),34,35 we could not demonstrate convincing protection with the sHAzip-expressing VSV vectors in this study (Fig. 2, Supplementary Fig. 2C). In fact, VSV-sHA-EBOV without the trimerization sequence performed better than the sHAzip-expressing vectors with complete protection following prime/boost vaccination (Supplementary Fig. 2C). In contrast to all the sHA-based vaccines, single doses of the VSV-EBOV-HAfl or VSV-HAfl vectors were sufficient to provide complete protection from lethal homologous H5N1 challenge in mice (Fig. 2). Thus, in our study, the VSV vectors expressing HAfl are superior over those expressing sHA or sHAzip.",

The sHA with leucine zipper (sHAzip) was constructed of the sHA ORF by adding a GCN4pll sequence for trimerization.35 All ORFs were cloned into the pATX-VSV-EBOV plasmid encoding the EBOV-Mayinga GP.53 Replication-competent recombinant VSVs (VSV-EBOV-sHAzip, VSV-sHAzip-EBOV, VSV-sHA-EBOV, VSV-EBOV-HAfl, and VSV-HAfl) were generated as described previously.24 The complete sequence of the VSV vaccines was confirmed by Sanger sequencing.
