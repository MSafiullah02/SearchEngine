These threats have ranged from shoe bombs to dirty bombs to explosives that can be assembled in flight with liquids, aerosols and gels. In every instance the global community has reacted with pre emptive and preventive measures which prohibit any material on board which might seemingly endanger the safety of flight. Some jurisdictions have even gone to extremes in prohibiting human breast milk and prescriptive medications on board.",

The Air Transport Association (ATA), in its 2002 State of the United States Airline Industry Statement, advised that, in the United States, the combined impact of the 2001 economic downturn and the precipitous decline in air travel following the 11 September 2001 attacks on the United States resulted in devastating losses for the airline industry which are likely to exceed $7 billion and continue through 2002.1 Of course, the overall picture, which portended a certain inevitable gloom for the air transport industry, was not the exclusive legacy of United States\u2019 carriers. It applied worldwide, as was seen in the abrupt downfall of air traffic globally during 2001. The retaliation by the world community against terrorism, which is an ongoing feature in world affairs, increased the airline passenger\u2019s fear and reluctance to use air transport. In most instances in commercial aircraft purchasing, air carriers cancelled or postponed their new aircraft requisition orders. Many carriers, particularly in developing countries, were seen revisiting their cost structures and downsizing their human resource bases. It is incontrovertible that another similar event or series of events will inevitably plunge the aviation industry into similar despair and destitution.",

The Resolution also urged all Contracting States to make contributions in the form of financial or human resources to ICAO\u2019s aviation security mechanism to support and strengthen the combat against terrorism and unlawful interference in civil aviation; called on Contracting States to agree on special funding for urgent action by ICAO in the field of aviation security; and directed the Council to develop proposals and take appropriate decisions for a more stable funding of ICAO action in the field of aviation security, including appropriate remedial action.",

The Conference concluded that the events of 11 September 2001 have had a major negative impact on world economies and an impact on air transport which is unparalleled in history and restoration of consumer confidence in air transport and assurance of the long-term health of the air transport industry are both vital, and many States have already initiated a range of measures to this effect. It was also the view of the Conference that the effective application of enhanced uniform security measures, commensurate with the threat, will help to restore confidence in air transport, but these measures will need to be passenger and cargo user-friendly and not overly costly for the industry and its consumers if traffic growth is to be regenerated. Accordingly, the Conference recommended that consistent with Assembly Resolution A33-1, States should intensify their efforts to achieve the full implementation and enforcement of the multilateral conventions on aviation security as well as of the ICAO Standards and Recommended Practices (SARPs) relating to aviation security and take within their territories appropriate additional security measures which are commensurate with the level of threat and are cost effective. Since restoration of confidence in air transport is a collective responsibility, the Conference called upon States to enhance international cooperation in aviation security and assist developing countries to the extent possible.",

It was also considered useful to establish regional and sub-regional approaches which could make a significant contribution to ICAO\u2019s aviation security activities. The Conference concluded that aviation security was a responsibility of Contracting States, and States which outsource aviation security programmes should therefore ensure that adequate governmental control and supervision are in place. The Conference also observed that, since gaps and inadequacies appear to exist in international aviation security instruments with regard to new and emerging threats to civil aviation, further study was needed in this regard. There was a need for a comprehensive ICAO Aviation Security Plan of Action for strengthening aviation security, through a reinforced AVSEC mechanism, an ICAO aviation security audit programme, technical cooperation projects, promotion of aviation security quality control functions and appropriate performance indicators.",

It was the view of the Conference that the ability to determine whether an airport or State is in compliance will require that auditors have a solid aviation security background and be sufficiently trained and certified by ICAO to ensure that auditing is conducted in a consistent and objective manner. The Conference was strongly convinced that such an audit programme should be undertaken under the auspices of ICAO\u2019s AVSEC Mechanism which could be guided by proven and successful concepts used in viable programmes already developed by the European Civil Aviation Conference (ECAC), the United States and other States in the development of the framework for a security audit programme.",

It was recommended that all States be notified of a completed audit, that ICAO Headquarters be the repository for full audit reports and that the sharing of audit reports between States take place on a bilateral or multilateral basis. States were required, under such a programme, to commit to provide ICAO with national AVSEC findings based on a harmonized procedure to be developed by ICAO as early as possible.

However, for the longer term a more stable means of funding the ICAO Aviation Security Plan of Action would be either through an increase of the assessment to the ICAO General Fund for the following triennia, or by a long-term commitment, on a voluntary basis, of systematic contributions according to an approved suggested level of contribution, to be determined by the Council, by all States. With regard to recouping policies of States, the Conference observed and confirmed that ICAO\u2019s policy and guidance material on cost recovery of security services at airports in ICAO\u2019s Policies on Charges for Airports and Air Navigation Services (Doc 9082/6) and the Airport Economics Manual (Doc 9562) remained valid, although there was a need for development of additional policy and guidance material on cost recovery of security measures with regard to air navigation services complementary to that which already exists with respect to airport security charges.

It was felt that one of the ways in which this could be achieved was by ICAO promoting the use of the ICAO Objectives Implementation Mechanism as a means for States to obtain technical cooperation, as required for the rectification of deficiencies identified during aviation security evaluations and audits and urgently pursuing the development and implementation of an International Financial Facility for Aviation Safety (IFFAS),4 to encompass not only safety but also security. Another significant function of ICAO was to elaborate on its policy and guidance material on cost recovery of security services, notably to include development of policy and guidance material on cost recovery, through charges, of security measures with regard to air navigation services and explore the issue of using security charges as a means of recovering the cost of ICAO assistance when it is provided to States for security development projects.",

The first phase was the modernist era as it prevailed when the Convention on International Civil Aviation was signed at Chicago on 7 December 1944, which was centred on State sovereignty6 and the widely accepted post-war view that the development of international civil aviation can greatly help to create and preserve friendship and understanding among the nations and peoples of the world, yet its abuse can become a threat to general security.7 This essentially modernist philosophy focussed on the importance of the State as the ultimate sovereign authority which can overrule considerations of international community welfare if they clashed with the domestic interests of the State. It gave way, in the 1960s and 1970s to a post-modernist era of recognition of the individual as a global citizen whose interests at public international law were considered paramount over considerations of individual State interests.",

The actions of Schenk were considered to constitute an offence under the Espionage Act of 1917. Justice Holmes stated:\nThe question in every case is whether the words used are used in such circumstances and are of such a nature as to create a clear and present danger that they will bring about the substantive evils that Congress has a right to prevent. It is a question of proximity and degree. When a nation is at war many things that might be said in times of peace are such a hindrance to its effort that their utterance will not be endured so long as men fight and that no court could regard them as protected by any constitutional right.12\n\n",

A case in point is the 2002 targeted killing of a military wing leader of Hamas who was known to be planning and ordering numerous successful bombings against civilians. He was also known to have been planning attacks that were unprecedented in size and consequences. In the process, he was using young children as human shields to carry out suicide attacks against Israel. The Israelis believed that killing the Hamas military leader would thwart the planned attacks and save hundreds of innocent lives. The difficulty in killing this terrorist was that he was constantly changing his living quarters. Often his wife slept beside him, exposing herself, an \u201cuninvolved\u201d person, to the possibility of being killed in an attack against the terrorist. The decision was therefore taken to order a hit only when the terrorist was alone. In one instance, a strike was called off when it was discovered he was with family members. However, when the strike was eventually carried out, the rocket killed not only the terrorist but also his wife, 14-year-old daughter and several others. Israel later issued a statement saying that if they had known the strike action would have resulted in collateral damage the attack would never have taken place.",

On another aviation platform, Giovanni Bisignani, Director General and CEO of the International Air Transport Association (IATA) stressed at its Annual General Meeting held in Vancouver from 3 to 5 June 2007 that the industry has changed tremendously in five years since 9/11. Bisignani stated that, six years after the tragic events of 2001, air travel was much more secure but there were unlimited ways to attack the aircraft integrity. He added that there was no perfect security system and terrorists change tactics and weapons. Bisignani rightly pointed out that terrorists are studying what measures the industry is adopting; and that all the air industry can do is make the system strong enough to constitute sufficient deterrent and make aircraft a harder target to hit.",

It was suggested that States adopt an approach providing for a baseline regime, but with the addition of unpredictable measures, thus achieving a balance between certainty and unpredictability. With regard to an amendment to Annex 17 in this regard, the need for introducing unpredictability into the aviation security regime was considered, and it was agreed that unpredictability should be promoted in principle but not prescribed. The Panel suggested that if an Annex 17 specification related to unpredictability were to be developed, it would be necessary to ensure that the introduction of this concept by States does not diminish the level of security or result in delays for passengers. Further, the Panel noted that appropriate guidance material may be required to address the potential negative impact of introducing the concept of unpredictability, and proposed the development of guidance material related to unpredictability prior to the introduction of an amendment to Annex 17.",

In 1999, the University of Pittsburgh\u2019s Center for Biomedical Informatics deployed the first automated bioterrorism detection system, called RODS (Real-Time Outbreak Disease Surveillance). RODS is designed to draw collect data from many data sources and use them to perform signal detection, that is, to detect a possible bioterrorism event at the earliest possible moment. RODS, and other similar systems, collect data from sources including clinical data, laboratory data, and data from over-the-counter drug sales. In 2000, Michael Wagner, the co director of the RODS laboratory, and Ron Aryel, a subcontractor, conceived of the idea of obtaining live data feeds from \u201cnon-traditional\u201d (non-health-care) data sources.

The surface to air MANPAD is a light weapon which offers very little warning before impact, and is often destructive and lethal.45 They are cheap, easily carried, handled and concealed. It is claimed that there are at least 100,000 and possibly in excess of 500,000 systems in inventories around the world and several thousands of these are vulnerable to theft from State authorities.46 It is also claimed that there is a 70% chance that a civil aircraft will be destroyed if hit by a MANPAD.47 A study conducted and published in early 2005 by the Rand Corporation concludes that, based on the effects of the attacks of 11 September 2001, it is plausible for air travel in the United States to fall by 15\u201320% after a successful MANPADS attack on a commercial airliner in the United States.48 The international aviation community is aware that civil aircraft are particularly vulnerable to hand held ground to air missiles and that susceptibility avoidance techniques (calculated to avoid being hit) and vulnerability avoidance (survival after being hit) systems must be in place. This is particularly so since tracking the proliferation of MANPADS is difficult since any intelligence gathered on this particular threat is usually ex post facto, through the recovery of launchers or fragments from expended missiles.

Over the past 35 years, significant developments have taken place in dangerous weapons systems creating more opportunities for terrorists. The ready acceptance of new modern technologies by the international community and our growing dependence on them have created many targets, such as nuclear and civil aircraft in flight. Similarly, developments in electronics and microelectronics, and the trend towards miniaturization and simplification have resulted in a greater availability of tactical weapons with longer ranges and more accuracy that are also simpler to operate. One of the most effective developments in individual weaponry is portable, precision-guided munitions (PGMs), which are lightweight and easy to operate. They can usually be carried and operated by a single person. The United States-made Stinger, the British-made Blowpipe and the Russian-made SA-7 missiles are examples of these smaller weapons. These are shoulder-fired, anti-aircraft missiles that have infra-red, heat-seeking sensors in the projectile that guide it to the heat emitted from an aircraft engine. It is known that more than 60 States possess SA-7 missiles and there is no doubt that most of them maintain strict security measures to prevent the outflow of the weapons. However, it has been alleged that some States, including Libya, have supplied PGMs to terrorist organizations. It is incontrovertible that in the hands of terrorists these missiles are not likely to be used against conventional targets such as tanks and military fighter aircraft.

Although modern technologies clearly aid terrorists in terms of weapons and targets, technology can also be used against terrorists. Governments which are endowed with the necessary technology can keep track of terrorist organizations and their movements with the aid of computers. At the same time, electronic collection methods and signals intelligence afford the possibility of eavesdropping on and intercepting terrorist communications, leading to better predictions of their operations. One of the instances where intelligence gathering has worked well to prevent terrorism occurred in September 1984, when the Provisional IRA spent an estimated \u00a31.5 million in the United States on a massive shipment of seven tons of arms. With the help of an informer about a forthcoming shipment of weapons, including rockets, to the Provisional IRA from the United States, the FBI informed British intelligence, who in turn contacted the Irish, and the ship carrying the arms was tracked by a US satellite orbiting 300 km above the earth. The satellite photographed the transfer of the arms to a trawler. Finally, two Irish Navy vessels intercepted the trawler and British security forces arrested the crew.51 This incident shows that intelligence gathering with the help of high technology can cut off the transfer of missiles and other weapons to terrorists.",

One good example is the measure taken by the British government which, immediately after the discovery of 20 SA-7s in the coaster Eksund, which was intercepted by French authorities off the coast of Brittany in November 1987 when bound for the IRA, fitted all British Army helicopters flying in Northern Ireland with electronic and other decoy systems to confuse the missile\u2019s heat-seeking guidance system. These included the US-made Saunders, AN/ALG 144. This system, when linked to the Tracor AN/ALE 40 chaff dispenser, works by jamming the missile\u2019s homing radar and sending infra-red flares and chaff to act as a decoy for the heat-seeking device.52 The system is used by both the US and the Israeli Armies, which have been well-pleased with its performance. Until the British realised that the IRA might be in possession of SAMs, the Ministry of Defense hesitated to install such a system because of the high cost involved, and its decision to do so shows the seriousness of the threat. Another example of a good counter-measure is the response of El Al airlines to the threat of such an attack which included the installation of electronic countermeasure equipment similar to that employed on military aircraft to divert surface-to-air missiles.53 However the problem is that these countermeasures are not yet fully effective, although they could minimize the threat. Hence there is a need to proceed diligently with the development of systems that are guaranteed to be able to prevent this type of attack against civil aviation.",

The Wassenaar Arrangement complements and reinforces, without duplication, the existing control regimes for weapons of mass destruction and their delivery systems, as well as other internationally recognized measures designed to promote transparency and greater responsibility, by focusing on the threats to international and regional peace and security which may arise from transfers of armaments and sensitive dual-use goods and technologies where the risks are judged greatest. It is also calculated to enhance co-operation in order to prevent the acquisition of armaments and sensitive dual-use items for military end-uses, if the situation in a region or the conduct of a state is, or becomes, a cause for serious concern to the Participating States. It is not the intent and purpose of the Arrangement to be directed against any state or group of states, nor will it impede bona fide civil transactions. Furthermore it will not interfere with the rights of states to acquire legitimate means with which to defend themselves pursuant to Article 51 of the Charter of the United Nations.71 The Arrangement allows for Participating States to control all items set forth in a list of dual-use goods and technologies and in the munitions list, with the objective of preventing unauthorized transfers or re-transfers of those items. Participating States also agree to exchange general information on risks associated with transfers of conventional arms and dual-use goods and technologies in order to consider, where necessary, the scope for co-ordinating national control policies to combat the risks involved. At the tenth Plenary meeting of the Wassenaar Arrangement, held in Vienna on 8\u20139 December 2004, participating States reaffirmed their intent and resolve to prevent the acquisition by unauthorized persons of conventional arms and dual-use goods and technologies, in particular by terrorist groups and Organizations.
