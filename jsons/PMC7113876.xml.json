A nanoparticle-assisted polymerase chain reaction (nanoPCR) assay, however, has not been developed for PEDV. Relative to conventional PCR assays, the nanoPCR assay has the potential for increased sensitivity and specificity. In addition, real-time PCR assays require expensive instruments, and LAMP assays are easily contaminated. The nanoPCR is an advanced form of PCR in which solid gold nanometal particles (1\u2013100 nm) form colloidal nanofluids, which increase thermal conductivity. Therefore, PCR assays with nanofluids reach the target temperature more quickly than PCR assays with original liquids, and this reduces the time at non-target temperatures and thereby reduces non-specific amplification and increases specific amplification (Li and Rothberg, 2004, Shen et al., 2009). In addition, the nanoPCR assay does not require specialized instruments beyond standard PCR equipment (Ma et al., 2013). In this study, we developed a highly sensitive and specific nanoPCR method to target the N gene for the rapid detection of PEDV RNA in clinical specimens.",

Primers were selected and designed from conserved N gene using the Primer premier 5 software to generate a 477 bp amplicon (Table 1\n). Viral RNA was extracted from 150 \u03bcL of supernatant from virus-infected Vero cells or tissue samples using the RNA extraction kit (Qiagen, Inc., USA) following the manufacturer's instruction. The extracts were resuspended in 20 \u03bcL of distilled water, aliquoted and stored at \u221280 \u00b0C before amplification was carried out. RNA was used as a template and 10-fold serially diluted in 10 mM Tris-EDTA buffer (pH 8.0) to produce 2.7\u20132.7 \u00d7 10\u22128\n ng/\u03bcL. The nanoPCR assay was performed using PEDV-specific primers (Table 1). Briefly, 11 \u03bcL RNA extracted from either virus stocks or clinical samples was transcribed into cDNA using 1 \u03bcL (10 \u03bcM) of reverse primer in a 20 \u03bcL reaction volume. The reverse transcription (RT) reaction was performed at 42 \u00b0C for 50 min. The cDNA was amplified in a 25 \u03bcL reaction mixture containing 1 \u03bcL cDNA, 12.5 \u03bcL nanoPCR Mixture (GREDBIO, Weihai, China), 0.5 \u03bcL Taq DNA polymerase (GREDBIO, Weihai, China), and 10 \u03bcM each of forward and reverse primer by following the manufacturer's protocol with the following cycling times and temperatures: 94 \u00b0C for 3 min and 30 cycles of 94 \u00b0C for 30 s, 55 \u00b0C for 30 s, and 72 \u00b0C for 25 s. Five microliters of nanoPCR products were analyzed by agarose gel electrophoresis. The size of PEDV fragments amplified by nanoPCR was 477 bp (Fig. 1\n). Subsequent sequence analysis showed high similarity (100%) between the products obtained with the nanoPCR amplification of the N gene of PEDV (the objective sequences) and the reference sequence of PEDV. The results indicated that the PEDV nanoPCR method is specific.",

The current methods of detecting PEDV include virus isolation, serology, in situ hybridization, RT-PCR, RT-LAMP, and TaqMan-based real-time RT-PCR (Hou et al., 2007, Jung and Chae, 2005, Kim and Chae, 2000, Kim et al., 2007, Kusanagi et al., 1992, Kweon et al., 1997, Li et al., 2009, Oh et al., 2005, Rodak et al., 2005, Song et al., 2006). Virus isolation is one of the conventional methods, but PEDV is not easily adapted to cell lines. Although the addition of trypsin offers a possible solution, but viral titer of PEDV in cell lines remains low (Hofmann and Wyler, 1988). Serology represents the technique used most widely, however, this method has some disadvantages because antibody titers can decrease rapidly after infection (Lager et al., 1997). Conventional RT-PCR is less time-consuming but prone to sample contamination occurring during PCR processing steps, which increases the potential for false-positive results. The nanoPCR is an advanced form of PCR in which solid gold nanometal particles (1\u2013100 nm) form colloidal nanofluids, which increase thermal conductivity.
