In the age of online first and the 24 h news cycle, news publishing has been deeply transformed to allow more agility and flexibility, and (online) news articles are now updated seamlessly as new information becomes available. However, the desire to be first to publish and achieve high click-through rates has led to an increase in clickbait, both pre- and post-publication editorialization of titles and headlines that may misrepresent the actual content of the articles [1]. These trends may have contributed to the increased media mistrust that is discussed today under the controversial term fake news, described as \u201ca poorly-defined and misleading term that conflates a variety of false information, from genuine error through to foreign interference in democratic processes\u201d [2].",

For Revisionista.PT, we opted to customise an algorithm that is used in Google Docs to Track Changes Google [3] but in word-based mode.
