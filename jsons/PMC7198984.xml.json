The number of COVID-19 patients in need of hospitalization and treatment in a sub-intensive and intensive regime has rapidly increased, leading to a sudden and unexpected oversaturation of hospitals and healthcare network. Currently, on April 27th, 199.414 COVID-19 cases have been confirmed in Italy, with 26.977 deaths [1]. Starting from March 2020, in order to contain the transmission of the infection, the Italian Government approved a series of decrees (the latest issued on April 10), declaring the lockdown and quarantine status.",

Hub Hospitals have been assigned to the treatment of time-dependent emergencies, in order to concentrate the management of COVID-19 patients in Spoke hospitals. Five emergency categories have been defined [3].

Fifty days after the establishment of the new Hub and Spoke Lombard system, data relating to our centre showed an increase in the number of hospitalized and treated spinal trauma and spinal cord acute compression (Table 1), while it was recorded a major drop in non-traumatological and degenerative spinal pathology. If on the one hand the lockdown led to a reduction in the absolute number of spinal traumatic pathology, on the other hand it must be considered that the few cases were concentrated in a reduced number of Lombard Hub centers. This explains the relative increase in the number of spinal trauma patients hospitalized and treated surgically in our center.",

Hence some considerations and warnings. The over-estimation of sciatica pain and disability is likely to lead to a surgical over-treatment of diseases that could instead be managed pharmacologically and conservatively. It is mandatory to not underestimate symptoms of spinal cord and root compression (e.g., foot ptosis, difficulty urinating) that require immediate surgical treatment, educating the population to recognize these alarm bells.",
