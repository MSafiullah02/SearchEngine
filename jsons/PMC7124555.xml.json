How can the past assist in the real-time management of the crisis? What insights can be gleaned from the ongoing epidemic for future disease preparedness and prevention? Lurking in the background of these interrogatives is a more or less explicit accusation: why haven't past lessons been learned? The gist of some commentaries seems to be: \u201cthere is almost nothing surprising about this pandemic\u201d.2 The history-as-lessons approach pivots on the assumption that epidemics are structurally comparable events, wherever and whenever they take place. The COVID-19 outbreak \u201ccreates a sense of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu\u201d with the 2003 outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS).3 Citing early estimates of the disease's infectiousness, based on an analysis of the first 425 confirmed cases in Wuhan,4 comparisons have been drawn with the 1918\u201319 influenza pandemic.5\n",

A lessons approach to epidemics produces what Kenneth Burke, borrowing from the economist and sociologist Thorstein Veblen, called \u201ctrained incapacity\u201d\u2014\u201cthat state of affairs whereby one's very abilities can function as blindnesses\u201d.6 Habitual modes of thinking can diminish our capacity to make lateral connections. When the present is viewed through the lens of former disease outbreaks, we typically focus on similitudes and overlook important differences. In other words, analogies create blind spots. As Burke commented, \u201ca way of seeing is also a way of not seeing\u2014a focus on object A involves a neglect of object B\u201d.6\n",

The SARS outbreak occurred in late 2002 and 2003, not long after China had resumed sovereignty over Hong Kong in 1997. Under the terms of the Sino-British Joint Declaration signed between the Chinese and UK Governments in December, 1984, the former British colony was guaranteed the status of special administrative region. In March, 2003, Hu Jintao formally succeeded Jiang Zemin as President of China. Although the Chinese Government was initially condemned for withholding information and concealing the extent of the SARS epidemic,9 the early 2000s saw China's increasing international engagement. China acceded to the World Trade Organization in 2001, the year that Beijing was elected to host the 2008 Summer Olympics.",
