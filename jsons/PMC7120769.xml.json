            "text": "Many enveloped viruses encode a membrane fusion glycoprotein for the entry of cells through receptor binding and viral-cell membrane fusion, including the newly emerged severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-coronavirus (CoV) (1,2). Their N-linked glycans are needed for proper folding to reach the native conformation and to pass ER quality control (3). The spike (S) glycoprotein of coronaviruses is responsible for receptor binding and membrane fusion. It shares similarity with class I viral fusion proteins and is a typical type I integral membrane protein. The N-terminal S1 contains the receptor-binding site whilst the C-terminal S2 is a fusion subunit and is anchored to the viral envelope through a transmembrane domain. The S protein of SARS CoV is co-translationally N-glycosylated in the ER and trimerized if folded properly. One of the essential steps in the N-linked glycosylation is the transfer of a preformed, 14-core-unit-oligosacharide to a specific Asn residue in the sequence Asn-X-Ser/Thr where X is any residue except Pro, Asp, and Glu. The oligosaccharide chain is trimmed down in the ER and the cis-Golgi. Different external sugars are then added to the trimmed chain in the medial- and trans-Golgi. Glycoprotein with high mannose oligosaccharides in the ER and cis-Golgi remain sensitive to endoglycosidase H (EndoH) treatment. They become EndoH resistant after being processed by the medial- and trans-Golgi resident enzymes to glycoproteins with complex oligosaccharides. Only the mature S glycoprotein is readily assembled into virions and transported to the cell surface, where it partakes in cell-cell membrane fusion (4) and facilitates the rapid spread of virus infection. Therefore, the acquisition of the EndoH resistance and the cell surface expression is an indication that the S glycoprotein has been properly processed and transported through the constitutive secretory pathway. The pulse-chase labeling and deglycosylation techniques are widely used to analyze the glycosylation and modification process of viral glycoproteins. Here, we describe methods for characterization of the spike glycoprotein of SARS CoV.",

For longer labeling, 4 \u00b5L (44 \u00b5M) is required.The amount of fully glycosylated proteins in cells will peak after chasing for 4 h. After that, the yield of glycoprotein decreases due to cell death caused by vTF7.3 infection, however the ratio of mature to immature glycoprotein is increasing after 4 h chasing (Fig. 2).To prevent high background, avoid pipetting out the cell debris.
