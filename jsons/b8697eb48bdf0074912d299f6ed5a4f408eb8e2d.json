They provide many advantages. in comparison to standard analytical detection methods (i.e., chromatographic techniques) such as minimal sample preparation and handling, faster time analysis, simpler steps of analysis, rapid detection of the analytes of concern, use of non-skilled personnel, and portability for uses in the field applications. The aim of this chapter is to focus on novel research related to the rapid detection of agents and weapons of bioterrorism and provide a comprehensive review of the research topics most pertinent to advancing devices applicable to the rapid real-time detection of toxicants and bioterrorism weapons such as microbes, pathogens, toxins, virus, or nerve gases. The ongoing war on terrorism and the rising security concerns are driving the need for newer faster biosensing devices against bio-warfare agents for both military and civil defense applications. Readers of these review article will learn new schemes of biological weapons that can lead to the construction of devices that will minimize the risk of bio-terrorism.",

Because bioterrorism is difficult to predict or prevent, reliable platforms to rapidly detect and identify bioterrorism agents are important in order to minimize the spread and wide use of these agents and to protect the public health. These platforms must be sensitive, specific, and must also be able to accurately detect a variety of pathogens, including modified or previously uncharacterized agents, directly from complex sample matrices. Recent developments in laboratory prototype devices have been evaluated and were commercialized. Various commercial tests that utilize biochemical, immunological, nucleic acid, and bioluminescence procedures are currently available to identify biological threat agents. Recent developed tests identify bioterrorism agents using DNA aptamers, biochips, evanescent wave biosensors, cantilevers, living cells, and other innovative technologies. This review describes current and developing technologies against bioterrorism and considers challenges to rapid, accurate detect biothreat agents. Although there is no ideal platform, many of these technologies have proved valuable for the detection and identification of bioterrorism agents.",

These agents are typically found in nature, but it is possible that they could be mutated or altered to increase their ability to cause disease, make them resistant to current medicines, or to increase their ability to be spread around the environment. Biological agents can be spread through the air, water, or in food. Terrorists tend to use biological agents because they are extremely difficult to detect and do not cause illness for several hours to several days. Some bioterrorism agents, like the smallpox virus, can be spread from person to person and some, like anthrax, cannot.",

Military leaders, however, have learned that, as a military asset, bioterrorism has some important limitations; it is difficult to employ a biological weapon in a way that only the enemy is affected and not friendly forces. A biological weapon is useful to terrorists mainly as a method of creating mass panic and disruption to a state or a country.

Anton Dilger was sent to the United States in 1915 carrying cultures of glanders, a virulent disease of horses and mules. Dilger set up a laboratory in his house. He used stevedores working in the docks in Baltimore to infect horses with glanders while they were waiting to be shipped to Britain. Dilger was under suspicion as being a German agent, but was never arrested. Dilger eventually fled to Madrid, Spain, where he died during the Influenza Pandemic of 1918. In 1916, the Russians arrested a German agent with similar intentions. Germany and its allies infected French cavalry horses and many of Russia's mules and horses on the Eastern Front. These actions hindered artillery and troop movements, as well as supply convoys.",

Some believe that after the collapse of the Soviet Union, cultures of smallpox have become available in other countries. Although people born pre-1970 would have been vaccinated for smallpox under the WHO program, the effectiveness of vaccination is limited since the vaccine provides high level of immunity for only 3 to 5 years. Revaccination's protection lasts longer. As a biological weapon smallpox is dangerous because of the highly contagious nature of both the infected and their pox.

Recent biological terrorism threats and outbreaks of microbial pathogens clearly emphasize the need for biosensors that can quickly and accurately identify infectious agents. The majority of rapid biosensors generate detectable signals when a molecular probe in the detector interacts with an analyte of interest. Analytes may be whole bacterial or fungal cells, virus particles, or specific molecules, such as chemicals or protein toxins, produced by the infectious agent. Peptides and nucleic acids are most commonly used as probes in biosensors because of their versatility in forming various tertiary structures. The interaction between the probe and the analyte can be detected by various sensor platforms, including quartz crystal microbalances, surface acoustical waves, surface plasmon resonance, amperometrics, and magnetoelastics. The field of biosensors is constantly evolving to develop devices that have higher sensitivity and specificity, and are smaller, portable, and cost-effective. The present article describes recent advances in biosensors for applications in the rapid detection of bioterrorism weapons.

Detection has two primary technological factors. First there is OHA's BioWatch program in which collection devices are disseminated to thirty high risk areas throughout the country to detect the presence of aerosolized biological agents before symptoms present in patients [8] . This is significant primarily because it allows a more proactive response to a disease outbreak rather than the more passive treatment of the past. \u2022 Implementation of the Generation-3 automated detection system. This advancement is significant simply because it enables action to be taken in four to six hours due to its automatic response system, whereas the previous system required aerosol detectors to be manually transported to laboratories [8] .",

One way in which this is ensured is through exercises that establish preparedness; programs like the Anthrax Response Exercise Series exist to ensure that, regardless of the incident, all emergency personnel will be aware of the role they must fill. Moreover, by providing information and education to public leaders, emergency medical services and all employees of the DHS, OHS suggests that it can significantly decrease the impact of bioterrorism [8] . \u2022 Enhancing the technological capabilities of first responders. This is accomplished through numerous strategies. The first of these strategies was developed by the Science and Technology Directorate (S&T) of DHS to ensure that the danger of suspicious powders could be effectively assessed, (as many dangerous biological agents such as anthrax exist as a white powder). By testing the accuracy and specificity of commercially available systems used by first responders, the hope is that all biologically harmful powders can be rendered ineffective. \u2022 Enhanced equipment for first responders. One recent advancement is the commercialization of a new form of Tyvex\u2122 armor which protects the first responders and patients from chemical and biological contaminants. There has also been a new generation of Self-Contained Breathing Apparatuses (SCBA) which has been recently made more robust against bioterrorism agents. All of these technologies combine to form what seems like a relatively strong deterrent to bioterrorism. However, New York City as an entity has numerous organizations and strategies that effectively serve to deter and respond to bioterrorism as it comes. From here the logical progression is into the realm of New York City's specific strategies to prevent bioterrorism. \u2022 BioShield The accrual of vaccines and treatments for potential biological threats, also known as medical countermeasures has been an important aspect in preparing for a potential bioterrorist attack; this took the form of a program beginning in 2004, referred to as Project BioShield. The significance of this program should not be overlooked as there is currently enough smallpox vaccine to inoculate every United States citizen and a variety of therapeutic drugs to treat the infected. The Department of Defense also has a variety of laboratories currently working to increase the quantity and efficacy of countermeasures that comprise the national stockpile [9] . Efforts have also been taken to ensure that these medical countermeasures are able to be disseminated effectively in the event of a bioterrorist attack. The National Association of Chain Drug Stores championed this cause by encouraging the participation of the private sector in improving distribution of such countermeasures if required [9] .",

Looking at a detailed report that examined the funding decrease for bioterrorism in fifty-one American cities, Dr. Gupta stated that the cities \"wouldn't be able to distribute vaccines as well\" and \"wouldn't be able to track viruses\".
