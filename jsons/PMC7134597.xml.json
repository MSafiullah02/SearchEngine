As of February 11, 2003, there were 305 atypical pneumonia cases (105 were health workers) and five related deaths in Guandong Province.3\nDespite the urgent announcements and warnings issued by the Health Department of the Guandong Province in late January,4\nvery quickly the emerging disease spread to some other regions in Mainland China as well as Hong Kong, Singapore, Vietnam, Canada, etc. In March of 2003, the World Health Organization, for the first time in its history, issued a globally warning about the disease (WHO, 2003a) and officially defined the disease as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) (WHO, 2003d). In late June of 2003, the disease was under control globally, but it had spread to 32 countries and regions causing about 800 deaths and more than 8000 infections (WHO, 2003e).5\n",

The cases at universities and hospitals in Beijing suggest that airborne transmission is also possible.

The objective of this paper is to study the transmission dynamics of the spread of SARS in Beijing at the population level. As China started to report SARS cases as suspect and probable separately from April 27 (Ministry of Health of P. R. China, 2003) following the WHO definitions (WHO, 2003d), we classify the population of Beijing into six classes, namely susceptible (S(t)), exposed (E(t)), quarantined (Q(t)), suspect infective (I\ns(t)), probable infective (I\np(t)) and removed (R(t)). It is assumed that individuals in the E class are exposed to SARS virus but not isolated from the community and individuals in the Q class are isolated from the community.",

            "text": "We first propose a deterministic model consisting of the six components, which is a system of six ordinary differential equations with various parameters modelling the feature of SARS transmission. However, unlike the SARS outbreaks in Hong Kong, Singapore and Toronto, which have been well studied and for which detailed data are available in the literature (see Donnelly et al., 2003; Lee et al., 2003; Tsang et al., 2003 for Hong Kong; Lipsitch et al., 2003 for Singapore; Booth et al., 2003; Poutanen et al., 2003 for Toronto) so that parameter values can be estimated from these reports, so far there have been few published reports about the SARS outbreak in Beijing. Moreover, the data about Beijing are very limited (Ministry of Health of P. R. China, 2003; WHO, 2003e), with only the daily suspect cases, probable cases (including number of cases transferred from previously reported suspect cases), cleared suspect cases, number of patients released from hospitals, and deaths given (see Table 1). Because of the limitation of the data, we simplify the general model to two simpler models. The first is a two-component model consisting of only the suspect infectives (I\ns(t)) and the probable infectives (I\np(t)). The daily suspect and probable cases will be regarded as the inputs, the cleared suspect cases will be the output for I\ns(t), the number of SARS patients released from hospitals plus the deaths will be the output for I\np(t). The model also include a term representing the cases transferred from I\ns(t) to I\np(t). The second is a one-compartment model for the probable variable I\np(t) only. We will use the data in Table 1 to model the input, output and transmission terms. Then we use the mathematical models to make predictions of future incidence and to simulate the impact of additional control strategies.",

Statistics show that some individuals who are infectious are not quarantined at Beijing partially because some infective individuals in hospitals failed to report some of their close contacts for various reasons. These individuals are the sources for the spread of SARS outside the quarantined sites. Further, the data (Ministry of Health of P. R. China, 2003) show that the valid contact rate of SARS in Beijing depends on the numbers of infected individuals. One of the reasons is that the people in Beijing have been taking various protection measures such as reducing social activities, using mouth-masks, strengthening immune functions, etc.",

Let us denote this input rate by f\n0. To fit this function and others, we set April 26, 2003 as time zero and take days as time units. Thus, April 27, 2003 is the first day, April 28, 2003 is the second day, etc. Then, we use the curve-fitting package (cftool) from Matlab 6.5, in which polynomial, exponential, power, rational, Weibull, Gaussian and Custom equations can be chosen and certain techniques can be used to fit data according to the mean-square error (MSE).

Since the exact infection period is not clear at this moment, which is crucial for the computation of the reproduction number, we look for an estimation.

(2003) in which it was reported that the mean time from the onset of clinical symptoms to the admission to hospitals is about 5 days. If there is no risk to transmit the disease by a probable individual quarantined in a hospital and the transmission occurs only in the time interval from the onset of clinical symptoms to the admission to a hospital, the five days can be used as a lower bound for the infection duration. The upper bound 16 is derived from Zhong (2003) in which it was reported that \u201cfew probable individuals are infectious at the onset of symptoms, the infectiousness of probable individuals increases as the infected process develops, the maximal infection force occurs with highest temperature and heavy coughing in the second week and then falls quickly as the temperature decreases\u201d. Now assume that the infection force is equally distributed in the time interval from the onset of symptoms to the 16th day. From the expression of c(t), we can see that the expectation that an infective stays in I\np compartment is 4.9436 during the first 5 days and 15.0298 during the first 16 days. By the standard method for the calculation of the reproduction number (see, for example van den Driessche and Watmough, 2002), we can see that a reasonable estimation for the reproductive number is 1.0698\u2a7dR\n0\u2a7d3.2524.",

Then, Eq. (3.8) can be partitioned into two equations(4.1)dIpdt=Ip(\u22120.09589Ip(t)/980+0.2164)\u22120.03349Ipand(4.2)dIpdt=0.01029(Ip(t)/1991)2.842Ip\u22120.03349Ip.\nEq. (4.1) has an endemic equilibrium I\np=1869.35 which is globally stable. For Eq. (4.2), there is an endemic equilibrium Ip\u2217=3015.8 which is unstable. Furthermore, I\np(t) decreases to zero as t evolves if Ip(0)<Ip\u2217, and increases as t evolves if Ip(0)>Ip\u2217. If protection measures are merely used and the intervention policies are not adopted, then only (4.1) takes effect. It follows that the disease can be persistent at a level of 1869 probable individuals when t is large. Furthermore, if the intervention measures are implemented so late that the probable numbers are greater than 3016, then the above analysis shows that the disease will be persistent. This again shows that it is important to perform strong intervention measures before the number of infectives reaches Ip\u2217.",

Beijing, the hardest hit city in the world with the most SARS cases, had already been removed from the WHO SARS list in June 2003. However, questions and mysteries about spread, reporting and treatment of SARS in Beijing remain. One of the fundamental questions is that how many of the reported suspect SARS cases were indeed probable cases and how the suspect individuals affect the transmission of the disease.",

            "text": "In this study, we proposed a mathematical model to simulate the SARS outbreak in Beijing. Differing from the SARS models in Chowell et al. (2003), Lipsitch et al. (2003) and Riley et al. (2003), our model consists of six subpopulations, namely susceptible, exposed, quarantined, suspect infectives, probable infectives and removed. By simplifying the model to a two-compartment suspect-probable model and a single-compartment probable model and using limited data, we are able to simulate the SARS outbreak in Beijing. We estimated that the reproduction number varies from 1.098 to 3.2524 and obtained certain important epidemiological parameters. The basic reproduction number R\n0 is defined as the expected number of secondary cases produced in a completely susceptible population by a typical infective individual. This quantity determines the potential for an infectious agent to start an outbreak (Anderson and May, 1991; Brauer and Castillo-Chavez, 2000; Diekmann and Heesterbeek, 2000). We found that the incidence rate has the characteristic of two stages. The first stage is the process of taking protection measures and quarantine policy and the second stage coincides with the process of maintaining control measures. Our study showed that it is necessary to implement the maximal control measures in the second stage for a certain period in order to eradicate the disease. Furthermore, the control measures in the second stage should be implemented before a threshold for the number of probable cases is reached.",
