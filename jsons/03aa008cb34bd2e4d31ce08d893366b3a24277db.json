SARS-COV-2 enters human cells via the angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 (ACE-2) receptor. It has a binding affinity 10-15 times greater than the SARS virus responsible for a smaller outbreak in 2003. 1 The ACE-2 receptor is a cell membrane-associated protein that can be found in epithelial (cardiac and renal) cells, endothelial (pulmonary and vascular) cells, and cells of the oral mucosa and nasopharynx ( Figure 1 ). When SARS-COV-2 binds to the ACE-2 receptor, it reduces intracellular ACE-2 protein activity. 2, 3 In the heart, ACE-2 is involved in endothelial regulation, vasoconstriction, and cardiac function. In the renal system, ACE-2 impairment has been implicated in oxidative stress, inflammation, and fibrosis of the renal tissue. 4 The role of ACE-2 in the lung is incompletely understood, but increased activity may possibly reduce lung injury in the adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). 5 ",

Such a presentation resembles the ARDS and can be stratified based on Pao 2 /Fio 2 ratio of <300 = mild disease and <100 = severe. [14] [15] [16] In some patients with COVID-19, lung compliance can be normal. 17, 18 Ventilation Strategies Many patients with COVID-19 respiratory failure do not require immediate intubation. Efforts to avoid intubation and mechanical ventilation should be balanced against the risk of nosocomial transmission. The use of high-flow nasal cannula (HFNC) carries a poorly quantified but likely higher risk of aerosol generation than lower-flow forms of oxygen supplementation 19 ; its risk compared to noninvasive positive pressure ventilation (NIPPV), 20 or intubation and mechanical ventilation, are also unknown. Some health care organizations have recommended against noninvasive ventilation due to the risk of COVID transmission [21] [22] [23] [24] given these same risks. Self-proning of awake patients receiving oxygen by nasal cannula or HFNC, while minimally described in the literature, 25 is low risk and may improve oxygenation. 26 A core principle of ARDS management is control of fluid balance to reduce the contribution of pulmonary edema to gas exchange abnormalities in the injured lung. Although data in COVID-19 are lacking, limiting fluids has improved outcomes in other forms of ARDS 27 and is used in COVID-19 management to improve gas exchange. Under such conditions, monitoring for adequacy of oxygen delivery and end-organ damage due to hypovolemia is needed.",

Small tidal volumes combined with high PEEP and hypercarbia may contribute to air-hunger and deep sedation may be required (see Neurologic Considerations section for drug choices and strategies). Auto-PEEP can cause severe reductions in cardiac output and may do so when expiratory gas flow does not reach 0 L/s before the next breath. In such patients, disconnecting the ventilator can prevent cardiac arrest. If the ventilator must be disconnected for a COVID-19 patient, caregivers should be careful to limit aerosolization as much as is possible (ie, disconnecting from the circuit in a way that leaves any filtering device in place on the endotracheal tube). Instead, if clinically appropriate, shortening inspiratory time, treating bronchospasm if present, and increasing sedation may resolve the issue.",

The importance of deep venous thrombosis (DVT) prophylaxis deserves emphasis, given the reported hypercoagulable state 10 and high rate of DVT 9 in patients with COVID-19. There is some evidence that elevated D-dimer levels may be associated with poor prognosis. 31 It is believed that SARS-COV-2 may facilitate both endothelial activation of von Willebrand factor and factor VIII as well as complement-mediated microvascular injury and thrombosis. 32 Both pathways would contribute to a hypercoagulable state. Because of the reduced mortality associated with anticoagulation in severe COVID-19 cases, some authors have recommended therapeutic doses of anticoagulation. 33, 34 In the absence of shock, fluid therapy should be managed conservatively to minimize the contribution of pulmonary edema to gas exchange and lung compliance. 35 The inhaled pulmonary vasodilator (ie, nitric oxide) can be trialed to reduce V/Q mismatch and shunt but can worsen hypotension or hypoxemia. 36 Use of methylprednisone for ARDS, in general, and for COVID-19, specifically, remains controversial. [37] [38] [39] In cases of refractory hypoxemia and hypercarbia, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) can be considered (see Extracorporeal Life Support Considerations section). 40 In light of increased mortality in elderly patients and those who require intubation, end-of-life care issues should be addressed.",

The Surviving Sepsis Campaign COVID-19 panel composed guidelines based on an extensive review of the literature. 45 47 Without proper infection control, those providing treatment can clearly become transmitters of the disease itself. Laboratory diagnosis and specimen retrieval enable confirmation of the suspected diagnosis as well as appropriate de-escalation of treatment and resources like broad-spectrum antibiotics, airborne precautions, and negative pressure isolation. Typical specimen samples will include nasal swab if the patient is not intubated and tracheal aspirate if intubated. 45 The last of the principles-supportive careencompasses a range of issues in patients with COVID-19. With regard to systemic steroids, the panel reserved administration for ventilated patients with severe ARDS, but on a case-by-case basis. Empiric antibiotics were recommended because bacterial coinfection may be difficult to recognize and diagnose (Table) . Daily assessment for de-escalation, duration, and antibiotic spectrum was recommended based on microbiology specimens. In regard to fever management, acetaminophen was viewed as a patient comfort strategy. For the patient presenting in high output septic shock, conservative and judicious resuscitation with crystalloids was preferred over liberal fluid resuscitation due to lung injury associated with a concomitant capillary leak syndrome and poor outcomes with higher cumulative fluid balances in ARDS. If a vasoactive agent was needed, the panel recommended norepinephrine as the preferred first-line vasoactive agent. Vasopressin was the second-line agent if norepinephrine alone did not reach the targeted mean arterial pressure goal of 65 mm Hg. Dobutamine was the recommended inotropic agent when cardiac dysfunction was present. Hydrocortisone at 200 mg/d was recommended in refractory shock. 45 Angiotensin II, though not recommended by the SCCM guidelines, may have a potential therapeutic role beyond supporting the MAP based on the speculative hypothesis of downregulation of ACE-2 receptors, saturation of and competitive inhibition of ACE-2 enzyme activity. 48, 49 Insufficient data exist to strongly support any single approach to antiviral therapy. The panel did not recommend IVIG without adequate titers of neutralizing antibodies. Recombinant interferon-beta (INF-beta) inhibits SARS-COV-2 in cell cultures, and studies by the World Health Organization (WHO) are ongoing. Currently, trials of convalescent plasma are also underway. Lopinavir/ritonavir is still being investigated by the WHO. Remdesivir-a prodrug analog of adenosine-results in premature RNA chain termination, and trials in mild, moderate, and severe COVID-19 patients are ongoing. Hydroxychloroquine has received attention in the lay-press and may be a more potent inhibitor of SARS-COV-2 in vitro compared to chloroquine. Although randomized trial data are lacking, dosing regimens of 400 mg BID loading followed by 200 mg BID for 4 days. Tocilizumab is an anti-interleukin-6 (IL-6) immunoglobulin. This drug was originally used in both rheumatology and oncology for its effects on hemophagocytic syndrome. Its effects on reducing cytokine concentrations and acute phase reactants has prompted its consideration in severe COVID-19 where a hyperinflammatory state (cytokine release syndrome) is known to be a prominent feature. 50 ",

Trending these markers helps plot an overall cardiac course. Additionally, IL-6 levels are used as an indicator of systemic dysregulation of proinflammatory mediators (cytokines, oxygen-free radical, and coagulation factors). In COVID-19, early detection and mitigation of such a cytokine \"storm\" may reduce end-organ damage (a clinical trial is ongoing). 52 In the absence of rapid IL-6 levels, clinicians have also used the H score to assess excessive immune reactivity. 53, 54 If elevated, tocilizumab may be used. 54, 55 Electrocardiography not only helps monitor arrhythmias and ST changes but can also help detect drug-related prolongation of QTc. 55 Hydroxychloroquine/chloroquine and azithromycin are commonly used treatments for COVID-19.

Steroids and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are not recommended for COVID-19 patients, in general, 60 and particularly those with impending or ongoing myocardial injury and may worsen heart failure. 61, 62 Data are insufficient to support stoppage of ACE inhibitors and ACE receptor blockers. 63 If the H score or C-reactive protein level is significantly elevated, an IL-6 inhibitor should be considered.",

In the 2018 ECMO to Rescue Lung Injury in Severe ARDS (EOLIA) trial, 64 60-day mortality was not significantly lower with patients randomized to receive ECMO, but the trial was limited by a high rate of crossover from the control to the ECMO group. 40, 64 A recently published pooled analysis of 17 COVID-19 patients treated with ECMO reported a high mortality (94.1%), 65 although in other emerging reports, survivors have been reported. 66 Given the overwhelming presentation of patients during the COVID-19 pandemic, starting new ECMO centers is not advised and decisions to initiate ECMO must be subject to considerable thought and judgment 66 and each patient should be considered individually with respect to risks, benefits, and available resources. For both venovenous (VV) and venoarterial (VA) approaches, current guidelines 67,68 endorse use of ECMO for patients with severe disease and high predicted mortality. Experience with non-COVID use of ECMO suggests that younger patients with minor or no-comorbidities should remain the highest priority for ECMO. 66, 69 Use of ECMO in COVID-19 patients with a combination of advanced age (>60 years old), multiple comorbidities, or multiple organ failures should be rare.

            "text": "Many patients in the ICU with COVID-19 will require mechanical ventilation, which typically obligates them to sedation. The ABCDEF Bundle is helpful to determine sedation needs and is implemented in the following fashion: Assess, Prevent, and Manage Pain, Both SAT and SBT, Choice of analgesia and sedation, Delirium: Assess, Prevent, and Manage, Early mobility and Exercise, and Family engagement and empowerment. 70 Delirium screening should be performed daily in patients who are able to participate, as delirium increases mortality and should be prevented. 71 The Confusion Assessment Method for the ICU (CAM-ICU) is commonly used to screen patients for delirium and is validated for patients receiving sedation and on mechanical ventilation. 72 Sedation should be titrated using a clinical scale such as the Richmond Agitation and Sedation Scale (RASS) score ranges from +4 (combative), 0 (awake and calm), to \u22125 (comatose), and a reasonable goal would be a range of 0 to \u22122. 73 Such scales are preferred over EEG monitoring. 74 Deeper sedation is often required to tolerate high PEEP ventilator settings and for patients who will require paralysis. Strict ventilator synchrony (eg, not overbreathing or \"double-stacking\") is important to avoid increased oxygen consumption and barotrauma. Dexmedetomidine should not be used without other amnestic medication in patients requiring neuromuscular blockade, and bispectral index (BIS) monitor might be suited to such patients. 74 Of note, sevoflurane and propofol interact with chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine to increase the likelihood of QTc prolongation. Remdesivir does not have known interactions with any major anesthesia drugs. Propofol infusion syndrome should always be considered if sudden acidosis occurs after prolonged infusion, particularly in younger patients. 75 Furthermore, pain control with IV infusions and enteral regimens are both acceptable. Half of ICU patients will have pain, and multimodal regimens can be used even when patients are mechanically ventilated (eg, acetaminophen, gabapentinoids, transdermal lidocaine, tramadol, muscle relaxants [methocarbamol, etc], and opioids). 76 Although epidemiologic data are lacking, and given noted concerns about hypercoagulability, stroke may be a relatively common complication of COVID-19. 77 A sudden change in mental status or acute onset of focal neurologic changes not explained by drugs should trigger a differential diagnosis that includes stroke and hemorrhage. The National Institute of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) is performed for all patients suspected of stroke, and a head CT should be ordered when a stroke is suspected. 78 In many institutions, a \"CODE STROKE\" pathway is present which mobilizes the neurology team and makes the patient a top priority for a rapid, definitive diagnostic evaluation. 79 Ischemic strokes and subarachnoid hemorrhage (after clipping/coiling) may require a higher blood pressure for several days to prevent permanent loss of function while hemorrhagic strokes require tighter blood pressure control, commonly with an infusion. Special care should be given to patients with status epilepticus, spinal cord injuries, and TBI, and hyperventilation cannot be used for anything beyond short-term, emergent control of catastrophic elevations in intracranial pressure (ie, during active herniation).",

For patients with AKI, urine microscopy may be helpful, and the diagnostic workup should parallel that of AKI in critically ill adults. Similarly, the care of COVID-19 patients with perturbations in renal function should center around foundational supportive care: avoidance of renal insults (ie, nephrotoxins and hypotension), resuscitation or diuresis to euvolemia, correction of electrolyte and acid-base perturbations, and nutritional optimization. 90 Patients with COVID-19 demonstrate hypercoagulability 10 which may increase the risk of clotting of continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) filters. Appropriate temporary dialysis catheter placement and position are important from an access quality standpoint, and optimization of the dialysis prescription (eg, high blood flows and predilution replacement fluid) may help to extend filter life. One potential solution is staged anticoagulation for patients on CRRT: regional citrate anticoagulation, followed by escalation to prefilter heparin administration with serum monitoring of heparin levels per local protocol, and then finally consideration of alternative systemic anticoagulants (ie, direct thrombin inhibitors). Potential local or national shortages of citrate, calcium, and/ or systemic anticoagulants may influence the optimal approach. Hospitals should also develop staged RRT surge plans, which might include mixed CRRT durations with machine redeployment, various prolonged intermittent RRT approaches, and/or acute peritoneal dialysis. 91 ",

However, under resource-limited circumstances such as in the COVID-19 pandemic, the Utilitarian philosophy of social justice (the most good for the greatest number of people) becomes important. Ethical issues may occur when allocating ICU beds, ventilating patients, withdrawing life-supportive treatment, starting experimental treatments, or resuscitating patients suffering from cardiac arrest. These decisions will require (1) a hospital policy, (2) consultations with the broader ICU team, and (3) rapid ethics consultations. 102 Such decisions should consider (a) the age and premorbid status of the patient, (b) the severity and prognosis of the disease, (c) the severity of the shortage of resources (supply/demand proportion), and (d) the stage of the pandemic (whether the overburdened phase has been reached). 103 Ways of moving forward should include the following: 105 Other specific strategies may ease the impact of these complex decisions on caregivers and families, but all stem from the underlying recognition that the patients are someone's loved one who may be denied some aspect of care (eg, an ICU bed or ventilator). The sharing of empathy and compassion and having conversations early in the clinical course may be helpful, particularly for patients who are elderly or at high risk. Emphasizing comfort care measures may allay concerns that caregivers are abandoning patients who are not being offered other critical care measures, and palliative care teams can be invaluable in this setting. It is also critical for clinicians to make use of available support system resources, as complex end-of-life issues will take a psychological toll on caregivers.",

            "text": "The current Coronavirus pandemic is unprecedented in the modern medical era and COVID-19 is an entirely new disease. COVID-19 is remarkably transmissible and can render patients critically ill in a very short period of time. The COVID-19 pandemic may require health care systems to adapt to volumes of critically ill patients that exceed their capacity, and nonintensivist anesthesiologists are rapidly being deployed in their critical care management. The respiratory care of these patients should closely mimic the care for ARDS patients without COVID-19, with the caveat that some patients may not have the typical poor compliance of ARDS, and that many patients require extended ventilatory support. Because COVID-19 may affect the heart and affected patients may be hypercoagulable, myocardial injury has been reported and can be severe. In addition to antiviral protocols, the use of broad-spectrum antibiotics to cover coinfection should be considered, particularly for patients in shock. Many critically ill patients with COVID-19 will require sedation for mechanical ventilation, and the 2018 SCCM guidelines are appropriate for the care of these patients. Most importantly, sedation should be targeted to a desired effect, including ventilator synchrony, with interruptions daily if possible, and patients will often require deep sedation if they are severely hypoxemic or require neuromuscular blockade. AKI is a common consequence of COVID-19, either due to ATN or hypotension. The hypercoagulability of COVID-19 patients may lead to increased clotting of CRRT filters but the nature of this hypercoagulability is not defined. The need for glycemic control is not unique to patients with COVID-19, but because of the need to limit room entry, patients who might otherwise be managed with an insulin infusion should be first trialed on a subcutaneous regimen. The role of steroids has been raised for both lung injury and hemodynamic aspects of care of COVID-19 patients, but the best evidence for steroids is for the treatment of septic shock refractory to pressors and for adrenal insufficiency. Finally, because of the expected high mortality of critically ill patients, and the possibility that the number of patients will exceed the resources available, ethical considerations must be a part of health care systems' response plans. Systems, not individual clinicians, should develop plans for how to triage and ration care requiring limited resources (eg, ventilators, ICU beds, blood products), and, perhaps more important than many of the medical strategies described above, clinicians must address the end-of-life concerns of patients who have a high likelihood of dying of this disease.
