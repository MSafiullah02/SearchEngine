Human clinical research is multiphase. Practice-based research knowledge moves from early efficacy clinical studies to effectiveness RCTs and then through to meta-analyses and guideline development including tools for patients, clinicians and policy makers. Confusion arises as translation is not made up of discreet steps, rather it is a continuum with feedback loops to inform research development along the way.",

All have to be considered, and all have to be aligned. Understanding the patient perspective requires an appreciation of the outcome that is important to the patient, as opposed to a pandering to whatever the patient articulates. This means applying the best evidence available to achieve that which is important, in partnership with the patient. Likewise, \u201cthe doctor's experience\u201d is often misused to justify whatever care the doctor intuitively feels to be right, independent of the evidence. The use of high-quality evidence is therefore critical to prevent yielding to a patient's unjustified wants, or a doctor's biased inclinations. Understanding data is not intuitive and requires training in evidence and critical appraisal, which can go some way to mitigating this bias (Kulier et al., 2012).",

Recent RCTs in reproductive medicine from China and Vietnam (Chen et al., 2016; Shi et al., 2018; Vuong et al., 2018) have been executed in short time periods, thus proving that the long time and high costs are not intrinsic to RCTs and are caused by external factors.",

The fact that many RCTs report negative findings is not the fault of the RCTs, but it is because the therapies they test apparently do not work. This is to be expected, as treatment effects, as argued above, are overestimated (Fenton and Khan, 2011). In any event, knowing that an intervention does not work is just as important. Giving a treatment that does not work to a patient is harmful, either because it prevents an effective treatment being given, or it causes actual physical or financial harm.",

This is of course true, and as stated, the doctor's judgment in applying the evidence is a necessary pre-requisite for the practice of evidence-based medicine. The issue though is how to change uncertainty to certainty. This is best done through RCTs. A good example is that, despite extensive data gathering over decades as to whether progesterone treatment reduces the rate of miscarriage in patients with threatened miscarriage, uncertainty continued. It was only when a well-conceived and well-conducted RCT was carried out, with pre-specified sub-groups across a whole range of patient characteristics, that the answer was reached (A.

Pediatric oncology culture has long had a culture of embracing uncertainty and entering patients into well run randomized controlled studies to bring about certainty (De Vries et al., 2011). This is likely to have contributed to the remarkable improvement in survival of childhood cancer, something that unfortunately cannot be said for IVF success rates which have not improved over the past 5 years.
