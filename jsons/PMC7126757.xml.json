Neutrophils play a key role during Candida albicans (C. albicans) infection (Urban et al., 2006, Fradin et al., 2005). C. albicans organisms exposed to erythrocytes, mononuclear cells, plasma or blood lacking neutrophils become physiologically active and rapidly switch to filamentous growth. In contrast, the presence of neutrophils arrested C. albicans growth (Urban et al., 2006, Fradin et al., 2005). Recently, immune responses to some components of C. albicans such as mannan (Muller and Melchinger, 2004) or \u03b2-glucan (Gantner et al., 2005) have been reported.",

Recently, Iwai et al. have identified oral microorganisms in the lesions of Buerger disease, suggesting a possible etiologic link between Buerger disease and chronic infections such as oral bacterial infections (Iwai et al., 2005). We have established a mouse model which shows the symptoms of coronary arteritis following consecutive injections into mice of a water-soluble polysaccharide from Candida sp.
