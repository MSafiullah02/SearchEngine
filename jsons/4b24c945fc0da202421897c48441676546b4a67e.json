Although compact, this description comes with a level of ambiguity since a single matrix may describe multiple words.

Our results demonstrate that ambiguity can often be reduced using these concepts, and we give conditions on when they succeed.",

Following this, in [14] the authors look at a refinement of the vector notion which is meant to reduce this ambiguity, and introduce an extension for it in the form of a Parikh matrix. A Parikh matrix not only contains the Parikh vector of the word, but also information regarding some of the word's (scattered) subwords. Such a matrix has the same asymptotic compactness as a Parikh vector and is associated to a significantly smaller number of words. However, it does not normally remove ambiguity entirely.",

These include even more refined versions of the matrices by inclusion of polynomials, various extensions on the mappings, or both.

These represent a particular case of the extended mapping presented in [18] , where we only consider a subset of the original alphabet. For example, consider the words abcaabaac and abacabcaa. It is easy to see that both share the same number of letters, and subwords ab, bc and abc, respectively, making their Parikh matrices equal and therefore ambiguous.

Lyndon conjugates were used previously as a tool for ambiguity reduction. In [17] , the authors define the Lyndon image of a Parikh matrix as the lexicographically smallest word describing such a matrix. Hence every Parikh matrix has exactly one distinct Lyndon image, which therefore allows each Parikh matrix to be described uniquely.

Proof Outline. The forwards direction is proven by examining every element of the conjugacy class of w. We can first prove that if L(u) = L(w), for all u \u2208 A(w, \u03a8 ), then words in the conjugacy class of w are only amiable with other conjugates of w. We then show that this is only true when L(w) is in the set {aabb, ababbb, aababb, aabbab, aaabab}. For this we define a block of a letter to be a unary factor of a word which is not extendable to the right or left and argue that applying a Type 2 transformation to any Lyndon conjugate that is not in the above set either alters the size of the block of a's at the start of the word, or changes the total number of blocks of a's in the word altogether.

Next add a's to the front and b's to the end of each word, respectively, so that we have a total of 6 a's and 4 b's per word: aaabaaabbb, aaaabababb, aaaaabbbab. Finally, any number of a's and b's can be added to the front and end of each word, respectively: a * aaabaaabbbb * , a * aaaabababbb * , a * aaaaabbbabb * . Hence we know that any word of this form is the Lyndon representative of its conjugacy class and shares a Parikh matrix with the two other words stated above. For example, \u03a8 (a 2 aaabaaabbbb 3 ) = \u03a8 (a 2 aaaabababbb 3 ) = \u03a8 (a 2 aaaaabbbabb 3 ) = 8 53 7 .",

Hence all Parikh matrices would be L-distinguishable if it were not for some cases that arise as a result of us using the Lyndon conjugate. These cases are namely the ones where the set of amiable words are all Lyndon conjugates, are all members of the same conjugacy class, or are all conjugates of words whose Lyndon conjugates share a Parikh matrix. We showed in Propositions 7 and 9 that the first two cases are characterised by words of the form w = a * vb * where for n = |v| ba we have that |v| a = 2n and |v| b = n + 1, and by words where their Lyndon conjugate is in the set {aabb, ababbb, aababb, aabbab, aaabab}, respectively.

On the other hand, we find that L-Parikh matrices reduce the ambiguity of most binary words, with the few exceptions from Theorem 2, which have all been shown to be rare occurrences within the binary alphabet.
