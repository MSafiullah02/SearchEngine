Nightingale hired 38 women, some of whom were Anglican nursing sisters and Catholic nuns. 1 To Nightingale, it was essential to include Catholic nuns because one-third of the British forces were Irish Catholic. In the end, she gathered the best and most prepared nurses she could find to make the journey and care for the wounded British soldiers. 1 Upon their arrival, the nurses faced many barriers and outright resistance. The career military medical officer Dr. John Hall made up his mind that they wouldn't be of any help. 1 Dr. Hall was known to oppose patient care changes even if beneficial. He was confident that these nurses were going to be ignorant and of questionable character. This less-than-warm reception didn't deter the women from organizing, cleaning, and preparing the hospital for the wounded. 1 On October 25, 1854, the British and their allies fought the Russians in the Battle of Balaclava and 11 days later, another battle ensued. 1 The vast number of wounded soldiers coming to Scutari after these battles quickly changed the way the medical staff viewed Nightingale and her nurses. The nurses had minimal supplies, but instituted new practices and procedures based on observations and data they collected related to Nightingale's teaching. 1 They observed under which conditions the soldiers had survived and attempted to replicate and spread best practices throughout the hospital.",

Her statistical findings indicated that most deaths were due to overcrowding, poor sanitation, and improper ventilation. 2 The accomplishments of Nightingale and her nurses in Scutari were transformational, strongly impacting the value of evidenceinformed nursing practices and redefining the image of modern nursing well into the 20th century. Data demonstrated the merits of quality nursing care: Survival rates increased from 50% to nearly 80% under the care of Nightingale and her nurses. 1 Attention to rigorous infection prevention, hygiene and cleanliness, nutrition and hydration, and compassionate care were integral interventions that revolutionized nursing care practices and improved clinical outcomes.",

OFs were found in several categories, including equipment/supplies, information/ communication, medication, staffing/training, and physical unit layout. On average, nurses reported a rate of 6.07 (SD = 7.10) OFs per shift, most related to equipment and supplies. These findings illustrated that nurses commonly encounter OFs in delivering patient care. The frontline nurse's intimate knowledge of OFs can inform operational improvements that not only lead to better quality care, but also help reduce wasted nursing time. Over a century and a half has passed since Nightingale identified the need for nurses to observe, assess, understand, collect data, and plan nursing care. Time spent on OFs wastes a nurse's precious time, creates moral distress, and detracts from core care responsibilities.",

Instead, due to the nature of the work environment, nurses are forced to create workarounds. Unfortunately, clinical nurses have little time to learn and employ second-order problemsolving techniques in which they investigate and seek to change a problem's underlying cause. Tucker and colleagues' qualitative study examined the daily problem-solving skills of nurses. 4 The researchers collected data related to actual situations and responses to develop theoretical concepts about the phenomenon of problem-solving behavior using observations of 22 nurses on all three shifts. The outcome demonstrated that nurses do whatever it takes in the moment to take care of their patients, use trial and error to find a solution, and only involve others who are closest work friends in problem solving rather than reporting to the resource that could solve the problem.",

Nurse leaders should consider implementing proven solutionseeking frameworks and problemsolving techniques such as Lean methodology and offering opportunities such as nursing fellowship programs to exercise nurses' critical-thinking skills. There are numerous examples of nurses achieving significant improvements in quality, safety, and patient outcomes, with guidance and frameworks for improvement. Lessons from Florence Nightingale are just as relevant today as they were more than 150 years ago: Nurse leaders must embrace the importance of nurturing highly motivated nurses who are critical thinkers.",

Lean concepts seek to create a continuous improvement culture in organizations by developing a management system that focuses on improving quality, safety, cost, and healthcare delivery processes. 6 When an organization commits to developing a Lean transformation, it's essential to assess the state of nurses' improvement thinking and attitudes. For example, Roszell and Lynn sought to measure the success of Lean management implementation in their organization from the nurses' perspective by developing the frontline improvement thinking (FIT) tool. 7 The nurses were asked to provide their perceptions of Lean's impact on the organization, the unit, and the individual. Data from the FIT tool can be used to prioritize and focus Lean management training and improvement efforts and identify Lean mentors, coaches, and change agents. Nurses who elevate to the level of coach should be afforded opportunities for more in-depth exposure to Lean management and performance improvement techniques through extensive training programs.",

Like Nightingale and the Scutari nurses, frontline nurses were taught to make improvements and then measure the outcomes. The quality improvements measured included falls with injury, sepsis mortality, central lineassociated bloodstream infections (clabsi), hospital-acquired pressure injuries, ventilator-acquired pneumonia (VAP), medication administration errors, and acute myocardial infarction mortality. Forty-three percent of the hospitals reduced falls with injury, 77.1% improved sepsis mortality, 82.9% improved clabsi rates, 69.7% improved VAP rates, 100% reduced medication administration errors, and 100% reduced acute myocardial infarction mortality. 8 The results achieved by these nurse-led quality improvement projects are powerful and impactful.",
