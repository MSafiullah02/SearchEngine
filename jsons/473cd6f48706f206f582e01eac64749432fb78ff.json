There are many scientifically valid approaches towards gaining an understanding of how we came to be human. Prominent among these approaches are: developmental, cognitive, social, and behavioral comparisons of humans with other primates; the paleontology and archeology of human ancestors; and the systematic genetic comparison of humans with other primates. Given the remarkable progress of molecular biology techniques, the deciphering of most of the human genome (Lander et al., 2001; Venter et al., 2001) , and the relative ease of obtaining genomic DNA noninvasively from humans and other primates, the genetic approach should, in principle, be somewhat easier than the others mentioned. In fact, apart from the general realization that our genomic DNA sequences are remarkably similar to those of the great apes (King and Wilson, 1975; Sibley and Ahlquist, 1987; Caccone and Powell, 1989; Goodman et al., 1994; Ruvolo, 1997; Takahata and Satta, 1997; Kaessmann et al., 2001; Chen and Li, 2001) , there have been relatively few specific genetic differences between humans and apes uncovered to date (reviewed in Gagneux and Varki, 2001) .

These genes can be transcribed into their corresponding RNA sequences, which in turn are translated into proteins. This \"central paradigm\" of molecular biology, i.e., that DNA makes RNA makes protein, has dominated recent approaches to understanding how living things work. However, there are several reasons why this scientifically powerful reductionist approach cannot fully explain the structure and function of complex multicellular organisms like humans. One reason is that DNA itself is of little use unless the genes it encodes are expressed (transcribed to RNA, and hence translated into proteins)-and gene expression is profoundly influenced by the physical, ecological, biological, and social milieu in which an organism exists. Indeed, the social and cultural activities of humans must have a major impact on gene expression within the species, as well as in the many other species that humans interact with. A second reason is that besides DNA, RNA, and proteins, there are two other major classes of molecules that are required to create almost all life forms that we know of: lipids and sugars (glycans). Glycans fall into two general categories: the more familiar small sugars like glucose that are a major source of energy, and the less wellknown glycan chains that are attached to many proteins and lipids, particularly on the surface of cells (Varki, 1999a) . Indeed, there are no extant free- living organisms whose cells are not each covered with a dense coating of these glycan chains, comprising a so-called \"glycocalyx\" that is no less obvious than the icing on a birthday cake. These complex cell-surface sugar chains are the products of a specialized intracellular machinery whose synthesis and organization are themselves dictated by the expression of several hundred genes (Varki and Marth, 1995; Varki, 1998) . This machinery is supplemented to an unknown extent by the incorporation of sugar building blocks from dietary sources into endogenous biosynthetic pathways (Freeze, 1999) . Given their ubiquitous occurrence in nature and their dominant presence on the surface of cells, it is not surprising that these sugar chains are intimately involved in the interactions between cells, both within an organism, and between organisms. A third limitation of the DNA-RNA-protein paradigm for explaining humans is that the human genome seems to have less than 35,000 genes (Lander et al., 2001; Venter et al., 2001) . Thus, there cannot possibly be a \"gene for\" each specific biological entity or function. Rather, the genetic contribution to the structure and function of most aspects of an organism arise from the combinatorial effects of multiple genes, gene regulation mechanisms, and gene products that act upon one another in various ways, under the constant influence of environmental factors. The attachment of glycan chains to proteins and lipids (so-called glycosylation) is a prime example of such a \"postgenomic\" process, wherein new biological entities or functions result from the action of one set of genes on the products of other genes.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 1526, "end": 1540, "text": "(Varki, 1999a)", "ref_id": "BIBREF139"}, {"start": 1965, "end": 1988, "text": "(Varki and Marth, 1995;", "ref_id": "BIBREF142"}, {"start": 1989, "end": 2001, "text": "Varki, 1998)", "ref_id": "BIBREF138"}, {"start": 2161, "end": 2175, "text": "(Freeze, 1999)", "ref_id": "BIBREF25"}, {"start": 2562, "end": 2583, "text": "(Lander et al., 2001;", "ref_id": "BIBREF72"}, {"start": 2584, "end": 2604, "text": "Venter et al., 2001)", "ref_id": "BIBREF143"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "GLYCOSYLATION OF CELL SURFACES"}, {"text": "Despite these considerations, studies of the structure and biology of glycans have lagged far behind those of DNA, RNA, proteins, and lipids. There are many reasons for this, including the branching and complexity of these sugar chains, the lack of an easily recognizable template-driven functional \"code,\" and technical limitations in studying their structure and function. Recent advances have substantially reduced this technical gap, opening up a new field now called glycobiology (Rademacher et al., 1988; Varki, 1999a) . Thus, as with genomics (determining the total genomic DNA of an organism), transcriptomics (elucidation of the complete set of genes expressed in a given cell type in a given situation), and proteomics (the description of all proteins found in a given cell type in a given situation), we are just beginning to enter the era of glycomics (elucidation of the complete array of glycans found on a given cell type in a given situation).", "cite_spans": [{"start": 485, "end": 510, "text": "(Rademacher et al., 1988;", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 511, "end": 524, "text": "Varki, 1999a)", "ref_id": "BIBREF139"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "GLYCOSYLATION OF CELL SURFACES"}, {"text": "A microbial organism approaching a mammalian cell surface would likely first encounter members of a family of sugars called sialic acids, which tend to be the outermost units on the glycan chains attached to the proteins and lipids below (Fig. 1) .

There are more than 40 kinds of sialic acids known in nature, and most are derived via biosynthetic modifications of a parent molecule called N-acetylneuraminic acid (Neu5Ac) (Fig. 2) . Further complexity arises from the fact that sialic acids can be attached to the underlying sugar chain in several different types of linkages (Tsuji et al., 1996) . While many of these kinds and linkages of sialic acids can be found within a single species, there are also marked species-specific differences with regard to their relative amounts and/or distribution. Likewise, even within a single species, there can be substantial differences between different cell types in the pattern and composition of their sialic acids. The evolution of this remarkable structural complexity is probably related to the diverse biological roles of these sialic acids in different cell types. 2 .

It is well-known that a wide variety of human and animal pathogens use cell-surface sialic acids to either gain an initial foothold on the cells they infect or to target toxic molecules that they secrete (Sandvig et al., 1991; Escalante et al., 1995; Sharon, 1996; Varki, 1997 Varki, , 1999b Gagneux and Varki, 1999; Karlsson, 1998 Karlsson, , 2000  Fig. 3 for examples). If these were the sole functions of sialic acids, the detrimental consequences to deuterostome animals should have caused these sugars to be eliminated and/or replaced by others during the course of evolution. However, the absence of sialic acids is lethal during early mouse embryogenesis (W. Reutter, personal communication), and genetic modifications of sialic acid linkages in mice cause significant pathologies (Priatel et al., 2000; Hennet et al., 1998) , indicating that these molecules also have critical endogenous functions. Some of these functions are primarily structural or physical, e.g., aiding the filtration function of the kidneys or providing negative charge repulsion between cells in the blood stream. In the brain, this type of negative charge repulsion becomes enhanced and specialized by the formation of long chains of sialic acids (called polysialic acids). These can serve to physically separate neurons and neuronal extensions and hence participate in what can be loosely called \"brain plasticity\" at the organizational level (Rutishauser and Landmesser, 1996) . Over the last two decades, it has become clear that sialic acids are also recognized by specific receptors within the same animals that synthesize these sugars (Bevilacqua and Nelson, 1993; Kelm et al., 1994b; Varki, 1994 Varki, , 1997 Powell and Varki, 1995; Crocker and Feizi, 1996; Kansas, 1996; Collins et al., 1997a; Kelm and Schauer, 1997; Crocker et al., 1998; Brinkman-Van der Linden et al., 2000; Crocker and Varki, 2001a,b; see Fig. 3 for examples). Emerging evidence indicates that these receptors, particularly a family called the Siglecs (Crocker and Varki, 2001a,b; , are able to recognize the diversity in sialic acids, and their linkages to underlying sugars. An additional set of biological roles for sialic acids is found in certain microbial organisms that decorate their cell surfaces with sialic acids (Troy, 1992; Wessels et al., 1989; Bozue et al., 1999) , thereby allowing them to evade recognition and destruction by certain vertebrate immune mechanisms. These examples occur despite the fact that sialic acids seem to be otherwise restricted to the deuterostome lineage of animals. The best explanation can be found in the fact that all of these microorganisms are vertebrate pathogens (see examples in Fig. 3 ). Since surface sialic acids limit activation of multiple functions of the immune system, these pathogenic organisms likely benefit from coating themselves with these sugars. This form of molecular mimicry may have occurred mostly via convergent evolution, wherein these microorganisms evolved a variety of ways either to make their own sialic acids or to procure them from their vertebrate hosts.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 357, "end": 379, "text": "(Sandvig et al., 1991;", "ref_id": "BIBREF109"}, {"start": 380, "end": 403, "text": "Escalante et al., 1995;", "ref_id": "BIBREF24"}, {"start": 404, "end": 417, "text": "Sharon, 1996;", "ref_id": "BIBREF115"}, {"start": 418, "end": 429, "text": "Varki, 1997", "ref_id": "BIBREF137"}, {"start": 430, "end": 444, "text": "Varki, , 1999b", "ref_id": "BIBREF140"}, {"start": 445, "end": 469, "text": "Gagneux and Varki, 1999;", "ref_id": "BIBREF30"}, {"start": 470, "end": 484, "text": "Karlsson, 1998", "ref_id": "BIBREF57"}, {"start": 485, "end": 501, "text": "Karlsson, , 2000", "ref_id": "BIBREF58"}, {"start": 502, "end": 502, "text": "", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 941, "end": 963, "text": "(Priatel et al., 2000;", "ref_id": "BIBREF99"}, {"start": 964, "end": 984, "text": "Hennet et al., 1998)", "ref_id": "BIBREF39"}, {"start": 1579, "end": 1613, "text": "(Rutishauser and Landmesser, 1996)", "ref_id": "BIBREF106"}, {"start": 1776, "end": 1805, "text": "(Bevilacqua and Nelson, 1993;", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1806, "end": 1825, "text": "Kelm et al., 1994b;", "ref_id": "BIBREF65"}, {"start": 1826, "end": 1837, "text": "Varki, 1994", "ref_id": "BIBREF136"}, {"start": 1838, "end": 1851, "text": "Varki, , 1997", "ref_id": "BIBREF137"}, {"start": 1852, "end": 1875, "text": "Powell and Varki, 1995;", "ref_id": "BIBREF98"}, {"start": 1876, "end": 1900, "text": "Crocker and Feizi, 1996;", "ref_id": "BIBREF14"}, {"start": 1901, "end": 1914, "text": "Kansas, 1996;", "ref_id": "BIBREF56"}, {"start": 1915, "end": 1937, "text": "Collins et al., 1997a;", "ref_id": "BIBREF12"}, {"start": 1938, "end": 1961, "text": "Kelm and Schauer, 1997;", "ref_id": "BIBREF63"}, {"start": 1962, "end": 1983, "text": "Crocker et al., 1998;", "ref_id": "BIBREF18"}, {"start": 1984, "end": 2021, "text": "Brinkman-Van der Linden et al., 2000;", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}, {"start": 2022, "end": 2049, "text": "Crocker and Varki, 2001a,b;", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2050, "end": 2060, "text": "see Fig. 3", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2167, "end": 2195, "text": "(Crocker and Varki, 2001a,b;", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2439, "end": 2451, "text": "(Troy, 1992;", "ref_id": "BIBREF131"}, {"start": 2452, "end": 2473, "text": "Wessels et al., 1989;", "ref_id": "BIBREF148"}, {"start": 2474, "end": 2493, "text": "Bozue et al., 1999)", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 142, "end": 149, "text": "(Fig. 3", "ref_id": "FIGREF3"}, {"start": 503, "end": 509, "text": "Fig. 3", "ref_id": "FIGREF3"}, {"start": 2845, "end": 2851, "text": "Fig. 3", "ref_id": "FIGREF3"}], "section": "THE BIOCHEMISTRY OF SIALIC ACIDS"}, {"text": "While there are many kinds of sialic acids in nature (Gottschalk, 1960; Rosenberg and Schengrund, 1976; Schauer, 1982; Varki, 1992; Ye et al., 1994; Inoue et al., 1996; Varki, 1999b; , the surfaces of most cell types in the mammalian species studied to date tend to be dominated by two major kinds: N-acetylneuraminic acid (Neu5Ac) and N-glycolylneuraminic acid (Neu5Gc). Neu5Gc is different from Neu5Ac only by an additional oxygen atom (see arrow in Fig. 2 ). In order for sialic acids to get attached to glycoproteins and glycolipids, they must first be \"activated\" by conversion to their respective sugar nucleotide derivatives. Thus, the common sialic acid Neu5Ac is converted to cytidine-monophosphate-Neu5Ac (CMP-Neu5Ac), which is then used as a high-energy donor for attaching Neu5Ac to newly made glycoproteins and glycolipids that are on their way to the cell surface. The synthesis of the Neu5Gc form of sialic acid takes place initially at the level of this sugar nucleotide precursor (Shaw and Schauer, 1988; Bouhours and Bouhours, 1989; Muchmore et al., 1989; Kozutsumi et al., 1990; Shaw et al., 1992 Shaw et al., , 1994 Takematsu et al., 1994; Kawano et al., 1995; Schlenzka et al., 1996) . Thus, as shown in Figure 4 , an enzyme called CMP-Neu5Ac hydroxylase (hereafter referred to as CMAH) catalyzes the transfer of one oxygen atom to CMP-Neu5Ac, generating CMP-Neu5Gc. The latter can now also be used as a donor to add Neu5Gc to molecules destined for the cell surface from their sites of initial synthesis within the cell. The enzymes that actually transfer sialic acids to glycoproteins and glycolipids (called sialyltransferases) can typically use both CMP-Neu5Ac and CMP-Neu5Gc as donors . Thus, the ratio of these two major sialic acids found on a given cell surface is likely to be largely determined by the ratio within the sugar nucleotide donor pool available in that cell type. (Varki, 1999b; Traving and Schauer, 1998) can be divided into the general groupings indicated. M, microorganism or toxin.

However, the methods they used could have missed small amounts of Neu5Gc in humans. An independent line of evidence suggesting that Neu5Gc is lacking in humans came from the medical field of hematology. For the clinical management of certain blood disorders, it becomes necessary to infuse serum from horses into human patients. Not surprisingly, these patients often generate an immune response against components of the infused animal serum and manifest a condition called \"serum sickness reaction,\" which contraindicates further infusions. Some investigators who studied the serum sickness reaction noted that the immune response was being generated at least in part against Neu5Gc, which is present in abundance on horse serum glycoproteins and glycolipids (Kasukawa et al., 1976; Merrick et al., 1978; Higashi et al., 1977) . This finding strengthened the notion that Neu5Gc is a foreign antigen to adult humans.

The next logical step was to examine the gene encoding the CMAH, to see if its promoter (regulatory) regions were mutated in some manner in humans, thereby altering its expression in adult humans. Indeed, two groups independently found that the CMAH gene in humans had suffered a mutation (Irie et al., 1998; Chou et al., 1998) . Surprisingly the mutation was not in the regulatory regions of the gene that might have modified its expression patterns between fetal and adult states, but rather in the coding region which dictates the amino-acid sequence of the enzyme itself (Fig. 5 ). The mutational event had deleted 92 base pairs of a single stretch of the sequences coding for the protein (corresponding to exon 6 in the mouse gene). Since amino acids are dictated by triplets of DNA base pairs, the loss of 92 base pairs (bp) also resulted in a \"frame-shift,\" thus markedly truncating the length of the final protein encoded by the human gene (Chou et al., 1998) . Moreover, this truncated protein is missing certain amino acids that were known to be critical for the activity of the enzyme itself (Schlenzka et al., 1996) . In contrast, examination of the CMAH gene from the chimpanzee and relevant portions from the corresponding genes from other apes (Chou et al., 1998) showed that they all encode an intact enzyme that is not very different from those originally cloned from mice and pigs (Kawano et al., 1995; Schlenzka et al., 1996) . Thus, it is clear that humans lost Neu5Gc on their cell surfaces because of an inactivating mutation in the CMAH gene. The gene is localized to chromosome 6 band p23-p22 in both humans and great apes (Irie et al., 1998; Chou et al., 1998) , which does not correspond to an area of known chromosomal rearrangement during hominoid evolution (Yunis and Prakash, 1982) . Furthermore, the remaining human intronic region is very similar in size to that in the intact mouse genome (Irie et al., 1998) , indicating that the deletion eliminating the Fig. 4 . Factors involved in biosynthesis of CMP-N-glycolylneuraminic acid (CMP-Neu5Gc). The enzymatic mechanism of the CMP-Neu5Ac hydroxylase that is primarily responsible for generating Neu5Gc in nonhuman animal cells is shown. The reaction takes place in the cytosolic compartment. The enzyme product CMP-Neu5Gc is the donor subsequently used for adding Neu5Gc to glycoproteins and glycolipids. CMP-Neu5Ac hydroxylase activity is present in great apes but not in humans. See text for discussion. 92-bp exon in humans must have been quite small. The corresponding genomic regions from the chimpanzee and other nonhuman primates were recently sequenced (Hayakawa et al., 2001) . The region containing a 92-bp exon of the CMAH gene turns out to have an adjacent AluSq element in all nonhuman primates studied, and both were replaced by a newly disseminated AluY element that is specific to humans (Alus are parasitic repetitive DNA elements found in large numbers throughout the primate genome). Thus, it is possible to propose a mechanistic model whereby an Alu-mediated replacement event coincidentally deleted the 92-bp exon and inactivated the CMAH gene sometime in the human lineage (Hayakawa et al., 2001) .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 400, "end": 419, "text": "(Irie et al., 1998;", "ref_id": "BIBREF51"}, {"start": 420, "end": 438, "text": "Chou et al., 1998)", "ref_id": "BIBREF11"}, {"start": 1059, "end": 1078, "text": "(Chou et al., 1998)", "ref_id": "BIBREF11"}, {"start": 1214, "end": 1238, "text": "(Schlenzka et al., 1996)", "ref_id": "BIBREF112"}, {"start": 1370, "end": 1389, "text": "(Chou et al., 1998)", "ref_id": "BIBREF11"}, {"start": 1510, "end": 1531, "text": "(Kawano et al., 1995;", "ref_id": "BIBREF62"}, {"start": 1532, "end": 1555, "text": "Schlenzka et al., 1996)", "ref_id": "BIBREF112"}, {"start": 1758, "end": 1777, "text": "(Irie et al., 1998;", "ref_id": "BIBREF51"}, {"start": 1778, "end": 1796, "text": "Chou et al., 1998)", "ref_id": "BIBREF11"}, {"start": 1897, "end": 1922, "text": "(Yunis and Prakash, 1982)", "ref_id": "BIBREF154"}, {"start": 2033, "end": 2052, "text": "(Irie et al., 1998)", "ref_id": "BIBREF51"}, {"start": 2754, "end": 2777, "text": "(Hayakawa et al., 2001)", "ref_id": "BIBREF38"}, {"start": 3288, "end": 3311, "text": "(Hayakawa et al., 2001)", "ref_id": "BIBREF38"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 24, "end": 31, "text": "Fig. 4)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 686, "end": 693, "text": "(Fig. 5", "ref_id": "FIGREF4"}, {"start": 2100, "end": 2106, "text": "Fig. 4", "ref_id": null}], "section": "HUMAN-SPECIFIC LOSS OF Neu5Gc EXPRESSION Modern comparative evidence"}, {"text": "Why did humans lose Neu5Gc production?

The most likely one is selection of a randomly occurring CMAH gene mutation by a lethal microbial pathogen that required cell-surface Neu5Gc for effective infection (see below for some examples of such current-day pathogens). Once such a mutation had thus become common in a human ancestral population, it could have undergone further selection because it conferred some additional benefits, or have simply drifted to fixation in the absence of any further selection.

However, systematic studies of other tissues of these dog and cat strains have not been reported. Thus, we do not know if it is only red blood cells that show differential expression. Chickens are the only species besides humans that have been found to generate a generalized immune response to Neu5Gc when infused with animal serum (Fujii et al., 1982) .

Again, a systematic study of chicken tissues has not been carried out to see if the presumed lack of Neu5Gc is true for all organs. Furthermore, the presence of Neu5Gc in ducks indicates that this is not a general feature of birds. Further studies of the CMAH gene in a wide selection of birds and carnivores seem warranted.

Thus, the human loss of Neu5Gc would have conferred protection from animal pathogens that prefer to bind to this sialic acid, while enhancing the success of pathogens that prefer to bind to Neu5Ac. As shown in Table 1 , this issue has not been thoroughly studied for most human pathogens. It is clear that certain microbes causing serious diarrheal diseases in farm animals like cows and pigs have a strong preference for Neu5Gc (Kyogashima et al., 1989; Ouadia et al., 1992; Willemsen and de Graaf, 1993; Lanne et al., 1995; Delorme et al., 2001; Schwegmann et al., 2001) , and humans are thus immune to infection. It is reasonable to speculate that this mechanism of resistance may have facilitated the domestication of some animal species, by limiting transfer of their pathogens to human caretakers. An even more speculative possibility is that this difference aided the worldwide migrations that brought humans into contact with diverse pathogen regimes of novel species of wild animals they encountered. In this regard, more information is needed about the sialic acid binding specificity of pathogens affecting animals that now live in very close contact with humans, such as dogs and cats. Perhaps they will turn out to prefer Neu5Gc, explaining the relatively low rate of pathogen transfer from these domesticated pets to humans. Another intriguing issue is that of the influenza A virus, the agent of epidemic and pandemic influenza in humans (Wilson et al., 1981; Taubenberger et al., 2000) .

Using the same kind of red-cell agglutination assay, spontaneously occurring HD antibodies have also been reported in patients who have never had exposure to animal serum infusion. While such serum reactivities are rare in normal human adults, they are found in a significant proportion of patients with cancer, as well as in diseases such as leprosy, rheumatoid arthritis, liver disease, and infectious mononucleosis (Morito et al., 1982 (Morito et al., , 1986 Nishimaki et al., 1979; Takiguchi et al., 1984) . At least two explanations can be considered for these phenomena. The first possibility is that as in cancer, some of these diseases involve proliferation of vascularized tissues (e.g., the granulomas of leprosy and rheumatoid arthritis). Thus, a low-grade immune response might be occurring against Neu5Gc that is being gradually incorporated into such tissues from dietary sources over time (see discussion below). The second possibility is that these antibodies emerge as a nonspecific consequence of the disregulation of the immune system that occurs in some of these disease states.

The latter finding is easily explained by the fact that human cells are typically cultured in fetal bovine serum, which is rich in glycoproteins carrying Neu5Gc. The fluidphase uptake of such glycoproteins into the lysosomes of cultured cells would eventually result in incorporation of the foreign Neu5Gc into human cellular glycoproteins and glycolipids (see pathway A in Fig. 6 ). The best evidence for this route of incorporation is that growing the cells in the absence of animal serum results in the eventual disappearance of Neu5Gc (Furukawa et al., 1988b; .

Indeed, the complete sequencing of the corresponding intronic regions of the CMAH gene from human and chimpanzee genomes (Irie et al., 1998; Hayakawa et al., 2001) reveals no obvious avenues for such a repair mechanism. Meanwhile, searches of gene databases show no evidence for any related proteins that might have a similar activity. Two other possibilities must therefore be considered to explain the traces of Neu5Gc found in normal human tissues. The first is that there could be an additional completely differ-ent biochemical pathway for the biosynthesis of Neu5Gc in mammalian cells. There is so far no strong evidence for such a pathway being active in humans. The suggestion has been made that the glycolyl group of Neu5Gc (which replaces the acetyl group in Neu5Ac) could also originate from an unusual high-energy donor called glycolyl-coenzyme A (CoA). Such a potential donor can in fact be formed via two known biochemical pathways: beta-oxidation of 4-hydroxybutyrate in mitochondria, or from 3-hydroxypyruvate by the action of pyruvate dehydrogenase (Vamecq and Poupaert, 1990 ; Vamecq et Fig. 6 . Uptake, metabolism, and turnover of Neu5Ac and Neu5Gc in mammalian cells. The general pathways for production and utilization of sialic acids in mammalian cells are shown. Thick lines represent cellular membranes, or intracellular membranous compartments, as indicated. The common sialic acid Neu5Ac is synthesized from a neutral precursor N-acetylmannosamine (ManNAc) in the cytosolic compartment, activated into CMP-Neu5Ac in the nucleus, and eventually pumped into the Golgi apparatus by a specific transporter (Lepers et al., 1989) . There it serves as a donor for adding sialic acids to newly synthesized glycolipids and glycoproteins that originate from the endoplasmic reticulum, and are en route to the cell surface or to be secreted from the cell. Sialic acids are eventually released in the lysosomal compartment as part of the overall degradation of glycolipids and glycoproteins and then pumped back into the cytosol (Verheijen et al., 1999) , to be reutilized as shown. Conversion of CMP-Neu5Ac to CMP-Neu5Gc occurs in nonhuman cells, and the subsequent fate of Neu5Gc is similar to that of Neu5Ac-recycling and varying degrees of reutilization. Double line indicates block in conversion of CMP-Neu5Ac to CMP-Neu5Gc in human cells. Two possible pathways (A and B) for incorporation of Neu5Gc of exogenous into human cells are indicated with dotted lines. Pathway A involves uptake of glycolipids or glycoproteins carrying Neu5Gc into the lysosomal compartment. This pathway could only operate in cultured cell lines, or in humans given intravenous infusions of animal proteins. Pathway B involves uptake of neutral precursor N-glycolylmannosamine (ManNGc) by passive diffusion across the plasma membrane, with subsequent conversion into Neu5Gc. ManNGc could originate from breakdown of dietary Neu5Gc in the gut. Both these pathways would effectively bypass the enzymatic defect in humans. Note that Neu5Ac and Neu5Gc can also be degraded back to ManNAc and ManNGc. While there are many known interconverting pathways involving ManNAc, the cellular fate of ManNGc is unknown, in human and nonhuman cells. There is also no known pathway for converting Neu5Gc back to Neu5Ac. Hence Neu5Gc tends to recycle and accumulate to high levels in cells that express the hydroxylase (Muchmore et al., 1989) .

The glycolyl-CoA would presumably donate its glycolyl group directed to a de-N-acetylated neuraminic acid (Zhou et al., 1994; Sjoberg et al., 1995; Mitsuoka et al., 1999) , or to a potential precursor form of sialic acids called mannosamine. However, there is so far no evidence for the enzymatic activity of such a pathway in human cells. The other interesting possibility is the incorporation of Neu5Gc from dietary sources. Studies of rats fed with radiolabeled sialic acids showed that a large fraction can be absorbed, and while most is excreted unchanged in the urine, a small amount of the label does get incorporated into tissues Schauer, 1981, 1984; Nohle et al., 1982) . The latter is thought to occur by intestinal conversion of the ingested sialic acids into the acylmannosamine derivative, which can be taken up into the circulation, absorbed into cells, and converted back into sialic acids (see pathway B in Fig. 5 ). We are currently studying the possibility that a similar pathway exists in intact humans. If so, it is possible that the traces of Neu5Gc found in normal human tissues are all derived from the ingestion of foods containing Neu5Gc. In this regard, it is of note that sialic acids are only found in animal foods, and that Neu5Gc seems to be very common in pigs, cows, goats, and sheep (Raju et al., 2000; Wang et al., 1990) , while probably being much lower in poultry and fish. It remains to be seen whether this pathway has any relevance to diseases associated with the consumption of red meats. There also needs to be a detailed survey of the amounts of Neu5Gc present in common foods of animal origin. Regardless of the mechanism, the question also arises whether there is a weak immune response to these traces of Neu5Gc in adult humans, and if so, what the consequences of such a response might be.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 118, "end": 137, "text": "(Zhou et al., 1994;", "ref_id": "BIBREF155"}, {"start": 138, "end": 159, "text": "Sjoberg et al., 1995;", "ref_id": "BIBREF120"}, {"start": 160, "end": 182, "text": "Mitsuoka et al., 1999)", "ref_id": "BIBREF82"}, {"start": 650, "end": 670, "text": "Schauer, 1981, 1984;", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 671, "end": 690, "text": "Nohle et al., 1982)", "ref_id": "BIBREF94"}, {"start": 1328, "end": 1347, "text": "(Raju et al., 2000;", "ref_id": "BIBREF102"}, {"start": 1348, "end": 1366, "text": "Wang et al., 1990)", "ref_id": "BIBREF145"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 935, "end": 941, "text": "Fig. 5", "ref_id": "FIGREF4"}], "section": "Infection and disease"}, {"text": "As mentioned above, both direct and indirect studies have indicated that Neu5Gc is present in some human cancerous tissues and possibly in fetuses.

The possible explanations presented above for the traces of Neu5Gc in normal tissues can be extended to fetuses and cancers as well, with the added suggestion that these rapidly growing tissues might be more efficient at scavenging Neu5Gc (or its breakdown product N-glycolylmannosamine) from dietary sources. Of course, we still cannot rule out an alternative pathway for the synthesis of Neu5Gc that becomes specifically activated in tumors and fetuses. Regardless of the mechanism(s) involved, the question again arises as to whether the presence of a sugar that is typically immunogenic in humans can in some way affect the outcome of a pregnancy or a malignant disease. Perhaps it will be possible to take advantage of the presence of Neu5Gc on tumors to design some novel approach to the treatment or containment of cancer. Of course, all of these considerations do not apply to cancers in other mammals, since they naturally have large amounts of Neu5Gc to begin with.

However, this possibility and its potential consequences have yet to be investigated. As indicated above, the intrinsic receptors that bind sialic acids within animals have only recently been described, and there may be more to be discovered. Correspondingly, we also know relatively little about the impact of Neu5Gc loss on the functions of these intrinsic sialic-acid receptors in humans.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Intrinsic functions of sialic acids"}, {"text": "The limited information available concerning Neu5Gc and intrinsic sialic-acid receptors is summarized in Table 2 . The best-studied examples to date are certain members of a family of proteins called the Siglecs (sialic acid-binding immunoglobu- lin-like lectins; Sgroi et al., 1993; Crocker et al., 1994 Crocker et al., , 1998 Kelm et al., 1994a; Powell and Varki, 1995; Crocker and Feizi, 1996; Crocker and Varki, 2001a,b; . Sialoadhesin (Siglec-1) is a large molecule found on tissue macrophage cells in various organs such as bone marrow, spleen, and lymph nodes. The sialic acid-recognizing function of sialoadhesin has been extensively studied, and it is clear that it binds well to Neu5Ac, but not to Neu5Gc (Brinkman- Van der Linden et al., 2000; Collins et al., 1997a; Kelm et al., 1994b) . Thus, human cells (which have an excess of Neu5Ac) have an excess of binding sites for sialoadhesin (Brinkman- Van der Linden et al., 2000) . Presumably as a secondary consequence, there is an obvious difference in the tissue distribution of sialoadhesin-positive spleen macrophages between humans and chimpanzees. Also, while only a subset of chimpanzee macrophages are sialoadhesin-positive, most human macrophages express this molecule (Brinkman- Van der Linden et al., 2000) . Interestingly, in all the above respects chimpanzee spleens are more similar to those of rats than to humans. The biological significance of these facts will not be known until the functions of sialoadhesin itself are elucidated. Meanwhile, it is interesting to note that sialoadhesin-positive macrophages are found in large numbers in pathological tissue specimens from patients with diseases such as breast cancer (Nath et al., 1999) and rheumatoid arthritis (Hartnell et al., 2001) , both of which appear to be rare conditions in the great apes (Varki, 2000) . Another Siglec that strongly prefers Neu5Ac over Neu5Gc is myelinassociated glycoprotein (Siglec-4a), which is expressed on Schwann cells and oligodendrocytes, and appears to be involved in organizing and maintaining the myelin sheath that surrounds the axons in the white matter of the brain and the peripheral nerves (Kelm et al., 1994b Collins et al., 1997b) . Curiously, the brain has very low levels of Neu5Gc, even in nonhuman mammals (see below). Thus, it is presently difficult to make a hypothesis about how the loss of Neu5Gc expression in humans might have affected the function of myelin-associated glycoprotein. Initial evaluation suggests that Siglecs 2, 3, 5, and 6 are probably not affected by the human loss of Neu5Gc (Brinkman- Van der Linden et al., 2000; Collins et al., 1997a; Kelm et al., 1994b Kelm et al., , 1998 .

The chimpanzee ortholog of Siglec-L1 has the arginine residue, remains fully functional in recognizing sialic acids, and turns out to preferentially recognize Neu5Gc over Neu5Ac. Reintroducing the ancestral arginine by \"repairing\" the cloned human molecule regenerated sialic acid binding, along with a similar preference for Neu5Gc . Thus, the single base-pair mutation that replaced the arginine residue on human Siglec-L1 seems likely to be evolutionarily related to the loss of Neu5Gc expression in the human lineage. However, we do not know which came first, and how exactly the two events are related. In the course of doing this work, we also examined the whole human genome for other Siglec-like genes.

As many of these products are glycoproteins, they can contain varying amounts of Neu5Gc originating from the nonhuman producer cells used. Fortunately, most of the animal cell lines commonly used to produce such agents (e.g., Chinese hamster ovary cells and baby hamster kidney cells) happen to produce very low levels of Neu5Gc. Furthermore, although erythropoietin (produced by Amgen) was later recognized to have very small amounts of Neu5Gc (Hokke et al., 1995) , microgram amounts of this therapeutic glycoprotein had already been injected repeatedly into many humans, without apparent evidence of an obvious immune reaction (Noguchi et al., 1996) . It is possible that the immune system of most humans is partially tolerized to Neu5Gc because of prior exposure to dietary Neu5Gc. If so, the reaction might be dose-dependent, and there should still be concern over recently developed products from the milk of sheep and goats which have very high levels of Neu5Gc (Gagneux and Varki, unpublished findings) . Another possible explanation for the lack of immune response to Neu5Gc on erythropoietin is that the primary antigens in horse serum are glycolipids (not glycoproteins) bearing Neu5Gc. Thus, there may be a lesser immune response to Neu5Gc on glycoprotein therapeutic agents.

Indeed, this is the issue likely to be of particular interest to the readership of this Journal. However, the fact that this happens to be the first such difference recognized should not be taken as any indication of its relative significance in human evolution. It is indeed possible that this genetic change came under strong positive selection pressure because it contributed towards the evolution of organs like the human brain. On the other hand, it may have simply aided in the ability of humans to evade certain pathogens of animal origin. A less likely possibility is that this gene inactivation was a fortuitous event that simply drifted to fixation in the immediate ancestors of modern humans, because of a population bottleneck caused by other unrelated factors. Further studies will eventually elucidate which of these possibilities is correct.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "CONCLUSIONS AND PERSPECTIVES"}], "bib_entries": {"BIBREF0":
