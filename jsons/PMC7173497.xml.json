The enzyme catalyzes reversible transamination with glutamine, aromatic amino acids, and a large number of sulfur-containing amino acids. It also catalyzes very effective cysteine S-conjugate \u03b2-lyase reactions. In addition, it is exceptionally active as both an aminotransferase and a \u03b2-lyase with many selenocysteine Se-conjugates.Glutathione S-transferasesA family of enzymes that catalyzes the reaction of the cysteinyl anion of glutathione with an electrophile generating the corresponding glutathione S-conjugate.Mercapturate pathwayA pathway that converts endogenous or exogenous electrophiles to their N-acetyl cysteine S-conjugate (mercapturate). The mercapturates are generally more polar and water soluble than the original electrophiles and are readily excreted in the urine and/or bile.Mitochondrial aspartate aminotransferaseA very important enzyme in amino acid metabolism and present in high amounts in all cells that contain mitochondria. The enzyme is important in linking amino acid metabolism to the TCA cycle (and to the urea cycle in the liver) and in the transfer of reducing equivalents from cytosol to mitochondrion in lieu of NADH. It is also a prominent mitochondrial cysteine S-conjugate \u03b2-lyase.S-ConjugatesThe first conjugate to be formed in the mercapturate pathway is the glutathione S-conjugate. The reaction may occur spontaneously between glutathione and electrophile but is most often catalyzed or accelerated by glutathione S-transferases. The glutathione S-conjugate is then successively converted to cysteinylglycine S-conjugate, cysteine S-conjugates, and N-acetyl cysteine S-conjugate.ThioacylationA process whereby a reactive sulfur-containing fragment generated from a cysteine S-conjugate \u03b2-lyase reaction on a cysteine S-conjugate derived from a halogenated alkene reacts with \u03b5-amino groups of key lysine residues in susceptible proteins.Thiomethyl shuntA series of reactions in which sulfur is added to an electrophile via the cysteine S-conjugate \u03b2-lyase pathway followed by an enzyme-catalyzed S-methylation reaction with S-adenosyl-l-methionine as methyl donor. The resulting thiomethyl compound may be excreted unchanged or following oxidation to a sulfoxide/sulfone.Toxicant channelingA hypothesis in which it is suggested that reactive sulfur-containing species generated from toxic cysteine S-conjugates are channeled from the active site of mitochondrial aspartate aminotransferase to \u03b1-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase complex, thereby accounting for the remarkable sensitivity of this enzyme complex to inactivation in tissues/cells exposed to certain toxic cysteine S-conjugates. The process may be of wider applicability if cysteine S-conjugate \u03b2-lyases (other than aspartate aminotransferase) are present in tight metabolic linkages with other enzymes.\u03b3-Glutamyl leukotrienaseA unique enzyme of the \u03b3-glutamyltransferase family that metabolizes the glutathione S-conjugate of leukotriene (LTC4), converting LTC4 to LTD4 (the cysteinylglycine S-conjugate of leukotriene).\u03b3-GlutamyltransferaseAn enzyme that catalyzes the removal of the glutamate moiety from glutathione S-conjugates, generating the corresponding cysteinylglycine S-conjugates. Usually, the acceptor molecule is water so that the other products of the reaction is glutamate. However, at exceptionally high, nonphysiological concentrations, amino acids or dipeptides may be \u03b3-glutamyl acceptors, generating a \u03b3-glutamyl amino acid or a \u03b3-glutamyl dipeptide, respectively. The enzyme is also referred to as \u03b3-glutamyl transpeptidase and GGT1.\n",

            "text": "Mercapturic acids (S-(N-acetyl)-l-cysteine conjugates) were first identified over 135 years ago and were soon recognized to play a role in the detoxification of certain halogenated xenobiotics (Bauman and Preusse, 1879). However, it was not until 1959 that the tripeptide glutathione (\u03b3-glutamylcysteinylglycine, GSH) was recognized as the source of the cysteinyl portion of mercapturates (Barnes et al., 1959, Bray et al., 1959). GSH is found in almost all bacterial, plant, and mammalian cells in high concentration, typically 0.5\u201312 mmol l\u2212 1 (Stevens and Jones, 1989, Taniguchi et al., 1989). The mercapturate pathway begins with the formation of a thioether bond between GSH and a xenobiotic in a reaction catalyzed (or enhanced) by glutathione S-transferases (GSTs). Subsequently, the resulting glutathione S-conjugate is converted to a cysteinylglycine S-conjugate by \u03b3-glutamyltransferase (GGT) and thence to a cysteine S-conjugate by various peptidases. Finally, the cysteine S-conjugate is N-acetylated to the corresponding N-acetyl-l-cysteine S-conjugate (mercapturate). The mercapturate is generally more water soluble than is the parent compound and is more readily excreted. (For reviews, see Chasseaud, 1976, Silbernagl and Heuner, 1993, Stevens and Jones, 1989.) Reactions involved in and associated with the mercapturate pathway are shown in Fig. 1\n.",

            "text": "Reactions involved in drug metabolism were originally assigned to two general categories (Williams, 1959). Phase I transformations serve to unmask a functional group and may involve reactions such as oxidation, hydrolysis, and reduction. Phase II transformations generate highly polar derivatives (conjugates), such as glucuronides and sulfate esters, which are excreted into the urine. Almost all these transformations are catalyzed by transferases (Cole and Deeley, 2006). It was originally thought that phase II reactions complete the processes begun by phase I transformations. Others have suggested that elimination of the glutathione S-conjugate from the cell may represent a phase III detoxification event (Ishikawa, 1992). It is now apparent that many xenobiotics are metabolized entirely by pathways that do not involve phase I reactions. Thus, many glutathione S-conjugates are formed from drugs and other xenobiotics without prior transformation. Moreover, glutathione S-conjugates are rarely excreted by the kidney because of their large size and amphiphilic character and the presence of GGT and dipeptidases in the proximal tubules. Glutathione S-conjugates are often excreted into the bile (Dekant et al., 1994, Marchand et al., 1988, Silverman, 1992) and/or further metabolized, especially to the mercapturate. As a result of ambiguities in classification, some authors have suggested that it may be time to discontinue the designations \u201cphase I\u201d and \u201cphase II\u201d metabolism (Josephy et al., 2005).",

Moreover, in special cases, the pathway may serve also to metabolize endogenously generated substances such as leukotrienes (\u201c\u03b3-Glutamyl leukotrienase\u201d and \u201cDeactivation/Detoxification\u201d sections). However, in other cases, a diversion of the pathway leads to the bioactivation of xenobiotics rather than to a detoxification. Thus, cysteine S-conjugates formed from some halogenated alkenes are converted to pyruvate, ammonium ion, and a reactive, toxic fragment by the action of cysteine S-conjugate \u03b2-lyases (\u201cBackground: Bioactivation of Halogenated Alkenes\u201d section). Leukotriene transformations and cysteine S-conjugate \u03b2-lyases are considered in more detail in the succeeding text.",

            "text": "GSH has many biological roles, including (1) defense against reactive oxygen species and free radicals, (2) defense against reactive electrophiles, though the action of GSTs (3) carrier of cysteine in a less reactive form, (4) cofactor in several enzyme reactions, (5) participation in eicosanoid biology, (6) maintenance of cellular redox state, and (7) transport of cysteine (e.g., Taniguchi et al., 1989). Recently, it has become apparent that GSTs have important roles, for example, in catalyzing addition of GS\u2212 to cyst(e)ine residues resulting in protein glutathionylation (Menon and Board, 2013, Townsend et al., 2014) and in the regulation of mitogen-activated protein kinases (Tew and Townsend, 2012). Many drugs and other xenobiotics or their metabolites are directly electrophilic and are thus capable of causing cellular damage in vivo. By intercepting these potentially harmful electrophiles, GSH is important in the defense against foreign substances. GSH is a \u201csoft\u201d nucleophile (i.e., the sulfur is of low electronegativity and high polarizability and is easily oxidized) and preferentially reacts with \u201csoft\u201d electrophiles (i.e., compounds that contain an acceptor atom with high polarizability, low electronegativity, and often unshared p or d valence electrons). Thus, reactions of GSH with electrophiles often proceed at a measurable rate in the absence of a catalyst (Koob and Dekant, 1991), but in general, the reaction is accelerated by the action of GSTs. These enzymes are widespread in nature and are present in most mammalian tissues. In the mammalian liver, GSTs account for > 3\u201310% of the soluble protein (Ketterer and Christodoulides, 1994). The cytosolic forms are dimers with monomer M\nr of \u223c 25 \u00d7 103. Many GST isozymes have been identified in the rat (Ketterer and Christodoulides, 1994). Cytosolic GSTs are now usually classified into several classes (A (alpha), M (mu), P (pi), T (theta), Z (zeta), O (omega), and S (sigma)) according to their isoelectric point, substrate and inhibitor properties, antibody recognition, and N-terminal amino acid sequences. GSTs may also be broadly classified on the basis of their cellular location, namely, microsomal, mitochondrial, and cytosolic (Hayes et al., 2005). The enzymes contain a binding site for GSH (nucleophile) and a separate binding site for hydrophobic compounds with electrophilic centers. GSTs are highly specific for GSH as the nucleophile but, depending on the isozyme, exhibit wide and overlapping substrate specificities with regard to the electrophilic substrate. Binding of GSH to the active site facilitates ionization to the nucleophilic thiolate anion (GS\u2212) (Ketterer and Christodoulides, 1994).",

The enzyme that cleaves the \u03b3-glutamyl bond of GSH and glutathione S-conjugates was subsequently isolated and named \u03b3-glutamyltransferase (GGT, also known as \u03b3-glutamyltranspeptidase; Orlowski and Meister, 1965, Szewczuk and Baranowski, 1963). A second enzyme that cleaves \u03b3-glutamyl bonds (converting the glutathione S-conjugate LTC4 to the corresponding cysteinyl-glycine conjugate LTD4) was identified independently by two groups in the 1990s and named GGT-rel and \u03b3-glutamyl leukotrienase (Carter et al., 1997, Heisterkamp et al., 1991).",

With the cloning of the human genome, GGT pseudogenes and genes encoding truncated portions of GGT have been identified, in addition to several genes that theoretically could encode a full-length protein (Heisterkamp et al., 2008). Recent studies of a gene named GGT2, which is present only in humans and has 97% nucleotide identity and 94% amino acid identity with human GGT, have shown that this gene does not encode a functional protein (West et al., 2013a). GGT2 mRNA is expressed, and the protein is synthesized, but the protein does not autocleave into an active enzyme and is rapidly degraded (West et al., 2013a).

Human GGT consists of 569 amino acids (Goodspeed et al., 1989, Rajpert-De Meyts et al., 1988, Sakamuro et al., 1988). Only the first four amino acids of the N-terminus extend into the cytosol (see Fig. 2\n). All of the enzymatic activity takes place in the extracellular portion of the enzyme (Horiuchi et al., 1978, Tsao and Curthoys, 1980). The enzyme is translated as a single polypeptide chain and autocleaves into two subunits that remain noncovalently bound to each other (Kinlough et al., 2005, Nash and Tate, 1982, West and Hanigan, 2010). Both subunits are required for activity (Gardell and Tate, 1981). The human enzyme contains seven potential N-glycan sites. N-Linked glycans have been isolated from GGT and characterized (Yamashita et al., 1983a, Yamashita et al., 1983b, Yamashita et al., 1986, West et al., 2010).",

Rat GGT has been shown to contain two O-linked glycans, but no O-linked glycans have been reported for human GGT (Blochberger et al., 1989). Cotranslational N-glycosylation is required for proper folding and autocleavage of the human GGT propeptide into two subunits, although the N-glycans can be removed from the mature enzyme without altering its stability or catalytic activity (West et al., 2011). In addition, a CX3C motif within GGT is also required for proper folding and autocleavage (West et al., 2013a). Treatment of the large subunit by papain or bromelain releases a hydrophilic form of the enzyme that is catalytically indistinguishable from the intact membrane-bound enzyme (Ikeda et al., 1995a, Ikeda et al., 1995b). The crystal structure of human GGT has recently been solved (West et al., 2013b). The crystal structures of GGT homologues from Escherichia coli, Helicobacter pylori, and Bacillus subtilis were reported previously (Morrow et al., 2007, Okada et al., 2006, Wada et al., 2010), but the structure of the human enzyme is the first report for any eukaryotic GGT. The crystal structure of the human enzyme reveals a substrate channel with Thr-381, the catalytic nucleophile, in the deepest part of the cleft (West et al., 2013b). Many other insights into the enzyme were gained from an analysis of the structure, including the presence of a bimodal switch in the orientation of the catalytic nucleophile and the open conformation of the lid loop region of the enzyme (West et al., 2013b).",

The promoters are tissue-specific, and AP-1, AP-2, and nuclear factor \u03baB (NF\u03baB) binding sites have been identified in the promoter region (Chikhi et al., 1999). In the mouse, GGT is a single copy gene that can be transcribed from seven different promoters, which give rise to distinct mRNAs that encode the same protein but differ in their 5\u2032-UTR (Lieberman et al., 1995). Induction of GGT is tissue-specific, and murine GGT mRNA has been shown to undergo tissue-specific and developmentally regulated alternative splicing, which gives rise to both active and enzymatically inactive GGT proteins (Chikhi et al., 1999, Joyce-Brady et al., 2001). Binding sites for AP-1 and the redox-sensitive transcription factors AP-2 and NF\u03baB have been identified in the murine promoters (Chikhi et al., 1999). Expression of K-ras and Myc oncogenes has been shown to increase the transcription of Nrf2 and induce a series of genes including GGT, all of which are important in the cellular response to ROS (DeNicola et al., 2011). In Nrf2-deficient cells, GGT mRNA is reduced and is not altered by expression of the oncogenic K-ras, indicating that K-ras is signaling through Nrf2 to induce GGT mRNA. This was confirmed in Nrf2 knockdown studies.",

In each species, the mRNAs all encode the same protein but differ in their UTR. The sequence of the UTR reveals use of multiple promoters that are regulated in a tissue-specific manner. In vertebrates, GGT is constitutively expressed at a high level on the apical surface of the renal proximal tubules, the site of formation of mercapturates from glutathione S-conjugates in the kidney (Hanigan and Frierson, 1996, Law et al., 2012, Yamashita et al., 1983a, Yamashita et al., 1983b). In some tissues, GGT can be induced. The promoters contain binding sites for Nrf2, Ap-1, Ap-2, and NF\u03baB transcription factors, and induction of GGT under conditions of redox stress has been demonstrated in several species (Reuter et al., 2009, Joyce-Brady et al., 2001, DeNicola et al., 2011, Hanigan, 2014). In the mouse, alternative splicing of the mRNA has been shown to produce at least three GGT isoforms (Chikhi et al., 1999, DeNicola et al., 2011). One of the splicing events is developmentally regulated (Joyce-Brady et al., 2001). In humans, the high level of nucleotide sequence homology between human GGT and GGT2 has resulted in a lack of specificity among some of the primers designed for GGT, which is a confounding variable in many microarray studies of GGT expression in human tissues (West et al., 2013a).",

A large number of \u03b3-glutamyl compounds in which the glutamate moiety is unrestricted except for the \u03b3-glutamyl bond are substrates for GGT. These include GSH, GSSG, glutathione S-conjugates, \u03b3-glutamyl amino acids, and \u03b3-glutamyl p-nitroanilide (a substrate commonly used to assay enzyme activity) (Orlowski and Meister, 1963, Orlowski and Meister, 1970, Wickham et al., 2011). The \u03b3-glutamyl group of the substrate is transiently bound to the enzyme, and the reaction proceeds through a modified ping-pong mechanism (Keillor et al., 2005). The crystal structure of the human enzyme cocrystallized with glutamate showed that the \u03b1-carboxylate of the \u03b3-glutamyl moiety of the substrate is stabilized within the active site of the enzyme by forming hydrogen bonds with Arg-107, Ser 451, and Ser-452S (West et al., 2013b). The \u03b1-amino group forms a salt bridge with Glu-420. Cleavage of the \u03b3-glutamyl bond of the substrate, the first step in the reaction, results in the formation of an acyl bond between the glutamate and the catalytic threonine of the enzyme with the release of all but the glutamate portion of the substrate. The glutamate is released from the enzyme when the enzyme/\u03b3-glutamyl complex reacts either with a water molecule, yielding glutamate and free enzyme, or with the \u03b1-amine of an acceptor molecule (transferase or transpeptidase reaction), yielding a \u03b3-glutamyl amino acid and free enzyme (Taniguchi and Ikeda, 1998). The \u03b1-amine of a free amino acid or a dipeptide can serve as an acceptor for the \u03b3-glutamyl group (Thompson and Meister, 1977). The enzyme is routinely assayed by the development of a yellow color upon the release of p-nitroaniline from \u03b3-glutamyl-p-nitroanilide. The addition of an acceptor such as glycylglycine in a large excess (10- to 40-fold excess relative to the substrate concentration) accelerates the rate of the reaction (Thompson and Meister, 1977). The standard biochemical assay is conducted at pH 8.5, the pH optimum of the transferase reaction.",

            "text": "Analysis of the kinetics of the reaction indicated that, in the kidney, the GGT reaction is a hydrolysis reaction under physiological conditions due to the reduced pH in the proximal tubule and the rapid removal of amino acids (Curthoys and Hughey, 1979). The essential nature of this reaction was established with the development of GGT knockout strains of mouse (Lieberman et al., 1996). GGT-null mice were born at expected ratios with no apparent phenotypic abnormalities. However, they excreted high levels of GSH in their urine, failed to grow at the same rate as their wild-type littermates, and died by 10 weeks of age from a cysteine deficiency. GGT-null mice can be rescued by supplementing them with N-acetyl cysteine. Earlier work with cultured cell lines had shown that expression of GGT enables cells to initiate the release of cysteine from extracellular GSH (Hanigan and Ricketts, 1993). GSH cannot be taken up intact by most cells. In the knockout mice, GSH present in the glomerular filtrate passes intact through the proximal tubules and is excreted into the urine (Lieberman et al., 1996). In wild-type mice, GGT localized to the apical surface of the proximal tubules cleaves the \u03b3-glutamyl bond releasing glutamate and cysteinylglycine. The cysteinylglycine dipeptide can be cleaved into cysteine and glycine by any of several dipeptidases present on the apical surface of the proximal tubule cells (\u201cHydrolysis of Cysteinylglycine and Its Conjugates\u201d section). Cysteine can be synthesized from methionine or through a salvage pathway, but the knockout mice are not able to maintain an adequate supply of cysteine for growth and development while continuously excreting large amounts of GSH in the urine. The GGT knockout mouse becomes deficient only in cysteine, indicating that uptake of amino acids does not depend on GGT, as had been proposed by some investigators (Orlowski and Meister, 1970). A physiological role for the transferase reaction has not been demonstrated. A novel assay that measures the GGT hydrolysis reaction at physiological pH and osmolarity has shown that the second order rate kinetics for GSH and glutathione S-conjugates are similar (Wickham et al., 2011).",

S-Alkyl l-homocysteine analogs function as competitive inhibitors (London and Gabel, 2001). Finally, a new class of uncompetitive inhibitors of GGT has also been reported (King et al., 2009, Wickham et al., 2012, Wickham et al., 2013). Structures of bacterial GGT and human GGT with inhibitors bound provide insight into the mechanism of inhibition of the enzyme (Ida et al., 2014, Terzyan et al., 2015, Wada et al., 2008, Wada et al., 2010).",

GGT is expressed in many tumors and contributes to resistance to chemotherapy (Hanigan et al., 1999a, Hanigan et al., 1999b, Pompella et al., 2006). GGT is upregulated in preneoplastic foci of hepatocytes in rats treated with toxic hepatocarcinogens (Hanigan and Pitot, 1985). Elevated levels of enzymatically active GGT can be detected in the serum of patients with liver and pancreatic disease, including inflammatory disease and cancer (Engelken et al., 2003, Whitfield, 2001, Lee et al., 2007). Studies in animal models indicate that inhibitors of GGT may be useful in the treatment of asthma and reperfusion injury (Yamamoto et al., 2011, Tuzova et al., 2014). GGT activity is also detectable in some commercial lots of bovine serum that are used to maintain cells in culture and can affect studies involving GSH synthesis and regulation (Hanigan et al., 1993).",

            "text": "As noted earlier, Heisterkamp et al. (1991) identified a GGT-related gene, GGT-rel, in a human cDNA library. The product of this gene (i.e., GGT-rel) was shown to cleave the \u03b3-glutamyl bond of LTC4 (a glutathione S-conjugate) but not the \u03b3-glutamyl substrates routinely used to assay GGT activity. The nucleotide sequence revealed 39.5% identity between the amino acid sequences of GGT and GGT-rel. The similarity included a hydrophobic domain (amino acids 12\u201328) similar in location to the transmembrane domain of GGT, indicating that GGT-rel is also a type II membrane protein with the active site on the cell surface. Analysis of the kinetic activity of human GGT-rel demonstrated that it hydrolyzes the \u03b3-glutamyl bond of glutathione and glutathione conjugates (Wickham et al., 2011). The K\nm of GGT-rel for the substrates, including GSH, GSSG, and LTC4, is similar to those exhibited by GGT, but the rate of the GGT-rel reaction is 37-fold slower than that exhibited by GGT, resulting in a second order rate kinetic for human GGT-rel that is 37-fold lower than for GGT (Wickham et al., 2011). A study of LTC4 metabolism in three patients deficient in GGT showed increased levels of LTC4 but no detectible level of its metabolite LTD4 (Mayatepek et al., 2004). These data indicate that in humans, LTC4 is metabolized primarily by GGT not GGT-rel. Localization of GGT-rel expression in normal human tissues showed it to be expressed by macrophages present in many tissues and cells within the adrenal gland, salivary gland, pituitary, thymus, spleen, liver, bone marrow, small intestine, stomach, testis, prostate, and placenta (Hanigan et al., 2015). However, within tissues that express both GGT and GGT-rel, the enzymes are expressed by different cell types and have access to different substrates. GGT-rel is expressed on cell surfaces that are in contact with blood and intercellular fluids, while GGT1 is expressed on cell surfaces that have access primarily to fluids in ducts and glands throughout the body.",

They identified an enzyme in the mouse they called \u03b3-glutamyl leukotrienase, which has since been shown to be the mouse homologue of GGT-rel (Carter et al., 1997). Comparison of kidney homogenates from wild-type and GGT-null mice demonstrated that both GGT and GGT-rel cleave LTC4 to LTD4 (Carter et al., 1994, Han et al., 2002). No detailed kinetic studies comparing the activity and substrate specific of mouse GGT and GGT-rel have been published. It has been shown that in the mouse, acivicin inhibits both GGT-rel and GGT, but glycylglycine does not accelerate the velocity of the GGT-rel-catalyzed reaction as is observed for the GGT-catalyzed reaction (Carter et al., 1994, Carter et al., 1997). In mice, GGT-rel is expressed primarily in the spleen (Carter et al., 1994). It is observed on endothelial cells and is also localized to the capillaries and sinusoid throughout the body (Carter et al., 1994). There is also a GGT-rel homologue in the rat (Potdar et al., 1997), although there are no published studies regarding its localization or kinetics.",

The cDNA encodes 967 amino acids per subunit, and the sequence contains 11 possible glycosylation sites. Over the last 25 years, many related enzymes have been sequenced. APN is a type II metalloproteinase that belongs to the M1 family (Luan and Xu, 2007). The M1 family consists of at least nine members, five of which are integral membrane proteins (Albiston et al., 2004). They all possess the highly conserved HEXXH(X)18E zinc-binding and GAMEN motifs essential for enzyme activities (Luan et al., 2012). APN is important in modulating the activity of several peptide hormones (Albiston et al., 2004, Luan and Xu, 2007). The enzyme also serves as a receptor for coronaviruses and other human viruses and influences immune function, cell proliferation, secretion, and angiogenesis (Luan and Xu, 2007).",

APN is a homodimer (M\nr of the subunit, 130 \u00d7 103) that contains two zinc ions per enzyme dimer. The enzyme has a broad specificity toward dipeptides and oligopeptides, amides, and acrylamides. Usually, the N-terminal amino acid is cleaved. The best substrates generally contain an alanine residue at the N-terminus, but almost any amino acid can substitute, including proline. When the N-terminus is a proline followed by a hydrophobic residue, a dipeptide may be cleaved from the N-terminus (Tate, 1985, Tate, 1989). As a result, the enzyme can degrade a large number of peptides down to single amino acids (or occasionally dipeptides). The enzyme hydrolyzes a number of endogenous peptides, including the thrombin receptor activation peptide (Coller et al., 1993). The human enzyme is identical to myeloid marker protein CD 13 (Look et al., 1989).",

The enzyme, as is the case with GGT, can be readily released from membranes by treatment with papain. The amino acid sequence indicates that this enzyme, like GGT, is synthesized with an uncleaved signal sequence at its N-terminus, which serves as a membrane anchor (Tate, 1989). The human enzyme has been shown to possess an additional sorting signal that allows the enzyme to be segregated in the trans-Golgi network and then to the apical membrane (Wessels et al., 1990). APN, like GGT, is glycosylated (Naim et al., 1999, Tate, 1989). An intimate relationship exists between high-mannose glycosylation and polypeptide folding during the synthesis of the mature enzyme, the timing of which is essential for correct polypeptide folding (Danielsen, 1992).",

            "text": "Cysteinylglycine dipeptidase (synonyms, dipeptidase 1, cysteinylglycinase, microsomal dipeptidase, renal dipeptidase, and dehydropeptidase 1) is present in the microvilli of epithelial cells. The enzyme is a dimer (M\nr of the monomer \u223c 50 \u00d7 103) and contains four zinc ions per enzyme dimer (Kozak and Tate, 1982, Tate, 1985, Tate, 1989, Campbell et al., 1984, Campbell et al., 1988). The rat enzyme is glycosylated, but the human kidney enzyme apparently is not (Campbell et al., 1984). The enzyme is selectively inhibited by cilastatin, whereas APN is selectively inhibited by bestatin. This selectivity has allowed Tate and coworkers to estimate that about 65%, 60%, and 95% of S-methyl-cysteinylglycine-hydrolyzing activities of the rat renal, jejunal, and epididymal membranes are due to cysteinylglycine dipeptidase (reviewed in Tate, 1989). Furthermore, cysteinylglycine dipeptidase is the major activity responsible for the hydrolysis of cysteinyl-bis(glycine) and LTD4 in these membranes (Campbell et al., 1988, Kozak and Tate, 1982, Tate, 1989). The enzyme is also thought to be responsible for the hydrolysis of some \u03b2-lactam antibiotics such as perem and carbaperem (Campbell et al., 1984). The primary structure of the human cysteinylglycine dipeptidase has been deduced from the cDNA by Adachi et al. (1990a). The enzyme is located on the surface of the brush-border membranes (Tate, 1989). The cDNA codes for 411 amino acid residues beginning with a signal peptide of 16 residues (Adachi et al., 1990a). A highly hydrophobic region of 16 amino acids was deduced to reside at the C-terminus, but the sequence was later shown to be absent from the mature protein expressed in COS cells (Adachi et al., 1990a). The enzyme, unlike APN, is refractory to release from membranes with papain (Tate, 1989). It is released, however, by phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C (PI-PLC) (Tate, 1989). The enzyme is converted from an amphipathic to a hydrophilic form by this treatment. Adachi et al. (1990b) showed that the enzyme is anchored to the membranes at a serine residue via glycosyl phosphatidylinositol. Cysteinylglycine dipeptidase is more active with dipeptides such as cysteinylglycine, l-cysteinyl-bis(glycine), and S-methyl-l-cysteinylglycine than is APN (Kozak and Tate, 1982).",

However, J\u00f6sch et al. (1998) have reported that a cytosolic liver cysteinylglycinase catalyzes the hydrolysis of cysteinylglycine and model cysteinylglycine S-conjugates. Mammalian cells contain plasma membrane transporters for dipeptides and tripeptides (e.g., Rubio-Aliaga and Daniel, 2002). Thus, formation of the cysteine S-conjugate may occur intracellularly and extracellularly. The cytosolic activity may be especially important in species such as guinea pig and human that exhibit high hepatic GGT activity (J\u00f6sch et al., 1998). The same group later identified the enzyme as manganese-dependent leucyl aminopeptidase (synonyms, cytosolic aminopeptidase, leucine aminopeptidase, leucine aminopeptidase 3, proline aminopeptidase, and peptidase S; LAP3, LAPEP, and PEPS) (J\u00f6sch et al., 2003). These authors provided evidence that leucyl aminopeptidase is the major cysteinylglycine-hydrolyzing activity in the rat liver; leukotriene D4 is, however, a poor substrate (J\u00f6sch et al., 2003). This enzyme also appears to be important in GSH turnover in bovine lens (Cappiello et al., 2004).",

The importance of the biliary excretion system is underscored by experiments in which 1-naphthylisothiocyanate (ANIT) was administered to experimental animals. ANIT is a hepatotoxicant that induces portal edema, parenchymal necrosis, and inflammation of the bile duct epithelium. ANIT reacts reversibly with GSH. The conjugate is released to the bile where the reverse reaction results in bile duct damage and increased GSH concentration (Jean et al., 1995). Biliary cannulation protects rats from the nephrotoxic effects of hexachloro-1,3-butadiene and p-aminophenol (Gartland et al., 1990, Nash et al., 1984). This finding also emphasizes the importance of the biliary excretion as a first step in complex multiorgan pathways involved in glutathione S-conjugate and cysteine S-conjugate metabolism (Dekant et al., 1994).",

In some cases, the mercapturate may be formed in the small intestinal cells and released to the circulation (Grafstr\u00f6m et al., 1979).

Therefore, it is possible that although glutathione S-conjugates are usually made preferentially in the liver, some may be made elsewhere in the body. Indeed, for several xenobiotics, a major site for cysteine S-conjugate formation appears to be the kidney (Hassal et al., 1984, Kanhai et al., 1989, Koob and Dekant, 1990). The glutathione S-conjugates released to the circulation from the liver, gut, and other organs or generated directly in the kidney may be further processed in the kidney. Studies with isolated perfused rat kidneys revealed efficient renal removal of the glutathione S-conjugate and cysteine S-conjugate of hexachlorobutadiene (Schrenk et al., 1988a, Schrenk et al., 1988b). Removal of the conjugates by the kidneys was associated with toxicity. The nephrotoxicity was blocked by the GGT inhibitor AT-125 ((l-\u03b1S,5S)-\u03b1-amino-3-chloro-4,5-dihydro-5-isoxazoleacetic acid) and by aminooxyacetate (AOA), indicating the involvement of GGT and a cysteine S-conjugate \u03b2-lyase, respectively, in the nephrotoxicity of hexachlorobutadiene S-conjugates (Schrenk et al., 1988a; see \u201cRole of the Mercapturate Pathway and Cysteine S-Conjugate \u03b2-Lyases in the Bioactivation of Toxic Halogenated Alkenes\u201d section).",

Glutathione S-conjugates produced by the renal tubule cells can also be excreted into the lumen of the tubule (Kramer et al., 1987). The glutathione S-conjugate is metabolized at the brush-border membranes by GGT and APN/dipeptidase (Hughey et al., 1978, Jones et al., 1979). In this process, the glutamate is released to generate a cysteine S-conjugate and glycine (Curthoys and Hughey, 1979). The cysteine S-conjugates produced in the tubules (and S-conjugates arising from tissues other than the kidney reaching the tubular lumen via glomerular filtration) may be transported into the renal epithelial cells from the glomerular filtrate by active and passive uptake mechanisms (Anders, 2004). Both Na+-dependent and Na+-independent transporters have been implicated in the renal uptake of S-(1,2-dichlorovinyl)-l-cysteine (DCVC, the cysteine S-conjugate of trichloroethylene) (e.g., Anders, 2004, Lash and Anders, 1989, Schaeffer and Stevens, 1987a, Schaeffer and Stevens, 1987b). Most of these studies have focused on uptake of DCVC across the basolateral (peritubular) membrane of the renal proximal cells. Wright et al. (1998) showed that DCVC is taken up by a Na+-dependent transport system in isolated renal brush-border membrane vesicles. Several neutral amino acids but especially phenylalanine, cysteine, and leucine compete with uptake of DCVC across the luminal membrane in this system (Wright et al., 1998).",

They may be secreted unchanged for further metabolism, principally within the liver. Uehara et al. (1983) have described the presence of two energy-dependent uptake systems for leukotriene E4 in rat hepatocytes that are not inhibited by GSH or GSSG. Cysteine S-conjugates taken up within the liver are thought to be converted to the corresponding mercapturates and secreted to the plasma to be eventually excreted in the urine (Inoue et al., 1981, Inoue et al., 1982, Inoue et al., 1987). The cysteine S-conjugates within the kidney may also be N-acetylated to the corresponding mercapturate and excreted in the urine (Heuner et al., 1991) or be converted by cysteine S-conjugate \u03b2-lyases to pyruvate, ammonium ion, and a fragment consisting of the original electrophile modified to contain an \u2014SH group (\u201cThe Cysteine S-Conjugate \u03b2-Lyase Reaction\u201d section). As indicated in the foregoing discussion, once formed in the kidney or transported to the kidney, mercapturates are excreted in the urine. Mercapturates may also be released from the kidneys to the general circulation. However, mercapturates are also capable of being cleaved to cysteine S-conjugates by acylases within the kidney (see \u201cAminoacylase-Catalyzed Deacetylation of Mercapturic Acids\u201d section). The major interorgan pathways involved in the disposition of mercapturate and mercapturate intermediates are shown in Fig. 3\n.",

As reviewed by Cole and Deeley (2006), the ABC family in humans contains 49 members organized into seven subfamilies (A\u2013G). Probably, the most important glutathione S-conjugate transporters are multidrug resistance protein 1 (MRP1, ABCC1) and MRP2 (ABCC2) (Cole and Deeley, 2006, Nies and Keppler, 2007, Sibhatu et al., 2008, Slot et al., 2008, Cole, 2014). The ABCC2 transporter is important for the transport of LTC4 (Jedlitschky and Keppler, 2002, Nies and Keppler, 2007, Rosenberg et al., 2010). Additional ABCC members, including long MRP6, short MRP4, MRP5, and MRP8, may also be involved in GSH and glutathione S-conjugate efflux (Cole and Deeley, 2006). Interestingly, there are several mechanisms by which GSH may be involved in the ABCC1-catalyzed ATP-dependent transport of various compounds directly out of the cell: (1) transport of the glutathione S-conjugate, including LTC4, (2) GSH-stimulated egress (e.g., vincristine), and (3) GSH-stimulated efflux of the glutathione S-conjugate (e.g., the glutathione S-conjugate of nitroquinoline 1-oxide) (reviewed by Cole and Deeley, 2006). The ABCC1 protein also catalyzes transport of GSSG and apigenin-stimulated GSH transport (Cole and Deeley, 2006).",

The mouse and human LTC4 synthases have been characterized (S\u00f6derstr\u00f6m et al., 1988). LTC4 synthase is a membrane-bound enzyme (homodimer, subunit M\nr 18 \u00d7 103) that shares some homology with microsomal GST-1 and GST-3 (Lam, 2003). The terminus contains a protein kinase C consensus phosphorylation sequence, raising the possibility that the enzyme is phosphoregulated. It has recently been suggested that drugs targeting LTC4 synthase may be beneficial for treatment of inflammatory diseases associated with overexpression of this enzyme (Kleinschmidt et al., 2015).",

Most effects of the leukotrienes are exerted via interactions with specific receptors on the cell surface (Ishikawa, 1993). Two cell membrane receptors have been well characterized, namely, CysLT1 (synonyms, cysteinyl leukotriene receptor 1, cysteinyl leukotriene D4 receptor, and LTD4 receptor) and CysLT2 (Kanaoka and Boyce, 2004, Singh et al., 2010). CysLTR1 belongs to the G-protein coupled receptor 1 family. CysLT1 is the receptor that participates in cysteinyl leukotriene-mediated bronchoconstriction of individuals with and without asthma. Stimulation by LTD4 results in the contraction and proliferation of smooth muscle, edema, eosinophil migration, and damage to the mucus layer in the lung. This response is mediated via a G-protein that activates a phosphatidylinositol-calcium second messenger system.",

Two examples of bioactivation of endogenous compounds will be discussed here, namely, catecholamines and estrogens. Catecholamines are readily oxidized to potentially toxic o-quinones (Spencer et al., 1995, Spencer et al., 1998, Spencer et al., 2002, Vauzour et al., 2008, Vauzour et al., 2010). These o-quinones react readily with GSH and cysteine to form catecholamine glutathione S-conjugates and cysteine S-conjugates, respectively, which may account for the low levels of GSH in the substantia nigra of Parkinson disease (PD) patients. The cysteine S-conjugates of DOPA, dopamine, and 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid are present in the human brain (Spencer et al., 1998). Interestingly, the concentrations of these compounds are generally lower in many regions of human postmortem PD brain compared with control brain. However, the concentrations of these conjugates are significantly higher in the substantia nigra of the PD patients, suggesting that these compounds may contribute to the damage in this region of the brain in PD patients (Spencer et al., 1998).",

Previously, Dryhurst and coworkers established that the mercapturate of dopamine and 5-S-cysteinyldopamine are potent neurotoxins. The neurotoxicity of 5-S-cysteinyl catecholamines may be due to their further oxidation to benzothiazine species, such as DHBT-1 (dihydrobenzothiazine-1-(2-aminoethyl)-3,4-dihydro-5-hydroxy-2H-1,4-benzothiazine-3-carboxylic acid) (Shen et al., 1996, Shen et al., 1997, Vauzour et al., 2008). Dryhurst and coworkers have suggested that DHBT-1 can cross the outer mitochondrial membrane and irreversibly inhibit complex I (Li and Dryhurst, 1997, Li et al., 1998).

These compounds are potent respiratory complex I inhibitors in isolated mitochondrial preparations (Li and Dryhurst, 1997, Li et al., 1998, Shen et al., 2000). Complex I components and activity are markedly decreased in PD brain, whereas complexes II\u2013V activities are relatively spared (Mann et al., 1992, Mizuno et al., 1989, Schapira et al., 1990). A common feature of many neurodegenerative diseases is a decline in cerebral energy metabolism. In PD brain, this decline is due in part to decreased complex I activity. However, disruption of other mitochondrial enzymes/complexes of cerebral energy metabolism (e.g., \u03b1-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase complex (KGDHC) and pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDHC)) may also contribute to decreased energy production in neurodegenerative disease (reviewed by Gibson et al., 2005, Kiss et al., 2013). For example, KGDHC activity is decreased in PD brain (Mizuno et al., 1994). Interestingly, DHBT-1 and its electrophilic metabolites are potent inhibitors of KGDHC (Shen et al., 2000) and PDHC activity (Li and Dryhurst, 2001) in disrupted rat brain mitochondria, apparently via covalent modification of crucial cysteine residues.",

Estrogens may act either by an \u201cepigenetic\u201d pathway in which DNA is not chemically altered or they may be metabolized to products that damage DNA (Monks and Lau, 1994). Catechols are major metabolic products of natural and synthetic estrogens. They are readily oxidized to the corresponding o-quinones, which in turn are converted to GSH adducts (Monks and Lau, 1994, Wan and O\u2019Brien, 2014). Monks and Lau (1994) suggested that these glutathione S-conjugates may be released from the liver ultimately to be accumulated in the kidney as the cysteinyl conjugates. The cysteine S-conjugates may (1) react directly with DNA, (2) generate reactive oxygen species, or (3) be further transformed to insoluble polymers (possibly involving cyclization reactions) that cause local irritation and cell proliferation (Monks and Lau, 1994). Some evidence suggests that quinones derived from estradiol and specific glutathione S-conjugates of estradiol are potent inhibitors of human GSTM1-1 and GSTA1-1 (Abel et al., 2004).",

Many of these compounds are cytotoxic and mutagenic (reviewed by Anders, 2004, Anders, 2008). In the presence of GSH and a liver GST preparation, these compounds are converted to glutathione S-conjugates and eventually to alkenes. Depending on the structure of the dihaloalkane, the mechanism may involve E2 elimination, substitution followed by elimination, or both (Livesey et al., 1982). In the case of 1,2-dichloroethane and 1,2-dibromoethane, reaction of the dihaloalkane with GSH yields S-(2-haloethyl)glutathione and halide ion. There is evidence for the formation of an episulfonium intermediate (1-(glutathione-S-yl)thiiranium) from S-(2-haloethyl)glutathione as an intermediate in the formation of haloalkene (Livesey et al., 1982). S-(2-Haloethyl)glutathione may be converted to the thioether cysteine S-conjugate (S-(2-haloethyl)-l-cysteine) by the action of GGT and dipeptidases. The loss of halide ion yields an episulfonium cysteine S-conjugate (1-(2-amino-2-carboxyethyl)thiiranium). 1-(Glutathione-S-yl)thiiranium is thought to be the species responsible for the mutagenicity of vicinal dihaloalkanes by forming an adduct (S-(2-(N\n7-guanyl)-glutathione)) with DNA. 1-(2-Amino-2-carboxyethyl)thiiranium is thought to be the cytotoxic species (reviewed by Anders, 2008).",

In the first step, GSH forms an adduct with methylglyoxal (synonyms, 2-oxopropanal and pyruvaldehyde), a potentially toxic byproduct of glycolysis (Chakraborty et al., 2014, Allaman et al., 2015), yielding the glutathione S-conjugate S-d-lactoylglutathione in a reaction catalyzed by glyoxalase I. This enzyme is a metalloglutathione S-transferase that catalyzes a 1,2 hydrogen transfer (Creighton and Hamilton, 2001). In the second step, glyoxalase II catalyzes the hydrolytic cleavage of S-d-lactoylglutathione to free GSH and d-lactate (glyoxalase II reaction) (Cordell et al., 2004). Mitochondria require GSH to maintain redox balance, yet GSH is made exclusively in the cytosol. While there are well-defined mitochondrial uptake systems for GSH (M\u00e5rtensson et al., 1990, Booty et al., 2015), it has recently been shown that S-d-lactoylglutathione is an alternative source of GSH in mitochondria (Armeni et al., 2014). S-d-Lactoylglutathione is taken up by the mitochondria wherein it is hydrolyzed by glyoxalase II to D-lactate and GSH (Armeni et al., 2014).",

In other cases, some xenobiotics have been shown to undergo metabolic transformations that result, in part, in the formation of bis(glutathionyl) conjugates. Examples include sulfur mustards (Davison et al., 1961), melphalan (Dulik et al., 1986), hexachlorobutadiene (Jones et al., 1985), bromobenzene (Monks et al., 1985), chloroform (Pohl et al., 1981), and bromotrichloromethane (Pohl et al., 1981). The bis(conjugate) arises from an attack of a second GSH on an electrophilic center on the monoglutathionyl conjugate. The reaction may be nonenzymatic, but in most cases, the nature of the reaction is unknown. The mechanism of bis(glutathionyl) adduct formation with bromobenzene is complex. Bromobenzene can be converted to several products in vivo, but in one pathway in rats, it is sequentially oxidized to o-bromophenol, 2-bromohydroquinone, and 2-bromoquinone. 2-Bromoquinone is subject to attack by GSH at any one of three places on the ring, yielding three possible positional isomers. These isomers can then react further with another molecule of GSH to yield 2-bromo-3,5-(diglutathion-S-yl)-hydroquinone or 2-bromo-3,6-(diglutathion-S-yl)-hydroquinone (Monks et al., 1985). In the case of hexachlorobutadiene, microsomal GST catalyzes GSH adduct formation with elimination of HCl. A second addition of GSH and elimination of HCl yield the bis(conjugate) (Monks et al., 1985). In a similar reaction, dibromoethane is converted to the diconjugate in the rat liver (Eq. 14) (Nachtomi, 1970).(14)BrCH2CH2Br+2GSH\u2192GSCH2CH2SG+2HBr\n",

These sulfoxides are nephrotoxic, but the exact mechanism remains to be elucidated (reviewed by Anders, 2008). Part of the nephrotoxicity of DCVC, however, may be due to sulfoxide formation in vivo and subsequent Michael addition at the terminal carbon of the vinyl group by a suitable nucleophile. The nucleophile may be GSH. Indeed, S-(1-chloro-2-(S-glutathionyl)vinyl)-l-cysteine sulfoxide, formed by Michael addition of GSH and elimination of HCl, was detected in the bile of rats treated with DCVC sulfoxide. There was a marked decrease of hepatic GSH, which may have been depleted during the formation of the sulfoxide (Sausen and Elfarra, 1991). Some drugs (e.g., certain mustards) are also converted to mercapturate sulfoxides that are found in human bile (Barr et al., 2008, Teichert et al., 2009).",

In the thiomethyl shunt, the thiol product is methylated by thiomethyltransferase (Jakoby et al., 1984, Warrander et al., 1985). S-Adenosylmethionine is the methyl donor. The resulting thiomethyl compound is then a substrate for enzymes, such as the FMOs that oxidize thioethers to sulfoxides and sulfones (Ziegler, 1988). Further oxidation of the eliminated fragment could account for the formation of 14CO2 and inorganic sulfate from 14C-methyl-labeled S-methyl-l-cysteine (Horner and Kuchinskas, 1959).",

Relative toxicity of these mercapturates to the kidney and other organs depends in part on the comparative activities of cysteine S-conjugate \u03b2-lyases, cysteine S-conjugate acetyltransferase, and cysteine S-conjugate aminoacylases.

AAI can catalyze the deacetylation of several N-acetylated amino acids, of which N-acetyl-l-methionine is the best substrate. The enzyme also catalyzes the deacetylation of mercapturates derived from halogenated alkenes (Anders and Dekant, 1994, Giardina et al., 1997, Giardina et al., 2000, Heese et al., 1988, K\u00f6rdel and Schneider, 1976, K\u00f6rdel and Schneider, 1977, Uttamsingh and Anders, 1999, Uttamsingh et al., 1998a, Uttamsingh et al., 1998b). AAI activity toward haloalkene-derived mercapturates is widespread in mammalian tissues (Uttamsingh et al., 2000). The enzyme has been cloned from porcine, bovine, and rat tissues (Jakob et al., 1992, Mitta et al., 1992, Perrier et al., 2004, Raphel et al., 1999). The amino acid sequence of human AAI has been deduced from the cDNA (Mitta et al., 1993). Rat kidney, but not pig kidney, appears to contain two isoforms (Perrier et al., 2004). Pig kidney AAI shows strong sequence homology to renal dipeptidase and is now assigned to the M20 peptidase family (Liu et al., 2006). Pig kidney AAI, like the dipeptidase, is attached to membranes (Heese et al., 1988).",

The major physiological function is unclear, although it has been suggested to act on the terminal N-acetyl amino acids released by hydrolysis of peptides containing an N-terminal acetyl amino acid catalyzed by acylamino acid-releasing enzyme. It has not yet been possible to crystallize the enzyme. Nevertheless, Liu et al. (2006) were able to construct a useful homology model based on the known 3-D structures of several members of the M20 peptide family, site-directed mutagenesis, and docking studies with N-acetyl-l-cysteine. Previous workers suggested that the zinc ion was needed to hold the enzyme in the correct configuration but was not involved in catalysis. However, Liu et al. (2006) have presented a newer model for the catalytic reaction in which Glu146 functions as a general base, accepting a proton from zinc-bound water and shuttling the proton to the leaving group facilitating breakdown of the tetrahedral intermediate. Arginine 348 helps polarize the carbonyl of the acetyl group facilitating attack by hydroxide generating a tetrahedral intermediate.",

Part of the US population is exposed to haloalkenes from such sites and in the workplace (Wu and Schaum, 2000) and possibly through \u201crecreational\u201d abuse (Marjot and McLeod, 1989). In experimental animals, haloalkenes, some halogenated alkanes, and dichloroacetylene are toxic, especially to the kidneys (e.g., Dekant et al., 1994, Elfarra, 1993, Koob and Dekant, 1991). In humans, heavy exposure to trichloroethylene is associated with an increased risk of cancer to the kidney (Brauch et al., 2004, Rusyn et al., 2014, Alanee et al., 2015) and possibly to the liver (Hansen et al., 2013, Vlaanderen et al., 2013), PD (Gash et al., 2008), and damage to the fifth cranial (trigeminal) nerve, sensory nucleus of the brainstem (Buxton and Haywood, 1967), and other nervous tissues (Chiu et al., 2013). Cranial nerve damage appears to be associated with formation of dichloroacetylene from trichloroethylene exposed to an alkaline milieu. Dichloroacetylene is an exceptionally good substrate of microsomal GSTs (Eq. 2) and hence is a good precursor of the toxic cysteine S-conjugate DCVC (Reichert et al., 1976). Damage to the trigeminal nerve may be due to the toxic effects of DCVC or to activation of latent herpes virus by the toxic insult (Cavanagh and Buxton, 1989).",

Depending on the structure, halogenated alkenes may be metabolized by cytochrome P450 isoenzymes (especially CYP2E1) and/or by GSTs. The ratio of the two activities varies considerably among the various halogenated alkenes. For example, hexachloro-1,3-butadiene (Wallin et al., 1988) and tetrafluoroethylene (Odum and Green, 1984) are metabolized predominantly in rats via glutathione S-conjugation. However, trichloroethylene and tetrachloroethylene are metabolized mainly by cytochrome P450s, and only a small portion is metabolized by GSTs (e.g., Koob and Dekant, 1991), principally GSTA1-1 (Cummings et al., 2000). Nevertheless, although the cytochrome P450 pathway generates toxic species from trichloroethylene and tetrachloroethylene (Bull et al., 2002), a major contributor to the overall toxicity of trichloroethylene and tetrachloroethylene is the corresponding cysteine S-conjugate despite the fact that the glutathione S-conjugation pathway is quantitatively minor (Dekant, 2003).",

            "text": "The glutathione S-conjugate, cysteinylglycine S-conjugate, cysteine S-conjugate, and N-acetylcysteine S-conjugate (mercapturate) derived from halogenated alkenes are all nephrotoxic/hepatotoxic and in many cases nephrocarcinogenic/hepatocarcinogenic in experimental animals (e.g., Anders, 2004, Anders, 2008, Anders and Dekant, 1994, Anders et al., 1988, Boogard et al., 1989, Dekant, 2001, Dekant, 2003, Koob and Dekant, 1991, McGoldrick et al., 2003, Lash et al., 2014, Yaqoob et al., 2014, Cristofori et al., 2015). Some of these conjugates are also mutagenic in bacterial tester strains (Commandeur et al., 1991, Dreessen et al., 2003, Finkelstein et al., 1994, Kranendonk et al., 1997, Vamvakas et al., 1988a, Vamvakas et al., 1988b). The cysteine S-conjugate formed from trichloroethylene/dichloroacetylene (i.e., DCVC) induces expression of the proto-oncogenes c-fos and c-myc in LLC-PK1 cells (Vamvakas and K\u00f6ster, 1993, Vamvakas et al., 1993). The mutagenicity depends on the ability of the conjugates to generate chemically reactive thiols; GGT and cysteine S-conjugate \u03b2-lyases are key enzymes in this process. As noted earlier, the mercapturates derived from the halogenated alkenes are toxic because they can be hydrolyzed back to the corresponding cysteine S-conjugate by aminoacylases (e.g., Uttamsingh et al., 2000). Thus, the mercapturate pathway enzymes together with aminoacylases and cysteine S-conjugate \u03b2-lyases contribute to the bioactivation of halogenated alkenes. (For reviews, see Anders, 2004, Anders, 2008, Cooper, 1998, Cooper and Pinto, 2008, Cooper et al., 2011, Dekant, 2003, Dekant et al., 1994.) The reactive fragments generated from haloalkene cysteine S-conjugates by the action of cysteine S-conjugate \u03b2-lyases are especially cytotoxic in experimental animals to the proximal renal tubules, in particular to the S3 (pars recta) region and, to a lesser extent, the S1 and S2 (pars convoluta) region (e.g., Jones et al., 1988) and to isolated human proximal tubules (Chen et al., 1990).",

However, sublethal (priming) doses are autoprotective by stimulating cell division and renal repair (Korrapati et al., 2006). Acute renal failure in humans is associated with high morbidity and mortality rates. However, renal failure is potentially reversible if the patients are free of life-threatening complications. Korrapati et al. (2007) have pointed out that the pathophysiology of DCVC-induced acute tubular necrosis followed by acute renal failure in mice and clinical acute renal failure in patients is similar. These authors carried out a proteomic study of this clinically relevant mouse model of priming with low doses of DCVC to afford later autoprotection to the kidney. Whole kidney homogenates from treated and untreated mice were analyzed on 2D gels, and spots were identified by mass spectrometry. Expression of eighteen common proteins was shown to be greatly altered in the treated mice, including some enzymes associated with energy metabolism and stress response proteins. Although the proteomic approach to understanding renal disease is in its infancy, this model suggests that biomarker development will be useful in a variety of toxicological paradigms (Korrapati et al., 2007).",

Later, Schultze and coworkers suggested that the toxicity of DCVC is associated with a \u201cC\u2014S\u201d lyase reaction and formation of a reactive sulfur-containing species that adds to macromolecules, including proteins and nucleic acids (e.g., Anderson and Schultze, 1965, Bhattacharya and Schultze, 1967, Bhattacharya and Schultze, 1972). It was known for many years that several electrophilic xenobiotics (e.g., phenacetin, acetaminophen, and N-hydroxy-2-acetylaminofluorene) are thiomethylated in vivo. Thiomethylation was originally assumed to involve a sulfonium compound derived from methionine. However, Chatfield and Hunter (1973) showed that conversion of 2-acetamido-4-chloromethylthiazole to 2-acetamido-4-methylthiomethylthiazole in rats involves the mercapturate pathway and thiomethylation.",

When bromazepam was administered to rats, the corresponding mercapturate and 6\u2032-methylthiobromazepam were identified in the bile (Tateishi et al., 1978a). Tateishi et al. (1978a) also showed that the thioether bond of the cysteine S-conjugates of 2,4-dinitrobenzene and bromobenzene is readily cleaved by an enzyme present in rat liver cytosol. Incubation of the purified enzyme with S-(2,4-dinitrophenyl)cysteine yielded pyruvate, ammonium ion, and 2,4-dinitrobenzenethiol. Incubation of the thiol product with a microsomal thiomethyltransferase and S-adenosylmethionine yielded the corresponding thiomethyl compound (Tateishi et al., 1978a). Tateishi et al. (1978b) coined the name \u201ccysteine conjugate \u03b2-lyase\u201d to describe an enzyme that catalyzes \u03b2-elimination from a cysteine S-conjugate.

            "text": "Several studies have shown that many enteric bacteria contain cysteine S-conjugate \u03b2-lyases (Bernstr\u00f6m et al., 1989, Larsen and Bakke, 1983, Larsen and Stevens, 1986, Larsen et al., 1983, Saari and Schultze, 1965, Suzuki et al., 1982, Tomisawa et al., 1984, Wakabayashi et al., 2004). E. coli tryptophanase (a \u201ctrue\u201d physiologically relevant \u03b2-lyase) and a cysteine S-conjugate \u03b2-lyase in an extract of Eubacterium limosum were shown to catalyze \u03b2-elimination reactions with the cysteine S-conjugates of E-2-hexenal and 2-hexenol (Wakabayashi et al., 2004). The cysteine S-conjugate \u03b2-lyases purified from Fusobacterium necrophorum (Larsen et al., 1983) and F. varium (Tomisawa et al., 1984) have been partially purified and characterized. The enzymes have M\nr values of 228 \u00d7 103 and 70 \u00d7 103 and require pyridoxal 5\u2032-phosphate (PLP) as a cofactor. The enzyme from F. necrophorum catalyzes the C\u2014S cleavage of the cysteine S-conjugate of propachlor, BTC, and 1,2-dihydro-1-hydroxy-2-cysteinylnaphthalene. The propachlor conjugate was shown to be converted to N-isopropylacetanilide, pyruvate, and ammonium ion. The enzyme from F. varium is most active with aromatic cysteine S-conjugates, but some activity is noted with simple alkyl conjugates. A highly purified cysteine S-conjugate \u03b2-lyase was obtained from E. limosum (Larsen and Bakke, 1983). The enzyme has a M\nr of about 75 \u00d7 103 and is composed of two identical subunits. The enzyme is active with the cysteine S-conjugate of propachlor, trans-9-hydroxy-10-(S-(l-cysteinyl))-9,10-dihydrophenanthrene, BTC, and DCVC. It is also moderately active with the simple alkyl cysteine conjugate S-ethyl-l-cysteine. The enzyme does not require added PLP but is inhibited by carbonyl reagents suggesting the presence of a carbonyl-containing cofactor. Of interest is the finding that the enzyme is active with cystathionine, djenkolic acid, lanthionine, and cystine, suggesting that the enzyme is similar to PLP-dependent cystathionine \u03b2- and \u03b3-lyases. In contrast, the F. necrophorum and F. varium lyases do not exhibit activity with cystathionine. Bernstr\u00f6m et al. (1989) showed that rat fecal contents and the purified E. limosum enzyme catalyze the conversion of the cysteine S-conjugate LTE4 to 5-hydroxy-6-mercapto-7,9-trans-11,14-cis-eicosatetraenoic acid. Interestingly, the enzyme can catalyze the conversion of \u03b2-chloroalanine to pyruvate and ammonia, but it is not inactivated in the process. Many PLP-containing enzymes that catalyze this elimination reaction are syncatalytically inactivated by aminoacrylate intermediate(s) formed during the elimination reaction (\u201cCatalytic Mechanism of the Cysteine S-Conjugate \u03b2-Lyase Reaction and Syncatalytic Inactivation\u201d section). Finally, the E. limosum enzyme exhibits high activity with the S-oxide of propachlor (Larsen and Stevens, 1986). Eliminated fragment is presumably a sulfenic acid [RS(O)H].",

The fact that cysteine S-conjugate \u03b2-lyase activity is widespread in enteric bacteria and that a major portion of cysteine S-conjugates are excreted into the bile suggests that the gut flora may be important for the incorporation of sulfur into some xenobiotics (Larsen and Stevens, 1986). Moreover, it appears that the cysteine S-conjugate \u03b2-lyases of the enteric bacteria have different substrate specificities than do the mammalian enzymes. For example, the cysteine S-conjugate of propachlor is a substrate for the enteric enzymes, but germ-free rats do not metabolize this compound (Bakke et al., 1981). As noted earlier, certain sulfhydryl-containing fragments, such as that eliminated from DCVC, are exceptionally reactive and are likely to act locally. Whether cysteine S-conjugates, whose elimination products are very reactive, damage the gut and bile duct remains to be determined. Additionally, whether more stable thiol products generated from bacterial cysteine S-conjugates can be transported from the gut to other regions to exert toxic effects also remains to be evaluated (Larsen and Stevens, 1986).",

Moreover, the specific activity of the purified enzyme with S-(p-bromophenyl)-l-cysteine is relatively low (12.3 nmol min\u2212 1\n mg\u2212 1) compared with the specific activity exhibited by the most active cysteine S-conjugate \u03b2-lyases identified thus far (Table 1\n). Additionally, the cysteine S-conjugates of halogenated alkenes were not tested as substrates.",

Over the ensuing decades, many more mammalian cysteine S-conjugate \u03b2-lyases have been identified (Table 1). All are PLP-containing enzymes and include (1) the cytosolic enzymes kynureninase, GTK/KAT I, cytosolic aspartate aminotransferase (cytAspAT), glutamine transaminase L (GTL)/KAT III, alanine aminotransferase (AlaAT), and cytosolic branched-chain aminotransferase (BCATc) and (2) the mitochondrial enzymes mitochondrial aspartate aminotransferase (mitAspAT), mitochondrial branched-chain aminotransferase (BCATm), alanine-glyoxylate aminotransferase isozyme II (AGAT II), and GABA aminotransferase (reviewed by Cooper and Pinto, 2006, Cooper and Pinto, 2008, Cooper et al., 2011). In addition, high-M\nr \u03b2-lyases occur in both cytosolic and mitochondrial fractions of the rat kidney and, to a lesser extent, rat liver.

A \u03b2-lyase reaction with this compound will release 3-mercaptohexenal, which may be reduced to the corresponding alcohol. An alternative route may occur, namely, reduction of the cysteine S-conjugate of E-2-hexenal to the cysteine S-conjugate of 2-hexenol, followed by a cysteine S-conjugate \u03b2-lyase-catalyzed elimination to yield directly 3-mercaptohexenol. Both pathways are feasible. A series of alkanoates of 3-methyl-3-sulfanylbutan-1-ol ((CH3)2C(SH)CH2CH2OC(O)R) and a series of alkanoates of 3-sulfanylhexan-1-ol (CH3CH2CH2CH(SH)CH2CH2OC(O)R) have been detected in the fruit peel of Poncirus trifoliata (a close relative of citrus) (Starkenmann et al., 2007).

Starkenmann and colleagues have documented the importance of cysteine S-conjugate \u03b2-lyases in the generation of mercaptans in plants, such as green peppers and allium vegetables, and in mouth bacteria (Starkenmann and Niclass, 2011, Starkenmann et al., 2008, Starkenmann et al., 2011).",

The cysteine S-conjugate \u03b2-lyase reaction with DCVC (1) gives rise to pyruvate (2), ammonium ion, and a sulfur-containing fragment that has the theoretical structure 1,2-dichloroethylenethiolate (3) (Fig. 4\n). However, 1,2-dichloroethylenethiolate is extremely unstable and may tautomerize to chlorothioacetyl chloride [ClC(S)CH2Cl] (not shown) or spontaneously lose Cl\u2212 to form the highly reactive chlorothioketene (4) (Anders, 2004, Anders, 2008 and references cited therein). The chlorothioketene reacts with a variety of nucleophiles (Nu:) to generate a thioacylated adduct (5). In biological systems, the nucleophile may be macromolecules, such as nucleic acids (M\u00fcller et al., 1998) and proteins (Eyre et al., 1995). This chemistry provides an explanation for the previous finding of Anderson and Schultze (1965), who, as noted earlier, showed covalent incorporation of a sulfur-containing fragment from DCVC to macromolecules via the action of \u201cC\u2014S\u201d lyases.",

The eliminated sulfur-containing fragment (1,1-difluoro-2-bromo-2-chloroethanethiolate) was suggested to undergo conversion to a three-membered ring structure (3-chloro-\u03b1-thiolactone) with the loss of F\u2212 and Br\u2212.

In the rat, Compound A can form two glutathione S-conjugates, which are eventually converted to the corresponding cysteine S-conjugates. These cysteine S-conjugates are substrates of cysteine S-conjugate \u03b2-lyases giving rise to 2-(fluoromethoxy)-1,1,3,3,3-pentafluoropropanethiol and 2-(fluoromethoxy)-1,3,3,3-tetrafluoro-1-propenethiolate, both of which are converted to 2-(fluoromethoxy)-3,3,3-trifluorothionopropanoyl fluoride. Hydrolysis and the loss of HF and H2S yields 2-(fluoromethoxy)-3,3,3-trifluoropropanoic acid. Finally, the loss of HF and HCHO yields trifluoroacetic acid. Evidence suggests that a similar pathway for the metabolism of Compound A exists in humans. The pathway indicates that cysteine S-conjugate \u03b2-lyases are involved in the bioactivation of Compound A in humans, but this hypothesis has been criticized. Moreover, there are no confirmed cases of sevoflurane-induced kidney damage in humans. See Anders (2008) for a comprehensive review and original references.",

For example, pig heart cytAspAT catalyzes \u03b2-elimination reactions with \u03b2-chloroalanine, serine O-sulfate, and serine O-phosphate (John and Fasella, 1969, Morino et al., 1974, Ueno et al., 1982). The ratio of transamination to \u03b2-elimination depends in part on the electron-withdrawing properties (nucleofugacity) of the group attached at the \u03b2-position of the amino acid substrate. With \u03b2-chloroalanine and serine O-sulfate, only \u03b2-elimination can be detected in the presence of cytAspAT (Morino et al., 1974, Ueno et al., 1982). As noted earlier, several aminotransferases have been shown to catalyze a \u03b2-elimination reaction with TFEC (Table 1). In most cases, transamination was shown to compete with \u03b2-elimination. Presumably, \u2014SCF2CF2H is a less effective nucleofuge than is \u2014Cl. However, the \u03b2-elimination to transamination ratio also depends on the enzyme. For example, for mitAspAT with TFEC as substrate, the ratio is > 100 (Cooper et al., 2002a) but \u223c 2:1 for rat kidney GTK (Commandeur et al., 2000). Human BCATm can catalyze a \u03b2-lyase reaction with TFEC, but transamination cannot be detected (Cooper et al., 2003).",

More recently, we showed that rat liver mitAspAT is syntactically inactivated by \u03b2-chloroalanine and TFEC on average after \u223c 3850 and \u223c 2700 turnovers per enzyme monomer, respectively (Cooper et al., 2002a).

The eliminated sulfur-containing fragment is chemically very reactive (previous section).

            "text": "As summarized by Cooper (2004), GTK in vitro exhibits a broad specificity toward l-amino acids and \u03b1-keto acids. In general, the enzyme has a preference for l-glutamine, l-methionine (and many other sulfur-containing amino acids), l-phenylalanine (and some other aromatic amino acids), and the corresponding \u03b1-keto acids. As noted earlier, cysteine S-conjugates are also substrates of rat kidney GTK. Interestingly, l-selenocysteine Se-conjugates are more active aminotransferase and \u03b2-lyase substrates of rat kidney GTK than are the corresponding cysteine S-conjugates, in most cases by an order of magnitude or more (Commandeur et al., 2000). As a consequence, GTK has been suggested to be a possible target for selenium-containing chemopreventive drugs (Commandeur et al., 2000). l-Glutamine is the major amino acid substrate in vivo. The product of glutamine transamination (i.e., \u03b1-ketoglutaramate, \u03b1KGM) is rapidly removed by cyclization to a lactam and/or conversion to \u03b1-ketoglutarate in a reaction catalyzed by \u03c9-amidase. Transamination is therefore \u201cpulled\u201d in the direction of glutamine utilization. Major roles of GTK are to close the methionine salvage pathway by transamination of KMB, to salvage the \u03b1-keto acid analogs of essential amino acids, and possibly to generate cyclic sulfur-containing imines (reviewed by Cooper, 2004, Pinto et al., 2014, Cooper et al., 2016). In addition, the glutamine transaminases coupled to \u03c9-amidase may provide anaplerotic \u03b1-ketoglutarate as an energy source in rapidly dividing cells (Cooper et al., 2016).",

This ubiquity attests to the importance of these enzymes in amino acid metabolism. The two enzymes are also crucial components of the malate\u2013aspartate shuttle for the transport of reducing equivalents (in lieu of NADH) between cytosol and mitochondrion (Fitzpatrick et al., 1983). Oxaloacetate and \u03b1-ketoglutarate link amino acid metabolism to the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle. Coupling of an \u03b1-ketoglutarate-/glutamate-linked aminotransferase to AspAT and the glutamate dehydrogenase reaction permits the flow of nitrogen from amino acid, to glutamate, to ammonium ion. When this occurs in the periportal cells of the liver, this flow directs excess amino acid nitrogen toward ammonium ion for urea synthesis.

These enzymes belong to the fold type I family, subclass I. It has long been known that the two isozymes of AspAT can utilize amino acids other than glutamate and aspartate as amino acid substrates. For example, they exhibit some activity with the aromatic amino acids (Miller and Litwack, 1971, Shrawder and Martinez-Carrion, 1972). Rat liver mitAspAT was also shown to readily catalyze transamination of cysteine (Shrawder and Martinez-Carrion, 1972, Ubuka et al., 1978). Thus, it occurred to us that this enzyme might be able to utilize cysteine S-conjugates as substrates, and this turned out to be the case with rat liver mitAspAT (Cooper et al., 2002a; Table 1). To the best of our knowledge, the ability of human mitAspAT to catalyze cysteine S-conjugate \u03b2-lyase reactions has not been investigated. However, given the similarity of members of the AspAT family, it seems a reasonable assumption that human mitAspAT will catalyze such a reaction.",

On the other hand, it has been reported that acivicin does not protect rats against the nephrotoxicity of hexachloro-1,3-butadiene (Davis, 1988). However, others have shown that S-(1,2,3,4,4-pentachloro-1,3-butadienyl)-l-cysteine (PCBC; the cysteine S-conjugate of hexachloro-1,3-butadiene) is cytotoxic to LLC-PK1 cells (Blackmore et al., 2002). AOA (a general inhibitor of PLP enzymes including aminotransferases) protects against DCVC-induced toxicity (e.g., Beuter et al., 1989, Blackmore et al., 2002, Chen et al., 1990, Chen et al., 1994, Lash et al., 1986a) and PCBC-induced toxicity (Blackmore et al., 2002) in LLC-PK1 cells. AOA partially protects against DCVC-induced toxicity in isolated rat kidney proximal tubules (Lash and Anders, 1986), but apparently not in isolated human renal proximal tubule cells (Cummings and Lash, 2000). \u03b1-Keto acids stimulate the toxicity of DCVC toward rat renal cells (Elfarra et al., 1987), suggesting involvement of aminotransferase(s) in the bioactivation process. AOA protects isolated rat proximal tubule cells against TFEC and the cysteine S-conjugates of chlorotrifluoroethylene, 1,1-dichloro-2,2-difluoroethylene, and 1,1-dibromo-2,2-difluoroethylene (Boogard et al., 1989). \u03b1-Methyl DCVC, which cannot be metabolized by a \u03b2-lyase reaction, is not toxic (Anders et al., 1988). Taken together, despite an occasional study to the contrary, the literature strongly supports important roles for GGT and cysteine S-conjugate \u03b2-lyases in promoting the nephrotoxicity of halogenated alkenes. However, it appears that human renal tissue is less susceptible than that of rat to damage from haloalkene cysteine S-conjugates, presumably as a result of lower specific activities of cysteine S-conjugate \u03b2-lyases in human renal tissue (Iyer and Anders, 1996, Lash et al., 1990a) and allometric scaling (Anders, 2004).",

Therefore, it follows that mitochondrial cysteine S-conjugate \u03b2-lyases may be particularly important in bioactivating toxic cysteine S-conjugates. Toxicity of DCVC to kidney cells has been associated with (1) covalent modification of macromolecules, (2) depletion of nonprotein thiols (presumably mostly GSH), (3) lipid peroxidation (Beuter et al., 1989, Chen et al., 1990, Groves et al., 1991), and (4) carbonylation of susceptible proteins (Fan et al., 2014). These effects may be attributable to formation of metabolites derived from a \u03b2-lyase reaction since, as mentioned earlier, AOA can protect against DCVC toxicity in renal tissues and in renal cells in culture. Mechanisms by which metabolites of DCVC and other nephrotoxic haloalkene cysteine S-conjugates alter thiol status may involve direct inhibition of glutathione reductase (Lock and Schnellmann, 1990) and generation of oxidative stress that leads indirectly to oxidation of thiol compounds (Chen et al., 1990). Oxidation of DCVC to DCVC sulfoxide followed by formation of a glutathione S-conjugate resulting from the reaction of DCVC sulfoxide with GSH may also lead to oxidative stress (Lash et al., 1994, Sausen and Elfarra, 1991). Other studies lead us to suggest an additional possibility, namely, that oxidative stress may result in part from Michael addition of thiols to aminoacrylate generated in the \u03b2-lyase reaction. In experiments in which LLC-PK1 cells were exposed to DCVC, the loss of nonprotein thiols was about 40\u201360% (Chen et al., 1990). Interestingly, the authors suggested that depletion of nonprotein thiols to this extent was insufficient to kill the cells. As cited earlier, BTC is relatively nontoxic, despite the fact that it is metabolized in vivo via cysteine S-conjugate \u03b2-lyases (Elfarra and Hwang, 1990). We are unaware of any studies on GSH status in renal cells/tissue resulting from exposure to BTC. Evidently, even if GSH is depleted in renal cells exposed to BTC, this insult may not be sufficient to induce overt toxicity. The implication of the work by Chen et al. (1990) is that in order for a cysteine S-conjugate to exhibit toxicity, it must generate reactive sulfur-containing fragments that covalently add to macromolecules. The toxicity may be enhanced, perhaps synergistically, by oxidative stress and by Michael adduction between aminoacrylate and susceptible nucleophiles such as GS\u2212 and protein sulfhydryls and/or by modification of coenzyme in susceptible PLP enzymes.",

How then can one explain the unusual susceptibility of the kidney to halogenated cysteine S-conjugates? Many factors are presumably involved (Boogard et al., 1989), including relative distribution of N-acetyltransferase and aminoacylases, cellular and mitochondrial uptake mechanisms, susceptibility to inactivation of cysteine S-conjugate \u03b2-lyases and nearby enzymes/macromolecules, relative K\nm values, competition from natural amino acid substrates, absolute level of the enzyme, the presence of the enzyme in mitochondria, and the presence of \u03b1-keto substrate to keep the enzyme enzymatically active (if the lyase in question is an aminotransferase). A major contributing factor is likely to be the very large surface area of the renal proximal tubules coupled to the extraordinary high renal vascular perfusion. In humans, the kidneys represent 0.4% of the body weight but receive 25% of the cardiac output (Pfaller and Gstraunthaler, 1998); the cortex receives 95% of the renal blood flow. Despite these factors, haloalkene cysteine S-conjugate-induced toxicity is not necessarily confined to renal tubules. As we have noted earlier, toxicity may also occur in the liver and occasionally in neural tissue, presumably as a consequence of the widespread tissue occurrence of cysteine S-conjugate \u03b2-lyases.",

However, most of the activity is in the cytosolic fraction (Cooper and Meister, 1981), and most of the \u03b2-lyase activity toward DCVC in rat kidney mitochondria could not be assigned to GTK (Abraham et al., 1995).

The importance of mitAspAT as a cysteine S-conjugate \u03b2-lyase in the bioactivation of TFEC is underscored by the work of Bruschi et al. (1993). These authors showed that six kidney mitochondrial proteins are thioacylated after rats are acutely administered a high dose of TFEC. No thioacylation of cytosolic kidney proteins was detected (negating an important role for cytosolic GTK in this process). The six proteins were identified as HSP60, mitHSP70, mitAspAT, aconitase, the E2k (dihydrolipoamide succinyl transferase) enzyme component of the KGDHC, the E3 (dihydrolipoamide dehydrogenase) enzyme component of KGDHC, and the E3 enzyme component of the branched-chain keto acid dehydrogenase complex (BCKADHC) (Bruschi et al., 1993, Bruschi et al., 1994, Bruschi et al., 1998, James et al., 2002). Lock and Schnellmann (1990) had previously reported that metabolites of haloalkene cysteine S-conjugates (DCVC, TFEC, and PCBC) inhibited dihydrolipoyl dehydrogenase (E3). Our findings that mitAspAT catalyzes a cysteine S-conjugate \u03b2-lyase reaction with TFEC in vitro and is syncatalytically inactivated in the process (Cooper et al., 2002a) are consistent with the in vivo finding that this enzyme in the kidney is thioacylated after administration of TFEC to rats (Cooper et al., 2011). We also showed that a high-M\nr cysteine S-conjugate \u03b2-lyase present in the kidney copurifies with HSP70 (Cooper et al., 2001). As cited earlier, the high-M\nr cysteine S-conjugate \u03b2-lyase in rat kidney mitochondria contains mitAspAT. This finding provides a mechanism for the prior finding of thioacylation of kidney mitHSP70 in rats administered TFEC. Conceivably, mitochondrial HSP60 may also associate with a PLP-containing enzyme that catalyzes a \u03b2-lyase reaction with TFEC.",

Moreover, the specific activity of KGDHC, but not that of PDHC, is diminished in the kidneys of TFEC-treated rats (Bruschi et al., 1998). We have found that KGDHC, but not PDHC, is directly inhibited in PC12 cells exposed to 1 mM TFEC (Park et al., 1999). These findings are remarkable because E3 is a common component of KGDHC, PDHC, and BCKADHC (and the glycine cleavage system). In the presence of TFEC and purified GTK (a source of thioacylating moieties), purified PDHC is more resistant to in vitro inactivation than is purified KGDHC (Park et al., 1999). Moreover, there is some evidence that E3 enzyme components are bound to the complex via E2 enzyme components in PDHC, whereas E3 enzyme components are bound to the complex via E1 enzyme components in KGDHC (McCartney et al., 1998). Thus, part of the resistance of PDHC to thioacylation/inactivation in kidney mitochondria of TFEC-treated rats may be due to differences in the arrangement of its constituent enzymes within the enzyme complex. In addition, PDHC is not known to be associated with any aminotransferases/\u03b2-lyases, whereas KGDHC is closely associated with mitAspAT. Thus, the susceptibility of KGDHC to thioacylation by a fragment derived from TFEC may be due to the proximity of mitAspAT or actual colocalization with subunit enzymes (James et al., 2002, Park et al., 1999).",

            "text": "Several TCA cycle enzymes and TCA-associated enzymes have been proposed to be arranged in supramolecular complexes (metabolons) that facilitate channeling of substrate from one enzyme to another. For example, mitAspAT has been proposed to be part of a metabolon affiliated or localized with KGDHC (see references cited in Cooper et al., 2002b). Based on our findings (Cooper et al., 2002a, Cooper et al., 2003) and those of Bruschi and coworkers (Bruschi et al., 1998, James et al., 2002), we have proposed that not only are metabolites channeled through supramolecular complexes in the TCA cycle but toxicants are also channeled (Cooper et al., 2002b; Fig. 6\n). This concept explains not only the susceptibility of KGDHC to TFEC-induced inactivation in rat kidney and cells in culture but also the susceptibility of aconitase and BCKADHC to thioacylation/inactivation. Aconitase has been proposed to be part of a metabolon that includes KGDHC and mitAspAT (James et al., 2002, Ov\u00e1di and Srere, 2000). Evidence also suggests that substrate channeling occurs between a metabolic unit (termed branched-chain amino acid metabolon) consisting of human BCATm and BCKADHC and that the channeling is influenced by the redox state in mitochondria (Islam et al., 2007, Islam et al., 2010). This finding would explain the susceptibility of kidney BCKADHC to TFEC-induced inactivation. Although most of the studies in support of substrate channeling of TCA intermediates have utilized indirect methods, more recent physicochemical methods have provided more direct evidence for TCA substrate channeling (e.g., Wu and Minteer, 2015). The studies of Wu and Minteer (2015) are consistent with the possibility of toxicant channeling.",

The S3 region of the proximal tubule has a high metabolic rate (Korrapati et al., 2007), and KGDHC is an important control step in the TCA cycle (Gibson et al., 2005). Thus, inactivation of KGDHC by chemically reactive compounds generated by the action of cysteine S-conjugate \u03b2-lyase(s) is expected to be especially serious in the S3 segments. Inhibition of KGDHC and aconitase may lead to metabolic stress, which in turn may lead to oxidative stress.",

While these compounds are unlikely to be formed from electrophilic xenobiotics in vivo to any large extent, they are instructive model compounds. S-(1,2-Dichlorovinyl)-l-homocysteine (DCVHC) is even more toxic than is DCVC, and the toxicity is potentiated by \u03b1-keto acids. Several amino acids that contain a good leaving group in the \u03b3-position undergo a nonenzymatic \u03b2,\u03b3-elimination reaction when converted to the corresponding \u03b1-keto acid by an aminotransferase or l-amino acid oxidase (Hollander et al., 1989 and references quoted therein). Activation of the \u03b2 C\u2014H bond in the \u03b1-keto acid (or \u03b1-imino acid) facilitates a \u03b2,\u03b3-elimination reaction with the production of vinylglyoxylate (2-oxo-3-butenoic acid) (Eq. 31).

DNA damage is the primary mechanism by which cisplatin kills tumor and other dividing cells. However, the renal proximal tubule cells are well-differentiated, nondividing cells that are not killed by other DNA-damaging agents (Hanigan and Devarajan, 2003). Evidence has been presented that damage to kidney cells is due to conversion of cisplatin to its glutathione S-conjugate and subsequently to its cysteine S-conjugate.

Busulfan is a bifunctional alkylating agent used for the treatment of hematologic and other malignancies prior to stem cell transplantation (e.g., Iwamoto et al., 2004). The mercapturate pathway of busulfan metabolism was shown to occur in rats by the detection of the sulfonium mercapturate and N-acetyl-\u03b2-(S-tetrahydrothiophenium)-l-alanine in the urine (Hassan and Ehrsson, 1987). Busulfan is converted to a glutathione S-conjugate (l-\u03b3-glutamyl-\u03b2-(S-tetrahydrothiophenium)-l-alanylglycine) by direct interaction with GSH (Ritter et al., 1999) and enzymatic catalysis by GSTs, especially GSTA1-1 (Czerwinski et al., 1996, Gibbs et al., 1996, Ritter et al., 1999, Ritter et al., 2002). Oxidation products of tetrahydrothiophene (THT) make up the majority of identified busulfan metabolites in rodents and rabbits (Roberts and Warwick, 1961). 1,4-Diiodobutane and 1,4-dibromobutane are also converted to l-\u03b3-glutamyl-\u03b2-(S-tetrahydrothiophenium)-l-alanylglycine and to the corresponding mercapturate in the rat (Marchand and Abdel-Monem, 1985, Marchand et al., 1988, Onkenhout et al., 1986).",

Presumably, therefore, THT can arise nonenzymatically from the glutathione S-conjugate in vivo. However, THT is also likely to arise via an enzymatic route (Cooper et al., 2008b). The detection of the mercapturate in rats shows that the cysteine S-conjugate must have been generated in vivo either by direct reaction of busulfan with cysteine or via the glutathione S-conjugate. The cysteine S-conjugate of busulfan (\u03b2-(S-tetrahydrothiophenium)-l-alanine, THT-A) is unusual in that the sulfur is in the oxidation state of a sulfonium rather than a thioether. Since sulfonium compounds are high-energy compounds, a \u03b2-elimination reaction yielding THT and aminoacrylate should be energetically favorable. Indeed, we have found that (1) homogenates of the rat liver, kidney, and brain; (2) \u03bcM PLP; and (3) highly purified rat liver cystathionine \u03b3-lyase can catalyze a \u03b2-elimination reaction with THT-A (Cooper et al., 2008b).

Formation of THT is probably a detoxification event. However, the formation of aminoacrylate may be a bioactivation event if it leads to selected enzyme inactivation or removal of endogenous thiols. The formation of a GSH analog in which the cysteine of GSH is replaced by a dehydroalanine residue (\u03b3-glutamyldehydroalanylglycine (EdAG); Fig. 8, structure X) may also be a bioactivation event. It is expected that Michael addition of sulfides across the double bond will occur. In this context, it has been shown that Michael addition of EdAG to GSH results in a GSSG analog in which the disulfide bond of GSSG is replaced by a stable, nonreducing ether bond ((2-amino-5-[[3-[2-[[4-amino-5-hydroxy-5-oxopentanoyl]amino]-3-(carboxymethylamino)-3-oxopropyl]sulfanyl-1-(carboxymethylamino)-1-oxopropan-2-yl]amino]-5-oxopentanoic acid); GSG) (Younis et al., 2008). Thus, formation of EdAG may be deleterious by lowering GSH levels and/or interfering with enzymes that normally utilize GSH/GSSG. It has recently been shown that a reactive cysteine residue in the actives site of glutaredoxin 1 (or glutaredoxin 2) (Grx 1/2) reacts with EdAG to form an irreversible thioether (Scian and Atkins, 2015). The enzyme is inactivated in the process. The authors suggested that the adduction of Grxs by EdAG suggests the possible alteration of proteins that are normally regulated via Grx-dependent reversible glutathionylation or deglutathionylation. Dysregulation of Grx-dependent processes could contribute to cellular toxicity of busulfan.",

In addition, some natural metabolites (e.g., leukotrienes, prostaglandin (PG)A2, 15-deoxy-\u039412,14-PGJ2, and hydroxynonenal) may be eliminated as their corresponding mercapturates. However, formation of a glutathione S-conjugate may sometimes lead to bioactivation (toxification). For example, glutathione S-conjugates of some hydroquinones and dihaloethanes may be directly toxic. In other cases, the cysteine S-conjugate derived from the glutathione S-conjugate may be toxic. For example, the cysteine S-conjugate of dopamine can form potentially highly toxic benzothiazines. In other cases, the sulfur of the thioether linkages of the S-conjugates of the mercapturate pathway may be oxidized to sulfoxides that are more toxic than the corresponding thioethers. For example, DCVC sulfoxide may be more toxic than DCVC. The potential exists for the cysteine S-conjugate sulfoxide to undergo an elimination reaction to generate a reactive sulfenic acid. However, there is no evidence that this occurs in the case of DCVC sulfoxide. In this case, the toxicity of the sulfide may be associated with depletion of GSH.",

            "text": "If the cysteine S-conjugate formed in the mercapturate pathway contains a good electron-withdrawing group (nucleofuge), it may undergo a \u03b2-elimination reaction. This reaction is catalyzed by several PLP-containing cysteine S-conjugate \u03b2-lyases that are normally involved in amino acid metabolism. If the eliminated sulfur-containing fragment is not especially reactive, the parent cysteine S-conjugate may not be particularly toxic (although some limited toxicity may be associated with the elimination product aminoacrylate). The sulfur-containing fragment may be thiomethylated or S-glucuronidated and excreted. Alternatively, the fragment may be further oxidized to a sulfoxide or sulfone before excretion. On the other hand, if the eliminated sulfur-containing fragment is chemically reactive (e.g., by covalently reacting with macromolecules), the parent cysteine S-conjugate may be toxic, especially to the kidneys. Electrophiles that are bioactivated by this mechanism include halogenated alkenes and drugs such as methazolamide and cisplatin. Some PCBS and aminophenols may also be metabolized in part by pathways involving cysteine S-conjugate \u03b2-lyases. However, the contribution of the \u03b2-lyase reaction to the toxicity of these compounds is not clear. Mitochondrial enzymes of energy metabolism (KGDHC, aconitase) are especially vulnerable to reactive fragments generated from toxic halogenated, cysteine S-conjugates, by a process that has been termed toxicant channeling. Throughout life, humans are exposed to a large number of exogenously and endogenously produced electrophiles. It is, therefore, possible that cysteine S-conjugate \u03b2-lyases contribute to mitochondrial dysfunction of aging and disease.",

The strong electron-withdrawing properties of the \u2014OS(O2)CH3 group on busulfan (I) result in electron deficiency at each carbon adjacent to the two methanesulfonyl groups. This deficiency facilitates the nucleophilic attack of the sulfhydryl of GSH at one of these carbons, resulting in elimination of methanesulfonate (II) and subsequent generation of adduct III. This step occurs nonenzymatically but is accelerated by GSTs. The electron deficiency in the remaining carbon adjacent to the \u2014OS(O2)CH3 group in adduct III facilitates nonenzymatic intramolecular nucleophilic attack at this carbon by a pair of electrons on the sulfur of the thioether, generating the glutathione S-conjugate (V) and eliminating a second equivalent of methanesulfonate. The conjugate (V) possesses a cyclic sulfonium group. GGT (a) and dipeptidases (b) possess broad specificities. Thus, V is expected to be readily converted to the corresponding cysteine S-conjugate THT-A (VI). VI may also be formed by nonenzymatic nucleophilic attack of a cysteine sulfur on busulfan (I), which generates adduct IV and methanesulfonate, followed by intramolecular cyclization and elimination of a second equivalent of methanesulfonate. VI contains a strong electron-withdrawing group and is therefore expected to undergo a facile \u03b2-elimination reaction to yield THT (VII), ammonium ion (VIII), and pyruvate (IX). This reaction occurs nonenzymatically at pH 7.4 but is accelerated by PLP and by rat liver cystathionine \u03b3-lyase (and by other as yet unrecognized enzymes in rat tissues). THT (VII) may also be generated directly and nonenzymatically from \u03b3-E-THT-AG (V) by an elimination reaction that results in the formation of \u03b3-glutamyldehydroalanylglycine (EdAG) (X). The conversion of busulfan (I) to the conjugate (V) is shown as occurring in two consecutive steps but may occur by a concerted mechanism. Note that the sulfur in THT is not derived from busulfan but rather from the sulfur of GSH.",
