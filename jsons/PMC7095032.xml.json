Dutch cost estimates are only available for total community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) hospitalized patients, but not further specified for influenza virus infections [8\u201312]. Moreover, incidence for influenza-like illness (ILI) is limited to patients visiting their general practitioner in primary care [13].

The respiratory season was defined as the period from week 40 through week 20 the following year. Influenza A(H3N2) was the dominating influenza virus in season 2014\u20132015, while influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 was dominant in season 2015\u20132016 [14, 15]. JBZ is a large regional hospital with 575 beds in the south-eastern part of The Netherlands. LUMC (585 beds) and UMCU (\u00b1 1100 beds) are large tertiary academic hospitals, situated in the western part (LUMC) and central part (UMCU) of The Netherlands. The inclusion criteria for patients were: (1) hospital admission for severe acute respiratory infection (SARI) according to the WHO SARI case definition [16], (2) being 18 years or older, and (3) having a positive influenza virus test using real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) [17]. Taking into account the Dutch Working Party on Antibiotic Policy (SWAB) guidelines [18] (JBZ and UMCU) and local hospital guidelines (LUMC), all influenza virus tests were requested at the discretion of the treating physician depending on the differential diagnosis. It has to be noted that the SWAB guidelines on influenza primarily focus on the preferred swabbing location, antiviral treatment, and antibiotic treatment of S. aureus in ICU patients during the influenza season. Patients hospitalized shorter than 24 h, readmissions within ten days, and patients with hospital-acquired pneumonia were excluded. In case of a readmission within ten days, the initial admission was included and only the re-admission excluded. In The Netherlands, an influenza epidemic is declared if the incidence of medically attended ILI in primary care is above the threshold of 5.1 per 10,000 persons per week for at least two consecutive weeks in combination with the detection of influenza virus in combined nasal and throat swabs from a selection of ILI patients [19].",

The catchment population was calculated by dividing the total number of hospitalizations due to respiratory tract infection (RTI) in each hospital by the total hospitalizations because of RTI in The Netherlands and multiplying this proportion by the total Dutch population size for each year available [22]. It is important to note that it concerns the catchment population for RTI only, and is, therefore, not applicable for incidence calculations related to other type of disease [6]. The data required for the calculation of the catchment population of each hospital were provided by the National Register of hospital discharge diagnosis (Dutch Hospital Data) (supplemental file Table S2). A selection of International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems (ICD-10) codes related to RTI (J00-J22, A15, A16, A48.1, A70 and A78) was determined for each hospital for the years 2014, 2015 and 2016 (supplemental file Figure S1 footnote) [22, 23]. Taking into account the non-normal distribution of the catchment population over the available respiratory seasons, we used the median value for our incidence calculations.",

Unit prices for laboratory tests were retrieved form the Dutch Healthcare Authority [24], medication prices from the National Health Care Institute [25], and medical consultations and hospital admissions were estimated using Dutch reference prices [26], using the weighted mean unit cost for hospital admission. The weighted mean unit cost takes into account the distribution of general ward and academic hospital beds in The Netherlands. Diagnostics for patients with an RTI on an emergency ward were assumed to include a chest X-ray and laboratory diagnostic tests, including full blood examination, respiratory viral PCR panel, and urine analysis (see supplemental file, Table S3). The urine analysis included a urine screening test and a pneumococcal urinary antigen test. For ICU patients, diagnostics, isolation and medication costs were already included in the total ICU admission costs. Costs for antibiotic treatment on the general ward were calculated for average antibiotic therapy course of one week in line with the most recent SWAB guidelines [18]. Different antibiotic SWAB treatment regimens on the general ward for mild and moderate severe CAP (\u03b2-lactam antibiotic) versus severe CAP (2nd/3rd generation cephalosporin) were chosen for costs estimations of antibiotic treatment [27]. Medication costs for oseltamivir on the general ward were calculated for the duration of 5 days according to SWAB guidelines. A bottom-up calculation was done for the additional costs for isolation in the first week of admission in the general ward, including residing in single rooms, additional associated workload for medical personnel, and usage of FFP1 masks [28, 29].",

            "text": "Differences in case definition and study population are illustrated by Dutch studies, which focused mainly on community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) [9, 10, 45] and invasive pneumococcal disease [10] in, respectively, an adult [9, 45] and elderly population [10]. Vissink et al. [10] reported that mean hospitalization costs of an elderly CAP patient amounted to \u20ac8081. In comparison, we found arithmetic mean influenza-related hospitalization costs of \u20ac6183 (95% CI \u20ac4937\u2013\u20ac7625) in the same age group. The higher hospitalization costs found by Vissink et al. could be explained by their inclusion of more detailed cost data on diagnostics and treatment during admission and having an older elderly study population (56% versus 31% in our study). An additional explanation is that CAP has a great variation of causative pathogens that may result in a longer hospital stay (12.0 days versus 8.5 days in our study) and higher in-hospital mortality (11.1% versus 5.5% in our study) with consequently higher hospitalization costs. This was also illustrated by the study of Spoorenberg et al., showing that CAP caused by S. pneumoniae and S. aureus is associated with higher hospitalization costs mainly due to longer duration of hospital stay [9]. They estimated a mean hospitalization costs per CAP patient of \u20ac4098, which is lower than our hospitalization costs per influenza patient. The difference in mean hospitalization costs could be explained by the exclusion of all immunocompromised patients and a lower percentage of ICU admissions (7.5% versus 18.4% in our study) in the study by Spoorenberg et al.",

Although we do not have a definite explanation for this result, several hypotheses could be made. Firstly, it is possible that pressure on hospital beds during influenza epidemics is higher in academic hospitals, resulting in different policies with respect to supported early discharge between the general and academic hospitals. Secondly, the amount of patient transfers to other hospitals could be higher in academic hospitals than in general hospitals. Thirdly, academic hospitals have a lower threshold for admitting immunocompromised patients, who are, therefore, less ill and require a shorter LOS, leading to lower hospitalization costs. On the other hand, general hospitals more often admit patients without significant comorbidities, but are more severely ill and require a longer LOS, with higher associated hospitalization costs.",

Nevertheless, the highest hospitalization costs per patient in the age group 45\u201364 years can be partly explained by the highest percentage of ICU admissions and the longest stay per admitted ICU patient. In agreement with this result, Rozenbaum et al. found the highest mean hospitalization costs per ICU patient with CAP (\u20ac16.374) in age group 50\u201364 years [8].",

The higher proportion of ARDS patients found in the low-risk group, compared to the medium- and high-risk group, is most likely responsible for this result. In addition, the main outlier in hospitalization costs belonged to an influenza patient in the low-risk group and in the age group 45\u201364 years. This influenza patient without comorbidities was admitted to the ICU with sepsis and acute renal failure, requiring dialysis. In contrast to our results, other studies [41, 42, 46] stated that underlying medical conditions contributed to an increase in total hospitalization costs for adults and elderly. Only one US study in children found lower costs in high-risk patients, but this difference was not significant [47, 48].",

            "text": "A strength of this study is that we could dispose of accurate catchment populations of each hospital. Therefore, for the first time, we could report incidence of hospitalized influenza patients in The Netherlands. Another strength is that we took differences in unit prices for admission to the general ward, in both general as academic hospital settings, into account, using weighted mean for calculation of hospitalization costs. There are also several limitations that have to be taken into account in this study. Our seasonal cumulative incidence for influenza hospitalizations is based on three Dutch hospitals, which might not be representative for the incidence and associated mean hospitalization costs in the entire Dutch population. It is also important to note that the overall arithmetic mean hospitalization costs per influenza patient are likely to be an underestimation of the true costs, caused by unavailable cost indicators. Firstly, we did not take into account patient transfers to other hospitals because of capacity problems during the influenza epidemic or readmissions of the influenza patient. This could have underestimated our mean hospitalization costs to some extent. Secondly, excluding influenza patients admitted less than 24 h, underestimated our incidence estimates and our national hospitalization costs as well; whereas, the mean hospitalization cost per admitted influenza patient was overestimated. Thirdly, \u2018other costs\u2019 were underestimated in our analysis, because insufficient data were collected on treatment and diagnostics during admission. To compensate for this, assumptions had to be made for the duration of isolation, empiric antibiotic therapy and duration, and oseltamivir treatment. Data on additional treatment and use of diagnostics because of complications during hospital admission were not available in our dataset and, therefore, disregarded in our cost estimate. For one severe outlier, we retrieved additional information on complications during hospital stay resulting in better insight in the mean hospitalization costs. Fourthly, no data were available on hospitalized patients with an RTI with negative influenza virus test results. Even with RT-PCR, false-negative test results may occur due to improper or poor sample collection, handling and/or processing [50]. False-negative influenza test results could have underestimated the total hospitalization costs per influenza patient. Finally, this study was purely limited to hospitalization costs. Information on healthcare use before and after hospital admission, on patient costs and related productivity losses were absent and, therefore, not considered in the current study. Extrapolation of mean hospitalization costs of influenza patients to national level is a rough estimation and has to be interpreted with caution, because the representativeness of the study hospitals is unknown and outliers could have resulted in overestimation of the total hospitalization costs.",
