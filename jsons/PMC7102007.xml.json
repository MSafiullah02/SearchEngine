Cases of severe malaria are caused almost exclusively by the falciparum species, making it responsible for the greatest degree of morbidity and mortality.1,6 People living in high-endemic areas can acquire a degree of immunity due to repeated exposure to Plasmodium falciparum. These individuals rarely become critically ill when infected and can tolerate the parasite without symptoms developing.7 The exact mechanism of this immunity is unknown; however, it is rapidly lost if the individual moves away from the endemic area.8 The malaria-immune naive traveller or individuals who have previously lived in the area (and consider themselves immune) are particularly at risk of developing severe malaria.",

Within a few hours, the sporozoites move to the liver, enter hepatocytes, and begin to divide. The sporozoites eventually form mature tissue schizonts which contain daughter merozoites (known as exo-erythrocytic schizogony). After a period of incubation in the liver (5-15 days in falciparum malaria), schizonts rupture and release thousands of merozoites into the circulation which then enter erythrocytes. Asexual reproduction within erythrocytes (known as erythrocytic schizogony) eventually results in hemolysis of the red blood cells, releasing thousands more daughter merozoites into the bloodstream. This rupturing of erythrocytes and release of merozoites gives rise to clinical symptoms and promotes further erythrocyte infection, with each cycle of erythrocyte infection taking approximately 48 hr. Some merozoites differentiate into male and female gametocytes through a sexual erythrocytic stage, at which point, they become infectious to female Anopheles mosquitos that bite the infected human. Sexual reproduction of these gametocytes in the mosquito (sporogenic cycle) eventually leads to production of new sporozoites that move to the mosquito salivary glands ready to be injected into a new human host with the next bite. Malaria can also be transmitted in utero through blood transfusion, intravenous drug use, needlestick injury, and organ transplantation.9-11\n",

            "text": "Many of the effects of severe falciparum malaria on the various organ systems are a consequence of changes in the structure and function of parasitized erythrocytes. The very presence of the parasite in the erythrocyte reduces its cell membrane deformability and contributes to hemolysis by increasing the osmotic fragility of the red blood cell. The expression of certain membrane glycoproteins leads to adherence (i.e., increased \u201cstickiness\u201d) of erythrocytes to the vascular endothelium (i.e., cytoadherence). This process, known as sequestration, results in the microvascular obstruction of capillaries and small venules of vital organs and occurs in the pulmonary, cerebral, cardiac, renal, and hepatic circulations. The infected erythrocytes can also stick to uninfected circulating red blood cells in a process known as rosetting, which further contributes to microvascular obstruction.12 The pathogenic effects of malaria have also been attributed to parasitized erythrocytes promoting the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines.13 These cytokines, e.g., tumour necrosis factor and interleukin-1, have multiple effects, including systemic inflammatory response (SIRS), fever, hyperdynamic circulation, and direct myocardial suppression. Inducible nitric oxide (NO) synthase is also activated by the cytokines, leading to an increase in NO production as part of the SIRS response. Despite the increase in NO production, the sequestration and rosetting of red blood cells still results in microvascular occlusion. The cytokine hypothesis also suggests that release of these cytokines ultimately leads to death from severe malaria through direct mitochondrial dysfunction and impaired oxygen utilization. Thus, this process gives rise to functional cellular hypoxia rather than simply the effects of the vaso-occlusive phenomenon.13-15\n",

Falciparum malaria requires prompt treatment as deterioration can occur within hours. The Public Health Agency of Canada has supported the establishment of the Canadian Malaria Network to facilitate treatment of patients with severe malaria. This network allows intravenous artesunate and quinine to be obtained readily from sentinel hospital pharmacy sites across Canada by clinicians who need timely access to the drugs for the management of severe malaria.28 Indeed, the optimal management of malaria in a fully resourced country like Canada with such networks may differ widely from what is deliverable practically in poorer low-resource settings. Individuals living in poorer countries, particularly in rural areas, have higher death rates from falciparum malaria as a result of reduced access to diagnostic and treatment facilities and the availability of artesunate and ACTs. There is also reduced access to critical care facilities and availability of pathogen-free blood products in poorer countries.23\n",

Recommended preoperative investigations and assessments are outlined in Table 5, and the main goals for intraoperative care are summarized in Table 6. The clinical course of malaria caused by Plasmodium vivax, malariae, and ovale tends to cause fewer complications, and these species are less likely to cause problems with perioperative management when compared with falciparum malaria.

Respiratory failure can progress to acute lung injury (ALI) or adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and the need for mechanical ventilation. The exact pathophysiology of developing ALI/ARDS in malaria is not fully understood. It is thought to involve a combination of factors, including parasite sequestration in pulmonary capillaries and host immune responses, both of which can initiate direct lung damage and lead to thickening of alveolar septa, intra-alveolar hemorrhage, and pulmonary edema. A post-treatment inflammatory response can also persist and lead to an ALI/ARDS picture even when the parasite count is declining.38\n",

As ALI/ARDS treatment trials are lacking in patients with malaria, recommendations for ventilation follow non-malaria ARDS treatment guidelines.38 A lung protective ventilation strategy is advised with the application of positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP), limiting tidal volumes to 6 mL\u00b7kg\u22121 and plateau pressures to < 30 cm H2O.39 In patients with concomitant cerebral malaria, achieving normocapnia is essential to prevent further rises in intracranial pressure (ICP) that could precipitate cerebral herniation. Lung protective strategies may have to be sacrificed to achieve normocapnia in the presence of raised ICP. The use of extracorporeal carbon dioxide removal devices may be beneficial in this scenario.40 Positioning the patient in a head-up position may help with both ventilation and reducing ICP.",

            "text": "Cardiac function is usually well preserved in malarial infection; however, it can become impaired in severe falciparum malaria infection. Post-mortem examination has shown evidence of microvascular obstruction in coronary capillaries caused by parasitized erythrocytes, leading to ischemic cardiomyopathy in some patients.41 Severe malaria infection may also be associated with direct myocardial dysfunction.42 Levels of N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP), a sensitive marker of left ventricular dysfunction, have been shown to be elevated in patients presenting with severe malaria.43 Parasite toxins, host immune mediators, metabolic acidosis, and decreased NO levels have all been implicated as causative for direct myocardial dysfunction. Conduction defects and non-specific electrocardiogram abnormalities can occur, particularly in patients on quinine therapy.44 Preoperative cardiac evaluations should include an electrocardiogram, transthoracic echocardiography, and laboratory biomarkers of cardiac dysfunction. When available, intraoperative transesophageal echocardiography and cardiac output monitoring should be considered to help guide appropriate inotropic and fluid therapy for the hypotensive patient and to distinguish between cardiogenic and distributive shock. There remains a degree of uncertainty about the optimal fluid management strategy in patients with severe malaria. Patients with malaria are particularly vulnerable to developing pulmonary edema from fluid overload, and there is a fine balance between keeping the patients under-filled, which may worsen perfusion and acidosis, and over-filled, which may precipitate pulmonary edema. In the absence of volume depletion or hypotension, patients with severe malaria should receive fluids conservatively.19 It is generally advisable to keep the intravascular volume at the lowest level while still allowing adequate systemic perfusion; early inotropic support is preferable to excessive intravascular filling.18 Nevertheless, the point at which inotropic agents should be commenced in patients with severe malaria is yet unknown. Since malaria can be associated with profound acidosis, if inotropic support is instituted, it may be preferable to avoid or limit the dose of epinephrine as this agent can increase lactate production and exacerbate acidosis.45 Dopamine, dobutamine, or norepinephrine have been used in the treatment of severe malaria and are suitable alternatives. Fluid balance may be particularly difficult to manage during surgery if there is acute blood loss. Central venous pressure, pulmonary artery catheters, and/or echocardiography should be considered to help guide treatment in this context; however, neither central venous nor pulmonary artery occlusion pressure has been shown to correlate well with markers of end-organ perfusion in severe malaria.46\n",

These factors combined lead to acute tubular necrosis and usually oliguric renal failure. Renal failure in turn contributes to the acidosis that is seen commonly in severe malaria.54 Preoperative evaluation of renal function should include urea, creatinine and electrolytes, arterial blood gas, and an assessment of urine output. The most common electrolyte disturbances are hyponatremia and hyperkalemia.53 Hyperkalemia can be profound, particularly if there has been severe hemolysis. Calcium and magnesium can also be reduced in severe malaria, leading to a prolonged QT interval on electrocardiogram.55 Fluid balance must be monitored carefully and preoperative dialysis should be considered if there is evidence of fluid overload. Fluid overload in the presence of renal failure and severe anemia can precipitate cardiogenic pulmonary edema, and early institution of renal replacement therapy may limit pulmonary complications.56 Loop diuretics help reduce the risk of volume overload in the setting of renal failure and should be available in the operating room. Renal failure can affect the handling of many anesthetic drugs. Drugs which are cleared independently of the kidneys are preferred if renal function is compromised.",

During the erythrocytic stages of the malaria infection, the spleen is the main organ involved in the immune response and in the removal of parasitized erythrocytes. The spleen plays an important role in the destruction of the malaria parasites and expression of parasite antigens on the surface of infected erythrocytes. Malaria infection, however, can result in remodelling of the splenic architecture that eventually results in impairment of the immune response.29 The spleen contributes to the anemia of malaria by increased destruction and retention of the less deformable parasitized red blood cells. The severe complications of non-falciparum malaria usually involve the spleen.60 Splenomegaly can arise in patients with chronic malarial infection and can be massive. Indeed, this hyperreactive malarial splenomegaly is the main cause of massive splenomegaly in Africa. In addition to a profound anemia, the massive splenomegaly can complicate intraoperative management by causing cardiovascular instability through aortocaval compression by the spleen when the patient is supine. Wedging or tilting the patient can help limit hypotension related to aortocaval compression. Splenic complications, including hematoma, rupture, and infarction can complicate malarial infection, may be fatal, and are more common with vivax malaria.61 These complications should be suspected in patients complaining of abdominal pain in the left upper quadrant or lower left-sided pleuritic pain. Malaria is the most common cause of spontaneous splenic rupture in the tropics. Splenic rupture occurs most commonly during an acute infection, and lack of pre-existing immunity is a major risk factor.62 Although splenomegaly was traditionally treated surgically by splenectomy, conservative splenic conserving strategies are now advocated, particularly in patients with a high likelihood of future exposure to malaria infection.63 In patients with a history of malaria infection, it is important to find out if they have undergone a splenectomy as specific antibiotic prophylaxis may be required with future surgery.",

In low transmission areas, blood transfusion is advisable if the hematocrit falls below 20% or the hemoglobin is < 7 g\u00b7dL\u22121.23 Transfusion warrants careful attention to fluid balance as patients with severe malaria are prone to fluid overload and pulmonary edema.

In the absence of significant thrombocytopenia, coagulopathy, secondary bacterial sepsis, or cerebral malaria with raised ICP, neuraxial anesthesia may be a viable alternative to general anesthesia in women requiring Cesarean delivery or non-obstetric surgery during pregnancy. There are theoretical concerns of parasite transfer into the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and precipitation of cerebral malaria through spinal anesthesia, though this has not been reported.78 Importantly, Plasmodium species are obligate intracellular parasites which are unable to replicate in CSF in the absence of available erythrocytes to invade. Cerebral malaria is a consequence of sequestration of malaria parasites within cerebral capillaries; the parasites are confined to the intravascular space with no direct contact with parasites within neuronal tissue.79 Spinal anesthesia has previously been used without complication in a parturient with babesiosis, a disease also characterized by intraerythrocytic parasites similar to malaria.80 It is also likely that many neuraxial blocks have been performed in pregnant patients with malaria worldwide with no published reports of harm. Nevertheless, there are few published data on this topic and further work is required specifically to investigate the safety of neuraxial anesthesia in this setting.",

Increased global travel has resulted in an increase in the number of imported cases seen in developed countries. The majority of imported cases are caused by the falciparum species which is associated with the greatest degree of morbidity and mortality.1,6 Multiple organ systems can be impacted as a consequence of changes in structure and function of parasitized erythrocytes. Safe perioperative management requires knowledge of all these potential system effects. Preoperative investigation and assessment should assess the type of malaria, the severity of disease, and the degree of end-organ impairment. Treatment of malaria should be initiated prior to surgery. Neuraxial, regional, and general anesthesia are appropriate anesthetic techniques. Intraoperatively, close attention must be paid to fluid management, cerebral blood flow dynamics, and avoidance of hypoglycemia. Postoperatively, blood films should be repeated every eight to 12 hours until they are negative. Postoperative care of patients with severe malaria should take place in the critical care unit as there may be ongoing requirements for renal replacement therapy, ventilation, or inotropic support.",
