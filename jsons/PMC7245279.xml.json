The four United Kingdom (UK) Chief Medical Officers raised the country\u2019s risk level from low to moderate on 30 January 2020 upon the WHO's announcement of the disease as a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC).3 The UK\u2019s emergency response to the COVID-19 pandemic thereafter stems from protocols that were developed both during and after the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) epidemic of 2003. However major differences exist between SARS and COVID-19 in that the former was considerably more dangerous with a cumulative fatality rate (CFR) of 11% compared to an estimated CFR for COVID-19 of <1%.[4], [5]\n",

Jacks designed a study to compare the concentration of airborne particulates using different methods of evacuation generated airborne particulates from a 25,000 cps magnetostrictive ultrasonic scaling instrument in a laboratory setting.7 A standard saliva ejector positioned intraorally was compared with two extra-orally positioned, hands-free high-volume evacuation (HFHVE) techniques (standard attachment and funnel-shaped attachment). Measurement of airborne particles was performed with a DataRAM Real-Time Aerosol Monitor. A significant reduction in the number of airborne particulates was demonstrated with both forms of extra-oral HFHVE attachment in place. Standard attachments and funnel-shaped attachments resulted in reduction of particulates by 90.8% and 89.7%, respectively, when compared to the intraorally positioned standard saliva ejector. A second in-vitro study used an ultrasonic scaler to generate an erythrosin dye solution aerosol at 17.5 ml/min with a high-volume evacuator being used to assess the reduction in contamination within a plastic enclosure containing a 1 cm grid laid out on 4 slides.8 The number of squares containing a red erythrosine spot were counted and considered to represent aerosol contamination. The high-volume evacuator attachment produced a 93% reduction in the number of contaminated squares (chi squared significant at P < 0.05). In the only in-vivo study 30 subjects had half their mouths cleaned using an ultrasonic scaler as a control and the other half using high-volume suction.9 Four culture plates were placed on the operator and patient with high-volume suction resulting in an 81% reduction in mean bacterial culture forming units (CFUs).",

PVP-I was tested against Klebsiella pneumoniae and Streptococcus pneumoniae according to a bacterial quantitative suspension test and against severe acute respiratory syndrome and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronaviruses (SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV), rotavirus strain Wa and influenza virus A subtype H1N1 according to virucidal quantitative suspension test EN14476.13 The PVP-I 7% gargle/mouthwash was diluted 1:30 with water to a concentration of 0.23% (the recommended concentration for \"real-life\" use) and tested at room temperature under clean conditions [0.3 g/l bovine serum albumin (BSA), viruses only] and dirty conditions (3.0 g/l BSA +3.0 ml/l erythrocytes) as an interfering substance for defined contact times (minimum 15 s). Rotavirus was tested without protein load. A \u2265 5 log10 (99.999%) decrease of bacteria and \u2265 4 log10 (99.99%) reduction in viral titre was used to represented effective bactericidal and virucidal activity respectively. The diluted PVP-I gargle/mouthwash showed effective bactericidal activity against Klebsiella pneumoniae and Streptococcus pneumoniae and rapidly inactivated SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, influenza virus A (H1N1) and rotavirus after 15 s of exposure. Kariwa likewise reported that the treatment of SARS-CoV with PVP-I products for two minutes reduced virus infectivity from 1.17 \u00d7 10(6) TCID(50)/ml to below the detectable levels.14 The use of similar regimens has been suggested might be of benefit in reducing healthcare worker exposure during the COVID-19 pandemic.15\n",

Whilst intra-oral suction devices such as those employed in dental surgeries are not universally present within the hospital environment, most out-patients and all operating theatres have access to some sort of high-volume suction equipment. Suction units in dental surgeries operate with a compression unit of 50 litres/min at 5 bar and require a minimum of 250 litres of air per minute. Operating theatre suction typically produces flow rates of 50 litres / min at 675 mmHg (0.89 bar) with the wall-mounted units housed in many out-patient consultation suites producing a flow rate of 30 litres/ minute at 650 mmHg (0.86 bar). Whilst the evidence base for effective aerosol reduction revolves around the dental literature transposition into the hospital setting seems justified even though there is a disparity regarding the flow efficiency of the units involved. Unlike the out-patient environment operating theatres most commonly utilise a conventional plenum-type ventilation system that operates under positive pressure. This allows 25 air changes of an non-recycled air flow supply with outflow to the atmosphere via overhead exhaust vents located in the adjoining scrub and anesthetic induction rooms. Nevertheless it would appear that routine the use of high-volume suction equipment would be an effective policy to evacuate generated airborne particulates and so reduce the number that reach the breathing space of clinicians. Such measures could easily be adopted in the clinic and operative settings for a variety of procedures (e.g. out-patient nasedoscopy, panendoscopy under general anaesthesia).",

Doing so may well lessen the overall impact on the healthcare system by reducing cross-infection from patients to healthcare workers and vice versa. Whilst direct testing and demonstration of the virucidal activity of PVP against SARS-CoV-2 has not been documented the evidence in the literature shows that PVP-I is rapidly virucidal in vitro and reduces the coronavirus load in the oral cavity to help prevent MERS-CoV transmission.13 Topical PVP-I usage is well tolerated, inexpensive and, for a patient about to undergo a procedure, a one-off episode. However, healthcare workers may choose to adopt PVP-I use over a more regular and sustained period. Daily use of 5% PVP-I mouthwash over a six-month period does not appear to influence thyroid hormone levels (serum T3/T4 and free T4) and although a small increase in TSH levels may result the latter remains within the normal range.20 In a study looking at the excretion of iodine in healthy subjects, average ingestion of 88 mg per day for a period of 38 days was undertaken without deleterious effects with the majority of iodine being cleared by the kidneys. The WHO recommended daily allowance of iodine for an adult is 0\u00b715 mg. PVP-I 10% contains an equivalent of 11 mg/mL of iodine suggesting that with daily use 4 mg of iodine would be delivered per day to staff depending on the method of application. Since aerosolised secretions from the lower respiratory tract almost certainly also have a part to play in disease transmission such an approach clearly only forms one part of a strategy to reduce transmission as an adjunct to other elements of personal protective equipment. The suggestion that tempering Chlorhexidine rinses (47 \u00b0C vs 18 \u00b0C) may reduce bacterial aerosol contamination further is untried with viral load.12\n",

High-volume suction reduces bioaerosols by between 81% to 90%. Manufacturers suggest that fluid resistant surgical facemasks filter 62% of airborne particles compared with 94% for FFP2 masks and 99% for FFP3 masks. Given the lower suction efficiency of hospital-based suction equipment compared to that available in dental practices it is possible to estimate an overall reduction in AGPs with routine hospital suction use of 92.8% for the surgical mask, 98.9% for FFP2 masks and 99.8% for FFP3 masks respectively with a risk difference of 7.03 between the surgical mask and FFP3 and a relative risk of 0.929.",
