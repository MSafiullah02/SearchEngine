            "text": "Helminth infections affect millions of people and livestock, resulting in a major social and economic burden worldwide [7,8]. Despite their impact, research into helminth infections relies heavily on the use of animals and is limited by a lack of models that more closely reproduce the interaction of the parasites with their specific hosts [9]. In vivo model organisms for human and livestock helminth infection have provided invaluable data on the immune response to helminths, parasite genetics, and transmission. Nevertheless, these models are expensive and complex, hindering the study of host\u2013parasite interactions at the molecular level. Moreover, model organisms cannot fully recapitulate human helminth infections. Entirely new systems are therefore needed that allow the processes of invasion and colonization of human helminths to be studied, and that open up new possibilities for testing new drug targets and identifying vaccine candidates. Organoids from different organs infected by helminths during their life cycle (including gut, lung, bladder, and liver) have enormous potential as novel models for studying the interactions of helminths and their products with their hosts. Nevertheless, the size and complexity of helminths pose challenges on the adaptability of organoid cultures for their use in research. Here, we discuss the applicability of this technology. From our recent investigations into the interactions of whipworm larvae with caecal epithelium and evaluations of the host response to excretory/secretory (ES) products (see Glossary), we explore the advantages and pitfalls of using organoid systems.",

Moreover, organoids can be grown in a 2D and 3D conformation, and, in contrast to traditional cell lines, they retain organ specificity and maintain genome stability, allowing their biobanking [2,6]. These features make them amenable to high-throughput screening, although it is important to consider that experiments using organoids are currently subject to variability due to inherent heterogeneity in size, shape, structural organization and functional capacity, and batch variability of both the ECM and growth factors used in culture [3,16,53].",

Most helminths are host-restricted and, in such cases, animal models are of limited use in the understanding of helminth pathogenesis. Organoids derived from the specific host could overcome this issue by providing a model with increased relevance for the specific infection; for instance, using human organoids and the human infective nematode Trichuris trichiura, which is currently experimentally intractable, could replace some studies in mice using T. muris.",

The 2D models require numerous 3D organoids to be dissociated into single cells. The resulting single cells are then grown as a monolayer that requires further culturing before being differentiated [3, 4, 5, 6,54,55]. In our experience, when the cells of intestinal organoids are cultured over plasticware they differentiate into the major cell types of the organ, but do not present any organization. In contrast, cultures grown on permeable supports/transwells have a more physiologically relevant appearance to those grown on conventional plasticware [3], and promote the differentiation of cells and their organization in a specific conformation that, to an extent, resembles intestinal crypts. Moreover, culturing on permeable supports/transwells allows the independent control of apical and basolateral surfaces, as cells grown on these conditions polarize [6,54,55]. This permits the creation of nutrient/growth factor gradients and an air\u2013liquid interface that promotes cell differentiation, and the co-culture with other cell types. Nevertheless, organoids grown in a 2D fashion lack any semblance of the organ architecture and self-organization that characterize 3D organoids and in vivo conditions (Figure 1).",

Sizes range from a few hundred micrometers in the eggs and infective stages (L1/L3 larvae, cercariae) up to meters in the adults of some cestodes. Thus, a combination of parasite size and organoid dimensional conformation determines the extent to which the co-culture/infection can be controlled, both in terms of the number of parasites and concentration of ES products, as well as the conditions required for potential hatching of eggs, or activation of larvae/adults and their invasion (such as oxygen levels, presence of host molecular structures, cellular polarization/architecture, and microbiota). For pathogens other than helminths, there are no reports on the impact of the dimensional conformation and architecture of organoids on the interactions with the host cells. Indeed, the life cycle of the protozoan parasite C. parvum can be replicated both in 3D and 2D organoids [33,34].",

Basal-out 3D organoids have restricted luminal access, thus requiring delivery of parasites or their products directly into the lumen of organoids by microinjection. Microinjection is technically challenging, slow, and labor-intensive [3]. This technique poses problems with delivery depending on organoid size, as the number of cells per organoid and luminal volumes vary, making it difficult to perform precise quantitative experiments [3,5,6]. The volume injected also depends on the accumulation of mucus and cell debris within the enclosed organoid lumen, which restricts access to the apical surface of the epithelia [56]. In addition, microinjection can result in spillage of the cargo into the basolateral space that can lead to confounding results [56].",

Upon microinjection of the parasites, it is important to consider the luminal conditions in the organoid, as low levels of oxygen (varying from approximately 3\u201310% [60]) and accumulation of dead cells can impact parasite ability to survive and invade (Figure 1).",

An additional advantage of this system is the better oxygenation of the culture, compared with 3D organoids where the low concentrations of oxygen in the lumen may be detrimental to parasite viability. Moreover, permeable supports/transwells permit access to the basolateral compartment, so that growth factor or nutrient gradients can be established, and other cells can be co-cultured, such as immune cells, to better reproduce the native microenvironment. Unfortunately, a current major limitation of this system is that live imaging of the transwells is currently not possible without disassembling the permeable support [56].",

Co-culture with immune cells includes: (i) intraepithelial lymphocytes that proliferate and incorporate in the organoid epithelium [71]; (ii) macrophages that enhance barrier function and maturity of enteroid monolayers and respond to infections with E. coli [72]; (iii) lamina propria lymphocytes that mediate commensal protection of the epithelium [73]; and (iv) dendritic cells that alter stem cell fate by inhibiting secretory lineage and drive absorptive lineage [74]. The anaerobic nature of the majority of the members of the intestinal microbiota complicates its co-culture in 2D organoid systems that grow under normal oxygen concentrations [5,75]. However, introduction of some oxygen-tolerant microbiota members (and their components and by-products), in organoid cultures and other intestinal models, has allowed their influence on the intestinal SCN to be studied [62,73,75].",

Comparison of In Vivo Models and Organoid Systems on the Degree of Modelling of the Components of the In Vivo Host\u2013Helminth Interaction In vivo models allow a holistic recreation of the conditions required for parasite infection, including tissue architecture, oxygenation, multicellularity, cell differentiation and growth factor and nutrient gradients, colonization by local microbiota, and interactions with other cells that create a unique microenvironment hosting the parasite. Organoids can be grown in 2D and 3D conformations mimicking to some extent the components of the in vivo host\u2013parasite interaction. '\u2713': fully recreated; '\u2717': not modelled; '?': condition modelling not known or investigated; '\u2713?': conditions that have been recreated to certain extent; '\u2717?': those that have not been successfully modelled by the authors, but are still to be tested in work with other helminths.",
