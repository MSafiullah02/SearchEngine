            "text": "The emergence and re-emergence of Zika virus (ZIKV), is a cause for international concern. These highly pathogenic arboviruses represent a serious health burden in tropical and subtropical areas worldwide. Despite these burdens, antiviral therapies do not exist, and inhibitors of ZIKV are therefore urgently needed. To elucidate the anti-ZIKV effect of lycorine, we used reverse transcription-quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR), immunofluorescence, Westernwestern blot, and plaque forming assay to analyse viral RNA (vRNA), viral protein, progeny virus counts, and validated inhibitors in vitro using a variety of cell lines. Additionally, we found that lycorine acts post-infection according to time-of-addition assay, and inhibits RdRp activity. Lycorine protected AG6 mice against ZIKV-induced lethality by decreasing the viral load in the blood. Due to its potency and ability to target ZIKV infection in vivo and in vitro, lycorine might offer promising therapeutic possibilities for combatting ZIKV infections in the future.",

The ZIKV genome encodes three structural proteins (C, prM/M, and E) and seven nonstructural (NS) proteins (NS1, NS2A, NS2B, NS3, NS4A, NS4B, and NS5) (Hamel et al., 2015) . ZIKV infection has been associated with several central nervous system diseases, such as Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome, and meningoencephalitis, which are especially harmful to the immature nervous system, and could cause congenital microcephaly in the offspring of pregnant woman (Perez-Cabezas et al., 2019) . Scientists have been working on anti-ZIKV research, and most research on drugs is mainly focused on antibody drugs, small-molecule compounds and peptide drugs. Many vaccine candidates have been identified in clinical research, such as DNA vaccines, mRNA vaccines, inactivated virions and viral vectors (Diamond et al., 2019) . However, vaccination may cause important issues, such as antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE), and recent FDA approved drug screenings have indicated that many drugs can effectively suppress ZIKV, including candesartan cilexetil , pinocembrin , aurintricarboxylic acid (Park et al. 2019) , ribavirin and sofosbuvir. However, how to protect pregnant women safely and effectively poses a substantial challenge for the development of small-molecule drugs. Although ribavirin can effectively inhibit ZIKV replication (Kim et al., 2018) , it is not yet widely available because it could cause haemolytic anaemia when administered orally over a long term (Russmann et al., https://doi.org/10.1016/j.virol.2020.04.009 Received 6 January 2020; Received in revised form 14 April 2020; Accepted 14 April 2020 2006). Research has reported that sofosbuvir can also inhibit ZIKV infection (Reznik and Ashby, 2017) , but it is not suitable for use in developing countries because of its cost (Bausch et al., 2010) .",

Enterovirus 71 (EV71) is suppressed by treatment with lycorine, which interferes with viral polyproteins during elongation (Liu et al., 2011) . Furthermore, lycorine inhibits the translocation of the ribonucleoprotein complex from the nucleus in the early stages of influenza virus H5N1 single-cycle and multicycle replication (He et al., 2013) .

ZIKV shows the highest sensitivity and low toxicity to brequinar (EC 50 values of 0.08 \u03bcM; CC 50 > 50 \u03bcM) (Adcock et al., 2017) . Therefore, brequinar was used as positive control. The cytotoxicities and inhibitory activities of lycorine and brequinar in Vero, A549 and Huh7 cells was determined by CCK8 (Dojindo, Kumamoto, Japan) and qRT-PCR, respectively. The cytotoxic concentration 50% (CC 50 ) values and 50% inhibition concentration (EC 50 ) values in Vero cells, A549 cells and Huh7 cells were shown in Table 1 . Thus, we concluded that lycorine is a potent inhibitor of ZIKV infection in multiple cell types.",

The qRT-PCR results showed that 1 \u03bcM lycorine displayed the strongest ability to decrease the vRNA and viral progeny particle load between -2 and 10 hpi ( Fig. 2A) . Analysis of the infectious viral proteins in the cells revealed that lycorine reduced viral protein synthesis (Fig. 2B) , which coincides with postentry events in the ZIKV replication cycle. Therefore, we hypothesized that lycorine interferes with the translation and replication of vRNA, and we performed Time-of-removal assay to test this hypothesis. First, lycorine was added at 6 hpi, prior to any significant vRNA synthesis. Compared to DMSO treatment, lycorine treatment fully abrogated vRNA synthesis (Fig. 2C) . Next, we added lycorine at 24 hpi and monitored the kinetics of ZIKV replication for an additional 12 h. At this point, viral replication compartments in infected cells are already established. As shown in Fig. 2D , lycorine had no effect on vRNA under these conditions. We also observed similar results for the viral protein level with vRNA ( Fig. 2E-2F) . Virus E protein was reduced by 52% and NS5 protein was reduced by 89% after 24 h of viral infection (Fig. 2G-2H) . Lycorine was added at 24 hpi, no significant difference in viral E and NS5 protein reduction (Fig. 2I-2J) . Therefore, we verified that lycorine inhibits the translation and replication of vRNA.",

By 9 dpi, mice in the ZIKV group began to succumb to the infection. In contrast, treatment with lycorine (10 mg/kg) protected against ZIKV infection-induced death by 83%. Lycorine treatment at doses of 5 mg/kg or 1 mg/kg enhanced the survival rates of mice to 66% and 33%, respectively. Mice in the lycorine and ZIKV groups began to lose weight by 5 dpi, those in the lycorine group recovered until 9 or 10 dpi, while those in the ZIKV group did not (Fig. 5B ). Viral RNA levels in the blood were quantified in all groups at 1,3 and 7 dpi. In our assay, viremia was observed from 1 dpi, with the highest levels being observed at 3 dpi, however the levels of viremia decreased at 7 dpi. Treatment with 1 mg/kg lycorine inhibited viral replication, but did not prolong the survival times of mice to the same extent as treatment with 5 mg/kg and 10 mg/kg lycorine. The levels of vRNA in the lycorine group were one order of magnitude lower than those in the ZIKV group at 1,3 and 7 dpi. As the concentration of the drug increased, the effect was more pronounced (Fig. 5C-5E ). The vRNA load in the brain and liver of mice was performed by RT-qPCR. The experiment showed that 10 mg/kg lycorine reduce the vRNA of brain tissue about three orders of magnitude. 5 mg/kg lycorine reduce the vRNA of brain tissue about one order of magnitude, while 1 mg/kg was not significant difference. As for liver tissue, 10 and 5 mg/kg lycorine reduce the vRNA of liver about one and half order of magnitude, respectively. 1 mg/kg was not significant difference. (Fig. 5F-G) . Next, we characterized the histopathological lesion changes in the brain and liver by haematoxylin & eosin staining. In the liver tissue, the cells in the ZIKV group were loosely arranged, and not in the form of strips, while cytoplasmic oedema, and hepatic sinus congestion were observed. Mice in the 10 mg/kg lycorine group displayed significantly reduced liver damage compared to those in the 5 mg/kg lycorine group. The inflammatory response of the cells was obvious in the 1 mg/kg lycorine treatment group. In brain tissues in the ZIKV group, the volume of cells was reduced, the nuclei were shrunken, voids were apparent around the cells and a nuclear membrane was present around the gap. In the 5 mg/kg and 10 mg/kg groups, lycorine significantly reduced the ZIKV-induced inflammatory response. In the 1 mg/kg group, brain tissue lesions were similar to those in the ZIKV group (Fig. 6) . Overall, these results confirmed the antiviral effect of lycorine treatment against ZIKV in vivo. H. Chen, et al. Virology 546 (2020) 88-97 4. Discussion ZIKV infection is a serious threat to global health, and there are currently no FDA-approved drugs or licensed vaccines available for the prevention or treatment of ZIKV infection. While antibody-based therapies have shown promise in mouse models, these drugs are expensive, in limited supply, and not validated in humans (Li et al., 2017) . Therefore, the discovery of drugs for ZIKV infection remains a priority.",

            "text": "CETSA, which is used to evaluate drug binding to target proteins, is based on the biophysical principle of the ligand-induced thermal stabilization of target proteins (Martinez et al., 2013) . One characteristic of the CETSA experiment is the comparison of the melting curve between the control and experimental groups, during which the protein is subjected to a panel of temperatures such that potential thermal stabilization can be assessed (Jafari et al., 2014) . The T agg values of NS5 ranged from 44.6 to 47.8\u00b0C, which shows that lycorine binds to NS5 and protects its stability. NS5 is the largest nonstructural protein, and contains an N-terminal methyltransferase (MTase) domain and a Cterminal RdRp domain (Lin et al., 2019) . The RdRp domain, which interacts with other viral and host factors to form a replicase complex responsible for their replication, is required for RNA synthesis and is essential for flavivirus replication. In a previous experiment, we demonstrated that lycorine inhibits the formation of vRNA. Therefore, we designed in vitro RNA polymerase assays to verify whether lycorine inhibits RdRp activity, and the experiment results showed that lycorine treatment inhibited RdRp activity. RdRp would be an ideal target option for anti-ZIKV infection because human host cells are devoid of RdRp (Lin et al., 2019) . Therefore, further studies are required to define the mechanism by which lycorine acts on RdRp. Lycorine inhibits HCV replication by inhibiting HSP70 (Chen et al., 2015) and EV71A by 2A protease (Guo et al., 2016) . HSP70 participates in the formation of virus replication complexes (Taguwa et al., 2019) . It is possibility that lycorine may inhibit ZIKV replication by inhibiting HSP70 protein. In this assay, we showed that lycorine inhibited ZIKV replication by inhibiting the activity of RdRp by detecting RdRp activity. RdRp also play a role in the replication of ZIKV (Lu et al., 2017) . This suggests that there may be multiple targets for lycorine to inhibit ZIKV replication. 2A protease of EV71A is a homologue of dengue NS3 protein. Dengue NS3 protein is similar to ZIKV NS3 protein (Jain et al., 2016) . The NS3 protein is activated by the NS2B protein to form NS2B-NS3 proteolytic enzymes, which are involved in the cleavage of ZIKV polyprotein (White et al., 2016) . Because there may be multiple targets for the inhibition of ZIKV by lycorine, we performed molecular docking experiments on the possible targets. As shown in the Table 2 , lycorine has the ability to bind to HSP70 and ZIKV NS3 protein, but the stability is weaker than the positive control. So in order to better clarify the effect of lycorine on sera of the mice collected at 1, 3 and 7dpi, as measured by qRT-PCR. Ct values for the known concentrations of RNA were plotted against the logs of the genome equivalent copy numbers. The resultant standard curve was used to determine the number of ZIKV RNA genome equivalents in the samples. (F-G) Viral RNA load in brain and liver tissue. The vRNA load in brain and liver of mice was determined by RT-qPCR. Data were shown as means \u00b1 SD. P \u2264 0.01 (**), P\u22640.001 (***), and P \u2264 0.0001 (****).",

In our research, the differential effects of lycorine administered at 1 mg/kg, 5 mg/kg and 10 mg/kg may have been due to the fact that 1 mg/kg lycorine does not inhibit ZIKA infection-induced apoptosis and a previous study showed that ZIKV infection induces apoptosis (Park et al. 2019) . Another possibility is that the daily administration of a high concentration of lycorine is required to prolong the survival of ZIKV-infected mice. However, the mechanisms underlying the prolonged survival and mortality outcomes of mice remain unknown. One major issues remain to be addressed for the further development of lycorine. It is a lack of knowledge about the its use of lycorine in pregnant women, and additional safety tests are thus required before lycorine can be used for the treatment of pregnant women. An improved animal model that allows a better estimation of the in vivo potency of lycorine, including non-human primate models, should be established for a preclinical toxicity study that may be beneficial for understanding the antiviral activity of lycorine for its use as a novel antiviral drug.",
