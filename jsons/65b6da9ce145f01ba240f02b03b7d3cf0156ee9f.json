            "text": "We introduce TEOBResumSP: an efficient yet accurate hybrid scheme for generating gravitational waveforms from spin-precessing compact binaries. Our approach Euler-rotates aligned-spin TEOBResumS effective-one-body waveforms from a precessing frame to an inertial frame. We obtain the Euler angles by solving the post-Newtonian precession equations expanded to (next-to) 4 leading (second post-Newtonian) order and use them in the waveform mode rotations to extend non-precessing TEOBResumS waveforms to generic spin configurations. The scheme is compared to current state-of-the-art precessing approximants NRSur7dq4 and SEOBNRv4PHM in terms of frequencydomain matches of the = 2 gravitational-wave strain for 200 and 1100 binaries, respectively, with the initial gravitational-wave frequencies between 20 and 50 Hz and the precessing spin parameter \u03c7p ranging up to one. The matches are better than 0.965 for 85% of the NRSur7dq4 and 75% of the SEOBNRv4PHM sets. The largest disagreements occur for large mass ratios and for large spin components along the orbital plane quantified in terms of a new parameter, S \u22a5,max , that we introduce. The disagreements stem from Euler-rotating non-precessing waveforms with constant spins, which can be replaced by time-varying z-components of spins. Our scheme provides a robust alternative precessing approximant to be employed in the parameter estimation of generic-spin compact binaries with TEOBResumSP waveforms. arXiv:2005.05338v2 [gr-qc] 13 May 2020",

For stellar-mass compact binary systems, there are currently three different approaches to generating the theoretical gravitational waves (GWs) resulting from the inspiral and merger of the systems: post-Newtonian theory [13] , numerical relativity, and the effective-one-body theory [14, 15] .",

As PN information is fully analytical, the resulting waveforms can be evaluated very quickly. Consequently, the LIGO-Virgo Collaboration (LVC) has at its disposalt a plethora of PN-based Taylor waveform approximants summarized in Ref. [18] .

As such, we can detect only the last few dozen cycles of their GWs before merger. Such GWs are generated in the very-strong-gravity regime where PN approximation is not reliable. This is the domain of numerical relativity (NR). Since the breakthroughs of 2005 [20] [21] [22] , it has become routine to evolve strongly gravitating spacetimes of compact binary mergers on large computing clusters. There are now several NR catalogs containing thousands of simulations of compact binary inspirals [23] [24] [25] [26] [27] [28] [29] [30] [31] .

            "text": "The effective-one-body (EOB) approach bridges PN theory and NR. It maps the two-body PN motion to a geodesic motion in an effective spacetime via a deformation performed in terms of a quantity called the symmetric mass ratio [14, 15] . In its core, EOB contains an effective Hamiltonian which resums the PN series in a suitable way to better embody the effects of the strong-field regime [32] . The inspiral is driven by a specially factorized/resummed radiation-reaction force [33] . The resulting multipolar gravitational waveforms are also written in a factorized form [34, 35] . The analytical EOB model is further supplemented with input from NR, thus extending the EOB evolution through the merger and, if exists, ringdown stages. These so-called EOBNR models [36] [37] [38] have been incorporated into several waveform-generating models (approximants) [37, [39] [40] [41] that are used for parameter estimation studies of LIGO-Virgo GW events. The main advantages of employing EOB-based waveform approximants for parameter estimation are that they (i) contain strong-field information (ii) can be extended to the full parameter space, and (iii) are much faster to evolve than NR simulations. In particular, EOB models are the only available method to accurately model binary neutron star coalescences from low frequencies and up to merger [19, [42] [43] [44] [45] . Thus, EOB is optimal for providing accurate waveforms for parameter estimation studies of long merger signals, and for extracting information about tides.",

For example, there are more than 20 precession cycles contributing to the phasing of the GWs for a BNS with total mass of 3 M inspiralling from 30 Hz, [49] . Therefore, given that the required relative phase accuracy of the theoretical waveform templates must be better than \u223c 10 \u22123 [50] , the templates must incorporate the effects of precession.

            "text": "There has been a dedicated and an ever-increasing effort to produce accurate gravitational waveforms from precessing compact binary systems. Initial developments were made in post-Newtonian theory [53, 54] after the pioneering work of Mathisson, Papapetrou, and Dixon (MPD) on the motion of spinning test particles in curved spacetimes [55] [56] [57] . There are now several waveform approximants available for precessing spin analysis (and implemented in the LIGO Algorithm Library (LAL) [58]), which are, chiefly: (i) SpinTaylorT class of approximants which employ 1.5PN analytical expressions of Ref. [59] for the waveform harmonic modes as functions of the spherical angles of the Newtonian orbital angular momentum vector. (ii) (IMR)PhenomP class of approximants which initially transformed non-precessing waveforms into precessing waveforms using a single parameter [60] then were later upgraded to transformations consisting of Euler rotations of the modes via three Euler angles [61] [62] [63] [64] . (iii) SEOBNR class of approximants [39, 65, 66] which evolve the EOB dynamics and precession equations as a coupled system to determine the Euler angles for the rotation of the non-precessing waveform modes. (iv) NRSur class which are surrogate waveform models that interpolate large sets of numerical relativity waveforms in a certain non-inertial co-precessing frame [67, 68] . All of these approximants solve the same precession equations, albeit truncated at different PN orders or suitably incorporated into a particular EOB Hamiltonian. The solutions to the precession equations are then translated into the spherical angles of the Newtonian orbital angular momentum. On the other hand, the approximants construct the waveforms differently, but these can be grouped into two main approaches: (1) Using analytical 1.5 PN expressions of Ref. [59] . (2) Using the so-called twist method of Ref. [69] which is what concerns us in this article so we provide some details next. Note that a twisting procedure is used also in the NRsur approximants where the surrogate is trained using precessing waveforms that are Euler-rotated to the non-inertial co-orbital frame.",

The precessing waveform is then obtained by twisting the QA waveform with three Euler angles as already described. Ref.

Though most of the reduced-order models have been built for non-precessing systems [77] [78] [79] [80] [81] [82] , they have eventually led to the emergence of NR \"trained\" precessing surrogates [67, 68, 83, 84] .

TEOBResumS is very different in its design from SEOBNRv4PHM, in particular in the spin sector [91] , thus provides the only fully independent waveform model from the approximants currently in use for GW analysis (e.g., PhenomPv3 uses fits of SEOBNR waveforms [66] ). Our goal in this initial implementation of TEOBResumSP is to introduce minimal modifications to the existing TEOBResumS infrastructure. Therefore, we opt for an approach whereby we produce aligned, constant spin waveforms using TEOBResumS then generate precessing waveforms by twisting the non-precessing waveforms as is done in, e.g., PhenomPv3HM.",

There are indications that the PN precession equations converge with increasing PN order despite missing higher-order information [98] . Indeed, we have found it slightly more beneficial to work with the N4LO precession equations rather than the NLO versions. We illustrate this is in App. B, where we show that the N4LO-Euler-angle twisted TEOBResumSP agrees better with both NRSur7dq4 and SEOBNRv4PHM than its NLO counterpart. This agreement is demonstrated specifically in terms of waveform strain mismatches which we introduce in Sec. IV. The NLO-N4LO disagreement is more severe for systems with more mass asymmetry, i.e., smaller values of q, which we show in terms of Euler angles in Fig, 11 in App. A. As the figure exhibits, there is considerable Euler-angle dephasing between NLO, NNLO, and N4LO solutions for small q, but no such dephasing between N3LO and N4LO, which we somewhat expect since their difference is at 2 PN. Here, as already stated, we work with N4LO ODEs, but provide more discussion on the various ODE orders in App. A We should add that instantaneous corrections to the orbit-averaged expressions start entering at N3LO [93] which we do not take into account here, but the precessing approximant SpinTaylorT4 has been upgraded to include these corrections. Our precession ODEs agree with those in the version of SpinTaylorT4 before the addition of these corrections.",

II C). We show such a cone in the right-hand panel along with its projection onto the plane perpendicular to JN(0). axes defined, it is straightforward to obtain",

We additionally show the components of the 1PN-corrected orbital angular momentum, L1PN (dashed blue), and the corresponding total angular momentum, J1PN (dashed gray). The dots mark the starting positions for each vector. As described in the text, orbital angular momenta spiral inward while total angular momenta spiral outward. Note that J1PN outspirals much less than JN. is aligned with J N (0). Moreover, because of radiation reaction, L N shrinks, resulting in a precession cone whose opening angle decreases in time. Thus, the projection of L N orthogonal to J N (0) shows circularly inspiraling tracks as in Fig. 2 . Furthermore, J also precesses around, in fact, out-spirals around J N (0), which we also exhibit in Fig. 2 . This spiralling behavior persists for PN-corrected L and J, albeit with smaller precession cone opening angles for J, as we show for L 1PN , J 1PN in the figure. For three-dimensional versions of these, see Apostolatos et al. [49] which still remains the most illustrative resource for understanding the qualitative behavior of precessing systems. Ref. [49] also provides a useful expression for the number of precession cycles when the masses are small and initial separation is large, i.e., |L N | |S 1 + S 2 |,",

Since the other approximants with which we compare TEOBResumSP use the L N (0) frame, we do the same. (ii) It is possible to extend the above scheme by coupling the precession ODEs to TEOBResumS dynamics, i.e., by setting \u03c7 i =L N (t) \u00b7 S i /m 2 i (i = 1, 2) at each time step of the aligned-spin EOB dynamics, whereL N (t), S i (t) are obtained from the N4LO precession dynamics. We have tested this approach to some extent as discussed below.",

In order to maximize the number of orbital cycles, hence the number of precession cycles, we set f 0 \u2208 [35, 40] Hz and M tot \u2208 [35, 40] M . Making these values any smaller tended to hit the low frequency bound of NRSur7dq4, and setting them higher would miss the one, or at best two, precession cycles that we expect. We further set \u03c7 1 = \u03c7 2 = 0.75 since NRSur7dq4's current upper limit is 0.8. As the blue triangles in Fig. 4 show, our set covers the {S \u22a5,max , \u03c7 p } space reasonably well. 7. Corner plots of the match (faithfulness) of the = 2-mode detector strain between TEOBResumSP and NRSur7dq4 for the 200 precessing compact binary inspirals. The corner parameters are \u03c7 eff,0 , S \u22a5,max , and the mass ratio q plotted here as 1/q to better relate to values more familiar in the NR community. The cooler colors (purple, blue) represent cases with M \u2265 0.965 while the warmer colors (orange, red) represent M \u2264 0.9. As can be seen in the right panel, most of the 1/q = 4 cases yielded M < 0.965 whereas in the 3 \u2264 1/q < 4 regime, M \u2265 0.965 mostly. Therefore, some of the disagreements for the q = 0.25 cases are likely due to the fact that this value is the lower bound of NRSur7dq4's range for q.",

As can be deduced from the middle and right panels of Fig. 7 , the TEOBResumSP-NRSur7dq4 matches also worsen for the q = 0.25 subset beside large S \u22a5,max cases, i.e., strong precession. Given that 0.25 < q \u2264 1/3 cases exhibit no such degradation, it is likely that the increased q = 0.25 mismatches are due to the fact the q = 0.25 is at the edge of NRSur7dq4's current interpolation range.

The q-S \u22a5,max corner plot situated in the left panel of the middle row is especially illustrative.",

We show how these two alternate twists perform against ours, dubbed Eq. (B2)[N4LO], in Fig. 12 , where it is evident that our twist produces consistently the smallest mismatches (red circles). The alternate twist formula of Eq. (B1) is clearly the worst choice producing M > 0.965 for only about two thirds of the set (black inverted triangles). The reason why Eq. (B1)[N4LO] still somehow manages to mostly yield M > 0.965 is due to both the fact that \u03b3 remains close to \u03b1 because \u03b2, starting from zero, is small for most binaries, and that the twisted (2, \u00b12) modes differ by a small amount as explained in Sec.

The details of the differences in the plotted NLO, N4LO mismatches lay with the differences in the Euler angles used in the respective twists. We have already shown in Fig. 11 how these Euler angles vary as the ODE truncation order goes from NLO to N4LO. For most cases, the difference in the angles become significant only in the last few orbital cycles, corresponding to the small differences between the NLO and N4LO mismatches of Fig. 12 . But for cases with small q, the differences in the Euler angles becomes more significant as can be seen in the middle panels of Fig. 11 . It is possible that the speed-up gained in using NLO-truncated precession ODEs, instead of N4LO, is significant enough to justify their use in parameter estimation. As we have not yet carried out detailed speed tests of our code, we can not verify or refute this hypothesis, but will do so with the next version of TEOBResumSP.",
