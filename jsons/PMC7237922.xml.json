I was hoping to greet you from beautiful San Diego, California, but nevertheless, I am thankful to have the opportunity to greet you from beautiful Cincinnati, Ohio\u2014home of the Reds, the Bengals, and Fiona the hippo\u2014and appreciate that you are taking the time to listen to this address. Before I start my address, I want to acknowledge how deeply disappointing it was for all of us that our annual SAHM meeting had to be cancelled due to the coronavirus pandemic, to protect the health of our members. However, I am thankful to the SAHM leaders who have spent countless hours managing this unprecedented challenge for our Society. These include the Executive Committee; our Executive Director Ryan Norton and his team at Kellen; the Program Committee, and our Board of Directors. What I have learned through this experience is that we are a powerful and resilient organization, and we will overcome this challenge and emerge even stronger. How do I know this? Because what I have observed over the past 2 weeks is that these constraints are bringing people even closer together and unleashing people's imaginations in all kinds of ways. This challenge has led to so many creative ideas; for example, how our meeting presenters can share content online, how committees and special interest groups can facilitate virtual meetings, and how we can foster networking in innovative ways. You will be hearing much more about these efforts over the coming days and weeks, but what I can tell you now is that we will continue to learn from, connect with, interact with, and support each other over the coming months.",

            "text": "So let's now look to our future together, and I'd like to start this address by sharing with all of you some of my emotions as I begin as your SAHM President. First, humility. I never could have imagined, when I attended my first SAHM meeting as a resident in 1996, that I would be giving a Presidential address one day to all of you whom I admire so deeply, and who are doing so much collective good in this world. I am humbled to be following in the footsteps of my heroes and heroines, who established and advanced the field of Adolescent Health and Medicine. Today I am thinking especially of Dr. Jerry Rauh, a founder of our field, who was a genuine servant leader and one of the kindest people I have ever met. He established the Division of Adolescent Medicine at Cincinnati Children 60 years ago, and it is a tremendous privilege to hold a Chair in his name. He served as SAHM's fifth President, and I'll serve as the 50th: I know that he would be tickled by that symmetry. I am also thinking of Dr. Gail Slap, who gave the Presidential address at the first SAHM meeting I attended and then\u2014lucky for me\u2014offered me my first faculty position. She was a brilliant and visionary leader, and she was incredibly supportive of me as a young mother. She encouraged me to flex my hours and take a 12-week maternity leave after the birth of my third child, which was a revelation and a key reason I remained in academic medicine. Finally, I am thinking of Dr. Manny Schydlower. The year he gave his Presidential address, 2001, was just a few weeks after my mom had died. I had hesitated to go to the annual meeting, but his words during the Presidential address resonated powerfully with me that day and made me realize why I needed to be there. He said, \u201cFor many years, I have felt that warmth, comfort, and sense of belonging to an organization that is my professional home and family.\u201d Recently, after we made the decision to cancel this year's annual meeting, he immediately reached out to reassure us that we had made the best possible decision, with the best interests of all in mind, and he finished with \u201cHard knocks do nothing to SAHM's resilience. We are unvanquished. Know that you have the solidarity and confidence of our Society.\u201d This was unimaginably comforting, and an example of what truly great leadership looks like.",

During each annual meeting and throughout the year, my interactions with all of you breathe new energy into me, fill me with determination, motivate me, and give me the resilience I need to \u201cput my hoodie on and get to work,\u201d as Dr. Trent has encouraged us to do over the past year.

More than 30% of all new HIV infections globally occur among youth 15\u201325 years of age [1]. Young black and Hispanic men who have sex with men are especially vulnerable, and we cannot overcome the HIV epidemic unless we end the stigma, promote testing, prevent HIV, and keep people living with HIV healthy [2]. The infection on all of our minds today is the novel coronavirus. Although thankfully, most youth appear to have mild disease, we still do not know the risk for youth with underlying medical conditions, and the lives of youth are being disrupted significantly by this pandemic; for example, due to loss of loved ones and social distancing measures that are severely interrupting their personal lives and education.",

Veronica Svetaz, Chair of the SAHM Diversity Committee, who founded the Aqui Para Ti youth development program and advocates passionately for health equity. Laura Grubb, who is doing a spectacular job in leading our SAHM Advocacy Committee. Matthew Aalsma, who co-chairs the Mental Health Committee and whose research focuses on mental health of youth in the juvenile justice system. Nneka Holder, who leads work in adolescent vaccination as chair of our SAHM vaccination committee. Holly Fontenot, who leads the SAHM nursing research SIG and a research program focusing on prevention of HIV and HPV. Tornia Wyllie, our new Trainee Representative to the Board of Directors, whose goal is to develop Adolescent Medicine in the Caribbean. Jason Nagata, who facilitates the careers of young professionals through both SAHM and the International Association for Adolescent Health.

The Governance Review Committee, led by Dr. Nicola Gray, has been working diligently over the last year on a deep dive of our governance structures involving data collection from many SAHM members. The Annual Meeting Strategic Planning Committee, led by Dr. Gina Sucato, recently sent out a survey to the SAHM membership which is gathering valuable feedback. Three early themes that have emerged from this work is that you, our SAHM members, want: (1) improved communication and transparency across the organization; (2) more clearly defined roles and responsibilities for the SAHM Board, Committees, Regional Chapters, and special interest groups; and (3) clearer pathways toward leadership opportunities.",

First, I will create opportunities for you to share your personal mission statements and your leadership stories, so that we can all learn from each other, and to scale up the work that so many of you are leading. Please share those with me over the coming year, so that I can include them in our SAHM Matters newsletter\u2014in a section of my President's column called \u201cSAHMLeads,\u201d and through the listserv and web site. Second, I will facilitate ways in which members can more meaningfully engage with and lead within SAHM, guided by the work of our strategic planning committees and board. Third, we will create clearer paths to leadership, including leadership workshops I hope to launch at the 2021 annual meeting. Fourth, we will ensure that our leadership is diverse in all dimensions: because the more diverse, the better equipped we will be to solve the most complex challenges in adolescent health. And by the way, I am exceedingly proud to be part of an organization whose last 20 presidents were 50% women; 30% of whom were African-American. Just look at these incredible, powerful women: Drs. Trina Anglin, Andrea Marks, Abigail English, Mary-Ann Shafer, Leslie Walker-Harding, Debra Katzman, Carol Ford, Tamera Coyne Beasley, Deborah Christie, and Maria Trent.",

In the next 10\u201320 years, powerful forces will affect adolescent health and well-being globally. We in SAHM\u2014in partnership with our sister organizations such as the International Association of Adolescent Health and the American Academy of Pediatrics\u2014are exceptionally well positioned to be the voice for our patients on a national and global stage and to address the following questions: What clinical strategies should we develop and scale that will transform health outcomes and promote equity? How can we harness advances in science and technology\u2014including artificial intelligence, big data, and genomics\u2014to improve adolescent health? How can we advocate most effectively for the issues that will impact adolescent health in the future, such as climate change? How can we maximize our understanding of adolescents across different cultures and their unique strengths and needs? How can we best engage adolescents and families in this work?
