Almost half of these cases were related to use of antiangiogenic agents, involved in 26 (25.5%) reported cases of digestive perforation with a 30.8% mortality rate in the ICU. Of these, three cases (11.5%) were attributed to necrosis of metastatic digestive lesions. As reported in Table 1, digestive perforations were already described in 1\u20136% of patients in clinical trials assessing bevacizumab in several types of cancer [18\u201326]. In addition, we collected 23 (22.5%) cases of antiangiogenic-related cardiovascular issues, of which seven (30.4%) were lethal. Although the molecular mechanisms through which VEGF inhibitor use leads to cardiotoxicity remain unclear, it is suggested that patients with proteinuria and hypertension immediately after beginning antiangiogenic therapy are at increased risk for later cardiac AEs [27]. These findings pinpoint the importance of cardiovascular assessment before and during treatment with angiogenesis inhibitors, particularly for multi-targeted small molecules such as sunitinib and sorafenib [28].",

            "text": "The most significant reported immunotherapy-related serious toxicity was colitis or ileitis (n = 18, 21.2%), which is consistent with immunotherapy clinical trial results [29\u201337]. Surprisingly, only one case of life-threatening perforated enterocolitis due to ipilimumab and nivolumab combination was reported in literature [38], although the latter further increased the risk of autoimmune-like issues in clinical trials [30, 31]. Conceivably, the novelty of immunotherapies explains the small number and the heterogeneity of published cases we report. As recently reported by Wang et al., irAEs associated with the highest rate of mortality in the ICU in our cohort were fulminant myocarditis and neurologic events. However, analysis of the pharmacovigilance database indicates that fatal irAEs remain uncommon, occurring at a rate of 0.3\u20131.3% [39].",

Although the paucity and variability regarding case reporting do not allow us to generalize this result, this figure is consistent with some previous studies focusing on survival of solid cancer patients admitted to the ICU [40]. Taken together, all these data emphasize the need for a careful selection of patients who are candidates for a targeted molecular therapy. An exhaustive and personalized evaluation of toxicity risk before treatment initiation is warranted. In particular, an autoimmune work-up aiming to rule out a subclinical systemic disease should be consistently undertaken. As recently shown by Johnson et al., patients with underlying pre-existing autoimmunity disease should not be de facto ineligible for immunotherapy, but would imperatively require thorough monitoring during and after treatment [41]. Critical care specialists and oncologists should be aware of warning symptoms for a prompt diagnosis of drug-related AEs, which might be resolved early with a dose reduction or transient discontinuation of treatment. Furthermore, although management of steroid-refractory irAEs with immunomodulatory medications such as infliximab, mycophenolate mofetil, or tacrolimus may be efficient in some cases [42\u201345], prospective trials assessing different treatment modalities are needed. Here, we report a published case of ipilimumab-related hepatitis refractory to mycophenolate mofetil but which resolved with use of T cell depleting antibody anti-thymocyte globulin [46]. Ultimately, more data are needed regarding optimal dose and administration schedule of ipilimumab to curtail the risk of autoimmune-like or immune-related toxicity [8], given the possible dose-toxicity relationship [37, 47].",

First of all, the small number of reported cases and their retrospective nature hamper assessment of molecular treatment imputability, particularly in the case of therapeutic combinations including chemotherapy and other drugs. Moreover, administered doses of targeted molecules are not always mentioned. Secondly, patients with life-threatening anticancer drug-related AEs may have declined, or were denied for ICU referral and were not included in this review. Furthermore, we could not differentiate ICU patients from HDU patients in some reported cases. Last, another important bias of this review lies in the reporting of only published cases (Fig. 1S). However, hierarchy in terms of proportions is maintained between AEs with respect to those described in pivotal clinical trials for each drug (Table 1), suggesting that our review may be representative of real-world patients, although widely underestimating the absolute number of serious drug-related AEs.",
