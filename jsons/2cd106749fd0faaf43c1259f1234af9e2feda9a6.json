The virus is transmitted primarily by certain species of biting midges in the genus Culicoides, which become infected after taking a blood meal from an infected viraemic host (Mellor et al., 2000; Venter et al., 2009) . Although AHS is endemic in sub-Saharan Africa, outbreaks with devastating effects have occurred in North Africa, the Middle East, the Arabian Peninsula and southern Europe (Howell, 1960; Rafyi, 1961; Diaz Montilla and Panos Marti, 1967; Lubroth, 1988; Rodriguez et al., 1992; Portas et al., 1999) . Different factors such as climate change (Purse et al., 2008; Tabachnick, 2010) and increased international trade and movement of animals (MacLachlan and Guthrie, 2010; Martinez-Lopez et al., 2011) have raised concerns that AHSV may be re-introduced in European countries.

Like other members of this genus, AHSV is non-enveloped and has a complex capsid structure (Manole et al., 2012) . The virion is comprised of two concentric protein shells surrounding the genome of 10 linear segments of double-stranded (ds) RNA, which are designated from segment 1 (S1) to S10 in decreasing order of size (Bremer et al., 1990) . The outer capsid comprises two proteins, VP2 and VP5, which together form a continuous layer that covers the inner capsid or core. The core particle is composed of two major (VP3 and VP7) and three minor (VP1, VP4 and VP6) proteins, in addition to the dsRNA genome (Manole et al., 2012) . The outer capsid proteins are removed during cell entry and transcriptionally active core particles are released into the cytosol where virus replication occurs (Forzan et al., 2007) . Within the core particle, each of the dsRNA genome segments are repeatedly transcribed by the core-associated enzymes VP1 (RNA-dependant RNA polymerase), VP4 (capping-enzyme) and VP6 (helicase), resulting in extrusion of newly synthesized capped viral singlestranded RNA (ssRNA). The extruded positive-sense transcripts have the dual function of serving as templates for the synthesis of Contents lists available at ScienceDirect journal homepage: www.elsevier.com/locate/yviro viral proteins and for negative-sense RNA synthesis during dsRNA replication (Mertens and Diprose, 2004; Patel and Roy, 2014) . In addition to the structural proteins, other AHSV-encoded proteins (NS1, NS2, NS3 and NS4) are also produced in infected cells where they are thought to be involved in virus replication, morphogenesis and release of progeny virus particles (Uitenweerde et al., 1995; van Staden et al., 1995; Maree and Huismans, 1997; Zwart et al., 2015) . Although the veterinary (Guthrie, 2007; Clift and Penrith, 2010) and vaccine-related aspects of AHSV have received some attention (Scanlen et al., 2002; Guthrie et al., 2009; Alberca et al., 2014) , AHSV replication and the role of individual viral proteins in this process, as well as AHSV-host cell interactions remain largely uncharacterized. A reverse genetics system to engineer viable virus containing targeted sequence modifications has become an essential tool for the molecular dissection of viral gene products, studies regarding viral replication and pathogenesis, and for the development of vaccines. The development of a reverse genetics system for the Reoviridae family has lagged behind that of other RNA virus families due to technical complexities associated with the manipulation of multi-segmented dsRNA genomes (Komoto and Taniguchi, 2013; Trask et al., 2013) . Nevertheless, in recent years, reverse genetics systems have been developed for rotavirus (genus Rotavirus), reoviruses (genus Orthoreovirus), as well as AHSV, bluetongue virus (BTV) and epizootic haemorrhagic disease virus (EHDV) (genus Orbivirus) (Komoto et al., 2006; Kobayashi et al., 2007; Boyce et al., 2008; Kaname et al., 2013; Vermaak et al., 2015; Yang et al., 2015) . For rotavirus, single gene replacement systems that require helper virus, selection, or both have been developed (Komoto et al., 2006; Trask et al., 2010; Troupin et al., 2010) . In contrast, helper virus-independent reverse genetics systems have been established for reoviruses and orbiviruses. AHSV, BTV and EHDV can be recovered by the transfection of in vitro-transcribed and capped RNAs into permissive cell lines (Boyce et al., 2008; Vermaak et al., 2015) or into cells that had previously been transfected with helper expression plasmids that synthesize the core proteins and the two non-structural proteins NS1 and NS2 (Kaname et al., 2013; Matsuo and Roy, 2013; Yang et al., 2015) . An entirely plasmid only-based reverse genetics system has been developed for mammalian orthoreovirus (Kobayashi et al., 2007) and, more recently, for BTV (Pretorius et al., 2015) and a fusogenic bat-borne orthoreovirus (Kawagishi et al., 2016) . The development of reverse genetics has revolutionized the study of reoviruses and BTV (Roy, 2013) by providing a powerful tool for investigating virus replication and disease.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 161, "end": 182, "text": "(Manole et al., 2012)", "ref_id": "BIBREF30"}, {"start": 392, "end": 413, "text": "(Bremer et al., 1990)", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 681, "end": 702, "text": "(Manole et al., 2012)", "ref_id": "BIBREF30"}, {"start": 866, "end": 887, "text": "(Forzan et al., 2007)", "ref_id": "BIBREF15"}, {"start": 1445, "end": 1472, "text": "(Mertens and Diprose, 2004;", "ref_id": "BIBREF35"}, {"start": 1473, "end": 1493, "text": "Patel and Roy, 2014)", "ref_id": "BIBREF38"}, {"start": 1564, "end": 1569, "text": "(NS1,", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1570, "end": 1574, "text": "NS2,", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1575, "end": 1587, "text": "NS3 and NS4)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1737, "end": 1763, "text": "(Uitenweerde et al., 1995;", "ref_id": "BIBREF59"}, {"start": 1764, "end": 1788, "text": "van Staden et al., 1995;", "ref_id": "BIBREF62"}, {"start": 1789, "end": 1814, "text": "Maree and Huismans, 1997;", "ref_id": "BIBREF31"}, {"start": 1815, "end": 1834, "text": "Zwart et al., 2015)", "ref_id": "BIBREF70"}, {"start": 1861, "end": 1876, "text": "(Guthrie, 2007;", "ref_id": "BIBREF18"}, {"start": 1877, "end": 1901, "text": "Clift and Penrith, 2010)", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}, {"start": 1967, "end": 1989, "text": "(Scanlen et al., 2002;", "ref_id": "BIBREF50"}, {"start": 1990, "end": 2011, "text": "Guthrie et al., 2009;", "ref_id": "BIBREF19"}, {"start": 2012, "end": 2033, "text": "Alberca et al., 2014)", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}, {"start": 2668, "end": 2696, "text": "(Komoto and Taniguchi, 2013;", "ref_id": "BIBREF26"}, {"start": 2697, "end": 2716, "text": "Trask et al., 2013)", "ref_id": "BIBREF56"}, {"start": 2968, "end": 2989, "text": "(Komoto et al., 2006;", "ref_id": "BIBREF25"}, {"start": 2990, "end": 3013, "text": "Kobayashi et al., 2007;", "ref_id": "BIBREF23"}, {"start": 3014, "end": 3033, "text": "Boyce et al., 2008;", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 3034, "end": 3054, "text": "Kaname et al., 2013;", "ref_id": "BIBREF21"}, {"start": 3055, "end": 3076, "text": "Vermaak et al., 2015;", "ref_id": "BIBREF64"}, {"start": 3077, "end": 3095, "text": "Yang et al., 2015)", "ref_id": "BIBREF66"}, {"start": 3211, "end": 3232, "text": "(Komoto et al., 2006;", "ref_id": "BIBREF25"}, {"start": 3233, "end": 3252, "text": "Trask et al., 2010;", "ref_id": "BIBREF57"}, {"start": 3253, "end": 3274, "text": "Troupin et al., 2010)", "ref_id": "BIBREF58"}, {"start": 3517, "end": 3537, "text": "(Boyce et al., 2008;", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 3538, "end": 3559, "text": "Vermaak et al., 2015)", "ref_id": "BIBREF64"}, {"start": 3725, "end": 3746, "text": "(Kaname et al., 2013;", "ref_id": "BIBREF21"}, {"start": 3747, "end": 3768, "text": "Matsuo and Roy, 2013;", "ref_id": "BIBREF33"}, {"start": 3769, "end": 3787, "text": "Yang et al., 2015)", "ref_id": "BIBREF66"}, {"start": 3892, "end": 3916, "text": "(Kobayashi et al., 2007)", "ref_id": "BIBREF23"}, {"start": 3945, "end": 3969, "text": "(Pretorius et al., 2015)", "ref_id": "BIBREF41"}, {"start": 4010, "end": 4034, "text": "(Kawagishi et al., 2016)", "ref_id": "BIBREF22"}, {"start": 4124, "end": 4135, "text": "(Roy, 2013)", "ref_id": "BIBREF49"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Introduction"}, {"text": "Here, we report the development of a plasmid-only reverse genetics system for AHSV-4 that allows for recovery of the virus from 10 cDNA clones representing the viral genome.

Compared to the 10-plasmid reverse genetics system, this 5-plasmid strategy enhanced the efficiency of virus recovery by reducing the time to virus isolation and supporting increased total yields. The efficiency of virus recovery may have been enhanced by different mechanisms. Firstly, there are fewer plasmids that need to be transfected into each cell, and thus there is a higher probability that a full set of viral RNAs will accumulate in a cell for initiation of replication. Secondly, it is possible that only a small fraction of transfected plasmids avoid degradation and remain intact for transcription. By decreasing the number of plasmids the probability that a single cell will contain all of the transcription cassettes in a sufficient number is enhanced. Thirdly, constriction of transcription and translation of individual RNAs to the same intracellular microenvironment may greatly facilitate protein-protein and protein-RNA interactions required for virus recovery (Neumann et al., 2005; Kobayashi et al., 2010) .

However, the same reassortant virus was also recovered successfully by combining the four AHSV-4 dual vectors with two single reverse genetics plasmids, which contained cDNA copies of the S5 and S6 genome segments, respectively. The efficiency of virus recovery was slightly lower compared to the use of 5 dual plasmids and is likely due to a lower transfection efficiency associated with the requirement for an additional plasmid for transection (data not shown). Such an approach may be useful to generate so-called \"serotyped\" vaccine strains in which the immunogenic outer capsid proteins are exchanged with those of other virus serotypes (van Gennip et al., 2012; Feenstra et al., 2014 Feenstra et al., , 2015 van de Water et al., 2015) .

Size markers (M) in base pairs are indicated. Plasmid-based AHSV-4 reverse genetics system driven by a plasmid-encoded T7 RNA polymerase. (A) Schematic of the experimental strategy. A monolayer of BSR or L929 cells is co-transfected with a modified 5-plasmid set, in which the T7 RNA polymerase expression cassette is incorporated into the genetic backbone of the pJAD-S2-S6 reverse genetics plasmid to yield pJAD-S2-S6-T7pol. In cells co-transfected with the 5 plasmids, T7 RNA polymerase is expressed under control of a CMV promoter, which induces expression of transcripts corresponding to the native AHSV-4 positive-sense transcripts from the plasmids. After incubation for 3 days, recombinant viruses are recovered by plaque assays of the transfection cell lysates on BSR cells. (B) Plaque formation by recovered AHSV-4 viruses generated with the modified 5-plasmid reverse genetics system using BSR and L929 cells, as indicated in the figure. Mock-transfected cells were included as controls. (C) Comparison of virus recovery with the modified 5-plasmid system using BSR and L929 cells. Virus titres in supernatants of co-transfected BSR or L929 cells were determined at different time post-transfection by plaque assays on BSR cells. The results are presented as the mean titres of three independent experiments and error bars indicate the standard deviation. (D) Electropherotypes of the recovered viruses obtained by electrophoresis of viral dsRNA from wild-type (WT) AHSV-4 and dsRNAs obtained from recombinant AHSV-4 viruses recovered with the modified 5-plasmid system in BSR cells (lane 1) and L929 cells (lane 2)", "latex": null, "type": "figure"}, "FIGREF4": {"text": ".
