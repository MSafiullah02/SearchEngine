The immaturity of the immune system is cited as a plausible explanation.1 Children can swiftly progress to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). They may also have shock, encephalopathy, myocardial injury or heart failure, coagulation dysfunction, and acute kidney injury.",

The fixed-effects model is practically applied when the studies across which the data is being pooled have, similar study parameters, and are devoid of any major heterogeneity. Hence, this model is often used to assess cohorts within a singular larger study. Nevertheless, the meta-analysis by Zhang et al., where multiple different studies are used, are inherently predisposed to heterogeneity due to the differential protocols and parameters of individual study. We propose the \u201crandom effects model\u201d for this study.3\n,\n4\n",
