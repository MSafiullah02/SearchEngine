            "text": "tertiary paediatric ED, 5 20% (95% CI 17.2 to 22.7) developed chronic (>4 weeks duration) cough after an acute respiratory infection (ARI). Of those, 42% were diagnosed at specialist review with protracted bacterial bronchitis (PBB) and 32% were found to have a previously undiagnosed respiratory disorder, including asthma, large airway lesions (such as tracheomalacia), obstructive sleep apnoea and bronchiectasis (unpublished) . Chronic cough in children is an under-recognised, but important cause of morbidity and decreased quality of life (QoL). 6 Although an economic evaluation has never been undertaken, chronic cough likely accounts for substantial direct and indirect economic costs. 7 An Australian study found that >80% of parents had sought five or more medical consultations for their child in the 12 months immediately prior to referral to respiratory specialists for their child's chronic cough. 7 Nevertheless, there are few high-quality studies that address the natural history of acute and chronic cough and none completed that have a predominant focus on Australian Indigenous children. Systematic reviews of the natural history of acute cough in children in primary healthcare found wide variation in the design and quality of studies. 8 9 There was large variability in the duration of illnesses evaluated, how outcomes were measured and completeness of follow-up. Importantly, in most studies addressing acute cough in children, validated outcome measures for cough were not used; those with prolonged cough were not reviewed and there was no differentiation between 'wet' and 'dry' types. 9 Wet cough is important as it implies increased airway secretions and usually indicates clinically significant lower airway infection and neutrophilic inflammation. 10 11 For example, chronic wet cough is the most common symptom of bronchiectasis 12 and early diagnosis and treatment improves long-term outcomes. 13 14 Indigenous people are at high risk of developing chronic pulmonary disorders. Indeed, in nationwide data for Indigenous Australians, respiratory disorders are: (1) the most common reason for primary healthcare encounters; (2) the second most prevalent selfreported chronic condition and (3) the second most common cause for hospitalisation. 15 Overall, 27% of Indigenous people report some form of respiratory disease; 19% in those aged <14 years and 38% in those aged >55 years. In remote Indigenous children, the rates of hospitalisation for ARI and radiographically diagnosed pneumonia, 16 17 and the incidence of bronchiectasis, 18 are among the highest reported worldwide. Recurrent ARI episodes are common 17 and studies in Indigenous children from central and northern Australia demonstrated associations between these infections and subsequent diagnosis of bronchiectasis. 19 20 To date, the focus on ARI has been largely on remote Indigenous children, with limited community-based data from those living in urban settings. This is despite socioeconomic and health indices being consistently lower for urban Indigenous populations compared with non-Indigenous groups. 15 The lack of data on urban and rural Indigenous populations has been identified as a significant barrier to 'Closing the Gap' initiatives. 21 Although over half of the Indigenous population live in urban and regional centres, most research addresses the health and social issues of remote communities and only 11% of all articles about Indigenous health during a 5-year period addressed urban populations. 21 However, preliminary data from our ongoing cohort study of ARI in young urban Indigenous children 22 suggest 20% will develop chronic cough post-ARI, principally from PBB.",

This was conducted in five Australian cities where 272 children (mean age 4.5 years, SD 3.7) newly referred to a paediatric respiratory physician were randomly allocated to either early review and use of a cough algorithm or usual care until review and subsequent use of a predefined cough algorithm. 27 28 The study 28 found that children in the 'early-arm' group had significantly better clinical outcomes (ie, cough resolution at week 6 postintervention; absolute risk reduction=24.7%, 95% CI 13% to 35%) and better cough-specific QoL compared with the control group. However, in this study, 28 the median duration of cough at enrolment was 16 weeks (IQR , and investigating earlier intervention is warranted. Furthermore, the use of the cough algorithm in 346 children found that \u223c18% had a serious underlying illness. Indigenous children (10/34; 29 .4%) were more likely to have bronchiectasis than non-Indigenous children (6.7%; 21/312; OR=5.78, 95% CI 2.15 to 14.5; p<0.001). 29 Despite the high burden of ARI, there are little published data on interventions for acute and chronic cough, especially for urban and regional Indigenous children. An ARI sometimes unmasks a previously unrecognised chronic respiratory illness, which is a major problem in Indigenous Australians, but one that receives limited attention. [30] [31] [32] Early diagnosis and management of chronic respiratory illness in children reduces morbidity and improves QoL. This RCT will therefore answer the primary question: 'Amongst children aged <15 years with chronic cough post-ARI, does active intervention at 4 weeks improve clinical outcomes?'",

Weekly telephone and/or email and/or face-to-face contacts collect cough status, type (ie wet, dry variable) and cough score, 33 medication (including over-the-counter remedies) and health service provider use for the cough and cost-of-illness data. Wet and dry cough are classified as per parent/carer reports, which were found previously to be accurate (compared with respiratory physician and bronchoscopy) in a study of children with chronic cough. 34 The cost-of-illness data are collected at each parent/carer contact, specialist review and from examining medical records. A minimum of three contact attempts are made at each weekly time-point. We did not employ daily diary cards as planned originally, since although their use in chronic cough studies was reliable, we found that in children with acute cough diary completion and return rates were low during preliminary work undertaken for this study. We also could not use smartphone apps as the ownership of smart phones in the target communities is low. Thus, instead we relied on weekly parent recall of acute child illness, which has been shown to introduce minimal bias (<10%) in prevalence studies. 35 At day 28, any child with persistent cough (ie, \u22643 day break in cough in the preceding 28 days) is randomised (1:1 allocation) to clinical review and initiation of the cough management algorithm or to continue weekly follow-up. All study participants continue weekly follow-up until day 56 and any child still coughing at that time point undergoes clinical review until a definitive diagnosis is established or the child exits the protocol. The decision to follow children until day 56 was based on data from our ED cough study, suggesting 42% of children with persistent cough at day 28 will be diagnosed with PBB (manuscript in preparation) that resolves with a 14-day course of amoxycillin-clavulanic acid. Children requiring ongoing care beyond two study physician reviews are referred to a tertiary paediatric respiratory medicine service.",

The use of guidelines by clinicians depends on several factors, which include level of evidence, feasibility, degree of implementation and inherent clinician factors. 58 Using an algorithm facilitates clinical guideline implementation by clearly describing pathways of care based on whether the child presents with a specific or non-specific cough. While this study uses specific study physicians, the overall goal is widespread adoption of the guidelines and management algorithm in the primary healthcare setting. Our extensive data collection, including direct and indirect costs of illness and healthcare provision, are important in achieving this goal.

Further, the CEA of the intervention will provide data critical to clinical and public policy decisions with respect to incorporation of the intervention into routine care at the primary and tertiary healthcare levels. Such decisions will be enhanced by our incorporation of direct and indirect costs to the family, the community and the healthcare sector, 60 particularly given the focus on resource allocation in Indigenous health in Australia, 61 and the different mechanisms for delivery of primary healthcare services compared with mainstream Australia. 62 We have incorporated microbiological components into the RCT as the role of infectious agents in the transition from ARI to chronic wet cough remains largely unknown. Whether persistent shedding, new acquisition and/or virus-bacteria interactions are associated with the development of chronic cough post-ARI is a clinical and research gap needing to be addressed. A study of 170 children aged 5-16 years presenting to their family physician with a cough lasting >14 days detected M. pneumoniae and B. pertussis in 12.9% and 36.6%, respectively. 63 Cough duration was shorter in M. pneumoniae than B. pertussis cases and codetection with respiratory viruses was not associated with cough duration. 63 An important limitation of this study 63 was that data were not collected from the time of ARI onset. Other studies 64 have also tested for bacteria and viruses in nasopharyngeal specimens, but to date none have followed children from ARI onset and examined the association with developing chronic cough. In the analyses of microbiological data collected in our study of children attending an ED with cough, M. cattarhalis detected by PCR in anterior nasal swabs collected at time presentation was the only organism independently associated with persistent cough at 4 weeks after controlling for age, gender and the presence of any viruses. 5 Our Brisbane-based lower airway studies of children with chronic cough from PBB found intense neutrophilic airway inflammation and evidence of innate immune activation, suggesting that PBB may follow a single ARI episode with impaired pathogen clearance from the airways, either permanently or temporarily leading to a cycle of chronic inflammation. 65 Small case series from the late 1990s have reported chronic pulmonary sequelae following influenza infection in young children 66 and a relationship between adenovirus infection and bronchiectasis. 67 The major threats to the validity of our proposal are loss to follow-up and potential for contamination of the control group based on the type of standard care they may receive. In our current ARI study in urban Indigenous children, loss to follow-up at the 4-week time point post-ARI is 23%. Procedures to minimise this loss include: home visiting by Indigenous research personnel, regular text and email messaging, and personal letters to families. Analysis plans will include measures to account for missing data and sensitivity analyses to assess the extent of bias.",
