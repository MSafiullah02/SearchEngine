The proposition is advanced that the ethical resolution of such conflicts requires an ethic of social medicine comparable to the existing ethic of clinical medicine. Comparing and contrasting the obligations clinicians incur under both aspects of the ethics of medicine is propadeutic to any ordering of priorities between them. The suggested partition of obligations between patient good and the common good is applicable beyond medicine to the other health professions. and actual conflicts between the good of individual patients and the good of society are realities in managed care and in proposed systems of health care reform. As a result of all this, some bioethicists even suggest that the focus of the physician's ethics should be society, not the individual patient.",

Rather, the good is defined by natural law that sees societies and life in communities as essential for humans if humans are to develop their full potentialities as human beings. 11 Neither Aristotle nor Aquinas could imagine the enormous capabilities of today's medicine, which when properly used, can enhance social and individual flourishing. But it is not unreasonable to assume that they would regard health and medical care as among the responsibilities of a good society toward its citizens, but not their highest good. Health would be at the least a material and instrumental good for both the individual and the society. At best it would be a material necessity that the State should assure for all.

It could not be left to the fortuitous interplay of commerce, the competitive marketplace, and the medical entrepreneur.",

The health \"system,\" not the physician, in effect becomes the patient's healer, advocate, and guarantor of safety. 14 Our line of argument rejects these calls for a \"new\" ethic of medicine. It also resists trends to establish societal duties as primary for clinicians. We acknowledge that medicine as a practice, and physicians and health professionals within that practice, do have social obligations. Nonetheless, these obligations can, and must, be served without sacrifice of the trust relationship inherent in the clinical encounter.

Iris Murdoch put it this way: \"The philosopher is no longer to speak of something real and transcendent but to analyze the familiar activity of endowing things with value.\" 17 The shift from consideration of ends to consideration of \"value\" choices lies at the root of confusion about social medicine and its philosophy as well. On the modernist view, social medicine should be aimed at whatever people value or choose among the sentiments of liberal society. The continuing debate about prescribing growth hormones for healthy, but smaller than average children, is an example of how social mores about size and its importance directly influence clinical medicine and public policy. The debate about the proper use of this and other capabilities of modern medicine, like so many others, will be interminable if it is not anchored somehow in a notion of the good for humans as it relates to the powers of modern biotechnology.

These are principles which a society, concerned with preservation of the dignity of its citizens as humans, must assure. At this level, the qualities of justice are to be observed with respect to health care. Justice here is understood as the equality of treatment of all human beings who are equally vulnerable with respect to illness and death.

It is a heuristic theory that not only describes current practices, but also relates these in theory to one's own experiences of illness and repair. 35 Feminist bioethics might also be seen as another form of this view, insofar as it focuses upon the power relation of gender within medicine and the vulnerabilities that arise from differences in the social status of genders.

Nonetheless, the \"universal principles of health and disease\" are discoverable, analyzable, and manipulatable by persons other than those professing to heal individuals. Basic scientists, for example, are charged with, or have taken on, the laudable goals of improving the health of all human beings. Furthermore, examining the structures of illness and healing are at least in part the goals of a philosophy of medicine. The individualities pursued by physicians arise from more general causes and return back, mutatis mutandis, to existential structures of human existence through the individual.",

But since art is not the chief cause of health, but aids nature and assists it, it is necessary that the physician take from natural philosophy the more important principles of his science, as the navigator borrows from the astronomer.

Clinical medicine so defined is the activity that defines clinicians qua clinicians and sets them apart from other persons who may have medical knowledge but do not use it specifically in clinical encounters, like the basic scientist or public health physician. Clinical medicine is the clinician's locus ethicus, whose end is a right and good healing action and decision for individual patients. Similarly, nursing at the bedside, dentistry, clinical psychiatry, social work, etc, each has its own locus ethicus. 41 Moreover, clinical medicine is the instrument through which many public poli-cies come to affect the lives of sick persons. No matter how broadly or socially-oriented we take medicine to be, illness will remain a universal human experience. Its impact upon individual human persons is the reason why medicine and physicians exist in the first place. 42 Using clinical medicine as the paradigm for a philosophy of social medicine does not neglect the other branches of medicine, each of which has its own distinctive end. Thus, for basic scientists the end is the acquisition of fundamental biological knowledge of health and illness. This knowledge becomes a part of clinical medicine specifically when it is applied to the needs of a particular human being here and now. Similarly, preventive medicine has as its defining end, i.e., the cultivation of health and avoidance of illness. Hence, social medicine has its end in the health of the community or the whole body politic. When the knowledge and skills of any of the other branches of medicine are used in the healing of a particular person, then the ends of that branch fuse with the ends of clinical medicine. In clinical medicine, clinical nursing, etc., the good of the patient is the end, primus inter pares. 43 In social medicine, it is the good of society.",

The proposition has been advanced that a philosophy and ethic of social medicine (or the medicine of society) is required that is comparable to the existing philosophy and ethic of clinical medicine. By comparing and contrasting the ethics and functions of clinical and social medicine some order of priority can be established when they come into conflict. The implications for clinicians in the partition of their ethical obligations to both patients and society are spelled out in terms of both an ethic of clinical and social medicine.
