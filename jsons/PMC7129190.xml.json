Accurate data on the burden of respiratory virus infection is critical for patient management, infection control measures and public health policies. Current clinical guidelines suggest that respiratory virus should be tested in patients with respiratory symptoms, or those with myocarditis or encephalitis [2]. As a result, epidemiological data on respiratory virus infection mostly rely on studies analysing patients with clinical evidence of respiratory tract infection [1], [9], [11], [12], [13], [14], [15]. However, non-respiratory symptoms and extrapulmonary complications are common among patients with respiratory virus infection [15], [16], [17], [18]. Renal failure is particularly common among patients with Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus infection [19], [20]. Myocardial infarction and stroke can be triggered by respiratory virus infection [12], [14], [21]. Hence, epidemiological studies excluding patients without symptoms or signs of respiratory tract infection may underestimate the true burden of respiratory virus infection.",

Second, we enrolled patients within 24 hours of hospitalization. The role of respiratory viruses for nosocomial complications should be further explored. Third, this study was conducted over a 1-month period during the influenza B winter season, and therefore the respiratory viruses detected in this study are not representative for the entire year. A long-term study should be conducted to capture the peak seasons of other respiratory viruses. Fourth, some patients in the non-fever/RS group may have prolonged viral shedding from a previous respiratory illness that occurred more than 7 days before admission. Finally, we studied acutely hospitalized patients, who would have more severe symptoms or complications when compared with patients seeking help in the community. Therefore, further studies should be performed at general practice in the community.",
