An overall good sign has been mortality rate (4.33%) which was lesser than the other pandemic diseases, and almost one third of the affected peoples were recovered (till March 23, 2020).7 Though fatality ratio was statistically less, the affected patients are increasing in the rate of multiplication; not by an addition. Thus, world governments should make consensus to eradicate the COVID-19 as much earlier, which will be helpful to save the poor population in all over the globe.",
