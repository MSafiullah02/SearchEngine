In the book, I show how we need about 10 quadrillion (1016) calculations per second (cps) to provide a functional equivalent to all the regions of the brain. Some estimates are lower than this by a factor of 100. Supercomputers are already at 100 trillion (1014) cps, and will hit 1016 cps around the end of this decade. Several supercomputers with 1 quadrillion cps are already on the drawing board, with two Japanese efforts targeting 10 quadrillion cps around the end of the decade.

He calls this \u2018the greatest revolution in thousands of years of history, but also the greatest revolution in billions of years of biology.\u2019 Harari, in Sapiens: A Brief History of Humankind writes about the many positive aspects of intelligent design13:The replacement of natural selection by intelligent design could happen in any of three ways. The first way is through biological engineering. Bio-designers could re-engineer the shapes, abilities and desires of organisms, in order to realize some preconceived cultural idea. There is nothing new about biological engineering, per se. People have been using selective breeding, castration and other forms of bio-engineering for at least 10,000 years. But recent advances in our understanding of how organisms work, down to the cellular and genetic levels, have opened up previously unimaginable possibilities. For example, scientists can today take a gene from a jellyfish that glows in a green florescent light, and implant it in a rabbit or a monkey, which starts glowing in a green florescent light. E. coli bacteria have been genetically engineered to produce human insulin and bio-fuel. A gene extracted from an arctic fish has been inserted into potatoes, making the plants more frost resistant.\n",

The second group, however, was taken back in time and surrounded by objects from the Fifties and asked to behave as if it really was 1959. Over the week, something astonishing happened. The men stopped using their walking sticks, they began to walk faster and their posture improved. What this experiment demonstrated is that as humans we are more than genes and brains. We have a collective consciousness. Pemberton is skeptical that computer code could replace medicine. \u201cComputers are a useful tool in treatment, but medicine is far too complex to be reduced to code,\u201d he says14.

This is what scientists refer to as the \u201cinternal model.\u201d However, if we were to ask a robot a few questions regarding the tennis ball, Graziano suggests that the conversation would go something like this18:We ask: \u2018What\u2019s there?\u2019It says: \u2018A ball.\u2019We ask: \u2018What are the properties of the ball?\u2019It says: \u2018It\u2019s green, it\u2019s round, it\u2019s at that location.\u2019 It can answer that because the robot contains that information.Now we ask: \u2018Are you aware of the ball?\u2019It says: \u2018Cannot compute.\u2019\n",

Neuroscientist Christof Koch, chief scientific officer at the Allen Institute for Brain Science, talks about the theory of panpsychism \u2013 put simply, we are just a mind (or soul) in a world of minds. This was a theory espoused by thinkers like Plato and Spinoza, only to be sidelined by modern society\u2019s quest for empiric science. But a failure to infuse computers with consciousness has reignited this debate. According to Koch, consciousness arises within any sufficiently complex, information-processing system and the solution to Singularity may lie in us being connected. In an interview with Wired magazine20 (rather appropriate, don\u2019t you think), he noted:The Internet contains about 10 billion computers, with each computer itself having a couple of billion transistors in its CPU. So the Internet has at least 1019 transistors, compared to the roughly 1000 trillion (or quadrillion) synapses in the human brain. That\u2019s about 10,000 times more transistors than synapses. But is the internet more complex than the human brain? It depends on the degree of integration of the Internet\u2026 For instance, our brains are connected all the time. On the Internet, computers are packet-switching. They\u2019re not connected permanently, but rapidly switch from one to another\u2026\n",
