A thorough description of the seizure as well as duration, frequency, and the presence or absence of interictal abnormalities are vital to formulate a diagnostic plan. An initial minimum database should include a complete blood count, chemistry panel, blood pressure measurement, urinalysis, and testing for feline leukemia virus (FeLV) and feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV). Thoracic radiographs, abdominal ultrasonography, echocardiography, bile acid assessment, and thyroid testing may all be part of the workup, depending on the results of the physical examination, history, and preliminary testing. If a metabolic or systemic cause is ruled out through the preliminary workup, advanced imaging and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis is indicated. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is the most reliable imaging modality for the diagnosis of structural diseases of the brain on account of its superior anatomic detail.4, 34\n",

For example, cats with known or suspected increased intracranial pressure may be at high risk of brain herniation, either of the cerebrum under the tentorium cerebelli or of the brain stem and cerebellum through the foramen magnum. Many patients with neurologic disease are poor anesthetic candidates, and clinicians should carefully consider the risk-to-benefit ratio, as well as take special precautions in anesthetizing these cases. Ketamine is considered relatively unsafe in patients with disorders of the brain because of its potential to increase intracranial pressure, whereas propofol is relatively safe as an induction agent. An adequate plane of anesthesia is vital to prevent movement of the patient during the spinal tap. Intubation and supplemental oxygen are indicated in most cases to maintain the airway and provide inhalant anesthesia if necessary.",

The author suggests checking PB levels approximately 10 days after initiation of therapy or after a change in dose, as well as every 4 months along with a complete blood count, chemistry panel, and assessment of bile acids.

Muscle biopsies may reveal pathologic changes, particularly with glycogen storage diseases, and peripheral nerve biopsies are advocated in the diagnosis of GCL.125 Urine metabolic screening is available (Josephine Deubler Genetic Disease Testing Laboratory, University of Pennsylvania) to identify the presence of urinary excretory products, with characteristic excretory profiles being described for specific diseases.125 A definitive means of diagnosing a storage disease is through the use of lysosomal enzyme analysis, in which activity of select lysosomal enzymes in the affected cat are measured against an age-matched control. Affected animals typically have 0% to 5% of the normal activity of the enzyme in question, whereas carrier animals have approximately 50% of normal activity.125 Molecular genetic testing will become increasingly available in the coming years as another means of diagnosing this group of disorders; currently, DNA testing is available only for MPS 6 in cats.125\n",

Typical findings on MRI (Figure 27-3\n) include varying degrees of ventricular dilation, reduction of periventricular white matter, expansion of the cranial cavity, and loss of cortical bone.",

Neurologic deficits are symmetric and nonprogressive in nature.34 Depending on severity of disease, an affected kitten can have a good quality of life, provided adequate measures are taken to prevent injury from falling and to keep it indoors. This disorder is best prevented by vaccinating queens before pregnancy.34 Although similar clinical signs are seen in cats with cerebellar abiotrophy, the two disorders can be readily distinguished given that signs resulting from abiotrophy usually do not become apparent until several months to years of age and are progressive in nature.6\n",

A minimum database in any cat with suspected brain infarction should include a complete blood count, chemistry panel, FeLV and FIV testing, urinalysis, thyroid panel if applicable, coagulation profile if applicable, multiple blood pressure measurements, electrocardiogram, and possible thoracic radiographs and abdominal ultrasound. If cardiomyopathy is suspected, echocardiography should also be performed. Definitive diagnosis requires advanced imaging of the brain, with MRI considered the superior modality for detecting intracranial infarction (Figure 27-11\n). Findings may vary depending on the amount of time that has elapsed between the onset of the stroke and performance of imaging. Typical abnormalities noted on MRI include a focal, sharply demarcated lesion that is hyperintense on T2 and FLAIR images, hypointense on T1, with a discrete cutoff between normal and abnormal tissue.

Remember that while a thorough otoscopic exam is indicated in all patients presenting with suspected peripheral vestibular dysfunction, the presence of an intact tympanic membrane does not exclude middle ear infection. While the most common etiologic agents in cats are bacterial (e.g., Pseudomonas spp., Staphylococcus pseudointermedius), Cryptococcus infection has also been implicated in a number cats with OMI and an index of suspicion should be raised in cats living in endemic areas.8 Intracranial complications of OMI are well recognized and result from extension of organisms from the inner ear to the brainstem along the nerves and vessels of the internal acoustic meatus (Figure 27-15\n). This can result in severe, life-threatening disease requiring rapid surgical intervention and aggressive, long term medical management based on cultures obtained at the time of surgery.131\n",

Although surgical intervention may not always achieve complete resection of the mass, cytoreduction will alleviate clinical signs and allow for histopathologic confirmation of tumor type. In a retrospective study of 26 cats undergoing surgery alone for nonlymphoid vertebral and spinal cord neoplasms, the median survival times for malignant (e.g., osteosarcoma) and benign (e.g., meningioma) tumors were 110.5 and 518 days, respectively.111 In another report one cat with meningioma was alive 1400 days postoperatively, and another was alive 2190 days after resection of a nerve sheath neoplasm.78 Overall, it appears that surgical treatment, even when complete resection is not possible, will palliate clinical signs and may result in sustained quality of life. Data regarding radiation and chemotherapy are lacking in these feline patients, but studies in dogs suggest that one or both of these modalities may prolong MST in some cases.",

Intravenous administration of edrophonium chloride may temporarily ameliorate clinical signs, but the response of cats to this drug is less reliable than that in dogs.26 In addition to acetylcholine receptor antibody levels, the diagnostic workup should include thoracic radiographs, even in the absence of respiratory signs, on account of the high incidence of thymomas diagnosed in myasthenic cats as well as the potential for megaesophagus. In a retrospective report of 105 cases of acquired MG in cats, 27 of 105 (25.7%) were identified with thymoma. The incidence of megaesophagus is typically lower in cats with MG than it is in dogs because of the different distribution of skeletal muscle in the esophagus of the two species, but megaesophagus was still identified in 14.3% of myasthenic cats in the same study.117\n",

A facial droop is not as apparent in cats as it is in dogs. Corneal ulceration may be evident as a result of damage to the parasympathetic fibers responsible for tear production or exposure keratitis resulting from the inability to blink.5 On physical examination both the menace response and the palpebral reflex are absent, but sensation to the face remains intact. When it is a result of disease in the middle ear, facial paralysis may be accompanied by concurrent Horner's syndrome or vestibular signs. A minimum database should include a complete blood count, chemistry panel, otic exam, corneal fluorescein staining, and Schirmer tear test.

Penicillin G is considered the drug of choice, but amoxicillin\u2013clavulanic acid and metronidazole have also been reportedly effective.137 The benefit of tetanus antitoxin in cats remains uncertain insofar as there is too little information in the literature regarding its safety and efficacy. Supportive care depends on severity of signs, and cats severely affected may require muscle relaxants, physical therapy, bladder management, and nutritional assistance. Recovery can be prolonged, and periods lasting from several weeks to up to 5 months have been reported in affected cats before clinical resolution.105, 137\n",
