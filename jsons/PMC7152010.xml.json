Although the MARV genus contains a single species, the EBOV genus consists of five distinct species: Bundibugyo ebolavirus (BEBOV), C\u00f4te d'Ivoire ebolavirus (CIEBOV; also known as Ivory Coast ebolavirus), Reston ebolavirus (REBOV), Sudan ebolavirus (SEBOV), and Zaire ebolavirus (ZEBOV).4 Nucleotide and amino-acid differences between MARV and EBOV are each approximately 55%, and there is no serologic cross-reactivity between these viruses. In comparison, EBOV species show 37% to 41% differences in nucleotide and amino-acid sequences, and there are varying degrees of cross-reactivity among the EBOV species.",

Filovirus particles take on a variety of forms, from circular or \u201c6\u201d-shaped to prototypical straight filaments, for which the virus family is named (Fig. 166-1\n). Although the length of the virions is variable, MARV particles average close to 800 nm, and EBOV virions measure about 1 \u00b5M. The diameter of all filovirus particles uniformly measures about 80 nm.5 Filovirus particles contain an approximately 19-kb noninfectious genome that encodes seven structural proteins, with a gene order of 3\u2032 leader, nucleoprotein (NP), virion protein 35 (VP35), VP40, glycoprotein (GP), VP30, VP24, RNA-dependent RNA polymerase L protein, and 5\u2032 trailer. Four of these proteins are associated with the viral genomic RNA in the ribonucleoprotein complex: NP, VP30, VP35, and the L protein. Some proteins of the ribonucleoprotein complex have additional functions. For example, VP35 has been shown to act as an interferon antagonist.6 VP40 serves as the matrix protein and mediates particle formation, and in the case of MARV, it has also been shown to interfere with host innate immune responses.7 VP24 is another structural protein associated with the membrane and also interferes with interferon signaling for EBOV.8\n",

An important distinction of EBOV from MARV is that the MARV GP is encoded in a single open reading frame (ORF), whereas the EBOV GP is encoded in two ORFs.9, 10 The single MARV ORF translates into the structural surface GP. In contrast, the two EBOV ORFs are linked together by slippage of the L polymerase at an editing site (a string of seven consecutive template uracil residues) to insert an eighth uracil. This process results in the production of a messenger RNA (mRNA) transcript that permits read-through translation of full-length GP. However, only about 20% of the mRNA transcripts are edited and translated into structural surface GP. The remaining 80% of unedited mRNA transcripts result in the production of a truncated soluble GP (sGP) that is secreted in large quantities from infected cells. Although the function of sGP has not been fully elucidated, it has been postulated that sGP subverts the host immune response by both passively absorbing antibodies directed at the full-length structural GP11, 12 and by triggering the proliferation of B cells that preferentially bind sGP.13\n",

This outbreak was unique and complicated by the fact that it had multiple introductions of MARVs of different phylogenetic lineages and included strains that are thought to be more pathogenic (Angola)16, 17 than others. The largest and most lethal MARV outbreak to date occurred in 2004 to 2005 in northern Angola.16 This outbreak involved 252 cases, with a case-fatality rate of 90%. The epidemic was driven largely by nosocomial transmission; however, community-acquired infection was documented toward the end of the outbreak. Between 2007 and 2012, several small episodes of MARV HF were reported in Uganda, with one case being exported to the United States18 and one to the Netherlands.19\n",

These independent outbreaks involved serologically distinct species, ZEBOV and SEBOV. The ZEBOV outbreak consisted of 318 cases and 280 deaths (88% mortality), whereas the SEBOV outbreak involved 284 cases with 151 deaths (53% mortality). Since 1976, ZEBOV has appeared sporadically in Central Africa, causing several small- to midsize outbreaks between 1976 and 1979. In 1995, there was a large epidemic of ZEBOV HF involving 315 cases, with an 81% case-fatality rate, in Kikwit, a community in the DRC.22 Meanwhile, between 1994 and 1997, there were smaller outbreaks caused by ZEBOV in Gabon. Since 2000, there have been near-yearly occurrences of ZEBOV in Gabon, DRC, or the Republic of Congo. During 2014, ZEBOV outbreaks were reported for the first time in West Africa in the countries of Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone. The Central Africa outbreaks of ZEBOV have also involved a catastrophic decline in populations of great apes.23, 24 The largest EBOV outbreak on record involved 425 cases, with a 53% case-fatality rate.25 This outbreak occurred in 2000 to 2001 in Sudan and was caused by SEBOV. Smaller outbreaks of SEBOV have occurred in Sudan in 2004 and in Uganda in 2011 and 2012.",

Surveys to identify animal reservoirs and arthropod vectors have been aggressively undertaken in endemic areas, particularly after most large filovirus outbreaks. Until recently, these efforts have been unsuccessful. Ecologic studies in 2003 to 2006 in Gabon and the Republic of Congo demonstrated the initial evidence for the presence of ZEBOV in three different species of fruit bats.31 These studies showed the presence of viral RNA and antibodies, although the investigators were unable to isolate infectious ZEBOV. Subsequent studies in 2007, detecting MARV RNA and isolating infectious MARV from cave-dwelling fruit bats in Uganda, further support the view that bats may serve as a reservoir for filoviruses.32 More recently, antibodies against REBOV were detected in fruit bats in the Philippines.33 Although current data suggests a role for bats in maintaining filoviruses in nature, it remains unclear whether bats serve as the primary reservoir or whether other species are involved.",

However, in the setting of pathogens such as EBOV and MARV, which are indigenous to Africa and are also potential agents of bioterrorism, a single-injection vaccine is preferable. In the case of preventing natural infections, multiple-dose vaccines are both too costly and not practical (logistics and compliance) in developing countries. In the case of a deliberate release of these agents, there would be little time for deployment of a vaccine that requires multiple injections over an extended period of time. Thus, for most practical applications, a vaccine against the filoviruses necessitates a single immunization or, at the most, two injections within a very short time frame. Of the prospective filovirus vaccines, only two systems, one based on a replication-defective adenovirus serotype 5 and the other based on the recombinant vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV), have been shown to provide complete protection to nonhuman primates when administered as a single-injection vaccine.59, 60, 61\n",

However, many challenges remain before any of these vaccines will be ready for human use or even phase I clinical trials. Among the most significant obstacles are the identification of a seemingly more pathogenic strain of MARV (strain Angola) in 2004 to 2005 and the identification of a new species of EBOV, BEBOV, in 2007. Filovirus vaccine development has primarily focused on two EBOV species, SEBOV and ZEBOV, and one MARV strain (strain Musoke). However, recent studies have shown that current vaccines do not completely protect nonhuman primates from disease and death after challenge with BEBOV.62, 63 In addition, few vaccines have been evaluated against the seemingly most pathogenic Angola strain of MARV, which has been associated with 90% case-fatality rates in humans and has been shown to have a faster disease course in macaques than other MARV strains.16, 17\n",

            "text": "A number of postexposure treatments have shown promise in nonhuman primate models of filovirus infection. These include drugs that modulate coagulopathy, including inhibitors of the tissue factor pathway that improved survival in a macaque model of ZEBOV HF,69 as did drugs that treated protein C deficiency.70 Recombinant VSV-based vaccines have shown good results in nonhuman primates when administered shortly after challenge, with results ranging from 50% protection for ZEBOV71 to 100% protection for SEBOV72 and MARV.73, 74 RNA-based treatments, including small interfering RNAs75 and antisense oligonucleotides,76 have also shown the ability to confer protection against death for ZEBOV and MARV when given shortly after challenge. There has been considerable controversy regarding the use of antibody-based treatments. Early studies using convalescent blood,77 high-titer polyclonal equine IgG,78 and a human recombinant monoclonal antibody79 failed to show any beneficial effect against ZEBOV in nonhuman primates. However, more recent studies using purified polyclonal nonhuman primate IgG80 and pools of recombinant monoclonal antibodies81, 82 have demonstrated the ability to protect macaques from lethal MARV and/or ZEBOV infection. There are several differences in these current studies, including the specific reagents used, regimen of treatment, and challenge viruses used. Of importance, it is known that the early studies used a wild-type ZEBOV isolate that consisted of a high population of viruses containing a series of 7 consecutive uracils (7Us) at the GP gene editing site, meaning that this isolate produces normal amounts of sGP. In contrast, it is known that at least two of the more recent studies used a variant ZEBOV that contained high populations with an additional uracil residue in the GP gene editing site,83 meaning that at least in the early stages of replication, this virus did not produce as much sGP as wild-type ZEBOV. Future studies will need to more fully assess the potential of antibody-based therapies against the seemingly more pathogenic wild-type \u201c7U\u201d ZEBOV isolates.",
