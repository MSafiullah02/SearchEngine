Moreover, DM increased the risk of mortality during the infection. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first meta-analysis considering the DM in COVID-19 infection. Surely, DM s generally associated with a poor prognosis in infective disease [17] [18] [19] [20] , but a direct demonstration of this aspect in COVID-19 patients, until now, has been only reported in isolated reports [13] [14] [15] [16] and never analysed comprehensively. However, whether DM increased the risk of infection due to COVID-SARS-19 remains an unresolved question to date and will require further clarification by specific studies. However, current data seems to indicate that diabetic patients, as would be expected, have an higher risk of complications, as demonstrated by the ore frequent admission to ICU [9] [10] [11] [12] . This aspect results confirmed by our preliminary results indicating an increased risk to be admitted to ICU and the poorer outcome of these subgroup of patients. However, published data did not allow us to examine the type of DM, the length of the disease, presence of related complications, type of treatment and glycaemic controls during the infection or in the previous month. However the lack of data in this phase of the pandemia is understandable since in many regions physicians are doing a \"frontline\" medicine, where the time to collect records is very limited. Recently. some investigations have focused their attention to the risk of infection in diabetic subjects [20, 21] . Despite the prevention of the infection remains the primary concern, also the comprehension of the course of the disease has a pivotal role, especially in different subset of patients, as the diabetics. Indeed, if the most critical issues related to the deterioration of the disease will be identify, a potential vulnerability score could be created in order to understand who of these patients will benefit from a more aggressive treatment from the beginning, to limit the complications rate. In this regard, DM resulted the most common comorbidities in most of cohorts presenting data of COVID-19 patients, generally after HT [22, 23] . Whether this aspect could be related with baseline characteristics of the population or represents a real \"risk factor\" will require further investigations in different areas of the world. In the meanwhile, due the absence of a specific viral treatment, diabetic patients should be considered to be at higher risk of poor prognosis and/or need for intensive support. These aspects could be helpful to orient the current clinical approach to COVID-19 patients.",
