A number of these have a predilection for infecting and for being especially severe in the immunocompromised host [2] [3] [4] . Because of this, prevention is extremely important for patients with neoplastic disease and immune defects associated with the neoplasm or its therapy. Immune defects can be categorized as indicated in Table 1 .1 [5] and they are discussed extensively in other chapters. This chapter will stress the prevention of zoonoses in patients with neoplastic disease including those who appear to have intact immune responses for that may change with progression of disease or future chemotherapy or irradiation. It must be stressed that pets are extremely important to most humans and often especially to those who are ill. They provide companionship or they can be the objects of biological interest and study. Nonhuman animals provide occupations for large numbers of humans. Contact with various species can result in infections, however, and these can be especially severe in patients with immune defects. There are far too many examples to be included in this chapter, thus the most common will be discussed along with some of the rarer examples, which may be emerging infections and therefore of particular interest.
