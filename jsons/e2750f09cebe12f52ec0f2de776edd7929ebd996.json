Early in her career, she carried out studies that defined the diagnosis, epidemiology, transmission, and therapy of RSV bronchiolitis in children [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] . Later, when HHV6 was identified as the cause of roseola, she initiated studies that defined the clinical spectrum of HHV6 infection, and she attempted to understand the relationship between chromosomal integration and vertical transmission of the virus [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] [26] . At the same time, few pediatric pathogens escaped her focus and interest, and Dr. Hall contributed and collaborated on many works concerning group A streptococci, parainfluenza and influenza viruses, coronaviruses, rhinoviruses, human metapneumovirus, rotaviruses, and noroviruses [27] [28] [29] [30] [31] [32] [33] [34] [35] [36] [37] [38] .",

She was a founding member of the Pediatric Infectious Diseases Society (PIDS), its fifth president and Society Historian, and she also served for many years on the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) Committee on Infectious Diseases (Red Book Committee) and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices. Caren was often sought out to serve on the most important national committees, including those of the Institute of Medicine, the National Academy of Science, Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA), AAP, PIDS, Society for Healthcare Epidemiology of America (SHEA), and other professional societies. She was the recipient of numerous distinguished awards from professional organizations including PIDS, IDSA, and the Pan American Society of Virology, among others.",

Plotkin, Emeritus Professor, University of Pennsylvania, Executive Advisor, Sanofi Pasteur, and Principal of VaxConsult, LLC; Dr. Plotkin was accompanied by his wife and partner in VaxConsult, vaccine historian Susan Plotkin. Dr. Plotkin's review updated some of his past sage comments, touching upon those infections eradicated from the globe (smallpox and rinderpest), those with ongoing struggles for elimination or control (eg, poliomyelitis, measles, rubella), and those still to be successfully prevented by vaccination (eg, human immunodeficiency virus [HIV], dengue, malaria) [39] [40] [41] [42] [43] [44] [45] [46] . He characterized the key problems in vaccinology as being those \"transvaccinology\" or \"pathogen-specific\" in nature. Problems in transvaccinology are those applicable to the development of many vaccines-these include (with examples of each) the ability of pathogens to be variable and escape immune responses (influenza virus, HIV); the host's short-lived effector memory to a vaccine or vaccine candidate ( pertussis); the difficulty in both finding and inducing the correct functional response (antibody vs cellmediated immunity) in the host (HIV, RSV); and population-specific challenges in vaccine epidemiology (variable epidemiology of rotavirus and meningococcal serotypes across the globe). Challenges that are classified as pathogen-specific include (1) the lack of identification of either useful correlates of protection (dengue, tuberculosis) or (2) the antigens required for generation of mechanistic or nonmechanistic correlates of protection (cytomegalovirus, tuberculosis, malaria). Dr. Plotkin also fondly recalled his decades-long personal and professional friendship with Dr. Hall. A Roundtable discussion was next led by long-time colleagues of Dr. Hall from both academia and the Rochester pediatric community, including Drs. John Treanor (URMC Internal Medicine Infectious Diseases Unit), Peter Szilagyi (URMC General Academic Pediatrics), Larry Nazarian (Panorama Pediatrics, Rochester), Anne Francis (Elmwood Pediatrics, Rochester), and R. Gordon Douglas (formerly, URMC Internal Medicine). Many participants in the audience also related their stories of Caren Hall's mentorship and friendship, including her habit of personally addressing a colleague (no matter where they were in the world) with a timely birthday congratulation often illustrated by an original drawing or poem.",

Dr. Tasnee Chonmaitree (University of Texas Medical Branch-Galveston) discussed her studies of otitis media bacteriology and virology, which began with training in Rochester by Dr. Hall [57] [58] [59] [60] [61] . Dr. Allison Kempe (University of Colorado School of Medicine) recalled how Dr. Hall taught her the lessons of translational research long before it was named as such, and she reviewed her ongoing studies of vaccine delivery in the community [62] [63] [64] [65] [66] . Dr. Thomas Evans (Aeras; formerly URMC Infectious Diseases Unit) described the pitfalls and promises of small molecule antiviral drug discovery. Dr. John McBride (Northeastern Ohio Medical University-Akron, formerly URMC Pediatric Pulmonology) summarized the physiology of RSV bronchiolitis and its relationship to asthma, and he provided some of his favorite recollections of working with Dr. Hall on the initial clinical ribavirin RSV treatment trials [67] [68] [69] [70] [71] [72] . Dr. Larry Anderson (Emory University, formerly CDC) discussed the quest for a safe and effective RSV vaccine [73, 74] .",
