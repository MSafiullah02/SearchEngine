With this research, we aim to document some of the many unusual consumer behavior patterns that came to dominate the early days of the COVID-19 pandemic. Our intention is exploratory, with an eye toward providing insights based on theory that can inform future researchers as well as marketing practitioners. We examine both the more transient consumer behaviors that may retreat once the pandemic passes, as well as the more transformative behaviors that may come to dominate our society for years or generations to come.",

Nonetheless, throughout history, pandemics, from the black plague in the middle ages to the Spanish Flu in the early 20th century, have wrought enormous social change (Reeves, Carlsson-Szlezak, Whitaker, & Abraham, 2020) and it is likely that the COVID-19 pandemic will do the same. Further, scientists suggest that new pandemics will continue to pose a risk in the future (Global Preparedness Monitoring Board, 2019). Therefore, understanding consumers\u2019 lives in the face of this pandemic and beyond is vitally important for marketers as well as business and public policy makers more broadly.",

Specifically, we propose that as consumers become aware of the potential for a pandemic, they first react by attempting to defend against perceived threats and regain control of lost freedoms. As time passes, they cope by exerting control in other domains and adopting new behaviors. Eventually, consumers adapt over time by becoming less reactive and more resilient. Using this structure, we document a variety of reacting and coping consumer behaviors observed anecdotally and in the popular press, and suggest theories that may help explain and predict these behaviors and associated outcomes. We further explore ways in which the COVID-19 pandemic may be serving as a catalyst for consumers\u2019 longer-term adaptive responses. While by no means comprehensive, it is our hope that this research can provoke analysis and discussion, serving as a starting point for consumer behavior researchers as well as marketing practitioners.",

Those sounding alarms were frequently viewed as extreme survivalist \u201cpreppers\u201d who were bound to stock up for any threat, large or small (Austin, 2020). However, a wave of preparedness buying at the end of February and early March quickly evolved into extreme buying with an 845% spike in consumer household spending (NCSolutions, 2020); a level which could not be met by suppliers, leading to empty shelves, stock-outs and product scarcity. Shoppers quickly cleared the shelves of all manner of disinfectant and cleaning products, toilet paper, and even water (NCSolutions, 2020). Whereas some of these goods, such as toilet paper, are often hoarded at first signs of a natural disaster (Kaigo, 2012), cleaning products might be more unique to a pandemic. What kinds of products consumers hoarded in the COVID-19 pandemic, and why, are interesting questions for researchers, especially given scientists\u2019 view of the likelihood of either another wave of COVID-19 or of future pandemics.",

            "text": "Hoarding behavior (as distinct from compulsive hoarding; Frost & Gross, 1993) is defined as the act of collecting and safeguarding a large quantity of possessions (i.e. more than is required for present needs) for future use (Chu, 2018). Hoarding behavior has an evolutionary basis and is instinctual when a threat is perceived (Frost & Gross, 1993). It is motivated by fear of being caught unprepared (Frost & Gross, 1993) and is heightened following an adverse event due to an increase in risk-aversion (Cameron & Shah, 2015) and anticipated regret (Gupta & Gentry, 2019). Further, according to psychological reactance theory (Clee & Wicklund, 1980), a threat to product availability is experienced by consumers as a loss of control and increases the perceived need for the threatened object. Possession, therefore, restores this loss of control and contributes to a sense of security and comfort (Frost & Hartl, 1996). Thus, while some degree of hoarding might be warranted for preparedness, consumers also engage in hoarding beyond what is needed as an emotional reactance response (Sneath, Lacey, & Kennett-Hensel, 2009).",

Product scarcity is another reactance-inducing environmental cue (Fitzsimons & Lehmann, 2004). Consumers are accustomed to the availability of a large assortment of products from a wide variety of retailers. Product scarcity threatens the freedom to choose from among these assortments (Gupta & Gentry, 2019) and empty shelves make this threat highly visible (Robinson, Brady, Lemon, & Giebelhausen, 2016). Therefore, if the scarce items are perceived to be important and the threat of continued availability high, consumers will seek to restore control by hoarding. Scarcity also may cause consumers to adopt a competitive mindset in which they see others seeking these goods as adversaries, leading to territorial behavior (Kirk, Peck, & Swain, 2018). In the early buying frenzy periods, this was reflected in aggressive behaviors exhibited by some consumers in order to win out over the competition (Impelli, 2020).",

During the pandemic, retailers often began limiting purchases of in-demand items to one per customer per day, perhaps giving consumers more confidence that product choices would be there when they need them. Keeping empty store shelves stocked with substitute products (e.g. facial tissues for toilet paper or soap for disinfectant) might also help to avoid cuing scarcity, thus dampening consumers\u2019 reactance responses. In response to stock-outs, consumers are also more likely to pay attention to the supply and demand of goods (Ge, Messinger, & Li, 2009), so even providing consumers with information regarding anticipated deliveries may help restore their sense of control. These areas suggest opportunities for future research into pandemic-related hoarding behavior.",

The manner and source of communications, paradoxically, can motivate either adherence or rejection. Recommendations from a recognized expert are usually an effective means of persuasion (Fitzsimons & Lehmann, 2004). However, if consumers perceive that a recommendation is contrary to their current beliefs, they may perceive a threat to their attitudinal and behavioral freedoms, leading to a state of psychological reactance (Fitzsimons & Lehmann, 2004). In this case, consumers may reject the recommendation, despite any benefits it may offer. In particular, when recommendations employ fear inducing messages, commonly used in public health campaigns, they may induce individuals to behave in direct opposition to what has been recommended (Shen, 2010). Some COVID-19 related campaigns in other countries, such as Australia\u2019s viral plea by medical personnel to stay home so they can work (Adomaite & Tymulis, 2020), were more other-focused than fear-inducing and may have been more effective.

One of the hallmarks of social distancing practices was \u201csheltering in place,\u201d or stay-at-home orders. However, the need to belong is one of the most fundamental human motivations (Baumeister & Leary, 1995) and consumers showed remarkable innovativeness and resiliency in order to meet this need. For example, when the virus made self-quarantining obligatory, many people chose to abandon their own homes in order to shelter in place with friends or family members, giving rise to the term \u201cquaranteaming\u201d (Hohman, 2020). Social exclusion also increases perceptions of physical vulnerability (Dean, Wentworth, & LeCompte, 2019), so hunkering down with others \u2013 perhaps even with relative strangers (Walton, Cohen, Cwir, & Spencer, 2012) \u2013 can be especially comforting when faced with the physical threat of a virus.",

Despite emerging touch capabilities in virtual reality (Needleman, 2018), it is unlikely that humans\u2019 positive responses to interpersonal touch (Luangrath, Peck, & Gustafsson, 2020) will be replaced virtually anytime soon. Further, when video chatting, consumers may see not only the others in the group, but also an image of themselves, possibly increasing stress due to self-presentation concerns (Wegge, 2006). Consumers also report \u201cZOOM fatigue,\u201d which might result from cognitive challenges associated with this less natural communication technology. Chatting via video (vs. in person) requires more attention to the faces on the screen and the cognitive load of trying to see and interpret nonverbal cues in this restricted environment (Ferran & Watts, 2008) may be exhausting. The conversation flow is also less natural, as the technology does not permit everyone to hear multiple consumers speaking simultaneously. Research has also shown that individuals may also misattribute brief system delays or other technical glitches to a communication partner, thereby affecting their perception of the other\u2019s behaviors and personality (Schoenenberg, Raake, & Koeppe, 2014).",

Another phenomenon seems to be a need for reconnecting with people from our past during the pandemic (Firth, 2020) especially through video chats, and the reasons for this are not clear. It is possible this is due to a sense of nostalgia (Xinyue, Wildschut, Sedikides, Kan, & Cong, 2014) or increased mortality salience (Dunn, White, & Dahl, 2020), and this should be examined. Even so, hedonic motivations aside, consumers might also feel pressured to join a group video chat with friends or relatives since everyone knows they are home. This might impact their sense of autonomy and dampen pleasurable responses from using the technology. Further research examining use of video chatting technology in social contexts is much needed.",

For example, Duchenne smiles, which crinkle the corners of the eyes, convey intrinsic motivation (Cheng, Mukhopadhyay, & Williams, 2020) and should be visible even when the mouth is covered. Other body language or prosody (Frick, 1985) may also be needed to avoid miscommunication. One could imagine a market for face coverings that provide protection yet are transparent enough to keep facial expressions visible. At the same time, many consumers are starting to treat fabric face masks as an expressive accessory by acquiring or making them of specialized fabrics in identity-relevant colors or patterns. Unfortunately, consumers of color, especially men, have reported additional concerns since face coverings can play into racial biases and may be viewed as threatening. Such consumers have reported selecting humorous masks to deescalate potential tension (Jingnan, 2020).",

While potentially frustrating at first glance, it is possible that such potential external attributions for imperfect outcomes help grant consumers license to fail in their efforts, thereby actually increasing their likelihood of engaging in prosumption activities.

Thus, it is also possible that as consumers come to take ownership of new prosumption contexts in their homes, territoriality (Kirk et al., 2018) may also come into play. For example, in a household with traditional gender-defined roles, the wife may typically have cooked for the family, or the husband handled home-improvement projects, and therefore view such domains as \u201ctheirs.\u201d Such psychological ownership may lead to territorial responses, such as denigration or knowledge hiding (Kirk, 2017) even within family units.

Telemedicine played a particularly important role since some patients contracted the virus while seeking medical treatment and many physicians\u2019 offices were closed due to shelter in place measures (Thompson, 2020). As a result, telemedicine has not been able to keep up with demand and will likely to continue to grow (Olson, 2020).",

Thus new technologies and practices are emerging which will help detect signs of illness so individuals can take appropriate measures to avoid infecting others. For example, thermal screening is being considered as a front line tool to detect those with elevated temperatures. It is conceivable that in order to enter a mall, store or other establishment, individuals will go through a screening device preventing those who are potentially ill from entering. Eventually, this practice could extend to wearables, whereby these diagnostics are available for every individual 24/7. A second tool gaining traction is the establishment of an alert system through smart phone tracking technology. Already in widespread use in Australia and Singapore (CBS, 2020b), this technology identifies and alerts individuals who have come in close contact with someone who is potentially contagious. Currently, numerous ad hoc efforts are taking place using GPS and Bluetooth technologies with few security measures in place to protect data privacy. Google and Apple are working together to create software that allows different apps to work together taking security and privacy into account (Valentino-DeVries, Singer, & Krolik, 2020). A third, less technology-dependent strategy, is the institution of drive-through testing centers which are currently make-shift uses of parking lots (CBS, 2020a) but may be more institutionalized in the future.",

            "text": "Looking forward, these tradeoffs between privacy and public health monitoring could become especially consequential in light of predictions that digital identity may become as commonplace, consequential, and indelible as a credit score (Botsman, 2017, Rifkin et al., 2020). The amount and sensitive nature of the data necessary to enact these measures is alarming and experts warn that health information is not adequately protected with current regulations. In fact, once the data leaves the health system, protections no longer fall within the jurisdiction of Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA), leaving consumers extremely vulnerable (Gostin, Halabi, & Wilson, 2018). Facebook, Google, Twitter and other marketers would therefore be free to use and sell acquired data points with limited oversight (Gostin et al., 2018). These data could be combined with other consumer information which is tracked at the most granular level utilizing powerful data-mining tools and then sold to untold parties (Singer, 2020). The United States is the exception to other developed countries in that it does not have a comprehensive consumer protections law nor independent agency oversight for the regulation of data usage or privacy (Singer, 2020). The risks of this lack of oversight become apparent when considering current practices in China which some have referred to as Orwellian (Gandini, 2019). The Chinese government, in partnership with industry, recently instituted a \u201cChinese citizen score,\u201d which utilizes artificial intelligence, surveillance footage, customer transactional data and other digital footprints to reward and punish individuals based on unspecified criteria (Botsman, 2017). Over and above the citizen score, the government requires residents to download a health code app which dictates which residents must be under a mandatory quarantine and then can use the GPS function to ensure compliance (Valentino-DeVries et al., 2020). This reveals the potential power of these data capabilities and foreshadows the consequences of the trade-off of tolerating privacy and surveillance for safety. While the efforts in the United States are not as overt, the frequency and severity of data protection failures in the United States gives reason to pause (Singer, 2020). However, given the life and death consequences of COVID-19 tracking, it is likely that the balance between safety and surveillance will lean further towards the former (Valentino-DeVries et al., 2020).",

Originally conceptualized as an outcome of war, moral injury occurs when individuals experience, bear witness to, or learn about egregious transgressions which are incompatible with their own morality and expectations (Litz et al., 2009). Numerous realities during the COVID-19 pandemic defied expectations beyond imagination. Among the most serious transgressions were individuals left to die alone while loved ones were forced to stay away, medical personnel compelled to choose who would and would not receive life-saving treatment, and families precluded from carrying out funerals and other rituals related to the grieving process due to social distancing. First responders and other essential workers were worn out as they risked their own health and those of their families, while many others were furloughed or unemployed. As individuals sought to protect their own interests, often helping the most vulnerable populations took a back seat, with perhaps the exception of the emptying out of animal shelters. Individuals will need to come to terms with their own behaviors such as shaming and being shamed. Further, many have questioned whether those in authority could have mitigated the negative outcomes if they acted collectively, sooner, better, more efficiently and so on. The moral ambiguities raised during this period are profound. Accordingly, the likelihood of experiencing agentic moral injury through sins of omission or commission or receptive moral injury by becoming the target of, bearing witness to or learning about immorality of others (Litz, Lebowitz, Gray, & Nash, 2017) is extremely high. Depending on how profoundly it is experienced, moral injury contains the power to shape self-identity and world outlook with implications for marketers. It remains to be seen how these reshaped world views will be formed by consumers\u2019 positive characteristics such as greater empathy, tolerance, interconnectedness and resilience, and negative ones such as bitterness, insularity, and defeat.",

This is not a new phenomenon in that throughout history, scholars have questioned the distinction between fantasy and reality (Mattessich, 2003). For example, where would one cross the line in Disney\u2019s Magic Kingdom in comparison to the lights of Times Square in New York City, or a planned community (F\u0131rat & Dholakia, 2006)? It has been suggested that the current reality is merely a simulation constructed by past human agency (Baudrillard and Foss, 1983, F\u0131rat and Dholakia, 2006). The potential for reality and fantasy to be indistinguishable, however, becomes much greater with the sophistication of AI and other technological innovations, which will enable computers and robots to replicate human qualities linguistically, physically, intellectually and emotionally (Belk, 2019, Belk, 2020). Robots and humans will become interchangeable as they take on anthropomorphized personas capable of satisfying both physical and emotional needs (Belk, 2019).

Will virtual experiences seem more attractive than enduring the risks and hassles of world travel?

For example, the economic and financial impacts are already devastating for many consumers, often forcing them into modern-day versions of depression-era breadlines for the first time in their lives just to feed their families (Meyerson, 2020). The disastrous economic effects are hitting women and minority populations the hardest, because they have fewer assets to enable them to weather the storm, and because they are less likely to hold white-collar jobs that can be done remotely (Knowledge@Wharton, 2020). School and daycare center closings have made the pandemic especially devastating for women with young children who need day care (Alon, Deopke, Olmstead-Rumsey, & Tertilt, 2020). Even the health effects of COVID-19 are disproportionately affecting minority populations in the U.S., for reasons that are still emerging (CDC, 2020). We have also not discussed the outpouring of prosocial behavior and gratitude for front-line workers on display by consumers every day. Consumers are donating blood and opening their homes, risking their lives as volunteers, and across the world, thanking healthcare workers by singing from their balconies, applauding, and honking horns (Snouwaert, 2020).",

Other topics we have not addressed here include demographic, cultural and other individual differences, all of which will become interesting and important topics for future research. For example, the ability and motivation of elders to adapt to new technologies, such as video chat, in order to remain connected with their families seems notable. It is also likely that countries with stay-at-home orders may experience a bit of a baby boomlet nine months afterward.

In this research, we have documented some of the consumer behavior patterns characteristic of the early days of the COVID-19 pandemic, some of which may foreshadow changes that will ultimately revolutionize life as we know it. Taking an environmentally-imposed constraints perspective, we have offered insights based on theory to help understand these behaviors in order to inform future research and marketing practice. We have addressed consumer behaviors in each of three phases: reacting (e.g., hoarding and rejecting), coping (e.g. maintaining social connectedness, do-it-yourself behaviors, changing views of brands) and longer-term adapting (e.g. potentially transformative changes in consumption and individual and social identity). Although the economic and research opportunities are unlimited, we suggest just a few areas as a starting point:\u2022How will virtual and remote consumer experiences reset consumer expectations, wants and needs for future engagement?\u2022How will consumers shift their lifestyle and consumption priorities (e.g. greater work life balance, more or less emphasis on trivialities, desire for greater independence or interdependence)?\u2022How will the psychological factors which arise from COVID-19 (e.g. fear, anxiety, moral injury, empathy, gratitude, even pride) impact consumers\u2019 attitudes and behaviors?\u2022How will psychological contracts between consumers and institutions evolve?\u2022What balance will consumers and society embrace between security and privacy?\n",
