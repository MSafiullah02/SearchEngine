The possibility of influenza pandemics is always a concern, but this zoonotic jump seemed particularly worrisome because the case fatality rate (CFR) was approximately 60%. Fortunately, the virus did not acquire mammalian transmissibility, and there were no confirmed examples of human-to-human spread. Nevertheless, there was great concern that if the virus did acquire human transmissibility and maintained such a high CFR, the world could face a public health emergency of unprecedented danger. For comparison, the CFR during the 1918 influenza epidemic , which many believe to be the worst influenza pandemic in history, was approximately 2.5%.",

The NSABB delved into the dual-use controversy early in its tenure when the US government asked it to review the paper describing the reconstruction of the influenza virus strain responsible for the 1918 epidemic [1]. Although the NSABB voted to recommend publication, the editor of Science made it clear that the journal would have published the article irrespective of the NSABB vote unless the paper was classified [2]. For the next half decade, the NSABB struggled with the problem of how to deal with dual-use research in the biological sciences and proposed identifying a small subset of science known as \u201cdual-use research of concern,\u201d or DURC, as that domain on which to focus efforts.",

Research groups led by Yoshi Kawaoka in the USA and Ron Fouchier in the Netherlands took similar approaches albeit with different starting strains, first engineering the ability of the virus to bind to human receptors and then serially passaging it through ferrets. Both obtained the same answer: the H5N1 virus could attain the ability to be transmitted via respiratory droplets. They wrote manuscripts and submitted them for publication in Nature and Science, respectively [3, 4]. In late 2011 the NSABB had the opportunity to evaluate its policies and recommendations when the US government learned of the two submitted manuscripts describing these high pathogenicity avian influenza viruses (HPAIV ) that had been made mammalian transmissible: it asked the NSABB to advise it whether publication was wise given potential biosecurity concerns. The details of the deliberations of the NSABB and its ultimate decision to recommend publication have been described in detail elsewhere, but briefly, the NSABB determined that the benefits of the research outweighed the biosecurity risks [5]. Hence, the first round of the controversy was focused primarily on biosecurity issues.",

These laboratory incidents received a high degree of public attention, spearheaded by the reporting of Alison Young at USA Today. This conjunction of laboratory accidents together with additional follow-up publications [e.g., 6] puts the H5N1 story in a new light, namely, whether similar experiments in which new phenotypes are added to pathogens, gain-of-function (GOF) studies, could be conducted safely and whether they should be pursued at all. Confronted with a public outcry combined with a serious scientific debate on the benefits and risks of GOF-type experiments, in 2014 the NIH, which has administrative responsibility for the NSABB, imposed a moratorium on US-funded GOF experiments with \u201cpathogens of pandemic potential (PPP),\u201d those being influenza virus, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus (SARS-CoV), and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) coronavirus (MERS-CoV ). While SARS-CoV had disappeared from the human population due to a highly successful public health containment endeavor, the MERS-CoV outbreak had emerged in the Middle East and was (and still is) ongoing at the time. The US government also charged the NSABB with making recommendations about the future of GOF research (https://www.phe.gov/s3/dualuse/Documents/gain-of-function.pdf). We have summarized the events of 2014 in a series of papers, and those details will not be recounted here [7, 8]. Instead, our focus will be to make the case for the scientific and moral value of GOF-type research provided that it can be conducted safely. Hence, the second round of the controversy was focused less on biosecurity and intentional release and almost entirely on biosafety.",

            "text": "We have previously argued that the H5N1 experiments, and similar GOF studies, provide benefits at many levels, from the practical to the epistemological [9, 10]. Some tangible benefits of GOF studies involving influenza virus include:The results of GOF experiments can be definitive. For example, the 2012 GOF studies showing that HPAIV could acquire the capacity for mammalian transmissibility established that these influenza viruses had the biological capacity to emerge as a contagious human pathogen. Prior to these studies, it was not clear whether the absence of human transmissibility in the isolated cases of HPAIV was a result of a biological limitation in the ability of the virus to be mammalian transmissible or just a stochastic effect such that the necessary mutations had not occurred. The 2012 GOF studies unequivocally established the capacity of these HPAIV for mammalian transmission, which in turn implies pandemic potential. To our knowledge there are no other experiments or analysis that could have provided such definitive information. Hence, these experiments provide a warning to humanity of the dangers posed by these HPAIV strains and suggest that similar dangers lurk in other influenza strains. In this regard, similar experiments have shown that H7N1 has the capacity of mammalian transmissibility [11], extending the threat horizon to H7 viruses.The results of GOF experiments can inform on important biological questions. For example, GOF experiments yielded mutants that when analyzed showed that higher and lower pH optima for the hemagglutinin were associated with enhanced virulence in birds and mammals, respectively [12]. This information is important for knowing how influenza viruses jump from birds to humans, which is a critical step in the emergence of new pandemic strains.GOF experiments can be used to produce new viral strains to improve vaccine production. One of the hurdles in vaccine preparation is the adaptation and growth of vaccination strains in eggs for efficient production. GOF-type of experiments can be used to identify mutations that facilitate replication of influenza strains in eggs, and this information could facilitate vaccine production [13].\n",

At the time of publication, the authors and others argued that the results would inform surveillance efforts and vaccine development. It is unclear to us how much surveillance has benefitted although the mutation information has been used in monitoring [14, 15]. As we and others have pointed out, there is a danger of focusing on the exact mutations discovered in the ferret experiments because there may be other genetic routes to human transmissibility [10]. Some have noted that by the time such mutations have been detected in avian populations, it might be too late to stop the spread due to the relative rates with which we can identify those mutations using current technology and the rate of spread of influenza virus [16, 17]. Increased awareness of the threat of H5N1, however, must certainly have led to better isolation of patients who have been exposed to the virus. In this regard, it seems reasonable to assume that any onward transmission of an avian strain would occur largely in the healthcare setting, as has been the case with SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, and rapid intervention could prevent a widespread outbreak.",

            "text": "While monitoring the mutations discovered in the laboratory from GOF experiments is not sufficient to predict dangers from environmental isolates, it is important to note that while both groups obtained viruses with different mutations, they both achieved similar phenotypes of enhanced stability of the HA protein . As our ability to predict phenotype from genotype improves, this becomes increasingly important. A big caveat to overstating the importance of this, however, is the contribution of epistasis to any given phenotype. For example, the same mutations identified by the Fouchier group, when introduced into a different H5N1 background, yielded a different HA phenotype [18]. This implies that insights gained from one set of mutations in one strain are unlikely to be generalizable to other strains given sequence differences. Hence, with the hindsight of half a decade of work since the original controversy in 2012, it appears that GOF-type experiments are very informative with regard to big questions such as whether mammalian virulence and transmissibility potential exists in HPAIV but may be less useful in making fine-scale molecular predictions.",

To the best of our knowledge, US-supported experiments to examine changes in transmission of avian influenza viruses have largely stopped. The Fouchier lab did publish a follow-up report to their original Science manuscript in which they narrowed down the exact mutations that enabled transmission in the ferret model, but based on the publication date, it appears that this work was completed prior to the moratorium [19]. In the MERS-CoV field, the development of a small animal model that faithfully reproduces human transmission and disease has been slowed significantly by the moratorium. MERS-CoV uses the dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4) protein as a receptor, and the human and murine proteins differ enough such that the virus cannot use the mouse molecule. Transgenic mice that express human DPP4 ubiquitously experience a broader set of symptoms than do humans when infected with wild-type MERS-CoV [20\u201323]. This problem was recently overcome by developing a transgenic mouse expressing a mutant DPP4 in which two key amino acids were mutated from the mouse allele to the human allele. However, the authors still needed to passage the virus through these transgenic mice to derive a GOF variant that recapitulated human disease [24]. This GOF virus was subsequently used to show the efficacy of a promising nucleotide prodrug, originally initially developed for Ebola virus, for treating MERS [25]. Continuing efforts to produce a mouse-adapted MERS-CoV in wild-type mice have been prohibited [26; R. Baric, personal communication].",

The difficulty lies largely in trying to apply quantitative risk assessment measures to the problem. The benefits of all biological research, not just GOF research, often do not make themselves apparent until years or even decades after the experiments are performed. On the other hand, the risks, even when theoretical, manifest themselves in the present when the experimentation is done. Fortunately, we have not had real examples of laboratory accidents leading to significant morbidity or mortality. The 1977 reintroduction of H1N1 into human circulation has been attributed to a laboratory mishap, although not all agree since other explanations are possible [27\u201329]. As discussed below, some authorities have presented worst-case scenarios based on hypothetical calculations, whereas others have used similar types of data to come up with numbers at the extreme opposite end of the spectrum, arguing that the likelihood of such events is extremely low.",

The annual rate of accidental exposure today could easily be ten to one hundred times smaller than it appeared to be in 2013.

The reported accidental exposures aggregate data on all organisms that require high levels of biosafety containment.

Proponents of GOF research argue that it can play a crucial role in preventing or lessening the effects of a global pandemic by enabling mitigation factors such as early detection and the rapid development of vaccines. One obvious additional risk, then, is the risk of a global pandemic that might have been prevented or mitigated by continuing GOF research. That risk is even more difficult to quantify than the risk of pandemic through accidental release.

One does not want to indulge uncritically in the mantra of knowledge for knowledge\u2019s own sake, a trope that has too often been used to justify research, but the fact remains that, on the whole, increased knowledge brings increased ability to promote the good and to mitigate suffering.

Infinite negative utility, multiplied by any finite probability, totally swamps every other term in a cost-benefit analysis, meaning that no imagined benefits of alternative courses of action, however great (excepting eternal salvation for all of humankind), can make a difference in the calculation. What this means is that cost-benefit analysis is, effectively, useless in such settings, at least with regard to the moral assessment of something like GOF research.

This is highly improbable but possible, and the consequences would be cataclysmic, outweighing any imaginable good that might derive from that action. Therefore, the precautionary principle would suggest that we do nothing. But doing nothing can equally well engender a sequence of events leading to human extinction. We conclude, therefore, one should act. This dilemma highlights a fatal contradiction lurking within any attempt to rationally assess actions that might entrain consequences with infinite negative utility via cost-benefit analysis.",

With enhanced biosafety protocols and improvements in the public health response, we should not ban GOF research but monitor it. The relevant research communities should insist upon stringent norms for the conduct of the research and in safety protocols. Provided that these conditions are met, there is no obvious reason why GOF type of experimentation should not go forward.",
