            "text": "Digestion begins in the mouth with mechanical disruption of food by chewing and mixing it with enzymes in the saliva. Further mechanical digestion continues in the stomach until the semiliquid food or chyme is formed. Digestion is completed when chyme is delivered into the duodenum and treated with pancreatic enzymes and bile salts. When normal gastric function is lost due to surgical procedures such as partial or total gastrectomy, the partially digested food rapidly passes into the duodenum causing osmotic pressure and diarrhea. Enzymatic activity is equally crucial for absorption of nutrients. Pancreatic enzymes and intestinal brush border hydrolases act in harmony for chemical modification of complex carbohydrates, proteins, and lipids. Therefore, any disorder causing defective nutrient hydrolysis as in Zollinger\u2013Ellison syndrome (ZES) where excess HCl (acid) production may inactivate gastric lipase and proteolytic pancreatic exocrine enzymes, pancreatic enzyme deficiency due to chronic pancreatitis, or a malignancy obstructing the outflow of pancreatic juices into the duodenum may all lead to malabsorption. There are reduced bile salt synthesis due to severe liver disease (cirrhosis) and impaired bile salt secretion due to chronic cholestasis (intrinsic liver disease that causes bile duct damage or extrahepatic bile duct obstruction): bile salts are thus not available to form micelles to aid in fat solubilization for absorption. Bile salts may be inactivated in the intestinal lumen by overgrowth of bacteria in small intestinal bacterial overgrowth syndrome (SIBO). In patients with conditions that predispose to intestinal stasis, either by anatomical or motility abnormalities bacteria may overgrow in the proximal small intestine (Figure 3\n). These excess bacteria deconjugate bile salts leaving them unconjugated and unable to participate in micelle formation. This leads to malabsorption of fat and fat-soluble vitamins A, D, E, and K.",

Lactase is a disaccharidase located on the surface of intestinal microvilli, which cleaves lactose to glucose and galactose. Lactase deficiency or hypolactasia in adulthood causes fermentation of lactose by intestinal microflora resulting in abdominal discomfort and diarrhea. The diarrhea is caused by the osmotic effects of lactose, glucose, and galactose in the colonic lumen, while short-chain fatty acids produced by fermentation of lactose cause flatulence (Figure 4\n). Rare primary congenital deficiency may occur in infants, while secondary deficiency may result from disorders causing mucosal injury including celiac disease, tropical sprue, and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Intermittent distribution of lactase on the brush border is revealed by immunohistochemistry, hydrogen breath tests and response to an exclusion diet are the diagnostic procedures for lactase deficiency.",

However, immunologic, genetic, and environmental factors all seem to be important.a.Immune mechanisms. Multiple observations favor the conclusion that celiac disease is an autoimmune disorder occurring in the context of a combination of genetic and environmental factors, including the following:i.Serum antibodies to gluten and its gliadin fraction are virtually always present in active celiac disease. A recent study showed subepithelial deposition of activated complement IgG and IgM in proportion to circulating antigliadin levels, suggesting humoral epithelial injury.Antireticulin antibodies, antiendomysium antibodies, and anti-tTG antibodies also correlate with disease activity and have diagnostic specificity.ii.There is presence of numerous intraepithelial lymphocytes (IELs), chiefly in the injured surface epithelium (these are mostly T cells, but with a high proportion gamma/delta types). This is highly consistent with cell-mediated injury that is somehow facilitated by gluten.iii.Steroids can cause patient improvement comparable to that with a gluten-free diet (GFD).iv.Patients with celiac diseases show a highly significant excess of other autoimmune diseases (e.g., insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus).\nb.Genetic factors. Genetic factors include the following:i.There are a strong tendency for celiac disease to run in families (11\u201322% occurrence in first degree relatives) and also a high (70%) concordance for celiac diseases in identical twin pairs.ii.There is a high correlation between celiac disease and presence of HLA-B8, DR3(DR17), DR7, and DQ2 histocompatibility loci. The strongest association (95%) is with a specific HLA DQ2 molecule that is seen in only 20\u201330% of the general population. The genetics seem to be \u2018complex\u2019 and a multigenic HLA-associated susceptibility is favored.iii.There are overlap with the blistering skin condition dermatitis herpetiformis, including similar mucosal alterations, and overlap in HLA markers and improvement in the skin lesions on a GFD.\nc.Environmental factor(s). It seems likely that an environmental factor is a necessary precondition, along with appropriate genetic makeup and gluten ingestion, for an individual to develop celiac disease. Support for this conclusion comes from the following:i.The fact that only one member of an identical twin pair is sometimes affected by celiac disease.ii.There is evidence of a possible role for viral infection: in one study, serological findings of prior exposure to an adenovirus (type 12) were unusually common. In addition, a type 12 adenovirus antigen shares an amino acid sequence with gliadin. Although more recent studies have not confirmed a direct correlation between celiac diseases and adenovirus 12, the concept remains an attractive paradigm.\n\n",

            "text": "Following uptake of gluten by the enterocytes, tTG deamidates gluten molecules that facilitate their binding to HLA-DQ2 and DQ8-bearing antigen-presenting cells. When gluten is presented to lamina propria CD4 + helper T cells, they become activated to secrete INF gamma and induce upregulation of IL15 that in turn boosts IEL-mediated cytotoxicity. IELs, under the influence of IL15, gain NK-cell-like properties and cause enterocyte damage (Figure 5\n). Tissue damage leads to tTG secretion and deamidation of more gluten peptides. Because of the immunopathologic basis of the disease, there is a complex and heterogeneous population of inflammatory cells in the lamina propria comprising plasma cells that locally produce antigliadin antibodies and antiendomysial antibodies, T cells that include predominantly helper T cells as well as few cytotoxic cells. Also, neutrophils, eosinophils, and mast cells may be found in varying numbers, though grading this inflammatory reaction is difficult and impractical. Since none of these changes is specific to CD, intraepithelial lymphocytosis (IELosis) and architectural changes effecting villous to crypt ratio remain as the main diagnostic parameters of pathological evaluation. Gluten sensitivity has also been known to affect other parts of the gastrointestinal tract, including esophagus, stomach, and large intestine, and interestingly enough, IELs are also increased in these areas in the form of lymphocytic esophagitis, gastritis, and colitis.",

In its classical form, CD results in shortened, widened villi or even totally flat mucosa with hyperplastic crypts (Figure 7(a)\nand 7(b)).

Appropriate histochemical stains such as Congo red or Sirius red are necessary for diagnosis, while immunohistochemistry can be used to classify the type of amyloid fibril protein. Deposition of amyloid in the vessels causes them to become leaky and fragile leading to hemorrhage.

Disorders causing gastrointestinal mucosal eosinophilia are presented in Table 5\n. The disease may be patchy and may involve either only the mucosa or mural and serosal involvement may also be found. The mechanism is believed to be mediated through activation of Th2 lymphocytes leading to an increased production of proallergenic interleukins, especially, IL-4, IL-5, and IL13. While IL-5 promotes maturation of eosinophils and migration from the bone marrow into the circulating bloodstream, IL-4 and IL-13 upregulate the production of eotaxin-3 by the epithelium, a chemokine responsible for attracting the eosinophils into the mucosa (Figure 11\n). As a result, mature eosinophils accumulate in the intestine, are activated, and degranulate releasing multiple cytotoxic agents. Though the mechanism of fibrogenesis is still unclear, IL-5, by inducing fibroblast\u2013myofibroblast transdifferentiation, may be the critical molecule for tissue fibrosis as well as smooth muscle hyperplasia that leads to defective peristaltism and malabsorption in this condition. Histological abnormalities consist of mild to severe eosinophilic infiltrates in the lamina propria and intraepithelial eosinophils both in the surface and crypt epithelium, forming eosinophilic crypt abscesses, and in the muscularis mucosae together with mildly increased IELs (Figure 12(a)\nand 12(b)).",

The disease was first described by Davidson et al. in 1978 as severe secretory diarrhea occurring during the first week of life with villous atrophy in the intestinal biopsy. It has been demonstrated that MYO5B gene located on 18q21 encoding myosin Vb that regulates the organization of intracellular transport and cell surface polarity in epithelial cells. Myosin Vb-deficient enterocytes display disruption of cell polarity as reflected by mislocalized apical and basolateral transporter proteins including CD36, altered distribution of certain endosomal/lysosomal constituents including Rab GTPases, and disorganization in the distribution of actin myofilaments (Figure 13\n). Although described as a disease of the small intestine, there are few reports of colonic involvement. Successful outcomes of small intestinal transplantation have been reported, and evidence suggests that an early transplant might be beneficial. Diagnosis rests on light and electron microscopic examination of small intestinal biopsy. Duodenal biopsies show moderate villous blunting, with no active inflammation in the lamina propria or IELosis. Changes in the enterocytes are typically found at the villous tips rather than villous bases and crypts. Light microscopy shows an irregular vacuolated appearance in the apical cytoplasm of the enterocytes with extensive or patchy absence of the brush border (Figure 14(a)\nand 14(b)). The surface epithelial brush border shows an abnormal pattern of staining by periodic acid\u2013Schiff (PAS) and CD10 instead of its normal linear staining pattern. Ultrastructural examination revealing intracytoplasmic inclusions that are lined by intact microvilli is the diagnostic hallmark of the disease (Figure 14(c)). These inclusions are present in the absorptive surface epithelial cells of the small intestine and are associated with poorly developed surface brush border microvilli.",

Bacterial overgrowth syndrome is more prevalent in elderly populations because of diminished gastric acid secretion and consumption of a large number of medications that can cause hypomotility. In addition, many patients with irritable bowel syndrome may suffer from this condition. Normally, small intestinal lumen is colonized by facultative anaerobe or obligate bacteria, particularly bacteroides species, which are most abundant in the distal ileum. Any disbalance of this complex intestinal microbiome, both qualitative and quantitative, might have serious health consequences resulting in SIBO. The diagnosis of bacterial overgrowth relies on the presence of increased intestinal volume and bacterial concentrations, hydrogen breath tests, and response to antibiotics. Small bowel aspirate and quantitative cultures with more than 105\n CFU ml\u2212 1 considered the cutoff are the diagnostic procedures. The resultant picture involves deconjugation of bile acids by bacterial enzymes causing loss of deconjugated bile acids in stool and decreased bile acid pool that is not enough for lipid digestion/absorption. Moreover, intraluminal consumption of nutrients such as carbohydrates and amino acids, vitamin B12, and iron by bacteria via competition and damage to small bowel enterocytes by bacteria causes a sprue-like histological and clinical picture. Proposed mechanisms for bacterial overgrowth are presented in Table 8\n. The mucosal biopsy may be normal or histopathologic picture may vary between mild to moderate villous shortening and blunting with increased chronic inflammatory cells in the lamina propria and IELs and/or neutrophils. As these features are usually patchy in nature, multiple biopsies should be taken. The diagnosis is difficult for the pathologist without clinical correlation.",

Infection occurs by fecal\u2013oral transmission, contaminated food and water, and person-to-person transmission. A number of studies have found that children and patients with hypogammaglobulinemia, agammaglobulinemia, IgA deficiency, and/or achlorhydria have a higher incidence of infection with Giardia. However, a humoral immunodeficiency state is not necessary for infection. Immunosuppressed patients are more likely to have long-term infections with chronic diarrhea and malabsorption, while immunocompetent patients are more likely to have an acute self-limited diarrheal illness or become asymptomatic carriers. In its classical picture, diarrhea, abdominal pain, boating, nausea and vomiting, malabsorption, and weight loss are the main presenting symptoms. Giardia exists in two forms: the motile trophozoite and the infective cyst. Following ingestion, the cyst forms two trophozoites in the duodenum. These are pear-shaped with two nuclei or sickle-shaped in sagittal plane appearing faintly basophilic on H&E sections. Trophozoites are typically found in the lumen near the surface or as attached to the enterocytes (Figure 20(a)\nand 20(b)). Giardiasis is a typical example of enteric infection that presents with normal or near-normal mucosa, although more severe change in the villous morphology resembling CD may rarely be seen. In children, giardiasis can cause lymphoid hyperplasia in the small intestinal mucosa.",

Cryptosporidiosis is usually associated with normal duodenal histology in mild infections, whereas severe inflammation and villous atrophy may complicate serious infections. The diagnosis relies on the detection of tiny acid-fast oocytes in fresh stools. Its characteristic appearance is a tiny spherical or ovoid basophilic organism attached to the apical aspect of the enterocyte both in the surface and crypt epithelium (Figure 21\n). They are best seen with modified Kinyoun stain. Cyclospora is similar to Cryptosporidium but it is larger and is usually found in the enterocyte cytoplasm. They stain with modified acid-fast stains. Isospora infection may lead to more morphological abnormalities in the form of villous blunting, crypt hyperplasia, and a mixed inflammatory infiltrate in the lamina propria, predominantly rich in eosinophils.

Some common enteric viruses known to cause diarrhea include, adenovirus, rotavirus, coronavirus, echovirus, enterovirus, astrovirus, and Norwalk virus. Rotavirus is the most common cause of severe childhood diarrhea and diarrheal mortality worldwide, particularly in children under the age of 2 years. Patients develop fever, severe watery diarrhea, and vomiting leading to dehydration and acidosis. Biopsy changes are very nonspecific and include increased inflammatory cells in the lamina propria, degenerative epithelial changes, and widening of villous tips. The diagnosis of rotavirus is generally made by stool immunoassay and/or culture, and the disease is rarely biopsied. Adenovirus infection is also frequent as a cause of childhood diarrhea. However, it may also cause diarrhea in immunocompromised patients, especially those with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and AIDS. Histological features of adenovirus infection include epithelial cellular changes such as loss of maturation, disorganization, and degeneration. Characteristic inclusions usually crescent-shaped may be seen, especially in immunocompromised patients, within the nuclei of surface epithelium (particularly goblet cells). Useful aids to diagnosis of adenovirus infection include immunohistochemistry, stool examination by electron microscopy, and viral culture.
