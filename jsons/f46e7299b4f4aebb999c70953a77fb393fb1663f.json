This redistribution is aimed to distribute time-dependent neurosurgical emergencies in hospitals with \"almost\" COVID-free dedicated pathways and facilities. This produced a downgrade of hospitals with a high volume of neurosurgical and neurological emergencies. High volume is an important characteristic of a hub, along with the served territory (in our case covering also remote mountains location for strokes) [1, 3] . Moreover, hubs should have teaching facilities as university-affiliated hospitals and/or could participate in international trials on trauma and cerebrovascular disease, both pharmacological and government/EU-funded research [1] [2] [3] . Research and teaching are among the criteria that can reflect the top-notch characteristics of an institution and a clinical group.",
