This gradient was little affected after adjustment for a wide range of covariates.

[5] [6] [7] [8] [9] Evidence for alcohol intake and diet on risk of respiratory infection are less clear. 8, 9 A better understanding of the links between lifestyle risk factors and COVID-19 has obvious implications for prevention of severe outcomes and also in identifying characteristics of those people most at risk. We are, however, unaware of any existing data on the relation of lifestyle risk factors with COVID-19. Accordingly, we examined the association of lifestyle risk factors with new cases of COVID-19-hospitalisations in a general population-based cohort study.",
