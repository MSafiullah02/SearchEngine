First, viral wheezing episodes during infancy are a critical risk factor for asthma inception. Once asthma is established, viral upper respiratory tract infections (URTIs) are the most common trigger for acute exacerbations. Furthermore, a potential role for particular bacterial pathogens in the development of wheezing and asthma exacerbations has been identified. This chapter will review the relationships between infections and asthma inception and exacerbation. Additionally, we discuss mechanisms by which infections lead to lower respiratory inflammation and airway dysfunction. Finally, we discuss treatment strategies for virus-induced wheezing and exacerbations of asthma.",

Using multiple virus detection methods, including polymerase chain reaction (PCR), Jartti and colleagues1 investigated the etiology of wheezing illness in 293 hospitalized children. Of the 76 infants with virus detected, 54% had respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), 42% had picornaviruses (human rhinovirus [RV] and enterovirus) and 1% had human metapneumovirus (hMPV). In older children, respiratory picornaviruses, most commonly RV, dominated (65% of children aged 1 to 2 years and 82% of children aged \u2265 3 years). Outpatient wheezing illnesses are also extremely common in young children, and viruses have been implicated in 67% to 90% of these episodes in different populations.2, 3\n",

            "text": "Wheezing with viruses during infancy is often an early manifestation of asthma. Several large, long-term prospective studies of children have demonstrated that RSV bronchiolitis is a significant independent risk factor for recurrent wheezing and asthma, at least within the first decade of life.4, 5 A recent clinical trial comparing palivizumab (anti-RSV monoclonal antibody) to placebo in near preterm infants demonstrated reductions in recurrent wheezing during the first year of life in the children treated with palivizumab.6 This is the strongest level of evidence to date in support of a causal role for RSV in recurrent wheezing. However, a longitudinal, population-based cohort study has demonstrated that the association between RSV lower respiratory infections during early life and both frequent (more than three episodes) and infrequent wheezing (less than three episodes) decreases with age and becomes nonsignificant by the age of 13 years.4 These data suggest that although RSV infections contribute substantially to the risk of recurrent wheezing and asthma in early childhood, other co-factors (e.g. genetic, environmental, developmental) also contribute to the expression of asthma or modification of phenotypes over time. Interestingly, a 2013 study identified unique immune response profiles during and after RSV bronchiolitis in comparison with bronchiolitis caused by other viruses.7\n",

Bronchiolitis during infancy is associated with an approximately 2-fold increased risk of early childhood asthma; however, this risk differs by season of bronchiolitis. Bronchiolitis occurring during RV-predominant months (spring and fall) was associated with an estimated 25% increased risk of early childhood asthma compared with RSV-predominant (winter) months. However, the proportion of associated asthma after winter season bronchiolitis is greater than RV-predominant months because of higher rates of bronchiolitis during the RSV season.16 Season of birth also appears relevant: children born close to the onset of the winter virus season are most prone to the development of lower respiratory tract symptoms, and this is likely due to a developmental component in relationship to the timing of the winter virus peak.17, 18\n",

First, Bisgaard and colleagues found that neonates with S. pneumoniae, H. influenzae or M. catarrhalis, or with a combination of these organisms, in their hypopharynx are at increased risk for recurrent wheeze early in life and the diagnosis of asthma at the age of 5 years.20 This original observation was made in infants of mothers with asthma, but the researchers were able to replicate some of these findings in an unselected cohort.26 Further, these pathogens have been detected at higher rates in preschool children during acute wheezing episodes.27 Interestingly, a similar predominance of Proteobacteria has been identified in the airways of older children and adults with established asthma.28, 29 Furthermore, in both human and animal studies, environmental exposure to \u2018protective\u2019 bacteria appears to have the capacity to prevent the development of wheezing and/or asthma in young children.30, 31, 32, 33 These studies of the role of microbial exposures and the microbiome in asthma inception are intriguing, and additional studies are a high priority to establish causality/protection and the specificity of these observations to asthma pathogenesis, and to define immunoinflammatory mechanisms contributing to these associations in both pediatric and adult patients.",

With the advent of these more sensitive diagnostic tools, information linking common cold infections with exacerbations of asthma has come from a number of sources. Prospective studies of children with asthma have demonstrated that up to 85% of exacerbations of wheezing or asthma in children are associated with viral infections.34 Although many respiratory viruses can provoke acute asthma symptoms, RVs are most often detected, especially during the spring and fall RV seasons. In fact, the spring and fall peaks in hospitalizations because of asthma closely coincide with patterns of RV isolation within the community.35 RV infections, most commonly RV-C, are frequently detected in children who present to emergency departments with acute wheezing and in children hospitalized for acute asthma.12, 14, 36 Influenza and RSV are somewhat more likely to trigger acute asthma symptoms in the winter but appear to account for a smaller fraction of total asthma flares. Other viruses that are less frequently associated with wheezing and exacerbations of asthma include bocavirus,37 metapneumovirus38 and coronaviruses.39 Together, these studies provide evidence of a strong relationship between viral infections, particularly those associated with RV, and acute exacerbations of asthma.",

Virus-induced injury to the epithelium can disrupt airway physiology through a number of different pathways (Box 31-2\n). For example, viral infections can increase the permeability of the epithelium,54 which may facilitate contact of irritants and allergens with immune cells, leave neural elements exposed and promote secondary infection with bacterial pathogens.

In addition, innate antiviral responses induce chemokines (e.g. CXCL10) that recruit inflammatory cells into the airway and type I (IFN-\u03b1 and IFN-\u03b2) and type III (IFN-\u03bb1 and IFN-\u03bb2) interferons that have autocrine and paracrine antiviral effects.",

Furthermore, allergen exposure and high-affinity IgE receptor cross-linking has been shown to impair virus-induced type I and III interferon production in peripheral blood cells.98, 99 This may lead to both enhanced viral replication and also type 2 inflammation.100, 101\n",

In addition, these episodes may range in severity from mild wheezing and coughing to severe respiratory distress that requires prompt medical intervention. Standard therapy for virus-induced wheezing in young children generally includes a stepwise addition of medications, typically commencing with a bronchodilator. If lower respiratory tract symptoms become increasingly severe or respiratory distress develops, oral corticosteroids are often added. Recent clinical trials in the management of these wheezing episodes also have included the use of high-dose inhaled corticosteroids (both prophylactically and/or as an acute intervention) and leukotriene receptor antagonists.",

The investigators performed post hoc and replication analyses in two outpatient cohorts of children120, 121 aged 1 to 5 years with episodic wheezing that had participated in previous CARE-conducted studies.122 Comparisons were made of symptom scores during LRTIs that were or were not treated with oral corticosteroids, adjusting for differences in disease and episode severity. The primary outcome was the area under the curve of total symptom scores among the more severe episodes. In both of the two cohorts studied independently, oral corticosteroid treatment did not reduce symptom severity during acute LRTIs. Moreover, subgroups of children who might have been more likely to experience benefit, such as those with asthma risk factors (positive modified asthma predictive index,123 personal eczema and/or family history of asthma), did not appear to have a greater benefit than those without such characteristics. The investigators emphasized, however, that these results were hypothesis generating and needed to be confirmed in randomized prospective studies.124 Taken together, however, these studies indicate that acute asthma-like episodes of airway obstruction in preschool children appear to respond less well to oral corticosteroid administration than do similar episodes in older children and adults.",

Treatment was for 2 years followed by a 1-year observation period off all study medication. The primary outcome measure was episode-free days. During the active treatment phase, children receiving inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) had a significantly increased number of episode-free days. In addition, they had significant reductions in oral corticosteroid-requiring exacerbations (37% reduction) and less use of a prespecified step-up plan. Pulmonary function was also significantly better at the end of the treatment period in those children who had received ICS for the previous two years. Unfortunately, about three months into the observation period, there was no longer any significant difference in any of these outcome measures and at the end of the observation period (1 year later), pulmonary function was also no different between the two groups.127 These data indicate that continuous therapy with ICS in preschool children at high risk of developing asthma reduces lower respiratory tract exacerbations that are most frequently caused by respiratory pathogens in this age group.",

After 1 year of treatment, the three groups did not differ in proportions of episode-free days (primary outcome), oral corticosteroid use, healthcare utilization, quality of life or linear growth. However, during respiratory tract illnesses, both ICS and montelukast therapy led to modest reductions in trouble breathing and interference with activity scores compared to those children only treated with albuterol. These differences were significant only in those children with a positive asthma predictive index prior to enrollment.

Unfortunately, treatment did not reduce the necessity for oral corticosteroid administration.

Notably, IFN-\u03b2 was well tolerated and also induced expression of innate antiviral effectors in the blood and sputum. In a subgroup analysis of study subjects with more severe asthma (British Thoracic Society Step 4 and 5), colds were associated with increased symptoms in the placebo group but not in IFN-\u03b2-treated subjects.

The prespecified primary outcome was the total number of parent-reported wheezing days in the first year of life. Nasopharyngeal swabs were taken during respiratory episodes for viral analysis. Palivizumab treatment resulted in a relative reduction of 61% in the total number of wheezing days during the first year of life (1.8% vs 4.5% in the placebo group). During this time, the proportion of infants with recurrent wheeze was 10 percentage points lower in patients treated with palivizumab (11% vs 21%).

In a placebo-controlled trial of guidelines-based asthma treatment compared to omalizumab added to standard therapy, omalizumab prevented the seasonal increases in exacerbations during the fall and spring, which are peak times for viral exacerbations (Figure 31-1\n).158 Analysis of viruses in nasal secretions during a subset of exacerbations confirmed that the treatment group had fewer viral and nonviral exacerbations. This study provides direct evidence that IgE-mediated inflammation contributes to the risk of virus-induced exacerbations of asthma. These observations indicate that interactions between allergic sensitization (antigen-specific IgE antibody formation) and viral respiratory illnesses play an important role in asthma control. Finally, it will be of interest to determine whether other drugs targeting specific type-2 cytokines (e.g. mepolizumab and IL-5)159 can also reduce the risk of virus-induced exacerbations.",

In addition, recent data demonstrated that azithromycin reduces RV replication and increases interferon gene expression in human bronchial epithelial cells.168 These effects may have substantial clinical relevance, as recent studies have demonstrated that primary bronchial epithelial cells from asthmatics have deficient ex vivo induction of IFN-\u03b2 and IFN-\u03bb after infection with RV,81 and the levels of IFN-\u03bb were inversely related to severity of RV-induced asthma exacerbations in terms of decline in FEV1 and viral load.

            "text": "In contrast to in vitro observations indicating a potential useful role of these agents in treating infection-induced loss of asthma control or exacerbations, their efficacy in humans has not been consistently shown. Black et al were one of the first groups to demonstrate a potential beneficial effect. They studied the effect of roxithromycin in subjects with asthma and immunoglobulin G (IgG) or IgA antibodies to Chlamydophila pneumoniae. Subjects were randomized to 6 weeks of treatment with roxithromycin or placebo. This intervention led to improvements in asthma control but the benefit was not sustained.170 Kraft and colleagues performed an additional study using a different antimicrobial. They found that treatment with clarithromycin for 8 weeks was beneficial in improving lung function, but only in those patients with positive PCR findings for Mycoplasma pneumoniae or C. pneumoniae.171 These initial intriguing results were later expanded upon by the Asthma Clinical Research Network who treated asthma patients that were not adequately controlled on inhaled corticosteroid monotherapy with clarithromycin or placebo for 16 weeks. They found that this treatment intervention did not further improve asthma control. Although there was an improvement in airway hyperresponsiveness with clarithromycin, this benefit was not accompanied by improvements in other secondary outcomes.172 One additional study suggested that some benefit might be possible following intervention with this antimicrobial class. Johnston et al administered the ketolide telithromycin (a semisynthetic derivative of erythromycin) for 10 days to adults with asthma seen within the first 24 hours of acute asthma episodes. This intervention resulted in significant improvements in symptom scores and lung function over the next 7 days relative to placebo.173 However, there was no relationship between bacteriologic status and the response to telithromycin treatment, suggesting a mechanism of action unrelated to the antimicrobial properties of telithromycin.",

Interactions between underlying allergy and virus infections lead to the greatest risk of asthma inception and exacerbation. New data indicate that the airway microbiome may play a critical role in modulating the response to respiratory viral infections, and virus-induced alterations in airway microbial populations likely also contribute to illness severity. Treatment of virus-induced wheezing and asthma exacerbations remains challenging and novel therapies and approaches to the prevention of asthma and asthma exacerbations are needed.",
