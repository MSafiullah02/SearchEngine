The segmented genome allows for exchange of genes between influenza viruses of the same type through genetic reassortment. Two types of influenza viruses, influenza A and B, cause epidemic disease in humans. The influenza A viruses are divided into subtypes and influenza B viruses into lineages based on their antigenic structure. The influenza A subtypes are differentiated based on characteristics of the haemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) surface antigens. Haemaglutinin is responsible for virus attachment during the early stages of infection and is the main antigen against which the host immune response is directed. Neuraminidase facilitates the release of mature virus from the cell surface.",

Between 28,000 and 111,500 influenza-associated deaths in children <5 years are estimated to occur each year, with 99% of these occurring in developing countries. Influenza is associated with approximately 10% of respiratory hospitalizations in children <18 years worldwide ranging from 5% in children aged <6 months to 16% in children aged 5\u201317 years [5]. Influenza-associated hospitalization rates are more than three times higher in developing than industrialised countries. The incidence and mortality associated with influenza can vary substantially from year-to-year as a result of different circulating types and subtypes with differing propensity to cause severe illness. Years in which influenza A(H3N2) predominates may typically be associated with increased risk of severe disease [6].",

The emergence of a pandemic influenza strain is unpredictable and can occur through two mechanisms. Firstly, a host could be simultaneously infected with two different influenza virus subtypes which could allow for exchange of genetic material or reassortment and the emergence of a new subtype. For example this could occur if a pig were infected by both a human and avian origin influenza subtype simultaneously with genetic exchange leading to the emergence of a virus adapted to spread in humans, but with HA and/or NA not currently circulating in humans. The second way that novel subtypes can emerge is if avian or other animal adapted subtypes are directly transmitted to humans and then undergo adaptation to allow transmission between humans. Currently some avian influenza virus subtypes such as influenza A(H5N2) can be transmitted to humans, usually following close contact with poultry, and cause severe infections. However, these viruses are not adapted for efficient transmission from person to person and therefore have not given rise to a new pandemic strain [2]. Global surveillance for new influenza virus strains is essential for early identification of novel strains to allow a global public health response.",

They provide results within 30 min, and, when used appropriately, are helpful in confirming influenza infection. In general, they are insufficiently sensitive to reliably exclude the disease. Further, their performance will depend on which antigens are expressed by currently circulating strains. When influenza activity is low, positive results are likely to be false-positives, however, their positive predictive value improves as influenza activity increases. Conversely, during periods of high influenza activity, false-negatives are more likely and may warrant additional testing in some patients.Since diagnostic confirmation seldom affects management of such children, the use of these tests is generally not recommended in low-resource settings and should be used judiciously in better-resourced areas. When used, it should be clear in the clinician\u2019s mind as to how the result is going to alter treatment: positive results can potentially reduce antibiotic usage and allow for early use of antivirals in those at high risk of complications or severe disease. However, it is important to recognize that the identification of influenza does not exclude the presence of bacterial co-infections.\nPolymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) tests\nThese tests are currently considered to be the most reliable for the diagnosis of influenza in children. Amongst the available options, they are the most sensitive and specific. They can be performed on most respiratory samples, most commonly nasopharyngeal aspirates or swabs. They are also able to differentiate influenza A and B, as well as subtypes of influenza A.More recently, point-of-care PCR assays have becomes available in some developed world settings. They are performed on nasal swabs and can supply a reliable result in as little as 15 min. While, not currently available in most developing world settings, if more affordable they could become an important new influenza diagnostic.Since the live attenuated influenza vaccine contains influenza genetic material, recent receipt of this vaccine will also result in a positive PCR test.\nImmunofluorescence tests\nThese are also performed on nasal or nasopharyngeal swabs and allow for the direct or indirect detection of influenza antigens. Influenza A and B can be differentiated, however, the sensitivity of these tests is moderate and, particularly during periods of high transmission, negative tests may need to be repeated using a more sensitive methodology (PCR or culture).\nViral culture\nViral culture takes at least 48\u201372 hours and so has limited utility in the routine diagnosis of influenza. However, they are helpful as part of surveillance activities and isolates can be used to inform annual vaccine planning.\nSerological assays\nA variety (hemagglutination-inhibition, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), and complement fixation assays) of serological assays can be performed but are of limited diagnostic value as they require acute and convalescent sampling. A fourfold increase in titre allows for a retrospective influenza diagnosis to be made. Their primary role is as a research tool.\n",

It is dosed orally and is approved for both treatment and prevention of influenza. It is available both in capsule form and as a powder for suspension, although the suspension has a relatively short shelf life and is often substantially more expensive than the capsule. As a result, the capsule is the most widely used formulation. When the oral suspension is unavailable the capsule can be opened and diluted with sweetened liquids to provide the appropriate dose.Zanamivir is predominantly available as an inhaled formulation, although intravenous zanamivir is available for investigational use, particularly for severely ill patients or those with suspected or confirmed oseltamivir-resistant virus. The inhaled preparation is contra-indicated in children with a history of wheezing or other chronic respiratory condition. Its use is not recommended for children younger than 5 years of age.Peramivir is an intravenous neuraminidase inhibitor that is not approved for use in children and is not widely available.Neuraminidase inhibitors are generally well tolerated. Common side effects include nausea, vomiting and rash, as well as bronchospasm with zanamivir. Neuropsychiatric symptoms have been linked to oseltamivir use, particularly in Japan, however, more recent evidence suggests no such causative link [36, 37]. Severe adverse reactions have been reported but are considered rare [38].The mainstay of influenza prevention remains immunization, but in high risk situations, amongst partially or unimmunized children, chemoprophylaxis can be considered. Both pre- and post-exposure chemoprophylaxis have been advocated, however, concerns regarding induction of oseltamivir-resistance have tempered enthusiasm for this approach and their prophylactic use is increasingly discouraged.Antiviral treatment should be offered as soon as possible for hospitalized children with presumed or confirmed influenza and for influenza of any severity for children at high risk of severe complications of influenza (Table 2.1) [39]. Timely oseltamivir treatment can reduce the duration of fever and symptoms. There are no prospective randomized controlled trials of treatment efficacy of neuraminidase inhibitors in hospitalized children and for severe outcomes but observational data suggest that treatment does reduce the risk of hospitalization and death, although there is some controversy in the literature (Table 2.2) [40]. Treatment should be initiated as early as possible. The benefit of any treatment is maximal early in the course of the disease and should be started within 48\u201372 hours of symptom onset. Influenza diagnosis may not have been confirmed within this timeframe and so treatment will often be initiated empirically prior to microbiological confirmation. Some evidence suggests benefit to those with very severe illness even when treatment is initiated later than 72 hours into the disease course. Therefore, in patients with severe or complicated disease, treatment should be initiated even if >48 hours after illness onset. Children meeting the clinical criteria for treatment should be treated irrespective of whether they have been vaccinated.Since influenza is generally a mild, self-limiting disease in previously well children, most such children will not require antiviral treatment even when they present soon after symptom onset. Treatment of such children increases the risk of adverse events, potentially increases the risk of resistance developing and may deplete medicine supply for those in greater need.\nAdamantanes [9, 39]These agents target the influenza A M2 protein, which is essential for efficient viral replication. They have no activity against influenza B and are not active against currently circulating influenza A strains. As such, there use is not currently recommended for the treatment or prevention of influenza. It has been suggested that they may have a role, in combination with oseltamivir, for the treatment of oseltamivir-resistant influenza A.\n\n\n",

Older people (\u226565 years), children <2 years and severely immunocompromised individuals often have poorer immune responses to inactivated influenza vaccine (IIV) compared with healthy adults.

Studies comparing efficacy of IIV and LAIV have generally found that LAIV has similar, or better efficacy, than IIV. Since 2013, LAIV4 has replaced LAIV3 as the available LAIV. Licensure was on the basis of immunogenicity studies. In 2016, conflicting findings on the effectiveness of LAIV emerged from different settings, with the USA withdrawing its recommendation for LAIV use in the 2016\u20132017 influenza season based on concerns of reduced effectiveness, particularly against the A(H1N1)pdm component of the vaccine [9]. Studies from Europe in the same seasons found moderate LAIV effectiveness, similar to that of IIV for the same year [45, 46] with recommendations for LAIV remaining unchanged in England and Europe.",

Vaccinating children can protect children directly and the general population indirectly. This strategy is especially important for individuals in whom influenza vaccine is not indicated, such as children aged <6 months (who may be protected through maternal immunization) [47\u201349]. A randomized controlled trial conducted in South Africa has shown that when pregnant women receive the influenza vaccine, their risk of developing influenza is halved, as is the risk to their infants in the first 24 weeks of life [47]. The vaccine has been shown not only to be efficacious for prevention of influenza in both mothers and their infants, but also safe [47\u201349]. Vaccination of healthcare workers may decrease the risk of spreading influenza to their patients. Recent influenza vaccination does not preclude a diagnosis of influenza as the vaccine is not 100% effective.",
