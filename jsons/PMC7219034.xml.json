[7] studied the specificity of IgG and IgA SARS-CoV-2 S1 ELISAs (research use only (RUO), Euroimmun) with 203 serum samples including 60 serum samples (taken 2\u20134 weeks after onset of symptoms) from non-SARS HCoV cases (n = 23 OC43; n = 18 NL63; n = 19 229E). Two HCoV OC43-positive samples cross-reacted in IgG and IgA assays, while HCoVs NL63 and 229E did not. In addition, these serum samples were also tested using a non-commercial Middle East Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), S1 IgG ELISA [11] with similar cross-reactive results. Larger studies, including neutralisation assays, will be needed to further assess seroassay performance.",

Considering the relatively slow IgG seroconversion, a second convalescent sample is often needed to obtain reliable test results. In acute phase diagnostics, IgA assays could be useful along with IgG in patients presenting with atypical symptoms, or when RT-qPCR repeatedly remains negative in a suspected case. Nicastri et al. [12] reported a paucisymptomatic case with transient mild conjunctivitis and low fever with fluctuating PCR results. However, IgG response was detected when this case was isolated in the hospital along with a positive PCR result. Haveri et al. [13] reported a patient with mild symptoms seroconverting (IgG) to SARS-CoV-2 in 9 days after onset of symptoms. ",

In our study, there were only 13 patients of 39 who were IgG positive with a median of 12 days (range: 5\u201320) after onset of symptoms and all 13 were also positive for IgA antibodies. The median for IgA alone (24 patients of 39) was 11 days (range: 5\u201320). As patient numbers were low, we cannot say if there was any clear pattern similar to the phenomenon observed by Okba et al. in our study, but we noted one case with mild disease severity (ID 5) who was still IgG negative 16 days after onset of symptoms. However, this should be considered when interpreting the serological results for e.g. patients with mild disease.",
