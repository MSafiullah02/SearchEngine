The diagnosis of FIP is difficult, especially in non\u2010effusive (dry) cases (Kipar and others 1999, Hartmann 2005, Pedersen 2009). A diagnosis cannot be based solely on serology or polymerase chain reaction (PCR), which detects the antibody response or the virus but does not provide information about the relationship between infection and clinical disease (Pedersen 1976, Herrewegh and others 1995, Pedersen 1995, Meli and others 2004). A diagnosis should be based on a combination of history (cats younger than 3 years or older than 10 years, especially living in crowded conditions), clinical signs and clinico\u2010pathological or pathological changes (Sparkes and others 1991, 1994, Foley and others 1998, Andrew 2000, Addie and others 2004, Hartmann 2005, Pedersen 2009).",

This electrophoretic pattern is also evident in effusions when present (Shelly and others 1988, Paltrinieri and others 1998). The macroscopic, physico\u2010chemical and cytological pattern of the effusion is also typical and has a high positive predictive value for FIP (Paltrinieri and others 1999). It is described as a yellowish, transparent to cloudy, sticky fluid, often with fibrin clots and characterised by high protein content, high specific gravity and variable amounts of cells, mostly composed of non\u2010degenerated neutrophils, macrophages and lymphocytes in a granular proteinaceous eosinophilic background.",

AGP is the major acute phase protein in cats and it increases in several inflammatory and non\u2010inflammatory conditions (Ceron and others 2005, Paltrinieri 2008). Nevertheless, the most prominent increases in serum AGP concentration have been recorded in cats with FIP (Duthie and others 1997, Giordano and others 2004) and AGP could also be measured in effusions (Bence and others 2005). However, even moderate increases in serum concentration of AGP can be used to support a diagnosis in cats with a strong clinical suspicion of FIP (Paltrinieri and others 2007).",

            "text": "These results confirm that the diagnosis of FIP can be difficult in vivo. In this study, both the history and clinical presentation could be misleading even if they were highly consistent or inconsistent with FIP. Likewise, macroscopic and cytological aspects of the effusion were often not considered pathognomonic, as they were also observed in inflammatory conditions other than FIP. Cytology of effusions is therefore not specific and cannot be used to support a diagnosis of FIP when histopathology is doubtful. Nonetheless, the cytological evaluation of effusions is always mandatory in the investigation as it can identify diseases other than FIP (e.g. tumours or septic effusions) that were not included in this study. Direct staining of FCoVs within macrophages by immunofluorescence in cytocentrifuged effusions is considered the most specific tool to confirm FIP (Hartmann 2005). However, it could not be applied in non\u2010effusive forms or in poorly cellular samples as those detected in some cats in this study. In addition, although this test was first established by our group years ago (Cammarata Parodi and others 1993), it is not routinely performed in our laboratory, as it is time consuming and other tests, such as SPE or AGP, can provide information that strongly support the diagnosis of FIP in cats with a high pretest probability of disease (Paltrinieri and others 2007).",

            "text": "It is commonly accepted that the diagnosis of FIP should be based on histopathological features (fibrinous polyserositis, infiltration of mononuclear cells and/or pyogranulomatous parenchymal foci; Kipar and others 1998, Addie and others 2004, Pedersen 2009). In this study, however, histopathology proved highly specific for FIP but was not a sensitive diagnostic test as it failed to confirm FIP in most affected cases and it had a poor concordance with IHC, which is considered to have the highest specificity for diagnosing FIP (Pedersen 2009). As such, the detection of lesions clearly consistent with FIP is intrinsically conclusive, but when the interpretation of lesions is not clear, FIP cannot be excluded. There is limited information available on how to approach these cases when IHC is not available. Although our study is limited by the small number of cases, the measurement of serum AGP concentration appeared to be most helpful as it was the only diagnostic test in complete concordance with IHC. However, it must be pointed out that AGP is an acute phase protein and, by definition, its serum concentration increases in any inflammatory/infectious condition (Kajikawa and others 1999, Ceron and others 2005, Paltrinieri 2008) or even in non\u2010inflammatory disease such as lymphoma (Correa and others 2001) or other tumours (Selting and others 2000). The excellent performance of AGP in this study could thus be biased because of the lack of cases with other severe inflammatory diseases. Nevertheless, two factors must be taken into account in evaluating AGP concentrations to support a clinical diagnosis of FIP: the magnitude of the increase and the pretest probability of FIP. The cut\u2010off employed in this study was as suggested by Duthie and others (1997) who noted that, although AGP can increase in any inflammatory condition, the increase is more pronounced in FIP than in other diseases. This has been confirmed by other studies (Giordano and others 2004, Paltrinieri and others 2007) and ultimately also by the results of this study. In a recent study (Paltrinieri and others 2007), it was demonstrated that AGP can be used to support a clinical diagnosis of FIP according to the Bayesian approach. When the pretest probability of FIP is high (when most of the in vivo or postmortem tests are consistent with but not absolutely conclusive of FIP), a \u201cpositive test\u201d (a high AGP value) can increase the posttest probability of disease. In other words, although AGP alone cannot be used to confirm a clinical suspicion of FIP, it could be confirmatory when FIP is probable but not definitely diagnosed based on other clinicopathological findings or on postmortem examination results.",

In the absence of lesions clearly consistent with FIP or potentially consistent with other diseases, IHC should always be performed. If this is not possible, the presence of typical SPE patterns or of effusions cytologically consistent with FIP must not induce the pathologist to interpret ambiguous histological results as \u201cconsistent with FIP.\u201d Conversely, the presence of high concentrations of AGP may support the diagnosis of FIP in those cases in which results of other clinicopathological tests or histopathology are inconclusive.",
