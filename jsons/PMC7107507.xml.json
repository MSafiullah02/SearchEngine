The sample-based, rarefaction method estimates the expected number of parasite species represented among red wolves and coyotes, given the observed samples to generate predicted estimates of parasite richness. We also extrapolated the rarefaction curve to a sample size of 50 canid individuals to evaluate how endoparasite species richness varied between red wolves and coyotes with equal and larger sample sizes. We based significant differences between red wolf and coyote rarefaction estimates on non-overlapping 95% CIs generated through bootstrapping routines in EstimateS, which is a conservative estimate of significance (Colwell et al. 2012).",

Explanatory variables for each model included age class, sex, species, and year collected with a random effect of region captured (coyotes) or pack (wolves). We included random effects to control for nonindependence between individuals from the same pack or trapping region. We defined age classes as pup (less than 12 months old), juvenile (greater than 12 months but under 2 years), and adult (greater than 2 years); we determined age by date of birth for wolves and based estimated ages on tooth wear (Gier 1975) and sexual maturity for coyotes. We ran 12 a priori candidate model sets, including a null and global model (Supporting Information S1\u20138), separately for each of the following response variables: endoparasite counts (tally of infectious species, weighted by infection level), heartworm presence, ectoparasite loads, and any other pathogenic parasite (either individual endoparasite species or tick-borne bacteria) with an observed infection rate above 10%. We evaluated the probability of specific endoparasite species, heartworm, and tick-borne bacteria using GLMMs with a logit-link function and binomial error distribution; models with ectoparasite loads were evaluated using CLMMs with a log-link function. We assessed endoparasite counts using GLMMs with a log-link function and Poisson distribution. All models were ranked with AICc and AICc weight (wi\u2014Burnham and Anderson 2002) and validated by examining residuals and fitted values as suggested by Zuur et al. (2009). We averaged models within \u03942 AICc of the top model using the natural-average method (Burnham and Anderson 2002) in R package MuMIn (Barto\u0144 2009); we also used analysis of variance to evaluate if additional variables significantly improved model fit. Given that adult heartworm prevalence was high, we evaluated if adult red wolves were more likely to have heartworm than adult coyotes with Fisher\u2019s exact test; we were unable to test this with GLMMs given small sample sizes (adult red wolves tested for heartworm = 13, adult coyotes tested for heartworm = 10).",

All 3 parasites were considered limiting factors to red wolf survival and may have affected morbidity and mortality significantly (Riley and McBride 1972; Carley 1975; Custer and Pence 1981b). Hookworm infections were especially high in pups and juveniles and may have been a leading cause of juvenile mortality (Custer and Pence 1981a). The severity of heartworm infections increased with age (Custer and Pence 1981b), resulting in pathological responses such as enlarged and deformed hearts, and increasing stress-induced mortality that healthy wolves would likely have survived (Riley and McBride 1972; Carley 1975). Sarcoptic mange was the most serious ectoparasite; infections were so numerous that by the 1970s, 90% of observed red wolves were at least partially devoid of hair (Riley and McBride 1972). Other detected parasites included tapeworm (Taenia sp.), demodectic mange mites (Demodex sp.), spiny headed worms (class Archiacanthocephala), flatworms (Heterobilharzia americana), several species of ticks (Amblyomma sp., Ixodes scapularis), and 1 louse (Trichodectes canis\u2014Riley and McBride 1972; Custer and Pence 1981a; Pence et al. 1981).",

No captive red wolves had heartworm, and only 1 of 7 tested wild wolves was heartworm positive. Wild adult wolves, however, had been regularly treated with ivermectin, a heartworm prophylactic, prior to release. Captive red wolves had fewer endoparasites (48% infected) than wild wolves (67% infected), but both were infected with several different intestinal parasites including hookworms (both wild and captive wolves), ascarids (more common in captive wolves and only found in pups), whipworms (wild only), and tape-worms (both wild and captive wolves\u2014Phillips and Scheck 1991). Phillips and Scheck (1991) suggested that hookworm was the only parasite occurring at high enough frequencies to be of concern to red wolf health. Three tick species, American dog tick (Dermacentor variabilis), lone star tick (Amblyomma americanum), and black legged tick (I. scapularis), were detected on wild and captive wolves (Phillips and Scheck 1991). Since reintroductions, several tick related illnesses have been detected in wild wolves. Tick paralysis may have occurred in a female red wolf from North Carolina and was positively observed in 1 male, who recovered fully once ticks were removed (Beyer and Grossman 1997). Several red wolves housed at the Great Smoky Mountains National Park were serologically positive for the bacteria causing Lyme disease (B. burgdorferi); one positive wolf also exhibited B. burgdorferi clinical symptoms, including decreased appetite, weight loss, and carpal lesions (Penrose et al. 2000).",

Based on samples collected from 2000 to 2006, red wolves and coyotes were naturally exposed to both CPV2 and CDV, but North Carolina canid titers were lower than those for other wild canid populations (Acton 2008). CDV vaccines appeared to elicit 100% seroconversion, or the development of detectable vaccine antibodies, but CPV2 vaccines did not reliably elicit seroconversion (Acton 2008). This is similar to results reported by Harrenstien et al. (1997), where red wolf response to CPV2 vaccines was minimal. Based on seroprevalence, poor vaccine efficacy, and neonatal antibody assays, Acton (2008) suggested that CPV2 may contribute to juvenile mortality in wild red wolves. A recent study by Anderson et al. (2014) found 100% and 96.9% of captive wolves had positive CPV and CDV vaccine titers, respectively, 3 years after vaccination, but this was after a full juvenile vaccination series and a 1 year booster, which wild canids usually do not receive. Seroconversion for canine adenovirus was sporadic (Anderson et al. 2014).",

Interactions between coyotes and red wolves may facilitate disease transmission between the species, leading to the introduction of new pathogens to the red wolf population. This could affect long-term population recovery because small, endangered populations like red wolves are likely to be immunologically na\u00efve and lack the genetic variation necessary to combat new diseases (Spielman et al. 2004). Interestingly, coyotes and red wolves did not significantly differ in their probability of infection in any of the parasites we evaluated (Table 2), with the exception that adult red wolves were more susceptible to heartworm than coyotes and twice as many coyotes tested positive for the bacteria causing Lyme disease. Perhaps differences in red wolf and coyote diet, foraging behavior, or habitat preference cause differential exposure to the heartworm and Lyme disease vectors: mosquitoes and Ixodes ticks, respectively. Long-term temporal data would help determine with more certainty if coyotes act as a disease reservoir and inform the dynamics of disease transmission between the species.",

Treatment of mange is difficult in wild animals because it requires capturing and administering ivermectin to both infected individuals and those they contacted (Bornstein et al. 2001) but would be warranted for red wolves if a mange epizootic occurred since there have been 46 cases of mange infections successfully treated in wild red wolves.",

Although currently these viruses do not appear to be epizootic within the southeast region (although see Dyer et al. 2013; Supporting Information S9), the red wolf population may be at risk.

Vaccines and other interventions such as ivermectin for mange could have negative evolutionary consequences in wild populations because selection pressures for immunity may be weakened with continued treatment. Opportunistic vaccines and treatments that do not provide life-long immunity could also result in multiple individuals becoming susceptible to disease simultaneously, increasing the risk of an epizootic (Woodroffe 1999). The potential drawbacks of vaccines and medical intervention need to be considered by managers and the risk of infection found sufficient to justify intensive prevention efforts. For red wolves, the very real risk of extinction due to their extremely small population size outweighs the potential negative effects of intervention, especially for virulent viral pathogens such as rabies and treatable conditions like mange. As the red wolf population increases and additional wild population are established, vaccinations and intensive treatment may no longer be necessary.",

Hookworm increased pup mortality in the remnant Louisiana and Texas population (Custer and Pence 1981a) and remains a management concern due to its current prevalence rate and high loads in young wolves (Fig. 2). High heartworm prevalence may be a more immediate threat because heartworm infections have caused the death of at least nine red wolves and adults may be especially susceptible to them (Fig. 3). Compounding the negative effects of hookworm and heartworm is that wild red wolves are inbred (Brzeski et al. 2014), which may cause them to suffer more from co-infections or stressful conditions than an outbred population, like coyotes (Coltman et al. 1999; Spielman et al. 2004). Management efforts, such as cross fostering captive born pups into wild litters, can help mitigate the deleterious effects of inbreeding (Brzeski et al. 2014), but continued monitoring of endoparasites and more rigorous demographic modeling of the impact of heartworm related deaths will be useful for future disease prevention.",

For instance, climate and landscape changes have facilitated the spread of the bacteria causing Lyme disease, B. burgdorferi, and based on climate models, Lyme disease is expected to continue to expand northward (Ostfeld et al. 1996; Ogden et al. 2006). The presence of Lyme disease, Ehrlichia spp., and Rocky Mountain spotted fever in red wolves and coyotes serves as a benchmark for detecting the emergence of additional vector-borne pathogens in North Carolina.",

This may be due in part to vaccines and medical interventions, or wild red wolves may not have been exposed to extremely virulent pathogens. But the prevalence rate of parasites in the red wolf and sympatric coyote populations as well as several regional trends reveal substantial concerns. In a critically endangered population such as wild red wolves, every wolf is important for species persistence and pathogens that reduce fitness, result in occasional deaths, or even moderately affect population growth could contribute to extinction (Woodroffe 1999). To mitigate disease-driven declines, endangered species programs such as the Red Wolf Recovery Program must incorporate disease monitoring and prevention plans to ensure long-term recovery, the first steps of which we presented here.",
