As previously demonstrated for other FCVs (Ossiboff et al., 2007, Radford et al., 2007), our strain not form a distinct group based on geographic origin, host range or clinical signs. Comparison of hypervariable region E to the available sequences revealed no consistent differences among Te/10/07 strain and those associated with the most characteristic disease. By BLAST and FASTA analysis of ORF1 and ORF2 genes, our isolate appeared to be most genetically related to the F65 strain (UK, 1990), that has previously been demonstrated experimentally to induce a febrile lameness syndrome (Dawson et al., 1994, Glenn et al., 1999). This observation allowed us to hypothesize that Te/10/07 does not arose from a recombinant event between two different FCV strains or between a FCV strain and a closely related calicivirus.",
