Markers of myocardial injury, such as troponin and N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP), have been shown to increase rapidly in non-survivors. 2, 3 Although cardiovascular disease appears to predispose some patients to COVID-19-related myocardial injury, acute myopericarditis in the absence of prior disease has also been described, even without signs of interstitial pneumonia. 4 ARDS mechanical ventilation with high positive endexpiratory pressure (PEEP) along with the presence of intravascular thrombosis in the setting of sepsis-induced coagulopathy could increase susceptibility to pulmonary hypertension, right heart dysfunction, and end-organ (e.g. kidney) hypoperfusion. 5 The risk of cardiovascular and renal injury in conjunction with the importance of conservative fluid management as a key tenet of ARDS treatment justifies the need for judicious monitoring of intravascular volume status in the COVID-19 cohort. 6 We reflect on the clinical utility of select popular hemodynamic monitoring devices and suggest that the pulmonary artery catheter (PAC) shows empirical promise as a validated tool that maximizes monitoring capabilities and minimizes expenditure of hospital resources.",

Furthermore, accurate estimations of stroke volume could also help avert pre-renal kidney injury. However, we recognize that PA catheterization is not without its limitations and risks. High intrathoracic pressures in the setting of a high PEEP strategy to improve oxygenation in ARDS could lead to overestimation of left ventricular volumes based on PA diastolic pressures. High PEEP could also theoretically increase the risk of PA perforation, one of the most feared complications of PAC use. In addition, the effectiveness of PAC-derived data in significantly altering clinical outcomes still remains equivocal. 9 Nevertheless, we propose that the PAC maximizes resource utilization in the COVID-19 ICU arena by providing continuous assessments of intravascular volume and cardiac function while limiting staff exposure and personal protective equipment",

The PiCCO system is unique in its ability to provide volumetric assessments of preload (global end-diastolic volume) and pulmonary edema (extravascular lung water, pulmonary vascular permeability index). 11 PiCCO guidance may be associated with a shorter duration of respiratory support and faster recovery of PaO 2 /FiO 2 ratios in ARDS patients, perhaps because optimization of extravascular lung water serves as a positive prognostic factor. 12, 13 The LiDCO system provides comparable CO measurements to PACs, but unlike the PiCCO, it has not been examined in ARDS patients managed with a high PEEP strategy; furthermore, the LiDCO is not reliable in the setting of muscle relaxation, given that quaternary ammonium ion-based agents may interfere with the lithium sensor. 10, 14 The FloTrac monitor has also gained popularity as an easy-to-use, operator independent system, but the accuracy of FloTrac-derived CO measurements remains equivocal. 15 Furthermore, unlike the PiCCO and LiDCO monitors, the FloTrac system may not be reliable in septic patients with low SVR, nor could FloTrac-derived SVV be utilized for fluid optimization as it is poorly predictive of volume responsiveness. 10 Non-invasive monitors rely on quantification of thoracic impedance variability, ultrasound imaging, and measurement of velocity-time integrals from Doppler signals to provide information about CO (Table 1 ). The Non-invasive Cardiac Output Monitoring (NICOM) device analyzes phase shifts in the voltage of electrical impulses passed between electrodes on either side of the body; it provides accurate CO values in mechanically ventilated patients that correlate with fluid responsiveness, irrespective of hemodynamic instability or arrhythmias, though it has yet to be studied in the context of ARDS management. 10 Ultrasound-based technologies, such as esophageal Doppler and echocardiography, have mass appeal as they are also reliable in their real-time assessment of CO and fluid responsiveness. 10 The armamentarium of hemodynamic monitoring devices should be exploited to augment therapeutic tactics for conservative fluid management in a population that is vulnerable to sustaining multi-organ injury. The PAC is a promising option that maximizes monitoring capabilities while limiting exposure of healthcare workers and depletion of highly coveted PPE.",
