            "text": "In August 1999, an unusual cluster of cases of meningoencephalitis associated with muscle weakness was noticed in New York City, NY. Initial epidemiological and environmental investigations suggested an arthropod-borne viral cause (arbovirus), and both serologic testing and viral testing were performed to identify such a virus. The first 8 patients tested positive for antibodies against St Louis encephalitis (SLE), a mosquito-borne illness, and mosquito-control measures were instituted. Concurrently, an unusual number of deaths were noted in birds, primarily crows, and in some exotic captive bird species in the Bronx Zoo in New York City. Since SLE does not cause deaths in birds, the human and bird illnesses were thought to be unrelated. Autopsies performed on captive birds that died in the Bronx Zoo revealed varying degrees of meningoencephalitis and severe myocarditis. Tissue specimens were negative for common avian pathogens and the equine encephalitis viruses. However, the National Veterinary Services Laboratories in Ames, Iowa, isolated a virus from the birds\u2019 tissues and forwarded this to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Testing by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and DNA sequencing at the CDC and the University of California at Irvine indicated that this virus was closely related to WNV and that it was identical to virus from human brain tissue from 4 encephalitis cases in New York. On retesting, all initial serum/cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) specimens reactive to SLE were positive for WNV by IgM enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), with higher positive-negative ratios than to SLE. An additional 18 patient samples that were either borderline or negative for SLE were positive for antibody to WNV, confirming that WNV was indeed the cause of the illness in these patients.6\n",

            "text": "The discovery in 2000 that WNV survived in overwintering Culex mosquitoes in New York dashed hopes that the virus would not do well in temperate climates and heralded the westward spread of the disease.7 Since then the infection has been steadily spreading westward. From 1999 through 2001, there were 149 cases of WNV human illness reported in the United States and 18 deaths (Table 1\n). In 2002 reported cases increased dramatically, with 4156 laboratory-confirmed human cases and 284 deaths (Table 1, Table 2\n). Illinois, Indiana, Ohio, Michigan, Louisiana, and Texas reported the largest number of cases. In 2003, the first confirmed human case was reported from South Carolina on July 7. As of August 11, 2003, the CDC has received reports of a total of 182 human cases of WNV infection from 17 states with 5 reported deaths. At the same time in 2002, 112 human cases from 4 states had been reported. In 2002 the vast majority of cases occurred after the first week of August, and if the same pattern holds true in 2003, an even larger outbreak is expected this year. Surveillance on animal populations by the CDC supports this hypothesis. The number of infected horses and infected mosquito pools far outpaces the number reported at this time in 2002.9\n",

All flaviviruses are closely related antigenically, which accounts for the serologic cross-reactions observed. Members of the JE complex are even more closely related; often, specialized tests are needed to differentiate the infecting flavivirus. The WNV is a spherical particle that is approximately 50 nm in diameter. It is an enveloped single-stranded RNA virus. The viral membrane has 2 integral glycoproteins\u2014E (viral envelope) and M (membrane). The E-glycoprotein, the viral hemagglutinin, mediates virushost cell binding. It elicits most of the virus-neutralizing antibodies.10, 11\n",

The most likely explanations are that it was carried by infected migrating birds or possibly by infected adult mosquitoes or larvae inadvertently transported on an airplane.

            "text": "Infections of WNV have resulted in pronounced human and economic losses since WNV first appeared in the United States in 1999. The year 2002 saw a dramatic increase in the number of cases, widening geographic distribution, and an increase in the period when cases occurred (Table 2). Also, several new modes of transmission and new clinical presentations were recognized. The illness causes substantial morbidity in elderly persons, immunosuppressed persons, and pregnant women. These groups should take special precautions against mosquito bites. Management consists of supportive care; no specific treatment or vaccine is currently available.",
