Worldwide, 20% of children and 5% of adults develop symptomatic infections due to influenza A or B viruses each year.1 The virus causes asymptomatic disease as well as lung, brain, heart, kidney, and muscle disorders and predisposes patients of all age groups to bacterial pneumonia. Illness development depends on the patient's age, pre-existing immunity, immune competence, virus properties, smoking, and pregnancy. Rates of serious infection and death are highest among people aged >65 years and people with serious medical conditions. The virus is most commonly spread among humans by respiratory droplets containing virus via coughing and sneezing but can sometimes also be transmitted directly to humans by avian or swine species.",

Uncomplicated influenza illness is characterized by the abrupt onset of constitutional and respiratory signs and symptoms such as fever, myalgia, headache, nonproductive cough, sore throat, and rhinitis.8 These symptoms are of course common to many viral infections, and respiratory viruses other than influenza are known to contribute to lower respiratory tract complications and deaths in elderly people during the winter months while producing symptoms very similar to those of influenza virus infection. In 1997, Nicholson and colleagues9 studied the causes of respiratory infections in elderly people living at home in Leicestershire, UK, and concluded that 52% of the diseases were caused by rhinoviruses, 26% by corona-viruses, 9.5% by influenza, and 7% by respiratory syncytial virus (RSV).",

The most common serious complication of influenza is pneumonia, which may occur at the same time as the influenza-like illness or up to 2 weeks afterwards. Viral pneumonia accompanied by toxemia can develop within 24 h following the onset of influenza, usually influenza Type A infection. The pneumonia is an interstitial pneumonitis with severe hyperemia and broadening of the alveolar walls together with a mononuclear cell infiltration, capillary dilatation, and thrombosis.10 The symptoms include tachypneoa, tachycardia, high fever, and hypotension. Hypoxemia and death may follow between 1 and 4 days later. Initial improvement in those who survive occurs 5\u201316 days after onset of the pneumonia. Generally, there are no lasting complications after severe influenza infection, although a few patients develop a diffuse interstitial fibrosis accompanied by impaired lung function.10\n",

Infection with S. aureus affects the lung by causing oedema, hyperemia, hemorrhaging, consolidation, and formation of pus. When secondary bacterial infections are associated with type A influenza viruses they can be particularly harmful. During influenza A infections, there is apoptosis of leukocytes recruited into the airways, resulting in reduced efficiency of bacterial phagocytosis and destruction.11 Many other immune functions may be compromised during influenza virus infection, and influenza virus infection of epithelial cells has been shown to directly enhance bacterial adherence to the cells.12\n",

Flu vaccines need to be redesigned annually to immunize against particular strains or group of strains, a process that can take several months. Chemoprophylaxis should be considered for people at high risk during the time from vaccination until immunity has developed, since antibody responses in adults develop approximately 2-weeks post vaccination.13 Prophylactic use of antiviral agents is also an option for preventing influenza among persons with anaphylactic hypersensitivity to eggs or other components of the influenza vaccine, or in \u201cat-risk\u201d individuals (including those aged over 65) recently exposed to a person with an influenza like illness, or for those same individuals during an epidemic. Indeed, the U.K. National Institute for Clinical and Health Excellence (NICE) recently published guidelines indicating that prophylactic postexposure use of ostelamivir (see below) is recommended for use in at-risk groups in residential care during periods when the virus is known to be circulating, or in unprotected at-risk people exposed to someone with an influenza-like illness. Unprotected people in the cases above means people not vaccinated since the previous flu season, or when the vaccine strain does not closely match the circulating strains of virus, or during the period before the vaccination takes effect.",

This policy has been adopted by a number of countries; however, only a fraction of the approximately 30 million doses needed in the UK are so far available. The most practical influenza medication is considered to be Tamiflu (ostelamivir-phosphate) produced by Roche. Although Tamiflu is available on the National Health Service (NHS) for treating high-risk groups, supply may be limited.",

Each year, the vaccine is reformulated, based on assessment of which viruses have been circulating globally.

The 11 TLRs recognized to date and their ligands, as well as their signaling activation pathways that may be altered during aging, are summarized in Table 6.2. Clearly, responses to viral infection are influenced by TLRs, such as TLR-3. This receptor is constitutively expressed in human alveolar and bronchial epithelial cells. Its ligand is double-stranded RNA, which is produced during influenza and other viral infections, and its expression was found to be positively regulated by the influenza A virus via the secretion of the cytokines IL-8, IL-6, RANTES, and interferon-beta, and the upregulation of the major adhesion molecule ICAM-1.54 In a recent study, Renshaw and colleagues47 assessed TLR expression on splenic and peritoneal macrophages of aged mice and concluded that decreased expression and function of TLRs resulting from aging may partially contribute to the increased susceptibility of the elderly population to bacterial, viral, and yeast infections.\n\n",
