            "text": "Allogeneic haematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) is an important treatment option for several malignant and non-malignant diseases in childhood. However, 40% to 60% of the patients have pulmonary complications after HSCT, which contributes for a significant percentage to transplant-related mortality [9, 25, 27]. These complications are infectious or non-infectious and are classified as early or late depending on whether they occur before or after day 100 after transplantation [12]. Several risk factors for infectious complications including neutropenia and myeloablative therapy [8] have been published, while non-myeloablative conditioning regimen and graft source may predispose for non-infectious pulmonary complications such as pulmonary graft versus host disease (GvHD). Yet, reliable predisposing risk factors have not been established, partly due to insufficient understanding of the exact underlying pathophysiologic mechanisms of these diseases [1, 12]. The most common early-onset non-infectious pulmonary complications include peri-engraftment respiratory distress syndrome (PERDS), idiopathic pneumonia syndrome (IPS) and bronchiolitis obliterans with organising pneumonia (BOOP) [12, 30]. Therefore, measurement of the degree of bronchial inflammation is a potential key for early detection of HSCT-related pulmonary pathology. During inflammatory processes in the lungs, inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) is known to be upregulated, leading physiologically to production of nitric oxide (NO) supporting a non-specific defence against microorganisms. Furthermore, nitric oxide seems to be involved in airway and vascular calibre regulation, finally leading to bronchodilation [14]. Kanamori et al. [15] have shown that fraction of exhaled nitric oxide (FeNO) is elevated in adults with bronchiolitis obliterans after HSCT. We therefore hypothesised that FeNO may be a sensitive marker for early alloimmunologic pulmonary complications also in children and adolescents, but prospective data have not been published yet to support this hypothesis.",

Inclusion criteria were age above 3 years and below 18 years, indication for allogeneic stem cell transplantation and signed informed consent by patients and/or legal guardians. Patients were excluded if they had severe respiratory distress and if they were unable to cooperate or did not comply with the age requirements. We prospectively included 30 consecutive children after allogeneic HSCT: age, 3\u201317 years (mean 12.79 (\u00b15.2) years); mean BMI, 20.3; 11 female. All these patients had performed a total of four FeNO measurements pre- and post-HSCT. For the underlying diseases and baseline patient characteristics see Table 1; the respective subgroups are displayed in the flow chart of Fig. 1. For all these patients, medical records, spirometric data and radiologic examinations were reviewed.\n\n",

One hundred days after HSCT, 20 children were able to perform lung function testing, leading to pathologic results in nine cases (45%), with five children showing a restrictive pattern. No correlation could be found between lung function parameters and FeNO levels before or after HSCT in our study cohort. Overall, 11 children had pathologic chest radiographs before HSCT, predominantly revealing pulmonary infiltrates. After HSCT, 23 of 30 children had pathologic chest radiographs at any time point. Causes of radiologic pulmonary infiltrates were predominantly infections (21/23), while two of the pathologies were non-infectious of origin. As risk factors increased generally for transplant-related mortality [10, 20], 23 of 30 children (77%) received myeloablative conditioning, 6 of 20 children (20%) received busulfan during conditioning, 16 patients (53%) had a matched unrelated donor and 19 children (63%) underwent total body irradiation with 12 Gy. Twenty-five subjects (83%) had a malignant underlying disease, 7 patients (23%) had one mismatch in their graft, 1 had two mismatches. Increased risk for CMV infection was assumed if the recipient was CMV IgG positive but the donor CMV IgG negative, which could be observed in seven children (23%).",

Kanamori and co-workers [15] have published a case series of adults with BOOP after HSCT with FeNO levels above 36 ppb, suggesting that elevated FeNO may be predictive for pulmonary complications after HSCT. In a recent study with adult patients after lung transplantation, FeNO has been shown to be a valuable tool for risk stratification for bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome [21]. In contrast to immunocompetent children [7, 19], no data exist on normal FeNO levels in immunosuppressed children or on the predictive value of elevated FeNO for pulmonary complications after paediatric allogeneic HSCT. FeNO levels were generally lower in our cohort than in the adult study by Kanamori or in adult patients following autologous HSCT after breast carcinoma [24], reflecting the fact that norm values in immunocompetent children are also lower than in adults. Notably, FeNO levels did not correlate significantly with pulmonary function parameters such as FEV1, FVC or TLC. This finding may be due to the fact that the role of PFT as a predictive factor for pulmonary complications after HSCT is discussed controversially [30] and may be rather a secondary parameter for respiratory impairment.",

Immunologic inactivation of iNOS may therefore be responsible for the missing correlation of FeNO with pulmonary infections in our immunosuppressed study population. We hypothesised that inactivation of NO production could be reversed by alloimmunologic mechanisms as described for non-infectious pulmonary complications after HSCT [13, 17, 25, 28, 29]. We could show that children with pulmonary complications after day +60 had a trend towards higher FeNO levels at day 0 and day +28 than children without PC (in a subcohort of ALL patients only at day +28), without reaching statistical significance. These data suggest a possible role of FeNO as an easily accessible, non-invasive marker preceding PC in children. Therefore, we suggest measuring FeNO at least at day +28 for assessment of the individual risk for PC and for early detection of pulmonary pathology after HSCT in childhood.",

However, considering our observation that elevated FeNO levels precede early PC rather than acute GvHD, it is still possible that FeNO would be predictive for chronic pulmonary GvHD, which has to be proven in further studies. Of interest, children with matched sibling donors had higher FeNO levels at day +28 than children with matched unrelated donors, which may be attributed to different GvHD prophylaxis. However, therapy with corticosteroids surprisingly did not influence the findings of our study. One could expect that children without pulmonary complications had lower FeNO levels simply because they received a higher cumulative dose of systemic steroids. In contrast, children without any PC and low FeNO levels received lower cumulative doses of steroids (114 mg/kg prednisone) until day +60 than children with PC (152 mg/kg prednisone) after day +60 and high FeNO levels.",

We expected a trend towards a higher prevalence of pulmonary complications in children with higher FeNO and found some suggestive data at day 0 and day +28. Compared with the reference values for non-transplant children, FeNO levels were generally lower in our immunosuppressed population, mainly due to high doses of systemic corticosteroids in the course of HSCT.
