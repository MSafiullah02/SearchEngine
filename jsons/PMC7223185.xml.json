            "text": "The use of cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) is necessary for the correction of many complex cardiac defects in neonates and infants. Surgical results for most defects have improved over the last several years, but there persists significant morbidity related to the inflammatory insult of CPB. CPB in combination with anaesthesia, medication, vascular injury and surgical stress affects the extent of inflammatory response. Complement system protein may be activated through the classical, alternative and lectin pathways, leading to generation of biologically active products, such as C5a and the terminal membrane attack complex (MAC), and ultimately contributes to endothelial cell disruption during CPB. Significant differences in the complement factor levels indicate a higher grade of complement activation and simultaneous contact activation in patients during and after CPB. Thus, the main cause of systemic inflammatory reaction after CPB is the contact of the blood to non-biologic surfaces of the CPB circuit and not surgical procedures or anesthesia. To lessen the activation of the complement and contact systems during CPB, it is necessary to use inert materials in the CPB circuit. Because inhibiting drugs may lessen complement and contact system activation, they represent a further possibility for minimizing the damaging effects of CPB [1].",

They found that after CPB, generalized edema, pulmonary edema, and weight gain were greater in infants with lower C1-inh levels. At 30 min post-CPB, the infants demonstrating these effects had C1-inh activity levels that were 51% of controls compared with 80% of controls in those who did not demonstrate capillary leak syndrome (CLS). This decrease was greater in infants who suffered post-CPB CLS. CLS show evidence of complement activation, decreased complement levels. We thus consecutively investigated several complement compounds before and after pediatric cardiac surgery with CPB. Based on this hypothesis, we tested whether C1-inh supplementation after CPB would ameliorate C1-inh decrease in pulmonary and cardiac dysfunction after CPB. Our prospective study was therefore designed to determine which part of the systemic inflammatory response after cardiac operations resulted from CPB in neonates and infants.",

Postoperatively, C1q concentration was only significant lower in patients with C1-inhibitor non-treated group than in patients with C1-inhibitor treated group. But, the consumption of C1q, C3, C4, CH50 and C1-inh in patients with C1-inhibitor non-treated group was observed early postoperatively. C1-inhibitor activity differed in the two groups.",

To the best of our knowledge, cardiopulmonary bypass can result in a post-CPB syndrome that is characterized by increased vascular permeability, generalized edema, pulmonary dysfunction, and cardiac dysfunction [3\u20135]. This syndrome seems to be more intense in neonates and can result in prolonged ventilation, coagulopathy, postcardiotomy cardiac failure, and increased mortality. This is a systemic inflammatory response that appears to be fueled by activation of the complement, contact, coagulation, and fibrinolytic pathways [6]. More recently, Tassani et al. have shown that prophylactic administration of C1INH before CPB is an effective therapeutic approach to reduce the inflammatory response and improve clinical parameters after cardiac surgery requiring CPB in neonates [7].",

After surgery, it impairs vascular endothelial cells in the lungs and kidneys, causes swelling of parenchymal cells, and triggers an organ failure. Therefore, multiple defense systems are established by several proteins, called complement regulators, to prevent excessive and persistent complement activation and invasion of autologous cells [8, 9]. C1-inhibitor, called C1 inactivator, covalently binds to and inhibits the active sites (serine) of activated C1r and C1s in the C1 step of the classical pathway to suppress complement activity. In addition, it inhibits, the enzymatic activities of the coagulation, kallikrein, and plasmin systems, besides the complement system. In fact, in cases deficient in congenital complement control (e.g., Hereditary Angioedema; HAE), bradykinin, as well as C3a and C5a strongly induced by the classical pathway initiated by C1 activation, is deeply involved [10].",

First, although powered to detect a difference in postoperative CLS between those who did and did not receive C1-inh, the dosage of C1-inh was relatively small and the incidence of CLS was lower in this study. It is therefore possible that the large dosage may observe the difference in those groups in large trials. Second, anesthetic management was left to the discretion of treating anesthesiologists. This may have affected the outcome given the potential differing effects of anesthetic medications on the development of postoperative CLS. Third, the limited sample size from a single center and restrictive inclusion may place some limitations on generalizability.
