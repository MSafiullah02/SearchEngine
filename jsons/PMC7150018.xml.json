This approach exists practically as long as the field of medicine itself; indeed, Hippocrates (460-370 BC) emphasized environmental factors in his \u201cTreaty of Water, Air, and Places\u201d (Hippocrates et al., 2003, Le Moal and Reis, 2011). To define the environment, we adopt words of Albert Einstein \u201cThe environment is everything that isn't me.\u201d To this notion, we introduce the concept of environmental risk factors. A systematic approach should explore the multiple dimensions of these factors: their nature, sources, carriers, spatiotemporal characteristics, interactions (multicausality), and finally, health impacts (protective/harmless/noxious) (Reis and Roman, 2007).",

Environmental risk factors also have a geographical or spatial dimension (e.g., altitude, climate). In the previous chapter, we investigated the association of air pollution and stroke, as a well-recognized example of the role of the milieu. Here, we will study environmental factors from another point of view: their nature, be it physical, chemical, or biological.

The health effects on adults of exposure to transport noise (road, air, and rail) were demonstrated first for hypertension and ischemic heart disease (Babisch, 2006). Addressing the impact of noise in stroke is quite recent; the first relevant publications appeared in 2010. Now, several years later, there is an agreement to consider that traffic noise is the second most important environmental risk factor for stroke in urban societies, after air pollution (M\u00fcnzel et al., 2017). Comparative burden of disease studies have shown that environmental noise is ranked second in terms of disability-adjusted life years lost (DALYs) in Europe (Stansfeld, 2015). Several recent reviews have addressed the epidemiological evidences (Belojevi\u0107 and Paunovi\u0107, 2016, Basner et al., 2015, M\u00fcnzel et al., 2014) and the various potential mechanisms involved (Stokholm et al., 2013).",

            "text": "Epidemiological studies about the relation between noise and stroke are sometimes contradictory. Long-term air pollution increases stroke risk, regardless of concomitant noise pollution (Hoffmann et al., 2015). Moreover, some epidemiological studies have found no associations; for instance, a study in a Danish cohort of individuals aged 50\u201364 and another in the Swiss national cohort (Huss et al., 2010) found no association between aircraft noise and stroke mortality (cited in Floud et al., 2013). However, in a Danish cohort of 57,053 people, residential road traffic noise exposure was associated with a higher risk (HR) for ischemic stroke: 14% HR per 10 dB higher exposure to noise for all participants and 27% HR per 10 dB higher exposure to noise for participants above 64.5 years. Stroke risk increased in a dose-dependent manner at exposure levels of 60 dB among the oldest participants (S\u00f8rensen et al., 2011). A cross-sectional study from six European countries used data from the Hypertension and Environmental Noise near Airports study including 4712 participants with 276 stroke cases. Members of the study population lived near the major airports in London, Amsterdam, Stockholm, Milan, Berlin, and Athens. An association between nighttime average aircraft noise and heart disease/stroke was found (after adjustment for sociodemographic confounders) for participants who had lived in the same place for \u2265 20 years (odds ratio: 1.25 per 10 dB). The association between 24-h average road traffic noise level and heart disease/stroke was also significant although the association was not adjusted for air pollution (Floud et al., 2013). In a population of 3.6 million people living near Heathrow airport, a study based on hospital admissions and mortality showed a significant excess risk of stroke and CVD. The noise intensity was investigated by grouping daytime aircraft noise and road noise into six categories from \u2264 51 to > 63 dB in increments of 3 dB and nighttime aircraft noise into 5 dB categories (\u2264 50, > 50\u201355, and > 55 dB). In multiple adjustment models, the relative risk (RR) for stroke was 1.24 for daytime aircraft noise (> 63 dB v \u2264 51 dB) and 1.29 for nighttime noise (> 55 dB v \u2264 50 dB). The RR of mortality was similar to those for hospital admissions at the higher noise levels. Thus the RR is the highest with high daytime noise levels and nighttime aircraft noise (Hansell et al., 2013). An 2009 U.S. study, recruited 6 million seniors (> 65 years) living near one of the 89 largest airports to evaluate the association between airport-related noise and the risk of hospital admission for CVD and heart failure. Despite the study's methodological limitations, a statistically significant association between exposure to aircraft noise and risk of hospitalization for CVDs was shown (Correia et al., 2013).",

As hypoxemia can be deleterious for cellular adaptation and survival, the regulatory homeostasis favors all mechanisms related to convective oxygen transport (cardiovascular, respiratory, and hematopoietic functions) that will counteract a possible cellular hypoxia (Petousi and Robbins, 2014). The first adaptative mechanism is hyperventilation which has the quickest effect. An increase in cerebral blood flow up to 31% of values measured at sea level can occur in few days (3\u20137) of a subject's transition to high altitudes. The return to sea-level base values follows, depending on the degree of the hypoxic stimulus and on the cerebrovascular sensitivity to hypoxia and carbon dioxide (Bor-Seng-Shu et al., 2012). The heart function is modified typically with tachycardia and no change in stroke volume but a slight temporary blood pressure increase. After a few days of adaptation, cardiac output returns to normal (Naeije, 2010). Supply of oxygen is favored by an adaptative release at the tissue level and an increase of the red blood cells (RBC) production. The direct effect of production is an increase of the hematocrit and the blood viscosity. Other factors contribute also to increased coagulability: namely, increases in platelets (mean platelet volume), erythrocyte aggregability, and plasma viscosity (Bor-Seng-Shu et al., 2012, Alper et al., 2009). Protection of the cellular metabolism involves hypoxia-inducible factor(s) (HIFs) (capable of inducing protective metabolites and proteins) (Kumar and Choi, 2015) as well as chemical agents such as nitric oxide (NO), carbon monoxide (CO), eicosanoid products, oxygen-derived free radicals, endothelins, K+, H+, and adenosine (Bor-Seng-Shu et al., 2012), and an control of key enzymes (Na-, K-ATPase). Oxygen-derived free radicals and H2O2, NO, and oxidized glutathione are the signaling messengers that make Na-, K-ATPase systems \u201coxygen-sensitive\u201d (Bogdanova et al., 2016).",

Although rarely reported, acute stroke is possible during short-term visits to high-altitude regions (Chan et al., 2012). Thus, stroke or stroke-like episodes have been described in association with high altitude for the first time in 1895 (Szawarski et al., 2012). Differential diagnosis must consider cerebral venous thrombosis (Chan et al., 2012) and HACO, which can mimic stroke and provoke deficits; those resolve with the resolution of cerebral oedema (Yanamandra et al., 2014). In case of stroke, an asymptomatic patent foramen ovale should be excluded (Szawarski et al., 2012, Murdoch, 2015).",

Several publications (USA, Kashmir, South America, India) have shown that the incident stroke is lower in these populations compared to populations living at sea-level and lower altitudes (Mahajan et al., 2004), to the contrary of a Saudi Arabian study (al Tahan et al., 1998). A study in Cuzco (Peru), located at 3380 m above sea level, showed a crude prevalence ratio of 6.47 per 1000 (cohort of 3246 individuals). The prevalence risk was related to age, polycythemia, high alcohol consumption, residence's area (down-town versus suburban), blood pressure, and increased hematocrit. These two last parameters may vary following altitude (Jaillard et al., 1995). In the large Swiss National Cohort, a clear dose\u2013response relationship between lifetime altitude exposure and mortality was demonstrated: mortality from coronary heart disease and stroke decreased with increases of altitude (22% per 1000 m and 12% per 1000 m, respectively). Switzerland has specific characteristics: altitude of residence between 200 and 2000 m and minimal changes in geographic latitude. However, this study has several limitations related to the methodology and the impossibility of collecting data on individual risk factors (e.g., atherosclerosis). The conclusion, that being born at higher altitude (although the range is not clear) has a protective effect, needs a clear confirmation. Possible physiological explanations could be found: solar radiation and Vit D, less air pollution, genetics, etc. (Faeh et al., 2009). In any case, these studies point to acclimatization, which differs from adaptation, as it is a long-term population-based process, involving both genetic and gene-environmental mechanisms (Petousi and Robbins, 2014). All populations living at high altitude do not show the same acclimatization. For example, at similar high altitudes, Tibetans have significantly lower hemoglobin concentrations than their Andean or Han Chinese immigrants counterparts (Petousi and Robbins, 2014); they also suffer less from chronic mountain sickness (CMS). Stroke risks should likewise be different.",

Seasonality has been observed worldwide (Chen et al., 2013a) although some studies have reported no seasonality; for instance, a study in Taiwan (Lee et al., 2008). Furthermore, the peak season differs for different countries. In Japan (Takashima stroke register), an excess of ischemic stroke fatality occurs in spring followed by winter (after adjusting for age, gender); the rates are more when compared to during summer (Turin et al., 2009). In the United States, an epidemiological study conducted in the VA hospitals showed that the peak occurrence for ischemic stroke was mid-May, with the lowest occurrence in early December. The authors emphasized that, \u201cNeither the region (i.e., climate) nor the race of the patient substantially modified the seasonal trend\u201d (Oberg et al., 2000). In Melbourne, Australia, ischemic stroke occurrence was significantly higher during spring than summer (incidence rate ratio (IRR) 1.14) (Mao et al., 2015).

            "text": "The question addressed in a 2010 paper, \u201cWhat is it with weather and stroke?\u201d (McArthur et al., 2010), remains crucial. Most evidences suggest that cold and hot apparent temperatures (which consider both air temperature and humidity) are associated with stroke mortality, as shown by the eight Large Chinese Cities Study (Chen et al., 2013a). The results show a U-shaped relationship, with increased risk at extreme high or low temperatures. The potential effect of cold temperature might last more than 2 weeks in contrast to the more immediate effect of hot temperature. However, the burden of stroke mortality is different. In the six large Chinese cities (2007\u20132013) the stroke burden was caused by cold temperature and was higher in males and seniors (Yang et al., 2016). The same patterns are known for mortality by all causes (Gasparrini et al., 2015, Medina-Ram\u00f3n et al., 2006). Several subpopulations are particularly susceptible to temperature extremes, for example, patients with atrial fibrillation (Medina-Ram\u00f3n et al., 2006). The relationship between heat waves and stroke has been addressed by several articles. Heat waves have a strong adverse effect on stroke mortality with an excess mortality of 6%\u201352% (Chen et al., 2015). A multicity case-only analysis of 50 U.S. cities showed that extremely high-temperature days posed a higher relative stroke mortality risk compared to pneumonia and CVD (Medina-Ram\u00f3n et al., 2006). Heat wave (with a 2-day lag) is significantly associated with the risk of hospitalization for stroke (odds ratio [OR] 1.173) with more significance for men and over 80 years, in a study conducted in Pennsylvania (Ha et al., 2014). A Chinese study pointed to a clear spatial pattern of stroke mortality during heat waves; the risk was higher in rural areas (Luhe district) compared to the urban area of Nanjing, probably because of a higher vulnerability of the populations; this vulnerability seems to be linked to the socioeconomic level, the air condition availability, the population's age, and the medical facilities\u2019 access (Chen et al., 2015). Obviously, further works are needed to assess the real impact of weather (characterized by temperature, humidity, sunshine duration, etc.) on stroke subtypes and pathogenesis (hemorrhagic/stroke, lacunar/atherothrombotic/cardioembolic).",

A geomagnetic storm is a temporary disturbance of the Earth's magnetosphere caused by a solar wind shock wave and/or cloud of magnetic field which interacts with the Earth's magnetic field; these are prominent during the solar maximum phase of the solar cycle. The sun has a solar cycle which averages 11 years in length; at the end of each cycle, the polar magnetic field of the sun reverses. During these cycles, there is an increased solar activity, which generally has a peak in the middle of the solar cycle. During the solar maximun, the increase of sunspots and the solar storms produce the emission of large quantities of electromagnetic and particle radiation. Theses events are known to disrupt technology such as power grids, magnetic compasses, damage satellite microchips and disturb radio and radar transmissions. The solar minimum refers to a relatively low solar activity. This takes place 5\u20136 years after the solar maximum.",

The Wismut cohort uranium mining company in Eastern Germany included 58,987 men from 1946 to 1989; 5141 deaths from heart diseases, and 1742 deaths from CVDs were observed. There was no evidence for mortality from CVDs when the ERR per unit of cumulative exposure to radon in working level months was analyzed (Kreuzer et al., 2010). Canadian authors came to the same conclusion in the Newfoundland fluorspar miners' cohort (2070 miners followed from 1950 to 2001) (Villeneuve et al., 2007). However, there are some data and clues that point to a relation between radiation and premature development of atherosclerosis (Villeneuve and Morrison, 1997, Xu and Cao, 2014, Simonetti et al., 2014).",

In a systematic review of the epidemiologic evidence, in general populations, Navas-Acien et al. (2005) showed a significant increase of the RR for stroke which ranged from 0.69 to 1.53. In an occupational population the RR for stroke mortality ranged from 0.30 to 1.33. However, the best evidence has come from Taiwan; arsenic levels in drinking water were found to be associated with CVDs, in particular with stroke, despite methodological limitations. The RR between the highest and the lowest arsenic exposure's categories ranges from 1.19 to 2.69 for stroke. This is consistent with a role for high arsenic exposure in atherosclerosis. This review and a later one (Moon et al., 2012) pointed to the inconclusiveness of the chronic low-dose exposure to arsenic. Risk assessment, based on epidemiological studies (cohort, case-control cross-sectional, and ecological studies) from the United States, Taiwan, Bangladesh, and China, proposes a no-observed-adverse-effect level of 100 \u03bcg/L for arsenic in water, equivalent to an iAs dose of 0.009 mg/kg-day (Tsuji et al., 2014).",

Persistent organic pollutants (POPs) such as chlorinated organic compounds (polychlorinated biphenyls, (PCBs), dioxins, and chlorinated pesticides) were shown to increase the CVDs\u2019 risk; dioxin exposure is associated with higher risk and mortality for CVD (Chang et al., 2011, Humblet et al., 2008). The RR for stroke was 1.17 among patients discharged from the hospital after stroke (in New York State) and living near a POPs\u2019 source (e.g., waste sites) (Shcherbatykh et al., 2005). A hospitalization population-based study from the same team (Sergeev and Carpenter, 2011) confirmed this risk: the RR for stroke with hypertension was 13.4% higher in populations residing in zip codes containing or abutting POPs\u2019 environmental sources (RR = 1.134). The Prospective Investigation of Vasculature in Uppsala Seniors (PIVUS) studied background exposure to POPs. Plasma concentrations of 21 POPs (16 PCB congeners 3 organochlorine (OC) pesticides, 1 brominated diphenyl ether (BDE), and octachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin) were measured. During the 5-year of follow-up, 35 participants (among the cohort of 898, aged at baseline over 70) developed hospital-treated stroke. After adjusting for known stroke risk factors, the PIVUS showed that POPs\u2019 plasma concentrations significantly predicted the future risk of stroke (Lee et al., 2012).",

The Vascular Effects of Infection in Pediatric Stroke (VIPS) case control study demonstrated that childhood infections, including varicella zoster virus (VZV), are associated with an increased risk of AIS. Thirty-nine percent of the cases had a parental report of infection in the prior 4 weeks and the adjusted odds ratio (OR) between infection and childhood AIS was 6.5 (95% CI 3.3\u201313, for infection in the prior week). Based on serological evidences, the VIPS study also showed that recent herpesvirus infections (VZV, Herpes Simplex Virus HSV1, HSV2, EBV, CMV) are associated with an increased risk of AIS among children (29 days to 18 years old). Acute HSV infection (serologies suggestive of primary HSV infection) was present in 40% of AIS cases. Neither subjects with past infection nor reactivated cases with latent infection serological evidence were found to be at risk (Elkind et al., 2016). Although the biologic plausibility of a cerebral arteritis induced by VZV infection appears high, the plausibility of the HSV infection's role needs further investigation (Grose, 2016).",

Zoster can be complicated by a VZV vasculopathy (Nagel and Gilden, 2015). A recent systematic review and meta-analysis (Marra et al., 2017) pooled nine studies, published between 2009 and 2016, and found that the relative risk for stroke after a VZV infection was the highest at one postinfection month (RR of 1.78) and decreased progressively to 1.20 after one year. The RR was higher for a herpes zoster ophthalmic episode (RR: 2.05) and remain elevated for one year. The questioning of Borbinha et al. \u201cShould We Pay More Attention to Varicella Zoster Infection?\u201d should be probably, answered positively as more than 50% of strokes in young adults are cryptogenic (Borbinha et al., 2016).",

The vessels can be damaged by the germs (vasculitis-angiitis), or the arterial vessel walls may develop atherosclerotic vascular lesions with inflammatory and prothrombotic alterations leading to thrombosis; embolic mechanisms can be related to infectious heart failure or directly to plasmatic circulating parasites (microembols). The outcomes are ischemic strokes (cerebral infarction) and/or hemorrhages (intracranial, subarachnoid) (Lindsberg and Grau, 2003, Sanchetee, 2009). The mechanisms of immune reactions involved in atherogenesis and the pathogenesis of stroke have also been investigated. An association of increased serum immune complexes (ICs) with stroke incidence was demonstrated. These ICs are the immune response to an acute infection preceding the stroke. C. pneumoniae or Cytomegalovirus could trigger such an immune response (Tarnacka et al., 2002).",

The environmental health approach is modifying our understanding of the causes of stroke (Boehme et al., 2017). Consequently the classical recommendations and strategies for prevention (Goldstein et al., 2011) have to be improved. Based on these new issues, physicians should better inform their communities and the policy makers about their respective roles and responsibilities. Together, we should act to reduce the impact of amenable environmental risk factors related to human activities, such as air pollution, noise, and chemical exposures.",
