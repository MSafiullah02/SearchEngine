Of the three, expectoration should be the easiest to identify.",

Gagging is the expulsion of oral or pharyngeal material and may be associated with disorders causing dysphagia (i.e., difficult swallowing) or regurgitation. The relatively minor abdominal contractions associated with gagging can often be differentiated from the vigorous abdominal contractions that occur with vomiting. Regurgitation may follow seconds to hours after eating or drinking. If only saliva is regurgitated, eating may not have occurred for hours or even days before the act. Regurgitated food material is undigested and sometimes has a tubular form conforming to the shape of the esophageal lumen. Most clients cannot reliably distinguish undigested from digested food. Regurgitated material that has remained in the esophagus for long time periods often becomes macerated and odoriferous and is mixed with saliva and mucus. If blood is present it is usually undigested (i.e., bright red), whereas blood originating from the stomach is usually partially digested by gastric acid and has a \u201ccoffee ground\u201d appearance readily distinguishing it from the undigested form.",

Vomiting may cause secondary esophagitis and subsequent regurgitation, or a patient with longstanding esophageal disease may develop another concurrent disorder causing vomiting. It is therefore important to clarify the chronologic order of specific signs. Finally, some patients with signs suggesting regurgitation are vomiting. To aid in differentiation, one may attempt to observe the act of expulsion by feeding the patient, although this is very unreliable (\u201cwatched\u201d regurgitating patients often do not regurgitate). Watching the patient eat may be helpful, because pharyngeal dysphagia is usually obvious and suggests oropharyngeal disease. Some patients with pharyngeal dysphagia also have concurrent esophageal dysfunction. Contrast radiographs of the pharynx and esophagus usually differentiate the two disorders.",

            "text": "Regurgitation is usually best evaluated by history, physical examination, plain and contrast radiographs, or esophagoscopy (Figure 9-1\n). Contrast radiographs should use barium instead of iodide contrast agents unless esophageal rupture is strongly suspected. The main purpose of a contrast esophagram is to distinguish esophageal motility abnormalities from lesions such as an obstruction, diverticulum, or fistula. Some drugs (e.g., xylazine) commonly used for restraint cause esophageal paralysis, making the radiographs potentially misleading. Esophagoscopy may not diagnose esophageal muscular weakness but is effective for sampling mass lesions, differentiating intramural from extramural obstruction, identifying esophagitis, detecting diverticula, and removing foreign objects. Patients with acquired esophageal weakness (i.e., megaesophagus) should be evaluated for myopathies, neuropathies, and myasthenia gravis (generalized or localized to the esophagus). Occasionally, hypoadrenocorticism, hyperkalemia, lead poisoning, Spirocerca lupi, and selected central nervous system (CNS) disorders (e.g., distemper, hydrocephalus) may be responsible. Generalized or localized myopathies and neuropathies have several causes, such as trauma, dermatomyositis, thymoma, botulism, tick paralysis, hypothyroidism, hyperadrenocorticism, systemic lupus erythematosus, nutritional factors, toxoplasmosis, and trypanosomiasis. Dysautonomia has been recognized in dogs and cats and causes generalized dysfunction of the autonomic nervous system, including regulation of esophageal motility. Hypothyroidism and systemic lupus erythematosus may exist without obvious clinical signs. It is important to detect these underlying disorders so that one may treat the cause rather than just the symptoms. It is also wise to evaluate patients with unexpected esophageal foreign objects (e.g., a relatively small bolus of food) for partial obstructions (e.g., subclinical vascular ring anomaly, stricture).",

Pancreatitis can occur in any dog, but middle-aged obese female dogs, schnauzers, and Yorkshire terriers seem to be most commonly affected. Vomiting may or may not be associated with eating, abdominal pain, fasting hyperlipidemia, bloody diarrhea, and rarely, diffuse subcutaneous fat necrosis. On radiographic examination, a mass or indistinctness (as the result of localized peritonitis) may be visible in the cranial right abdominal quadrant. Serum amylase and lipase activities can be measured, but false-negative and false-positive results are common, necessitating reliance on other findings. Leukocytosis with or without a left shift and with or without WBC toxicity (as the result of the sterile inflammation) and increased ALT and SAP concentrations (as the result of the proximity of the pancreas to the liver and obstruction of the biliary duct) are common. The latter occasionally causes extrahepatic biliary tract obstruction and subsequent icterus. Mild to moderate hypocalcemia may occur. Abdominal ultrasonography seems to be an excellent test for canine pancreatitis, and it usually reveals abnormalities in the pancreatic region. If a pancreatic mass is discovered during surgery, it must be biopsied; this is because chronic pancreatitis is grossly indistinguishable from pancreatic neoplasia, and both may be associated with normal or increased serum amylase and lipase values. Recently an assay for immunoreactive canine pancreatic lipase has been developed and validated (GI Laboratory at Texas A&M University); this test seems to hold promise for being a sensitive, specific test for acute pancreatitis.",

Amylase and lipase values are usually in the normal reference range; feline trypsin-like immunoreactivity (fTLI) concentrations are increased in some patients. Abdominal ultrasonography may be useful if an obvious abnormality is found, but the sensitivity of ultrasonography is uncertain. A pancreatic biopsy may be required for a definitive diagnosis.

If gastritis or enteritis is suspected or if the other major causes of chronic vomiting have been ruled out, gastric and intestinal mucosal biopsies via endoscopy or laparotomy are indicated. Inflammatory bowel disease is a significant cause of feline chronic vomiting. Duodenitis is also a significant cause of vomiting without diarrhea in dogs; therefore, both gastric and intestinal biopsies should be performed. Finally, because 10% to 20% of patients with colitis vomit, it is useful to perform endoscopy routinely on both the upper and lower intestinal tracts in patients (especially cats) with chronic vomiting. It is critical that mucosal tissue samples be taken and handled properly to avoid artifacts, which can render them nondiagnostic.",

Differentiation of EPI from malabsorptive disease is important. The diagnosis is often overlooked in afflicted dogs or may inappropriately be made in patients without the malady. Clinical trials using pancreatic enzyme preparations are commonly used to diagnose EPI. Unfortunately this method is unreliable. Powdered enzyme is often superior to tablet formulations, and some enzyme preparations are clearly superior to others. Even when appropriate enzymes are administered, some dogs with EPI also require a low-fat diet, antacid therapy (rare), or treatment for concurrent antibiotic-responsive enteropathy (ARE) (common) before the enzyme replacement therapy becomes effective. Too often, failure of the initial enzyme replacement therapy leads to unnecessary tests (i.e., exploratory laparotomy), because the correct diagnosis of EPI was incorrectly eliminated. No consistent hematologic or serum chemistry profile changes are seen, and the serum amylase and lipase values are usually normal. Undigested fats are often found in the feces; however, this is inconsistent. The fat absorption test is inexpensive but can yield false results. The TLI assay is the best test for canine EPI, and the fTLI assay is the best test for feline EPI. It is important to note that the tests are species specific.

Fecal culture is not informative, and intestinal biopsy is seldom diagnostic. A barium contrast study may identify a segmental lesion or partial obstruction responsible for secondary ARE. Quantitated culture of duodenal or proximal jejunal fluid for aerobes and anaerobes is difficult to interpret, because clinically normal dogs may have as many or more bacteria than clinically affected dogs. Finding an increased concentration of unconjugated serum bile acids is believed to be supportive of ARE. Bacteria can deconjugate serum bile acids in the intestinal lumen, and these bile acids can be absorbed by the jejunum. However, the test is limited in its availability. Serum vitamin B12 and folate concentrations have been used as screening procedures for ARE once EPI has been ruled out. Some patients with ARE have normal serum vitamin B12 and folate concentrations, however. Response to empiric antibiotic therapy supports the diagnosis.

Intestinal lymphangiectasia causes severe PLE in dogs (it is not reported in cats) and can produce some of the lowest serum protein levels (serum albumin <1.0g/dl) that occur in alimentary disease. Because of the loss of lymph into the intestines, peripheral lymphocyte counts may be decreased; hypocholesterolemia and steatorrhea are common. If hepatic insufficiency and loss from the kidneys and skin have been eliminated in a hypoalbuminemic patient, PLE becomes the major differential diagnosis by process of elimination. If PLE is suspected in a patient that has another potential explanation for its hypoalbuminemia (e.g., renal protein loss or substantive hepatic insufficiency), then detecting abnormally high concentrations of alpha-1 protease inhibitor in the feces supports a diagnosis of GI protein loss. The relatively stable alpha-1 proteinase is resistant to GI degradation and consequently can be measured in the feces. Intestinal biopsy is usually the definitive test. Full-thickness biopsy may risk dehiscence if the serum albumin level is less than 1.5g/dl; however, serosal patch graft techniques decrease the risk of dehiscence. Gastroduodenoscopy-ileoscopy plus biopsy is safe and often (but not invariably) diagnostic. Occasionally the intestinal lesion is inaccessible via endoscopy. Although not recommended, dietary trial may be used in patients with PLE. An ultra-low\u2013fat diet is reasonable if lymphangiectasia is suspected; however, therapeutic trials with steroids are potentially dangerous and are not recommended without a definitive diagnosis.",

Diagnosis may be confirmed with a history of exposure to certain toxins (TABLE 9-6, TABLE 9-7\n) or diagnosis of a systemic disease (e.g., hyperadrenocorticism) known to affect the liver. Changes in ALT, SAP, hepatic function tests, and hepatic size, although suggestive of hepatic disease, are not diagnostic of specific entities. This is true even in breeds with specific predispositions (e.g., Doberman pinschers, Bedlington terriers). Changes in the SAP or serum ALT may also be the result of primary nonhepatic disease (e.g., hyperadrenocorticism, inflammatory bowel disease, diabetes mellitus, heart failure). A definitive diagnosis usually requires hepatic biopsy. The clinician should first seek to rule out nonhepatic causes of secondary hepatic dysfunction. Hepatic biopsy should be considered in patients with obviously significant hepatic disease, those that do not have hyperadrenocorticism, and those that have persistent (more than 1 month) changes in serum ALT or SAP consistent with chronic or progressive hepatic disease or abnormal hepatic function tests (see Figure 9-5). It is not always possible to make these distinctions accurately; therefore, whenever hepatic biopsy is performed via laparotomy or laparoscopy, the rest of the abdomen should be explored and other organs sampled if the clinician doubts their involvement. Fine-needle aspirates with cytology are sometimes useful in detecting diffuse hepatic infiltrative disease and hepatic lipidosis (see Color Plate 5E); however, fine-needle aspirates (even when guided by ultrasound) often miss infiltrative processes, and a negative cytologic finding never excludes an infiltrative disease in the liver. In general, laparoscopy allows for much superior hepatic biopsies compared with ultrasound-guided biopsies.",

AST is, however, present in significant quantities in many other tissues, including muscle and RBCs; therefore, increased AST is not as specific for hepatic injury as is increased ALT. Exercise and intramuscular (IM) injections may increase serum AST. The most common causes of increased AST include hepatic disease, muscle disease (inflammation or necrosis), or hemolysis (spontaneous or artifactual). Increased AST is an indication to check for ongoing hemolysis by measuring the hematocrit and observing the color of the plasma and serum on a centrifuged blood sample. If no hemolysis is found, the next step is to measure serum ALT to determine whether the increased AST is from the liver (significant increases in both ALT and AST suggest that AST increases are of hepatic origin).",

A significantly increased fasting blood ammonia concentration renders an ATT unnecessary. Clinical signs are not well correlated with blood ammonia concentrations. An abnormal ATT result or resting ammonia value in a patient with hepatic disease is generally an indication for hepatic biopsy or a portogram. Rarely, plasma ammonia is increased because of urinary tract obstruction, especially if complicated by infection with urease-producing bacteria. Some young dogs (notably Scottish deerhounds in Great Britain) have been found to have elevated resting blood ammonia values that spontaneously return to normal as the dog ages.

If no other identifiable problems (other than weight loss or anorexia) can be pursued, a systematic search is indicated (Figure 9-9\n). One should first preclude as many causes as possible with the history and physical examination (i.e., lack of food, calorie-deficient food, inability to eat, regurgitation, vomiting and diarrhea). Next, extensive clinicopathologic screening is indicated. Imaging is considered an extension of the physical examination, and abdominal and thoracic radiographs are appropriate. Thoracic radiographs may be very revealing, even if a patient does not have coughing or abnormal lung sounds. Abdominal ultrasonography is particularly desirable and often more useful than radiographs if the operator is accomplished. If laboratory or radiographic abnormalities are not present or are unconvincing, one may repeat the tests at 1 to 3 week intervals, depending on the clinical condition of the patient, or immediately proceed to function tests, biopsies, or both. Certain hepatic and adrenal gland diseases may require such function tests.
