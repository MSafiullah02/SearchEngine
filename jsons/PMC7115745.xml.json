            "text": "Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), a viral\nrespiratory disease, first emerged in the Guangdong province in China during\nNovember 2002 [1,\n2]. Within a\nspan of a few months, the disease spread rapidly in Southeast Asia and other parts\nof the world. The epidemic spanned almost 30 countries and created a global alert\n[1, 3]. SARS is\ncharacterized by high fever, malaise, rigor, headache and dyspnoea and may progress\nto generalized interstitial infiltrates in the lungs requiring artificial\nventilation. The fatality rate may be as high as 15% [4, 5]. SARS is believed\nto have originated from healthy Himalayan palm civets (Paguma\nlarvata), a cat-like mammal closely related to the mongoose. The\ncausative organism for this disease was a coronavirus, called the SARS associated\ncoronavirus (SARS-CoV). Coronaviruses (order Nidovirales, family Coronaviridae,\ngenus Coronavirus) belong to a family of large, enveloped, positive sense, single\nstranded RNA viruses that replicate in the cytoplasm of animal host cells. The\ngenomes of the coronavirus are the largest of the RNA viruses ranging from 27 kb to\n32 kb in length. The virus varies from 100\u2013140 nm in diameter. The viral\nparticles have characteristic surface projections called peplomers, which are about\n20 nm long and 10 nm wide. This crown-like appearance\n(Latin\u2014Corona) gives the virus family its name [5].",
