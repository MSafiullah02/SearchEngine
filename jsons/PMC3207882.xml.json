We decided to use NAVA to improve the synchronization of mechanical ventilation with the child's spontaneous breathing. Sedation was reduced, midazolam was decreased to 80 \u03bcg/kg/h and sufentanil to 0.3 \u03bcg/kg/h. The child became alert.

First, there should be no specific contraindication to the placement of a nasogastric tube. Second, there should be no alkalosis or hypocapnia (in such cases there would not be sufficient diaphragmatic electrical activity). During alkalosis, the ventilatory brain centers no longer stimulate the diaphragm, and the respirator works on a backup mode, which is simply conventional ventilation. Finally, the level of sedation should not be too high, so that it does not depress brain centers that control breathing. If the sedation is too high, the Edi signal cannot be collected and the respirator works again in a backup mode. Likewise, neuromuscular connection from the respiratory center to the diaphragm must be intact. For example, NAVA cannot be used in case of post-surgical lesion of the two phrenic nerves [3] or diaphragmatic paralysis secondary to botulism [8].",

            "text": "Several factors could explain the beneficial effects observed with NAVA in these three children who had severe respiratory distress. First, asynchrony is associated with increased morbidity, a longer duration of ventilation, and a longer hospital stay [9-11]. There are few pediatric data published regarding the adverse effects of long-term asynchrony between mandatory ventilation and the respiratory efforts of children, but it has been shown that infant-ventilator asynchrony (both inspiratory and expiratory asynchrony) may affect more than 50% of the total breath duration [12]. Second, NAVA provides assistance in synchronization, as well as in pressure assistance in proportion to the measured electrical activity of the diaphragm. This helps to limit the periods of insufficient assist delivery that could induce respiratory muscle fatigue with increased oxygen consumption, and periods of over-assistance that can generate intrinsic PEEP with an inadequate increase in intrathoracic pressure [13]. NAVA can also prevent air swallowing and gastric distension by optimization of patient-ventilator synchrony [14]. Third, it is likely that NAVA can help clinician avoiding inappropriate ventilator settings that overload (or underload) respiratory muscles, preventing recovery. Finally, improvements in pulmonary gas exchange, systemic blood flow and oxygen supply to tissues which have been observed when spontaneous breathing has been maintained during mechanical ventilation with clinical improvement in the patient's condition [15], are assumed to occur in NAVA, when breathing efforts by the patient and the initiated breaths are in synchrony.",

Upper panels: After starting NAVA, (A) FiO2 gradually decreased to 21% in 12 hours, and (B) tidal volume became much more variable from one cycle to another. Middle panels: One of the most remarkable changes observed with switching to the NAVA mode was the immediate reduction in the mean airway pressure (C) and in the peak airway pressure (D) which decreased from 30 to 10 cm H2O. Bottom panels: After starting NAVA, the respiratory rate became very variable over time (E). From a mandatory frequency set at 30 breaths per minute, respiratory rate increased to 40 and 60 breaths per minute. Clinically, the breathing became easier with harmonious chest movements. (F) Edi max that it is the sum of inspiratory Edi and Edi min corresponds to the peak of electrical activity of the diaphragm.
