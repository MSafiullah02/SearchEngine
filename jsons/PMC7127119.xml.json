For example, MYCIN project is a well-known medical expert system for diagnosing infectious diseases (Buchanan & Shortliffe, 1985); ISODEPOR was developed to evaluate the muscle strength of Spanish top-competition athletes (Barreiro et al., 1997); FRBS-GP is a fuzzy rule-based system for diagnosing aphasia\u2019s subtypes and the classification of pap-smear examinations (Jantzen, Axer, & Keyserlingk, 2002).",

In building an expert system, the critical bottleneck is to obtain the knowledge of the special domain from the domain experts, which is called knowledge acquisition. In past decades, several methods and systems have been proposed to cope with this problem. However, most of these methods and systems were proposed to deal with the acquisition of domain knowledge from single expert. However, as multiple experts may have different experiences and knowledge on the same application domain, it is necessary to elicit and integrate knowledge from multiple experts in building an effective expert system. Recent literature also indicated that \u201ctime\u201d is an important parameter that might significantly affect the accuracy of inference results of an expert system; therefore, while discussing the elicitation of domain expertise from multiple experts, it becomes a much more challenging and important issue to take the \u201ctime\u201d factor into consideration (Hwang, Chen, Hwang, & Chu, 2006).",

For example, Jose, Nicholas, Jennings, Luo, and Shadbolt, 2003 developed a technique using a fuzzy repertory grid for acquiring the finite set of attributes or variables that the expert uses in a classification problem, characterizing and discriminating a set of elements. In addition, several models have been proposed to generate more meaningful rules from the repertory grid-oriented approaches, such as the EMCUD method, which can generate embedded meanings from repertory grids by defining the impacts of the constructs to each element (Hwang & Tseng, 1990). Recently, Hwang et al. (2006) indicated that, in building medical expert systems, most of the previous knowledge acquisition methods only pay attentions to the relationships between diseases and symptoms, while, the variant of the symptoms in different time scales of the diseases are not taken into account. Consider the repertory grid given in Table 1\nwhich depicts an example of eliciting knowledge for diagnosing various kinds of gastrointestinal diseases. Note that the rating of the (Acute bronchitis, Throat pain) entry is 4, which implies highly tendency for Acute bronchitis to have Throat pain. However, in practical situation, Influenza has significant appearance of Throat pain in the early time scale. What has been addressed in the repertory grid is not happened in the last time scale of acute bronchitis. For later time scale, the throat pain symptom will become not so significant. Such variant of disease symptoms with respect to different time scales cannot be precisely presented by those conventional knowledge acquisition approaches.",

Delphi has been defined by Delbecq, Van de Ven, and Gustafson (1975) as \u201ca method for systematic solicitation and collection for judgments on a particular topic through a set of carefully designed sequential questionnaires interspersed with summarized information and feedback of opinions derived from earlier responses\u201d. It has been considered a reliable qualitative research method with potential for use in problem solving, decision making, and group consensus reaching in a wide variety of areas (Cochran, 1983, Uhl, 1983). Delphi is generally characterized by three important features (Murry & Hammons, 1995):(1)Anonymous group interaction and responses.(2)Multiple iteration or rounds of questionnaires or other means of data collection with researcher-controlled statistical group responses and feedback.(3)Presentation of statistical group responses.\n",

KAMET consists of five main components, namely, knowledge elicitation module, knowledge transformation module, Delphi-oriented Group Decision Module and Expertise Integration Module. The knowledge acquisition module is a web-based knowledge elicitation tool with KAMET approach, which provides facilities of retrieving, maintaining, creating, and storing knowledge. The knowledge transformation module can transform domain expertise into the rule-based knowledge format of some inference engine. The Delphi-oriented Group Decision Module is implemented based on the Delphi technology (Murry & Hammons, 1995). It employs anonymous controlled-feedback procedures to assist multiple experts in determining elements, constructs and number of times scales for each element during the knowledge acquisition process. The Expertise Integration Module employs a set of knowledge integration rules to integrate ratings, certainty degrees and importance degrees of corresponding element/construct relationships.",
