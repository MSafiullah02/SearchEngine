A zoonotic disease may be a virus, parasite, fungus, or bacteria. Most viruses transferred in this way are manifested by a mild respiratory infection similar to the common cold. However, occasionally a zoonosis or zoonotic disease can be fatal or even cause a pandemic.",

Zoonotic diseases are not new. Historically, the great pandemic of Spanish flu is theorized to have originated in bats (Oxford et al., 2005). More recently, swine flu and avian (bird) flu have been characterized as zoonotic conditions (Richard, DeGraaf, & Herfst, 2014). Ebola virus is hypothesized to have originated among bats or nonhuman primates (CDC, 2019).",

An article by McAlester, Cesario, and Kirkland (2020) in this issue of Nursing for Women\u2019s Health is particularly timely because of the recent emergence of a novel coronavirus in Wuhan, China. At this time, the virus is said to be a zoonosis of unknown etiology but a contagion of potential major virulence. It remains to be seen what the future holds for this latest zoonotic infection. Currently, quarantines are being implemented in areas of greater incidence. The New England Journal of Medicine (2020) has initiated a new website to compile information as it develops, and the CDC (2020) has a dedicated webpage as well.It is wise for all health care providers to stay abreast of updates on the latest coronavirus and to provide accurate health education to clients while acknowledging that data and guidelines are apt to change\n",
