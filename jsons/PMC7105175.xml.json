In individuals over 65 years of age, it is one of the major causes of death and the greatest cause of death from infectious disease.1 The fact that it continues to be a problem is shown by a recent study that reports an increase of up to 8.8% in hospitalizations in recent years, and increased rates of infection caused by enterobacteriaceae.2\n",

Readmission after CAP was also required in up to 18% of cases, either for the same pneumonia or for extrapulmonary (primarily cardiovascular) complications,4 and reincorporation into activities of daily living was also delayed, particularly in elderly patients. Prognostic scales, then, should perhaps not be limited to evaluating short-term or in-hospital mortality, but instead should be designed to predict other variables that are important in the survival and quality of life of CAP patients.",

Along the same lines, it would be relatively easy to add comorbidities and oxygen saturation to the previously used scales CURB-65 (DS-CURB-65).5 In conventional scales, age is one of the most weighted variables, and this can distort the score: one way to correct this in subjects over 76 years of age may be to incorporate SOAR (oxygen saturation, age and respiratory rate). This approach has shown greater sensitivity for predicting mortality than the CRB-65, but its specificity is low.",
