            "text": "The presence of underlying cardiovascular disease and/or risk factors was common in patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS). In SARS, cardiovascular disease or diabetes mellitus were reported in about 8% and 11% of cases, respectively,11 and the presence of either of the two was associated with a 12-fold higher risk of mortality.12 In MERS, about 30% of patients presented with a cardiovascular disease, and the prevalence of cardiovascular comorbidities was even higher (50% had hypertension, 50% diabetes mellitus and 16% obesity).13 Similarly, several small cross-sectional studies from China have supported the notion that patients with underlying cardiovascular disease and/or cardiovascular risk factors are at higher risk of developing COVID-19, especially its most severe manifestations. However, an accurate estimation of the prevalence and prognostic impact of cardiovascular disease and risk factors is limited by the lack of standardisation in COVID-19 testing and data collection between different countries as well as the inhomogeneous definitions of cardiovascular disease and the retrospective enrolment with different inclusion criteria in the epidemiological studies published so far. In a recent meta-analysis on 10 cross-sectional studies inclusive of 3403 hospitalised COVID-19 patients from China, the pooled prevalence of cardiovascular disease, smoking history, hypertension and diabetes was 12.11%, 7.63%, 16.37% and 7.87%, respectively.14 Similarly, a systematic review on 3470 COVID-19 patients from 72 studies (including case reports, case series, case\u2013control and cross-sectional studies) from different countries (mostly China) reported a pooled prevalence of cardiovascular disease, hypertension and diabetes of 8.3%, 13.3%, and 7.3%, respectively.15 A recent study on 476 COVID-19 patients from three Chinese hospitals underscored that the incidence of cardiovascular comorbidities was higher in those with either severe or critical manifestations compared to those with a moderate clinical presentation.16 Analogously, a metanalysis on 1527 COVID-19 patients reported higher incidences of cardiovascular disease (three-fold), hypertension (two-fold) and diabetes (two-fold) among those who required intensive care unit (ICU) admission compared to non-ICU counterparts.17",

In Italy, the first western country to be struck by COVID-19, the fatality rate was particularly high (13% as of April 9).22 The fatality rate rises steeply with age and is higher in men (67% of cases). Overall, 96.7% of deceased patients had at least one comorbidity: 14.4% had one, 20.5% had two and 61.9% had three or more comorbidities; hypertension was present in 70%, diabetes in 32%, ischaemic heart disease in 28%, atrial fibrillation in 23%, chronic renal failure in 23%, chronic lung disease in 18%, HF in 16% and stroke in 11% of patients.",

In a study on 113 COVID-19 deceased patients, common complications included acute cardiac injury (77%), HF (49%), acute kidney injury (25%) and hypoxic encephalopathy (20%); patients with cardiovascular comorbidity were more likely to develop cardiac complications.23 Guo et al.24 investigated the association between cardiovascular disease/risk factors and myocardial injury with fatal outcomes in 187 hospitalised patients with COVID-19 (43 died; 144 discharged). In that study, 35% had an underlying cardiovascular comorbidity (hypertension, coronary heart disease, or cardiomyopathy), and 28% showed evidence of acute myocardial injury (defined as troponin T (TnT) >99th percentile upper limit). Patients with high TnT levels were older, more likely to be men and had more comorbidities including hypertension, coronary heart disease, cardiomyopathy and chronic kidney disease. Patients with a high TnT level showed a higher incidence of complications such as acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), malignant arrhythmias, acute renal injury and acute coagulopathy. The mortality during hospitalisation was 7.62% (eight of 105) for patients without underlying cardiovascular disease and normal TnT levels, 13.33% for those with underlying cardiovascular disease and normal TnT, 37.50% for those without underlying cardiovascular disease but elevated TnT and 69.44% for those with underlying cardiovascular disease and elevated TnT.24",

            "text": "It has been hypothesised that patients with cardiovascular risk factors or cardiovascular disease are disproportionately affected by COVID-19 because widely used medications such as angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEis) or angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) increase the susceptibility to infection by SARS-CoV-2 and viral replication. This point has been discussed extensively in a dedicated review.25 Briefly, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is a key counter-regulatory enzyme that degrades angiotensin II to angiotensin 1\u20137 thereby attenuating its effects on vasoconstriction, sodium retention and fibrosis.25 SARS-CoV-2 appears not only to gain initial entry through ACE2 but also subsequently to down-regulate ACE2 expression such that the enzyme is unable to exert protective effects in organs. Down-regulation of ACE2 activity in the lungs facilitates the initial neutrophil infiltration in response to bacterial endotoxin and may result in unopposed angiotensin II accumulation and local renin\u2013angiotensin\u2013aldosterone system (RAAS) activation.25\u201328 In a small study, patients with COVID-19 appeared to have elevated levels of plasma angiotensin II, which were in turn correlated with total viral load and the degree of lung injury.27 Dysregulated ACE2 may theoretically also attenuate cardiac protection in the setting of myocardial involvement and abnormal pulmonary haemodynamics in COVID-19.29,30 ACEis and ARBs are known to induce ACE2 expression: on the one hand they would promote SARS-CoV-2 infection, on the other hand they would activate the ACE2/angiotensin 1\u20137/Mas receptor axis, which exerts beneficial antihypertrophic, antifibrotic, antioxidant and vasodilating effects in different tissues.25 Previous studies, performed before the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic outbreak, demonstrated that ACEis and ARBs have significant immunomodulatory effects and protect against acute lung injury by blocking the classic ACE pathway.31\u201333 Currently it is still uncertain if effects on ACE2 expression are uniform across different drug classes acting on the RAAS (for example, ACEis or ARBs), and even in response to different drugs from the same class.25,34 Moreover, there are currently no experimental or clinical data demonstrating beneficial or adverse outcomes with the background use of ACEis, ARBs or other RAAS antagonists in COVID-19 patients.25 For this reason, the European Society of Cardiology (ESC), Heart Failure Society of America, American College of Cardiology and American Heart Association have recommended to continue RAAS antagonists for those patients who are currently prescribed such agents for indications for which these agents are known to be beneficial, such as HF, hypertension, or ischaemic heart disease. In the event that patients with cardiovascular disease are diagnosed with COVID-19, individualised treatment decisions should be made according to each patient\u2019s haemodynamic status and clinical presentation.35,36",

First, many antiviral, anti-inflammatory and cardiovascular drugs (such as anticoagulants, antiplatelets, anti-arrhythmics and statins) are inhibitors of the P-glycoprotein transporter and/or the cytochrome P450: their co-administration may significantly increase drug concentrations and cause potentially serious adverse effects (bleeding, arrhythmias). Second, the use of corticosteroids, convalescent plasma or intravenous immunoglobulin in COVID-19 patients may precipitate HF decompensations because of the haemodynamic effects of sodium/water retention. Third, many antiviral, antibiotics and anti-inflammatory agents may induce conduction abnormalities and QTc prolongation, necessitating careful electrocardiographic monitoring, particularly in patients affected by structural heart disease or treated with anti-arrhythmic drugs: this is the case with chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin.
