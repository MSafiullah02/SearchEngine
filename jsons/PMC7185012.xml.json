In this context low testosterone levels can cause a reduction of respiratory muscles activity and overall strength and exercise capacity [10], whilst normal circulating testosterone levels show a protective effect on several respiratory outcomes (i.e. forced expiratory volume in one second- FEV1, and  forced vital capacity - FVC) [11]. A randomized controlled trial reported an improvement in peak oxygen consumption in men receiving testosterone replacement therapy [12]. SARS-CoV2 infects lung alveolar epithelial cells using as an entry receptor the angiotensin-converting enzyme II (ACE2) [13]. ACE2 plays a role in lung protection and therefore viral binding to this receptor may deregulate a lung protective pathway [14]. Interestingly, studies showed that ACE2 is a constitutive product of adult-type Leydig cells [15], thus implying a role in testicular function and suggesting a possible involvement of testicle in COVID-19 infected patients, a factor which may affect testosterone secretion.",

Reduction of cytokine activity and/or their receptors (anti-cytokine therapy), can be useful for treatment. In this context testosterone may downregulate inflammation. As a matter of fact, several studies carried out both in animals and humans showed that hypogonadism is associated with increased pro-inflammatory cytokines and that testosterone treatment reduces IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, and TNF-\u03b1 [16]. Furthermore, the association between an increase of pro-inflammatory state and decline in testosterone is often observed in aging men [17] and in men with stable coronary artery disease [18]. Based on the above considerations, the hypothesis arises that testosterone may have a role in the cascade of events leading to progression of COVID-19 infection due to the cytokine storm. Suppression of ACE2 expression by inflammatory cytokines accompanied by the decrease of androgens and estrogens of the elderly, may establish a negative correlation between ACE2 expression and COVID-19 mortality [19].",

This is based on the androgen receptor activation of the transcription of a transmembrane protease, serine 2 (TMPRSS2), exploring possible implications in risk stratification and transmissibility of COVID-19 infection [21]. Although other proteases were described to activate the COVID-19 spikes in vitro, only TMPRSS2 activity is regarded as essential for viral spread and pathogenesis in the infected hosts [22]. TMPRSS2 may also cleave ACE2 for augmented viral entry [23]. Androgen receptor activity has been considered a requirement for the transcription of TMPRSS2 gene as no other known TMPRSS2 gene promoter has been reported to exert the same action in humans [24,25]. The modulation of TMPRSS2 expression by testosterone has been suggested to contribute to male predominance of COVID-19 infection [26]. Finally, TMPRSS2 is both the most frequently altered gene in primary prostate cancer and a critical factor enabling cellular infection by SARS-CoV-2 [24]. The hyper adrogenic phenotype could explain the COVID-19 positivity in those few young males with severe COVID-19 infection [27], possibly with shorter AR CAG lengths, who are at greater risk of developing prostate cancer because higher receptor transcription activity [28].",
