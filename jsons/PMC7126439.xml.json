            "text": "The coiled coil is among the most ubiquitous structural motifs in proteins consisting of interwound \u03b1 helices that pack in parallel or antiparallel orientations, with a distinct preference for the parallel orientation (Gruber and Lupas, 2003, Kohn et al., 1997). Coiled-coil proteins contain a short-range seven-residue (heptad) sequence repeat, (a-b-c-d-e-f-g)n, with a predominance of the aliphatic side chains Leu, Ile, Val, and Ala at the a and d positions, and polar residues generally elsewhere (Hodges et al., 1972, Lupas et al., 1991, McLachlan and Stewart, 1975, Parry, 1982). This characteristic 3-4 hydrophobic polar residue pattern is the basis of Crick's canonical \u201cknobs-into-holes\u201d core packing between \u03b1 helices and represents an essential structural feature of the coiled-coil family (Crick, 1953, Hodges et al., 1972, Lupas et al., 1991, McLachlan and Stewart, 1975, Parry, 1982). Residues at the e and g positions are frequently charged, and have been shown to influence the number and orientation of chains in a supercoil through interhelical electrostatic interactions (Kohn et al., 1995, Kohn et al., 1998, Krylov et al., 1994, O'Shea et al., 1992, O'Shea et al., 1993). Substantial progress has been achieved toward understanding the main factors that specify and stabilize parallel coiled-coil conformations (Bryson et al., 1995, Gonzalez et al., 1996, Harbury et al., 1993, Ogihara et al., 1997).",

            "text": "The determinants of antiparallel coiled-coil structure are less well understood (Kohn et al., 1997, Monera et al., 1996, Oakley and Hollenbeck, 2001, Oakley and Kim, 1998). DeGrado and coworkers have characterized a series of peptides designed to form four-stranded, antiparallel coiled coils (Bryson et al., 1995, North et al., 2001). One member of this class, \u03b11B, contains leucine residues at the a, d, and g positions and forms a helical tetramer in solution (Ho and DeGrado, 1987). In 1993, Muller-Hill and coworkers presented genetic evidence that the C-terminal heptad repeat region of the lac repressor can self-associate into an antiparallel four-helix bundle (Alberti et al., 1993). They emphasized that uncharged amino acids at the e and g positions are required to specify this tetrameric structure (Alberti et al., 1993). Fairman and coworkers subsequently showed that a 21-residue peptide corresponding to the lac repressor heptad repeat region (called Lac21) forms a stably folded, antiparallel, \u03b1-helical tetramer in solution (Fairman et al., 1995). The crystal structure of the lac repressor confirmed that residues at the a, d, and e positions of this tetrameric coiled coil participate in interhelical hydrophobic interactions (Friedman et al., 1995, Lewis et al., 1996). The Richardsons first identified conserved features of a tightly packed, antiparallel helical bundle structure, the Alacoil (Gernert et al., 1995), in which the backbones of two neighboring helices are offset by half a turn with alanine in position g (ferritin-type Alacoils) or by a full turn with alanine at position e (rop-type Alacoils). Experimental studies of the Lac21 peptide model of a ferritin-type Alacoil show that the presence of neutral amino acids at the e and g positions indeed contributes to folding and stability (Fairman et al., 1995, Fairman et al., 1996, Solan et al., 2002). In connection with this, we note that introducing alanine into the e position of the GCN4 dimeric leucine zipper creates tetramers (Krylov et al., 1994).",

            "text": "Recent crystallographic studies of the tetrameric domain of the SARS coronavirus S2 protein identify an antiparallel, four-stranded coiled coil in which leucine or isoleucine residues at the d positions comprise the hydrophobic core, while bulky a and g side chains pack against the outer surface of the core (Y.D., J.L., Q.Z., and M.L., unpublished data). In light of the results discussed above, this interaction involving the positions a, d, and g of the heptad repeat raises the possibility that a distinct hydrophobic residue pattern (a 3-3-1 hydrophobic repeat) might be sufficient to specify a superhelical fold in which four \u03b1 helices align in an antiparallel relative orientation. To test this hypothesis, we have engineered mutations of the g side chains in the GCN4 leucine zipper model which has served as an invaluable test bed for defining determinants of coiled-coil structure (Harbury et al., 1993, Harbury et al., 1998). We simultaneously changed three charged residues at the g positions in the classical GCN4-pR sequence to nonpolar Ala and Val side chains. In contrast to the parent dimeric structure with the helices parallel (O'Shea et al., 1991), both mutant peptides form discrete, stable, \u03b1-helical tetramers in solution. Their X-ray crystal structures reveal antiparallel, four-stranded coiled coils with combined knobs-into-knobs and knobs-into-holes packing interactions between the hydrophobic a, d, and g side chains. Thus, the 3-3-1 hydrophobic pattern in the heptad repeat represents an extension of the Alacoil motif in nature for mediating protein-protein interactions via coiled coils. Our results suggest that the structural selectivity of conserved, charged residues at the e and g positions of leucine zipper dimers results not only from favorable interhelical electrostatic interactions, but also from the necessary destabilization (negative design) of alternate coiled-coil conformations.",

The apolar interface of the parent double-stranded coiled coil is formed by interhelical association in a parallel orientation between residues at the a and d positions (O'Shea et al., 1991). Electrostatic interactions between oppositely charged amino acid residues at the e and g positions of different helices also can contribute to dimerization specificity (Kohn et al., 1998, O'Shea et al., 1992, O'Shea et al., 1993). The recombinant leucine zipper peptide GCN4-pR includes four g positions: Lys9, Lys16, Glu23, and Leu30 (\nFigure 1). To investigate the effect of a 3-3-1 hydrophobic residue repeat on helix association and interface specificity, we simultaneously mutated Lys9, Lys16, and Glu23 of GCN4-pR to the small aliphatic amino acids alanine and valine. The resulting mutants were designated GCN4-pA and GCN4-pV, respectively. These leucine zipper peptides were expressed in Escherichia coli and purified by reverse-phase HPLC.",

As hypothesized, GCN4-pA adopts a left-handed superhelix consisting of four antiparallel \u03b1-helical peptide monomers in register that cross at an angle of approximately 20\u00b0 (\nFigure 3). The superhelix forms a cylinder with overall diameter of \u223c24 \u00c5 and length of \u223c48 \u00c5. Diagonally related helices have identical relative orientation. The individual helices in the tetramer can be superimposed on each other with an rms deviation for \u03b1-carbon atoms of 0.30\u20130.51 \u00c5 and with the largest deviations occurring at their ends. The distance between the axes of parallel helices (on diagonal) is \u223c14 \u00c5, whereas that between the axes of adjacent antiparallel helices is \u223c8 \u00c5, an Alacoil characteristic. However, the leucine residues at the d positions interact between parallel helices and point into the core of the tetramer (see Discussion). Cross-sectional layers containing leucine alternate between 2-fold symmetrical pairs of parallel helices. Fourteen of the 16 leucine side chains assume \u03c71 and \u03c72 dihedral angles near \u221265\u00b0, 175\u00b0 or \u2212177\u00b0, 65\u00b0, corresponding to their most favored rotamers in \u03b1 helices (Lovell et al., 2000, Ponder and Richards, 1987).

By contrast, adjacent antiparallel helices adopt a new kind of knobs-into-holes interaction in which each leucine knob at the d position of one helix packs into a hole formed by the a and g residues of one neighboring helix and by two d residues in adjacent layers along the superhelical axis (\nFigure 5). This geometry results in a similar placement of atoms around the side chains at positions a and g. Knobs formed by a residues of one helix fit into holes formed by the spaces between the d and e residues on the neighboring helix and by two a residues in adjacent layers along the superhelical axis. Similarly, knobs at g positions pack into holes formed by the c and d residues of the neighboring helix and by two g residues in adjacent layers. Thus, the a, d, and g residues of the heptad repeat segregate into four geometrically distinct helix-helix interfaces. Consequently, the GCN4-pA and GCN4-pV superhelices have alternating rectangular cross-sections.",

On the other hand, the lac repressor tetramerization domain (Kercher et al., 1997) and the WSPLB 21\u201352 model (Slovic et al., 2005) are of the ferritin type. There are substantial differences in the interior packing of the tetramer among each of these structures (\nFigure 6). Each type of Alacoil can exhibit at least two modes of core packing arrangements: the well-known a,d pattern (WSPLB and Rop), and a triad a,d,e (the lac repressor tetramerization domain) or a,d,g as in GCN4-pA and GCN4-pV. The packing properties in each of these cases are clearly revealed by calculating the extent of buried surface areas of the side chains at these heptad positions (Figure 6D). We see that each packing mode has a signature in surface areas. For the a,d packing, for example, both a and d side chains show nearly complete burial at these sites. Conversely, the a,d,e and a,d,g patterns show lower burial values at either of the a and d sites. Thus, surface burial provides a useful diagnostic for each core packing interaction.",

In this tetramer conformation, the a, d, and g residues form a left-handed apolar strip along the surface of the right-handed \u03b1 helices, while their side chains mesh between interacting helices by the winding of antiparallel chains around one another. This motif adds an additional element to the current repertoire of coiled-coil structures: the hydrophobic core is formed by interlocking of residues at positions a and d in rop (Banner et al., 1987) but at positions a, d, and g in both GCN4-pA and GCN4-pV. The 3-3-1 hydrophobic residue repeat retains two structural features of coiled coils predicted by Crick from helical net diagrams (Crick, 1953): an interhelix packing angle near 20\u00b0 and knobs-into-holes packing of side chains between adjacent helices. Our results support the notion that the stoichiometry and geometry of coiled coils can be determined by distinctive hydrophobic patterns within the classical heptad repeat (Lupas and Gruber, 2005).",

            "text": "One major challenge in protein design is to engineer conformational specificity in addition to thermodynamic stability (Bryson et al., 1995). Buried polar interactions of appropriate geometry have been shown to impart specificity (structural uniqueness) in protein folding and design even if they do so at the expense of stability (Hendsch et al., 1996). For example, a buried hydrogen bond between Asn residues in the GCN4 leucine zipper is responsible for maintaining the register of the two parallel helices in the dimer structure (Harbury et al., 1993). It is tempting to apply a similar argument to explain why the 3-3-1 hydrophobic repeat is not typically found in coiled-coil proteins. Crick pointed out in 1953 that coiled coils contain fewer hydrophobic side chains than globular proteins (Crick, 1953). Here we find that increasing the hydrophobic side chain content of the GCN4 leucine zipper can lead to enhanced stabilization of the resulting structure. The highly stable antiparallel, symmetric 3-3-1 tetramer might present a functionally compromised conformational trap, as we argue to be the case in the SARS S2 protein (Y.D., J.L., Q.Z., and M.L., unpublished data). Consistent with this notion, there is growing evidence that polymorphic interactions between two heptad repeat regions in viral envelope proteins provide a reservoir of free energy that can be released to drive structural transitions in a precise temporal sequence that is required for membrane fusion (Y.D., J.L., Q.Z., and M.L., unpublished data).",

            "text": "Specificity in coiled coils (in terms of oligomeric state and strand orientation) stems in part from the precise complementarity of hydrophobic residues at the a and d positions (Bryson et al., 1995, Harbury et al., 1993), and to a larger extent from buried polar interactions (hydrogen bonds and ion pairs) that mildly destabilize the native structure yet strongly destabilize alternate conformations (Hendsch et al., 1996). While interactions between charged side chains at the e and g positions have previously been implicated in determination of helix orientation, number, and heterogeneity, their precise role has been the subject of some controversy (Lavigne et al., 1996, Lumb and Kim, 1995). Recent studies have revealed that electrostatic effects are complex, including both stabilizing and destabilizing interactions (Garcia-Mayoral et al., 2003, Marti and Bosshard, 2003, Marti and Bosshard, 2004). Changes in the free energy of the unfolded state may account for the effects of electrostatic interactions rather than differences in the stability of the native state per se. In all cases, however, the net free energy contributions of a pair of opposite charges at the e and g positions are small (\u223c1 kcal/mol or less), although there can be a stronger repulsive interaction between similar charged side chains at these positions (Jelesarov and Bosshard, 1996, Kohn et al., 1995, Lavigne et al., 1996, O'Shea et al., 1993). The finding that replacing g residues by nonpolar side chains in a dimeric coiled coil can switch both stoichiometry and helix orientation to produce a tetramer structure of enhanced stability suggests that the selection of charged or polar side chains at the g positions might provide an additional mechanism to regulate structural features of interfacial interaction specificity. For example, to restrict a given interaction exclusively to a parallel coiled coil might necessitate extensive charges at the e and g positions in order to avoid the potential trap represented by the antiparallel 3-3-1 tetramer. Indeed, a significant fraction of these positions in a protein such as myosin contains charged or polar residues (Li et al., 2003). It should be noted that while the 3-4 heptad sequence regularity has led to the successful development of prediction algorithms to identify potential coiled-coil domains from primary amino acid sequence (Lupas, 1997, Wolf et al., 1997), the 3-3-1 hydrophobic pattern is poorly accommodated in these algorithms. Accurate prediction of diverse coiled-coil interaction motifs will require an expanded understanding of the principles governing hydrophobic heptad repeat patterns.",

Data for all crystals were indexed and reduced with DENZO/SCALEPACK (Otwinowski and Minor, 1997). The CCP4 set of programs was used for truncating and scaling the data sets (CCP4, 1994). One selenium site (corresponding to the GCN4-pA M14 position) in the asymmetric unit was located with Solve (Terwilliger and Berendzen, 1999), and approximately 80% of the polypeptide chain was traced automatically into the electron density maps. Iterative rounds of model building with O (Jones et al., 1991), refinement with Refmac (Murshudov et al., 1997), and addition of ordered solvent clarified the trace except for a few residues at the helix termini. The structures of GCN4-pA and GCN4-pV were solved by molecular replacement with Phaser (Storoni et al., 2004) using the GCN4-pA/SeMet structure as a search model. All main chain torsional angles fall within the helical regions of the Ramachandran plot. Figures were generated using SETOR (Evans, 1993) and Insight II (Accelrys, San Diego, CA).",
