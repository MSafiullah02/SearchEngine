Our aim was to design and test an affordable and easy-to-build noninvasive bilevel pressure ventilator to allow reducing the serious shortage of ventilators in LMICs. METHODS: The ventilator was built using off-the-shelf materials available via e-commerce and was based on a high-pressure blower, two pressure transducers and an Arduino Nano controller with a digital display (total retail cost <75 US$), with construction details open source provided for free replication. The ventilator was evaluated (and compared with a commercially available device (Lumis-150, Resmed): a) in the bench using an actively breathing patient simulator mimicking a range of obstructive/restrictive disease and b) in 12 healthy volunteers wearing a high airway resistance and thoracic/abdominal bands to mimic obstructive/restrictive patients.",

CONCLUSION: The low-cost, easy-to-build non-invasive ventilator performs similarly as a high-quality commercial device, with its open-source hardware description, will allow for free replication and use in LMICs, facilitating application of this life-saving therapy to patients who otherwise could not be treated.",

Although positive pressure ventilation in low-and middleincome countries (LMIC) is most frequently provided invasively, the benefits of NIV are being increasingly recognised. Indeed, for obvious reasons of cost and ease of use, NIV appears to be not only an effective, but also a particularly suitable approach to provide respiratory support in patients living in developing low-income economies (2) . This is especially relevant since in these regions the burden of critical illness is large, and is expected to increase with growing urbanization, emerging epidemics and expanding access to hospitals (2) . Furthermore, the elevated cost of healthcare staffing, infrastructure needs, and onerous access to supplies have hampered the development of fully equipped intensive care units (ICU) in LMICs (3) . As a consequence, the demand for cost-effective medical equipment, such as mechanical ventilators, is likely to greatly increase in those countries. Moreover, mechanical ventilators are costly, which markedly restricts their availability, and consequently the ability to adequately treat a significant number of patients with both acute and chronic respiratory failure in LMICs.",

            "text": "Philanthropic donation of medical devices may help in providing mechanical ventilators to un-resourced regions in LMICs, but these initiatives are fraught with considerable limitations. Indeed, donation of commercially available equipment is expensive and is only partially effective since it has been reported that up to 50% of donated devices become unusable due to lack of adequate maintenance and inability to obtain spare parts (6) . In addition, donations are hardly sustainable because they require long-term commitments such as to provide device servicing. In this context, alternative solutions that are based on in-house manufacturing of pressure support devices (7, 8) could reduce the serious shortage of ventilators in LMICs. Accordingly, the aim of this study was to design and test a novel low-cost bilevel pressure support ventilator, and provide open access to the detailed technical information, thereby allowing for free and unrestricted replication and implementation. To ascertain adequate performance of the device, bench testing was carried out based on simulated patients with obstructive/restrictive diseases under well-controlled conditions, a common widely accepted approach to test therapeutic devices for respiratory support (9) (10) (11) (12) (13) (14) (15) (16) (17) (18) . Then, and following the existent literature (19) (20) (21) , the prototype ventilator was tested in healthy volunteers subjected to obstructive-restrictive loaded breathing to mimic patients with respiratory diseases requiring NIV.",

The prototype was built using off-the-shelf materials available via e-commerce: a high-pressure blower and its driver (WM7040, Ning Bo Feng Hua Wei Cheng Motor Factory, Zhejiang, China), two pressure transducers (XGZP6847005KPG, CFSensor, Wuhu, Anhui, China) and an Arduino Nano controller with a digital display. Pressure and flow were continuously measured at the outlet of the ventilator and fed into the controller which was provided with a custom-made code to detect inspirations and expirations and to accordingly trigger the inspiratory and expiratory pressures generated by the blower. The ventilator can operate in timed or spontaneous timed (ST) mode (spontaneous breaths of patients are assisted and if the patient's effort is not detected a timed breath is triggered according to a rescue frequency). The retail cost of this ventilator prototype was below 75 US$, and includes all required electronic circuits and power source. Noteworthy, this cost could be considerably reduced by wholesale purchasing. All the technical information and detailed circuit schematics and controller code required to build this ventilator (including optional enclosure by conventional 3D printer) is available for release under free terms following the open-source hardware approach in the online supplement (Technical_Description.zip) .

The passive component of the respiratory system model was a variable resistance-compliance (R-C) lung model (Adult SmartLung, IMT Analytics, Switzerland). To implement an active breathing model, the passive R-C system simulating the lungs was enclosed in a cylindrical box connected to a negative pressure source (Figure 2 ), as explained in detail in the online supplement (Supplementary_Methods&Results.pdf). Figure 3 shows examples of the simulated pleural pressures applied to the passive model to implement active patient models, which combined 2 breathing frequencies (15 and 20 breaths/min) and 3 negative peak pressure amplitudes (-6, -9, -12 cm H 2 O). Four respiratory R-C systems were set for testing the ventilator, mimicking a patient with mild disease, a purely obstructive patient (increased R), a purely restrictive patient (reduced compliance) and a patient with both obstruction and restriction (Table 1) . Two breathing frequencies were used and different inspiratory efforts were set according to the level of disease ( Table 1 ). As shown in ",

To mimic the respiratory load corresponding to a patient requiring NIV the volunteers were instrumented to increase their airway resistance and to decrease their respiratory compliance, as explained in detail in the online supplement (Supplementary_Methods&Results.pdf). The protocol was carried out by one respiratory physiotherapist expert in NIV. The volunteer subject was sitting in a comfortable armchair and was equipped with a finger pulse oximeter for monitoring oxygen saturation (WristOx 2 , Model 3150, Nonin Medical, Plymouth).

After that period of loaded breathing, the volunteer was asked to score his/her breathing discomfort sensation on a visual analog scale where 1 would correspond to spontaneous normal breathing and 10 to the maximum breathing discomfort he/she could consider unbearable. Then, he/she was connected to a mechanical ventilator with inspiratory and expiratory pressures set to 16 and 6 cmH 2 O, respectively, in spontaneous trigger (ST) mode with a backup frequency of 12 breaths/min. This ventilator was either the prototype under test or a commercially available highperformance device (Lumis 150, VPAP ST, Resmed; default settings), determined at random. At the end of a 2 min period, the subject was again asked to score his/her breathing discomfort and, without interruption nor notice to the subject, the ventilator was shifted to the other device for 2 min and then the volunteer was asked again for scoring discomfort. This process of alternating the ventilator (prototype or commercial) was repeated twice more. The discomfort scoring finally assigned to each ventilator was the mean score of the 3 periods corresponding to each device.

In a time when the most complex devices appear to be needed and can only be provided by a very competitive and specialized industry, the simplicity and performance of this designed low cost device reminds us of the need to go back to the basics, inasmuch as the rationale and implementation of NIV has not changed substantially from the pioneering times when this therapy was developed (24) .",

            "text": "The 16 different bench test settings (Table 1) used to test the ventilator covered the wide range of conditions that non-invasive ventilators are exposed to in real-life clinical applications. The bench test showed that, regardless of the stressing test conditions, the prototype ventilator provided the target bilevel pressures (Figure 5 .A) with no faulty triggering or cycling, and with a suitable triggering delay ( Figure 5 .B), thereby enabling good synchronization with the inspiratory effort of the simulated patient. The relative simplicity of the feedback control system in the prototype ventilator explains the slightly different shape of pressure waveform observed over the wide range of test conditions ( Figure 5 .A), and also facilitates interpretation of the determinants of the small increases in peak inspiratory pressures. Whereas the commercial device applied an almost square pressure signal, the pressure waveform generated by the prototype exhibited progressive increase and decrease in inspiratory pressures (Figure 4 ). This is consistent with the fact that the commercial device used as a comparator was probably equipped with a more powerful (and hence expensive) feedback system to control its blower. However, several other commercially available ventilators exhibit patterns of inspiratory pressures similar to those observed in the prototype (Figure 4 .A) (24) . In fact, the slope of the ramp of increasing inspiratory pressure is one of the parameters that can be set by the user in some commercially available devices, since excessively rapid increases in early onset of inspiratory pressures may lead to patient discomfort ( Figure 4 .B) by not mimicking the physiological inspiratory patterns characterized by progressive increases in flow. Although tidal volume was not a direct outcome variable controlled by pressure support ventilators, it is interesting to note that the prototype ventilator resulted in tidal volumes that were similar to the ones generated by the commercial device ( Figure 5.B) , adding further support to the suitability of the prototype ventilator for generating inspiratory pressure waveforms and adequate tidal volumes in a wide spectrum of simulated patients ( Table 1 ).",

This model is widely used in the literature to simulate the mechanical load of the respiratory system for investigating ventilation (19) (20) (21) and for simulating dyspnoea (26, 27) . In fact, the level of obstruction-restriction we applied to our volunteers resulted in a breathing discomfort score (Figure 7 ) similar to the ones set in recent reports to mimic dyspnoea by loaded breathing (26, 27) . The results obtained when testing the applicability of the prototype ventilator in humans showed that, similar to the bench test, there were no faulty triggering or cycling events, that the pressure waveform was similar to those typically observed in commercial ventilators (Figures 7 and 2.Suppl) , and that the relief of breathing discomfort was virtually the same as the one achieved by the commercial ventilator ( Figure 6 ).",

There is little doubt that industry-based conventional production chains, including design, manufacturing and commercialization, play a key role in the healthcare system. Accordingly, industry heavily invests in R&D and translates new knowledge from the laboratory bench to patient bedside. In other words, the medical device industry searches and delivers life-enhancing innovative solutions. Unfortunately, such industrially-based model is hardly suitable to low-income settings that are usually resource scarce, and where the provision of even adequate basic services to the population is challenging. The main reason why the conventional industrial model does not work in LMICs is that the standard industrial production scheme, which also applies to entirely non-for-profit companies, entails significant costs beyond those strictly required for device manufacturing.",

Moreover, those companies, mainly based in USA and Canada (49% of the world market), Europe (27%), Japan (7%) and China (6%), are highly and globally regulated to guarantee the safety and performance of their innovative and high technology products throughout their life-cycle, as well as pre-and post-marketing (28) . Unlike many other industries, R&D expenditures represent a significant cost component for medical device companies. These companies spend on average between 6% and 12% of revenues towards R&D investment (29) , with some niche firms or start-ups incurring even higher R&D costs (> 20%). Average selling, general and administrative expenses (SG&A), which include marketing, advertising and promotion costs and general and administrative costs, account for about one-third of total revenues (30) . Importantly, the cost of goods sold (COGS), which measures the total cost that it takes for a medical device company to manufacture its products including labour, material costs, rental and utility costs, represent between 35% and 40% of revenues (30) , with the remaining costs going to taxes, interests and depreciation. Thus, a disproportionately large share of medical device companies' revenues is slated for expenses beyond those needed to manufacture their products. In contrast, in the approach we describe in this work, as ventilator assembly is performed locally or directly linked local technical partners, the only costs incurred are those associated with purchasing of the components and the actual labor costs of assembling the device, both of which are low thanks to e-commerce and labor costs in LMICs, respectively. Noteworthy, the approach proposed here may not only allow for adequate availability of ventilators to patients (31) (32) (33) (34) , but may also contribute to the development of the local industry network in LMICs (35) (36) (37) .",

            "text": "the performance of the ventilator prototype was assessed by connecting it to the patient simulator through flexible conventional tubing (2 m length, 22 mm diameter), including a 5 mm diameter orifice at the nasal mask to create an intended air leak orifice to avoid rebreathing, as it is set in conventional clinical applications. The experimentally measured pressure-flow (P-V') relationship in this intended leak (V'\u224810\u00b7P 0.48 ; V' in l/min, P in cmH 2 O) resulted in a minimum continuous air flow renewal of 20 l/min for a nasal pressure of 4 cmH 2 O. In addition to the intentional air leak, we eventually also included a non-intentional air leak (5 mm diameter orifice) to simulate the real-life leaks observed in patients subjected to non-invasive ventilation owing to poor mask fit on the patient's face skin (Table 1). This unintended leak created air flow leaks of 30 and 40 l/min at nasal pressure values of 10 and 18 cmH 2 O, respectively. Therefore, the ventilator prototype was tested under 16 different simulated conditions (Table 1), covering real life settings when applying NIV in clinical practice. For the sake of comparison, the same 16 bench test conditions were also applied to a high-performance commercially available mechanical ventilator (Lumis 150, VPAP ST, Resmed; with default settings). During the tests, nasal pressure, flow and simulated pleural pressure signals were measured (Figure 2) with a Fleisch pneumotachograph (Metabo, Switzerland) and pressure transducers (Celesco, Canada; Validyne, USA), recorded at 100 Hz. Subsequently, tidal volumes were digitally computed by integration of the flow signal (after adequate zero-flow correction). Inspiratory trigger delay was measured as the time from starting the decrease in negative inspiratory (simulated pleural) pressure to the time at which nasal pressure started to be positive (22).",

            "text": "shows an example of the nasal pressure and breathing flow signals recorded in one of the bench tests simulating a patient with mild disease for both the prototype and commercial ventilators. The pressure waveform in the commercial device was close to a square signal whereas the pressure generated by the prototype increased and decreased more smoothly. Consistently, the inspiratory flow induced by the commercial ventilator experienced a sudden increase at the beginning of inspiration, while the flow induced by the prototype increased more progressively. The ventilator prototype performance was comparable to the commercial ventilator and provided inspiratory and expiratory pressures (up to 16 and 8 cmH 2 O, respectively) with no defective triggering or cycling when tested over the described 16 different simulated conditions. Figure 1.Suppl (on line Supplementary_-Methods&Results.pdf) shows the pressure waveforms recorded in the 16 test conditions, showing that the prototype was performant in all cases (as the commercial device was; figures not shown). Figure 5.A is a Bland-Altman type plot illustrating the difference between measured maximum inspiratory and minimum expiratory pressures and the corresponding target values set at the ventilator control panel, respectively. Actual minimal expiratory pressures set to range 4-8 cmH 2 O, differed by less than 1 cmH 2 O from the target values, with positive and negative differences in the case of the prototype and commercial ventilator, respectively. Actual peak inspiratory pressures, set to range 10-16 cmH 2 O, were systematically higher than the target values for both ventilators, being greater (by \u22481.5 cmH 2 O) in case of the prototype ventilator. The trigger delay in the prototype showed no statistically significant differences when compared with the delay time in the commercial ventilator (Figure 5.B). Although statistically significant, the inspiratory tidal volumes achieved with both ventilators in the 16 different test conditions were similar (difference of 40 ml on average) (Figure 5.B).",

            "text": "easy-to-build for potential use in under-resourced areas of developing countries or during pandemic conditions such as those imposed currently by the novel corona virus disease superimposed on already strained hospital conditions dealing with the influenza season. The results obtained during both the bench testing, and during the applicability pilot study in humans confirmed that the newly designed low-cost ventilator performs comparably to currently available commercial ventilators. Specifically, the device functioned as expected under stressing conditions in both the bench test (high load impedance and unintended leaks) and in the test with subjects with obstructiverestrictive loaded breathing. The ventilator is based on a modular structure (Fig. 1.B) requiring only basic electronic training for an overall straightforward and easy assembly. The device modules are interconnected by compact electrical wiring, and therefore such design enables simple replacement of each module independently, as needed. The setting requires no pre-calibration routines, since pressure transducers are thermally corrected, and are provided with factory calibration. Interestingly, when the ventilator is switched on, an automatic routine process automatically tests and digitally corrects any drift in the zero signal of the transducers. Flow is sensed with a pneumotachograph consisting of a slight constriction in the tube section separating the two pressure transducers. As such orifice-like resistor is nonlinear, the pressure drop signal across the transducers is digitally linearized (by computing the square root) in real time. Given that cycling (end inspiration) is determined when inspiratory flow reaches below a certain percentage (usually 30-50% (23), selectable by the user) of the inspiratory peak, the flow signal does not require calibration. In addition to the hardware components, the Arduino code controlling the ventilator (which is also open access provided) can be re-uploaded at any time, thereby allowing for simple updates to the ventilator functions in LMICs, with locally or remotely updated code. For instance, cheap high (or low) pressure acoustic alarms can be easily added. Moreover, the non-linear resistor to estimate flow can be replaced by a linear pneumotachograph to measure flow, and the related inspired volume (although this would increase cost and require periodic calibration).",
