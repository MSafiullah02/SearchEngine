However, the estimated coefficients even turn from positive into negative when the quantile \u03c4 is equal to .7 to .9.

This finding is in line with those found in Chen, 2007a, Chen, 2010. However, the quantile regression test results revealed interesting outcomes. Specifically, it was found that the link between tourism growth and HER is statistically significant at the low quantiles of HER but not at the median and high quantiles of HER. In other words, the significant effect of tourism growth on HER exists only when HER is low, i.e. the association between tourism growth and HER is state-dependent.",
