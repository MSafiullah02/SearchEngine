With a diameter of 150\u2013200 nm, the elementary body is ring-shaped and characterized by a narrow protoplasmic margin around the nucleoplasm, a non-glycogen inclusion body and iodine staining negative. Cps develops well in several cell culture systems, among which HeLa cells, Vero cells, and L cells as well as McCoy cells are commonly used. The Cps can also develop in the yolk sac of the chicken embryo. The number of susceptible animals is relatively large, and the laboratory rats are usually used in the animal inoculation. As Cps and Chlamydia trachomatis share the same antigen, both of them cannot be distinguished by the complement fixation test (CFT). With a weak resistance to the surroundings, Cps can be easily killed by the general chemical disinfectants. It can be inactivated in 48 h at 37 \u00b0C, in 10 min at 60 \u00b0C, in 24 h with 0.1 % formaldehyde or 0.5 % phenol, and in 30 min with diethyl ether or with ultraviolet radiation. It is resistant to low temperature and can remain infectious for several years if it is kept at \u201370 \u00b0C.",

After being inhaled by humans via the respiratory tract, Cps enters the blood circulation, then attacks the mononuclear macrophage system, and proliferates inside. After the above process, Cps invades the lung and other organs via blood. Thus, human psittacosis may be a respiratory tract infection (RTI) or a general infection mainly with respiratory symptoms. The pulmonary lesions often occur in the hilum of the lung and then spread around, resulting in the lobular pneumonia and interstitial pneumonia. Via microscopic examination, infiltration of the mononuclear lymphocytes can be discovered in the alveolar wall and interstitial tissue; deciduous epithelial cells, fibrous protein, lymphocytes, and few neutrophils can be found in the pulmonary alveoli; the inclusion bodies and pathogens can be seen in the cytoplasm of the macrophage in the exudation of pulmonary alveoli. SARS and lobular pneumonia often occur. In severe cases, necrosis of lung tissue may occur accompanying pleurisy. Beside the lung, relative lesions can be found in other involved organs such as the liver, spleen, kidney, meninges, cardiac muscles, and endocardium.",
