In addition, growth rates of the cumulated COVID-19 deaths are decreasing over time. This negative correlation between UVI and the cumulated COVID-19 deaths due to time is the source of the identification problem. We address this problem through our statistical analysis in which we flexibly isolate UVI from linear or non-linear time trends which can be either similar across countries or even country-specific.",

This evidence is consistent with the clinical studies in China and Italy that indicate comorbidities such as hypertension, diabetes and cardiovascular diseases could be important risk factors for critical COVID-19 cases 8-10 . Epidemiology of COVID-19 provides evidence that vitamin D might be helpful in reducing risk associated with COVID-19 deaths 11, 12 .

We further recognize that UVB radiation may not make a real difference, when someone is already severely infected and developed severe complications.
