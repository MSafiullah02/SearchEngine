To screen different immunomodulatory medicinal compounds to unravel their interaction with SARS-COV-2 viral proteins. Materials & methods: A library of immunomodulatory medicinal compounds with antiviral capability were analyzed against SARS proteases, spike protein and nonstructural proteins (NSP-9, 15) using Autodock vina. Results: Out of more than 300 medicinal compounds, only six compounds: arzanol, ferulic acid, genistein, resveratrol, rosmanol and thymohydroquinone showed significant interaction with the SARS viral proteins by forming hydrogen bonds with the active site residues with low binding energy. Further AD-MET (absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion and toxicity) analysis showed good pharmacokinetic properties and low acute toxicity of these compounds. Conclusion: The current study provides convincing evidence that these medicinal compounds exert antiviral activity against the SARS-COV-2 virus and could be further exploited for the treatment of this disease.",

The dilemma is the severity profile, enhanced surged capacity of diagnostic and laboratory tools, the spectrum of illness and that there is no specific therapeutic intervention, while the lack of sufficient understanding of viral pathogenesis makes it even more enigmatic [1, 2] . Recent studies are currently underway to decipher the molecular mechanism adopted by these viruses to understand the nature of the disease and to identify potential therapeutic targets for vaccine and drug development.",

The family is further genetically classified into four different genera: Alphacoronavirus, Betacoronavirus, Gammacoronavirus and Deltacoronvirus. The first two genera (alpha and beta-) of coronaviridae cause diseases in mammals, whereas the other two affect birds. Both SARS-COV-1 (Middle East respiratory syndrome) and SARS-COV-2 (Novel Coronavirus- 19) belong to genus Betacoronavirus that are highly contagious viruses and notorious for causing a multitude of diseases with neurological, respiratory, enteric and hepatic manifestations [3] [4] [5] . They are assumed to be transmitted from bats to different organisms, which ultimately lead to transmission to humans. SARS-COV-2, previously known as Novel coronaviruses , are enveloped positive-sense singlestranded RNA viruses with a genome size of 27-30 kb and are equipped with 5 -cap structure and 3 poly-A tails that act as typical messenger RNA upon transduction [6, 7] . The genomic organization of SARS-COV-2 is comprised of 14 annotated open-reading frames (ORFs) translating 27 proteins. At the 5 -terminus, lies ORF1a and ORF1b, which encode for polyproteins that after proteolytic processing produce 16 nonstructural proteins (NSP), involved in direct RNA replication and transcription. The structural region is congregated adjacent to the 3 -end and encodes for four structural proteins (spike, envelope, membrane and nucleocapsid) and other accessory proteins through ribosomal frameshifting.",

Nucleocapsid protein encapsulates the viral genetic material inside the virion [9] . Among NSPs, NSP-5 protease [10] and peptidase [11] facilitate polyprotein cleavage, NSP-9 replicase [12] encourages replication of viral RNA and NSP-15 endoribonuclease, [13] (a subunit of SARS-COV-2 RNA-dependent RNA polymerase) catalyzes viral RNA replication.

Inhibiting some of these viral proteins might impede viral replication and could be considered invaluable therapeutic targets for this disease.",

Medicinal compounds, known for antiviral and the immunomodulatory activity [14] [15] [16] 18] , were selected as ligands and prepared with the PRODRG server [21] prior to docking. The entire docking study was facilitated by Autodock vina equipped with Raccoon2 (a virtual screening plugin), and the ligands were focused at the predicted active site of the viral protein receptors to perform site-specific docking to procure potential inhibitors.

These compounds (ligands) when focused at the active site of a particular protein (receptor) establish different types of chemical bonds with their active residues. These chemical bonds include hydrogen, Vanderwaal, salt bridges, \u03c0-\u03c0 interaction, \u03c0-sigma bond, \u03c0-sulfur and many other hydrophobic interactions. Among these bonds, hydrogen bonds play a critical role in protein-ligand interaction and lower the binding energy in order to stabilize the docked complex [24] . It is already established that when a protein active site is blocked by a chemical substrate (ligand) this abrogates its functional enzymatic activity. This approach was adopted to find novel inhibitors for SARS-COV-2 by inhibiting critical proteins responsible for virus attachment and replication. More than 300 medicinal compounds with immunomodulatory and antiviral activity were added to the Raccoon2 plugin of Autodock vina to perform virtual screening to obtain promising inhibitors for SARS-COV-2 proteins. Both target proteins and compounds were prepared for docking studies by subjecting them for energy minimization and structure refinement. Molecular docking was performed by exposing these compounds to the predicted active site residues of these viral proteins. The results obtained from this analysis were filtered based on compounds interaction with the active site residues, low binding energy and hydrogen and hydrophobic interaction. It was observed that, among these medicinal compounds, only six compounds showed promising interaction with the active site of SARS proteins as summarized in Table 1 and molecularly represented in Figure 1 and Supplementary Figures 1, 3 , 5 and 7, respectively. The majority of these compounds exploited oxygen (O-, O=) and hydroxyl groups (-OH) to form hydrogen bonds with the SARS proteins whereas carbon rings participated in establishing hydrophobic interactions. Some compounds showed similar binding affinity for the active residues of these viral proteins to establish hydrogen bonds, such as in the case of peptidases (2GTB), Threonine-111 and Asparagine-151 were favored by Arzanol, Ferulic acid and Thymohydroquinone while Threonine-199 by Genistein, and Resveratrol as shown in Figure 2 . mentary Figure 8 ). The binding energy observed for these compounds was approximately 5-7.0 kcal/mol and they were further subjected for ligand conformational analysis, which was predicted by the LigRMSD database [25] . The prime purpose of root-mean-square deviation (RMSD) analysis is to evaluate experimentally solved ligand structure against predicted docked ligand conformations. The predicted value of the RMSD for these compounds was approximately 0.9-1.5\u00c5, which is considered successful and stable. A value beyond 2\u00c5 indicates instability and aberrancy in ligand conformation and docking parameters.",

WHO approved chloroquine on an emergency basis and hydroxychloroquine based on promising in vitro and clinical results [26] . But in hindsight, these drugs are highly toxic, capable of jeopardizing patient's health by disrupting essential heart and neurological functions [27, 28] . On the other hand, hundreds of different anti-HIV protease inhibitors have been reported that are capable of terminating SARS-COV-2 viral replication and RNA extension. However, these viruses possess proof-reading and other coping mechanisms to attenuate the interaction, thus making these antiprotease drugs inefficient as evident 10 .2217/fvl-2020-0079 Future Virol. (Epub ahead of print) future science group from recent clinical trials [9, 28, 29] . To address these problems, we utilized a novel approach by gathering medicinal compounds with antiviral and immunomodulatory activity to check their inhibitory interaction against critical SARS-COV-2 proteins. The viral proteins include structural proteins such as spike glycoprotein that allow these viral particles to attach themselves to ACE-2 receptor of the host cell, whereas nonstructural proteins (NSP-9, NSP-15) facilitate viral replication and proteases modulate the production of different proteins through proteolytic cleavage of SARS-COV-2 polyproteins. This study aimed to obtain novel drug candidates that have the capability to interact with the active site of all of these viral proteins and should possess efficient pharmacokinetic profile with low toxicity to ensure safety during administration. Both proteins and ligands were prepared with Modrefiner and PRODRG server to eradicate any bad contacts, unwanted potential energy and structural anomaly that might result in false interaction. These structurally refined molecules were used and added to raccoon2 virtual screening plugin of Autodock vina to perform virtual screening of these ligands and to filter out possible drug candidates establishing hydrogen bonds, other than Vanderwaal interaction, with the active site residues of these viral protein receptors. Only six medicinal compounds: arzanol, ferulic acid, genistein, resveratrol, rosmanol and thymohydroquinone formed hydrogen bonds with these viral proteins. These compounds were further analyzed for ligand RMSD to evaluate their interaction stability through LigRMSD [25] . The predicted value of RMSD of these compounds was in between 0.9-1.5\u00c5, which is considered adequate and stable [30] .",

This study elucidated the chemical affinity and mechanism of these medicinal compounds against SARS-COV-2 protein targets. The results obtained from this in silico study could be used as a vehicle by other researchers and clinicians looking for promising anti-SARS therapies.",
