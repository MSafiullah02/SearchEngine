            "text": "Human infections with a novel avian-origin influenza A virus (IAV; H7N9) were first reported from Shanghai and Anhui Province, China during 2013 (Gao et al., 2013b). As of February 2015, over 575 cases of human infection with this virus have been reported in China (ProMED-mail, 2015c). Notably, several human exposures of H7N9 are thought to have been associated with visitations to live poultry markets, but not necessarily with direct contact with poultry (Liu et al., 2014a). For obvious reasons, this virus has caused economic losses and is a public health concern (Bi et al., 2015). For example, soon after the emergence of H7N9, economic losses to the poultry industry were estimated to be >1 billion U.S. dollars, while losses incurred from medical expenses and disability-adjusted life years were smaller but also quite significant (Liu et al., 2014b). Unfortunately, there appears to have been a surge of human cases associated with H7N9 IAV during the winter of 2014\u20132015 and imported cases have been recently observed in Hong Kong, British Columbia, Canada, and possibly in the Philippines (ProMED-mail, 2015a, ProMED-mail, 2015b, ProMED-mail, 2015c).",

However, this virus has shown a much different pattern in humans, as high case fatality rates were noted in admitted patients during the first few months following the discovery of this virus (Gao et al., 2013a). Varying degrees of pathogenicity of H7N9 in other mammalian species have been noted. In one study of domestic ferrets, experimental infections with the Anhui strain of the virus by the nasal route caused respiratory symptoms and lethargy in some animals, but was not lethal during the experimental period (Belser et al., 2013). However, a second study indicated the virus can cause high morbidity and mortality rates in ferrets inoculated intratracheally, especially at high doses (Kreijtz et al., 2013). Guinea pigs were found to be productively infected with this virus and showed a very low minimum infectious dose (Gabbard et al., 2014). A recent study contrasted infections of ferrets, chickens, and pigeons with emergent H7N9 (A/Anhui/1/13) and a LP avian-origin H7N7 (A/turkey/Germany/AR534/2013) (Kalthoff et al., 2014). Results suggested that the mammals tested in this study typically shed ten-fold or greater quantities of the H7N9 virus than the tested birds and also often shed ten-fold or greater quantities when H7N9 was compared to H7N7 (Kalthoff et al., 2014).",

In addition, most animals underwent moderate weight loss through 10 DPI of the experimental infection (\nFig. 2), but those sampled on 21 DPI had largely regained their lost weight to pre-test conditions (average of 4.0 kg versus 4.06 kg for animals sampled at 0 and 21 DPI, respectively).

Two animals had titers of >1280 and 320, while the third did not yield a detectable HI antibody response. The reason for the lack of an antibody response in this animal is unclear, especially considering that it shed virus.

The highest titer from nasal flush samples was 105.8\n PFU/mL and the highest titer from oral swab samples was 102.5\n PFU/mL (\nTable 3). Each of the cottontail rabbits produced nasal shedding of \u2265104.0\n PFU/mL on 1 DPI. Only mild clinical signs of disease were noted for cottontails, which included mild nasal discharge, loss of appetite, and apparent lethargy in some individuals. These symptoms were not observed after 6 DPI. The weight of cottontail rabbits was relatively stable during the experimental period. For example, although weights varied by day, the average mass of cottontail rabbits at 3 DPI (0.936 kg during the infection period) and 7 DPI (0.935 kg when the infection had largely cleared) were quite similar. However, daily temperatures suggested these animals have had mild to moderate fevers during the infection period, peaking at 5\u20136 DPI and decreasing during most DPI thereafter (Fig. 1). The three cottontails that were maintained until 21 DPI developed detectable antibody responses at the end of the experiment with titers of 1:80, 1:80, and 1:160 (Table 3). Histopathology revealed marked inflammation in one lung lobe of one rabbit, but no other lesions were observed in that rabbit or the other two animals.",

This feature of their infection is of obvious epidemiological importance. For example, if an infected peridomestic skunk were to feed upon unprotected poultry feed or use unprotected watering devices, sneezes or oral secretions could be sufficient to contaminate poultry feed or water with virus-laden secretions. This scenario may be enhanced by the nasal shedding profiles of these animals. Every skunk tested shed a minimum of 105.8\n PFU/mL on at least one DPI (Table 1). Furthermore, one of the animals tested was still shedding IAV at 12 DPI, thereby suggesting these animals could pose a transmission threat long after their initial infection. This is consistent with a previous report that suggested that striped skunks can shed IAV for extended time periods (Root et al., 2014b).",

For example, one animal ceased shedding as early as 5\u20137 DPI and no animals yielded evidence of shedding after 8 DPI (Table 2). Overall, viral shedding in raccoons was reduced when compared to striped skunks. However, there was individual heterogeneity in shedding profiles of the raccoons, with some individuals clearly shedding at relatively high rates during few DPI. In general, the shedding of A/Anhui/1/2013 in raccoons was greater than what has been previously reported for other IAVs tested in this species (Hall et al., 2008, Root et al., 2014a). Although raccoons typically do not shed the viral loads seen in certain other mammals such as striped skunks and cottontail rabbits (Root et al., 2014b, Root et al., 2014c), they have been shown to be naturally exposed to IAV in North America and in introduced populations elsewhere (Hall et al., 2008, Horimoto et al., 2011, Yamaguchi et al., 2014), suggesting that the behavioral tendencies of this species facilitates events where transmission can occur.",

The highest titers from nasal flush samples were generally observed at 1 DPI and typically decreased on subsequent DPI. Although very mild clinical signs were noted during early DPI, these were not observed after 6 DPI. Various IAVs have been reported in naturally infected lagomorphs. For example, antibodies reactive with an H9N2 subtype as well as an H5N1 subtype have been documented in plateau pika (Ochotona curzoniae) sampled near Qinghai Lake, China (Yu et al., 2014, Zhou et al., 2009). It was suggested that infections in pika were possibly caused by environmental contamination of common foraging sites with wild birds (Zhou et al., 2009). This indicates that North American lagomorphs may also be susceptible to natural infections with IAVs when found in environments conducive to resources shared with birds, such as similar environments and species compositions as found at Qinghai Lake.",

            "text": "These studies have clearly shown that three common peridomestic mammals can replicate H7N9 IAV and some species can shed high viral loads through the nasal route. Because Asian H7N9 is not naturally present in North America, the potential role of these species in the epidemiology of this virus is unknown at this time. However, the three species tested developed productive infections and all have peridomestic tendencies, which are behavioral attributes that could put them into close contact with humans or farms. An additional risk factor includes the existence of wet markets that contain both mammals and birds. For example, stacked pens of rabbits, pigeons, chickens, and ducks have been described as a representative wet market in China (Guan et al., 2013) and rabbits can be present in live bird markets in the U.S. (Cardona et al., 2009). Although less common, some small carnivores, such as Chinese ferret-badgers (Melogale moschata), hog badgers (Arctonyx collaris), Himalayan palm civets (Paguna larvata), and raccoon dogs (Nyctereutes procyonoides), have also been sold in some wet markets in Asia (Guan et al., 2003). Two of these species, Himalayan palm civets and raccoon dogs, showed evidence of infection with a SARS-like coronavirus (Guan et al., 2003). Following the identification of this virus in palm civets, this species was barred from Chinese wet markets for a time period but were again made available soon thereafter (Webster, 2004). Notably, some close relatives to some of the species mentioned above, such as Owston\u2019s civet (Chrotogale owstoni) and stone marten (Martes foina), have been shown to be susceptible to IAV infection (Klopfleisch et al., 2007, Roberton et al., 2006). Furthermore, raccoon dogs, which have been sold in wet markets (Guan et al., 2003), are known to be susceptible to infection with highly pathogenic H5N1 IAV (Qi et al., 2009). Thus, considering the virus shedding demonstrated in mesocarnivores (i.e., skunk and raccoon) of the current study, it is reasonable to assume that some of the ecologically similar species from Asian wet markets mentioned above may pose a risk for transmission of IAV in these types of artificial high density interspecific aggregations. These findings suggest that certain mammal species should be considered in biosecurity plans for live animal markets and poultry production facilities located in the endemic region of H7N9 IAV.",

Following brief quarantine periods, animals were transferred to an animal biosafety level-three (ABSL-3) facility on the Foothills Research Campus of Colorado State University. For experimental infection purposes, raccoons and striped skunks were housed in 1.08l\u00d70.76w\u00d70.692h\n m3 metal dog crates equipped with rubber livestock mat floors. These animals were maintained with omnivore diet (omnivore diet; Mazuri, Purina Mills, LLC, St. Louis, MO) and supplemented with hardboiled eggs. Both food and water were replenished each day. Cottontail rabbits were housed in standard rabbit racks that included a PVC nest box and floor grates lined with cardboard. Food (MannaPro\u00ae, Pro Formula, St. Louis, MO, and alfalfa supplemented with fruits and vegetables) and water were replenished daily. All animals were bled and assessed to be antibody negative by hemagglutination-inhibition (HI) assay with homologous virus and chicken erythrocytes (cottontail rabbits) or ELISA (striped skunks and raccoons; FlockCheck\u00ae Avian Influenza MultiS-Screen Antibody Test Kit, IDEXX Laboratories, Inc, Westbrook, ME) prior to the initiation of the study. This ELISA test has been used successfully in raccoon and striped skunks in earlier studies (Root et al., 2014a, Root et al., 2014b). In addition, each animal was outfitted with a Bio Medic Data Systems (BMDS) subcutaneous transponder (IPPT-300 transponders) that transmitted an individual identification number for each animal as well as individual temperature readings. Scans were conducted using a BMDS IPPT 7009 reader (Bio Medic Data Systems, Seaford, Delaware, USA).

The remaining animals were sampled every other day through 14 DPI and on 21 DPI when they were bled and euthanized. Daily sampling consisted of an oral swab, a nasal flush, a temperature reading and general health observations while animals were under anesthesia. Nasal flushes were conducted by dripping BA-1 medium into the nares and collecting material that was expelled by sneezing. This procedure was used for the three species tested. Raccoon sampling mirrored that of striped skunks with one exception: the three animals sacrificed early in the infection were euthanized on 8 DPI. The sampling regime was modified for cottontail rabbits, as this species has been previously shown to have peak shedding of IAV and clear their infections more quickly than the other species tested in this study (Root et al., 2014c). As such, all of the rabbits were sampled on odd days from 1\u20137 DPI. Three animals were euthanized on 7 DPI and the remaining animals were euthanized on 21 DPI at which time a blood sample was collected for serologic analyses.",
