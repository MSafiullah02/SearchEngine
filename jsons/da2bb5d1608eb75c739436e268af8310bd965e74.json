Virus sequence analyses from severe cases have shown presence of unique and highly conserved mutations in the helicase domain of genotype 1, 3 and 4 viruses. We evaluated role of two amino acid replacements (L1110F) and (V1120I); found to be frequent in genotype 1 FHF-E viruses from India. Three mutant helicase proteins (two with single point mutations and one with dual mutations) were expressed in Escherichia coli and evaluated for their ATPase and RNA unwinding activities. Both L1110F and V1120I helicase mutants showed marginal decrease in ATPase activity, while L1110F/V1120I dual mutant showed normal ATPase activity. All three mutants proteins showed RNA unwinding activities comparable to wild type protein. Corresponding mutations were made in the helicase domain of HEV RLuc replicon and replication efficiencies were tested in the S10-3 (Huh 7) cells. The mutant replicon V1120I showed lower replication as compared to L1110F and L1110F/V1120I mutants. However, all three replicon mutants showed lower replication efficiencies as compared to the wild type replicon. Walker A and Walker B motif mutant HEV replicons were unable to replicate indicating essential role of the virus encoded helicase domain during HEV replication. FHF-E associated helicase mutations resulted in only marginal decrease in the virus replication suggesting alternate function/s of the helicase protein.

Construction of HEV RLuc subgenomic replicon by replacement of nt 5148-5816 in the ORF2 region of the genotype 1 infectious clone (pSK-HEV-2, Genbank Accession No. AF444002) with Renilla luciferase gene is reported by Cao et al., 2010 . Complete genome sequence analysis of 7 FHF-E derived viral sequences with the pSK-HEV-2 showed overall 93-92% nucleotide identity; however, helicase domain amino acid sequences (245 aa) were completely identical in all the sequences except for the two above mentioned unique changes in FHF-E virus strains. Viral RNA dependent RNA polymerases have two conserved catalytic aspartate residues in their catalytic sites which are known to be essential for coordination of the catalytic Mg 2+ ions during RNA polymerization. The first aspartate residue in GDD motif of HEV RdRp is essential for virus replication (Graff et al., 2005) . We developed RdRp mutant (Mut GDD) from HEV Rluc replicon by site directed mutagenesis (GDD to GAA) and used as a negative control. Capped RNA transcripts were made from wild type and Mut GDD HEV Rluc replicons and transfected into S10-3 cells. Virus replication was evaluated in terms of cell associated Renilla luciferase activities, at different time points from 1 to 6 days post transfection. At 24 h, though the luciferase activity of the wild type HEV Rluc replicon was negligible (data not shown) it increased significantly 2 days onwards. The luciferase activity of Mut GDD remained negligible till 6 days without any increase from the base level values (Fig. 3A) . These results confirmed replication competence of wild type HEV Rluc replicon and negligible (no) replication of the GDD mutant in S10-3 cells.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 311, "end": 327, "text": "Cao et al., 2010", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}, {"start": 938, "end": 958, "text": "(Graff et al., 2005)", "ref_id": "BIBREF10"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 1623, "end": 1632, "text": "(Fig. 3A)", "ref_id": "FIGREF2"}], "section": "Replication of HEV replicon mutants"}, {"text": "Though we have previously shown that Walker A and Walker B helicase mutant proteins have negligible ATPase, RTPase and unwinding activities (Karpe and Lole, 2010a, b) , it was not seen how such low level enzymatic activities affect the HEV replication.

These experiments included wild type HEV replicon as the positive control and Mut GDD as the negative control. Replication efficiency was evaluated by measuring RLuc activity in the RNA transfected cells over the period of 5 days. Mutations in both Walker A and Walker B motifs affected RLuc synthesis and there was no RLuc activity (Fig. 3B) . Walker A motif and Walker B motif in the helicase domain are indispensable for HEV replication: capped RNA transcripts of wild type, Walker A mutant, Walker B mutant and GDD mutant (Mut GDD) replicons were transfected in S10-3 cells.

Transfection of Mut GDD RNA served as a negative control. Cells were assayed for renilla luciferase activity at 5 days post-transfection as described in (A).

As HEV-RLuc replicon was made by inserting RLuc gene into ORF2 encoding region, RLuc expression requires subgenomic RNA synthesis. Since both Walker A and Walker B mutants showed no RLuc activity there were two possibilities (1) helicase is essential during the transcription of subgenomic RNA, (2) helicase is required at the preceding step of virus replication, i.e. ns RNA (negative sense RNA) intermediate synthesis. If second possibility is true, then it will affect synthesis of both subgenomic RNA and new genomic RNA.

Majority of human HEV infections are caused by genotype-1 virus in developing countries. This genotype is predominantly transmitted by enteric route causing epidemics in contrast to sporadic cases caused by zoonotic transmissions of genotype-3 and genotype-4 viruses in developed countries. Associations of Th1 bias and higher HEV viral load have been documented in genotype-1 hepatitis E infections leading to FHF during pregnancy (Bose et al., 2011) .

Sequence analysis of 121 HEV isolates (genotype 1-4) done by Mishra et al. (2013) showed that mutation L1110F was genotype-1 FHF specific (except for one type-4 sequence from Japan). Mutation V1120I was absent in genotype-2, predominant in genotype-3, and rare in genotype-4 HEV sequences. These dual mutations were present in 5/7 HEV genomes analyzed from FHF-E cases from India.
