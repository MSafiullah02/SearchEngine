Hospital visitation rules need to be carefully considered so as to limit potential exposures. Finally, deliberate attempts should be made to preoperatively assess each patient's potential need for a post-acute care upon discharge, given the high incidence of known COVID-19 outbreaks in those facilities. 8 Expectations for discharge should be reviewed preoperatively as longer hospital stays after heart surgery potentially place patients at additional risk. As such, patients should plan to be safely discharged to their homes as soon as possible following uncomplicated surgery. 9 3. Healthcare providers should be aware that their safety also remains a priority. Cardiac surgical programs should follow precautions and guidelines that have been put in place by their respective institutions, adhering to the recommendations of local, regional and national public health authorities to manage and contain COVID-19 transmission. 10 The risk of nosocomial infection may be significantly reduced by vigilant attention to frequent hand hygiene, environmental cleaning, appropriate use of PPE, the creation of COVID-secure units, social distancing in the hospital, and self-isolation of COVID-19 positive healthcare workers. It is imperative that healthcare workers continue to follow institutional policies about reporting symptoms, undergoing testing, and implementing self-quarantine when appropriate. They must abstain from work if they become sick, no matter how mild their symptoms. Contingency planning for staffing must be in place for healthcare workers who require self-isolation. This is particularly relevant for the small and highly specialized cardiac teams. In addition, support and treatment services should be available for providers who experience mental health concerns or physical and/or emotional exhaustion as a result of professional or personal experiences during the pandemic. 11, 12 Finally, it is likely that there will be evolution and institutional variation in COVID-19 nasopharyngeal and serologic screening for asymptomatic healthcare workers. Healthcare leaders must be aware of this dynamic process. b.

Nucleic acid amplification testing (NAAT) for COVID-19 (e.g., by polymerase chain reaction (PCR)) should be strongly considered for patients in areas of high disease burden, those who have recently been exposed to infected individuals, and those who exhibit even mild symptoms. If there has been a recent exposure, a 2-week quarantine is recommended. Finally, when possible, all preoperative patients should be tested prior to admission. Unfortunately, there is no test currently available that can reliably rule out COVID-19. Despite this, tests using nasopharyngeal (NP) swabs for COVID-19 NAAT, including rapid PCR tests, are being increasingly performed across the country, often with the ability to return results within minutes or hours. In light of this, we propose the following guidance regarding COVID-19 test interpretation in the ramp up phase based on the best available evidence at this time.",

Clearly, as improved testing methods become available, they should be utilized, all the while recognizing that elective surgery is just that, and a 2-week quarantine with retesting may be the safest approach for any patient, regardless of pretest probabilities. 6.

Programs should be prepared to immediately stop ramping up or to even de-escalate cardiac surgical volumes should there be a resurgence in the number of local COVID-19 cases, admissions, and deaths. 7. A phased approach is recommended to resuming elective surgery based upon each hospital's reexpansion capacity (Figure 1) . We have defined an increase in hospital capacity as the percentage of resources previously allocated to the COVID-19 pandemic that have now been reallocated to the management of non COVID-19 patients. Phase 1 reflects up to a 25% increase in capacity, Phase 2 a 25%-50% increase, and Phase 3 a 50%-100% increase, or a return to normal institutional activity. Depending on which phase of re-expansion your institution is currently in, your cardiac surgical program should have a defined approach as to which elective cases will be given priority during the ramp up. The number of elective cases by which each program may ramp up depends upon the urgent case demands at the institution and the overall institutional capacity in the context of COVID-19 prevalence and the impact on the healthcare workforce.",
