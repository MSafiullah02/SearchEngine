These include the HCV p7 protein (Pavlovic et al., 2003), human immunodeficiency virus type 1(HIV-1) Vpu (Gonzalez and Carrasco, 1998, Schubert et al., 1996), influenza A virus M2 (Pinto et al., 1992), hepatitis A virus 2B (Jecht et al., 1998), semliki forest virus 6K (Sanz et al., 1994), picornavirus 2B (Agirre et al., 2002, Aldabe et al., 1996), chlorella virus PBCV-1 Kcv (Mehmel et al., 2003), and avian reovirus p10 protein (Bodelon et al., 2002). These proteins contain at least one transmembrane domain that interacts with and expands the lipid bilayer. The transmembrane domain could form hydrophilic pores in the membrane by oligomerization (Carrasco et al., 1995, Gonzalez and Carrasco, 2003). The hydrophilic channels would allow low molecular weight hydrophilic molecules to across the membrane barrier, leading to the disruption of membrane potential, collapse of ionic gradients, and release of essential compounds from the cell. Alterations in ion concentration would promote translation of viral versus cellular mRNAs, as translation of mRNAs from many cytolytic animal viruses is fairly resistant to high sodium concentrations (Carrasco et al., 1995, Gonzalez and Carrasco, 2003). Progressive membrane damage during viral replication cycles would also result in cell lysis, promote viral budding and release, and facilitate virus spread to surrounding cells. Therefore, disruption of the function of viroporins could abrogate viral infectivity, rendering these proteins as suitable targets for the development of antiviral drugs.",

            "text": "Coronavirus E protein is a minor structural protein (Liu and Inglis, 1991, Yu et al., 1994). It plays essential roles in virion assembly, budding, morphogenesis, and regulation of other cellular functions (Corse and Machamer, 2001, Corse and Machamer, 2002, Fischer et al., 1998, Lim and Liu, 2001). In a recent study, we demonstrated that the SARS-CoV E protein could obviously enhance the membrane permeability of bacterial cells to o-nitrophenyl-\u03b2-d-galactopyranoside and hygromycin B, suggesting that the protein may function as a viroporin (Liao et al., 2004). Similar observations were recently reported on mouse hepatitis virus E protein (Madan et al., 2005). In a separate study, the transmembrane domain of the protein was indeed shown to be able to form a cation channel on artificial membrane (Wilson et al., 2004). Molecular simulation and in vitro oligomerization studies indicate that this domain could form stable pentamers (Torres et al., 2005). In this study, we show that the expression of SARS-CoV E protein alters membrane permeability of mammalian cells. This membrane permeabilizing activity is associated with the transmembrane domain. Unlike in bacterial cells, mutations of the three cysteine residues alone do not obviously affect the membrane permeabilizing activity of the protein. Further biochemical characterization of the E protein shows that it is an integral membrane protein, and is posttranslationally modified by palmitoylation on all three cysteine residues.",

Cell extracts were prepared and the expression of E protein was detected by immunoprecipitation with anti-Flag antibody under mild washing conditions. As shown in Fig. 1\n, extracts prepared from cells without treatment with hygromycin B showed the detection of the E protein and some other cellular proteins. In cells treated with 1 and 2 mM of hygromycin B, the expression of the E protein was reduced to 6 and 2%, respectively (Fig. 1). However, in cells transfected with the SARS-CoV N protein, a similar amount of the N protein was detected in cells both treated and untreated with hygromycin B (Fig. 1).

The first and third cysteine residues, at amino acid positions 40 and 44, respectively, were previously shown to play certain roles in oligomerization of the E protein (Liao et al., 2004). They may also be involved in the E protein-induced alteration of membrane permeability in bacterial cells (Liao et al., 2004). To systematically test the effects of these residues on the expression, posttranslational modification, folding, oligomerization, and the membrane-permeabilizing activities of E protein, seven mutants, C40-A, C43-A, C44-A, C40/44-A, C40/43-A, C43/44-A, and C40/43/44-A, with mutations of the three cysteine residues to alanine either individually or in combination of two or three, were made by site-directed mutagenesis (Fig. 2). Western blotting analysis of cells expressing wild type and most mutant constructs showed specific detection of three species migrating at the range of molecular masses from 14 to 18 kDa under reducing conditions and representing three isoforms of the E protein (Fig. 3a). These isoforms may be derived from posttranslational modification of the protein. The apparent molecular masses of these isoforms on SDS-PAGE are significantly larger than the calculated molecular mass of approximately 10 kDa for the Flag-tagged E protein.",

The use of lower concentrations of hygromycin B is to ensure the detection of subtle changes on membrane permeability induced by the mutant constructs. Meanwhile, SARS-CoV N protein was cotransfected into HeLa cell together with wild type and mutant E proteins to aid assessment of the inhibitory effect of protein synthesis by hygromycin B. Expression of wild type and mutant E protein showed that similar levels of inhibition of protein synthesis by hygromycin B were obtained (Fig. 3b). When 0.5 and 1 mM of hygromycin B were added to the culture medium, wild type and mutant E constructs render similar levels of inhibition to the expression of both N and E proteins (Fig. 3b). These results suggest that, contrary to the previous results observed in bacterial cells, these cysteine residues do not render significant effects on the membrane permeabilizing activity of the E protein. The reason for this discrepancy is uncertain, but it may reflect differences in posttranslational modifications, membrane association, subcellular localization, and translocation of the E protein in prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells.",

Recent molecular simulation and biochemical evidence showed that this domain may be involved in the formation of ion channel by oligomerization (Torres et al., 2005). Mutations of the putative transmembrane domain were therefore carried out to study its functions in membrane association and permeabilizing activity of the E protein. As shown in Fig. 2, four mutants, Em1, Em2, Em3, and Em4, were initially made by mutation of 3\u20137 leucine/valine residues to charged amino acid residues in the transmembrane domain. Two more mutants, Em5 and Em6, were subsequently made. Em5, which contains mutation of N15 to E, was constructed based on the molecular simulation studies showing that this residue may be essential for oligomerization of the protein (Fig. 2) (Torres et al., 2005). Em6 was made by combination of the Em4 and C40/43/44-A (Fig. 2). Expression of these mutants showed the detection of polypeptides with apparent molecular masses ranging from 10 to 18 kDa (Fig. 4a). Interestingly, mutations introduced into Em2, Em3, EM4, and Em6 significantly change the migration rate of the corresponding mutant E protein on SDS-PAGE. The apparent molecular mass of these mutants is approximately 10 kDa, which is consistent with the predicted molecular weight for the Flag-tagged E protein (Fig. 4a). The fact that substitutions of the hydrophobic amino acid residues in the transmembrane domain of the E protein with charged amino acids significantly alter the migrating properties of the E protein in SDS-PAGE may reflect the changes in overall conformation and membrane association of these mutants compared to wild type E protein.",

The purified E protein was concentrated and subjected to cross-linking with three different concentrations of glutaraldehyde, a short self-polymerizing reagent that reacts with lysine, tyrosine, histidine, and tryptophan. Cross-linking with glutaraldehyde showed the detection of dimer, trimer, tetramer, pentamer, and other higher-order oligomers/aggregates of the E protein under either non-reducing (Fig. 6\n, lanes 1\u20133) or reducing (Fig. 6, lanes 4\u20136) conditions. It was noted that more higher-order oligomers/aggregates were detected under non-reducing conditions when higher concentrations of the cross-linking reagent were used (Fig. 6, lanes 1\u20133).

First, treatment of the E protein with 1M hydroxylamine showed the reduced detection of the more slowly migrating isoforms (Fig. 7a, lanes 1 and 2). As a control, treatment of the IBV E protein with the same reagent abolished the detection of upper bands (Fig. 7a, lanes 3 and 4). Second, the three cysteine residues in combinations of two or all three were mutated to alanine (Fig. 2). Wild type and mutant E proteins were then expressed in HeLa cells and labeled with [3H] palmitic acid or [35S] methionine\u2013cysteine. As shown in Fig. 7b, wild type and all mutant E proteins were efficiently labeled with [35S] methionine\u2013cysteine (Fig. 7b, upper panel). In cells labeled with [3H] palmitate, wild type and the three mutants with mutations of different combinations of two cysteine residues (C40/44-A, C40/43-A and C43/44-A) were efficiently detected (Fig. 7b, lower panel, lanes 1\u20134).

Although clear ER localization of the coronavirus IBV E protein was observed at early time points in a time course experiment using an overexpression system (Lim and Liu, 2001), no such localization patterns were observed as reported by Corse and Machamer (2003). To clarify that the above observed ER localization pattern may be due to the high expression level of the protein in HeLa cells using the vaccinia/T7 system, the subcellular localization of the SARS-CoV E protein in another cell type with lower expression efficiency of the protein was carried out. As shown in Fig. 8a, expression of the Flag-tagged SARS-CoV in BHK cells stably expressing the T7 RNA polymerase (Buchholz et al., 1999) showed that the protein exhibits typical Golgi localization patterns (panels D\u2013F). Expression of the untagged SARS-CoV E protein in the same cell type also shows very similar Golgi localization patterns as the Flag-tagged protein (Fig. 8a, panels G\u2013I). These results suggest that the predominant ER localization patterns in HeLa cells observed above may be due to the cell type used and the very high expression levels of the protein in individual cells with the vaccinia/T7 expression system.",

This hairpin structure could deform lipid bilayers and cause tabulation (Arbely et al., 2004). The full-length and N-terminal 40 amino acid region were shown to be able to form cation-selective ion channels on artificial lipid bilayers (Wilson et al., 2004). By using molecular simulation and synthetic peptide approaches, it was shown that the transmembrane domain of E protein could form ion channels by homooligomerization into stable dimers, trimers, and pentamers (Torres et al., 2005).

            "text": "Lipid modification by palmitic acid has been reported for a number of viral envelope proteins, including the hemagglutinin (HA) and M2 protein of influenza virus (Melkonian et al., 1999, Schroeder et al., 2004, Veit et al., 1991, Zhang et al., 2000), gp160 of HIV-1 (Rousso et al., 2000), and Env protein of murine leukemia virus (Li et al., 2002). The E protein of coronavirus mouse hepatitis virus and IBV was also reported to be palmitoylated (Corse and Machamer, 2001). It has been noted that palmitoylation of viral envelope proteins usually takes place on cysteine residues located within the transmembrane domain or in the cytoplasmic tail close to this domain (Bhattacharya et al., 2004, Hausmann et al., 1998, Schmidt et al., 1988, Veit et al., 1989). This thioester linkage of fatty acids to viral envelope proteins is a posttranslational event that takes place in the cis or medial Golgi after exit from the ER and after oligomerization but prior to acquisition of endo H (endo-\u03b2-N-acetylglucosaminidase H) resistance (Bonatti et al., 1989, Veit and Schmidt, 1993). Palmitoylation of viral proteins plays a considerable role in virus infectivity, virion assembly, and release. For example, palmitoylation of the HA protein of influenza virus enhances its association with lipid rafts (Melkonian et al., 1999, Zhang et al., 2000); palmitoylation of the HIV-1 envelope glycoprotein is critical for viral infectivity (Rousso et al., 2000); palmitoylation of the murine leukemia virus envelope protein is critical for its association with lipid rafts and cell surface expression (Li et al., 2002); palmitoylation of the Rous sarcoma virus transmembrane glycoprotein is required for protein stability and virus infectivity (Ochsenbauer-Jambor et al., 2001). The observed palmitoylation of the SARS-CoV E protein may play certain roles in its cell surface expression and association with lipid rafts.",

This may reflect the relatively low sensitivity of the hygromycin B assays used to detect the membrane-permeabilizing activity of the protein. Alternatively, it suggests that the palmitoylated mutant E protein may be still tightly associated with cellular membrane, as palmitoylation of the protein would help target the protein to the cellular membrane. This membrane association could, in turn, cause membrane damage, leading to the increased membrane permeability to hygromycin B.",

However, it was consistently observed that, under the experimental conditions used, certain proportions of both SARS-CoV and IBV E proteins associated with cellular membranes were resistant to 1% Triton X-100, while some of the membrane-associated proteins can be released from the membrane pellets by treatment with high pH. Two possibilities are considered. First, as observed in this study, SARS-CoV E protein is partially associated with lipid rafts. This may render the protein resistant to the treatment by Triton X-100. Second, immunofluorescent staining of cells expressing the E protein showed the detection of the protein with punctated staining patterns at both cell surface and intracellular structures. It would suggest that the protein may form aggregates. These aggregates may be cofractionated with the membrane-associated E protein and can be released by high pH but are resistant to the detergent treatment.",
