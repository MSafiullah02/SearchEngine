Based on a review of 34 months of data from 5 domestic and international airlines, Peterson and colleagues [1] determined that the 3 most common situations prompting calls to a medical communications center were syncope (37%), respiratory problems (12%), and gastrointestinal symptoms (10%). Any of those signs and symptoms could be associated with an infectious disease. The actual prevalence of infectious diseases among the 11,920 in-flight medical emergencies in Peterson's study group was 2.8%. Focusing on children, Moore and associates [2] found that infectious diseases, neurologic emergencies, and respiratory tract problems were the leading reasons for medical consultation among the passengers transported by one airline between 1995 and 2002.",

Ebola is spread through person-to-person contact and by contact with body fluids or secretions from infected people. Providers responding to a passenger who might have Ebola or similar disease should wear a facemask and gloves. Cabin crew members should be instructed to follow International Air Transport Association guidelines, which include distancing the symptomatic person from other passengers as much as possible, using a facemask, using plastic bags to dispose of tissues, storing soiled items as biohazardous material, and limiting contact with the symptomatic person, including use of gloves and hand hygiene.

Pregnant women face the biggest risk from this virus, in that it has been linked to microcephaly in newborns. The treatment for Zika virus infection is typically supportive care.

For example, a measles outbreak in Australia in 2010 was traced to a 12-h international flight to that country from South Africa [8] . Nine cases of measles were confirmed, 5 of them in individuals who had been on that flight. The initial (\"index\") case sparked a contact investigation that complied with Australian guidelines, i.e., passengers 2 rows in front of and 2 rows behind where the index case as seated were traced, as were children 2 years or younger who were on the flight. The 2-row proximity rule failed to identify other individuals who were infected, because they sat more than 2 rows away. Interestingly, two individuals who became infected on that flight were healthcare workers, who returned to their usual patient care duties after returning to Australia. The authors concluded that the 2-row rule should be reevaluated and that other strategies for contact investigation should be designed, with consideration of cabin layout, flight duration, and flight's origin and destination as well as associated costs in relation to risks and benefits.",

The authors also pointed out that exposure risk is influenced by movement about the cabin and sharing air for a long period of time.
