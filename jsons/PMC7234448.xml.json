Contrary to a common perception that design and design thinking belong to certain subjects but not others, we highlighted the need and significance of changing the subject fixation perception to elevate the conception of design thinking as transdisciplinary and not belonging to the field of engineering only. Based on our proposed notion of \u201ceveryone designs and can design\u201d (Li et al. 2019a), we further discussed how existing research supports this notion with evidence of mutual benefits between design and STEM education.",

We discuss how our definition connects with each of these three approaches. We conclude by describing how CT is distinct from other models of thinking like design thinking.

For example, students might simply memorize the subtraction algorithm and know how to compute, say, 45\u201321, as \u201csubtracting a small digit from a larger digit,\u201d getting the correct answer, 24. But, without the needed understanding of place value and base-10 number composition and decomposition, then, a student might well carry out the computation 41\u201325 but get the same answer of 24. Here, we highlight the words of \u201cmaking sense\u201d and \u201cunderstanding,\u201d as they require thinking beyond rote computation. Helping students to develop such deeper understanding has long been advocated and emphasized (e.g., CCSSI 2010; NCTM 1989), and also practiced in school mathematics such as the use of \u201cnumber talks\u201d (e.g., Parrish 2011).",

The notion of CT might well be readily accepted for its importance to every student in learning mathematics. And yet, mathematics educators already have other terms that convey similar meaning, such as \u201cnumber sense\u201d (e.g., Sowder 1992) and \u201csymbol sense\u201d (Arcavi 1994).

The accessibility and usefulness of the notion might well be undermined for many by the expectation of training in computer science as a pre-condition. In fact, though, computer science itself is no longer viewed as the study of phenomena surrounding computers, but, instead, it is the study of computational information processing, both natural and artificial (Denning 2005, 2007). At the same time, human thinking can also be characterized as specific models of information processing when performing various tasks (e.g., Anderson et al. 2004; Simon 1979).

The entailed improvement can call for the use of various strategies (including abstraction and modeling), practice, skill acquisition and improvement. Here, information can take different formats, at different levels of abstraction, and thus appears as various representations that can be customized and used in different disciplines for problem solving, modeling, and system building.

Although computation was in existence long before the creation of computers, the development of computation has experienced tremendous changes over the years associated with the invention and use of computers. Denning (2007) summarized the revolution in three main stages: (1) computation as a tool for performing simple and well-structured tasks, such as solving equations and running simulations, together with the creation and use of the first electronic digital computers in the 1940s; (2) computation used not only as a tool but also a method for discovering new knowledge beginning in the 1980s; and (3) computation and information processing found in the deep structures of many different fields beginning in the 2000s, such as biology, physics, and business management.

Examples include the Elementary Perceiver and Memorizer (EPAM, Feigenbaum and Simon 1984), and adaptive control of thought-rational (ACT-R, Anderson et al. 2004; Anderson and Lebiere 1998).

As discussed in the previous editorial (Li et al. 2019b), Simon expanded the information processing model of \u201cproblem solving man\u201d from Human Problem Solving (Newell and Simon 1972) to the notion of \u201cthinking man\u201d in the book Models of Thought (Simon 1979).

Now we can learn also from biology research; information processes and computation exist in nature as information encoding and generation in and through DNA, with its distinct computational methods (see Denning 2007). Thus, it is better to surpass Simon\u2019s notion of conceptualizing human thinking as information processes and computation. What makes CT, as proposed in our position, distinct from general human thinking then resides in the dedication to performance improvement in efficiency, correctness, and elegance, as discussed above.",

Taking it positively, people view CT as relevant to many different professional activities, especially in different fields of STEM.

            "text": "There are three main approaches in describing CT that aim to facilitate educational practice.One approach in education is to follow a description developed from discipline-based approaches as discussed above. For example, Grover and Pea (2013) reviewed relevant development in K-12 education associated with CT, from procedural thinking development through LOGO programming in the 1980s (Papert 1980) to recent movement of several professional societies and organizations aimed to develop students\u2019 CT such as, the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM), Computer Science Teachers Association (CSTA), and Google. Instead of discussing possible clarifications that may be needed, Grover and Pea focused on how others might have interpreted Wing\u2019s description of CT. The review provided a nice summary of on-going efforts from professional organizations and studies that aim to develop CT through programming and computer science in K-12 education. Grover and Pea also highlighted and discussed that tremendous efforts are needed in developing programs and research further in a broad range of topic areas including curriculum, instruction, assessment, and teacher education.Another approach is to propose and discuss possible expansion of CT beyond computer science. For example, a recent report Charting a Course for Success: America\u2019s Strategy for STEM Education, released by the White House in December 2018, included CT, digital literacy, and computational literacy when laying out the vision for the United States to success in STEM education (Committee on STEM Education 2018). With the increasing use and importance of digital devices and the internet, the committee envisioned the importance of \u201cdigital literacy\u201d as a basic level of understanding and \u201ccomputational literacy\u201d as a higher level of skill for all students to benefit from what technology development can bring for tomorrow\u2019s job opportunities. Building computational literacy was taken as one of the four pathways to success in STEM education, with \u201cmake computational thinking an integral element of all education\u201d listed as one of three objectives under this pathway. Although possible relationships among computational literacy, CT, and digital literacy were not explained in the report, computational literacy was seemingly taken as having a broader scope than CT. The meaning of CT was explained first in the report with the definition from Wing (2014), and then expanded as including some broadly valuable thinking skills beyond computer science: evaluating information, breaking down a problem, and developing a solution through the use of data and logic. In fact, this expanded description shares many similarities with George P\u00f3lya\u2019s work on problem solving. With this expansion, the report further indicated the importance of developing students\u2019 CT as an integral part of all education with or without the use of a computer.There is one other approach that aims to highlight the importance of computation for students\u2019 learning beyond programming. diSessa (2000) advocated the notion of computational literacy before Wing\u2019s promotion of computational thinking, and also took a principled approach in emphasizing both \u201ccognitive\u201d and \u201csocial\u201d aspects rather just focusing on programming and the computer environment.Different from the popular use of literacy that many may perceive as \u201ca casual acquaintance with \u2026,\u201d diSessa (2018) defined literacy as a massive intellectual accomplishment of a culture together with a grand \u201cre-mediation,\u201d shifting and expanding the fundamental forms of representation in society to include computation as universally known and used. Similar to the way algebra and calculus transformed the study of physics from a philosophical inquiry to a rigorous, precise empirical pursuit (diSessa 2000), computation not only supports many different fields (not just computer science) but can also change the very intellectual landscape of fields in what they do and how they develop. diSessa (2018) thus viewed computational literacy as important to every student, but not in the same way as Wing (2006). In his view, computation is not the special province of computer scientists, and everyone does not need to think like a computer scientist. Instead, computation is a fundamental resource for all of society, and it will develop earmarks that distinguish it in the way it is useful in each discipline and also in the larger, public society.",
