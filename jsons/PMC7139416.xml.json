Helices and sheets tend to fall into specific regions in the {\u03d5, \u03c8} space of the Ramachandran plot (see Figures 28 and 29). The corresponding width and shape of each region reflects the spread of that motif as found in proteins.",

They argued that, aside from technological improvements, we should carefully select new sequences for structure determination so as to maximize new fold detection and thereby reduce that time substantially. This is important since the annual number of new folds discovered during 1995\u20132000 has only averaged around 10%, with even less during 2000\u20132002. Certainly, careful selection of targets is even more critical if the number of folds is actually larger (e.g., of order 10,000) and associated with single sequence families [266]. The structural genomics initiatives (see beginning of 10.1007/978-1-4419-6351-2_2) are certainly accelerating the discovery of new folds (see, for example, [48, 214]), but the effect of these projects will take time to assess (see, for example, differing opinions in [87, 993]).

The remarkable cooperativity among the different filaments leads to conversions between a macroscopic left-handed form \u2014 used for swimming \u2014 and a right-handed form \u2014 used for reorientation of motion.
