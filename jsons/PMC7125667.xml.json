The most important causes of health problems in calves (0\u20131 years of age) are intestinal and respiratory problems (Waltner-Toews et al., 1986a, Kaneene and Hurd, 1990). Diarrhoea during the first month of life causes disease and mortality or can lead to delayed growth of calves and a higher age at first calving. These complications have severe direct and indirect economic consequences (Tzipori, 1981, de Graaf et al., 1999, Olson et al., 1999).",

Although these enteropathogens may not always cause diarrhoea, Garc\u00eda et al. (2000) showed a strong association between the presence of one of these intestinal agents and diarrhoea.

Cl. perfringens has been reported to play a role in a broad array of enteric and histotoxic infections (Petit et al., 1999, Smedley et al., 2004) and cause enterotoxaemia in both dairy cows and calves (Muskens et al., 2007, Lebrun et al., 2007).",

In 2007, the median herd size was 70 dairy cows (interquartile range 45\u201390 cows) and assuming a year-round calving pattern, a mean of 6 (range 4\u20138) calves were born each month.

Rectal faecal samples were taken with a new plastic glove from each individual calf. Subsequently, the faecal samples were scored for consistency and collected in a plastic pot. For the evaluation of faecal consistency the following criteria were defined\u2014score of faeces = 0 or \u2018normal\u2019: firm consistency, brown colour, perineum and tail of the calf is clean and dry; score = 1 or \u2018custard-like\u2019: a paste-like consistency, yellow colour and perineum and/or tail of the calf is smeared with faeces; score = 2 or diarrhoea: watery consistency, perineum and/or tail of the calf is smeared with watery faeces. Subsequently, a questionnaire was conducted asking about management practices. Herdsmen were asked about procedures related to housing (group or individual housing of calves, age in days at which calves were transferred to another housing system), on provision of colostrum (time after birth calves were first fed colostrum, quantity (litres) and frequency per day), provision of milk replacer (day of first provision, quantity (litres) per day), provision of roughage (first day of provision), cleaning procedures for boxes (frequency of cleaning) and utensils (cleaning of utensils with cold or hot water, use of soap or detergents), treatment procedures for diarrhoeic calves (preventive use of antibiotics (yes/no), curative use of antibiotics (yes/no), use of oral rehydration salts (ORS) (yes/no)) and nursing procedures (same person taking care of calves all the time (yes/no), use of specific clothing when caring for the calves (yes/no)). In addition, the feeding regime on the day of sampling was asked (milk replacer or bulk milk or individual cow milk or water or ORS). Before the start of the study, both investigators were simultaneously trained in two herds by a bovine health specialist in order to standardize the use of clinical scores.

To account for clustering (calves within a herd) a logistic model with random herd effects was used. A backward procedure was used and included calf- and herd-associated factors that yielded P-values <0.25 in preceding bivariable analyses. As a indicator of model fit, the pseudo-R-squared based on ordinary logistic regression analysis was calculated as R-squared calculations for random-effects models were not available in the statistical package used (STATA/SE release 10, Statacorp, 2007).",

We found a similar result in our study: there was no statistical association between the presence of non-normal faeces and Coronavirus.

A possible explanation might be that Coronavirus is an opportunistic infection that occurs when calves have previously had episodes of diarrhoea and were treated for bacterial infections.

The results of several studies in dairy herds have indicated that C. parvum is very common among dairy calves (Garber et al., 1994, de la Fuente et al., 1999, Olson et al., 1999, Ruest et al., 1998, Sischo et al., 2000, Trotz-Williams et al., 2005) with apparent animal prevalences ranging from 15% to 48% for calves between 0 and 3 weeks of age. In these studies, over 60% of herds had one or more infected calves. Trotz-Williams et al. (2008) recently highlighted that most of the variation in shedding occurred between herds, rather than within herds. This indicates that herd-level risk factors, rather than calf-related factors, are important to effectively control C. parvum (Trotz-Williams et al., 2008). Our study confirmed this: the ICC for C. parvum shedding was as high as 0.33.",
