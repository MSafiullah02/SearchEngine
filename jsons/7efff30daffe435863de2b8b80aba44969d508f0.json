Some studies have suggested that physiological and ecological factors may be associated with Hendra virus infection in flying-foxes in Australia; however, it is essential to understand the normal range and seasonal variability of physiological biomarkers before seeking physiological associations with infection status. We aimed to measure a suite of physiological biomarkers in P. alecto over time to identify any seasonal fluctuations and to examine possible associations with life-cycle and environmental stressors. We sampled 839 adult P. alecto in the Australian state of Queensland over a 12-month period. The adjusted population means of every assessed hematologic and biochemical parameter were within the reported reference range on every sampling occasion.",

We found no evident effect of remarkable physiological demands or nutritional stress, and no indication of clinical disease driving any parameter values outside the normal species reference range. Our findings identify underlying temporal physiological changes at the population level that inform epidemiological studies and assessment of putative physiological risk factors driving Hendra virus infection in P. alecto. More broadly, the findings add to the knowledge of Pteropus populations in terms of their relative resistance and resilience to emerging infectious disease.",

However, it is essential to know the normal range of physiological biomarkers and their possible seasonal variability before seeking physiological associations with infection and/or disease. McMichael et al. (2015) published reference ranges for hematologic and biochemical parameters for P. alecto, but there are no published studies on temporal variability of these or other physiological biomarkers in flying-foxes. This study aims to measure physiological biomarkers in P. alecto over time to identify any seasonal population and sex-specific fluctuations, and to examine possible associations with life-cycle and environmental stressors.",

Morphometric index was calculated for each animal (forearm length (mm)/weight (g)). Pregnancy was determined by gentle trans-abdominal palpation, and lactation by expression of milk from the teats. Approximately 3 mL of blood was collected from the propatagial (cephalic) vein and dispensed into a 1.3 mL Lithium Heparin blood tube (Sarstedt 2269201), a 0.5 mL EDTA blood tube (Microtainer 5974) and a direct blood smear prepared and stained using the DiffQuik system (POCD Healthcare). Blood glucose concentration was measured at the time of bleeding using an ACCU-CHEK Performa glucometer (Roche Diagnostics GmbH). Voided urine samples were obtained by trans-abdominal palpation and gentle manual bladder expression. After anaesthesia, each bat was monitored until fully conscious and satisfactory haemostasis at the venepuncture site confirmed prior to placement into a pillowcase for a further recovery period of at least 30 min prior to release at the capture site.",

The proportion of adult females with dependent suckling young showed a strong seasonal increase from 0% in August to approximately 80% in October, followed by a decline to 0% in February. There was little difference between the proportion of lactating females throughout the post-partum nursing season, approximately 85% in October and 80% in February, declining to approximately 10% in May, reflecting weaning of the increasingly independent young, and coinciding with an increase in pregnancy from 10% in April to 80% in May. Significant statistical correlation was shown for palpably pregnant females in May to August (P = 0.001) and lactating females in December (P = 0.001).",

The use of morphometric index as a sole indicator of body condition has been the subject of contention (Green 2001) , and thus, we additionally recorded body mass and body condition score. We found that the differing measures used to establish body condition demonstrated similar temporal trends. Fitness-maximising strategies of males and females typically differ, particularly with respect to timing of maximal reproductive effort, resulting in sexspecific seasonal cycles in body mass, body condition and fat deposition (Lindstedt and Boyce 1985; Welbergen 2011) . In this study, we demonstrated that female body condition declined during the lactation period and increased as the young was weaned. This likely reflects the high metabolic load that lactation imposes on nursing dams, and is consistent with the general observation that lactation is the most energetically demanding period across all mammalian species (Millar 1977; Thometz et al. 2014 ). In contrast, males accumulated body reserves prior to the breeding season but subsequently lost body mass during the peak mating season (March and April), likely due to territory defence, courtship and lost foraging opportunities (Welbergen 2011). As body condition followed distinctly different seasonal patterns for each sex, food availability or environmental conditions are unlikely to be the primary driver of body condition in this species at these times.",

The higher urine protein levels in males and females in February and April plausibly reflect peak mating period and the presence of spermatozoa in urine. Alternatively, mild elevations of protein levels in both sexes could theoretically be attributed to mild transient renal functional abnormalities following a severe heat stress event in South East Queensland in January 2014 (Welbergen 2014) ; however, there was no concomitant hypoalbuminemia consistent with a clinically significant protein-losing glomerulonephritis. The increase in urinary glucose levels in females in February 2014, could also theoretically be explained by the same aforementioned heat stress event, although the elevations were not found to be statistically significant, nor were elevations observed in males.",

A more acidic urinary pH is usually indicative of a higher dietary acid load (typically higher protein content), while more alkaline pH is indicative of a higher carbohydrate diet (MacIntosh et al. 2012 ). However, the differing urine pH profiles between males and females is most plausibly due to the differing physiological status between the sexes, in particular lactation in females, rather than differing diets, as there is no evidence supporting differing foraging behaviours between the sexes of P. alecto (Palmer and Woinarski 1999; Markus and Hall 2004) .",

Two percent of values were found to be equal to or above 1.040, suggesting that a small minority of animals returning from nightly foraging may be under-hydrated. Studier and Wilson (1983) found that the urine concentrating ability of nectarivorous and frugivo- rous bats fell below that of insectivorous bats, suggesting that frugivorous bats are poorly adapted to produce concentrated urine, while Bakken et al. (2008) , in studies of a nectarivorous bat, suggest that water and electrolyte balance are maintained by eliminating excess ingested water by reducing renal water reabsorption, and limitation of urinary water loss during fasting by reducing glomerular filtration rate.",

In females, USG was uniformly low during lactation but high during pregnancy, when it is accepted that blood volumes in mammals commonly increase and conservation of fluids occur. The low USG values during lactation may alternatively reflect a high intake of fluid to support the physiologically demanding lifecycle event of lactation. The significant temporal differences between USG in males and females suggest that hydration status was more reflective of physiological and behavioural factors rather than environmental availability of water, and does not suggest any renal pathology.",

We found no evident effect of remarkable physiological or nutritional stress, and no indication of clinical disease driving any parameter values outside the normal species reference ranges. As both ecological processes and physiological status can influence patterns of infection and/or disease risk, our findings identify underlying temporal physiological variation at the population level that usefully informs epidemiological studies. In the Australian context, the findings will be valuable in assessing putative physiological risk factors driving Hendra virus infection in P. alecto. More broadly, this study adds to the knowledge of Pteropus populations in terms of their relative resistance and resilience to emerging infectious disease.",
