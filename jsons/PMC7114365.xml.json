            "text": "NAADP is a potent Ca2+ mobilizing messenger that triggers Ca2+ release from acidic Ca2+ stores such as lysosomes [[1], [2], [3], [4], [5]]. Critical to NAADP action are the endo-lysosomal two-pore channels (TPCs) [[6], [7], [8], [9]]. Local Ca2+ fluxes through TPCs are increasingly implicated in membrane trafficking events [10,11]. These include roles for TPCs in regulating lysosome morphology [12], retrograde transport between late endosomes and the Golgi [13], and endocytic trafficking of receptors for LDL and growth factors [14,15], pigment granules [16] and integrins [17]. They also likely regulate non-vesicular trafficking by strengthening membrane contact sites between late endosomes and the ER [18]. Consequently, TPCs are fast emerging as potential therapeutic targets in diverse disorders such as Parkinson's disease, fatty liver disease and cancer [12,14,17,19]. Moreover, TPCs have been identified as novel host factors for Ebola virus (EBOV) entry [20]. This virus enters cells through macropinocytosis, traffics through the endo-lysosomal system and, following binding to its intracellular receptor NPC1 [21], fuses with late endosomes/lysosomes to release its genome into the cytoplasm. Molecular or chemical inhibition of TPCs prevents EBOV infection likely at a late entry step, although the mechanism is unclear [20,22].",

            "text": "TPCs are dimeric ion channels, comprising a duplicated domain architecture, which are likely a bridge during the evolution of four-domain voltage-gated Ca2+ and Na+ channels [[23], [24], [25]]. Atomic structures of plant [[26], [27], [28]] and mammalian [29,30] channels are emerging providing detailed insight into the architecture of the pore. Two isoforms (TPC1 and TPC2) found in humans localise to distinct compartments within the endo-lysosomal system [9,31]. TPC2 is predominantly localised to late endosomes and lysosomes through an N-terminal targeting motif, which when mutated results in rerouting of the channel to the plasma membrane [32]. The activation mechanisms and ion selectivities of TPCs are areas of active investigation [33,34]. Although many studies have shown TPCs are required for NAADP-mediated Ca2+ signalling, NAADP appears to interact with TPCs indirectly through putative binding proteins [[35], [36], [37], [38]]. In contrast, the endo-lysosomal lipid PI(3,5)P2 has emerged as a direct channel activator that binds within the first domain of TPCs [29,30,39]. Interestingly, residues in the S4\u2013S5 linker within this domain required for NAADP-mediated Ca2+ signals [40] fall within the PI(3,5)P2 binding site [29] indicating a complex interplay between small molecule activators and accessory proteins.",

BZ194 [41], a N-alkylated nicotinic acid derivative, and Ned-19 [42], identified through a ligand-based virtual screen, are cell-permeable inhibitors of NAADP-evoked Ca2+ signals. But their indirect action, coupled with potentially promiscuous actions of their target NAADP-binding proteins on other channels [43], complicates the use of NAADP antagonists in a physiological setting. This underscores the need for direct channel inhibitors. We recently used a combination of homology modelling, molecular docking analyses and Ca2+ measurements to show that TPCs are likely to be direct targets for a number of voltage-gated Ca2+ and Na+ channel modifiers [24]. Tetrandrine [20], another Ca2+ channel antagonist has also recently emerged as a TPC blocker and potent inhibitor of EBOV entry. Finally, the flavonoid naringenin [44] has been shown to block TPCs, but with low affinity. Both tetrandrine and naringenin have multiple targets and are not approved for human use world-wide. There are therefore a limited number of drugs that directly inhibit TPCs.",

Current was measured with an Axopatch 200B patch clamp amplifier that was controlled by pCLAMP9 software. The current protocol used 400-ms rapid alterations of membrane potential (RAMP) from \u2212100 to +100 mV from a holding potential of 0 mV at 4 s intervals. The currents were filtered at 1 kHz with an internal four-pole Bessel filter, sampled at 5 kHz, and stored to a hard drive by Digidata 1440.",

Accordingly, nicardipine and diltiazem were recovered as top ranking blockers in the present screen (Fig. 1C, asterisk). Additionally, the mean rank and mean Chemguass4 scores of all Ca2+ channel blockers in the screen were lower than for Na+ channel blockers (Fig. 1C\u2013D). This accords with our docking and functional analyses showing more avid interaction and more potent inhibition of TPCs by blockers of Ca2+ relative to Na+ channels [24].

Of these, 51 were present in e-Drugs3D and all but 5 were recovered in the TPC virtual screen (Fig. 2B). Notably, approximately, a third of these (14) ranked within the top 200 of the TPC screen (Fig. 2C). Inspection of the prioritised hit compounds (Fig. 2D) revealed the Ca2+ channel blocker bepridil, further underscoring this class of compounds as TPC blockers. Importantly, this analysis also returned 4 dopamine receptor antagonists and 5 selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERMs). The prevalence of drugs in these two classes is consistent with our enrichment analysis from the TPC screen (Fig. 1D).

We did this using cell surface targeted TPC2 to facilitate single channel recording in a null background. Na+ was used as the major cation to complement our previous analyses using Ca2+ as the permeant ion [32]. As shown in Fig. 4A, some spontaneous activity was noted in most of the excised patches. NAADP addition to the bath solution robustly enhanced channel activity in a concentration dependent manner. Current amplitude histograms are shown in Fig. S1A\u2013C. Summary data quantifying the normalised open probability NP\nO is shown in Fig. 4B. Analysis of current-voltage relationships indicated a unitary Na+ conductance (\u03b3Na) of 86 \u00b1 0.7 pS (Fig. 4C; n = 3). Single channel openings in the absence and presence of NAADP were best fit by a single exponential with a mean open time of ~5 ms (Fig. 4D). For a sub-set of recordings where we were confident that the openings represented a single active channel (Po \u2265 0.15, \u22655 min recording duration) [50], closed time distribution was also analysed (Fig. 4D). The distribution was best fit by a double exponential with time constants of 0.7 \u00b1 0.4 ms and 47 \u00b1 3.5 ms, constituting 49 \u00b1 1% and 51 \u00b1 1% of the distribution, respectively (n = 4). Kinetic modelling yielded two topologies with similar LL ratios that linearly connected the closed states (C1 and C2) with the open state (O) (Fig. 4F). Collectively, these data affirm the sensitivity of TPC2 to NAADP and its permeability to Na+ and provide a framework for assessing drug action at the single channel level.",

As shown in Fig. 5C, Ned-19 also similarly inhibited channel activity. To gain mechanistic insight into drug block, we analysed dwell time distributions. As shown in Fig. 5D\u2013E, both fluphenazine and raloxifene reduced the mean open time from ~5 ms to ~3 ms without affecting the unitary current sizes. Current amplitude histograms are shown in Fig. S1D\u2013F. These data are consistent with a direct interaction of the drugs with the pore. In contrast, Ned-19 affected neither the mean open time nor unitary current size (Fig. 5F) suggesting a distinct mechanism of action. Data summarizing the effects of the drugs on NP\no, open times and unitary conductance are shown in Fig. 5G. Taken together, these data suggest that fluphenazine and raloxifene effectively behave as pore blockers.",

As shown in Fig. 6A, PI(3,5)P2 stimulated robust currents in TPC2-expressing lysosomes. These responses were inhibited by fluphenazine in a concentration-dependent manner with near full block achieved at 30 \u03bcM (Fig. 6A). Raloxifene also inhibited PI(3,5)P2-mediated currents with maximal effects at 3 \u03bcM (Fig. 6A). The inhibitory effects of both drugs were reversed upon washout (Fig. 6A).

            "text": "The dopamine receptor drugs identified here as TPC blockers included several phenothiazines (fluphenazine, trifluoperazine, prochlorperazine and thioridazine) that are used as anti-psychotics (Fig. 2). Our data is consistent with a recent screening campaign published while this work was in progress, which also identified phenothiazines as inhibitors of NAADP-induced Ca2+ release from sea urchin egg homogenates [63]. Indeed, the IC50 values for fluphenazine, 42 \u03bcM (Fig. 3B) and ~11 \u03bcM [63], are comparable. This congruence highlights the power of our in silico strategy for drug identification which, together with our electrophysiological analyses, points mechanistically to drug action on the TPC pore. We also identified the structurally distinct dopamine receptor drug, pimozide, a diphenylbutylpiperidine. As well as targeting the dopamine receptor, pimozide also targets voltage-gated Ca2+ channels [64]. The common action of pimozide on TPCs and voltage-gated Ca2+ channels likely reflects an evolutionary kindred between these two members of the voltage-gated ion channel superfamily [24]. Although voltage-gated Ca2+ channels have been implicated in viral entry [65], their functional absence in non-excitable cells (such as HeLa cells used in this study) points to TPCs as the likely targets.",

These drugs act as estrogen receptor agonists or antagonists, depending on the tissue, and are used for treating breast cancer and osteoporosis [66]. Off-target effects of these drugs are more than likely related to well-known rapid non-genomic actions of estrogen [67]. Indeed, inhibition of both viral entry and TPC activity by sub-micromolar concentrations of raloxifene is striking. Additional effects of SERMs such as destabilisation of either the EBOV glycoprotein [68] or lysosomal membranes due to their cationic amphiphilic nature [69] are possible. Nevertheless, both dopamine receptor antagonists and SERMs emerge as novel TPC blockers and provide independent scaffolds for small molecule development.",

            "text": "Estrogen receptor drugs appear more potent in blocking TPC activity (Fig. 6) and Ebola VLP entry (Fig. 7) than dopamine receptor drugs. This correlation points to a common mechanism of action (Fig. 6, Fig. 7). The half maximal inhibitory concentrations by raloxifene were similar but fluphenazine was more effective at inhibiting VLP entry (Fig. 7) than blocking the channel (Fig. 6). This could reflect additional effects of fluphenazine underlying entry inhibition or the very different conditions under which the two assays were performed (acute drug treatment versus pre-incubation; broken versus intact cells). One other notable difference was the relative poor potency of the drugs in blocking Ca2+ signals in egg homogenates (Fig. 3) compared to lysosomal currents (Fig. 6). Again, this could relate to the way in which drugs were administered or the activating ligand. Alternatively, this could point to species differences in drug block. Nevertheless, our study suggests that TPCs may be the target for a number of EBOV entry inhibitors described previously for which mechanistic information was lacking. How TPCs promote EBOV entry is unclear at present. A recent study provided evidence that TPCs may also regulate entry of the MERS corona virus [70]. Pharmacological inhibition with tetrandrine analogues or molecular knockdown of TPCs was shown to reduce Furin activity. This protease activity is required for priming of the envelope protein [71]. Thus, compromised activity upon TPC blockade could underlie reduced MERS corona virus entry. Such a mechanism is unlikely to regulate entry of EBOV because it is processed by endo-lysosomal cathepsins [72]. Moreover, entry of pre-cleaved EBOV is also blocked by tetrandrine [20] suggesting that TPCs act at a step distal to proteolytic processing. Clearly, further work is required to understand the mechanisms of TPC involvement in EBOV entry.",

Our previous whole cell recordings and single channel analyses demonstrated robust activation of Ca2+ and Cs+ currents in response to NAADP [32]. Here, we used Na+ as the major permeant ion. Comparing single channel conductances in this study (87 pS, Fig. 4) with those for Ca2+ (40 pS) and Cs+ (128 pS) reported previously [32] points strongly to TPC2 as a non-selective cation channel under these experimental conditions. This conclusion concurs with bilayer studies of TPC2 [74,75] and electrophysiological analyses of endogenous NAADP-activated TPC2 currents recorded from enlarged vacuoles (Na:Ca permeability ratio close to unity) [76]. TPCs interact with many other proteins [16] some of which likely act to effect and modify gating. Loss of accessory factors might well explain NAADP insensitivity in some studies. Indeed, such loss might also affect the ion selectivity of TPCs as accessory proteins are known to dictate the ion selectivity of other channels such as Orai [77] and MCU [78].",

Of note, phenothiazines have long been known to antagonize calmodulin [82] and previous studies with trifluoperazine have suggested a role for calmodulin in NAADP-mediated Ca2+ signalling [83].

It thus effectively acts as a gating modifier by reducing the overall frequency of channel openings through directly or indirectly influencing channel regions distal to the pore. Thus, our analyses uncover fundamentally distinct mechanisms for channel inhibition by the drugs and Ned-19. The lack of effect of Ned-19 (and also NAADP; Fig. 4) on open time support the notion that they act more remotely through associated NAADP-binding proteins. [38]. Uncertainty about the number of channels as well as the limited number of events in patches with low activity prevented us from performing close time distribution analysis upon channel inhibition. But further analysis is warranted not least due to the presence of a multiple closed times (Fig. 4F) which could reflect desensitized states.",
