Regionally-designated COVID-19 hospitals have implemented an aggressive policy to relocate as many beds as possible to COVID-19 patients. In order to do so, the preferred strategy has been to reduce the number of beds in neurology units, and in some cases several units have been consolidated into one. In other cases, particularly in the northern regions, entire neurology units have been closed and converted into COVID-19 departments entrusted to other medical specialties. Some stroke units have followed the same path and become \u201chubs\u201d and \u201cspokes\u201d for acute neurological pathology. In other situations, especially when it was necessary to meet the need for paramedical staff, the number of beds in neurology/stroke wards were significantly reduced and the nurses transferred to other units as needed to manage the COVID-19 emergency.",

For all other patients with non-acute central and peripheral nervous system diseases, hospitalization was limited. Overall, the number of hospitalized neurological patients has undergone a drastic reduction. Some neurological patients have been hospitalized in non-COVID-19 hospitals or in other non-neurological wards, while a significant proportion of patients were forced to postpone their request for hospitalization. In addition to the reduced availability of beds, the COVID-19 emergency has also resulted in the suspension of neurological day hospitals, ambulatory care, complex outpatient activity, and outpatient clinics, as well as clinics dedicated to the diagnosis and treatment of specific categories of neurological patients (centers for epilepsy, neuromuscular diseases, movement disorders, dementia, headache, multiple sclerosis, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, etc.).",

A further aspect that should not be underestimated involves possible post-COVID-19 sequelae, which may require accurate follow-up over time, as previously suggested by encephalitis lethargica [3] and postpolio syndrome [4].",

Besides acute neurological pathologies, neurological diseases include neurodegenerative conditions, complex diseases from a diagnostic and therapeutic point of view, and rare diseases that require specific experience and skills. All these conditions have a significant impact on society and families, who bear most of the burden in terms of care for these patients. For patients suffering from chronic neurological diseases, it is necessary to establish outpatient and dedicated care pathways where patients can be followed up periodically and where the effectiveness of therapeutic treatments in progress can be verified and monitored. The clinical course of these patients must also be able to accommodate scheduled admissions to neurology wards in the event of specific medical emergencies. Home healthcare also requires careful planning.",
