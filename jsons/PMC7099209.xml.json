            "text": "In supply chain management, there is much discussion on risks related to such aspects of supply chains as short product lifecycles, keen competition combined with cooperation, and globalization. The consumer electronics industry is the very embodiment of these aspects of supply chain management and related risks. While some of the supply- and demand-related risks are similar to such industries as the toy industry (Johnson, 2001), the consumer electronics industry faces additional risks due to its vertically integrated supply chains. This article seeks to provide a starting point for understanding supply chain risk in this industry through examples from this industry as well as from related ones like computers and mobile phones. To illustrate the mitigation of these risks, we list steps that Samsung Electronics and its subsidiary, Samsung Electronics UK, have taken to manage these risks.",

One way is to take a supply-chain viewpoint and associate risks with supply (suppliers, production and distribution within the company) and with demand (customers including end consumers) (Johnson, 2001). Associated with suppliers and in-house production and distribution are possible disruptions due to political risk and \u2018acts of god\u2019 or \u2018acts of man\u2019 in terms of war or terror. Associated with the demand side are risks pertaining to unanticipated changes in demand possibly stemming from loss of reputation for quality, from loss of technological or design competitive edge, from unpredictable changes in customer preferences, and even from a worldwide recession. There are also supply-chain-wide contextual risks that cut across the supply chain especially impacting companies with global supply chains. These include cultural differences in multinational operations, environmental risk, regulations risk, and exchange rate risk across multiple countries.",

It is hard to determine \u2018probabilities\u2019 in these situations and one has to deal with possibilities instead.

For instance, on 17 March 2000, a lightning bolt hit a power line in Albuquerque, New Mexico. This lightning bolt started a fire at a local Philips plant, damaging millions of microchips. The two major customers, Nokia and Ericsson, had different reactions. Almost immediately, Nokia began switching its chip orders to other Philips plants, as well as to other Japanese and American suppliers. In contrast, Ericsson with its single-sourcing policy, had no other source of microchips and its production was eventually disrupted for many months. Ultimately, the disaster and company dependence on a sole supplier cost Ericsson $400 million in lost sales (Eglin, 2003). Ericsson has since implemented new processes and tools for managing such risks reviewing all its sourcing (Norman and Jansson, 2004).",

Such a threat can be mitigated by signing long-term contracts or by having redundant suppliers. Holding inventory may work in some industries but not in consumer electronics due to the high rate of obsolescence. Long-term purchasing also has the disadvantage that prices for the contracted components might fall. Contracting with redundant suppliers is cost-effective only if companies can maintain near-economies of scale. Some firms use multiple, redundant suppliers, even if it means sacrificing some economies of scale. Cisco, for one, claims to have four or five more suppliers than it needs.

As regards finished goods inventory, managers responsible for manufacturing have a clear inventive not to have too much of it.

Instead, Samsung opts for a responsive flexible capacity through multi-platform and plants integrated with those of their core-component suppliers.

We can also point to risks that, although normally requiring only tactical planning decisions, can sometimes manifest themselves as catastrophic losses that require corporate intervention and strategic decision making as was the case with the Ericsson example. In addition, just as there are many metrics for measuring efficiency-related performance in a company, we need to devise appropriate metrics for risk exposure and risk performance. Some risk metrics can be associated with the financial concept of value-at-risk, for instance, demand-value-at-risk and inventory-value-at-risk (Sodhi, 2005).
