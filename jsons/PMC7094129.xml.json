Drills should be held to determine the plan's effectiveness. The Joint Commission requires that accredited health care facilities conduct at least two tests a year of emergency plans, which can be either a drill or an actual emergency.2\n",

In 2003, AORN published the Perioperative Disaster Preparedness Resource Manual,\n4 which provides information on natural and man-made disasters and safety and preparedness for facilities and perioperative staff members. A second edition, published in 2007 and renamed Perioperative Emergency Management Resource Manual,\n5 has expanded to include preparing for disaster situations that might involve West Nile virus, severe acute respiratory syndrome, and human and avian influenza. Also in 2007, AORN published the \u201cGuidance statement: Mass casualty, triage, and evacuation,\u201d6 which includes practice scenarios for mass casualty situations. As AORN members, we should be proud to belong to a professional association composed of highly motivated and qualified volunteers and staff members who are planning for our future needs.",
