Virus infection spread rapidly worldwide causing high rate of mortality in pups (Carmichael and Binn, 1981). The dogs are infected through the oronasal route and after 3\u201310 days they develop an acute gastroenteritis characterised by loss of appetite, vomiting, fever, diarrhoea (from mucoid to haemorrhagic) and leukopenia.",

CPV-2 belongs to the feline parvovirus (FPV) subgroup of the genus Parvovirus, together with feline panleukopenia virus (FPLV), mink enteritis virus (MEV), raccoon parvovirus (RPV), raccoon dog parvovirus (RDPV) and blue fox parvovirus (BFPV) (Berns et al., 2000). Its origin is unknown, but it was suggested that it arose as a mutant from FPLV in dog or cat populations or from related viruses in wild carnivores (Truyen et al., 1995, Truyen et al., 1998, Truyen, 1999, Truyen, 2006).",

            "text": "After the first outbreak of CPV-2 infection, there were consecutive emergences of new antigenic variants of this virus, designated type 2a and 2b (Parrish et al., 1985, Parrish et al., 1991). Starting from 1979 and in a relatively short period, these variants replaced the original type 2 worldwide in dogs (Mochizuki et al., 1993, De Ybanez et al., 1995, Greenwood et al., 1996, Truyen et al., 1996, Truyen et al., 2000, Sagazio et al., 1998, Steinel et al., 1998, Buonavoglia et al., 2000, Pereira et al., 2000). CPV-2a and CPV-2b differ from the original type CPV-2 by amino acid changes affecting the VP2 protein and by their extended host range which includes canine and feline cells in vitro and dogs and cats in vivo. Subsequently, further mutations in the CPV capsid protein have been described in several countries, but there is no evidence for a further spread of these mutants (Ikeda et al., 2000). Analysis of Italian CPV isolates revealed the onset in 2000 of an unusual CPV-2 mutant with a change (Asp \u2192 Glu) occurring in the strategic residue 426 of the capsid (Buonavoglia et al., 2001). The Glu-426 mutant, also detected in other countries (Nakamura et al., 2004, Decaro et al., 2006d), is widely distributed in Italy and is currently replacing CPV-2b in the Italian dog population (Martella et al., 2004, Desario et al., 2005, Decaro et al., 2005d, Decaro et al., 2005e, Decaro et al., 2006b). In contrast with other mutations previously reported, such as Asp-300 and Pro-265, the mutation at residue 426 has probably provided the mutant with an evolutionary benefit. We are currently investigating whether this change really represents an advantage for viral spread and whether it has biological consequence (Decaro et al., 2005c). Since the mutation Asp426Glu affects the major antigenic region, that has been taken into account for classification of the variants 2a and 2b (Parrish et al., 1985, Parrish et al., 1991), the Glu-426 mutant has been referred to as new antigenic variant 2c (Decaro et al., 2005c, Decaro et al., 2006b).",

In this study, all tissues analysed were shown to contain CPV DNA, probably as a consequence of viral spread in the organism through the blood. The number of dogs was limited, with only four dogs analysed per each of the three CPV variants. In fact, in order to limit the variability of viral titres due to different ages, breeds and clinical courses of the disease, only pups were chosen that were mixed-bred, had approximately the same age and had died after a similar duration of disease (4\u20135 days) as a consequence of single CPV infection. Moreover, it was difficult to recruit dogs dead due to infection with CPV-2b, since this variant is disappearing progressively from the Italian dog population (Martella et al., 2004, Martella et al., 2005, Decaro et al., 2005c, Decaro et al., 2005e, Decaro et al., 2006a), and only one type 2b strain has been detected in Italy in 2006 (Decaro et al., unpublished data).",

It has been shown previously that shedding of CPV DNA in the faeces reaches maximal loads in the first days after infection (with a peak at 7\u20138 days post-infection), with a rapid decrease already at 10\u201311 days post-infection (Decaro et al., 2005a, Elia et al., 2005). Moreover, in the late stage of infection the high antibody levels in the gut lumen may sequestrate most of the virions, so that traditional tests, such as haemagglutination and virus isolation, give frequently false negative results (Decaro et al., 2005e, Desario et al., 2005). The results of the present work indicate that in laboratories where molecular methods are not employed routinely, traditional diagnostic methods for detection of CPV in dead dogs should be carried out on the internal organs rather than on the faeces or intestinal contents.",
