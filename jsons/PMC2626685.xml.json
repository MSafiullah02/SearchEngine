One form contains a signal peptide and can encode a protein that enters the secretory pathway (originally called Lse [lysosomal sialic acid acetylesterase]), whereas the other lacks this signal peptide and encodes a cytosolic esterase (25\u201327). Although the Lse protein was thought to localize to lysosomes, a site that would not be suitable for the modification of Siglec ligands, we have observed in transfected cells that this protein exhibits, at best, a limited lysosomal localization and is secreted and can bind to the surface of transfected cells (Figs. S1 and S2, available at http://www.jem.org/cgi/content/full/jem.20081399/DC1). The enzyme, therefore, has the potential to remove acetyl groups from 9-O-acetylated Siglec ligands in a post Golgi vesicle or at the cell surface. Although some antibodies against Siae have been generated, they lack the specificity to detect Siae in murine cells and tissue sections. The actual location of the Siae protein in murine B cells is therefore yet to be conclusively established.",

Mice were first bred into the C57BL/6 background for 10 generations. B cells from WT and Siae\u03942/\u03942 mice were gated on, and the accumulation of cytoplasmic calcium after ligation of the BCR was analyzed using flow cytometry. As seen in Fig. 2, BCR cross-linking resulted in an accelerated and enhanced calcium flux. A similar result was seen when purified splenic B cells from mutant and WT mice were analyzed (Fig. S4, available at http://www.jem.org/cgi/content/full/jem.20081399/DC1). These data suggested that in the absence of functional Siae, BCR signal strength is markedly enhanced and that this alteration in signal strength is an intrinsic property of mutant B lymphocytes.",

We sought to examine if there was a defect in CD22 signaling in Siae\u03942/\u03942 mice. After BCR cross-linking, CD22 was isolated by immunoprecipitation, and immunoprecipitates were examined for CD22 tyrosine phosphorylation and for associated SHP-1 using Western blot assays. As seen in Fig. 3 (left, experiment 1; and right, experiment 2), tyrosine phosphorylation of CD22 after BCR signaling was reduced in Siae\u03942/\u03942 mice in spite of similar levels of surface CD22 expression in WT and mutant mice (Figs. S5 and S6, available at http://www.jem.org/cgi/content/full/jem.20081399/DC1). Recruitment of SHP-1 by CD22 was clearly impaired after BCR ligation of Siae\u03942/\u03942 B cells as compared with WT B cells. This result showing diminished SHP-1 recruitment in Siae\u03942/\u03942 B cells is consistent with the accelerated enhancement in BCR signal strength observed in Siae\u03942/\u03942 mice.",

A well established reagent for the detection of 9-O-acetylated \u03b12\u20136-linked sialic acid is a fusion protein containing the Fc portion of human IgG and the influenza C hemagglutinin esterase treated with diisopropyl fluorophosphate (28). Modification of the catalytic serine nucleophile in this fusion protein by diisopropyl fluorophosphate permits the viral protein to bind to 9-O-acetyl sialic acid but not to cleave it. This reagent, designated CHE-FcD, binds to N-linked glycans that are decorated with 9-O-acetylated \u03b12\u20136-linked sialic acid moieties. As predicted, a consistent increase in 9-O-acetylation was detected in Siae\u03942/\u03942 B cells compared with WT B cells (Fig. 4).",

Four different CD22-null mutant mice have been described by different groups (13\u201316), and although enhanced antigen receptor signaling was observed in all four mutants, BCR-induced proliferation was enhanced in some mutants and diminished in others.

We examined follicular phenotype B cell populations in the perisinusoidal niche in Siae\u03942/\u03942 mice and noted a marked and selective loss of recirculating B cells in the BM (Fig. 5 C and Table II, fraction F), again paralleling a phenotypic alteration previously noted in CD22-null mice (14\u201316). We analyzed peritoneal B-1 B cell populations in Siae\u03942/\u03942 and WT mice and noted an increase in IgMhi CD43+ CD5\u2212 B1b B cells but decreased numbers of IgMhi CD5+ B1a B cells in Siae\u03942/\u03942 mice (Fig. 5 D). The CD22 mutants showed increased B1 cells (13), increased B1a cells (15), or normal numbers (16).",

            "text": "To determine whether the alteration in peripheral B cell populations reflected a cell-intrinsic defect in Siae function, we reconstituted Rag-1\u2212/\u2212 mice with hematopoietic stem cells from WT and Siae\u03942/\u03942 BM. Siae\u03942/\u03942 lymphocytes in reconstituted mice exhibited a defect in MZ B cell development and a reduction of perisinusoidal BM B cells (Fig. 5 E), which establishes that these developmental abnormalities represent lymphocyte-intrinsic defects. No gross defect in T cell development was discovered in the absence of Siae (Fig. 5 F), although there was a small decrease in T cell numbers both in the thymus and the spleen (Tables III and IV). Other B cell\u2013deficient mice have been reported to have a mild decrease in T cell numbers (36). The phenotype of Siae mutant mice in which a subtle alteration may have been generated in CD22 ligands is very different from that of the ST6GalI-null mouse, which completely lacks \u03b12\u20136-linked sialic acid and which presents with defects in B cell activation and in thymocyte development (37, 38). Murine CD22, unlike human CD22, has a markedly higher affinity for Neu5Gc (sialic acid with an N-glycolyl moiety in the C5 position; the major form in the mouse) as compared with Neu5Ac (sialic acid with an N-acetyl moiety in the C5 position) (39\u201342). The enzyme CMP-Neu-5Ac hydroxylase (CMAH) converts CMP-Neu5Ac to CMP-Neu5Gc, and mice lacking this enzyme not only synthesize N-glycans with a subtly different form of sialic acid that binds CD22 poorly but they also exhibit a poorly understood down-regulation of Siae expression and an increase in 9-O-acetylation of Neu5Ac (43). Cmah-null mice as well as Cmah/Siae double mutant mice would therefore be expected to exhibit BCR hyperreactivity, the relative loss of MZ B cells, and a relative loss of perisinusoidal B cells. Indeed, B cells from Cmah mutant mice have been reported to exhibit an enhanced proliferative response to BCR cross-linking (44). We show here that B cells from Cmah-null mice have higher levels of 9-O-acetyated sialic acid as revealed by CHE-FcD binding (Fig. S10, available at http://www.jem.org/cgi/content/full/jem.20081399/DC1). Both Cmah-null mice and Cmah/Siae double mutant mice present with enhanced BCR activation as measured by the release of intracellular calcium after antigen receptor ligation and, as predicted, present with marked reductions in MZ B cells and perisinusoidal B cells (Figs. S10 and S11). A combination of two changes in the structure of sialic acid that each compromise CD22 binding results in a phenotype that is similar to that seen in mice with enhanced 9-O-acetylation of sialic acid alone but is quite distinct from the phenotype of mice with the complete loss of \u03b12\u20136-linked sialic acid.",

Although these results imply that ligation of CD22 by \u03b12\u20136 sialic acid\u2013containing ligands contributes to inhibitory signaling, the precise role that sialoglyconjugates play in the function of CD22 remains to be determined with certainty. The phenotypes of CD22 KO mice clearly suggest that a major in vivo function of this Siglec is to attenuate BCR signaling, but other studies have suggested that CD22 may potentially contribute to both inhibitory and activating functions (47). Mutating or blocking the sialic acid binding site of CD22 in a cell line context led to a loss of CD22 inhibitory signaling as indicated by an enhanced calcium flux after BCR ligation (11, 48). Knockin mice harboring an identical mutation in the sialic acid binding site of CD22 exhibited some, but not all, of the phenotypic changes seen in CD22 null mice. Strikingly, an enhanced calcium flux was not observed in this knockin mouse after BCR ligation (22). Background-dependent modifier genes do contribute to differences seen in CD22-dependent phenotypes in KO and knockin animals, and there is growing evidence from SNP genotyping that even inbred mice strains are heterogenous at several loci (49). Nevertheless, no satisfactory explanation can be provided at present for the discrepant results of site directed mutagenesis-based studies of CD22 function.",

In mice lacking ST6GalI, the absence of ligands for CD22 might have been expected to result in enhanced BCR signaling. Instead, these mice exhibit a gross defect in B cell signaling after ligation of the BCR and of other mitogenic receptors in B cells (37). One interpretation provided for these data is that in the absence of \u03b12\u20136-linked sialic acid in the ST6GalI-null mouse, CD22 fails to multimerize and cannot be sequestered from the BCR (50). It is possible that in the absence of ST6GalI, inhibition of the BCR by CD22 is enhanced because of an abnormal facilitation of CD22 and IgM colocalization (23). However, the basis for this enhanced colocalization is not known, the reason for the relatively broad defect in signaling in ST6GalI mutant mice is not entirely clear, and is it not fully understood why these mice have defects in thymocyte development (38).",

Although these data have been interpreted to indicate a restoration in the absence of CD22 of BCR signaling that was diminished in the absence of ST6Gal I, both studies on cd22\u2212/\u2212/ST6GalI\u2212/\u2212 mice do not actually show a restoration of BCR signaling to WT levels but demonstrate that BCR signaling is enhanced in double mutant mice to levels similar to those seen in cd22\u2212/\u2212 B cells. The loss of CD22 may be considered to be dominant. These data are therefore compatible with the possibility that CD22 can provide inhibitory signals constitutively, presumably by providing ITIM tyrosines as a potential substrate for phosphorylation by Lyn and other Src family kinases. Nevertheless, CD22 might provide optimal inhibitory signals only in the presence of its sialoglycoconjugate ligands. The total absence of \u03b12\u20136-linked sialic acid may represent a relatively drastic alteration that could result in aberrant capping of N-acetyllactosamine termini of many glycans (52) and might affect B cell function adversely in poorly understood ways. A subtle alteration of the structure of CD22 ligands, such as enhanced 9-O-acetylation of sialic acid in mice with mutant Siae, or the combined loss of Neu5Gc and enhanced 9-O-acetylation of sialic acid in the Cmah-null mouse and the Cmah-Siae double mutant mouse both appear to provide somewhat different insights compared with those obtained from the ST6Gal1 KO mouse harboring a more global alteration in CD22 ligand structure.",

Collectively, the spontaneous secretion of increased levels of class switched immunoglobulins and antichromatin antibodies, the accumulation of glomerular immune complex deposits, and the apparent activation-dependent attrition of follicular B cells in Siae mutant mice suggest a stronger phenotype in these mice than that observed in mice lacking CD22. These data suggest indirectly that Siae might not only attenuate CD22 function but may also possibly regulate an additional Siglec or Siglecs in B cells, although direct evidence for such a hypothesis is lacking. A second inhibitory Siglec in murine B cells, Siglec G, has been previously described (53). However, although Siglec G\u2013deficient mice exhibit a marked increase in B-1a B cells, IgG autoantibodies are not increased. It remains to be determined whether this or any other Siglec, other than CD22, is regulated by Siae. It also remains to be determined if an engineered defect in Cmah leads to an autoimmune state.",

            "text": "It has been previously suggested that CD22, Lyn, and SHP-1 set a threshold for B cell activation (46). The enhanced BCR signaling noted in mice that lack CD22 and in Siae mutant mice suggests that loss of tolerance may result from a mechanism that is distinct from models invoking clonal deletion, receptor editing, and anergy, all of which might be presumed to be enhanced, not abrogated, by an increase in BCR signal strength in B cells. These well established mechanisms of tolerance have been studied extensively using transgenic and knockin models that use relatively high-affinity BCRs for model self-antigens. The analysis of anti\u2013HEL-soluble HEL double transgenic mice in a cd22-null background did not result in a break in tolerance to HEL (46, 54). We expand here on a suggestion originally made by Neuberger and coworkers (45) and also discussed by Cornall et al. (46) that CD22, and possibly other Siglecs, might set thresholds for the activation of B cells in the periphery. Weakly self-reactive B cells may not be activated by self-antigens because CD22 helps set an activation threshold in the periphery. If the strength of activation of B cells by self-antigens were to cross a threshold, the processing and presentation of self-antigens could be facilitated, and the unwanted entry of relatively weakly self-reactive B cells into the germinal center reaction might also occur. There are many potential ways in which, during an infection, a self-structure may be physically complexed with a foreign protein. In a viral infection, for instance, host chromatin may contain proteins of viral origin bound to host antigens including host nucleic acids. If the BCR threshold signaling is not set high enough (because of defects in CD22 or Siae for instance), self-antigens might not only activate weakly self-reactive B cells but may also deliver physically linked foreign proteins to endosomes in B cells, thus permitting the receipt of T cell help for somatic mutation. It is perhaps significant that in human autoimmune diseases in which antibodies are known to be relevant, pathogenic autoantibodies tend to be somatically mutated and class switched. Siglecs, assisted by Siae, presumably play a key role in keeping weakly self-reactive B cells quiescent. It is clear that analyses of responses to one specific T cell\u2013dependent synthetic immunogen are not apparently consonant with the spontaneous immunoglobulin and autoantibody levels observed in Siae mutant mice, and there is a need for more detailed immunization studies in these mutant mice and in controls.",

Although more than one sialic acid O-acetyl transferase may exist (55), to date no such O-acetyl transferase has been molecularly identified.

Furthermore, our ongoing unpublished studies involving deep resequencing of the SIAE gene in human controls, and patients with autoimmunity have revealed a strong association of rare loss-of-function variants of SIAE with autoimmune disease, suggesting that the regulatory function of Siae is not restricted to rodents (unpublished data).",
