            "text": "The renin-angiotensin system (RAS) is one of the most potent cardiovascular regulators and an important target for therapeutic drugs. From 120 yr ago, when renin was discovered (148), until 30 yr ago, only one peptide was thought to be active in this system: angiotensin II (ANG II). It was shown to be produced by successive digestion of angiotensinogen by the enzymes renin and angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE), with ANG I as an intermediate, and to interact with a receptor, now called the ANG II type 1 receptor (AT1R). Physiologically, AT1R activation by ANG II elicits vasoconstriction, water intake, and Na+ retention. Pathophysiologically, activation of ACE/ANG II/AT1R signaling is associated with oxidative stress, hypertrophy, fibrosis, and inflammation. This view of the RAS began to change when, in 1988, Santos et al. (125) discovered the formation of ANG-(1\u22127) from ANG I by an ACE-independent pathway, and Schiavone et al. (131) showed the vasopressin-releasing activity of this heptapeptide in neural tissue explants. One year later, the first in vivo actions of ANG-(1\u22127) were described (16). At about the same time, a second receptor for ANG II [the ANG II type 2 receptor (AT2R)] was found (21, 159). In the following 30 yr until now, the physiological functions of these two alternative pathways of the RAS have been extensively studied, and it was shown that ANG-(1\u22127) via its receptor, Mas (127), as well as ANG II via AT2R counteract the classical RAS resulting in vasodilation, anti-inflammation, antifibrosis, and antiapoptosis, conferring beneficial effects in the settings of cardiovascular diseases (19, 128, 144). A central role in regulating the relative activities of the RAS arms in a tissue is played by the local levels of the enzyme ACE2, which transforms ANG II into ANG-(1\u22127) (31, 149). It was only a logical consequence of these findings that compounds were developed to activate the two protective arms of the RAS, which are undergoing clinical evaluation at the moment (5). However, the full complement of angiotensin peptides is still not completed, because Lautner et al. (74) and Jankowsky et al. (60) recently discovered a novel class, which we suggest to call \u201calatensins,\u201d with an alanine at the amino-terminal position instead of the aspartate in the classical angiotensin peptides. Although Ala1-ANG II interacts with the same receptors as ANG II, AT1R, and AT2R, Ala1-ANG-(1\u22127) (alamandine) has its own receptor, Mas-related G protein-coupled receptor D (MrgD) (74).",

            "text": "ACE2 is a type I transmembrane protein consisting of an extracellular amino-terminal domain containing the catalytic site and an intracellular carboxy-terminal tail (31, 149). ACE2 functions as a carboxymonopeptidase with the Arg273 residue being critical for substrate binding and enzymatic activity (49). As a carboxymonopeptidase, ACE2 degrades ANG II to generate the heptapeptide ANG-(1\u22127) and ANG I to generate the nonapeptide ANG-(1\u22129) by hydrolyzing the carboxy-terminal amino acid (31, 121, 149). ANG-(1\u22129) can be further converted to ANG-(1\u22127) by ACE. In the same manner, ACE2 can also cleave and partially inactivate pyr-apelin-13 and apelin-17 peptides (155). In addition to being an enzyme, ACE2 is a transmembrane protein that also acts as an amino acid transporter and is targeted by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (109). ACE2 is widely expressed in the cardiovascular system, kidneys, lungs, and brain to protect these organs from excessive ANG II signaling (32, 42, 54, 71, 99, 161). In the heart, both ACE2 and Mas are expressed in cardiomyocytes, cardiofibroblasts, and the coronary vasculature (58, 103, 108, 123, 124, 126). ACE2 activity is regulated by a disintegrin and metalloproteinase domain-containing protein 17 (ADAM-17; also known as TNF-\u03b1-converting enzyme) and apelin. ADAM-17 acts as a negative regulator of ACE2 tissue activity by proteolytically cleaving ACE2, resulting in the shedding of ACE2 into the interstitium, leading to decreased ACE2 activity in the tissue and elevated circulating ACE2 activity (103, 109). Deletion of this negative regulator (ADAM-17 or TNF-\u03b1-converting enzyme) protects the heart and vasculature in conditions of myocardial infarction, hypertension, pressure overload, and aortic aneurysm (34, 35, 43, 135, 136). Unlike ADAM-17, apelin regulates ACE2 expression. In mice, knockout of apelin is associated with lower ACE2 expression levels and exacerbated ANG II-induced cardiac hypertrophy and dysfunction (172). Treatment of apelin knockouts with pyr1-apelin-13 normalized ACE2 expression and counteracted ANG II-induced cardiac hypertrophy and dysfunction (172). Interestingly, ACE2 can also degrade and inactivate apelin peptides, creating a self-regulating negative feedback loop (155).",

Studies using rhACE2 and ACE2 purified from sheep tissues showed that ANG II is the preferred substrate for ACE2 (48, 107, 134, 149, 153, 162, 173). In rats, changes in ACE2 correlated with plasma ANG-(1\u22129) levels (93), whereas rhACE2 efficiently converted infused ANG II into ANG-(1\u22127) (80). In mice, rhACE2 counteracts detrimental ANG II signaling, and these therapeutic effects are mediated via ANG-(1\u22127) (102, 107, 173). Also, in human studies, rhACE2 clearly lowered plasma ANG II levels and increased plasma ANG-(1\u22127) levels (6, 109). In the heart, ANG-(1\u22127) is primarily generated by ACE2 (41, 173), whereas plasma ANG-(1\u22127) is primarily produced by neprilysin from ANG I because inhibition of neprilysin reduced ANG-(1\u22127) levels and increased ANG II levels (111). The degradation of ANG-(1\u22127) is governed predominantly by the amino-terminal catalytic domain of ACE, which degrades ANG-(1\u22127) to ANG-(1\u22125) (28). Inhibition of ACE increases plasma levels of ANG-(1\u22127) in both rodents and humans (3, 6, 20).",

Activation of the RAS and increased ANG II levels play a pivotal role in adverse myocardial remodeling and disease progression (6, 85, 87) contributing to systolic and diastolic dysfunction in patients with HF (13, 57). Use of ACE inhibitors does not necessarily result in lower ANG II formation because ANG II levels can remain elevated in optimally treated patients with HF. In fact, ~50% of patients using current ACE inhibition therapies exhibit elevated levels of ANG II, which is probably the result of increased ANG I levels and activity of mast cell chymase (6, 62, 78, 113, 158). This ACE-independent ANG II production highlights a need for a better understanding of the contribution of various parts of the RAS to HF progression.",

Under the conditions of elevated ANG II levels, loss of protective ACE2 activity worsens cardiac dysfunction, hypertrophy, and fibrosis, leading to greater diastolic dysfunction (2, 173). Supplying rhACE2 decreased plasma and myocardial ANG II levels and increased plasma ANG-(1\u22127) levels, resulting in attenuated pathological remodeling and corrected diastolic dysfunction (173). Even partial loss of ACE2 (in heterozygous female mice) is sufficient to enhance the susceptibility to heart disease, which is a clinically relevant observation because ACE2 is downregulated in human hearts with dilated cardiomyopathy (156). Increase in soluble ACE2, which reflects loss of tissue-bound ACE2, is associated with severity of HF and serves as an independent predictor of major adverse cardiac events (6, 33, 119). Because shedding of ACE2 is mediated via ADAM-17 (59, 103, 163), it suggests a possible involvement of ADAM-17 in the development of HF. Involvement of ADAM-17 in HF development has been shown primarily in relation to the TNF-\u03b1 signaling pathway in humans (129, 130) and in mouse models of heart disease (34, 66). However, in light of the findings that ANG II induces ADAM-17-dependent cleavage of ACE2, it becomes clear that ANG II, ADAM-17, and ACE2 create a potentially dangerous positive feedback loop conducive to the development of HF (103). Conversely, loss of ANG-(1\u22127) actions exacerbated heart disease in an ACE2-deficient state (102), whereas inhibition of ANG-(1\u22127)/Mas signaling prevented rhACE2-mediated cardioprotection (107), confirming the importance of ANG-(1\u22127) contribution to the cardioprotective effects of ACE2. Supplying ANG-(1\u22127) directly was also cardioprotective in preclinical models of heart disease (81, 88, 118, 145). ANG-(1\u22127) suppressed cardiomyocyte growth and myocardial infarction-induced ventricular hypertrophy and decreased myocardial levels of proinflammatory cytokines, leading to a reduction in myocardial inflammation (118, 145). ANG-(1\u22127) activation of Mas results in the activation of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)-Akt-endothelial nitric oxide (NO) synthase (eNOS), upregulation of MAPK phosphatase (84), inhibition of PKC-p38 MAPK and reactive oxygen species production (50, 102, 173), and suppression of collagen expression (reducing myocardial fibrosis) (29, 44, 124), thereby antagonizing pathological effects of ANG II (88, 109, 127). In addition to ANG-(1\u22127), ANG-(1\u22129), the product of ACE2 degradation of ANG I, is antihypertrophic, antifibrotic, and antihypertensive in models of hypertension and myocardial infarction (36, 37, 94, 95).",

            "text": "Diabetes and obesity are major causes of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality worldwide and result in microvascular and macrovascular complications, including hypertension (174). Diabetic heart disease, linked to systolic and diastolic dysfunctions, and HF (39, 47, 70, 174) are associated with activation of the RAS (11, 12, 56, 90). Obesity, the major metabolic precursor to type 2 diabetes, is an independent risk factor for the development of HF with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) (68, 69, 98, 166). Emerging preclinical and clinical data strongly support a key pathogenic role for ACE2 and ANG-(1\u22127) in the progression of cardiovascular diseases (109, 132, 142). In a model of type 2 diabetes (db/db), ANG-(1\u22127) rescued diastolic dysfunction and reduced cardiac hypertrophy, fibrosis, lipotoxicity, and adipose inflammation (89, 100). Conversely, in the settings of high-fat diet-induced obesity, loss of ACE2 worsened heart disease because of increased epicardial adipose tissue inflammation, myocardial lipotoxicity, and worsened cardiac insulin resistance (105). ANG-(1\u22127) prevented these changes and rescued HFpEF in ACE2 knockout mice (105). These findings, coupled with the protective effects of ACE2 and ANG-(1\u22127) in the vasculature and adipose tissue, support inflammation and microvascular dysfunction as key mediators of HFpEF (110, 116). These results suggest that in patients with HFpEF, epicardial adipose tissue inflammation may be related to cardiac dysfunction and adverse remodeling (105, 106). In patients with obesity, administration of ANG-(1\u22127) improved insulin-stimulated endothelium-dependent vasodilation and blunted endothelin-1-dependent vasoconstrictor tone (132). Therefore, enhancing the ACE2 and ANG-(1\u22127) pathways represents a potential therapy for HFpEF, a condition with an adverse prognosis that lacks effective therapy.",

            "text": "Alamandine has been reported to reverse hyperhomocysteinemia-induced vascular dysfunction. Activation of PKA appears to be involved in this effect (117). In adipose tissue, an alamandine-induced reduction of leptin has been described through a mechanism involving Src/p38 MAPK (150). As previously described for ANG-(1\u22127), an inclusion compound of alamandine/2-hydroxypropyl (HP)-\u03b2-cyclodextrin reduced blood pressure in nonanesthetized spontaneously hypertensive rats. Likewise, as previously observed for ANG-(1\u22127) (83), oral administration of alamandine/HP-\u03b2-cyclodextrin attenuated the cardiac profibrotic effect of isoproterenol in Sprague-Dawley rats (50). More recently, a cardioprotective effect of alamandine has been described in an experimental model of sepsis (79). In keeping with these effects, it has been reported that knockdown of MrgD in mice leads to marked dilated cardiomyopathy (96). Centrally, the action of alamandine resembles those described for ANG\u2010(1\u22127) in the rostral ventrolateral medulla, caudal ventrolateral medulla, and hypothalamus (38, 74, 137, 140). These observations suggest that, as described for ANG II and ANG\u2010(1\u22127), alamandine may act as a neuronal excitatory molecule in the brain. However, striking differences between these two peptides are becoming progressively evident (61, 82). For instance, in the insular cortex, alamandine but not ANG\u2010(1\u22127) promotes excitatory cardiovascular effects, including increases in blood pressure and heart rate associated with increased renal sympathetic activity (82). Moreover, ANG-(1\u22127) [and ANG II/AT2Rs (112, 168)] promotes NO release mainly by activating the PI3K/Akt/eNOS pathway (124), whereas alamandine leads to NO release by a mechanism not involving this pathway (Fig. 2). AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) appears to be the main target for alamandine-induced NO formation (61).",

            "text": "It was well demonstrated by Jankowski and colleagues that ANG A binds and produces biological effects through interactions with AT1Rs (60). This finding was confirmed by other authors (23, 167). However, the relationship of ANG A and AT1Rs apparently is not as straightforward as it appears. The vasoconstrictor effect of ANG A is smaller than that of ANG II, despite the fact that the affinity of both peptides for AT1Rs is remarkably similar (60). This could be because of the formation of alamandine, as we have previously hypothesized (74). However, in isolated cardiomyocytes, ANG A was essentially ineffective in promoting electrically stimulated Ca2+ influx (23). In the same preparation, ANG II was active. Accordingly, a 10-fold difference between ANG II and ANG A for intracellular Ca2+ release in vascular smooth muscle cells was observed by Jankowski et al. (60). These observations suggest that ANG A could be a biased agonist of AT1Rs. This possibility has not been explored yet.",

In contrast to ANG-(1\u22127), which has no effect on blood pressure, alamandine produced a dose-response U-shaped decrease in blood pressure. The maximal decrease in blood pressure was achieved by intravenous administration of 20 pg/animal. To test whether the U-shaped dose-response was because of stimulation of AT1Rs, the experiments were repeated in losartan-treated rats. In this condition, a magnification of the hypotensive response was observed (Fig. 3). However, the U-shaped form was still evident. These results suggest that alamandine is more potent than ANG-(1\u22127) as a vasodilator and that AT1Rs are involved in alamandine effects. A similar conclusion was drawn by Soltani Hekmat et al. (141) in pentobarbital-anesthetized rats. However, a more general conclusion about the modulatory role of AT1Rs on the cardiovascular effects of alamandine cannot be drawn in other rat strains (Wistar and spontaneously hypertensive stroke-prone rats), because losartan abolished rather than increased alamandine vasorelaxant action (75). In addition, in the caudal ventrolateral medulla, blockade of AT1Rs did not alter the hypotensive effect of alamandine (140).",

ANG-(1\u22127) stimulation led to differential regulation of 121 phosphosites from 79 proteins, including dephosphorylation of Ser256 on the transcription factor FOXO1, leading to its activation. FOXO1 is an important regulator of tumor suppression and cell metabolism (46, 72). FOXO1 activation by ANG-(1\u22127) seems to be an important molecular event on the antitumoral effect attributed to this heptapeptide. One could not anticipate that ANG-(1\u22127) would induce FOXO1 activation before this phosphoproteomic study because Akt1, a crucial player of ANG-(1\u22127) signaling (124), induces FOXO1 phosphorylation and inhibition (15). Thus, this is a fine example of how phosphoproteomics can help one building an unbiased and comprehensive signaling network. Nevertheless, it is clear that other upstream players yet to be identified are responsible for FOXO1 dephosphorylation upon Mas activation.",

Four groups independently discovered that activation of phosphatases seemed to be a major signaling mechanism of the AT2R, whereas the AT1R signals mainly through kinase-driven signaling cascades. Although Bottari et al. (9) found in 1992 that, in general, AT2R activation leads to tyrosine dephosphorylation, in subsequent years, the groups of Sumners, Dzau, and Nahmias identified protein phosphatase 2 (PP2A) (63), MAPK phosphatase 1 (165), and SHP-1 (92) as specific AT2R-stimulated phosphatases. At the same time, it was excluded that the AT2R couples to \u201cconventional\u201d G proteins such as Gq or Gs proteins (10). However, coupling to Gi proteins was demonstrated and shown to be involved in the modulation of ion channel currents and activation of PP2A (55, 63). The lack of conventional G protein coupling of the AT2R was elegantly explained by a Nature publication from 2017, which reported the crystalline structure of the AT2R (170). Although this study confirmed that the AT2R displays all characteristics of a 7-transmembrane, class A G protein-coupled receptor, the authors unexpectedly discovered that upon activation of the AT2R, intracellular helix 8 changes its orientation in a way that it interacts with intracellular helixes III, V, and VI, thereby sterically blocking binding of conventional G proteins and \u03b2-arrestins.",

This holds true, in particular, for the initiation of signaling upon receptor activation. What is known, however, is that the third intracellular loop and COOH-terminal end of the AT2R seem crucial for AT2R signaling (114, 115). In fact, some initial signaling molecules, such as SHP-1, PP2A, and AT2R-interacting protein, interact directly with the AT2R upon receptor activation: SHP-1 and PP2A (probably under involvement of Gi) with the third intracellular loop (64, 133) and AT2R-interacting protein with the COOH-terminal end (8). Certain kinases may be involved, too, in this early initiation of signaling, such as tyrosine kinase c-Src (133).",

In the context of HF, several of these actions work together in a well-orchestrated way. For example, in rats with HF caused by myocardial infarction, AT2R stimulation acts in an anti-inflammatory manner by reducing cytokine synthesis and in an antifibrotic manny by inhibition of transforming growth factor-\u03b2 generation, thus ameliorating peri-infarct remodeling, which again results in improved cardiac function (65, 73). An antifibrotic effect was also seen in the right ventricles of rats with pulmonary hypertension (14). Right ventricular fibrosis leading to HF is in fact a major pathomechanism determining mortality in patients with pulmonary hypertension. In another model of ischemia-induced HF (coronary ligation model), central administration of the AT2R agonist C21 for 7 days by intracerebroventricular infusion significantly reduced sympathetic outflow and improved baroreceptor sensitivity, both mechanisms with a proven beneficial effect on HF (40).",

This heptapeptide has emerged as a major protective peptide in the cardiovascular system. Clinical and experimental findings have demonstrated that ACE2 and ANG-(1\u22127) comprise the dominant mechanism for protective regulation of the RAS in many types of HF. ANG-(1\u22127) generated by ACE2-dependent conversion of ANG II is a crucial mediator of the cardioprotective effects, which makes ANG-(1\u22127) a promising therapy for HF.",

Indeed, a recent study has described the beneficial effects of an oral formulation of hydroxypropyl-\u03b2-cyclodextrin/ANG-(1\u22127) in volunteers submitted to isometric overload muscle damage (7). This study, which is the first to test the effects of an oral formulation of ANG-(1\u22127) in humans, opens new possibilities for testing the actions of ANG-(1\u22127) and therapeutic effects in patients.",
