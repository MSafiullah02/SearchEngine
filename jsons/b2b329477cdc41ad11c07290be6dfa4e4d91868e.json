Another significant finding of this study is that the government's, organizations' and nurses' perceptions of new emerging respiratory infectious diseases were influenced by their previous experience with SARS. Similar to previous studies, nurses working at the 'front line' believed that infection from these diseases was an unavoidable occupational hazard.",

[11] [12] [13] In contrast, however, Grace et al. found that HCWs perceived a low likelihood of being infected with SARS. 14 In many studies there were personal and organizational characteristics that were more likely to increase the HCW's perceived personal health risk. Personal factors included: being younger; 15 being female; 16 working as a nurse (in comparison with a physician); 15, 16 perceiving that the virus was lethal; 15 daily exposure to SARS patients; 17 perceiving little personal control over their exposure to the virus; 8 and having a high Impact of Event Scale score, indicating emotional distress. 10 Organizational factors found by some authors to increase HCW's perceived risks included: a perception of the insufficiency and ineffectiveness of the health-care organization's infection control measures; 12, 15 inability of the health-care organization to provide timely updates and information; 11 and their inability to fulfil additional work responsibilities required of them during an outbreak. 11 However, Grace et al. found that HCWs in their study did not perceive the effectiveness of the hospital infection control measures and the hospital's ability to provide education and updates to influence their risk perceptions. 14 ",

Thus this study aimed to provide some data on this gap in the literature. Additionally, there have been no published studies, to date, that explore nurse's perceptions of risk from different types of respiratory infectious diseases (e.g. between SARS and Type A Influenza-H1N1). As such, this study also aimed to fill this gap in knowledge.",

Finally, the study findings clearly indicate that although participants perceived themselves to be at risk of infection, all of them were accepting of these risks as they saw it to be part of their professional obligation. HCWs surveyed in studies about their risk perceptions during SARS and possible pandemic influenza pandemics likewise expressed the same perceptions and willingness to serve in such pandemics. 8, 10, 43, 44 In addition to the similarities of previous research, particularly into perceptions of risk and SARS, this study adds to the existing knowledge in several ways. First, it was apparent that the nurses were fearful of being infected by others-patients, colleagues, visitors to the organization. This fear was heightened by patients or visitors or colleagues who did not comply with the infectious disease precautions, in particular the use of PPE. Second, it appears that previous experience of one pandemic prepared these nurses for subsequent epidemics.

Their past experience during SARS had equipped them with the knowledge of personal risk-mitigating strategies, several of which had already become habits for some of the participants. Furthermore, these strategies-having had successfully mitigated the risk of exposure to participants during SARS-were perceived as being effective, hence lowering their risk perceptions from the outset and throughout the H1N1 outbreak. These findings are similar to Brewer et al. who postulated that individuals may have already factored in the effects of their risk-mitigating behaviour when determining their levels of personal risk. 48 To date, no studies pertaining to emerging acute respiratory infectious diseases have been found to examine this unique relationship, that is, the distinction between behaviour-conditioned and behaviour-unconditioned risk perceptions. 6",
