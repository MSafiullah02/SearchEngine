Within Wuhan and other areas of very high community transmission and background COVID-19 cases, we want to prevent any possible infection in our IBD cohorts. This requires more extreme social distancing measures including social isolation of themselves and their close contacts. The Chinese Society of Gastroenterology have recommended the measures of withholding immunosuppressive therapies due to possible increased risk of infection and worsening of COVID-19 infection course. 4 Given these unprecedented times, actions such as possibly withholding immunosuppressive medications might be indicated to prevent infections due to potential worsening infection course. However, local guidelines and isolation measures should be dictated by the background rate of COVID-19 infection in the community. Although patients with IBD are considered to be more susceptible to infections compared to the general population owing to the immune-mediated nature of IBD as well as the immunosuppressive effects of treatment, it remains unclear if they are at a high risk for COVID-19 infection with current registry studies that are ongoing such as SECURE-IBD.
