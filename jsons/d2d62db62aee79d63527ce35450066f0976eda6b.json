Our hospital serves an ethnically and socioeconomically diverse population being close to New York City. A significant number of patients displayed abnormal laboratory measurements at the time of admission. A COVID-19 laboratory order set was used in the EMR to order labs at the time of hospital admission or ICU transfer which included IL-6, ferritin, CRP, triglyceride, Fibrinogen, D-dimer, CMP and CBC with differential. The majority of patients were admitted to the ICU because of acute hypoxemic respiratory failure that required respiratory support. Endotracheal intubation and invasive mechanical ventilation were needed in a significant proportion of the patients. Several key findings were observed. Several key findings were observed in the Tocilizumab group laboratory values of IL-6, Ferritin, Triglyceride and Fibrinogen were significantly higher indicating that these patients demonstrated cytokine storms. Early laboratory evaluation may be crucial in identifying cytokine storm, and may also aid clinicians in identifying patients at high risk of decompensation, ICU admission, and potentially even death. A study from China reported that increased expression of interleukin (IL)-2R and IL-6 in serum appears to predict the severity and prognosis of patients with COVID-19 18 . Elevated levels of the inflammatory indicator IL-6 in the blood have been reported to be predictive of a fatal outcome in patients with Out of all patients who received Tocilizumab 84.09 % were male and 15.91% were females.

Cytokine Release Syndrome (CRS) occurs in a large number of patients with severe COVID-19, which is also an important cause of death.

Results have to be interpreted with caution since this a retrospective study and mortality is affected by multiple, confounding factors. In the largest clinical trials database (clinicaltrials.gov) there are 35 ongoing studies registered around the world regarding the use of Tocilizumab in COVID-19 patients. We await the results of ongoing randomized controlled trials to definitely answer the question of whether Tocilizumab improves survival in COVID-19 ARDS patients.",
