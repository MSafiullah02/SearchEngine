A recent multicenter observational cohort study, in which ARDS was defined according to the Berlin criteria, reported that the prevalence of ARDS was 10.4% at ICU admission and that its overall hospital mortality was 40.0% [4]. Because ARDS has a high prevalence and mortality in ICU, it is important to determine a precise prognosis that allows clinicians to predict the clinical course of ARDS and decide on a treatment plan. To do this consistently and reasonably, a scoring system is required.",

The APPS is a 9-point score that is calculated by measuring the age, PaO2/FIO2 ratio, and plateau pressure at 24 h after the patient is diagnosed with moderate to severe ARDS and counting each one to 1\u20133. Since many variables are not needed for calculations, clinicians can easily predict the in-hospital mortality of mechanically ventilated patients with moderate to severe ARDS patients at bedside [10]. However, one of the limitations of APPS was that it was derived and validated in cohorts from a number of Spanish hospitals and one American hospital. It has not been validated in an Asian population. Few studies have examined the geographic variation in the incidence rate of ARDS as defined by the Berlin criteria, and it remains unclear whether the features of ARDS in Asia differ from those in Western countries [4, 11]. In this context, we aimed to validate APPS externally for mechanically ventilated ARDS patients in Korea and assess the differences between Asian and Western populations.",

Patients in a ward or ICU had respiratory failure within a week and started receiving mechanical ventilation after intubation in the ICU. They had bilateral opacity in chest imaging, proved not to be due to cardiac failure or fluid overload, which was evaluated by transthoracic echocardiography if necessary. In the ventilator setting, the peak end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) was 5 cmH2O or above. The PaO2/FIO2 ratio of the patients was 200 mmHg or below. Although patients were not treated according to strict protocols, it was recommended that patients received lung-protective mechanical ventilation, i.e., were ventilated with a low tidal volume of 4\u20138 mL/kg predicted body weight. The study excluded patients who were not intubated within 24 h after ARDS diagnosis because the calculation of APPS requires measurement of the plateau pressure. It also excluded patients who died or were discharged less than 24 h after diagnosis.",

Since the APPS was calculated at 24 h after ARDS diagnosis, we read age, PaO2/FIO2 ratios and maximal airway pressure at 24 h after ARDS diagnosis. When several measurements were available, the measurements taken at the closest time 24 h after diagnosis were selected. Grade 1 was defined as a score of 3\u20134 points, grade 2 as 5\u20137 points and grade 3 as 8\u20139 points. However, one difference was that this study used the maximal airway pressure rather than the plateau pressure because almost all of the patients in SNUH ICU received pressure-controlled mechanical ventilation. Under most conditions, maximal airway pressure during pressure-controlled ventilation is roughly equivalent to plateau pressure during volume-controlled ventilation.",

The original report that proposed APPS stated that the C-statistic of APPS was 0.755 (95% CI 0.699\u20130.811) in the derivation cohort, and 0.800 (95% CI, 0.750\u20130.850) in the validation cohort [10]; the C-statistic of APPS for the present study was similar to that of the original study. In contrast, in a spatial validation study conducted in the Netherlands [13], APPS was not well calibrated, with a relatively low C-statistic value of 0.62 (95% CI 0.56\u20130.67), indicating a relatively low predictive accuracy. There are several possible reasons for the difference between these two external validation results. First, there was a difference in the severity of the illness in the patients. In the present study, the hospital mortality rate was 72.3% and the mean APACHE II score of all patients was 34.3 \u00b1 8.3, both higher than those in the Dutch study, in which APPS was not effective in predicting mortality in the group with low scores. Similarly, in our study, patients with an APPS score of 3, which is the lowest possible score, had relatively high mortality but decreased APPS predictive accuracy. This suggests that APPS may be more accurately predictive in patients with more severe disease. Second, there may be ethnic differences in the validation of APPS. Although there are no previous studies of the relationship between Asian ethnicity and ARDS mortality, a retrospective study reported that African\u2013American and Hispanic patients with ARDS had a significantly higher risk of death than Caucasian patients [14]. Another study reported that although African\u2013American patients had more severe clinical manifestations of ARDS than Caucasian patients, their incidence of ARDS was lower [15]. ARDS is a complex clinical syndrome involving various pathophysiologic mechanisms, and environmental and genetic factors are implicated in its development and progression [16]. There has been no report identifying specific genetic polymorphisms that affect the prognosis of ARDS in Asians, but some studies have shown that genetic polymorphisms associated with inflammation, innate immunity, epithelial cell function, and angiogenesis are related to the prognosis of ARDS [17\u201322]. Therefore, the heterogeneity of ethnicity-related factors in ARDS may have affected the predictive accuracy of the APPS.",

One study reported that the APACHE II score was a predictor of mortality in ARDS, but that it was less relevant than other indicators such as age [23]. The APACHE II score is a general scoring system for ICU patients and may be less predictive when applied to ARDS patients. The Murray lung injury score for assessing the severity of acute lung injury was suggested in 1988 [24], and the CESAR study showed that ECMO treatment improved survival in ARDS patients with severe respiratory failure (Murray score > 3 or pH < 7.20) [25]. However, the Murray score has been criticized for its lack of specificity and validation in ARDS patients [26]. In contrast, APPS is specific for predicting the prognosis of ARDS and can be calculated easily, and thus can be used in clinical practice.",

Many of the patients had various underlying diseases, including malignancy, because of the characteristics of the tertiary hospital in Korea. Only a small number of patients had a low APPS because the general condition of most of the patients was very severe. Nevertheless, this study confirmed that APPS was as valid in Asian patients as it was in the original study in Western countries, and because of its specificity and simplicity, could be used in the treatment and research of ARDS patients in Asian countries. However, a multicenter prospective cohort study in Asia is needed to produce more reliable results. Second, the present study validated APPS differently from the original study by using maximal airway pressure instead of plateau pressure. We had difficulty monitoring plateau pressure in our patients because they all received pressure-controlled mechanical ventilation. However, despite these differences in validation procedure, this study showed that APPS could be appropriately applied using maximal airway pressure instead of plateau pressure. In the external validation study conducted in the Netherlands, it was also performed using maximal airway pressure instead of plateau pressure [13]. This suggested that APPS is more clinically useful than other scoring systems for predicting the prognosis of ARDS because, in clinical practice, the protocol for mechanical ventilation therapy may be different for each ICU.",
