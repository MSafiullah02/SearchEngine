The facility provides a wide range of services in addition to medical and nursing care, including physical, occupational, speech and language, creative arts, child life, recreational therapies, and education in an on-site school. Length of stay ranges from 1 day to 21 years, with an average of 4 years. Because of the long-term nature of care at this facility and high demand for pediatric skilled nursing care in this region, the census and acuity remained stable over time. Most children (>95%) had cognitive impairment throughout the study. Prevalence of common devices assessed at the beginning and end of the study included feeding tubes (85% and 82%, respectively), tracheostomies (51% and 44%, respectively), and mechanical ventilation (12% and 20%, respectively).",

One reason for the disparate results may be differing methods of ascertaining hand hygiene compliance. We measured electronically monitored frequency of hand hygiene, whereas previous studies assessed adherence to hand hygiene protocols using direct observation of hand hygiene opportunities. Because timing and appropriateness of hand hygiene may be more critical for infection prevention than overall frequency, our results may be biased toward the null. Another reason for the difference in findings may be the study population. Children in pediatric long-term care likely have more frequent contact with a greater number and variety of staff members compared with residents in adult long-term care, which would make transmission events more likely.4, 6 Children also may be more susceptible to gastrointestinal and acute respiratory infections because of their age and immunologic immaturity.5 Furthermore, viral pathogens that are more common among children (eg, rhinovirus) may be more likely to be spread via the droplet route and therefore less preventable through hand hygiene.8 Finally, our study may have lacked sufficient power to detect associations between hand hygiene frequency and the occurrence of outbreaks, particularly if the magnitude of association were small.",

Hand hygiene was captured electronically and anonymously on an ongoing basis, therefore avoiding observer biases and other measurement biases, such as the Hawthorne effect.9 To ensure reliability and validity of the electronic monitoring system, we randomly selected dispensers at several points throughout the study and compared observed hand hygiene events with those captured by the system and found no discrepancies. It is possible that some hand hygiene events were not recorded by the system, for example if they were performed using personal bottles of hand sanitizer. However, this practice was discouraged and unlikely to have varied over time. In addition, structured state-level mandatory reporting allowed for systematic and consistent ascertainment of outbreaks throughout the study period.",
