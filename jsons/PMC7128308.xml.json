Gene segments are derived from H9N2 viruses of poultry origin and the haemagglutinin and neuraminidase gene segments come from wild-bird origin H7 and N9 viruses, respectively.1 71% of 131 reported cases have been in individuals older than 50 years,3 and thus such patients seem more at risk of severe disease and death than are younger individuals.4\n",

Rapid and strong CD4 and CD8 T-cell responses were recorded in individuals infected with the pandemic A H1N1 virus,12 which might have been absent in older patients as a result of protective pre-existing antibodies to pandemic A H1N1 virus, resulting in higher susceptibility to infection with H7N9 virus (figure\n). Similarly, yearly vaccination of high-risk patients against seasonal influenza prevented the induction of virus-specific CD8 T-cell responses, which would usually be induced by natural infection with seasonal influenza viruses13 and was noted in animal models.14 A possible explanation is that the presence of cross-reactive antibodies predisposed for more severe disease, a finding that, although not previously noted in influenza, has been reported for some viral diseases.15\n",

The rate and timing of pandemic A H1N1 virus infections might have revealed the differences in H7N9 disease outcome, by contrast with historical infections with seasonal influenza A H3N2 viruses. This counterproductive imprinting of immunity might increase susceptibility to H7N9 virus infection. For that reason, older individuals should be given priority for vaccination if sustained person-to-person transmission of H7N9 viruses emerges. To obtain a better understanding of the role of imprinting of the adaptive immune system in H7N9 disease severity, prospective cohort studies in which cross-reactive T-cell immunity and virus-specific serum antibodies are tested for are imperative before possible wider spread of the virus.",
