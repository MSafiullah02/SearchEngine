The most common method for assessing colostrum quality was visual assessment, which may identify obviously watery, bloody or discoloured colostrum. 5 However, visual assessment is not a reliable method of assessing colostrum quality. 18 More reliable on-farm methods for measuring colostrum quality include the use of colostrometers and Brix refractometers. Colostrometers have high specificity, but low sensitivity, resulting in samples being falsely classified as high quality. There are several factors such as fat content, other solids and temperature that may also affect colostrometer readings. 19, 20 The Brix refractometer provides an acceptable estimate of IgG in first-milking bovine colostrum and can be easily carried out cow-side. 21 A potential limitation to using a Brix refractometer to measure colostrum quality is that colostrum with a high fat content may result in a wide band of colour transitioning (from blue to white) when reading the Brix refractometer. 21 Although both the Brix refractometer and colostrometer have their limitations, they both are rapid and low-cost cow-side tests that may be useful for differentiating low-quality and high-quality colostrum.
