The lungs are continually exposed to inhaled gases, particulates, and airborne pathogens as a result of daily inhalation of tens of thousands of liters of air. Despite these exposures, the lower airways are able to remain sterile due to the remarkable and efficient host defense systems of the pulmonary mucosal surface. This surface consists of epithelial cells and other cells, such as T cells and dendritic cells, that are able to respond to microbial exposures by activation of humoral and cell-mediated immune responses and the production of inflammatory mediators (i.e., cytokines, chemokines, and antimicrobial peptides). A breakdown in these host defenses, especially when the lungs are exposed to highly virulent organisms or an overwhelming inoculum, can result in an infection of the respiratory tract. Infections of the lung typically occur by aspiration of upper airway resident flora, inhalation of aerosolized material, and metastatic seeding of the lung by infectious agents systemically.

Seasonal patterns of adenovirus most commonly occur in the late winter, spring, and early summer. Adenovirus can cause nonrespiratory tract infections such as gastroenteritis, conjunctivitis, cystitis, and rash. The incubation period of adenovirus is 4 to 5 days. The most common symptoms associated with adenovirus infection are cough, fever, sore throat, and rhinorrhea. These symptoms typically last 3 to 5 days. The classification system of adenovirus serotypes has clinical significance, as there is some association of the serotype, age, and the clinical spectrum of disease. In infants, serotype 7 causes fulminant bronchiolitis and pneumonia. In children, adenovirus serotypes 1, 2, and 4 to 6 are associated with upper respiratory disease.

Otitis media, nausea, and vomiting are commonly reported among children with influenza illness. Influenza illness and symptoms typically resolve over several days for most individuals. Cough and malaise may persist for 2 weeks or more. Primary influenza viral pneumonia and secondary bacterial infection are possible pulmonary complications of influenza infection.

Secondary bacterial infection likely occurs from direct physical damage to bronchial epithelium and impairment of normal ciliary activity in physical clearance of bacteria from the lung.

There are variable degrees of protection within subtypes but not protection across subtypes. The production of interferon and the generation of cytotoxic lymphocytes best correlate with the recovery from acute influenza. Immunity to reinfection and reduction of the severity of disease with influenza viruses is mediated by antibodies in the serum and the respiratory tract secretions. A systemic antibody response of IgM, IgG, and IgA to influenza virus results in the development of antibody to the glycoproteins HA, NA, and matrix and nucleoproteins (42) . Serum IgG neutralizing antibody is the primary mediator of resistance to influenza virus infection. However, antibody to one influenza virus type confers limited or no protection against another influenza virus type. Peak antibody responses are found at 4 to 7 weeks after infection. Antineuraminidase antibody parallels that of hemagglutinin-inhibiting antibodies (HAI) (43) and is the primary method of detecting antigenic relatedness among hemagglutinins of influenza virus. Some studies suggest that a serum HAI titer of \u22651 : 40 or a serum neutralizing titer of \u22651 : 8 is associated with protection against infection. Antibody to NA can be measured by NA inhibition or ELISA. Anti-NA antibody can provide protection against influenza infection by reducing efficient release of virus from infected cells and decreased severity of illness (44, 45) . Antibodies to internal proteins (matrix and nucleoproteins) are cross-reactive but not protective against infection. Immunoglobulins G and A are found in nasal secretions. The IgG to HA in the nasal secretions is the IgG 1 subtype, which is the same subtype found in the serum, suggesting that nasal IgG 1 originates from diffusion from the serum (46) .

From an immunology point of view, surfactant, which has several components, serves to increase the microbicidal capacity of macrophages, affect free-radical production and lymphocyte activity, and bind various microorganisms including viruses (113) .
