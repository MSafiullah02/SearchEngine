For each of these factors, a 5-point scale was created, with a higher value assigned for poorer perioperative patient outcome, increased risk of COVID-19 transmission to the healthcare team, and/or increased hospital resource use during the pandemic. Value anchors were assigned to the 1-to-5 scale based on both objective measures and perceived clinical probabilities. Summation of the points assigned to these individual factors generates a cumulative MeNTS score. As a retrospective proof of concept assessment, the cumulative MeNTS scores of a sampling of MeNTS procedures performed and deferred from the week of March 20, 2020 to March 26, 2020 were calculated by faculty members from our departmental quality committee.",

Given the need to maintain OR capacity for trauma, emergency, and highly urgent cases, an upper threshold MeNTS score can be designated by surgical and perioperative leadership based on the immediately anticipated conditions and resources at each institution. Performing a MeNTS procedure whose score exceeds this upper threshold at that particular point in time is unlikely to be justifiable given the associated risks, though sound clinical judgment always takes precedent. In a similar but complementary manner, a lower threshold MeNTS score can be assigned, below which it would be reasonable to proceed with MeNTS procedures while preserving OR capacity for trauma, emergency, and highly urgent cases. Once again, both thresholds can be dynamically adjusted to respond to the immediate and anticipated availability of resources and local conditions. This general concept is illustrated in Figure 1\n.",

MeNTS scores for a smaller sample of procedures that remained cancelled were also calculated. The cases represented a broad range of surgical specialties including general surgery, surgical oncology, otorhinolaryngology, cardiothoracic surgery, neurosurgery, vascular surgery, urology, and plastic surgery and were performed by quality committee members representing each of those specialties in order to provide appropriate clinical context. As seen in Figure 2\n, the MeNTS cases that were performed generally had relatively low MeNTS scores, while the cancelled procedures had somewhat higher scores, suggestive of relative concordance with the ad hoc decisions made before creation of the MeNTS scoring system. Of note, although interobserver reliability of the scoring process was not assessed, the proof of concept scoring that did take place was performed by faculty who did not directly participate in the care of those patients.",

            "text": "We have described a scoring system that systematically integrates factors that are novel to the COVID-19 pandemic (resource limitations, COVID-19 transmission risk) to facilitate decision-making and triage for MeNTS procedures. This scoring system appropriately weighs individual patient risks with the ethical necessity of optimizing public health concerns. The transparency offered by this process to surgeons, perioperative teams, trainees, and even to patients, can inform the complex and difficult discussions involving the decision to proceed or postpone procedures, as well as specific COVID-19-related perioperative risks. Assigning values to each factor serves as a \u201cforcing function\u201d that compels the surgeon to contemplate additional factors that have not generally required consideration in a systematic manner, and prevents omission of their consideration in a manner similar to that in which a properly conducted perioperative checklist facilitates high reliability care in the OR environment. Using a 5-point scale allows for a reasonable degree of clinical nuance for each factor as compared to binary options. Because much of the scoring is derived by assessment of disease acuity, time sensitivity, and the effectiveness and availability of nonoperative therapies (as opposed to prioritizing specific diseases treated by surgery such as cancer, cholelithiasis, or peripheral vascular disease), this system can be applied both within and across surgical specialties. The ability to adjust the upper and lower MeNTS score thresholds based on day-to-day personnel and resource availability and based on the status of COVID-19 in the state, region, and hospital offers dynamic flexibility while simultaneously preserving OR capacity for emergency and urgent cases. Finally, in addition to substantively incorporating the potential for the harm of viral exposure and infection to the healthcare team, the MeNTS scoring and triage process can partially offload the emotional and ethical burden associated with having to make difficult decisions weighing patient needs in the midst of scarcity of resources and the plausible risk of viral transmission to both the surgeon and to other members of the healthcare team. Having the knowledge that these factors were carefully considered in the decision to proceed or defer a MeNTS procedure may mitigate the moral injury associated with a feeling of being less capable of advocating for the care and resources that the healthcare team would normally be able to provide to each individual patient before the pandemic.",

            "text": "The MeNTS scoring system has several limitations. In this initial iteration, each of the 21 factors has been given an equal weight in the cumulative MeNTS score. Given the current paucity of COVID-19 perioperative outcomes data, disproportionate weighting of factors is inevitable. Because there are insufficient data on which to systematically identify factors, it is likely that important factors have been inadvertently omitted. Additionally, within each individual factor score, the point values assigned to each anchor are not quantitatively proportionate. Furthermore, there can be a false sense of objectivity associated with the generation of a single numerical value given that there is significant subjectivity in assigning values to several of the identified factors. Moreover, our approach does not take into consideration the COVID status of the patient. Instead, we currently consider patients whose COVID infection status is not known as being potentially positive, even when asymptomatic, in an abundance of caution given preliminary reports of unexpectedly severe pulmonary complications in asymptomatic patients subsequently found to have COVID-19. This cautious approach is reflected in the inclusion of influenza-like illness symptoms and known exposure to COVID-19 individuals in the 14 days preceding surgery, each as scoring factors. In the future, as preoperative testing for markers of COVID-19 recovery and immunity (IgG) becomes more widely available, COVID-19 immune patients may require a substantially modified MeNTS scoring process in which many of the factors are no longer applicable with regard to risk of provider or patient infection. Finally, although the dynamic adjustment of MeNTS score thresholds may facilitate day-to-day completion of MeNTS procedures, this process does not anticipate the availability of resources for the management of complications, readmissions, or other deviation from a routine postoperative course.",

This approach also acknowledges those cases in which excessive delay of care can negatively affect the likelihood of successful treatment of the disease or unnecessarily add increased technical and safety risks to the surgical procedure. Furthermore, by routinely \u201cforcing\u201d the surgeon to consider factors that may use scarce resources and/or subject their teams to increased risk of viral infection, surgeons must take into account the public health ethics concern of protecting resources. In our institution, we are now asking that surgeons calculate and submit the cumulative MeNTS score as part of their request to schedule MeNTS cases, and tracking those scores prospectively. Over time, surgeons will be able to incorporate these concepts into their decision-making in a less proscribed manner. The scoring system can also be used to facilitate organization and prioritization of the large backlog of MeNTS cases that will await completion when the pandemic begins to subside. Though it may seem premature to discuss the post-pandemic future while its peak is projected to be several weeks away at the time of this writing, if nothing else, the COVID-19 pandemic has taught us the importance of planning for future conditions.",
