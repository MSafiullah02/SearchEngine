In the Netherlands until 2007, the age-threshold for such vaccination was 65 years for non-high-risk groups. In 2008, this threshold was lowered to include all persons aged 60 years and older [1]. In addition in the Netherlands, all high-risk groups are vaccinated, including individuals suffering from chronic conditions, respiratory diseases, cardiac diseases, diabetes mellitus, renal failure, those being immunocompromised and individuals aged less than 18 years of age on chronic salicylates use [1]. Vaccination rates among these high-risk groups under 65 years of age ranged from 66% to 83% in the Netherlands in 2005 [2]. Persons of 65 years and older with a medical indication showed higher vaccination coverages compared to those of the same age without such an indication, at 90% and 76% in 2005, respectively [2]. Influenza may cause acute bronchitis and pneumonia in high-risk groups and elderly and may lead to exacerbations of underlying chronic medical conditions such as cardiovascular diseases, asthma and diabetes, potentially leading to hospitalisations and death. Prevention of influenza infection by vaccination is of high importance for these groups with an increased risk for complications from influenza infection [3], [4], [5].",

In the Netherlands, universal influenza vaccination of such children is in debate, however yet the vaccine efficacy and effectiveness for this specific age group is not considered to be sufficiently demonstrated [7], [8], [9]. Therefore, the Dutch Health Council concluded in 2007, not yet to start with influenza vaccination of these groups [1]. Comparable conclusions were made for healthy children aged 2 years and older. Although vaccination was shown to be effective for these children, influenza was considered not to cause serious morbidity or mortality in the Netherlands in those groups [1].",

For burden of disease often the label Influenza Like Illnesses (ILI) is considered to primarily comprise disease due to influenza infections, however known to potentially comprise various other agents inclusive RSV, with the identification of the relative contributions of both viruses being strongly hampered [18], [19], [20], [21]. In particular, even further viral agents, such as adeno-, parainfluenza-, and corona-viruses may contribute to the burden of ILI [21], [22]. For exactly analysing the burdens of disease of influenza and RSV separately, which is the goal of our current paper, ILI is therefore an inappropriate concept. Therefore, we chose to analyse isolates exactly related to the respective causal agents.",

Drug-use for specific complications of influenza and RSV could certainly temporarily be elevated. In particular, prescriptions for antibiotics, otologicals and cardiovascular medication may be elevated, dispensed for otitis media, cardiac complications, respiratory illness and other pulmonary complications.

The first method defined a week with elevated activity as one with a moving average of more than two times the gross overall average weekly number from week 40 in 1998 onwards to week 39 of 2006 (week 1 obviously being the 1st week in January; week 40 generally being considered as the start of the influenza season). Following Jansen et al., the second method defined the weeks with elevated activity as those weeks from any period of at least 2 consecutive weeks, with each individual week accounting for over 5% of the season\u2019s total number of influenza- or RSV-positive specimens [18]. From both methods, it appeared that periods consisting of a number of subsequent weeks resulted, rather than individual weeks or short periods of, for example, 2 weeks only. Such periods would be expected \u2013 and were indeed found \u2013 to be between week 40 and week 20 in the next year (the non-summer season) [18], [25].",

For analytical purposes, the prescriptions were divided over 5-year age categories.

For example, dornase alfa, a drug prescribed for cystic fibrosis, was included to define persons with respiratory diseases. Other medications for cystic fibrosis, such as acetylcysteine, are also prescribed for cough and were therefore not included. Table 1\nlists these drugs specifically. For heart medication, diuretic sulfonamides were included. Other diuretics used for lowering blood pressure were excluded, as high-blood pressure is not a high-risk identified condition. Furthermore, only calcium antagonists with ATC-code C08D were included as only these are assumed to have cardiac effects. Beta blockers and RAAS system agents were excluded as these are not exclusively prescribed for cardiac diseases, but also, for example, for high-blood pressure only. For renal diseases, medication for the treatment of hyperkalemia and hyperphosphatemia, and antianemic preparations and sulfonamides were included as these are often prescribed for dialysis or renal insufficiency. To identify immunocompromised patients, immunosuppressives were included, which can be prescribed, for example, for patients after organ transplantation.

For analysing cardiovascular medications, only first prescriptions were considered as our current interest was to investigate whether the viral infections were related to new cardiovascular disease and/or exacerbations of existing \u2013 yet untreated \u2013 background cardiovascular conditions, rather than identify chronic medications for cardiovascular diseases (note that chronic cardiovascular medication use was used as a criterion for assigning persons to the high-risk group).

This is certainly in line with our findings on excess antibiotic and otological prescriptions among the youngest age groups and cardiovascular medication surpluses among the older age groups. In contrast to other studies which showed higher morbidity and mortality among the oldest age groups compared with non-elderly adults, our study shows that the elevation in the prescriptions of antibiotics in the oldest age groups (65 years of age and older) is not higher than in the two younger age groups (55\u201359 and 60\u201364). Yet, if compared with other adult age groups, a small increase could be seen. For influenza, this slightly deviating finding compared to non-Dutch settings, might be explained by the high vaccination coverage among elderly in the Netherlands.",

In line with their findings, we showed a significant surplus in first cardiovascular medication prescriptions during influenza-active periods, but not during RSV-active periods for those aged 45 years and over. Elevated hospitalisation and prescription rates during influenza periods in persons aged around 50 years and beyond suggests that influenza may cause cardiovascular diseases or that it may aggravate existing non-diagnosed cardiovascular diseases in older adults. Another hypothesis explaining this increase might be that increased cardiovascular problems during influenza periods are related to the increased use of analgesics during those periods to alleviate influenza symptoms [45]. Further research is definitely needed into this topic.",
