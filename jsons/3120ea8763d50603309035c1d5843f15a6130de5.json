Regarding tumorigenesis, it exhibits a dual role by demonstrating anti-tumor effects (through inhibiting the proliferation and inducing apoptosis) and pro-oncogenic activities (via inducing EMT and tumor metastasis) during early and late stages of oncogenesis, respectively. 6, 8 This pathway mediates its functions through TGF-\u03b2 cytokines whose binding to type II and type I serine-threonine kinase receptors (known as TGFbRI and TGFbRII, respectively) results in the activation of 2 different downstream pathways; SMAD-dependent and SMAD-independent pathways. 9 Indeed, the effects of TGF-\u03b2 are often controlled by 3 TGF\u03b2 ligands, TGF-\u03b21, TGF-\u03b22, and TGF-\u03b23, secreted as latent protein complexes, required to be activated by proteolytic cleavage before binding to receptors. 9 Activated TGF-\u03b2 interacts with and activates TGFbRII, leading to the phosphorylation of TGFbRI, whose activation results in signal transduction via recruiting and phosphorylating receptor-regulated SMADs (R-SMAD), SMAD2 and SMAD3, which subsequently interact with Co-SMADs (eg, SMAD4) to form the activated SMADs complex, that thereafter, translocate into the nucleus, wherein it exerts its regulatory effects on the expression of target genes, by recruiting other co-activator or co-repressor factors for transcription (eg, p300, CBP) ( Figure 1 ). 10, 11 Furthermore, TGFbRIII is another TGF-\u03b2 receptor, playing a coreceptor role for TGFbRII. 12 SMAD-dependent cascade, as the major TGF-\u03b2 signaling mediator, conveys signals from TGFbRI to the nucleus in a linear pathway, a process blocked by inhibitory SMADs (I-SMADs); for instance, SMAD7 represses this pathway either via interacting with activated TGFbRI, and hence, preventing R-SMAD activation or through recruiting SMURF2, a ubiquitin-ligase, which promotes SMAD2 and TGFbRI decrease and downmodulates SMAD3 function. 10, 13, 14 Perturbations of this cascade can lead to tumorigenesis and tumor promotion via either direct or indirect effects on key cellular process. 15 For example, SMAD4 and TGFbRII were shown to be often disrupted by mechanisms such as allelic loss of heterozygosity (LOH) and mutation in multiple carcinomas. 16 Similarly, disturbed SMAD4 has also been observed in a number of malignancies, representing a tumor suppressor role for this pathway. 17 In addition to the SMADs cascade, which plays the central role, 10 TGF-\u03b2 can also interact with other signaling cascades, those mediated independently of the SMAD factors, such as p38 MAP kinases, c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), Ras-ERK, PI3K-Akt, and small GTPases (eg, RhoA), in a cell type-specific manner.

Relevant in this regard, other investigations have shown an upregulated level of TGF-\u03b2 either directly by HCV factors, in particular core protein, or via NF-\u03baB and oxidative/ER stress activation. [25] [26] [27] [28] [29] Taniguchi indicated TGF-\u03b2 upmodulation at the transcriptional levels by HCV core protein. 28 Furthermore, HCV core protein also increases active TGF-\u03b2 levels by thrombospondin (THBS), an anti-angiogenic factor whose function is mediated in part through activating the latent form of TGF-\u03b2, and thus SMAD2/3 phosphorylation, indicating TGF-\u03b2 signaling activation. 29 Similarly, HCV increases ROS production, which in turn activates the p38 MAPK, JNK, and ERK pathways, leading to NF\u03baB activation that induces TGF-\u03b2 production. 30 Conversely, HCV NS5A protein was able to block a pivotal transcriptional activator for TGF-\u03b2 gene expression, known as AP-1, through interrupting the Ras-ERK pathway. 24 In addition to overexpression or activation of TGF-\u03b2 cytokine, HCV also interferes with downstream TGF-\u03b2 signaling components and mediators.

It is thought the upregulated TGF-\u03b2 pathway enhances the invasive and metastatic potential of HCC cells, by suppressing E-cadherin expression and promoting regulatory T cells (Treg) induction. 7, 21, 44 In this respect, Liu suggested a new mechanism underlying the pathogenesis of HBV-caused HCC; HBx downmodulates protein phosphatase magnesium-dependent 1A (PPM1a) levels, resulting in overactivation of the TGF-\u03b2 signaling pathway. 7 In fact, HBx was shown to promote the degradation of PPM1a, a p-Smad2/3 phosphatase required for terminating TGF-\u03b2 signaling, through elevating its ubiquitination. Furthermore, Yoo showed HBx upregulates TGF-\u03b2 expression by acting through the Egr transcription factors binding site. 45 A study by Lee also demonstrated that HBx directly interacts with SMAD4 leading to the SMAD complex stabilization and enhanced TGF-\u03b2 signaling. 46 In this way, HBV may affect cancer invasion in HCC, by upmodulating the TGF-\u03b2 pathway. Moreover, HBx has also been shown to prevent TGF-\u03b2 mediated-apoptosis via upregulating the PI3-kinase signaling pathway activity. 47 In addition to HBx, HBV transcripts have also been implicated in the pathogenesis of HCC. 48 A recent study demonstrated HBV mRNAs could bind to and absorb microRNA 15a/16 to inhibit apoptosis. 49 The importance of this interaction was subsequently highlighted, when the authors interestingly found that SMAD7 acts as a target of miR-15a. 48 Thus, HBV can increase the level of SMAD7 and then block TGF-\u03b2 signaling and corresponding responses (eg, apoptosis) by downmodulating miR-15a, an attractive molecular target for therapeutic development.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 129, "end": 131, "text": "39", "ref_id": "BIBREF38"}, {"start": 264, "end": 266, "text": "42", "ref_id": "BIBREF41"}, {"start": 587, "end": 589, "text": "7,", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}, {"start": 590, "end": 593, "text": "21,", "ref_id": "BIBREF20"}, {"start": 594, "end": 596, "text": "44", "ref_id": "BIBREF43"}, {"start": 828, "end": 829, "text": "7", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}, {"start": 1113, "end": 1115, "text": "45", "ref_id": "BIBREF44"}, {"start": 1260, "end": 1262, "text": "46", "ref_id": "BIBREF45"}, {"start": 1480, "end": 1482, "text": "47", "ref_id": "BIBREF46"}, {"start": 1573, "end": 1575, "text": "48", "ref_id": "BIBREF47"}, {"start": 1677, "end": 1679, "text": "49", "ref_id": "BIBREF48"}, {"start": 1822, "end": 1824, "text": "48", "ref_id": "BIBREF47"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "| Hepatitis B virus"}, {"text": "HPVs are DNA viruses associated with the development of cervical, anal, and head and neck cancers.

In other words, it seems the LMP-1-mediated inhibitory effect on SMAD-dependent transcription results from inhibition of the transcriptional cofactors involved in SMAD transcriptional function, but not owing to suppression of TGF-\u03b2-induced SMAD signaling through mechanisms such as affecting the formation of SMAD heteromers or their DNA binding activities; similarly, LMP-1 suppresses ATF3, a transcriptional repressor induced by SMAD signaling, whose association with SMADs blocks the expression of a growth promoting gene, known as Id1. However, in the absence of this factor, SMAD3 binds to Id1 promoter directly, resulting in Id1 upmodulation. 67 In this way, it can be seen how the well-documented \"double-edged sword\" nature of TGF-\u03b2 signaling is manipulated by EBV. While, LMP-1 increases the expression of TGF-\u03b2 and SMAD2 phosphorylation but also blocks SMAD-dependent transcription and TGF\u03b2-mediated cytostasis, and exerts its effects by using the non-SMAD arm of TGF-\u03b2 signaling; it enhances the secretion of fibronectin through the JNK/SAPK pathway, 68 which can contribute to tumor invasiveness. EBV also affects the pathway via EBNA-1 protein, so that, it decreases SMAD2 levels by enhanced protein turnover. 69, 70 Accordingly, EBNA-1 represses TGF-\u03b2-induced transcription of \u03b2ig-h3 (a TGF-\u03b2-target gene implicated in cell growth, differentiation, and apoptosis), and PAI-1 (a classical target of TGF-\u03b2) in carcinoma cells, 70 as well as, PTPRK (a functional tumor suppressor in Hodgkin lymphoma cells) leading to the growth and survival of these cancer cells. 69 EBV-encoded BARF1 is another EBV factor by which FIGURE 4 A schematic illustration of the major HPV proteins and corresponding targets, by which HPV modulates the TGF-\u03b2 signaling pathway the virus modulates the TGF-\u03b2 pathway enhancing cell proliferation in gastric cancer; in an NF\u03baB-dependent manner, BARF1 upmodulate miR-146a-5p levels that directly targets SMAD4 and reduces its levels in gastric cancer cells. 71 LMP-1 also induces miR-146a expression that may similarly suppress SMAD4 protein. 72 In summary, reports suggest these EBV proteins as promising target for therapeutic interventions, so that a BARF1-specific mAb was proposed as a novel immunotherapeutic tool toward the management of EBV-associated malignancies. 73 (Figure 6 ). 77 TGF-\u03b2 signaling has been reported to be suppressed by LANA in PEL via the association of this KSHV-encoded protein with the promoter region of TGFbRII and subsequently histone methylation and deacetylation and then downregulation of this receptor, contributing to resistance to the antiproliferative effects of TGF-\u03b2. 77 Choi was able to show that vFLIP and vCyclin upregulate the expression of the oncogenic miR- cluster that in turn interact with the TGF-\u03b2 pathway via downmodulating SMAD2 protein. 75 KSHV not only modifies the expression of cellular miRNAs, but also encodes for viral miRNAs to interact with TGF-\u03b2 signaling.

Furthermore, suppression of this viral miRNA eliminates this suppression in B cells infected by KSHV. 76 Similarly, KSHV miR-K10 variants repress the pathway through targeting TGFbRII, so that its expression is adequate to block TGF-\u03b2-mediated cell apoptosis in KSHV-infected PEL cells. 74 THBS1 has been suggested as another KSHV-encoded miRNAs target; miR-K12 targets this factors resulting in repression of TGF-\u03b2 signaling. 78 In addition to the latent proteins, 2 KSHV lytic products also interfere with TGF-\u03b2 signaling; viral interferon regulatory factor 1 (vIRF-1) was demonstrated to perturb TGF-\u03b2-induced transcription and growth arrest through direct interaction with both SMAD3 and SMAD4, leading to interrupting the formation of SMAD3-SMAD4 complex and their DNA binding activity. 79 Furthermore, by binding to the transcriptional coactivator CBP and blocking its recruitment into transcription initiation complexes on TGF-\u03b2-responsive elements, the KSHV lytic protein, K-bZIP, also inhibits TGF-\u03b2 signaling. 80 ", "cite_spans": [{"start": 121, "end": 123, "text": "64", "ref_id": "BIBREF63"}, {"start": 242, "end": 244, "text": "65", "ref_id": "BIBREF64"}, {"start": 395, "end": 397, "text": "66", "ref_id": "BIBREF65"}, {"start": 1281, "end": 1283, "text": "67", "ref_id": "BIBREF66"}, {"start": 1694, "end": 1696, "text": "68", "ref_id": "BIBREF67"}, {"start": 1855, "end": 1858, "text": "69,", "ref_id": "BIBREF68"}, {"start": 1859, "end": 1861, "text": "70", "ref_id": "BIBREF69"}, {"start": 2071, "end": 2073, "text": "70", "ref_id": "BIBREF69"}, {"start": 2208, "end": 2210, "text": "69", "ref_id": "BIBREF68"}, {"start": 2260, "end": 2268, "text": "FIGURE 4", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2625, "end": 2627, "text": "71", "ref_id": "BIBREF70"}, {"start": 2710, "end": 2712, "text": "72", "ref_id": "BIBREF71"}, {"start": 2941, "end": 2943, "text": "73", "ref_id": "BIBREF72"}, {"start": 2957, "end": 2959, "text": "77", "ref_id": "BIBREF76"}, {"start": 3278, "end": 3280, "text": "77", "ref_id": "BIBREF76"}, {"start": 3461, "end": 3463, "text": "75", "ref_id": "BIBREF74"}, {"start": 3812, "end": 3814, "text": "76", "ref_id": "BIBREF75"}, {"start": 4137, "end": 4139, "text": "78", "ref_id": "BIBREF77"}, {"start": 4502, "end": 4504, "text": "79", "ref_id": "BIBREF78"}, {"start": 4730, "end": 4732, "text": "80", "ref_id": "BIBREF79"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 2944, "end": 2953, "text": "(Figure 6", "ref_id": null}], "section": "| Epstein-Barr virus"}, {"text": "HTLV-1, the causative agent of adult T-cell leukemia (ATL), has also been involved in TGF-\u03b2 signaling interruption (Figure 7) .

240 million people, globally, of which approximately 10% have an increased risk of developing cirrhosis and HCC. 4,41 Similar to HCV, HBV also interacts with the TGF-\u03b2 pathway, a phenomenon mainly mediated by HBV X protein (HBx), which may exert diverse effects on the pathogenesis of the HBV-mediated liver pathologies 7,21,42,43 (Figure 3). Evidence by Murata further supported the hypothesis that the TGF-\u03b2 pathway is directly involved in liver tumorigenesis, where HBx was shown to switch the target of hepatocytic TGF-\u03b2 signaling from the TGFbRI/ pSmad3C/p21 anti-tumor pathway to the JNK/pSmad3L/c-Myc tumor supportive pathway in the early stages of liver carcinogenesis.43", "latex": null, "type": "figure"}, "FIGREF1": {"text": "KSHV is a Herpesvirus implicated in the onset of Kaposi's sarcoma, multicentric Castleman's disease, and primary effusion lymphoma (PEL).74 KSHV infection comprises 2 latent and lytic phases, which its transforming properties mainly root from the expression of latent genes such as kaposin, viral micro RNAs, viral Fas-associated death domain IL-1\u03b2-converting enzyme inhibitory protein (vFLIP), viral cyclin (vCyc), and latency-associated nuclear antigen (LANA), through enhancing the survival and proliferation of the virus-infected cancer cells. 75 Dysregulation of TGF-\u03b2 signaling importantly contributes to cell survival and proliferation in KSHV infection, 76 and in this way, investigations have reported an interfering role of KSHV-encoded products with this pathway", "latex": null, "type": "figure"}, "FIGREF2": {"text": "this cellular immune suppressive cytokine in several tumor cell types (eg, glioblastoma, leukemia, and osteosarcoma cells), affecting host immune responses toward these tumor cells. 91 CMV DNA and proteins were shown to be correlated with increased TGF-\u03b2 and arterial intimal thickening in tubuli and arterial endothelium in CMV infected human kidney allografts compared with uninfected allografts. 92 Similarly, enhanced urinary excretion of TGF-\u03b2 has also been found in urine samples of CMV-positive renal transplant patients, which was associated with exacerbated fibrosis in biopsies taken from patients. 93 This association of CMV infection with enhanced TGF-\u03b2 expression reinforces the possibility that CMV may promote renal allograft rejection through CMV infection-induced TGF-\u03b2 leading to fibrosis inside the allograft; CMV-infected human renal tubularepithelial cells that were exposed to TGF-\u03b2 in vitro, developed EMT, after which the cells also activated extracellular latent form of TGF-\u03b2.", "latex": null, "type": "figure"}, "FIGREF3": {"text": "also may affect TGF-\u03b2 signaling.

Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-coronavirus (CoV), a RNA virus known to cause outbreak of SARS disease, targets TGF-\u03b2 signaling 100-103 ; SARS-CoV papain-like protease (Plpro) stimulates the TGF-\u03b2 mRNA and protein production and pro-fibrotic genes expression by the p38 MAPK and ERK1/2mediated pathways in human promonocytes (Figure 8). 102 In human lung epithelial cells and mouse models, SARS-CoV Plpro also upregulated the level of Egr-1 through the ROS-induced p38 MAPK and STAT3 activation, leading to the increase in TGF-\u03b2 production by direct Egr-1 interacting with the Egr-1 binding site located in the TGF-\u03b2 promoter region. 100 SARS-CoV PLpro similarly upmodulated p38 MAPK/ STAT3-mediated expression of Type I collagen in vitro and in vivo, mediated by non-SMAD TGF-\u03b2 signaling including STAT6 activation, correlated with upregulated pulmonary pro-fibrotic responses. 101 Furthermore, SARS-CoV nucleocapsid (N) protein inhibited the formation of SMAD3/4 complex, resulting in blocked TGF-\u03b2-induced apoptosis in SARS-CoV-infected host cells. Meanwhile, N protein also interacted with SMAD3 and increased SMAD3-p300 complex formation, contributing to promoted plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) levels, and hence, tissue fibrosis, 103 suggesting novel therapeutic targets for SARS treatment.", "latex": null, "type": "figure"}, "FIGREF4": {"text": "modulation of either TGF-\u03b2 protein expression or activation, (2) modulation of the TGF-\u03b2 receptors or SMADs factors (by interfering with their levels and functions), (3) modulation of none-SMAD cascades, and (4) indirect interaction by the modulation of transcriptional co-activator/repressor and regulators of the pathway.
