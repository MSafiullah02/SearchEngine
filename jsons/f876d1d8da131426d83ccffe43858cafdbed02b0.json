However, these outbreaks are generally only dealt with seriously when the viruses concerned have been confirmed and classified as zoonotic. Arenavirus haemorrhagic fever viruses can cause epidemics in some areas of the world. To assess the potential of similar viruses to become zoonotic in the future, bioinformatics of relatively conserved virus proteins, such as the L polymerase of arenaviruses, can be used to identify homology with viruses that might give future outbreaks. In this paper, new and archival metazoan transcriptome sequence data was used as a resource to identify similar sequences to known arenavirus sequences for the purpose of risk prediction. In essence, bioinformatics was utilized to provide a better understanding of the potential evolution and natural history of 2 uncharacterized virus sequences in the GenBank database. Several matches were identified which, along with a reasoned approach to their phyla, was used to provide a likelihood score of their zoonotic potential.",

The L polymerase contains an endonuclease domain that plays a significant role in mRNA cap-snatching during viral transcription (Morin et al., 2010) . As L polymerase contains several essential catalytic domains it represents a protein which would be expected to be conserved, at least in part, by viruses using a similar mode of replication. Because the L polymerase is highly conserved it provides a useful source of amino acid sequences, for example from the catalytic site and from the endonuclease domain, for homology based searches of the unannotated databases to assess how widespread these conserved features are, and if they are found in virus sequences that may be of pandemic concern.",

The open reading frames (ORFs) sequence of the TSA database (Table 1) Figure 5 shows some shared regions of protein homology following multiple sequence alignments. In particular, two regions of L polymerase appeared to represent the most homologous stretches among the sequences aligned, residues ~1210 to ~1450 and residues ~1560 to ~1880. Interestingly the region 1050 -1500 has been defined as the core RdRp in the Lassa L structure (Brunotte et al., 2011) while the later sequence also falls into a conserved region defined as domain IV based on arenavirus sequence analysis (Vieth et al., 2004) . That these regions of conservation appear in such diverse targets suggests that it should be possible for design primers that could be used to amplify products from diverse sources as well as from current arenaviruses species by RT-PCR. In fact, RT-PCR was used for identify some species of mammarenavirus (Vieth et al., 2007) and reptarenavirus (Aqrawi et al., 2015) . This could provide a diagnostic for the presence of the agents from which the TSA sequences were derived and also find other, related, virus sequences (Lozano et al., 1997; Vieth et al., 2005) .",

However, protein sequence homologies found Channa punctate (fish), Rhopilema esculentum (jellyfish) and Catostomus commersonii (fish), could be plausible as components of viruses that at least had the opportunity to cause infection following human contact (by bite, sting and consumption respectively).

To clarify, the arenaviruses species locate in the middle of the tree between Rhizopus oryzae and Channa punctate, Asymmetron lucayanum and Rhopilema esculentum. The bootstrap shows some differences in values between the viruses including arenaviruses and the species found in the TSA, while the values are the same between the other viruses. For instance, the bootstrap values between the arenavirus related TSA sequences from Channa punctate and Catostomus commersonii are the same and each around 0.79, which could indicate an evolutionary relationship between them. Discussion The results of this study shown that when the viral RNA dependent RNA polymerase (L protein) of Tacaribe virus (TCRV), lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV), Golden Gate virus (GGV) and California Academy of Science virus (CASV) were utilized for searching the translated nucleotides that are archived in GenBank in the Transcriptome Shotgun Assembly (TSA) database by tBLASTn, some distant homologues were found. The TSA database findings indicated sequences in six living species including Channa punctate, Catostomus commersonii, Asymmetron lucayanum, Rhizopus oryzae, Rhopilema esculentum and Talitrus saltator that have gene homology with the L polymerase of four species of arenavirus used for this study. When the translated proteins of these open reading frames (ORFs) from the TSA data were converted to amino acid sequences the translated proteins of the TSA database were found to have homology with the La Crosse Bunyavirus polymerase (5amr-A), Influenza C virus RNA-dependent RNA Polymerase (5d98-B) and with the L polymerase of vesicular stomatitis virus (5a22-A). Therefore, It was found that the L polymerase of some species of arenaviruses had significant TSA alignment with other species which indicates conserved genes among even distant arenaviruses. Interestingly, phylogenetic tree alignment of all the protein sequences showed that the four arenavirus sequences located between Rhopilema esculentum at the distal end and Talitrus saltator at the bottom of the groups of the tree. The tree also shows that the translated protein of Rhizopus oryzae located between L polymerase of arenaviruses and the translated proteins of Rhopilema esculentum and Asymmetron lucayanum.",
