Second, although we analyzed imaging risk factors, we did not analyze the effects of other previously reported clinical characteristics associated with death or other fatal endpoints. Third, we assessed quantitative CT characteristics; however, we did not extract high-throughput imaging features, including histogram and texture. Moreover, the risk factors might have been affected by unadjusted confounders or unmeasured factors. Therefore, future studies should consider clinical factors, as well as CT features and deep radiological features.",

We found that older age and larger consolidation in upper lungs on admission were associated with higher odds of adverse composite endpoints, including admission to ICU, acute respiratory failure, or shock during hospitalization. The finding provided us a simpler way to identify high risk patients on CT that the elder with large consolidation in upper lungs should be paid more attention during the treatment of COVID-19. Initial CT evaluation and identification of these risk factors could be helpful toward the monitoring of COVID-19.",
