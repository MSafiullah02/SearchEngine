In the conventional setting, chronic inflammatory diseases are assessed by clinical activity indices that measure clinical symptoms or by radiologic or endoscopic indices that measure tissue inflammation. Disease subtypes are often defined on the basis of medical history, physical findings, imaging parameters, serum markers, as well as endoscopic and histopathological characteristics of the disease. Noninvasive or minimally invasive diagnostic procedures present less burden and risk to patients than, for example, invasive biopsy sampling. They may thus support clinical decision-making by providing information on disease status and prognosis. The requirements of these applications cannot always be met by a single biomarker class.",

Fecal biomarkers are valuable in their specificity to the gastrointestinal tract. They include a heterogeneous group of substances that either leak from or are generated by the inflamed intestinal mucosa [1] . In the setting of mucosal inflammation in patients with IBD, inflammatory proteins (protein cytokines and markers C of neutrophil activation), leukocyte products, and leukocytes themselves leak from a permeable mucosa. Fecal microbiota appear to be attractive biomarkers in IBD, since they provide a noninvasive way to directly monitor changes in the intestinal environment associated with mucosal inflammation. However, they do not necessarily play a causative role in disease. The ability of the organism to compete in the altered intestinal environment is associated with the appearance or disappearance of a microbial group in disease [5] . ",

            "text": "C-reactive protein (CRP), an acute-phase protein, is produced as an acute-phase reactant predominantly in the liver, in response to a variety of acute and chronic inflammatory conditions, and is an important component of the innate immune system [1, 4, 6] . CRP is produced mainly by hepatocytes in response to stimulation by interleukin (IL)-6, and to a lesser extent in response to TNF-a and IL-1b, which are produced at the site of inflammation [1, 4] . CRP is an easy and reliably measured biomarker across diagnostic laboratories and has a short plasma half-life of 19 h [6] . CRP production is rapidly upregulated, in the presence of an acute-phase stimulus [4] . Within 24-48 h the increase may be 500 to 1000-fold higher than under basal circumstances. Inversely, to its increase, the reduction of CRP may be similarly rapid, as the acute-phase response subsides, with a fall from peak with a half-time of 48 h [1] . Once the stimulus disappears, CRP concentrations quickly decrease due to CRP's short half-life. Hence, this makes CRP a valuable marker to detect the activity of IBD [4] . CRP is an objective marker of inflammation correlating well with disease activity in CD. Increased CRP levels are associated with better response rates, whereas normal CRP levels predict high placebo response rates in clinical trials [2] . The same increasing trend can be observed in UC, although CRP levels are generally lower than in CD [4] . Several studies have identified increased levels of CRP in nearly 100% of patients with CD and approximately 50% of those with UC [7] .",

Various studies have been conducted, regarding CRP levels and their correlation to different clinical courses [4] . A retrospective analysis of Mayo Clinic data has associated moderate to greater clinical disease severity, active disease on colonoscopy, and histological severe inflammation with an elevated CRP, while 51% of UC patients with active disease also had an elevated CRP. In a follow-up investigation, among patients with symptoms of active CD and an elevated CRP, 86% exhibited evidence of inflammation at colonoscopy [4, 6] . This suggests that CRP has the ability to predict active mucosal inflammation. Across studies, however, it has been showed that CRP (in both UC and CD patients), when compared to calprotectin and lactoferrin, is less sensitive and has a lower correlation with mucosal inflammation as shown by endoscopy [6] . Studies in patients with CD, with clinically inactive disease and elevated CRP, have demonstrated that the latter had higher chance of relapse in the following 2 years than those with normal CRP. In UC patients, CRP elevation was significantly correlated with severe clinical activity and active disease by means of colonoscopy but not with histological inflammation [4] . Yet, some patients have had persistent, normal levels of CRP despite active disease [7] . These patients often exhibit exclusive ileal disease and low body mass index [4] . For these patients, CRP will not be a useful marker for differentiation of quiescent from active disease [7] . Generally, the value of CRP as a predictor of relapse is controversial, with some studies considering it an accurate predictor and others not. A combination of CRP and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) has also been used to predict relapse in patients with CD [4] .",

The ESR determination is a commonly performed laboratory test and reflects the changes in the various acute-phase proteins [1] . The test measures the distance that erythrocytes have fallen after 1 h in a vertical column of anticoagulated blood under the influence of gravity [1] . ESR is not rapidly responsive to changes in clinical status, as the concentrations of many serum proteins vary and some have long half-lives [4] . ESR determinations have been shown to be satisfactory monitors of acute-phase response to disease after the first 24 h [1] . Therefore, ESR is less suited to detect changes in disease activity, and it fails to exhibit the real clinical course, as it may take several days to decrease even when rapid clinical improvement occurs. Hence, ESR is an indirect, crude, but fairly rapid assessment of the general acute-phase response [1, 4, 6] .",

The increase of ESR in increasing disease activity correlates more with colonic disease and does not reflect the disease activity in the small bowel [4] .

Increased titers of ASCA were reported to identify CD with high levels of specificity (96-100%) but low sensitivity (approximately 50%), while both IgA and IgG antibodies are formed [7, 8] . Indirect immunofluorescence (IIF) and standardized enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA) are the two main methods used for the detection of these antibodies [8] . Moreover, the titers of these antibodies do not seem to correlate with disease activity, and ASCA levels appear to be stable for long periods. In fact, patients with CD have been reported to have still high rates of ASCA, though their last outbreak of CD was 20 years ago and their markings on gastroscopy, colonoscopy, and histology were normal [9] . Interestingly, the results vary between different populations, as the sensitivity of ASCA IgA is lower in Japanese and Chinese CD patients when compared to Caucasian CD patients [1] . This observation suggests that several distinct genetic determinants and/or environmental risk factors may influence the ASCA response [1] .",

Numerous studies have been performed; in one study, ASCA antibodies were detected in 20-25% of healthy first-degree relatives of patients with CD. Another study showed detectable levels of ASCA in 31% of patients long before they were diagnosed with CD. For them the maximum frequency of antibodies was recorded 36 months before diagnosis [9] . These studies indicate that ASCA growth happens before or during early stages of disease. Hence, we assume that ASCA are likely produced in the context of early development of the disease, rather than as genetic markers in childhood. Further study needs to be done in order to conclude whether ASCA antibodies serve as indicators of future disease. For now, the initial event leading to IFPE is still unclear, but it is of great interest [9] .",

The most commonly employed method in use as a screening method for ANCAs is indirect immunofluorescence (IIF) on normal peripheral blood neutrophils [8] . But for diagnostic purposes, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) is used in laboratories to detect ANCAs [8, 10] . According to IIF, there are two types of fluorescence pattern: cytoplasmic granular with central interlobular accentuation (cANCA) and fine homogenous, rim-like staining of the perinuclear cytoplasm (or rim-accentuated fluorescence of the nuclei) designated as the pANCA pattern. Various target antigens of atypical pANCA have been intensively studied in IBD patients, and so far results have been conflicting regarding their potential use in clinical practice as their sensitivity and specificity are less than 60% [8] . It is likely that the target antigen for UC-related atypical pANCA is a complex conformational epitope which comprises the nuclear proteins histone H1, HMG-1, and HMG-2. Nevertheless, since the target antigen for UC-associated pANCA is yet unrecognized, sensitive and specific solidphase methods cannot be developed [8] . The sensitivity of the IIF assay for UC reaches the 87.2% [8] .",

It is released with cell death or activation, making it a sensitive marker of inflammation [6] . Various studies identify calprotectin as a sensitive marker of activity in CD, which also correlates well with endoscopic and histological activity in UC [4, 7] . Increased levels of fecal calprotectin had a positive predictive value of 81% and a negative-predictive value of 90% for relapse of UC. In patients with CD, the positive predictive value was 87%, and the negativepredictive value was 43% [6, 7] . Its sensitivity and specificity of relapse in both CD and UC ranges approximately at 90% and 83%, respectively. Additionally, the sensitivity and specificity for identification of IBD in adults were 93% and 96%, while, in children, the test confirmed 92% and only 76%, respectively [4, 6, 7] . Despite calprotectin's high sensitivity and specificity, it ought not to be considered as a specific marker of inflammation, since increased levels are also found in neoplasia, polyps, microscopic colitis, allergic colitis, active celiac disease, infections, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory enteropathy, increasing age, etc. [1, 6] . Relatively high levels of calprotectin are noticed in the stools of normal individuals, and this data is compatible with the hypothesis that in normal individuals most circulating neutrophils migrate through the mucosal membrane of the gastrointestinal tract wall and thereby terminate their circulating life [1] .",

Furthermore, the protein's concentration increases in active IBD, compared to inactive IBD with specificity between 85 and 90%.

During the natural course of MS, \u03b22-MG was found to be stable over time, and although urinary excretion of neopterin was found to be higher during clinical relapses, neopterin blood levels were not found to correlate with clinical and MRI measurements. Furthermore, both neopterin and \u03b22-MG are unstable and rapidly eliminated by the kidneys, and thus these molecules can be easily detected in urine specimens [34] .

The most useful markers are currently the presence of two or more IgG oligoclonal bands (OCBs), as well as an elevated IgG index. However, numerous other CSF biomarkers are under investigation, including kappa free light chains (KFLC), anti-myelin antibodies, sVCAM-1 (soluble vascular cell adhesion molecule-1), and 24S-hydroxycholestrol [36] . At present none of them, except for the OCBs, fulfills the criteria of applicability in clinical practice and should therefore be further investigated and validated in future studies [37] . As for CSF oligoclonal banding test, it is estimated to have sensitivities between 69 and 91% with specificities between 59 and 94% for the diagnosis of MS, and when combined with MRI studies, both sensitivity (56-100%) and specificity (53-96%) are enhanced [38] .

ACPA-positive patients with early RA are at increased risk of progressive joint damage, while ACPA testing may predict erosive disease more effectively than RF. The presence of ACPA is also predictive of more rapid radiographic progression [62] . Positive ACPA testing also appears to predict an increased risk for radiographic progression in patients with early oligo-or polyarthritis who are IgM RF negative. A decrease in ACPA titers can be seen in patients treated effectively, particularly if treated early with nonbiologic or biologic disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs), but is less frequent and of a lesser magnitude than the decrease in IgM RF. ACPA may be detectable months or even years before the development of RA, and the proportion of individuals who are seropositive for ACPA increases progressively until clinical onset of disease [61, 63] . Finally, this biomarker is useful in the differential diagnosis of early polyarthritis, because of the relatively high specificity for RA of these autoantibodies. The presence of ACPA is highly predictive of future development of RA with positive predictive values of >90% in most studies [61, 63] .",

The results, however, are inconsistent, and such uncertainty may also confound the assessment of disease activity with the widely used disease indices. Therefore, the value of conventional tests measuring serum complement and autoantibodies, as biomarkers for SLE disease activity, is being revisited. Several candidate biomarkers have emerged recently; alteration of the B cell subpopulation (namely, the increase in CD27 high plasma cells), cell-bound complement activation products, IFN-inducible genes expression and/or serum levels of IFN-inducible chemokines, serum levels of B lymphocyte stimulator, cytokines (IL-6, IL-10, IL-16, and IL-18), and anti-nucleosome antibodies may be valuable biomarkers for monitoring disease activity [67] .",

Current efforts are focused on identification of more sensitive and specific biomarkers to diagnose and monitor renal disease in SLE. Anti-nucleosome antibodies may be more sensitive and offer better diagnostic performance than anti-dsDNA for active disease, especially nephritis, in SLE patients. Other recent studies demonstrate a strong correlation between the presence of anti-C1q antibodies and lupus nephritis and suggest that anti-C1q determination may serve as a biomarker to monitor renal involvement and/or predict renal flares.

While NPSLE is a common manifestation, its diagnosis is extremely difficult due to lack of reliable biomarkers. Because autoantibodies are clearly involved in tissue damage in other organs, autoantibodies reactive to CNS antigens naturally become the focus of the investigation of NPSLE pathogenesis and the pursuit for reliable biomarkers. Stroke in patients with SLE is likely to reflect thrombosis due to antiphospholipid antibodies. In addition, recent studies provide convincing evidence that a subset of anti-dsDNA antibodies cross-react with a pentapeptide consensus sequence that is present in the extracellular domain of the N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptor. NMDA receptors bind the neurotransmitter glutamate expressed by neurons throughout the forebrain and particularly at the hippocampus. If such cross-reacting autoantibodies enter the brain upon transient breach of the blood-brain barrier, they may bind to antigens expressed in different regions of the brain and induce non-inflammatory neuronal injury resulting in various neurologic and psychological changes [67] . Antibodies to ribosomal P proteins (anti-P) were initially considered extremely promising biomarkers for the diagnosis of lupus psychosis and of mood disorders. Yet, it was demonstrated that anti-P antibody testing has negligible diagnostic utility for NPSLE overall or for these particular manifestations [70] . Testing for anti-P antibody is not useful in excluding disease-mediated psychosis or mood disorder with enough certainty, since more than 60% of cases are false negative. Also, a false-positive rate of \u223c20% militates against the dependence on this laboratory test for diagnosing psychiatric disorders in lupus patients [70] .",

In another SLE study, the investigators developed antigen microarrays including several SLE-related antigens, and they found clusters of antibody reactivity associated to glomerulonephritis and overall disease activity [75] [76] [77] .",

Important amendments to the translational research enterprise are necessary to address these challenges. Hence, imperative alterations should include rigorous design for studies of biomarkers that would allow valid interpretation of their clinical utility. In particular, for studies of biomarkers for diagnosis, greater attention to potential confounders would help ensure accuracy. When examining biomarkers of disease activity, emphasis should be placed on evaluating these markers longitudinally. In research regarding biomarkers of prognosis, longitudinal design and the use of validated outcome measures would provide reliable results in order to enable use in clinical decision-making process of novel biomarkers that outperforms currently available tests. Finally, the development of novel high-throughput assays might hold tremendous potential for shaping how ARDs are diagnosed, prognosticated, and managed clinically over the coming years.",
