Data from 180 (90%) of these premises that responded confirmed that the disease was already widespread throughout Iceland by the first week of April 2010, with affected premises in the south, west, and north of Iceland. These data provided evidence that all horses residing at these premises appeared to be susceptible to the infectious agent, with a morbidity of 100% but low mortality. Dry cough was usually the first clinical sign noted, most often coexisting with symptoms of mucopurulent nasal discharge and mild conjunctivitis, although rectal temperature remained normal in most horses. Laryngoscopy revealed laryngitis and inflammation of the upper trachea. The incubation period was between 2 and 4 weeks and the duration of clinical signs varied from 2 to 10 weeks.",

At that time, 10 out of the 42 resident horses showed clinical signs of respiratory tract infection, one of which had been coughing for 16 days. Three other horses at farm 16 had a history of similar clinical signs 2 to 6 weeks earlier. Network analysis of affected farms identified a single common training yard (yard A) as a primary center of transmission (Fig. 1). Two horses leaving yard A on 19 February transmitted the disease both to farm 16 and to a stable in the Reykjavik area. All horses (n = 20) that left yard A in March transmitted the disease to new premises (n = 18). These new premises each had up to 50 horses stabled and became secondary centers of transmission. However, two horses from yard A which had returned to farm 16 on 4 February were not incubating the disease. Therefore, it is likely that the transmission of the infectious agent to horses at yard A began between 5 and 19 February 2010.",

Nasal swabs were tested by PCR for viruses known to cause respiratory disease in horses and some common respiratory viruses of humans and animals. Paired blood samples were used to determine if horses developed an antibody response to equine respiratory viruses during the course of their disease. Established and primary cell lines were also used toward the isolation of a potential causal virus. All of these tests proved negative, with the exception of equine gammaherpesviruses, which were isolated from small numbers of both healthy and clinically affected horses (see Table S1 in the supplemental material).

The majority of Icelandic S. zooepidemicus isolates recovered during the epidemic (199 of 257 isolates [77%]) fell into four distinct clades (Fig. 2) that corresponded to four separate multilocus sequence typing (MLST) sequence types (STs). Clade 4 (ST306) contained 37 isolates obtained from eight horses from the Institute for Experimental Pathology, Icelandic Veterinary Institute at Keldur, Reykjavik, that were sampled over a 50-day period from 13 September to 1 November 2010. Six of these horses had signs of respiratory disease over the sampling period. Clade 3 (ST248) contained 52 isolates obtained from 14 horses and a dog. The horses were resident at 8 different farms, and the isolates were recovered over a 160-day period between 19 May and 25 October 2010. Twelve of the horses had signs of disease, including two with pyrexia. The remaining two horses were both from farm 17, had died with signs of interstitial pneumonia identified postmortem, and were infected with ST248 or both ST248 and ST209 (Table S2). Clade 2 (ST246) contained 28 isolates obtained from 14 horses residing at 10 farms over a 162-day period between 6 May and 14 October 2010 and also one human isolate. Two of the horses infected with ST246 had died with evidence of pneumonia or interstitial pneumonia at postmortem examination. All 12 of the remaining horses had clinical signs of disease, including 2 with pyrexia at the time of sampling. Finally, clade 1 (ST209) contained 81 isolates from 45 horses residing at 21 premises across Iceland over a 152-day period between 10 May and 8 October 2010. ST209 was also recovered from a human and a cat. Forty-three of the 45 horses from which ST209 isolates were recovered had clinical signs of respiratory disease at the time of sampling (n = 35) or had died (n = 8). S. zooepidemicus was thought to have contributed to the death of six of these horses, with signs of sepsis, bronchopneumonia, pleuropneumonia, or interstitial pneumonia apparent at postmortem examination. The remaining 58 isolates of S. zooepidemicus were recovered from 36 horses, a human, and a cat. Mixed populations of two different isolates of S. zooepidemicus were recovered from 13 horses, and three different isolates were recovered from 2 horses.",

The 17 resident horses at farm 5 had been diagnosed with respiratory disease on day \u221214, and S. zooepidemicus was recovered from the nasal swabs of 10 horses, which were sampled on day \u221212. Eight of these 10 isolates were subsequently identified as ST209 by genome sequencing. Following their introduction, the three healthy horses were monitored for clinical signs of disease. Nasal discharge was apparent from day 10, and the discharge became mucopurulent on day 19 and was accompanied by the first observation of coughing. Horse 17 was euthanized on day 23, while horses 16 and 18 were euthanized on day 30 postintroduction. Postmortem examination of these three horses revealed signs of respiratory tract infection which included the presence of mucopurulent material in the nasal cavity, larynx, and trachea and enlarged cervical and mandibular lymph nodes. Histopathological analysis identified subacute rhinitis, laryngitis, and tracheitis with transmigration of neutrophils through the mucosal epithelium. Seven of eight isolates of S. zooepidemicus that were recovered on day 28 or during postmortem examination of horses 16 and 18 on day 30 were ST209 (Table S2). However, none of the seven isolates recovered from horses 16, 17, or 18 prior to day 28 were ST209, and the ST209 strain was not recovered from the postmortem examination of horse 17 on day 23 postintroduction. The failure to recover ST209 from horse 17 may have been due to the onset of clinical signs in this animal and its being euthanized on day 23, before shedding of ST209 had accumulated to detectable levels in the presence of other strains of S. zooepidemicus. The sampling regimen was, at the time, designed to detect a viral agent and not S. zooepidemicus. A greater depth of bacterial isolates recovered from clinical samples may have enabled the subsequent detection of ST209 in a mixed population of S. zooepidemicus.",

In keeping with rapid transmission across the population, the Icelandic isolates of ST209 predominantly shared the same complement of 41 spacer sequences (Fig. 4). However, ST209 isolates from resident horses 3, 5, 7, and 14 on farm 5 were found to contain a novel spacer 35 sequence. This unique spacer was not present in those isolates recovered from four other resident horses 1, 2, 8, and 9 at farm 5 or from any other affected horses from the other farms throughout Iceland. The ST209 isolates that were recovered from horses 16 and 18 from day 28 contained the unique spacer 35 sequence, directly linking their infection with this strain to their arrival and exposure to the resident horses at farm 5. Our data show that ST209 was transmitted from horses with signs typical of the respiratory disease epidemic to healthy horses and provide further evidence that ST209 was the most likely cause of the epidemic of respiratory disease in Iceland.",

To determine if the ST209 strain persisted within the Icelandic horse population, we sampled an additional 36 healthy horses 3 years after the epidemic. A total of 175 S. zooepidemicus isolates were recovered. Of these, 20 isolates were identified by quantitative PC (qPCR) as ST209 and had been obtained from four healthy horses stabled at different farms throughout Iceland (Table S2). WGS of the isolates from each of the individual horses indicated that they were very closely related. However, isolates from the different horses clustered separately, with longer branch lengths relative to the isolates recovered from the epidemic in 2010. We analyzed a subset of our data set, for which the date of isolation was known, with the Bayesian phylogenetics software BEAST (13). Removal of strains with identical sequences that were recovered from the same animal on the same date produced a data set of 59 ST209 isolates with 434 polymorphic core genome positions (Table S2). This data set comprised 4 isolates from 2013, 48 isolates that were recovered during the epidemic in 2010, and 7 non-Icelandic isolates which shared an identical or closely related ST to ST209. BEAST includes a number of relaxed molecular clock models that permit modeling of variations in substitution rates on different branches of the tree, allowing correction for the observed rate variation in our data. Utilizing these models, we found that a strict clock with a skyline population model was the best fit of our data, and the mean substitution rate per core genome site per year was calculated as 2.0 \u00d7 10\u22126. This substitution rate is similar to core genome rates reported for other streptococci, including Streptococcus pyogenes (1.1 \u00d7 10\u22126) (14) and Streptococcus pneumoniae (1.6 \u00d7 10\u22126) (15), and many other Gram-positive bacteria, including Staphylococcus aureus (3.3 \u00d7 10\u22126) (16). Interestingly, this rate is faster than that for the closely related host-restricted pathogen Streptococcus equi (5.2 \u00d7 10\u22127) (17), with which S. zooepidemicus shares >97% DNA identity (11). This difference most likely reflects the unusual lifestyle of S. equi, which can persist within the guttural pouches of recovered horses (17). The analysis provided a median estimate for the TMRCA of the Icelandic ST209 strains of July 2008 (95% highest posterior density, August 2007 to May 2009) (Fig. 5).",

ST306 strains were only recovered from 8 horses at the Icelandic Veterinary Institute. Even then, the nucleotide diversity of these isolates was significantly higher than that of ST209 isolates.

Although the epidemic agent was generally transmitted through the coughing of infected horses, coughing was not observed at yard A before April 2010, most probably due to a relatively long incubation period permitting apparently healthy horses to return to their original premises posttraining. Instead, the most likely route of transmission of the epidemic strain at yard A was a water treadmill, which horses used on a daily basis. The water used in the treadmill contained no disinfectant and was changed on a once- or twice-weekly basis, providing ideal conditions for the transmission of S. zooepidemicus between the visiting horses. The addition of chlorine coupled with regular cleaning and disinfection of water treadmills may minimize or eliminate the transmission of S. zooepidemicus or other infectious agents via this route.",

However, we note that ST306 isolates recovered from eight horses stabled at the Icelandic Veterinary Institute over a period of 50 days had significantly higher nucleotide diversity than the ST209 isolates, which were recovered from 45 horses throughout Iceland over a much longer period of time. Our data suggest that the ST306 isolates of S. zooepidemicus likely persisted in the horses at the Icelandic Veterinary Institute, accruing nucleotide diversity over time within this isolated population. Analysis of S. equi isolates recovered from persistently infected animals identified that they had an increased rate of substitution and that isolates from the same animal could accrue substitutions, amplifications, and deletions (17). Therefore, it is possible that a mixed population of ST209 variants, which could have originated from one or more horses, may have been introduced to Iceland at a date much closer to the start of the 2010 epidemic. However, it is also possible that the proposed transmission of ST209 strains, for example, via the submerged treadmill at yard A, provided conditions that led to a selective sweep of a more diverse population of ST209, with the successful variants establishing the epidemic. In this manner, the introduction of ST209 into Iceland may have predated the calculated TMRCA.",

To date, with the exception of Iceland, ST209 strains have only been isolated from Scandinavia, and it is interesting the close relationships between many training yards in Iceland and this region of Europe. The import of horses to Iceland has been prohibited since 1882 for biosecurity reasons. Although the import of used riding equipment is also prohibited, it is difficult to control. Therefore, contaminated tack represents a possible industry-related route of introduction of the ST209 strain into Iceland. The ability of ST209 strains to cross host boundaries provides an alternative import mechanism whereby the infection of a human may have facilitated onward anthroponotic transmission to horses resident in Iceland. While it is not possible to identify the precise route by which the ST209 strain entered Iceland, a heightened awareness of the routes of transmission will greatly reduce the risk of future epidemics of disease in this important horse population.",

A minimum 30-fold depth of coverage for more than 92% of the reference genomes was achieved for both reference sequences (Table S2). The default mapping parameters recommended for reads were employed but with the minimum score required for mapping increased to 30 to make the mapping more conservative. Candidate SNPs were identified using SAMtools mpileup (44), with SNPs filtered to remove those at sites with a mapping depth of less than 5 reads and an SNP score below 60. SNPs at sites with heterogeneous mappings were filtered out if the SNP was present in less than 75% of reads at that site (16). Identification of the core genomes was performed as previously described (16, 45). Recombination was detected in the genomes by using Gubbins (http://sanger-pathogens.github.io/gubbins/) (46). Figure S1 summarizes the Gubbins output for clade 1 (ST209) isolates. Phylogenetic trees were constructed separately using RAxML v7.0.4 (47) for all sites in the core genomes containing SNPs, with a general time-reversible (GTR) model with a gamma correction for among-site rate variations (16). The genetic variation within each of the four clades, with isolates from duplicate horses removed (Table S2), was summarized using their nucleotide diversity (8), \u03c0, calculated using the DendroPy Python library (9). The variances of the nucleotide diversity estimates were calculated as described in reference 48 and used to compute confidence intervals using a normal distribution approximation. We used the Bayesian software package BEAST (v1.7.4) (49) to investigate the temporal, spatial, and demographic evolution of the ST209 population, with replicate samples removed from the analysis. To estimate the substitution rates and times for divergences of internal nodes on the tree, a GTR model with a gamma correction for among-site rate variation was used. All combinations of strict, relaxed log normal, relaxed exponential, and random clock models and constant, exponential, expansion, logistic, and skyline population models were evaluated. For each, three independent chains were run for 100 million generations, sampling every 10 generations. A maximum clade credibility tree was created from the resulting combined trees created using the treeAnnotator program, also from the BEAST package.",
