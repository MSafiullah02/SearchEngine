Recently, OP and saliva testing using VTM also were shown to be comparable to NP swabs for detection of the virus (3, 4). As the COVID-19 pandemic has swept across the world, availability of VTM has become severely limited, impairing local and regional capacity for diagnosis. Since SARS-CoV2 has capped RNA with a 5\u2032 GTP resembling host RNA and that the virus sgRNA manifests remarkable stability (5), we posited that qPCR detection of SARS-CoV-2 in specimens preserved in phosphate buffered saline (PBS), which is readily available, would be comparable to those in VTM. Here, we report that sample preservation in PBS or VTM are comparably effective for the preservation of SARS-CoV-2 in endotracheal secretions.",

All subjects were mechanically ventilated for acute hypoxemic respiratory failure due to confirmed COVID-19 pneumonia. Specimens were collected into a sterile container via closed circuit, in-line catheter suction of respiratory secretions from the endotracheal tube (ET), as part of routine clinical care. Swabs were then dropped into vials containing PBS or VTM and transported to the RUCDR laboratory for analysis. To test intra- and inter-patient variation in efficacy of detecting SARS-CoV2 from ET-derived samples, three experimental procedures were performed. Eight samples from two subjects (four from each subject) were harvested at the same time and transported in either VTM or PBS. Samples were processed immediately (at 0 hours) or after 2 hours at room temperature (RT). Real time-qPCR (RT-qPCR) was performed on 1 sample from each transport medium at each incubation time (0 or 2 hours) and Ct values for the SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid (N), open reading frame 1ab ORF1ab, and spike protein (S) genes were compared; bacteriophage MS2 (MS2) spiked into the samples was used as a positive control. In a parallel experiment, the stability of detection of SARS-CoV2 sgRNA by RT-qPCR in samples transported in PBS and VTM also was examined after remaining at room temperature for time points ranging from 0 to 18 hours. These experiments mimicked field conditions, in which specimens remain in transport at RT for periods up to 18 hours. Twenty samples from each of two subjects were kept for 0, 2, 4, 6 h or overnight at RT in VTM or PBS to mimic these real-world transport condition. Ct values were again compared for the RT-qPCRs for the three viral genes described above across the indicated time points. To examine inter-subject variance, we examined samples from an additional 12 patients whose ET secretions were transported in either PBS or VTM; RT-qPCR was performed immediately on arrival in the lab for these 24 samples, and Ct values were again compared between those transported in VTM or PBS.",

The correlations ranged from 0.83 for the ORF1ab gene to 0.93 for the N, and all were significant (p<0.05). Since some individuals contributed samples at multiple time points, there were repeated measures per person. To examine a single measurement per person, we restricted the analysis to the data obtained at time 0 only. The correlation for the three genes did not change substantially and remained significant. Across the time 0 samples from the 16 individual subjects, the standard deviations (SD) varied with respect to the gene studied, but did not vary significantly according to the transport medium. Thus, using PBS did not significantly skew the distribution of values in relation to the VTM (data not shown).",

We next evaluated if across individual samples, the values obtained in testing one gene correlated with the results for the other genes. Additionally, we tested whether the choice of transport medium made a difference. In total, for the 13 samples transported in VTM, the pair-wise correlations between the three genes ranged from 0.947 to 0.956.

We next considered whether there was decay in viral signal over time, and whether it differed according to the transport medium used. From the prior analyses, the coefficient of hours of storage was estimated to be negative in the models of all three genes tested (approximately -0.03 for each gene) and was not significantly different from zero (all p-values >0.5). These data indicate that storage at room temperature for up to 18 hours had little effect on the values detected in the RT-qPCRs for the three SARS-CoV-2 genes tested. However, these models did not include an interaction term for the transport medium used for storage and time, and there could be differences between the media. To assess this possibility, we performed the same analyses as above, but included interactions between hours of storage and transport medium used. For each of the three genes tested, both the main effect of time and the interaction between time and the transport medium were not statistically significant (all p-values >0.5) and estimates were close to 0. Therefore, we did not detect decay in the viral signal or differential decay by transport medium over the time interval studied.",

However, mounting demand for testing has caused a depletion of the viral transport media needed to perform SARS-CoV-2 pCR testing (11) . Thus, in the midst of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, the FDA has allowed laboratories to consider testing alternative transport media (HYPERLINK \"https://www.fda.gov/medical-devices/emergency-situations-medical-devices/faqs-diagnostic-testing-sars-cov-2\" \\o \"https://www.fda.gov/medical-devices/emergency-situations-medical-devices/faqs-diagnostic-testing-sars-cov-2\"https://www.fda.gov/medical-devices/emergency-situations-medical-devices/faqs-diagnostic-testing-sars-cov-2\n, last accessed April 29, 2020). Our experiments using clinical samples demonstrate the efficacy of PBS as a transport medium and its applicability to clinically relevant conditions, such as overnight storage at room temperature. First, we determined that SARS-CoV-2 qPCR detection with PBS as a transport medium has high intra-patient reliability. Next, using PBS for transport, we demonstrated strong inter-patient reliability of SARS-CoV-2 qPCR. We also found strong correlation of Ct values from specimens transported in either PBS or VTM across multiple subjects with unknown viral loads. These results establish PBS as a dependable transport medium for use with clinical samples. Our data are consistent with the recent demonstration that PBS is equivalent to VTM when each medium is spiked with known quantities of SARS-CoV-2 (12).",
