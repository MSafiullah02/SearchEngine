Some examples include mitochondria (organelles); melanosomes and various types of secretory granules (inclusions); microtubules, microfilaments (e.g., actin), and intermediate filaments (cytoskeleton); cilia, microvilli, and intercellular junctions (cell surface specializations); and extracellular constituents such as basement membranes, collagen, and amyloid.1. , 4. , 9. , 10.  The high-resolution capability of the electron microscope is due to the small wavelength of the electron, approximately 0.004 nm for a 100-keV electron, compared with approximately 500 nm for visual light. The resolution of the modern electron microscope is 0.2 nm; in contrast, that of a good light microscope is 200 nm (these figures are based on Abbe's and de Brogli's fundamental equations).1 It is important for pathologists to realize that the electron microscope is a morphologic instrument similar to the light microscope.",

Specimens are initially placed in a buffered glutaraldehyde-based fixative, post-fixed in osmium tetroxide, dehydrated in graded alcohols, and embedded in an epoxy resin. Thick (1 \u00b5m) epoxy sections are stained with a buffered 1% toluidine blue solution to localize appropriate material for ultrastructural evaluation.

Modern electron microscopes are partially computerized and easier to operate than older models. A high vacuum can be achieved in approximately 5 to 10 minutes by use of a turbomolecular pump in place of the much slower and contaminating oil diffusion pump. Many of the latest instruments have zoom magnification, axis image rotation, and data imprinting and storage on hard drives or CD-ROMs. Future electron microscopes will be substantially smaller and will be capable of being operated in a lighted room. A high-refresh-rate charge-coupled device (CCD) that can transfer the image to a high-resolution flat-panel computer screen will replace the current fluorescent screen and the mechanically complex sheet film camera. The microscope should have one accelerating voltage (80 keV) and a realistic maximum magnification of 100,000. Captured digital images can be manipulated by using one of the many available photo-editing programs and printed on a high-resolution inkjet printer. With the availability of rapid ultrasonic and microwave tissue processing techniques and instant photography, there is no reason why a diagnostic transmission electron microscopic study cannot be completed within 24 hours or less. When properly maintained, a transmission electron microscope should last upward of 30 years. The only major expense of current scopes is, ironically, the service contract.",

When an ancillary procedure is necessary to solve a diagnostic problem, most pathologists order a specific panel of immunohistochemical stains. However, the extensive use of immunostaining procedures has revealed a number of serious pitfalls and limitations, including a paucity of absolute organ- or tumor-specific antibodies; antigen diffusion problems (e.g., thyroglobulin, myoglobulin); anomalous or unexpected immunostaining results (e.g., keratin expression in astrocytomas13 and in malignant bone and soft tissue neoplasms14); and the selection of an inappropriate and often expensive immunophenotyping panel based on a false diagnostic presumption and an inability to detect small amounts of antigen (e.g., in poorly differentiated neuroendocrine carcinomas). Perhaps the most important problem with immunohistochemical procedures is a lack of standardized methodology and quality control. For example, different antigen retrieval methods, such as enzymatic and citrate treatments, microwave and ultrasonic procedures, and especially the newer heat-induced epitope retrieval (HIER) method, can alter antigen epitopes and staining patterns.15\n",

Some of these procedures are fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction, DNA-based polymerase chain reaction, laser capture microdissection, confocal scanning laser microscopy, and atomic force microscopy (see Chapter 7). As with electron microscopy and immunodiagnostic methods, problems and shortcomings in cytogenetic and molecular procedures limit their diagnostic usefulness.

The differential diagnosis of the three rare types depends on the ultrastructural identification of disease-specific glomerular deposits. The pertinent diagnostic features (primarily ultrastructural) of these diseases can be summarized as follows. Amyloidosis (proteinuria-nephrotic syndrome) often occurs in myeloma (plasma cell dyscrasia) patients; the usual type found is AL amyloidosis (abnormal light chains are present). Ultrastructurally, numerous 8- to 12-nm nonbranching fibrils are randomly distributed in the glomerulus. Fibrillary glomerulopathy is characterized by a ribbon-like pattern of IgA and C3 and a primarily subepithelial deposition of 20- to 30-nm fibrils with an amyloid P component. In immunotactoid glomerulopathy, IgG, C3, and characteristic clusters of spherical microtubular structures with a 30- to 40-nm diameter are also found in the mesangium. The cryoglobulinemic glomerulopathies are divided into types I, II, and III and are associated with B-cell lymphoplasmacytoid malignancies. Type I is identified by IgG and 80-nm-wide bundles of rigid fibrils or \u201cfingerprint\u201d arrays of tubular structures, all of which are distributed throughout the glomerulus. In types II and III, mixed cryoglobulins and 25-nm microtubules are found in thrombi and in the subepithelial and mesangial regions of the glomerulus. For more detailed information on all the glomerulopathies, see Chapter 29 and the cited references.20. , 21. , 22. , 23. \n",

In the diverse group of vacuolar myopathies, electron microscopy is helpful in identifying the contents of the vacuoles common to these diseases. For example, tubules and filaments ranging in diameter from 15 to 18 nm are found in inclusion body myopathies. Abnormal lipid and glycogen metabolism, ion channel disorders, and so-called mitochondrial myopathies (pleomorphic mitochondria and paracrystalline cristae or matrical inclusions) constitute the metabolic myopathies. The congenital myopathies include nemaline \u201crod body\u201d myopathy (elongate electron-dense aggregates of filaments that resemble streaming Z-discs); those exhibiting abnormal cytoplasmic structures (e.g., myofilaments, organelles, sarcoplasmic reticulum, T-tubules) and inclusions such as fingerprint and zebra bodies; and those with centrally located abnormal aggregates of sarcomere constituents (\u201ctarget fibers\u201d) such as central core disease, neurogenic atrophy, and inflammatory myopathies accompanying recent denervation (Fig. 6-9\n). Ultrastructural studies are indicated in approximately 20% of muscle biopsy specimens following standard light microscopy, special stains, and appropriate enzyme histochemical stains.44\n",

Myofibroblasts are primarily fibroblasts with the additional presence of peripheral arrays of actin microfilaments with dispersed fusiform densities, a fibronexus, and small desmosome-like and gap junctions. The immunohistochemical identification of a myofibroblast (especially neoplastic) is doubtful because five immunophenotyes have been identified: (1) vimentin and \u03b1-smooth muscle actin (\u03b1-SMA); (2) vimentin, \u03b1-SMA, and desmin; (3) vimentin and desmin; (4) vimentin; and (5) vimentin, \u03b1-SMA, and smooth muscle myosin heavy chain with or without desmin.55 It is thus obvious that myofibroblastic tumors\u2014myofibroblastoma and myofibrosarcoma56\u2014can be accurately diagnosed only by electron microscopy.

The predominant cells in the storiform areas are spindle-shaped neoplastic fibroblasts with a prominent branching and often dilated rough endoplasmic reticulum, variable arrays of vimentin filaments, and a large nucleolus. The giant rounded cells in the pleomorphic regions characteristically have a multisegmented nucleus with large nucleoli and occasional pseudoinclusions, arrays of vimentin intermediate filaments (prominent in the \u201crhabdoid\u201d cells), and a well-developed rough endoplasmic reticulum (Fig. 6-13\n). Other cell types that are variably identified include myofibroblasts (see earlier), histiofibroblasts with the additional presence of variable numbers of lysosomes (these are more commonly seen in the pleomorphic tumor cells), cells with various combinations of all the preceding features, and undifferentiated mesenchymal cells that are variably present in all poorly differentiated sarcomas. On the basis of these findings, I propose a new pleomorphic fibrosarcoma classification (Table 6-1\n). Pleomorphic fibrosarcoma (originally designated by Arthur Purdy Stout) is a patternless neoplasm analogous to other pleomorphic sarcomas (e.g., pleomorphic liposarcoma).59\nPleomorphic myxoid fibrosarcoma replaces the inappropriate appellation myxofibrosarcoma. Current pathology nomenclature uses an adjective preceding the variant of a particular nosologic entity (e.g., sclerosing hemangioma, myxoid liposarcoma, plexiform schwannoma). Most myxoid fibrosarcomas are low-grade, poorly cellular neoplasms containing relatively few pleomorphic tumor cells. However, if these tumors are not completely excised, they may progress to high-grade neoplasms. I have not seen a storiform-pleomorphic myxoid fibrosarcoma in my practice. The term malignant giant cell tumor of soft parts is an appropriate general designation, because not all these neoplasms are fibroblastic.",
