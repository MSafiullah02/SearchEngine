It was a possibility that the animals could have served as disease reservoirs, but that was not confirmed by any credible source [4]. It was not long before droplet and contact person-to-person transmission became known as the primary mode of transmission [5]. This led to a rapid increase in the number of cases in China outside Wuhan, with 31.3% of all patients having recently visited the city and 72.3% having recently been in contact with its residents [6]. On January 30, 2020, the WHO announced a state of international public health emergency, later declaring COVID-19 to be a pandemic in March 2020 [7]. Despite a significant infectivity rate, the case-fatality rate among confirmed cases of COVID-19 is estimated at 3.7%, with the majority of deaths typically occurring among the elderly (age > 80 years), patients having multiple comorbidities, and the immunocompromised population [8].",

            "text": "The initial 22 days of reporting showed a significant increase in the overall disease cases worldwide. This was explained by the continuous and chain-like human-to-human transmission at the birth site of the disease in China, along with poor restrictions on travel and transit [12]. This led to a rapid and prevalent spread that reached many nearby regions and countries. However, a significant decrease in incidence followed during the next 11 days, mainly due to decisions taken by the Chinese government and the Chinese CDC [13]. These decisions ranged from raising awareness, disinfection, and declaring states of emergency, to building make-shift hospitals for patient management [3,14]. This helped contain the disease in China and led to an eventual decrease in incidence. Nevertheless, a subsequent significant increase in worldwide incidence ensued as of day 33 onward due to the rapid spread of the disease across the Chinese borders. Many countries did not possess the required resources and facilities to face such a pandemic and were, thus, vulnerable to its high infectivity.",

What is even more concerning is that the percentage of deaths from resolved cases in the latter countries is prominently high. In Italy, the death rate fluctuated at the beginning, increasing and then decreasing, before witnessing a steady rise that has been going on up until day 53. It is evident that the Italian healthcare system was taken by surprise with respect to the viral outbreak, and this lack of preparation explains the initial increase in death rates [15]. The subsequent decrease can be explained by the initial attempts at containment proposed by the Italian government; however, oversaturation of the hospitals and facilities caused a subsequent rise in the death rate that has been going on steadily [16]. On the other hand, Iran had a mortality rate of 100% during the first couple of days of reporting. This can be warranted as under-reporting from the Iranian government due to lack of screening resources possessed at the time as well as the vulnerable healthcare system present, which could not properly contain or adequately treat the disease in the affected populations [17]. Subsequent continuous decrease in mortality rates coupled with increases in recovery rates followed up until the most recent reports.",

With the containment that occurred in China and the decreasing death rates in Iran, attention has shifted to European countries exhibiting increasing incidence such as Germany, France, and Switzerland. The significance of fighting COVID-19 more aggressively in Europe revolves around the old-age structure found in its countries, which means that there are more vulnerable people affected [18]. Africa, on the other hand, suffers from abysmal medical infrastructure and would require international aid to help stop preventable deaths caused by the disease [19]. Parallels can be drawn to South America, which only further proves that this pandemic will not end except with a collective global effort.",
