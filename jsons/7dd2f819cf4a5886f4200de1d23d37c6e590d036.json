Whereas AI is not yet used to analyze all available imaging modalities, an unsupervised AI algorithm called \"fuzzy c-means clustering\" is already utilized in MRI to segment brain tissues into grey matter, white matter, and cerebrospinal fluid. In combination with digital brain atlas registration, the brain is robustly segmented into multiple sub-regions that are colocated over longitudinal scans (Fig. 1 ). MR images are composed of a three-dimensional grid of voxels that are assigned signal values throughout the image. Since voxel values in MRI scans have arbitrary units (unlike CT scans, which are characterized by pixel values that are directly proportional to the density of the imaged tissue), parametric maps, which assign a quantity to each voxel, are created from multiple MRI sequences. Parametric maps to provide images, for example, in the form of T1 and T2 relaxometry maps [54] . These physical quantities, which represent the relaxation of proton spins in tissue, change with tissue composition. As an example, if brain edema results from a viral infection, the T1 values will increase due to the addition of fluid in the tissue. The regions delineated with \"fuzzy c-means clustering\" and \"atlas-based registration\" can be directly applied to these parametric maps, and changes in disease status, such as accumulation of fluid or blood in the brain, can be predicted from abnormal findings. MRI of the brain of experimental animals will likely be exceptionally useful to refine the sequence of pathogenetic events in diseases caused by encephalitic RG-4 pathogens, such as Hendra virus, Nipah virus, or tick-borne encephalitis virus. For example, brain MRI scans of patients infected with Nipah virus have shown acute encephalitis with multiple lesions visible using T2-weighted and fluid attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) images [55, 56] . These same MR imaging sequences performed in human studies may be performed and refined in animal models using clinical MR scanners within the BSL-4 environment.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 115, "end": 119, "text": "[44]", "ref_id": "BIBREF43"}, {"start": 120, "end": 124, "text": "[45]", "ref_id": "BIBREF44"}, {"start": 125, "end": 129, "text": "[46]", "ref_id": "BIBREF45"}, {"start": 130, "end": 134, "text": "[47]", "ref_id": "BIBREF46"}, {"start": 1029, "end": 1033, "text": "[54]", "ref_id": "BIBREF53"}, {"start": 1991, "end": 1995, "text": "[55,", "ref_id": "BIBREF54"}, {"start": 1996, "end": 1999, "text": "56]", "ref_id": "BIBREF55"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 536, "end": 543, "text": "(Fig. 1", "ref_id": "FIGREF0"}], "section": "Infectious Disease Imaging and Artificial Intelligence in a BSL-4 Environment"}, {"text": "Many RG-4 pathogens diffusely affect multiple organs within the human body, including lung abnormalities caused by Nipah virus infection [57] , liver damage, and disseminated intravascular coagulopathy during EBOV infection [58] . Therefore, segmenting liver, kidney, spleen, lungs, and lymph nodes in collected images is needed to detect structural or physiologic changes. Deep learning convolutional neural networks can automatically segment multiple abdominal organs in CT and MRI modalities using the processes described above. Given this robust segmentation, radiometric features, such as texture and histogram analysis of voxels within the region of interest, can be used to classify stages of the disease process and correlate these features with clinical parameters, such as liver enzyme concentrations or virus titers. For instance, a method to quantify lung abnormalities in various disease models is now available [59] . Initially, the lungs are automatically segmented from a chest CT scan. Segmenting the lung field without any pathologic condition is done with standard image analysis methods, such as region growing, which starts with the initialization of a seed point within the region of interest and includes areas in the vicinity of the seed point based on whether the signal intensity is within a given threshold. This iterative process ends when values of neighboring voxels are not within the threshold. However, the region growing algorithm will fail in the initial lung segmentation when hyper-dense voxels in the lung are outside the threshold, requiring manual correction. Recently, an AI method was established to fully automate the lung field segmentation process when the lungs contain hyperdense pathological areas [60] . This deep learning algorithm was trained with thousands of normal and abnormal human CT lung images to segment images of lung fields. Post-processing with morphological operators such as erosions (removal of areas) and dilations (inclusion of areas) is then needed to finalize the segmentation process. By modifying the post-processing parameters, accurate lung field segmentation was achieved in a nonhuman primate (Fig. 2) , whereas the lung field was originally overestimated.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 137, "end": 141, "text": "[57]", "ref_id": "BIBREF56"}, {"start": 224, "end": 228, "text": "[58]", "ref_id": "BIBREF57"}, {"start": 925, "end": 929, "text": "[59]", "ref_id": "BIBREF58"}, {"start": 1746, "end": 1750, "text": "[60]", "ref_id": "BIBREF59"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 2169, "end": 2177, "text": "(Fig. 2)", "ref_id": "FIGREF1"}], "section": "Infectious Disease Imaging and Artificial Intelligence in a BSL-4 Environment"}, {"text": "Current methods of analyses also involve correlations between imaging biomarkers and clinical measures, such as cytokine profiles, viral DNA/RNA concentrations, and blood composition testing.

Molecular probes, such as fluorodeoxyglucose ( 18 F-FDG; a marker of cellular glycolytic activity), can indicate increased cell metabolic activity in organs during infection with RG-4 pathogens [61] . Unfortunately, probes such as 18 F-FDG are not entirely specific, and development of agent/disease-specific probes is urgently needed. Examples of more specific probes that have been investigated to study host responses in infectious disease imaging include PET fluorine radioisotopes such as fluoro-thymidine ( 18 F-FLT) [62] , fluorine-18 radio-labeled serum albumin ( 18 F-albumin) [63] , and 18 [64] . 18 F-FLT can be used to investigate cellular proliferation during cancers such as lymphoma or during infectious diseases. 18 F-albumin can be used to detect vessel leakage. 18 F-DPA-714 is a selective ligand for the translocator protein (TSPO) to investigate over-expression of activated macrophages and serves as a biomarker for neuroinflammation.
