Rottweilers and German shepherds were the most frequent breeds among CPV-positive pedigree dogs (n = 96).

In addition to feline panleukopenia virus (FPLV) and canine parvovirus type 2 (CPV-2), which have been known since 1920s and late 1970s, respectively, additional parvoviruses have been detected in wild carnivores (Decaro and Buonavoglia, 2012b) . Currently, carnivore parvoviruses are members of the genus Parvovirus (family Parvoviridae, subfamily Parvovirinae) and are considered as host variants of a unique viral species, Feline panleukopenia virus (http://ictvdb.bio-mirror.cn/Ictv/fs_parvo.htm).", "cite_spans": [{"start": 534, "end": 565, "text": "(Decaro and Buonavoglia, 2012b)", "ref_id": "BIBREF8"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Introduction"}, {"text": "CPV-2 emergence was associated to a cross-species transmission of FPLV to dogs through an intermediate host, possibly an unidentified wild carnivore.
