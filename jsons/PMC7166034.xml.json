Later on, The World Health Organization (WHO) named this pathogenic virus for 2019-nCoV.2\n,\n3 The pathogenic virus is a member of a large group of highly diverse viruses called coronaviruses, it is an enveloped virus that is composed of a positive-sense single-stranded RNA as its genetic material.4 On March 11, 2020, WHO has declared COVID-19 as pandemic disease and by March 26, 2020, COVID-19 has spread to nearly 199 countries and territories worldwide with more than 462680 cases and approximately 20834 deaths.5 So far, 2019-nCoV is the seventh member of the family of coronaviruses that infects humans. In the last two decades, two epidemic severe human diseases have emerged and they were attributed to two novel coronaviruses, severe acute respiratory syndrome CoV (SARS-CoV) and Middle East respiratory syndrome CoV (MERS-CoV). Respectively; both viruses have infected more than 8000 and 857 cases worldwide with mortality rates around 10% and 35%.5\n",
