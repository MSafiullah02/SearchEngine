Methods: Fifty-seven cases of infection by H1N1 were confirmed by RT-PCR and enrolled. Of these 57 cases, 26 had a severe H1N1 infection (group 1), and 31 had a mild H1N1 infection (group 2). Sera from 18 cases with pneumonia without H1N1 infection (group 3) were used as controls. The serum levels of 10 cytokines were determined by multiplex assay. Results: The serum levels of IFN-a, IL-6, and IP-10 were significantly higher in H1N1 infected cases than in group 3, and levels of IL-6 and IP-10 were significantly higher in group 1 than in group 2. The level of IL-10 was significantly higher in groups 1 and 3 than in group 2. However, levels of IFN-g and IL-17 were not significantly different between the three groups. IL-1b, IL-4, and MIP-1a were not detectable in most patients. IP-10 and IL-6 levels were found to show negative correlations with lymphocyte count and oxygen saturation. Conclusions: We found higher levels of cytokines (IFN-a, IL-6, IP-10) of innate immunity than those of acquired immunity in pediatric H1N1 infection. Of the cytokines found to be increased in cases with H1N1 infection, IP-10 and IL-6 were found to be correlated with disease severity (lymphopenia and hypoxia). IP-10 and IL-6 may be important markers in pediatric H1N1 infection.",

[1] [2] [3] The H1N1 2009 infection presented as a febrile respiratory infection with variable symptoms, ranging from self-limited to severe illness, 1-3 which could have been associated with host immune response. Recently, T helper 1 and T helper 17 hypercytokinemia has been reported in adult H1N1 2009 cases, 4 and a study of pediatric H1N1 2009 infection found that cytokine expressions were significantly different between H1N1 2009 infection with pneumonia and without pneumonia, and between cases of severe and mild pneumonia with H1N1 2009 infection. 5 However, the characteristics of cytokine response caused by H1N1 2009 in the pediatric patients are poorly understood, and it has not been established whether cytokine responses in cases of H1N1 2009 pneumonia differ from those of cases of non-H1N1 2009 pneumonia.",

To determine the etiology of pneumonia infections, mycoplasma pneumonia enzymelinked immunosorbent assays, urinary streptococcal antigen assays (BinaxNow 1 streptococcus pneumonia, Inverness Medical, Scarborough, Maine), and blood cultures were performed. In addition, to identify respiratory virus pathogens, RT-PCR was performed on nasal or throat swabs specimens (RV 12 ACE Detection, Seegene, St. Ingbert, Germany). This RT-PCR testing assay was capable of detecting metapneumovirus, adenovirus, corona virus 229E/NL63, parainfluenza virus 1/2/3, influenza A/B virus, coronavirus OC43/HKU1, rhinovirus A/B, and respiratory syncytial virus A/B. Serum samples for cytokine analysis were obtained at admission (24-48 hr from onset of fever and cough) and stored at \u00c0708C until assayed. Ten cytokines were assayed in serum (interferon (IFN)-a, IFN-g, interleukin (IL)-1b, IL-4, IL-6, IL-10, IL-17, interferoninducible protein-10 (IP-10), macrophage inflammatory protein (MIP)-1a, and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-a) using the multiplex assay with Instrument Luminex 1 200 TM Total System (Luminex Corporation, Austin, TX).",

Our results are in accord with previous adult and pediatric studies. 5, 9, 10 In the present study, we found that IP-10 (also a marker of innate immunity) levels were significantly higher in H1N1 2009 infected patients than in non-H1N1 2009 infected patients. Furthermore, like IL-6, IP-10 levels were also increased, especially in those with severe pneumonia. IP-10 levels were found to be negatively correlated with lymphocyte count and oxygen saturation in H1N1 2009 infected patients. In patients with H1N1 2009 infection, lymphocyte count and oxygen saturation were also found to be negatively correlated with disease severity (Table 1 ). This correlation between IP-10 levels and disease severity may be associated with its pro-inflammatory properties. In adult studies, serum IP-10 levels were found to be elevated in hospitalized H1N1 2009 infected patients, in H1N1 2009 infected patients with mild symptoms, and in critical patients with H1N1 2009 infection. 4,10 Increased IP-10 levels have also been reported for other respiratory viruses, such as, in primary bronchial and tracheal epithelial cells and lung microvascular endothelial cells infected with H5N1. 12 Furthermore, HRV persistence and HRV positive asthma exacerbations have also been reported to be associated with IP-10 gene expression. 13, 14 IL-10 is an anti-inflammatory cytokine with a known immunomodulatory action. In a study of H1N1 2009 infected adults, serum IL-10 was higher in critical and non-critical hospitalized patients than in outpatients with a mild infection. 4 In a pediatric study, although serum IL-10 was no different in H1N1 2009 infected patients with severe pneumonia and those with mild pneumonia, IL-10 levels were significantly higher in H1N1 2009 infected patients with pneumonia than in those without pneumonia. 5 Furthermore, these findings regarding IL-10 concur with our results. Because IL-10 is an anti-inflammatory cytokine with immunomodulatory properties, elevated IL-10 in severe disease may reflect additional efforts to control disease, and thus, IL-10 be might be useful for the treatment of severe disease.",

[15] [16] [17] Although use of corticosteroids in H1N1 2009 infected patients remains controversial, several adult studies have reported that corticosteroid was administered because pro-inflammatory cytokine levels were elevated, and that it significantly reduced inflammatory response. 10, 13, 18, 19 In addition, the use of corticosteroids showed some favorable outcome and no harmful consequences. 16, 17 In the present study, some patients with more severe symptoms and rapid disease progression were treated with adjuvant systemic corticosteroid. Twelve of our 75 patients (6 in group 1, 4 in group 2, and 2 in group 3) received corticosteroids, and all appeared to benefit and achieved a good outcome. We suggest that corticosteroid would decrease proinflammatory cytokine levels (IFN-a, IL-6, and IP-10) in H1N1 2009 infected pediatric patients, and that this would ameliorate severe disease.",
