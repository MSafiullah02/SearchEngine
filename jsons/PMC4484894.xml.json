Despite a similar pulmonary response, this complex syndrome develops as a complication of several acute disease processes, with sepsis being the most common predisposing condition [1, 2]. Damage to the alveolar\u2013capillary membrane results in increased vascular permeability and protein-rich alveolar edema. The clinical diagnosis is made on the basis of a combination of severe hypoxemia requiring mechanical ventilation with high concentrations of oxygen, bilateral pulmonary infiltrates on chest radiographs, and reduced lung compliance [3].",

            "text": "Critical illness is characterized by an increased production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) [4]. Under physiological conditions, oxygen metabolism generates small amounts of ROS, although the cells have several antioxidant mechanisms against oxidative damage. A disruption of oxidant\u2013antioxidant balance is likely to play a role in the pathogenesis of several inflammatory conditions, including sepsis and ARDS [5]. The nuclear factor erythroid 2-like 2, also known as NRF2 or NFE2L2, plays a central role in the antioxidant mechanisms against ROS. NFE2L2 is a member of the Cap\u2019n\u2019Collar basic leucine zipper transcription factor family and constitutes a hub, controlling the expression of several genes involved in regulating cellular antioxidant levels and detoxification [6]. The NFE2L2 gene maps onto chromosome 2 at 2q31. Upon activation by an increase in cellular levels of ROS, NFE2L2 translocates to the nucleus and binds to the antioxidant response element (ARE), inducing the transcription of NFE2L2-regulated genes [6]. In previous positional cloning studies in experimental animals, researchers have identified NFE2L2 as a candidate gene for hyperoxia-induced lung injury susceptibility [7, 8]. These results were validated in humans, in whom common single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were identified by resequencing analysis and candidate SNP functionality was proven in cell lines. In addition, the association of common variants with ARDS susceptibility and mortality has been reported recently [9\u201311].",

We enrolled 322 patients with a diagnosis of severe sepsis [12] and ARDS who were admitted into a multidisciplinary network of post-surgical and ICUs in Spain (see Appendix). All patients were mechanically ventilated. ARDS was defined according to the Berlin criteria [13]. For the purpose of this study, patients with mild, moderate, and severe ARDS were analyzed as a single group of patients with ARDS. Although the selection of controls remains a challenge [14], we preferred to use population-based subjects as controls instead of using patients at risk, because the former minimize the introduction of selection and Berkson bias [15, 16] without sacrificing genotype compliance with Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (HWE) expectations and therefore provide an additional quality control on genotyping. The population-based control group included DNA samples from 900 unrelated adults (control/case ratio of approximately 3) provided by the Spanish national DNA biobank [17]. A health survey was obtained from all control subjects, and none of them had a history of respiratory diseases.",

SNP imputation using data from European individuals from 1KGP phase I (May 2011) [21] was performed using MaCH 1.0 software [24]. Association testing was conducted for allele dosages using Mach2dat [24] for those SNPs showing MAF \u22655 % and squared correlation between imputed and observed genotypes (R2) \u22650.3. The independence of SNP associations was examined with conditional regression analysis using the R statistical software package. To control for type I errors arising from multiple hypothesis testing, a false discovery rate (FDR) was calculated by means of qvalue [25]. A FDR threshold of 0.05 was established to declare significance. Pairwise r2 values were calculated using Haploview 3.32 [26] to assess the linkage disequilibrium (LD) between SNPs based on data deposited for Europeans in the 1KGP database. Evaluation of functionality of associated SNPs was performed with the online software HaploReg v3 [27] on the basis of empirical data from the ENCODE project [28] with the aim of identifying functional elements in the human genome sequence. Specifically, we focused our attention on ENCODE experiments performed on cell lines and tissues obtained from lungs, lung developmental stages, and endothelium.",

In fact, association analyses using regression models accounting for the top hit rendered the remaining SNPs non-significant (Table 4).

Although these SNPs were widely distributed across the gene, all of them showed strong LD with each other. One of the associated SNPs, rs6721961, which showed a minor allele frequency of 11.1 % in this sample, was located in the promoter region of the gene, and its T-allele had been previously linked to a reduction in functionality that limited the NFE2L2 triggering of the antioxidative response [9]. Consistent with those findings, we found that the T allele at rs6721961 conferred greater risk for ARDS susceptibility in patients with sepsis than in healthy subjects. A functional evaluation of the associated SNPs with empirical data from the ENCODE project revealed that seven of them are located in histone marks and/or on DNase I hypersensitivity sites (Table 3). Specifically, the SNP rs6721961 locates in a promoter histone mark in lung fibroblasts and fetal lung. It is also located in a DNase I hypersensitivity site, as reported in an epithelial cell line derived from a lung carcinoma tissue. Given that chromatin modifications on histone marks are critically involved in the regulation of gene expression and that these regions tend to collocate with DNase-sensitive sites in transcriptional start sites [31], this evidence highlights the key role of rs6721961 in the regulation of NFE2L2 expression. Overall, our results highlight the importance of NFE2L2 gene variants in modulating the response to oxidative damage among critically ill patients.",

Generation of ROS has been implicated in the pathogenesis of many acute and chronic pulmonary diseases, including ARDS [32], and it is a common condition among critically ill patients that results in the development of multiple organ system failure [33]. In this respect, researchers in several studies have reported the presence of oxidative damage in patients with sepsis [34, 35]. High levels of protein oxidation have been found, both in plasma and in bronchoalveolar fluids, in early stages of severe sepsis development and during major trauma [36]. NFE2L2 constitutes a hub and a master regulator of detoxifying systems, such as catalase, superoxide dismutase, and glutathione peroxidase, that are critically involved in protecting the cells against oxidative stress [6]. Using experimental animal models where this transcription factor was disrupted allowed the identification of dependent genes that are critical in pulmonary protection and confirmed that its disruption promotes susceptibility to several prooxidant-induced lung diseases, primarily owing to decreased levels of the basal and inducible expression of several antioxidant enzymes [37\u201340].",

Marzec et al. [9] assessed the functionality of the SNP rs6721961 (referred to by those authors at position \u2212617 bp) on the promoter region by means of a reporter gene assay and an electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA). In the reporter gene assay, the luciferase activity for the T allele was less than half of the activity for the G allele, indicating a significant reduction of NFE2L2 gene expression. Congruently, results derived from the EMSA showed that the formation of a protein\u2013DNA complex was significantly diminished in the presence of the T allele, suggesting a less efficient binding of the NFE2L2 transcription factor to the ARE-like sequences of its target genes. In the same study, and consistent with these results, the presence of the T allele at rs6721961 was associated with risk for ARDS susceptibility in a nested case\u2013control association study conducted with 30 patients with trauma-induced ARDS and 60 matched at-risk control subjects. A fixed-effects meta-analysis combining these results with those derived from our study confirmed the concordance of effects at the SNP level, showing an OR for the T allele of 2.18 (95 % CI, 1.35\u20133.50; p = 0.0013). The same SNP was recently found to be associated with 28-day mortality in a nested case\u2013control study that included 224 patients with ARDS from a cohort of 750 patients with systemic inflammatory response syndrome [10]. Also, Cantu et al. [11] found a few NFE2L2 SNPs associated with primary graft dysfunction, a specific form of ARDS developed within 72 hours after lung transplantation. Four of those SNPs (rs10930781, rs1962142, rs2001350, and rs4243387) were also significantly associated with ARDS in our study.",

            "text": "The reliability of association findings can be assessed only by replicating the results in independent samples. Such an effort has been widely recognized as a major gap in the field [14, 43]. In this respect, the present study can be considered a SNP-level replication of previous findings in a large series of patients, although the precipitating injury was severe sepsis instead of trauma. As a result of this, although ancestry adjustments were not implemented, a confounder effect due to the presence of population stratification in this study would be minimal. Besides, we acknowledge some minor limitations. First, although the study sample provided 80 % power to detect a minimum risk of 1.5, we recognize that this sample size is limited to detect smaller effect sizes that are expected on average for complex traits [44]. Second, we assessed only the common variation within the NFE2L2 gene, and they would contribute to an explanation of only a modest fraction of the genetic component of the syndrome. Third, the use of population-based controls instead of at-risk controls precludes deducing whether the NFE2L2 gene is associated with ARDS or with the underlying condition (e.g., severe sepsis). However, whatever the case, the fact that our results replicated previous findings from a study using at-risk controls strongly supports that this gene is directly involved in ARDS susceptibility.",
