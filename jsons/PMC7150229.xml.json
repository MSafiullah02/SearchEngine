Included in the table are the names of the genera belonging to these families and the hosts infected by these viruses. Six of the families are known to contain members that cause epidemics of serious human illness. Diseases caused by these viruses include influenza (Orthomyxoviridae), mumps and measles (Paramyxoviridae), rabies (Rhabdoviridae), encephalitis (several members of the Bunyaviridae), upper and lower respiratory tract disease (numerous viruses in the Paramyxoviridae), and hemorrhagic fever (many viruses belonging to the Bunyaviridae, the Arenaviridae, and the Filoviridae), as well as other diseases. Bornavirus, the sole representative of the Bornaviridae, also infects humans and may cause neurological illness, but proof of causality is lacking. Many of the (\u2212)RNA viruses presently infect virtually the entire human population at some point in time (e.g., respiratory syncytial virus, influenza virus), whereas others did so before the introduction of vaccines against them (e.g., measles virus and mumps virus). These viruses are thus responsible for a very large number of cases of human illness. The diseases caused by such widespread viruses are usually serious but have a low (although not insignificant) fatality rate. In contrast, some (\u2212)RNA viruses, such as rabies and Ebola viruses, cause illnesses with high fatality rates but (fortunately) infect only a small fraction of the human population. The (\u2212)RNA viruses are major causes of human suffering, and all seven families and the viruses that belong to these families will be described here.",

Because this polymerase is necessary for the production of the mRNAs, and because the proteins translated from the mRNAs are required for replication of the genome, the naked genomes of (\u2212)RNA viruses are not infectious, nor are complementary RNA copies of the genomes. It has been possible, nonetheless, to rescue virus from cDNA clones of viral genomes by using special tricks, as described in Chapter 11.",

In (\u2212)RNA viruses with segmented genomes, it is obvious that multiple mRNAs are produced (the number of mRNAs produced actually exceeds the number of segments, as described later). In the Mononegavirales, multiple mRNAs arise from the use of a single polymerase entry site at the 3\u2032 end of the genome. The polymerase then recognizes conserved start and stop signals at the beginning and end of each gene to generate discrete mRNAs. The amount of mRNA produced for any given gene is controlled by the location of the gene relative to the single polymerase entry site, because mRNA synthesis is obligatorily sequential and attenuation occurs at each gene junction. Thus, more mRNA for the proteins encoded 3\u2032 in the genome is made and more protein is thus translated from these genes. The N protein, required for encapsidation of both genome and antigenome, is thereby produced in the largest quantities and the RNA polymerase, needed in the smallest quantities, is made in the smallest quantities. The synthesis of mRNAs is described in more detail in the sections on Rhabdoviridae.",

Multiple products can be produced from the same gene by the use of alternative translation initiation codons during translation of an mRNA; by the introduction of nontemplated nucleotides during mRNA synthesis, which results in a shift in the reading frame; or by splicing of an mRNA. The P genes, in particular, of most of the (\u2212)RNA viruses are translated into multiple products, and two of the segments of influenza virus, which replicates in the nucleus, can be spliced to produce a second mRNA encoding a different product. In no case are the mRNAs exact complements of virion RNAs. This is obvious in the case of the Mononegavirales, where as many as 7\u201310 mRNAs are produced from a single long genomic RNA, but is also true of the segmented (\u2212)RNA viruses, where the mRNAs lack cis-active sequences required for encapsidation and replication that are present near the ends of the antigenome segments.

Neither the genomic (\u2212)RNA nor the antigenomic template produced during replication is ever free in the cytoplasm. Instead, replication of the genome, as well as the synthesis of mRNAs, takes place in nucleocapsids (sometimes referred to as ribonucleoprotein or RNP), which always contain the phosphoprotein and the polymerase as well as N and the viral RNA. Replication can only occur in the presence of ongoing protein synthesis to produce the new proteins required to encapsidate the genome or antigenome. The mRNAs can be synthesized in the absence of viral protein synthesis and lack encapsidation signals, so that they are released into the cytoplasm where they can associate with ribosomes and be translated. Thus, early after infection, mRNAs are synthesized. After translation of the mRNAs, which leads to production of sufficient amounts of viral proteins, a switch to the production of antigenomes for use as templates occurs, followed by production of genomic RNA from the antigenomic templates.",

In other viruses, circles have not been seen but may form transiently during replication. It is possible that these complementary sequences exist to promote cyclization of the RNA, which may be required for replication of the genome or synthesis of mRNAs. It has been shown for influenza A virus that the viral RNA replicase interacts with both ends of the RNA during synthesis of RNA, similar to the story for alphaviruses and flaviviruses described in Chapter 3. Another possible explanation for the complementary sequences is that the promoter at the 3\u2032 end of the genomic RNA that is recognized by the viral RNA synthetase for the production of antigenomes is the same, at least in part, as the promoter at the 3\u2032 end of the antigenomic RNA that is used to initiate the production of genomic RNA. In this event, the sequences at the two ends of the genome or antigenome that encompass these promoters would be complementary.",

            "text": "The VSV nucleocapsid has about 1250 copies of N protein as its major structural component, leading to the conclusion that each N protein interacts with 9 nucleotides of RNA. The nucleocapsid also contains about 470 molecules of P and 50 copies of L. It can synthesize RNA, and P, L, and N are all required for this activity. The organization of the genome and the production of five mRNAs from it are illustrated in Fig. 4.2\n. There is a single polymerase entry site at the 3\u2032 end of the genome, and production ofmRNAs is obligatorily sequential. Synthesis begins at the exact 3\u2032 end of the genome and a leader RNA of 48 nucleotides is first synthesized. The leader is released and synthesis of the first mRNA, that for N, is initiated. The RNA polymerase complex has capping activity, and the mRNA is capped during or shortly after initiation. At the end of the gene for N, the transcriptase reaches a conserved sequence AUACUUUUUUU, where it begins to stutter and produces a poly(A) tract at the 3\u2032 end of the mRNA. The polymerase complex will not terminate or stutter unless the conserved AUAC is present immediately upstream of the U7 tract, and the sequence AUACU7 is therefore a consensus termination-polyadenylation signal. The capped and polyadenylated mRNA for N is terminated and released, the transcriptase skips the next two nucleotides, which are referred to as the intergenic sequence, and initiates synthesis of the second mRNA, that for P, at the conserved gene start signal UUGUC. Following synthesis of this mRNA, the polymerase again stutters at the oligo(U) tract in the AUACU7 signal to produce a poly(A) tract, releases the capped and polyadenylated mRNA, skips the next two nucleotides, and begins synthesis of the third gene, that for M. The process continues in this way through the fourth gene (the G protein) and the fifth gene (the L protein, L for large because it comprises about 60% of the genome). In this way, five capped and polyadenylated mRNAs are produced. In VSV, the intergenic sequence is always two nucleotides. After releasing the L mRNA, the polymerase complex terminates synthesis some 50 nucleotides before the 5\u2032 end of the genome is reached.",

These two downstream AUGs are in frame with one another but in a different reading frame from P. Use of these alternative AUGs leads to the synthesis of short proteins of 55 and 65 amino acids (of which the shorter protein is a truncated version of the longer one).

In the absence of N for encapsidation, the system defaults to synthesis of mRNAs. The M protein also appears to regulate RNA synthesis. In the replication mode, the polymerase complex ignores all of the initiation, termination, and polyadenylation signals utilized to produce mRNAs, and instead produces a perfect complementary copy of the genome. The antigenomic RNA can be copied by the polymerase activity in the (+)RNP to produce more genomic RNA. This also requires that the RNA be immediately encapsidated.

It is a uniformly fatal disease of man and of other mammals, and has been known since the twenty-third century b.c. Rabies virus is present in the saliva of a rabid animal and is transmitted by its bite. Infection begins in tissues surrounding the site of the bite. Without treatment the virus may be transmitted to the brain, where replication of the virus leads to the disease called rabies. It is believed that the virus enters neurons by using acetylcholine receptors as a receptor, followed by transport up the axon until it reaches the cell body. The probability that rabies will develop following the bite of a rabid animal depends on the location of the bite, the species doing the biting, and the virus strain. In the absence of treatment, bites on the face and head result in rabies in 40\u201380% of cases, whereas bites on the legs result in rabies in 0\u201310% of cases. The incubation period to development of symptomatic rabies can vary from less than a week to several years. Once the virus reaches the brain, it spreads from there to a variety of organs. To be transmitted, it must spread to the salivary glands. Infection of neurons in the brain may result in behavioral changes that cause the animal to become belligerent and bite other animals, so that the virus present in salivary fluid is transmitted. In humans, the disease may be paralytic or may result in nonspecific neurological symptoms including anxiety, agitation, and delirium. Biting behavior is not a consequence of rabies-induced neurological disease in humans, and human-to-human transmission does not occur. Two to 7 days after symptoms of rabies appear, coma and death ensue. Only three cases of humans recovering from symptomatic rabies have been recorded.",

In the late 1800s, Pasteur adapted rabies virus to laboratory animals and developed the concept of protective vaccination against rabies. The dessicated spinal cords from rabies-infected rabbits became the first rabies vaccine. On July 6, 1885, this vaccine was used to immunize Joseph Miester, who had been bitten 14 times by a rabid dog. Because of the multiplicity of bites, he would almost surely have died, but the Pasteur vaccine saved him. A vaccine grown in nervous system tissue and inactivated by phenol rather than drying was the accepted rabies vaccine for decades. In the 1960s, a safer inactivated virus vaccine derived from virus grown in cultured human cells was introduced. The rabies vaccine is unique in that it is normally given after exposure to the virus, in conjunction with anti-rabies antiserum. This is possible because there is a window of time following the bite of a rabid animal before rabies develops, during which a protective immune response can be induced. Veterinarians and wildlife workers who are potentially exposed to rabid animals, as well as biologists who work with rabies virus in the laboratory, are immunized prophylatically, but the protective immune response can be of short duration and immunity must be tested at regular intervals.",

Fig. 4.3 also shows the increase in rabies in wild animals since 1940. Fig. 4.4\nillustrates the explosive spread of rabies in raccoons on the eastern seaboard in the last 20 years. The focus of this spread in Virginia arose from the import of 3500 raccoons from Florida into the Washington, D.C., area by members of the cabinet of President Carter, for the purpose of raccoon hunting. These imported animals ignited an epidemic of rabies in raccoons that has slowly spread up and down the Atlantic seaboard, as shown in Fig. 4.4. In other parts of the United States, foxes and skunks are important hosts for rabies and disease also occurs at times in wolves and coyotes. Bats are also an important carrier of rabies. In other parts of the world, where licensing and immunization of pets is not required, domestic dogs continue to be the principal vectors that transmit rabies to humans. Rabies remains a significant global health problem. More than one million people annually undergo antirabies treatment following exposure to the virus, and 50,000 people die of rabies each year.",

Five cases have been documented in which people did not develop symptoms for 7 or more years after infection with the virus. In at least some of these cases, progression to rabies appeared to be triggered by hormonal changes during puberty.

Virions are usually round but pleomorphic (Fig. 2.22C), and filamentous forms are also produced by some viruses that are more common in clinical isolates (Fig. 2.25E). Virions are produced by budding from the plasma membrane (Figs. 2.25E and F). The virion size differs even within a single species and the composition of the virion is not as well defined as for some enveloped viruses. There are two glycoproteins on the surface. One is a fusion protein that is required for the fusion of the viral membrane with the cell plasma membrane. Paramyxoviruses fuse with the plasma membrane, not with endosomal membranes, and fusion does not require exposure to low pH. The fusion protein is produced as a precursor called F0. When first synthesized, F0 has an N-terminal signal sequence that results in its insertion into the endoplasmic reticulum during translation. The signal sequence is removed by signal peptidase and the resulting type 1 integral membrane protein is anchored by a membrane-spanning region near the C terminus. F0 is cleaved either by cellular furin (many paramyxoviruses) or cathepsin L (henipaviruses) within the cell or by other cellular enzymes after release of the virion from the cell, depending on its sequence. Cleavage is required for the virus to be infectious and the cleavage products, F1 (the N-terminal part of the precursor) and F2 (the C-terminal part which is anchored in the membrane), remain covalently linked through a disulfide bond. The fusion domain consists of the N-terminal 20 amino acids of F2, but this domain is not fusogenic until cleavage of F0 has occurred. Those strains whose F0 can be cleaved intracellularly by furin (which recognizes the sequence RXRR or RXKR) or cathep-sin L are able to spread systemically and in general cause serious disease. In contrast, viruses that require cleavage of F0 by proteases after the release of (noninfectious) virions from the cell, usually at a single basic residue by trypsin-like enzymes such as Clara or miniplasmin that are limited in their distribution in the animal, cannot spread systemically and are usually restricted to the respiratory tract.

In paramyxoviruses, the V and C proteins act in different ways to block IFN production or its activity once induced. A potent inducer of IFN production is double-strand RNA (dsRNA), and there are at least two cellular sensors that detect dsRNA and induce the production of IFN (described in more detail in Chapter 10). Intracellular dsRNA can be sensed by a helicase called RIG-1. Through a complicated pathway involving caspase-recruitment domains (CARD), two transcription factors, IRF-3 and NF\u03baB, are activated and transported to the nucleus. These form a complex that leads to the transcription of the mRNA for IFN-\u03b2. An overlapping pathway can start from extracellular dsRNA, which is bound by a cellular receptor called Toll-like receptor 3. The resulting signal cascade results in the production of the same two activated transcription factors. The V proteins of several paramyxoviruses interfere with either activation pathway, preventing the induction of IFN. In addition, the W protein of Nipah virus blocks the activity of IRF-3 in the nucleus. The cysteine-rich C-terminal domains of the V proteins are highly conserved and presumably work in the same way in this pathway.",

IFN-\u03b2 is exported from the cell where it can be bound by Type I IFN receptors at the surface of the same cell or other cells. Once IFN-\u03b2 is bound, the receptor, which consists of two different subunits, heterodimerizes and associated adaptor proteins phosphorylate one another and phosphorylate transcription factors called STAT1 and STAT2. Once phosphorylated, the STATs heterodimerize and are transported to the nucleus where they form part of a transcription complex that transcribes mRNA from hundreds of IFN-responsive genes and the products of these genes establish an antiviral state. The V protein and P protein of Nipah virus cause the STATs to aggregate into large, inactive complexes. The V proteins of several other paramyxoviruses cause STAT1 or STAT2 to be degraded by proteasomes. The W proteins of Nipah virus also blocks the activity of the STATs in the nucleus by causing the proteins to aggregate. The net result of these activities is that the genes responsive to activation by IFN-\u03b2 are not transcribed and IFN activity is aborted (see also Chapter 10).",

The incubation period, that is, the period of time between infection by the virus and the development of symptoms, is about 18 days. During the last 7 days of the incubation period, a person sheds virus and is capable of infecting others. Infection of children is usually not serious, but mumps virus infection can cause serious illness, particularly in adults. Infection begins in the upper respiratory tract but becomes systemic with the virus infecting many organs, where it replicates in epithelial cells. It is best known for infection of the parotid salivary glands leading to painful swelling of these glands. More serious disease can result from the replication of the virus in other organs, however. The central nervous system (CNS) is a common target for the virus and 0.5\u20132.3% cases of mumps encephalitis are fatal. Infection of the pancreas can occur, and it has been suggested that mumps may be associated with sudden onset insulin-dependent diabetes. The heart is sometimes infected, resulting in myocarditis.

Measles also has uncommon neurological complications, including encephalomyelitis and subacute sclerosing panencephalitis (SSPE). In SSPE, the virus sets up a persistent but modified infection in the brain in which M protein is produced in only low amounts; downregulation of production of M protein appears to be necessary to establish the disease syndrome.

Although subhuman primates can be infected by the virus and suffer the same disease as humans, humans are the only reservoir of the virus in nature. Infection requires direct contact with an infected person and recovery from infection results in solid lifelong immunity to the virus. Thus, a minimum size population is required to maintain the virus, in which the continuing birth of new susceptibles occurs at a rate sufficient to maintain continuous virus infection within the community. The requirement for a minimum sized human population to sustain the virus is illustrated in Fig. 4.9\n. In this figure, data from 1949\u20131964 (before tourism became as popular as it is today) are plotted that show the duration of measles epidemics on various islands. In Fig. 4.9A, we see that an island must have a population sufficient to produce about 16,000 surviving newborns a year (population about 500,000) in order to maintain the virus continuously in the population. If the population is smaller, the epidemic burns itself out when all susceptibles have been infected. The island is then free of measles until sufficient new susceptibles have been born and measles is once again introduced into the island from outside. The smaller the population, the longer this takes. Note that Guam and Bermuda, with their heavy tourist influx, had measles present more than expected from the curve because the virus is introduced more often, that is, the island population is not truly isolated. Figure 4.9B illustrates that the more densely packed the population, the more readily the virus spreads and therefore the sooner the epidemic burns itself out. The islands shown in this panel all have about the same population, but when the population is compressed into a smaller area, such as in Tonga, person-to-person spread is more efficient and epidemics do not last as long as when the population is dispersed over a larger area, such as in Iceland.",

This epidemic occurred in young immunized adults as well as in young children who had not been immunized. Some of the cases in young adults were due to vaccine failures (about 5% of humans immunized with a single dose of the measles vaccine fail to develop immunity to measles), but other cases appear to have been due to waning immunity. Thus, immunity induced by the vaccine is probably not lifelong, in contrast to natural infection by wild-type measles virus. The guidelines now call for a second immunization on entry to elementary or middle school. This not only boosts immunity in individuals whose immunity is waning, but also usually leads to immunity in those who did not develop immunity after the first dose. In addition, some colleges require immunization on entry. With these changes, the number of cases of measles in the United States was only 100 in 1998.",

Control has recently been established throughout most of the Americas, but measles remains a serious pathogen in other parts of the developing world. In fact, measles is the leading cause of vaccine preventable deaths in the world. The World Health Organization has initiated a campaign to eradicate measles but the campaign has met a number of stumbling blocks. Because the virus infects only humans in nature, it should be possible to eradicate it using the same techniques that were used for smallpox and that are being used for poliovirus. A major problem with measles, however, has been the inability to effectively immunize young infants against the disease before they become naturally infected by the virus. Newborns are protected from infection for 6\u201312 months by maternal antibodies, and a live vaccine does not take while they are thus protected. In many societies, measles is so pervasive that very shortly after the infant becomes susceptible to infection, infection by wild-type virus occurs, thus keeping wild-type virus in circulation. As described in Chapter 10, attempts to overcome maternal immunity by increasing the dose of the vaccine virus have not led to satisfactory results. New guidelines being developed recommend multiple immunizations against measles in such circumstances, starting at an earlier age, in order to catch the child with the vaccine as soon as it becomes susceptible to the virus.",

In view of the fact that sialic acid was not the measles receptor, the apparent lack of neuraminidase activity in the H protein was not surprising. Recent studies of the morbillivirus H protein have shown that it is related in structure to the HN protein of paramyxoviruses, however, and that the related rinderpest and peste-des-petits-ruminants viruses possess neuraminidase activity. This neuraminidase activity differs in its specificity from that exhibited by the respiroviruses and the orthomyxoviruses, explaining why it had not been observed previously. Presumably this activity is also found in the measles H protein, and the function of this enzyme in the measles life cycle remains to be determined.",

Symptoms can include bronchitis and pharyngitis (itis = inflammation, so inflammation of the mucous membranes of the bronchi or pharynx), rhinorrhea (runny nose), cough, headache, fatigue, and fever. Pneumonia (inflammation of the lungs in which the air sacs become filled with exudate) can result, particularly in infants or the elderly. It is estimated that 17,000 people in the United States die annually from RSV infection, and the great majority of these are people over 65 years old.

Not only did the inoculation with the candidate vaccine fail to protect the children against subsequent infection by RSV, but it was found that when infected the vaccinated group suffered a much higher proportion of serious illnesses such as viral pneumonia than did the control group.

Experimentally infected rats and primates also exhibit behavioral abnormalities. Because of these effects on other animals, several recent studies have tried to determine if the virus is associated with neurological disease in man, in particular with schizophrenia. Serological surveys have found that psychiatric patients are more likely to have antibodies to bornavirus than normal controls. Surveys which assay for the presence of viral RNA in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PMBCs) are even more suggestive: in some surverys up to 66% of psychiatric patients, including schizophrenics, are positive for bornaviral RNA, compared to <5% of normal controls. Furthermore, very small amounts of virus-specific RNA have been isolated from postmortem brain samples from patients suffering from schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, but not from normal individuals or patients suffering from other neurological disorders. Interestingly, a recent study found that two patients hospitalized for severe depression exhibited a rise in bornavirus antigen in PMBCs during the course of the disease, which fell to very low levels on recovery. Whether these different associations are indicative of causality remains to be determined, but it is conceivable that the virus causes recurrent episodes of depression on reactivation of a latent infection.",

It binds to RNAs in the nucleus, including cellular pre-mRNAs, cellular snRNAs which are involved in splicing, and dsRNA. Its activities inhibit the transport of cellular mRNAs from the nucleus and promote the synthesis of influenza mRNA. NS1 also regulates splicing of influenza mRNAs and their transport from the nucleus to the cytosol. Another function of NS1 is to interfere with the interferon pathway(Chapter 10), in part by binding dsRNA, which is a major inducer of interferon and a cofactor for some proteins in the interferon response to viruses, and in part by interacting with cellular proteins involved in the interferon response. Influenza virus lacking NS1 is very sensitive to interferon and is replication defective in cells or hosts capable of synthesizing interferon, whereas the wild-type virus is resistant to the interferon pathway. NS2 is produced from a spliced mRNA. It interacts with M1 attached to influenza RNP and promotes the transport of the RNP to the cytoplasm. It is present in small quantities in the virion and so is not truly nonstructural.",

During transport of HA to the cell surface, the presence of M2 in the membrane of the transport vesicle causes the pH within the vesicle to equilibrate with that in the cytosol. This prevents low pH activation of the fusion activity of HA during transport, because transport vesicles are otherwise acidic. M2 is also present in virions and is required for the disassembly of the virus and for the activation of the RNA polymerase activity. To become active, the polymerase in the interior of the virus must be exposed to low pH. Influenza virus enters the cell in endosomes, which are progressively acidified. The acidic pH not only triggers a conformational change in HA that results in fusion of the viral membrane with the endosomal membrane, but it also activates the RNA polymerase of the virion through the activity of M2. M2 is the target of the drug amantadine, one of the relatively few drugs that are effective against a viral disease. Amantadine binds M2 of most influenza strains and prevents it from acting as an ion channel, which prevents the activation of the polymerase. When taken early during infection, amantidine ameliorates the symptoms of influenza. A worrisome trend is the appearance of amantidine-resistant variants of influenza, in particular the H5N1 strain referred to as \u201cbird flu.\u201d",

The type 1 glycoprotein of influenza A has fusion and receptor-binding (hemagglutinating) activities and is called the hemagglutinin or HA. The precursor is called HA0 and the cleaved products are called HA1 and HA2 (which remain covalently linked by a disulfide bond after cleavage of the peptide bond) (Fig. 1.6). Cleavage is required to activate the fusion activity of the virus and the nature of the cleavage site influences the virulence of the virus. If the cleavage site consists of a single basic amino acid, cleavage is extracellular and influenza replication is restricted to the respiratory tract, and in the case of birds the gut as well, where there are enzymes that can cleave this site. If the cleavage site consists of multiple basic residues that can be recognized by the intracellular enzyme furin, the virus can replicate systemically in at least some hosts. The SV-5 type 1 glycoprotein has only fusion activity and is called F. As described before, it is produced as a precursor F0 which is cleaved to F1 and F2, and the nature of the cleavage site affects the virulence of the virus (see Viral Glycoproteins under Paramyxoviridae earlier in this chapter).",

This makes possible the differential splicing observed for two of the mRNAs. Following infection by the virus, the viral RNPs are transported to the nucleus and mRNA synthesis begins. During synthesis of mRNA, influenza engages in a process called \u201ccap-snatching.\u201d Capped cellular pre-mRNAs present in the nucleus are bound by NS1, and the 5\u2032-terminal 10\u201313 nucleotides, containing the 5\u2032 cap, are removed by PB2. This oligonucleotide is used to prime synthesis of mRNA from the influenza genome segments, as illustrated in Fig. 4.13\n. Once initiated, other aspects of mRNA synthesis resemble those that occur in rhabdo- and paramyxoviruses. Synthesis continues to near the end of the genome segment, where an oligo(U) stretch is encountered. Here the enzyme stutters to produce a poly(A) tail on the messenger and then releases it. In addition to its role as a primer, using a cap derived from cellular mRNA relieves the virus of the necessity of encoding enzymes required for capping and ensures that the virus mRNA has a cap suitable for the cell in which it is replicating. This mechanism also results in interference with the synthesis and transport of host mRNAs. Furthermore, because the mRNAs have a different 5\u2032 end and lack the 3\u2032 end of the antigenomic RNA, they lack promoters required for replication and packaging and are therefore dedicated mRNAs.",

Ducks can excrete virus in feces for weeks, infecting other ducks via contaminated water, and a significant fraction of ducks may become infected by the virus in this process.

Almost no differences in amino acid sequences of the various proteins are present in viruses separated by many de-cades, although the nucleic acid sequences encoding these proteins do drift.

Only three subtypes of HA (H1, H2, and H3) and two or three subtypes of NA (N1, N2, and possibly N8) have been found to date in epidemic strains of human influenza virus. The first influenza virus isolated, in 1933, was called H1N1. This virus first appeared as the cause of the great influenza epidemic of 1918 (see later). The virus isolated in the epidemic of 1957 had a different subtype of both HA and NA and was called H2N2. The H2N2 virus replaced the H1N1 virus as the cause of influenza epidemics (Fig. 4.17\n). The H2N2 virus was itself replaced by H3N2 virus beginning with the epidemic of 1968. Serological surveys suggest that prior to 1918 the virus that circulated was an H3N8 virus that first appeared as the cause of an epidemic in 1890. The reason that only a subset of HAs appear to be capable of causing epidemics in humans is, at least in part, the fact that the receptors for the virus are somewhat different in birds and humans.

NS1 is also at least partially host specific and thus only certain NS1s are compatible with human infection. Other proteins also differ somewhat for optimal replication in birds versus mammals. It is thought that reassortment can result in the introduction of a new HA or NA gene into a human virus, that is, a virus whose other gene segments are optimized for human infection.

Invasion of the damaged lungs by pathogenic bacteria may follow and result in secondary bacterial pneumonia. Influenza can be fatal, usually because of pneumonia resulting from viral infection, whether the pneumonia is due to primary viral infection or, more commonly, due to secondary bacterial infection. Fatal infection is more common in the very young (whose immune system is not fully developed) and in the elderly (whose immune system may be waning). Before the advent of antibiotics, bacterial pneumonia killed many following severe bouts of influenza, but even today influenza remains a serious killer. It has been estimated that influenza virus infects 10\u201320% of the world's population every year causing five million cases of severe illness and 250,000 to 500,000 deaths. In the United States alone the estimated death rate from influenza in an average year is 20,000\u201330,000 and can be significantly higher in epidemic years. People over 65 are at particular risk from influenza. The annual death rate in the United States from influenza A in people over 65 is 1 per 2200, and in an epidemic year the death rate may be 1 in 300 (i.e., 1 of every 300 people over the age of 65 die of influenza during the epidemic). The excess mortality caused by influenza is illustrated in Fig. 4.17, in which the different strains of influenza A or B responsible for the epidemics are indicated. Although influenza A is usually the most serious cause of mortality, in some years influenza B is more of a problem than influenza A.",

The dramatic increase in the death rate in the 20- to 29-year-old group in 1918, in which people of this age were more likely to die than the old and the young, is striking. Death rates in young adults 15\u201334 years of age were more than 20-fold higher in the 1918\u20131919 pandemic than in the preceding years, and the death toll in young adults in the United States was high enough that overall life expectancy dropped sharply, as illustrated in Fig. 4.19\n.",

In fact, 80% of deaths in the U.S. Army during World War I resulted from influenza, and it is thought that the final collapse of the German army in 1918 may have been precipitated by widespread influenza in the troops. The surgeon general of the United States had expressed the hope that WWI would be the first war in which more U.S. soldiers died of war injuries than died of disease, but this hope was shattered by the influenza epidemic.

The pandemic of 1918 occurred before influenza virus could be isolated. However, the sequences of all eight gene segments of the 1918 influenza genes have been obtained starting from a number of tissue isolates. Samples of preserved lung tissue taken at autopsy from two U.S. soldiers who died of influenza in September 1918 in New York and South Carolina were found to contain detectable influenza RNA, albeit in fragmented condition. A third source of influenza RNA came from an Alaskan Inuit victim who died in November 1918 and was buried in permafrost, and whose body was sufficiently well preserved that lung samples containing (fragmented) viral RNA were obtained. Two additional sources of influenza sequences come from two victims of influenza who died of pneumonia in November 1918 and February 1919 at the Royal London Hospital. Reverse transcriptase\u2013polymerase chain reaction technology was used to obtain sequences from influenza RNA in these tissue samples that could be used to reconstruct the complete sequences of genome segments. The sequences from these five victims are almost identical and showed that the virus belonged to strain H1N1. The HA genes from these five humans differ by only one to three nucleotides despite the fact that they came from five humans whose deaths were separated by over 7500 miles and several months in time. The sequence of this gene places it in the human\u2013swine lineage, not in the avian lineage, and at the root of the tree leading to later isolates of human or swine influenza (Fig. 4.20\n). Thus, the HA of the virus does not appear to have come directly from an avian source.",

Various constructs have been tested in mice. Whereas recent isolates of influenza virus cause only mild disease in mice, the 1918 virus causes severe, often fatal disease. In mice, a virus containing only the H1 and N1 of the 1918 virus was found to be highly virulent and caused fatal infection in mice.

The continuing appearance of new strains that arise from antigenic drift and of new subtypes that arise from antigenic shift lead to continuing epidemics. Normally, two or three strains of influenza A circulate in the human population at any one time. Spread from person to person is by respiratory droplets, requiring close proximity, but people travel extensively and new strains of the virus speed around the globe as they arise. Antigenic drift is the process by which mutations accumulate in the virus genome, usually because of immune selection, that result in the development of new strains of the virus. These new strains are partially resistant to the immunity induced by infection with previous strains of virus. After several years of drift, the strain may be sufficiently distinct to cause disease in a person previously infected, but the illness is usually less severe because of partial immunity to the new strain. However, new strains capable of causing serious illness can arise by antigenic shift whereby reassortment results in change of the surface glycoproteins of the virus. The reassortants that cause the biggest problems are those belonging to a new subtype (as illustrated by Fig. 4.17). As described, such a new subtype may cause a pandemic in the human population because there is little immunity to the virus carrying these new surface antigens, as happened in 1918 (H1N1), 1957 (H2N2), and 1968 (H3N2).",

This surveillance also serves to watch for the possible appearance of another killer strain of influenza. An episode that occurred during the Ford administration, however, illustrates the potential difficulties of identifying such a strain and reacting in time. In February of 1976, a young soldier at Fort Dix died of influenza and others became seriously ill. Tests showed that most of the soldiers were suffering from the A/Victoria strain of influenza that was epidemic in the United States at the time or from adenovirus infection. However, the soldier who died and three other soldiers who were ill were infected with an influenza strain that was epidemic in pigs, referred to as swine flu. Serology studies indicated that 200 or more other soldiers had been infected by this virus as well, showing that the virus was being transmitted from person to person. The swine flu virus was closely related to the 1918 pandemic virus, and is thought to have been introduced into pigs in 1918 from humans and to have continued to circulate in pigs after it had died out in humans. Could it be possible that the 1918 virus had reappeared as an epidemic virus in humans? The decision was made by President Ford, in consulation with leading scientists, to begin a crash program to develop a vaccine against swine flu and to begin to immunize the American population. It was thought, with some justification, that to wait for an epidemic to begin before an immunization program was undertaken would mean that it would be too late to be effective, given the speed with which influenza epidemics spread. Further, influenza is usually epidemic in winter, and the early detection of this virus made possible the preparation of a vaccine before the (next) winter flu season set in. Forty million Americans were immunized against swine flu. No epidemic of swine flu developed, however, and litigation began. The pharmaceutical companies had been reluctant to participate in the program, pointing out that at any one time a certain fraction of Americans would develop encephalitis or rheumatoid arthritis or any one of hundreds of other diseases. If disease developed in proximity to receiving a new and relatively untested vaccine, a lawsuit would certainly follow and the potential damages were enormous. The program could only advance when Congress agreed to indemnify the pharmaceutical houses. The vaccine was never conclusively shown to cause disease, although there seemed to be a slight increase of Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome following inoculation. Litigation went on for years and substantial damages were paid out. In retrospect it is easy to criticize the program as an overreaction, but what would have been the reaction if nothing had been done and an influenza epidemic developed that resulted in 50\u2013100 million Americans becoming seriously ill with 1\u20132 million deaths? Given the state of knowledge at the time, many leaders felt there was no choice. Further, the decision to vaccinate was not so different from current policy, where strains of influenza A circulating in the spring are incorporated into a vaccine to be given in the fall. A quote from the U.S. Surgeon General at a meeting of the Association of State and Territorial Health Officiers in 1957 is worth thinking about: \u201cI am sure that what any of us do, we will be criticized either for doing too much or for doing too little.\u201d",

Like influenza viruses, these viruses engage in cap-snatching in order to prime mRNA synthesis. In bunyaviruses, however, the caps are captured from cytoplasmic mRNAs rather than from nuclear pre-mRNAs. The promoter for mRNA synthesis and for RNA replication involves nucleotides located at both ends of the genomic template, which are complementary and form hairpin circles, but with some unpaired nucleotides that are thought to be important recognition signals (Table 4.11\n). Thus, as with many other RNA viruses, the viral RNA polymerase must interact with both ends of the RNA template in order to initiate synthesis, and complementarity between nucleotides at the 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 ends is required for promoter recognition. The terminal complementary sequences are highly conserved within each genus of bunyaviruses but differ between genera (Table 4.11). Perhaps because of this, reassortment occurs only between viruses belonging to the same genus.",

In the genus Orthobunyavirus, the two proteins are translated from a single mRNA using two different start codons in different reading frames. The coding region for NSs is completely contained within that for N. In the phleboviruses and tospoviruses, however, an ambisense coding strategy is used for the two proteins (ambi = both). In this strategy, the two genes encoded in a genomic segment are linked tail to tail so that they are in different polarities, as illustrated in Fig. 4.23\n. The gene for N is present at the 3\u2032 end of the genomic S segment in the minus-sense orientation, and synthesis of the mRNA for N occurs from the genome segment. Expression of this gene occurs early because its mRNA is synthesized from the entering genome by the polymerase activity present in viral nucleocapsids. The gene for NSs is plus sense within the genome, but the genomic RNA does not serve as mRNA. Instead, an mRNA for NSs is synthesized from the antigenomic RNA. Thus, NSs is expressed late because its mRNA can only be made after replication of the incoming genomic RNA to produce the antigenomic RNA. Termination of either mRNA occurs at a secondary structure between the genes for N and NS, which appears to cause the polymerase to fall off and release the mRNA.",

Puumula virus occurs in Western Europe (Fig. 4.25) and causes a disease characterized by acute fever with renal involvement. Seoul virus, first identified in Seoul, Korea, is associated with wild urban rats (Rattus norvegicus) and has been found all over the world because wild urban rats have been inadvertently\nintroduced almost everywhere. It causes a mild form of Korean hemorrhagic fever in Seoul but does not cause apparent illness in most other areas where it has been found. The discovery of Seoul virus led to an intensive study of rats in central Baltimore, where it was found that a high percentage of them were infected with Seoul virus and, furthermore, that a substantial fraction of the people living in the slums of downtown Baltimore showed evidence of infection by hantavirus. No disease is known to be associated with this virus, but statistical studies suggest that infection may lead to high blood pressure and, possibly, renal failure.",

The mRNA for the glycoproteins G1 and G2 is transcribed from the antigenomic copy of S and is therefore expressed late. The glycoproteins are produced as a polyprotein that is cleaved in a process that is similar to what happens in the bunyaviruses. There is an N-terminal signal sequence that leads to the insertion of the precursor called GPC into the endoplasmic reticulum. The signal sequence is removed by cellular signalase. The resulting precursor is cleaved by the cellular subtilase SKI-1/S1P, the same enzyme that processes the hantavirus glycoprotein precursor, into the N-terminal GN (sometimes called G1 or GP-1) and the C-terminal GC (sometimes called G2 or GP-2). GN and GC remain associated as a heterodimer.

The increasing number of cases results from development of the pampas or other areas for farming, bringing humans in closer association with the rodent reservoirs. Furthermore, the storage of grain near human habitation results in an increase in the local rodent population, and plowing of the fields leads to the production of aerosols which may transmit the disease to humans.

The (+)RNA viruses are much more divergent in structure and in the strategies used for replication and expression of the genome, suggesting that they have had a much longer period in which to diverge from one another. Although the suite of proteins encoded is very similar in all (\u2212)RNA viruses, the rate of evolution of RNA viruses is so fast that little sequence identity can be demonstrated between different groups. However, where studies have been performed, evidence for common origin of at least some of these proteins has been shown. As an example, the M proteins of VSV and influenza virus are related and have diverged from a common ancestor. It seems likely that most of the various proteins are related in this way, although it is clear that some viruses have genes that are not represented in all viruses and which presumably arose by recombination events that led to the insertion of new functions, or to deletion events that resulted in a virus with fewer genes, or, probably, to both.",

The (\u2212)RNA viruses with segmented genomes also have the ability to undergo ready reassortment, which is clearly advantageous in the Orthomyxoviridae and probably important for all viruses with segmented genomes.
