In these designated hospitals, nurses receive regular training on up-to-date infection control measures. These expert nurses have also served as important mentors and consultants to the public and other hospitals during the COVID epidemic. The Taiwan Nurses Association has taken an initiative to ask nurses in these designated hospitals to produce videos to educate nurses and the public about infection control measures and about provision of care to infected or suspected patients through on line platforms and social media.",

The two nursing associations jointly urged the organizer to call off the event in order to decrease the spread of virus, and the event was postponed.",

            "text": "Established in February by the Department of Nursing and Health Care, a nurse-led quarantine care call center is being run by more than 500 compassionate nurse volunteers who are currently not practicing or practicing nurses at off time. By merging databases they can collect information on every citizen's 14-day travel history and ask those who visited high-risk areas to self-quarantine. Mobile phones are tracked to ensure people stayed at home. People receive a text warning if they have gone too far from the accommodation and will be fined if they do not return immediately. Using phone tracking to enforce mandatory quarantine is one example of how Taiwan has managed to contain the spread of coronavirus. In addition to the strict measure, it is important to follow up with those people under self-quarantine about their mental and physical health and to provide immediate support or referrals. This is also imperative to ensure people under self-quarantine follow the guidelines and practice appropriate infection control measures to prevent spread of virus. So far, the nurse-led quarantine care call center has reached out to more than 30,000 cases and has identified important issues to be addressed and has made almost 4,000 referrals in order to early diagnose or provide timely management of symptoms.",
