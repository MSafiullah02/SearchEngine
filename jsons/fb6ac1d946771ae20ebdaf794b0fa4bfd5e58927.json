We report the detection and full-genome molecular characterization of a novel bat-associated Circovirus identified in faecal samples of Miniopterus schreibersii bats (Schreiber's bent-winged bats) from Sardinia, Italy. Full-genomic sequencing revealed a new putative member of Circoviridae family, with a genome size of 2063 nt. Sequencing allowed the characterization of the two major ORFs, inversely arranged, encoding replicase and capsid proteins, as well as the finding of a polythymidine tract within the genome, and highlighted phylogenetic relationships of the novel virus. This is the first report of circovirus in European bats. Giving the high level of genetic diversity of bat circoviruses, it is paramount to further investigate the relationships between these viruses and bats.",

Cutaneous, oral swabs, and faecal samples were collected from 46 bats, belonging to 15 different species, from 8 different localities distributed in northern and central Sardinia, and tested for the presence of Coronavirus, Herpesvirus, Poxvirus, Papillomavirus and Circovirus [10] . Captures were performed by experts within a regular census program of Sardinian bat populations, between 2017 and 2018. All international, national and institutional guidelines for the care of sampled animals were followed. Faecal samples were noninvasively collected and stored at \u2212 80 \u00b0C until use. DNA was extracted from faeces using the QiAmp DNA Mini Kit (Qiagen), according to the manufacturer's instructions, and stored at \u2212 20 \u00b0C. A semi-nested PCR based on degenerate primers targeting a conserved Rep sequence in Circoviruses was used to detect and amplify a fragment of about 400 bp of the Rep gene [7, 9] . PCR amplifications were performed in a 50 \u00b5l reaction mix containing 0.2 mM of each dNTPs, 0.2 \u00b5M each of Forward and Reverse primers, 1X TaqBuffer and GoTaq (Promega) DNA polymerase. PCR conditions were: 5 min at 95 \u00b0C followed by 40 cycles of 1 min at 95 \u00b0C, 1 min at 50 \u00b0C (56 \u00b0C in the second PCR), and 1 min at 72 \u00b0C, followed by a final extension time of 10 min at 72 \u00b0C. PCR products were purified using DNA Clean & Concentrator purification kit (Zymo Research), and directly sequenced in both forward and reverse directions by BMR Genomics Sequencing Service (Padova, Italy). Sequences were checked against the GenBank database using nucleotide BLAST (https ://blast .ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast .cgi).",

Reaction profile was: 3 min at 94 \u00b0C, followed by 30 cycles of denaturation at 94 \u00b0C for 1 min, annealing at 55 \u00b0C for 1 min, and extension at 72 \u00b0C for 2 min, with a final extension step at 72 \u00b0C for another 10 min.

The amplicon was purified with the DNA Clean & Concentrator purification kit (Zymo Research), cloned into the pCR4-TOPO Vector (ThermoFisher Scientific), and the sample was sequenced using universal M13 primers by BMR Genomics Sequencing Service (Padova, Italy).

Putative ORFs were predicted using NCBI ORF Finder (https ://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/orffi nder/), and the circular ssDNA genome's map was constructed with PlasMapper version 2.0 (https ://wisha rt.biolo gy.ualbe rta. ca/PlasM apper /index .html). The stem-loop structures were identified using RNAfold web server (https ://rna.tbi.univi e.ac.at/cgi-bin/RNAWe bSuit e/RNAfo ld.cgi). Phylogenetic analyses were performed using the Maximum Likelihood (ML) and Maximum Parsimony (MP) methods implemented in MEGA 6 [12] , after testing the best fitting evolutionary model to the data. Tamura 3-parameter, discrete Gamma distribution (T92 + G), was selected as the best model to analyze data and to infer evolutionary history. A discrete Gamma distribution was used to model evolutionary rate differences among sites. Bootstrap support values and reliability of internal branches were calculated from 1000 replicates and are located at nodes of the tree.",

Predicted ORFs, Rep and Cap (expressing replicase and capsid proteins), were present and inversely arranged, as usual in Circoviruses (Fig. 1) .

Evolutionary analyses were conducted in MEGA6 [12] and bootstrap values are located at nodes of the tree values. Interestingly, the branch including the BatACV described in this study also appears not phylogenetically distant to porcine CVs (Porcine Circovirus 1 and 2, Fig. 2 ). On the other hand, bat-associated CVs described in Brazilian bats [5] appear the most distantly related circoviruses.",

            "text": "This is the first report of BatACV in Europe, as well as the first identification of these circular ssDNA viruses in European M. schreibersii bat populations (Schreiber's bent-winged bats). This bat species, listed as Near Threatened by IUCN Red List (https ://www.iucnr edlis t.org/), is found in southern Europe and in Sardinia, typically inhabiting caves and forested habitats, but can also be found in farm environment. Full-genome sequence comparison and phylogenetic analyses clarified the evolutionary relationships of this novel virus within the Circoviridae family, clustering with other previously identified bat-associated circoviruses. Interestingly, a 58 nt polythymidine (poly-T) tract was identified in the 3\u2032 IGR of Sardinian BatACV, which was previously only found, with different nt numbers, in BatACVs from Heilongjiang province, China [7] . These authors tested and showed that poly-T tract did not play any particular role in viral replication, however, the presence of this feature might have implications in the genome posttranscriptional processes, and further research may highlight these mechanisms. As previously discussed [7] , it is likely that many CVs or similar circular DNA viruses are circulating in various bat species, and novel viruses thus remain to be identified. BatACVs show an average high level of genetic diversity, as well as a wide distribution. Although it is not known whether BatACVs are associated with disease, however, they are found in a broad bat host range and, as previous works and the present study support, with a wide geographic distribution, spanning from Asia to Europe to South America. Further studies should aim to investigate the possible role of bats in the transmission of circoviruses to other animal species, including porcine or avian hosts, and highlight potential zoonoses risks. Giving the high diversity of bat circoviruses and the high variability and mutation rate of ssDNA circular genomes, it is paramount to further investigate the relationships between CVs and bats, and their relevance in pathogenesis. Future surveillance of BatACVs in Sardinian bat populations should be intensified, as M. schreibersii bats share habitat and caves with many other species (such as Myotis and Rhinolophus spp.), and as cross-species transmission also to terrestrial mammals has been reported [13] .",
