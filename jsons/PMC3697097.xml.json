The serine proteases constitute one of the largest families of proteolytic enzymes and are well recognized for their pivotal roles in physiological processes as diverse as development, digestion, coagulation, inflammation, and immunity. These enzymes share a common catalytic mechanism for selective cleavage of specific substrates and are frequently involved in consecutive proteolytic reactions or protease cascades, where one protease precursor or zymogen is the substrate for an active protease. This shared mechanism confers the advantage that a single signal may be specifically and irreversibly amplified every time a downstream zymogen is activated, providing the capacity for unleashing a burst of proteolytic potential.",

Nineteen human TTSPs have been identified and may be categorized into four subfamilies: Hepsin/TMPRSS, Matriptase, HAT/DESC, and Corin3, 4 (Fig. 1). Mammalian orthologs, as well as different isoforms between humans and rodents, exist for many if not all of the TTSPs.4, 5, 6 There also exist two nonmammalian TTSPs, Drosophila stubble-stubbloid (st-sb)7 and corin.8\n",

There is also growing evidence for their participation in the pathogenesis of inflammatory and neoplastic diseases. Endogenous protein substrates targeted by membrane-anchored serine proteases include peptide hormones, growth and differentiation factors, receptors, enzymes, adhesion molecules, and viral coat proteins.16 A number of insights into our understanding of the unique physiological functions of the membrane-anchored serine proteases and their involvement in human pathology have come from a combination of biochemical analyses, animal models, and human patient studies. However, our current understanding of the impact of the membrane-anchored serine proteases on many biological, physiological, and pathological processes is far from complete. This chapter provides a historical perspective on the discovery of these enzymes, current knowledge of their activities and their regulation, and the functional consequences of the activities of these proteases in mammalian physiology and disease. For the interested reader, several other reviews have focused on different aspects of their nomenclature, classifications into subgroups, gene structure and chromosomal localization, tissue- and cell-specific distribution, and biochemical properties.1, 2, 3, 4, 16, 17\n",

While the geometric orientations of these amino acid residues are similar, the protein folds are variable, which contribute to their selective substrate specificities. The catalytic reaction follows a two-step mechanism for hydrolysis of substrates in which a covalently linked enzyme-peptide intermediate is formed, with the loss of a peptide fragment.18 This acylation step is followed by a deacylation step which occurs by a nucleophilic attack on the intermediate by water, resulting in hydrolysis of the peptide.",

In addition to the LDLRA domains, there are Group A scavenger receptor (SR) domains, frizzled domains, Cls/Clr, urchin embryonic growth factor and bone morphogenic protein 1 (CUB) domains, sea urchin sperm protein, enterokinase, agrin (SEA) domains, and meprin, A5 antigen, and receptor protein phosphatase \u03bc (MAM) domains.

Similarly, the GPI-anchored serine proteases are found to associate with lipid raft microdomains at cell surfaces, but do not require these anchors for catalytic activity. Loss of membrane polarity, such as that in tumors, has been associated with redistribution and/or mislocalization of several of the membrane-anchored serine proteases.50, 51 In this regard, the significance of cell membrane association for the membrane-anchored serine proteases differs from that for blood-clotting proteases.",

The catalytic activities of the membrane-anchored serine proteases are regulated by endogenous protease inhibitors, specifically the Kunitz-type transmembrane serine protease inhibitors, hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) activator inhibitor (HAI)-1/SPINT1 and HAI-2/SPINT2, and several of the serine protease inhibitor family known as serpins. Kunitz-type inhibitors are a class of serine protease inhibitors present in all metazoa, whose prototype is the bovine pancreatic trypsin inhibitor (BPTI). They are competitive inhibitors acting in a substrate-like manner and form very stable complexes of 1:1 stoichiometry with their target enzymes, inhibiting their activity.52 Matriptase,53, 54, 55, 56 hepsin,57 and prostasin31, 48, 57, 58 are regulated by the Kunitz inhibitors, HAI-1 and/or HAI-2.",

Such an activation mechanism, which occurs outside of the pancreas, is important to prevent autoactivation of pancreatic proteases, thereby avoiding harmful tissue damage.

More kinetic studies were done by Moses Kunitz at the Rockefeller Institute for Medical Research in Princeton, New Jersey, demonstrating enzymatic conversion of crystalline trypsinogen to trypsin using purified porcine enteropeptidase.68, 69 By the 1970s, more advanced methods were used to purify enteropeptidase from porcine, bovine, and human intestinal mucosa.70, 71 The protein was found to have a heavy chain of approximately 120 kDa and a light chain of approximately 35 kDa connected by a disulfide bond.

In transfected cells, enteropeptidase was expressed as a single-chain molecule and no autoactivation was observed, indicating that other proteases are required to activate enteropeptidase.80 Trypsin activates enteropeptidase efficiently, suggesting a possible mechanism of reciprocal activation between enteropeptidase and trypsin.66 For such an activation cycle to start, however, at least a fraction of enteropeptidase needs to be activated before trypsinogen enters the gut. Zamolodchikova et al. identified a novel serine protease, duodenase, from bovine duodenal mucosa.83 The enzyme, which is approximately 30 kDa and consists of 226 amino acids, is expressed in the secretory epithelial cells of Brunner's glands in the proximal segment of the duodenum.84 Duodenase has a preferred cleavage sequence with Lys at P1 and Pro at P2. It activated recombinant enteropeptidase, although the rate of the activation was approximately 100 times slower than that of trypsin.85 It remains to be firmly established whether duodenase is a physiological enteropeptidase activator. More recently, other proteases have been shown to modulate enteropeptidase activity. For example, beta-site APP-cleaving enzyme1 (BACE1) was detected in pancreatic islets and shown to inactivate enteropeptidase by cleavage of its light chain.86 This inactivation may represent a defense mechanism to inhibit enteropeptidase that enters the pancreatic duct accidentally, thereby preventing trypsinogen activation in the pancreas.",

Substitution of Lys99 with Ala by mutagenesis prevented enteropeptidase from activating trypsinogen.

These proteins include blood clotting factors VII, IX, and XII; pro-urokinase; pro-HGF; liver microsomal glutathione transferase; matriptase; prostasin; epidermal growth factor receptor; and laminin. It is unknown how many of them are hepsin substrates in vivo. Studies have suggested that hepsin may play a role in blood coagulation, hepatocyte proliferation/growth, and embryonic development.43, 100, 101 Such functions, however, have not been validated in vivo, as hepsin null mice are fertile, grow normally, and exhibit no spontaneous bleeding.102, 103 Unexpectedly, however, hepsin appears to be important in normal hearing. Guipponi et al. detected hepsin mRNA expression in the inner ear.104 Hepsin null mice have been found to have abnormal cochlea, reduced myelin protein expression in the auditory nerve, and severely impaired hearing. The biochemical basis for hepsin function in cochlear development has not been determined. Apparently, hepsin null mice have low levels of plasma thyroxine, a hormone important for cochlear development.104 It is unknown whether impaired hearing in hepsin null mice is a result of thyroid hormone deficiency.",

Microarray studies detected high levels of hepsin mRNA in human prostate cancers.105, 106, 107, 108 Elevated hepsin mRNA expression appears to correlate with the disease severity. Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in or near the human HPN gene are associated with prostate cancer susceptibility and tumor aggressiveness.109 In functional studies, Xuan et al. showed that antibodies neutralizing hepsin protease activity did not block prostate or ovarian cancer cell growth in culture but inhibited their invasion in a Matrigel basement membrane.110 In other studies, however, prostate or other cancer cell lines stably transfected with hepsin cDNA were less invasive in culture or nude mice. Because stably transfected cells often undergo phenotypic changes during selection, it is difficult to determine whether observed differences were related to different levels of hepsin expression. To circumvent this problem, Klezovitch et al. created transgenic mice with high levels of hepsin in prostate epithelium, mimicking hepsin overexpression in prostate cancer patients.111 The results show that hepsin overexpression did not affect cell proliferation but altered basement membrane structures in prostates in these mice. When the mice were crossed with a nonmetastasizing prostate cancer model, prostate cancer cells became more invasive, causing metastasis in the liver, lung, and bone. Thus, hepsin promotes prostate cancer progression and metastasis in vivo, suggesting that hepsin inhibitors may be developed to treat prostate cancer in patients.",

As a result, the androgen-responsive promoter elements of TMPRSS2 drive the expression of the ETS family transcription factors to promote prostate cancer progression and invasion. Among these chromosomal rearrangements, TMPRSS2\u2013ERG gene fusions are most frequent, accounting for approximately 50% of prostate cancers. Molecular studies show that abnormal ERG expression disrupts normal androgen receptor signaling and activates epigenetic programs, thereby inducing tumorigenesis.123 Although ERG enhances the expression of many proteases, including urokinase-type plasminogen activator (uPA), matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-3, and MMP9, TMPRSS2 protease activity is unlikely to have a direct role in ERG downstream events, because the TMPRSS2 protease domain coding sequence is never included in the fusion genes.124 Studies have shown that in prostate cancers, ETS transcription factor genes are also fused to other genes that contain androgen-responsive elements.125 These rearrangements have been attributed recently to androgen-induced co-recruitment of the DNA-processing enzyme topoisomerase 2B to sites of genomic breakpoints.126\n",

The recombinant human MSPL migrated at approximately 60 kDa and prefers synthetic peptide substrates with Arg at the P1 position. MSPL activity is inhibited by aprotinin, benzamidine, and soybean trypsin inhibitor.34 The physiological functions of MSPL remain unknown. Similar to other TTSPs, MSPL was recently shown to induce avian influenza virus replication by activating the viral hemagglutinin, suggesting a potential role in human airway viral infections.144\n",

Proteolytic autoactivation of matriptase appears to be controlled by the stem region, posttranslational modifications, and the cellular localization of the protease44; however, the specific mechanisms that trigger the activation of matriptase are incompletely understood.154 The inhibition of activated matriptase by HAI-1 was first documented by the identification of matriptase/HAI-1 complexes in human milk, in conditioned medium of cultured mammary epithelial cells, and in a number of cancer cell lines.50\n",

Follicular structures are also affected by matriptase loss, as shown by the absence of whiskers and generalized hypoplasia of pelage hair follicles of null mice. These phenotypes were linked to defects in the initiation of caspase-14-calpain I, bleomycin hydrolase-mediated processing of the epidermal polyprotein, profilaggrin, into filaggrin monomer units and subsequently, into free hygroscopic amino acids, which partake in the formation of the cornified envelope of the uppermost layers of the epidermis and serve as a source of water binding free amino acids that contribute to skin hydration.160 Matriptase-deficient epidermis also exhibits a defect in the formation of lamellar granules, specialized secretory vesicles that contain lipid material required for the formation of extracellular lipid lamellae within the cornified layer, and display impaired formation of epidermal tight junctions within the granular layer.158, 161\n",

Matriptase was demonstrated to initiate activation of proinflammatory pro-kallikrein-related peptidases that are associated with stratum corneum detachment. Moreover, ablation of matriptase from LEKTI-deficient mice dampened inflammation, eliminated aberrant protease activity, prevented detachment of the stratum corneum, and improved the barrier function of the epidermis, demonstrating that the runaway kallikrein proteolytic cascade associated with LEKTI-deficiency was dependent on matriptase activity.",

The subsequent generation of viable matriptase hypomorphic mice167 and matriptase conditional knockout mice161 afforded the opportunity to explore the function of matriptase in global epithelial biology. Tissue-specific embryonic and postnatal ablation of matriptase from a variety of epithelial tissues, including orofacial epithelium, salivary gland epithelium, lacrimal gland epithelium, and the epithelium of stomach, and small and large intestine, in all cases were associated with severe epithelial dysfunction, with two distinct phenotypes emerging: (a) loss of epithelial function, such as barrier and secretory capacity, but preservation of epithelial anatomy (salivary glands, tear glands, stomach, small intestine) and (b) loss of epithelial function, followed by loss of anatomical integrity (skin, orofacial, and colonic epithelium). In all epithelia, the absence of matriptase uniformly was associated with the rapid loss of epithelial tight junction function, compatible with the localization of matriptase on the lateral membrane of polarized epithelial cells.161, 169 In polarized monolayers of epithelial cells cultured ex vivo, downregulation of matriptase decreased transepithelial electrical resistance and increased paracellular diffusion of macromolecules. Decreased matriptase was associated with enhanced expression and incorporation of the permeability-associated, \u201cleaky\u201d tight junction protein, claudin-2, at intercellular junctions, suggesting that the reduced barrier integrity was caused, at least in part, by an inability to regulate claudin-2 expression and incorporation into tight junctions.169\n",

HAI-2 inhibition of matriptase, however, is essential at three distinct developmental processes: (a) early (< E8.5) embryonic development, which proceeds normally in HAI-2 null embryos in the absence, but not in the presence of matriptase; (b) placental development, where the failure of the placental labyrinth to undergo branching morphogenesis in HAI-2 null embryos can be prevented by loss of matriptase; and (c) neural tube closure, in which the development of exencephaly and spina bifida is partially rescued by the matriptase deficiency.155 The functional interactions between matriptase, HAI-1, and HAI-2 during development appear to be uniquely complex for a protease\u2013protease inhibitor system. Thus, not only the complete loss of HAI-1 or HAI-2 but also the combined haploinsufficiency for both inhibitors causes embryonic lethality (nonallelic noncomplementation), which can be prevented by haploinsufficiency for matriptase, suggesting that the two inhibitors functionally cooperate in regulating the activity of matriptase.155\n",

            "text": "Matriptase has received significant attention in the field of cancer biology due to its remarkably consistent expression in tumors of epithelial origin. Following the first description of matriptase as a major gelatinolytic activity in breast carcinoma,145, 178 the protease was reported to be expressed in a wide variety of other benign and malignant tumors of epithelial origin, including prostate, ovarian, cervical, gastric, colon, renal cell, esophageal, oral squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), and malignant pleural mesothelioma (reviewed in Ref. 179). In most carcinomas, malignant progression is associated with a significant increase in matriptase mRNA or protein expression. For example, in ductal mammary carcinoma, elevated levels of matriptase correlate with both tumor and nodal staging.180 A clinical study in node-negative breast cancer patients showed a tight correlation between the expression of matriptase, cMet, and HAI-1, and poor patient outcome.181 Likewise, more than fivefold overexpression of matriptase was detected in a study of ovarian cancer, compared to normal ovarian tissues, and this increased expression of matriptase correlated with tumor aggressiveness.182, 183 Furthermore, although matriptase was more frequently expressed in stage I/II tumors than in more advanced-stage III/IV tumors, an increased matriptase/HAI-1 ratio was indicative of the poor clinical outcome of advanced-stage tumors, suggesting that loss of protease inhibition may play a role in the late stages of the disease.184 In prostate and cervical carcinoma, a several-fold increase in matriptase expression was reported for malignant versus nonmalignant tissues, and this correlated with Gleason score and histopathological grade, respectively, of the tumors.185, 186 Other common human cancers with significantly elevated matriptase levels include carcinomas of the pancreas, lung, kidney, and liver.179 In contrast, significant downregulation of matriptase and HAI-1 has been detected in the samples of gastric and colorectal carcinoma.172 However, an analysis of the clinicopathological parameters in colorectal adenoma and carcinoma tumors showed an increased matriptase/HAI-1 ratio in the tumors compared to the corresponding tissue from control individuals.187 This finding may suggest that in tissues of the gastrointestinal tract, which exhibit high expression of matriptase and HAI-1,152, 188, 189 the tumorigenic process does not involve further elevation in the expression of the two proteins, but rather may be associated with altered levels of an HAI-1-free, uninhibited form of matriptase. SCC of the skin represents a second example of matriptase being dysregulated, not by overexpression, but rather by the translocation of the expression of the protease from a differentiated postmitotic compartment in the epidermis to a basal compartment with high tumorigenic potential.148\n",

Both the epidermal hyperproliferation and the formation of matriptase-induced skin tumors are completely abolished by coexpression of HAI-1, demonstrating that the proteolytic activity of matriptase is critical to its oncogenic potential.

Both mice and humans with matriptase-2 deficiency suffer from very low iron levels and severe microcytic anemia.197, 198, 199 Matriptase-2 expressed by liver cells functions as a suppressor of the hepatic hormone, hepcidin, which in turn internalizes the iron export protein, ferroportin, on enterocytes and macrophages to reduce iron uptake. Thus, matriptase-2 is a key regulator of systemic iron hemostasis. Hepcidin suppression by matriptase-2 appears to occur at the transcriptional level, as hepcidin mRNA levels are elevated in both matriptase-2-deficient humans and mice.197, 198, 199 This suppression of hepcidin gene transcription has been linked to matriptase-2-mediated degradation of hemojuvelin, a cofactor for bone morphogenetic protein, and a key regulator of hepcidin gene activation.200, 201\n",

The pattern of expression of matriptase-3 is conserved in mice and humans, with the highest levels of mRNA expression in the brain, skin, eye, salivary gland, and the reproductive tissues, including prostate, testis, epididymis, ovary, and uterus. The recombinant matriptase-3 catalytic domain can hydrolyse synthetic peptide substrates with a strong preference for arginine in the P1 position, and shows proteolytic activity toward several macromolecular substrates, including gelatin, casein, and albumin.202 The activated matriptase-3 catalytic domain forms stable inhibitor complexes with an array of serpins, including PAI-1, PCI, \u03b11-proteinase inhibitor, \u03b12-antiplasmin, and antithrombin III in vitro. Matriptase-3 loss of function studies in animals or humans with matriptase-3 deficiency has not been reported, and the physiological function of the protease remains to be determined.4\n",

This activation mechanism was recognized for many years, but the responsible enzyme remained unidentified. In cell-based studies, corin activated pro-ANP in a sequence-specific manner.215 This activity was confirmed in cardiomyocytes and with purified recombinant corin. Chan et al. made corin null mice, which were viable and fertile.216 In these mice, lack of corin prevents pro-ANP processing in the heart and causes salt-sensitive hypertension. Corin null mice develop cardiac hypertrophy and exhibit impaired cardiac function. This hypertrophic heart phenotype has been confirmed in a naturally occurring mutant mouse strain, Kit\nW-sh, in which the corin gene is disrupted by genetic inversion.217 These data show that corin-mediated pro-ANP processing is critical for regulating blood pressure and cardiac function (Fig. 3\n). Curiously, corin null mice appear to have a lighter coat color, and this phenotype depends on the agouti gene.218 As corin mRNA and protein are expressed in the dermal papilla in mice, corin may act in the skin to regulate hair color formation by an agouti pathway-dependent mechanism.",

Dries et al. have identified two SNPs (T555I/Q568P) in the human CORIN gene.221 These SNPs are located on a minor corin gene allele that is present primarily in African-Americans with hypertension. It is known that African-Americans have a high prevalence of cardiovascular disease, but the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. Rame et al. have shown that individuals with these corin SNPs have an enhanced cardiac response to high blood pressure, which leads to severe left ventricular hypertrophy.222 Under pathological conditions, cardiac hypertrophy impairs heart functions. In patients with heart failure, the presence of this corin variant allele is associated with worse clinical outcomes such as hospitalization and death.223 Changes in the amino acids, T555I/Q568P, encoded by the SNPs occur within the second frizzled-like domain, an extracellular region demonstrated to be functionally important.46 Examination of the effect of these amino acid substitutions on corin function in cell-based studies showed that the corin variant, T555I/Q568P, exhibited markedly reduced activity in processing pro-ANP and pro-BNP.224 Apparently, the reduced activity was caused by impaired corin zymogen activation but not cell surface expression.224 The data indicate that these polymorphisms alter corin structure and function, which may contribute to elevated blood pressure and cardiac hypertrophy in patients. Thus, corin defects may present an important mechanism underlying cardiovascular disease.",

Prostasin was found to have a substrate preference for polybasic substrates: in position P4, preference was for arginine or lysine; in P3, for histidine, lysine, or arginine; in P2, for basic or large hydrophobic amino acids; and in P1, for arginine and lysine.32 Prostasin showed no activity with substrates containing isoleucine in position P1\u2032, providing an explanation for the inability of prostasin to autoactivate. Prostasin activity was also highly influenced by mono- and divalent metal ions, which were potent inhibitors and substrate specific modulators of enzymatic activity. Interestingly, structural analyses showed that the S1 subsite loop of prostasin exhibits a large degree of conformational variation and directly binds the divalent cation, Ca2+, being able to move to block or to expose the S1 subsite.24\n",

In the lung, adequate levels of ENaC activity are essential for controlling airway surface liquid volumes. Mice with targeted disruption of the prostasin gene in lung epithelium show impaired ENaC-mediated alveolar fluid clearance.263 In addition, increased ENaC activation in the airway of cystic fibrosis patients has been linked to excessive prostasin activity on the surface of lung epithelium.264, 265 Prostasin has been identified as a candidate gene for the development of hypertension in youths,266 which may also be associated with increased ENaC activation.267 Increased levels of urinary prostasin are found in hypertensive patients,252 and inhibition of prostasin in a rat model of hypertension significantly reduced blood pressure.268 Inhibition of prostasin-dependent activation of ENaCs is considered a potential therapeutic strategy for modulating surface liquid volume in cystic fibrosis and salt-sensitive hypertension.",

Testisin is detected on spermatogenic cells throughout spermatogenesis and on mature sperm in humans,276 mice,14, 247, 276 and rats,279 which suggests a similar function among these mammalian species. Mice deficient in testisin display several functional abnormalities associated with epididymal sperm maturation and fertilizing ability.276, 280 Epididymal sperm lacking testisin show an increased tendency toward decapitation, heterogeneity in sperm form and angulated flagella, decreased numbers of motile sperm, and abnormal sperm volume regulation. Although testisin-deficient mice exhibit normal fertility when bred by continuous mating, these functional sperm defects result in a decreased ability to fertilize oocytes in short-term mating studies.276 The data suggest an essential requirement for testisin during sperm cell maturation processes which occur during epididymal transit and are required for normal fertilizing ability. Functional overlap between testisin and the related fertilization serine protease, acrosin, may compensate for respective functional fertilizing abilities, since acrosin-deficient mice exhibit normal fertility, but acrosin/testisin double knockout mice are subfertile.281 It has been proposed that aberrant regulation of testisin may contribute to certain secondary male infertility syndromes such as \u201ceasily decapitated\u201d spermatozoa in humans.276\n",

The associations of mutant alleles of the membrane-anchored serine proteases with disease, the misregulation of these enzymes in malignant growth, and the hijacking of their activities by viruses to facilitate infection and propagation, all highlight the pathological impact of misregulation of their activities. Despite remarkable progress in the past few years, many questions remain unanswered. How these proteases intersect and modulate the protease cascades in the pericellular microenvironment, the signals that trigger their activation, the repertoire of endogenous substrates, and the inhibitors that modulate their activities, are important issues to address. As suitable molecular tools, such as antibodies, activity-based probes, animal models, and human mutational analyses, are refined and developed, we will look forward to gaining a better understanding of the critical roles of these enzymes both in mammalian physiology and in disease.",

Matriptase activation, triggered by unknown mechanisms in skin, activates the GPI-anchored prostasin zymogen. Prostasin activation is required for epidermal tight junction formation, epidermal lipid synthesis, and induction of caspase-14-calpain I, and bleomysin hydrolase-mediated processing of the epidermal polyprotein, profilaggrin, into filaggrin monomer units, and subsequently, into free hygroscopic amino acids, which participate in the formation of the cornified envelope and contribute to skin hydration. Matriptase deficiency is linked to a rare form of skin disease, referred to as autosomal recessive ichthyosis with hypotrichosis (ARIH), or ichthyosis, follicular atrophoderma, and hypotrichosis (IFAH). Matriptase is also capable of activating proinflammatory pro-kallikrein-related peptidases that are associated with stratum corneum detachment and are responsible for the runaway kallikrein proteolytic cascade associated with LEKTI-deficiency/Netherton syndrome. HAI-1 regulates matriptase in the epidermis.",
