The World Health Organization has outlined obesity as \u201ca world epidemic disease\u201d [1]. Childhood obesity is related to multiple serious health problems and an enhanced risk of premature onset of diseases, including diabetes and heart disease [2]. Skeletal maturity is used to measure the development depending on bone size, shape, and degree of its mineralization to determine its closeness to full maturation [3]. In general, females have advanced bone age compared to boys. The distinction is present at birth and persists along the growth period; however, it is more noticeable after the beginning of puberty [4].",

Therefore, the most ordinarily utilized in clinical practice are the atlas-based technique of Greulich and Pyle. The radiographs are performed in chronologic steps up to 19 years in boys and 18 years in girls. The simplicity and speed with which a skeletal age can be assigned have created this atlas the foremost ordinarily used customary used of reference for skeletal maturation worldwide [3]. Bone age (BA) is compared with the chronological age (CA). A distinction between these two values indicates abnormalities in skeletal development. It is usually utilized in the diagnosis and management of endocrine disorders, and it may serve as a sign of the therapeutic result of treatment [4].",

The sole body measurement that directly calculates the relative composition of the body and presents a measure of fitness level, regardless of the height or weight, is body fat percentage (BF%). Wide application of body mass index (BMI) affords a measure that permits a comparison with the overweight subjects of various heights and weights [6]. The level of body fat can affect the neuroendocrine events that are responsible for the onset of premature puberty, despite low levels of the growth hormone. More specific, leptin is the key hormone concerned in this method [7]. Knowledge of skeletal development is important as the patient\u2019s response to the treatment will be more effective if skeletal development has not yet reached its end. Moreover, dentofacial and orthopedic treatment performed after the growth phase is not effective in improving skeletal discrepancies. So it is important to assess skeletal maturity in growing patients to determine the best timing for orthopedic and orthodontic treatment around the growth spurt [8].",

Two-tailed P values of less than 0.05 were considered to be significant. The Pearson correlation coefficient (r) was used to express the relationship between quantitative variables in the case and control group. Mann-Whitney test was used to express the relation between laboratory results between case and control. Multivariable regression analysis was used to examine the relation between skeletal maturation; bone age and other variables, as adjusted for the possible confounding effect of variables expected to influence the outcome of interest.",
