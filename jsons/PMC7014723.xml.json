A mean score was calculated by hand across studies for each subscale, by totaling the raw scores and dividing by the total number of studies that included a raw score for that subscale. The resulting mean was also categorized as low, moderate, or high burnout based on published cutoff scores [22]. Other data were synthesized qualitatively to map current evidence available to address the remaining study aims. Aims ii and iii were analyzed using directed content analysis [23] following the themes outlined by Berta et al. [24], work environment, work attitudes, and work outcomes. Aim iv data was synthesized by grouping together similar interventions and descriptively summarizing the interventions that were effective in reducing burnout. Given that the overall purpose of the review was to explore the breadth of what is currently known about burnout in pediatric nurses, a quality assessment of individual studies was not conducted [18].",

After deduplication, 8629 titles/abstracts were screened and 1206 articles were assessed for eligibility at the level of full-text screening. After applying the inclusion and exclusion criteria, a total of 78 studies [16, 25\u2013101] were deemed relevant and retained for analysis (Fig. 1). The characteristics of included studies are provided in Table 1. Publication dates ranged from 1981 to 2018, with the majority published between 2009 and 2017. The number of pediatric nurses who participated as either a primary or sub-sample ranged from five to 3710. The most common study design was cross-sectional (n = 60), with 10 studies using multi- or mixed methods, seven using an interventional design, and one each using case-control, exploratory prospective, and longitudinal designs. Only 45 of the 78 studies reviewed used exclusive samples of pediatric nurses; the remaining studies only included pediatric nurses as a subpopulation of a larger sample. The results in this review are reported for pediatric nurse samples and sub-samples only. Almost half (46%) of the included studies were conducted in the USA, followed by Canada (n = 7), China (n = 5), Turkey (n = 3), Brazil (n = 3), Taiwan (n = 2), Australia (n = 2), and Switzerland (n = 2), plus 18 other countries where only a study was conducted. Out of the 78 studies included, 53 (68%) used some form (either complete or abbreviated) of the MBI to measure burnout (see Table 1).\n\n",

A lack of university-level education or lower self-reported levels of clinical competency were also associated with higher levels of burnout [57, 90]. Being in a nursing supervisory position had ambiguous results on impact on burnout; in some studies, holding supervisory positions correlated with higher reports of burnout while in others, the opposite effects were found [29, 33]. Nurses identifying as not being White or Asian/Pacific Islander ethnicity/race scored significantly lower on the MBI subscale of Personal Accomplishment than respondents identifying as White and Asian/Pacific Islander, and Asian/Pacific Islanders scored lower on Emotional Exhaustion than those identifying as White [36]. High neuroticism and low agreeableness [31] were both associated with higher burnout. Finally, being married had mixed results on impact on burnout, whereas in some studies, being married correlated negatively with burnout, and in others, it correlated positively [26, 36, 101].",

Burnout was found to be high in certain high-acuity pediatric units including emergency, medical/surgical, surgery, pediatric intensive care unit (PICU), and neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) [26, 32, 35, 36, 76, 88]. Davis et al. [38] found that adult oncology nurses had higher personal accomplishment than pediatric oncology nurses while Neumann et al. [74] found nurses who care for both pediatric and adult patients had lower emotional exhaustion than those who cared for adult patents only. Conversely, Sun et al. [94] found that nurses who worked in adult obstetrics and gynecology units had more burnout than nurses who worked in pediatric units; however, Ohue et al. [78] reported the inverse. Working in hematology/oncology [88] and unit-level factors such as workload [65, 85], number of assigned patients [26], increased number of admissions, understaffing, and shifts > 8 h were associated with increased burnout [51, 92, 95, 96]. Aytekin et al. [29] found working longer years in the NICU was associated with lower levels of personal accomplishment. Brusch et al. [36] found that nurses working exclusively day shifts had higher levels of depersonalization than those working night shifts or a mix of days and nights. Favrod et al. [45] found NICU nurses reported more traumatic stressors in their working environment.",

Nurses who had higher perceived organizational support had lower burnout [39]. Higher burnout was generally associated with systems issues such as unreasonable policies, staffing shortages, insurance frustrations, high volumes of paperwork [65], lack of nursing supplies [36], and lack of regular staff meetings [56]. The relationship between resources and facets of burnout was mixed: Rochefort and Clarke [83] found a negative relationship between nurses\u2019 emotional exhaustion and their rating of the adequacy of the resources available to them, while Gallagher and Gormley [46] found that even nurses who reported that support systems were in place and felt supported still were emotionally exhausted. The lack of access to work information and research information was consistently associated with higher levels of burnout [71, 91], and lower burnout was associated with increased communication [33, 36] and better work relationships [39].",

An increase in burnout was associated with nurses considering a career change [37], decreased quality of life [29], tiredness [89], and feeling negatively toward their teammates and the impact of their work [37]. Work-associated compassion fatigue [16, 66], secondary traumatic stress [48, 58], and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) [37, 60, 70] were all found to be associated with pediatric nurse burnout. However, Li et al. [60] report that high group cohesion may prevent pediatric nurses from developing burnout from PTSD by protecting nurses from the impacts of negative outcomes. Nurse burnout was found to be negatively associated with the safety climate of the hospital in which they work [27, 39] and positively associated with higher infection rates when nurses were feeling overworked [96]. Moussa and Mahmood [71] found that as nurses\u2019 personal accomplishment increased, so did patients\u2019 mothers\u2019 satisfaction with meeting their child\u2019s care needs in the hospital.\n",

Interventions included coping workshops [42], mindfulness activities [47, 68, 70], workshops to improve knowledge/understanding of their patient population [81, 85], and clinical supervision [50]. Only three of the seven interventions studied provided varying positive impacts on burnout scores [42, 70, 85]. An in-person day-long retreat resulted in a significant improvement in emotional exhaustion for pediatric nurses. The intervention involved didactic and hands-on trauma, adaptive grief, and coping strategies; half of the subjects were also randomized to a booster session 6 months later [42]. Another intervention involved a 90-min interactive module on clinical skills surrounding the management of pediatric pain and resulted in a significant decrease in emotional exhaustion and depersonalization [85]. Finally, the third study of smartphone-delivered mindfulness interventions showed a marginal decrease in burnout compared to nurses receiving traditional mindfulness interventions [70].\n",

Similar burnout associations were found in research studying healthcare providers caring for adults such as younger age (< 31 years) [107, 108] and years of experience (> 7 years) [109]. It is likely that nurses new to the profession are younger, are experiencing the challenges of the nursing profession for the first time, and are less likely to have well-developed skills for resiliency. Given that the start of nurses\u2019 careers is a vulnerable stage for burnout, nursing schools and orientation programs may be well-positioned to highlight burnout prevention and mitigation strategies with students and new hires [107]. Personality traits such as high neuroticism and low agreeableness were found to be associated with pediatric nurse burnout [31]. These results have been supported in other nurse and physician populations, along with conscientiousness, extraversion, and openness contributing to lower levels of burnout [110\u2013113]. Although personality traits appear to have significant correlations with healthcare provider burnout, targeting modulation of personality traits as a mitigation strategy for burnout may be a high-cost, low-yield strategy.",

Although Bursch et al. [36] found that pediatric nurses who worked straight day shifts had higher depersonalization than those who worked mixed shifts or just night shifts, Poncet et al. [108] found that working more night shifts was associated with higher burnout in adult critical care nurses. Day shift nurses have potentially more strenuous workloads as patients are more wakeful, have diagnostic tests, or consulting services visiting; however, night shifts could be perceived as more strenuous as it requires the provider to work against their natural circadian rhythm and less support staff are available [120].

Poor leadership is associated with pediatric nurse burnout as identified by Bilial and Ahmed [33] and Druxbury et al. [41]; this relationship is echoed in research with physicians, nurses, and allied health [122]. In pediatric nurses [39], increased perception of organizational support is associated with lower burnout; this association is supported in general nursing populations [119, 123]. In all populations, the support a healthcare provider perceives they get from the organization is predictive of their level of organizational commitment. When healthcare providers perceive that they have high organizational support, they will exhibit greater organizational citizenship behavior, which are extra-role tasks that ultimately improve the organization [124]. Burnout itself results in reduced organizational commitment on the part of the healthcare provider [125].",

            "text": "Although only seven of the studies analyzed in this review included interventions, there is modest evidence on the efficacy of burnout interventions in the broader healthcare provider population. Similar to the results of Hallberg [50], a study of Swedish district nurses showed no impact of clinical supervision on burnout [143]. While Morrison Wylde et al. [70] found a marginal improvement in pediatric nurse burnout with smartphone-based intervention vs. traditional mindfulness interventions, studies investigating mindfulness interventions in other healthcare populations reported mixed results [144\u2013147]. Similar to pediatric nurses [84], social workers showed a significant decrease in burnout after attending skills development courses [148] suggesting that improving clinical knowledge and skills may reduce burnout. This is supported by the finding that pediatric nurses with lower clinical competency and education level have increased burnout [57, 90]. Although Edmonds et al. [42] showed significant decreases in pediatric nurse burnout using in-person trauma, adaptive grief, and coping sessions with follow-up, similar sessions have shown mixed results in other healthcare provider populations [149\u2013151]. More research is needed to identify reliable interventions for pediatric nurse burnout that can be pre-emptively and routinely implemented by nursing schools and healthcare organizations.",

Third, the definition of \u201cnurses\u201d varies internationally as does their required education and scope of practice; however, the slight variations were outweighed by the need to include thorough, culturally diverse research.

Factors associated with pediatric nurse burnout were similar to those found in other healthcare professional groups and can be separated into the domains of nurse personal factors, work environment, work attitudes, and work outcomes. Only 45 of the 78 studies reviewed studied exclusive populations of pediatric nurses, and most associations identified were correlational. Few interventions to prevent or mitigate pediatric nurse burnout have been undertaken, and the results were mixed, at best. Further studies using mixed methods are needed to expand on these results and incorporate the direct feedback of the nurses. Additional research is needed to develop and test interventions for pediatric nurse burnout. The improvement of pediatric nurse burnout has the potential to improve nurse well-being and, ultimately, patient care.",
