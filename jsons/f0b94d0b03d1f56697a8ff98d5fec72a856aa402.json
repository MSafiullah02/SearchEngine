The temporal unit is a day and the numbers of cases are those provided by the NHC. A first approach to said series confirms that the logarithmic transformation allows us to describe the phenomenon in a functionally simpler manner and with the added advantage of expressing the relative or percentual evolution of number of cases in logarithmic form. This series ln(C) appears at first glance to suggest a non-linear evolution close to the quadratic one. It should be pointed out that the quadratic evolution would only describe the phenomenon up to the peak, and following that point, would no longer be the generating model, given that C cannot decrease. It is a lifecycle model where the maximum is generated in a finite time and not in an infinite time like a classic logistic model. This gives rise to two ideas: to try to directly adjust the quadratic model to this series, or to find the first difference in the series and adjust a linear model to said difference. In principle, a linear model would allow us to describe more simply the internal mechanism of the phenomenon's evolution. On the other hand, the quadratic adjustment shows considerably self-correlated residues that suggest that the series may not be adequately predictable through a simple model. Thus, we consider that the first analysis to attempt is the linear model on the first difference in the series.",

            "text": "\u2022 Robustness check in the predictions provided by the model: Stability in the predictions as days of observation increase and stability in the solutions as less importance is assigned to older data potentially less relevant to the future. We calculated the first 10 self-correlations of the residues of the linear adjustment of d(ln(Cc)). Once standardized, no value significantly deviated from 0, such that there appears to be no underlying model more complex than the linear one to serve as generating model of past data. Obviously, the set of data is small (25 days), and this makes it more likely for the populational self-correlations to be null. As a reference, if residues in fact have null self-correlations, the first self-correlation observed could be in the interval (-0.467, 0.467), with a 95% confidence level. In any case, the Occam's razor principle indicates that we should not discard a simple model that could adequately describe the data. We have used the procedure of one-point cross-validation to check what degree of polynomial would be ideal for adjusting these data. The description is the following: for each polynomial degree, an adjustment was made by removing one of the observed data and noting the error in the estimation. This was carried out for all of the data individually and the quadratic error of all those errors was calculated. The values reflected in the Table are those quadratic errors for each degree from 0 to 5. The first-degree adjustment is the most logical choice. From this adjustment, we immediately obtain a prediction of t = 43.63 (February 12-13) for the moment of growth zero, in other words, the moment in which the quadratic process ln(C) reaches its maximum value, which in turn indicates when the number of accumulated confirmed cases C would stop growing. Obviously, starting at this point, the model would cease to work, given that number C by its very nature cannot decrease.",

In our previously executed linear adjustment, all data were granted the same weight. It is worth asking whether the results would have been different if older data were given a smaller weight. To this end, we have made predictions with linear adjustments assigning decreasing weight to older data. We decreased the weightings exponentially by factor \u03b1 per day passed, such that \u03b1 = 1 indicates non-decrease (our linear model) and \u03b1 = 0.7 implies an underweighting of 30% with each day that passes.",
