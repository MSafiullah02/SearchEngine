Some experts suggested that COVID-19 might mainly act on lymphocytes, especially T lymphocytes, as does SARS-CoV [10] . Many patients' CD3 + T, CD4 + T, and CD8 + T cell counts also decreased which indicated COVID-19 could attack immunocyte and lead to the imbalanced immune regulation. The CD4 + T cell counts, as well as CRP and LDH got linear regression to the severity of pulmonary lesions on CT, which was not depicted before. Significantly, those indicators enrolled in the model were the first value and divided as the category variable, which might indicate the patients' onset pulmonary severity levels. Similar to MERS-CoV or SARS-CoV infection [9] , some patients presented elevated level of liver aminotransferase, which may indicate the potential liver injury [11] .",

All patients presented elevated level of erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), while 75% for C-reactive protein (CRP), and 29.55% for procalcitonin (PCT). Nineteen patients (43.18%) had elevated lactic dehydrogenase (LDH) level, while 15.91% for alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and glutamyltransferase (GGT), 13.64% for aspartate aminotransferase (AST). Many patients' levels of total protein (TP), albumin (ALB), prealbumin (PAB), high-density lipoprotein (HDL) and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) were decreased (40.91%, 81.82%, 50%, 61.37% and 52.27%, respectively). A total of 456 pulmonary lesions were detected by CT in 44 patients, of them 1 patient had no lesions (2.3%), five had solitary focal lesion (11.4%), seventeen had more than 10 lesions (38.6%). The lesions number of type I was 127 (27.85%), type II 286 (62.72%), type III 22 (4.82%), type IV 21 (4.61%). The lesions were mainly distributed in the peripheral (92.11%) and",

All patients obtained follow-up CT at least once. During our study period, we recorded all patients' first follow-up CT (interval of 2-7 days; median, 4 days). 81.82% patients showed lesions progression, while 13.64% patients showed lesion absorption.
