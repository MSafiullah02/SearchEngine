            "text": "Human adenovirus (HAdV) is the most common cause of infection to the ocular surface, accounting for up to 75% of conjunctivitis cases.1 The most common presentation is pharyngoconjunctival fever (PCF), which often occurs in children and manifests clinically with fever, pharyngitis, rhinitis, follicular conjunctivitis, and regional lymphoid hyperplasia.2 Epidemic keratoconjunctivitis (EKC) is the most severe ocular form and is distinguished by its ability to invade the corneal epithelium, ranging in presentation from a keratitis to persistent and recurrent subepithelial infiltrates (SEIs). HAdV is highly contagious due to its unique structure and ability to evade the normal host\u2019s immune system. It is distinguished from other types of conjunctivitis in that it often involves the cornea, with potentially devastating visual complications. These features contribute to a heavy economic burden and necessitate the establishment of a standard treatment protocol.1 In addition to the potential ocular manifestations of this virus, HAdV infections have the propensity to manifest systemically, in cases such as respiratory, urinary, and gastrointestinal tract (GIT) infections. This variety of presentations can infect a normal, healthy host, and also have an increased risk in immunocompromised individuals. Despite the detrimental effect that HAdV infections pose, there has yet to be an FDA-approved drug to treat these conditions, making management difficult. Even following the active phase of the disease, viral persistence and reactivation may occur. Oral and topical antivirals have been considered as off-label management solutions, but problems with efficacy, bioavailability, and therapeutic profiles have limited their use. With regards to EKC, topical disinfection during active cases as well as treatment of corneal sequelae using corticosteroids and immunosuppressive agents show promise. This review will focus on how persistence and dissemination of HAdV poses a significant challenge to the management of adenoviral keratoconjunctivitis. Furthermore, current and future trends in prophylactic and therapeutic modalities for adenoviral keratoconjunctivitis will be discussed.",

            "text": "HAdV belongs to the genus Mastadenovirus and family Adenoviridae. It is a nonenveloped virus with a linear dsDNA genome and icosahedral capsids. HAdV consists of 7 groups classified through genomic sequence analysis.3 Adenoviral-based ocular surface infections are attributed to several subtypes of Group B and D HAdV. Generally, these viruses bind CD46, a ubiquitously expressed transmembrane protein, to infect the host.4,5 Exposure of the host to HAdV is made possible through the interaction between adenoviral fiber protein and primary host cellular receptors such as CD46, sialic acid, and heparin-sulfate proteoglycan, all of which promote the attachment and internalization of HAdV.6,7 Interactions between the penton base of the virus and vitronectin-binding integrins of the host support internalization and acidification of the endosome, triggering conformational changes to the viral capsid. This process culminates in the release of viral DNA genome into the host nucleus, where viral replication occurs.2,7-9",

Group D HAdV can also cause both ocular and GIT infection. Some group B HAdV subtypes infect the respiratory tract. Group B HAdV including type 3, 7, 14, and 21 have been associated with acute respiratory distress (ARD) outbreaks.2,12 HAdV types that cause ARD are transmitted through aerosolized droplets. It is important to note that both respiratory droplets and the fecal-oral transmission route from individuals with acute adenoviral infection, or even post-infection adenoviral shedding, play an important role in the transmission dynamics of HAdV infections.2,13\n",

Though PVI has been tested in vitro, in animal models, and clinically for its use in disinfection and wound healing for many decades, the use of a PVI irrigation in-office for EKC remains off-label.32 The theory behind in-office PVI irrigation is to reduce viral load on the ocular surface and to decrease viral shedding. A commonly implemented protocol in clinical practice involves anesthetizing the affected eye(s), then instilling a pre-irrigation NSAID drop, followed by four to five drops of 5% PVI solution. The patient then rolls his or her closed eye(s) for 60 s to maximize exposure (including swabbing of the eyelid margins), followed by lavage of the ocular surface with sterile saline irrigation solution (Figure 1). Finally, a post-irrigation NSAID drop is instilled. Anecdotally, patients may report exasperation of their conjunctivitis symptoms for 12\u201324 hrs after this procedure; however, the overall risk/benefit consideration regularly tips the decision in favor of preforming PVI irrigation.32",

Besides the aforementioned forms of keratoconjunctivitis, HAdV may also cause upper and lower respiratory tract disease, hemorrhagic cystitis, and gastroenteritis due to its propensity to infect mucosal epithelium.3,41,42 Respiratory infection is typically mild and self-limiting in immunocompetent individuals, but in rare cases, severe respiratory infection and pneumonia may result in acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Additionally, in immunocompromised patients undergoing hematopoietic stem cell or solid organ transplantation, disseminated infections can be life-threatening, particularly in the pediatric population.3 Despite thorough investigation on the role of antiviral treatment both systemically and topically, there remains no standard of care. Possible therapeutic benefits have been demonstrated through the use of antiviral drugs such as ganciclovir, ribavirin, and cidofovir.41\u201344",

In a series of experiments utilizing Syrian, immunocompromised hamsters infected with HAdV 5, GCV was able to suppress viral replication in the liver, a method that may involve the direct inhibition of DNA polymerase. It was proposed that GCV inhibited the advancement of viral infection into the late phase. Systemically, GCV was able to mitigate the effects of HAdV infection in these hamsters, decreasing the rate of mortality. This led to the investigation of GCV in the treatment of ocular infections of HAdV.43,44 The ophthalmic gel form (ganciclovir 0.15%, Virgan\u00ae; Farmila-Thea, Milan, Italy) has been the standard of care for the treatment of acute ocular herpetic keratitis, yet it has not been standardized in the management of adenoviral keratoconjunctivitis, particularly since studies in human subjects are lacking.43,44 Current research suggests, however, that with off-label topical use, GCV inhibits the replication of HAdV that leads to ocular infection.

It is converted by cells to its diphosphate form and binds to the HAdV DNA polymerase, causing viral DNA chain termination and viral inhibition.13,44 Intravenous cidofovir is often used in transplant clinics with only mild efficacy. This is due to poor cellular uptake because of its phosphate group, leading to accumulation of the drug in the renal tubules and, when used systemically, leads to nephrotoxicity.44,46 Locally, CDV may also cause ocular toxicity around the skin of eyelids and conjunctiva.46 Similarly, ribavirin also results in poor systemic side effects and safety profile, associated with extravascular hemolysis, anemia, and bone marrow suppression. Due to these discoveries, it is necessary to determine an effective antiviral with a high therapeutic index for the treatment of HAdV associated infections.46",

This was attributed to the antibodies' ability to target adenoviral capsid proteins, subsequently inhibiting infection by the virus.58 Topically, immunoglobulin (Ig) may offer the same effect on ocular tissue and prevent transmission and replication of the virus, to some degree. In addition to its antiviral properties, Ig has the added benefit of anti-inflammatory effects, which can aid in sub-epithelial infiltrate management.59 Nwanegbo et al found that Ig was actually comparable to cidofovir in its antiviral activity. While cidofovir acts intracellularly to block DNA replication, Ig neutralizes the virus on the ocular surface. In comparison to cidofovir and saline titers, Ig was more effective during the acute phase of the infection.59 It worked to aid in the clearance of the virus, shortening the duration of the infection, and thereby limiting the transmission of the virus. Additionally, Ig may be beneficial in prophylaxis to prevent clinical infections. Though both cidofovir and Ig were effective in this study, cidofovir demonstrated a significantly shorter duration of viral shedding. This is likely due to the mechanism of intracellular-mediated adenoviral DNA polymerase-blocking activities and prolonged tissue half-life after rapid uptake into cells. This study yielded promising results in the future of topical Ig use on ocular HAdV infections. The limitation lies in product consistency as Ig is derived from serum pooled by various donors, though anti-adenoviral efficacy appears stable over different lots.59,60",

Histologically they are comprised of residual antigen and lymphocytic accumulations that adhere to stromal cells in the cornea.62 This clinical finding may persist for months to years following resolution of the conjunctivitis, leading to subjective visual disturbances, such as decreased vision, photophobia, halos, and the development of irregular astigmatism. Due to their chronicity and visual impact, treatments including anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive agents have been investigated to treat as well as prevent SEIs, though they often end up resolving without scarring or corneal neovascularization formation.2,12,62",

There is also additional benefit in the use of topical corticosteroids once the acute phase of the infection resolves, for the remaining, persistent SEIs.2,63 While chronic corticosteroid treatment has been proven to reduce these findings, a significant challenge to this mode of treatment is the risk of complications of long-term use, including glaucoma and cataract formation.64\u201369 Additionally, corticosteroid treatment of SEIs can result in a 17.5% recurrence rate and consequential, unsuccessful drug tapering.70 If discontinued abruptly, these viral antigens continue to attract lymphocytes, causing persistence of SEIs.62,66 Excimer laser ablation can be helpful in such cases.63 In a study comparing topical loteprednol with dexamethasone, similar outcomes in SEI treatment were observed. This is significant because milder topical steroid forms, such as loteprednol, are known to have less risk of adverse effects.71 However, it is important to note that short-term treatment with topical steroids of limited potency may also delay viral clearance.72",

Historically, these drugs have been used to treat heart failure for over 200 years. More recently, they have also shown efficacy in cancer treatments, in that treated patients demonstrated a lesser chance of relapse.88 Hartley et al first noted its potential antiviral benefit, noting its efficacy against HAdV and herpesviruses.89 This is due to the drugs inhibiting Na+/K+ ATPase on the cell surface, which leads to increased intracellular levels of NA+ and, subsequently, Ca++. Na+/K+ ATPase is an important cell signaling molecule, where binding with digoxin or digitoxin initiates multiple signaling cascades, influencing gene expression. These drugs also alter RNA splicing, which is necessary to HAdV replication. Preliminary data supports a concentration-dependent reduction in the number of infected cells and no apparent damage. Although there is known toxicity, particularly with long-term use of digoxin, the antiviral uses of cardiotonic steroids would be short term, negating the associated systemic complications. As such, these drugs seem to be efficacious against HAdV serotypes A-D and serve as potential treatment therapies for the treatment and prophylaxis of EKC.88 Thus, repurposing of these cardiotonic steroids as an antiviral agent for short-term treatment of adenoviral keratoconjunctivitis as well as a prophylactic for use in individuals in close contact with patients with epidemic keratoconjunctivitis.88 Furthermore, Marrugal-Lorenzo et al reported that mifepristone, a synthetic steroid drug, possesses anti-adenoviral properties via its interference with viral entry into the nucleus. As such, it could be repurposed for treating adenoviral infections.90",

Because there are no FDA-approved drugs to treat HAdV infection, eye care providers use multiple pharmaceuticals off-label to manage HAdV ocular infection. Finally, the propensity for latent HAdV to become reactivated and easily transmissible warrants the need for additional research in developing an effective, prophylactic antiviral drug. New treatments under consideration include sialic acid analogs, cold atmospheric plasma (CAP), N-chlorotaurine, and even benzalkonium chloride (BAK).
