            "text": "Proteomic analysis by Zeng et al. [3] showed that many changes in protein expression were present in PEDV infected Vero cells. These proteins are involved in the regulation of apoptosis, signal transduction and the stress response. Moreover, Kim et al. [4] showed that the apoptosis induced by PEDV infection mainly activates the intracellular caspase-dependent mitochondrial apoptosis-inducing factor (AIF) signaling pathway. PEDV infection can also cause intracellular MAPK signaling including ERK (extracellular signaling-regulated kinase), p38 MAPK and JNK (c-Jun N-terminal kinase) activation [5,6]. Therefore, the proliferation of PEDV will stimulate a variety of signaling pathways, such as apoptosis [4], MAPK signaling pathway, endoplasmic reticulum stress response, making cells provide a microenvironment conducive to PEDV proliferation, and the induction of cellular pathological changes [6]. Most research on PED has focused on pathogen isolation and identification, genomic and structural protein analysis, diagnosis and vaccine development [7]; however, the detailed molecular mechanisms of viral pathogenesis remain unclear. The results of a virus infection are mainly determined by the interaction between the virus and the innate immune system [8]. Therefore, understanding how the virus interacts with the innate immune system of the host is essential to understand the molecular mechanisms of viral pathogenesis. In addition, PEDV infection not only causes ER stress and activates NF-\u03baB [6,9]. Furthermore, it has been reported that stable expression of PEDV N and E proteins in porcine intestinal epithelial cells (IECs) can activate NF-\u03baB and up-regulate the expression of IL-8 [10]. Ding et al. [11] reported that transient expression of PEDV N protein could inhibit NF-\u03baB activation in HEK-293T cells. However, the exact mechanism that regulates NF-\u03baB activity during PEDV infection remains to be elucidated.",

PEDV was isolated from the previously infected piglets in Anhui Province, and subsequently achieved in the laboratory. Piglets were divided into two groups (n = 6); the first group were infected with 10 mL of 106.62 copies/\u03bcL of PEDV using 9 mm French tube with syringe at the end. Second group was the controls (n = 4), which were fed with 10 mL of culture medium. After infection, we monitored the time of onset of diarrhea and other symptoms of PED and data were recorded. After 6 h of PED symptoms were detected, the pigs were euthanized, and the inner wall of the small intestine was flushed with sterile PBS solution and sections of the small intestinal mucosa were scraped with a sterile glass slide for RNA sequencing.",

Reads with adaptors and reads with unknown bases (N bases > 5%) to get the clean reads, starting with an average of 74,222,000 raw reads we obtained 65,525,000 clean reads. Clean reads quality metrics are shown in (Table 1\n). We used StringTie [12] to reconstruct transcripts, then we used Cuffmerge (Cufflinks tools [13]) to bring together the refactoring information for all our samples, and used Cuffcompare to compare reconstructed transcripts to reference annotation. Subsequently, we mapped clean reads to a reference using Bowtie 2 [14], followed by the gene expression level calculation using RSEM [15]. RSEM is a software package for estimating gene and isoform expression levels from RNA-Seq data. Moreover, we calculated the Pearson correlation between all samples, carried out hierarchical clustering between all samples using hclust (http://bioinformatics.org.au/tools/hclust/). Furthermore, we performed principal component analysis PCA analysis for all samples using Princomp and drew the diagrams using ggplot2 with d of R. To determine the number of novel genes and known genes, we calculated the gene numbers. We identified DEGs with DEseq2 by screening for differential genes with a fold change \u22652.00 and an adjusted P-value \u2264 0.05 was based on method described previously by Ref. [16].",

Cao et al. [19], carried out gene silencing of the TLR family genes and found that PEDV-infected cells with TLR2, TLR3 and TLR9 silenced genes can significantly inhibit the expression of NF-\u03baB and prevent nuclear translocation of NF-\u03baB. Recent studies have shown that TLR4 is also involved in recognizing the envelope proteins and fusion proteins of certain viruses, but the interaction with these ligand structures is unclear. In the present study, the host target organ of PEDV infection significantly up-regulated TLR4.

NF-\u03baB is a transcription factor which regulates the expression of various genes, which are involved in innate and adaptive immunity responses and cell survival [20,21]. NF-\u03baB regulates the transcription of many factors that involve in the immune system stimulation including a variety of proinflammatory cytokines, chemokines, adhesion molecules and induce expression of enzymes and cell proliferation [22]. Reports have shown that Bcl-2 expression is also by NF-\u03baB [23]. As an anti-apoptotic protein, Bcl-xl/Bcl-2l1 protein can directly inhibit channel activity by binding to VDAC on the mitochondrial membrane to stabilize it, inhibit cytochrome C release and block activation of the caspase family of proteins, and thus achieve the purpose of anti-apoptotic action; it can also inhibit Fas and Fas-mediated apoptosis [24]. The results of this study are consistent with the above findings wherein we demonstrated that PEDV infects the host and activated the NF-\u03baB signaling pathway and subsequently, up-regulated the expression of Bcl-2L1 pathway which play a role in resisting apoptosis after PEDV infection.",

Among them IGS15 inhibits virus replication by enhancing the activity of the JAK/STAT1 signaling pathway [29] or directly modifying the viral proteins [30]. Due to the wide distribution of IFNGR1/2 most cell types respond to IFN-\u03b3, thereby IFN-\u03b3 produces pleiotropic effects on immune cells and limited direct antiviral activity [31]. In this study, the high expression of IFN-\u03b3observed in the intestinal mucosa of piglets infected with PEDV may indicate that IFN-\u03b3plays an important defensive role against PEDV infection, this is consistent with above finding.

Results of this study elucidates the transcriptome of intestinal mucosa in PEDV-infected piglets. Our observations suggest that PEDV infection in piglets induces a strong immune response, particularly activates the antiviral defense mechanisms through the expression of immune genes and the changes of the signaling pathways were identified. Results of this study will further enhance the understanding of PEDV infection in piglets and will guide in devising clinical intervention strategies against PEDV infections.",
