Antiviral therapy is the cornerstone of treatment for influenza pneumonia [1\u20133]; in addition, intravenous corticosteroids have been used as co-adjuvant therapy in patients with ARF/ARDS to modulate lung inflammation and improve clinical outcomes [4\u20138]. However, no randomized clinical trials have investigated the potential benefit or harm of corticosteroid therapy for ARF/ARDS due to acute influenza pneumonia.",

A recent Cochrane review [14] concluded that co-adjuvant corticosteroid therapy was associated with increased mortality in patients with influenza pneumonia. However, the data were derived from observational studies of very low quality and with several methodological limitations, including other clinical indications of corticosteroids as a major potential concern. Thus, it is impossible to be sure that patients who were treated with corticosteroids did not have other corticosteroid indications or were not more severely ill in the first place. We have previously reported that corticosteroid therapy does not improve survival in patients with primary viral pneumonia [12]. However, in that observational study, we assessed the effects of corticosteroid therapy on survival between patients who were and were not treated, but we did not apply a statistical method that would have balanced all the variables between the two groups. Therefore, the aim of the present study was to identify the factors associated with corticosteroid use and its impact on intensive care unit (ICU) mortality using propensity score (PS) matching analysis in ICU patients with influenza pneumonia. Preliminary results of this analysis were presented in the 38th International Symposium on Intensive Care and Emergency Medicine [15].",

This allowed us to study two comparable (almost identical) cohorts: (1) the corticosteroid-treated group and (2) the control group, comprising patients who did not receive corticosteroid treatment. PS matching analysis attempts to compare outcomes between patients who have a similar distribution of all the covariates measured. An attractive feature of this approach is that it uses the entire sample. Using the PS methodology, all patients were assigned a weight between 0 and 1; this propensity-matched cohort was generated by choosing the best weight balance. This method optimizes the post-weighting balance of covariates between groups and, in this way, approximates the conditions of random site-of-treatment assignment. To assess our PS adjustment, we checked for adequate overlap in propensity scores between groups with a cross-validation model. To do so, we divided the patients in the database into two subsets: (a) a \u201ctraining set\u201d with 1466 patients (80%), and (b) a \u201cvalidation set\u201d with 366 patients (20%).",

Because Cox hazard survival analysis is not satisfactory for describing ICU patient mortality over time [33], we performed a competing risks analysis to confirm our results. First, we computed the cumulative incidence function (CIF) of death over time. At time t, the CIF defines the probability of dying in the ICU by that time t when the population can be discharged alive. The CIF was estimated from the data using the cmprsk package developed by Gray [34]. We used the Fine and Gray model [35], which extends the Cox model to competing risks data by considering the sub-distribution hazard (for instance, the hazard function associated with the CIF). The strength of the association between each variable and the outcome was assessed using the sub-hazard ratio (SHR), which is the ratio of hazards associated with the CIF in the presence of and in the absence of a prognostic factor.",

Observational studies are potentially susceptible to bias and do not provide robust results. Despite these weaknesses, however, observational data are representative of current clinical practice, and applying modern methods such as PS matching may help in evaluating the effects of certain interventions in clinical settings and may help to guide decision-making.",

            "text": "To the best of our knowledge, only one study has used an analysis similar to ours in patients with influenza infection. In 245 critically ill patients, Kim et al. [11] analyzed the effect of corticosteroid treatment on 90-day mortality with a similar methodology to ours, applying multivariate adjustment (controlling for variables that differed between the two groups and incorporating the PS) and PS matching (1:1). Sixty-five pairs were generated, and the 90-day mortality rate was higher in the corticosteroid group (54% vs. 31%, p = 0.004). These data are in concordance with our results; however, the mortality rate in our patients was substantially lower. This discrepancy might be due to several factors, including differences in severity of illness, endpoint observational period (ICU mortality vs. 90-day mortality), and early recognition vs. standard of care. Interestingly, Kim et al. reported that half of the patients treated with corticosteroids received hydrocortisone, a non-standard co-adjuvant treatment of pneumonia. The authors did not report the treatment indication for corticosteroid therapy; thus many patients in this cohort may have received corticosteroids for a reason other than influenza-induced acute lung injury. In contrast, our population comprised only patients treated with corticosteroids as an co-adjuvant therapy for severe viral pneumonia, excluding patients with other indications for corticosteroids (such as shock). Therefore, with a homogeneous group of critically ill patients, and after carefully controlling for important confounders through a PS matching analysis and competing risks analysis, we provide robust evidence to support the association between corticosteroid administration and increased mortality.",

This condition, and other uncontrolled confounding factors, may explain the higher mortality among COPD patients even after excluding patients with COPD exacerbation.",

However, we recognize some limitations. First, our results were obtained in a homogeneous population of patients with influenza pneumonia and cannot be extrapolated to other populations. Second, we did not review the duration of viral shedding or appearance of drug-resistant virus in either group. Third, PS matching analysis may also be a limitation, because this method may not reflect the possible biases in observational studies, and some residual confounding may persist. However, as PS matching analysis can balance the population and reduces observational bias, it is the best evidence available for physicians. Fourth, data on MV of patients were not recorded. Lung-protective ventilation is the standard of care for patients with acute lung injury/ARDS because of the evidence that it decreases mortality. Although we did not provide data regarding ventilation of patients, it is broadly accepted in this country that applying protective ventilation improves results and is one of the national quality indicators. Finally, we did not record data about muscle weakness or metabolic alterations related to corticosteroid treatment.",
