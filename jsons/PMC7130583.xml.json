Only 30 years previously, Louis Pasteur had performed his famous experiments disproving spontaneous generation and promoting germ theory [1]; however, debate still raged over the best way to prove that certain germs really did cause specific diseases. Robert Koch presented a set of criteria for establishing etiology [2], which in time formed the cornerstone of microbiological research, and brought much-needed scientific rigor to the field. By conducting a set of experiments that prove that (1) an organism is present in every infected individual, (2) that organism could be isolated from an infected individual and grown in culture, (3) that organism, when introduced into a healthy individual, would lead to the development of the same disease, and (4) that the same organism could again be recovered from the experimentally infected individual, a researcher could confidently assert that she/he had found the causative agent.",

Growing understanding of the autonomic, immune and endocrine surrogate markers that predict disease is certainly making it easier to study conditions with long lead-in times. There are other positive developments too. Advances in neurosciences are leading to a resurging interest in psychosomatic medicine. Frontolimbic structures such as the insula, prefrontal cortex, orbitofrontal cortex, and amygdala, which are increasingly being regarded as having a central role in emotion regulation and pathogenesis of common psychiatric illnesses, also seem to have to role in the regulation of autonomic, immune, and endocrine systems. Furthermore, some of the genetic polymorphisms, such as those within the COMT gene that have interested psychiatric geneticists for some time, have started to capture interest of others investigating the pathogenesis of general medical conditions.",

In this way, we can perhaps pinpoint which aspects of mental health issues are in and of themselves atherogenic, or diabetogenic. This edition of the Journal of Psychosomatic Research contains several studies that are in this vein: Kornerup et al. [5] look at the construct of vital exhaustion and its value in predicting stroke; Doyle et al. [6] deconstruct commonly used depression rating scales to investigate which aspect of depressive symptomatology is most strongly correlated with major cardiac events; Brydon et al. [7] investigate whether trait hostility is associated with physiological changes that predispose individuals to cardiac events, and suggest that the sympathetic activation and inflammatory pathways mediate the relationship; and Grabe et al. [8] present evidence that alexithymia is an independent risk factor for hypertension and atherosclerosis. Loponen et al. [9], taking a different approach, investigate the combined effect of sleep problems and metabolic syndrome on the risk for coronary heart disease.",

[11], noting a previously documented correlation between arthritis and psychiatric conditions, look at a longitudinal population dataset to establish the temporal relationship between the two. Their results indicate that arthritis does predict later development of a mood disorder, while having a mood or anxiety disorder does not increase the risk for later development of arthritis. The investigators took an important step in establishing a causal relationship. We now look to them and others to rule out alternative explanations, and, if the relationship is indeed causal, determine mediating variables.",

When asking if psychiatric conditions, even less clear in terms of their own etiology, have an etiological role in these illnesses, we may have to settle for less than certain answers. Ultimately, everyone decides for themselves how much evidence is enough to guide an action.
