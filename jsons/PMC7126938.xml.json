Nodularity is helpful for differentiating this from edema that occurs due to lymphatic obstruction in the hilar regions. Lung masses and nodules can occur (Fig. 1\n).7 The pleura can be affected, either by effusions or soft tissue.8 The degree of adenopathy in the mediastinum is a helpful feature for differentiating from primary pulmonary lymphoma.",

Most commonly, pulmonary lymphoma derives from extranodal marginal zone lymphoma of mucosal associated lymphoid tissue (MALT), reported in 70%-90% of cases.12, 13 Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma predominantly accounts for the remainder of primary pulmonary lymphoma. Less common entities include lymphomatoid granulomatosis, primary pulmonary Hodgkin's lymphoma, and plasmacytoma.14 Other lymphoproliferative disorders affecting the lung and pleura also include nodular lymphoid hyperplasia and Castleman's disease, which lack monoclonal proliferation, in addition to primary effusion lymphoma that affects pleural, pericardial, or peritoneal spaces in immunocompromised individuals such as with acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS).11\n",

Accompanying bronchiolitis is often present and seen on CT as small centrilobular tree-in-bud nodules that represent inflamed and infected small airways at the terminal respiratory bronchiole level. Cavitation can occur particularly with bacterial and fungal infections. Viral infections affect the lung interstitum and present on CT with centrilobular nodules, ground-glass opacity, consolidation, and bronchial wall thickening (Fig. 7\n). Commonly, viral infections are bilateral and diffuse with asymmetric distribution. Some viruses are associated with pleural effusions.58 Fungal infections are often multifocal, presenting with mass-like consolidations and large nodules, although can be solitary. In one study, AIA is reported as having a higher number of patients with peribronchial distribution, while ANG had more cavitary nodules.55 A halo of ground-glass opacity around a nodule is a sign of ANG in the early phase. Subsequent development of a crescent of air (air-crescent sign) occurs within the lesion often, once the immunity of the affected patient is restored and a white-cell response to the infection can occur.59\n",

These new methods can be performed on nasal and nasopharyngeal swabs and sputum. Agents such as Staphylococcus aureus; Streptococcus pneumoniae; a large number of viruses that include adenovirus, parainfluenza, respiratory syncytial virus, human metapneumovirus, coronavirus, rhinovirus; Mycoplasma pneumoniae, and Chlamydia pneumoniae can be assessed for using molecular testing.60, 61 The addition of molecular testing increases the diagnosis of pathogens causing severe community-acquired pneumonia to 70%-80%.60 Procalcitonin has been investigated as a method to detect and differentiate bacterial and mixed bacterial/viral infections from only viral infection, which does not have procalcitonin levels higher than 0.25 ng/ml. The combination of procalcitonin and viral PCR analysis can be used to identify patients with community-acquired pneumonia.60 However, caution is needed given procalcitonin levels can be negative for a few hours after bacterial invasion and be influenced by a number of factors, such as renal failure and dialysis. CMV infection is established when peripheral antigenemia for CMV is identified, or tissue that is sampled is positive for CMV.53 Rapid nucleic acid amplification test techniques are also available for confirming active tuberculosis.62 Galactomannan antigen assays from bronchoalveolar lavage and serum can be used to diagnose ANG in the acute setting, with lower sensitivity when testing serum for chronic aspergillus infection.63 Beta-D-glucan assays from serum can be used to diagnose a number of fungal infections including Aspergillus, candida, and endemic fungi, although sensitivities vary and range between 38% and 100% depending on assay, population, and organism.64, 65 Assays for Immunoglobulin (Ig) G that are specific for Aspergillus are also used to aid in diagnosing infection.65 More invasive testing includes analysis of bronchoalveolar lavage samples for smear and culture and biopsy for verifying viral and fungal infections.",

Infection is a major consideration for acute presentations of patients with peribronchovascular- predominant findings (Fig. 12\n), and in this scenario, workup for infection would ensue with microbiology, hematology, and assays to identify a causative agent.
