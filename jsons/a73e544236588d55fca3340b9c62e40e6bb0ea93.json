On admission he was pale and had left hemiparesis. Haematological findings were Hb 67 g/l; platelets 185 2 10 9 /l; WBC 7 . 7 2 10 9 /l with 7% plasma cells. A bone marrow aspirate revealed marked hypercellularity, 85 . 5% atypical large plasma cells with abundant cytoplasm, prominent nucleoli and occasional multinucleated cells, and marked reticulin fibrosis. Subsequent bone marrow aspirates were dry tap and trephine biopsy confirmed secondary myelofibrosis. The cytoplasm of these plasma cells was positive for immunoglobulin (Ig)A by immunohistochemistry. The total serum protein was 64 g/l, and serum protein electrophoresis showed 80 . 9% albumin and 2 . 5% gammaglobulin. The serum Ig concentrations were: IgG 1 . 85 g/l, IgA 0 . 01 g/l, IgM 0 . 05 g/l, IgD <0 . 006 g/l and IgE <5000 U/l. No monoclonal Ig or Bence Jones protein was detected either in serum or 2 50 concentrated urine by immunoelectrophoresis. The serum beta-2-microglobulin was elevated to 0 . 02 g/l. Bone X-rays revealed no manifest osteolytic lesions but bone scintigraphy showed diffuse bony uptake. Abdominal echogram disclosed hepatosplenomegaly. 2 weeks after admission, plasma cells in the peripheral blood reached 39%, and the patient was diagnosed as having non-secretory IgA type PCL. Immunophenotyping of peripheral blood mononuclear cells suggested the coexpression of CD38 and myeloid antigen CD13 on leukaemic plasma cells even in the presence of monocyte contamination. This was confirmed later. Furthermore, Ig heavy chain gene rearrangement (JH), but no Ig light chain nor T-cell receptor-beta chain gene rearrangement, was found in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (data not shown).",

These multiple courses of combination chemotherapy failed to induce complete remission in bone marrow, although plasma cells in the peripheral blood almost disappeared.

This leads to the hypothesis of pluripotentialstem cell involvement in the pathogenesis of multiple myeloma (Barlogie et al, 1989) . However, Terstappen et al (1990) have shown that myeloid-specific antigens such as CD33 and CD13 are expressed on a proportion of plasma cells in normal human bone marrow. Recent studies indicate that a natural killer cell associated antigen (CD56), a molecule identical to neural cell adhesion molecule, is expressed by plasma cells from a subset of multiple myeloma (Van Camp et al, 1990; Drach et al, 1991) . CD56-negative myeloma patients have predominantly aggressive disease and their plasma cells frequently exhibit early B-cell and myeloid antigens. Malignant plasma cells from our patient showed myeloid antigen CD13 expression but no CD56 antigen (Fig 1) , and the patient was resistant to multiple courses of chemotherapy.",

It also serves as the major receptor for an enteropathogenic coronavirus, transmissible gastroenteritis virus (Shipp & Look, 1993) .
