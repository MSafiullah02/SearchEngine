These scenarios include different blast, biological, chemical, nuclear, and natural disasters. Radiology has a significant role in many of these scenarios because it stands at the crossroads of screening, decontamination, diagnosis, treatment planning, and perhaps long-term patient care.",

Most of the buildings within 1,000 m (\u223c3,200 ft) of the detonation will be severely damaged. Subsequent injuries from flying debris (missiles) will possibly be observed out to 6 km (\u223c3.7 miles) [1]. Patients will present primarily with burns to exposed skin and eyes (flash burns), projectile, crush, and translational injuries (Fig. 1) as well as acute radiation syndrome [1]. Gas-filled organs such as the ears, lungs, and gastrointestinal tract will be the most vulnerable to the blast effect, with lung injury as the primary cause of morbidity and mortality. Individuals directly exposed to the radiation will result in additional long-term health care sequelae. Many of these victims will have an increased future risk of developing subsequent malignant neoplasms. Of these malignancies, leukemia is the most likely; however, some patients may also develop thyroid, breast, lung, or salivary gland cancer [2]. In addition to providing immediate trauma imaging assistance, radiologists may be asked to provide expert advice in concert with a health physicist (if available) to assist with radiation detection, patient triage, decontamination, and management of the victims of acute radiation syndrome.\n\n",

On pathologic examination, there is severe pulmonary disease, with areas of profound lobular exudation and bacillary aggregation. Prominent gastrointestinal symptoms may present, to include nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, and diarrhea [7]. The sudden appearance of a large number of previously healthy patients with fever, cough, shortness of breath, chest pain, and a fulminant fatal course should suggest the possibility of pneumonic plague or inhalational anthrax [7].

Following detonation from a radiation dispersal device, cesium would be spread over an area of approximately 36 city blocks, with concentrations ranging from 5 to 500 \u03bcCi/m2. Casualties in this scenario are estimated at approximately 180 fatalities, 270 injuries, and 20,000 detectible personal contaminations (at each exposed site). The only immediate injuries to be expected would include direct blast injuries that are a result of the primary detonation of the explosive [1], which will be discussed in further detail in scenario 12.",

In addition, cesium-137 is particularly dangerous if accidentally ingested or inhaled as it is readily absorbed by the lungs and gastrointestinal tract. The US Nuclear Regulatory Commission has determined that approximately 200 \u03bcCi of inhaled cesium-137 would result in an approximately 5-rem exposure (10 CFR Appendix B to part 20). Given the variability in weather, as well as exposure conditions, doses up to 543 rem have been estimated by this particular route [12], with decreasing exposure with greater distance. Despite the dangers which cesium-137 poses to those directly within the blast area, the majority of patients presenting to medical facilities, however, would likely present due to psychosomatic illness brought on by widespread public panic from radiation exposure assuming they were outside the immediate area of exposure and considering weather patterns within the area at the time of the exposure. Finally, the long-term effects of a radiation detonation within the affected population (i.e., increased risk of cancers) would depend upon the cumulative exposure of the population, which would be based upon the amount of aerosolized and surface contamination as well as proximity to the epicenter of the blast [1].",
