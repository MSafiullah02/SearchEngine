            "text": "Porcine epidemic diarrhea (PED), which is caused by porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV), is an acute, highly contagious, and devastating enteric disease characterized by vomiting, watery diarrhea, and dehydration, resulting in high mortality rates in suckling pigs (Pijpers et al., 1993). PEDV is an enveloped RNA virus belonging to the order Nidovirales, genus Alphacoronavirus, within the Coronaviridae family (Bridgen et al., 1998, Brian and Baric, 2005, Sergeev, 2009). The viral genome comprises a single-stranded positive-sense RNA of approximately 28 kb, which encodes six genes: replicase (Rep), spike (S), ORF3, envelope (E), membrane (M), and nucleoprotein (N) (Duarte and Laude, 1994, Utiger et al., 1995, Chen et al., 2008). PEDV was first reported in growing pigs in the United Kingdom in 1971 (Pensaert and de Bouck, 1978) and subsequently in a number of European countries (Nagy et al., 1996, Pritchard et al., 1999, Martelli et al., 2008); more recently, the virus has appeared in China, Japan, Thailand, Vietnam, and South Korea (Sueyoshi et al., 1995, Song et al., 2006, Puranaveja et al., 2009, Chen et al., 2010).",

Confirmatory laboratory tests are therefore necessary to definitively identify the causative pathogen. Several methods of detecting PEDV have been published: reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), antigen enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), and immunohistochemistry (Callebaut et al., 1982, van Nieuwstadt et al., 1988, Sueyoshi et al., 1995, Paton et al., 1997, Kim et al., 2000, Kim et al., 2007, Shibata et al., 2000, Rod\u00e1k et al., 2005). Although these techniques have been used widely to diagnose PEDV infection, they are laborious, time-consuming, and require laboratory expertise and/or special equipment, making them unsuitable for field use. These methods are also unsuitable for the management of emergent PED outbreaks, thereby restricting their application to veterinary clinical diagnosis.",

            "text": "Immunochromatography (IC) assays were first described in the late 1960s and were originally developed to test for serum proteins (Kohn, 1968). Over the past decade, many IC assays have been developed to detect infectious diseases (Allwinn et al., 1999, Aidoo et al., 2001, Berdal et al., 2000, Grunow et al., 2000, Buser et al., 2001) and for use in veterinary medicine (Klingenberg and Esfandiari, 1996, Laitinen and Vuento, 1996, Oh et al., 2006, Meng et al., 2014). Lateral flow IC assays are generally not quantitative and provide only a yes/no answer; they also lack multiplexing (Zhou et al., 2012). Despite these disadvantages, the IC assay is straightforward to use because it simply requires that the user dilute the test agent in a sample buffer prior to detection. Thus, IC assays yield rapid and accurate results without the need for specialized equipment or trained personnel. The assays are also very stable and robust (they have a long shelf life and do not usually require refrigeration) and are relatively inexpensive to produce. These features make them ideal for both field and laboratory testing of samples.",

Such labels comprise colored or fluorescent nanoparticles. Common labels are liposomes, colloidal carbon, or colloidal gold. Liposomes are vesicles formed by a lipid bilayer and have been used commercially in membrane-based lateral flow assays (Shukla et al., 2011, Shukla et al., 2014). However, liposomes are relatively unstable and susceptible to lysis by surfactants. Colloidal carbon, in the form of India Ink, has been used in immunoassays since the 1970s (Geck, 1971, Waller, 1977, Chandler et al., 2000). Advantages include high stability and high color contrast on membranes; however, conjugating protein to colloidal carbon takes longer time than to colloidal gold and, therefore, it is unsuitable for commercial immunoassays. Colloidal gold is the most widely used label in commercial lateral IC assays (Chandler et al., 2000). It is fairly easy and inexpensive to prepare, provides intense color, and can be visualized without the need for developing agents.",

However, the appearance of a weak band in the test line may cause problems with interpretation; because the test is visualized with the naked eye, the final result can depend upon the interpretation of the user. Therefore, it is important to minimize non-specific bands in the test line. To avoid non-specific interactions, antibodies must be immobilized on the conjugate pad and test line at the appropriate density. If the density is too high, it can lead to non-specific binding and a lack of specificity.",

The low number of experimental steps associated with this assay minimizes the risk of contamination, thereby allowing better understanding of the epidemiology of an outbreak (Kim et al., 2007). Here, we showed that the real-time RT-PCR assay was 10-fold more sensitive than the IC assay (Fig. 1). However, the IC assay generates a result within 10 min, significantly faster than the time taken by real-time RT-PCR (>4 h). Rapid and accurate diagnosis of PED is paramount when deciding whether to initiate treatment. Such rapid responses will reduce economic losses in the animal industry. Rapid diagnosis and the instigation of timely control strategies before animals display clinical symptoms may prevent the spread of PEDV to other pig farms. Rapid diagnosis of PEDV has assumed greater significance because it can be of direct benefit to the swine industry in the absence of suitable therapeutic measures.",
