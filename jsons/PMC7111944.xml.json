Indeed, we reported that the OC43 strain (HCoV-OC43) could infect and persist in human neural cell lines (Arbour et al., 1999), and infect primary human and murine central nervous system (CNS) cultures (Bonavia et al., 1997, Jacomy et al., 2006). Moreover, neurons were the main target of infection in the murine CNS (Jacomy et al., 2006), as well as in human co-cultures of neurons and astrocytes (M. Desforges and P.J. Talbot, unpublished data). Furthermore, HCoV-OC43 induced a chronic encephalitis in susceptible mice (Jacomy et al., 2006), HCoV RNA was detected in human brains (Arbour et al., 2000) and HCoV-OC43 was associated with acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (Yeh et al., 2004). Considering that murine hepatitis virus, MHV, the murine counterpart of HCoV-OC43, causes neurological disease in mice (Buchmeier et al., 1987), we hypothesized that HCoV-OC43 might be associated with some human neurological diseases.",

            "text": "ATF6 is a major transcriptional factor that leads to upregulation of chaperones involved in the recovery of ER protein folding capacity (Ron and Walter, 2007). PERK is activated following homodimerization and plays a major role in the phosphorylation of the translation initiation factor eIF2-alpha (Shi et al., 1998). IRE1 is an endoribonuclease and kinase which undergoes oligomerization and autophosphorylation, leading to its activation following UPR induction (Tirasophon et al., 1998, Tirasophon et al., 2000, Yoshida et al., 2001). IRE1 is responsible for the unconventional splicing of Xbp1(u) mRNA by excising an 26-nucleotide intron, yielding the Xbp1(s) mRNA form (Yoshida et al., 2001). Xbp1(s) is translated into a transcription factor, XBP1, which translocates to the nucleus (Yoshida et al., 2001). XBP1 induces the expression of genes related to proteasomal degradation of proteins (Yamamoto et al., 2004). XBP1 may also promote the expression of the genes Grp94, an ER chaperone (Yamamoto et al., 2004), and Chop (Lee et al., 2003). XBP1 is also known to solely induce the expression of P58-ipk, an inhibitor of PERK kinase activity (Lee et al., 2003), preventing its ability to phosphorylate eIF2-alpha.",

First, we evaluated the susceptibility of the two well-characterized differentiated human neuronal cell lines NT2-N (Pleasure and Lee, 1993) and LA-N-5 (Hill and Robertson, 1998) to HCoV-OC43 (ATCC strain) infection. Immunofluorescence analysis confirmed the neuronal nature of the cells, as revealed by the detection of specific neuronal markers, NFM for LA-N-5 and \u03b2-tubIII for NT2-N (Fig. 1A, panels a and b), and their susceptibility to HCoV-OC43 infection was demonstrated by the detection of viral antigens (Fig. 1A, panels c and d). Furthermore, the infection was shown to be productive, as demonstrated by the increase in infectious HCoV-OC43 progeny virions in cell culture medium over a period of 72 h post-infection (Fig. 1B).",

We identified a total of 275 genes, the expression of which was significantly modulated at 24, 48 and/or 72 h post-infection, in at least two independent infections, with a maximum p-value of 0.05.

Our results showed a high correlation between the NT2-N and LA-N-5 neuronal models in the modulation of expression of UPR-related genes following HCoV-OC43 infection (Table 1\n). The degree of induction (fold-induction) in the expression of the Atf4, Erdj3, Erdj4, Gadd34, Grp78 and Grp94 genes clearly indicated a significant similarity between the response of both NT2-N and LA-N-5 cells, establishing a relevant consistency between the two models (Table 1). Moreover, even though there were some differences in the degree of induction of gene expression in the two cell lines for the Chop, Edem, Herp, P58-ipk and Xbp1 genes, an upregulation was always observed over the time-course of HCoV-OC43 infection (Table 1). Indeed, the trend in the modulation of expression of these genes followed the same pattern in both NT2-N and LA-N-5 cells, which again revealed a consistency in the state of activation of the underlying pathways.",

Consequently, we sought to determine whether a HCoV-OC43 variant harboring mutations within the S protein related to enhanced neurovirulence in mice (H. Jacomy and P. J. Talbot, submitted for publication), could differentially induce the UPR in human neurons, compared to the so-called HCoV-OC43 wild-type, which we obtained several years ago from the ATCC. Two point mutations (H183R and Y241H) identified in the S protein of a HCoV-OC43 variant obtained from persistently infected human neural cell lines were introduced into the HCoV-OC43 genome using our full-length cDNA clone pBAC-OC43FL (St-Jean et al., 2006), yielding a recombinant virus which we designated HCoV-OC43 rOC/US183-241. Before analyzing the effects of these mutations on UPR activation, we sought to determine whether both viruses showed similar kinetics of replication and dissemination in cell culture. The production of extra- and intra-cellular infectious viral particles was evaluated at 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, 24, 48 and 72 h post-infection. No differences in extra-cellular infectious titers were observed between HCoV-OC43 wild-type and HCoV-OC43 rOC/US183-241 (Fig. 3A, left panel). However, a significant increase in the production of intra-cellular infectious viral particles was noted for HCoV-OC43 rOC/US183-241 as compared to HCoV-OC43 wild-type (Fig. 3A, right panel). Moreover, cells infected by HCoV-OC43 rOC/US183-241 produced more viral S proteins, as shown by flow cytometry at 24 h post-infection (Fig. 3C) and by immunofluorescence revealed by microscopic observation (Fig. 3B). We then assessed the percentage of infected cells at 4, 16 and 24 h post-infection by flow cytometry and found that there were no differences between the two viruses in their spread in the neuronal cultures, as the percentage of infected cells was not significantly different (Fig. 3D). Globally, our data indicate that the two viruses have the same capacity to release infectious particles in the cell medium and that their kinetics of dissemination within neuronal cultures were comparable. However, we did observe a significant increase in the amount of viral proteins and infectious viral particles within cells infected by the variant HCoV-OC43 rOC/US183-241.",

During the course of UPR, ATF6 is cleaved within the Golgi, leading to the appearance of ATF6 transcriptional factors, which are translocated to the nucleus where they mainly bind cis-acting ER stress-response element (ERSE) (Okada et al., 2002). As the Grp78 gene is a major target of ATF6 and a central effector of the UPR, its expression was assessed by quantitative real-time PCR to determine the degree of activation of the ATF6 pathway. Infection of neurons with HCoV-OC43 wild-type did not result in any significant modulation of the expression of Grp78 (Fig. 4A). On the other hand, infection with HCoV-OC43 rOC/US183-241 did result in a 3-fold transient increase of Grp78 expression (Fig. 4A). The level of expression of the corresponding GRP78 protein was examined by Western blotting but no significant difference in the expression of the GRP78 protein between mock-infected cells and infected cells by either HCOV-OC43 wild-type or HCoV-OC43 rOC/US183-241 was detected (Fig. 4B). Thapsigargin-treated cells were used a positive control and did demonstrate the capacity of the neuronal cells to express GRP78 following activation of the UPR (Fig. 4B). As Grp78 is the major gene modulated by the ATF6 pathway of the UPR, our data indicate that the ATF6 pathway is functional in the LA-N-5 cells but that it did not play a significant role in the UPR induced by infection with either virus.",

Strikingly, no significant decrease in protein translation was observed following infection by both viruses at 24 h post-infection, as compared to mock-infected cells, as revealed by autoradiographic gel and quantified after TCA precipitation (Fig. 5B and 5C). The three intense bands present only in infected-cells, which likely correspond to the viral S, N and M proteins, showed a stronger expression in cells infected by HCoV-OC43 rOC/US183-241 at 24 h post-infection, which correlates with our observations of intra-cellular infectious viral titers (Fig. 3A), immunofluorescence (Fig. 3B) and flow cytometry (Figs. 3C and D). Thapsigargin-treated cells served as a positive control of protein synthesis inhibition, demonstrating that repression of mRNA translation could indeed occur in neurons. Staining of the gel with Coomassie blue was used as a loading control (data not shown). Altogether, these results suggest that translational repression observed after 24 h post-infection was not a consequence of an activated PERK/eIF2-alpha pathway. Moreover, translation attenuation started only at 72 h post-infection for HCoV-OC43 wild-type, in comparison to 48 h post-infection for HCoV-OC43 rOC/US183-241. These results demonstrate that only two point mutations in the S protein of HCoV-OC43 can result in a different kinetics of total protein synthesis attenuation following infection.",

On the other hand, HCoV-OC43 wild-type infection led to a continuous but lower increase over the course of infection, at least up to 72 h post-infection. This led us to assess the increase of Xbp1(s) mRNA by quantitative PCR, with primers spanning the 26-nucleotide intron (Hirota et al., 2006), and measure the increase of the Xbp1(s) mRNA concurrently to the decrease of the Xbp1(u) form by RT-PCR, with primers flanking the 26-nucleotide intron (Hirota et al., 2006) (Figs. 7A and B). Our results clearly showed a strong increase in the Xbp1(s) form at 24 and 48 h after infection by HCoV-OC43 rOC/US183-241, followed by a subsequent decrease. On the other hand, infection by HCoV-OC43 wild-type resulted in a constant but slower increase in the amount of Xbp1(s) form over the course of the infection, at least up to 72 h post-infection. The kinetics of Xbp1(u) cleavage correlated with the upregulation of expression of the four XBP1-controlled genes that we analyzed after infection by both viruses (Fig. 7A), and indicated an unambiguous activation of the IRE1/XBP1 pathway. Moreover, Western blot analysis confirmed that the expression of the Grp94 gene, which can be under the control of XBP1, led to a significant increase in the amount of its corresponding protein within neurons following infection by HCoV-OC43 rOC/US183-241 (Fig. 7B). Thapsigargin-treated cells were used as a positive control to confirm that the LA-N-5 neurons could indeed be induced to express this protein. Altogether, our data demonstrate again that only two mutations within the S protein of HCoV-OC43 can lead to a different kinetics and amplitude of UPR activation.",

Caspase-3 and nuclear fragmentation are hallmarks of apoptosis and were shown to be induced following virus-induced UPR (Medigeshi et al., 2007). We assayed the activation of caspase-3 by immunofluorescence at 48 h post-infection, a time where we observed the most significant differences in UPR activation and protein synthesis rate between the two viruses (Fig. 8\n). At 48 h post-infection, neurons infected by HCoV-OC43 wild-type did not exhibit significant differences in caspase-3 activation and nuclear fragmentation compared to mock-infected cells. In contrast, most of the neurons infected by HCoV-OC43 rOC/US183-241 showed intense activation of caspase-3, as well as nuclear fragmentation. Indeed, quantification of apoptotic cells support our conclusion that neurons infected by HCoV-OC43 rOC/US183-241 exhibited more nuclear fragmentation than mock-infected or HCoV-OC43-infected cells (Fig. 8B). Cells treated for 24 h with staurosporine, a common apoptosis inducer, served as a positive control. Moreover, cells experiencing intense activation of caspase-3 following HCoV-OC43 rOC/US183-241 infection were also positive for viral antigens and nuclear fragmentation. Altogether, our results showed that HCoV-OC43 rOC/US183-241 induced caspase-3 activation and nuclear fragmentation, two common apoptosis markers, as early as 48 h p.i., whereas HCoV-OC43 wild-type did not show any significant activation of either compared to mock-infected cells.",

Among the global transcriptomic modulation, several genes are associated with the translation machinery, neurotransmission, immunity and cytoskeleton factors. One important group of genes that attracted our attention was related to the biosynthesis and degradation functional group (Fig. 2) and more precisely associated with the process of the unfolded protein response (UPR), which has already been shown to be induced by other coronaviruses, such as MHV (Bechill et al., 2008) and SARS-CoV (Chan et al., 2006, Sung et al., 2009).

Jacomy and P. J. Talbot, submitted for publication). As clearly shown in Fig. 3, the comparison of infectious viral particles production between HCoV-OC43 wild-type and HCoV-OC43 rOC/US183-241 showed that both viruses bear the same capacity to produce extracellular infectious particles and that they disseminated in neuronal culture at the same rate. However, HCoV-OC43 rOC/US183-241 showed a more rapid and intense production of viral proteins and intracellular infectious viral particles. This suggests that discrete molecular viral S determinants could play a role in virus\u2013cell interactions, leading to an increased capacity to produce viral proteins and infectious viral particles. More importantly, the resulting increase in viral proteins present in the ER suggest that the cells might experience a more intense UPR activation in order to cope with an increased ER stress caused by the burden of viral proteins. Therefore, mutations in the S protein of HCoV-OC43, which lead to an increased neurovirulence in mice, induce a different kinetics of UPR activation. Considering that an uncontrolled UPR appears to be associated with neurological diseases (Lindholm et al., 2006, Paschen, 2003), we studied its level of activation following infection by HCoV-OC43 wild-type and HCV-OC43 rOC/US183-241 in human neurons, which are the main target of infection and determined whether these mutations could lead to increased neuronal death (Fig. 9\n).",

Indeed, we showed that HCoV-OC43 infection induced the upregulation of expression of a negative regulator of PERK and PKR activity, P58-ipk, and of a central gene in the ERAD complex, Edem, both solely under the control of XBP1 following activation of the UPR (Lee et al., 2003, Yamamoto et al., 2004). Altogether, these results indicate an unambiguous activation of the IRE1/XBP1 pathway following HCoV-OC43 infection. Indeed, the increase of Xbp1 splicing (Figs. 7A and B) directly correlated with the increased expression of these genes, thus reinforcing our hypothesis of activation of the IRE1/XBP1 pathway. Moreover, HCoV-OC43 rOC/US183-241 induced a more rapid and stronger splicing of Xbp1 mRNA, indicating an increased activation of the IRE1/XBP1 pathway by this virus variant compared to wild-type virus.",

            "text": "On the other hand, we only found a transient level of phosphorylated eIF2-alpha at 24 h post-infection (Fig. 5A), suggesting that the main effector of the PERK/eIF2-alpha pathway, ATF4, might not be efficiently translated following HCoV-OC43 infection, thus suggesting an ATF4-independent induction of the UPR. Moreover, we hypothesize that the increased expression of the cellular inhibitor of PERK P58-ipk, starting at 48 h post-infection, may help explain the absence of phosphorylation of eIF2-alpha at 48 and 72 h post-infection (Fig. 7A). However, even if we were not able to detect any ATF4 protein (Fig. 6B), we observed a significant upregulation of expression of the Gadd34 and Chop genes (Fig. 6A), which are largely considered to be under the control of ATF4. However, although ATF4 plays a major role in the expression of these genes, other factors are known to regulate their expression. ATF3 is a transcriptional factor that has been shown to regulate Gadd34 and Chop gene expression (Haneda et al., 2004, Jiang et al., 2004). Given that our microarray results showed an upregulation of the expression of ATF3 (data not shown), we hypothesize that Gadd34 and Chop might be induced by this transcriptional factor instead of ATF4. Furthermore, the expression of the Chop gene was also shown to be under the control of XBP1 (Lee et al., 2003), which correlates with our results (Fig. 6, Fig. 7). Considering our results showing upregulation of the Edem and P58-ipk genes, solely under XBP1 control (Lee et al., 2003), this adds to the possible involvement of XBP1 in the expression of Chop. The absence of expression of the CHOP protein is striking considering the strong upregulation of Chop mRNA by HCoV\u2011OC43 rOC/US183-241 (Fig. 6A). However, this may suggest a post-transcriptional regulation of the Chop gene in coronavirus infection, as it has already been shown for INF-beta by MHV (Roth-Cross et al., 2007). Altogether, our results indicate that the PERK/eIF2-alpha pathway does not play a significant role in the infection of neuronal cells by HCoV-OC43.",

It is of interest to consider that such attenuation of translation can occur concurrently with increased protein degradation by the ERAD complex. The strong upregulation of Edem (Olivari et al., 2006) and Herp (Kim et al., 2008) gene expression (Fig. 6A), especially after HCoV-OC43 rOC/US183-241 infection might in part explain this phenomenon, as these proteins are associated with protein degradation during the UPR (Figs. 5B and C). Moreover, translational shutoff is a common hallmark preceding cell death, which was also already very strong at 48 h post-infection by the HCoV-OC43 rOC/US183-241 variant, as shown by a viability assay (Fig. 5D) and evaluation of apoptosis induction by caspase-3 activation and nuclear fragmentation (Figs. 8A and B). Thus, considering the strong upregulation of gene expression of Edem and Herp known for their role in protein degradation, the significant activation of caspase-3 and the induction of nuclear fragmentation, we hypothesize that the strong decrease in protein synthesis detected following HCoV-OC43 rOC/US183-241 infection might be the result of an increased protein degradation by the ERAD complex concurrently with initial activation steps of apoptosis.",

            "text": "While deciphering the UPR following a viral infection, one should bear in mind that redundancy between activated and non-activated pathways and compensating mechanisms for transcriptional gene control, may also lie elsewhere than within the three well-known UPR pathways. Indeed, such complex cross-talk between the UPR pathways using knock-out of XBP1 and ATF6 was reported (Lee et al., 2003). This would account for the expression of Grp94, which is under the control of both XBP1 and ATF6, following infection by HCoV-OC43 rOC/US183-241 at both mRNA and protein levels (Figs. 7A and B). Our results indicate that the expression of the Grp78 gene is slightly upregulated, but not to a significant level, as revealed by the absence of the corresponding protein in Western blot analysis (Figs. 4A and B). Interestingly, the knock-out of ATF6 or XBP1 alone was shown to induce a very weak loss of Grp78 expression, showing redundancy between these pathways (Lee et al., 2003). In contrast, other groups showed that XBP1 knock-out only slightly impaired Grp78 expression and that ATF6 is the major inductor of Grp78 (Yamamoto et al., 2004). However, further studies need to be performed in order to decipher the cross-talk between ATF6 and XBP1 pathways. Nevertheless, our results do suggest that the low level of expression of Grp78 mRNA could account for the XBP1 activity, as it weakly induces the ERSE promoter (Yamamoto et al., 2004), and that a full activation of the ATF6 pathway would have led to a strong GRP78 protein expression, as revealed by thapsigargin treatment (Fig. 4A). Therefore, we hypothesize that the ATF6 pathway plays a minor role, if any, in the UPR activated by HCoV-OC43, leading to the absence of upregulation of GRP78 protein and that consequently GRP94 protein expression is likely to account for XBP1 activity.",

Indeed, others have already shown that the S protein of MHV (Versteeg et al., 2007) and SARS-CoV (Chan et al., 2006) or the 8ab protein of SARS-CoV (Sung et al., 2009) can alone induce the UPR and that only the presence or accumulation of the protein is thought to be responsible for the ER stress (Versteeg et al., 2007). Our study clearly reveals that mutations within the S protein of HCoV-OC43 can differentially induce the UPR and lead to a stronger neuronal death by apoptosis, as shown by intense caspase-3 activation and nuclear fragmentation (Figs. 8A and B). Interestingly, IRE1 was linked to the JNK pathway that is involved in apoptosis following the UPR (Urano et al., 2000) and JNK activation can be modulated by other virus, such as HCMV, to cope with cell death (Xuan et al., 2009). One might speculate that the JNK pathway could play a role in the strong neuronal apoptosis induced by HCoV-OC43 rOC/US183-241, as we observed a strong and unambiguous activation of the IRE1/XBP1 pathway. Studies are currently underway to decipher the possible implication of the JNK pathway in our model.",

            "text": "Fig. 9: Model depicting the activation of the normal UPR and possible modulation of the different pathways by the HCoV-OC43 S protein in human neuronal cells. The IRE1/XBP1 pathway is strongly and rapidly activated by the HCoV-OC43 rOC/US183-241 mutant while its activation is less intense and slower by HCoV-OC43 ATCC. Target genes of XBP1, e.g. Grp94, P58-ipk and Edem, are expressed following the appearance of the Xbp1S spliced form. The ATF6 pathway is thought to play a minor role, if any, in the UPR activated by both viruses. Indeed, its well known major target gene, Grp78, is merely expressed and no expression upregulation of the GRP78 protein is observed in both infection. The PERK/eIF2\u03b1 pathway is only transiently activated by both viruses in the first 24 h post-infection although HCoV-OC43 rOC/US183-241 induced a strong translational protein shutoff starting at 48 h post-infection. However, no ATF4 protein was found during the course of infections by both viruses, even though Chop and Gadd34 gene were expressed. This could be explained by the expression of ATF3, also known to regulate their expression. Acronyms.
