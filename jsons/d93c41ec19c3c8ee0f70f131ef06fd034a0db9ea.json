The objective of the study was to explore the role of TRIM62 in reticuloendotheliosis virus (REV) infection and its potential molecular mechanism. We first demonstrated that the REV infection affected the TRIM62 expression first upregulated and then downregulated in CEF cells. Next, we evaluated the effect of TRIM62 on viral replication. Overexpression of TRIM62 decreased REV replication. On the contrary, silencing of endogenously expressed TRIM62 increased viral replication. Then, to explore the necessity of domains in TRIM62's negative regulation on viral replication, we transfected CEF cells with TRIM62 domain deletion mutants. Deletion domain partially abolished TRIM62's antiviral activity. The effect of SPRY domain deletion was the highest and that of coiled-coil was the lowest. Further, we identified 18 proteins that coimmunoprecipitated and interacted with TRIM62 by immunocoprecipitation and mass spectrometry analysis. Strikingly, among which, both Ras-related protein Rab-5b (RAB5B) and Arp2/3 complex 34-kDa subunit (ARPC2) were involved in actin cytoskeletal pathway. Altogether, these results strongly suggest that chicken TRIM62 provides host defense against viral infection, and all domains are required for its action. RAB5B and ARPC2 may play important roles in its negative regulation processes.

RAB5B is an isoform of RAB5, which is a member of the RAB family, a small GTPase family. RAB5B regulates fusion and motility of early endosomes, and is a marker of the early endosome compartment (28) . RAB5B is a major regulator of hepatitis B virus (HBV) production (29) . APRC2 is a component of Arp2/3 complex. The T cell-specific deletion of ARPC2 results in compromised peripheral T cell homeostasis (30) . T cell survival and proliferation are mediated by complex homeostatic signals. Peripheral T cells are maintained at a constant cell number so that they can efficiently recognize foreign antigens and protect the host from pathogen invasion (31) . Thus, of the TRIM62-interacting cell proteins identified, we focused on RAB5B and ARPC2. The interaction between RAB5B/ARPC2 and TRIM62 indicated that they played important roles in TRIM62 negative regulation on REV replication. A detailed understanding of host restriction may lead to antiviral therapies aimed at strengthening the innate immunity to retroviruses at the cellular and molecular level.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 75, "end": 79, "text": "(18,", "ref_id": "BIBREF17"}, {"start": 80, "end": 83, "text": "26,", "ref_id": "BIBREF25"}, {"start": 84, "end": 87, "text": "27)", "ref_id": "BIBREF26"}, {"start": 285, "end": 289, "text": "(28)", "ref_id": "BIBREF27"}, {"start": 357, "end": 361, "text": "(29)", "ref_id": "BIBREF28"}, {"start": 495, "end": 499, "text": "(30)", "ref_id": "BIBREF29"}, {"start": 741, "end": 745, "text": "(31)", "ref_id": "BIBREF31"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "DISCUSSION"}, {"text": "In addition, TRIM62 is a putative tumor suppressor and the TRIM62 levels represent an important prognostic marker in lung tumor (32) acute myeloid leukemia (AML) (33) and cervical cancer (34) .
