            "text": "The yeast two-hybrid (Y2H) method was originally developed by Stanley Fields and is a genetic method to detect binary protein\u2013protein interactions (PPIs) (1). It exploits the modularity of eukaryotic transcription factors and the ease of genetic engineering of the yeast, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, to monitor PPIs. A bait protein is fused to the DNA-binding domain (DBD) and a prey protein is fused to the activation domain (AD) of a transcriptional activator, often the yeast Gal4 protein. The term \u201ctwo-hybrid\u201d is based on these two chimeric proteins. The bait and prey fusions are co-expressed in yeast and upon physical interaction between the bait and prey protein, the functional transcription factor (TF) is reconstituted. This results in the activation of a reporter gene, which allows either growth under selective conditions or produces a color or fluorescence signal (auxotrophic yeast strain, lacZ, or GFP reporter gene).",

This has two major advantages compared to the library screen approach:\nEach prey is arrayed on an individual position. Thus, the interacting prey can be simply identified by the matrix position and additional identification steps of the interacting prey by a colony PCR and sequencing reactions are obsolete.Array screens can be automated by using a replication robot.\n",

As for any other detection method, it is almost impossible to detect all physiologically occurring interactants of every screened bait protein. Apart from effects that originate in the heterogenic yeast expression system, e.g., due to a lack of posttranslational modifications, false-negative interactions can be partly traced back to steric hindrance effects due to the used fusion tags. They can prevent physical interactions by covering the respective interaction sites or preventing subsequent transcriptional activation.",

            "text": "Most Y2H vector systems use N-terminally fused test domains, but this can avoid any interactions which involve regions around the N-terminus of these proteins. Thus, we developed C-terminal fusions of the DNA-binding and activation domains and also tested pairwise combinations of N- and C-terminal fusions (2, 3). Stellberger et al. (2) tested all pairwise interactions among the \u223c70 ORFs of the Varicella Zoster Virus using both N- and C-terminal vectors as well as combinations thereof (Fig. 1). About \u223c20,000 individual Y2H tests resulted in 182 NN, 90 NC, 151 CN, and 146 CC interactions (Fig. 2). Overlaps between screens ranged from 17% (NC\u2013CN) to 43% (CN\u2013CC). Performing four screens (i.e., permutations) instead of one resulted in about twice as many PPIs, and thus fewer false-negatives. Different vector combinations show unique, as well as overlapping PPI-data, supporting the impact of steric hindrance and the need of free termini for a subfraction of PPIs (Fig. 3).\n\n\n",

Alternatively, the stock solutions can be frozen as aliquots at \u221220\u00b0C for long time storage.1-Well plates are available from NUNC (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Prepared agar plates should be stored for 1\u20132 days with closed lid under a sterile hood before use. Fresh solidified media is often wet and cannot be used directly.Medium concentrate can be stored at 4\u00b0C up to 6 months.Some components of the medium concentrate (e.g., amino acids) are not well soluble in water. The solution has to be stirred before the filtration step for up to 5 h until all components are dissolved. Heating is not recommended because of the heat sensitivity of amino acids.Selection media may differ due to the used Y2H expression vector system and have to be adapted. For instance, in the pDEST32/pDEST22 system the selection markers for baits and preys are interchanged (baits are selected on -Leu and preys on -Trp) while selection of pGBKT7g/pGBKCg baits is done on -Trp. pGADT7g/pGADCg preys must be selected on -Leu medium.CT110 has to be prepared freshly before yeast transfection and should not be stored.Sodium hypochlorite solution is not very stable and has to be freshly prepared. Alternatively, other disinfection solutions with a bleaching effect can be used. We do not recommend to use a final concentrations higher than 2.4% since the steel pins of the replication tool might stain.Yeast on agar medium can be stored for \u223c2 months at 4\u00b0C. The plates should be sealed with a sealing film to avoid drying-out. Baits and preys should be stored on the corresponding selective media since loss of plasmids can occur on nonselective medium.Sterilization steps have to be established for the robotic system and sterilization solutions that are used. For instance, the minimal time required for sterilization should be tested in advance since this will speed up the whole screen. However, it must be ensured that no cross-contamination occurs.The needed baits and prey arrays can also be used for the mating procedure when grown on/in selective medium. To our knowledge this does not influence the mating efficiency much but we recommend using YEPD medium since yeast grows faster and higher cell numbers can be achieved.Adenine achieves a higher mating efficiency. Many yeast strains (e.g., AH109 and Y187) are deficient in synthesizing adenine since they can carry an additional adenine selection marker.After transfer from the liquid culture allow the plates to dry for 10\u201330 min. The positions should be dry when the preys are copied onto the bait spots. Also the plate should be checked if enough bait cells were transferred. Reasonable amounts were transferred when each spot occurs cloudy. This is critical for a good mating efficiency.Thick pins can be used as well. We use thin pins since more replication steps can be done from a single source plate. If only a replication tool with thick pins is available more prey array plates have to be prepared since only a couple of transfer steps can be done because of source plate depletion.This step is an essential control step because only diploid cells containing the Leu2 and Trp1 marker on the prey and bait vectors will grow on this medium. It also leads to an amplification of diploid cells, which increases the efficiency of the next selection step.We normally score interactions after 7 days. But the plates should be examined every day. Most two-hybrid positive \u00adcolonies appear within 3\u20135 days, but occasionally positive interactions can be observed later. Very small colonies are usually designated as background; however, there is no absolute measure to distinguish between the background and real positives. When there are many (i.e., >30) large colonies per array of 6,000 positions, we consider these baits as \u201crandom\u201d activators. In this case, the screen should be repeated to ensure that these positives are reproducible (unless the screen is done already in duplicate or quadruplicate).Pinning the retest onto readout medium with various concentrations 3-AT can be used to semi-quantify interactions. This helps, e.g., to distinguish between \u201cstrong\u201d and \u201cweak\u201d signals and might also help to separate spurious ones.\n",
