            "text": "We conducted a retrospective cohort review of patients who received services from the hospital's CCLS from June 7, 2017, to July 25, 2018 . Inclusion criteria were all patients ages 6-18 years old who received a Child Life intervention. Patients were excluded from analysis if preintervention or postintervention cooperation data was missing (Table 1) . Patient information was obtained through a customized report created from the electronic medical record (EMR). The IRB granted a waiver of approval for this study. This study adhered to the Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology guidelines for case-control studies. 24 The integration of VR into the hospital was a collaboration between the Stanford Chariot Program and the Child Life and Creative Arts Department. The Chariot Program is funded through philanthropic donations and is composed of a multidisciplinary group of pediatric anesthesiologists, pediatric pain physicians, and research scientists. The Chariot Program utilized a 3-step approach to develop the hospital's VR program: (1) software development; (2) hardware modification; and (3) integration into clinical care. Although there exists VR content that is commercially available for purchase, the Chariot Program developed and customized several VR applications specifically for pediatric patients. Developed content was nonviolent, was intuitive for the user to learn, had limited startup menus to ensure rapid access and immediate gameplay, utilized third-person rather than the first-person perspective, kept the head mostly or entirely still, and had no fail-states (eg, the user's character cannot die or become incapacitated in any way). In some circumstances, the content was complementary to patient care; for example, content that kept the head still and paired the headset with a handheld controller could be used for ENT endoscopy, whereas gameplay designed to keep the extremities still and instead use slight head movement could be used for intravenous access or orthopedic procedures. We organized this VR content on a customized VR interface, also produced by Chariot, which curates a content library while also prohibiting typical cellular phone features such as access to the internet (this is simply a safety measure to ensure children cannot access anything besides what is intended by providers). Samsung (Seoul, South Korea) GearVR headsets fitted with Samsung S8+ cellular phones were used to display the VR interface and applications. Customized head straps were designed with 3D-printed attachments and commercially available ratchets to ensure infection control compliance and fit to pediatric head circumferences.",

The physician Chariot Program Manager trained CCLS with an emphasis on sanitization procedures and a process for securing the device while not in use. Locked cabinets were used to store the devices in areas convenient for the users. Within these locked cabinets, we used a Samsung Wireless Charging station to charge the devices. CCLS were additionally trained by the physician Chariot Program Manager to assess potential adverse events during VR interventions. Patients were evaluated by trained CCLS, who made individualized treatment plans based on a repository of tools available to them. Potential VR patient candidates were 6 years or older without a history of seizure or motion sickness. After screening patients, CCLS introduced VR as a possible coping mechanism and, with patient agreement, proceeded to utilize it. A variety of active and passive applications were offered, and the patient had the option to choose their own experience. The individualized interventions were not controlled, as this was a retrospective review.",

CCLS also documented which coping interventions the patient underwent, including family presence, comfort positioning, diaphragmatic breathing, environmental adaptions, imagery, pharmacologic assistance, tablet, bedside entertainment theater, 25 VR, augmented reality, interactive video game, and/or movie. Age, gender, adverse events, patient location, and interventions accompanying VR were also measured through a chart review of the CCLS intervention note. Adverse events were reported in the EMR if observed by CCLS or stated by the patient. Although there was no standardized questioning of adverse events, as that was outside the scope of this retrospective review, CCLS were thoroughly trained to ascertain and report the presence of adverse events adequately. Patients were analyzed in 3 groups. The first group included patients who received any coping intervention, even those without VR. The second group included patients who underwent a VR coping intervention, with or without an accompanying intervention. Patients in the third group underwent a VR coping intervention only and did not experience any accompanying intervention. All groups were guided by CCLS.",

The primary hypothesis was that postintervention cooperation rates would be significantly higher than preintervention cooperation rates. Furthermore, we conducted 2 subgroup analyses to determine whether postintervention cooperation rates were increased in both younger and older children, and children of both sexes. We hypothesized that postintervention cooperation rates would be higher than preintervention cooperation rates irrespective of age and sex. Because we conducted 2 subgroup analyses (with 2 hypotheses each), as well as 1 primary analysis (comparing preintervention and postintervention cooperation rates overall), P values were the Bonferroni corrected for the 5 hypotheses. The P values for changes in cooperation were calculated using McNemar's test, given the binary and repeated nature of the outcome (cooperation with induction). A corrected P value of <0.05 was used as the threshold for significance.",

The use of VR is not intended for all patients and was only charted in about 5% of patients seen by CCLS.

For example, all the VR experiences maintain a third-person rather than the first-person point of view, because the first-person point of view is more likely to contribute to motion sickness. 28 The content additionally limits the head range of motion, especially flexion and extension of the neck, to reduce vestibular motion. Patients are also typically not moving around during VR use. They are interacting with a carefully designed VR world that helps to prevent the motion sickness that may be more common during the use of commercial VR systems.",

The CCLS rarely used VR as a standalone intervention. Instead, it was usually complemented by other interventions, including diaphragmatic breathing, family presence, pharmacological assistance, environmental adaptations, and video games. When VR was used alone, VR was provided to patients who were cooperative before the CCLS encounter. VR often requires a cooperative patient who is willing to wear a headset and suspend belief to partake in a VR environment. Although it appears that younger patients (age 6 to 12 years old) were more likely to benefit from VR, this analysis was exploratory and not powered to detect subgroups that may respond more or less robustly to VR. Although the increases in cooperation may seem like small absolute differences, an improvement, however, small, in cooperation is not what would be anticipated. Generally speaking, when facing imminent medical interventions, most pediatric patients become less cooperative and may withdraw from the intervention. Maintenance or improvement of patient cooperation is clinically significant, in our opinion.",

            "text": "Limitations of this study included its lack of control group, as is common in retrospective reviews. Another limitation of retrospective reviews regarding the effectiveness of an intervention is that a before-and-after design time series is susceptible to the Hawthorne effect. Although time-series event data were out of the scope of this study, future studies should collect data over time to understand variation in data over time, including common versus special cause variation. The patient cooperativity scale was subjectively rated by CCLS. There also is the possibility of selection bias, because CCLS did not randomize patients to interventions but instead applied evaluation criteria, judgment, and expertise in selecting the appropriate intervention for each patient. Given that this is a retrospective study, we have no reason to suspect that CCLS skewed the results since the CCLS was unaware of the forthcoming study during data collection. Additionally, as this is a large study relying on point-of-care providers, it would be extremely challenging to integrate into the EMR validated outcome measures of cooperativity. Our approach of using surrogates, such as self-reported measures in large numbers, is not ideal but provides initial evidence with a large sample size that can be corroborated by smaller studies using validated outcome measures. Because CCLS reported adverse events without a standardized set of questions asked of patients, there may have been adverse events not observed by CCLS or verbalized by patients. Some patients were excluded from the analysis because they lacked complete data. Our findings examining the efficacy of VR interventions are exploratory, and the present study was not powered to compare the effectiveness of VR to existing interventions. As VR appears to be a safe intervention, future studies should quantify the efficacy of VR compared to other existing interventions and aim to uncover specific subpopulations for which VR is most effective. Finally, we were unable to capture patients who used VR outside of CCLS due to the lack of an electronic charting entry field for other healthcare providers who use VR at our institution, including physicians, nurses, volunteers, or rehabilitation services.",
