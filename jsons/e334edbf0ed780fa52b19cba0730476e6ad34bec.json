The ISAAC study 2 is a world-wide, questionnaire-based, multicentre study of the prevalence of asthma, allergic rhinitis and atopic dermatitis in 463,801 children aged 13-14 years from 155 centres in 56 countries. The countries with the highest prevalence of asthma symptoms are the UK, Australia, New Zealand and the Republic of Ireland, followed by North, Central and South America; the lowest prevalences are found in Eastern Europe, Indonesia, Greece, China, Taiwan, Uzbekistan, India and Ethiopia. There was a 20-fold difference (1.6-36.8%) reported between centres with the highest and lowest rates and an 8-fold variation between the 10th and 90th centiles (3.9-30.6%).",

Ball et al 6 investigated 1035 children as part of the Tucson Children's Respiratory Study.

Of course such infections are themselves associated with significant morbidity and mortality, and this has been dramatically reduced by preventive strategies such as improvements in public health and measles vaccination. It is possible that some infections help the immune system to mature from an early predominantly Th2-biased state 19 towards a Th1-biased state and that in their absence, in individuals predisposed by genetic or additional environmental factors such as allergen exposure or maternal cigarette smoking, that this fails to happen. The consequence is atopic disease, including asthma, characterised by inflammation with a Th2 phenotype. The use of immunomodulatory drugs 20 to inhibit Th2 cell function may help to deviate the immune system away from a state where atopic disease and asthma are likely to develop. Such a strategy would require the identification of individuals at high risk and treatment in early life. There are significant ethical problems in human trials of such drugs in infants and young children, and the possible harmful effects of immune deviation are unknown.",

A total of 1246 newborn babies were recruited and studied in the first 6 years of life. Those children who suffered wheezing early in life before age 3 years could be divided into two groups. Persistent wheezers (those who still had episodes of wheezing at age 6 years) had higher levels of IgE, higher prevalence of atopic dermatitis and a higher prevalence of maternal asthma. Transient wheezers (those without wheezing by age 6 years) were more likely to have small airways and impaired lung function at birth rather than factors associated with atopy. Differences were observed between these two groups in the response at the time of the first infective wheezing episode, which occurred at around 1 year and which was due to RSV in two-thirds of episodes. Persistent wheezers showed an increase in serum IgE not seen in transient wheezers. Eosinopenia was observed in transient wheezers and in children with lower respiratory tract illness without wheezing; eosinophil counts were maintained in persistent wheezers. Such episodes were also observed to be more severe in persistent wheezers. It has been suggested that persistent wheezers will, therefore, be over-represented in studies of children hospitalised with RSV infection, and this may explain why such studies show such a strong association with subsequent asthma 27 .",

It is likely that additional viruses exist, but have not yet been identified. A recent study of children in The Netherlands has identified a new human metapneumovirus 36 causing symptoms similar to RSV ranging from upper respiratory tract disease to severe bronchiolitis and pneumonia. Serology demonstrated that human metapneumovirus has been circulating in humans for at least 50 years and that virtually all children in The Netherlands have been exposed to this virus. Viral respiratory tract infections are a major cause of wheezing in infants and children. Their role may have been underestimated in early epidemiological studies because of difficulties in isolation and identification 37 . Studies carried out in the 1970s and 1980s were limited to viral culture and serology, and did not always include sensitive methods for detection of rhinoviruses and coronaviruses. The introduction of molecular biology techniques (RT-PCR) to such studies has implicated viral infection in the majority of asthma exacerbations.",

Although the possibility of nasopharyngeal contamination cannot be ruled out, rhinovirus has been detected in lower airway clinical specimens such as sputum 49 , tracheal brushings 65 , and BAL 66 by both RT-PCR and culture. Rhinovirus has been cultured in cell lines of bronchial epithelial cell origin 67 and replication has been demonstrated in primary cultures of bronchial epithelial cells 68, 69 . Finally, the use of in situ hybridisation has demonstrated rhinovirus in bronchial biopsies of subjects following experimental infection 68 .

The detailed immunological mechanisms underlying this interaction are currently unclear. The disease syndrome following infection by virus is a consequence both of direct harmful effects of the virus itself and of immunopathology resulting from the host immune response, some of which may be unavoidable if the virus is to be eliminated. In an asthmatic individual, exacerbation may occur because of functional interaction between viral pathology and asthmatic pathology (i.e. through different mechanisms with the same end effect on function), or by sharing the same pathogenetic mechanism in an additive or even in a synergistic fashion. Pre-existing asthmatic inflammation might interfere with an effective antiviral response and thus allow the virus itself to cause increased airway damage. Alternatively, virus infection might increase the sensitivity of the asthmatic airway to trigger factors such as allergen exposure. In fact, it is likely that virus-induced asthma exacerbations occur because of a combination of these four types of interaction.",

Efficient clearance of virus is orchestrated by antibodies and by T-cells producing type 1 cytokines. The asthmatic airway is rich in type 2 cytokines and this may result in virus-specific T cells with type 2 or mixed type 1/type 2 character. If this is the case, then virus infection could be followed by both an inefficient antiviral immune response with delayed viral clearance and by amplification of on-going asthmatic inflammation; the consequence of this interaction is severe, often prolonged viral illness and exacerbation of asthma.",
