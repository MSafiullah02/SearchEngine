Despite problems of reporter bias and illegitimacy in the numerous pedigrees studied,1, 5, 6 the pattern of inheritance suggested that HPA was a Y-linked trait. This was until a 2004 study7 utilised contemporary Y-chromosome haplogroup classification to show that no single haplogroup predominated in the HPA cases, thus making it unlikely to be Y linked and more likely to be an autosomal trait with phenotypic expression limited to males.",

Whereas humans possess a single copy of SRY on the Y, normotensive experimental rats carry multiple highly similar copies.28 Sequencing techniques show the presence of an additional SRY3 copy in the SHR,29, 30 containing a proline-to-threonine amino acid substitution at position 76.30 Importantly, SRY is a transcription factor that, in synergy with androgen receptor and in a testosterone-dependent manner,30 regulates promoter regions for genes encoding angiotensinogen, renin, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) and ACE229 \u2013 known for their key roles in blood pressure regulation. The threonine point mutation in SRY3 has been shown to reduce SRY3 promoter regulation,30 leading to an increase in transcription of angiotensinogen, renin and ACE, thus promoting formation of the vasoconstrictor angiotensin II (Ang II); in contrast, SRY3 has an inhibitory effect on ACE2 transcription, the enzyme important for formation of vasodilatory and blood pressure-lowering Ang-(1\u20137).29 Experimental delivery of SRY3 to normotensive rat kidneys raises blood pressure,30, 31 a rise that can be prevented by concomitant administration of olmesartan, a renin\u2013angiotensin\u2013aldosterone system (RAAS) inhibitor.30 The in silico analysis and transfection studies of Chinese Hamster Ovary cells show that the SRY X paralogue (SOX3) is also capable of influencing RAAS gene expression, although in vivo SOX3 is primarily transcribed in non-kidney tissues.32 This suggests that the SRY paralogue is unique in its pro-hypertensive effects in male rats.",

A recent prospective study conducted in Cypriot men (in whom prevalence of haplogroup I is estimated at 2.4%) associated haplogroup K with a more than twofold increased risk of atherosclerotic plaque occurrence in the carotid and femoral artery bifurcations compared with all other haplogroups.50 Systolic blood pressure was also associated with haplogroup K in this analysis and was proposed as a potential intermediate phenotype of the identified association.50 In contrast, Haitjema et al51 studied histological vessel wall characteristics of Dutch patients who had undergone carotid endarterectomy or open aneurysmal repair, but found no significant differences in vessel wall characteristics including leukocyte infiltration, lipid, collagen and smooth muscle content between the major haplogroups present (including I with prevalence 24\u201328%). Caution should be exercised when interpreting the data from this analysis with the results of the previous study on CAD given the obvious differences between the mechanisms of CAD, carotid artery disease and abdominal aortic aneurysms.51",

Indeed, although protein sequence analysis would suggest the high degree of JmjC sequence similarity between UTY and the functional KDMs (Figure 3), there is some conflict in the literature regarding whether UTY inherently possesses histone demethylase activity. UTX knockout experiments in mice embryos suggest that UTY exhibits redundancy for UTX activity.59 Follow-up in vivo analysis, however, found that both mouse and human UTY lacked inherent histone demethylase activity, suggesting that biological functions of UTY (and UTX) may be at least partly independent of the demethylase region.59 In contrast, a different group conducted in vitro analysis revealing conserved UTY histone demethylase activity, although reduced compared with UTX.60 Based on studies conducted to date, UTY appears capable of regulating gene expression, possibly (at least in part) via histone demethylation. It is tempting to speculate that altered UTY expression in carriers of haplogroup I may contribute to the observed changes in their macrophage expression of inflammatory and immune pathways. This will require further studies, in particular given the evidence for another Y gene (KDM5D, formerly known as SMCY) to exhibit histone H3 Lysine 4 (H3K4) demethylase activity21 and play a role in immunological complications of stem cell transplantation.62",

In particular, the evidence suggests the Y chromosome can be a powerful determinant of male immunity, including autoimmunity. We therefore propose studies to determine associations between Y-chromosome haplogroup and autoimmune disorders (such as rheumatoid arthritis), many of which exhibit sexual dimorphisms.64",

In the original British cohorts, two haplogroups predominated \u2013 R1b1b2 (70.0\u201372.7%) and I (14.5\u201317.0%).44 Although the elevated CAD risk associated with haplogroup I was attributed to haplogroup I posing increased susceptibility, an alternative interpretation of the results could be that the main non-I haplogroup (R1b1b2) offered protection against CAD. The uncertainty regarding precise identification of the causal haplogroup is exacerbated by two haplogroups accounting for nearly 90% of the cohort. Analyses of populations of different ethnicities (such as East Asians) with greater haplogroup diversity and an absence of haplogroup I13 would enable greater understanding of the specific cause for the altered CAD risk. If an association was found between haplogroup R (the clade containing R1b1b2 as a subtype) and reduced CAD risk in such a population, this would suggest that rather than haplogroup I elevating CAD risk, the causal factor for the original association was haplogroup R1b1b2-mediated protection against CAD. In contrast, an association between a haplogroup completely absent in Europe (eg, O) and CAD in East Asians would imply a greater range of unique genetic variants underpinning Y-mediated CAD risk. By analysing the locations of these variants, particular Y genes likely to have altered expression (variants within promoter sites) or altered molecular function of encoded proteins (variants within exon sequences) could be identified.",

This should involve extensive RNA sequencing of a wide range of target immune cells and tissues involved in CAD pathogenesis (such as dendritic cells, T and B lymphocytes) to provide much needed insight into the expression of all MSY protein-coding genes and their influence on underlying inflammatory and immune responses. Furthermore, the functional roles of Y-chromosome long noncoding RNAs and pseudogenes, especially within control of genetic regulation, remain largely unexplored.65 It is anticipated that examination of Y non-protein-coding elements within the broader ENCODE project will identify potential functional pathways mediating the associations between the Y and disease.",

One of the strongest pieces of evidence is the association between haplogroup I and increased CAD risk, in the context of inflammation and immunity. Future endeavours will need to concentrate on identifying specific MSY genes that directly influence inflammatory and adaptive immunity processes within atherosclerosis. The identification of 12 X\u2013Y dosage-sensitive gene pairs has refined our focus for future studies. Three of these pairs warrant further attention given their prior associations with haplogroup I and/or immune processes: UTY/UTX, PRKY/PRKX and KDM5D/KDM5C, with UTY being the most promising functional candidate.",
