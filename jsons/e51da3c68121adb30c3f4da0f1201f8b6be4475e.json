Such developments will allow us to provide immediate and specific intervention and monitor the progress before it cascades into chronic inflammation and malignancy. To fulfill this objective, it requires the development of technologies of 1-100 nm size, which display unique mechanical, electrical, chemical, and optical properties and assist in visualizing or interacting with receptors, cytoskeleton, specific organelles and nuclear components within the cells. It will be very rewarding when many of these technologies can migrate into monitoring the disease condition through non-invasive methods in vivo in a physically undisturbed state, thus minimizing the influence of artifacts induced by physical methods while securing biological samples.",

The ultimate goal of nanomedicine is to develop well-engineered nanotools for the prevention, diagnosis and treatment of many diseases. In the past decade, extraordinary growth in nanotechnology has brought us closer to being able to vividly visualize molecular and cellular structures. These technologies are beginning to assist us in our ability to differentiate between normal and abnormal cells and to detect and quantify minute amounts of signature molecules produced by these cells. Most of these represent real time measurements, relating to the dynamic relationship among structures in the damaged area and also to repair of damaged tissues. Novel pharmaceutical preparations have been developed to fabricate nanovehicles to deliver drugs, proteins and genes, contrast enhancement agents for imaging, and hyperthermia agents to kill cancer cells. Several of these inventions have already transitioned into basic medical research and clinical applications. Because of this, some social, ethical, legal and environmental issues have emerged. Thus, regulatory and educational strategy needs to be developed for the society to gain benefit from these discoveries. The focus of this chapter is to provide an overview of the state-of-the-art in nanotechnology with particular reference to detecting and treating inflammation and cancer at the earliest settings.",

These devices, systems and functionalized structures contain unique properties as a result of their nanosize. For example, gold nanoparticles and carbon nanotubes possess different properties [7] at the micron scale. Semiconductor particles exemplified by quantum dots exhibit quantum confinement effects, hence they fluoresce at various wavelengths compared to the semiconductor particles at micron size which do not exhibit the same optical or magnetic properties [8] . Macromolecular structures such as dendrimers and liposomes at the nanoscale are also considered valid nanotools [9] , while biological molecules of nanometer size in their native state such as DNA and monoclonal antibodies are not examples of \"Nanotools\". Thus, nanometer size is of critical importance to the cell and the living organisms. Interestingly, fabricated nanoscale devices are of the same size as subcellular organelles. Some nanoscale structures are of the order of enzymes, receptors and key molecules within the cell membrane or cytoplasm. For example, the lipid bilayer surrounding cells is 6 nm and hemoglobin is 5 nm in size. By modifying the surface chemistry of these nanostructures, which permits covalent or ligand-receptor (lock-key-type) or electrostatic interaction with key molecules, we can identify biomolecules on the cell surface and in the cytoplasm. An advantage of this will be our ability to map the transport of those molecules from the cytoplasm across the cell membrane so we can understand the cellular behavior in health and disease. Nanoparticles smaller than 20 nm can pass through blood vessel walls [10] , which opens opportunities of diagnostic imaging and targeted delivery of drugs when non-toxic nanoparticles are used. What is critical for scientists engaged in inflammation science and engineering is that these technologies should be applicable to detect or monitor:",

This bending deflection is proportional to the quantity of binding, thus making it a quantitative technique. Multiple cantilevers can be used simultaneously to differentiate between bound and unbound molecules. Likewise, multiple antibodies can be used in the same reaction set up to quantify several markers at a time. An important advantage of this technique is that there is no need to add fluorescent tags to detect and quantify the molecule. Any biological sample containing biomolecules of interest can be tested.

They are emerging as a new class of biological probes that could replace traditional organic dyes and fluorescent proteins. The fundamental benefit of using QDs is the high quantum yield and strong emission intensity. The emission spectrum of QDs is a function of the particle size, and hence by varying particle size QDs can emit from visible to infrared wavelengths [25] . They can be excited by UV light. Their broad excitation spectrum and narrow emission spectrum with little or no spectral overlap makes them attractive for imaging and resolving multiple species at the same time without complex optics and data acquisition systems. QDs offer higher signal to noise ratios compared to traditional fluorochromes. Their high sensitivity allows accurate detection even in the presence of strong autofluorescence signals encountered during in vivo imaging [26] . Their excellent resistance to photobleaching is particularly useful for long-term monitoring of biological phenomena, critical in live cell imaging and thick tissue specimens. Already QDs are finding increasing use in live cell imaging, by themselves or as fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) donors combined with traditional fluorchromes, and in in vitro assays and live animal imaging for cancer and tumor diagnostics.",

To render this inorganic structure hydrophilic, amphiphilic polymers are used to cap the shell layer and provide reactive sites for further linking to proteins. It is, therefore, the stability of this layer that controls the aggregation of QDs, as well as possible release of core materials (Cd ions) to their surroundings, which may result in toxicity [27] . This has limited the immediate clinical use of QDs, but has focused applications to animal testing and in vitro assay developments. Another reported problem is the blinking property of the QDs. QDs tends to blink at the single dot level and hence present some limitation in absolute fluorescence quantification. However, when used for imaging of biomarkers, this property does not have much of an effect as there are hundreds or thousands of QDs in a sample to allow proper averaging.",

Traditional MRI agents rely on the interaction of the proton density, i.e., water molecules and the magnetic properties of the tissue. These paramagnetic agents accelerate the rate of relaxation of protons in the longitudinal direction, resulting in bright images, and hence are highly dependent on water molecules. However, the super paramagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles, by the virtue of their nanoscale properties, disturb the magnetic field independently of their environment, and hence are not dependent on presence of water molecules. They are also called negative enhancers as they act as negative contrast agents and appear dark where they are sequestered. The traditional MR agents such as gadolinium-diethylenetriamine penta-acetic acid (DTPA) enhance the signal from the vascular compartments and are nonspecific, whereas the nanoparticle-based contrast agents impact the MR signal from tissues and cells.",

The advantage of these contrast agents lies in their ability to get sequestered anywhere within a support matrix and still generate a contrast, whereas the traditional MR agents need water in their vicinity of generate contrast. These nanoparticles can be used for both passive and active targeting. Because of the small size of these particles, tissue macrophages readily take up these agents, and hence it is possible to image liver, spleen, lymph nodes, and lungs. In addition, it is also possible to functionalize these nanoparticles using a wide variety of ligands, antibodies, peptides, aptamers, drugs, etc., to achieve site-specific or biomarker-specific targeting. This is an added advantage since traditional paramagnetic formulations are difficult to conjugate to antibodies, and even when conjugated, owing to the small number of cellular receptors, the signal intensity is not sufficient for accu-rate imaging. Thus, as a result of their superparamagnetic properties, iron oxide nanoparticles have been used as contrast agent for imaging of cancer, brain inflammation, arthritis, and atherosclerotic plaques. Because of the small size, these iron oxide particles have been able to distinguish between the normal and tumor-bearing lymphatic nodes [28] . These nanoparticles may also distinguish very small metastases (less than 2 mm in diameter) within normal lymph nodes, a size well below the detection limit of the most sensitive imaging techniques such as positron-emission tomography (PET) available today. Using cells loaded with iron oxide nanoparticles, it has been shown that these particles are non toxic and are cleared from the cell after five to eight divisions. Lewin et al. [29] labeled stem cells with iron oxide particles using HIV TAT peptide and injected them systemically. The labeled stem cells homed on to the bone marrow, and the labeled stem cells did not cause any impairment. However, due to the small size of these particles, a long time is required (up to 24 h) to clear them from the organs and blood to reduce background signals. Thus, MRI using SPIOs may result in improved sensitivity and selectivity, and may assist diagnosis of tumors at the earliest stages of malignancy or metastasis.",

Nanotechnology has already made significant inroads into the problems of improving delivery of injectibles, oral formulations, drug device implants, and topical and transdermal delivery of drugs. More is expected from nanotechnology in improving the delivery of drugs to the brain, as many of the formulations aimed at treating diseases of the brain fail to cross the blood-brain barrier. Various methods have been tested for drug delivery. For example, carbon-based materials, nanostructures, silicone-based materials, polymers and liposomes, which are capable of delivering drug molecules directly into cells, tumors and sites of inflammation either actively or passively. There is no question that there are many limitations such as opsonization, problems with encapsulation and leakiness of drug that needs to be tackled. Some of these obstacles have been overcome by the development of agents like \"stealth liposomes\", which escape attack by the immune system. Thus, nanotechnology is expanding our capabilities through promising approaches for delivery of therapeutic agents.",

It is now known that liposomal targeting can be achieved by passive targeting or active targeting. Passive targeting is achieved in both inflammatory and cancerous conditions taking advantage of the leakiness caused by many vascular factors that enhance permeability. This opens up a window of opportunity to increase the drug delivery, with accumulation of drug at higher concentration at the targeted site by extravasation, thereby reducing toxicity and collateral damage. On the other hand, active targeting depends on certain unique properties and molecular strategies involving monoclonal antibody-liposomal conjugates (immunoliposomes), which enables specific tumor cell targeting by antigen identification and drug delivery by internalization of the liposome by tumor cells [54] . Promising examples are the enhanced anti-tumor activity of anti-HER2 immunoliposomes containing doxorubicin [55] , and the use of anti-epidermal growth factor receptor (anti-EGFR) immunoliposome, which showed increased cytotoxic effect in vitro against tumor cells overexpressing EGFR and enhanced efficacy in vivo in xenograft models [56] .

Utilizing the lymphotropic properties of these nanoparticles, Weissleder and colleagues [78] showed that superparamagnetic nanoparticle enhanced high-resolution MRI. It was far superior to conventional high-resolution MRI in detecting clinically occult prostatic cancer metastasis to lymph nodes. The combined use of QDs with superoxide paramag-netic crystals may provide additional information by targeting specific molecular targets for imaging [79] . A particularly interesting application is the use of SPIO particles for the study of nucleic acid sequences and surface topography of subcellular organelles. This is achieved by a modified AFM with a nanoneedle mounted on a cantilever beam that deflects when it comes in contact with a paramagnetic nanoparticle. This response can be quantified and mapped [80] .",

These discoveries have led to the development of powerful tools for fundamental biological and medical research. Nanotechnology has been applied to targeted drug delivery to minimize side effects, creating implantable materials as scaffolds for tissue engineering, creating implantable devices, surgical aids and nanorobotics, as well as throughput drug screening and medical diagnostic imaging. The nanoinitiatives are funded by governments and private sources throughout the world to develop or further refine the technology to provide the beyond-imag-170 inable, most sophisticated tools to a physician and scientists to inflammatory diseases.
