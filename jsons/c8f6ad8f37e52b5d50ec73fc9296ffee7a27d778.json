            "text": "Significant concerns have arisen over the past 3 y from the increased global spread of the mosquitoborne flavivirus, Zika. Accompanying this spread has been an increase in cases of the devastating birth defect microcephaly as well as of Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome in adults in many affected countries. Currently there is no vaccine or therapy for this infection; however, we sought to develop a combination approach that provides more rapid and durable protection than traditional vaccination alone. A novel immune-based prophylaxis/therapy strategy entailing the facilitated delivery of a synthetic DNA consensus prME vaccine along with DNA-encoded anti-ZIKV envelope monoclonal antibodies (dMAb) were developed and evaluated for antiviral efficacy. This immediate and persistent protection strategy confers the ability to overcome shortcomings inherent with conventional active vaccination or passive immunotherapy. A collection of novel dMAbs were developed which were potent against ZIKV and could be expressed in serum within 24-48 h of in vivo administration. The DNA vaccine, from a previous development, was potent after adaptive immunity was developed, protecting against infection, brain and testes pathology in relevant mouse challenge models and in an NHP challenge. Delivery of potent dMAbs protected mice from the same murine viral challenge within days of delivery. Combined injection of dMAb and the DNA vaccine afforded rapid and long-lived protection in this challenge model, providing an important demonstration of the advantage of this synergistic approach to pandemic outbreaks.",

            "text": "Zika virus (ZIKV), a member of the genus Flavivirus of the Flaviviridae family, was first isolated from a sentinel monkey in the Zika forest of Uganda in 1947. Like other flaviviruses including dengue (DENV), yellow fever (YFV), West Nile (WNV), Japanese encephalitis (JEV) and tick-borne encephalitis (TBEV), ZIKV is an arbovirus, with mosquitoes of the Aedes genus, particularly Aedes aegypti, transmitting ZIKV between human and non-human primate (NHP) hosts. [1] [2] [3] Most ZIKV infections are asymptomatic, but some individuals develop mild symptoms after infection that include fever, headaches, lethargy, rash, arthralgia, and/or myalgia. Outbreaks of ZIKV infections across islands in the Pacific Ocean and in the Americas (primarily Brazil) between 2007 and 2016, however, have indicated both previously unreported modes of transmission including sexual, vertical, and through blood transfusions/organ transplant as well as new, severe signs of ZIKV infection. [3] [4] [5] The most significant of these new manifestations is a dramatic increase in the incidence of microcephaly, congenital blindness, and other severe birth defects in babies born to mothers infected with ZIKV during pregnancy. Subsequent studies in mice and humans have since confirmed that ZIKV is a teratogen. 3, [6] [7] [8] [9] Additionally, ZIKV infection was also found to increase the risk for development of Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome post recovery. 8 This alarming increase in cases of microcephaly and other birth defects following ZIKV infections prompted the World Health Organization (WHO) to declare ZIKV infection a global health emergency in 2016. 4, 10 There are currently no licensed vaccines or treatments to prevent or ameliorate ZIKV infection and disease, but new findings about ZIKV infection have accelerated efforts to develop such therapeutics and vaccines. Vaccines targeting ZIKV have been made in several formulations including purified inactivated virus, protein subunits, adenovirus vectors, DNA plasmids, and RNA. [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] Each of these has been shown to induce ZIKV-specific immune responses in mice and NHPs that can protect these animal models against morbidity and mortality following ZIKV challenge. Some of these vaccines are now being evaluated in phase I clinical trials. 11 A second line of investigation for ZIKV therapeutics is the isolation and production of anti-ZIKV monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) for passive transfer into infected patients. Several antibodies have been identified and isolated from ZIKV-infected patients that are capable of neutralizing in vitro infection by a broad panel of ZIKV isolates from Africa, Asia, and the Americas.",

            "text": "Therapeutic mAbs can be an effective means of combating infectious diseases, but factors including a laborious production process and the need for repeated dosing to maintain protective serum levels make them cost-prohibitive, which limit their clinical application. To overcome some of these barriers, our group has pioneered a method that uses DNA plasmid technology as a delivery vehicle for these antibodies. Delivery of DNA plasmids encoding genes of therapeutic monoclonal antibodies (dMAbs) into muscle followed by electroporation stimulates long-term, in vivo production of the mAbs which significantly reduces costs by eliminating both the need for ex vivo production and purification of protein mAbs and the need for repeated dosing. Furthermore, using DNA plasmids as vectors for mAb gene delivery has additional advantages including; (i) a strong safety profile in numerous clinical trials; (ii) the ability for re-dosing since DNA vectors are non-immunogenic, and (iii) the possibility for long-term gene expression even though DNA vectors do not integrate into cellular DNA. Synthetic DNA technology allows for manipulation of mAb sequences to improve in vivo expression levels and/or modify effector function(s) of the antibodies. We have demonstrated that delivery of dMAbs targeting Pseudomonas, Chikungunya, Dengue, and Influenza into mice produces biologically relevant mAb serum levels that can protect animals from challenge by each pathogen. [17] [18] [19] [20] Additionally, dMAbs can be co-delivered with DNA vaccines to provide immediate protection during the eclipse period when conventional vaccine-induced immunity is developing. 19 Here we describe the identification and cloning of a panel of humanized IgG monoclonal antibodies isolated from ZIKV DNA vaccine-immunized mice as well as derived from ZIKVinfected rhesus macaque monkeys (RhMac). The genetic sequences of the anti-ZIKV mAbs were modified to synthetically produce human IgGs while retaining each mAb's complementarity-determining region (CDR). The genetic sequences were optimized to improve protein translation and then cloned into DNA vectors. The dMAb plasmids were shown to direct production of ZIKV-specific antibodies in vitro and in vivo. Mice administered ZIKV-dMAb plasmids were protected from morbidity and mortality after challenge with a contemporary clinical ZIKV strain. Most importantly, the dMAb plasmids provide immediate protection from ZIKV which could be co-administered with a ZIKV DNA vaccine to provide comprehensive protection from ZIKV during the eclipse period of the vaccine-induced immune responses. The anti-ZIKV mAbs described here may be useful in providing protection against this rapidly emerging virus.",

Approximately 50-60 antibody-producing mouse hybridoma clones were identified as having antibody binding at least four-fold higher than the background level reactivity. For the RhMac clones, we used phage display methods as outlined in Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory (CSHL) manual to generate mAb clones with high affinity for the ZIKV envelope protein. Positive hybridoma clones reacting with sucrose-purified ZIKV virions, as well as recombinant soluble ZIKV-Env protein, were characterized by an indirect ELISA. Positive clones were identified by nucleotide sequencing of the variable H chain (VH) and variable L chain (VL) sequences as described. [18] [19] [20] The coding sequences for the RhMac clone antibodies against ZIKV-Ig were obtained from the phage display assay.

Passive antibodies may have value in therapy of infected persons to lower viral load as well as in rapid protection strategies to protect at risk women of childbearing years or the immune compromised. Neutralizing monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) have been demonstrated to be effective in the treatment of several infectious diseases as well as in preliminary in vitro and in vivo models of flavivirus-related infections. 25, 26, 28 Given their specific antiviral activity as being well-tolerated molecules with limited side effects, mAbs could represent a new therapeutic approach for the development of an effective treatment, as well as useful tools in the study of the host-virus interplay and in the development of more effective immunogens.",

A similar DNA vaccine can induce robust antibody responses in mice and NHPs, that can protect mice from ZIKV challenge. 12 Following the third immunization, sera from immunized mice were screened by ELISA to confirm the presence of antibodies targeting ZIKV Env. Subsequently, B lymphocytes from immunized mice splenocytes were isolated and used to create hybridomas by conventional means. 19 The hybridomas were screened to identify clones producing antibodies with the highest affinity against ZIKV-Env, resulting in 10 mouse mAbs: 1C2A6, 1D4G7, 3F12E9, 8D10F4, 8A9F9, 2B7D7, 4D6E8, 5E6D9, 6F9D1, and 9F7E1 being selected.

All macaques developed viremia after the first challenge, but none had detectable viremia after re-challenge. Spleen and whole blood mononuclear cells were harvested from the macaques 15 d-post re-challenge. Subsequently, scFv/phage-display technology combined with solid-phase selection against immobilized Zika antigen was used. RNA from peripheral blood B cells was prepared from each of the five macaques and pooled. Similarly, splenic RNA was prepared from each macaque and pooled. RT-PCR to amplify variable heavy (VH), variable kappa (V\u03ba), and variable lambda (V\u03bb) gene segments was performed separately on peripheral blood RNA and splenic RNA, and then VHs, V\u03bas, and V\u03bbs from each source of RNA were pooled. RT-PCR was performed as described 21-23 using a combination of human immunoglobulin primers previously described and supplemented with sets of macaque-specific VH, V\u03ba, and V\u03bb as summarized in supplementary data Table 1 . Separate VH/ V\u03ba and VH/V\u03bb scFv phage display libraries were constructed using the pComb3X vector as described 21, 22 using TG1 electrocompetent E. coli and comprised 1.6 \u00d7 10 9 and 1.5 \u00d7 10 9 independent transformants, respectively. VH/V\u03ba and VH/V\u03bb libraries were panned separately on immobilized Zika ENV protein using solid-phase methods previously described. 21 Positive clones were identified using phage ELISA, and heavy and light chain scFv nucleotide sequences were identified as described 21, 23 and analyzed for homology to macaque immunoglobulin germline gene segments using IMGT/V-Quest. 29 Of 44 randomly selected clones, 11 unique RhMac anti-ZIKV Env mAbs were isolated after screening: KP401, KP412, LP401, LP305, LP314, LP306, LP320, LP311, LP312, LP402 and LP408 where \"K\" and \"L\" designations indicate whether the scFv comprises a kappa or lambda light chain, respectively.

Sera collected from mice at various times post-injection and EP were evaluated by quantitative ELISA for chimeric human IgG to assess DMAb production and longevity. As noted in Figure 3 , mouse and RhMac dMAb plasmids both were evaluated for production of IgG in vivo. Peak serum antibody levels varied between the different mouse-and RhMac dMAbs evaluated. Mouse-derived ZIKV dMAb clones were observed at the highest serum concentration (ng/mL) between 15 and 25 dpost-injection ( Figure 3a) . Importantly, these in vivo dMAbs retained the ability to bind to ZIKV Env protein by Western blot analyses (Figure 3b ). The expression of RhMac dMAbs was detectable out to 60 dpost injection, and these in vivo dMAbs in circulation were also able to bind ZIKV Env protein (Figure 3c,d) . These results indicate that (a) An unrooted phylogenetic tree based on CDR comparisons (only) of 16 anti-Zika envelope antibodies was generated to demonstrate relatedness and by extension the potential for epitope targeting similarity. Shown nearby to each antibody location on the tree is a molecular model generated with standard antibody modeling protocols as implemented in Discovery Studio. Models are shown in CPK format and CDRs are highlighted. As sequence relatedness translates to structural similarities, it can be noted that clusters of nearly or completely identical CDRs adopt similar conformations. Of the Fv models shown, LP408, LP314, and 8A9F9 have been subjected to docking analysis using ZDOCK as implemented in Discovery Studio and scored with ZRANK. In all cases, the EDIII region (a known target for effective neutralizing antibodies) contains multiple top poses for the antibodies in question. In particular, LP408 and LP314 demonstrate the top 15 of 20 poses total in this region. * indicates similar CDR conformations between closely related mAbs and a potential ZIKV ENV Domain III (EDIII) binding for clones 8A9F9, LP314, and LP408.

Avidity is the supportive force of engaging multiple antibody paratope/antigen epitope pairs between one antibody and one antigen. In other words, avidity is a functional consequence of antibody-binding multivalency. We therefore investigated IgG binding and avidity of these mAbs and analyzed in an indirect IgG and avidity ELISA. Using the traditional antigen-capture sandwich ELISA, all of these mAbs were tested. Shown are average ELISA signals plotted against input antibody concentration, a dose-dependent binding curve could be readily obtained, and the signals reached saturation at higher antibody concentrations (Figure 4a,b) . Furthermore, we also assessed the monoclonal antibody activity of recombinant ZV-envelope III proteins by ELISA.

Most mice that received either mouse clones (Figure 5a ) or RhMac clones (Figure 5b ) of anti-ZIKV dMAb prior to challenge survived the infection.

We have previously reported on the effectiveness of a DNA vaccine containing a novel consensus prME ZIKV antigen in inducing protective humoral and cellular immune responses in mice, NHPs 12 and humans. 27 As with most vaccines, optimal levels of protective immune responses are not achieved until at least a week post administration, and often, one or two boosting immunizations are needed to achieve durable, protective responses. In an outbreak situation, it is imperative to get health-care professionals and other personnel to hot zones rapidly, and often before they can receive a boost of any vaccine available to protect them from the threat. 33 For these situations, we hypothesized that formulating a dMAb plasmid with a DNA vaccine could create a novel field strategy capable of providing both immediate and persistent protective responses against a pathogen. DNA is a useful vector for this strategy as it is nonimmunogenic and allows for multiple administrations without loss of potency. 17, 19 For this study, we injected groups of A129 mice intramuscularly + EP with ZIKV DNA vaccine plasmid coformulated with mouse-derived-or RhMac-derived-anti-ZIKV dMAb plasmids as described in Figure 6a . Half of the mice in each group were challenged with 10 6 PFU of ZIKV PR209 2 d later (D 2) while the other half in each group were challenged 3 weeks after the first immunization (D 21). As expected, ZIKV challenge of vaccine+dMAb groups conducted 2 d post the first vaccine+dMAb injection was able to protect the mice from morbidity and mortality (90% protection). The other half of each group that were challenged 3 weeks post the initial injection conferred 100% protection from ZIKV morbidity and mortality (Figure 6b,c) . These results indicate that neither the mouse nor RhMac ZIKV dMAbs interfered with the induction of immune responses by the ZIKV DNA vaccine-making co-administration of these plasmids a viable strategy for providing immediate and persistent protection from ZIKV.",

Current ZIKV vaccine platforms utilize various modalities including nucleic acids (both DNA and mRNA); purified, inactivated whole virus vaccines (PIV); viral-vectored vaccines; subunit proteins-virus-like particles (VLPs); and live-attenuated vaccines. Developing ZIKV vaccines based on a single strain of virus is feasible because the two genetic lineages of ZIKV, African and Asian/American, have limited variability. 36 As for ZIKV therapeutics, anti-ZIKV monoclonal antibodies for both prophylaxis and treatment have been developed including the EDIII-specific ZKA190 clone which is broadly neutralizing and the ZIKV-117 clone that reduces infection in pregnant and non-pregnant mice. Small molecule antiviral agents have been tested that limit ZIKV infection in various ways including nucleoside analogs, peptidomimetic agents, adenosine analogs, antimalarials, anthelmintics, and cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors (CDK). 37 With both ZIKV vaccines and therapeutics for prophylactic and therapeutic usages, one of the biggest hurdles in advancing agents to the clinic has been the selection of the most suitable clinical endpoint. 37 Given the endemic potential of ZIKV encompassing several continents and the broad spectrum of clinical manifestations, it is difficult to discern a na\u00efve population without extensive laboratory testing. Ethical considerations for the inclusion of pregnant women and their safety related to ZIKV-related neurological complications, notably microcephaly and Guillain-Barr\u00e9 Syndrome, have also hindered the clinical evaluation of ZIKV vaccines and therapeutics.",

The antibody gene sequences were encoded into DNA plasmid vectors to create dMAb plasmids that were shown to drive production of significant serum levels of functional anti-ZIKV antibodies in mice after a single EPenhanced intramuscular injection. Delivery of these anti-ZIKV dMAb plasmids protected mice from morbidity and mortality following ZIKV challenge. Importantly, the ZIKV dMAb plasmids described here could be co-formulated with an anti-ZIKV DNA vaccine to provide immediate and persistent anti-ZIKV immune responses, respectively. As such, this can be a promising strategy for protecting individuals traveling to a ZIKV endemic region. 8, 38 While the dMAb plasmids were constructed in a similar fashion, in vivo serum levels of ZIKV dMAbs varied greatly. The clones producing peak serum antibody levels of 1\u221ag/ml or more include human IgGs 8A9F9 and 8D10F4 originated from mice, and the human IgGs LP301, LP311, LP312, and KP412 originating from RhMac. There is no discernible pattern to explain the variable expression levels of each dMAb in vivo with factors including antibody folding, antibody charge, and antibody glycosylation all likely contributing factors. To improve expression levels in vivo, changes in dMAb plasmid formulation are being explored along with two-plasmid strategies where the heavy and light chains of each antibody are delivered on separate plasmids. DNA plasmids co-formulated with hyaluronidase have been shown to increase in vivo expression. 20, 39, 40 Despite variable expression levels, the ability of the different antibodies to bind to ZIKV envelope is similar at normalized serum concentrations. An area of concern for antibody therapies for flaviviruses, particularly dengue virus, is the potential for antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) of infection where sub-neutralizing levels of antibodies can mediate greater levels of infection by allowing uptake of virus into cells expressing the Fc receptor. There are findings that cross-reactive dengue virus mAbs can exacerbate ZIKV infection of placental macrophages using Hoffbauer cells. 41 However, such effects had not been strongly demonstrated so far with ZIKV mAbs and increased ZIKV infections. Given the terminal disease state of severe ZIKV infections in humans, sub-neutralizing ZIKV mAbs with therapeutic efficacy warrants further investigation into higher animal models.",

            "text": "These ZIKV dMAb studies have several limitations to address. Our efforts were concentrated on identifying myriad of potent anti-ZIKV clones that bind to the prM and envelope regions of ZIKV to mainly affect receptor binding targeting Domain III of envelope as well as the stem and transmembrane regions that alter virion entry, assembly, and membrane fusion. 42, 43 Yet other structural and non-structural proteins may also be targeted to prevent or treat ZIKV infections. Monoclonal antibodies binding to ZIKV-NS1 region may confer advantages during an active viral replication phase of ZIKV infection, whereas clones that bind to ZIKV capsid anchor (Ca) region may block proper virion assembly as the cis-binding of Ca with PrM is strictly required to produce infectious particles. 42 Broadly neutralizing capability of these anti-ZIKV clones has not been evaluated in this study since the dMAb-administered animals were challenged with a single strain of ZIKV-PR209. Despite the limitations in study designs, ZIKV has limited strain variability in which the African and Asian/American lineages are classified as a single serotype. 36 ZIKV-PR209 is of the Asian/American lineage and one of the most virulent strains of wild-type ZIKV in recent years, which has been used in numerous published studies to test neutralization and in animal challenges to validate therapeutic or prophylactic efficacy of ZIKV agents. 12, 27, 44 Moreover, sequence alignments of 58 complete ZIKV genome and 5 ZIKV envelope sequences compiled as of April 2016 show highly conserved amino acid variations and only eight variation sites in the envelope region. 45 To our knowledge, these results are the first report of the in vivo expression of anti-ZIKV antibodies from a vector system. As ZIKV has spread throughout the islands of the Pacific Ocean and into South and Central America over the last 10 y, more serious signs and symptoms of ZIKV infection including birth defects and Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome have become evident and prompted a concerted effort to develop therapeutics that could protect from and/or treat ZIKV infection. 8 The mAbs described here have the potential to provide rapid prophylaxis against ZIKV infection and can be further combined with a ZIKV DNA vaccine to provide a durable protection to the virus. Furthermore, the mAb isolation process and the novel dMAb delivery strategy described here would be highly useful during an emerging infectious disease outbreak as the development and characterization stages are rapid and effective. The potential to broaden the clinical use of this novel mAb delivery strategy as well as dMAb therapies to resource-poor regions of the world warrants further study.",

B6.129S2-Ifnar1 tm1Agt /Mmjax (A129) mice (n= 7 per group) were injected with 100 \u03bcg of ZIKV dMAb plasmid or an empty pVax1 vector i.m. followed by CELLECTRA\u00ae enhanced electroporation delivery 2 d prior to being challenged with 10 6 plaque-forming units (PFU) of ZIKV PR209. (a and c) ZIKV dMAb clones tested for this challenge, ID4G7, 8D10F4, 8A9F9, and 3F12E9, were derived from ZIKA prME1 DNA-vaccinated murine spleen. (b and d) ZIKV dMAb clones tested for this challenge, LP401, LP408, LP305, LP311, KP401, and KP412 were derived from ZIKV-infected RhMac peripheral blood B cells and spleen. (a) A Kaplan-Meier survival curve of murine ZIKV challenge 2 d prior to mouse-derived ZIKV dMAb administration. Red lines show pVax1-injected cohort, and blue lines indicate dMAb-injected cohort. (b) A Kaplan-Meier survival curve of murine ZIKV challenge 2 d prior to RhMac-derived ZIKV dMAb administration. Red lines show pVax1-injected cohort, and blue lines indicate dMAb-injected cohort. (c-d) Bar graphs of ZIKV-associated clinical scores post challenge at D 9. Each mouse was scored from 1 (green, no disease) to 5 (red, paralysis of both hindlimbs) and recorded as a percentage. The body weight and clinical signs of symptoms were examined and documented daily post challenge. The disease burden was the most severe between D 7 and D 9, where all mice in the control group exhibited a paralysis of both hind limbs or in a moribund state. Non-surviving or moribund mice by D 9 were recorded as 5 (red, paralysis of both hindlimbs) (c) Percent of clinical symptoms in ZIKV-PR209 challenged A129 mice at D 9 receiving mouse-derived anti-ZIKV dMAb clones or pVax1 empty vector control. (d) Percent of clinical symptoms in ZIKV-PR209 challenged A129 mice at D 9 receiving RhMac-derived anti-ZIKV dMAb clones or pVax1 empty vector control.",

Ugen http://orcid.org/0000-0002-7797-A combination immunotherapy with ZIKV dMAb and the ZIKV DNA vaccine prME1, given concurrently, confers immediate and persistent protection against ZIKV challenge. (a) A schematic depiction of the combination immunotherapy schedule and challenge. A129 mice of 3-6 weeks of age and mixed gender were immunized with 25\u03bcg of pVax1 vector or ZIKV prME1 DNA vaccine i.m. in the left tibialis anterior muscle, and 100\u03bcg of pVax1 vector or the ZIKV dMAb plasmids i.m. in the right tibialis anterior muscle, as both injections were followed by CELLECTRA\u00ae enhanced electroporation delivery (n= 24, n= 12 for pVax1+ pVax1 group, n= 12 for prME1+ ZIKV dMAb group). Six mice from each group were challenged with 10 5 PFU of ZIKV PR209 2 d post DNA vaccine + ZIKV-dMAb combination. These remaining 12 mice were challenged with 10 6 PFU of ZIKV PR209 at 3 weeks after the first immunization. A combination immunotherapy of ZIKV DNA vaccine plus a ZIKV dMAb selected from mouse-derived clones (b) and rhesus macaque (RhMac)derived clones (c). ZIKV dMAb clones of both origins confer protection in mice from an acute and prolonged challenge.The top and bottom left graphs refer to the ZIKV challenge 2 d post the first combination immunotherapy (vaccine+dMAb), where the top indicates a Kaplan-Meier survival curve and the bottom indicates percent body weight change over time. The top and bottom right graphs refer to the ZIKV challenge 3 weeks post the initial vaccine+dMAb administration, where the top graph indicates a Kaplan-Meier survival curve and the bottom graph charting percent body weight change over time.",
