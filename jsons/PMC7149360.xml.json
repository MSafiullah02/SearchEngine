The high mutation rates of viruses, coupled with short generation times and large population sizes, allow viruses to rapidly evolve and adapt to the host environment. This has important implications for the pathogenesis of viral infections. In the course of the chapter, we will address a number of questions about virus evolution: (1) How are mutation rates defined and what are substitution rates? (2) Why are mutation rates so high? How do they differ for RNA and DNA viruses? (3) How are these rates measured and what are the shortcomings of standard measures? (4) Why is multiplicity of infection so relevant to the accumulation of mutations? (5) What are phylodynamics? What is a molecular clock and how is it estimated? (6) What drives virus evolution? What role does the host response play in virus evolution? How does this impact pathogenesis? Do viruses evolve to a benign relationship with their hosts? This chapter sets forth the basic tenets that govern the evolution of viruses: mutation rates, population size, selection, and the MOI. We will explore how viruses evolve within a host, during transmission to novel susceptible hosts, and establish infections in new host species.",

One unique characteristic of viruses is their MOI, which is the ratio between the number of viruses and the infecting cells. MOI has several consequences for evolution that are discussed in a later section, and these are subject to the constantly changing size of the virus population. The typical view of viral evolution is that viruses create huge population sizes within the infected host. However, this huge population size is punctuated by frequent bottlenecks during host-to-host transmission, and population structure within an infected host, where different organs and tissues may support different independently replicating populations. These differences in population size will affect both the selection-drift balance mentioned above, and the MOI of different virus subpopulations. In the rest of this chapter, we discuss the different factors affecting the virus population, and how these factors intertwine to shape virus evolution.",

Critically, these two measures can differ when viruses use stamping machine replication versus geometric genome replication (Figure 1\n). During stamping machine replication one single virus genome is used as the template for replication, leading to linear accumulation of mutations. With geometric genome replication, progeny strands can become templates for replication themselves, and thus there is an exponential (or geometric) increase in progeny genomes. This will lead to a completely different distribution of mutations in the progeny genomes.",

Next, a selective environment is used to measure a given phenotype caused by a single mutation (e.g., resistance to phage). In each clonal population, the frequency of mutants with the phenotype is measured. Since mutations arose spontaneously in the parallel clonal populations, it is possible to use the mutant frequency to backtrack the mutation rate. If the number of rounds of replication can be estimated and the number of initial input genomes is known, it is possible to obtain a mutation rate per site per round of replication. There are several caveats in this assay leading to a biased estimation of the mutation rate: Mutations at multiple sites may alter the mutant phenotype; or the number of rounds of replication may be incorrectly estimated when the mode (stamping machine versus geometric) of genome replication is unknown.",

Using a sequencing technique that reduces the high error rate of prevalent NGS techniques, Acevedo et al. (2014) could accurately record the frequency of lethal mutations, which are expected to be present in a population at a frequency equal to the basic unbiased mutation rate (Figure 2\n). Applying this method to Poliovirus 1 populations confirmed a mean mutation rate of 3.97 \u00d7 10\u22124, consistent with previous measurements. However, these results yield a level of detail previously less appreciated: different pairs of bases are replaced at different rates. A further intriguing study has shown that measurements of viral mutation rates vary substantially when measured across different cell types. Thus, there are previously unappreciated layers of complexity in the ascertainment of viral mutation rates.",

When MOI is high, cells are coinfected with multiple viruses, and when MOI is one or lower, each cell is most likely infected by one virus only. High MOI leads to a myriad of complex and contrasting effects (Table 2\n). First, in recombining viruses (or those that undergo reassortment), high MOI will lead to increased levels of recombination. Frequent recombination may lead to more efficient selection, allowing the efficient removal of deleterious alleles and the incorporation of adaptive alleles. High rates of recombination/reassortment may also lead to the emergence of strains with a more virulent phenotype, as is thought to occur in cross-species transmission events of influenza virus. However, high MOI may also have contrary effects, whereby inferior genotypes are rescued, and maintained in the population, by products of superior genotypes. Complementation at high MOI also leads to propagation of defective particles. Thus under high MOI conditions, the beneficial effect of adaptive alleles may be masked (Stern et al., 2014).",

Finally, competition for resources at high MOI may also have complex effects on viral replication. In fact, following complementation, viruses enter a \u201cPrisoner\u2019s dilemma\u201d regime where selfish genotypes evolve reducing the mean fitness of the viral population (had complementation been absent). Of these contrasting effects, the negative effects of complementation are more dominant that the positive effects of recombination, at least for bacteriophage \u03a66 (Froissart et al., 2004) and for polioviruses (Stern et al., 2014).

Interestingly, the population with highest fitness in the original host does not necessarily fare well in new hosts, while low-frequency genotypes from the original host may be the ones that prevail in the new host. (3) It is likely that different types of viruses will be affected differently by MOI.

These vaccines are based on \u201cancient\u201d isolates (often at least 50 years old) of viruses which induce homologous neutralizing antibodies. Since these vaccines continue to provide protection against currently circulating viral strains, it must be concluded that the cognate viruses cannot evolve antibody-escape mutants that are sufficiently \u201cfit\u201d to survive and replace the original circulating strains. There are two notable exceptions to this general rule, influenza and HIV viruses. In both instances, antibody-escape mutants can survive to circulate in the population. For this reason, influenza virus continues to \u201cdrift\u201d and new virus isolates must be used each year to produce protective vaccines. HIV has resisted the development of an effective vaccine mainly due to the difficulty of inducing \u201cbroadly neutralizing\u201d antibodies that are effective against the population of escape mutants that have evolved over the last 30 years. In both instances, there is a structural explanation. Neutralizing antibodies to HIV and influenza viruses are not necessarily directed at the receptor-attachment site on the viral envelope, so neutralization escape mutants can still attach to cellular receptors, replicate, and persist (Figure 5\n).",

This method is based on the premise that sequence data can be used to identify potential lethal mutations: in this case either stop codons within proteins or amino acid changes within catalytic sites of viral enzymes were enumerated. Based on population-genetics theory, the rate of lethal mutations was assumed to be equal to the basic unbiased mutation rate. Open boxes used both kinds of mutations and shaded boxes used only catalytic site mutations. Ts refers to a transition mutation; Tv refers to a transversion mutation (purine to pyrimidine or the reverse).",
