With such a large number of therapeutic interventions given to affected patients, the goal was to determine which was efficacious against Ebola. Ultimately, none proved to be efficacious or safe, just because of virtually all studies were singlegroup interventions without concurrent controls, which led to no definitive conclusion related to efficacy or safety.

It is known that antiviral therapy is most likely to provide benefit when initiated earlier during the course of the disease both in influenza [4] and in SARS [5] . Predictors of adverse outcome might be useful in predicting who will do poorly and thus who might benefit most from early antiviral therapy 3 .

The most frequently used agents both in Turkey and all over the world including chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine, lopinavir/ritonavir, favipiravir and remdesivir will be reviewed here 4567 . Nitazoxanide and ivermectin were also included in this review as they have recently been reported to have an activity against SARS-CoV-2 in vitro and are licensed for the treatment of some other human infections. Mechanisms of actions of these drugs were shown in Table. 1.1. Hydroxychloroquine and Chloroquine Chloroquine (CQ) and hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) are aminoquinolines, which have been used to treat malaria and autoimmune diseases for over 50 years. Besides their antimalarial effects, these two drugs possess immunomodulatory effects allowing them to use for the treatment of autoimmune conditions such as systemic lupus erythematosus and rheumatoid arthritis. Hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine can inhibit certain cellular functions and molecular pathways involved in immune activation [Inhibition of MHC class II expression, antigen presentation and immune activation (reducing CD154 expression by T cells); inhibition of production of various proinflammatory cytokines, such as IL-1, IFN\u03b1 and TNF, which can protect against cytokine-mediated cartilage resorption; interference with Toll-like receptor 7 (TLR7) and TLR9 signaling pathways; interference with cyclic GMP-AMP (cGAMP) synthase (cGAS) activity] partly by accumulating in lysosomes and auto phagosomes of phagocytic cells and changing local pH concentrations [6] . Chloroquine analogs are weak diprotic bases (can accept more two protons) and they can penetrate and concentrate within acidic organelles such as endosomes and lysosomes which leads to elevated intra-vesicular pH resulting in prevention of endosome trafficking and prevents viral fusion into the cell. This mechanism has translated to the potential role of these drugs in the treatment of COVID-19. Additionally, studies also revealed that these drugs interfers with the glycosylation of ACE-2 receptor which prevents SARS-CoV-2 receptor binding and subsequent infection. Recent in vitro studies reported CQ and HCQ effective against SARS-CoV-2 at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 0.01 with a 50% effective concentration (EC50) of 2.71 \u00b5M and 4.51 \u00b5M in Vero E6 cells, respectively. At all MOIs (0.01, 0.02, 0.2, and 0.8), EC50 for CQ (2.71, 3.81, 7.14, and 7.36 \u03bcM) was lower than that of HCQ (4.51, 4.06, 17.31, and 12.96 \u03bcM) [7] [8] [9] . In another in vitro analysis, HCQ was found to be more potent than CQ at inhibiting SARS-CoV-2 and HCQ sulfate 400 mg given twice daily for 1 day, followed by 200 mg twice daily for 4 more days is recommended to treat SARS-CoV-2 infection [10, 11] .",

Favipiravir undergoes an intracellular phosphoribosylation to be an active form, favipiravir ribofuranosyl-5B-triphosphate (favipiravir-RTP), which is recognized as a substrate by RdRp, and inhibits the RNA polymerase activity. Since the catalytic domain of RdRp is conserved among various types of RNA viruses, this mechanism of action may underpins a broader spectrum of antiviral activities of favipiravir. Favipiravir-RTP inhibits RdRp of the influenza virus with an IC50 of0.022 \u00b5g/mL, but does not affect the human DNA polymerases \u03b1, \u03b2, \u03b3 subunits at up to 100 \u00b5g/mL. In addition to the inhibition of influenza virus, favipiravir shows inhibitory effects on a wide range of RNA viruses, such as arena-, bunya-, flavi-and filoviruses causing hemorrhagic fevers [18, 19] . It has been shown to be effective in the treatment of influenza and in some extent Ebola virus disease [19] [20] [21] . Genome sequencing of the 2019-nCoV identified the virus as a single-stranded RNA beta-coronavirus with the RdRp gene similar to those of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. Therefore, favipiravir is considered as one of the potential candidates for COVID-19, though confirmed in vitro and preclinical animal studies are not available yet. In an in-vitro study, SARS-CoV-2 was inhibited by favipiravir in Vero E6 cells with an EC50 of 61.88 \u00b5Mol [14] . But in another study favipiravir showed no apparent antiviral effect against the SARS-CoV-2 virus in vitro at concentrations under 100 \u03bcML [22] .",

In a cohort of patients hospitalized for severe Covid-19 who were treated with compassionate use remdesivir, clinical improvement was observed in 36 of 53 patients (68%) [25] . As there was no placebo or active comparator in this study, it is hard to draw any concrete conclusions and measurement of efficacy will require results of ongoing randomized, placebo-controlled trials of remdesivir therapy.

There was a trend towards decreased mortality with LPV/r (19 versus 25 percent), and the numerical difference in mortality was greater among those who were randomized within 12 days of symptom onset, but neither difference was statistically significant. The rate of SARS-CoV-2 decline was similar in the group that received LPV/r and the group that did not. LPV/r was stopped early in 14 percent because of adverse effects. The patients recruited for the study were late in infection and already had considerable tissue damage (as evidenced by compromised lung function and 25% mortality in the control group). Even highly active antibacterial agents have limited efficacy in advanced bacterial pneumonia [33] . Accelerated clinical recovery (16.0 days vs. 17.0 days) and reduced mortality (19.0% vs. 27.1%) were observed in a post hoc subgroup of those treated within 12 days after the onset of symptoms, but not in those treated later [48, 49] . Also in another study of 280 COVID-19 patients, time from illness onset to antiviral was found to be a risk factor for severe disease. Patients in the mild group experienced earlier initiation of antiviral treatment (1.19 \u00b1 0.45 vs. 2.65 \u00b1 1.06 days in the severe group, P < 0.001) [34] . The question of whether earlier LPV/r treatment in COVID-19 could have clinical benefit is an important one that requires further studies.",

It also displays broad-spectrum in vitro antiviral activity against influenza, respiratory syncytial virus, parainfluenza, rotavirus, and norovirus among others in addition to coronaviruses. This broad-spectrum antiviral activity is believed to be due to the fact that the mechanism of action is based on interference with host-regulated pathways involved in viral replication rather than virusspecific pathways [35] . Nitazoxanideupregulates the innate antiviral mechanisms by broadly amplifying cytoplasmic RNA sensing and type I IFN pathways. Nitazoxanide interferes with the viral infection by upregulating the precise host mechanisms that viruses target to bypass host cellular defenses [36] . Due to its broad-spectrum antiviral activity, nitazoxanide is being investigated in clinical trials including randomized controlled ones for the management of influenza and other acute respiratory infections, although results are not encouraging or unavailable yet. Although the in vitro activity of nitazoxanide against SARS-CoV-2 is encouraging, more data are clearly needed to determine its role in the management of COVID-19 [26] 16 .",

Other actions of ivermectin have been reported, but ivermectin has been shown to inhibit the nuclear import of host and viral proteins. It has been demonstrated to limit infection by some RNA viruses including influenza, dengue and West Nile viruses. Ivermectin has similarly been shown to be effective against the DNA virus pseudorabies virus (PRV) both in vitro and in vivo, with ivermectin treatment shown to increase survival in PRV-infected mice [37] . Efficacy was not observed for ivermectin against Zikavirus in mice, but the authors acknowledged that study limitations justified the reevaluation of ivermectin's anti-Zika virus activity [38] . Finally, ivermectin was the focus of a phase III clinical trial in Thailand in 2014-2017, against dengue virus infection, in which a single daily oral dose was observed to be safe and resulted in a significant reduction in serum levels of viral NS1 protein, but no change in viremia or clinical benefit was observed 17 .",
