            "text": "Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) is one of approximately 70 flaviviruses, frequently causing symptoms involving the central nervous system. Mutations of its genomic RNA frequently occur during viral replication, which is believed to be a force contributing to viral evolution. Nevertheless, accumulating evidences show that some JEV strains may have actually arisen from RNA recombination between genetically different populations of the virus. We have demonstrated that RNA recombination in JEV occurs unequally in different cell types. In the present study, viral RNA fragments transfected into as well as viral RNAs synthesized in mosquito cells were shown not to be stable, especially in the early phase of infection possibly via cleavage by exoribonuclease. Such cleaved small RNA fragments may be further degraded through an RNA interference pathway triggered by viral double-stranded RNA during replication in mosquito cells, resulting in a lower frequency of RNA recombination in mosquito cells compared to that which occurs in mammalian cells. In fact, adjustment of viral RNA to an appropriately lower level in mosquito cells prevents overgrowth of the virus and is beneficial for cells to survive the infection. Our findings may also account for the slower evolution of arboviruses as reported previously.",

Nowadays, it is extensively distributed in most Asian countries and was also recently reported from Australia [2] . The JE virus (JEV) is one of some 70 members of the genus Flavivirus belonging to the family Flaviviridae [3] , the genome of which contains a linear, single-stranded positive-sense RNA (\u223c11 kb long) that encodes 3 structural proteins including nucleocapsid (C), membrane (preM/M), and envelope (E) proteins, as well as 7 nonstructural proteins (NS1, NS2A, NS2B, NS3, NS4A, NS4B, and NS5) [4] . Due to lack of a proofreading mechanism and an inability to repair errors during RNA synthesis, spontaneous mutations frequently occur which contribute to the formation of genetically diversified populations or so-called \"quasispecies\" in flaviviruses including the JEV [5] .",

In addition to gene mutations [9] , RNA recombination, at least in some cases, can also serve as a factor helping a virus escape from accumulated deleterious effects in a viral population [10] .

However, a slightly lower frequency of RNA recombination was eventually shown in mosquito cells (Figure 2 ). treated with PAP, the inhibitor of exoribonuclease, compared to untreated cells. In contrast, no effect of PAP on increasing RNA recombination was seen in C6/36 cells; only a low level of RNA recombination was found in this test (Figure 3(a) ). Looking at transfected viral fragment (+) RNA in C6/36 cells treated with PAP, enzymatic cleavage by exoribonuclease did not occur at 3 h after transfection while it evidently decreased preservation of such RNA fragment at 6 h after transfection in mosquito cells (Figure 3(b) ). Viral genomic RNA was not affected when treated with PAP in both cell types (Figure 3(a) ), implying that the transfected viral RNA fragment may not be further degraded by exoribonuclease mostly in mammalian cells; which leads to a higher possibility of occurring RNA recombination in such cells.",

According to the results, RNAs of both the T1P1-S1 and CJN-S1 strains accumulated more slowly in C6/36 cells than BHK-21 cells (Figure 5(a) ). Specifically, the RNA amount of the T1P1-S1 strain remained at the baseline level until 12 hpi (3.81-fold change), compared with an increase of 169.72-fold at 24 hpi in C6/36 cells. In contrast, T1P1-S1 RNA, respectively, increased to 3.09-, 28.99-, 429.05-, 4396.07-, and 5487.75-fold, at 3, 6, 9, 12, and 24 hpi in BHK-21 cells. Similarly, the RNA amount of CJN-S1 also accumulated more slowly in C6/36 cells than in BHK-21 cells. The RNA amount remained at the baseline level until 12 hpi (2.36-fold increase) and subsequently increased to 152.32-fold at 24 hpi in C6/36 cells. In contrast, the RNA amount of CJN-S1 RNA, respectively, increased by 16.64-, 111.43-, and 554.87-fold at 9, 12, and 24 hpi, despite it having been unchanged at 6 hpi (1.35fold change) in BHK-21 cells. The result revealed that progeny RNA of the virus is delayed to accumulate in mosquito compared to mammalian cells, especially at the early phase of infection. The stability of viral RNA is crucial for the productivity of the progeny virions, which was evaluated after transfection of an RNA fragment prepared from (+)5 3 -UTR-II into either BHK-21 or C6/36 cells. Results showed that transfected fragments had not significantly degraded even at 3 or 6 hpt in BHK-21 cells, while those in C6/36 cells had more obviously degraded ( Figure 5(b) ), implying that different outcomes of RNA existed in the 2 cell types especially in the early phase of infection.",

Thus, the rate of spontaneous mutations is a critical parameter modeling the genetic structure of viral populations [29] . The primary variation following a mutation may provide for further evolutionary processes, for example, selection and/or recombination [30] . Those in turn lead to the generation of viral strains which are more adept and fit in nature. RNA recombination is now believed to be a strategy for the evolution of many viruses [12] , for instance, the poliovirus [31] , hepatitis C virus [32] , hepatitis D virus [33] , and norovirus [34] . A variety of flaviviruses including dengue virus and JEV were also reported to carry out RNA recombination according to bioinformatics inferences [17, 35] and experimental demonstration [25] . Currently, 2 possible mechanisms are reported to lead to the occurrence of recombination [36] : a copy-choice mechanism and a breakage and rejoining mechanism. Of these, the former apparently occurs more commonly as it has been shown in the poliovirus [37] , coronaviruses [38] , and plant viruses [39] . This mechanism of viral RNA recombinations can further be divided into 3 types: precisely homologous, imprecisely (aberrantly) homologous, and nonhomologous [16] . Among these, precisely homologous recombination through a template-switching (copy-choice) mechanism is probably most common [40] . As in our previous report, different strains of the JEV can coinfect host cells derived from mosquitoes or mammals [25] , which actually generates recombinant forms of the virus [30] .",

Looking at RNA accumulation of JEV in host cells, it takes longer, at least a 24 h difference, in mosquito cells to reach the level of that in mammalian cells. The stability of viral RNA was also shown by degradation of transfected single-stranded RNA fragments, either positive or negative sense, particularly in mosquito cells. It implicated that viral RNA is less stable at least at the early phase of infection by JEV in mosquito cells, which may result in delayed growth of the virus. Since transfected RNA fragments were degraded in both C6/36 cells and BHK-21 cells, RNase cleavage may be actually involved in viral RNA degradation to form small RNAs [41] . However, degradation of transfected RNA fragments in C6/36 cells was partially ameliorated by treatment with PAP, suggesting that viral RNAs are not completely degraded by the RNase cleavage pathway [42] .

On the other hand, dsRNAs formed in invertebrate cells are usually cleaved to be siRNA that consequently degrades viral RNAs [46] , leading to RNAi-mediated innate immunity [47] . Small RNAs ranging from 10 to 24 mer have been identified in C6/36 cells infected by West Nile virus [43] . We have also detected normal expression of Dicer-2 in C6/36 cells infected by JEV for 12 h although it was almost half of inhibition at 6 hpi (data not shown). As a result, dsRF-RNA of the JEV may have a great potential for viral RNA degradation at least in the early phase of infection in mosquito cells. This adjustment of RNA amount is believed to be the way for a delay in RNA accumulation and thus a lower frequency of RNA recombination of the JEV. In contrast, dsRNAs are recognized as a central component of IFN and therefore are incapable of mediating RNAi in mammalian cells [48] . Eventually, our results have shown that protection of RNA from RNase cleavage increases the efficiency of RNA recombination particularly in mammalian cells. RNA recombination creates advantageous genotypes by evolutionary jumps [30] , which permits the removal of deleterious genes based on the notion of \"Muller's ratchet\" from the host cell, usually mammalian cells [12] . Notably, viral RNAs usually accumulated at a lower amount in mosquito cells through RNase cleavage as well as RNA-mediated pathways, leading to stagnancy of RNA recombination which may brake evolution of the JEV and probably most, if not all, arboviruses which are maintained in nature by alternate cycles involving mosquitoes and vertebrates [28] .",

No fragment was seen in tests with RNA extracted from cells following mock treatment (with neither infection nor transfection), virus infection only, or transfection only. Although amplification of a 564 bp fragment showing RNA recombination was present in the control group which contained a mixture of RNAs extracted from infected and transfected cells, RNA recombination was significantly elevated in BHK-21 and C6/36 cells infected by the Japanese encephalitis virus (Nakayama strain) following transfection with the (+)5 3 -UTR-I plasmid RNA. According to the image-density analysis, it seems that RNA recombination occurred less frequently in mosquito cells. A specific fragment of viral RNA (529 bp) was used as an internal control in all groups with viral infection. Status of RNA recombination after inhibition by exoribonuclease with PAP (3 -phosphoadenosine-5 -phosphate, an inhibitor of exoribonuclease). (a) The RNA recombination rate increased to a higher level in BHK-21 cells after treatment with PAP, compared to that of untreated cells. In contrast, no effect of PAP on increasing RNA recombination of the virus was shown in C6/36 cells despite a very low level of RNA recombination still being observed. Viral RNA was not affected after treatment with PAP, suggesting exoribonucleasemediated degradation of transfected RNA fragments might increase RNA recombination of the virus strains, especially in mammalian cells. (b) Treatment with PAP in C6/36 cells did not cause degradation of the transfected (+) RNA fragment at 3 h until 6 h after transfection at which a partial effect appeared.",
