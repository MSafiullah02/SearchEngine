Mrs Smith contracted the SARS virus 1 year ago while in Asia, had severe pneumonitis that responded to high-dose steroids. There was bilateral hip and knee pain during her stay in the acute medical ward, and MRI of both hips and knees only revealed \"non-specific subchondral anomalies\" of both knees, but no mention of avascular necrotic patches at the femoral head or around the knees was made. Repeat MRI of both knees were done last month when she flew back to the USA in view of increasing symptoms of the left knee and showed segmental AVN at the left femoral condyle. What is your plan for management?",

Existing in non-identified animal reservoirs, SARS-CoV continues to represent a threat to humans although more than 4 years have passed since a large outbreak of SARS, and no new cases have been reported. However, we cannot exclude the possibility of a re-emergence of SARS. It is hence necessary to understand the biology of the SARS-CoV to deal adequately with the next Case 28 a Young Lady with aVN after saRs outbreak whenever it happens, including orthopedic aspects as practicing orthopedic surgeons.",

The remaining 12 ORFs encode the four structural proteins: spike, membrane, nucleocapsid, and envelope; and eight accessory proteins. The viral genome and its expression within the host cell undergo extensive translational and enzymatic processing to form the 4 structural, 8 accessory and 16 non-structural proteins (Satija and Lal, Ann N Y Acad Sci, 2007) .",

Sharing of epidemiological data and maintaining the GenBank nucleic acid sequence database (nucleic acid research, 2004) is most important. Acute and prompt management of the acute respiratory failure not infrequently with ventilator support is required. AVN management: is along conventional lines as described by a companion textbook by the author. It is unresolved whether each and every AVN cases post-SARS are necessarily due to steroids, since there are some researchers who suspect that AVN might sometimes be caused by the SARS virus itself.",
