            "text": "In 2012, UK residents made 8.9 million visits to countries other than Europe and North America.1 Up to 70% of those travelling to developing countries report health problems and 8\u201315% are unwell enough to seek medical attention, with fever a common complaint.2, 3 Whilst many of these patients will have self-limiting illnesses, an important minority will have a more serious tropical infection which, if missed, could become life-threatening (as with malaria \u2013 Box 1\n) or have significant public health implications (as with typhoid - Box 2\n). The difficulty is in identifying these low-frequency events.Box 1\nMalaria\nA 26-year-old woman visited her GP with a 3-day history of flu-like symptoms. She had returned from a 2-week holiday to The Gambia 3 weeks previously but did not volunteer this information and the GP did not ask about travel. She was apyrexial with no abnormal findings on examination. The GP diagnosed a viral illness and recommended paracetamol and plenty of fluid. Three days later, she presented to her local emergency department. She was febrile, confused, tachycardic and dehydrated. Her respiratory rate was 24 breaths per minute but her chest was clear. A travel history was elicited from her family. An urgent blood film showed Plasmodium falciparum with a parasitaemia of 15.2%. In addition to cerebral malaria there was evidence of renal failure with a serum creatinine of 312 micromol/litre. She was given intravenous quinine and transferred to intensive care in a regional infectious diseases unit where she received intravenous artesunate. Fortunately, she made a complete recovery.\nLearning points\n\u2022Patients often do not volunteer their travel history\u2022The initial presenting symptoms and signs of many tropically acquired infections are often non-specific\u2022Any delay in the diagnosis of falciparum malaria can lead to serious and sometimes fatal consequences\u2022Nearly all patients with malaria give a history of fever but approximately half are afebrile on presentation15\n\nBox 2\nSalmonella typhi\nA 34-year-old man returned to the UK after spending 4 weeks visiting his family in Bangladesh. His travel vaccinations, including typhoid and Hepatitis A, had been updated beforehand. One week before his return he had developed a febrile illness and was treated for malaria with no improvement. After further blood tests, was told he had typhoid and was treated with ciprofloxacin. On arrival home, he presented to hospital with fever, headache and a dry cough. He had a temperature of 39.0\u00b0C and a respiratory rate of 28 breaths per minute. Although tachycardic, he had an adequate blood pressure. His chest was clear and he had 2-cm hepatomegaly. Investigations revealed a normal differential white count, normal renal function, mildly raised transaminases and a clear chest radiograph. A provisional diagnosis of enteric fever was made and his antibiotic was changed to intravenous ceftriaxone. He gradually improved. Two sets of blood cultures taken before changing the antibiotic were sterile and so a bone marrow aspirate was performed. Bone marrow cultures confirmed the presence of Salmonella typhi, resistant to ciprofloxacin. Following 3 days of intravenous ceftriaxone, treatment was changed to oral azithromycin. He completed 14 days of effective therapy.\nLearning points\n\u2022Enteric fever is an uncommon but important cause of fever, particularly in returning travellers from Asia\u2022Vaccination provides incomplete protection against Salmonella typhi and none against S. paratyphi\n\u2022Many resource-limited settings lack facilities for blood culture and so use serology (Widal's test) instead. In most settings this lacks sensitivity and specificity and is often positive in individuals who have previously been vaccinated. It is not recommended\u2022Blood cultures have a sensitivity of >80% with their highest yield within the first week of symptoms.16 Stool and urine cultures become positive after the first week of illness. Although invasive, a bone marrow aspirate has a higher sensitivity than blood culture and should be considered in patients who have already taken antibiotics16\n\u2022More than three-quarters of isolates imported into the UK from Asia are resistant to fluoroquinolones, but remain sensitive to ceftriaxone. This is therefore the recommended first-line agent, particularly for severe disease17, 18, 19\n\u2022Ciprofloxacin remains the most effective treatment option if the isolate is proven to be sensitive\u2022Azithromycin is an alternative for uncomplicated infection. Although azithromycin sensitivity testing is not readily available, recent data from Public Health England suggest that resistance is infrequent but increasing17, 19\n\u2022Regardless of which antibiotic is used, fever takes several days to respond. If the isolate is known to be sensitive, failure to defervesce is not a reason to change antibiotics\n",

            "text": "\n\u2022\nTravel destination: the risk of acquiring an infection whilst travelling varies according to the country visited (Table 1\n), the local environs (urban or rural) and the activities or exposures encountered.4, 5, 6 Malaria is the most important cause of fever in travellers returning from sub-Saharan Africa (see Malaria on pages 100\u2013106 of this issue).4, 7 Even when rural exposure in West Africa within 21 days of symptom onset raises the possibility of viral haemorrhagic fever (VHF), malaria remains far more likely and should always be excluded (Table 1). If in doubt, isolate the patient whilst advice is sought from an infectious diseases specialist (see \u2018Whom to ask for help?\u2019). Among travellers returning from Asia or the Caribbean, dengue is a more probable diagnosis, whereas enteric fever is more likely in travellers from south central Asia.4 It is often worth asking the patient whether they are aware of any local outbreaks whilst travelling (e.g. Ebola, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) \u2013 see also Emerging infectious diseases MEDICINE 2014: 42(1): 60\u201363) or local areas of particularly high endemic risk (e.g. schistosomiasis).\u2022\nPurpose and duration of travel: travellers visiting friends and relatives (VFR), expatriates, overseas healthcare workers and backpackers often stay for longer periods than tourists and may have closer contact with local populations. They are therefore at greater risk of acquiring malaria, typhoid, tuberculosis, Hepatitis A and sexually-transmitted infections, including HIV.8, 9, 10, 11, 12 Military personnel and travellers to isolated geographical locations under primitive conditions may come into close contact with specific vectors that put them at high risk of infections such as rickettsial disease and leishmaniasis.\u2022\nSpecific activities: fresh-water exposure, safaris and sexual exposure put individuals at risk of specific infections (Table 2\n). For example, a diagnosis of African trypanosomiasis should be considered in febrile travellers who recall painful bites whilst on safari in East/Central Africa.\u2022\nImmune status: travellers with HIV or malignancy and those taking long-term corticosteroids or other immunomodulatory drugs are at increased risk of opportunistic infections (Table 2). In contrast, migrants returning to their country of origin may be immune to certain infections (e.g. Hepatitis A, Katayama fever (acute schistosomiasis)).\u2022\nPreventative measures: no vaccination, chemoprophylaxis or insect repellent is 100% effective but most interventions reduce the risk of acquiring infection and sometimes the severity of the resulting illness. Malaria prophylaxis is often taken inadequately, particularly by VFRs who may falsely consider themselves immune to malaria; this can delay symptom onset and lead to initial blood films being falsely negative.8, 13\n\n",
