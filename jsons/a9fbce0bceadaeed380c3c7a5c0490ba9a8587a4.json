            "text": "The first type of concentration technique mentioned in Table 2 is passive adsorption. This technique, originated by MacCallum et aLs7 involves the use of pads consisting of either gauze alone or a combination of gauze and cotton batting for the purpose of absorbing a portion of the water sample into which the pads are placed. A small portion of the viruses suspended in the water sample are taken into these pads during the passive absorption process. Any actual adsorption of viruses onto the surface of the gauze or cotton fibers is incidental. The pads may be used in either a stationary or flow-through configuration.r\".\"i Viruses are recovered from the pads by expression of the absorbed fluid. Additional fluids may be used in kneading the pads to help achieve recovery of any adsorbed viruses. Fluids used for desorbing viruses from surfaces are termed eluants, and the process is termed elution. Following exposure to an adsorbing surface, it is hoped that the fluid, or eluate, will contain any viruses that had been on the surface. The relatively low efficiency of gauze pads for concentrating viruses from water was demonstrated, however, by a study in which such pads were used for prefiltering a water sample to remove large particulate solids, before concentrating the viruses from the same water sample by passage through a layer of virus-adsorbing granular material.:{' Directed adsorption involves the use of either filters or granular solids as surfaces onto which viruses are deliberately adsorbed and then ~~~~~~~~~~l~.~~.27.~0.~4.~~7.44,4~,~~-~~ Ad. sorption is generally facilitated by modifying the water sample, the adsorbent material, or both. The adsorbent material can be modified either duringor after its manufacture. Subsequent recovery of the adsorbed viruses can occur either by dissolving the filter material, if it is composed of alginate,\"\" or by exposing the adsorbent to a volume of eluant that is smaller than the original water sample and facilitates a reversal of the virus adsorption process. Most techniques now used for concentrating viruses from large volumes of either tap water or environmental freshwaters belong to the category of directed adsorption. These techniques are discussed in greater detail later in this article. The general mechanisms involved in concentration methods of this type have been presented in publications by Gartner, \"' England, \"\" Cookson, fifi Mix, 67 and Sweet et Viruses are adsorbed onto the surface of filter materials or granular solids, facilitated in many instances by pretreatment of the water. Processes evaluated as pretreatments include removing soluble organics from the water using charged resins, adjustment of the water sample pH, and addition of salts of metal cations-particularly those that are multivalent such as aluminum and magnesium. Efforts have also been made to pretreat the adsorbent material itself to enhance the efficiency of viral adsorption. Examples of the latter approach include binding metal precipitates or charged polymers to the matrix of microporous filters. Subsequent recovery of the bound viruses from the filter materials or granular solids used as adsorbents is achieved by exposing the adsorbents to an eluant. Viruses are retained in the original water sample during a reduction of its volume achieved by pore size exclusion. This generally is accomplished by either recirculating the water under pressure through hollow fiber filters or over the surface of flat sheet filters in either recirculating or nonrecirculating systems. In some cases an eluant is subsequently passed through the same concentration unit to facilitate virus recovery. Viruses are concentrated either by association with a generated precipitate or by selective partitioning of the water sample during processes that yield a polymeric phase separation, or they are retajned in the original water sample during a reduction in its volume through hydroextraction.",

In the case of electron microscopy, the target material is virus particles, termed virions, that appear intact. Some assay techniques detect only infectious virions, a category that may differ from those virions recognizable by electron microscopy as visually intact but somehow damaged or deficient so that they lack infectiousness. Still other techniques detect only either viral proteins or nucleic acids. The second stage of the various detection methods consists of target recognition; this is considered a nonvisual step. Target recognition, in turn, facilitates the third stage of the detection methods, visualization of the target material. Target visualization may be direct, as in observing virions by electron microscopy, or indirect, as in observing changes induced within host cells as a result of successful viral infection.

For some types of bacteriophages, the ratio of viral particles to infectious units can be as little as between 1 and 2.5.

Cytopathogenicity assays are based on the appearance of visibly observable, characteristically recognizable changes in the morphology of living host cells that result from the process of viral infection. Such changes, termed \"cytopathogenic effects,\" can be assessed by microscopic examination of the infected cells. Plaque assays detect the production of focal areas of death within an infected culture of cells. Detecting these areas of cell death is often facilitated by exposing the culture of cells to a vital stain such as neutral red. At modest concentrations neutral red does not interfere with cellular viability, yet it causes live cells to appear pink and dead cells to appear colorless. Plaques, which represent the focal areas of cell death, are normally detected by visual examination of the cultures without the aid of a microscope. Explanations of the procedures used in assaying virus preparations by either cytopathogenicity or plaque production, along with specific information on their use with environmental samples and comparisons of their relative effectiveness for this purpose, can be found in references 111 and 113-117. Recent advances for these types of assays include the deliberate use of mixed cell types within single cultures that are to be inoculated with virus samples. Another example is the treatment of cell cultures with nucleotideanalogs such as iododeoxyuridine before the introduction of sample material, both of which can increase assay sensitivity.\"' Immunological assays. Immunoassays are based on an identity binding between antibodies, used as \"probes,\" and specific \"target\" antigens of interest to the observer. This identity binding is a natural recognition process and serves as an aid in determining the presence of the target antigens. In thecaseof viruses, such target antigens may be serologically distinctive portions of either proteins, glycoproteins, or glycolipids. Depending on the laboratory protocol followed, these antigens may be suspended in aqueous solutions, trapped on filters, or associated with infected cells. The antibodies used as probes may first be \"tagged\" or \"labeled\" to facilitate subsequently identifying the presence of target antigens with which theantibodies bind. Methods used for the taggingof antibodies include chemically incorporating radioactive isotopes into the molecular structure of the antibodies, which can then be detected by the isotope emissions.

The first of these involves the detection of emissions from radioactive isotopes incorporated within the probe nucleic acid material.124,1~5 A second, two-step method involves the use of probe nucleic acids that contain nucleotides tagged, or joined by covalent linkage, to markers such as biotin. In this case, the biotin moieties attached to the probe nucleic acids can, in turn, serve as binding sites for molecules of avidin, which are themselves covalently linked to an enzyme such as horseradish peroxidase. Avidin is a natural compound that binds to biotin with high affinity. In this type of assay, the bound nucleic acid probe material is subsequently detected, as is done for enzyme immunoassays, by measuring the enzyme-mediated conversion of added substrate into products. The use of nucleic acid probes to directly detect viral genomic nucleic acid produced within infected cells is termed in situ nucleic acid hybridization. This process is conceptually similar to using antibodies as probes for detecting viral antigens associated with infected cells. The major difference is whether the target material consists of viral antigens or viral genomic nucleic acids. The use of nucleic acid probes for detecting viral nucleic acid that has been trapped on filter material is termed blot nucleic acid hybridization. A more detailed discussion on the use of nucleic acid probe hybridization assays for virus detection has been published by Norval and Bingham.i2\" Comparison of viral assay methods. One important point to consider regarding the use of different assay techniques for identifying viruses in environmental samples, and particularly for viral particles recovered from samples subjected to drinking water treatment, is whether the assay result represents infectivity. None of the two types of electron microscopy procedures, the solution ELISA, nor the blot styles of immunoassay and nucleic acid hybridization assay can, by themselves, reveal this most important piece of information. Their results are instead qualitative or semiquantitative. The other methods compared in Figure 1 are directly usable for quantitating viral infectivity because they are based on detecting changes within host cells that are specifically caused by viral replication. The various changes measured are the disruption of normal cytomorphology (cytopathogenicity), overt cell death (plaque assay), and the production of either viral-specific antigens (immunofluorescence and enzyme immunoassay) or nucleic acid (in situ hybridization). The electron microscopy, solution ELISA, or blotting techniques could be used for estimating the infectivity of viruses present in samples if a part of the sample is examined directly as collected and another part of the same sample is then inoculated into a host cell system supporting the production of viral products that could later be measured by the same type of assay.",

This article presents information on the actual target materials detected by the various assay techniques and information on evaluating whether a particular type of assay procedure provides a direct measure of viral infectivity. Variations of the nucleic acid hybridization assay may represent the optimum balance for viral assay techniques by simultaneously combining sensitivity, determination of viral infectivity, and rapidity with which the assay can be completed. Cytopathogenicity, cell immunofluorescence, and in situ hybridization for the detection of indigenous adenoviruses present in concentrates produced from environmental samples are compared in Table 8 . These data indicate that the overall numbers of infectious viral units detected by either cytopathogenicity or immunofluorescence were approximately equivalent. The number of viruses detected by in situ hybridization was approximately 40 percent greater than that revealed by the other two techniques. Analysis of these results by means of the paired two-tailed T-test revealed that the differences in mean values between the titers obtained by cytopathogenicity and immunofluorescence were not significantly different (p = 0.67). The mean value of the titers obtained by in situ hybridization were, however, significantly different from those obtained by either cytopathogenicity (p = 0.010) or immunofluorescence (p = 0.003).
