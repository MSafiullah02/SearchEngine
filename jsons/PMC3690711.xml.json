            "text": "A bit more than ten years ago, Protein Science published a review entitled \u201cNatively unfolded proteins: a point where biology waits for physics\u201d (Protein Sci 2002 11(4):739\u2013756).1 The major goal of that article was to bring an intriguing protein family of natively unfolded proteins (which are recognized now to constitute a subset of a very broad class of intrinsically disordered proteins, IDPs) out of shadow, to emphasize their lack of ordered structure under physiological conditions (at least ordered structure that could be detected by traditional low resolution techniques), to systemize their major structural properties, and to highlight their biological significance. The introduction of such biologically active but essentially unstructured proteins was used to challenge the hitherto dominant structure-centric viewpoint (structure\u2013function paradigm), according to which a specific function of a protein is determined by its unique and rigid three-dimensional (3D) structure. The title of the review (\u201ca point where biology waits for physics\u201d) was inspired by the observations that many of such \u201cstructure-less\u201d proteins analyzed by that time acted as \u201cbinders\u201d that did undergo at least partial folding after interaction with their binding partners. These observations provoked an idea that these biologically important proteins with little or no ordered structure have to wait to become more folded (and functional) as a result of binding to their specific partners. In other words, for these proteins, \u201cbiology,\u201d that is, the ability to have biological functions, seemed to wait for \u201cphysics\u201d which is manifested in their ability to undergo binding-induced folding (at least partial), which is necessary to bring the functional state of these proteins to life.1",

This structure\u2013function paradigm that describes reasonably well the catalytic behavior of enzymes was based on the \u201clock-and-key\u201d hypothesis formulated in 1894 by Emil Fischer.2 This viewpoint was solidified by the successful solution of X-ray crystallographic structures of many proteins (as of February 26, 2013 there were 81,922 protein structures in the Protein Data Bank,3 with 72,761 of these structures being determined by X-ray crystallography). These many crystal structures reinforced a static view of functional protein, where a rigid active site of an enzyme can be viewed as a sturdy lock that provides an exact fit to only one key, a specific and unique substrate.4 Despite numerous limitations, this lock-and-key model was an extremely fruitful concept that was responsible for the creation of modern protein science.1\nFigure 1(A) shows some of the most obvious scientific consequences of the application of structure\u2013function paradigm which is deservedly placed at the center of the \u201cBig Bang\u201d model that gives rise to the protein science universe.1",

            "text": "Obviously, the consideration of a protein as a rigid crystal-like entity is an oversimplification, since even the most stable and well-folded proteins are dynamic systems that possess different degrees of conformational flexibility. This is because of the simple fact that so-called conformational forces, that is, forces stabilizing the secondary structure of a protein and its tertiary fold, are weak and can be broken even at ambient temperatures due to thermal fluctuations.4 The breaking of these weak interactions releases the groups that were involved in these interactions and gives them the possibility to be involved in the formation of new weak interactions of comparable energy.4 Since these structural rearrangements are of relatively small scale and since they occur typically in a time scale that is faster than the time required for structure determination by X-ray crystallography and many other physical techniques, the 3-D structures of proteins determined by these techniques represent averaged pictures.6 Furthermore, one should keep in mind that not all proteins structures which are deposited to PDB are structured throughout their entire lengths. Instead, many PDB proteins have portions of their sequences missing from the determined structures (so-called regions of missing electron density)7,8 due to the failure of the unobserved atom, side chain, residue, or region to scatter X-rays coherently caused by their flexible or disordered nature. Such flexible/disordered regions are rather common in the PDB, since only about 30% of protein structures deposited in the PDB do not have such regions of missing electron density.9",

As it is often the case for new scientific concepts, the idea of structure-less functionality went through the stages of passive ignorance and active denial to scrupulous examination and enthusiastic acceptance. For example, it took me more than a year to publish my first paper dedicated to the systematic analysis of such proteins, and the manuscript was successively rejected by 14 journals before it was finally accepted by Proteins.12 However, time showed that the concept of protein intrinsic disorder was a useful invention and could be considered as a universal lock-pick that helps in solving many of the seemingly unsolvable problems in protein science. One could say that this idea gave a new boost to the development of the protein science, generating a wide array of principally novel research directions [see Fig. 1(B)].",

In fact, using computational tools developed for sequence-based intrinsic disorder prediction the wide spread of IDPs and hybrid proteins containing IDPRs was convincingly shown.43\u201346 For example, more than 15,000 out of 91,000 proteins in the then-current Swiss Protein database were identified as having long IDPRs.47 The published in 2000 analysis of 31 whole genomes that span the 3 kingdoms of life revealed that many proteins contained segments predicted to have \u2265 40 consecutive disordered residues and that the eukaryotes exhibited more disorder by these measures than either the prokaryotes or the archaea.43 Other studies on the abundance of intrinsic disorder in various evolutionary distant species supported these findings and consistently showed that the eukaryotic proteomes had higher fraction of intrinsic disorder than prokaryotic proteomes.44,48\u201352",

A gap in the plot of fraction of disordered residues on proteome size parallels a morphological gap between prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells which contain many complex innovations that seemingly arose all at once. In other words, this sharp jump in the disorder content in proteomes associated with the transition from prokaryotic to eukaryotic cells suggests that the increase in the morphological complexity of the cell paralleled the increased usage of intrinsic disorder.46 The variability of disorder content in unicellular eukaryotes and rather weak correlation between disorder status and organism complexity (measured as the number of different cell types) is likely related to the wide variability of their habitats, with especially high levels of disorder being found in parasitic host-changing protozoa, the environment of which changes dramatically during their life-span.53 The further support for this hypothesis came from the fact that the intrinsic disorder content in multicellular eukaryotes (which are characterized by more stable and less variable environment of individual cells) was noticeably less variable than that in the unicellular eukaryotes.46",

These observations seem to indicate that the sequence space of IDPs/IDPRs should be simpler than that of ordered proteins. However, the reality is more complex than conventional wisdom might suggest, and the sequence space attainable by simple IDPs/IDPRs is more diversified than that of the structurally more sophisticated ordered proteins. In fact, a 100 residue-long protein in which any of the normally occurring 20 amino acids can be found has a sequence space of 20100 (\u223c10130) sequences.54 Obviously, not all random amino acid sequences can fold into unique structures. In other words, a sequence space of a foldable protein (or \u201cfoldable\u201d sequence space) is noticeably smaller than the entire sequence space available for a random polypeptide chain. For decades, the actual size of \u201cfoldable\u201d sequence space continues to be unsolved mystery despite a large body of theoretical, biochemical, and computational work that aims to unravel the relationship between a protein's primary sequence and its resulting 3D structure.55 However, the actual number of different amino acid residues in a given foldable sequence can be dramatically reduced,54 since all twenty residues are not necessary for protein folding and the actual physicochemical identity of most of the amino acids in a protein is irrelevant.56\u201363 In other words, folding alphabet can be noticeably reduced,55,64 and amino acids can be clustered based on some shared features such as homolog substitution frequency,65 local structural environments,66 or peculiarities of the tertiary structural environments.67 This simplified folding code further reduces the available \u201cfoldable\u201d sequence space.68",

Therefore, they do not possess an entire folding code that defines the ability of foldable proteins to fold spontaneously into a unique biologically active structure. The missing portion of the IDP folding code (or at least part of it) is supplemented by binding partner(s). This defines a principal difference between structured proteins and IDPs/IDPRs: foldable proteins fold first and then bind to their partners whereas IDPs/IDPRs remain disordered until they interact with their partners.68,69 Furthermore, many IDPs/IDPRs do not require folding to be functional,1,4,13,14,70\u201373 and some of them form fuzzy complexes, in which they preserve significant amount of disorder.74,75 All this suggests that the sequence space of IDPs (at least those which either do not fold at all or do not completely fold at binding) is noticeably greater than the \u201cfoldable\u201d sequence space due to the removal of restrictions posed by the need to gain ordered structure spontaneously.68 This represents one of the conundrums of intrinsic disorder, where the apparent sequence redundancy and simplicity are combined with the lack of structural restrains leading to the increase in the dimensions and complexity of the available sequence space.",

In fact, for a long time, IDPs were considered mostly \u201cunstructured\u201d or \u201cnatively unfolded\u201d polypeptide chains. This was mostly due to the fact that the majority of IDPs analyzed at early stages of the field contained very little ordered structure, that is, they were really mostly unstructured or unfolded. Finding and characterization of such \u201cstructure-less\u201d proteins was important to build up a strong case to counter-point the dominant view represented by the classical sequence-to-structure-to-function paradigm, especially since such fully unstructured, yet functional proteins clearly represented the other extreme of the protein structure\u2013function spectrum.16 The top half of the Figure 3 illustrates this situation by opposing rock-like ordered proteins and cooked spaghetti-like IDPs.",

However, the unusualness is a subjective feature, and from the viewpoint of polymer physics the extended IDPs/IDPRs possess the expected behavior of flexible and charged polymers, whereas the behavior of an ordered protein is rather unexpected (i.e., due to the existence of the native ensemble that for well-folded, ordered proteins can be approximated as a harmonic well around a unique, well-defined equilibrium structure).

However, natural polypeptides have originated as random copolymers of amino acids, which were adjusted or \u201cselected\u201d over evolution based on their functional capacities.56,81 Despite their differences in primary amino acid sequences, protein molecules in a number of conformational states behave as polymer homologues, suggesting that the volume interactions can be considered as a major driving force responsible for the formation of equilibrium structures or structural ensembles.82 For example, ordered globular proteins and molten globules (both as folding intermediates of globular proteins or as examples of collapsed IDPs) exhibit key properties of polymer globules, where the fluctuations of the molecular density are expected to be much less than the molecular density itself. Extended IDPs (both intrinsic coils and intrinsic pre-molten globules) and ordered proteins in the pre-molten globule intermediate state possess properties of squeezed coils, since water is a poor solvent for a polypeptide. In fact, even high concentrations of strong denaturants (e.g., urea and GdmCl) are very likely to be bad solvents for protein chains, resulting in the preservation of extensive residual structure even under these harsh denaturing conditions.82",

Following these ideas, it was shown that water is a poor solvent for polypeptide backbone alone and for the IDPs containing long tracts of polar amino acid residues since polar homo-polypeptides without hydrophobic groups (e.g., polyglutamine or glycine-serine block copolypeptides) were shown to prefer collapsed ensembles in aqueous media.83\u201388 Furthermore, even polyglycine was shown to have a tendency to form heterogeneous ensembles of collapsed structures in water.88",

The first class is comprised by polar tracts which collapse due to water being a poor solvent for a backbone and non-charged side chains. The second class is represented by weak polyelectrolytes and weak polyampholytes, which have low per residue net charge and low fractions of positively and/or negatively charged residues. These IDPs/IDPRs form collapsed structures since the driving force responsible for the collapse is not overcome by the intramolecular electrostatic repulsion between the charged side-chains and by their favorable free energies of solvation. Furthermore, if such IDPs/IDPRs possess polyampholytic nature, their globular state could be additionally stabilized by electrostatic interactions between the oppositely charged side-chains. Finally, IDPs/IDPRs from the third class are strong polyampholytes characterized by high fractions of positively and/or negatively charged residues but have low per residue net charge. Such intrinsically disordered protein can form collapsed structures stabilized mostly by multiple electrostatic interactions between solvated side-chains of opposite sign.89",

On the other hand, the collapsed-coil FG-domains were prone to oligomerize. These observations suggested that different types of FG-domains with different aggregation propensities provide molecular basis for two different gating mechanisms operating at the nuclear pore complex at distinct locations; one acting as a hydrogel, and the other as an entropic brush.94 Therefore, the abundance and peculiarities of the charged residues distribution within the protein sequences might determine physical and biological properties of extended IDPs and IDPRs.",

Similarly, extended IDPs/IDPRs are characterized by the \u201cturned out\u201d response to changes in pH,96,99\u2013102 where a decrease (or increase) in pH induces their partial folding due to the minimization of their high net charges viewed at neutral pH, thereby decreasing charge/charge intramolecular repulsion and permitting hydrophobic-driven collapse to the partially folded conformation.95",

For example, similar to typical water soluble proteins, the TM regions of membrane proteins are often highly structured, containing \u03b1-helices109 or \u03b2-structure,110 which are especially likely to occur due to the low dielectric constant values within the membrane bilayers.111,112 On the other hand, the exterior regions of TM proteins are much more apolar than the exteriors of water-soluble proteins.113\u2013115 Therefore, the peculiarities of the membrane environment, with its highly nonpolar nature originating either from lipids or from protein interiors, are especially unfavorable for intrinsic disorder, since propensity for intrinsic disorder is typically encoded in a high content of polar and charged residues. Therefore, the IDPRs found in integral membrane proteins would be expected to be generally localized within the regions external to the membrane bilayer.108 Also, the distinctive environment of the membrane bilayer imposes constraints on the amino acid composition of integral membrane proteins, even on the regions external to the membrane bilayer.116,117 Comprehensive bioinformatics analysis revealed that integral membrane proteins commonly possess IDPRs defined as regions of missing electron density in their crystal structures.108 Comparison of the IDPRs found in the \u03b1-helical and the \u03b2-barrel bundle integral membrane proteins with the IDPRs viewed in typical water-soluble proteins revealed the existence of statistically distinct amino acid compositional biases characteristic for these three protein classes. Therefore, the use of specific amino acid signatures of IDPRs found in TM helical bundles and \u03b2-barrels can potentially lead to significantly more accurate disorder predictions for these two classes of integral membrane proteins.108",

This analysis revealed that \u223c44% and \u223c34% of Swiss-Prot functional keywords were associated with ordered and disordered proteins, respectively, whereas 22% functional keywords yielded ambiguity in the likely function\u2013structure associations.138\u2013140 Interestingly, most of the structured protein-associated key words were shown to be related to enzymatic activities, whereas the majority of the disordered protein-associated keywords were related to signaling and regulation. These results agree well with the notion that enzymatic catalysis requires ordered structure and that effectiveness of signaling is dependent on binding reversibility, a property directly associated with the thermodynamics of disorder-to-order transition induced by binding.138\u2013140",

This model was subsequently expanded to include a fourth state (pre-molten globule) and transitions between all four states.1 In reality, based on the outlined above idea of the continuous spectrum of protein structures, functional proteins contain various amounts of intrinsic disorder and this continuous structural spectrum of protein defines their limitless functional variability.",

In other words, the distance between nodes in these scale-free networks follows a power-law distribution.172 Based on their spatiotemporal peculiarities protein hubs were grouped into two broad categories, \u201cdate hubs\u201d that binds their numerous partners sequentially, and \u201cparty hubs\u201d simultaneously interacting with their partners.173 Since many IDPs are known to be involved in interaction with large number of distinct partners, they clearly can be considered as hubs in the scale-free protein\u2013protein interaction networks.78,134 Based on the systematic analysis of several know hub proteins134 followed by a series of robust bioinformatics studies,93,160\u2013164 it was concluded that hubs commonly use disordered regions to bind to multiple partners and that there are at least two primary mechanisms by which disorder is utilized in protein\u2013protein interaction networks where one disordered region binds to many partners or many disordered region bind to one partner.134",

However, the AT-hooks (which are DNA-binding motifs present in many proteins which binds to the (ATAA) and (TATT) repeats of DNA) and basic regions of TF DNA-binding domains are highly disordered suggesting that eukaryotes with their well-developed gene transcription machinery require transcription factor flexibility to be more efficient.175 A number of interesting and important roles were also ascribed to intrinsic disorder in TFs related to the regulation of heat shock response (so called heat shock factors, HSFs)180 and in the reprogramming TFs (the Yamanaka factors, namely Sox2, Oct3/4 (Pou5f1), Klf4, and c-Myc, and the Thomson factors, namely Sox2, Oct3, Lin28, and Nanog) overexpression of which is known to generate induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells from terminally differentiated somatic cells.181",

One of the illustrative examples of this regulatory role of intrinsic disorder is the canonical Wnt-pathway that involves five proteins, Axin, CKI-\u03b1, GSK-3\u03b2, APC (adenomatous polyposis coli, also known as deleted in polyposis 2.5 protein), and \u03b2-catenin (all shown to contain long IDPRs). This pathway is known to play a number of crucial roles in the development of organism, and the malfunctions of which might lead to various diseases including cancer.182 The comprehensive analysis of published data revealed that IDPRs found in Wnt-pathway proteins orchestrate protein\u2013protein interactions, and facilitate PTMs and signaling.182 Furthermore, the scaffold protein Axin and another large protein, APC, are heavily enriched in disorder and act as flexible concentrators in gathering together all other proteins involved in the Wnt-pathway.182 Intriguingly, the multifarious roles of highly disordered APC in regulation of \u03b2-catenin function were established by showing that disordered APC helps the collection of \u03b2-catenin from cytoplasm, facilitates the \u03b2-catenin delivery to the binding sites on Axin, and controls the final detachment of \u03b2-catenin from Axin.182",

            "text": "Physically, binding is considered as joining objects together and suggests spatial and temporal fixation of bound partners. The formation of protein complexes with specific binding partners is expected to bring some fixation (at least at the binding site). Therefore, disordered complexes where interaction of a disordered protein with the binding partners is not accompanied by a disorder-to-order transition within the interaction interface clearly cannot be described by the classical binding paradigm. This contradiction can be resolved assuming that the ordered binding partner and/or disordered protein contain multiple low affinity binding sites. The existence of several similar binding sites combined with a highly flexible and dynamic structure of disordered protein creates a unique situation where any binding site of disordered protein can interact with any binding site of its partner with almost equal probability, in a staccato manner. The low affinity of each individual contact implies that each of them is not stable and can be readily broken. Therefore, such disordered or fuzzy complex can be envisioned as a highly dynamic ensemble in which a disordered protein does not present a single binding site to its partner but resemble a \u201cbinding cloud,\u201d in which multiple identical binding sites are dynamically distributed in a diffuse manner. In other words, in this staccato-type interaction mode, an disordered protein rapidly changes multiple binding sites while probing binding site(s) of its partner.201 An additional factor which can help holding a dynamic complex together could be a weak long-range attraction between protein molecules.213 This long-range attraction is universal for all protein solutions and has a range several times that of the diameter of the protein molecule, much greater than the range of the screened electrostatic repulsion.213",

            "text": "The most common outcome of these function-related structural changes is the overall increase in the amount of ordered structure. However, functions of some ordered proteins require local or even global unfolding of a unique protein structure.68 Among specific features of these structural alterations are their induced nature and transient character combined with a wide range of molecular mechanisms by which they can be promoted.68 These functional unfolding-activating factors include light; mechanical force; changes in pH, temperature, or redox potential; interaction with membrane, ligands, nucleic acids, and proteins; various PTMs; release of autoinhibition due to the unfolding of autoinhibitory domains induced by their interaction with nucleic acids, proteins, membranes, PTMs, and so forth.68 Among rather unusual factors used by nature to activate proteins via functional unfolding are light and mechanical force. For example, exposure to blue light results in the activation of the photoactive yellow protein (PYP), which is an ordered, water-soluble \u223c14 kDa protein that contains a thioester linked p-coumaric acid cofactor and serves as a photosensor in Ectothiorhodospira halophila.214,215 PYP is a bacterial blue light sensor that undergoes conformational changes upon signal transduction. The absorption of a photon triggers substantial protein unfolding and leads to the formation of the transient signaling state that interacts with the partner molecules. This allows the swimming bacterium to operate the directional switch that protects it from harmful illumination. Comprehensive analysis combining double electron electron resonance spectroscopy (DEER), high resolution NMR, and time-resolved pump\u2013probe X-ray solution scattering (TR-SAXS/WAXS) revealed that the transiently activated and short-lived signaling state of the PYP possessed a large degree of disorder and existed as an ensemble of multiple conformers that exchange on a millisecond time scale.216,217 This unusual behavior is illustrated in Figure 4 that shows structures of inactive folded PYP and its light-activated functional form, which is highly disordered.68 Some proteins undergo local unfolding induced by the mechanical force and therefore can serve as force sensors.68 Among these natural force sensors are mechanosensitive ion channels that recognize and respond to the membrane tension, which is the mechanical forces applied along the plane of the cell membrane, rather than to the hydrostatic pressure perpendicular to the membrane plane.220 These ion channels are activated via partial unfolding of some of their functional parts induced by membrane tension.221",

It was stated that most IDPs (those which are not the artifacts of current methods of protein production) are in fact proteins waiting for a partner (PWPs) that serve as parts of a multi-component complex and that do not fold correctly in the absence of other components.29 Therefore, when folded after binding to their partners, these proteins are not too different from typical ordered proteins. However, one need to keep in mind that a portion of \u201cfolding code\u201d that defines the ability of ordered proteins to spontaneously gain a unique biologically active structure is missing for IDPs/IDPRs since they cannot fold spontaneously. This missing portion of the \u201cfolding code\u201d (or a part of it) can be supplemented by binding partner(s). As a result, ordered and disordered proteins can be discriminated on a simple basis of temporal correlation between their folding and binding: ordered proteins fold first and then bind to their partners while the IDPs/IDPRs remain disordered until they bind their partners and often preserve substantial disorder in the bound state.69 Furthermore, numerous cases of functional unfolding (or transient disorder, or upside-down functionality) represent further support to the concept of functional disorder by clearly showing that many proteins possess dormant disorder that needs to be awakened in order to make these proteins functional.",

However the IDP-encoding transcripts were generally less abundant than transcripts encoding ordered proteins due to the increased decay rates of the transcripts of genes encoding IDPs.222 Furthermore, IDPs were shown to be less abundant than ordered proteins due to the lower rate of protein synthesis and shorter protein half-lives. As the abundance and half-life in a cell of certain proteins can be further modulated via their PTMs such as phosphorylation,223 the experimentally determined yeast kinase\u2013substrate network was also analyzed. IDPs were shown to be substrates of twice as many kinases as were ordered proteins. Furthermore, the vast majority of kinases whose substrates were IDPs were either regulated in a cell-cycle dependent manner, or activated upon exposure to particular stimuli or stress.222 Therefore, PTMs may not only serve as important mechanism for the fine-tuning of the IDP functions but possibly they are necessary to tune the IDP availability under the different cellular conditions.222",

This tight control is directly related to the major roles of IDPs in signaling, where it is crucial to be available in appropriate amounts and not to be present longer than needed.222 It has been also pointed out that although the abundance of many IDPs is under strict control, some IDPs could be present in cells in large amounts or/and for long periods of time due to either specific PTMs or via interactions with other factors, which could promote changes in cellular localization of IDPs or protect them from the degradation machinery.13,70,138,223,224 Overall, this study clearly showed that the chaos seemingly introduced into the protein world by the discovery of IDPs is under the tight control.147",

In fact, essential proteins had on average a much higher fraction of disorder (0.36), had a higher number of proteins classified as completely disordered (19% vs. 2% for E. coli proteome), and were expressed at a higher level in all three media than an average E. coli gene.225 The manual literature mining for a group of E. coli proteins that had high levels of predicted intrinsic disorder revealed that the disorder predictions matched well with the experimentally elucidated regions of protein flexibility and disorder.225 A direct link between protein disorder and protein level in E. coli cells could be because the IDPs may carry out the essential control and regulation functions that are needed to respond to the various environmental conditions. Another possibility is that IDPs might undergo more rapid degradation compared to structured proteins, which cells can counter by increasing mRNA levels of the corresponding genes. In this case, higher synthesis and degradation rates could make the levels of these proteins very sensitive to the environment, with slight changes in either production or degradation leading to significant shifts in protein levels.225",

In a well-ordered protein, hydrogen bonds are shielded from water attack, preventing backbone hydration and the total or partial unfolding of the soluble structure under physiological conditions.226,227 Since soluble protein structures may be more or less vulnerable to water attack depending on their packing quality, a structural attribute, protein vulnerability, was introduced as the ratio of solvent-exposed backbone hydrogen bonds (which represent local weaknesses of the structure) to the overall number of hydrogen bonds.23 It has been also pointed out that structural vulnerability can be related to protein intrinsic disorder as the inability of a particular protein fold to protect intramolecular hydrogen bonds from water attack may result in backbone hydration leading to local or global unfolding. Since binding of a partner can help to exclude water molecules from the microenvironment of the preformed bonds, a vulnerable soluble structure gains extra protection of its backbone hydrogen bonds through the complex formation.226 To understand the role of structure vulnerability in transcriptome organization, the relationship between the structural vulnerability of a protein and the extent of co-expression of genes encoding its binding partners was analyzed. This study revealed that structural vulnerability can be considered as a determinant of transcriptome organization across tissues and temporal phases.23 Finally, by interrelating vulnerability, disorder propensity and co-expression patterns, the role of protein intrinsic disorder in transcriptome organization was confirmed, since the correlation between the extent of intrinsic disorder of the most disordered domain in an interacting pair and the expression correlation of the two genes encoding the respective interacting domains was evident.23",

In each of these pathological states, a specific protein or protein fragment changes from its natural soluble form into insoluble fibrils, which accumulate in a variety of organs and tissues.228\u2013234 Several unrelated proteins including many IDPs are known to be involved in these protein deposition diseases.234,235 An illustrative examples of human neurodegenerative diseases associated with IDPs includes Alzheimer's disease (deposition of amyloid-\u03b2, tau-protein, \u03b1-synuclein fragment NAC)236\u2013239; various taupathies (accumulation of tau-protein in the form of neurofibrillary tangles)238; Down's syndrome (nonfilamentous amyloid-\u03b2 deposits)240; Parkinson's disease and other synucleinopathies (deposition of \u03b1-synuclein)241; prion diseases (deposition of PrPSC)242; and a family of polyQ diseases, a group of neurodegenerative disorders caused by expansion of GAC trinucleotide repeats coding for PolyQ in the gene products.243 Furthermore, most mutations in rigid globular proteins associated with accelerated fibrillation and protein deposition diseases have been shown to destabilize the native structure, increasing the steady-state concentration of partially folded (disordered) conformers.228\u2013234",

However, there is another side to this coin: protein functionality. In fact, many of the proteins associated with the conformational disorders are also involved in recognition, regulation, and cell signaling. For example, functions ascribed to \u03b1-synuclein, a protein involved in several neurodegenerative disorders, include binding fatty acids and metal ions; regulation of certain enzymes, transporters, and neurotransmitter vesicles; and regulation of neuronal survival (reviewed in Ref.241). Overall, there are about 50 proteins and ligands that interact and/or co-localize with this protein. Furthermore, \u03b1-synuclein has amazing structural plasticity and adopts a series of different monomeric, oligomeric, and insoluble conformations (reviewed in Ref.24). The choice between these conformations is determined by the peculiarities of the protein environment, suggesting that \u03b1-synuclein has an exceptional ability to fold in a template-dependent manner. Therefore, the development of the conformational diseases may originate not only from misfolding but also from the misidentification, misregulation, and missignaling of the related proteins.",

Nine neurodegenerative disorders, including Kennedy's disease, Huntington's diseases, spinocerebellar atrophy-1, \u22122, \u22123, \u22126, 7, 17, and dentatorubral pallidoluysian atrophy are known to belong to this class of diseases.245\u2013248 In most polyQ diseases, expansion to over 40 repeats leads to the onset.248 It has been emphasized that such molecular processes as unfolded protein response, protein transport, synaptic transmission, and transcription are implicated in the pathology of polyQ diseases.244 Importantly, more than 20 transcription-related factors have been reported to interact with pathological polyQ proteins. Furthermore, these interactions were shown to repress the transcription, leading finally to the neuronal dysfunction and death (reviewed in Ref.244). These results suggest that polyQ diseases represent kind of transcriptional disorder,244 supporting our misidentification hypothesis for at least some of the conformational disorders.",

In a 2002 study, it was found that 79% of cancer-associated and 66% of cell-signaling proteins contain predicted regions of disorder of 30 residues or longer.130 In contrast, only 13% of a set of proteins with well-defined ordered structures contained such long regions of predicted disorder.130 In experimental studies, the presence of disorder has been directly observed in several cancer-associated proteins, including p53,249 p57kip2,250 Bcl-XL and Bcl-2,251 c-Fos,252 a thyroid cancer associated protein TC-1,253 EWS-FLI1 fusion protein that includes a potent transcriptional activator, the EWS domain, alongside the highly conserved DNA-binding domain FLI1,254,255 among many other examples. The best characterized example of the important cancer-related IDP is the tumor suppressor protein p53, which occupies the center of a large signaling network. p53 regulates expression of genes involved in numerous cellular processes, including cell cycle progression, apoptosis induction, DNA repair, as well as others involved in responding to cellular stress.256 When p53 function is lost, either directly through mutation or indirectly through several other mechanisms, the cell often undergoes cancerous transformation.257,258 Cancers showing mutations in p53 are found in colon, lung, esophagus, breast, liver, brain, reticuloendothelial tissues, and hemopoietic tissues.257 p53 is regulated by several different mechanisms including inhibition of its activity by interaction with E3 ubiquitin ligase Mdm2, which binds to a short stretch of p53 located within the transactivation domain. Mdm2-bound p53 cannot activate or inhibit other genes. Mdm2 ubiquitinates p53 and thus targets it for destruction. Mdm2 also contains a nuclear export signal that causes p53 to be transported out of the nucleus.259,260",

In fact, the rational design of enzyme inhibitors depends on the classical view where 3D-structure is an obligatory prerequisite for function. While generally applicable to many enzymatic domains, this view has persisted to influence thinking concerning all protein functions despite numerous examples to the contrary. This is most apparent in the observation that the vast majority of currently available drugs target the active site of enzymes, presumably since these are the only proteins for which the \u201cunique structure\u2013unique function\u201d paradigm is generally applicable.",

Both c-Myc and Max are intrinsically disordered in their monomeric forms. Upon heterodimerization, they undergo coupled binding and folding of their basic-helix-loop-helix-leucine zipper domains (bHLHZips). Since the deregulation of c-Myc is related to many types of cancer, the disruption of the c-Myc\u2013Max dimeric complex is one of the approaches for c-Myc inhibition. Several small molecules were found to inhibit the c-Myc\u2013Max dimer formation.275 These molecules were shown to bind to one of the three discrete sites within the 85-residue bHLHZip domain of c-Myc, which are composed of short contiguous stretches of amino acids that can selectively and independently bind small molecules.275 Inhibitor binding induces only local conformational changes, preserves the overall disorder of c-Myc, and inhibits interaction with Max.275 Furthermore, binding of inhibitors to c-Myc was shown to occur simultaneously and independently on the three independent sites. Based on these observations it has been concluded that a rational and generic approach to the inhibition of protein\u2013protein interactions involving IDPs may therefore be possible through the targeting of intrinsically disordered sequence.275",

However, detailed analyses of the conformational behavior and fine structure of several IDPs revealed that the preformed binding elements might be involved in a set of non-native intramolecular interactions. Based on these observations it was proposed that an intrinsically disordered polypeptide chain in its unbound state can be misfolded to sequester the preformed elements inside the non-interactive or less-interactive cage, therefore preventing these elements from the unnecessary and unwanted interactions with non-native binding partners.276 It is important to remember, however, that the mentioned functional misfolding is related to the ensemble behavior of transiently populated elements of structure. In other words, it describes the behavior of a globally disordered polypeptide chain containing highly dynamic elements of residual structure, so-called interaction-prone preformed fragments, some of which could potentially be related to protein function.276",

Although some proteins are unique for a given tissue, many more proteins have very wide distribution, being present in several tissues and organs. How can one develop tissue-specific drugs targeting such abundant proteins? Often, tissue specificity for many of the abundant proteins is achieved via the alternative splicing of the corresponding pre-mRNAs, which generates two or more protein isoforms from a single gene. Estimates indicate that between 35 and 60% of human genes yield protein isoforms by means of alternatively spliced mRNA.278 The added protein diversity from alternative splicing is thought to be important for tissue-specific signaling and regulatory networks in the multicellular organisms. The regions of alternative splicing in proteins are enriched in intrinsic disorder, and it was proposed that associating alternative splicing with protein disorder enables the time- and tissue-specific modulation of protein function.152 Since disorder is frequently utilized in protein binding regions, having alternative splicing of pre-mRNA coupled to IDPRs can define tissue-specific signaling and regulatory diversity.152 These findings open a unique opportunity to develop tissue-specific drugs modulating the function of a given ID protein/region (with a unique profile of disorder distribution) in a target tissue and not affecting the functionality of this same protein (with different disorder distribution profile) in other tissues.",

However, this hypothesis obviously would be wrong if earlier stages of evolution would be taken into account. In fact, the chances that the first polypeptides that appeared in the primordial soup of the primitive Earth possessed well-developed and unique 3D structures are minimal. The Earth formed about 4.5 billion years ago. Scientists dated the first fossils to 3.85 billion years ago. There are still debates and different theories about what happened in those years between the time the earth was cool enough to spawn life and the time the first fossils were formed. At the beginning of the 20th century, Oparin279 and Haldane280 proposed that some organic molecules could have been spontaneously produced from the gases of the primitive Earth atmosphere, assuming that this primitive atmosphere was reducing (as opposed to oxygen-rich), and there was an appropriate supply of energy, such as lightning or ultraviolet light. Thirty year later, this hypothesis (that constitutes a cornerstone of the theory of molecular evolution) received strong support from the elegant experiments of Stanley L. Miller and Harold C. Urey who were able to synthesize various organic compounds including some amino acids from non-organic compounds which were believed to represent the major components of the early Earth's atmosphere (water vapor, hydrogen, methane, and ammonia) by putting them into a closed system and running a continuous electric current through the system, to simulate lightning storms believed to be common on the early Earth.281,282 However, the Miller\u2013Urey experiment yielded only about half of the modern amino acids281,282 suggesting that the first proteins on Earth may have contained only a few amino acids.",

In fact, with only two exceptions, codons encoding one amino acid may differ in any of their three positions. However, only the third positions of some codons may be fourfold degenerate, that is, any nucleotide at this position specifies the same amino acid and all nucleotide substitutions at this site are synonymous. Using these observations as a reflection of the evolutionary development, it was proposed that there was a period during code evolution where the third position was not needed at all and a doublet code preceded the triplet code, giving rise to 4 \u00d7 4 = 16 codons encoding for 16 or fewer amino acids, if a termination codon is taken into account.285",

            "text": "Based on these and many other premises, one can discriminate evolutionary old and new amino acids. In 2000, Eduard N. Trifonov combined 40 different single-factor criteria into a consensus scale and proposed the following temporal order of addition for the amino acids: G/A, V/D, P, S, E/L, T, R, N, K, Q, I, C, H, F, M, Y, W.286 Even superficial analysis of this sequence reveals that many of the early amino acids (such as G, D, E, P, and S) are disorder-promoting, as they are very abundant in modern IDPs. On the other hand, the major order-promoting residues (C, W, Y, and F) were added to the genetic code late. This observation is further illustrated by Figure 5(A) which represents modern genetic code, contains information on the early and late codons (shown by light red and light blue colors, respectively), and on corresponding disorder- and order-promoting residues (shown by red and blue colors, respectively). Codons with intermediate age and disorder-neutral residues are shown by light pink and pink colors, respectively. Figure 5(A) illustrates that there is relatively good agreement between the \u201cage\u201d of the residue and its disorder-promoting capacity, with early residues being mostly disorder-promoting, and with the majority of late residues being mostly order-promoting. This conclusion follows from the abundance of the matching colors (light red-red, light blue-blue, and light pink-pink). There are only two noticeable exceptions from these rule, valine and leucine, which are early but order-promoting residues. This strongly suggests that the primordial polypeptides were intrinsically disordered.",

The fact that there is an entire class of polypeptides which do not have rigid structures but possess crucial biological function was heavily underappreciated and ignored for a very long time despite numerous examples scattered in literature. The work which started in my group as an attempt to understand what is so special about several natively unfolded proteins produced a real explosion of interest to structure-less proteins with biological functions. A new field was created and a lot of intriguing information was produced related to structures and functions of IDPs/IDPRs. There is no need to list once again all the discoveries and findings made in this field\u2014they are subjects of many recent reviews and some of them are briefly covered in this article. Although the amount of data generated during the past decade and a half on specific features related to the structural properties of IDPs and IDPRs, their abundance, distribution, functional repertoire, regulation, involvement into the disease pathogenesis, and so forth is vast, it seems that this mass of data produced so far is just a small tip of a humongous iceberg. IDPs/IDPRs continue to bring discoveries almost on a daily basis and even more breakthroughs are expected in future. Modern protein science is at the turning point, but biology still waits for physics. New models explaining various functions of IDPs, their evolution, and involvement in diseases are in great demand, together with the general theory unifying current knowledge on protein structure and function, and with novel experimental and computational tools for focused studies of IDPs/IDPRs.",

Each viral polyprotein was analyzed as a single polypeptide chain, without parsing it into the individual proteins before predictions. The proteome size is the number of proteins in the proteome of that species and is shown in log base. The average fraction of disordered residues is calculated by averaging the fraction of disordered residues of each sequence over the all sequences of that species.
