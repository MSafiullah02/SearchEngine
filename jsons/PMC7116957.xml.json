            "text": "Crises now frequently occur all over the world. In several fast-developing countries such as China, India, and Brazil, crises are appearing more often than we have expected. Especially in China, crisis information spread rapidly and influenced the whole society through social media such as Weibo (Chinese Twitter) and Youku (Chinese YouTube). Major crises, for instance, the Wenzhou online mass incident and the China\u2019s Red Cross credibility crisis in 2011, and the Hepatitis B vaccine scandal in 2013 have triggered public emergencies significantly through social media, which served as platforms for disseminating and exchanging information widely and instantaneously (Xie, Qiao, Shao, & Chen, 2016). In the era of Web 2.0, organizations could directly apply social media to start a dialogue with the massive audience. Meantime, publics were empowered in the online open space by actively participating in crises events (Romenti, Murtarelli, & Valentini, 2014; Xie et al., 2016), instead of being passive receivers of organizational information. Therefore, social media served as an ideal avenue for fostering dialogue between organizations and their publics in crises (Kent & Taylor, 2002; Romenti et al., 2014).",

For example, Tai and Sun (2007) demonstrated that in the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) crisis in 2003, the online tools have empowered the public to speak out and open the conversation with official claims in China. Cheng (2016b) explored the crisis communication of the Red Cross of China on Weibo and found that factors such as strict government control of information dissemination and closed culture of a Chinese non-profit organization (NPO) might inhibit effective dialogic conversations and lead to public distrust towards Chinese charitable organizations. Zhu et al. (2017) examined how McDonald\u2019s and KFC used social media during their 2012 crises in China and found crisis response strategies should be contextualized and based on specific cultural variations. Mou (2014) conducted a content analysis of 6,186 microblog posts on 12 food safety incidents in China and results illustrated how different types of micro-blogs gratify diversified needs of online publics.",

Through content analysis of 61 articles in 27 journals indexed in Web of Science core collection from 2006 to 2018, this paper gives an overview of current research trends such as theoretical frameworks and methodological preferences. Meanwhile, this study explores how social media has been changing dialogue between different types of organizations and their publics and the impact of unique contextual factors (e.g., cultural elements and political regimes) on the social-mediated dialogue. Aims of this study include three main dimensions: a) to enrich the global public relations literature by reviewing the SMCC research in a Chinese context. Not only a review is provided, but also a greater picture on theory building and practical implications of SMCC in China are addressed; b) to extend the dialogue research in China by exploring online dialogue between three types of organizations and their publics in crises; c) to illustrate how sophisticated cultural and political factors affect the SMCC practice in China.",

On the one hand, scholars found that social media could facilitate organizations to monitor crisis issues, open up-to-date conversations with publics, cultivate critical relationships, and create transparency of organizational actions (Jin & Liu, 2010; Macias, Hilyard, & Freimuth, 2009). On the other hand, misinformation, rumors, negative opinions, and emotions were amplified on social media and crisis managers might lose control of official messages when user-generated contents emerged or even dominated the public opinion (Liu, Jin, Austin, & Janoske, 2012; Wigley & Fontenot, 2010).",

(2012) created a social-mediated crisis communication model, serving as the first theoretical framework to describe relationships between organizations, online and offline publics, social media, traditional media, and word-of-mouth communication before, during and after crises (Austin, Fraustino, Jin, & Liu, 2017). This model has been widely tested using different methods such as experiments or interviews in the context of the United States. Scholars mainly discussed 1) how crisis information form, sources, crisis type and history might influence publics\u2019 (e.g., influential social media content creators, followers, and inactives) crisis responses; 2) how types of organizations (i.e., corporates, NPOs, and governments) may respond to publics effectively by adopting different crisis communication strategies (Liu, Jin, & Austin, 2013; Liu, Fraustino, & Jin, 2015).",

For instance, Lev-On (2012) adopted uses and gratifications (U & G) theory to examine publics\u2019 motivations of using social media in a natural disaster context. Cheng et al. (2019) continued to use the U & G approach and examined publics\u2019 gratifications-sought on social media of mobile devices during an earthquake in mainland China.

Pearson (1989) first considered \u201cdialogue\u201d as a public relations theory and he suggested that the ethical public relations practice was to have a dialogic system with publics. To outline a dialogic public relations theory, Kent and Taylor (2002) traced the roots of dialogue from interdisciplinary areas and defined dialogue as \u201can orientation that valued sharing and mutual understanding\u201d (Taylor & Kent, 2014, p. 388). They defined dialogic communication as \u201cany negotiated exchange of ideas and opinions\u201d (Kent & Taylor, 1998, p. 325). To extend the conceptualization of dialogue in crisis communication, Romenti et al. (2014) reviewed organizational development and management literature (Innes, 2004; Shotter, 2008) and they found that dialogue might not require mutuality or openness as public relations literature assumed. Instead, dialogue served strategic communication purposes, and organizations and their publics could adopt a dialogic approach for any single or two-way communicative interactions in crises (Romenti et al., 2014).",

Power distance, as an important contextual factor measures inequality across culture and affects the relational dialogue between organizations and their publics in crises (Mathew & Taylor, 2018; Sriramesh & Vercic, 2011; Taylor, 2000). For instance, practitioners\u2019 selection of communication models were different depending on levels of power distance in a society (Sriramesh & Vercic, 2011). In a low-power distance culture, which \u201cbetter supports the multilevel distribution of data, information, and certain types of knowledge\u201d (Leonard, Van Scotter, & Pakdil, 2009, p. 855), organizations preferred to apply a dialogic communication process with their publics in crises. In contrast, the high-power distance existed in Chinese societies and effectively influenced the crisis communication strategies and public responses in crises (Huang et al., 2016; Hwang, 1987). Organizations such as governments in a high-power distance nation were perceived to be very powerful and they avoided using extreme strategies and preferred passive crisis communicative strategies (Huang et al., 2016). Powerless individuals expecting an equal distribution of power might distrust organizations and reacted more strongly in crises than those in low-power distance nations. (Taylor, 2000).",

Rooted in Confucianism, the Chinese culture emphasized face (Mienzi), favor (enhui), relationship (Guanxi), and sentiment (Renqing). In crisis communication, Chinese organizations frequently adopted face-saving strategies since losing face means losing prestige, reputation or honor (Huang et al., 2016). Meanwhile, organizations and publics in China exchanged face and favor in the processes of social exchanges and resource distributions (Hwang, 1987). Giving face and favor to others could help establish and reinforce relationships between each other (Ting-Toomey, 2005). To build an effective dialogue, relationship and sentiment also served as key cultural factors. In China, creating a long-term and strong relationship is the precondition of opening conversations, developing cooperative goals, and reaching commited relationships (Wong et al., 2017). Defined as \u201cthe emotional responses of an individual confronting the various situations of daily life\u201d (Hwang, 1987, p. 953), public sentiment, rather than regulations and rules, may become the top priority that organizations should take care of in crises of China.",

As shown in Fig. 2\n, the central government first posted messages on its official website and linked to local governments\u2019 social media accounts. Then local governments applied these messages as main sources for crisis communication. Second, serving as inspectors, local opinion leaders were hired to transmit crisis information and they were authorized to scan user-generated contents as well. These online opinoin leaders reported publics\u2019 feedback following local governments\u2019 directions (Chen et al., 2018) and meanwhile responded to online publics\u2019 requests or inquiries.

Results also showed that Chinese online publics are highly dependent on social media and a growing number of users have used social media to express and share opinions during public emergency events (Xie et al., 2016).

In the \u201coccupy central\u201d social movement, large quantities of online publics also expressed their extreme voices through proactive dialogue with authorities (Luo & Zhai, 2017).

However, results found only half of current SMCC studies applied a theoretical framework. Meanwhile, theories such as the social-mediated crisis communication model, form/medium influence-based theories (e.g., media richness theory), and source influence-based theories (e.g., dialogic public relations theory) were not frequently applied. Moreover, a theoretical framework that explains the antecedents, process, and outcomes of dialogue on social media in crises of China is lacking. This study consequently posits a theoretical framework of the SMCC research in China, which confirms the importance of Chinese contextual elements and may help crisis managers to consider dialogue as an alternative communication approach for crisis responses. As shown in Fig. 3\n, this scholarly assessment tool first lists major contextual antecedents that can significantly influence social-mediated dialogue in crises of China, which include high-power distance, face and favor, relationship (Guanxi), sentiment (Renqing), the centralized political system, and media censorship system. Second, as what Romenti et al. (2014) suggested, dialogue fulfilled the strategic goals of organizations. Dialogue orientations and approaches determined types of dialogue strategies, serving for different purposes and functions in crisis communication. This new framework thus argues that purposes, strategies, and functions of social-mediated dialogue should be examined in the future. Last but not least, this assessment tool contains measurements of SMCC outcomes such as organization-online publics relationships, image construction, economic value (e.g., stock, revenue, cost reduction, market share), and social media publicity (e.g., cognitive or affective attributes).

For instance, Noguti, Lee, and Dwivedi (2016) found the unique feature of SCC is the capacity for large quantities of information transmitted rapidly on social media (Noguti et al., 2016). Moreover, SCC not only spread crises events, but also led to new crises (Luo & Zhai, 2017). SCC has magnified the consequences of crises and certain publics\u2019 posts in a celebrity-endorsement crisis even generated more \u201clikes\u201d than organizational crisis responses (Jiang, Huang, Wu, Choy, & Lin, 2015). Currently limited research focused on the effects of SCC and stakeholders\u2019 crisis communication strategies, while in crises of China the public-generated dialogues had a high degree of diffusivity and interaction. The highly active publics and their crisis responses strategies on social media deserve exploration. This study calls for more future studies on secondary crisis communication in China.",

Although Hong Kong and Macau for instance, have returned to the territory of China, local residents may still hold a different political stand and stay out of the strict control of mainland Chinese governments (Huang et al., 2016); people there can easily get access to Facebook and Twitter, which are entirely blocked in mainland China. The Hong Kong government currently is facing the crisis of mistrust from publics in the post-handover period (Luo & Zhai, 2017). In Taiwan, the relatively mature democratic policies may lead to a different adoption of dialogue strategies in crises. Thus, future research can thoroughly explore each specific region and compare the social media and crisis communication practice in Greater China.",

This review research filled the gap of global public relations literature by presenting lessons for practitioners who are interested in the social media and crisis communication practice in China. First, in China, emoticons and figurative language were popular on various domestic social media tools. Results suggested that it is important for organizations to adopt an informal personable communication style in dialogue with online publics in crises. Second, the appearance of social media such as Weibo and WeChat makes timing an essential factor in crisis communication. Thus, organizations need to change their dialogic approaches from being passive to being active and open true dialogue on China's social media sites for crisis communication. It is also essential to grasp publics\u2019 sentimental feelings at the outset of dialogue and regularly monitor items such as customer satisfaction and word-of-mouth on popular social media platforms (Kim et al., 2016). Finally, as results from this study demonstrated, organizations should particularly understand the cultural norms and societal forces of China, if their strategic goal is to establish and maintain a positive relationship with publics in such a challenging marketplace.",
