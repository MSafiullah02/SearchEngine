            "text": "Recent research has confirmed that porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) can be transmitted by swine feed and ingredients (Dee et al., 2014 (Dee et al., , 2015 Schumacher et al., 2015) . In a review by Nitikanchana (2014), a theoretical temperature \u00d7 ABSTRACT: Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) is a heat-sensitive virus that has devastated the U.S. swine industry. Because of its heat sensitivity, we hypothesized that a steam conditioner and pellet mill mimicking traditional commercial thermal processing may mitigate PEDV infectivity. Pelleting, a common feed processing method, includes the use of steam and shear forces, resulting in increased temperature of the processed feed. Two thermal processing experiments were designed to determine if different pellet mill conditioner retention times and temperatures would impact PEDV quantity and infectivity by analysis of quantitative reverse transcription PCR and bioassay. In Exp. 1, a 3 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 2 factorial design was used with 3 pelleting temperatures (68.3, 79.4, and 90.6\u00b0C), 3 conditioning times (45, 90, or 180 s), and 2 doses of viral inoculation (low, 1 \u00d7 10 2 tissue culture infectious dose 50 (the concentration used to see cytopathic effect in 50% of the cells)/g, or high, 1 \u00d7 10 4 tissue culture infectious dose 50 /g). Noninoculated and PEDV-inoculated unprocessed mash were used as controls. The low-dose PEDV-infected mash had 6.8 \u00b1 1.8 cycle threshold (Ct) greater (P < 0.05) PEDV than the high-dose mash. Regardless of time or temperature, pelleting reduced (P < 0.05) the quantity of detectable viral PEDV RNA compared with the PEDV-inoculated unprocessed mash. Fecal swabs from pigs inoculated with the PEDV-positive unprocessed mash, regardless of dose, were clinically PEDV positive from 2 to 7 d (end of the trial) after inoculation. However, if either PEDV dose of inoculated feed was pelleted at any of the 9 tested conditioning time \u00d7 temperature combinations, no PEDV RNA was detected in fecal swabs or cecum content. Based on Exp. 1 results, a second experiment was developed to determine the impact of lower processing temperatures on PEDV quantity and infectivity. In Exp. 2, PEDV-inoculated feed was pelleted at 1 of 5 conditioning temperatures (37.8, 46.1, 54.4, 62.8, and 71.1\u00b0C) for 30 s. The 5 increasing processing temperatures led to feed with respective mean Ct values of 32.5, 34.6, 37.0, 36.5, and 36.7, respectively. All samples had detectable PEDV RNA. However, infectivity was detected by bioassay only in pigs from the 37.8 and 46.1\u00b0C conditioning temperatures. Experiment 2 results suggest conditioning and pelleting temperatures above 54.4\u00b0C could be effective in reducing the quantity and infectivity of PEDV in swine feed. However, additional research is needed to prevent subsequent recontamination after pelleting as it is a point-in-time mitigation step.",

Typical swine feed pellet mill conditioner retention times and temperatures encompass the theoretical temperature \u00d7 time relationship proposed. Although corroborated this relationship using benchtop measures, there is no research confirming this time \u00d7 temperature relationship using a conditioner and pellet mill that are present in modern feed manufacturing facilities. Although it would be uncommon to set target pellet mill conditioning temperatures below 68\u00b0C, it is possible that feed may be produced below these limits during start up of the pellet mill or during a pellet mill plug. If feed begins to plug in the pellet mill die, the initial attempt to resolve the plug is to turn off steam to the conditioner. This can lead to significant quantities of pelleted feed not reaching the target conditioning temperature. If PEDV particles were in the feed, the resulting feed conditioned at a lower temperature may still have infectious PEDV particles that may potentially contaminate the pellet cooler, after-pellet feed handling equipment, trucks, feed lines, and feeders at the farm. Therefore, we hypothesize that PEDV dose and pelleting parameters will reduce PEDV quantity and infectivity.",

The PEDV dosages were selected based on the known minimum infectious dose of PEDV in swine feed determined by Schumacher et al. (2015) .

Next, a feed inoculum was created by mixing a 500-mL aliquot of the stock virus into a 4.5-kg batch of feed.

Prior to pelleting the first treatment, noninoculated feed was processed until the exit temperature of the feed was stable at the target temperature. To help reduce cross-contamination, the low-dose batches were pelleted prior to the high-dose batches. During thermal processing, within each dose, the treatment with the lowest temperature and longest retention time was pelleted first. The temperature was then held constant until the other 2 retention times were achieved, and samples were collected. This process was then repeated at the 2 higher temperatures. The temperature for each treatment was measured at the discharge from the conditioner to the pellet die feeder screw. Once the low-dose treatments were completed, the same procedure was used to pellet the high-dose treatments. For each temperature, time, and dose combinations, 3 pelleted samples were collected for qRT-PCR and bioassay analysis. In addition, between each inoculated batch, a minimum of 5 kg of virus-free feed was processed through the pellet mill. This was done to prevent virus carryover between treatments and to stabilize the conditioning temperature to ensure the contaminated feed was processed under uniform temperature conditions. Samples Preparation and Storage. Three 100-g samples of each batch of feed were added to 400 mL of cold PBS (Life Technologies, Grand Island, New York; pH 7.4) in 500-mL bottles (square Nalgene bottles; Thermo Scientific, Waltham, MA) and thoroughly mixed and stored at 4\u00b0C for approximately 12 h.

However, some of those temperatures are not applicable to the feed and ingredient industries. Fecal material has been tested at 71\u00b0C for 10 min, 63\u00b0C for 10 min, 54\u00b0C for 10 min, 38\u00b0C for 12 h, 20\u00b0C for 24 h, and 20\u00b0C for 7 d on metal surfaces (Thomas et al., 2015) . From these time \u00d7 temperature combinations, only the 71\u00b0C for 10 min and 20\u00b0C for 7 d led to bioassay-negative pigs (Thomas et al., 2015) . However, all of the other treatments led to infection in pigs (Thomas et al., 2015) . When comparing the temperatures used to those in the present study, the first issue that arises is that the 54\u00b0C treatments differed in the bioassay results. In this study, all pigs were bioassay negative when feed was treated at 54\u00b0C. This could be due to the nature of the pellet mill as steam is directly added to the feed and then the feed is forced through a pellet die. As the feed is forced through the die, it could also undergo frictional heat from being pushed through the small diameter holes. However, in both trials in which 71\u00b0C was reached, it led to a PEDVnegative bioassay regardless of the treatment time.",

            "text": "Another commercial process that is used for some ingredients in the feed industry, including plasma, is the use of spray drying. This process uses high temperatures throughout the manufacturing process, which makes it an option to test against PEDV. In a study by Gerber et al. (2014) , inlet temperatures of 166\u00b0C and outlet temperature of 80\u00b0C were used and these conditions led to the inactivation of infectious PEDV (Goyal, 2014) . In a separate study, bovine plasma was subjected to the spray drying process in which the inlet temperature was 200\u00b0C and either 70 or 80\u00b0C throughout the outlet (Pujols and Segal\u00e9s, 2014) . The bovine plasma subjected to spray drying was not infectious after the process (Pujols and Segal\u00e9s, 2014) . However, after the spray drying process, the plasma was reinoculated with PEDV and subjected to storage times of 7, 14, or 21 d and temperatures of 4, 12, or 22\u00b0C (Pujols and Segal\u00e9s, 2014) . The virus was not infectious at any of the time points at 22\u00b0C but was infectious in 1 out of 5 samples in 12\u00b0C at 7 d and 4 out of 5 samples in 4\u00b0C at 7 d (Pujols and Segal\u00e9s, 2014) . The initial high temperatures, which were greater than those used in this study, led to the inactivation of the virus; however, the low storage temperatures of 4 and 12\u00b0C did not inactivate the virus. This is extremely important to note because manufacturing equipment requires start up time and in some instances, as shown in the present study, the heat source is turned off to clear lodged material. This, in turn, could potentially lead to contamination of material later in processing and transportation. From this study, it was deemed that a temperature of 54.4\u00b0C or higher is required inactivate PEDV in complete feed when using a pellet mill and placing the feed into a swine bioassay. It is important to point out a few limitations of the 2 studies. The first is that the studies were performed on a pilot-size pellet mill. Every pellet mill will operate differently depending on the size, steam addition, time, and material flowing through the process. The second issue is the heating and cooling time of pellets. For this study, pellets were immediately placed on ice to cool them. If a pellet mill cooler would have been used, the cooling time would have been longer, in which case the pellets would have maintained their internal heat for a longer time period. The third limitation is the use of a bioassay. Currently, a bioassay is the best diagnostic method to measure infectivity. However, as explained by Davies (2015) , the risk of an individual pig becoming infected is very low but carries a high collective risk. In the bioassay, pigs received only 10 mL of a sample compared with their normal feed consumptions. If larger amounts of the pelleted feed were given to the pigs, then the likelihood of infection would have increased in the study. However, research generated using the same feed and pig bioassay model has led to infection within the animals (Schumacher et al., 2015; Cochrane et al., 2016) . Because of the issues associated with this study, further research needs to be performed on a larger scale looking at the use of different pellet mills and pellet cooling times.",
