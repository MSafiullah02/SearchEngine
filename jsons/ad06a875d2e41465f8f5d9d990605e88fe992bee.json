Although the Holland Code also known as RIASEC has frequently been used to group people by their suitability for six different categories of occupations, the RIASEC category labels of individual jobs are often not found in job posts. This is attributed to significant manual efforts required for assigning job posts with RIASEC labels. To cope with assigning massive number of jobs with RIASEC labels, we propose JPLink, a machine learning approach using the text content in job titles and job descriptions. JPLink exploits domain knowledge available in an occupation-specific knowledge base known as O*NET to improve feature representation of job posts. To incorporate relative ranking of RIASEC labels of each job, JPLink proposes a listwise loss function inspired by learning to rank. Both our quantitative and qualitative evaluations show that JPLink outperforms conventional baselines. We conduct an error analysis on JPLink's predictions to show that it can uncover label errors in existing job posts.",

These personality types are assigned RIASEC labels: Realistic (R), Investigative (I), Artistic (A), Social (S), Enterprising (E) and Conventional (C) (see Fig. 1a ). Ideally, one should match people with jobs based on personality types, assuming that all other job criteria (e.g., skills, abilities, knowledge, etc.) are already met.

To the best of our knowledge, there are three types of methods for occupational level personality type determination: (a) Incumbent Method, in which the personality type of an occupation is the average of the personality types of a representative sample of workers taking jobs of that occupation (based on the Holland's idea that people sharing the same occupation represent the occupation). This method requires the personality types of many individuals and is therefore very costly (i.e., less practical); (b) Empirical Method, which uses occupational analysis data (collected using Incumbent Method ) to develop classifiers to predict the personality type of occupations; and (c) Judgment Method, which involves trained experts making direct personality type assignment to occupations. An example for such an approach is O*NET interest profiler [12] . It constructs initial personality type of occupations based on discriminant functions derived from the ratings of Occupational Units [12] . Judgment method is then performed to fine-tune the constructed personality profiles using expert knowledge. Usually, human judges are trained to determine occupations' personality profiles after looking at attributes of occupations such as title, description, and job tasks. Hence, such an approach requires a considerable human effort. It is also difficult to extend this kind of approach for new emerging occupations and jobs. Almost all these previous efforts share the assumption of all job posts of the same occupation share the same personality type. This differentiates our research from them.",

Each occupation has a profile consisting of six numerical scores in the range [0, 100], one for each RIASEC dimension. The dimensions with scores more than 50 are known as the interest codes of the occupation.

The rightmost column in Table 1 shows the RIASEC distribution for the 1110 occupations found in O*NET. Table 1 depicts the Spearman's correlation between personality type dimensions. We observe that the correlations among dimension is consistent with Holland's Hexagonal Model (Fig. 1a) .

Here, we assign each occupation in the network with its highest-scored RIASEC dimension. The occupation network reports an Affinity of 2.82 ( 1), implying that occupations connected by a link in the network are 2.82 times more likely to share the similar dimension than that between any two random occupations.

While each job post has an SSOC code corresponding to some occupation, the code is not associated with RIASEC profiles. To derive the latter, we propose a distant supervised approach to map SSOC occupations to most similar O*NET occupations (for which personality types are assigned). Since there is no direct mapping between SSOC and SOC, we first use a mapping table 3 matching SSOC occupation codes with ESCO occupation codes which are the occupation codes standardized in the EU region. Subsequently, we determine the most similar SOC occupations for each ESCO occupation using another mapping table from Bureau of Labor Statistics of USA 4 . Finally, the RIASEC profile of an SSOC occupation is defined as the average of its similar SOC occupations' profiles. Following the assumption that jobs have RIASEC profiles similar to their occupations, we assign weak interest profile labels to the job posts. In this way, we are able to map 96.71% of SSOC occupations to 96.57% of ESCO occupations, and finally 75.23% of SOC occupations. This amounts to 171,946 job posts assigned with weak interest profile labels, which are used in Sect. 6 to train JPLink and to evaluate the prediction accuracy.",

Our first evaluation is qualitative: we randomly select a few target occupations and manually inspect the 5 most similar occupations and words to the target occupations (by cosine similarity) using the three occupation/word embedding representations. Due to the space limitations, we direct readers to [13] for the detailed results of the experiment. We first discuss the most similar occupations. For almost all the target occupations, PretrainedEmb returns similar occupations which have overlapping words with the target occupations. For example, the target occupation \"financial managers\" is similar to several other occupations of \"manager\" role. The target occupation \"technical writers\" is similar to occupations containing \"technical\" and/or \"writers\" in their titles. On the other hand, JPLink-Emb produces similar occupations that may not have overlapping words. For example, JPLink-Emb shows \"financial managers\" and \"loan officers\" are similar, \"health educators\", \"rehabilitation counselors\" and \"recreational therapists\" are similar, which are reasonable with respect to their domains. In contrast, Wikipedia2Vec produces some of the similar occupations that are less obvious, e.g., an occupation similar to \"technical writers\" is \"broadcast news analysts\". Also, when we compute the proportion of the 20 most similar occupations returned by each embedding scheme appearing as similar occupations of the target occupations in O*NET. We found that only 20% of similar occupations by PretrainedEmb appears in O*NET for the target occupations. In contrast, JPLink-Emb and Wikipedia2Vec show 55% and 40% of their 20 most similar occupations appearing in O*NET respectively. This shows the importance of incorporating O*NET knowledge base into the learning of occupation representations. We next analyse the most similar words to the target occupations. Pre-trainedEmb returns either target occupation title words or their synonyms. E.g., \"writers\" and \"technical\" are the most similar words for technical writers, while \"investors\" and \"bankers\" are for financial managers. JPLink-Emb and Wikipedia2Vec, on the other hand, returns domain-specific words associated with the occupational tasks. E.g., \"lifestyle\", \"smoking\", \"vaccines\" and \"nutritionally\" are words relevant to the tasks of the target occupation health educators. These words are useful to understand the requirement of health educator occupation. Because usually words overlapped with the title and its synonyms do not appear in job descriptions. Instead of that domain-specific information (tasks and skills) related to the jobs are appeared in the description.",

To illustrate this fact further, we further analyze the learned parameters of the JPLink-Pred model. As depicted in Table 3 , in JPLink-Pred, each row in the A projection matrix corresponds to the linear mapping learned for a RIASEC dimension. As shown in Table 3 , the correlations among the rows of A reflect the actual correlations between the corresponding RIASEC dimensions. These correlations are consistent with those seen in Table 1 . Moreover, we also found the bias values (b) of our model are consistent with the actual distribution of RIASEC dimensions in O*NET. Hence, we can say that JPLink is capable of capturing the inherent patterns of the interest dimensions. ",

To identify whether these imperfections adversely affect our evaluation, we manually inspect a few job posts that are wrongly predicted from our model. Table 4 lists a few cases where JPLink wrongly predicts labels. In these example cases, job titles and descriptions do not tally with the corresponding occupations (assigned by the current system). For instance, the job title lead full stack developer is assigned to the occupation category, \"Graphics and Multimedia Designers and Artists\", instead of an occupation related to software development (e.g., Software Developer). JPLink actually predicts a personality type profile appropriate to the occupations like Software Developer ({I, R, C, E, A, S}). Similarly, the predicted interest profiles for other example cases are reasonable with respect to their descriptions and titles. These results further signify the potential of this work to replace the current labor-intensive manual approach to profile job posts.",

Finally, we profiled a set of job posts using JPLink and showed that our model managed to identify a type of imperfection, existed in the current profiling system. There might be other imperfections in the current system (e.g., imperfections in mapping between different occupation taxonomies), which could be identified via a deep analysis of our predictions with the knowledge of domain experts. Also, our model can be used to understand individuals' behaviors using the job posts that they prefer to apply. For instance, if individuals tend to apply for jobs with similar interest profiles, our model might be used to infer individuals' interest profile, which is currently collected via surveys.
