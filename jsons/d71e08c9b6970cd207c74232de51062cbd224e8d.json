Also, aboriginal community dogs are free-roaming, which increases tick infestation. No ticks were seen on any of the pound dogs.

Samples were obtained from 32 cats that were euthanased at an animal shelter. Some cats infected with canine parvovirus variants may have clinical signs including severe gastroenteritis and leucopenia, as well as cerebral hyperplasia and ataxia in neonates, whereas others may have no clinical signs. The study showed the presence of parvovirus DNA in apparently healthy cats that were assumed to be unvaccinated. The authors suggest that further studies are needed to categorising infections in a large population of cats with known clinical histories, and that this should include bone marrow, faeces and blood for PCR and serology.",

This is a plant poisoning of horses that causes irreversible brain damage, and has not been previously reported in Australia. The report shows clear pictures of the plant as well as the gross appearance and histological appearance of the brain. Both horses were euthanased on humane grounds because of the hopeless prognosis associated with suspected poisoning. Pasture has to be dominated by young green plants before flowering, and up to 70% of body weight must be consumed for poisoning to occur. The diagnosis was based on the presence of clinical signs with a history of long-term access to large quantities of the plant. Differential definitive diagnosis is made by brain histopathology, and although MRI has been reported to be diagnostic, this is not really practical as a poisoning is irreversible and fatal.",
