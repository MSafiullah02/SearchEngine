As per American Society of Hematology, some patients with severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) have fulminant activation of coagulation and consumption of coagulation factors, which meets the criteria for disseminated intravascular coagulation as per International Society on Thrombosis and Haemostasis. A meta-analysis was conducted by Xiong et al.
