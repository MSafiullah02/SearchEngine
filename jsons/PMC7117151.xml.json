They are divided in four distinct genera tagged alpha-, beta-, gamma-, and delta-coronaviruses. These viruses are characterized by a considerable plasticity of their genome, which gives them a strong evolutionary potential, especially with respect to the crossing of species barriers (Woo et al., 2009). The history of coronaviruses is often marked by some successful emergences like the human SARS coronavirus in 2002 (Drosten et al., 2003). In 2012, the emergence of a new human betacoronavirus named Middle East Respiratory Syndrom Coronavirus (MERS-CoV) has set off an international warning (Zaki et al., 2012).",

ECoV was first isolated in North Carolina (USA) from the feces of a diarrheic foal in 1999 (ECoV-NC99) (Guy et al., 2000). The full-length genome of the ECoV-NC99 strain was then sequenced and published in 2007 (Zhang et al., 2007). Recently in Japan, ECoV was detected from the feces of adult horses with pyrogenic and enteric disease (ECoV-Tokachi09), and from fecal samples collected in three outbreaks that occurred at Obihiro Racecourse in Hokkaido (Oue et al., 2011, Oue et al., 2013). In October 2012, 4 outbreaks were associated with ECoV in adult horses in 4 different states in the USA (Pusterla et al., 2013). Of 59 sick horses, 44 were tested for ECoV by PCR and 38 of them (86%) were positive in feces samples. Surprisingly, the follow-up samples available for 7 sick horses showed that ECoV persisted only 3\u20139 days in feces, suggesting a potential difficulty in detecting ECoV in these specimens. In mammals, coronaviruses are mainly involved in enteric, respiratory, and neurological diseases. In horses, ECoV has been associated so far with enteric diseases and mainly sought out in feces specimens. However, the main clinical signs observed during these recently described outbreaks were anorexia, lethargy, leucopenia, and fever, i.e. unspecific and discrete symptoms that do not lend themselves to rapid diagnosis. Outside the USA and Japan, very little information about the circulation of ECoV in the equine population is currently available in literature.",

This is the first time that the detection of ECoV from a respiratory sample has been described; however, this aspect requires more examination since an etiological role of the agent was not conclusive. All other specimens were associated with enteric diseases in young foals. Four fecal samples were positive in the same county and were all related to an ECoV occurrence. The identification of the index case resulted in the collection of a number of samples in this area. During this occurrence, two ECoV positive fecal samples were collected at a five-week interval from the same adult horse who died subsequently with severe diarrhea.

However, this tool needs to be tested with an internal quality control for viral diagnosis in order to exclude false negatives due to possible inhibition. Sequencing and phylogenetic analyses have demonstrated that European strains are more closely related to the reference North American strain (NC99) than to the Asian strain (Tokachi09).",

Indeed, much is to be learned about the circulation of the betacoronavirus A1 group inside coronaviruses, which will, in turn, play an important role in our understanding of the emergence of CoVs. A novel betacoronavirus A1 was discovered very recently in fecal samples from dromedary camels in Dubai (United Arab Emirates) \u2013 the dromedary camel coronavirus (DcCoV) UAE-HKU23 \u2013 as part of the continuous surveillance conducted to identify the potential animal reservoir of MERS-CoV. The DcCoV has a 126-nt sequence in the RdRp identical to that of equine CoV, but differs from the MERS-CoV also detected in dromedaries (Woo et al., 2014). Knowledge of ECoVs and closed coronavirus strains will make an important contribution to the comprehension of circulating strains in the world. Epidemiological studies on ECoV infections will contribute to determining the impact and the prevalence of the virus in the equine population.",
