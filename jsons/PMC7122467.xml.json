            "text": "Over the past two decades, several immunological measures have been used to assess the physiological consequences of psychological stressors and different emotional states. In general, these immunological measures can be divided into two functional categories: circulatory measures and elicited measures. Both categories are informative, but will yield different types of information. In general, circulatory measures can provide information on the current physiological and immunological status of the individual and the potential of the immune system to react to dangerous stimuli. Elicited measures assess the actual immune response to a challenge. There is now an extensive literature demonstrating that these measures can be influenced by psychological stress and in individuals experiencing different emotional states. The purpose of this chapter is to provide an introduction to these immunological measures and how the assays are performed. Studies utilizing immunological measures will also be reviewed to illustrate the usefulness of these assays for studying mind\u2013body interactions. The chapter will be concluded by discussing how animal models can help provide details of how psychosocial factors can influence the immune system.",

            "text": "Circulating NK cell numbers, as well as NK cell activity, are significantly changed by psychological stressors. Natural killer cell numbers, as assessed via flow cytometry, were shown to be significantly decreased in blood samples taken from medical students during their final examinations, in comparison to levels found in the blood 6 weeks prior to their examinations (i.e., during a low stress period) (Glaser et al, 1986). In addition, the percentage of target cells (i.e., cells lacking MHCI expression) that the NK cells were able to lyse was significantly reduced during the examination period (Glaser et al, 1986; Kiecolt-Glaser et al, 1984a, 1986). This effect, however, was not consistently found in all the students. Students who were found to have higher scores on the stressful life events questionnaire (Glaser et al, 1986; Kiecolt-Glaser et al, 1986) or who were found to have higher levels of loneliness using the UCLA loneliness questionnaire also had the lowest levels of NK cell activity (Kiecolt-Glaser et al, 1984a). This relationship has been found in other subject populations; psychiatric patients with high scores on the UCLA loneliness questionnaire also had lower levels of NK cell activity as assessed by their ability to lyse target cells (Kiecolt-Glaser et al, 1984b). The decrease in NK cell activity was associated with a concomitant decrease in the ability of peripheral mononuclear cells to produce interferon-\u03b3 (IFN-\u03b3) (Kiecolt-Glaser et al, 1984b). This finding was important since IFN-\u03b3 is a major regulator of NK cell activity. Moreover, in more prolonged stressors, such as caring for a spouse with Alzheimer\u2019s disease, NK cell activity, as induced by IFN-\u03b3 or IL-2, was significantly reduced (Esterling et al, 1994, 1996). These studies, as well as others, demonstrate that NK cell number and activity can be affected by psychosocial variables.",

This was first evident in medical students during final examination week (Kiecolt-Glaser et al, 1986). As with the NK cells, the number of T lymphocytes was significantly decreased during final examinations as compared to numbers found 6 weeks prior to the exams. In this case, it was not a decrease in all subsets of T cells, but rather a specific decrease in helper and suppressor T lymphocytes (Kiecolt-Glaser et al, 1986). In addition, the stress of the examinations was sufficient to decrease the ratio of helper T lymphocytes to suppressor T lymphocytes (Kiecolt-Glaser et al, 1986). This finding was not unique to examinations and has also been described in men with low marital satisfaction (Kiecolt-Glaser et al, 1988).",

For example, psychiatric patients scoring high on the UCLA loneliness scale had poorer T lymphocyte proliferative responses to PHA or ConA when compared with patients scoring lower on the loneliness scale (Kiecolt-Glaser et al, 1984b). Lower T cell proliferative responses were also found in patients diagnosed with, and having had surgery for, breast cancer (Andersen et al, 1998, 2004), in medical students taking final examinations (Glaser et al, 1985), in caregivers of Alzheimer\u2019s patients (Kiecolt-Glaser et al, 1991), and in women during marital discord (Kiecolt-Glaser et al, 1993).

The mechanisms leading to reactivation during stressful situations were unknown, but it was known that for latent herpes virus infections, cellular immune competence was a critical factor in controlling the primary herpes virus infections and maintaining latency (Glaser and Gottleib-Stematsky 1982). Moreover, it was recognized that when cellular immunity was decreased, the humoral antibody response to the latent virus was significantly increased (Glaser and Gottleib-Stematsky 1982). Thus, the finding that many different types of stressors, such as academic stress in medical students and the stress of caring for a family member with Alzheimer\u2019s disease, resulted in significant elevations in antibody levels to EBV suggested that cellular immunity to the latent virus was significantly reduced. To test this hypothesis, the cellular immune response to EBV was measured in healthy medical students.",

For example, in primary caregivers of a spouse with Alzheimer\u2019s disease (Kiecolt-Glaser et al, 1995), the complete healing of a 3.5 mm punch biopsy wound was delayed by 9 days when compared with controls. While the complete set of factors responsible for this delay are not completely understood, studies using blister wounds have demonstrated that the early inflammatory phase of wound healing can be significantly changed during psychological stress. For example, women with higher levels of perceived stress had lower levels of IL-1\u03b1 and IL-8 in blister fluid (Glaser et al, 1999). Similar findings were obtained from couples with hostile marital interactions (Kiecolt-Glaser et al, 1995). Because these cytokines are important for recruiting additional leukocytes to the wound site and for helping to activate these leukocytes, the data indicate that delayed wound healing can occur in part through disruptions to the initial inflammatory phase of healing.",

Oral wounds created on the hard palate of dental students immediately before exam week healed 40% slower than wounds in the same individuals during vacation (Marucha et al, 1998). As with the cutaneous wounds, mucosal wounds from stressed individuals expressed significantly lower gene expression for the proinflammatory cytokine IL-1\u03b2, suggesting that the stressor disrupted the early inflammatory phase of mucosal wound healing (Marucha et al, 1998). As research progresses, it will be interesting to determine whether the stress response can influence other stages of wound healing or whether stressor effects are limited to the inflammatory stage.",

Approximately 21% of the students developed a protective antibody response to the vaccine after the initial exposure, with the remaining students producing a protective antibody response after the second exposure. Importantly, the 21% of the students that seroconverted 1 month after the primary exposure had lower Profile of Mood State (POMS) anxiety scores.

Moreover, the production of the Th1 cytokine IL-2 was significantly reduced when peripheral blood leukocytes from caregivers were stimulated with the influenza virus proteins (Kiecolt-Glaser et al, 1996). Similar results were evident when caregivers were given a pneumococcus bacterial vaccine. Caregivers produced significantly lower antibody levels to the pneumococcal vaccine (Glaser et al, 2000).

Exposing the wounded mice to a prolonged restraint stressor caused these cutaneous wounds to heal approximately 27% slower in comparison to wounds from the non-stressed control mice (Padgett et al, 1998). This delayed healing was associated with a significant decrease in leukocyte infiltration into wound sites, and lower cytokine levels in the wound site of the stressed animals (Padgett et al, 1998). This study confirmed the findings in humans indicating that the inflammatory stage of wound healing is dysregulated by psychological stress. These animal studies, however, extended this observation by demonstrating that blocking the stress-induced glucocorticoid response, using the glucocorticoid receptor antagonist RU4055, abolished the stress-induced delay in wound healing (Padgett et al, 1998). Glucocorticoids are known to decrease NF-\u03baB activation. Thus, it is likely that the stressor-induced glucocorticoid response suppressed NF-\u03baB activation, resulting in decreased inflammatory gene expression and delayed wound healing. Consistent with this premise, some stressors used in rodent studies, such as social disruption, do not affect wound healing in mice (Sheridan et al, 2004). Importantly, this stressor causes cytokine producing cells to become resistant to glucocorticoids (Bailey et al, 2004; Engler et al, 2005; Stark et al, 2001). Thus, glucocorticoids are unable to disrupt the inflammatory stage of wound healing in this paradigm. These data using animal models suggest that glucocorticoids play an important role in the stress-induced dysregulation of the inflammatory stage of wound healing.",

For example, prolonged restraint stress significantly reduces antibody production, proinflammatory cytokine responses, and NK cell activity during influenza viral infection (Sheridan et al, 1998; Tseng et al, 2005). In addition, the generation of CD8+ T lymphocytes was significantly reduced in restrained mice infected with HSV-1 (Bonneau et al, 1991). Because proinflammatory cytokines, NK cell cytoxicity, and CD8+ lymphocytes are essential for defense against viral infections, the restraint stressor also increased viral titers and virus-induced mortality (Bonneau et al, 1991; Sheridan et al, 1998).",

In influenza A-infected mice, it was evident that blocking glucocorticoid receptors was ineffective at restoring all of the stress-induced changes of the immune system (Hermann et al, 1994). In fact, blocking glucocorticoid receptors only reversed the stressor-induced decrease in leukocyte trafficking into draining lymph nodes and the lungs to combat the infection. Blocking glucocorticoid receptors did not, however, restore stressor-induced reductions in cell functioning. The stressor-induced reduction in CD8+ T lymphocyte activation was found to be due to activation of \u03b2-adrenergic receptors; blocking these receptors restored the activation of CD8+ T lymphocytes (Hermann et al, 1994). In contrast, NK cell cytotoxicity was not restored upon blockade of \u03b2-adrenergic receptors, but was restored when \u03bc-opioid receptors were blocked (Tseng et al, 2005). These studies in rodents, as well as many other laboratory animal studies, demonstrate the many, and complex, ways through which psychological stressors affect the immune response.",

In a general sense, the impact of psychosocial factors on immune-mediated diseases or conditions is clear; the stress response will suppress our ability to fight a cold, generate an immune response to a vaccine, or heal a wound. But, the detailed mechanisms through which this occurs have not yet been fully delineated. Questions remain, such as why some stressors tend to suppress the immune response, whereas other stressors seem to leave the immune response intact. Other questions involve the mechanisms through which these psychosocial factors influence the immune response. Are these effects all mediated by traditional stress hormones or are other novel factors at play? Current evidence makes it clear that other immunomodulatory factors, like growth factors and cytokines themselves, can be induced during a stress response, but the extent of their impacts on the immune system are not clear. Well-designed clinical studies, and appropriate studies in animal models, as well as the methods outlined in this chapter, can provide a foundation on which to begin answering these existing questions.",
