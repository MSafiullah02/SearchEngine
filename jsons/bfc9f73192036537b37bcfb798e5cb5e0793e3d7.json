Through two large-scale nationwide surveys (N 1 = 11,131; N 2 = 3,000) conducted in China immediately before versus during the coronavirus outbreak, we found that the onset of the coronavirus epidemic led to a 74% drop in overall emotional well-being. Factors associated with the likelihood of contracting the disease (e.g., residing near the epicenter), extent of potential harm (e.g., being an elderly), and relational concerns (e.g., those within a marriage) exacerbated the detrimental effect of the outbreak on emotional well-being. Further, individuals' perception of their knowledge about coronavirus infection was another factor. Regardless of the actual amount of knowledge they possessed, those perceiving themselves as more knowledgeable, were able to experience more happiness during the outbreak. Higher perceived knowledge was associated with a stronger sense of control, which mediated the differences in emotional well-being. These patterns persisted even after controlling for a host of demographic and economic variables. In conclusion, public policies and mental health interventions aimed at boosting/protecting psychological well-being during 10 epidemic outbreaks should take account of these factors.",

The analyses not only established a consistent, significant negative effect of the outbreak on emotional well-being, but also revealed a set of significant interactions: (i) Individuals residing in Hubei, the epicenter of the outbreak, experienced a larger decline in emotional well-being. Because the overwhelming majority of Chinese coronavirus patients resided in that region (Dong, Du, and Gardner, 2020) We also examined the main effects of the demographic and economic variables on emotional well-being. Marriage and income were the only two variables that had a consistent and significant effect on emotional well-being. Specifically, married people enjoyed a higher emotional well-being than unmarried ones and higher income led to a higher emotional well-being. These results are consistent with psychological well-being patterns in other countries examined in prior research (Wood, Rhodes, and Whelan, 1989; Lucas and Schimmack, 2009 ). Next, we analyzed the data collected during the outbreak. We ran a series of regressions with emotional well-being as the dependent variable, perceived knowledge, actual knowledge, whether the individual resided in Hubei, age, sex, marital status, income, and the interaction terms between the demographic variables and perceived knowledge as predictors (see Table 2 ). Across all regression models, participants' perceived knowledge about coronavirus infection was a consistent, significant predictor of their emotional well-being. However, their actual knowledge was not a consistent predictor. In other words, people's perceived level of knowledge about coronavirus infection served as a stronger protector of their emotional well-being during the outbreak than the actual amount of knowledge they possessed. To assess the underlying mechanism, we tested whether sense of control mediated the effect of perceived knowledge on emotional well-being. We ran a mediation analysis using a bootstrapping technique with 10,000 resamples (Model 4, Hayes, 2013 Wood, W., Rhodes, N., Whelan, M., (1989) . Sex differences in positive well-being: A consideration of emotional style and marital status. Psychological Bulletin, 106, 249-264. Zhang, S. X., Wang, Y., Rauch, A., Wei, F., (2020) .
