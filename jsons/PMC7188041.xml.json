In the early days of March 2020, there was considerable debate across the country, including over social media, about the scope of scaling back and reprioritization of services, including whether nonurgent EP procedures should be postponed. Although the answer to these questions seems obvious in retrospect, the timing of when to begin canceling cases has often been staggered and made at the local level.",

To meet these demands, one goal of the network has been to increase intensive care unit (ICU) bed capacity from a baseline of approximately 400 ICU beds to over 1000 ICU beds, a herculean task requiring a complete transformation of all hospital resources, including staff duties and physical plant. We describe the pivoting of operations within the context of 3 broad categories of reorganization, including (1) procedure-related and inpatient care, (2) outpatient care, and (3) administrative restructuring.",

It is obviously better to prepare in advance for such ramp down, with contingency protocols in place before the COVID-19 pandemic reaches a hospital system. We understand that not all EP practices are the same, and groups will face different challenges, including managing the financial burden and sequelae of decreased volume, as well as the possible \u201csecond surge\u201d of both inpatients and outpatients who have remained at home with EP disorders until peak COVID-19 surging has dissipated. Nevertheless, we hope our experience is useful for EP sections in other parts of the country and world who, unfortunately, anticipate an influx of COVID-19 cases. As we learn from each other how to face an unprecedented modern pandemic, continued communication, collaboration, and preparedness are critical to helping our patients and each other.",
