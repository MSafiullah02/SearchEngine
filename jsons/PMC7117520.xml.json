The causative agent, PRRSV, is an enveloped, single-stranded RNA virus in the family Arteriviridae, which includes equine arteritis virus (EAV), lactate dehydrogenase-elevating virus (LDV) of mice and simian hemorrhagic fever virus (SHFV) (Meulenberg et al., 1994). Arteriviruses have a genome organization and replication process similar to that of coronaviruses, and feature a positive-sense RNA genome of about 15 kb, with the coding sequence for non-structural proteins preceding that of structural proteins.",

ORFs 1a and 1b comprise 80% of the viral genome sequence and encode the viral RNA replicase (Meulenberg et al., 1993). In PRRSV-infected cells, a set of six or seven nested viral subgenomic RNAs is formed (Conzelmann et al., 1993, Meng et al., 1994, Meng et al., 1996b, Meulenberg et al., 1993). All of the subgenomic RNAs have an identical 5\u2032-leader sequence derived from the 5\u2032-end of genomic RNA, as well as an identical 3\u2032-terminal sequence preceding poly-(A) tails of variable length. The co-terminally identical mRNA species are generated through a process known as discontinuous subgenomic mRNA synthesis (Sawicki and Sawicki, 1995, van Marle et al., 1999). From the analysis of PRRSV genomic sequences, two genotypes of PRRSV are recognized, North American and European, which are 55\u201370% identical at the nucleotide level (Meng et al., 1994). Each genotype in turn contains a number of viral strains. The 5\u2032-end of each subgenomic mRNA of North American strains contains a common leader sequence of 190 bases (Nelsen et al., 1999), whereas in the prototype strain of the European PRRSV genotype, Lelystad virus, the leader is 221 bases (Meulenberg et al., 1993). The North American and European genotypes have 3\u2032-terminal untranslated region sequences of about 150 and 120 bases, respectively, excluding the poly-(A) tail, which is common to all of their subgenomic mRNAs. PRRSV subgenomic RNAs are polycistronic in structure, but it is believed that only the first open reading frame (ORF) of each is translated into a viral protein (Meng et al., 1996b). PRRSV can be propagated in MA-104, African green monkey kidney cells, and cells derived thereof, such as CL2621, MARC 145, and CRL11171 (Benfield et al., 1992, Horsfield et al., 2002, Kim et al., 1993, Meng et al., 1994).",

Attenuated live virus vaccine has been commercially available for years, however, outbreaks of PRRS resulting from viral strains nearly identical in sequence to the vaccine strain have been reported (Opriessnig et al., 2002). Outbreaks of atypical or acute PRRS in vaccinated pigs have raised serious concern about the efficacy of the current vaccines (Meng, 2000), and made clear the need to develop alternative strategies. Specific and efficacious antiviral compounds would be considered a welcome complement to vaccines in PRRS control. In this study, peptide-conjugated phosphorodiamidate morpholino oligomers (P-PMOs) are evaluated for their ability to block PRRSV propagation in cell culture.",

PMOs have a different backbone than DNA, however, with a morpholine ring replacing the deoxyribose sugar and a phosphorodiamidate linkage replacing the phosphodiester linkage (Fig. 1\n) (Schmajuk et al., 1999, Summerton, 1999, Summerton and Weller, 1997). PMOs are uncharged, water-soluble, and highly resistant to nuclease degradation (Hudziak et al., 1996, Nelson et al., 2005). PMOs bind to target mRNA by Watson\u2013Crick base pairing and can exert an antisense effect by preventing access to critical segments of RNA sequence, such as a translation initiation site, through steric blockade. This is a distinctly different process from the RNase H-dependent mechanism induced by the often-used antisense structural type phosphorothioate DNA (Summerton, 1999).",

The sequence-specific antiviral efficacy of PMO compounds in vitro has been documented with caliciviruses (Stein et al., 2001), Hepatitis C virus RNA (McCaffrey et al., 2003), mouse hepatitis virus (Neuman et al., 2004), SARS coronavirus (Neuman et al., 2005), EAV (van den Born et al., 2005) and several flaviviruses (Deas et al., 2005, Kinney et al., 2005).

The degree of cytopathic effect (CPE), characterized by cell rounding, clumping and detachment, was assessed microscopically 48 h after PRRSV inoculation, in comparison with mock-infected cells.

Incremental concentrations of P-PMO were added to in vitro translation reactions to determine the degree of the translation inhibition. Extinction concentration 50 [EC50], which refers to the amount of PMO compound required to reduce luciferase signal by 50% compared to untreated controls, was obtained. The EC50s of 5UP1 P-PMO for RNA targets with two-, three-, or four-mismatches were 12-, 58-, and 167-fold higher, respectively, compared to the wild-type (e.g. zero mismatch) target (EC50 of 87, 404, 1170 and 7 nM, respectively) (Fig. 4\n).

We suspected that this P-PMO exerted its antiviral effect by interfering with the translation of the product of the first two open reading frames, the PRRSV replicase complex. We expected that as a result of lowered levels of replicase proteins, PRRSV RNA synthesis would ultimately be reduced. To investigate this hypothesis, we commenced P-PMO treatment at multiple time points pi, and harvested the cells at 24 h pi for RNA isolation.

Of a total of six antisense P-PMOs tested, only one, 5UP1, was found to be highly effective at inhibiting PRRSV replication in CRL11171 cell culture. Virus titration and IFA results demonstrated that the 5UP1 P-PMO was effective in a dose-responsive and sequence-specific manner. The reasons for the ineffectiveness of the other five P-PMOs are unclear, but could include the inability of certain P-PMO to access complementary PRRSV target sequence, or, that successful P-PMO/target-RNA duplexing did not ultimately affect PRRSV replication. The former speculation is supported by secondary structural analysis with RNA folding programs, as extensive stem-loop structures in the PRRSV 5\u2032-UTR are predicted (van den Born et al., 2004). The latter speculation is suggested if successful PMO duplexing to particular PRRSV target-RNA sites simply could not cause significant interference with critical events in the viral life cycle, such as translation or RNA synthesis. Antisense P-PMOs against EAV (a closely related arterivirus) (van den Born et al., 2005) and SARS (a fellow Nidovirus) (Neuman et al., 2005), which were designed to target their respective TRS-regions, showed substantial antiviral activity. In our study, the two P-PMOs targeting the PRRSV TRS-region were ineffective, indicating that these particular compounds were unable to significantly interfere with the processes of PRRSV RNA synthesis or translation. van den Born et al. also found that several other antisense P-PMOs, each targeting a different location in the 5\u2032-UTR of EAV, had high antiviral activity in cell culture (van den Born et al., 2005). In our study, only the 5\u2032-terminus targeted 5UP1 P-PMO showed antiviral activity, and further work was conducted to characterize this particular P-PMO.",

We speculate that the peptide portion of the P-PMO compound could assist virus entry into pretreated cells, as was likewise suggested by van den Born et al. in their P-PMO experiments with EAV (van den Born et al., 2005). More virus particles from the inoculum may adhere to the surface of cells pretreated with P-PMO than to the surface of non-pretreated cells. Therefore, cells pretreated with this P-PMO may engender more virus entry and replication than cells post-treated. van den Born et al. also noticed that high concentrations of certain P-PMO appeared sometimes to be associated with increased virus titers (van den Born et al., 2005).",

Furthermore, substantially less inhibition by 5UP1 was observed if P-PMO-treatment was begun after 24 h pi than was the case at earlier commencement times. This observation is consistent with the expected mechanism of action of 5UP1, i.e., blocking the translation of RNA into protein. IFA detection of PRRSV N-protein indicated that addition of 5UP1 at up to 24 h pi resulted in some reduction of PRRSV-positive cells at 48 h pi. The reduced N-protein synthesis in IFA observations may be due to 5UP1 interfering with either the synthesis or translation of N subgenomic RNA. The latter speculation seems more likely. N subgenomic RNA possesses the 5\u2032-leader sequence common to all PRRSV subgenomic RNAs, which includes the 5UP1 target site and has been implicated in the events of the pre-initiation of translation in arteriviruses (van den Born et al., 2004).",
