            "text": "Compared to accidental head injury, brain injuries in abusive head trauma (AHT) are more severe, more often diffuse, and commonly involve hypoxic\u2013ischemic injury [1, 2]. Retinal hemorrhages and noncontact injury patterns resulting in multifocal subdural hemorrhages located over the cerebral convexities or within the interhemispheric fissure are also highly associated with AHT [2, 3]. Occult spine injuries are increasingly common in AHT, likely related to increased awareness and screening for injury using improved imaging and autopsy techniques [4]. Although few spine injuries require surgical intervention [5], identification of occult injuries can strengthen maltreatment investigations by highlighting the severity of injury and risk of harm, and by clarifying the mechanism of abusive injuries. Given the potential for detection of clinically significant injury and improved child safety, the American College of Radiology (ACR) recommends MRI of the cervical spine in the evaluation for AHT, and that whole-spine MRI be considered [6].",

Our institutional review board granted a waiver of informed consent, and the study complied with the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996. In this retrospective case series review we identified all children younger than 5 years who received an MRI of the brain for an abuse evaluation between January 2010 and December 2013. During this timeframe, the hospital\u2019s child protection team (CPT) used standard guidelines for abuse evaluation, including head CT in any child for whom there were concerns for AHT, and in infants younger than 6 months for whom there were concerns of physical abuse. If concerns for AHT remained based on the head CT or clinical findings, the CPT recommended a non-contrast MRI of the brain and spine. If a brain MRI was the first-line study rather than the head CT, we included the case for analysis if the MRI was part of an AHT evaluation. The spine MRI non-accidental trauma protocol included T1 sagittal, T2 sagittal and axial, 3-D T1 sagittal with axial and coronal reformations, axial gradient echo/susceptibility-weighted imaging, and sagittal short tau inversion recovery (STIR) sequences. The upper thoracic spine was included in cervical spine MR imaging through the 5th thoracic vertebral body. All children who received a brain MRI for an abuse evaluation were included in the study, regardless of whether an MRI spine was obtained or revealed any evidence of intracranial injury. We excluded children with a medical condition that might impact the appearance of spine injuries (skeletal dysplasia, connective tissue disorder, prior spinal surgery, a history of spine injury, or bleeding disorders).",

This method classified injuries as:Contact: injuries from cranial impact without significant cranial acceleration or deceleration (skull fractures, craniofacial soft-tissue injuries, epidural hemorrhages);Noncontact: injuries from cranial acceleration or deceleration without evidence of cranial impact (concussion, abnormal subdural collection extending from the interhemispheric region, diffuse axonal injury);Combined: both contact and noncontact injuries; orUndetermined: injuries from contact or noncontact mechanisms (subarachnoid hemorrhages, brain contusions or lacerations, a subdural hemorrhage not extending from the interhemispheric region).",

As standard practice, the CPT consultant assigns a physical abuse likelihood score to all cases using a previously described 1\u20137 scale (Table 1) [9]. A diagnosis of AHT is made by consensus after peer review by the CPT when a child presents with diffuse primary brain injury and extraaxial hemorrhage that cannot be reasonably explained by an accidental mechanism or a medical condition. The diagnosis is made after careful consideration of all historical and clinical data in collaboration with a multidisciplinary investigation. Although information about confessions and criminal convictions was collected, this information is unreliable for an accurate medical diagnosis and was not required to classify children as abused. Children <5 years of age were included to align with the narrow definition of AHT developed by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [10]. For this study, the cases were grouped into accidental (1\u20132), indeterminate (3\u20135), and abuse (6\u20137). Cases classified as abuse were further divided into \u201cAHT\u201d or \u201cabuse, not AHT.\u201d Children with abusive extracranial injuries with no intracranial injuries, or intracranial injuries that were indeterminate for abuse were classified as \u201cabuse, not AHT.\u201d To assess the effects of selection bias, we compared variables between children evaluated for AHT who did and did not receive a spine MRI.",

Ligamentous injury was defined as ligamentous disruption or the presence of hyperintensity on STIR sequences surrounding the ligaments or membranes (Figs. 1 and 2). Spinal hemorrhages were classified as subdural if there was epidural fatty tissue without dural displacement and epidural if the hemorrhage caused dural displacement toward the spinal cord (Fig. 3). We compared clinical characteristics with the presence of spine injury seen on MRI. To explore the mechanism of spinal subdural hemorrhage (SDH), we performed a post hoc analysis to compare the association between spinal SDH and the presence of other spine injuries and the presence of intracranial hemorrhage. We used the chi-square or Fisher exact test to compare categorical variables. We used the Kruskal-Wallis or Mann-Whitney test to compare continuous variables.

The reported incidence of spinal injury in AHT varies considerably (13% to 78%) [11, 12] because of variations in the extent of imaging performed and study designs. In publications with methods like ours, which assessed for a wide range of spinal injuries regardless of whether AHT was ultimately diagnosed, the incidence of spinal injury ranges from 30% to 69% [5, 13, 14]. Among these studies, Jacob et al. [14] described a similar rate of spinal subdural hemorrhage (18%) and spinal epidural hemorrhage (10%) compared to our population, but higher rates of ligament and bony injury (67% and 9%, respectively). In contrast, Kadom et al. [13] and Oh et al. [5] found no bony injury and spinal subdural hemorrhage in only 1% of cases. The addition of sagittal STIR sequences improves the detection of soft-tissue injury and is useful to confirm the presence of spinal hemorrhage [12, 14], and this might have contributed to the higher percentage of injury detected in our subjects. Whole-spine imaging can also result in increased injury detection compared to cervical spine imaging alone [12]. If we had excluded thoracic and lumbar spine MRI, we would have missed three children with spinal extramedullary hemorrhages and two with thoracic vertebral body fractures. Additionally, 3-D T1-W sequences used in our MRI protocol might have facilitated detection of spine fractures (Fig. 9).",

MRI findings might overestimate the extent of disruptive ligamentous injury, limiting the utility of spine MRI when the goal is to detect potentially unstable injuries requiring surgical intervention [16, 17]. However, in child abuse evaluations the goal is to detect both apparent and occult injuries to outline the severity of injury to the child and support opinions regarding injury mechanism. Soft-tissue pathology on spine MRI does correlate with clinical impairment in adults with whiplash injuries as compared to controls [18]. In children, Choudhary et al. [12] compared spine MRI findings among AHT, accidental trauma and non-traumatic cohorts. After excluding medical causes, the only spinal finding in the non-traumatic cohort was a nuchal ligament injury in a child with sepsis who sustained a 20-min tonic-clonic seizure. The authors concluded that bony or ligamentous spinal abnormalities in the accidental and abusive cohorts were from injury and not normal variants [12].",

Symptoms are difficult to assess in very young children and the symptoms can be masked by severe brain injury. Evidence of unexplained trauma might prompt additional investigation for maltreatment and in this way affects medical decision-making.

Choudhary et al. [12] found a higher rate of both cervical ligamentous injury (78% vs. 46%) and spinal SDH (48% vs. 2%) in children with AHT compared to accidental injury. When Henry et al. [19] compared spinal injury in children with AHT and with accidental injury associated with non-motor vehicle crash, the authors found a higher incidence of spine injury overall in children with AHT (31.3% vs. 7.1%), but the rate of ligamentous injury was similar (8.7% for AHT and 5.8% for accidental head injury) [19]. In contrast, other studies did not find a higher incidence of spinal injury in abused infants [11, 13]. The lower number of children with spinal extramedullary hemorrhage in these studies might contribute to the lack of significant findings between their abusive and accidental cohorts. Additionally, Baerg et al. [11] included children with severe accidental rotational acceleration/deceleration head injuries who can have spinal injury similar to that found in AHT. Although spinal injury and AHT were not associated in Baerg et al.\u2019s study, spinal injuries were associated with other clinical findings of severe rotational acceleration/deceleration head injury typical of both AHT and severe accidental head injury involving similar mechanisms [11].",

Although the association between injury severity and spinal injury should be interpreted with caution because of the low number of less severely injured children who received a spine MRI, it is consistent with previous literature [11, 19]. Like AHT, spinal injury is associated with global parenchymal injury [16], hypoxic\u2013ischemic injury [12\u201315] and a rotational acceleration/deceleration mechanism of head injury in both accidental and abusive trauma [15]. Using autopsy techniques that preserve the entire spine for microscopic analysis, Matshes et al. [22] found that 100% of subjects with injuries involving hyperflexion/extension forces to the head had injury to the spinal nerve roots. In living children, spinal nerve root injuries are infrequently reported but might be below the current level of detection on MRI [12, 23]. Although we did not analyze the association between hypoxic\u2013ischemic injury and spinal injury, other research suggests that hypoxic\u2013ischemic injury is more common in children with ligamentous spinal injury [12, 13, 15], and spinal SDH is rarely identified in accidentally head-injured children [12, 21]. Our study supports and adds to this literature by highlighting an association between spinal SDH and a combination of higher injury severity, noncontact head injury pattern, retinal hemorrhages, and an AHT diagnosis.",

Spinal SDH is most commonly attributed either to direct injury to spinal vasculature or tracking of intracranial blood [4]. Sequential migration of intracranial blood into the spinal subdural space has been reported in adults [24]. Case studies of children with AHT report spontaneous resolution of subdural hemorrhages at the clivus, which seemed to have migrated into the spinal subdural space [25, 26]. Spinal subdural hemorrhage is also reported as a complication of ventriculoperitoneal shunting, where low intracranial pressure from the shunt is suspected to cause dissection between the dura and arachnoid layer of the spine, allowing migration of the intracranial subdural hemorrhage [24]. However, in the only prospective study assessing the incidence of spinal SDH in people with intracranial subdural hemorrhage, only 2 (1.2%) of 168 adults with intracranial hemorrhage had spinal hemorrhage; both of those people had experienced concurrent injury to the head and the back [27]. Direct vascular injury to radicular veins traveling through the spinal nerve root is also a known cause of spinal SDH in victims of AHT, likely caused by traction on spinal nerve roots during hyperflexion/extension from shaking [28].",

Although all but one child with spinal SDH also had intracranial hemorrhage in our study, intracranial subdural hemorrhage was not predictive of spinal SDH. Spinal SDH was associated with other spine injuries. The lack of association between intracranial and spinal SDH suggests that caudal migration of an intracranial hemorrhage is not the sole mechanism for spinal SDH. Our findings suggest that either the spinal SDH is caused by direct spinal injury at least in some cases, or that a similar injury mechanism caused the other spinal injuries and the caudal extension of the intracranial hemorrhage into the spine. Choudhary et al. [12] also found a higher incidence of spinal SDH in children with AHT compared to their accidentally injured cohort and a correlation between ligamentous spinal injury and spinal SDH. The authors proposed that traction on myodural bridges and the intradural nerve roots and dentate ligaments during flexion/extension of the spinal cord in AHT could cause disruption of the dura-arachnoid interface, facilitating the migration of blood from the intracranial compartment into the spine [12]. The association among spinal SDH, other injuries typical of rotational acceleration/deceleration of the head, and a diagnosis of AHT in our subjects supports this theory. However, it is important to consider that spine MRI extended past T5 in a minority of our subjects, so the incidence of spinal SDH might be underrepresented. Additional studies using whole-spine MRI are needed.",

To further assess for circular reasoning, AHT likelihood was compared to a second classification method developed by Duhaime et al.

Because this classification system was meant for people with head injuries, people without concern for head injury were excluded.
