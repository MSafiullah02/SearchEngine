The clinical course of neonatal diarrhea is characterized by severe dehydration and imbalances in the acid-base and electrolyte status. Objectives in the treatment of diarrhea are rehydration and correction of the metabolic acidosis. 1, 2 In diarrheic calves with a failing suckling reflex, the continuous IV infusion of isotonic solution is recommended as the treatment of choice. 1 However, this therapeutic approach is laborious and expensive. As an alternative, the rapid IV injection of hypertonic saline solution (HSS) followed by application of oral rehydration solution (ORS) has been suggested. 2 In veterinary medicine, HSS has been established in the treatment of endotoxic shock in cattle 3 and dogs 4 as well as in the treatment of hemorrhagic shock in sheep, 5 swine, 6 horses, 7 dogs, 8 and cats. 9 HSS was also found to be successful for the rehydration of hypovolemic calves, 10, 11 which were dehydrated experimentally by the administration of sucrose and diuretics. Although severely dehydrated, these calves exhibited only a mild acidemia and metabolic acidosis. However, a pronounced metabolic acidosis is typical, in particular for older calves (48 days) suffering from neonatal diarrhea. 12 The general condition, the suckling reflex, and the ability to stand are influenced by the extent of the acidosis. 13, 14 In particular, increases in serum D-lactate concentrations commonly found in diarrheic calves 15 because of extensive microbial fermentation of carbohydrates in the rumen and large intestine 16 were found to have a stronger influence on behavior and posture than metabolic acidosis per se. 15 Because parenteral saline induces a mild acidifying effect, 2, 9, 17, 18 the correction of the acidemia in diarrheic calves depends significantly on the consecutive consumption of buffers in ORS. The initial application of hypertonic bicarbonate solution (HBS) may be more advantageous in the treatment of calves with metabolic acidosis. 19 However, HBS has been suggested to induce a paradoxical intracellular and cerebrospinal acidosis (PIA); the relevance of paradoxical intracellular acidosis in calves after administration of HBS is discussed controversially. 17, 19 It was the objective of the 2 clinical studies presented here to investigate in inappetent calves suffering from neonatal diarrhea the clinical efficacy of IV administered HSS and HBS, respectively.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 354, "end": 356, "text": "1,", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}, {"start": 357, "end": 358, "text": "2", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}, {"start": 502, "end": 503, "text": "1", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}, {"start": 724, "end": 725, "text": "2", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}, {"start": 821, "end": 822, "text": "3", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 893, "end": 894, "text": "5", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 902, "end": 903, "text": "6", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}, {"start": 912, "end": 913, "text": "7", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}, {"start": 920, "end": 921, "text": "8", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 932, "end": 933, "text": "9", "ref_id": "BIBREF9"}, {"start": 1013, "end": 1016, "text": "10,", "ref_id": "BIBREF10"}, {"start": 1017, "end": 1019, "text": "11", "ref_id": "BIBREF11"}, {"start": 1331, "end": 1333, "text": "12", "ref_id": "BIBREF12"}, {"start": 1449, "end": 1452, "text": "13,", "ref_id": "BIBREF13"}, {"start": 1453, "end": 1455, "text": "14", "ref_id": "BIBREF14"}, {"start": 1550, "end": 1552, "text": "15", "ref_id": "BIBREF15"}, {"start": 1647, "end": 1649, "text": "16", "ref_id": "BIBREF16"}, {"start": 1746, "end": 1748, "text": "15", "ref_id": "BIBREF15"}, {"start": 1809, "end": 1811, "text": "2,", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}, {"start": 1812, "end": 1814, "text": "9,", "ref_id": "BIBREF9"}, {"start": 1815, "end": 1818, "text": "17,", "ref_id": "BIBREF17"}, {"start": 1819, "end": 1821, "text": "18", "ref_id": "BIBREF18"}, {"start": 2087, "end": 2089, "text": "19", "ref_id": "BIBREF19"}, {"start": 2314, "end": 2317, "text": "17,", "ref_id": "BIBREF17"}, {"start": 2318, "end": 2320, "text": "19", "ref_id": "BIBREF19"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": ""}, {"text": "Two consecutive studies were performed using an identical experimental protocol.

Hypertonic rehydration represents an alternative for rehydration in those patients in whom an infusion treatment cannot be carried out for any reason. The primary therapeutic approach is based on a transient replenishment of the intravascular volume from the intracellular and transcellular compartments caused by an increase of plasma osmolarity. 17 Thereby, the cardiovascular system is stabilized for 30-90 minutes. 8, 17, 19 A sustained improvement of the clinical status, however, requires a significant oral intake of fluid containing water, electrolytes, buffer, and energy. In the present study, these principles worked successfully in 63% (10/16) of the calves of study I (NaCl) and 93% (11/12) of the calves of study II (NaHCO 3 ). Rehydration, accompanied by a marked improvement of the general condition, and a restoration of the suckling reflex were achieved within 12-24 hours; this period is comparable to successful treatments based on continuous infusion of isotonic solutions. 1 The differences in the proportion of treatment failures between study I (NaCl) and study II (NaHCO 3 ) can be explained predominantly by an advantage of bicarbonate solution in the treatment of diarrheic calves with a severe metabolic acidosis. No differences existed in the status of the calves before hypertonic rehydration between successfully treated calves and treatment failures, except for a more severe acidemia in the latter. Calves that failed to respond were on average older than the successfully treated calves, which indirectly confirms the findings that diarrheic calves older than 1 week of age exhibit a more severe acidemia than younger calves 12, 13 (Table 1) . As an explanation, infections with rotavirus, coronavirus, or C. parvum induce an osmotic diarrhea, accompanied by microbial fermentation of substrates in the large intestine, leading to excessive production of predominantly D-lactate. 25 Calves treated with HBS (study II) received a double load of sodium compared with calves in study I (NaCl). Sodium is regarded as the major determinant of rehydration success; however, no obvious differences were found with respect to the velocity of rehydration between calves of studies I and II (Table 3) . Thus, the concentration of sodium in the hypertonic solution had only a short, transient effect, whereas the final success of the rehydration treatment was determined predominantly by a sufficient intake of ORS.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 81, "end": 83, "text": "2,", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}, {"start": 84, "end": 87, "text": "10,", "ref_id": "BIBREF10"}, {"start": 88, "end": 90, "text": "11", "ref_id": "BIBREF11"}, {"start": 976, "end": 978, "text": "24", "ref_id": "BIBREF24"}, {"start": 1165, "end": 1167, "text": "3,", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 1168, "end": 1170, "text": "10", "ref_id": "BIBREF10"}, {"start": 1652, "end": 1654, "text": "17", "ref_id": "BIBREF17"}, {"start": 1723, "end": 1725, "text": "8,", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1726, "end": 1729, "text": "17,", "ref_id": "BIBREF17"}, {"start": 1730, "end": 1732, "text": "19", "ref_id": "BIBREF19"}, {"start": 2299, "end": 2300, "text": "1", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}, {"start": 2963, "end": 2966, "text": "12,", "ref_id": "BIBREF12"}, {"start": 2967, "end": 2969, "text": "13", "ref_id": "BIBREF13"}, {"start": 3218, "end": 3220, "text": "25", "ref_id": "BIBREF25"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 2970, "end": 2979, "text": "(Table 1)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 3519, "end": 3528, "text": "(Table 3)", "ref_id": "TABREF5"}], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "Unfortunately, the severe metabolic acidosis of recumbent diarrheic calves (BE: \u00c015 to \u00c030 mM) may be slightly aggravated by application of saline-whether administered as a continuous infusion or as a hypertonic injection. Saline creates a strong ion acidosis because the effective SID 1 of calf plasma is 42 mEq/L, 21 whereas the effective SID 1 of saline is 0 mEq/L. The administration of 4 mL saline (7.2%)/kg BW within 4 minutes decreased the plasma pH in swine with hemorrhagic shock and mixed acidosis by 0.08 pH units. 26 This decrease has been considered to be clinically inconsequential, 17 predominantly because an improvement of the blood pH is achieved by the intake of buffers from ORS. In calves with a pre-existing severe acidemia, however, a further decrease of plasma pH because of hypertonic saline application may be detrimental. In that respect, the shortterm restoration of the suckling reflex is of crucial importance because intake of ORS represents a prerequisite for successful rehydration treatment. A negative correlation has been suggested between the degree of the acidosis and the vigorousness of the suckling reflex. 13 Also, in our studies, a sustained improvement of oral fluid intake was achieved predominantly in those calves where the acidemia could be corrected quickly. In most calves where hypertonic rehydration failed, the general condition deteriorated, concomitant with a reduction of oral fluid intake and in the face of a prolonged acidemia. The concentrations of D-lactate were most likely massively increased in the diarrheic calves studied compared with healthy calves as indicated by profoundly increased AG 27 (Table 3) . Such increased concentrations of D-lactate contribute significantly to weakness and disturbed consciousness 27,28 but they do not seem to influence the suckling reflex. 15 The administration of HBS represents a therapeutic option to correct the metabolic acidosis faster than by hypertonic saline. Even calves with a BE of \u00c010 to \u00c022 mM were treated successfully and plasma pH increased already within 6 hours up to physiologic values. In calves, 10 mL/kg BW bicarbonate solution (8.4%) provides a buffer capacity sufficient to equalize a BE of about \u00c015 to \u00c020 mM. 2, 13 Because of the high effective SID 1 (1000 mEq/L), a strong ion alkalosis is induced and was measured in our calves (Table 4 ). Double the amount of sodium compared with 5 mL saline (5.85%)/ kg BW was administered, leading to the question of whether the application of 10 mL bicarbonate solution (8.4%)/kg BW within 8 minutes is more hazardous for the patient than hypertonic saline.

The tachypnea being more pronounced in calves receiving hypertonic bicarbonate than saline is most likely because of the hypercapnia (Table 4 ). In study II (NaHCO 3 ), several calves with only slight metabolic acidosis were treated, which did not require buffer capacity at all. Nevertheless, also these patients had had no problem in coping with the application of hypertonic bicarbonate by enhancing ventilation. Even newborn calves with mixed respiratory acidosis because of dystocia (mean blood pH 7.06) were successfully treated by infusion of on average 270 mL sodium bicarbonate solution (5%) over 15 minutes, combined with doxapram IV and intranasal oxygen insufflation 29 ; no negative effects compared with calves treated with carbicarb were found. Also, rapid IV administration of HBS (8.4%; 5 mL/kg over 5 minutes) was found to be effective and safe for treating strong ion acidosis in normovolemic calves with experimentally induced respiratory and strong ion acidosis. 19 In these 2 studies, however, lower amounts of bicarbonate were infused than in study II presented here. Many calves, especially with a longer history of diarrhea, also suffer from respiratory infections. It remains unknown whether removal of excessive CO 2 after application of HBS by hyperventilation is possible in such patients. Reports of practitioners about sudden fatalities in calves after hypertonic bicarbonate infusion may be an indication that such incidents could be related to respiratory insufficiencies. At present, it is recommended to avoid the application of hypertonic bicarbonate in calves suffering from severe respiratory disease, whereas hypertonic saline can also be applied in such patients. (2) Especially in patients with an impaired ability to remove carbon dioxide, a PIA after rapid injection of large quantities of bicarbonate has been discussed as a matter of concern. 30 Accordingly, bicarbonate ions react with H 1 ions to form CO 2 , which readily enters cells and overwhelms the blood-brain barrier because of its high solubility. Thus, the intracellular PCO 2 increases, which induces a local respiratory acidosis. The clinical consequences are unclear; it has been postulated that an acidification of the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) may exaggerate a depression and increase the respiratory rate. 31 A PIA has been demonstrated in in vitro studies after increasing the extracellular PCO 2 by approximately 70 mmHg. 30, 32 However, in vivo the PCO 2 rarely increases more than 15 mmHg. It has been suggested that the increase of PCO 2 after bicarbonate application can be aggravated by the concomitant release of protons from extracellular nonbicarbonate buffers in severely acidotic patients. 30 Berchtold et al 19 induced experimentally a mixed respiratory and metabolic acidosis in calves and found, after subsequent injection of bicarbonate solution (8.4%, 5 mL/kg BW over 5 minutes), no pH change in the CSF irrespective of a transient increase of arterial PCO 2 from 81 to 93 mmHg. A turnover rate of CO 2 into the CSF of 0.01 minute \u00c01 was calculated. In our patients, a statistical trend (P 5 .08) was found for the relation between plasma pH before injection of hypertonic bicarbonate and the increase of venous PCO 2 after injection (Table 4 ). However, PCO 2 increased only by on average 17 mmHg directly after the initial treatment. Thus, PIA seems not to be a reason for profound problems after hypertonic bicarbonate application in calves with a healthy respiratory tract. (3) Concerns were expressed with respect to IV treatment of diarrheic calves with bicarbonate solutions because the concomitant hypercapnia and removal of metabolic acidosis may worsen the oxygen extraction in peripheral tissues of such patients. 33 Based on the results presented here, these concerns seem to be inappropriate despite an extensive transient metabolic alkalosis immediately after injection of HBS (Table 4) , which can be explained by incomplete distribution of bicarbonate in the extracellular space. The general condition of most calves that received bicarbonate solution improved rapidly-presumably, the improved blood flow because of increased plasma volume overwhelms the negative impact of a left shift of the oxygen equilibrium curve.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 1091, "end": 1093, "text": "19", "ref_id": "BIBREF19"}, {"start": 2426, "end": 2428, "text": "31", "ref_id": "BIBREF31"}, {"start": 2544, "end": 2547, "text": "30,", "ref_id": "BIBREF30"}, {"start": 2548, "end": 2550, "text": "32", "ref_id": "BIBREF32"}, {"start": 2822, "end": 2824, "text": "30", "ref_id": "BIBREF30"}, {"start": 2841, "end": 2843, "text": "19", "ref_id": "BIBREF19"}, {"start": 3862, "end": 3864, "text": "33", "ref_id": "BIBREF33"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 240, "end": 248, "text": "(Table 4", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 3371, "end": 3379, "text": "(Table 4", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 4028, "end": 4037, "text": "(Table 4)", "ref_id": null}], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "Because oral fluid intake is of crucial importance for the success of hypertonic rehydration, an intensive fosterage of the calf after initial treatment represents a prerequisite. The recovery of critically ill patients is undoubtedly facilitated by providing many small meals. The variation of milk as well as ORS intake during each meal after hypertonic rehydration is high. Thus, calves in studies I and II were fed 8 times per day. Moreover, a high feeding frequency reduces the risk of long periods with a low pH in the abomasum, favoring the development of abomasal ulcerations. 34 Hypernatremia (serum sodium 4160 mM) is a dreaded syndrome in diarrheic calves 35 ; it is often because of oral application of ORS with an inadequate composition (sodium 4160 mM). The results of the present study indicate that a hypernatremia was not a problem in the hypertonic-rehydrated calves. Hypertonic saline (5.85%, 5 mL/kg) and hypertonic bicarbonate (8.4%, 10 mL/kg) correspond in a 40 kg calf to a total of only 200 and 400 mmol sodium, respectively. Serum sodium increased immediately after completing the injection of HBS by 20 mM, triggering an increase of plasma osmolarity of roughly 20-25 mOsmol/L; an increase in this range has also been reported. 17 The immediate dilution of extracellular compartment by an influx of intracellular and transcellular fluid excludes the risk of a clinically significant hypernatremia.
