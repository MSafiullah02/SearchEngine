Although early studies suggested that children and adolescents could be spared from severe disease, reports have since been published of children hospitalised or dying from COVID-19. 1, 2 We report a 14-year-old previously healthy individual who presented to our institution with a 3-day history of pyrexia, abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting, but with out respiratory symptoms. The patient's mother reported mild respiratory symptoms 3 weeks previously but the patient had not been tested for SARS-CoV-2.",

The abdomen was tense, with guarding in the right upper and lower quadrants. Initial investigations showed lymphopenia (0\u00b714 \u00d7 10 9 cells per L [normal range 1\u00b75-7\u00b76]), a signi ficant increase in C-reactive protein (242 mg/L [normal range 0-8]), and sterile pyuria (30 cells). The patient was started on empiric piperacillin-tazobactam for sus pected acute appendicitis, and nasopharyngeal swabs were sent for SARS-CoV-2 PCR testing. Chest radiography (figure, A) and abdominal ultrasound were normal. Within 24 h of admission, the patient developed increasing dyspnoea, cough, and oxygen requirement (8 L/min), finally escalating to continuous positive airway pressure ventilation support. The patient seemed visually more unwell and inter acted less, developed a widespread maculopapular blanch ing rash (figure, B), and received fluid boluses for persistent tachycardia. Chest CT showed typical findings of SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia (figure, C). 3 A diagnosis of presumptive COVID-19 was made. Secondary multisystem inflammatory disease or cytokine storm syndrome was diagnosed based on clinical symptoms, lymphopenia, anaemia, thrombocyto penia, increased acutephase pro teins (ie, C-reactive protein and ferritin), raised serum interleukin (IL)-6 (1098 pg/mL [ . Furthermore, the patient developed mild polyarticular arthritis of the small joints of the hands. No sub stan tial cervical lymphadenopathy, conjunctivitis, or mucous mem brane changes were seen to suggest classic or com plete Kawasaki disease.",

Because the patient showed clinical features sugges tive of COVID-19-associated cytokine storm syn drome, 1,4 antiinflammatory treatment with recombinant IL-1 rec e ptor antagonist (anakinra) was initiated after multi disciplinary discussions. Anakinra was started at 4 mg/kg per day (100 mg twice a day) subcutaneously and increased to 8 mg/kg per day (200 mg twice a day) after 36 h, because the patient required inotropic support for hypotension and rising lactate (6 mmol/L). Borderline left-ventricular systolic dysfunction, enzyme leak (troponin-T 45 ng/L), aortic regurgitation, and pro gressive left coronary dilatation were noted (figure, D), and aspirin was started (2 mg/kg) for its anti thrombotic effects. Of note, Kawasaki disease-like features, including coronary aneurysms, have been rep orted in patients with COVID-19. 2 Since coronary artery dilation can occur in the context of systemic inflammatory disease, endothelial activation, or both, 5 and because the patient did not show additional clinical features of Kawasaki disease, we did not start intravenous immuno globulin or corticosteroids, after weighing the risks associated with intravenous immunoglobulin treatment (ie, thromboembolic events, aseptic meningitis, and antibody-dependent enhancement).",

            "text": "To our knowledge, this case is the first paediatric patient reported with cytokine storm syndrome during the COVID-19 pandemic presenting without respiratory symptoms on hospital admission who was successfully treated with IL-1 inhibition. Although respiratory and stool PCR testing was negative, CT chest findings and biochemical and haematological variables were highly suggestive of COVID-19, with evidence of seroconversion. Considering that PCR test sensitivity ranges around 60%, after three negative PCR results, this case could represent a post-COVID-19 inflammatory process. An alternative explanation could be viral replication at an alternative site. Although the patient developed earlystage acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) in the hospital (severe oxygenation defect and bilateral pulmonary infiltrates), respiratory symptoms were not part of the initial presentation. Thus, the case resembles a previously unappreciated clinical phenotype of COVID-19 in children with rapid onset ARDS and cytokine storm syndrome after fever and abdominal pain in the absence of preceding respiratory symptoms. 1, 2 Based on our current pathophysiological under standing, SARS-CoV-2 replicates in respiratory and intes tinal epithelial cells and suppresses early type I inter feron responses. Furthermore, SARS-CoV-2 can abort ively infect innate immune cells (monocytes and macro phages), which can be facilitated by immune com plexes, accelerating viral replication and amplify ing pro inflam matory cytokine (IL-1, IL-6, tumour nec rosis factor [TNF]) release in a process termed antibody-dependent enhancement. Viral replication results in tissue damage and excessive recruitment of innate and adaptive immune cells, which mediates a dysregulated hyperinflammatory response Ferritin (ng/mL) C-reactive protein (mg/L) D-dimer (ng/mL) that contributes to cyto kine storm syndrome and organ damage, includ ing ARDS. 6 In addition to the direct cytopathic effect inflicted on target organs, pulmonary damage seen in COVID-19 is probably augmented, if not dominated, by an unopposed dysregulated immune response. ARDS can occur in patients with primary or secondary cytokine storm syndrome, including systemic juvenile idiopathic arthritis, resembling the clinical picture in the reported patient. This finding could account for the rapid onset of clinical and imaging findings. 7 Since the patient showed altered clotting (prolonged prothrombin time and activated partial thromboplastin time, and increased D-dimer) in the presence of antiphospholipid antibodies and pathologically reduced serum complement levels, immune complex generation and deposition could, in addition to endothelial activation through IL-1, have contributed to activation of the complement and clotting cascades. 8 Indeed, postinfectious antiphospholipid syn drome with thromboembolism has been reported in the context of COVID-19. 9 Furthermore, complement activa tion can take place in systemic inflammatory disorders, such as systemic juvenile idiopathic arthritis-associated macrophage activa tion syndrome. 10 Off-label treatment with anakinra was chosen to limit proinflammatory cytokine expression, which could have been triggered by antibody-dependent enhancement or invasion of yet uninfected immune cells to infected tissues. Of note, anakinra blocks IL-1 receptor signalling, which induces the expression of IL-1, IL-6, and TNF via activation of NF-\u03baB-dependent pathways. 11 Although most clinical trials currently underway investigate IL-6 blockade, we chose anakinra based on its action upstream of IL-6 and because of less neutropenia, liver enzyme elevation, and hypertriglyceridemia, which are already present in patients with cytokine storm syndrome. Furthermore, anakinra reduces mortality in sepsis patients, 12 whereas chronic use of IL-6 blocking agents might increase the risk of secondary infections. Anakinra treatment coincided with clinical improvement and was stopped after 6 days.",

A widespread maculopapular blanching rash (B) appeared on the second day after admission (day 0) and improved after initiation of anakinra treatment. Axial CT on day 0 (C), when anakinra treatment was started, shows interlobular and intralobular septal thickening and rounded ground-glass opacities, predominantly in a peripheral distribution in both lungs; small peripheral or subpleural areas of subsegmental collapse or consolidation are noted, particularly at the bases. Axial CT on day 11 (D) shows a severely dilated left mainstem coronary artery (arrow) and proximal left anterior descending artery (Z-score 6\u00b76 on echocardiography [not shown] and CT). Laboratory and clinical (core temperature) variables (E) indicate rapid and sustained improvement temporally associated with anakinra treatment (started day 0",
