Furthermore, its corrosivity has been tamed, thus widening its materials compatibility. The AHP technology has combined these developments to enhance the potential of H2O2 as a microbicide, resulting in formulations for a variety of applications.13, 14 The stabilizers, surfactants, and other excipients in these formulations have a high safety and biodegradability profile and are free from aquatic toxicants such as nonyl phenol ethoxylates (NPEs) or alkyl phenyl ethoxylates (APEs).15, 16 The findings summarized here further substantiate the desirable attributes of the AHP-based formulation evaluated.",
