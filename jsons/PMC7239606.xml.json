            "text": "In 1991, Crime, Law and Social Change published its longest ever single article, at just over 40,000 words: it was a review of the shaping of the anti-money laundering (AML) movement, at that time little more than a twinkle in Panopticon\u2019s eye. It began by observing (Levi 1991: 217):The principal points of contact between police and bankers are in relation to (1) frauds (and other crimes such as robbery) against banks themselves, in which banks lose money, and (2) crimes or suspected crimes - involving dishonesty, import/export prohibitions (e.g. as I write [in 1990], arms to Iraq), narcotics, or terrorism - whose perpetrators and victims have individual or corporate bank accounts, even though in such cases, the banks themselves may not lose any money and may even make profits from handling the accounts. There are also further areas of state interest in banking transactions, such as the activities of arms dealers who may not be committing any offences in the U.K. or elsewhere, but who are of concern to the security services.The movement in the direction of encouraging - and in an increasing range of cases, requiring \u2013 \u2018active citizenship\u2019 on the part of banks has as its objectives to prevent criminals from benefiting financially (a) from the offences for which they have been convicted, and (b) to the extent that monetary gain is the criminals\u2019 primary goal or is a crucial means to their other (e.g. political) goals, to deter or prevent them and others from committing crimes for gain in the future. These objectives are being pursued not only in Britain but also in the international arena.Why should bankers co-operate with the police? Motives for co-operation can be placed on a continuum between positive - as when natural and/or corporate persons all hope to get something they want out of the relationship, even if the benefits are unequal - and negative - if the relationship arises solely out of fear or threat that something bad will happen to either or to both parties. Many non-banking professionals such as lawyers and accountants responded to my announcement of this research topic by asking, rhetorically, \u2018what relationships?\u2019 But in practice, police-bank relationships are characterized by a combination of both positive and negative elements.",

Especially in Europe but in different ways throughout the globe, first bankers and then accountants, lawyers, notaries, real estate agents and even car dealers have been involuntarily co-opted into becoming unpaid agents of the state: identifying customers (individual and corporate) and transforming conventional legal constructs such as customer confidentiality, reporting both their suspicions (if they have them) and large cash transactions to central bodies. There is pressure from international bodies and national governments to get an increasing number of reports from a bigger range of commercial and professional actors. But what happens afterwards to these reports is far less transparent and\u2014especially in those jurisdictions where there are the most reports\u2014is frequently unproductive in visible outcomes such as prosecutions, asset recoveries and the prevention of serious crimes.

But what sorts of risks are they managing (and do they believe they are managing), and how politically coherent, serious and well-considered has the attempt been? The aims of nations (especially the original key movers\u2014the USA, UK and France, with Switzerland and Australia also playing an important role) can change over time, but it is easy to over-estimate their coherence and stability over time. Interviews and documentation collected by the Levi (2000\u20132003) suggest that there were national issues that gave rise to particular foci of control interest\u2014sometimes, like \u2018drug abuse\u2019, independently in different countries\u2014before any coordinated international activity was even contemplated. Thus, prior to the UN Vienna Drugs Convention of 1988, the Swiss Banking Commission sought to regulate capital flight, and (post-Watergate) the Americans criminalised the bribery of public officials overseas, while the Americans and British (but almost no other countries at the time) criminalised drugs money laundering. These actions were prompted by concrete ambitions and sometimes by international scandals such as bad publicity for Switzerland as a \u2018bank secrecy haven for kleptocrats\u2019 and for the UK\u2019s Crown Dependencies and Overseas Territories (and, to a less publicised extent, the Dutch Antilles ex-colonies) as \u2018corporate secrecy havens\u2019.",

They were not major players in policy formation, but were welcomed as major financial hubs, and partly also to legitimate the idea of FATF as a global body: it became a permanent body only 30 years later, in 2019. The Russian Federation joined FATF in 2003, China in 2007, the Republic of (South) Korea in 2009, India in 2010 and Malaysia in 2016, reflecting both the size of their economies and their political importance, as well as their readiness (within limits) to buy into the global AML protocols. Those are the only Asian countries in FATF, though Indonesia is also currently an observer, normally a prelude to full membership. This has been a conscious geographical expansion by FATF, and the rise in Asian membership reflects the shift to the Far East in economic growth and power. Thus, while much focus has been on Asia as a production hub in the global supply chain for a vast array of goods, it has also risen financially. Looking at it from a financialisation rather than industrial perspective, in the well-established Global Financial Centres Index (2020), Asian countries now occupy the top seven places within the Asia Pacific region, and only New York and (pre-Brexit) London rank higher in the world (see Table 1).1 Though Hong Kong\u2019s standing has fallen since the previous year, five Asian centres are now within ten points of London in the calculations. This table and others in the report may not be an indicator of centres\u2019 respective roles in laundering the proceeds of crimes committed domestically or internationally, but it does reflect changes in the financial and political orientation of the international AML bodies and the need to ensure broader compliance in Asia.",

So, it would be a mistake to \u2018back-read\u2019 the current confluence of interest in money laundering as a natural reflection of those specialised institutional interests: it took a determined effort (a) to get the anti-corruption movement to see the relevance of money laundering and (b) to persuade the IMF of money laundering\u2019s (still disputed) macro-economic relevance to its formal mandate.",

Early Italian interest in the use of proceeds of bank robberies to fund the activities of the Brigate Rossi in the late 1970s drove local requirements on Italian banks to report large cash deposits, and the realisation that this would make sense across borders and be applied to the Council of Europe generally. However at that time, there was insufficient political support for a binding convention, and the more modest recommendation was made which in turn fed into the justification of the first general measure against money laundering and asset confiscation in Europe\u2014the Strasbourg Convention of 1990\u2014which went beyond the drugs-only focus of the 1988 UN Vienna Convention because it was already apparent to the Council of Europe Secretariat and to countries such as the UK that the drugs-only approach (which was so necessary to get agreement in the consensus atmosphere of the UN) was a theory failure: not only did it not go far enough for a serious measure of major crime control, but also it left too much room for \u2018launderers\u2019 and financial intermediaries such as banks to claim that they did not know that the funds were proceeds of drug trafficking.",

At that time, however, the European Commission had no competence in criminal matters, so controls of money laundering had to be smuggled in under the (still largely unexamined) guise that variations in Member State provisions against laundering were a threat to the integrity of and free flow of funds within the internal market. This was a fiction that most Member States were happy to go along with (though many did not see it as a fiction), since the Treasury officials of the larger States had already been led by the FATF into thinking that AML was part of their role, and it was difficult politically to be seen to support money laundering, particularly when the measures of control were not obviously severe. When this author was rapporteur at a UN conference in 1994 at Courmayeur, it was clear that China and Russia wanted to restrict AML to proceeds of drug trafficking, but this reflected their crime and political concerns at the time, and AML has now extended universally to all crimes, including overseas tax evasion and financing \u2018terrorism\u2019\u2014a much disputed term around the world because of its value in suppressing and de-legitimating minority struggles.",

            "text": "Also important in the evolution of AML activities were more modest elements, well below the threshold of grand social movements or international diplomacy. Prior to the Treaty of Amsterdam, the European Commission had no formal policy development and initiation role in crime control issues. However, the encouragement by funding of mutual assistance programmes under the principle of information exchange, combined with sharing of experiences by members of FATF (a permanent body from 2019) and Egmont\u2014a global semi-official organisation of Financial Intelligence Units whose secretariat currently is in Toronto, which has grown from 12 members in 1995 (when it began) to 101 in July 2005 and 164 in 2020\u2014generates a level of mutual knowledge at a personal and perhaps legal system level that encourages interpenetration, though this is easier to do within common law and within civil code systems than between them. The increased \u2018traffic\u2019 between countries forces them at an operational level to seek solutions to their interface problems (though these do not always succeed or are they always intended to). Thus, Egmont was generated originally by the need of the American and Belgian administrative type financial intelligence units (FIUs) to both obtain information from and transmit information to police-type FIUs that existed elsewhere in the world (Today, this issue still causes difficulties, for example in Germany, at a domestic as well as international level.). So it would be a mistake to see these policies and practice mobilities/transfers as coming either from above or from below: rather they come from both, though given the financial cost of many exchanges in the money trail arena, some positive support from senior officials is often needed before the exchanges are allowed to develop. In this sense, international policing is different from local partnership policing, where few marginal costs are involved: mid-week plane fares, hotels and time off work are considerably more expensive and generally cannot be found from routine or training budgets. Note, however, that except for regular formal meetings, such extra funds tend to be available only for activities related to \u2018organised crime\u2019 or \u2018terrorism financing\u2019 as commonly understood. So, if these issues had not struck a political chord, some of these developments might have been strangled for lack of finance.",

The other key role of the EU has been in relation to the acquis communautaire, which has enabled them to engage in pressurised policy transfer of AML, anti-corruption and mutual legal assistance legislation and programmes to candidate countries. This has involved self-assessment questionnaires, mutual evaluations (also making use of the MONEYVAL and GRECO evaluations within the Council of Europe framework) and some technical assistance programmes. No other region has been able to exert analogous pressure, based on shared values (currently under strain from Hungary and Poland), and aside from the lack of institutional leverage, it is doubtful if sufficient mutuality and trust exists within Asia. The USA has long exerted its own pressures unilaterally and multi-laterally, and this is not the place to review its efforts.",

In this sense, it has never aspired to the procedural rigour recommended by the OECD (2020) on Regulatory Impact Analysis. Most of the political drivers began in the USA, with efforts by the (Reagan) US Presidential Commission on Organized Crime (1986) to get investigators to \u2018follow the money\u2019, but there was almost no input from academic criminologists or economists into bolstering the anti-money laundering movement, whatever modest input some individuals may have had on shaping the struggle against organised crime. Nor did academic critics and/or empirical research have any noticeable effect on slowing the AML movement down, despite the private reservations of some law enforcement officials and professionals (Naylor 1999; van Duyne et al. 2019), though even with the EU, there are differences of emphasis and structure related to national cultures and principles of law (Vogel and Maillart 2020).",

As we shall see, it is far easier to critique the data that exist than it is to work out and to create the empirics that illuminate effectiveness, and one question should be whether (as in drug policy) governments individually or collectively really want to evaluate effectiveness and to adjust their policies in the light of it. \u2018Crime control\u2019 is often a matter of expressing values or signalling virtue rather than reflecting evidence from science.4 Signal crimes (Innes 2014) are more salient than crime data to most politicians and priority setters.",

Jurisdictions are encouraged to conduct National Risk Assessments, presumably with their own country\u2019s risks\u2014i.e. threats and vulnerabilities\u2014as the central organising concept, though any proper analysis of money laundering risks should contain analysis of the risks posed to other countries as well as one\u2019s own. For example, an analysis of the threat posed by money laundering in the casinos in Macau (or, for that matter, in the casinos of Australia or in Canada\u2019s British Columbia\u2014see German 2018, 2019) cannot properly ignore the threat to China from corruption, embezzlement and other forms of crime occurring in China, even if there was little risk of this laundering increasing domestic crimes in Macau, Australia and Canada. Besides, it seems likely that much gambling in Asia and elsewhere is carried out because criminals like gambling rather than primarily to launder money, though tighter controls on identifying gamblers might frighten them off gambling in regulated places: what impact such controls would have on levels of criminality is an open question, especially if they could easily engage in illegal underground gambling which might increase their liability to blackmail and mixing between public officials, \u2018pure\u2019 financial criminals and \u2018organised criminals\u2019.",

Thus, a country can have a variety of documents or instruments that collectively may satisfy the requirements of the FATF standards but which, even when taken together, do not constitute a serious National Risk Assessment. Many Global South countries in Asia and elsewhere do not publish their NRAs, and those that do, publish only sanitised versions: it is moot whether the classified versions are significantly more informative, not least because though they may contain more detailed cases and names, it is uncertain what data they could collect easily would illuminate the risks and weaknesses better. Thus, publicly available data on crimes and how they are used to address money laundering risks are extremely patchy, even in FATF countries, let alone in Asian and other countries where criminological sophistication and an appetite for openness may be low. As the FATF Mutual Evaluation Report for China (2019, para 10) put it:Overall authorities in China demonstrated a strong understanding of the contents of the NRA which was finalized just prior to the on-site visit. However, given the focus of the NRA and the activity of LEAs, on predicate offences and the lack of attention to how the proceeds of crime are actually laundered, beyond those directly implicated in the crime, China\u2019s overall understanding of ML risks, while achieved to a large extent, is hampered by such a focus. The assessment of risks of legal entities focuses on existing control measures. The TF [terror finance] assessment contained within the NRA is based mainly on qualitative analysis. The analysis collates information from departments involved in countering terrorism, primarily MSS, MPS and the PBC, identifying sources and channels of terrorist financing, and identifying the TF threats faced by China.",

There are a few areas where controls need to be strengthened and efforts are underway to address these areas\u201d (Singapore, 2013: 5). Malaysia\u2019s NRAs have been published, but even the most recent one in 2018 contains no mention of the 1MDB scandal, one of the largest alleged embezzlements of public funds in history which has already brought down senior executives at Goldman Sachs bank and where in 2019\u20132020, the former Prime Minister Najib Razak has been on trial.5 Japan\u2019s 2014 and 2018 NRAs are published, though there is little hint in them of what methodologies have been used to underlie these, a gap that is common even in G7 NRAs (Ferwerda and Reuter 2019).

Conceptually, what is the marginal harm arising from the laundering of the proceeds of domestic crimes that is not also a harm of the crimes themselves? Bribery and/or blackmail of financial service staff, regulators and law enforcement may occur in any country. But as with prohibition of alcohol or drugs, some of those crimes may be an artefact of the criminalisation of laundering rather than the direct result of the laundering itself: in the \u2018good old days\u2019, such funds might simply have been accepted and used, so there was no need to bribe or pressurise staff, and bank regulators might have been interested in the loan book and internal theft risks but not in customer integrity except as fraud risks.(Some serious Asian banking problems have been the result of non-arm\u2019s length \u2018loans\u2019 to politically well-connected businesspeople that then are defaulted or never pursued by the banks, but that is fraud or corruption, not just a laundering harm.). Al Capone and Meyer Lansky were laundering the proceeds of illegal gambling, extortion and alcohol trafficking before laundering was criminalised, presumably in order to make it more difficult for the authorities to link their proclaimed assets and themselves to crimes (and maybe also to evade taxes). Some fraudsters\u2014 in Asia and elsewhere\u2014will seek havens where they and their assets will be protected and from which they can launch their scams, but this protection (including corruption but also lack of enforcement motivation) often accompanies crime commission as well as laundering.",

Like many estimates coming from NGOs and even from IGOs like the IMF, World Bank and UNODC, their main impact is that they are big and therefore generate an action imperative and a claim on our moral consciences. These estimates are seldom if ever used as an effectiveness baseline, not least because they would be too demotivating for agencies and bad PR as a very small percentage of total crime proceeds/laundering.

However, it often entails a confusion between activity\u2014legislating or arresting or seizing assets or \u2018doing something\u2019 about a problem\u2014and outcomes such as less crime, less \u2018organised\u2019 crime, or less social harm. To a populist politician, the popularity of a display of effort against something may be sufficient as an outcome, though few are brave (or perhaps even aware) enough to declaim that explicitly as their only goal. But, there are few criminal justice policies whose impact on crime can be so easily and quickly judged. And the more complicated and broad the target offences are, the longer is likely to be the time taken for evaluation and for the linkages between actions and effects. Furthermore, whereas we might measure economic transfers (e.g. burglary, robbery, theft, some frauds) by crime/victim surveys of the general population or sub-populations, service crimes (illegal drugs, sex, gambling) are harder to measure accurately, though they can be measured by anonymous self-report general population surveys. Measuring the involvement of a range of actors in money laundering is harder still, since these may include not only \u2018underground\u2019 businesses but also mainly legitimate players whose intentional wrongdoing would be deeply contested even if there were prima facie evidence of their involvement.15 If one broadens the lens, one might look at Google, Facebook and other social media platforms who are paid by scammers and others to advertise and trick victims, or to engage potential money mules for laundering proceeds of any crimes (e.g. from Chinese underground banking via Chinese students internationally\u2014 NCA 2019). If paid from proceeds of crime, they are properly labelled as \u2018professional enablers\u2019 (see generally, Levi and Soudijn 2020), though this label does not imply that they have the level of intention or recklessness to be prosecutable for money laundering offences.",

The closest to this systematic approach for finance is the US Geographic Targeting Orders.16 Whether the same metrics should be used for different forms of crime is an open question, and may need close attention to the routes through which illicit products pass and who needs to be paid where for their contributions to the particular crime patterns (which can change over time). Beyond media headlines, long prison sentences for individuals or the direct economic costs of large financial penalties and monitorships against financial intermediaries, the impacts of such approaches are unclear, except on employment and consultancy income in the AML sector, which benefit substantially. \u2018Policing for profit\u2019 asset confiscation obviously stimulates investigative activity, but the positive and negative effects of that on levels and organisation of different crimes are only partially understood.",

But it is not currently viable to conclude that any type of crime has been substantially reduced let alone eliminated altogether by AML/CTF measures (Levi et al. 2018; Halliday et al. 2019). It is also important to be clear about what component has plausibly impacted on which crimes (as we noted earlier when teasing out the differences between the harms of predicate crimes and the harms of laundering).

However, one of their aims of this article is to get criminologists and other social scientists to engage with the conceptual as well as empirical issues involved in measuring crime problems and the connections between \u2018anti-criminal finance\u2019 interventions and criminal behaviours, as others have done in the analysis of drug markets (MacCoun and Reuter 2010; UNODC 2019). It may be time for us to devote more sceptical attention to claims about how money is laundered, to claims about the efficiency of AML processes and the likely effects on crime of efforts to combat laundering and the financing of terrorism. This should include attention to the possible counterproductive impacts (Grabosky 1995) of some AML control measures on social welfare. This includes the impact of extra financial transparency on the efficiency of extortionate \u2018rent seeking\u2019 by officials and on the suppression of political opposition. Criminological analysis of criminal markets and of different offences\u2014including the impact of evolving technologies in financing crime, crime commission and laundering\u2014can play a part in generating a better baseline for criminal and regulatory policies, and more work needs to be done to link changes in them to AML efforts of various types. Even disregarding the impact that the COVID-19 pandemic will have on resources and priorities around the world, in the final analysis, we need to decide how much investment of resources in both public and private sectors AML efforts merit, and this requires a more critical and detailed analysis than has been common to date. Much expenditure is \u2018buried\u2019 in private sector financial and civil liberties costs passed on to customers and shareholders, and in general, it is viewed as merely a regulatory burden rather than as a private or public welfare choice subject to normal cost-benefit criteria. Law enforcement and regulatory expenditures on AML are relatively modest compared with private sector expenditures, and often have been viewed as marginal additions rather than as a substitute for other forms of policing.",
