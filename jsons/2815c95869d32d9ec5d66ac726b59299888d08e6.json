Each intercostal space of upper and lower parts of the anterior, lateral, and posterior regions of the left and right chest wall were carefully examined, and findings (pleural effusion, confluent and isolated B-lines, irregular pleural line, consolidations) were recorded (11-12). For each of the 12-zone a score from 0 to 3 was given according to the finding: irregular or isolated B-lines (1 point), confluent B-lines (2 points) and consolidations or pleural effusion (3 points). The total \"Lung Ultrasonography (LUS) Score\" was calculated by summing the scores of all 12 zones (range of possible scores, 0-36). A compatible LUS exam was considered a bilateral pattern of B-lines, isolated or confluent, irregular pleural line and subpleural consolidations.",
