Saint-Louis Hospital is a 650-bed tertiary university hospital that specializes in haematology, renal transplantation and oncology. NPAs were collected using a standardized procedure; in other words, a catheter was inserted into the patient's nostrils as far as the posterior pharynx and a mural vacuum pump was used for suction of mucosity. Aspirate was collected in a sterile tube using a mucus extractor device (Unomedical, Clayton, Australia) and sent to the microbiology laboratory within an hour of this procedure. Patients were classified as immunocompromised if they were HIV positive, presented with haematological malignancy, had a solid tumour, had undergone solid organ transplantation, or were on a high-dose steroid regimen (>30 mg per day for at least 30 days), whereas all other patients were classified as not immunocompromised (Table\n1\n). The results of specific investigations for PCP, which occurred within 3 days of the NPA procedure, were compared with the NPA results.\n",

One milliliter of this mixture was incubated with 100 \u03bcl of proteinase K for 1 hr at 56\u00b0C. After centrifugation at 1500 g for 10 min, DNA and RNA were extracted from 200 \u03bcl of supernatant using the NucliSENSeasyMAG automated system (bioM\u00e9rieux, Marcy l'Etoile, France) and then eluted in a final volume of 100 \u03bcl. Immediately after a reverse trancriptase step, 10 \u03bcl samples were tested for the 22 respiratory microorganisms included in the RespiFinder-SMART-22 assay (PathoFinder, Maastricht, The Netherlands). The remaining DNA/RNA extracts were frozen at \u221280\u00b0C for future use. The RespiFinder-SMART-22 assay is used for the simultaneous detection and identification of 18 respiratory viruses (adenovirus, coronaviruses 229E, NL63, OC43, HKU1, human metapneumovirus, influenza A virus, influenza A virus H1N1, influenza B virus, parainfluenza viruses \u22121, \u22122, \u22123 and \u22124, respiratory syncytial virus A and \u2212B, rhinovirus, enterovirus, and bocavirus) and four bacteria (\nBordetella pertussis\n,\nChlamydophila pneumonia\n,\nLegionella pneumophila\n,\nMycoplasma pneumoniae\n). The quality of NPA sampling was checked by estimating the number of cells collected in all samples using a qPCR assay targeting the gene coding for human albumin [\n21\n]. NegativeRespiFinder-SMART-22 results were considered valid if albumin DNA was \u22651000 copies/ml. DNA extraction and amplification yields were assessed using the Simplexa Extraction and Amplification Control Set (Focus Diagnostics, Cypress, Calif., USA) as an internal control (IC). In sum, 5 \u03bcl of IC were added to the processed 200 \u03bcl before DNA/RNA extraction and a quantification cycle (Cq) of 30 +/\u2212 3 was expected for validation. For NPAs with IC Cq value >33, DNA/RNA extracts were combined with 0.5 \u03bcl TaqMan exogenous internal positive control (IPC) DNA (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA) and amplified with the IPC primers to look for the presence of PCR inhibitors in the extracted DNA/RNAs; the expected IPC Cq for this second control was 33 +/\u2212 1.\n",

Six of these 24 (25%) patients had PjqPCR-positive NPAs and underwent IS specifically to test for\nP. jirovecii\n. Fungal loads were lower in NPAs than IS, with a median difference of 61 copies (range: 2\u2013159). Five of the six patients tested specifically for PCP were given a final diagnosis of PCP based on clinical and radiological evidence (Table\n3\n). The sixth PjqPCR-positive patient (Patient 6; Table\n3\n) tested specifically for PCP was not diagnosed PCP but was given atovaquone as anti-PCP prophylaxis. Four of the 10 other PjqPCR-positive patients who underwent no specific investigation and therefore did not receive a diagnosis of PCP were nevertheless given anti-PCP prophylaxis (Table\n3\n). Fifteen of the 18 patients with PjqPCR-negative NPAs who underwent other investigations had PjqPCR-negative sputa, IS or BAL; 3 of these 18 patients had PjqPCR-positive BALs with negative microscopy results and were discharged with no final diagnosis of PCP.\n",

In our PjqPCR-positive samples, additional respiratory microorganisms were detected in 9/16 (56%) patients. Nevertheless, the 4.9% prevalence of\nP. jirovecii\nDNA in these samples cannot be interpreted as an incidental observation. Eleven of the 16 PjqPCR-positive belonged to a population at risk of PCP, such as patients with AIDS, haematological malignancies, solid tumors, renal transplantation, or receiving high-dose steroid therapy. Risk factors for colonization [\n23\n], such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, were also present (Table\n3\n). Interpretation of the term colonization is disputable as these patients were symptomatic with febrile pneumonia. The retrospective design of our study precludes calculation of the sensitivity and specificity of NPA for detection of\nP. jirovecii\nDNA as patients did not undergo the same diagnostic work-up. In particular, there was no systematic analysis of sputum because the initial goal was detection of viruses but when a diagnostic work-up was performed in six patients on the basis of clinical suspicion, five received a final diagnosis of PCP on the basis of microscopic observation of the fungus in IS.\n",

Second, a PjqPCR-positive NPA could be used to support anti-PCP drugs prophylaxis [\n24\n], sometimes restrained due to the potential side effects of trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole.

Strict quantitative comparison is problematic given the heterogeneity of the volumes and the consistency of the clinical specimens; however, in all cases we observed fewer DNA copies in NPA samples than IS samples. A\nP. jirovecii\n-positive NPA may therefore correspond to a much higher fungal load in the alveoli and the thresholds applied in BAL and IS [\n9\u201315\n] should not be applied to NPAs. Of note, three patients with <1\nP. jirovecii\nDNA copy/ml in NPA were diagnosed with PCP. Moreover, a NPA should contain a minimum number of human cells to avoid false negative results in virus [\n26\n,\n27\n] and\nAspergillus\ndetection [\n28\n]; we therefore cannot exclude the possibility that some NPAs were falsely negative for\nP. jirovecii\nor that the fungal load was considerably underestimated because of the poor quality of the NPA. Three PjqPCR-negative NPAs corresponded to PjqPCR-positive BAL fluids, indicating that a negative NPA cannot be used to exclude PCP. The utility of detection of\nP. jirovecii\nDNA in NPA would be greatly improved if it were combined with other noninvasive tests such as detection of beta-D-glucan in serum [\n29\n,\n30\n] and detection of\nP. jirovecii\nDNA in serum [\n31\n].\n",
