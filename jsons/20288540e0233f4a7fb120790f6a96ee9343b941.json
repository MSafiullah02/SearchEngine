The patients 229 with COVID-19 usually had higher AST levels than ALT levels, especially in the 230 non-survival. There was a tendency of the dead cases to arise in the elderly. 231 Should be noted, the pooled percentage of death cases accounted up 31.6%, which 232 was calculated according to the proportion of death cases in each enrolled selected 233 study. It does not intend to mean that the percentage of death cases in the whole 234 population reaches that high. Several reasons that may lead to the higher percentages 235 of death cases in the enrolled study than those in the whole population. First, since the 236 patients in the enrolled studies are all hospitalized or even critically ill patients, it 237 sounds reasonable that the percentage of death case is higher than that in the whole 238 population. Second, the composition difference exists in the enrolled studies caused 239 by the selection of the reporter. Similar to our previous study, most studies focus on 240ALT/AST rather than cholestasis-related indexes such as AKP and GGT levels[10].241In other words, the actual prevalence of abnormal liver chemistries could be 242 underestimated in the studies reporting clinical features of COVID-19.
