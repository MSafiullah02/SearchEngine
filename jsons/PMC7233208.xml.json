However, which aspects of social connectedness are most essential for health and well-being vary across people and within people depending on time and situation. It is important not to make assumptions about the types of social interactions or social relationships that are most meaningful or important to an older person. It is also important to keep in mind that many of us do not give direct thought to these types of questions on a regular basis, and thus older adults may need time to think about what is most important and meaningful to them. One older adult might value positive, brief conversations with a neighbor, while another finds meaning and purpose in a volunteer position, and another finds comfort and solace in deep family relationships.",

Three forms of connectedness are especially salient for helping older adults during COVID-19.34 Social isolation refers to characteristics of social ties and networks that are insufficient, such as infrequent visits/calls with family/friends. Second, social support involves the functions that relationships provide, including information, instrumental support (e.g., assistance with activities of daily living), and emotional support. The third domain is the psychological experience of feeling isolated or connected (e.g., loneliness, belonging). All three domains are included in a 17-item questionnaire designed for use with older adults during the COVID-19 pandemic\u2014the Questionnaire for Assessing the impact of the COVID -19 Pandemic on Older Adults34 (available for free at https://www.qiacpoa.com). Several items assess social isolation during the pandemic, including \u201chow has the frequency of your communication with close friends and family changed\u201d and \u201chow are you continuing to stay in touch with others?\u201d Social support is also assessed, both emotional (\u201cwho is providing you with social support?\u201d) and instrumental (\u201cHow much difficulty do you have obtaining the food that you need/medicine/medical care because of the COVID-19 pandemic or social distancing rules?\u201d) The questionnaire also includes the three-item UCLA Loneliness Scale to assess that domain of connectedness.35\n",

The most effective response is one that targets an individual's specific circumstances and employs straightforward, actionable information to improve social health. The Questionnaire for Assessing the impact of the COVID -19 Pandemic on Older Adults may be useful in conceptualizing patients\u2019 barriers to connectedness, though initiating the conversation with open-ended questions that use broad terms (e.g., relationships) is often useful because terms such as loneliness carry stigma. A nuanced and thoughtful assessment is the most powerful tool in an intervention for social connectedness. While almost any type of increased behavioral activation may reduce depressed mood, any type of increased social activity will not necessarily reduce isolation and loneliness\u2014the intervention must target the cause.",

How we learn to engage with others is often shaped by our familial, cultural, and generational roots. For many older adults who lived the majority of their lives in communities that provided naturally occurring opportunities for social connection, including social clubs, veterans\u2019 organizations, churches, and workplace-sponsored activities, the idea of being intentional about social connection is foreign. In addition, there are many emotional barriers to changing our social behaviors that make maintaining the status quo much more comfortable and less effortful even though isolation and loneliness are painful. It is helpful to identify any factors that may be contributing to reluctance through a question such as, \u201cWhat do you think you might lose by making new friends or participating in new activities?\u201d Or \u201cWhat might be hard about using your Connections Plan?\u201d \u201cWhen you think about [calling X hotline, etc.] what emotion do you feel?\u201d",

            "text": "When educating patients about how perspectives of a stressful event like social distancing can impact our emotional and behavioral responses to it, clinicians must be careful not to invalidate an older patient's experience by seeming to \u2018blame\u2019 their stress on their perspective. Rather, clinicians should explain that our perspective\u2014and how we think about our experience\u2014is one aspect of a stressful situation over which we have control. To illustrate the relationship between thoughts and feelings (cf., the \u2018cognitive model\u2019), clinicians may wish to use examples that are not from the patient's own life experience, particularly if this is the first time the patient is learning this concept. Emotionally-laden experiences can complicate learning the concept that \u2018thoughts can cause feelings\u2019 because patients focus on the content of the thoughts rather than the process of how thoughts in general influence feelings. To teach this concept in the context of social isolation, clinicians could use an exercise such as is depicted in Figure 2\n, which includes a \u2018matching exercise\u2019 whereby patients and clinicians can discuss how different interpretations of being alone in one's home due to social distancing can be associated with different thoughts and therefore different emotional reactions. The implication for patients, of course, is that we all have the power to \u2018talk back to thoughts\u2019 in order to change our emotional experience. Table 1\nincludes three basic cognitive strategies clinicians can use to help patients challenge thoughts that may exacerbate loneliness and increase distress. There are three questions patients can ask themselves to identify possible negative and unhelpful thoughts and ways to challenge (or \u2018talk back to\u2019) those thoughts; some of these strategies are adapted from the strategies to address \u2018negativity bias\u2019 in psychotherapy for depression in later life36 and we have adapted them successfully for use with isolated and lonely older adults.",

            "text": "\nTable 1 also lists another strategy to change thoughts/perspectives\u2014mindfulness-based meditation, which some research has demonstrated may reduce loneliness in older adults.37 In fact, a mobile-health delivered mindfulness training program has also been shown to reduce loneliness and increase social activities among adults reporting above average stress.38 This m-health study suggested that orientation to the present moment (versus rumination about the past or worry about the future) with mindful acceptance was the mechanism that accounted for reduced loneliness and increased daily social contact. Mindfulness training programs commonly teach participants emotion regulation skills\u2014the process by which individuals are aware of, understand, accept, and successfully modify the experience and expression of their emotions.39 Mindfulness training does this by teaching people to use their attention to approach their thoughts and emotions, rather than avoid them, and to do so with acceptance rather than shame or anger.40 Emerging evidence suggests that mindfulness training can also improve interpersonal processes, including social communication, relationship satisfaction, and compassion toward others.41\n,\n42 Compassion, meaning to suffer together, is a multidimensional process of bringing awareness to suffering, with intention to respond to and relieve the suffering, and can be directed toward the self and others.43 Another meditative practice known as loving-kindness, a concept akin to benevolence and goodwill, is a series of exercises designed to cultivate and enhance kindness and compassion toward the self and others. Research on loving-kindness supports evidence of increased positive emotions,44 less psychological distress,45 and increased social connectedness.46 Therefore, introducing patients to mindfulness and loving-kindness training during social distancing restrictions may improve emotion regulation and social functioning among older adults by reducing distress surrounding social isolation and thereby promoting more adaptive coping. During a crisis such as the COVID-19 pandemic, these practices acknowledge a shared suffering that may relieve loneliness and enhance belonging.",

Open-ended, leading questions that help patients identify potential strategies themselves (rather than offering advice) can increase motivation. The case examples below illustrate ways to engage older patients in a brief problem solving exercise to identify new ways they can connect with others in meaningful ways even when they must maintain physical distance, including using technology to connect with friends/family, helping others (e.g., writing letters), and taking actions to remind themselves of a greater connection and purpose.

Upon follow-up two weeks later, Mr. X reports that he feels more confident after learning to change his perspective and reduce his physical anxiety, and that confidence helped to increase his motivation and successfully make his calls. His neighbor reported feeling relieved that Mr. X would spend time reading his children stories on video calls and Mr. X reported feeling pleased that he could do something to help.

He has multiple chronic conditions, including diabetes, heart disease, dementia, and depression. His wife of 45 years still resides in their home and would visit several times a week before the pandemic. His children and grandchildren would also call regularly and visit occasionally. He misses the reassuring presence of his family, but when they visit it reminds him of all the activities they can no longer do together because of his illnesses and disability. When his family is not visiting, Mr. Y spends much of his time watching TV in his room or sleeping. Despite encouragement from family and staff, Mr. Y avoids socializing with other residents or engaging in recreational activities in the nursing home. Recently he is having more difficulty following conversations over the phone and remembering what he wants to say, which makes it harder to connect with loved ones. He is concerned that his dementia is progressing and he longs to return home and spend his days walking his dog, playing with his grandchildren, and going out to eat with his wife. When COVID-19 spreads to a nearby community, a social distancing protocol is put in place at the nursing facility where Mr. Y lives. The protocol includes restrictions on outside visitors, activities outside of the facility, and group activities within the facility. His family attempts to mitigate the impact of the restrictions by calling more frequently, but Mr. Y refuses to take their calls. He starts having difficulty sleeping at night and appears more restless and irritable during the day, sometimes yelling at staff and other residents. Mr. Y did not use the term \u201clonely\u201d to describe his experience, but his thoughts, feelings, and actions demonstrate how loneliness and social isolation may present in long-term care settings. Despite frequent visits and calls from family, Mr. Y's thoughts focused on his loss of emotional connection with loved ones and concerns of further loss due to cognitive decline. He experienced feelings of disconnection, anxiety, and depression. His behaviors included avoidance of social and recreational activities, which increased his social isolation and reinforced his feelings of disconnection. In the context of social distancing due to COVID-19, Mr. Y began to experience heightened social isolation and anxiety that manifested in behavioral problems.",

The social worker gathered additional information about recent changes in his relationships and amount of social activities from his wife. To address Mr. Y's resistance to phone calls, the recreation therapist asked him what was hard about talking on the phone and what most concerned him.

For important issues to consider and practical guidance related to providing telephone psychotherapy, we refer readers to papers by Brenes and colleagues47 and Mozer and colleagues.48 Another useful resource is a guide to implementing Safety Planning with older adults, which includes tips for motivating patients and managing issues such as vision impairment and cognitive impairment when creating a Safety Plan, which is a similar strategy to a Connections Plan.27\n,\n49\n",

            "text": "The cognitive-behavioral framework for social connectedness as presented here illustrates effective applications of patient-centered care by mental health clinicians highlighting the value of knowing patient values and preferences. In times of \u2018social distancing\u2019 access to health care professionals is also limited which, in turn, limits opportunities for practicing the skills and reinforcing the patient's adherence to the \u2018Connections Plan.\u2019 Expanding support for the patient's plan, as described in the case examples which enlisted family involvement, would increase the likelihood of successful implementation. In addition, teaching family members the principles of the cognitive behavioral model would similarly empower them to comfort and reassure the patient during times of distress. For patients with limited family support and who may have been isolated prior to COVID-19, clinicians will have fewer resources to draw upon when creating a Connections Plan. In those instances, clinicians may need to emphasize distress tolerance strategies and helping the patient find ways of feeling safe and comforted without other people. The title, \u2018Connections Plan\u2019 allows for many types of connections\u2014with people, animals, nature, a higher purpose\u2014and all of those connections have value. The importance of connections with people who are not close family and friends \u2013\u2018weak or peripheral ties\u2019 in the social network\u2014should not be discounted, as these connections are strongly linked with more positive mood in older adults.50 Waving to neighbors, writing letters to individuals in nursing homes, or signing up for an intergenerational pen pal program, can be powerful ways to connect and improve mood. For older adults residing in nursing homes, clinicians can emphasize opportunities for connections with staff during daily care routines.",
