            "text": "T h e ne w e ngl a nd jou r na l o f m e dicine S tudies in animals have shown that angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), a membrane-bound aminopeptidase that is abundantly expressed in the lungs, the heart, and other tissues, 1 is used by coronaviruses as a functional receptor for their entrance into the cells. 2, 3 Angiotensin-receptor blockers (ARBs) and ACE inhibitors are considered first-choice drugs in hypertension, heart failure, post-myocardial infarction states, and chronic kidney disease and also increase the expression of ACE2. 4, 5 Given these facts and observations, the hypothesis that their use may modify susceptibility to infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in humans has developed. There is, however, no consensus as to whether the risk and severity of SARS-CoV-2 infection might be increased or reduced with the use of such agents. 1, [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] Current published clinical data are largely limited to small, uncontrolled studies of the demographic and clinical characteristics of patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid- 19) , with little or no information regarding the type of antihypertensive treatment that they were taking at or close to the time of infection. [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] This lack of information has been problematic, given the possibility that blockers of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) may affect the susceptibility to and the severity of Covid-19, an issue that has received much press and may influence patient behavior with respect to taking or discontinuing these agents, despite the advice of a number of professional scientific societies not to discontinue them. [16] [17] [18] [19] To date, reports indicate that withdrawal of RAAS blockers in patients with conditions for which these medications are commonly used leads to a marked increase in the risk of complications and death. [20] [21] [22] The recent Covid-19 epidemic spread to and increased exponentially in Italy earlier than in any other Western country. By far the most severely hit part of Italy is Lombardy, a northern region in which SARS-CoV-2 has infected thousands of patients and has been associated with a high incidence of hospitalization for intensive care and a high mortality. 23 The Regional Health Authority promptly established a population-based registry of patients with a confirmed diagnosis of infection with SARS-CoV-2. Taking advantage of the regional availability of databases of health care use that cover the dispensed essential drugs and services provided to beneficiaries of the Regional Health Service (i.e., virtually all residents), we carried out a case-control investigation to evaluate the association between the use of RAAS blockers and the risk of Covid-19. The analysis was extended to other antihypertensive agents as well as to a large number of other medications. Data were also analyzed according to sex, age, and the severity of Covid-19 (i.e., patients receiving intensive hospital care or who died vs. other patients with the disease).",

At the index date, the mean (\u00b1SD) age of case patients and controls was 68\u00b113 years, and nearly 37% were women (matching variables). Table 1 shows that ARBs and ACE inhibitors were both more frequently prescribed in case patients than in controls. The percentage of patients who received ARBs was 22.2% among case patients and 19.2% among controls (relative difference, 13.3%); the percentage of patients who received ACE inhibitors was 23.9% and 21.4%, respectively (relative difference, 10.5%). Other antihypertensive drugs were also used more in case patients than in controls, the difference usually being larger than for ACE inhibitors and ARBs, particularly for loop diuretics (13.9% vs. 7.8%; relative difference, 43.6%) and mineralocorticoid-receptor antagonists (3.8% vs. 2.4%; relative difference, 37.1%). Use of renin inhibitors (1 case patient) and sacubitril-valsartan (28 case patients) was uncommon, and no further analysis of these treatments was carried out. Case patients also used a combination of antihypertensive drugs more frequently than controls, had a more frequent history of hospitalization for cardiovascular and noncardiovascular diseases, and, according to the CReSc index, had an overall substantially worse clinical profile. Table 2 shows unadjusted estimates of the risk of Covid-19 according to the drugs shown in Table 1 , which suggested a possible effect. However, after multivariable adjustment, neither ARBs nor ACE inhibitors had a significant association with the risk of Covid-19. This was also the case for calcium-channel blockers, beta-blockers, and diuretics. An association with Covid-19 after multivariable adjustment was maintained by loop diuretics and some other non-antihypertensive drugs (insulin, antiplatelet agents, anticoagulants, immunosuppressant drugs, and drugs used for respiratory disease). As compared with patients who did not use antihypertensive drugs during 2019, those to whom antihypertensive agents were dispensed as monotherapy or as a combination of two or more agents appeared to have a greater risk of Covid-19 in the unadjusted (crude) analysis, but after multivariable adjustment, neither monotherapy nor combination therapy showed a significant association with the risk of Covid-19 ( Table 3 ). The multivariable adjusted risk of Covid-19 was increased in patients with previous hospitalizations for cardiovascular or noncardiovascular diseases. It also became progressively greater as the CReSc increased (Table 2) .",

            "text": "In the present study, the use of ARBs and ACE inhibitors was more frequent among patients who were infected with SARS-CoV-2 than among the large number of controls who were matched for age, sex, and place of residence. However, all other major antihypertensive drugs, such as calcium-channel blockers, beta-blockers, and diuretics, were also used more frequently in patients with Covid-19, with differences from controls that were larger than those shown by ARBs and ACE inhibitors. Furthermore, in a multivariable analysis in which data were adjusted for a number of treatment-related covariates and markers of patient clinical status, the use of ARBs or ACE in- T h e ne w e ngl a nd jou r na l o f m e dicine hibitors was not significantly associated with the risk of Covid-19. Finally, there was no statistical evidence of an independent association between the use of a combination of antihypertensive drugs (in which an ACE inhibitor or an ARB is by far the most common component) and the risk of Covid-19. Thus, our results do not provide evidence of an independent relationship between RAAS blockers and the susceptibility to Covid-19 in humans. We found that patients with Covid-19 had a higher baseline prevalence of cardiovascular conditions and diseases (hypertension, coronary heart disease, heart failure, and chronic kidney disease) for which treatment with the medications studied here is often used. Such observations confirm previous observations by Chinese investigators that patients with Covid-19 generally have poorer health than the general population, [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] a conclusion that in the present study is strongly supported by the evidence that patients with Covid-19 were more frequently treated with drugs for many noncardiovascular diseases, had a higher incidence of previous hospitalizations for a variety of causes, and had higher scores for chronic coexisting conditions than controls. 6, 29, 30 The present study provides several additional findings. First, the conclusion that RAAS blockers do not modify susceptibility to Covid-19 applies to both sexes as well as to younger and older persons. Second, our data provide no evidence that, rather than modifying the susceptibility to Covid-19, RAAS blockers alter the evolution of the disease, thereby mainly affecting its severity. In our study, neither ACE inhibitors nor ARBs showed an independent association with Covid-19 in patients with mild-to-moderate disease or in those with severe disease. Third, patients with Covid-19 had much more frequent use of loop diuretics and mineralocorticoid-receptor antagonists than controls, and treatment with loop diuretics was associated with an increased risk of Covid-19 in the multivariable analysis. Rather than suggesting an association (for which there is no mechanistic support), this finding is likely to mean that use of loop diuretics reflects the existence of clinical conditions such as heart failure or advanced renal damage, the severity of which was not appropriately quantified by the available clinical data and scores. These observations from our study may account for the independent relationship that was found between Covid-19 and some noncardiovascular drugs, although more direct investigations with appro- priate experimental designs would be required to clarify this issue. One strength of the study is the large number of case patients as well as the inclusion of a large and well-matched control group, without which interpretation of the collected data would have been difficult. It is also a strength that the Lombardy database included previous hospitalizations and allowed the drugs prescribed to outpatients to be accurately observed, because pharmacists must file outpatient prescriptions to claim reimbursement, and incorrect reports carry legal consequences.",

Drugs that were purchased by the patients (because doctors prescribed them privately, and no records were in the National Health Service system) as well as those dispensed after December 31, 2019, were not captured by our analysis. However, the availability of free antihypertensive agents makes out-of-pocket purchase of these drugs rare, and an exploratory analysis involving patients in whom antihypertensive treatment had been taken regularly or closer to the time of infection did not modify the results. Our results reflect the doses of RAAS blockers used in Ital-ian medical practice but did not allow us to investigate other doses, because this information was not included in the database. It is likely that the control group included some persons with Covid-19, since the general population in Italy was not tested. Unmeasured confounders may have been responsible for our findings. For example, given the hypothesis that RAAS blockers increase the risk of severe clinical manifestations of Covid-19, there may have been preferential dispensation of RAAS blockers to patients with better clinical profiles and a lower perceived likelihood of the development of severe Covid-19. However, there was no evidence that patients who received ARBs or ACE inhibitors had a better clinical profile than those who received other antihypertensive medications.
