This action can lead to negative psychological consequences among college students. For example, college students often experience compounded negative emotions during the school \"closure\" (Van Bortel, 2016) . Some students who find the campus homelike and welcoming harbor intense feelings such as frustration, anxiety, and betrayal. Some may struggle with loneliness and isolation while sheltering in place because of disconnections from friends and partners. For those who receive counselling services on campus, they can no longer access counselling services, which exacerbates their psychological symptoms and increase some students' risk for suicide and substance abuse.",

As more universities transitioning to remote learning after the spring break, some students suffer from poor mental health due to the disruption of academic routine (Agnew et al., 2019) . Many students have to cease their research projects and internships when universities evacuated them from campus.

During the pandemic, the courses of action implemented by universities significantly affect students' mental health and wellbeing.

Although this transition can lead to acute stress among some students due to the lack of time for adjustment, remote learning allows college students to sustain their academic routine which is found to benefit mental health and psychological resilience in the long run (Drake and Whitley, 2014) . In addition, college students may experience less anxiety because remote learning helps them continue to manage their academic routine on a regular basis .",

First, in addition to remote education, student advising should continue and transition to telecommunication (e.g., phone call, online meeting) in order to provide academic support for students. Faculty and staff should consider offering virtual office hours to students, and they need to work together to maintain the connection and help students process and address academic concerns caused by the disruption of the semester. Second, for students whose internships or research projects were affected by the pandemic, internship site supervisors and research advisors should actively engage in helping students seek alternative plans, enabling them to work from home to maximize internship and research experiences. Third, universities should work on innovative methods to support students to move research projects and capstones forward so that students can fulfil graduation requirements; meanwhile, university career centers should switch to virtue services, continuing to facilitate career development for college students.",

University counselling centers can also provide options for students to join online support groups that enable them to share common concerns and receive social support (Rollman et al., 2018) .

College students should tailor coping strategies to meet their specific needs and promote their psychological resilience.
