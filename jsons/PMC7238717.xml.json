The first report of T. gondii in bat species occurred in 1965 by Galuzo and collaborators through parasite isolation in two insectivorous bats, Noctalus noctula and Vespertilio serotinus, in Kazakhstan [8]. Later, in South America, the first report dates from 1969 in Brazil, obtained through the isolation of T. gondii parasite in four bats by bioassay in mice [9]. Toxoplasmosis has been reported in captive flying-foxes (Pteropus conspicillatus and P. scapulatus), being the first symptomatic cases of these diseases in a wild species [10]. The first case of T. gondii isolation and genotyping by sequencing of SAG1 gene occurred in 2013 [4], raising the interest of researchers of detecting T. gondii in bats and trying to describe prevalences, parasite acquisition and infection source, distribution and genetic relationships. Prevalences between 6.1\u201321.6% (Table 1) have been reported, being the most prevalent genotype related to the clonal type [11\u201315].",

So, we took advantage from the creation of the Centro de Estudios de Alta Monta\u00f1a (Center for Highland Studies, CEAM), an initiative in which 27 research groups from different disciplines converge, to start a transdisciplinary research on health surveillance of wild vectors of T. gondii at the Central Andes.

PCR products were purified using the ammonium acetate protocol [20], and later sequenced on an ABI 3130xl Genetic Analyzer (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA), using the BigDye Terminator v3.1 Cycle Sequencing Kit (Applied Biosystems).

We used PCR to detect T. gondii because it is sensitive enough to detect low quantities of parasites and are accessible for routine analyses [14]. Although we have a low number of samples, it could represent a high T. gondii DNA percentage in bats by PCR in contrast different studies realized until today (Table 1). The positive sample was confirmed to be from T. gondii DNA through sequencing and alignment (Fig. 2) and blast with our positive control (B1 sequence from T. gondii DNA of RH strain) and a reference sequence reported in GenBank with accession number AF179871 [19]. The few differences presented in alignment should be interpreted with precaution because it is not necessarily a different genotype or strain from T. gondii. To obtain the circulation of specific genotypes, one needs multi-locus analysis, using different genes like ROP18 [22], with a good amount and quality of DNA [16].",

It is possible that the food resource acted as the source of parasite acquisition, which could had been in contact with contaminated water, and the low dietary selectivity of C. brevicauda [27] reinforces this possibility. Another possibility can be given by a direct contact with contaminated water. Bats could drink frequently from ponds and other water sources, which could be potentially contaminated with T. gondii oocysts. Some reports in Quind\u00edo have confirmed the presence of DNA T. gondii in water samples before plants treatment, with a frequency of 76,9% (10/13) [16]. T. gondii infection in insectivorous and frugivorous bats also suggests that the caves where bats live are contaminated with T. gondii oocysts [28].",

Furthermore, some bat species are considered staples in the diet of several species of wild felids, as well as domestic cats, which can disseminate oocysts into the environment. Previous studies have shown that the rate of T. gondii infection in felids is related to predator\u2013prey relationships, and therefore dependent on the availability prey species [32]. Detailed understanding of how a virus, parasite or bacteria can infect different species, including humans, so productively will help in the prevention of future zoonotic events.",
