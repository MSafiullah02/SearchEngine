As of April 24, 2016, a total of 1,724 cases with 623 deaths (36.1% mortality) were reported to the World Health Organization. Another human pathogenic CoV, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV), caused more than 8,000 human infections in 2002\u20132003, with a 10% mortality rate (Peiris et al., 2004). The presence of SARS-like CoV and other CoVs in zoonotic populations as well as the ongoing MERS epidemic make it likely that additional CoV outbreaks will emerge (Ge et al., 2013). These possibilities indicate the need for development of vaccines that would be effective against many strains of CoVs.",

Antibody responses in patients previously infected with respiratory viruses, including SARS-CoV and influenza A virus (IAV), tend to be short lived (Channappanavar et al., 2014, Wilkinson et al., 2012). On the other hand, T cell responses often target highly conserved internal proteins and are long lived. SARS-CoV-specific memory T cells but not B cells could be detected 6 years after infection in SARS survivors (Tang et al., 2011). Further, IAV-specific memory CD4+ T cell numbers correlated with protection against the influenza strain H1N1 infection during the 2009 epidemic (Wilkinson et al., 2012).",

However, much less is known about how these cells provide protection and whether localization of these cells at specific sites within tissue is critical (Turner and Farber, 2014). In the respiratory tract, memory CD4+ T cells include cells in the airway and parenchyma and cells adhering to the pulmonary vasculature. Airway memory CD4+ T cells are the first cells to encounter viral antigen during respiratory infections, suggesting a key role in protection. However, it is not clear whether airway and parenchymal cells differentially mediate protection during respiratory infections.",

The epitope used was conserved in MERS-CoV, was presented by human leukocyte antigen (HLA) DR2 and DR3 molecules, and mediated cross protection between SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV and related bat CoV.

            "text": "Previously, we identified a dominant CD4+ T cell epitope in the nucleocapsid (N) protein of SARS-CoV (N353) recognized in BALB/c (H-2d) mice; no CD8+ T cell epitopes are present in this protein (Zhao et al., 2010). This region of N is also targeted by CD4+ T cells from SARS convalescent patients (Oh et al., 2011, Peng et al., 2006). We initially evaluated whether intranasal (i.n.) immunization, which generates local CD4+ T cell responses, or footpad vaccination, which generates a systemic T cell response, resulted in differences in protection against challenge with mouse-adapted SARS-CoV (Roberts et al., 2007). For this purpose, we vaccinated BALB/c mice twice at 6\u20137 week intervals with VRP-SARS-N or a control VRP expressing green fluorescent protein (VRP-GFP) i.n. or subcutaneously (s.c.) prior to challenge. VRPs are non-replicating vaccine vectors that preferentially infect human and mouse dendritic cells and serve as self-adjuvants (Moran et al., 2005, Tonkin et al., 2012). Only i.n. inoculation with VRP-SARS-N induced an N-specific CD4+ T cell response in the lungs and airways, which was increased by i.n. VRP-SARS-N boosting (Figure 1\nA). In contrast, s.c. inoculation resulted in a CD4+ T cell response primarily in the spleen with virtually no N-specific T cells identified in the lungs or airway. Subcutaneous boosting increased the numbers of virus-specific cells in the spleen but not in respiratory tissue. As expected, VRP-SARS-N administration resulted in accumulation of N-expressing DCs and, consequently, more N-specific CD4+ T cells in the draining mediastinal lymph nodes (MLNs; i.n. immunization) and popliteal lymph nodes (PLNs; s.c. immunization) (Figure S1). Protection from lethal disease was nearly complete after i.n. but not s.c. administration of VRP-SARS-N, demonstrating the importance of the route of vaccination (Figure 1B). Protection was observed against challenge with doses ranging from 100 to 10,000 PFUs of SARS-CoV (Figure 1C). By days 4\u20136 after challenge, SARS-CoV-infected VRP-GFP-immunized mice develop severe edema with a relative paucity of infiltrating cells whereas intranasal VRP-SARS-N-immunized mice displayed prominent peribronchiolar and perivascular infiltration and minimal amounts of edema in the lungs. Subcutaneous immunization with VRP-SARS-N did not protect against edema formation (Figure 1D). Consistent with these results, intranasal VRP-SARS-N immunization enhanced the kinetics of virus clearance (Figure 1E). Next we assessed the role of memory CD4+ T cells in protection by depleting them systemically 2 days prior to challenge. This abrogated protection (Figures 1F and S2A), indicating that memory CD4+ T cells might be important for protection.",

These mice were not protected against SARS-CoV challenge (Figure 1F) and developed histological changes similar to those observed in VRP-GFP-immunized mice (Figure 1G). N-specific CD4+ T cell numbers gradually decreased after vaccination (Figure 1H) but still mediated partial protection after challenge at 41 weeks after boosting (Figure 1I). CD4+ T cells provide helper function for antibody production, but unlike sera from VRP-SARS-S, which induced neutralizing antibody, sera from VRP-SARS-N-immunized mice were not protective upon transfer to naive mice prior to challenge (Figure 1J). Protection was also observed in mice immunized with another vaccine, recombinant vaccinia virus expressing the N protein (rVV-SARS-N) (Figure 1K). Because the CD4+ T cell response was more robust in VRP- compared to rVV-immunized mice (data not shown), we used VRP-SARS-N for the remainder of the subsequent experiments. 12-month-old mice are very susceptible to SARS-CoV (Zhao et al., 2011); however, VRP-SARS-N vaccination at 12 months and analysis at 15 months of age resulted in protection against challenge, demonstrating efficacy even in this highly vulnerable population (Figure 1L). Together, these results indicate that intranasal but not subcutaneous immunization induced a protective CD4+ T cell immune response.",

To discriminate between cells localized to the airway versus those in the parenchyma and vasculature, we used a modification of a previously described method (Anderson et al., 2012) to simultaneously label cells by i.v. and i.n. administration of CD90.2 and CD45 antibodies, respectively, 5\u20137 weeks after boosting. Consistent with CD8+ T cell studies, a large proportion of CD4+ T cells in the respiratory tract were localized in the vasculature (Figure 2\nA; Anderson et al., 2012). Additionally, the vast majority of cells in the airway were not labeled by i.v. antibody administration, indicating their anatomic compartmentalization (Figure 2A). N353-specific CD4+ T cells comprised a higher percentage of cells in the airway compared to the parenchymal or vascular populations, although the greatest number of SARS-CoV-specific cells were present in the vasculature (Figure 2B). Airway, parenchymal, and vascular N353 memory CD4+ T cells differed phenotypically. Surface molecules associated with memory (CD127 and CD27) and trafficking (CD11a) were expressed at lower levels on airway cells compared to cells in the parenchyma or vasculature. Unlike memory CD8+ T cells localized in tissues, airway memory CD4+ T cells did not express CD69, CD103, and Ly6C although CD69 was expressed after priming (data not shown). Parenchymal cells expressed CD103 and Ly6C (Figure 2C; Mueller et al., 2013).",

            "text": "Next, we examined whether cells in the airway, which first encounter viral antigen, were critical for mediating protection after challenge. After SARS-CoV challenge, the percentage of N-specific CD4+ T cells was much higher in the airway and the number of N353 CD4+ T cells at this site increased substantially compared to those in the parenchyma and vasculature (Figure 2D). Also, airway N353 CD4+ T cells expressed IFN-\u03b3 at higher levels on a per cell basis compared to the parenchyma and vasculature (Figures 2D and 2E). Airway cells had superior effector function, indicated by the ability to express more than one cytokine (TNF, IL-10, IL-2) (Figure 2E). In addition, these multi-functional CD4+ T cells were present at a higher frequency in the airway compared to parenchyma and vasculature (Figure 2F) and exhibited greater functional avidity (Figure 2G). To determine whether the increase in N353 CD4+ T cells reflected local proliferation or recruitment, infected mice were treated with FTY720 to prevent T cell egress from lymphoid tissue and then treated at day 4 p.i. with BrdU for 4 hr (Figure S3). FTY720 treatment decreased the numbers of N-specific CD4+ T cells in the respiratory tract and the remaining cells showed evidence of BrdU incorporation, indicating roles for both recruitment and proliferation in augmentation of N353 CD4+ T cells. These results indicate that memory CD4+ T cells in the airway were phenotypically and functionally different from those in the parenchyma and vasculature, were maintained by both local proliferation and recruitment, and were potentially most important for protection.",

            "text": "To address more explicitly the role of airway cells in protection, we depleted CD4+ T cells in the airways, but not the parenchyma or vasculature, by i.n. administration of 10 \u03bcg anti-CD4+ T cell antibody prior to challenge (Figure 3\nA). Previous reports indicated a key role for resident memory T (Trm) cells (T cells that are present at sites of prior infection without recirculation) in protection against pathogen challenge (Masopust and Picker, 2012, Mueller et al., 2013, Turner and Farber, 2014) and CD4+ Trm cells have been identified in the context of influenza A virus infection (Teijaro et al., 2011). However, these airway N353 cells did not fit the classic definition of resident memory T cells because they were replenished by 4 weeks after depletion (Figure 3B), similar to airway memory IAV-specific CD8+ T cells (Sl\u00fctter et al., 2013). Depletion decreased survival to approximately 35%, demonstrating the key role that airway memory CD4+ T cells have in protection (Figure 3C). To probe the mechanism of action of these cells, we initially focused on type I interferon (IFN-I) expression because IFN-I orchestrates a protective response at early times p.i. IFN-\u03b1, IFN-\u03b2, and IFN-\u03bb were not upregulated after VRP-SARS-N immunization. In contrast, higher IFN-\u03b3 mRNA levels were detected in the lungs of VRP-SARS-N-immunized mice by day 1 p.i. (Figures 3D and 3E). This cytokine was largely produced by airway CD4+ T cells since local and systemic depletion of these cells was equally efficient in reducing IFN-\u03b3 expression in the lung (Figure 3E). Expression of other cytokines, such as TNF, IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, and IL-12, was not upregulated by prior VRP-SARS-N vaccination (Figure S4A). IFN-\u03b3 expression by airway CD4+ T cells was confirmed using an in vivo cytokine expression assay, in which mice were treated with Brefeldin A (BFA) for 6 hr prior to direct ex vivo analysis without additional stimulation (Figure 3F; Hufford et al., 2011). Expression of IFN-\u03b3 by CD4+ T cells resulted in the upregulation of several IFN-related genes in SARS-CoV-challenged, VRP-SARS-N-vaccinated mice, including STAT-1, PKR, and OAS-1, which are important for CoV clearance (Figure S4B; Frieman et al., 2010, Wang et al., 2009, Zhao et al., 2012). Neutralization of IFN-\u03b3 in the airway by i.n. administration prior to infection and every 2 days thereafter abrogated upregulation of these genes (Figure 3G).",

            "text": "Although airway memory CD4+ T cells and IFN-\u03b3 activated the innate immune response, virus clearance was also accelerated at late times p.i. (Figures 1E and 3J). This suggested that these cells had an additional role in enhancing the adaptive immune response, most likely the virus-specific CD8+ T cell response, critical for SARS-CoV clearance (Channappanavar et al., 2014, Zhao et al., 2010). To generate robust CD8+ T cell responses, respiratory dendritic cells (rDCs) must migrate to MLNs and prime naive CD8+ T cells (Zhao et al., 2011). We next assessed whether airway memory CD4+ T cells participated in these processes. In a role not previously reported, IFN-\u03b3, largely expressed by these airway CD4+ T cells, was critical for optimal rDC migration, as measured by increased frequency and number of lung-derived carboxyfluorescein succinimidyl ester (CFSE)-labeled rDCs in the MLN compared to VRP-GFP-immunized mice (Figure 4\nA). Administration of anti-CD4 or anti-IFN-\u03b3 antibody i.n. significantly reduced rDC migration to the MLNs, accompanied by decreased accumulation of total lymph node cells (Figure 4B). These rDCs in MLNs were mature and optimized for antigen presentation as shown by expression of co-stimulatory molecules such as CD40, CD80, and CD86. rDC migration to the MLN requires CCR7 expression and CCR7 was also upregulated on migratory rDCs in the MLNs (Figure 4C). IFN-\u03b3 augmented CCR7 expression since i.n. IFN-\u03b3 treatment resulted in a 10-fold increase in the frequency of lung CCR7+ rDCs (Figure 4D). Together, these results established that airway memory CD4+ T cells and IFN-\u03b3 secreted by these cells, in addition to activating the innate immune response, enhanced rDC migration to the MLN.",

Accumulation of cells in the lung requires T cell migration to this site, a process that is chemokine dependent. Virus-specific CD8+ T cells expressed chemokine receptor CXCR3 but not CCR4 and CCR5 (Figure 5G), suggesting that effector CD8+ T cell entry into the infected lung was dependent upon the CXCR3 pathway. In support of this, CXCR3 ligands CXCL9, CXCL10, and CXCL11 were expressed in the infected lungs in an airway CD4+ T-cell- and IFN-\u03b3-dependent manner (Figures 5H and S4C). We directly confirmed the importance of CXCR3 in CD8+ T cell accumulation in the lungs by systemic blockade of CXCR3 at days 3 and 5 p.i. This treatment decreased the frequency and numbers of epitope S366-specific CD8+ T cells in the lungs. Together these results showed that airway memory CD4+ T cells orchestrated both rDC migration to the MLNs and virus-specific CD8+ T cell trafficking to the lungs, enhancing clinical outcomes.",

First, we examined N proteins from several alpha and beta coronaviruses for a SARS-N353 epitope-like sequence. Epitope SARS-N353 was present in all SARS-like CoVs isolated from civet cats, Chinese ferret badgers, and bats. Bats are the reservoir for SARS-CoV and civet cats and Chinese ferret badgers served as intermediate hosts during the 2002\u20132003 pandemic (Chinese SARS Molecular Epidemiology Consortium, 2004, Ge et al., 2013, Li et al., 2005). In addition, similar sequences were detected in MERS-CoV and bat CoV HKU4, HKU5, and HKU9 as well as more distantly related alpha coronaviruses (Figure 6\nA). To determine whether MERS-N350 was recognized in infected mice, we challenged mice expressing the virus receptor, hDPP4 (human dipeptidyl peptidase 4) (Zhao et al., 2014) with MERS-CoV. MERS-N350-specific CD4+ T cells were detected in infected BALB/c mice (Figure 6B). Next, mice were immunized with VRP-MERS-N, resulting in a robust airway CD4+ T cell response that could be boosted by a second VRP-MERS-N immunization (Figure 6C). Consistent with results obtained after VRP-SARS N vaccination, these cells exhibited superior effector function, were multifunctional (Figure S7), and accelerated virus clearance upon challenge (Figure 6D). MERS-CoV N, unlike SARS-CoV N protein, encodes a weak CD8+ T cell epitope in BALB/c mice (N214, LYLDLLNRL) (Zhao et al., 2014), which might have contributed to accelerated virus clearance. However, the contribution made by these cells was relatively minor; depletion of airway CD4+ T cells or blockade of airway IFN-\u03b3 significantly decreased the rate of virus clearance (Figure 6E).",

To determine whether the SARS-N353 or MERS-N350 epitope was potentially recognized in humans, we immunized mice transgenic for human HLA class II DR2 or DR3 antigen with N peptides and analyzed mice for peptide-specific CD4+ T cell responses. As shown in Figure 6F, SARS-N353 could be presented by both DR2 and DR3, whereas MERS-N350 was successfully presented by DR2. HLA-DR2 and HLA-DR3 transgenic mice are on a C57BL/10 (H-2b) background. Young SARS-CoV-infected mice on this background do not develop clinical disease (Frieman et al., 2010, Zhao et al., 2011), so we assessed the effect of immunization by measuring the kinetics of virus clearance. Immunization with VRP-SARS-N or VRP-MERS-N enhanced the kinetics of virus clearance from these HLA transgenic mice after challenge with SARS-CoV or MERS-CoV (Figure 6G), indicating that these constructs could be potential vaccine candidates in human populations. No H-2b-restricted CD8+ T cell epitopes are present in the N protein of either MERS-CoV or SARS-CoV (Zhao et al., 2010, Zhao et al., 2014) so that vaccination induced solely a virus-specific CD4+ T cell response.",

Having identified closely related analogs to SARS-N353 in other coronaviruses (Figure 6A), we next asked whether these epitopes induced cross-reactive memory CD4+ T cells in the airway. Immunization with VRP-MERS-N induced CD4+ T cells that responded to many of the peptides listed in Figure 6A (Figure 7\nA), whereas VRP-SARS-N immunization induced a small cross-reactive response (<1.0%, data not shown). Next, we assessed whether these VRP-MERS-N-induced cross-reactive memory CD4+ T cells were protective against SARS-CoV challenge. After VRP-MERS-N immunization and SARS-CoV challenge, virus-specific airway CD4+ T cells were detected after stimulation with either SARS-N353 or MERS-N350 peptides; these cells were not present in infected mice previously immunized with VRP-GFP (Figure 7B). VRP-MERS-N vaccination was partly protective against low-dose SARS-CoV challenge (Figure 7C). This limited protection was most likely because the numbers of cross-reactive N-specific CD4+ T cells in the airway were approximately 10-fold lower than detected after VRP-SARS-N immunization (compare Figures 1A and 7B). As we observed strong cross-reactivity between the MERS-CoV and HKU4 and HKU5 epitopes, we examined whether vaccination with VRP-HKU4-N would enhance MERS-CoV clearance. Vaccination with VRP-HKU4-N induced cross-reactive CD4+ T cell responses against MERS-CoV N and HKU5 N (Figure 7D). After challenge with MERS-CoV, we detected a robust CD4+ T cell response, with more cells responding to MERS-N350 than to HKU4-N351 (Figure 7E). VRP-HKU4-N vaccination resulted in enhanced MERS-CoV clearance, with kinetics very similar to that observed after VRP-MERS-N vaccination (compare Figures 6D and 7F). Collectively, these results indicate that a conserved epitope recognized by airway memory CD4+ T cells in SARS-CoV- and MERS-CoV-infected mice induced a cross-reactive, protective immune response.",

Here we showed that respiratory tract memory CD4+ T cells provided protection against challenge with SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. Using specific depletion of CD4+ T cells by i.n. administration of antibody, we demonstrated that cells localized to the airway were critical for protection. Airway CoV-specific CD4+ T cells provided the first line of defense against challenge, enhancing the immune response at early and late times after infection. More rapid virus clearance occurred within 1\u20132 days after challenge, demonstrating the role of airway memory CD4+ T cells in enhancing the innate immune response. At 6\u20137 days p.i., virus clearance was again accelerated because these cells augmented rDC migration to MLNs and subsequent virus-specific CD8+ T cell priming and mobilization to the infected lungs in a CXCR3-dependent manner. All of these effects were dependent upon airway CD4+ T-cell-derived IFN-\u03b3.",

Protection occurs via IFN-\u03b3 expression and enhancement of CD8+ T cell and antibody responses, similar to our findings (McKinstry et al., 2012). In another study, memory CD4+ T cells were identified in the lungs of IAV-infected mice and shown to be lung-resident cells using a parabiosis model. After transfer to naive mice, these lung-derived cells preferentially migrated to the lungs and mediated protection upon subsequent IAV challenge (Teijaro et al., 2011). IAV-specific memory CD4+ T cells also were identified in normal-appearing human lungs (Purwar et al., 2011). Although both of these studies refer to these cells as lung CD4+ Trm cells, our results suggest that this terminology must be used carefully. We showed that there were three populations of cells in the lungs, and at least memory CD4+ T cells in the airways were replenished after a few weeks. Memory CD4+ T cells have specific advantages compared to memory CD8+ T cells because they are longer lived in some settings and are more polyclonal (Lees and Farber, 2010, Stockinger et al., 2006). Consistent with this, we observed that the SARS-N353-specific CD4+ T cell response in the airway demonstrated long-term protection: mice immunized with VRP-SARS-N at 6 weeks of age and challenged 41 weeks after boosting exhibited 30% survival whereas age-matched controls all succumbed to the infection. Further, CD4+ T cell epitopes are less prone to immune escape than are CD8+ T cell epitopes, partly because CD4+ T cells largely function via CD8+ T cell recruitment and other indirect mechanisms whereas virus-specific CD8+ T cells directly target infected cells. Consequently, CD4+ T cell epitope escape has only rarely been described (Harcourt et al., 1998).",

Second, CD11a, important for retention in tissues, was lower on airway CD4+ T cells, indicating a lack of requirement for tissue adherence and consistent with localization in the airway. Third, airway CD4+ T cells did not express CD103, CD69, and Ly6C, markers for CD8+ Trm cells, unlike parenchymal cells, which resembled CD8+ Trm cells more closely. Finally, airway CD4+ T cells were more multifunctional than cells in the parenchyma and vascular, with a higher percentage of cells producing multiple cytokines and with higher cytokine production on a per cell basis.

The combination of memory CD4+ T-cell-inducing vaccines with those able to elicit strong neutralizing antibody responses and memory CD8+ T cells would be predicted to result in long-lasting, broad protection against several CoVs. This strategy might also be useful in the context of other pathogenic respiratory viruses.",
