Using highly purified human na\u00efve B cells it was shown that optimal expansion, differentiation, and class switch requires, in addition to BCR triggering and T cell help, a third signal that can be delivered by TLR agonists or by cytokines produced by activated dendritic cells [4]. These findings are consistent with mouse experiments that addressed the requirements for TLR expression on B cells in certain types of T-dependent responses [5, 6].",

The longevity of plasma cells is determined by extrinsic factors that are collectively defined as \u2018survival niches\u2019 [13]. In contrast to adult vaccination, vaccination in early childhood does not lead to sustained serum antibody levels [8]. In a mouse model this failure has been attributed to a defective capacity of bone marrow stromal cells to produce APRIL, which is required for the maintenance of long-lived plasma cells [14]. A better definition of the mechanisms that control plasma cell survival will be required in order to improve vaccination in early life.",

These CD27-memory B cells have been mistakenly taken as na\u00efve cells, a fact that has generated some confusion in the field. The ABCB1 transporter is expressed exclusively on human mature naive B cells but not on immature, activated or memory B cells, including those lacking CD27 [20].

These cells have an \u2018exhausted\u2019 phenotype since they express multiple inhibitory receptors and proliferate poorly when stimulated in vitro. Strikingly, HIV-specific responses were enriched in these exhausted B cells, whereas influenza-specific responses were enriched in functional memory B cells. These data suggest that HIV-associated exhaustion of B cells may contribute to poor antibody responses against HIV in infected individuals [30].

These cells have been initially considered to be IgM memory B cells, but subsequent studies indicate that they represent a distinct population related to mouse marginal zone (MZ) B cells [34\u2022\u2022]. Although they share many properties with their mouse counterpart, such as the response to bacterial polysaccharides, human MZ B cells display striking differences, such as the presence of somatic mutations and the capacity to recirculate. Human MZ B cells develop progressively over the first two years of life explaining the unresponsiveness of infants to polysaccharide vaccines [7]. Furthermore during this time their BCR repertoire undergoes somatic diversification that occurs in the absence of antigen-driven responses. This is clearly demonstrated by the finding that developing MZ B cells have a polyclonal profile of CDR3 spectratyping as opposed to bona fide memory B cells, which display an oligoclonal profile [35\u2022\u2022]. There is relatively little information on the dynamics of MZ B cell responses. However, in one case analyzed, it was shown that a particular clonotype was detectable at low frequency in the blood before antigenic challenge and was already mutated at this stage. Following vaccination with a polysaccharide vaccine this clone was found expanded in IgM and IgG plasma cells in the spleen and was still detected in blood four weeks later [36]. MZ B cells are clearly distinct from bona fide IgM memory B cells generated through T-dependent responses that are IgMhiIgD-CD27+ and are found in peripheral blood of normal individuals and at low frequency (1% of total B cells) and at higher frequency in AID-deficient patients [36].",

This diversification occurs through postrearrangement processes such as gene conversion or somatic hypermutation. There is evidence that this process is T cell-independent, as shown by the presence of mutated MZ B cells in patients lacking CD40 or CD40L [36] as well as by the analysis of Rag\u2212/\u2212 gc\u2212/\u2212 nude mice reconstituted with human hematopoietic stem cells [38]. In addition it has been recently shown that, unlike na\u00efve B cells, human CD24hi CD38hi transitional B cells respond to CpG and differentiate into MZ-like B cells [39]. These findings suggest the possibility that BCR diversification might be initiated in transitional B cells by bacterial DNA or other microbial products present at mucosal surfaces. It is striking that humans have selected mutated antibodies for their protection against encapsulated bacteria [40]. A possible reason may be that mutated antibodies produced by human MZ B cells are superior to natural non-mutated polyreactive IgM antibodies [41].",

The plasma cell burst coincides with a sharp increase in serum antibodies that reaches plateau levels on day 10, indicating that the vast majority of the plasma cells generated are short-lived. A recent study shows that, in contrast to a widely held belief, the plasma cells generated in response to a new influenza vaccine have higher affinity for the vaccine than for a previously encountered virus, suggesting that in humans the original antigenic sin does not compromise the immediate response to influenza vaccination [46\u2022].",

This finding is consistent with previous reports showing that highly specific anti-HIV antibodies can also be polyreactive [52].

It can be achieved via different mechanisms that range from the rigid recognition of identical residues displayed by different ligands, to a conformational diversity of the antibody allowing binding to structurally distinct ligands, to the differential positioning of ligands in different subsites of the paratope [53]. Recently a therapeutic monoclonal antibody was engineered to express two specificities against HER2 and VEGF [54\u2022\u2022]. By screening a randomized library from an HER-2-specific antibody the authors were able to select several variant clones that bound VEGF. While most of these clones had lost reactivity against HER2, others retained such reactivity thus behaving as \u2018two-in-one\u2019 antibody.

The efficiency of B cell depletion was shown to be dependent on a number of factors including the microenvironment, the extent of B cells recirculation, the expression of Fc receptors, and complement regulatory proteins such as CD59. Consistent with these animal data, patients that express the high affinity allele of Fc\u03b3RIIIa (V158) have a better prognostic outcome to Rituximab treatment as compared to patients that express only the low affinity allele (F158) [58, 59]. Combinatorial therapies have been considered to increase the effect of anti-CD20 such as fresh plasma or antibodies to CD59. In addition new anti-CD20 antibodies are developed with enhanced capacity to induce ADCC or to fix complement [60].",

However, immunoablation using antithymocyte serum followed by autologous stem cell transplantation has been shown to effectively deplete long-lived plasma cells and induce long-term remission in patients with severe autoimmune diseases [61]. Owing to the high rate of protein synthesis and the limited proteolytic capacity, plasma cells are hypersensitive to proteasome inhibitors such as Bortezomib [62, 63]. This drug, which is now approved for the treatment of multiple myeloma, eliminates both short-lived and long-lived autoreactive plasma cells by the activation of the terminal unfolded protein response.",

Two recent studies [64, 65] examined plasma cell levels in mice treated with anti-CD20 antibodies and concluded that the long-lived plasma cell pool is maintained despite mature and memory B cell depletion, at least over a period of 16 weeks. Interestingly, in one of these studies, the authors were able to deplete bone marrow plasma cells by in vivo administration of antibodies to LFA-1 and VLA4. They found that in these conditions memory B cells were required for the repopulation of bone marrow plasma cells [64]. The ability of memory B cells to reconstitute the bone marrow plasma cell pool would be consistent with a contribution of memory B cells to the homeostasis of plasma cells and serum antibody level.",

Much of the impetus for these studies derives from the need to develop antibodies that effectively neutralize human pathogens. Broadly neutralizing antibodies could be used not only as therapeutics, but also as tools to design vaccines capable of eliciting a broadly neutralizing response [66\u2022]. An improved method of EBV immortalization has been used to isolate from memory B cells of infected patients monoclonal antibodies that potently and broadly neutralize SARS coronavirus [67\u2022] and H5N1 avian influenza virus [68]. An advantage of this method is that the antibodies produced by immortalized B cells can be directly tested using functional assays such as viral neutralization and therefore a precise knowledge of the antigenic target is not required. Another advantage relates to the longevity of memory B cells. This is best exemplified by the isolation from survivors of the 1918 influenza pandemic of monoclonal antibodies that potently neutralize the 1918 H1N1 influenza virus [69].",

In HIV-1-infected donors, the B cell memory repertoire specific for gp140 was composed of up to 50 independent clones expressing high affinity antibodies of different epitope specificity. Surprisingly, although the donors had broadly neutralizing serum antibodies, none of the antibodies isolated had such a property [70\u2022]. This finding raises the possibility that the breadth of neutralization depends from a large number of antibodies, each targeting only a few HIV variants. Alternatively, it is possible that the \u2018bait\u2019 used was not suitable to select B cells of broad specificities or that the repertoire of memory B cells might differ from that of plasma cells which produce serum antibodies.",

This approach led to the isolation of antibodies to Rh blood group antigen, tetanus toxoid, and influenza virus [46\u2022, 71, 72]. Considering that plasma cells and memory B cells have different kinetics, it will be interesting to establish whether the antibodies isolated from these sources may have different properties in terms of load of somatic mutations and fine specificity. In the mouse it has been shown that plasma cells emerge from germinal centers after memory B cells and have higher levels of somatic mutations [73].",
