As key members of interprofessional geriatric teams, social workers are uniquely positioned to intervene in addressing social isolation by developing and testing interventions1.

As noted in an earlier editorial (5) , there are myriad negative physical and mental health outcomes that are linked to the older adult experiencing loneliness and/or social isolation.

With sheltering-in-place and stay-at-home orders, many older adults lost usual ways to connect with support networks and health and social service providers and are spending increased time alone.

As two Italian geriatricians noted in April, 2020, we have a \"unique opportunity for improvement\" (12) .

Social workers and other health professionals are learning from this crisis: \u2022 Assessing loneliness and social isolation-Because providers seldom ask about these experiences, having tools that can be easily and quickly administered to determine if the older adult is lonely or socially isolated is critical. Training for practitioners in assessing these issues is minimal at best (13) . There are several available tools; we have developed a rapid tool, the ALONE scale (table 1) whose psychometric validation is underway. Assessing the risk factors previously noted should be included as part of the ongoing assessment of older adults' needs. \u2022 Developing and adapting evidence-based interventions to address loneliness and social isolation-Lubben and colleagues (1) Our interprofessional Geriatric Workforce Enhancement Program (GWEP) team has adapted one such evidence-based group intervention. Circle of Friends\u00a9 is a group intervention developed at Helsinki University designed to address loneliness and social isolation via weekly sessions over three months that incorporate art and inspiring activities, exercise/health content, and therapeutic writing (14) (15) (16) .

Social workers have organized compassionate visits for persons at the end-oflife. Providing daily updates on residents to family members has been a mainstay of social workers' routines.

Once the crisis has passed, we can evaluate our responses and identify those strategies that worked and can become a part of our practice approaches. For example, we moved forward to develop a telehealth delivery platform to facilitate Circle of Friends for use during the crisis and beyond. With social workers embracing the use of technology as a viable service-delivery option, traditional interventions can similarly be offered (e.g., exercise, dementia care, and caregiver support) as well as more innovative options (e.g., interactive photo sharing, support and learning assistants, online-based websites for pairing runners and cooks with isolated older adults, and multi-party games) (19) . In addition, there will be a need to learn to identify Post Traumatic Stress Disorder. Symptoms such as fear, sleeping disturbances, poor concentration and flash backs. In the future, we may see more social worker interactions carried out through digital connections along with increasing use of \"Alexa\" and a variety of health robots to help alleviate loneliness. \u2022 Continuing to combat ageism-now that the majority of our society has experienced loneliness and social isolation, there is better understanding of the need to not perpetuate it in a post-pandemic world, particularly with older adults.

Lastly, we must consider the needs that will arise in the post-pandemic era for our patients and their families who may experience increased depression, anxiety, and financial challenges. As we have helped them to transition into the world created by the COVID-19 crisis, we can be there to help them transition into the post-COVID-19 world.
