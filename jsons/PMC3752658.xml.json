The MyD88 protein includes an N\u2010terminal \u201cdeath domain\u201d (DD) and a C\u2010terminal Toll\u2010interleukin receptor (TIR) domain, similar to the intracellular domains of TLRs and members of the IL\u20101R superfamily, collectively referred to as TIR receptors 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. Human IRAK4 maps to chromosome 12q12 and contains 13 exons. The full\u2010length cDNA for human IRAK\u20104 encodes 460 amino acids, forming a 52 kDa protein.

These patients all carried either homozygous or compound heterozygous mutations of the IRAK4 or MYD88 gene that lead to nonfunctional proteins 29, 30. Given these small numbers of patients, only brief preliminary conclusions could be made concerning the infectious phenotype associated with the absence of MyD88\u2010IRAK\u20104\u2010dependent signaling. The cumulative evidence from the large number of case reports since published and from the comprehensive description of a cohort of 76 patients (52 with IRAK\u20104 deficiency and 24 with MyD88 deficiency) allow firmer conclusions about the infectious phenotype in the absence of MyD88\u2010IRAK\u20104\u2010dependent signaling to be drawn 31, 114, 115, 116, 117, 118, 119, 120, 121, 122, 123, 124, 125, 126, 127, 128, 129. There are also an additional five patients with IRAK\u20104 deficiency and two patients with MyD88 deficiency for whom no data have yet been published. The infectious pheno\u2010type of MyD88\u2010 and IRAK\u20104\u2010deficient patients is dominated by invasive pyogenic infections. The most frequent of such infections are meningitis, sepsis, arthritis, and osteomyelitis, and the principal bacteria isolated in cases of invasive infection are S. pneumoniae, S. aureus, and Pseudmomonas aeruginosa (for a list of all the pathogens isolated from Myd88\u2010 and IRAK\u20104\u2010deficient patients, see Table 3). These patients also typically suffer from deep tissue infections of the upper respiratory tract, such as severe tonsillitis due to P. aeruginosa in particular, and superficial skin infections, mostly caused by S. aureus.",

No patients with these deficiencies have yet been identified in the Indian subcontinent, in South America or in China. Patients with MyD88\u2010 or IRAK\u20104\u2010deficiencies in these areas of the world might perhaps present a higher frequency of infections with Gram\u2010negative bacteria, as suggested by case reports of invasive infection with Shigella spp. during endemic diarrhea outbreaks 119, 127. However, by contrast to this uncertainty concerning positive associations about the infectious phenotype, we can highlight much more emphatically the negative associations drawn concerning the roles of MyD88 and IRAK\u20104 in host anti\u2010pathogen defense. Most, if not all, of the 76 patients identified to date have been exposed to mycobacteria, viruses, Toxoplasma, Pneumocystis, and other fungi, but none of these pathogens caused invasive infection.

The 15 surviving patients are currently four, seven, 11, 14, and 20 years old. Fifty\u2010two patients with IRAK\u20104 deficiency have been identified 31. Twenty\u2010one of these patients have died since identification: 10 in infancy and 11 in early childhood. The youngest of these 19 patients was 2 months old, and the oldest was 7 years old, at the time of death; the latter being patient P23 from the large cohort published in 2010 31 who recently died of S. pneumoniae meningitis (unpublished observation). The 31 surviving patients are currently two (two patients), three (one patient), four (one patient), five (two patients), six (two patients), seven (three patients), nine (one patient), 12 (one patient), 13 (two patients), 14 (two patients), 15 (two patients), 16 (two patients), 17 (two patients), 18 (one patient), 20 (one patient), 21 (one patient), 22 (one patient), 30 (one patient), 33 (two patients), and 38 (one patient) years old 31.

MyD88 and IRAK\u20104 are indispensable for survival in infancy and early childhood and, before the advent of vaccines and antibiotics, most if not all children with these defects would have died in the first few years of life. However, several individuals with MyD88 deficiency or its immunological phenocopy, IRAK\u20104\u2010deficiency, who were given antibiotic prophylaxis and even sometimes IgG substitution following the genetic identification of the disease, have survived into adolescence and adulthood. Many of these patients have since stopped taking regular antibiotic prophylaxis, but have not yet developed invasive pyogenic infections.

By contrast to the broad susceptibility of MyD88\u2010deficient mice to 46 different bacteria, viruses, protozoa, and fungi (i.e. to almost nearly all the microbes tested), patients with MyD88\u2010 or IRAK\u20104\u2010deficiencies are susceptible to invasive and noninvasive infections with only a few Gram\u2010positive and Gram\u2010negative bacteria. Moreover, MyD88\u2010IRAK\u20104\u2010mediated TLR and IL\u20101R immunity is undoubtedly vital in infancy and early childhood, but gradually becomes dispensable, from adolescence onwards. Overall, MyD88\u2010dependent TLR and IL\u20101R immunity is vital in both mice and humans, but its role in the course of naturally occurring infections in humans seems to be much more restricted than initially inferred from experimental infections in mice, as humans lacking functional MyD88 or IRAK\u20104 proteins are susceptible to a narrow range of pathogens, and only in infancy and early childhood. The different outcomes between experimental infections in mice and natural infections in humans may be due to species\u2010specific differences, or more likely to differences in the modes of infection. In that regard, the study of naturally occurring infections in MyD88\u2010 and IRAK\u20104\u2010deficient mice would be insightful, as suggested by preliminary studies 130. In any case, the studies of MyD88\u2010 and IRAK4\u2010deficient humans neatly illustrate the value of dissecting inborn errors of immunity underlying pediatric infectious diseases for deciphering the redundant and nonredundant roles of host defense genes in natura 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28. Immunological redundancy is greater in the course of natural infections in outbred human populations than in the course of experimental infections in inbred mice. Genetic studies of this type will facilitate the burgeoning, long\u2010awaited investigation of the contribution of immunity to health, and disease in humans 131, 132, 133.",

MyD88 and IRAK\u20104 control IRF (Interferon regulatory factors), MAPK (map kinases), and NEMO (NF\u2010\u03baB essential modulator) that regulate AP\u20101 and NF\u2010\u03baB (p50/p65); the latter by stimulating the phosphorylation and degradation of I\u03baB\u03b1 so releasing NF\u2010\u03baB from the inactive NF\u2010\u03baB/I\u03baB\u03b1 complex.
