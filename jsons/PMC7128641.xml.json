In The Netherlands, more than 100 general practitioners (GPs) participate in nationwide surveillance of respiratory pathogens and influenza-like illnesses, coordinated by the Netherlands Institute for Health Services Research (NIVEL, Utrecht, The Netherlands) [6]. The GPs register all patients with influenza-like illness and other ARIs. ARIs without influenza-like illness are defined as respiratory infections with acute onset (< 5 days) and coryza, sore throat and/or cough. Twenty GPs participated in the present study and were requested to collect a nose and throat sample from patients with ARIs without influenza-like illness (case). A corresponding control was also sampled within 7 days, defined as an individual who consulted the GP for a complaint other than ARIs, who was in the same age category as the case (0\u20134, 5\u201314, 15\u201324, 25\u201344, 45\u201364 or > 65 years), was not a member of the same household as the case, and had not received antibiotics or antiviral therapy in the preceding 14 days. A nose and a throat swab were placed together in 4 mL of Hanks\u2019 balanced salt solution containing gelatin, lactalbumin, yeast and antibiotics (GLY medium), and sent to the central laboratory by regular mail. Swabs for bacterial culture were also taken.",

Real-time detection of the fragment was done with a Legionella genus-specific fluorescent probe conjugated to a minor groove binder (LSPP-VIC: 5'-GGTTGCGTCGTTACG-3'). An L. pneumophila-specific fluorescent minor groove binder probe was used on the complementary DNA strand (LPN-FAM: 5'-GAGTCCCCACCATCACATG-3'). Inhibition was monitored in a separate assay by amplifying a phocine herpes virus, and negative controls were included to monitor processing and cross-contamination. Sensitivity controls comprised ten-fold dilutions of L. pneumophila DNA (1000 fg to 10 fg), while 1000 fg of Legionella bozemanii DNA served as a control for discrimination between L. pneumophila and other Legionella spp.",

Knowledge of the causes of respiratory infections continues to evolve, with recognition of new pathogens [8], but no aetiological diagnosis is established in a large percentage of cases [3]. It might be expected that Legionella spp. could play a role in ARIs, as they are ubiquitous in the aquatic environment and artificial water systems, and can cause a variety of diseases, ranging from asymptomatic cases to severe life-threatening pneumonia [1, 9]. Upper respiratory signs and symptoms, such as a dry cough and sore throat, have been reported in cases of Legionnaires\u2019 disease [10], and a previous study [4] found serological evidence of infection with Legionella spp. in 11.2% of patients who presented with a febrile respiratory tract infection. However, observations based solely on antibody seroconversion should be viewed with scepticism, as the sensitivity and specificity of serology for Legionella spp. other than L. pneumophila have not been validated, and cross-reactions with other organisms may occur [1, 11, 12].",

Isolates are identified by a combination of colony and Gram's stain morphology, and reactions with specific antibodies. However, because of the fastidious nature of the organism and problems inherent in specimen collection, culture of clinical specimens may have a sensitivity as low as 10%[11]. Moreover, several non-pneumophila Legionella spp. tend to grow poorly on BCYE agar [13]. Nucleic acid amplification techniques are attractive tools for detection of Legionella spp. in clinical samples, as they are able to detect all legionellae and provide results rapidly. Several studies have found that PCR methods have a higher rate of detection than culture-based methods [14, 15, 16]. In the present study, the assay sensitivity was 10 fg for all Legionella spp., equivalent to two bacterial cells/reaction.",
