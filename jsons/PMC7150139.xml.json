Secondary polycythaemia can generally be excluded by the clinical history and examination, assessment of serum erythropoietin concentration and arterial oxygen saturation, haemoglobin electrophoresis or high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) plus an oxygen dissociation curve and abdominal ultrasound examination. If initial screening tests are negative for a JAK2 mutation and there is no obvious secondary cause for the high Hct, then red cell mass studies are indicated (Chapter 17).\n",

Additional findings on the full blood count can be helpful to identify the cause of neutrophilia. The combination of anaemia and neutrophilia occurs in chronic infection or inflammation, and also in malignant conditions; a high Hct with neutrophilia suggests polycythaemia vera. Neutrophilia with an increased platelet count occurs in infectious or inflammatory processes or malignant conditions and during marrow recovery. Neutrophilia with thrombocytopenia is classically seen in sepsis and occasionally in microangiopathic haemolytic anaemia. Examination of the peripheral blood film also provides additional clues to confirm or exclude a particular diagnosis. For example, neutrophilia with the neutrophils showing heavy cytoplasmic granulation (\u2018toxic\u2019 granulation) is a common finding in severe bacterial infections. In the absence of any underlying cause, a high neutrophil count with immature myeloid cells suggests chronic myelogenous leukaemia (CML), and cytogenetic and molecular studies to look for t(9;22) and the BCR\u2013ABL1 fusion gene are indicated (Chapter 8).",

It is occasionally difficult to differentiate between a reactive and a neoplastic lymphocytosis. In this situation, immunophenotyping, to provide evidence of light chain restriction and polymerase chain reaction for immunoglobulin or T-cell receptor gene rearrangements, may indicate the presence of a monoclonal population of lymphocytes, thereby supporting a diagnosis of neoplastic, rather than reactive, lymphoproliferation.",

Reduced production of cells may be the result of aplastic anaemia, a lack of haematinics such as folate or cobalamin or interference with normal haemopoiesis by infiltration (e.g. leukaemia), infection (e.g. human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, tuberculosis, leishmaniasis) or exposure to toxins (e.g. alcohol) or myelosuppressive drugs (e.g. hydroxycarbamide or methotrexate). Certain myeloid neoplasms, e.g. primary myelofibrosis and myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS), are characterised by cytopenias, which are at least in part the result of ineffective haemopoiesis. Cytopenia is also sometimes a feature of acute myeloid leukaemia (AML), when it is due both to ineffective haemopoiesis and to replacement of normal haemopoietic stem cells by leukaemic cells. A relatively common cause of a global reduction in circulating cells is pooling of the cells in a markedly enlarged spleen (hypersplenism), which may be secondary to conditions such as primary myelofibrosis and portal hypertension. Examination of a bone marrow aspirate and trephine biopsy specimen is often helpful in determining the cause of cytopenias for which no obvious cause is apparent.",

The choice of investigations is guided by the MCV and red cell morphology in addition to clinical features. Figures 23-1\nto Figure 23-2, Figure 23-3\nare flow charts that provide an orderly sequence of investigations for the different types of anaemia on the basis of these indices. Examination of a blood film will usually suggest the quickest route to the diagnosis, though confirmation may require more specific tests. The presence of basophilic stippling with microcytic red cells suggests thalassaemia trait or, much less often, lead poisoning. A dimorphic blood film is typical of congenital sideroblastic anaemia but is more often the result of iron deficiency responding to treatment.

Laboratory confirmation of iron deficiency can be based on measurement of (1) serum ferritin or (2) serum iron plus either total iron-binding capacity or transferrin or (3) red cell protoporphyrin or (4) staining of bone marrow aspirates for iron (see Chapter 4).6 A diagnosis of iron deficiency must be followed by a search for the cause. This should include specific questions relating to blood loss and dietary insufficiency and may require stool examination for parasites and occult blood, endoscopic examination of the gastrointestinal tract to exclude occult malignancy and tests for coeliac disease. The differential diagnosis of iron deficiency anaemia includes anaemia of chronic disease (also known as anaemia of inflammation). Clinical and laboratory features of inflammation or chronic infection may suggest this diagnosis, which is confirmed by demonstration of normal or high serum ferritin and reduced serum iron, transferrin and iron-binding capacity. Serum soluble transferrin receptors may be helpful in distinguishing between iron deficiency anaemia and anaemia of chronic disease when interpretation of ferritin levels is difficult, though additional research is needed to define the overall diagnostic accuracy of these tests.7\n",

In patients with these blood film findings and normal folate and cobalamin assays, haematinic deficiency cannot be completely excluded and further investigations are indicated (see Chapter 10).

An automated reticulocyte count or supravital staining of blood films (see p. 27) can be used to confirm reticulocytosis. Untreated anaemia associated with polychromasia is likely to indicate blood loss or haemolysis. The combination of red cell fragments, thrombocytopenia and polychromasia indicates a microangiopathic haemolytic anaemia. This is a medical emergency because these may be features of thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura, which requires immediate treatment, usually by plasma exchange.

In the presence of anaemia, a lack of polychromasia, confirmed by reticulocytopenia, points toward a primary failure of erythropoiesis or lack of compensatory increased red cell production in blood loss or haemolysis. Examination of the bone marrow may be helpful in demonstrating haematological causes for a normochromic, normocytic anaemia such as MDS or aplastic anaemia.10 Staining for iron may also show that there is a block in iron metabolism suggestive of anaemia associated with chronic inflammatory disease.",

It will be noted that cytogenetic analysis is essential for the application of the WHO classification because cases of the 5q-syndrome cannot otherwise be recognised. Like the classification of AML, this is a hierarchical classification. Therapy-related MDS is categorised with therapy-related AML. Remaining cases are then assessed to ascertain whether they meet the criteria for the 5q-syndrome. If they do not, they are assigned to one of the remaining categories, depending on the number of lineages showing dysplasia, the percentage of ring sideroblasts, the presence or absence of Auer rods and the percentage of blast cells in the blood and marrow.",

This classification groups together ALL and lymphoblastic lymphoma, using the designations B lymphoblastic leukaemia/lymphoma and T lymphoblastic leukaemia/lymphoma. These designations are clearly too cumbersome to use in clinical practice and undoubtedly haematologists will continue to refer to \u2018acute lymphoblastic leukaemia.\u2019 The FAB classification of ALL is now redundant except that FAB L3 morphology (i.e. the presence of \u2018blast cells\u2019 with basophilic cytoplasm and vacuolation) is of considerable clinical significance and should be recognised. In most, but not all, of these cases the cells are immunologically mature, expressing surface membrane immunoglobulin and the condition represents a leukaemic presentation of Burkitt lymphoma. The WHO categorisation of such cases as lymphoma is more appropriate than their being categorised as ALL and is clinically important because the treatment is urgent and differs considerably from the treatment of ALL.",
