Due to factors such as history of prescription for other infectious diseases, availability, and relatively low cost, the use of chloroquine (CQ) and hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) has been tested in vivo and in vitro for the ability to inhibit the causative virus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). However, even though investigators noted the therapeutic potential of these drugs, it is important to consider the toxicological risks and necessary care for rational use of CQ and HCQ. This study provides information on the main toxicological and epidemiological aspects to be considered for prophylaxis or treatment of COVID-19 using CQ but mainly HCQ, which is a less toxic derivative than CQ, and was shown to produce better results in inhibiting proliferation of SARS-CoV-2 based upon preliminary tests.",

Patients who are being treated with mefloquine are at increased risk of convulsions. Current recommendations emphasized the fact that toxicity is related to the dose calculated by real weight. Hence, the prescription of daily doses of CQ and HCQ needs to be suitable for patients who are at high risk of presenting adverse effects, considering that cumulative doses above 2.3 mg/kg body weight/day are considered high risk (Marmor et al. 2016) .",
