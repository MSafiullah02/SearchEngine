Only in 20-30% it regresses spontaneously and relapse rates range deeply (9-80%). Echinacea extracts possess antiviral and immunomodulator activities. The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of the therapy, using a formulation based on HPVADL185 (on dry extracts of 200 mg Echinacea Purpurea (EP) roots plus E. Angustifolia (EA)), on the posttreatment relapse incidence of genital condylomatosis. Materials and Methods. It is a prospective single-arm study. Patients with a satisfactory and positive vulvoscopy, colposcopy, or peniscopy for genital condylomatosis were divided into two random groups and subjected to destructive therapy with Co2 Laser. Group A (N=64) immediately after the laser therapy started a 4-month treatment with oral HPVADL185; Group B (N=61) did not undergo any additional therapy. Patients were subjected to a followup after 1, 6, and 12 months. Differences in relapse incidence between the two groups during follow-up controls were evaluated by 2-test; the groups were stratified by age, gender, and condylomatosis extension degree. Results and Discussion. Gender, age, and condyloma lesions' extension degree showed no statistically significant differences between the two trial groups. The relapse incidence differs statistically between the two studied groups and progressively decreases during the 12 months after treatment in both groups. Statistically significant reduction of relapse rates has been shown in Group A in patients over 25 years old. This difference is significant for both men and women. The relapse incidence is superior in case of extended condylomatosis. Conclusions.",

In the two years after a sexual debut the sexual risk of infection varies from 40 to 80% depending on the studied population and the HPV type [1] . There is a similar incidence of genital condylomatosis in males and females (0-2% and 0-7%) [2] [3] [4] . In men, compared to women, infections with multiple genotypes and low-oncogenic risk genotypes are more frequent [5] . Only 20-30% of the genital condylomatosis regresses spontaneously. This is a highly infectious disease; about 65% of partners of individuals with genital warts will develop genital condylomatosis. The risk of infection and the risk of progression of HPV-associated lesions are related to several factors including number of sexual partners experienced during the life and early age of the first intercourse; tobacco smoking; and eating habits [6] [7] [8] .",

Numerous in vitro and in vivo studies have been recently conducted in an effort to validate some of the traditional uses of Echinacea extracts [9] . Early studies have shown that only a few Echinacea extracts possess significant antiviral activity. In particular, above-ground portions and roots of EP show a strong antiviral activity, as they have a virucidal effect against influenza virus, herpes simplex virus, and coronaviruses [10, 11] . The EP appeared much less effective against intracellular viruses [12, 13] , which could be resistant to the EP inhibitory effect; on the contrary, viral particles located in the extracellular fluids appeared to be vulnerable. Therefore, EP can act during an initial contact with virus, that is, at the beginning of infection and also during the transmission of the virus from the infected cells.",

EP induces a proliferation of T cells. This has been conferred to the activation of macrophages that stimulates a production of IFN-and, consequently, a secondary activation of T lymphocytes [35] . IFN-is one of the fundamental mediators for the latency prevention [36] ; it has been proven that this mechanism is responsible for reducing the latency incidence of herpes virus simplex infection and, consequently, reducing the relapse risk of HSV lesions [36] . It is possible that an analogous mechanism induces a cell-mediated response to HPV infection, which allows the reduction of the persistence of infection and, therefore, the lesion relapse.",
