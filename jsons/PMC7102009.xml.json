The rates of patient and graft survival are lower in ABO-I transplants than in ABO-compatible (ABO-C) transplants because of antibody-mediated rejection events, such as vascular thrombosis and ischemic bile duct complications. Recently, encouraging results have been achieved with new strategies to reduce posttransplant-specific hemagglutinin titers, including reinforced immunosuppression, splenectomy, and the use of rituximab [1, 2]. At our institution, we have developed local infusion therapy with methylprednisolone and prostaglandin E1 (PGE1) to ameliorate endothelial injury by antibody-mediated reactions. Methylprednisolone and PGE1 have been infused through the hepatic artery, and acceptable outcomes have been achieved in adult ABO-I LDLT with rituximab prophylaxis in 2006 [3].",

In particular, a preexisting memory pool, produced by a host\u2019s history of infection, is more likely to affect the course of infection and be a potential barrier for tolerance induction, a phenomenon termed heterologous immunity [5, 6]. Accordingly, it is very important to clarify how preexisting memory T cells affect the defense against repeated infections and pathogens that have not been encountered previously and repeat infections. Our previous studies have shown that the probability of survival and the frequency of infection after LDLT are closely related to the effector T cell population of circulating CD8+ T cells before LDLT [7] and that CD4+ cells play an important role in CD8+ T cell differentiation [8].",

Therefore, it is of great importance to investigate how the phenotypic and functional characteristics of circulating CD8+ effector T cells after LDLT may affect clinical outcomes. On the other hand, hierarchical clustering algorithms have been used to distinguish recipients so as to identify clusters of recipients with a similar proportion of naive, central/memory (CM), effector/memory (EM), and effector T cells. We studied the impact of phenotypic and functional analyses of CD8+ effector T cells on the clinical outcomes of ABO-I recipients and ABO-C recipients.",

For HAI, an 18-G catheter designed for a central venous line was placed in the hepatic arterial branch of the recipient after hepatic artery anastomosis during the operation, which was not used for reconstruction. In addition to the basic immunosuppression, methylprednisolone (125 mg/day for the first week and 50 mg/day for the following 2 weeks) and PGE1 (0.01 \u03bcg/kg/min for 3 weeks) were administered immediately through the hepatic artery catheter. In PVI, PGE1, methylprednisolone, and mesilates (Ono, Osaka, Japan) were administered through a catheter into the portal vein [10]. In HAI, PGE1 and corticosteroids were administrated through a catheter into the hepatic artery [3, 10]. In the HAI + PVI protocol, PGE1 and corticosteroids were administered through a catheter into the hepatic artery and mesilates were administered through a catheter into the portal vein.\n",

Upon encountering an antigen, these CD8+ T cells were highly cytolytic, even after immunosuppression. In contrast, in ABO-C group III and ABO-I groups II and III recipients, the cytotoxic ability of CD8+ effector T cells was significantly decreased and, thus, ensured an uncontrollable infection. In particular, such excessive down-regulation of cytotoxicity was associated with a markedly impaired ability of the recipient to eradicate the infection and an increased vulnerability to additional invading pathogens in group III. When the down-regulation of effector T cells continues for a prolonged period after LDLT, as shown in ABO-I group III recipients, with time the effector T cells seem to be driven to an \u201cexhausted\u201d phenotypic and functional state, culminating in the deletion of responding cells. Lastly, full exhaustion, indicating the complete loss of effector function, occurred in the terminal stage of recipients with life-threatening infection. This mechanism could operate to silence antiviral or bacterial T cell responses. Conversely, high bacterial and viral loads were associated with the ablation of CD8+ effector T cell responses and with impaired cytokine production, as proposed by Wherry et al. [23]. Thus, a marked down-regulation of effector T cells and perforin expression plays a greater role in determining survival probability. Furthermore, such functions of CD8+ effector T cells were determined by the preexisting CD8+ T cell differentiation phenotype before LDLT. These findings are consistent with the greater frequencies of donor-specific memory T cells in the peripheral blood at the time of transplantation being associated with poor allograft outcome [24].",

ABO-I recipients were more likely to develop life-threatening complications, mainly sepsis, after surgical complications. Once this occurs in ABO-I recipients, the outcome of surgical complications would be seriously compromised by a high rate of severe infection. Over immunosuppression, especially use of large amounts of corticosteroids, may also be one of the factors inducing severe infectious complication. Interestingly, in ABO-I group II and III recipients the frequencies of posttransplant infection were higher than in ABO-C group II and III recipients. However, the ACR rates tended to be suppressed in ABO-I group II and III recipients. These decreased ACR rates are due to tacrolimus administration inducing greater inhibition of both effector cell generation and CTL cytotoxicity in ABO-I group II and III recipients than in ABO-C recipients. In ABO-I group II and III recipients, the tacrolimus immunosuppression, although suppressing ACR development, contributes to a catastrophic effect on the development of infection.

            "text": "Based on our current experience, AMR can often be prevented by hepatic artery infusion therapy and rituximab prophylaxis. However, higher frequencies of effector T cells in the peripheral blood at the time of the transplantation, possibly with an extensive history of environmental exposure, were associated with poor allograft outcome. The reduction of posttransplant infection is a key to improve the outcome of ABO-I LDLT. Accordingly, it is of very high importance to prevent the marked down-regulation of effector T cells by a promising device to adjust immunosuppression.",

            "text": "Despite appropriate tacrolimus trough levels, differences in the down-regulation of effector T cells occurred between ABO-C and ABO-I recipients. This may provide important insights that the marked down-regulation of effector T cells is due to the highest negative sensitivity to tacrolimus administration. In this regard, there were marked differences in group II between ABO-C and ABO-I recipients. The effector T cells were not down-regulated after tacrolimus administration in ABO-C group II but were decreased significantly in ABO-I group II, indicating higher negative sensitivity to tacrolimus in this group. In ABO-I group II, the posttransplant course was more often compromised by LTCs, although there were no hospital mortalities. Immunosuppressive agents differ in their ability to control the generation and function of CD8+ memory T cells; for this purpose, calcineurin inhibitors are the most efficacious. However, the mechanism of the high negative sensitivity to tacrolimus in the recipients with preexisting effector T cells is unclear. On the other hand, the marked down-regulation of effector T cells was associated with a decrease in IFN-\u03b3 expression (data not shown). Experimental studies have found that in mice with high IFN-\u03b3 production, calcineurin-inhibitor therapy effectively induces long-term graft survival after cardiac allografting, whereas in IFN-\u03b3-deficient mice the same therapy only marginally prolongs graft survival and induces a resistance to calcineurin inhibitors [25, 26]. Accordingly, it seems likely that CTL cytotoxicity cannot effectively respond to tacrolimus therapy during down-regulation of IFN-\u03b3 production in effector-enriched recipients. This indicates the importance of tailoring immunosuppressants for transplant recipients, particularly those with very high levels of preexisting immunological memory. However, there is no reliable approach to prevent the impairment of CTL cytotoxicity in transplantation. A promising strategy may be to meticulously adjust the minimum immunosuppression for each recipient. Because % effector difference was decreased by day 2, when reaching appropriate trough levels of tacrolimus, more accurate assessment of the recipient\u2019s immune status may help to tailor immunosuppression for high-risk recipients and may prevent graft failure in selected patients.",

Furthermore, group I of ABO-I or ABO-C recipients could successfully undergo LDLT without severe posttransplant complications.
