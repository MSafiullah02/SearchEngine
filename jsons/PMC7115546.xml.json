            "text": "In addition to individual benefits, most vaccines provide significant societal benefits by reducing transmission and indirectly protecting unvaccinated people (e.g., infants too young to receive vaccine) by reducing exposure to vaccine-preventable infections that significantly reduces the burden of disease and the associated health and financial costs. Events in the late 1970s and early 1980s revealed a vaccine enterprise greater than the sum of its composite parts when the increased availability and use of vaccines in the U.S. led to significant declines of vaccine-preventable diseases. However, the decreased burden of vaccine-preventable diseases made more visible the reported rare but serious adverse events temporally associated with vaccination. Concern that liability from rare adverse events attributed to vaccines would result in decisions by vaccine manufacturers to avoid this risk by ceasing production of existing vaccines and to not invest in the development of new vaccines led to concerns about the health and stability of the U.S. vaccine enterprise.",

            "text": "To address concerns about the U.S. vaccine enterprise, in 1986, the U.S. Congress passed and President Ronald Reagan signed the National Childhood Vaccine Injury Act (Public Law 99-660, 42 USC. \u00a7 300aa-1 to 300aa-34), which required the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) to establish a coordinated \u201cNational Vaccine Program to achieve optimal prevention of human infectious diseases through immunization and to achieve optimal prevention against adverse reactions to vaccines.\u201d Section 300aa-5 of the Act established the National Vaccine Advisory Committee (NVAC), and required NVAC to: \u201c(i) study and recommend ways to encourage the availability of an adequate supply of safe and effective vaccination products in the States, (ii) recommend research priorities and other measures the [Director of the National Vaccine Program] should take to enhance the safety and efficacy of vaccines, (iii) advise the [Director of the National Vaccine Program] in the implementation of the [National Vaccine Plan], and (iv) identify annually for the [Director of the National Vaccine Program] the most important areas of government and non-government cooperation that should be considered in implementing [the Director\u2019s responsibilities and the National Vaccine Plan].\u201d In addition, the National Childhood Vaccine Injury Act (Public Law 99-660) created additional infrastructure to support immunization in the U.S. by establishing the Vaccine Injury Compensation Program (VICP) and required reporting of vaccine adverse events, which led to the development of the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) and the establishment of the Advisory Commission on Childhood Vaccines (ACCV). The 1986 legislation thus recognized the societal benefits of vaccination and the societal obligation to compensate individuals who suffered serious injuries caused by vaccination. The establishment of the VICP as a no-fault alternative to the traditional tort system encouraged both a stable vaccine supply and vaccine innovation in service of the dual goals of achieving optimal prevention of human infectious diseases through immunization and achieving optimal protection against adverse reactions to vaccines.",

            "text": "In 1987, the HHS Secretary designated the Assistant Secretary for Health (ASH) to serve as the Director of the National Vaccine Program and established the National Vaccine Program Office (NVPO) as an independent coordinating office within the HHS Office of the Assistant Secretary for Health (OASH) to support the ASH in this role. At the time, OASH held line authority over the HHS public health agencies, including the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), Food and Drug Administration (FDA), and National Institutes of Health (NIH), such that the leaders of those agencies reported to the ASH and not directly to the HHS Secretary [1]. Table 1\n(a) lists the names and terms of the individuals who served as the ASH/Director of the National Vaccine Program, and Table 1(b) lists the names and terms of the individuals who served as NVPO Directors/Coordinators through the end of 2016, including the second and third authors. By organizing many existing components of the U.S. vaccine and immunization enterprise under the National Vaccine Program and building on an existing Interagency Group, NVPO assumed a key coordination role. Priority early activities for NVPO included beginning development of a comprehensive long-term National Vaccine Plan [2]. In 1994, NVPO issued the first U.S. National Vaccine Plan, which included four goals: \u201cGoal 1: Develop new and improved vaccines; Goal 2: Ensure the optimal safety and effectiveness of vaccines and immunization; Goal 3: Better educate the public and members of the health professions about the benefits and risks of immunizations; and Goal 4: Achieve better use of existing vaccines to prevent disease, disability, and death\u201d [3]. Subsequent and related plans issued by NVPO included the updated National Vaccine Plan in 2010 [4], 2012 National Vaccine Implementation Plan [5], 2016 National Adult Immunization Plan [6], and a mid-course review of the 2010 National Vaccine Plan [7].",

Secretary Otis R. Bowen established the first NVAC charter on July 30, 1987. The current NVAC charter specifies the committee composition as two voting members who officially represent the vaccine manufacturing industry, 15 voting public members (including the chair), and non-voting ex officio members and liaison members representing federal agencies or other organizations with interest in vaccines [8]. NVPO manages the process for selecting NVAC public voting members, which includes an open solicitation for nominations posted in the Federal Register followed by review of all nominations by the Institute of Medicine (IOM, which changed its name in 2015 to the National Academy of Medicine), and final selection and appointment by the ASH. Selection of the two voting members who represent the vaccine manufacturing industry depends on nomination of individuals engaged in vaccine research or the manufacture of vaccines from vaccine-related trade associations. Notably, the enabling legislation for NVAC (and the ACCV) presumed and attempted to foster joint participation and resulting cooperation of the public and private sectors of the immunization enterprise.

For the systematic literature review, we searched Medline and Web of Science on February 5, 2017 for articles authored by or with a title including \u201cNational Vaccine Advisory Committee\u201d and searched the archives of NVPO and NVAC websites to identify other reports and recommendations not published in journals. We reviewed all of the documents identified and characterized them as products approved by NVAC or as reports or publications related to NVAC but not by NVAC. We summarized the productivity of NVAC by quantifying the numbers of products and the fraction published in widely-accessible public health journals by year. We reviewed a 2009 independent evaluation of NVAC that explored NVAC\u2019s working process, environment, and its recommendations from 1998 to 2008 [9]. While that review suggested strategies to improve NVAC effectiveness and the impact of its deliberations, reports, and recommendations [9], it did not provide a comprehensive review of the full history and impact of NVAC. We also considered the annual reports submitted by NVPO to the FACA database and its reported performance measures [10], in which we found very limited information about the full or partial implementation of NVAC recommendations.",

Review of the 58 unique records revealed 30 reports approved by NVAC published in widely-accessible public health journals. The first NVAC published report [11], known as \u201cthe Measles White Paper,\u201d focused on the 1989\u201390 measles epidemic in the U.S. that resulted from a failure to provide vaccine to vulnerable children on schedule in large part due to barriers within the health care system. This seminal report and subsequent stabilization of the vaccine supply helped to demonstrate the value of NVAC and its enabling legislation. The report\u2019s analysis and recommendations led to a number of system improvements, particularly as part of a Presidential Initiative on Child Immunization (i.e., the 1993 Childhood Immunization Initiative) [12] and to establishment of the Vaccines For Children (VFC) Program [11]. The remaining 28 records referred to publications that either commented on or responded to NVAC recommendations or reports, summarized NVAC-sponsored workshops, or provided notices or editorial comments that mentioned NVAC. In addition, our review of NVPO and NVAC archives revealed 22 stand-alone approved resolutions and 26 other approved unique reports that did not appear in the literature (i.e., unpublished and not highly visible or widely accessible). We sought to identify all approved products (i.e., resolutions and reports), but we recognize that the lack of a comprehensive archive most likely means that we missed some resolutions and/or early reports. Fig. 1\nsummarizes NVAC productivity by showing the number of NVAC products and how they distribute relatively evenly over time, with approximately half approved before and half after 2002. NVAC approved more than two-thirds of all of the 30 reports published in journals in the last 15 years, which reflected an increasing practice of seeking publication of NVAC reports to increase their visibility and ensure access over time. We encountered challenges with respect to characterizing the number of total NVAC recommendations due to the non-standard way that NVAC reports count these. Specifically, individual NVAC reports included between 0 (i.e., reports that provided analyses without making any recommendations) and 32 recommendations each, with some reports aggregating the overall recommendations by topic area and others individually numbering each recommendation and sub-recommendation.",

In contrast to NVAC, which focuses on programmatic policies and strategies, guided by the epidemiology of vaccine preventable diseases, the CDC Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) recommends vaccines to protect individuals from disease and to prevent the transmission of infectious diseases in populations and focuses primarily on the technical aspects and recommendations for vaccine use. NVAC and ACIP historically shared a close relationship, with the chair of each group serving as a liaison to the other committee and a history of multiple joint initiatives (e.g., development of immunization standards, participation in workshops, recommendations for smallpox immunization related to bioterrorism threats).",

As mentioned earlier, concern about the impact of vaccine safety on vaccine supply and innovation served an important driver in the creation of the VICP, which the ACCV advises. Both NVAC and ACCV include voting members who represent the vaccine industry. The Vaccines and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee (VRBPAC) provides scientific support to the FDA with respect to evaluation and regulation of vaccines. The National Preparedness and Response Science Board (NPRSB, formerly the National Biodefense Science Board, NBSB) provides advice to the Secretary of HHS about the use of vaccines in preventing, preparing for, and responding to adverse health effects of emergencies. Finally, the National Advisory Allergy and Infectious Diseases Council (NAAIDC) advises the NIH Director on matters relating to vaccine-related research activities and functions of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID).",

At one of its first meetings, in September 1989, NVAC discussed developing a process to review improvements in existing vaccines, including safer, easier to produce, and/or better vaccines [14]. A year later, NVAC approved a report that identified diseases for which it considered vaccine development both possible and particularly important [15]. The report, which built on NIH deliberations, proposed criteria for prioritizing among the diseases that included: disease incidence among specified patient populations, urgency, and feasibility of producing and delivering safe and effective vaccines [15]. The report also identified both domestic and global priority opportunities for vaccine development by population segment (i.e., infants and children, adolescents, and adults) characterized according to: (i) available vaccines that could be improved, (ii) vaccines which could be available within 5 years, (iii) vaccines of great importance needing concerted effort if they are to be available in 10 years, and (iv) vaccines for which more basic research was required to determine feasibility (shown in Table 4\n) [15]. In September 1996, NVAC recognized the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) for supporting the development, testing, and introduction of vaccines for childhood meningitis, pneumonia, and diarrhea in developing countries, and encouraged continued and expanded efforts in the future for new vaccines, including combination vaccines [16].",

In 1999, the IOM released a report on Vaccines for the 21st Century that developed a quantitative model for use by decision makers to prioritize vaccine development [18]. In response to that report, NVAC raised concerns about the approach used by IOM to assess the cost-effectiveness of vaccines for 26 U.S.-specific disease targets and broadly categorize their favorability for investment [19]. NVAC also noted the need to include the costs of vaccine development and system costs for vaccine use, the feasibility of developing the vaccine, and consideration of global vaccine needs [19]. Following up on its prior work [17], in 1999 NVAC reviewed the pathways of research and development of vaccines that reached licensure expeditiously (e.g., hepatitis B, Haemophilus influenzae type b conjugate), vaccines licensed only after considerable delay (e.g., oral typhoid Ty21a, varicella), vaccines recently or with near-term expected licensure or submission for licensure (e.g., reassortant Rhesus rotavirus, intranasal cold adapted influenza), and one vaccine characterized by slow clinical development (i.e., respiratory syncytial virus) [20]. The 1999 review highlighted that \u201cthe critical step-up from bench scale to pilot lots and then to large-scale production, which depends on a small group of highly trained individuals, is often a particularly vulnerable point in the development process\u201d [20]. In the context of repeated identification of cytomegalovirus (CMV) as a priority disease for vaccine development [15], [18], NVPO and NVAC hosted a workshop in October 2000 that convened stakeholders to discuss vaccine candidates and explore the pathway for vaccine development [21].",

A September 1990 NVAC report emphasized four issues related to the prevention of adverse reactions: data collection/analysis, research, education of vaccine providers and consumers, and licensing and testing of vaccines [27]. The report anticipated the impending launch of the VAERS and noted several considerations for its implementation [27]. In June 1994, NVAC approved a report that discussed an IOM assessment of the safety of some childhood vaccines [28]. In January 1996, NVAC recommended that the HHS Secretary \u201cseek, identify, and establish a source of stable funding for Large Linked Data Base studies, as well as other active surveillance efforts\u201d [29] and expeditiously approve the Report by the Task Force on Safer Childhood Vaccines [30] (which included NVPO participation) and encouraged implementation of a work plan [31]. Building on the framework of VICP (which applies a $0.75 excise tax per disease prevented for vaccines recommended by the CDC for routine administration to children and pregnant women to fund the program), NVAC resolved in September 1996 that the HHS Secretary should \u201cpursue the establishment of a $0.05 flat tax per antigen that would be earmarked to improve the understanding of vaccine safety\u201d [32]. The Secretary of HHS did not act on this recommendation, and the federal excise tax for vaccines remains $0.75 per disease prevented with no adjustment for inflation made over time. In January 1997, following the lead of others, NVAC recommended that the Secretary advocate for a Presidential apology for the Tuskegee study to help restore trust in public health programs [33], which occurred in May 1997 [34].",

In May 1997, NVAC resolved that the HHS Secretary should \u201cgive priority to carrying out a comprehensive study and analysis of existing data on adverse events and liability, and how these factors impact adult immunization,\u201d with the expectation that the analysis would guide policy decisions regarding incorporation of adult vaccines into the VICP [35]. This did not occur, most likely because at the time, adult immunization safety issues did not appear to pose a barrier to innovation. At its next meeting in September 1997, NVAC resolved that the HHS Secretary should propose language to modify the VICP legislation to use VICP funds to expand national vaccine safety activities beyond compensation of injuries [36], which did not occur. In September 1998, NVAC encouraged increased resources for the Food and Drug Administration Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research (CBER) to support its critical role in assuring the availability of safe and effective vaccines [37]. In January 1999, NVAC endorsed the HHS Vaccine Safety Action Plan [38]. In May 1999, NVAC supported maintaining current recommendations for hepatitis B vaccine based on available data about its safety [39], although the importance of NVAC\u2019s support remains unclear. NVAC hosted a workshop on vaccine communication in October 2000 that included discussion of vaccine safety [40]. Although this workshop brought key stakeholders together, the role of this workshop and NVAC in stimulating increased attention and measureable improvements in vaccine safety remain difficult to assess.",

Also, in September 1998, NVAC recommended that the ASH seek to improve vaccination coverage of adolescents against hepatitis B virus infection, particularly when designing and implementing strategies to eliminate racial/ethnic disparities [71], and in May 1999 NVAC endorsed maintaining existing recommendations for hepatitis B vaccine [39].",

NVAC also asked NVPO to conduct a critical comprehensive after-action report of all aspects of each year's national influenza vaccination program [76]. This effort led to a continued focus on influenza, which included a June 2011 report that evaluated the first year of the universal seasonal influenza vaccination recommendation [77] and a February 2012 report on strategies to achieve the Healthy People 2020 annual influenza vaccine coverage goal for health-care personnel [78].

In 1991, NVAC recommended annual measurement and reporting of immunization coverage nationally and in every state [11]. In September 1995, NVAC recognized progress made on increasing preschool vaccine coverage rates [80] and resolved that the Secretary of HHS should engage all federal agencies \u201cto monitor the possible impact of [welfare] reforms on the immunization status of children and adults, to coordinate planning and development of welfare reform activities with respect to this issue, and to provide joint guidance to appropriate State agencies on vaccine coverage for such welfare reform proposals\u201d [81]. In 1998, NVAC emphasized the need to improve vaccine coverage for adolescents and recognized cost and lack of routine health care for adolescents as barriers [82]. NVAC also repeated its recommendation for insurance coverage with no deductible (i.e., \u201cfirst-dollar\u201d coverage) for childhood immunizations [58]. In May 1999, NVAC raised concerns about inadequate immunization infrastructure funding in the proposed fiscal year 2000 budget [83]. Following public debate about financing vaccines in the 21st century, NVAC recommended creating expanded and stable funding for vaccines under the Vaccines For Children program, harmonization of regulatory requirements to encourage vaccine development and licensure, insurance coverage with no deductible for immunization, and adequate reimbursement for providers who administer vaccines [65]. In September 2008, NVAC approved a report that sought to assure the vaccination of children and adolescents without financial barriers [84], with the recommendations related to financing vaccine purchase and vaccine administration in the public and private sectors published in 2009 [85]. The report recommended funding for vaccine administration reimbursement for un- and underinsured children and adolescents [84]. In September 2012, NVAC recognized the vital resources provided by Section 317 of the Public Health Service Act (enacted in 1962 through the Vaccine Assistance Act) in its first 50 years with respect to achieving high levels of vaccination coverage and support for the immunization infrastructure, with discussion of the introduction of pneumococcal conjugate vaccine providing context about the importance of strong infrastructure [66]. The September 2013 NVAC report on global immunization also highlighted the need for global vaccine financing [24].",

NVAC provided its first recommendations related to adult immunization in early 1990, which emphasized the importance of financing and reimbursement for vaccination of adults, the need for adult immunization standards of practice, liability protection, research, and communication of the risks and benefits [86]. The 1991 report on measles suggested that NVAC \u201cshould issue a formal set of minimum standards for immunization practice \u2026\u201d [11]. In January 1994, NVAC approved its first full report on adult immunization, which included five major goals: \u201c(i) increase the demand for adult vaccination by improving provider and public awareness, (ii) assume the health care system has an adequate capacity to deliver vaccines to adults, (iii) assure adequate financing mechanisms to support the expanded delivery of vaccines to adults, (iv) monitor and improve the performance of the nation\u2019s vaccine delivery system, and (v) assure adequate support for research on (1) vaccine-preventable diseases of adults, (2) adult vaccines, (3) adult immunization practices, (4) new and improved vaccines, and (5) international programs for adult immunization\u201d [87]. NVAC participated in the Ad Hoc Working Group for the Development of Standards for Pediatric Immunization Practices that issued standards for pediatric immunization practices in 1993 [88]. In January 1998, NVAC approved a report that identified strategies to sustain success in childhood immunizations [58], which provided a follow up to its 1991 report [11]. NVAC also periodically updated and expanded its pediatric immunization standards, including in February 1996 [89] and February 2002 [60], with the latter update explicitly adding adolescent immunization practices. In June 2008, NVAC approved unpublished recommendations for adolescent immunization [90] that led to a publication on the promise and challenge of adolescent immunization [61] and a publication related to mandates for adolescent immunizations [91].",

In December 1997, NVAC hosted a workshop on adult immunization programs in nontraditional settings [93], including the now-common practice of delivering influenza vaccines to adults in pharmacies, and in 1998, NVAC emphasized the need to improve vaccine coverage for adults [82]. NVAC periodically updated its standards for adult immunization practice, including in December 2001 [59] and September 2013 [94]. In June 2011, NVAC outlined a pathway to leadership for adult immunization [95]. In June 2015, the introduction of human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine motivated NVAC to approve a report on overcoming barriers to low HPV vaccine uptake in the United States [96]. The recent NVAC reports on maternal immunization [56], [57] also emphasized the need to overcome barriers to maternal immunization.",

In 1996, NVAC recognized contributions of USAID to research directed at the development and testing of vaccines for childhood meningitis, pneumonia, and diarrhea in developing countries, and commended USAID for promoting epidemiologic and etiologic research collaborations with international institutions such as the World Health Organization (WHO), United Nations International Children\u2019s Emergency Fund (UNICEF), and United Nations Development Program, domestic agencies such as the NIH and CDC and with U.S. vaccine manufacturers. NVAC encouraged USAID to continue its support for the development, testing, and introduction of these vaccines in developing countries and to expand efforts in the future for new vaccines, including combination vaccines [16]. In 1997, NVAC recognized the important role of two large multinational companies selling vaccines in the U.S. (SmithKline Beecham [now GSK] and Pasteur Merieux Connaught [now Sanofi Pasteur]) and noted the locations of their headquarters outside of the U.S. underscored the interconnectedness of U.S. immunizations and those in the rest of the world [17]. In May 1998 NVAC resolved to form a working group on pandemic influenza preparedness [105]. NVAC approved two reports related to the global eradication of wild poliovirus in 2004. In January 2004, NVAC reviewed laboratory containment of wild poliovirus in the U.S. in anticipation of global polio eradication and containment activities [106]. In February 2004, NVAC approved a report that aimed to ensure preparedness for potential poliomyelitis outbreaks by developing a poliovirus vaccine stockpile [107].",

For example, in responding to a review of the draft National Vaccine Plan by the IOM [108], NVAC expressed its concern (see appendix B of [108]) that the National Vaccine Plan: \u201cdoes not go far enough to address coordination of vaccine-related activities both at the Federal level and with non-governmental partners.\u201d NVAC further recommended that the final National Vaccine Plan adequately and appropriately address the ability of the National Vaccine Program to coordinate between the many varied partners and stakeholders involved in immunization in the United States, and \u201cthat it be given an adequate administrative structure and resources to do so\u201d (see appendix B of [108]).",

Notably, in 1988 ACIP recommended vaccination of all children against 8 diseases (i.e., diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis, polio, measles, mumps, rubella, and Haemophilus influenzae type b), and 30 years later the recommendations cover 16 diseases (i.e., the 8 above plus hepatitis B, hepatitis A, rotavirus, pneumococcal disease, influenza, meningococcal disease, HPV, and varicella). This growth demonstrates underscores significant innovation with respect to the development of vaccines, including the adoption of two vaccines to prevent forms of cancer (i.e., hepatitis B, HPV). Vaccine delivery technologies also changed, with whole cell pertussis vaccines replaced by acellular vaccines, oral polio vaccine (OPV) replaced by inactivated polio vaccine (IPV), and increased use of adjuvants that improve vaccine effectiveness (e.g., in HPV, influenza, hepatitis B vaccines). Vaccination of adults continues to increase, with additional adult vaccines including two types of pneumococcal vaccines (plain polysaccharide and polysaccharide conjugated to proteins) and a vaccine to prevent shingles. The nature of influenza (i.e., rapid virological changes requiring a new vaccine annually) and large demand for flu vaccine support(ed) the development of intranasal and intradermal vaccine delivery and high-dose products. Biotechnology innovations improved vaccine production technologies (e.g., recombinant, cell-based) with respect to yield and other product attributes. Finally, computational technology dramatically improved our ability to collect, analyze, and use data about vaccines throughout the system, including the development of IISs.",

Consistent with this opportunity, NVAC devoted considerable time to issues related to vaccine acceptance, supporting immunization across the lifespan, immunization mandates, and exemptions. While immunization represents a health issue appropriately led by HHS, the role of vaccines in routine immunization programs and in public health emergencies in the U.S. and globally highlights the need to consider the functioning of the U.S. vaccine and immunization system in the context of global health and security. One potential explanation for the relatively limited engagement of NVAC by other HHS agencies may relate to lines of reporting since the early 1990s (i.e., NVAC continues to report to the ASH instead of to the Secretary of HHS, but other agencies report directly to the Secretary of HHS), which may limit NVAC\u2019s overall influence across HHS (i.e., an advisory and coordination role instead of its original strategic and operational role).",

The deliberative process that leads to the development of NVAC recommendations includes rich debates, disagreements between individual committee members, opportunities for public comment at NVAC meetings, and discussions that engage a broad ranges of stakeholders, which may facilitate communication, understanding, and consensus-building among stakeholders. The inclusion of two voting members who represent the vaccine industry may help to some degree with industry buy-in, although this remains difficult to document.

For example, the U.S. vaccine safety system and VICP represent the best such systems in the world, and the U.S. continues to lead in global vaccine innovation.

Considering the progress on innovation since NVAC produced the list of priority diseases for vaccine development in Table 4 (and compared to the summary list of priorities identified in Table 5), we see many successes and some disappointments. For example, Americans now benefit from licensed vaccines that protect them from HPV, rotavirus, and varicella, but despite decades of research and billions of dollars spent, no licensed vaccines exist for HIV, RSV, or malaria. In addition, the development of a Lyme vaccine led to a licensed product that was only available for a relatively short period of time [109]. Overall, while innovations led to increased inclusion of antigens and use of combination vaccine formulations, we see little improvement in most of the vaccines that existed 30 years ago and limited development and use of innovative vaccine delivery technologies (e.g., FluMist\u2122 provided a nasal delivery option, but the ACIP did not recommend its use for the 2016\u201317 or 2017\u201318 flu seasons [110], [111]). Emphasizing the importance of continued innovation in vaccine research and development, the 21st Century Cures Act called out the continuing need to \u201cpromote innovation in the development of vaccines that minimize the burden of infectious diseases\u2026to consider the optimal process to determine which vaccines would be beneficial to public health\u2026and identify whether obstacles exist that inhibit the development of beneficial vaccines\u201d (Public Law 114-255, Section 3093).

However, recent vaccine development efforts related to emerging infectious diseases (e.g., Ebola virus and Zika virus vaccines), reveal significant ongoing challenges. Notably, designing and financing phase II and III clinical trials for new vaccines remains a major hurdle, with a reliance on large companies to assume the high costs and risks for an uncertain reward. With demand from relative few vaccine buyers (i.e., oligopsony) for low prices for vaccines, the incentives for vaccine development for the relatively few large vaccine suppliers (i.e., oligopoly) do not compare favorably with other opportunities for investment in development [112]. The successful development of MenAfriVac vaccine for Africa demonstrates the potential and the necessity for partnerships (e.g., public-private) to share risk and costs [112]. In addition, in the U.S., financing of programs to assure recommended vaccines for adults achieve high uptake remains a challenge that limits incentives to develop vaccines for adult markets. The Affordable Care Act removed one financial obstacle to vaccine uptake among adults by requiring insurers cover all ACIP recommended vaccines, but if altered may further detract from incentives to develop vaccines for adults. A further problem deals with the development of \u201cniche\u201d vaccines targeting a small population, which may not provide the market stimulus needed for manufacturers to accept the risks and undertake the high costs of development without some form of risk and cost sharing. Innovations in vaccine delivery technologies appear particularly difficult to develop, because the development pathway will likely lead to increased costs per dose of vaccine, and countries continue to demand increasingly lower costs for vaccines. In developing countries, the lack of adequate health infrastructure also limits the full utilization of vaccines globally. In addition, the requirement for highly-trained personnel to administer vaccines represents a continuing challenge for global vaccine development and global health [113]. While the Decade of Vaccines [114] aspires to extend the full benefits of immunization to all people, regardless of where they are born, who they are, or where they live, implementation of the Global Vaccine Action Plan remains a challenge.",

NVAC will most likely need to address barriers and obstacles that impede vaccine innovation given the major infectious disease burdens either not yet preventable by vaccination or not fully preventable due to less than optimal vaccines (e.g., influenza vaccines). Further, despite substantial progress in reducing vaccine-preventable diseases of childhood (due to very high coverage with highly effective vaccines), significant effort remains to achieve the same for adults. NVAC will most likely need to focus on overcoming barriers and facilitating vaccine uptake of recommended vaccines for adults. In addition, vaccine hesitancy and vaccine confidence will likely continue to represent priorities, for which NVAC will likely play a continued role in addressing public and professional concerns.
