            "text": "Medicine in the start of the XX century looks very archaic when compared with current knowledge and technical achievements. Progress is truly impressive, but even today there are many diseases that remain impossible to cure or at least to reduce symptoms burdensome for the patient. One of the more promising therapies that can be used for treating cancer, some infectious disease and even genetic diseases, is gene therapy based on ribonucleic acid interference (RNAi). RNAi is a natural defense mechanism that exists in many eukaryotes; it is activated by double-stranded RNAs (dsRNA) with specific sequences. dsRNA causes selective post-transcriptional gene silencing, which means that production of the corresponding protein is blocked. In mammalian cells, dsRNA longer than 30 nucleotides shuts down protein syntheses by non-specific degradation of messenger RNA (mRNA), and activates production of interferon-\u03b3\u2013interferon (IFN) pathway 4. This is why 20\u201325 nucleotide length RNAs are being used, known as short interfering RNA (siRNA). These RNA fragments are short enough to avoid a cellular interferon response, but are long enough to suppress genes [1]. RNAi therapy holds promise for some diseases, such as cancer [2], [3], virus infection (HIV, hepatitis, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)) [4], [5], [6], respiratory diseases (asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), cystic fibrosis) [7], [8], [9] and parasitic infections (malaria, human amoebiasis) [10], [11]. Ribonucleic acid can be used as a short hair-pin RNA transported by viral vectors or as a double-stranded siRNA. The first system is very efficient, but viral vectors can induce immunogenic response, making the use of many of them unsuitable. The other seems to be less problematical, but it is not easy to create an efficient delivery system for siRNA protection and transportation. There are several types of non-viral carriers used for delivery of nucleic acids, including lipids, polymeric amines and dendrimers.",

            "text": "To create ideal drug carriers, the mechanism of interaction of dendrimers and dendrimer\u2013drug conjugates with lipid membranes needs to be understood, which can improve the properties of the molecule by increasing its targeting efficiency and protective properties. In basic investigations, liposomes are often used as model membranes because of their simple composition, uncomplicated preparation and high stability [15], [16], [17], [18], [19], [20], [21], [22], [23], [24], [25], [26], [27], [28], [29], [30]. Studies on model membranes gives information about their interaction with a relatively simple lipid structure, leading to phenomena that are not disturbed by the proteins associated with them. In addition to model membranes, erythrocytes have been frequently undertaken. While there are some reports on interactions of PAMAM dendrimers with cells and biomembranes [31], [32], this article focuses those involving cationic carbosilane dendrimers (CBS) and their complexes with siRNA (dendriplexes) in terms of their action on red blood cells. CBS dendrimers were synthesized for siRNA and an oligonucleotide delivery system. They possess 16 cationic groups on their surface and can bind negatively charged nucleotide backbones through electrostatic interactions. Two second generation carbosilane dendrimers were used, BDBR0011 and NN16. Second generation CBS dendrimers show good toxicity profiles (low toxicity) up to 5 \u03bcM [33]. They can form stable complexes with nucleic acids and protect them from degradation and sequestration by proteins [34], [35]. Both these dendrimers are made of water-stable carbon\u2013silicon bonds, but NN16 possesses some oxygen\u2013silicon bonds that are unstable in water (Fig. 1\n). Slow hydrolyzation in aqueous solutions released cargos from dendrimers gradually, and this degradation takes over 4 to 24 h [36]. Since both appear to be promising candidates as drug carriers, we have tested these two very similar compounds to check which one is superior as a conveyor for siRNA in gene therapy.",

Changes in the membrane fluidity suggest that dendrimers change the physical properties of the whole membrane. The strongest interactions occurred in the hydrophilic region of the membrane which became more rigid, and thus dendrimers may have been bound to the lipid head groups. NN16 dendrimer which possesses not only Si\u2014C, but also Si\u2014O bonds, structurally stiffened the hydrophilic part of the membrane more than BDBR0011. Differences in the strength of the interaction between the two compounds are probably related to the Si\u2014O bonds associated with affinity to water. Dendrimer properties regarding the back-folding phenomenon were evident; this is a reorganization process due to dendrimer conformation by their folding into the interior of the molecule. Neutral pH induces protonation of surface amines of PAMAM dendrimers; as a consequence hydrogen bonding between surface and interior amines appears [53]. In the two kinds of carbosilane dendrimers investigated, the only real difference between them was in the Si\u2014O bonds of NN16e through which interactions occurred. This can be due to the back-folding process and hydrogen bonding between the positively charged surface amines and oxygen atoms. This phenomenon may explain the higher affinity of the NN16 dendrimer for the hydrophilic part of the bilayer. The less ordered state of the dendrimer molecule and its higher water accessibility makes it preferable to the charged hydrophilic part of a bilayer, which causes greater destabilization of a bilayer.",

For high concentrations of dendrimers, hemolysis kinetics gave a non-linear shape that may be evidence of aggregation between dendrimers and erythrocytes. High hemolytic behavior of these dendrimers is due to the cationic groups on their surfaces [54], [55]. Those molecules, with or without surface modification, are designed as carriers in drug delivery systems [56]. The surface charge of dendrimers has been modified in our experiments, which is a result of interaction between dendrimers and siRNA. The toxicity of dendrimers bound to siRNA (dendriplexes) decreases, which is easily seen when the results for carbosilane dendrimers alone and dendriplexes are compared. The hemolytic behavior of dendrimers can be reduced by 32% and 7% for the BDBR0011 dendrimer and NN16 dendrimer, respectively, in a concentration of 2.5 \u03bcM to zero for both dendriplexes given in an equimolar level to the dendrimer. It is interesting that the BDBR0011 dendrimer was more hemolytic. As already mentioned, its structure is more ordered; thus it could destabilize membranes in a different way and induce mainly fragmentation or pore formation. At neutral pH, all protonated cationic groups are presented on the surface of BDBR0011, which can result in hemolysis and aggregation of erythrocytes even at very low concentrations. For the NN16 dendrimer, toxicity is reduced due to the back-folding phenomenon that hides some cationic groups. However, interactions with membranes are still strong because of remaining positive surface charges, higher affinity to water and hydrogen bonding.",

Addition of dendriplexes induced echinocyte transformations; the cells became shrunken. siRNA bound to dendrimers decreased their toxicity, which might be due to a reduction in the availability of functional cationic groups. These results confirm the data obtained in other experiments for cationic dendrimers, in which cytotoxicity decreased as a result of the binding of sugars, peptides or drug molecules to the surface groups [12], [13], [14].",

By binding to the outer leaflet, they decrease its fluidity while increasing that of the hydrophobic interior. They induce hemolysis, but they do not change the morphology of erythrocytes. Increasing concentrations of dendrimers induced erythrocyte aggregation. Reduction of the number of cationic groups that follows the binding of siRNA decreases the toxicity of cationic dendrimers. siRNA\u2013dendrimer complexes neither change the fluidity of biological membranes nor cause hemolysis. Addition of dendriplexes to erythrocyte suspensions induces echinocyte transformation. Because of lower toxicity and a weaker ability to form aggregates, NN16 dendrimers may be better siRNA carriers than BDBR0011.",
