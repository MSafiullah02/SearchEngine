We recruited adult volunteers with confirmed influenza and suspected cases of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) to wear medical masks and self-designed triple-layer cotton masks in a regular bedroom and a car with air conditioning. Four 1-hour repeated measurements (two measurements for bedroom the others for car) of particles with a size range of 20-1000 nm measured by number concentrations (NC 0.02-1 ), temperature and relatively humidity, and cough/sneeze counts per hour were conducted for each volunteer. The paired t-tests were used for within-group comparisons in a bedroom and in a car. The results showed that there was no significant difference in NC 0.02-1 or cough/sneeze counts between volunteers with medical masks and cotton masks in a bedroom or a car. We concluded that the cotton mask could be a potential substitute for medical mask for respiratory infection person in microenvironment with air conditioning. Healthy people may daily use cotton mask in the community since cotton mask is washable and reusable.",

The concentration of NC 0.02-1 was measured on both sides of the mask throughout the protocol. They found that all types of masks reduced aerosol exposure. However, FFP-2 masks were more efficient than surgical masks, which were more efficient than tea cloth masks. Davies et al. (2013) recruited 21 healthy volunteers to make face masks from cotton t-shirts. The number of microorganisms isolated from coughs of volunteers wearing cotton masks, surgical masks, or no mask was compared. The results showed that cotton and surgical masks could significantly reduce the number of microorganisms expelled by volunteers.",

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends that healthcare providers and those who might be infected wear masks but does not recommend the routine use of respirators in the community (CDC, 2020) . However, people are racing to buy face masks, especially medical masks to protect themselves from infection (Secon, 2020) . It has led to a medical mask shortage around the world and may result in shortage of medical mask for people in need (Miller, 2020) . Previous studies have reported that oral cavity is the major sources of expiratory droplets in the range of 5-100 \u03bcm during speech and coughing (Johnson, 2009 ). The infected person wear face mask can suppress the expired jets and reduce the close contact transmission via both the droplet-borne and short-range airborne routes of infectious agents in the indoor environment (Wei, 2016) . Moreover, it has been reported that towel (100% cotton) and common cloth (70% cotton and 30% polyester) masks showed 40-60% in filtration efficiency for polydisperse sodium chloride (NaCl) aerosol particles {75 \u00b1 20 nm count median diameter (CMD) and a geometric standard deviation (GSD) not exceeding 1.86} at 5.5 cm/s face velocity (Rengasamy et al., 2010) .

Four repeated measurements of 1-hour mean particles with a size range of 20-1000 nm measured by number concentrations (NC 0.02-1 ) using a P-TRAK Ultrafine Particle Counter (model 8525; TSI Inc., MN, USA) located within 1 meter around volunteer, 1-hour mean temperature and relatively humidity by temperature and humidity sensor (model 1.153FH; Grimm Labortechnik Ltd., Ainring, Germany), and cough/sneeze counts per hour by voice recorder were conducted for each volunteer. Two repeated J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f 5 measurements (One with medical mask and the other one with cotton mask) were conducted in a bedroom and the other two repeated measurements were conducted in a car. The background concentrations of NC 0.02-1 in a bedroom and a car were measured one hour before each formal repeated measurement. Moreover, the concentrations of NC 0.02-1 in a bedroom and a car with volunteers without masks were also measured. We used one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) with Scheffe's mean comparison test to compare the concentrations of NC 0.02-1 between background (without volunteer), without mask (volunteers wearing no mask), medical mask (volunteers wearing medical masks), and cotton mask (volunteers wearing cotton masks) in a bedroom and in a car. We further used paired t-tests for within-group comparisons between medical mask and cotton mask in a bedroom and in a car. The study protocol was approved by the joint institutional review board at the Taipei Medical University in Taipei, Taiwan (TMU-JIRB No. 201602045). Written informed consent was obtained from each volunteer before the study.",
