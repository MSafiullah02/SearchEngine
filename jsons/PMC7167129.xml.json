The initial characterization of pandemic influenza A/H1N1 2009 (A/H1N1pdm) virus isolates showed that they were susceptible to the neuraminidase inhibitors (NAIs) zanamivir and oseltamivir, but resistant to the ion channel M2 blocker adamantane [Smith et al., 2009].

However, in the 2007/2008 influenza season, from November 2007, oseltamivir\u2010resistant seasonal influenza A/H1N1 viruses possessing a substitution in the neuraminidase (NA) protein from the histidine to tyrosine residue at position 275 (H275Y) were isolated predominantly in EU countries. In the 2008/2009 influenza season, oseltamivir\u2010resistant viruses spread dramatically worldwide, including Japan [Lackenby et al., 2008; Meijer et al., 2009; Ujike et al., 2010] (http://www.who.int/csr/disease/influenza/h1n1_table/en/index.html).",

In the NAI surveillance in Japan, 5422 A/H1N1pdm clinical isolates were sequenced for identification of the H275Y substitution marker in the NA gene, and only 67 oseltamivir\u2010resistant viruses possessing H275Y substitution were found, as of April 5, 2010 (http://idsc.nih.go.jp/iasr/graph/tamiful09-10.gif). Those oseltamivir\u2010resistant viruses did not cause localized epidemics in Japan. Most oseltamivir\u2010resistant viruses were isolated from cases administered prophylactics or therapeutics, and at this point oseltamivir use was associated with the emergence of oseltamivir\u2010resistant A/H1N1pdm viruses [Baz et al., 2009; WHO, 2009c].",

This assay could discriminate an oseltamivir\u2010resistant A/H1N1pdm virus possessing the H275Y mutation in clinical specimens. RNA purification is required for using the assay to detect the H275Y mutation in clinical specimens, since specimens from nasal or nasopharyngeal swabs may contain some components that inhibit the RT\u2010PCR reaction. The assay also could detect the H275Y mutation of the clinical isolates in cultured supernatants directly without RNA purification. Since the RNA purification procedure for each sample increased the risk of cross\u2010contamination and was time\u2010consuming, the ability to perform the assay without RNA purification is advantageous in situations where a large number of clinical isolates are handled. The assay developed in this study is a useful tool for monitoring oseltamivir\u2010resistant viruses.",
