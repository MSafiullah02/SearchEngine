Traditional cell-line cultures have been used to study L. intracellularis pathogenesis. However, these systems fail to reproduce the epithelial changes observed in the intestines of L. intracellularis-infected pigs, specifically, the changes in intestinal cell constitution and gene expression. A more physiologically accurate and state-of-the-art model is provided by swine enteroids derived from stem cell-containing crypts from healthy pigs. The objective of this study was to verify the feasibility of two-dimensional swine enteroids as in vitro models for L. intracellularis infection. We established both three-and two-dimensional swine enteroid cultures derived from intestinal crypts. The two-dimensional swine enteroids were infected by L. intracellularis in four independent experiments. Enteroid-infected samples were collected 3 and 7 d postinfection for analysis using real-time quantitative PCR and L. intracellularis immunohistochemistry. In this study, we show that L. intracellularis is capable of infecting and replicating intracellularly in two-dimensional swine enteroids derived from ileum.",

This infection results in crypt hyperplasia, decreased numbers of goblet cells, and compromised feed digestion that leads to poor weight gain in affected pigs (Vannucci et al., 2019) .

Most of the current investigations of alternatives to antimicrobial treatment of PE are not strategically designed toward specific targets due to the lack of understating of PE pathogenesis.

Although single cell cultures are routinely used for laboratory propagation of L. intracellularis, they fail in reproducing the cellular changes observed in the intestinal epithelium of PE-affected pigs (Resende et al., 2019b) . Although mice are not a natural host for L. intracellularis infection, we recently evaluated three-dimensional mouse enteroids as an in vitro model for L. intracellularis pathogenesis. However, despite the organotypic similarity offered by the model, mouse enteroids were an inadequate model since L. intracellularis did not significantly propagate or produce detectable changes in the host cells (Resende et al., 2019a) . Therefore, an adequate in vitro model for the investigation of L. intracellularis pathogenesis is still needed.",

Enteroids can be cultured as three-dimensional structures composed of intestinal epithelial cells which can be polarized with the apical membrane forming a sphere-like system with the center acting as intestinal lumen where cell debris are shed, and metabolites are secreted (Sato and Clevers, 2013; Yin et al., 2019) . This three-dimensional structure makes it necessary to use microinjection systems to add the treatments into the enteroid lumen, which is time consuming, laborious and makes control of dosing and exposure variable between enteroids Resende et al., 2019a) , Alternatively, enteroids can be cultured as two-dimensional enteroids by using transwells. Enteroids cultured this way still contain all types of intestinal epithelial cells present in the intestine, with the advantage of having an easy-access cell apical membrane, which simplifies the infection process and analyses (Braverman and Yilmaz, 2018; Thorne et al., 2018) .

Ileum tissue was collected from a healthy Landrace/Yorkshire cross-bred finisher pig (about 90 kg) euthanized for non-intestinal related research purposes. A 3-4 cm ileum piece was excised and placed in ice-cold Advanced Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Medium (Gibco Advanced DMEM, ThermoFisher) with 1% penicillin/ streptomycin (Gibco, ThermoFisher), then transferred to a Petri dish containing ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline solution (PBS) with 1% penicillin/streptomycin and opened longitudinally. After three washes in PBS, the tissue was transferred into calcium and magnesium-free Hanks' Balanced Salt solution (HBSS) containing 30 mM ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA, Corning, ThermoFisher), 1 mM dithiothreitol (DTT, Sigma-Aldrich), and 100 \u00b5g/mL penicillin/streptomycin, and incubated at 37 \u00b0C with shaking for 5-15 min. After incubation, crypts were separated by applying suction using a disposable transfer pipette, which was continued until abundant crypts were observed in the suspension by visual evaluation in an inverted microscope. The crypt suspension was transferred to a 15 mL centrifuge tube and washed with advanced DMEM with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS, Corning 35011CV, heat inactivated). The tube was centrifuged for 4 min at low speed (300 \u00d7 g) and the supernatant media was aspirated. The pellet was resuspended in DMEM with 10% FBS and centrifuged for 4 min at low speed (300 \u00d7 g). The supernatant media was aspirated, and the pellet resuspended in 1 mL of Intesticult organoid media (StemCell Technology). Crypt density was counted by placing 40 \u00b5L of the suspension on a slide and media volume adjusted to have 20-30 crypts / 40 \u00b5L. The crypt suspension was suspended in Matrigel (Corning) at a 1:3 ratio, and placed as beads in a 24-well culture plate which was then incubated for 15-20 min at 37 \u00b0C for the Matrigel to gelatinize. Once gelatinized, the wells were covered with 400 \u00b5L of Intesticult and incubated at 37 \u00b0C and 5% CO 2 . Intesticult media was replaced every 48 h to grow threedimensional enteroids.",

Long term, L. intracellularis infection of swine enteroids can be exploited in several ways such as to study 1) early hostpathogen events (endocytic process of L. intracellularis in intestinal epithelial cells); 2) phenotypic identification of the primary epithelial cells infected by L. intracellularis; 3) gene editing in swine enteroids to investigate the signaling pathways involved in L. intracellularis-induced proliferation; and 4) route of neighbor-cell infection during L. intracellularis propagation.",
