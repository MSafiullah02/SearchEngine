For the majority of coronaviruses, the proteolytic processing of the viral replicase polyprotein is mediated by three distinct viral proteinases to generate 16 replicase products [reviewed in (Ziebuhr, 2005)]. Both coronavirus and the related arterivirus replicase products have been shown to assemble with cellular membranes to generate double-membrane vesicles that are the sites of viral RNA synthesis (Goldsmith et al., 2004, Gosert et al., 2002, Pedersen et al., 1999, Snijder et al., 2006). The goal of our research is to characterize the coronavirus replicase proteolytic processing cascade and identify factors that mediate membrane-association of the replication complex.",

            "text": "Our model system is the replication of MHV, one of the prototype coronaviruses. MHV is a \u223c 31.5-kilobase (kb) positive-strand RNA virus that replicates in the cytoplasm of infected cells. The 5\u2032-most 22 kb of the MHV genomic RNA contains two large open reading frames (ORFs), termed ORF1a and ORF1b (Lee et al., 1991). During translation of the genomic RNA, the two ORFs are joined via a ribosomal frameshifting mechanism to produce a polyprotein of \u223c 800 kilodaltons (kDa) in size (Brierley et al., 1987, Lee et al., 1991). This polyprotein is the viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, termed the replicase. The MHV replicase is processed by three distinct proteases contained within ORF1a of the replicase polyprotein. Two of the proteases are papain-like cysteine proteases, termed PLP1 and PLP2. The third protease domain is distantly related to the picornavirus family of 3C-like proteases, and is termed 3CLpro. These three proteases process the replicase polyprotein to produce intermediates and products that function in the replication of genomic RNA and the synthesis of a nested set of subgenomic mRNAs [reviewed in (Brian and Baric, 2005, Sawicki and Sawicki, 2005)]. Studies have shown that the replicase products alone are sufficient to mediate viral RNA synthesis (Thiel et al., 2001), and to generate the double-membrane structures that serve as the sites for viral RNA synthesis (Pedersen et al., 1999). However, the role of proteolytic processing in regulating the assembly and function of the MHV replication complex is not yet understood. Therefore, we wanted to identify regions of the replicase polyprotein that may direct or regulate proteolytic processing and/or membrane association. The focus of this study was to identify the regions of MHV nsp3 that direct membrane association and PLP2 activity.",

Other coronaviruses, such as the Human Coronavirus 229E, have been shown to utilize PLP2 (also termed PL2pro) to process sites both upstream and downstream of the catalytic domain (Ziebuhr et al., 2001). The papain-like protease (PLpro) encoded by the coronavirus that causes severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV) processes three sites in the replicase polyprotein (Harcourt et al., 2004), and has recently been shown to have de-ubiquitinating activity (Barretto et al., 2005, Lindner et al., 2005). The crystal structure of this enzyme has been resolved and is currently being targeted for anti-viral drug development (Ratia et al., 2006). A better understanding of the coronavirus papain-like proteases may facilitate anti-viral drug development for SARS and also other recently identified human coronavirus infections caused by NL63 (van der Hoek et al., 2004) and HKU1 (Woo et al., 2005), which can cause pneumonia and respiratory tract infections in children and the elderly.",

We used a trans-cleavage assay to determine if an expressed PLP2 domain was sufficient for the recognition and processing of a substrate containing CS3. We found that constructs containing PLP2 and the downstream putative TM domain were able to efficiently process the substrate. Bioinformatic analysis of the nsp3-TM domain indicated the presence of putative membrane-spanning helices and consensus sites for N-linked glycosylation. Site-directed mutagenesis of the asparagine residues and analysis of endoglycosidase H (endo H) sensitivity revealed that asparagine-2357 in nsp3-TM is glycosylated. To investigate the topology of nsp3-TM, we tested for sensitivity to digestion with proteinase K and found that at least two lumenal domains are protected, consistent with 4 membrane-spanning regions in nsp3-TM. We showed that nsp3-TM alone is sufficient to confer membrane association to a normally cytosolic protein, enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP), and that a predicted multi-spanning TM domain is conserved in nsp3 of all coronaviruses. Thus, the nsp3-TM domain is important for membrane association of the replicase and tethering the PLP2 domain for viral polyprotein processing activity.",

To determine if a similar domain is important for MHV PLP2 activity, we generated a series of PLP2 C-terminal deletion constructs and tested each construct for expression and processing activity. PLP2 expression constructs were generated by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification and cloning of the amplified region into pcDNA3.1/V5-His, as described in Materials and methods. To determine if each clone was expressing a protein of the expected size, we analyzed the products after T7-mediated expression and immunoprecipitation (Fuerst et al., 1986, Kanjanahaluethai and Baker, 2000). We detected the expected series of truncated PLP2 proteins that ranged in size from \u223c 96 kDa to \u223c 50 kDa (Fig. 1B, lanes 1\u20136). To determine if these PLP2 products were sufficient to mediate processing of CS3, we tested each construct in the trans-cleavage assay by co-transfection with the substrate (Fig. 1C, lanes 7\u201312). We found that only two of the PLP2 expression products, pPLP2\u20132485 and pPLP2\u20132390, were able to efficiently process the substrate and produce the 44-kDa cleavage product, nsp4 (Fig. 1C, lanes 7 and 8). These two constructs encompass all or a major part of the predicted nsp3-TM domain indicating that membrane tethering of PLP2 is important for recognition and processing at CS3. Thus, both SARS-CoV PLpro (Harcourt et al., 2004) and MHV PLP2 require the downstream TM domain for recognition and processing at the nsp3/nsp4 junction.",

To extend these studies of membrane association of coronavirus replicase products, we analyzed the amino acid sequence of MHV-JHM nsp3 (from glycine-833 to glycine-2840) for probability of transmembrane helices using the five different programs designed to search for putative membrane-spanning sequences: Phobius, TMHMM, HMMTOP, SOSUI and TMpred (Fig. 2\n). Interestingly, each program generated a unique prediction for the topology of nsp3 (Fig. 2C). The number of predicted membrane-spanning domains varied from three (Phobius) to seven (TMpred). However, since both the N- and C-termini of nsp3 are cleaved in the cytosol, the number of membrane-spanning helices must be either two [as previously predicted (Ziebuhr et al., 2001)], four or six. To better understand the topology of the nsp3-TM domain, we performed membrane-association, fractionation and proteinase K protection experiments.",

The newly translated proteins were metabolically radiolabeled with [35S]-translabel, subjected to centrifugation to separate the membrane-associated pelleted fraction from the soluble fraction. Protein products of both fractions were analyzed by sodium dodecyl sulfate\u2013polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS\u2013PAGE), and visualized by autoradiography (Fig. 3\n). The percentage of total proteins detected in soluble and pelleted fractions was quantitated by phosphoimaging analysis. In the absence of CMM, the translated protein products were detected predominantly in the soluble fraction (Fig. 3A). In contrast, when CMMs were added to the mixture, protein products that included all or part of nsp3-TM (PLP2\u20132485, \u20132390 and \u20132258) were detected predominantly in the pelleted fraction, consistent with membrane association (Fig. 3B). To determine if the membrane association occurred co-translationally or post-translationally, we added the CMMs after termination of translation, and assessed membrane association. Previous studies with hepatitis C virus revealed post-translational insertion of the NS5A replicase protein (Brass et al., 2002). We found that the translation product of PLP2\u20132485 is inserted co-translationally, with no detectable post-translational insertion into membranes (Fig. 3C). These results indicate that MHV nsp3 membrane insertion likely occurs via the normal, signal recognition particle (SRP)-dependent ER translocation mechanism, and not via a tail-anchoring or post-translational mechanism.",

We noted that the protein product expressed from pPLP2\u20132258, which contains only one or two predicted membrane spanning helices, was dissociated by treatment with high pH, but that the protein products expressed from constructs that extended further into the TM were not disrupted from the membranes by these treatments, consistent with the characteristics of integral membrane proteins.",

If one or more of the predicted sequences was indeed a transmembrane helix, then the sites for N-linked glycosylation could be lumenal, and subject to modification. To determine if either of the putative sites was modified by glycosylation, we subjected the proteins expressed from wild-type pPLP2\u2013Cen (Kanjanahaluethai and Baker, 2000) and two asparagine-to-alanine substitution mutants to endo H treatment (Fig. 5\n). Expressed proteins were radiolabeled with [35S]-translabel, lysates were prepared, and subjected to immunoprecipitation with anti-V5 antibody as described in Materials and methods. The PLP2\u2013Cen protein was either untreated, or treated with endo H for 16 h, then analyzed for mobility by electrophoresis through a 5% polyacrylamide gel. We found that the untreated wild-type protein migrated at approximately 110 kDa (lane 1). However, after digestion with endo H, the protein migrated at 108 kDa (lane 2), consistent with the loss of one N-linked modification. The PLP2\u2013Cen\u2013N2357A protein with an asparagine-to-alanine substitution migrated more quickly than the wild type or N2281A protein, indicating that N2357 is the site modified by N-linked glycosylation (compare lanes 3\u20135). Furthermore, proteins generated by endo H treatment of the pPLP2\u2013Cen\u2013N2357A and pPLP2\u2013Cen\u2013N2281A migrated more quickly than wild type PLP2\u2013Cen (lanes 6\u20138). These results indicate that nsp3 is glycosylated at asparagine-2357. Overall, these experiments demonstrate that nsp3-TM does have transmembrane and lumen sequences that can tether the PLP2 domain to intracellular membranes.",

Cytosolic domains are sensitive to proteinase K, whereas transmembrane and lumenal domains are protected from digestion with proteinase K. Analysis of PLP2\u20132485 revealed two major fragments of 28 kDa and 10 kDa protected from proteinase K digestion (Fig. 6\n, lane 2). We noted the predicted size of the TM domain from K2227-Y2469 is 28.0 kDa, and the predicted size of the K2227-I2308 (A and B helices) is 9.6 kDa. Analysis of PLP2\u20132390 revealed two protected fragments of 19 kDa and 10 kDa, respectively (Fig. 6, lane 4). The predicted size of the K2227-S2390 fragment is 18.8 kDa. By combining the results of the integral membrane assays (Fig. 3, Fig. 4), the glycosylation assay (Fig. 5), and the proteinase K sensitivity assay (Fig. 6A), we were able to generate a topology model for nsp3-TM that is consistent with all the data (Figs. 6B and C). Our results indicate that nsp3-TM has four membrane-spanning sequences and two lumenal domains (Fig. 6B) and that the 10 kDa fragment likely represents the proteinase K resistant fragment generated by the first two membrane-spanning sequences. Our model is most similar to the predicted models generated by the TMHMM and SOSUI programs with the exception that the fourth predicted membrane-spanning sequence (which is the only domain not consistent in these two predictions) is not a membrane-spanning sequence, but instead remains lumenal, and the final membrane-spanning domain is in the reverse orientation. Our results, and the results of others (Hugle et al., 2001, Miller et al., 2006), demonstrate the importance of experimental validation of bioinformatics predictions of membrane-spanning sequences. For example, in the case of Dengue virus type 2 nonstructural protein 4B, Miller and co-workers found that two computer-predicted transmembrane helices were in fact lumenal and one was glycosylated (Miller et al., 2006). In addition, we note the value of using multiple programs to better estimate the complexity of the bioinformatic prediction. The differences in the predicted models could then be tested experimentally. Here, we provide an initial model of nsp3-TM that should be refined by further experimentation. Similar studies should also be performed to determine the topology of nsp4 and nsp6, the other coronavirus replicase products with multiple predicted transmembrane helices.",

We found that appending the MHV nsp3-TM sequence to EGFP was sufficient to tether it to membranes, as shown by the intense, perinuclear localized signal (Fig. 7B). To determine if the nsp3-TM domain is retained in the ER membranes or is transported through the medial Golgi, we radiolabeled the EFGP\u2013nsp3TM protein in transfected cells, immunoprecipitated the protein and subjected the immunoprecipitated products to endo H. We found that EFGP\u2013nsp3TM is sensitive to treatment with endo H, indicating that the protein is retained in the ER and does not pass through the medial Golgi. Thus, the nsp3-TM domain is sufficient to confer membrane-localization and retention in the ER.

            "text": "In summary, using biochemical fractionation and proteinase K protection assays, we show that nsp3-TM likely has four membrane-spanning domains, and that lumenal residue asparagine-2357 is modified by glycosylation. Furthermore, we found the region nsp3-TM domain is required for efficient MHV PLP2 process activity at cleavage site 3 in the polyprotein. Why does MHV PLP2 require membrane association for proteolytic processing of the PLP2 cleavage site? One possible explanation is that membrane-tethering brings PLP2 into close proximity with a membrane-associated substrate. It is also possible that the nsp3-TM membrane tether is important for anchoring the replicase complex to intracellular membranes. Bioinformatic analysis of the nsp3 of 10 other coronaviruses revealed that the membrane-spanning features of nsp3-TM are conserved in all viruses (Fig. 8\n, analysis using the TMHMM program is shown as an example), even though the amino acid identity is relatively low (18\u201332% identity within nsp3). Therefore, the TM domain is likely to be important for both PLP2 activity and assembly of the replication complex. Further studies will be required to determine the precise topology of the TM domain in other coronaviruses, and if the lumenal sequences in nsp3-TM play any role in interacting with host factors during viral replication.",

(B) The proposed model of proteinase K protection to PLP2\u20132485 translation product. Arrowheads depict potential proteinase K cleavage sites. The tree symbol () represents the experimentally confirmed N-linked glycosylation site of asparagine at position 2357. The putative membrane-spanning regions A, B, C, D, and E of the nsp3 TM domain are depicted by gray circles. (C) The proposed model of PK protection of PLP2\u20132390 translation product.",
