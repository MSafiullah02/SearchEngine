            "text": "As the aging society is approaching for the most populated country in the world, the medical services and public health become a more important issue for China. Due to the miracle of economic development after the reform and open-up policy since 1978, the health status and outcome has already been improved in China. According to the World Development Indicators (WDI), life expectancy in China increased from 66.5 years in 1978 to 73.5 years in 2011, and infant mortality rate decreased from 5.3% to 1.3% during the same period (World Bank, 2013). However, the development of health care has long been lagging in China (Eggleston, 2012, Li et al., 2014). With the increasing demand on high-quality medical services, the medical care sector of China has still been blamed for the high fee and low accessibility of medical services after the market-orientated reform started from 1985 in this sector. It even has been regarded as a failure by some researchers in China (Eggleston et al., 2008, State Council, 2005, Wagstaff et al., 2009b). At present, despite there is broad agreement on that the system needs reform, there is less agreement on the causes of the system's failure and the reforms necessary to improve it (Eggleston et al., 2008). Therefore, it is urgent and necessary to make an overall evaluation for the passing reform and search for solutions to present challenges.",

Meanwhile, monitoring the ef\ufb01ciency performance of Chinese hospitals can provide useful information for assessing the effectiveness of health policies and measures, and also as a way to achieve sustainable development in the most cost-effective way. Moreover, the Chinese hospitals were always the first priority in the medical reform, which have undergone series of reform and deregulation in last three decades. More details are present in the contextual setting part. Therefore, it is worthwhile to investigate the reform's effects on cost efficiency of Chinese hospitals.",

            "text": "For the important role that the hospitals have played in the medical sector, greater attention has been given to hospital efficiency and a growing number of studies have employed SFA to analyze cost-inefficiency in hospitals (Barros et al., 2013, Hollingsworth, 2008, Hsu, 2013, Hwang and Akdede, 2011, Jacobs, 2001). However, focus on efficiency of Chinese hospitals has not been well discussed until recent years. Eggleston et al. (2008) and Wagstaff, Yip, et al. (2009) have identified dozens of issues in the medical sector of China and concluded that Chines hospitals were quite inefficient through literature review. Recently, several researches have analyzed the productive efficiency of Chinese hospitals in the post reform period with empirical method (Audibert et al., 2013, Hu et al., 2012, Ng, 2011). According to these researches, the efficiency of Chinese hospitals varies from different provinces and different year. And the overall efficiency had slightly increased before 2008. However, all of them only use the non-parametric method, i.e. Data Envelop Analysis (DEA) to analyze the efficiency of Chinese hospitals. However, this method cannot handle the noise and outliers in the data, which may strongly influence the shape of the frontier. It also suffers from the inability to test statistically for goodness of fit or significance of variables included in the functions. Meanwhile, the Stochastic Frontier Analysis (SFA) can overcome these limitations, despite being criticized for requiring a pre-defined functional form in the estimation of the frontier. And Coelli, Prasada Rao, and Battese (1998) argue that SFA is more powerful than DEA in panel data applications as it can be used to measure the efficiency and technical change over time. Therefore, we use the SFA to overcome the inherent drawbacks of DEA and make a robust check. To improve the methodological accuracies, recent studies have extended the use of the SFA methodology through introducing Bayesian stochastic frontier (SF) methodology (Assaf, Gillen, & Barros, 2012).2\nThe Bayesian SF model incorporates informative priors and use prior knowledge to inform the current model. And small sample inference is carried out in the same way as if one had access to a large sample. The estimation is unbiased with respect to the sample size. However, quite a little literature on the hospital efficiency uses the Bayesian stochastic frontier (SF) model, except Koop, Osiewalski, and Steel (1997). Following Tsionas (2002) and Assaf (2011), we adopt the Bayesian SF model with random coefficients in this paper. Comparing with traditional SFA and DEA, the Bayesian SF model with random coefficients that capture the unobserved heterogeneity and is more close to the reality, which will assure the efficiency is correctly estimated for separating technical inefficiency from technological differences across hospitals. And Pereira de Souza, Diallo, Castro Souza, and Baidya (2010) analyze the 60 Brazilian electricity distribution utilities with DEA and Bayesian SF and conclude that the DEA results are vulnerable to outlier while the results under Bayesian SF are more credible. Therefore, we are motivated to adopt Bayesian SF model to analyze the efficiency of Chinese hospitals.",

(2012) use the Tobit model to analyze the effects of some factors on the efficiency of Chinese hospitals, including the coastal location, public subsidies, the social medical insurance reform, the ratio of third-class hospitals to total hospitals and etc. And they conclude that the former two have insignificant effect on improving the technical efficiency, while the latter two significantly promote the technical efficiency. However, they use the traditional DEA to estimate the efficiency score in the first step. Moreover, McDonald (2009) argues that the use of Tobit regression was considered inappropriate in the second stage of DEA. This was because technical efficiency is fraction data and not generated by a censoring process. Therefore, it still needs more rigorous research to act as robust check.",

The medical care system of China was characterized by \u201cprevention first\u201d, community organization and cooperative financing (Hsiao, 1995). Medical service was delivered through a three-tier organization system, the street (sub-district), district and municipal level hospitals in urban areas as well as the village health stations, township health centers and county hospitals in rural areas. There was also a three-tier health insurance system that consisted of publicly-funded medical care, labor insurance medical care and cooperative medical care schemes (Dong, 2001, Dong, 2009). The publicly-funded medical care, which was also called Government Insurance Schemes, covers civil servant, employees of public enterprises, military offices and university students. And the labor insurance medical care covers workers in state-owned and collective companies. Moreover, the cooperative medical care schemes cover the rural population and collapsed in 1990s (Audibert et al., 2013). In this period, the price of medical service was kept low by the Central Price Commission. People's needs for basic medical service had been satisfied, which helped to improve their health status (Hsiao, 1995). However, the 10 years\u2019 Culture Revolution began in 1966. This undermined the medical care system. As the economic reform moved forward, the government put first priority on economic development when the local government was given more autonomy and competed for economic growth, rather than public services like medical care (Audibert et al., 2013, Dong, 2001). As a result, the development of the medical care system was challenged by limited public funds and the rapid expansion of medical expenditures (Dong, 2009).",

This gave existing hospitals more autonomy and raised the price of medical service, reducing the restrictions on the supply of medical service (Yip & Hsiao, 2009). Meanwhile, the MOH of China also strengthened the quality of medical service through stipulating a regulation on hospital grading in late of 1989, namely certificating hospitals in China every three year in different grade according to their capacity to supply high-quality medical service. Later in 1992, the MOH of China granted further substantial financial autonomy to hospitals, encouraging the hospitals to increase their revenue by offering higher quality service and allowing hospitals to transform to modern companies and set joint ventures. After these reforms, new hospitals began to spring up and the supply of medical service largely increased (World Bank, 2010). As the regulation and entry barriers, the number of private hospitals had not increased a lot until 2001 when the government abolished some limitations. And up to March 2013, there are 10166 private hospitals in China.3\nHowever, the public hospitals still maintain the dominant position in the healthcare sector of China (Gu & Zhang, 2006). At the same time, China began market and commercialization reform in the medical care system. Negative externalities quickly began to emerge, including the poor access and high costs of medical service (Audibert et al., 2013, Eggleston et al., 2008).",

The State Council implemented the pilot reform of basic social medical insurance scheme (BSMIS) for urban employees in Jiangsu and Jiangxi province. This was applied to the whole country in 1998. In 2003, the new rural cooperative medical system (NRCMS) was implemented in the four provinces by the State Council. Both BSMIS and NRCMS are different from the traditional medical care insurance before 1978. And there are individual responsibility of premium contribution and individual accounts in the new schemes. For more details, see Dong (2009). In 2000, the State Council announced different policies for both for-profit and non-profit hospitals, lifting restrictions on public hospitals, separating pharmacies from medical practices. Before this reform, the hospitals always sold patients medicine at high price, so that to increase the revenue of hospitals and relieve the limits of low fiscal budgets on hospitals. This situation was also described as \u201cmedicine-supported-hospitals\u201d in China. With the outbreak of SARS (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndromes) in 2003 and the scandal of expenses in medical service, the MOH finally made a prudent review on the medical care system in China and admitted the low coverage of the medical insurance and the failure of market-orientation reform in medical care industry.",

And the milestone in this period is the publication of new scheme for medical care reform in 2009. The government promised to increase the fiscal subsidies rather than rely on market to sufficiently satisfy people's needs for basic medical services. Meanwhile, it would investment 850 million yuan in the next two years to deepen the reform, including accelerating the establishment of basic medical care insurance system and essential drug system, improving the community-level medical service system, increasing the equalization in the public medical services and the pilot experiments on public hospital reforms.",

            "text": "Hospital efficiency analysis is an important issue within the field of health economics. There are two contemporary approaches to measure cost efficiency of hospitals: the parametric approach and the non-parametric approach. The most used parametric method is SFA, while the popular non-parametric approach is DEA (Barros et al., 2008, Wei et al., 2011, Yu et al., 2013, Zhang and Choi, 2013, Zhu et al., 2014). However, Tsionas (2002) and Assaf (2011) argue that these traditional methods have inherent limitations that assume that all hospitals operate under the same production or cost technology in the estimation of efficiency, while in practice this is not true and might lead to incorrect efficiency estimates. Battese and Rao (2002) have begun to use the metafrontier approach to take account of the different production technology when estimating the efficiency and productivity. And it has brought out a large strand of literature. However, this metafrontier approach has inherent deficiency that requires prior knowledge of different groups of the DMUs (Kumbhakar, Wang, & Horncastle, 2015). Therefore, we adopt the Bayesian SF model with random coefficients that was introduced by Tsionas (2002). It assumes that each hospital is allowed different intercepts as well as slope coefficients. The main purpose of the model is to improve the accuracy in the efficiency estimation by separating the cost-efficiency estimates from heterogeneity among hospitals. This model is different from the Bayesian fixed frontier model, introduced by Koop et al. (1997), which assumes that all hospitals share exactly the same production possibilities (i.e. no heterogeneity between hospitals).",

Therefore, any sample size can be accommodated, no matter how small. The estimation is unbiased with respect to sample size.

This is evidence that subsidies are an incentive to reduce cost efficiency rather than inducing moral hazards. On the contrary, Hu et al. (2012) argued that the government subsidy has ambiguous and insignificant effects on the Chinese hospital efficiency. And Chen, Yamauchi, Kato, Nishimura, and Ito (2006) claimed that the government subsidy of public hospitals in China was very low and the survival pressure from market competition was higher. And it would not lead to the moral risks and inefficiency when increasing the government subsidy. As the contextual setting part and World Bank (2010) show, public hospitals still control the majority of the market share in medical industry. And they are very popular among people and preferred to private hospitals for more talented doctors, better medical equipment, higher guarantee for medical negligence and etc. Therefore, it favors increasing the cost efficiency of Chinese hospitals when raising the government fiscal budgets on medical care system.",

In other words, the social medical insurance reform has a positive influence on the efficiency of Chinese hospitals decreasing costs, which is consistent with the empirical results of Hu et al.

The medical insurance reform of the NRCMS and BSMIP has increase the opportunity of the poor to acquire the medical service, namely the government subsidy people to get the basic medical service and therefore increasing the demand for medical service as well as the output of the hospitals. Wagstaff and Lindelow (2008) and Wagstaff, Lindelow, Jun, Ling, and Juncheng (2009a) also witnessed the increase in the medical service utilization after the reform.

It concludes that raising the subsidy to the hospital and increasing the coverage of social medical insurance both will promote the cost efficiency, while the coastal location and raising the proportion of 3A hospitals both have positive influence on increasing the costs.
