SARS-CoV-2 testing evolved during the period described. Through 16 April 2020 4023 tests were completed at UCSF, with 144 (3.5%) positive results. Initially, the hospital had limited capacity to run in-house RT-PCR assays, which required up to 24 hours for results. Overflow tests were sent to a nearby hospital with up to a 5-day turn-around time. This rendered it nearly impossible to obtain results in a timely fashion prior to a deceased donor transplant. Over the course of the next several weeks, testing capacity and speed improved significantly. At the time of writing, RT-PCR testing was performed on the ePlex system that required 2.5-3 hours per run. By mid-April, we were testing all potential recipients and donors and had developed a system to expedite processing pre-transplant. Our current policy is to screen all transplant recipients and living donors within 4 days of their operation. For recipients of deceased donor organs, we recommend early admission to provide additional time for COVID-19 testing while minimizing cold ischemia time.",

Shortly thereafter UCSF established a transfer manager, whose authorization was required for any transfer from another facility. UCSF also designated a separate unit for patients with COVID-19. Transfers are restricted to patients who urgently needed specialized care. As a result, beginning in February 2020 the number of transplant patients being transferred has decreased notably on the kidney service (6 a month) but remained stable on the liver service (18 a month) ( Figure 1 ). The exact reasons for this change are not clear, but we hypothesize that this difference is attributable to the fact that the post-operative kidney complications were more readily managed via telephone advice to outside facilities, whereas many post-operative liver complications required specialized interventional radiology or endoscopic interventions that could not be performed ",

The UCSF Mission Bay campus, which houses BCH, is a clinical site dedicated to pediatric, oncology, and obstetrics/gynecology specialty care.

We felt that the rapid nature of such procurements, often with extubation in the operating room, posed a higher and perhaps unreasonable risk of exposure. Furthermore, we ruled out donors with respiratory symptoms or ground-glass opacities on chest CT. Despite uniform donor testing, there is a false negative rate of 20-30% on COVID-19 assays 5 , so we declined donors with any symptoms consistent with COVID-19 infection. Even with these precautions, travel to and operating in another hospital increases the exposure risk. Beginning in mid-March, we elected to use local organ recovery whenever possible, a practice which is now recommended by the United Network for Organ Sharing (UNOS) effective 28 March 2020 6 .

This rounding model was inconsistent with the need for social distancing, and these multidisciplinary rounds were drastically restructured using Zoom videoconferencing (San Jose, CA).

If COVID-19 is ruled out, they are transferred to the transplant service. Recipients who are deemed low-risk for COVID-19 but are admitted with fevers are admitted to the transplant service. The first such patient, a post-liver patient with reported temperatures to 102 F at home and a history of recent biliary stent placement, was admitted 8 March 2020. He was met on arrival by nursing staff wearing personal protective equipment (PPE), a mask was placed on him, and he was brought to the transplant unit, where droplet precautions were instituted until his COVID-19 test resulted negative.",

            "text": "face contacts between a pharmacist and a patient's caretakers. Hospital restrictions on visitors since 14 March 2020 have drastically altered our workflow, and patient education is now being completed entirely by videoconferencing with individual patients and their families, typically via cell phone group chat functions. This requires a pharmacist on one device, the patient on another, and the family on a third device. If the patient or family are not primarily English speakers, a HIPAA-compliant language line consultant is added to the group chat to translate. A reliable Internet connection, video camera, and videoconferencing software are necessary to optimize this education strategy. As part of our hospital-wide discharge policy, family members have been completing patient education sessions on day-of-discharge from designated waiting areas on the hospital campus. This has presented issues with dropped calls in areas without strong cellular signal despite on-campus WiFi. Possible solutions include a designated oncampus site with reliable Internet connectivity or establishment of an on-campus, contactless computer terminal with an established videoconferencing connection to the pharmacist and patient. Although these virtual education sessions can be accomplished while caretakers are logged on from their home Internet connection, variable home Internet services on a patient-topatient basis pose similar connectivity issues. Efforts to decrease the number of connections per call, such as including an in-person translator on the pharmacist's line, may help to further improve videoconferencing quality. While each patient room has a computer workstation for the nursing care, many lack a video camera. When a patient does not have their own phone, the hospital has provided an iPad. Some family members have encountered difficulty with downloading the Zoom application. Several workflow changes can be incorporated to streamline the education process. Patients and their caretakers can be provided reading materials and electronic resources in advance of videoconferencing education sessions. This has previously proven effective in transplant medication education as an adjunct to in-person teaching 10,11 , and may offload some of the education burden from the pharmacist pool. Group education sessions covering general immunosuppression information could be conducted in a webinar to educate multiple caretakers simultaneously in advance of individualized sessions. A standard \"read-back\" policy can also help to ensure two-way communication to demonstrate comprehension during teaching sessions.",

The UCSF transplant program performed 389 kidney transplants (34% living donor), 174 liver transplants (12% living donor), and 15 pancreas transplants in 2019. Our Transplant Center actively follows approximately 7000 kidney transplant recipients, 3000 liver transplant recipients, and 300 pancreas transplant recipients. Between 3 February 2020 and 15 April 2020, we completed 49 deceased donor kidney transplants, 18 living donor kidney transplants, 18 laparoscopic donor nephrectomies, 29 deceased donor liver transplants, 4 living donor liver transplants. 4 donor hepatectomies, 3 simultaneous liver-kidney transplants, 1 kidney-pancreas transplant, 1 total pancreatectomy auto-islet cell transplant, and 2 kidney autotransplants. At time of organ offers, patients were provided the risks and benefits of undergoing transplantation in the setting of the COVID-19 pandemic, and were given the opportunity to defer transplantation per patient preference.",

In order to continue transplantation while protecting immunocompromised patients and healthcare workers, significant restructuring of normal patient care practice habits is required.Methods: This is a non-randomized, descriptive study of the abdominal transplant program at one academic center (University of California, San Francisco) and the programmatic changes undertaken to safely continue transplantations. Patient transfers, fellow utilization, and patient discharge education were identified as key areas requiring significant reorganization.",
