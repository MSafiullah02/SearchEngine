The couple was treated successfully in an intensive care unit (ICU) at medical center A. Subsequently, most SARS patients were treated at that medical center, until two clusters of cases were noted in late April, 2003, in Taipei. The origin of the outbreak was a laundry worker, aged 42 years, with diabetes mellitus, who was employed at hospital B. 7 As the index patient had been symptomatic for 6 days before SARS was diagnosed, the number of potentially exposed persons was estimated to be 10,000 patients and visitors, and 930 staff. Within less than 2 weeks, another outbreak of SARS clusters occurred in hospital C, which is near hospital B. Taipei Veterans General Hospital undertook the care of critically ill SARS patients, who were mainly transferred from hospital B and hospital C. The cause of SARS is a novel coronavirus.

To date, however, no large, formal analysis of the data from Taiwan can Since our hospital was responsible for the management of critical cases in northern Taiwan, the outcomes shown were more severe than in other medical settings. Initial clinical presentations and laboratory features were similar to those in other series. Symptoms of acute respiratory distress developed in about half of the patients (33/67; 49.3%); 21 of these patients (63.6%) died and the other 12 were discharged from hospital. The risk factors for ARDS were age more than 65 years, diabetes mellitus, and elevated LDH level. Other researchers have also documented independent predictors associated with poor outcomes, e.g. acute illness leading to death; the need for mechanical ventilation; and ICU admission. 2 The diagnosis of SARS was based on a comprehensive contact history and precise laboratory tests. The World Health Organization diagnostic criteria for SARS have a reported sensitivity of 26% and specificity of 96%, 14 whereas the sensitivity of laboratory testing for SARS-CoV is less than 80%. 15 Since contact history has not been reliable after SARS cluster cases were noted in some community groups, one needed to be highly suspicious of any transmission of pneumonia. Our inclusion criteria added a component of transmission of pneumonia, and a high degree of clinical diagnostic accuracy was confirmed by laboratory tests. Hematologic abnormalities, especially lymphopenia, were common in our cohort, probably because of ribavirin therapy. Intravenous immunoglobulin was given when more severe hematologic abnormalities occurred. Pancytopenia and hemophagocytosis were noted in 2 patients without ARDS.

The efficacy of treatment was difficult to evaluate because patients usually received a combination of medications, including antiviral, broad-spectrum antibacterial and corticosteroid drugs, in addition to supportive therapy. Initially, because the cause of SARS was thought to be an atypical pathogen, 55 patients (82.1%) received empiric antibacterial therapy with a fluoroquinolone. Levofloxacin was the drug of choice in 49 patients (73.1%) because of its broad-spectrum activity against anaerobic and aerobic Gram-positive and Gramnegative bacteria.
