However, according to the official diagnosis and treatment protocol by the National Health Commission of China [16], CT examination represents a useful tool not only in diagnosing but also in monitoring progression and therapeutic efficacy. To support this, Miao et al [17] demonstrated that the presence of diffuse ground-glass opacities could be useful in the identification and differential diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2-related pneumonia, allowing to alert clinicians for prompt treatment and repeat the RT-PCR test until the end of the incubation. Zhao et al [18], by evaluating a cohort of 101 patients, established that patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2-related pneumonia showed typical imaging features that could be helpful in early screening of highly suspected cases. Moreover, according to Fang et al [19], the sensitivity of chest CT was statistically greater than RT-PCR (98% vs 71%), encouraging the use of CT as a screening test in patients with clinical and epidemiological features compatible with SARS-CoV-2 infection. The RT-PCR test can show a low efficiency probably due to the low viremia and the unsuitable clinical sampling. On these bases, as suggested by our results, CT plays an important role both in diagnosis, especially the differential, and in clinically suspected patients with negative chest radiograph due to its intrinsic higher sensitivity. Finally, even if different studies evaluated the role of CT as a routine imaging modality for diagnosis or screening, the use of CT is rather complex, especially in the Emergency Department, first of all, due to time-consuming decontamination procedures to be completed in the CT room among different patients [10].",
