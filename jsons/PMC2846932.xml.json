            "text": "Lectins are carbohydrate-binding proteins that specifically recognize diverse sugar structures and mediate a variety of biological processes [1,2]. Lectin proteins contain at least one carbohydrate-binding domain. Based on this, three major types of lectins are distinguished, namely merolectins, hololectins and chimerolectins [3]. The merolectins have only single carbohydrate-binding domain and the hololectins contain two or more domains which are either identical or very homologous. The chimerolectins are fusion proteins consisting of one or more carbohydrate-binding domains and unrelated domains. Lectins are ubiquitous in nature, found in all kinds of organisms, from virus to humans [4]. Plant lectins are usually considered as a very heterogeneous group of proteins because comparative biochemical studies clearly indicate that they differ from each other with respect to their biochemical/physicochemical properties, molecular structure, carbohydrate-binding specificity and biological activities [5]. Therefore, it is difficult to find a widely acceptable way to classify plant lectins. Currently, several attempts have been made to group plant lectins. One of them was based on the carbohydrate-binding specificity. As a result, mannose- mannose/glucose-, mannose/maltose-, Gal/GalNAc, GlcNAc/(GlcNAc)n-, fucose- and salic acid-binding lectins have been distinguished ([5,6]. This classification emphasizes the use of lectins as tools with different carbohydrate-binding specificity. However, evolutionarily unrelated lectins may also be classified together. Besides this, another classification has been suggested, which is based on 3D structures of lectins. They classified lectins as 6 major groups including \u03b1-D-mannose-specific plant lectin (monocot lectin), agglutinin with hevein domain, \u03b2-prism plant lectin, \u03b2-trefoil lectin, cyanovirin-N homolog and legume lectin http://www.cermav.cnrs.fr/lectines/. Besides these, a more complicated classification system has been proposed which is based on either serological relationships or sequence similarities or both as well as their evolutionary relationships. Based on such criterion, 7 lectin families have been classified including the legume lectins, the monocot mannose-binding lectins, the chitin-binding lectins, the type 2 RIP and related lectins, jacalin-related lectins, Amaranthin lectins and Cucurbitaceae phloem lectins [6]. Recently, these authors made an update of the system since many new plant lectins have been isolated and characterized [7]. They have classified plant lectins into 12 families and at least one member in each family has been characterized in some detail and we named this system as \"system 1\". These families are as follows: ABA (Agaricus bisporus agglutinin), Amaranthin, CRA (chitinase-related agglutinin), Cyanovirin, EEA (Euonymus europaeus agglutinin), GNA (Galanthus nivalis agglutinin), Hevein, Jacalins, Legume lectin, LysM (lysin motif), Nictaba and Ricin_B families. However, the classification system was based on the available plant lectin information and animal lectins were not used to explore lectin-like members in the plant genomes.",

Currently, soybean genome has also been completely sequenced (Soybean Genome Project, DoE Joint Genome Institute, http://www.phytozome.net/soybean). Up to now, genomes from 110 eukaryotes, 844 bacterial and 63 archaeal have been completely sequenced and published and the sequencing for 1028 eukaryotes, 2606 bacterial and 96 archaeal genomes are in progress based on the genome online database V 2.0 ([14]; http://www.genomesonline.org/gold.cgi, June 8, 2009). All these data provide us additional information to further analyze the lectin superfamily in their molecular evolution, classification and biological functions. However, limited data has been reported on the genome-wide characterization and molecular evolution of this superfamily in plants. As a result, little is known on the outline of all lectin genes in a completely sequenced plant genome and no new classification system has been proposed on the basis of the whole genome sequence information.",

            "text": "On the other hand, another major question that one may concern is on the biological functions of plant lectins. Many reviews or books have summarized the possible functions of plant lectins [4-6,15-18]. However, no definitive answers have been given. Generally, plant lectins have both internal and external activities [17]. The former refers to the functions acting within the plants during various developmental processes such as interactions with storage proteins or enzymes [17]. The latter includes the roles of lectins in response to various biotic and abiotic stresses. Evidence has shown the insecticidal activity of lectins against a spectrum of insects [19-24]. Some of lectin genes could be used for improving plant tolerance/resistance to various insects by transgenic technology [22,25-33]. However, such a desired effect in crop protection was not observed in some cases [34-36]. The protection functions of lectins against other biotic stresses were also reported including fungi [37-42] and virus [43,44]. Plant lectins are not only assumed to be part of the defense system [3,45], they have been also implicated as playing an important role in mediating recognition and specificity in the symbiosis with root nodule bacteria [46-49]. Besides biotic stresses, plant lectins may also play roles in abiotic stresses [50]. Reports have shown that several lectin genes exhibit differential expression abundance under various abiotic stresses including temperature shock, drought and high salinity stresses [51-56].",

In this report, we first identified and characterized all lectin genes encoded by the soybean, rice and Arabidopsis genomes. We then proposed a new classification system on the basis of protein domain structures and phylogenetic analyses. We also evaluated their expansion mechanisms and evolutionary history by investigating their duplication and/or transposition history. Subsequently, we examined their expression by full-length cDNA, Expression Sequence Tag (EST), microarray and Massively Parallel Signature Sequencing (MPSS [57]) datasets. Finally, we investigated their expression divergence under various stresses to further annotate their biological functions. Our analyses advance the understanding of plant lectin genes as being involved in lineage-specific expansion, and that they function in biotic and abiotic stress-related developmental processes. We also identified putative new lectin genes which were not be experimentally detected at present in plant genomes and provided a new outline of the plant lectin gene superfamily.",

To better understand their expansion history and expression divergence, two other genomes were also selected for comparative analyses including rice (model plant for monocot) and Arabidopsis (model plant for dicot) genomes. We have used both BLAST and Hidden Markov model (HMM) searches (Methods) to identify lectin members presented in these genomes. After multiple cycles of searches, total of 349, 339 and 204 putative lectin genes have been detected in soybean, rice and Arabidopsis, respectively. These members were then subjected to the Pfam ([58]; http://pfam.sanger.ac.uk/) and SMART ([59]; http://smart.embl-heidelberg.de/) databases to confirm the presence of corresponding domains. The analysis revealed some members with incomplete domain structures, which have been confirmed by both domain searches and manual check. These members contain no typical domain structure and have no expression evidence with the characters of pseudogenes. Due to the low feasibility of phylogenetic analyses by integrating these partial fragments, we removed these members from our analyses although we may under-estimate the rate of gene duplication. Thus, our analyses reveal that soybean, rice and Arabidopsis genomes encode total of 309, 267 and 199 members of lectin superfamilies (Figure 1A). Their locus name, physical position and annotated protein sequences were deposited in the Additional file 1 (soybean), 2 (rice) and 3 (Arabidopsis).",

In most cases, each family has a Pfam domain ID as shown in Figure 1A. However, no domain ID has been detected for the phloem and EEA families. The phloem domain was first structurally identified by Dinant et al. (2003) [60] with 4 conserved motifis and is characterized by a high frequency of charged residues and seven conserved Trp residues although phloem lectins were described in the seventies. Similarly, the EUL (Euonymus lectin) domain in the EEA family was recently identified [7,61] although the family members were described more than 20 years ago [62]. Among the total 12 identified families, both B_lectin and Lectin_legB are the largest families for soybean and rice. However, in Arabidopsis, the largest one is the Jacalin family followed by Lectin_legB, B_lectin and Phloem families (Figure 1A). The smallest families contain only one or two members including Lectin_C, Ricin_B_Lectin and EEA families (Figure 1).",

We have detected 2 members of the lectin_C family lectins in soybean and one member in both rice and Arabidopsis (Figure 1). Expression evidence is from EST for 2 soybean members and from full-length cDNAs for rice and Arabidopsis members, suggesting their presence in plants.

However, their domain amino acid sequences share low identities (around 30%) when compared with the most closely related domains from animals. Thus, their functions as lectins should be demonstrated by testing their activities. We have randomly selected one of these newly identified lectin members for further analyses. This gene was named as LOC_Os03g06940 and contains two domains including both Glyco_hydro_35 and Gal_lectin (Figure 3A). The cDNA sequences from different domain regions were cloned into the expression vector pGEX-6p. The GST fusion proteins were expressed in the Escherichia coli BL21 (Figure 3B). The recombinant protein extracts were used for detecting lectin activities by hemagglutination testing (Figure 3C-F). This method has been widely used for testing the lectin activity [55,67]. Our data show that the Gal_lectin domain indeed exhibits the agglutination activity whereas the Glyco_hydro_35 domain has no this function.

The phylogenetic tree was then broken down into ancestral units, which were clades that were present before the divergence of these organisms according to the method described by Shiu et al (2004) [68]. The nodes of the most recent common ancestor (MRCA) were labeled with solid red circles between soybean and Arabidopsis and with black circles among 3 analyzed organisms (Figure 4A). We found that there were 9 ancestral units among 105 soybean and 38 Arabidopsis B-lectin members; however, only 5 MRCAs have been detected among total of 230 B-lectin family members from these three organisms (Figure 4A). The result indicated that the ancestral organism contained small family of B-lectin members and suggested that the large scale of expansions occurred after the divergence from their ancestors. A similar method was used for searching the lectin members of the ancestral organism for the remaining 8 families of lectins. The analysis showed that the ancestral organism between two dicot plants or among these three organisms also contained small numbers of lectin families (Figure 4B).

            "text": "To investigate the contribution of tandem duplication to the expansion of lectin genes, we examined the chromosomal distribution of members in each family of all three organisms. Such analyses show that many genes are clustered together according to the criterion as described in Methods section, suggesting that they were the results of tandem duplication. Totally, we have detected 131 (43%), 140 (55%) and 110 (551%) lectin genes being involving in tandemly duplicated events in soybean, rice and Arabidopsis, respectively (Figure 5). On the other hand, we also genome-widely identified segmental duplications in soybean, rice and Arabidopsis genomes and then searched the duplication blocks that contain lectin genes. In this case, tandemly arrayed genes were treated as a single gene copy. We have detected total of 71 segmental blocks and their duplicated blocks with the same family of lectin genes in soybean (Additional file 4_sheet1). These genes were from total of 11 different families. One of the families is the Lectin_C and only one member was detected in both rice and Arabidopsis. However, two members were detected in soybean, which was due to the segmental duplication as shown in the Additional file 4_sheet1. Similarly, we have 19 and 15 segmental and their duplicated blocks with lectin genes in rice and Arabidopsis, respectively (Additional file 4_sheet 2 and 3). In summary, we have detected total of 181 (59%), 105 (40%) and 85 (43%) lectin genes being involving in segmentally duplicated events in soybean, rice and Arabidopsis, respectively (Figure 5). These data suggested that both tandem and segmental duplications play a major role in lectin gene expansions. Further investigation showed that some tandemly duplicated genes were also within segmentally duplicated regions with overlaps between these two duplications. Figure 5 summarizes the contributions of tandem and segmental duplications to the expansions of various lectin gene families in three different organisms. Generally, the highest contribution rate was observed in soybean with up to 84% of lectin genes were involved in tandem and/or segmental duplications and the remaining 16% of lectin genes were from other mechanisms. In both rice and Arabidopsis, similar results were observed with around 28% and 34% of lectin genes were from other mechanisms in general (Figure 5). However, the contributions of tandem and segmental duplications to lectin expansions differ among different lectin families. For example, only 12-24% of B-lectin family members were from the other expansion mechanisms while the corresponding percentage has been up to 25-37% for Lectin_legB family (Figure 5). Furthermore, a same family also exhibits differences in their expansions among three organisms. For example, 14 of 15 Gal_Bind_1 family members were within segmentally duplicated regions in soybean whereas only 4 of 10 rice members have been involved in such events and no member in Arabidopsis has been born by tandem/segmental duplications (Figure 5). These facts may be regarded as one of reasons contributing to differential expansions of lectin members in different families of a same genome or in different genomes in a same family.",

The investigation revealed multiple possible reasons responsible for the species-specific expansion. For example, deep expansion in the soybean B-lectin family is mainly due to the over expansion of tandem genes located on non-segmentally duplicated region (Figure 5). The Arabidopsis Jacalin family over-expanded themselves mainly by tandem and segmental mutual duplications (Figure 5). However, the major contribution of the species-specific expansion of the Gal_lectin and Gal_binding_1 lectin families is mainly due to the segmental duplication (Figure 5).",

            "text": "The evidence showed that monocot branched off from dicot plants 140-150 million years ago (MYA) [75-77]. Based on the divergence era and the estimation of the MRCA among soybean, rice and Arabidopsis as shown in Figure 4, the birth rate of B-lectin genes (counting only survival copies) is at least 13.3, 10.9 and 4.4 genes per 100 million years (MY) per ancestral gene in lineages leading to soybean, rice and Arabidopsis, respectively. The average rate of gene duplication is around 1 gene per 100 MY per ancestral gene in eukaryotes such as Homo sapiens, Mus musculus, Drosophila melanogaster, Caenorhabditis elegans, Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Arabidopsis thaliana [78]. Thus, these rates are significantly higher than the average one. Similarly, we have estimated the birth rates in other expanded families (Additional file 5). The analyses show that different families exhibit difference in their gene duplication rates. The highest rate was observed in the Jacalin family, where 30 genes per 100 million years in the lineage leading to Arabidopsis. The lowest rate was 0.3, significantly lower than the average rate, and occurred in the Arabidopsis Gal-Bind_lectin and Calreticulin families. On the contrary, by comparing the expansion mechanisms (Figure 5) and gene birth rates (Additional file 5), we found that high gene birth rates are mainly due to tandem and/or segmental duplications. For these families, whose members being involving in both tandem and segmental duplications account for more than 50% of total identified lectins in all families and species, their gene birth rates were estimated at least 2 genes per 100 MY per ancestral gene. In addition, the rates of gene birth in multiple lectin gene families may be under-estimated. The actual numbers of duplicate genes that once existed in three species could be more than that we have detected as some duplicate copies might have already been deleted from the genome or been evolved into pseudogenes that are not included in this study. We have detected 86, 101 and 20 members from total of 12 families with partial domain sequences in soybean, rice and Arabidopsis, respectively. These partial sequences usually lack regions corresponding to sugar binding properties. Thus, they may be nonfunctional and could be regarded as pseudogenes. There seems to be a correlation between tandem duplication and pseudogenization since most of these members were from tandem duplication related expansion. On the other hand, some duplicated copies might be too divergent to be recognized now, which may also contribute to the under-estimation. Thus, higher rates of gene duplication should have occurred for some lectin families in these three species.",

Domain amino acid sequences from the same tandem cluster were aligned first and were then used for the construction of their phylogentic tree, which were employed to analyze their expansion history. Based on such analyses, we found that parental genes were not always physically linked to their descendant genes and different expansion rates were observed for tandem genes in a same array. One of such examples was shown in Figure 6. In this example, we analyzed the patterns of tandem duplication in one of the largest tandem clusters in the soybean B-lectin family. We first investigated their expansion history by phylogenetic analyses (Figure 6A). The 19 tandem genes are in three clades, suggesting that this cluster was the results of three ancestral units, which may be evolved from ancient tandem duplication events. One of them contains only one gene, i.e. Glyma06g40130. No expansion was detected for this gene or its expanded genes have been lost during long evolutionary history. The second clade has 4 members whereas the third clade contains 14 members. On the basis of the phylogenetic tree, we deduced the hypothetical origins of 19 genes by tandem duplication (Figure 6B). The analyses showed that these genes were generated by at least 8 rounds of tandem duplication. After expansion, these genes were then not always inserted into the loci according to their physical orders. For example, the putative tandem pair of the Glyma06g40400 gene is Glyma06g40480 but not its physical neighbor Glyma06g40430. On the other hand, we found that most of tandem duplication occurred by a one-gene mode, i.e. only one gene was duplicated in a one tandem duplication event as shown in Figure 6. However, these cases were also observed that two or more genes in a cluster were duplicated through a single tandem duplication event (data not shown).",

To further investigate their contribution and patterns to the expansion of lectin members, segmental block pairs with at least 3 detectable tandemly arrayed genes were selected for more detail analyses. Totally, 6 pairs of segmental blocks with such criteria were detected. Three of them were from soybean including 2 B-lectin and 1 Lectin_legB pairs. Two of them were from Arabidopsis B-lectin and Jacalin families, respectively. The remaining one pair was from rice B-lectin family. Total of 6 phylogenetic trees were constructed for 6 pairs of segmentally and tandemly duplicated members. In most cases (5 of 6 pairs), a part of genes from the first tandem array are clustered together with another part of genes from the secondary tandem array. They exhibit tandem-segment mixed duplication model. These cases were observed in both dicot plants soybean and Arabidopsis as shown in Figure 7A and 7B. Such model of duplication may occur in two ways. One of them is tandem-segment-tandem duplication. In this case, the expansion was by tandemly duplication first and was then by segmental duplication followed by tandem duplication. The second way is segment-tandem-segment duplication. However, in the monocot rice genome, lectin expansion was through another model as shown in Figure 7C. In this model, genes from a tandem array were clustered together and no clade was detected with members from both tandem arrays, exhibiting a tandem-segment separated duplication model. Based on the phylogenetic relationship of these tandemly and segmentally duplicated members, one reasonable explain is that they underwent segmental duplication first followed by tandem duplication.",

            "text": "Since tandem and segmental duplications can not explain all the duplication events, we expect some of other mechanisms may also contribute to the expansion of the lectin superfamily. These include both retrotransposon and transposon mediated gene expansion, which has been reported in multiple species including rice and Arabidopsis [79-83]. By retrotransposition, a reverse-transcribed mRNA was inserted into a new genomic position to form a retrogene. Such a retrogene is usually devoid of introns and with the presence of target site duplications and/or a poly (A) tract [82,84]. To survey the contribution of retrogenes to the expansion of the lectin superfamily, one-exon-containing lectin genes were used as query protein sequences for BLASTP searches against all two or more exon-containing lectins (Methods). The searches produced many candidate retrogenes in soybean and rice. We then manually identified these candidates by the presence of target site duplications (TSD) and/or a poly (A) tract. The analyses revealed 4 putative retrogenes in soybean and 7 in rice (Figure 8A). Some of them are still with 3 hallmarks of retrogenes. One example is the soybean retrogene Glyma08g46960 with both hallmarks including TSD and poly (A) tract; its parental gene Glyma03g00530 contains two exons (Figure 8B). On the other hand, not all identified retrogenes possess all three features, especially the poly (A) tract and short direct repeats [82,84]. These two hallmarks may no longer be recognized since they can be easily masked by base substitutions, insertions and/or deletions during a long evolutionary history [82]. Although very limited contribution has been detected by retrogenes (Figure 8A), they may play significant roles in the expansion of lectin genes. After the birth of a retrogene, it may further be expanded by tandem duplication. For example, the putative retrogene Glyma08g46960 was detected with tandem duplication followed by the birth of three new lectin genes including Glyma08g46970, Glyma08g46990 and Glyma08g47000 (Figure 8C). Moreover, no retrogene has been detected in the Arabidopsis lectin superfamily.",

We have analyzed class I mobile elements including Mutator-like transposable element (MULE), CACTA and hAT as well as class II Helitron elements presented in these regions (Methods). In Arabidopsis, no above mentioned DNA transposon was detected to cover the lectin gene regions. However, we have identified considerable numbers of transposons presented in the 100-110 Kb regions in soybean. For example, 14 MULE-like, 3 CACTA and 20 Helitron elements have been detected and no hAT element has been identified in soybean. However, most of these elements are located outside the corresponding lectin genes. Only 4 genes were identified within 4 Helitron elements. These genes include Glyma08g07040 (Lectin_legB), Glyma09g21970 (Gal_lectin), Glyma13g42210 (Chitin_bind_1) and Glyma20g02580 (Phloem). They are candidates to contribute to the expansion of lectin genes. Thus, DNA transposon elements have limited contribution to the expansion of the lectin superfamily in soybean. A similar situation was also observed in rice. In this organism, we have detected 6 MULE-like elements and all of them are located within lectin genes. Five of these elements are within introns of corresponding lectin genes including LOC_Os04g03579 (Lectin_legB), LOC_Os04g34410 (B_lectin), LOC_Os05g35360 (Gal_Lectin), LOC_Os11g39420 (Jacalin) and LOC_Os12g24170 (Gal_Lectin). The remaining one contributes the insertion of 6 exons of the lectin gene LOC_Os10g18400 (Gal_Lectin) and this MULE-like element was named TI0006870 as described by Juretic et al (2005) [80].

To analyze the expression profiles of these probed genes, microarray data were downloaded from Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) DataSets [86] and Arrayexpress database [87] as described in the Methods section. We have analyzed the effects of both Phytophthora sojae and cyst nematode infections on the lectin gene expression. The analyses showed that 6 lectin genes exhibited up-regulation after the infection of the pathogen P. sojae (Figure 9B). These lectin genes include Glyma06g41150 (B-lectin), Glyma07g08630 (LysM), Glyma09g27700 (Lectin_legB) and three Chitin_bind_1 family genes: Glyma13g42210, Glyma19g43460 and Glyma19g43470.

The percentages of tissue-specific genes are 8.0%, 40.0%, 14.3%, 41.7%, 21.4%, 4.3% and 10.0% in the B-lectin, Chitin_binding_1, EEA, Gal_Lectin, Jacalin, Lectin_legB and Phloem families, respectively (Additional file 8). These lectin genes were preferentially expressed only in one or two tissues. In Arabidopsis, the transcript abundance was investigated among six different tissues including callus, germinating seedlings, inflorescence (mixed stages), leaves (21 day), root (21 day), silique (24-48 hour post-fertilization). Based on our analysis, only 4 out 12 lectin families contain genes with tissue-specific expression, significantly less than rice. These genes were from the B-lectin, Jacalin, Lectin_legB and Phloem families. The percentages of tissue-specific genes in these 4 families are 23.7%, 2.2%, 9.8% and 16.7%, respectively (Additional file 9).

If the expression patterns of any members of a tandem cluster exhibit difference from any other members in the cluster under either any biotic or abiotic stresses, this cluster is regarded as a divergent cluster in their expression. A similar criterion has also been applied to the evaluation of expression divergence in segmental duplications. Based on the evaluation, we have identified 29 tandem clusters and 21 segmental blocks with differential expression under various biotic and abiotic stresses, accounting for 69% of total clusters and 88% of total segmental blocks, respectively (Figure 10C). Further analyses show that different lectin families exhibit significant difference in their expression divergence after tandem duplication, ranging from 40% for the Jacalin family to 100% for the Chitin_bind_1, Gal_binding and Phloem families (Figure 10C). On the other hand, for segmentally duplicated blocks, most of them show expression divergence for most of families (Figure 10C).

One of them is the kinase domain, which was presented in three families including B-lectin, Lectin_legB and Lectin_C. Here we focus on the B-lectin and Lectin_legB families since only one or two members were detected for the Lectin_C family in plants. For these two families, the combination with kinase domain did not occur in animals, bacteria and fungi, suggesting that the domain composition was established during the course of plant evolution. Phylogenetic analyses showed that most of these domains were from the receptor-like kinase (RLK)/Pelle family [68]. Interestingly, this family also underwent a rapid birth-and-death evolution in plants [68]. Thus, both lectin and kinase domains were maintained by according evolution.",

Previous reports have showed that tandemly duplicated genes tend to be involved in biotic and abiotic stresses [72,83]. Many of the RLK family members are B-lectin or Lectin_legB domain-containing proteins in rice and Arabidopsis [68]. Interestingly, the expression data also support the importance of this family in stress response [92]. These results further confirmed the co-evolution of B-lectin/Lectin_legB and kinase domains. Our expression data suggest a link between biotic/abiotic stresses and tandem/segmental duplications in lectin families and also suggest that not only tandem but also segmental duplications of lectin genes may be regarded as drivers for plants to adapt various environmental stresses through duplication followed by expression divergence, thus, providing an explanation for why some of lectin families exhibit large expansion. Highly divergent expression profiles also demonstrate that each member of this gene superfamily may play specialized roles in a specific stress condition and function as a regulator of various environmental factors such as cold drought and high salinity stresses as well as biotic stresses. The detection of tissue-specifically expressed genes further demonstrated the comprehensive biological functions of this superfamily.",
