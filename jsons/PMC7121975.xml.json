The strategic position of Kupffer cells (KC), at the luminal side of the liver sinusoidal endothelium, places them in an ideal position for their main function in the steady state, i.e. filtering of the blood that enters the liver from both the portal vein and the hepatic artery (see Fig. 10.1a, b for a schematic representation). In this manner they play an important role in the surveillance of potentially hazardous substances entering the body via the intestine, as well as in the recycling of iron by the removal of effete erythrocytes from the circulation. In addition to this scavenger function, KC are increasingly recognized as regulatory and effector cells in innate and adaptive immune responses to infectious agents and other conditions challenging liver homeostasis. Interestingly, KC activity also affects hepatocyte function directly, thus making these cells important versatile constituents of the liver.\n\n",

Given the ambition of this goal and the space limitations set, we necessarily restrict ourselves to the global picture as obtained from studies in human and in animal models, and refer to more specific literature where applicable. Although defining KC by their tissue localization and specific macrophage features seems clear-cut, distinguishing these cells from other myeloid cells such as circulating monocytes, perivascular macrophages, and different types of dendritic cells sometimes appears problematic. This especially concerns studying populations of cells after isolation and/or in inflammatory conditions. In different studies, authors apply slightly different criteria for the identification of \u201cgenuine\u201d KC vs. recent immigrants, and this easily creates confusion. Where possible, we attempt to clarify these semantic issues, but these are important considerations when interpreting experimental findings.",

            "text": "Like various other tissue macrophages, KC have a characteristic amoeboid morphology with lamellipodia and an irregular surface containing many microvilli (Naito et al. 2004). They contain an ovoid or indented nucleus and their numerous cytoplasmic vesicles are reminiscent of a high level of phagocytic and pinocytic activity. Figure 10.2 provides an overview of histomorphological aspects of KC at different magnification levels. The cells adhere to the fenestrated sinusoidal endothelium and are slightly more abundant in the peri-portal than in the peri-central regions. Although KC are the specialized phagocytes of the liver, sinusoidal endothelial cells of the liver have significant endocytic capacity, and this historically gave rise to the, now deserted, concept of the reticulo-endothelial system as scavenger system. In fact, early ultrastructural and functional studies were instrumental in establishing a definitive distinction between the two cell types (Wisse 1972). Both KC and endothelial cells contain high levels of lysosomal enzymes, such as glycosidases, nucleases, lipases, and proteases, in line with their clearance function. In mouse liver, KC numbers are approximately 35\u201340 % of the number of hepatocytes (Baratta et al. 2009), and comparable histological pictures in other species suggest very similar frequencies.\n\n",

            "text": "With regard to the KC\u2019s molecular phenotype, current approaches allow the acquisition of genome-wide information on expressed genes under steady state and experimental or diseased conditions. Ideally, this would provide elaborate phenotypic information for the comparison of KC in different circumstances, or with other cell types. However, the currently available information on KC gene expression profiles is relatively limited. In part this may be related to the demanding isolation procedures, which represent a challenge to achieve reliable gene expression profiles. In the recent comparison of different tissue macrophages by the Immunological Genome Consortium, KC proved elusive for definitive identification and/or isolation through sorting by flowcytometry (Gautier et al. 2012). At the time of writing of this chapter, the publicly accessible repositories (Geo and ArrayExpress) contain only two studies describing data on KC (Gorgani et al. 2008; Roudkenar et al. 2008). Other publications describe gene expression arrays of KC in various experimental settings, but the authors have not deposited raw data, thus limiting their value for subsequent use by others (Chen et al. 2010; Gehring et al. 2009; Xu et al. 2012; Zocco et al. 2006). In general, these studies strongly confirm the macrophage identity of KC. Comparison with other resident macrophages, however, also strengthens the profound influence of unique local conditions on the expression profiles and related biological functions. In this respect, KC are characterized by the high level expression of various types of receptors involved with endocytosis (Gorgani et al. 2008). Changing environmental conditions, for instance during liver regeneration or interferon treatment also have a significant impact on global gene expression by KC, showing their general responsiveness (Xu et al. 2012; Zocco et al. 2006).",

In general, KC in peri-portal regions are larger, more phagocytic, and contain higher levels of lysosomal enzyme activity, while being less responsive to inflammatory triggers. Conversely, the smaller KC in the peri-central areas express higher levels of MHC class II and produce more nitric oxide (NO) and superoxide anion upon stimulation.

Upon isolation, however, Crispe and collaborators noted a striking discrepancy between the KC subsets represented in isolated populations characterized by flowcytometry, and those identified in situ (Klein et al. 2007). They identified a subpopulation of so-called \u201csessile\u201d KC that was highly underrepresented among the cells isolated using enzymatic digestion. Since sessile KC are uniquely radio-resistant and have distinct developmental and functional features (see below), it is important to realize the impact of technical approach when interpreting experimental findings and comparing results from different studies.",

Kinoshita and collaborators identified by flowcytometry two major KC subsets in mouse liver, which both are F4/80+ but differentially express CD68 and CD11b (Kinoshita et al. 2010). In our own recent histological analysis of mouse KC, we and others observed differential expression of CD68 and F4/80 by KC with only partial overlap (Movita et al. 2012; Lloyd et al. 2008). In addition, only a minority of F4/80+ KC showed histologically detectable CD11b expression. Careful evaluation let us conclude that F4/80-low CD11b+ cells in the liver resemble monocyte-related cells, and differ from tissue-resident KC, with the latter population being more difficult to isolate from the liver by perfusion or collagenase treatment (Movita et al. 2012; Kinoshita et al. 2010). This subset distinction was recently confirmed, showing that CD68+ cells, but not CD11b+ cells, expressed CRIg, MerTK, and CD64, and were involved with systemic bactericidal activities (Ikarashi et al. 2013). In contrast, CD11b+ cells were pivotal in immunity against tumors. Clearly, scoring cells positive or negative in immunofluorescence or immunohistochemistry depends on multiple technical parameters, but the findings at this level illustrate the heterogeneity of KC in the steady state. Whether this represents the existence of distinct subsets or a spectrum of cells with different expression levels remains to be determined.",

These varied from the classic mononuclear phagocyte system view of an exclusive bone marrow (BM) origin, where circulating monocytes differentiate into KC, to an embryonic origin of the KC population, which is maintained via local proliferation. The proliferating cells could be either immature local precursor cells or mature KC themselves. Early studies, for instance, showed extensive mitosis of KC during the regeneration phase after partial hepatectomy (Widmann and Fahimi 1975). However, this could also represent proliferation of immigrants from the circulation. Functional depletion of BM cells by radioactive 89Sr incorporation into bone strongly suggested the independent maintenance of KC (Yamada et al. 1990), but disparate opinions on KC origin existed for a long time in the scientific community.",

In these, Crispe and colleagues identified in mice the radio-resistant \u201csessile\u201d KC mentioned above. Four weeks after BM transplantation, approximately half of the KC population appeared to be of donor origin as determined at the histological level. In seeming contrast, flowcytometric analysis showed 99 % of F4/80-high, CD11b-low KC were donor-derived at this time point. This discrepancy could be explained by the presence of sessile KC, which are barely replaced and escape enzymatic isolation, and therefore flowcytometric identification. The sessile population was, however, completely depleted by in vivo treatment with liposome-encapsulated clodronate, and then replaced by donor-type cells. Thus, sessile KC could be either self-maintained or have acquired radioresistance and longevity, and still be hematogenous in origin. The experimental conditions, however, significantly challenge the resident KC population, and thus the obtained results leave room for diverse interpretations concerning the origin of KC in the steady state. In any case, the liposome-mediated depletion experiments gave no indication for the existence of an immature, non-phagocytic local precursor, which would have generated host-type KC. Rather, these experiments showed the potential of BM-derived cells to differentiate into genuine KC.",

Activity of the alternative ligand for CSF-1 receptor, IL-34, probably explains the generation of these residual KC. Absence of only IL-34, in turn, does not affect KC development, in contrast to generation of epidermal Langerhans cells and microglia (Wang et al. 2012). The notion that CSF-1 is an important growth factor for KC is supported by the finding that KC fail to repopulate in adult CSF-1-deficient but IL-34-sufficient op/op mice after liposomal clodronate-mediated depletion, while KC reach normal numbers after 14 days in CSF-1-sufficient mice (Yamamoto et al. 2008). Exogenous CSF-1 supplementation restores KC development in op/op mice. Interestingly, it was shown recently that resident macrophage populations, including KC, are stimulated under type inflammatory type 2 conditions to proliferate in an IL-4-mediated, CSF-1-independent fashion (Jenkins et al. 2013).",

These hemoglobin-containing vesicles are rapidly removed from the circulation by liver KC and, to a lesser extent, macrophages from other tissues mainly by scavenger receptors (Willekens et al. 2005). Following phagocytosis and hemolysis, the different components are degraded and recycled. Hemoglobin is degraded by heme-oxygenases (HO), of which HO-1 is expressed in KC. HO-1 is induced by diverse stimuli including heme, heat stress, LPS, and various cytokines. HO-1 catalyzes the degradation of heme into iron, biliverdin, and carbon monoxide, which are all considered to be hepatoprotective at low quantities under steady state conditions. Iron is then either stored intracellularly as ferritin or conveyed to circulating transferrin via membrane-bound ferroportin. Interestingly, it was also shown that heme-degrading HO-1 acts as a downstream effector molecule of IL-10 that mediates its immunosuppressive activities (Lee and Chau 2002).",

The importance of the liver in this respect is indicated by the finding that apoptotic neutrophils appeared in the lungs and spleen only after inactivation of KC by gadolinium chloride (Shi et al. 2001). Phagocytosis of apoptotic cells by KC is mediated by recognition of surface phosphatidylserine and, importantly, enhances the production of IL-10, and may favor a state of unresponsiveness. The induction of IL-10 may prevent development of sterile inflammation, activation of macrophages, and release of activating signals. Ongoing phagocytosis of apoptotic cells as part of liver homeostasis, in combination with low levels of LPS that are continuously released from the gut are likely responsible for constant low levels of anti-inflammatory mediators, such as IL-10, TGF-\u03b2 and prostaglandins that restrict inflammation under steady state conditions. In addition, continuous exposure to serotonin probably contributes to the induction and maintenance of a non-inflammatory state (de las Casas-Engel et al. 2013).",

In addition, using flowcytometrically sorted cells and in the setting of bile duct ligation-induced liver inflammation, He et al demonstrated that ED1+ED2+ KC have a high mRNA level of IL-1\u03b2 (He et al. 2009). In a mouse model of ischemia reperfusion, TLR9-mediated activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome by extracellular histones appeared to play an important role in IL-1 activation and liver damage (Huang et al. 2013). However, several other studies show that steady state KC are relatively weak in producing cytokines. In vitro stimulation with LPS, R848, or CpG resulted in very low levels of IL-10, TNF-\u03b1, and IL-12p40 produced by KC (Movita et al. 2012). Similarly, Kinoshita et al.

This so-called endotoxin tolerance to repetitive antigenic stimulation prevents excessive activation of KC and inflammation of the liver. The state of unresponsiveness is mediated via immunosuppressive cytokines, such as IL-10 and TGF-\u03b2, and prostaglandins, and further supported by down-regulation of TLR expression levels and negative regulation of TLR signaling, for instance by IRAK-M (Liu et al. 2008). Active suppression by IL-10 and TGF-\u03b2 reduces the antigen-presenting capacity of KC by down-regulating the expression of MHC molecules and co-stimulators, without strongly affecting the scavenger function of KC. The consequence of the immunosuppressive milieu on KC, but also on other potential antigen-presenting cells including dendritic cells and sinus endothelial cells, is allograft tolerance following liver transplantation, but also a limited ability to eliminate intrahepatic pathogens. It has been suggested that, depending on the microenvironment and the quality and strength of signals received by KC, they can become immune-stimulatory cells, as has been demonstrated in co-culture experiments with human NK cells (Tu et al. 2008).",

In a mouse model of NAFLD, in which ob/ob mice are fed a high-fat diet, the total number of KC is not affected (Leroux et al. 2012). However, the function of KC is altered, since KC in NAFLD secrete higher levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines and express a so-called \u201cM1-phenotype,\u201d which has also been shown for the increased numbers of macrophages present in obese adipose tissue (Lumeng et al. 2007). Enhanced secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-6, IL-1\u03b2, and TNF-\u03b1 by activated macrophages may lead to more tissue damage. The crucial role of KC in fatty liver disease has been indicated by experiments in mice where KC were eliminated by liposomal clodronate or by gadolinium chloride, which significantly decreased hepatic steatosis and insulin resistance (Huang et al. 2010; Rivera et al. 2007) and was accompanied by lower TNF-\u03b1 and IL-6 mRNA expression.",

Exposure of KC to elevated leptin levels, as present in metabolic syndrome, induce iNOS- and NADPH oxidase-mediated oxidative stress in KC, causing their activation (Chatterjee et al. 2013). Moreover, oxidized LDL particles, but not unmodified or acetylated LDL, appear to accumulate in KC lysosomes and cause increased expression of inflammatory genes in the liver (Bieghs et al. 2013). Thus, the type of lipids to which KC are exposed play an important role in their polarization and activation, as was also indicated by a previous study by Papackova et al. (2012), in which high-fat diet rich in mono-unsaturated lipids stimulated an alternative M2-like program in KC, and not a classical M1 activation program characterized by pro-inflammatory cytokine production.",

Remarkably, administration of LPS exacerbates liver injury in a model for NAFLD, whereas peptidoglycan administration, triggering TLR2/6, does not. One of the initiation events of NAFLD is likely an alteration in the intestinal microbiota due to over-nutrition or metabolic disturbances. These changes in intestinal microbial profiles affect fat accumulation in the liver. In this respect, it has been shown that ob/ob mice, which are a well-known model for obesity, display a different microbial profile compared to control mice (Tilg 2010). As a consequence of altered gut microbiota the local as well as systemic levels of endotoxins, such as LPS, may increase and affect innate immune cells, including KC. Furthermore, and this is therapeutically extremely interesting, probiotics have been shown to have a beneficial effect on NAFLD in mouse models by reducing hepatic injury and inflammation, which further supports the crucial role of gut-derived LPS in initiating and maintaining NAFLD (Farrell et al. 2012).",

Ethanol may directly affect the transcriptional regulation of genes involved in lipid metabolism, such as PPAR-\u03b1. Similar as in NAFLD, depletion of KC in mice also attenuates alcohol-induced disease, demonstrating a central role for KC (Nath and Szabo 2009). In addition, abrogation of the TNF-\u03b1 pathway in vivo using antibodies against TNF-\u03b1 or TNF-\u03b1RI gene-targeted mice strongly reduces alcohol-induced liver pathology, as demonstrated by reduced serum ALT levels and pathology scores (Iimuro et al. 1997; Yin et al. 1999).

In mouse cytomegalovirus (MCMV) and adenovirus infection, KC were found to produce pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines, which were directly or indirectly responsible for monocyte, NK cell, and T cell infiltration in the liver (Salazar-Mather and Hokeness 2006; Lieber et al. 1997; Liu et al. 2003; Zaiss et al. 2002).

So far, it is mostly unclear which receptors KC may use to recognize and take up HBV. Possible candidate receptors for direct binding of HBV to KC are heparan sulfate proteoglycan (HSPG), CD14, and the mannose receptor. Another molecule that binds HBsAg avidly is albumin, which is efficiently taken up by KC as well as hepatocytes, and may offer the virus a physiological transport pathway to parenchymal cells (Wright et al. 1988). Similarly, KC also express several receptors known to be involved in hepatocyte infection by HCV (Ploss and Evans 2012), including HSPG (Pradel et al. 2002), LDL-receptor (Kleinherenbrink-Stins et al. 1991; Kamps et al. 1991), SR-B1 (Terpstra and van Berkel 2000), CD81 (Petracca et al. 2000), and DC-SIGN (Tu et al. 2008), a lectin known to bind the HCV envelope protein E2 (Pohlmann et al. 2003). Liver biopsy-derived cells exposed to E2 demonstrated binding to liver cells including KC (Petracca et al. 2000), but so far, there is no evidence for the occurrence of HCV trans-infection in vivo.",

Similarly, stimulation of human non-parenchymal cells, presumably KC, with HBV leads to the activation of NF-\u03baB and production of IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, and TNF-\u03b1, cytokines known to inhibit HBV replication in hepatocytes (Hosel et al. 2009). However, when incubating rat KC with HBV virions, they hardly expressed IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, or TNF-\u03b1, but instead preferably produced TGF-\u03b2 (Li et al. 2012). Likewise, also HCV has been shown to induce the production of immune regulatory factors including IL-10 by monocyte-derived macrophages, which may promote viral persistence (Chang et al. 2007). A recent study, investigating the difference between responders and non-responders to IFN-\u03b1 therapy against HCV, showed that non-responders had relatively high expression levels before treatment of IFN-stimulated genes in the liver (Lau et al. 2013). In these patients, KC appeared to be a local source of type 1 IFN that promoted basal expression of IFN-stimulated genes in hepatocytes, and thus negatively influenced the outcome of IFN-based therapy.",

TLR2 has also been suggested to play a role in HCV-core and nonstructural-3 protein (NS3) recognition by macrophages leading to MyD88-dependent activation, including increased IRAK activity, p38 phosphorylation, ERK and JNK activity, and AP-1 activation (Imran et al. 2012).

Although in vivo evidence is lacking, it has been proposed that HAV reaches hepatocytes via KC that bind complexes of HAV and HAV-specific IgA antibodies via the Fc\u03b1 receptor (van Egmond et al. 2000), and subsequently transfer the virus to hepatocytes. In contrast to HBV and HCV, HAV requires the disruption of host cell membranes to release its progeny. These dying hepatocytes may provide DAMP, such as ATP and nucleic acids, which can be recognized by KC and other intrahepatic immune cells, leading to activation of these cells that can overcome viral immune escape and liver-intrinsic tolerogenic mechanisms (Canbay et al. 2003).",

In influenza infection, KC were indicated as the effector cells killing hepatocytes in an as yet unidentified manner, leading to damage-associated hepatitis. KC can kill hepatocytes either directly via CD95-dependent apoptotic pathways or indirectly by interacting with CD8+ (and possibly CD4+) lymphocytes through stimulation of cytokine secretion and other mediators like phospholipases and NO (Polakos et al. 2006; Kolios et al. 2006). Although such a mechanism might explain the hepatitis observed in influenza, measles, SARS, and CMV infection, where the virus is not identified in the liver, a similar mechanism could well operate in the pathogenesis of hepatitis induced by hepatotropic viruses like HBV and HCV.",

            "text": "Exclusive infection of the liver by bacteria has not been described, and most bacteria that reach the liver through the blood are efficiently cleared by immune cells. A major role for KC in host defense against bacterial infection is indicated by several studies in experimental models. Infection of mice with Listeria monocytogenes is a well-studied liver infection model. On the one hand, Listeria infection is dependent on KC function, as accumulation of bacteria in the liver depends on recognition of bacterial surface molecules by cognate receptors on KC (Ofek and Sharon 1988). On the other hand, production of inflammatory mediators such as IL-6, IL-12, IL-1\u03b2, TNF-\u03b1, and NO by infected KC inhibits proliferation of the microorganism (Ehlers et al. 1992; Ofek and Sharon 1988). At the same time KC-derived chemokines such as MIP-1\u03b1 (CCL3), MIP-1\u03b2 (CCL4), MCP-1 (CCL2), and MIP-2 (CXCL2 /-3), drive monocyte and neutrophil recruitment into the liver in order to control infection (Salkowski et al. 1998; Barsig et al. 1998; Ebe et al. 1999). In line with this, LPS treatment prior to infection has been shown to increase KC numbers leading to a reduction of bacterial load and improvement of prognosis in a Salmonella septicemia model (Lehner et al. 2001). Thus, as expected, KC inactivation or depletion results in impaired bacterial clearance (Cousens and Wing 2000; Tomioka et al. 2000; Pinto et al. 1991). In humans, the increased frequency of septicemia and septic shock involving Gram-negative bacteria in patients with hepatic failure have been attributed to the inability of KC to clear the portal circulation of micro-organisms and endotoxin (Wyke 1987; Triger and Wright 1973).",

While neutrophils are bactericidal cells par excellence, KC have a limited capacity to kill Listeria, for instance (Tomioka et al. 2000). Several mouse and rat studies demonstrated the presence of apoptotic neutrophils in KC upon bacterial infection or endotoxin exposure (Shi et al. 1996, 2001; Gregory et al. 2002). These findings suggest that KC play a critical role in eliminating neutrophils that accumulate in the liver sinusoids subsequent to clearance of bacteria, bacterial endotoxin, and microbial debris from the blood. Furthermore, it was found that neutrophils, accumulated in the liver sinusoids, suppress cytokine and chemokine production by KC, thereby showing an important role for neutrophil-KC interaction in moderating the pro-inflammatory response to bacteria taken up by the liver (Holub et al. 2009).",

            "text": "KC also represent the port of liver entry for parasites such as Plasmodium and Leishmania, which parasitize KC and then infect other liver cells (Tavares et al. 2013). Following the delivery of malaria parasites into the skin by a mosquito bite, the rapid migration of sporozoites allows them to escape clearance by local tissue phagocytic cells and to enter lymphatics and blood vessels. Via the blood, sporozoites rapidly reach the liver and, after gliding on HSPG in liver sinusoids, they use circumsporozoite protein (CSP) and thrombospondin-related anonymous protein (TRAP) to bind to KC (Pradel and Frevert 2001). Interaction with and passage through KC is important for hepatocyte infection (Ishino et al. 2004; Baer et al. 2007), indicating that these parasites use KC to overcome the sinusoidal barrier and, ultimately, to infect hepatocytes (Mota et al. 2002). TREM2 expression by KC appears to be an important determinant in resistance to liver stage infection against Plasmodium parasites (Goncalves et al. 2013). Once inside a hepatocyte, the parasites develop into merozoites, which will be released from the liver to infect erythrocytes (Sturm et al. 2006). Taken together, these data show that sporozoites not only use their migratory capacity to escape elimination by phagocytic cells, but also use KC to increase their efficiency at infecting hepatocytes.",

            "text": "Liver fibrosis occurs as a wound-healing scar response following chronic liver inflammation and is characterized by excess collagen deposition and accumulation of extracellular matrix in response to chronic hepatocellular damage. Macrophage numbers increase in damaged liver and they are principally located around the regions of damage and fibrosis (Wallace et al. 2008). Inhibition of KC function using gadolinium chloride was found to reduce liver fibrosis in experimental models (Rivera et al. 2001). KC are thought to be involved in fibrogenesis via the production of ROS, cytokines, and growth factors that induce hepatic stellate cell myofibroblastic transformation (Wallace et al. 2008). In addition, they not only produce metalloproteinases and their inhibitors but also regulate the production of these factors by other cells, and stimulate their survival, leading to disturbance of the homeostatic mechanisms involved in extracellular matrix deposition (Xidakis et al. 2005; Pradere et al. 2013). Recent studies demonstrate that these actions are only partially conducted by liver-resident macrophages, but largely depend on recruitment of Ly6C-expressing monocytes as precursors of tissue macrophages into the inflamed and damaged liver (Imamura et al. 2005; Karlmark et al. 2009).",

KC-derived TGF-\u03b2 has been suggested to drive hepatic stellate cell transformation and to induce production of collagen and proteoglycans by these cells (Meyer et al. 1990). In this context, IL-17A, which has been found elevated in fibrosis associated with alcoholic liver disease, appears to stimulate both KC and stellate cell activation (Hara et al. 2013). In vitro studies have shown that KC also can induce expression of platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) receptors on hepatic stellate cells, thus enhancing stellate cell proliferation in response to PDGF produced by activated macrophages and stellate cells (Friedman and Arthur 1989). TNF-\u03b1, IL-1, and MCP-1 (CCL2), that are produced by activated KC, are also mitogenic and chemoattractant for hepatic stellate cells (Marra et al. 1999; Matsuoka et al. 1989). In addition, TGF-\u03b2 and IL-6 induce mRNA expression of metalloproteinases and also their specific inhibitors in hepatocytes, KC, and hepatic stellate cells in rat liver (Knittel et al. 1999).",

In these conditions, hepatocytes are killed, and KC as well as other cells are activated to produce cytokines, such as hepatocyte growth factor (HGF), IL-6, and TNF-\u03b1, that drive the compensatory proliferation of surviving hepatocytes (Maeda et al. 2005). Dying hepatocytes trigger the inflammatory response by activation of KC. Recently, it was demonstrated that the expression of TREM-1 by mouse KC plays a crucial role in their activation upon recognition of necrotic hepatocytes (Wu et al. 2012). The augmented proliferation rate of hepatocytes increases the probability of genomic mutation in these cells. In addition, there are several possible mechanisms by which inflammation and inflammatory mediators may lead to genetic alterations.",

Hepatic metastases result from initial detachment of tumor cells from the primary site, entry into the portal circulation, and entrapment of metastatic cells in the liver sinusoids (Van den Eynden et al. 2013). In vivo microscopy has shown that KC are attracted to tumor cells in the hepatic circulation and have the ability to phagocytose these cells (Kan et al. 1995). NO, produced by KC after stimulation with TNF-\u03b1, PG\u03952 (Valatas et al. 2004; Gaillard et al. 1991), and endotoxin derived from the portal circulation, is thought to be an effective weapon of the KC machinery against tumor cells, since NO is able to inhibit proliferation and induce apoptosis in cancer cells (Aono et al. 1994; Hussain and Harris 2007). However, NO also mediates tumor-promoting effects that include the ability to induce DNA damage, to increase angiogenesis by inducing VEGF production, to stimulate tumor cell proliferation and invasion, and to suppress anti-tumor immunity (Hussain and Harris 2007; Koblish et al. 1998). Furthermore, KC are able to produce HGF, which has been shown to contribute to tumor cell proliferation, and KC might facilitate tumor angiogenesis and invasion by secreting proteases, which alter the extracellular matrix in favor of tumor progression (Knittel et al. 1999). Moreover, KC may contribute to an immunosuppressive microenvironment by expressing immune regulatory factors, such as IL-10, PD-L1 in addition to NO, that could prevent an effective immune response towards the tumor (Trinchieri 2012).",

In support of this protective role of KC, isolated KC were found to be cytotoxic against human colon adenocarcinoma cells and this cytotoxicity was increased significantly when KC were stimulated with IFN-\u03b3 and endotoxin (Roh et al. 1990; Heuff et al. 1995). Other studies have demonstrated that KC induce Fas expression in colon cancer cells (Song et al. 2001) and malignant glioma cells (Lau et al. 2001) leading to Fas-mediated apoptosis and death in the presence of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes or TNF-\u03b1. The opposing tumor-restricting and -promoting role of KC was elegantly modeled recently by depleting KC at different time points during tumor induction (Wen et al. 2013). Depletion prior to tumor transfer facilitated tumor growth, while late stage KC depletion led to decreased tumor mass.",

They perform important tasks in protecting the host against invading pathogens and are thought to play a major role in induction and maintenance of immunological tolerance. Furthermore, evidence is accumulating that liver macrophages are essential for the resolution of fibrosis and display anti-tumor activities. However, they are also at least partly responsible for the development of liver diseases, including fatty liver disease, the initiation of various forms of hepatitis and sequellae, like fibrosis. Several microbial pathogens seem to use KC as transport cells to infect the liver. Once liver infection is established and/or liver cell damage has occurred, liver macrophages contribute importantly to the inflammatory response and further tissue damage by producing pro-inflammatory and pro-fibrotic mediators, by killing hepatocytes and even by supporting carcinogenesis.",

However, resident KC and liver-infiltrating macrophages probably respond differently to various environmental conditions, given their distinct developmental histories, thus leading to diverse phenotypic and functional states of these cells. It is tempting to speculate that these differences may eventually be essential in the contribution of different liver macrophages to various homeostatic processes. With our growing appreciation of the complex roles of liver macrophages in both protective and harmful responses, these cells form an interesting but difficult cellular target for treatment options in liver diseases. Future efforts should therefore focus on identifying the characteristics of the specific macrophage subpopulations that exert the distinctive functions of interest and on identifying the underlying mechanisms of actions.",

(b) Between the hepatocytes and discontinuous, fenestrated sinus endothelial cells (SE), the space of Disse (SD) is located. Here, hepatic stellate cells (SC), also named Ito cells, are situated. Kupffer cells are, firmly or loosely, attached to the sinusoid wall. (c) KC in the portal areas differ in various aspects from those in the peri-central regions",
