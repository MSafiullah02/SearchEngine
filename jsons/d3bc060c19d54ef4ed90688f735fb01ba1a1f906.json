To capture these clusters, this study employed web search query logs and user location information from smartphones. Initially, we anonymously identified the smartphone users who used a web search engine (i.e., Yahoo! JAPAN Search) to search for COVID-19 or its symptoms. We regarded these searchers as web searchers who were suspicious of their own COVID-19 infection (WSSCI). Subsequently, we extracted the location of WSSCI via the smartphone application and compared the spatiotemporal distribution of WSSCI with the actual location of the two known clusters. In the early stage of cluster development, we can confirm several WSSCI. However, our approach was accurate only in that stage and became biased after the public announcement of the cluster development. When other cluster-related resources, such as detailed population statistics, are not available, the proposed metric can capture hints of emerging clusters.",

We employed two types of smartphones usage logs: web search query logs and location information. We also deployed web search query logs from PCs, as described in the \"Material and Methods\" section, to encompass people who searched for the disease on their PCs at home. First, we assumed that a person who might have COVID-19 attempts to obtain detailed information on the disease and its symptoms through a web search. Considering that, we designed 63 query patterns, such as \"likely to be corona,\" \"cough\" and \"corona,\" \"diarrhea\" and \"new type,\" and \"coughing up phlegm\" and \"new type pneumonia.\" We defined web users whose queries were related to the symptoms of COVID-19 as web searchers who were suspicious of their own COVID-19 infection (WSSCI). Second, we prospectively extracted location information of WSSCI from the \"Yahoo! JAPAN App ? ,\" which is one of the most popular smartphone applications in Japan and hosts many services, such as web search and weather report. Note that the location data were collected from users who approved the research purpose uses of their location information. Subsequently, we counted the number of WSSCI in each day and each area based on their location information.",

A recent work-in-progress paper also uses web search queries to predict country-level COVID-19 epidemic 6 , and it applies a prediction model based on search query trends within countries that observed COVID-19 epidemics in other countries, without having experienced any of them yet. We, in contrast, utilized web search query logs per user to detect WSSCI and aggregate their location histories to identify locations they visit or pass, resulting in COVID-19 cluster detection.",

However, even in such a low resource condition, smartphone users are still available and can be regarded as a type of social sensors who voluntarily report current events in real time whether they realize it or not. Therefore, to take advantage of social sensors, it is essential to examine the validity of the WSSCI-based approach in advance.",

Figures 1B, 1C , and 1D show the spatio-temporal distributions of WSSCI in the areas of Hokkaido, Kitami, and Sapporo, respectively. In Figure 1B , WSSCI hot spots had existed in the two cluster areas before they were reported, suggesting that WSSCI could be a clue of the cluster arrival.

To identify possible COVID-19-positive patients, using web search query logs is one of the advantages of the WSSCI-based approach. Although statistics of inpatients and outpatients have been reported, COVID-19 patients with mild symptoms who do not go to the hospital are difficult to identify. In fact, even patients with mild symptoms can transmit the virus to others; it is therefore highly required to find these patients. Fortunately, our approach can consider such patients through their location information.",

Location information of all users can only reveal us crowded areas, which can also be done through other resources, such as population statistics. However, it is more important to know \"where people who suspect they might be infected with the disease\" are concentrated especially in the early stage of the spread of the infectious disease. In addition to COVID-19, these data could help us control the spread of other infectious diseases or recurrent coronavirus in the future at an early stage. We believe that the proposed method could enhance these attempts.",

Additionally, we realized that it might be effective to support a real-time cluster surveillance in developing countries, where we can safely assume at least the existence of web search traffic in comparison to other smartphone applications (e.g., location-sharing social network services).",

The facet terms included 18 Japanese phrases meaning one of the symptoms, namely, \"cough,\" \"diarrhea,\" \"coughing up phlegm,\" \"slight fever,\" \"headache,\" \"cold,\" \"fevered,\" \"no fever,\" \"without fever,\" \"high fever,\" \"develop fever,\" \"runny nose,\" \"chills,\" \"throat,\" \"chest,\" \"phlegm,\" and \"feel tired\" or \"weariness\", or two phrases meaning \"designated hospitals\" (which means hospitals validated by the local health authorities as specialized for treatments of COVID-19-infected patients) or \"advice\" (which was presumably intended for special consultation services in charge of advising those who suspected to be infected with the virus). These terms in double patterns were AND-combined; therefore, their order was irrelevant. A query was matched against a pattern if and only if all terms were matched against any terms in user queries.

The existence of Kitami cluster and Sapporo cluster was admitted on March 9 and March 18, 2020, respectively. (B): Total weekly WSSCIphg throughout every 400 half grid squares in Hokkaido, Japan. (C-D): Total weekly WSSCIphg throughout every four half grid squares in Kitami and Sapporo, respectively, surrounded by a rectangle. In (B-D), the colors of grid squares represent the total weekly WSSCIphg throughout every several half grid squares, of which red is large and blue is small. The blue marker denotes the location of a cluster. Spatio-temporal distribution of the number of WSSCI per half grid (WSSCIphg), population distribution and total WSSCIphg in Hokkaido. (A-B): The distribution of the number of WSSCIphg throughout every four half grid squares between 02/19 and 02/25 in Kitami surrounded by a rectangle and between 02/11 and 02/17 in Sapporo surrounded by a rectangle, respectively. The figure shows 3 days before and 3 days after the announcement of the first patient positive in each city (a total of 7 days). (C) Population distribution in Hokkaido (left) and total WSSCIphg throughout every 400 half grid squares between January 27 and March 1, 2020 (right). 7/7",
