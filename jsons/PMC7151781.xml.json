In these circumstances, acute vomiting with or without diarrhoea can be clearly related to the ingestion of cows' milk by taking a careful history. Other clinical features usually accompany these gastrointestinal symptoms, such as swelling of the lips and tongue, oedema, and urticaria. All these symptoms disappear in a few hours if cows' milk is stopped. The amount of cows' milk responsible for this can be extremely small. It has been proven that infants can be sensitized to cows' milk via its presence in maternal breast milk when mother is herself drinking cows' milk (Walker-Smith et al., 1981; Lake, Whitington and Hamilton, 1982).",

            "text": "The role of cows' milk hypersensitivity in the genesis of sudden unexpected death or \u2018cot death\u2019 was raised by Parish et al. (1960). The postulated mode of death was an acute anaphylactic reaction to cows' milk. Devey et al. (1976), in Cambridge, went on to report that guinea-pigs given cows' milk to drink, instead of water, soon became anaphylactically sensitized to the proteins of cows' milk. Coombs, Devey and Anderson (1978) then found that when the drinking of cows' milk was continued by the guinea-pigs for more than 70 days they became refractory to the effect. Anderson et al. (1979) then showed that there were differences in the anaphylactic sensitizing capacities of different milks in their animal model. Evaporated whole cows' milk was practically without sensitizing capacity to beta lactoglobulin, and a formula in a liquid concentrate form had extremely low sensitizing capacity to both casein and beta lactoglobulin. In both cases this only occurred when given to the guinea-pigs by mouth, sensitizing capacity being retained when given parenterally. This suggests that these formula are handled differently in the small intestine from other milk feeds. These observations have far-reaching implications if they are true for human infants, because they suggest that modification of artificial feeding formulae may profoundly influence their allergenic or sensitizing capacity. This aspect is discussed further on page 154.",

The ability of such laboratories to accurately diagnose nine fish-allergic patients and nine controls who provided specimens of blood and hair for testing was assessed by Sethi et al. (1986). All five laboratories were not only unable to diagnose fish allergy but reported many allergies in apparently non-allergenic subjects and also provided inconsistent results on duplicate samples from the same subject. Thus laboratory investigations appear to be most helpful when they are clinically least necessary, as history should give a clear indication of the diagnosis in most cases of quick onset syndromes. Sodium cromoglycate as an oral preparation (Nalcrom, Fisons Ltd.) has been reported to be an effective treatment for some cases of immediate food allergic disease. Symptoms provoked by ingestion of one or more foods may be prevented by sodium cromoglycate if it is taken before taking the food. The literature contains many anecdotal reports of the beneficial effect of this treatment of small numbers of patients at various ages (Freier and Berger, 1973; Watson and Timmins, 1979), but larger studies are still awaited. Scepticism about the value of this drug has been based upon its failure to act on mucosal mast cells in the animal model (Pearce et al., 1982). However, recent evidence that it has an effect on improving abnormal gastrointestinal sugar permeability in patients suggests its mode of action may be other than on the mast cell (Scotto et al., 1987).",

The underlying causes of these temporary food intolerances of infancy probably relate to a transient sensitization of the child to dietary antigens, which may be a result of a breach of the mucosal barrier. The precise mechanisms which cause the enteropathy are unclear although the application of the Gell and Coombs classification of hypersensitivity reaction provides a basis for investigation. For the reactions to occur the offending food antigen must enter the mucosa in appropriate amounts to cause sensitization. There are two hypotheses regarding this process: one suggests sensitization caused from an overstimulation of the immune system by excess antigen entry, the other proposes a minimal entry of antigen sufficient to stimulate a reaginic response, which in turn leads to increased antigen entry leading to mucosal damage. In the experimental animal it has been shown that intestinal anaphylaxis can lead to increased uptake of intestinal luminal antigens (Walker et al., 1975). Both hypotheses may be correct. Post-enteritis food sensitive enteropathies may result from excess local food antigen entry in susceptible individuals following gut damage induced by viral or bacterial pathogens. An hypothesis relating acute gastroenteritis and cows' milk sensitive enteropathy is illustrated in Figure 5.3\n.",

This has been well documented in animal studies of viral enteritis (Keljo, Butter and Hamilton, 1985). Clinical studies have also shown increased entry of both small molecular weight sugars in acute gastroenteritis (Figure 5.4\n) (Ford et al., 1985), and a larger molecular weight protein, horse radish peroxidase, in post-enteritis food sensitive enteropathies as observed using organ culture (Jackson, Walker-Smith and Phillips, 1983). Thus direct and indirect evidence exists that damage to the small intestinal mucosa may result in a local increase in antigen entry. However, most children in whom this happens are not sensitized to food. Thus for this excessive antigen entry to be of pathogenic importance it must occur in susceptible individuals. The nature of such susceptibility remains to be established but clearly relates in part to impaired immunoregulation by the local defence mechanisms in the small intestinal mucosa. The local effect of excess antigen absorption may be also determined by the allergenicity of the antigen entering the mucosa, as suggested by the guinea-pig studies of Coombs and colleagues in Cambridge referred to earlier and supported by the clinical studies of Manuel, Walker-Smith and France (1979). The role of cows' milk sensitive enteropathy as a cause of the post-enteritis syndrome is discussed further in Chapter 6.",

(1981) showed a remarkable difference in the incidence of delayed recovery between infants fed with different formulae immediately after an acute attack of gastroenteritis. Old formula Pregestimil (high osmolality and based on a casein hydrolysate) and Al 110 (based on casein) and standard SMA (a conventional adapted formula) were compared for infants aged under 6 months. It is likely that delayed recovery in these circumstances is related to cows' milk sensitive enteropathy; 26% of infants fed with the casein formula Al 110 developed delayed recovery compared with only 5% with Pregestimil and the very low figure of 2.5% with SMA. This later figure may have been by chance unusually low. Nevertheless, when these milks are tested in an animal model (guinea-pigs) then similar results are found: Al 110 is sensitizing, Pregestimil not sensitizing at all and SMA sensitizing significantly less often (Mc Laughlan and Coombs, 1983; Manuel et al., 1979). Thus adapted feeding formulae appear to be much less sensitizing than the older infant feeding formula still routinely used in much of the developing world. This is consistent with the decline in the severity of cows' milk sensitive enteropathy in societies where such milks are now universally used. Thus the allergenicity of the milk formula fed at the time of an acute attack of gastroenteritis may be a central factor in the development of cows' milk sensitive enteropathy.",

Unlike the gluten sensitive enteropathy of untreated coeliac disease, this cows' milk sensitive enteropathy is of variable severity on proximal mucosal biopsy, and is patchy in distribution, while a flat mucosa, indistinguishable from the mucosal appearances found in coeliac disease, may occasionally occur (Figure 5.5).",

Alternatively in some infants the onset is insidious and the presentation is very similar to coeliac disease. In fact in most cases in the early reports the onset with acute symptoms commenced before the age of 6 months. In those earlier reports the majority of infants were less than 3 months of age at the onset of symptoms (Harrison et al., 1976; Walker-Smith, Kilby and France, 1978). In the more recent study of Digeon et al. (1986) the mean age of onset was 7 months and some patients were over 1 year at the age of presentation. This change may relate to the fact that for the first 6 months of life most infants were fed modern adapted formulae, whereas in the previous reports infants were fed old-fashioned partly modified milks. The onset of symptoms usually occurred at a time when infants were having ordinary pasteurized (doorstep) milk. As referred to earlier, it seems likely that modern adapted milks are less sensitizing, and there is both animal model (Coombs and McLaughlin, 1985) and clinical evidence (Manuel and Walker-Smith, 1981) to support this view.",

It is important to exclude an infective cause of the enteropathy in any infant with chronic diarrhoea. As with all dietary protein intolerances, diagnosis is based upon the response to withdrawal and subsequent reintroduction of the offending protein. There is no specific laboratory test apart from serial biopsy related to elimination and challenge. The first stage in making the diagnosis is the suspicion that the child's symptoms relate to milk ingestion. If the small intestinal mucosa is shown to be abnormal on biopsy the finding of a patchy enteropathy with a thin mucosa in a cows' milk fed infant, when the infant responds rapidly to a cows' milk elimination diet provides firm presumptive evidence for this diagnosis. Such children may then be described as having a milk elimination responsive enteropathy. The transient nature of this disorder as well as the desire to avoid early milk challenge (because of the potential risk of acute anaphylaxis) (de Peyer and Walker-Smith, 1979) leads in practice to a late milk challenge at the age of 9 months to 1 year or even later. These children may then no longer be milk intolerant at the time of milk challenge (i.e. at the age of 9\u201312 months). Milk provocation in such circumstances merely establishes the safe return of cows' milk into the diet. It does not confirm the diagnosis of a cows' milk sensitive enteropathy which must remain forever unproven, at least on present-day diagnostic criteria.",

The infant who is having a milk-free diet (almost the same as a lactose-free diet) is admitted to hospital. First, he has a control pre-challenge small intestinal biopsy to show that his mucosa has returned to normal or near normal. If it has not improved, challenge should be deferred and the diagnosis reconsidered, the diet being carefully checked. In these circumstances if the child is truly on a milk-free diet but continues to have gluten in his diet coeliac disease must be considered.",

If watery diarrhoea with excess reducing substances occurs, the infant is clearly lactose intolerant and goes back to his milk-free diet, and milk challenge is deferred. If there is no diarrhoea the milk challenge takes place the next day. The amount given in the challenge will depend upon the previous severity of symptoms. If the history suggests the possibility of a previous anaphylactic reaction an intravenous infusion should be set up before the challenge and the initial amount of milk given should be small; for example 0.2 ml. If there has been a previous anaphylactic reaction before challenge, resuscitation equipment should be ready, and 1:10 000 adrenaline 0.1 ml kg\u22121 for injection, hydrocortisone 100 mg for intravenous use, intramuscular chlorpheniramine (Piriton) 2.5 mg for intravenous use, plasma infusion, oxygen and equipment for intubation.

If this is tolerated the child is then regraded in quarters back onto cows' milk or his normal milk feeding. Should symptoms recur, such as vomiting and diarrhoea, evidence of an intercurrent infection, e.g. hospital acquired rotavirus gastroenteritis, should be sought, i.e. stools should be sent for rapid viral diagnosis. If viral gastroenteritis is excluded, it is only a biopsy that can establish whether a relapse has occurred and should be done as soon as possible. If the previously normal mucosa is now abnormal, then this is regarded as a positive challenge, i.e. a cows' milk sensitive enteropathy has been shown and a firm diagnosis of cows' milk protein intolerance is made. If the mucosa is still normal, he continues on milk, and other causes for the symptoms are sought, such as an intercurrent illness, e.g. urinary tract infection or other infection. An occasional child may clinically relapse after a milk challenge despite a normal biopsy in the absence of any other explanation. This poses a difficult problem in diagnosis and may be due to patchiness of the cows' milk sensitive enteropathy. The symptoms that occur after challenge vary considerably and range from an alarming anaphylactic reaction that comes on rapidly after the child has ingested cows' milk, to the development of diarrhoea, with stools obviously blood-stained 24 or more hours after exposure to milk protein (Table 5.6\n). Vomiting is usually a striking symptom and is often the first to appear.",

In addition to the above challenge procedure, related to small intestinal biopsy, various laboratory tests have been studied to help to diagnose cows' milk protein intolerance. Anderson and Schloss in the USA in 1923 found antibodies to cows' milk protein in the serum of infants exposed to cows' milk. Since then the occurrence of circulating milk precipitins in the serum of children has been reported in a wide variety of disorders, including chronic respiratory disease and IgA deficiency. However, most authorities believe that the presence of circulating milk antibodies cannot be correlated with clinical intolerance to this protein. A good example of this is provided by some children with coeliac disease who still have cows' milk antibodies in their sera whilst in remission on a gluten-free diet with no symptoms related to milk ingestion.",

In a classic paper, Liu, Tsao and Moore, in 1967, showed that challenge with cows' milk protein could induce intestinal malabsorption of lactose in children who were intolerant to cows' milk protein. It is now clear that lactase deficiency with secondary lactose intolerance may be produced by cows' milk challenge in children who have cows' milk sensitive enteropathy, particularly when this has occurred as a sequel to acute gastroenteritis. This secondary lactase deficiency is a consequence of mucosal damage produced by cows' milk protein per se (see\nFigure 5.1) (Harrison, 1974; Harrison et al., 1976).",

The necessity for dietary treatment is always temporary, and reintroduction of a normal diet is normally nearly always possible between the age of 1 and 2 years. This may be done in the home, but a history of previous severe reactions, such as urticaria or anaphylactoid shock, is an absolute indication for reintroduction of a normal diet under very close medical supervision usually in hospital.

Chemotaxis is the ability of certain cells to move or to turn towards other cells or substances that exert a chemical influence (positive chemotaxis) or away from them (negative chemotaxis). All infants showed a significant decrease in chemotaxis at a time when the disease was active. However, this depression did not relate to the severity of the protein intolerance as judged by symptoms or the nutritional status. Random migration of neutrophils was increased in patients with active protein intolerance as compared with controls. The relationship of this observation to pathogenesis is unclear at present.",

These were first, the need to provide evidence that gluten toxicity was in fact present and that the apparent clinical response to gluten restriction was not fortuitous and second, the need to demonstrate the presence of a normal small intestinal mucosa 2 years or more after the return to a normal diet (i.e. the 2 years rule) as laid down by the European Society for Paediatric Gastroenterology in Interlaken in 1970 to exclude coeliac disease (see\nChapter 4) (Meeuwise, 1970). The precise criteria necessary to establish the existence of any form of transient intolerance to a dietary substance are indicated in diagrammatic form in Figure 5.12\n. McNeish et al. (1976), in fact, have demonstrated such early evidence of gluten toxicity by serial xylose absorption studies at the time of an early gluten challenge in an infant with an enteropathy who had previously responded to a gluten-free diet. Serial biopsies were not used to establish gluten toxicity at that time in their infant, but the mucosa has been shown to be normal 2 years after return to a normal gluten-containing diet. At the Queen Elizabeth Hospital, a child has been observed who completely fulfils both the ESPGAN and McNeish criteria for the diagnosis of transient gluten intolerance (see\nTable 5.8\n) (Walker-Smith and Phillips, 1979). This child had an early gluten challenge at age of 1 year 2 months, having previously had a flat mucosa and a clinical response to a gluten-free diet. She relapsed clinically and histologically with gluten. Subsequently, after a second challenge with gluten, she has remained clinically well and her mucosa 2 years 3 months after return to a normal gluten-containing diet has remained normal. She has now left the paediatric age group symptom free. It thus seems clear that this child had transient gluten intolerance from which she has now recovered (see\nTable 5.7\n).",

All had normal IEL levels, and all except one, normal disaccharidases. Thus, again, these children appear to have had transient gluten intolerance from which they have recovered. Schmitz, Jos and Rey (1978), from Paris, in a very important paper have described three children who had earlier responded to a gluten-free diet but who then developed flat mucosa on a gluten-containing diet at the ages of 10 years, 62 years and 4 years 8 months respectively. However, they did not return to a gluten-free diet but continued on a gluten-containing diet. Further biopsies after more than 9 years, 12 years and 5 years respectively on a normal gluten containing diet, showed surprisingly normal or near normal mucosae. The third case was having a low gluten intake but had relapsed earlier on a similar low gluten diet. Thus these three children appear to have recovered spontaneously on a gluten-containing diet. A further seven children have since been described (Schmitz et al., 1984). The author would regard this as good evidence that these children had transient gluten intolerance which was longer lasting than other children described from which they had recovered, but Schmitz, Jos and Rey have raised the possibility that the mucosal lesion of coeliac disease may disappear during adolescence only to reappear in adulthood.",
