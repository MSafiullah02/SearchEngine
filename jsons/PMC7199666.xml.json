Single nucleotide polymorphism WUR10000125 (WUR) is in complete linkage disequilibrium with the causative mutation and can be used as a tag SNP for this QTL (Boddicker et al., 2014a,b; Koltes et al., 2015). Guanylate binding protein 5 (GBP5), which plays a role in the innate immune response (Shenoy et al., 2012), was recently identified as the causative gene for this QTL (Koltes et al., 2015). The effect of WUR has been validated across breeds and genetic sources (Boddicker et al., 2014b) and following infection with 2 North American PRRS virus (PRRSV) isolates (Hess et al., 2016), vaccination with a PRRS modified live virus (MLV) vaccine (Abella et al., 2016; Dunkelberger et al., 2017), and coinfection with PRRSV and porcine circovirus type 2b (PCV2b; Dunkelberger et al., 2017).",

Reproduction traits recorded at the individual piglet level included farrowing survival (FSL; whether a piglet did [= 1]/did not [= 0] survive farrowing) and lactation survival (whether a live-born piglet did [= 1]/did not [= 0] survive until weaning). Although recorded as binary traits, FSL and lactation survival were analyzed as continuous traits as the probabilities of survival. Finishing traits included daily feed intake (DFI), recorded in grams per day from the start to the end of the test period; backfat (BFE), recorded as fat depth at the end of the test period (approximately 120 kg) in millimeters; average test daily gain (TGR), expressed in grams of weight gain per day from the start to the end of the test period; and average lifetime daily gain (LGR), expressed in grams of weight gain per day from birth to the end of the test period.",
