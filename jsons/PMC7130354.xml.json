The disease has spread rapidly throughout the region within the hospitals and into the community threatening the lives of thousands of people. As a result of this spread, schools were suspended and wearing of facemask especially in public crowded places was enforced. As of July 18, there were 8437 cases reported worldwide (WHO, 2003b). In Hong Kong, there were 1755 reported cases (including 386 healthcare workers and medical students), and 299 deaths (including eight healthcare professionals) in Hong Kong (Department of Health, 2003a). The case fatality rate of 7.6% was reported based on the number of deaths per 100 cases which was consistent with the World Health Organisation (WHO) case fatality rate calculation (Department of Health, 2003b).",

Only one individual is required to start the outbreak and the rapid intercontinental spread was related to travel of unsuspected, asymptomatic individuals who have had contact with a person with SARS (Donnelly et al., 2003). Transmission within hospitals and confined areas was by direct contact with contaminated droplets, while preliminary investigations as to the likelihood of transmission within an apartment complex (Amoy Garden) in Hong Kong was through leaky sewage pipes allowing an aerosol of faeces and urine into the narrow light well between buildings (Cyranoski and Abbott, 2002; Wong and Hui, 2003).",

In March, preliminary data on two causative agents of SARS, metapneumovirus and coronavirus, have been implicated by the medical staff of the two universities in Hong Kong. However, the WHO and CDC scientists around the world have been searching for the causative agent of SARS. Clinical specimens from patients with SARS were analysed to detect the unknown virus. Drosten et al. (2003) conducted virologic testing from respiratory and blood samples of SARS patients in Frankfurt, Germany and detected a novel coronavirus. They concluded that the extremely high concentration of the virus particles in sputum specimen were consistent with high level of contagiousness, its presence in the serum suggested a long viremic phase, and during the convalescent period, presence of the virus in feces could increase its period of infectivity which compared to the typically short infectivity of acute viral respiratory infections. Ksiazek et al. (2003) and Peiris et al. (2003) also used virus isolation technique and also isolated a novel coronavirus from patients who met the case definition of SARS. As of April 19, WHO (2003a) reported that the agent that causes SARS has now been conclusively identified as a new coronavirus unlike any other known human or animal virus in the coronavirus family.",

Depending on the age and fitness of the patient, the course of the disease can vary from patient to patient as illustrated in the case reports. However, the medical management and nursing care provided for these patients basically followed the routine care received by the four case reports presented in this paper. The combination of ribavirin and corticosteroid in treating the cases in Hong Kong have stabilised and improved the outcome of most patients with most recovering from the disease after being in the critical list for nearly a month. Since the ICU was converted to SARS-ICU, strict adherence to infection control measures, and use of goggles, visors, and protective clothing, we were able to contain the spread of the disease to other areas of the hospital and to the healthcare providers. These practices were found effective and were supported from a case-control study in five Hong Kong hospital, Seto et al. (2003) found that staff who used N-95 masks, gowns, and handwashing were less likely to develop SARS than those who did not use them. On reflection, the nursing care provided to ICU patients has been effective in spite of limited resources in personnel and equipment.",

Our experiences showed that people infected with the SARS virus are not age or gender-specific. Initial diagnosis is according to clinical symptomatology which will be confirmed by virological studies. Thus, an early presentation of the disease can help in deciding the best course of action to provide for the patients with SARS and probably halt the physiological deterioration and the need for intensive care.",

The HA has been closely monitoring the need for ICU beds and preparing for the required manpower by deploying more healthcare workers to ICU, purchasing additional latest models of ventilators, and providing crash courses in intensive care nursing (HA, 2003c).",

In order to support the staff, the hospital has established a telephone counseling hot-line for staff as well as training and preceptorship program for new nurses working in ICU. The infection among healthcare providers was a sombering reminder of the importance of adhering to infection control measures. The Hong Kong Department of Health released a set of updated infection control measures at home for staff caring for patients with SARS available through the Hong Kong government website (http://www.info.gov.hk/dh). A 2-day infection control module was also developed and all medical, nursing and allied health professional students are required to attend and pass this module before they can be allowed to return to their clinical placements.",
