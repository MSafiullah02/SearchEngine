Primary studies have evaluated the extent to which mindfulness-based interventions increase self-compassion with contradictory findings. A meta-analytic review of the literature was conducted to quantitatively synthesize the effects of mindfulness-based interventions on self-compassion among health care professionals. Methods Twenty-eight treatment outcome studies were identified eligible for inclusion. Five cumulative effect sizes were calculated using random-effects models to evaluate differences of changes in self-compassion for treatment and control groups. Within and between group comparisons were evaluated. Sub-group and moderator analyses were conducted to explore potential moderating variables. Results Twenty-seven articles (k = 29, N = 1020) were utilized in the pre-post-treatment meta-analysis. Fifteen samples (52%) included health care professionals and fourteen (48%) professional health care students. Results showed a moderate effect size between pre-post-treatment comparisons (g = .61, 95% CI = .47 to .76) for self-compassion and a strong effect size for pretreatment to follow-up (g = .76, 95% CI = .41 to 1.12). The effect size comparing post-treatment versus post-control was moderate. One exploratory moderator analysis was significant, with stronger effects for interventions with a retreat component. Conclusions Findings suggest mindfulness-based interventions improve self-compassion in health care professionals. Additionally, a variety of mindfulness-based programs may be useful for employees and trainees. Future studies with rigorous methodology evaluating effects on self-compassion and patient care from mindfulness-based interventions are warranted to extend findings and explore moderators.",

Compassion is when one experiences feelings of concern for another who is suffering, coupled with the desire to help alleviate their suffering (Klimecki and Singer 2012) . The other-oriented essence of compassion promotes prosocial behavior. Compassion fatigue is characterized by a reduced capacity for compassion (Klimecki and Singer 2012) . Arising from repetitive and intense exposure to persons experiencing trauma and suffering, compassion fatigue is thought of as a form of secondary traumatic stress. Similar to Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder, compassion fatigue is characterized by intrusive thoughts of patient suffering and trauma, chronic physiological activation, and avoidance of interactions where suffering is involved (Cocker and Joss 2016; Gallagher 2013) . This reduction of compassion is of concern for health care professionals because it may adversely affect their ability to be sensitive, nonjudgmental, and respectful to patients (Gilbert 2005; Wiklund Gustin and Wagner 2013) .",

            "text": "Given the negative consequences of stress, burnout, and compassion fatigue among health care professionals, it is critical to identify ways to prevent or reduce their occurrence and severity. One promising area of research is focused on self-compassion. The construct of self-compassion originates in Buddhist philosophy and was defined by Neff (2003) as three interconnected components: mindfulness, self-kindness, and common humanity. Self-compassion involves the employment of these three components during times of pain, failure, and difficulty. Mindfulness skills are particularly important because they promote an enhanced present-moment awareness and a willingness to experience emotions with openness, curiosity, and acceptance. Self-kindness refers to letting go of judgment and criticism, and employing kindness toward the self. Finally, common humanity is the concept that other human beings experience difficulties in life which can help prevent self-pity, isolation, and feelings of shame. The Self-Compassion Scale (SCS) was developed by Neff in 2003 and assesses the positive and negative aspects of these three main self-compassion components: mindfulness versus overidentification, self-kindness versus self-judgment, and common humanity versus isolation. This measure has demonstrated adequate construct and convergent validity (Neff 2003) , and the SCS-Short Form has shown good test-retest reliability and internal consistency (\u03b1 = .87; Raes et al. 2011) .",

The study examined 20 samples reporting data from 4007 participants. Most of the participants were students, with health care professionals accounting for about 5% of the total. They found that selfcompassion was inversely correlated with stress (r = \u2212 .54, p < .0001), depression (r = \u2212 .52, p < .0001), and anxiety symptoms (r = \u2212 .51, p < .0001). Finally, higher levels of self-compassion have been associated with higher levels of empathic concern, altruism, perspective-taking, and forgiveness of others, all desirable traits in health care professionals (Neff and Pommier 2013) . Overall, there is considerable evidence that higher levels of self-compassion are associated with positive aspects of well-being and inversely correlated with negative constructs.",

Self-compassion provides the health care professional in-the-moment self-care to alleviate personal empathetic distress and, therefore, proceed with compassionate care (Neff and Germer 2018) . Preliminary research supports the relationship of higher self-compassion and overall positive variables of well-being in health care professionals (Beaumont et al. 2016a) . Some promising early research in this area includes the recent cross-sectional survey of 213 health care professionals (Kemper et al. 2015) . They reported that self-compassion was inversely correlated with sleep difficulties (r = \u2212 .27, p < .01), and positively correlated with resilience (r = .54, p < .01). Similarly, Richardson et al. (2016) reported the results of a cross-sectional survey of 307 medical students and residents indicating that self-compassion significantly and inversely predicted burnout (\u03b2 = \u2212 .375; p < .05). Finally, conducted a cross-sectional study of 280 nurses and found that self-compassion with mindful awareness was associated with lower levels of burnout and compassion fatigue. Based on these findings, selfcompassion may play an important role in reducing burnout symptoms and enhancing well-being among health care professionals. The emerging research on self-compassion highlights the importance of fostering this ability in health care professionals who are particularly vulnerable to burnout, stress, and compassion fatigue.",

All disagreements were discussed and coding rules were updated as necessary. The search results produced 683 articles, all of which were screened for inclusion by two independent raters. Cohen's kappa was calculated to determine interrater reliability. The interrater reliability for title selection was k = .80, p < .0001 and 206 articles were retained for further review. The interrater reliability for abstract selection was k = .85, p < .01 and 74 articles retained for full-text review.

Jamovi version 1.0.5 was used to conduct moderator analyses and to generate forest plots and funnel plots (The Jamovi Project 2019). In all, the following cumulative effect sizes were calculated: pre-post-treatment for treatment groups, pre-post for control groups, pre-treatment to follow-up for treatment groups, pre-post-comparison between treatment and control groups, and treatment versus control group comparisons at post-treatment (note: treatment versus control group comparisons at follow-up were not conducted because there were too few effect sizes). Confidence intervals were generated for all cumulative effect sizes. Heterogeneity of the cumulative effect sizes were evaluated using Qtotal (Huedo-Medina et al. 2006) . Since Qtotal can be underpowered with small samples, I 2 was also calculated (Higgins and Thompson 2002) . The formula for I 2 was [Qtotal \u2212 (k-1)/ Qtotal] \u00d7 100. In cases where the Qtotal < k-1, I 2 was truncated to zero, as recommended by Higgins and Thompson (2002) .",

Second, Kendall's Tau was calculated to evaluate the relationship between effect size and sample size. Finally, Rosenthal's fail-safe number was calculated, which provides a number that indicates how many nonsignificant hypothesis tests would be needed to raise the overall p value to greater than .05.

Importantly, the consistency among effect sizes and lack of moderator effects indicates that a range of intervention formats, leader types, number of sessions, total number of hours of intervention, and home practice activities yield positive effects on self-compassion. In turn, this information suggests that medical settings and training facilities can have flexibility in the format and implementation of these kinds of programs and interventions for their employees and trainees.

Of note, most of the samples included in the pre-treatment to follow-up analysis had distributed information and resources to participants to continue their practice, and only one offered an optional \"booster\" session. If institutions are to invest in a mindfulness-based intervention for their employees or students, it would likely be worthwhile for them to include home resources (e.g., audio recordings, home practice plans, handouts, workbooks) to maintain or further develop the benefits gained from the initial intervention.",

            "text": "In regard to the types of interventions utilized, a majority of the studies implemented a version of MBSR. MBSR was the first manualized psychological treatment that incorporated mindfulness. Even though there have been several popular, empirically supported, manualized treatments that have a strong mindfulness component (e.g., MBCT, ACT, DBT), it appears that training and organizational settings have a preference for MBSR. It is possible that institutions prefer a \"stress reduction\" program, compared with programs that may seem to be designed to address \"problems\" or psychopathology. Therefore, MBSR may be more acceptable to health care students and professionals. Additionally, MBSR was designed for a medical setting, which may make it more appropriate for these populations.",

The question of the appropriate \"dosage\" of mindfulness interventions is not a new one (Bartlett et al. 2019; Carmody and Baer 2009 ). There is some support in the literature to suggest that higher dose mindfulness training produces stronger effects in well-being compared with lower dose training (e.g., single-day training) in a general working population (Chin et al. 2019 ). The current meta-analysis found that studies that included a retreat component (e.g., day of silence) demonstrated a significantly larger effect size than those without. It may be that the scheduling of a retreat component allowed the participants to experience a higher dose of the mindfulness intervention. At the same time, a retreat element would allow participants to be more disengaged from the everyday stressors and workrelated time constraints. Further exploration of the relative advantages of a retreat element for health care professionals is warranted.",

This is likely due to the relatively recent emergence of the valid and reliable measurement selfcompassion (Neff 2003) . The timing of the construct overlaps with the recent movement to employ mindfulnessbased interventions for health care professionals. Over the past decade, there has been a growth in the number of studies implementing and evaluating the effects of interventions for this population (Regehr et al. 2014; West et al. 2016) . Based on the growth in the number of these implemented programs and empirical evidence of their effectiveness, it is likely that researchers in this field will continue to publish similar articles.

            "text": "First, many studies did not meet inclusion criteria for the current meta-analysis due to insufficient data presented. Future studies should report, at the least, means, standard deviations, sample sizes, and pre-post correlations among dependent variables. Second, as more studies are published on this topic, possible outcome moderators may be identified, as the moderator analyses were likely underpowered (Hedges and Pigott 2001) . Third, there may be other unmeasured moderators that can help distinguish aspects of interventions that may be associated with effectiveness and thereby better inform clinical practice (e.g., intervention type, duration, content, home practice). Specifically, it would be important for future researchers to explore differences in outcomes after inventions with explicit versus implicit focus on teaching self-compassion. A fourth limitation was the analysis of only self-report measures. It would be important to have a better understanding of whether change in self-compassion corresponds with change in objective indices of self-care and patient care behaviors. A fifth limitation was the broad scope of our inclusion criteria for types of health care professionals and types of interventions. While our purpose was to evaluate the extent to which mindfulness interventions influenced self-compassion in professional caregivers who are at risk of compassion fatigue and burnout, regardless of their job title and years of work, we may have missed important nuances between interventions and specific types of health care providers. Sixth, results from the study quality ratings indicated that many studies did not use a randomized control trial design and did not sufficiently report their methodological procedures. It is recommended that primary researchers refer to standardized reporting guidelines, such as Jadad et al. (1996) , to increase methodological quality. Finally, there is a lack of active control group comparisons which limits the external validity of our findings. Moreover, it makes it difficult to determine whether mindfulness-based techniques per se are promoting improvements in self-compassion over and above nonspecific intervention and group variables such as social support, empathy, and problem-solving. The proposed recommendations parallel previous researchers' conclusions, more studies are warranted to better understand the effects of specific intervention components and \"dosage,\" as well as the need for more rigorous study designs (Burton et al. 2017; Dharmawardene et al. 2016) .",

Studies evaluating the differences between key variables, such as interventions with implicit versus explicit compassion skills and levels of training (students vs. employees), are warranted.
