As a result, a tool is required that is capable of automatically analyzing historical data while giving historians the freedom to dynamically adjust the parameters and context of the analysis.",

The platform provides access to a number of search and text analysis tools. The current interface allows users to access to a large collection of newspapers from the 19th-20th centuries and to analyse them using the autonomous Investigator, which processes data using a variety of analysis tools. The data collection and the tool inventory will be expanded in the near future.",
