We noticed a large gap between theory and practice: academic papers hardly discussed the effects of digitalization on the finance function, while in our meetings with practitioners this was generally the only topic on the agenda. Many practitioners indicated that the potential impact on management accounting practices and the finance function was huge, with several companies having special transformation departments (for example in marketing, human resources, and finance) to guide the digital transition.",

Most of the papers are largely conceptual (e.g. Bhimani & Willcocks, 2014; Quattrone, 2016; Arnaboldi, Busco, & Cuganesan, 2017a, b; Appelbaum et al., 2017) , with some case studies (Arnaboldi, Azzone, & Sidorova, 2017a, b) and empirical analyses (Labro et al., 2019; Oesterreich et al., 2019) . The field still appears dominated by consultants and practice pioneers (e.g. McKinsey, 2018; Deloitte, 2020) . We believe that the development is too important for academia to leave it at that. The topic deserves a careful definition (what exactly are we talking about?), as there are many 'digitalization topics' that may have a different impact on the finance function. In addition to this, an overview and structuration of the field as well as conceptual ideas and reflection may be required.",

Controllers should play an active role in addressing digital opportunities and corresponding changes in business models and organizational strategies. That has many implications. Controllers not only need to develop and adapt new KPIs, but also flexible steering approaches (e.g. the Objective and Key Results system) and new portfolio techniques, mixing traditional with digital business models. In addition, traditional capital budgeting or investment control approaches might be inadequate in the context of exponential growth fueled by digital products, platform strategies, and network economies.",

Creating and maintaining such 'a single source of truth' is a core responsibility of controllers that is, however, increasingly challenged by data scientists and other functions like IT. In the WHU digitalization pulse check, Sch\u00e4ffer and Weber (2018b) find that only 50% of chief data officers in large German companies report to the chief financial officer (CFO) or (in one case) the head of controlling. In other words, in half of the companies, the person ultimately responsible for data quality does not report to the person who traditionally claims to be the company's single source of truth regarding financial data and the interpretation thereof. In addition, new information routines might lead to a more decentralized, self-service-based reporting and decision-making environment that may change the nature of control as well as the role of controllers. The use of chat bots and other robotic process automation techniques can create efficiency gains, but requires sound governance.",

They conducted three studies on the future of controlling (2012, 2015, and 2018a) . In the first survey, the average difference between the perceived importance of the top ranked controlling trends in 2011 and the importance expected in five years from then was 0.39 points (on a 7-point Likert scale).

This is reflected in the third WHU study on the future of controlling as well as a further study Sch\u00e4ffer and Weber conducted, namely the first WHU digital pulse check (Sch\u00e4ffer & Weber, 2018b) . The authors consistently found that actual implementation is still in its infancy: 50% of the controllers surveyed indicated that their company has no digitalization strategy for controlling, while 30% reported the presence of only a preliminary strategy and a mere 6% of companies reported a relatively mature digitalization strategy in controlling. In addition, only 12% of respondents consider their company's financial investment in the digitalization of controlling to be sufficient. Similarly, in the Netherlands Kolthof et al. (2017a) found that robotic process automation (RPA) is used in transaction processing for less than 50% of the activities. In addition, only in a minority of observations business analytics is used for financial planning and analysis.",

In the companies they surveyed, data scientists typically worked in IT and operations and only 22% of companies that employ data scientists did so in the controlling function. The findings also indicate relatively little interaction between controllers and data scientists, regardless of whether the latter work in controlling or elsewhere.

            "text": "So why does it take so long for the postulated transformation of the controlling function to get underway? First of all, we know from numerous studies that processes of fundamental change take time-at least when the changes are to be sustainable and more substantial than merely scratching the surface (Frey & Osborne, 2017) . For example, Pritsch (2000) showed that it took at least 25 years-an entire generation-for the NPV method to become widespread (cf. Pritsch, 2000) . In addition, the call for a new and more proactive controller role is not new, but can be traced back to the 1970s (see Henzler, 1974; Z\u00fcnd, 1985; Siegel, 1999) . However, many controllers still seem reluctant to act as business partners and the concept is far from being intern internalized by the majority of controllers in the field. And finally, the study by Sch\u00e4ffer and Matlachowsky (2008) demonstrates that even a structured implementation project provides no guarantee that an instrument's use (specifically the balanced scorecard) will be securely anchored long-term and that this process often spans many years. In all three examples, sustainable change in the finance function is therefore a long process that cannot be measured in months or a few years. Why should this be any different in the case of digitalization?",

However, anecdotal as well as more substantive empirical evidence seems to show that CEOs tend to prioritize areas that directly add to corporate value creation, such as marketing and supply chain. Internal service providers tend to be deprioritized, resulting in the finance function being a relative latecomer as far as digital transformation is concerned. This may have implications for the overall status of the finance function and for its role in digital transformation. Indeed, the WHU digitalization pulse check of Sch\u00e4ffer and Weber informs us that only slightly more than half (56%) of digital steering committees include members from the finance function. A relatively large portion of German companies therefore appear to address digitalization topics without directly involving the finance function.",
