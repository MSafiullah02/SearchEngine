            "text": "Cystatins are single-chain reversibly binding protein inhibitors of enzymes belonging to the papain family of cysteine proteases. They have been found in plants and animals (Turk & Bode, 1991) and in protozoa (Irvine et al., 1992) . Human cystatin C (HCC) is a low molecular weight protein (13 343 Da) composed of 120 amino-acid residues (Grubb & Lo \u00c8 fberg, 1982; Fig. 1 ). It has high af\u00aenity for cathepsin B and other human cysteine proteases (reviewed in Abrahamson, 1993) . HCC plays an important role in the development of cerebral haemorrhage in patients with a hereditary form of amyloid angiopathy, where a variant of cystatin C is deposited as amyloid \u00aebrils in the cerebral arteries. This molecular pathology, caused by a point mutation and resulting in an amino-acid substitution in the HCC sequence (Leu68Gln; Fig. 1 ), leads to brain haemorrhage and death in young adults Olafsson et al., 1996) . Crystallographic and NMR studies of three cysteine-protease inhibitors, chicken cystatin C (Bode et al., 1988; Dieckmann et al., 1993; Engh et al., 1993) , cystatin B (in complex with papain; Stubbs et al., 1990 ) and cystatin A (Martin et al., 1995) , have shown similar overall structure, with three regions implicated in interactions with the target enzymes. These regions include the N-terminal segment and two hairpin loops. The 11 N-terminal aminoacid residues of HCC are important for its very high af\u00aenity binding to papain (K i = 11 fM; Lindahl et al., 1992) and to other cysteine proteases (Abrahamson et al., 1987 (Abrahamson et al., , 1991 . It has been shown that leukocyte elastase can speci\u00aecally cleave the single N-terminal Val10\u00b1Gly11 bond of HCC, resulting in seriously compromised af\u00aenities for such target enzymes as cathepsins B, H and L (Abrahamson et al., 1991) . Peptide inhibitors structurally based on the N-terminal segment of cystatin C show interesting biomedical activities, including protection against streptococcal infections in mice (Bjo \u00c8 rck et al., 1989) and inhibition of the replication of coronavirus and herpes simplex virus (Collins & Grubb, 1991; Bjo \u00c8 rck et al., 1990) . Development of a second generation of more effective speci\u00aec cysteineprotease peptide inhibitors would be greatly facilitated by a three-dimensional structure of HCC. Similarly, such a model would be very useful in the elucidation of the pathophysiological background of the cerebral haemorrhage produced by the Leu68Gln variant of HCC. Our initial attempts to solve the crystal structure of HCC by molecular replacement using as a probe the available crystallographic model of N-truncated chicken cystatin C (Bode et al., 1988 ; 41% sequence identity, 62.5% homology) were unsuccessful. We have, therefore, produced an Se-Met derivative of HCC for crystal structure determination by the MAD method (Hendrickson, 1991) .",

            "text": "Production of wild-type human cystatin C was accomplished in a previously described Escherichia coli expression system (Abrahamson et al., 1988) . For production of Se-Metenriched cystatin C, the plasmid pHD313 was transformed into competent E. coli BL834(DE3) cells (Novagen). Single colonies were picked and positive transformants were selected by their ability to express cystatin C in crystallization papers small-scale cultures (3 h induction at 315 K in LB medium) as assessed by SDS\u00b1polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. A subclone of the transformed E. coli BL834(DE3) cells was grown in minimal medium composed of 87 mM Na 2 HPO 4 , 46 mM KH 2 PO 4 , 18 mM NaCl, 7.5 mM (NH 4 ) 2 SO 4 , 0.2%(w/v) glucose, 1.7 mM MgSO 4 , 0.117 mM CaCl 2 , 0.015 mM FeSO 4 , 0.075 mM thiamine and 0.3 mM methionine or selenomethionine (Sigma). Initial cultures were grown in minimal medium containing normal methionine. Prior to induction of expression, the cells were centrifuged for 15 min at 2700g and resuspended in Se-Metcontaining minimal medium. Growth conditions and conditions for induction of expression were as described previously (Hall et al., 1993) , except that the culture time after induction of expression was prolonged to 6 h. Normal or Se-Met-enriched cystatin C was puri\u00aeed in a two-step procedure as described previously (Abrahamson et al., 1988) , resulting in a better than 95% pure protein preparation as assessed by SDS\u00b1polyacrylamide and agarose gel electrophoreses. The molecular mass of normal wild-type and Se-Met-enriched HCC was determined by electrospray mass spectrometry using a quadrupole mass spectrometer (Quattro; VG Masslab, Altrincham, Cheshire, England). The mass spectra of the selenomethionyl protein con\u00aermed that the three Met residues ( Fig. 1 ) have been fully substituted by Se-Met. A successful Met3Se-Met substitution was additionally con\u00aermed by analysing the amino-acid composition of the Se-Met protein using the Biochrom 20 amino-acid analyser (Pharmacia Biotech) and its program for analysis of physiological amino acids. The Se-Met protein was hydrolyzed in vacuo for 24 h in 6 M HCl. For crystallized Se-Met HCC, X-ray absorption spectra con\u00aermed the crystals to have a signi\u00aecant selenium content. Cystatin C devoid of ten N-terminal residues was obtained by incubation of recombinant wildtype human cystatin C with leukocyte elastase and was isolated as described previously (Abrahamson et al., 1991) .",

In the large asymmetric unit of the tetragonal form of the full-length protein, between three (3.78 A \u00ca 3 Da \u00c01 ) and seven (1.62 A \u00ca 3 Da \u00c01 ) monomers can be accommodated.

The propensity of HCC to crystallize with multiple copies of the molecule in the asymmetric unit, in combination with the additional possibilities offered by the point-symmetry elements of the unit cells, may be indicative of the tendency of the protein to oligomerize. Such oligomerization might re\u00afect the amyloid-forming property of Leu68Gln cystatin C, as earlier observations demonstrate that both wild-type and Leu68Gln-substituted cystatin C are capable of forming dimers (Abrahamson & Grubb, 1994; Ekiel & Abrahamson, 1996; Ekiel et al., 1997) .",
